      BLACK. FORCEFUL HIP-HOP MUSIC BEGINS ( NY ), builds...

      INT. GHOST S PENTHOUSE - CLOSET

      IN CLOSE ANGLES AND CUTS, a well-built black MAN gets 
      dressed. We are behind him and don t see his face-- just the 
      perfect line of his fresh fade as he puts on A CUSTOM SHIRT. 
      A CLOSE ANGLE on his monogrammed CUFF begins a SERIES OF 
      FLASHES as he adorns himself with status symbols we 
      recognize: the knot of a ZEGNA TIE-- A flash of his PATEK 
      PHILLIPE WATCH-- A BRUNO MAGLI SHOE. 

      As the music builds we SMASH TO:

      INT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

        A midnight-blue MAYBACH 57S pulls up to the curb. LOW ANGLE 
      on the pavement, as we see the Christian Louboutin-clad heels 
      of a WOMAN walk toward the back door. The door is opened by 
      an unseen chauffeur. She gets in and our Bruno Magli MAN gets 
      in after her. As the car door closes we MATCH CUT TO:

      EXT. TRUTH NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

      The Maybach door opens, the Bruno Magli shoe hits the 
      pavement, and the camera pans up to FIND JAMES  GHOST  ST. 
      PATRICK, our hero-- as handsome and debonair as a black James 
      Bond. He surveys the crowd waiting outside a mobbed Manhattan 
      club. Ghost turns and offers his hand to his woman-- and we 
      see his platinum-and-diamond wedding ring as he helps her out 
      of the car. This is his wife, TASHA,  the perfect sum of 
      street + money-- think Mary J. Blige, but so fine it hurts. 
      As she gets out of the car, she pauses, straightening her 
      Cavalli dress. She whispers in his ear:

                                  TASHA
                    Tell me I m beautiful.

                                  GHOST
                    You know you are.

      Tasha beams as Ghost lets her walk ahead of him. For a 
      second, CAMERA LINGERS ON their chauffeur, SHAWN (20, lean, 
      black), who watches Tasha s ass as she and Ghost walk down 
      the red carpet toward the club. They are recognized 
        immediately: a BOUNCER clears a path as they glide past the 
      people waiting in line. Ghost nods to MAX, the doorman (30, 
      Prada body, Prada suit) who presides over the crowd with 
        unparalleled skill. Max opens the door for Ghost and Tasha, 
      touches his radio:                                                                                      2.


                                  MAX
                    Boss is here.

      His radio message is picked up by a second bouncer inside the 
      club --

      INT. TRUTH NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

                                    BOUNCER #2
                    You hear that, y all? Boss is here.

      And as he opens the doors, ANGLE ON Ghost and Tasha as  I 
      WANT YOUR LOVE  begins and they enter the most beautiful 
      nightclub you ve ever seen: plush leather banquettes 
      surrounding a glimmering dance floor. We TRACK Ghost as 
      several bouncers guide him through the crowd, cutting away to 
      see the  Boss is here  protocol:

      -- a BARTENDER hears the radio message and turns around, 
      opening a special refrigerator. He pulls out a $1000 bottle 
      of champagne...

      -- a WAITRESS sets a tray with crystal champagne flutes... 
      and we re...

      -- WITH GHOST as the music pulsates and we take in the 
      gorgeous, dancing crowd. The party of the century and we can 
      only wish we were there. Ghost and Tasha pass various 
      CELEBRITIES and PRO ATHLETES having a good time, they accept 
      handshakes, pounds and kisses. Ghost makes eye contact with 
      several floor manager types, greeting them with a nod.

      -- the WAITRESS maneuvers expertly through the crowd, holding 
      the tray of champagne and glasses.

      -- GHOST and TASHA arrive and are seated last, King and Queen 
      at a booth of waiting guests. The waitress arrives and puts 
      down the tray in front of GHOST, who pours himself a drink as 
      the others  glasses are filled by a coterie of stunning 
      COCKTAIL WAITRESSES, one at each place.

      He holds his glass high in a toast-- everyone clinks glasses. 
      He does not drink. 

      As the congratulations wash over him, the faces and voices of 
      the people surrounding him fade into a kind of white noise. 
      Ghost sits, looking out over the crowd. He smiles, briefly.

      INT. UNDERGROUND LOADING DOCK - NIGHT

      QUICK CUT of a WOMAN s face. Eyes wide with fear. HEAR the 
      faint beat of the club s music as a MAN S HAND (white) comes 
      into frame, touches the woman s cheek.                                                                                      3.


      INT. TRUTH NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

      Ghost walks through the club, passing the main bar, where 
      BARTENDERS are pouring drinks with deliberate speed. The 
      women s room door opens, offering a glimpse of a lesbian 
      COUPLE, inside, fucking against the wall. Two other WOMEN 
      tumble out of the restroom, white powder still under one 
      woman s nose. Ghost signals a bouncer.

                                  GHOST
                    Those girls. Find out where they 
                    got it and kick him out. No one 
                    fucking sells their shit in my 
                    club.

                                    BOUNCER #3
                    Should I kick the girls out too?

                                  GHOST
                          (with a laugh)
                    Nigga, you crazy?

      Ghost watches the women laughing, blending into the happy 
      crowd, short skirts, titties bouncing. 

      INT. UNDERGROUND LOADING DOCK - NIGHT

      QUICK CUT of that same terrified woman-- the club s music 
      still playing far in the background. It s clear now that the 
      woman s lying down on cement. Her right BREAST is EXPOSED. 
      The same white hand from before strokes her breast, lingering 
      at the nipple. Her eyes follow the hand. A TEAR rolls down 
      her cheek.

      INT. TRUTH NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

      Ghost comes back to his table, where Tasha is entertaining 
      their guests. He kisses her on the cheek.

                                  GHOST
                    Everyone having a good time?

                                  TASHA
                    Everyone except you. Why don t you 
                    sit down with me, relax?

                                  GHOST
                    Not yet. I gotta handle some 
                    details.

      He starts to turn away, but she grabs his hand.

                                  TASHA
                    Don t you have people for that?                                                                                      4.


                                  GHOST
                    Customer service, Tasha. I do this 
                    part myself.

      He slips his hand from her grasp and splits. Tasha watches 
      him go, resigned. Then, she waves a waitress over, with a 
      practiced smile:

                                  TASHA
                    More champagne. More vodka. More 
                      everything.

      As her guests toast her order:  That s what I m talking 
      about,   You know that s right,  etc, we smash to:

      INT. UNDERGROUND LOADING DOCK - NIGHT

      The HAND caresses the woman s leg, traveling up to the inside 
      of her thigh. It pulls up her skirt, revealing her panties. 
      Blue lace. Cheap. We do not see her face-- just the area 
      between her navel and her upper thigh. Vulnerable. 
        Unprotected. Exposed. We HEAR a muffled sob.

      INT. TRUTH NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

      Ghost ascends to a high banquette and approaches his club 
      manager, JOSH KANTOS (30, Massapequa goes to Wharton, always 
      moving-- like a shark). The two men talk as they look over 
      the dance floor and VIP. 

                                  KANTOS
                      Headcount s at 200 and it s not 
                    even midnight. Fire Marshall told 
                    us to keep it under 150, so if he 
                    shows up we re fucked.

                                  GHOST
                    Place is fucking bananas.
                          (considers him)
                    You might be worth your paycheck.

                                  KANTOS
                    Best goddamn nightclub opening the 
                    whole year. My whole database 
                    turned out.

                                  GHOST
                    Max has your list at the front. 
                    We ll see who showed and who 
                    didn t.

      He moves to get a different vantage point. Kantos turns to 
      follow, but a WAITRESS steps between them with a magnum of 
      champagne service, headed for VIP.                                                                                       5.


      A group of MODELS follow her, heat-seeking missiles for the 
      big wallet at the end of the rainbow. Kantos catches up--

                                  KANTOS
                    I told people how hot it was gonna 
                    be, but I can t make em show up.

                                  GHOST
                    Yeah, that s right. But when this 
                    shit hits Page Six tomorrow they ll 
                    call you to make sure they can get 
                    in next week. And that s when you 
                    tell them the guest list is full.

                                  KANTOS
                    Look, Boss, my VIPs are used to 
                    easy access wherever I work.

                                  GHOST
                    Which makes you a hooker.
                          (off his look)
                    You know the right people. This 
                    place is bangin  tonight. But we 
                    stay in business if we keep the 
                    music hot, the women hotter, and 
                    make it near impossible to get in 
                    this fucking door.

                                  KANTOS
                    Even for the VIPs?

                                  GHOST
                    Fuck your VIPs. We re gonna 
                    redefine the word.

      INT. UNDERGROUND LOADING DOCK - NIGHT

      The HAND brushes a tear off of the terrified woman s cheek, 
      and we FOLLOW it to her tormentor s mouth as he tastes the 
      tear. This is EDDIE (30s, white.) Eddie pulls down the 
      woman s panties as she sobs, unable to stop herself now.

                                  EDDIE
                    Isn t it a shame, Miguel? I told 
                    her not to make a goddamn sound.
                          (to Victor, offscreen)
                    Sit him up!

      REVEAL MIGUEL ALVAREZ (20s, badly beaten) as two young 
      SOLDIERS, VICTOR and DARIEN, sit him up from where he was 
      lying in his own blood. FIND a tattoo on Miguel s arm, the 
      word  Maria  in script, flanked by angel s wings. All lines 
      in bold are Spanish:                                                                                      6.


                                  MIGUEL
                    Stop, please. Stop. Please... Leave 
                    her alone.

                                  EDDIE
                    Two keys, Miguel. Forty stacks and 
                    a pound of smoke. You think you can 
                    fucking steal from me and just walk 
                    the fuck away?

                                  MIGUEL
                    Maria did nothing. She knows 
                    nothing! I stole from you. I did 
                    it!! Please...
                          (a primal moan)
                    It s not her fault.

                                  EDDIE
                    You re right there, Miguel. It s 
                    not Maria s fault. It s yours. But 
                    you had your chance to make this 
                    right. All you have to do is tell 
                    me where you hid my shit. Who you 
                    gave it to.
                          (shaking his head)
                    He s not listening to me, Maria. 
                    You talk to him.

                                  MARIA
                    Miguel, tell him what you did with 
                    the drugs and the money! Tell him, 
                    please... Please....

      Eddie looks at Miguel expectantly. Miguel is close to giving 
      it up... you can feel it in the air. But then:

                                  MIGUEL
                    I m sorry, Maria. I m sorry.

      Eddie leaves Maria s side for a second and crosses to Miguel. 
      Whispers in his ear --

                                  EDDIE
                    Don t worry, Miguel. I m gonna give 
                    her the night of her life. And 
                    you re not gonna miss a second.

      Off Miguel, in agony --

      Over the sounds of  Remarkable , A MONTAGE of Ghost tending 
      to the details:                                                                                       7.


      -- Ghost in one end of the VIP section, gladhanding a table 
      of BLACK PRO ATHLETES. Two METHUSELAHS of ARMAND DE BRIGNAC 
      (ACE OF SPADES) CHAMPAGNE arrive with huge sparklers, 
      followed by a mix of gorgeous big booty BLACK GIRLS AND 
      LATINAS.... Ghost accepts a pound and a hug from one of the 
      athletes as he delivers what they want...

      -- Ghost signals the lighting booth, and on a music cue, the 
      lights go crazy and balloons drop from the ceiling. Ghost 
      looks on as the groups of young, hot CELEBUTANTES react to 
      the pounding beat and head to the dance floor...

      -- Ghost mixes a group of blonde, leggy MODELS, a table of 
      JAPANESE HIPSTERS, and giant bottles of sake and vodka...

      -- Ghost studies a table of POWER LESBIANS-- dressed to the 
      nines, fly as all hell-- as they order more and more shit. 
      With a nod and gesture to a bouncer, he moves them to a 
      better table, high in VIP, in view of the dance floor. As the 
      music pounds and bubbles float through the air, the men at 
      the tables near them gawk, then try to join in.... 

      And in the center of it, Ghost observes, drinking it all in. 
      His club. People enjoying themselves. Spending money. Getting 
      fucked up and getting ready to get fucked.

                                  SHAWN (O.S.)
                    Boss. Hey, Boss.

      Ghost turns around to see Shawn standing behind him.

                                  SHAWN (CONT D)
                    Eddie needs you. Downstairs.

      As Ghost reacts-- WTF? -- and starts moving, FIND Tasha in 
      her booth, looking on as her husband disappears with Shawn...

      INT. UNDERGROUND LOADING DOCK - NIGHT

      Eddie kneels on the platform, using his hands to spread 
      Maria s knees, caress her thighs. He inhales. Eddie catches 
      Miguel turning away.

                                  EDDIE
                    This is the man you were going to 
                    marry, Maria? A coward who can t 
                    even watch what he did to you.
                          (to Victor and Darien)
                    Make him watch!

      The soldiers twist Miguel s arms and head so it s physically 
      impossible for him to look away. Miguel closes his eyes.                                                                                      8.

                    Bitch! Look.

      Eddie cocks his gun, and the sound makes Miguel s eyes snap 
      open with fear. Eddie spreads Maria s legs with one hand and 
      inserts the gun barrel in her vagina with the other.

                                  EDDIE (CONT D)
                    If you close your eyes again, M jo, 
                    I ll pull the trigger.

      Ghost enters to find Miguel bleeding and beaten, Eddie with 
      his gun inside a sobbing, half-naked woman --

                    fiancee, Maria. Cruz was driving 
                    his route when this motherfucker 
                    jumped him. Beat him unconscious.

                                  GHOST
                    Cruz? So he got--

                                  EDDIE
                    The shit and the money. A whole 
                    day s paper.

                                  GHOST
                    We get it back?

                                  EDDIE
                    No. He handed it off before Victor 
                    here tracked him to his place. 
                    Found him in bed with her. No ink, 
                    won t say who he rolls with. I 
                    thought you d want to teach him a 
                    lesson in person.

                                  GHOST
                    Why d you bring the girl?

                                  EDDIE
                    He needed some persuasion to talk.

      Ghost looks at Maria, then looks at Miguel. Surveys the 
      situation. A half-second of mental math, then, quick --

                                  GHOST
                          (into Eddie s ear)
                    We gotta let her go.                                                                                      9.


      Maria watches Ghost, eyes wide. Ghost and Eddie -- intense:

                                  EDDIE
                    What the fuck are you talking 
                    about? He took what s ours, now I m 
                    taking what s his.

                                  GHOST
                    Think, Eddie. This girl has 
                    brothers or cousins -- somebody 
                    that gives a fuck about her. You 
                    fuck with her and they come running 
                    looking for her. They come with 
                    machetes or they come with guns-- 
                      Trinitarios, Kings -- people we 
                    deal with, or worse, people we 
                    don t. Overnight we re in a war 
                    because you think with your dick.

      Eddie thinks. Then he takes the gun out of Maria and puts it 
      back in his pocket.

                                  EDDIE
                    Get dressed. Say goodbye to Maria, 
                    Miguel.

      Maria backs away, sits up, grabs for her clothes. Ghost looks 
      at her.

                                  GHOST
                    Go home, take a shower. I m gonna 
                    send Victor here with you. You give 
                    him these clothes, you go to work 
                    tomorrow like nothing happened, you 
                      understand? If somebody asks you 
                    and Miguel broke up.
                          (a slight edge)
                    You were never here. You ve never 
                    seen any of us before. Do you 
                      understand?

      Maria nods and Victor steps forward, takes her arm.

                                  GHOST (CONT D)
                          (to Victor)
                    You stay until she gets out of that 
                    shower. Burn her clothes.

      Victor leads Maria away. She looks back at Miguel for a last 
      moment, at his tattoo, then looks away with disgust. Victor 
      takes her out the street door, into the night.

      Ghost watches her go, then takes off his jacket and unbuttons 
      his shirt, laying them carefully to the side. He gloves up--                                                                                    10.


                                  GHOST (CONT D)
                    You re not lucky enough to have 
                    found my money man by chance, 
                    Miguel. Somebody told you where to 
                    go and who to hit. So it s simple. 
                    We let Maria go. Tell me who set 
                    this up, who told you what to do, 
                    and I ll let you go, too. Maybe you 
                    can patch things up with her. Women 
                    can forgive.

      Miguel stares straight ahead. Giving nothing.

                                  GHOST (CONT D)
                    They tell you who you were stealing 
                    from? Did they tell you who the 
                    FUCK you were stealing from?

      Ghost makes a fist -- and on his first PUNCH, SMASH TO: 

      INT. TRUTH NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

      Kantos comes up the stairs to Ghost s VIP banquette. He 
      doesn t see Ghost, so he taps Tasha on the shoulder.

                                  KANTOS
                    Mrs. St. Patrick. Have you seen the 
                    Boss? Want to show him the numbers 
                    so far tonight.

                                  TASHA
                    No. But you can show them to me.

                                  KANTOS
                    I don t know if--

                                  TASHA
                    You can show them to me.

        Reluctantly, he hands her the post-it note, and she reads it.

                                  TASHA (CONT D)
                    That s all?

                                  KANTOS
                    Um, actually, Mrs. St. Patrick, 
                    we re having an amazing night. 
                    Like, off-the-charts.

                                  TASHA
                    If you say so.                                                                                    11.


                                  KANTOS
                    I think the Boss will be very happy 
                    when I find him. You sure you don t 
                    know where he went?

                                  TASHA
                    Nope. But wherever he is, I m sure 
                    he s working.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      INT. UNDERGROUND LOADING DOCK - NIGHT

      THWACK. Ghost slams Miguel s head into the pavement. He s a 
      bloody, fleshy mess, bones broken in his face. Eddie and 
      Darien kick Miguel, his moans and screams a world away from 
      the club upstairs. Ghost sweats with exertion, seeing that 
      Miguel will not give. 

                                  GHOST
                    The problem is, Miguel, you are  
                    suffering from a serious case of 
                    misplaced loyalty. Whoever put you 
                    up to this doesn t understand you. 
                    But I do.

      Ghost gets closer to Miguel, looks him in the eyes.

                                  GHOST (CONT D)
                    You re trying to make money, to 
                    support your family the only way 
                    you know how. But these vatos, they 
                    sent you out to steal from the 
                    wrong motherfuckers tonight. Either 
                    they overestimated you or they 
                      underestimated us -- but they left 
                    you hanging out to dry.

      Ghost holds out his hand to Eddie, who hands over his gun. 

                                  GHOST (CONT D)
                    I can give you your whole life 
                    back, Miguel. Like this all never 
                    happened. You can come work for us.

                                  MIGUEL
                    If I speak, my family will not be 
                    safe.

                                  GHOST
                    We can make this right, Miguel.

      Miguel, body broken, has his resolve intact. With effort--                                                                                    12.


                                  MIGUEL
                          (English, clear)
                    I am not afraid of death.

                                  GHOST
                    I am not afraid to kill you.

      And BOOM -- he shoots Miguel in the head.

                                  GHOST (CONT D)
                    Clean that up.

      Ghost hands the gun back to Eddie. To Darien:

                                  GHOST (CONT D)
                    I want the shit spotless. Like it 
                    never fucking happened.

      Ghost grabs his shirt and jacket and heads for the door. 
      Eddie falls into step beside him as they go into:

      INT. TRUTH - TUNNEL

      The underground hallway that leads from the loading dock to 
      the freight elevator. Florescent light. Walking together:

                                  GHOST
                    This shit makes no sense. We got 
                    nineteen drivers delivering product 
                    tonight, right?

                                  EDDIE
                    Twenty, cause Sabueso caught a 
                    bachelor party and had to stay on 
                    to deliver.

                                  GHOST
                    And this motherfucker here hits 
                    Cruz when he s holding the money 
                    from all the day runs, plus weight. 
                    If they hit him 20 minutes later, 
                    after he s done the drop at the 
                    house, they get nothing. What does 
                    that tell you?

                                  EDDIE
                    This asshole was working with one 
                    of our people. 

                                  GHOST
                    Or someone who knows our fucking 
                    business: the Trinis, the Bloods, 
                    the Latin Kings...                                                                                    13.


                                  EDDIE
                    They ve been happy with the deal we 
                    struck. We pay the toll, our 
                    drivers can roll through their 
                      territory, no problems.
                          (shakes his head)
                    Can t see why they d want to fuck 
                    with us. When we told them about 
                    this high-end call-out shit, they 
                    were happy to let us take the risk.

                                  GHOST
                    Until now. Maybe they re sick of 
                    standing on corners like dinosaurs. 
                    Maybe they want a bigger piece.

                                  EDDIE
                    If the Kings or the Trinis were 
                    trying to take us down, they d hit 
                    all our people. All at once. 

                                  GHOST
                    Which means we gotta pull everybody 
                    off the street. Now.

                                  EDDIE
                    Close the store?

                                  GHOST
                    Can t afford to get hit again.
                          (off Eddie s face)
                    We don t know who to hit back, and 
                    we can t stand around with our 
                    dicks in our hands waiting for the 
                    other guy s next move.

      A beat. Eddie knows Ghost is right.

                                  EDDIE
                    I ll make the call. 

                                  GHOST
                    You can have the Green Room in VIP. 
                    Keep an eye on shit from here 
                    tonight.

      Eddie nods and heads back to the loading dock. STAY WITH 
      GHOST and BEGIN a long TRACKING SHOT as he arrives at the --

      INT. TRUTH - FREIGHT ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

      We STAY WITH him, REAL TIME, as he re-dresses himself, 
      buttons his jacket, not a stitch out of place. He gets off 
      the elevator --                                                                                    14.


      INT. TRUTH - HALLWAY/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

      -- and walks down a cement hallway. With each step, the 
      throbbing beat of the music gets louder, until-- 

      INT. TRUTH NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

      -- Ghost steps out onto the floor, in dead center of his 
      packed club. As he surveys the scene a WAITRESS walks past 
      him with a huge bottle of sake. He stops her cold.

                                  GHOST
                    Table 45 was drinking Wataribune 
                    Sake. Take that back to the bar.
                          (before she goes)
                    And when you re done, flip the 
                    bottles at 72, 68, and 64. They all 
                    need to order another round.

                                  WAITRESS
                    I think they re slowing down.

                                  GHOST
                    Then get em up and out. There s 
                    people outside who want to give us 
                    their money. Go.

      She heads off in a hurry. Off Ghost, back in his element as 
      master salesman, not skipping a beat...

      EXT. TRUTH - NIGHT

      Eddie stands outside, up against back of the building. It s 
      as quiet and dark as the front of the club is vibrant and 
      bright. He dials his cell:

                                  JULIO (O.S.)
                    Hello?

                                  EDDIE
                    Where you at?

      INT. JULIO S CAR - NIGHT

      The other side of the conversation. JULIO (30), a strong, 
      streetwise Puerto Rican drives on the West Side Highway.

                                  JULIO (O.S.)
                    Gonna meet up with  Bueso when he s 
                    done, get his stack, make the drop 
                    at the house.                                                                                    15.


                                  EDDIE
                    Change of plans. 
                          (fuck)
                    Close the store.

                                  JULIO
                    What? Everybody?

                                  EDDIE
                    Shut it all down. Now.

      Eddie hangs up. STAY WITH Julio as he hangs up. FOLLOW his 
      eyes to his backpack, SEE it s full of cash.  He heads for 
      the highway exit, redialing his cell, while  Shooting Guns  
      begins to surge:

      INT. MANHATTAN STRIP CLUB - PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

      SABUESO (20, slim Latino male), counts cash as a suited white 
      GUY, 30s, waits. His boys (suits) are getting lapdances from 
      various strippers in the background.

                                  STRIP CLUB GUY
                    This enough to keep the girls 
                    happy? We ve got a long night ahead 
                    of us.

      Sabueso finishes counting, smiles. He reaches into his pack, 
      pulling out packets of white powder and pills. But suddenly 
      Sabueso s phone BUZZES. He looks at a text -- reacts, oh shit 
      -- and then smoothly puts the drugs back in his pack and 
      hands the guy back his money.

                                    SABUESO
                    I gotta go.

                                  STRIP CLUB GUY
                    Wait, where are you going? Dude, 
                    I m the best man. What the fuck am 
                      I supposed to do now?

      Sabueso doesn t turn around. He just heads out of the 
      building and onto the sidewalk. Off Sabueso, as he blends 
      into the crowd... SMASH TO:

      INT. POSH MIDTOWN HOTEL - NIGHT

      LILIANA (26, petite Latina, cocktail dress) gets on an 
      elevator, pushes PH. A group of drunk, partying 
        TWENTYSOMETHINGS get on, give her a look when they realize 
      she s headed to PH too. They smile at Liliana, who feels her 
      phone buzz. ANGLE on her purse, full of pill packets, as she 
      pulls out the phone, checks it -- reacts, fuck.                                                                                    16.


      The elevator doors open on the 6th floor to let some people 
      on and Liliana slips off. She moves quickly down the hall and 
      into the stairwell, heading down to the street, SMASH TO:

      INT. QUEENS TUXEDO SHOP - NIGHT

      In the back room, MARCUS (30s, black) runs stacks of money 
      through an auto-counter, then slips bands around them. He s 
      workman-like, precise. This is the  house,  where Ghost and 
      Eddie s drug money is counted before it gets laundered. James 
      is wearing SMS Audio headphones, but sees his phone buzz on 
      the table. He picks it up, checks the text, and clears the 
      money off the table into a small bag. He stands on his chair, 
      moves a ceiling tile, and off his face as he hides the bag 
      from view, SMASH TO:

      INT. BRONX WALK-UP APARTMENT - NIGHT

      FELICIA (22, tough, smart, black girl) hangs up her cell and 
      turns toward her dining room, full of women packaging 
      cocaine, pills, and weed into individual units of sale. 
       Shooting Guns  drowns out her words as the other women stop 
      what they re doing and grab their purses. Felicia throws the 
      drugs into a pack, then opens the door and they leave, single 
      file, abandoning the apartment... SMASH TO:

      EXT. PORT NEWARK - ELIZABETH MARINE TERMINAL - NIGHT

      DAVID, (27, black) stands outside a shipping container with 
      uniformed CUSTOMS OFFICER. The officer opens the container 
      and shows David several keys of cocaine, wrapped for him to 
      take delivery. David pulls a wad of cash out of his jacket 
      and begins to count. The Customs Officer s greedy eyes glow, 
      but then David s phone buzzes. He shakes his head at the 
      customs guy and repockets the cash. As both men walk away and  
      the music gets louder... SMASH TO:

      INT. TRUTH - NIGHT

      ... where  Shooting Guns  carries us back into the club, 
      where the crowd on the dance floor throbs with the music. We 
      FIND Ghost as he joins Tasha in the VIP section, back at 
      their banquette.

                                  TASHA
                      Everything ok?

                                  GHOST
                    Yeah. I m good. You having a good 
                    time? Entertaining our guests?

                                  TASHA
                    It s late, baby. Why don t we go 
                    home now?                                                                                    17.


      Her implication is clear. And she is fine. But:

                                  GHOST
                    Take the car and send Shawn back 
                    for me. Eddie and I have to work 
                    tonight.

                                  TASHA
                    Eddie s here?

                                  GHOST
                    I ll tell him you said what s up.
                          (to a passing bouncer)
                    Can you take my wife to the door? 
                     Night, T.

      Off Tasha, dismissed, as the huge Bouncer clears her path 
      through the crowd...

      INT. TRUTH - MEN S ROOM - NIGHT

      Eddie washes his hands, a bit of blood turning the runoff 
      water pink against the white sink. Eddie does a quick line of 
      coke, then exits the men s room into-- 

      INT. TRUTH - NIGHT

      -- where he makes his way across the floor, headed for the 
      VIP section. He s admiring the women when one in particular 
      catches his eye -- Tasha, on her way out of the club.

                                  EDDIE
                    Wow Tash, you look great.

                                  TASHA
                          (hugging him)
                    Eddie. Looks like you really 
                    cleaned up for the occasion.

      She indicates his LeBron X sneakers, jeans, and leather 
      jacket-- not exactly dress code for the high-end environment. 

                                  EDDIE
                    You know how it is. I don t have a 
                    girl to dress me, so I make do. 
                    You re leaving?

                                  TASHA
                    Yeah. Gotta get up with the little 
                    one tomorrow morning. Tried to get 
                    Ghost to come with me.

                                  EDDIE
                    He and I gotta talk.                                                                                    18.


                                  TASHA
                      Everything alright?

                                  EDDIE
                    It will be.
                          (then)
                    I ll see you soon, okay?

                                  TASHA
                    Oh don t I know it. If you ever 
                    meet a woman who can cook, I ll 
                    probably never see you again.

      They laugh, a real fondness between them.

                                  TASHA (CONT D)
                    Well, I d better--

                                  EDDIE
                    Yeah. See you later.

      We STAY WITH TASHA as she heads out to the curb...

      EXT. TRUTH - NIGHT

      ... and stops to look at the people waiting in line to get 
      inside, half-smiles. Shawn is waiting at the curb. He opens 
      the back door.

                                  SHAWN
                    You goin  home now, Mrs. St. 
                    Patrick?

                                  TASHA
                    Where else would I go?

      Off Tasha as she gets in the car, her smile fading...

      INT. TRUTH - NIGHT

      Ghost stands with Kantos. Across the room, he sees Eddie 
      working his way through the crowd. They make eye contact. 
      Eddie nods, and Ghost nods back. SWITCH TO Eddie s POV as he 
      moves past the tables near the DJ, and up behind the stage...

      INT. TRUTH - GREEN ROOM - NIGHT

      ... to a lush, fully-stocked bar-within-a bar. The Green 
      Room, a VIP s VIP. A bouncer ushers him inside. As the door 
      opens, we catch a flash of young, lithe REDHEADS sitting at a 
      low table, drinking champagne.                                                                                    19.


                                    REDHEAD
                    Someone named  Ghost  told us to 
                    wait for you here?

      Off Eddie s smile...

      EXT. TRUTH - NIGHT (4AM)

      Ghost stands across the street from the front of the club, 
      watching the last of the crowd tumble out into the night. 
      Eddie approaches.

                                  EDDIE
                    Been lookin  all over for you. 
                    Everyone got clear. No problems. 
                    Nobody tried shit.

                                  GHOST
                    Didn t want to miss this part.

      Bouncer #1 shuts the door behind the last stragglers. The 
      lighted  Truth  sign goes out.

                                  GHOST (CONT D)
                    All the hustling. All the work. It 
                    brought us here. For kids that grew 
                    up like us, to make something, in 
                    the city. Ain t no small shit.

                                  EDDIE
                    We lost forty stacks tonight before 
                    we closed the store, plus whatever 
                    we lost since.
                          (lightly)
                    We make up for that selling drinks?

                                  GHOST
                    You know it ain t about that.

                                  EDDIE
                    It s gonna be about our ass when 
                    Lobos finds out we left his product 
                    sitting in a shipping container, 
                    losing money by the minute.
                          (then)
                    You know he sets fire to people, 
                    right?

                                  GHOST
                    That guy was fucking his sister.
                          (but)
                    I m gonna bring him his money.                                                                                    20.


                                  EDDIE
                    Outta your own shit?

                                  GHOST
                    Unless you d like to contribute?

      Shawn pulls up at the curb in the Maybach. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Yeah, I got half. But it s out at 
                    my mother s.

                                  GHOST
                    Give it to me tomorrow night. 
                    You ll come for dinner.

                                  EDDIE
                    Thanks for the girls, by the way. 
                    Kept me busy while I was waiting 
                    for our people to check in.

                                  GHOST
                          (as he gets in the car)
                    You ever gonna get over that 
                    redhead shit?

                                  EDDIE
                    Probably not.

      Both men burst out laughing. As the Maybach pulls away...

      EXT. GHOST S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT (3AM)

      ESTABLISH Ghost s building, a gorgeous titanium and steel 
      TriBeCa high rise, overlooking the Hudson. (Think the Richard 
      Meier buildings on Perry St.) Doctors, lawyers and 
        stockbrokers share Ghost s roof-- but he s in the penthouse.

      INT. GHOST S PENTHOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      ANGLE ON the elevator, which opens directly into Ghost s 
      penthouse apartment. The doors open and Ghost walks down the 
      hall, a glass and marble cathedral for the worship of money. 
      No expense has been spared.

      INT. GHOST S PENTHOUSE - CLOSET

      Ghost undresses, removing his finery: each piece we saw in a 
      flash in the opening. The watch goes back in the automatic 
      winder. The shoes back in their space in the closet. Ghost 
      sees himself in the mirror, his eyes fixed on the blood on 
      his undershirt, the tank stained with the remnants of Miguel. 
      He s almost forgotten -- we ve almost forgotten-- but there 
      it is, undeniable.                                                                                     21.


      Ghost strips off the tank and balls it in his fist. He walks 
      down the hall into --

      INT. GHOST S PENTHOUSE - OFFICE

      Ghost enters his pristine male domain. He presses a button 
      concealed in a drawer and a cabinet face slides back, 
      revealing a safe. Inside, there are several neat stacks of 
      cash, passports, a slim photo album. Ghost grabs a stack of 
      cash, and puts it in a small bag (also kept in the safe). He 
      hides the tank top in the back of the safe. As he closes the 
      safe door, we SMASH TO -- BLACK.

      INT. GHOST S PENTHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM (DAY 2)

      BUZZ. Ghost s cell vibrates on the nightstand next to his 
      head. BUZZ. He opens his eyes-- fuck, 7:30 already -- 
      silences it. He feels Tasha shifting in bed next to him, 
      looks at her. Even half awake, she s beautiful. 

                                  TASHA
                    When d you get home?

                                  GHOST
                    Late.

      She touches his face, his neck.

                                  TASHA
                    You know, I could help you. If you 
                    let me.

                                  GHOST
                    Tasha--

      She finds him with one hand under the covers.

                                  TASHA
                    Let me.

      Ghost breathes in, then kisses her, shifting his body on top 
      of hers, taking control. What starts slowly turns into 
      hardcore fucking as he releases the stress of the previous 
      night into her body, Tasha meeting him more than halfway. He 
      FLASHES quickly to Maria, to Miguel, to the sparklers on the 
      Magnums of champagne in the club -- then pulls his focus back 
      to Tasha, flipping her face down, ass in the air. They 
      collapse together, sweaty, exhausted. A beat, then --

                                  GHOST
                    I gotta get up.

                                  TASHA
                    No.                                                                                    22.


                                  GHOST
                    Got to, baby.

      He kisses her and heads for the bathroom, leaving her fucked 
      out on the bed, happy.

      INT. GHOST S PENTHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

      Tasha cooks breakfast while her mother ESTELLE (50s, 
      boughetto), feeds Ghost and Tasha s two-year-old daughter, 
      YASMINE. Tasha s elder daughter RAINA (13, not beautiful) 
      comes in, carrying a stack of books.

                                  RAINA
                          (strong belter)
                     Don t tell Mama what you know! You 
                    can ask my papa, here and now, 
                     cause he s my agent anyhow... 

                                  TASHA
                    Raina. What are you doing?

                                  RAINA
                    I m rehearsing. Don t you remember, 
                    auditions for the eighth-grade play 
                    are next week?

                                  TASHA
                    I meant with that outfit.

                                    ESTELLE
                    It s really not flattering to your 
                    shape, baby.

      Raina looks down at her skinny jeans and Frank Ocean tee 
      shirt. She s a typical pubescent black girl -- butt too big, 
      boobs too big -- with no swagger to pull it off.

                                    ESTELLE (CONT D)
                    What about that nice dress I bought 
                    you? It covers your thighs.

                                  RAINA
                    Nobody wears dresses at school, Big 
                    Mama.

                                  TASHA
                    If you look good, it doesn t matter 
                    what everybody else is wearing, 
                    girl. You ll see.

      Raina heads off to change. Ghost comes in, carrying the money 
      bag from the prior night.                                                                                     23.


      Yasmine sees her father and runs away from Estelle. He picks 
      Yasmine up and kisses her, then kisses Estelle s cheek.

                                  GHOST
                    Good morning, Estelle.

                                    ESTELLE
                          (coolly)
                    Morning.

      Ghost and Tasha exchange an eye roll over Estelle s head, her 
        passive-aggressive attitude well known between them. Ghost s 
      cell BUZZES, and he returns the baby to her grandmother. He 
      checks the number and reacts -- fuck. He steps out into --

      INT. GHOST S PENTHOUSE - HALLWAY

      Reflective surfaces split Ghost s image as he takes the call.

                                  GHOST
                    Lobos.

      INT. BLACK SUV - DAY - INTERCUT

      FELIPE LOBOS (45, fit, manicured) sits in the back of a 
        custom-outfitted SUV, better dressed than Ghost. 

                                  LOBOS
                    Ghost. All goes well with you?

                                  GHOST
                    Yes. And you?

      INT. GHOST S PENTHOUSE - KITCHEN - INTERCUT

      Ghost s son TARIQ (15) enters, full of unearned swagger and 
      dressed to impress. Overhearing Ghost:

                                  TARIQ
                    I got Spanish homework due Tuesday, 
                    maybe Dad can hook it up?

                                  TASHA
                    You need to do your own work, boy.

                                  TARIQ
                    How does he know Spanish, anyway?

                                    ESTELLE
                    Yes, Tasha. How does he know 
                    Spanish?                                                                                    24.


                                  TASHA
                          (giving Estelle a look)
                    I don t know. He learned before we 
                    met. 

      She shuts the door between the hall and the kitchen, giving 
      Ghost his privacy.

      INT. GHOST S PENTHOUSE - HALLWAY

      Back with Ghost, in the hall.

                                  GHOST
                    We still meeting up?

                                  LOBOS
                    Yes, yes. But not this morning. 
                    Come for lunch. James Hotel. 12:30 
                    so I can take a fucking nap before 
                    I go home. Can t sleep on fucking 
                    planes. 

                                  GHOST
                    We will be there.

                                  LOBOS
                    Ah, of course, you ll bring 
                    Eduardo. See you then. Oh, and this 
                    number is dead now.

      STAY WITH LOBOS, as he expertly opens the phone, removing the 
      SIM card. He crushes the SIM card in his fist, and opens the 
      window, letting the shards fall into the street.

      INT. GHOST S PENTHOUSE - HALLWAY

      Back with Ghost, who turns back into the kitchen, 
        preoccupied. The elevator DINGS, out in the foyer.

                                  GHOST
                    Gimme some of them eggs, T.

      Tasha dishes him a plate and Ghost sits to eat. Shawn enters 
      from the foyer and Tariq reacts with a smirk.

                                  TARIQ
                          (under his breath)
                    Shouldn t the help use the back 
                    entrance?

      Only Shawn hears him -- and looks at Tariq, who smiles 
      widely. Tasha smiles genuinely, oblivious to the exchange.                                                                                    25.


                                  TASHA
                    Shawn. It must be 8:15. You want 
                    some breakfast? There s more than 
                    enough to go around. 

      Shawn accepts a biscuit from Tasha, and as she turns back to 
      the stove, checks her curves in her tight sweatsuit. Ghost 
      checks Tasha out, too, makes a decision:

                                  GHOST
                    Shawn. Change of plans. I m taking 
                    my wife shopping.

      INT. BARNEYS NEW YORK - DAY

      As  You Mean the World  begins, we re caught in the whirlwind 
      glamour of Ghost and Tasha in Barneys, fucking the place up:

      IN THE SHOE DEPARTMENT, as she tries on teetering Louboutins 
      and Jimmy Choos;

      IN ACCESSORIES, where she picks out a new Gucci bag, checking 
      it out against her body in the mirror;

      IN JEWELRY, where she slips on a new bracelet;

      And we LAND in Ready-to-Wear, where Ghost sits presiding over 
      the area outside the women s dressing rooms. He is surrounded 
      by trademark lavender shopping bags. SALESGIRLS flit about, 
      aware of the presence of a big wallet.

                                  SALESGIRL #1
                    What is he, a rapper?

                                  SALESGIRL #2
                    I don t recognize him.

      Salesgirl #2 walks past Ghost with a few dresses on hangers. 
      We might see the labels -- Cavalli, Narciso Rodriguez, 
      Proenza Schouler -- we might not. She knocks on a door.

                                  SALESGIRL #2 (CONT D)
                    You need any help, ma am?

      For answer, Tasha emerges in a Herve Leger bandage dress, so 
      tight and so bright you can see it from space.

                                  SALESGIRL #2 (CONT D)
                    Wow. Um, that fits perfectly.

                                  TASHA
                    I ll need shoes, a bag to go with 
                    it. Maybe a coat... can you show me 
                    some options?                                                                                    26.


      Salesgirl #2 scurries away. Tasha looks at herself in the 
      mirror, likes what she sees. To Ghost:

                                  TASHA (CONT D)
                    What do you think?

                                  GHOST
                    Put the other one back on.

                                  TASHA
                    Baby, this is the hottest dress in 
                    the store--

                                  GHOST
                    Let me see the other again.

      She goes. Ghost s cell BUZZES:

                                  GHOST (CONT D)
                    Ed. He wants to have lunch instead. 
                    I ll pick you up. 12:30. Awright.

      He hangs up. Salesgirl #2 returns, arms full of accessories 
      for the Leger: shoes, a clutch, a jacket.

                                  SALESGIRL #2
                    Mrs. St. Patrick, you ll love--

      But Tasha comes out in a black Bottega Veneta corset dress. 
      Still sexy, but far more high-end and mature.

                                  GHOST
                          (to Salesgirl #2)
                    Wrap it up.

                                  TASHA
                    This is old lady, baby. The blue 
                    one is more me.

      He crosses to her, stands behind her in the mirror.

                                  GHOST
                    When you come to the club tonight, 
                    you need to look like you own the 
                    place, not like you re trying to 
                    get in for free.
                          (realizing)
                    You ve got a track loose back here. 
                          (to the salesgirl)
                    Can you wrap this up, please?

      Off Tasha in the mirror, looking for the loose weave track...                                                                                    27.


      INT. KATE O NEILL S HOUSE - BABYLON, LONG ISLAND - DAY

      Eddie opens the front door and steps into the living room of 
      a good sized colonial house. The curtains are drawn and the 
      only light in the room emanates from a television tuned to a 
      syndicated judge show.

      Eddie cocks his head, but the TV makes the only sound. Silent 
      as a cat burglar, he closes and locks the door behind him, 
      then moves down the hall to -

      INT. KATE O NEILL S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

      -- where he goes down the stairs and heads straight for a 
      stand-alone deep freezer. We expect him to open it, but he 
      reaches under it:

      ANGLE ON the underside of the freezer, revealing twenty duct-
      taped packets fixed to the bottom. Eddie s fingers grab two 
      packets.

      He stands up and shoves the packets in his jacket pocket, 
      flips off the lights and heads upstairs.

      INT. KATE O NEILL S HOUSE - DAY

      Eddie s moving down the hall toward the front door when a 
      woman s voice from the dark stops him cold:

                                  KATE
                    Eddie? Is that you?

                                  EDDIE
                          (a moment, then)
                    Yeah, Ma. It s me.

                                  KATE
                    You were just gonna leave without 
                    saying anything?

                                  EDDIE
                    Why aren t you at work? What are 
                    you doing here sitting in the dark?

                                  KATE
                    I got a migraine. Last couple of 
                    days. You would have known if you 
                    had called me.
                          (then)
                    Turn on the light. Let me see you.

      Eddie turns on a light, revealing his mother, KATE O NEILL 
      (54), formerly gorgeous, now steeped in cigarettes and 
        disappointment.                                                                                     28.


      The living room is over-decorated, with QVC angel figurines 
      lined up on every available surface. Kate reaches for her 
      eyeglasses on the table next to her, but her hand is shaking.

                                  EDDIE
                    Ma, what s wrong with your hand?

      Kate quickly hides her shaking hand under her blanket, almost 
      knocking over a framed 8 x 10 of herself as a beautiful 
      Atlantic City showgirl with flame red hair.

                                  KATE
                    My nerves are bad, that s all.
                          (then)
                    You got anything on you to help me 
                    calm down? I know you do.

                                  EDDIE
                    No, Ma. No.

                                  KATE
                    I just need something to feel 
                    better. You do want me to feel 
                    better, don t you?

      Off Eddie, fuck--

      INT. JAMES HOTEL - ELEVATOR - DAY

      Eddie and Ghost get in and ride next to each other. Eddie 
      reaches into his jacket and  hands Ghost the two packets of 
      cash from Babylon. Ghost tucks them inside his bag.

                                  GHOST
                    You tell your mom I said hello?

                                  EDDIE
                    Didn t come up. Sorry.

      A beat. The two friends ride in silence.

                                  EDDIE (CONT D)
                    She s gettin  worse, you know? I 
                    can t be out there all the time--

      But Eddie s cut off by the sound of Ghost s cell. BUZZ. BUZZ. 
      Ghost looks at it.

                                  EDDIE (CONT D)
                    Lobos? He better not be changing 
                    the fucking time again.                                                                                    29.


                                  GHOST
                    Kantos. Let me just see what he 
                    wants. What s up?

      INT. TRUTH - DAY - INTERCUT

      Kantos moves through the kitchen.

                                  KANTOS
                    You recognize the name Simon Stern?

                                  GHOST
                    No. He want on the list or some 
                    shit?

                                  KANTOS
                    He s one of the biggest nightlife 
                    investors in New York. He saw the 
                    Page Six write-up about the club. 
                    Wants to sit down. Day after 
                    tomorrow.

      Eddie gives Ghost a look:  Get off the phone. 

                                  GHOST
                    I don t know. Got a lot of shit on 
                    my plate at the moment.

                                  KANTOS
                    It s a big deal. He only talks to 
                    the major guys. With Stern behind 
                    us, we could open clubs in Miami 
                    and Vegas end of next year.

      The elevator stops, and Ghost and Eddie approach the door of 
      Lobos s suite.

                                  GHOST
                    I ll call you back, man.

      Ghost hangs up, his mind reeling a bit from the idea. Eddie 
      crashes into his thoughts.

                                  EDDIE
                    What s his problem now?
                          (before Ghost can answer)
                    You know what? Nevermind. We ve got 
                    real shit to do.

      Eddie knocks on the door. Off Ghost, switching gears...                                                                                    30.


      INT. JAMES HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Eddie and Ghost sit at a dining table in a suite at the St. 
      James hotel. Lobos holds court across from them, with his 
      bodyguards present. Lobos speaks English for Eddie s benefit.

                                  LOBOS
                    You have my money, of course.

      Ghost brings out the bag he packed the night before. Lobos 
      hands it to one of his men, OMAR, who takes out the money and 
      begins to count in a whisper.

                                  LOBOS (CONT D)
                    Not out loud. What are you a grade-
                    school child? Javier, you do it.

      And JAVIER takes over. As he counts, the air is tense--

                                  GHOST
                    It s all there.

      But Lobos wants for Javier s signal. When it comes:

                                  LOBOS
                    Now that the business is out of the 
                    way, we can eat and enjoy 
                      ourselves.

                                  GHOST
                    There s something you need to know, 
                    J fe. We got hit last night.

                                  EDDIE
                    Asshole got one of our guys. 
                    Cleaned him out.

                                  LOBOS
                    You caught this man?
                          (off Eddie s nod)
                    You got the money back, the drugs?

                                  GHOST
                    No. He stashed them. Or gave it to 
                    his partner to hide. 
                          (then, as Lobos stands)
                    The thing is, the way it happened? 
                    His information was too good. He 
                    knew who to hit, where and when. 
                    Until we know how he got his 
                      information, we re exposed.

                                  LOBOS
                    And he didn t talk.                                                                                    31.


                                  EDDIE
                      Unfortunately for him.

                                  LOBOS
                      Unfortunately for you.
                          (without anger)
                    You took your men off the street.

                                  GHOST
                    Had to. No choice.

                                  LOBOS
                    You re losing about $1000 an hour. 
                    Glad to see you knew enough not to 
                    let it affect our pay schedule.
                          (with a sigh)
                    When I hired you to be my New York 
                      distributors, you guaranteed me a 
                    certain level of professionalism.

      Eddie starts to respond, but Ghost stops him with a look. 

                                  LOBOS (CONT D)
                    You told me the Kings, the Bloods, 
                    the DDP, none of them were worth my 
                    time. I believe your exact words 
                    were:  They re gangs. We re a 
                      business.  You said only you could 
                    reach the kind of high-end 
                    clientele that would pay premium 
                    rates for my product.

                                  GHOST
                    We have a plan to fix the 
                      situation.

                                  LOBOS
                    Good. Then you don t have time for 
                    lunch. Have a good day, gentlemen.

      Dismissed, Eddie and Ghost stand up to leave. Eddie heads out 
      the door. But Lobos holds Ghost back --

                                  LOBOS (CONT D)
                    You know, you get this under 
                    control, you could have your own 
                    cartel one day. You live in the 
                      countryside, take up watercolors 
                    while your men take on all the 
                    risk. You do business two, three 
                    days a year.
                          (then, a light threat)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    32.

                                  LOBOS (CONT D)
                    You don t, I ll have to take my 
                    business elsewhere. And then, what 
                    use will I have for you?

                                  GHOST
                    We ll get it done.

                                  LOBOS
                    I know you will.

      Lobos pats Ghost on the shoulder and lets him pass. The door 
      closes behind Ghost. A beat, then, to Javier--

                                  LOBOS (CONT D)
                    Tell the pilot we re not leaving 
                    tonight.

      INT. JAMES HOTEL - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Ghost and Eddie emerge into the daylight. Shawn is waiting at 
      the curb, as is Julio, behind the wheel of a fully restored 
      late 1960s Mustang. Julio gets out, tosses Eddie the keys.

                                  GHOST
                    See you tonight.
                          (then)
                    Watch your back.

                                  EDDIE
                    You too, motherfucker.

      Eddie walks past Julio, who now gets in the passenger seat.

                                  EDDIE (CONT D)
                    Full detail right? Even the trunk?

                                  JULIO
                      Especially the trunk.

                                  EDDIE
                    Good.  Cause I hate the smell of 
                    blood.

      And as the two cars pull away from the curb, Maybach first, 
      CUE the opening beats of  COMPLICATED --

      EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

      Follow each of them, split-screen, as they head through the 
      city of New York in different directions. The cars wind their 
      way out of Manhattan, over the bridges and through the 
      neighborhoods of the outer boroughs -- Eddie to Brooklyn, 
      Ghost to the Bronx.                                                                                     33.


      People react as the Maybach rolls through the projects and 
      the Mustang waits at a stop light outside a bodega... STAY 
      WITH the Maybach as it turns up a side street and parks at a 
      typical city playground. Slide, jungle gym, kids drawing in 
      chalk on the concrete. The MUSIC ends.

      Inside the car --

                                  SHAWN
                    What do we do now?

                                  GHOST
                    We wait.

      Off Ghost, calm --

      EXT. BROOKLYN ROW HOUSE - DAY

      Eddie pulls up in the Mustang, parks outside a row house with 
      kids playing in the street out front. Julio and Eddie walk up 
      the front stairs, knock on the door. A twelve-year-old GIRL, 
      MAGDALENA, opens the door.

                                  JULIO
                    Your big brother home?

      The girl eyes Eddie with suspicion, then closes the door.

                                  MAGADALENA (O.S.)
                    Tell Anibal a white man is asking 
                    for him.

      There s indecipherable shouting from inside, then the door 
      opens again.

                                  MAGADALENA (CONT D)
                          (to Eddie)
                    Come this way.

      Eddie and Julio walk through the living room and the kitchen. 
      The old women are cooking, but the young women -- gorgeous 
      and businesslike -- are counting money at the kitchen table. 
      Magadalena leads Eddie and Julio into the backyard.

      EXT. BROOKLYN ROW HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

      A string of lights is hung around the fence -- red, white, 
      blue, and lime green. Eddie s is the only white face we see 
      anywhere. Magdalena points to a group of men playing 
      Dominican Dominoes at a card table under the lights. Eddie 
      walks down into the backyard and ANIBAL, the corpulent leader 
      of this set of Trinitarios, looks up.                                                                                    34.


                                  ANIBAL
                    Eduardo. Where s Ghost?

                                  EDDIE
                    He sends his regards. And our toll.

      Eddie hands Anibal an envelope. Anibal counts, and smiles.

                                  ANIBAL
                    You play dominoes?

                                  EDDIE
                    It s not a social visit, Anibal. We 
                    got hit last night.

                                    ANNIBAL
                    I didn t hear that.

                                  EDDIE
                    Not a word?

                                  ANIBAL
                    Nada. 

                                  EDDIE
                    A score like that somebody will 
                    brag about. You ll hear something.
                          (then)
                    Fifty stacks. Seventy-five if you 
                    bring him to us alive.

                                  ANIBAL
                    It means that much to you?

                                  EDDIE
                    If it s one of your people, you can 
                    kill him yourself. We just want to 
                    watch.

      EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY 

      Ghost sits with Latin King Inca CARLOS  VIBORA  RUIZ. Ruiz 
      watches his daughter on the swings. Shawn watches from the 
      Maybach keeping an eye on Ghost and on Ruiz s men, across the 
      way in a black SUV.

                                  RUIZ
                    If I knew who ordered it, he d be 
                    dead already.

                                  GHOST
                    What?                                                                                    35.


                                  RUIZ
                    We got hit too.
                          (off Ghost s surprise)
                    Money man. Same as yours. Angel. 
                    They shot him in the back of the 
                    head. Got a baby on the way.

                                  GHOST
                    That s fucked up.

      Ghost gives Ruiz the toll envelope. Ruiz looks inside.

                                  RUIZ
                    A man of your word. Your people s 
                    safety in my territory is 
                      guaranteed.

      Ruiz rolls up his shirt, revealing his Latin King tattoos.

                                  RUIZ (CONT D)
                    I know you work with other crews. 
                    But we gotta dead this before it 
                    goes further. I could lend you some 
                    men, extra protection--

                                  GHOST
                    If our people ride together, I ll 
                    lose the trust of the Trinis and 
                    the Bloods.

                                  RUIZ
                    Can t trust them anyway.

                                  GHOST
                    Eddie and I are neutral. You know 
                    that. But maybe there s something 
                    else we can work out.

      Off Ghost, coming up with a plan...

      EXT. JAMES HOTEL - DAY

      Lobos s black SUV is waiting as he comes outside with his 
      men. Javier opens the door for Lobos, who gets inside. As the 
      SUV pulls away from the curb, FIND another car, parked a 
      block away, pulling out into traffic. The driver is a Latino 
      male THUG in a sweatshirt and sunglasses, hood pulled up over 
      his face. There s a TEARDROP TATTOO on his cheek. He follows 
      the Lobos SUV as it turns uptown.... 

      INT. GHOST S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - EVENING

      Eddie sits at the table with Tasha, Raina, Estelle and Tariq. 
      The baby (Yasmine) is already down for the night.                                                                                    36.


                                  RAINA
                    It s the lead, Uncle Eddie. If I 
                    get it, it ll be like, a huge deal 
                     cause I m only in seventh grade.

                                  EDDIE
                    Well I m sure you ve got the best 
                    singing voice in the whole place, 
                    Baby Girl.

                                  RAINA
                    When are you gonna stop calling me 
                    that? I m not the baby any more, 
                    Yasmine is.

                                  EDDIE
                    I was there when you were born. 
                    You ll always be Baby Girl to me.

                                  TASHA
                    Tariq, you re quiet tonight.

                                  TARIQ
                    Leave me alone, okay Mom?

                                  GHOST
                          (as he enters)
                    Don t take that tone with your 
                    mother, boy.

      Tasha stands to greet him, get her kiss. It s like the room 
      exhales when he arrives. He hands Raina a small box.

                                  GHOST (CONT D)
                    I got you a good luck charm for 
                    your audition.

                                  RAINA
                    You remembered! Wait, Daddy are 
                    these real diamonds?

                                  GHOST
                    What do you think?

                                  TASHA
                    You keep this up, you re gonna 
                    spoil her rotten.

                                  GHOST
                    You don t complain when I do it to 
                    you. Fix me a plate, okay? Eddie 
                    and I are gonna talk in the office. 
                    We got work to do.                                                                                    37.


      Off Tasha, shut out, as she goes to fix the plate...

      INT. GHOST S PENTHOUSE - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

      Eddie sits across from Ghost, who eats.

                                  GHOST
                    Kings got hit too.

                                  EDDIE
                          (Wow)
                    No shit.

                                  GHOST
                    Ruiz got a full shipment of weapons 
                    from his Florida connect last week. 
                    Our drivers can have full use until 
                    this shit blows over. Or until we 
                    catch the motherfucker. He offered 
                    to have his people ride with ours.

                                  EDDIE
                    Fuck that.

                                  GHOST
                          (in agreement)
                    Fuck that.

                                  EDDIE
                    The guns though, that could work. I 
                    know you don t like it--

                                  GHOST
                    Police stop a driver carrying 
                      recreational weight and some cash, 
                    that s one thing. With a gun in the 
                    car, you re lookin  at intent to 
                      distribute plus the weapons charge.

                                  EDDIE
                    You got a better idea?  Cause we 
                    gotta open up the store or Lobos 
                    will move on. Not to mention our 
                    people off the clock, and our 
                    customers finding new places to 
                    cop.

                                  GHOST
                    Let s say we find the motherfucker. 
                    If it s one of Anibal s people, or 
                    the Bloods, whoever. Then what?                                                                                    38.


                                  EDDIE
                    Then it s on. We take down their 
                    whole fucking crew. Show them show 
                    everybody you can t fuck with us. 
                    Like the old days.

                                  GHOST
                    But we were young then. Mobile. I 
                    got too much shit going on now to 
                    go into hiding. The kids. The club.

                                  EDDIE
                    Oh so now the club dictates what we 
                    do with the real business, instead 
                    of the other way around?
                          (then)
                    We opened that club to have a high-
                    volume cash business to clean our 
                    money. Period.

      Ghost looks at Eddie, decides to say it--

                                  GHOST
                    What if it could be more than that, 
                    Eddie? What if it s our retirement 
                    plan?

                                  EDDIE
                    You mean we grow up, go legit, and 
                    live happily ever after?
                          (he laughs)
                    We ve been hustling together our 
                    whole lives. I love this shit. So 
                    do you. So focus up.

      In the hallway outside the office, REVEAL Tasha, listening at 
      the door. She hears Eddie stand and she moves down the hall.

                                  EDDIE (CONT D)
                    I say we take Ruiz up on his offer. 
                    Put the boys back out on the street 
                    and if anybody steps, they light 
                    the motherfucker up. Agreed?

                                  GHOST
                          (a beat, then)
                    Yeah.

                                  EDDIE
                    We ll go out and get the guns from 
                    Ruiz tonight. I ll set it up.                                                                                    39.


                                  GHOST
                    Go without me. Take Julio.
                          (off Eddie s look)
                    I gotta handle a few things at the 
                    club. If you want a place to clean 
                    our money long-term, it s gotta 
                    stay open, right?

                                  EDDIE
                    Now that s the motherfuckin  
                    hustler I know talking.

      A pound, a hug. But off Ghost, frustrated, as Eddie leaves...

      INT. GHOST S APARTMENT - MASTER BATH - EVENING

      Ghost finds Tasha sitting at her vanity.

                                  GHOST
                    I ll see you at the club later. I m 
                    going now. Gotta make sure 
                      everything s set for tonight.

                                  TASHA
                    Can t that new white boy do that? 
                    You pay him enough.

      Tasha guides Ghost s hand inside her robe.

                                  GHOST
                    It s a business, baby. It needs 
                    attention 24-7.

                                  TASHA
                    So do I.
                          (as he pulls away)
                    Ghost, what s up? You and Eddie 
                    behind closed doors, you running 
                    around with this club.... You okay?

                                  GHOST
                          (a beat, then)
                    When we met, what did you think I 
                    was gonna be?

                                  TASHA
                    The biggest goddamn drug dealer in 
                    New York City.

                                  GHOST
                    You never thought about more?                                                                                    40.


                                  TASHA
                    What more? You talkin  about the 
                    club as more? I saw the money you 
                    made last night. That s not more, 
                    it s less.
                          (puts her arms around him)
                    You are the best at what you do. We 
                    have everything. I just want it to 
                    stay this way.

      Just like Eddie. Ghost gets up to leave. 

                                  GHOST
                    I ll send Shawn back for you.

      Off Ghost as he walks down the hall, face set...

      INT. TRUTH - LATER

      Kantos is talking to a bouncer when Ghost walks up. 

                                  GHOST
                      Everything set for tonight?

                                  KANTOS
                    Yes. Of course. Guest list is 
                    locked, live act is upstairs 
                    eating, and we re getting the 
                      decorations finished up now.

      The two men reach the club floor, decorated for the party 
      with balloons and streamers. Crew members set microphones and 
      amps on the stage. The place looks like a totally new club.

                                  GHOST
                    There s gonna be a lot of beautiful 
                    women in this place tonight. Tell 
                    the bouncers not to get distracted.

      Ghost is quiet for a moment. His club is fly and he knows it.

                                  GHOST (CONT D)
                    You said the investor guy s name is 
                    Stern? The one who called.

                                  KANTOS
                    Yes. Simon Stern.

                                  GHOST
                    I ll meet him. You ll come with me.

                                  KANTOS
                    Not Mr. O Neill?                                                                                    41.


                                  GHOST
                    Wanna see what the cat has to say 
                    before I bother Eddie with it.

      Off Ghost, splitting his worlds...

      EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

      Eddie and Julio ride in Julio s SUV. They pull into an empty 
      parking lot and stop directly next to a tremendous white 
      escalade. Eddie gets out in the middle, meets Ruiz, who gets 
      out of the Escalade with one of his soldiers. He sees Eddie 
      and Julio, frowns slightly.

                                  RUIZ
                    Where s Ghost?

                                  EDDIE
                    He sends his respects. He s working 
                    another hustle tonight.
                          (off Ruiz s look)
                    Without you, we can t get this kind 
                    of firepower overnight. You sure we 
                    can t thank you?

      Eddie opens his coat, shows Ruiz a thick stack of bills.

                                  RUIZ
                    Catch the motherfucker. That ll be 
                    thanks enough.

      He gestures to the back of the Escalade. Eddie walks back 
      with him. Ruiz presses the automatic open button on his 
      keyfob and the Escalade s back gate slowly opens, revealing 
      an arsenal of weapons. Off Eddie s face reacting happily to 
      the sight,  Get Busy  begins:

      INT. GHOST S PENTHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Tasha stands in front of the mirror, wearing the black 
      Bottega Veneta corset dress, as instructed. Makeup right, 
      weave tightened up-- she looks the part. Tasha grabs her 
      clutch and turns to leave but thinks better of it and whips 
      back around to the mirror, adjusting the top of the dress to 
      show maximum cleavage....

      INT. TRUTH - NIGHT

      As Ghost watches, DARRELLE REVIS and his entourage arrive, 
      walking through a gauntlet of waitresses holding Champagne 
      bottles with sparklers. They are guided to their VIP table as 
      the waitresses step back, revealing a room full of beautiful 
      women dancing and partying. LINGER on the women, then FIND 
      Kantos as he pulls Ghost aside...                                                                                    42.


      INT. OAXACAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

      Lobos has dinner with a group of Latino men in suits. He 
      laughs, talking with his mouth full of food, totally relaxed. 
      In the reflection of a saint painting on the wall, REVEAL the 
      TEARDROP THUG, watching Lobos from across the restaurant...

      INT./EXT. TRUTH - NIGHT

       GET BUSY  continues as Tasha enters the club with a nod from 
      Max the doorman. She stops, reacting to the redecorated club 
      and the crowd: at the young girls in tight, bright dresses 
      and the men dancing with them, moving to the pounding music. 
      She stops a bouncer.

                                  TASHA
                    Can you find my husband for me?

                                    BOUNCER
                          (into the radio)
                    Anybody got eyes on the boss?

      Tasha looks up at Revis and his friends in VIP, covered in 
      girls and alcohol and having a great time. Tasha runs her 
      hand over her black dress, feeling invisible.

                                    BOUNCER (CONT D)
                    The Boss is prepping the live act 
                    now. Can I take you to your table?

      He indicates a table upstairs with a bottle of champagne 
      chilling on ice, away from the action. Tasha looks, then:

                                  TASHA
                    I know where he ll get to me a 
                    little sooner.

      And she heads right into VIP, into the Birthday party in full 
      swing. As she works her way up to Revis s table....

      INT. TRUTH - NIGHT

      Ghost and Kantos walk and talk, high above VIP.

                                  KANTOS
                    He brought back up dancers who were 
                    not in the contract.

                    We got extra spotlights on hand?

      Kantos sees Tasha pouring drinks with the birthday boy.                                                                                     43.


                                  KANTOS
                    Isn t that your wife, down in VIP?

      But Ghost doesn t respond. Instead he s staring at a 
      beautiful WOMAN (30s) entering the club with her friends. As 
      she walks across the floor, heading for a banquette--

                                  KANTOS (CONT D)
                    Mrs. St Patrick. Right there...

      But Ghost abruptly walks away to follow the other woman. 
      She s making her way through the dance floor-- faces, bodies, 
      hands, drinks, all coming between him and his view of the 
      woman s face. 

      -- ACROSS THE ROOM IN VIP, Tasha sees Ghost crossing the room 
      toward her, eyes focused. She pours herself another glass of 
      champagne, waiting expectantly for him to arrive. But he 
      walks right past her, his eyes focused on something, someone 
      else entirely! Off Tasha as she realizes and turns to follow 
      his gaze...

      -- BACK WITH GHOST, chasing his target. The music is loud, he 
      begins to sweat. She disappears.

                                  GHOST
                          (to himself)
                    There s no way it s her.

      But then, above him at a booth, she sits down at a table and 
      we know from his face: it is most definitely her.

      INT. TRUTH - NIGHT - BANQUETTE - MOMENTS LATER

      Ghost arrives at a table of four women, each dressed to kill. 

                                  GHOST
                    You look as good as I remember.

      ANGELA VALDES (30s) looks up. She s beautiful -- and shocked.

                                  ANGELA
                    Jamie?

      Ghost breaks into a big grin -- the first real smile we ve 
      seen from him. She grins back.

                                  GHOST
                    Nobody calls me that any more.

                                  ANGELA
                    What are you doing here?                                                                                    44.


                                  GHOST
                    I own this place.
                          (signalling a waitress)
                    The real question is, what are you 
                    doing here?

                                  ANGELA
                    My girls brought me. This is Kayla, 
                    this is Cintia... Genesis here 
                    knows somebody who got us on the 
                    list. This is Jamie St. Patrick, my 
                    first real boyfriend, from about a 
                    hundred years ago.

                                  GHOST
                    James.

      Kayla and Cintia wave hello, impressed. Genesis, weaved out, 
      nails did, laced and thirsty, holds out her hand.

                                    GENESIS
                    Nice to meet you. My boy said this 
                    place would be hot and he was 
                    right. This one didn t believe me, 
                    though. We had to drag her ass out 
                    the house.

      The champagne arrives and Angela s girls coo, impressed, as 
      it s poured. Genesis takes a big, free, sip--

                                    GENESIS (CONT D)
                    And this shit is good, too.

      As Angela s friends start talking amongst themselves...

                                  ANGELA
                    This place is amazing, Jamie. But 
                    I m not surprised. I always thought 
                    you d make something out of 
                    yourself.

                                  GHOST
                    You re the one who left South 
                    Jamaica for some fancy high school 
                    out of state. What was that place 
                    called?

                                  ANGELA
                    Choate.

                                  GHOST
                    And then Princeton, right?                                                                                    45.


                                  ANGELA
                    I can t believe you remember all 
                    that. What about you? You go to 
                    school?

                                  GHOST
                    Naw. No money for nothing like 
                    that. What did you do after? Didn t 
                    come back to Queens.

                                  ANGELA
                    Law school.
                          (off his reaction)
                    Stop. I m still the same  round the 
                    way girl I always was.

                                  GHOST
                    Sure don t look like it.

                                  ANGELA
                    You either, Uptown. Nice suit.

      They share a smile, the teasing part of their old dynamic. 
      She holds his gaze. A moment between them. A BOUNCER 
      interrupts:

                                    BOUNCER #2
                    Boss, Konstant s about to start 
                    onstage.

                                  GHOST
                          (eyes still on Angela)
                    What?

                                    BOUNCER #2
                    The live act. 

                                  GHOST
                          (to Angela)
                    I m sorry. I ve got to--

                                  ANGELA
                      I understand. You ve got a club to 
                    run. It was good to see you.

                                  GHOST
                    Hey, I ain t lettin  you get away 
                    that easy. Give me your number.

      Angela hesitates -- a little. Then, what the hell?

                                  ANGELA
                          (As Ghost types)
                    212 - 555 - 4780.                                                                                    46.


      Ghost takes Angela s hand and holds it for a second, grazing 
      her fingers with his own. ACROSS THE CLUB, Tasha watches the 
      whole exchange, burning at the obvious intimacy. She doesn t 
      know who Angela is, but it s clear that ain t no random ho.

                                  GHOST
                    I ll call you.

      Tasha watches Ghost walk away from Angela and head for the 
      stage. She gets up from the table and heads directly for the 
      door, down the stairs. She almost knocks Kantos over as she 
      tries to pass him, but he stops her. 

                                  KANTOS
                    Mrs. St. Patrick. You re not 
                    leaving, are you? The live 
                      performance starts in a few 
                    minutes, and I m sure the Boss 
                    wants you to be here--

                                  TASHA
                          (dialing phone)
                    Shawn. Meet me out front. I m 
                    leaving.

      Off Kantos as she leaves...

      ANGLE ON THE DJ as the lights change, plunging the room into 
      color and the DJ lowers the music:

                                  DJ
                    Ladies and gentlemen. I d like you 
                    to direct your attention to the 
                    stage for tonight s intimate live 
                      performance.

      ANGLE ON THE STAGE as rap artist Konstant comes out, with a 
      nod to Ghost. The crowd roars, and Konstant begins a silky, 
      sexy hip-hop track that carries us into...

      INT. GHOST S MAYBACH - NIGHT 

      Shawn drives with Tasha riding in back, alone. The partition 
      is opaque. He can t see her. She looks out into the night. 
      It s New York and there are a few people left on the streets-- 
      some criminals, some citizens, the night still alive. Tasha 
      lowers a mirror and looks at herself in the black dress, 
      checks out her reflection. She does not cry.

      INT. TRUTH - NIGHT

      Ghost looks at Angela s table -- it s empty. She and her 
      girls must be somewhere in the crowd, but it s too dark to 
      find them.                                                                                     47.


      His eyes fall on his private booth and realizes for the first 
      time that Tasha is not there. Off Ghost, turning back to the 
      stage, as the music continues...

      INT. GHOST S MAYBACH - NIGHT

      Tasha takes a breath, then closes the mirror. She presses a 
      button and clears the electro-transparent glass, removing the 
      visual barrier between herself and Shawn. Shawn looks up and 
      sees Tasha removing her panties slowly, opening her legs. She 
      lowers the top of her dress, exposing her breasts and then 
      begins to touch herself, holding Shawn s gaze through his 
      rear view mirror. Shawn s palms begin to sweat. A taxi merges 
      in front of him and Shawn realizes he s unsafe at any speed. 
      He pulls the car over, then keeps his hands on the wheel as 
      he watches Tasha bring herself to orgasm. Tasha feeds off his 
      gaze, rocking and moaning with pleasure.

      Done, she pulls her dress back up. Shawn starts the car. She 
      touches the control, and the glass goes opaque. From Shawn s 
      face, beads of sweat on his forehead...

      EXT. TRUTH - NIGHT

      ... and the sexy song ends. Konstant revs up into a club 
      banger, and Ghost watches as the crowd goes apeshit, dancing. 
      His phone BUZZES with a text from Eddie:  Done.  Ghost types 
       4AM,  then puts his phone away and turns back to the packed 
      club. The CAMERA PANS the room in his POV, then swings around 
      to reveal we re --

      INT. WAREHOUSE - OFFICE - EARLY MORNING (DAY 3)

      - and Ghost, wearing a different suit now, stands at the 
      window overlooking the warehouse floor. He watches as his 
      drug couriers (about 20 mostly brown and black MEN and WOMEN, 
      including Sabueso and Liliana) receive weapons from Julio. 
      Eddie steps up next to him, into the shot.

                                  GHOST
                    Julio told em to check the guns?

                                  EDDIE
                    First thing I said to him.

      The couriers smell the guns, check the barrels. Camera 
      LINGERS on Liliana, as she expertly handles her weapon. A 
      chorus of  clean,   never been fired,   fresh  in English and 
      Spanish as each checks. Julio looks up at them, nods. In 
      JULIO s POV, we look up to the office and realize -- Ghost 
      and Eddie are hidden from view.                                                                                    48.


                                  EDDIE (CONT D)
                    Think it bothers them? That they 
                    don t know who they re working for?

                                  GHOST
                    You think the fry cook at Burger 
                    King knows the fucking CEO? They 
                    wouldn t know that motherfucker if 
                    he walked in and asked for extra 
                    ketchup.
                          (then, off Eddie s laugh)
                    Don t forget, one of these 
                      motherfuckers might be the reason 
                    Cruz got jumped in the first place.

                                  EDDIE
                    Let s hope he or she is afraid to 
                    get shot.

                                  GHOST
                    We ll know soon enough.
                          (then)
                    Time to make the donuts.

      INT. WAREHOUSE - FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

      Julio gets a text from Eddie:  Do it.  To the couriers:

                                  JULIO
                    Keep the heat out of sight. If 
                    someone s tracking us, we want them 
                    to try some shit. Now get to work.

      The drug couriers get in their cars and roll out, STAY WITH 
      Sabueso as he drives out --

      EXT. NEW YORK STREET/ INT. SABUESO S SUV - DAY

      FOLLOW Sabueso s SUV as he heads back toward Manhattan. He 
      dials through the Bluetooth in his car.

                                    SABUESO
                    Yo, Kendall. It s  Bueso.

                                    KENDALL (O.C.)
                    Where have you been? I ve been 
                    texting you for two days.

      EXT. MANHATTAN STREET/ INT. SABUESO S SUV - MOMENTS LATER

      He parks, then takes off his cap. He puts on a pair of 
      glasses, grabs his backpack from the backseat -- superman s 
      reverse transformation from Ghetto thug to -- as we see the 
      sticker on the back of his bag -- NYU student.                                                                                    49.


      INT. UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

      Liliana walks in and heads for the elevator. A uniformed 
      DOORMAN stops her.

                                    DOORMAN
                    Excuse me, miss?

                                    LILIANA
                    The Levins are expecting me. 38B? 
                    I m the new housekeeper.

      INT. UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - DAY

      Liliana rings the doorbell and a Jamaican WOMAN holding a 
      white toddler opens the door.

                                  GARDENIA
                    Where you been hiding, girl? The 
                    Mrs. can t get out the bed.

      Liliana follows Gardenia down the hall to the master bedroom. 
      A thin, beautiful woman is lying in bed.

                                  GARDENIA (CONT D)
                    Mrs. Jessica, the girl is here.

                                    JESSICA
                    Oh thank God. When you didn t 
                    answer your phone yesterday--

                                    LILIANA
                    Sorry about that.
                          (opening her pack)
                    Won t happen again.

      Jessica smiles as Liliana unpacks powder and pills. 

      INT. ANGELA S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

      Angela gets dressed in front of the mirror. She gives herself 
        a once-over, turns to the side, examining her body.

                                  ANGELA
                    Not bad for twenty years later.

      She hears a clattering SOUND off-screen -- WTF? -- and heads 
      for the kitchen, tucking her blouse into her pencil skirt.

      INT. ANGELA S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY

      Angela walks through her neat, comfortable place into the 
      kitchen where GREG KNOX (35, all-American, hyper-fit) 
      scrambles egg whites.                                                                                    50.


                                  GREG
                    You missed our run this morning. 
                    When you didn t show up and you 
                    didn t answer your cell, I thought 
                    maybe something was wrong.

      Angela digs her phone out of her clutch from the previous 
      night. Sure enough five missed calls -- all from Greg.

                                  GREG (CONT D)
                    I got here and you were asleep, so 
                    I thought I d make breakfast.

                                  ANGELA
                    I thought we said that key was just 
                    for emergencies.

                                  GREG
                    Which this could have been. You 
                    want some turkey bacon?
                          (off her face)
                    Come on, Angel, most women would be 
                      flattered.

      Greg puts the plate down in front of her at the table.

                                  ANGELA
                    You re right. I m sorry. You just 
                    startled me, is all. Thank you.

      She kisses him, but he breaks the kiss to answer his buzzing 
      cell. Angela picks up a slice of whole-grain toast, watches 
      him read the text.

                                  GREG
                    I gotta go. See you later?

      He kisses her goodbye. Off Angela, as she watches him go...

      INT. EDDIE S CAR - DAY

      Eddie drives Ghost into the city. Ghost looks out the window 
      at some kids hanging out on the corner. Eddie sees them, too.

                                  GHOST
                    Angela Valdes came into the club 
                    opening night.

                                  EDDIE
                    From freshman year of high school? 
                    Wow. What s that--

                                  GHOST
                    Twenty years. Twenty-two.                                                                                    51.


                                  EDDIE
                    How d she look?
                          (off Ghost s reaction)
                    That good, huh? She married, have 
                    kids now?

                                  GHOST
                    No ring. Didn t say nothing about 
                    kids.

                                  EDDIE
                    You tell her about yours?

                                  GHOST
                    Well, we didn t talk that long--

                                  EDDIE
                    Ohhhhh shit--

                                  GHOST
                    What s that supposed to mean?

                                  EDDIE
                    It means, what are you thinking 
                    about doing?
                          (eyeballs Ghost)
                    When that girl moved away, she 
                    seriously fucked you up. I was 
                    there, remember?

                                  GHOST
                    That was a long time ago.

                                  EDDIE
                    Tasha s a good woman, man. Why you 
                    wanna go sniffing around pussy from 
                    high school?

                                  GHOST
                    First of all, I can t believe 
                    you re starting some shit about 
                    monogamy. You got more bitches than 
                    the goddamn pound. But second, I 
                    know Tasha and I got a good thing. 
                    I m not gonna fuck that up.
                          (then)
                    Just got me thinking about the road 
                    not traveled, that s all.

                                  EDDIE
                    The road not traveled? You are a 
                    rich, successful motherfucker. What 
                    the fuck more do you want?                                                                                    52.


                                  GHOST
                    I want to see how Angela turned 
                    out. 

                                  EDDIE
                    You already saw how she turned out. 
                    Anything else is just you trying to 
                    heal some wounds from childhood.

                                  GHOST
                          (a beat, then)
                    You need to stop watching that Dr. 
                    Phil shit.

                                  EDDIE
                    The man knows what he s talking 
                    about!

      Eddie pulls up outside the club. Ghost can t help but laugh.

                                  GHOST
                    So long, motherfucker.
                          (then)
                    Keep me posted.

      Off Ghost, as Eddie drives away from the curb-- 

      INT. BOXING GYM - DAY

      Latino MEN of all shades and sizes work out with jump ropes 
      and heavy bags. A couple of pairs are sparring on the floor 
      while two guys spar in the ring. FIND LOBOS, crossing the 
      floor with Javier.

                                  LOBOS
                    Are you sure this is the place?

                                  JAVIER
                    Yes. In the office.

      And they arrive at a door marked Private. Javier opens it for 
      Lobos who steps in to find...

      INT. BOXING GYM - OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      ... Ruiz, Ghost s supposed ally, waiting for Lobos with two 
      of his Latin Kings. Hands on guns. The mood is tense.

                                  LOBOS
                    You are  Vibora  Ruiz?                                                                                    53.


                                  RUIZ
                    Good to meet you, Se or. You said 
                    you are having problems with your 
                    current distributor?

                                  LOBOS
                    He is not as... reliable as I once 
                    thought.

      Ruiz smiles, but he is still suspicious.

                                  RUIZ
                    So you call Puerto Ricans? You re 
                    the first Mexican I ve known to do 
                    that. Forgive my surprise.

                                  LOBOS
                    I do business with niggers. At 
                    least you and I speak the same 
                    language.
                          (they smile)
                    I don t care who your mother 
                    fucked. I want to make money.

      Ruiz considers Lobos for a beat, then gestures to the table.

                                  RUIZ
                    Shall we talk business, then?

      As they sit, LAND ON a door, a small piece of wood stuck in 
      to keep it open a crack. TRACK through the crack to... 

      INT. BOXING GYM - HALLWAY - DAY

      ... where TEARDROP THUG watches the meeting through the door.

      INT. TRUTH - DAY

      Kantos is checking the front bar when Ghost enters.

                                  KANTOS
                    Didn t expect to see you so early.

                                  GHOST
                    Had some business to take care of 
                    this morning.

                                  KANTOS
                    Actually, I m glad you re here. I 
                    need to show you something 
                      downstairs on the loading dock.

      The loading dock. Fuck. He forgot all about that shit.                                                                                     54.


                                  GHOST
                    On the loading dock?

                                  KANTOS
                    Yeah. Something weird. I think we 
                    need to call the police.

      Off Ghost, fuck, as Kantos leads the way...

      INT. TUNNEL - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Ghost and Kantos walk through the tunnel.

                                  KANTOS
                    I ve been in the club business ten 
                    years-- I know you can t trust 
                    cops. But shit like this you need 
                    to get them involved.

                                  GHOST
                          (with an easy smile)
                    I m a black man, so you know I hate 
                    cops. But I hear you.

      As Kantos reaches the door, Ghost lets him go first. His 
      smile fades. As Ghost follows Kantos, REVEAL Ghost holds a 
      gun, low, partially covered by the arm of his jacket.

      INT. UNDERGROUND LOADING DOCK - CONTINUOUS

      Ghost enters the loading dock, which appears to be spotless. 
      But Kantos is heading over to a corner, focused on the floor.

                                  KANTOS
                    Take a look at this, Boss. What the 
                    fuck do you think happened here?

      Ghost follows Kantos s gaze down to the cement, where several 
      seals and liquor labels are stuck to the cement.

                                  KANTOS (CONT D)
                    We don t open those seals until we 
                    get the boxes upstairs. If that 
                    shit was taken off down here, it 
                    means somebody s stealing alcohol 
                    on its way in.

      Ghost relaxes and pockets the weapon.

                                  KANTOS (CONT D)
                    No wonder we almost ran out of Ace 
                    of Spades last night. You want me 
                    to call the police?                                                                                    55.


                                  GHOST
                    Why don t we talk to the employees 
                    first? Hate to get the cops 
                    involved if we can just fire the 
                    person and never see them again.

                                  KANTOS
                    You don t want to press charges?

                                  GHOST
                    May not be necessary.

                                  KANTOS
                    I m gonna review the liquor 
                    receipts. Unless you want to do 
                    that yourself?

                                  GHOST
                    No, you go ahead. I ve got a phone 
                    call to make.

      INT. GHOST S PENTHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

      Tasha is getting dressed: skintight jeans, bright-colored low 
      cut sweater, spike-heeled boots. Her best friend, LAKEISHA 
      GRANT (30s, doing her best) holds up a Gucci purse.

                                  LAKEISHA
                    Can I borrow this?

                                  TASHA
                    No way, girl. That s new. But the 
                    Louis, you can have that.

                                  LAKEISHA
                          (picking up an LV tote)
                    Damn, Ghost keeps you laced. I ll 
                    take your hand-me-downs as long as 
                    you re giving them out.
                          (trying it on)
                    You hit the lottery, girl. Niggas 
                    don t like to get married any more. 
                    And certainly not rich niggas.

                                  TASHA
                    He wasn t rich when I met him. That 
                    was a long time ago now.
                          (then, sitting on the bed)
                    You know, Keisha, clothes and bags 
                    are nice, but... I mean, there are 
                    some things about Ghost--                                                                                    56.


                                  LAKEISHA
                    You don t have to play modest with 
                    me, Tasha.

                                  TASHA
                    I m not playing modest--

                                  LAKEISHA
                    I m not gonna die of jealousy over 
                    here. Especially if you re through 
                    with these pumps.
                          (looking at them)
                    What size shoe do you wear again? I 
                    don t get this European shit.

      Tasha s phone RINGS. She checks it:  Ghost. 

                                  TASHA
                    Hey, baby.

      INT. TRUTH - HALLWAY - DAY 

      Ghost walks down the hall, on the phone.

                                  GHOST
                    You out shopping with LaKeisha yet?

                                  TASHA
                    We re still at the house.

                                  GHOST
                    Good. I got something in the oven I 
                    need you to take care of.
                          (off her silence)
                    Tasha? You heard me? I need you to 
                    take it out before it burns.

                                  TASHA
                    Yes. I got it.
                          (for LaKeisha s benefit)
                    Thank you, baby. I ll see you 
                    tonight.

                                  LAKEISHA
                    What was that?

                                  TASHA
                    He left me some extra money to go 
                    shopping. I ll just go get it. I ll 
                    be right back.

                                  LAKEISHA
                    See what I mean? You hit the 
                      motherfucking lottery.                                                                                    57.


      But Tasha s already gone, down the hall to..

      INT. GHOST S PENTHOUSE - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Tasha presses the button in the drawer, opening the panel 
      that reveals the safe. Tasha kneels in front of the safe and 
      opens it. She reaches for a stack of cash, neatly counting 
      herself 10K to go shopping. But she doesn t close the safe. 
      Instead she reaches further, in the back, looking for 
      something.  Suddenly she stops-- found it. Tasha pulls the 
       hot  thing out of the  oven:  Ghost s bloody tank from the 
      opening night of the club. Off Tasha...

      INT. LOWER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - DAY

      Sabueso knocks on an apartment door. We hear the peephole 
      cover as it s pulled back, then the door opens. Liliana 
      ushers him in, takes his backpack and dumps the money on the 
      table, where Julio is loading money into a green duffle bag. 
      Julio nods at Sabueso, who nods back.

      INT. QUEENS TUXEDO SHOP - DAY

      Julio enters the back room, where Marcus stuffs a series of 
      narrow manila envelopes with bills, then seals them. He then 
      stacks the envelopes into a blue duffle. Marcus zips the 
      duffle closed and hands it off to Julio, who gives him the 
      green duffle in exchange. As Julio leaves, Marcus opens the 
      green duffle and starts running the money through the auto-
      counter....

      EXT. NEW YORK STREET/ INT. EDDIE S CAR - DAY

      Eddie pulls up at the curb, and Julio gets in the car. Eddie 
      grabs and opens the blue duffle, seeing the envelopes inside.

      INT. GHOST S MAYBACH - DAY

      Ghost rides in the back, with the partition open. Shawn 
      clocks Ghost dialing his phone, watches him.

                                  GHOST
                    Angela?

      INT. ANGELA S OFFICE - DAY - INTERCUT

      A small corporate office. Angela closes her door for privacy.

                                  ANGELA
                    Jamie?                                                                                    58.


                                  GHOST
                    You surprised I called? I told you 
                    I wasn t gonna let you get away, 
                    and I meant it.
                          (then)
                    What are you doing?

                                  ANGELA
                    Right now?

                                  GHOST
                    Right now.

      Angela looks at the pile of paper on her desk.

                                  ANGELA
                    I m working. I have to give a 
                      presentation to my whole department 
                    today.

                                  GHOST
                    And if I know you, you ve been 
                    studying on that shit for weeks. 
                    Come on, girl. You gotta eat lunch.

      Angela catches her reflection in her office window-- flushed, 
      blushing, a giddy teenager again. Off Angela s excited grin --

      INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

      White tablecloths, crystal stemware. Ghost and Angela finish 
      lunch at a secluded table. The tone is light, but the heat 
      between them is palpable -- eyes lingering, fingers almost 
      touching on the table.

                                  ANGELA
                    Sometimes I still feel weird in 
                    places like this. You ever feel 
                    like that? Like people are gonna 
                    come kick you out, tell you to go 
                    back to Queens?

                                  GHOST
                    Not anymore. And if you ask me, you 
                    fit in just fine.
                          (off her smile)
                    You been in New York, under my nose 
                    this whole time?

                                  ANGELA
                    No. Actually just moved back a 
                    couple months ago. I d been in 
                    Philly, but I got a promotion.                                                                                    59.


                                  GHOST
                      Congratulations. Guess we d better 
                    get something bubbly to celebrate.

                                  ANGELA
                    Second time in two days you re 
                    trying to buy me champagne.

                                  GHOST
                    I ain t buyin  shit. This 
                      champagne s on you, Big Time.

      She laughs. It feels good to be around him again. Too good.

                                  GHOST (CONT D)
                    Not trying to get you drunk. It s 
                    just a habit from the club.

                                  ANGELA
                    You finally got your nightclub. 
                    Your dad would have been proud.

                                  GHOST
                    I told you about my father?
                          (a moment, then)
                    I didn t remember I told you that.

                                  ANGELA
                    He had a jazz club uptown, right?

                                  GHOST
                    For a couple years. Before he died.
                          (moving on)
                    You have a good time last night? I 
                    couldn t find you after the show 
                    started.

                                  ANGELA
                    You looked for me? Sorry. I had to 
                    get up early this morning. But it s 
                      a beautiful place, Jamie. You 
                    should be really proud.

                                  GHOST
                    It s a lot of work. Eddie thinks I 
                    spend too much time there--

                                  ANGELA
                    Eddie? Eddie O Neill? You still 
                    hang out with him?

                                  GHOST
                    Yeah, he s my partner in the club. 
                    What, you surprised we still tight?                                                                                    60.


                                  ANGELA
                    Well, yeah. Eddie... it was like he 
                    wanted to be in the streets. With 
                    you, I don t know, I never thought 
                    that s who you really were, even 
                    back then. I always wondered... if 
                    you d done Prep for Prep with me, 
                    gone to school...
                          (embarrassed)
                    I guess I had big plans for you.

                                  GHOST
                    Like what?

                                  ANGELA
                    Like who you are now.
                          (formal voice)
                     A successful Manhattan 
                      businessman. 
                          (they both laugh, then)
                    A good man.

      He takes that in. Her eyes fall on the Patek Phillipe.

                                  ANGELA (CONT D)
                    With a very big watch. I gotta go.

      They stand up. He leans in to kiss her on the cheek, but then 
      puts his arms around her, hugging her close. CLOSE ON Angela, 
      as she feels his body against hers and breathes in his smell, 
      familiar and exciting. She hates to break away:

                                  ANGELA (CONT D)
                    Hey, you still remember the Spanish 
                    I taught you?

                                  GHOST
                    A little.
                          (she smiles)
                    When can we do this again?

                                  ANGELA
                    I ll call you.

      Off Ghost, as he watches her leave...

      INT. TRUTH - KANTOS S OFFICE - DAY

      Kantos opens the safe in his office and pulls out the cash 
      dumps for the previous two nights-- in the exact same manila 
      envelopes we saw at the tuxedo shop in Queens.                                                                                     61.


      He pulls a lockbag out of the safe and puts the cash inside. 
      He writes out a cash declaration -- $26,873 -- then grabs a 
      deposit slip and fills it out, with full name and signature.

                                  EDDIE (O.C.)
                    Don t fill out the total.

      Kantos looks up with a start to see Eddie standing in the 
      doorway, holding the blue duffle bag.

                                  KANTOS
                    Why not?

                                  EDDIE
                    I m going to confirm your count at 
                    the bank.
                          (indicating the lockbag)
                    I ll take that.

      Kantos hands it over, pissed.

                                  KANTOS
                    Every club I ve ever managed, I 
                    always do the deposit.

                                  EDDIE
                    There s a first time for 
                      everything. Deposit slip?

                                  KANTOS
                    I already signed it. You want a 
                    fresh one?

                                  EDDIE
                    Nah, I m sure yours ll turn out 
                    fine. Look--
                          (as he turns to go)
                    Ghost hired you on your reputation. 
                    But I don t know you yet.
                          (off Kantos s face)
                    That s not a problem, is it?

      Kantos makes a calculation; he doesn t know Eddie, either.

                                  KANTOS
                    No. It s not.

      Eddie leaves with a wave. Off Kantos, feeling disrespected...

      INT. ANGELA S OFFICE - CONFERNCE ROOM

      Angela comes in, still flushed from lunch with Ghost, and 
      sits next to her boss, FRANKIE LAVARRO (50s, lesbian, sexy.) 
      The room is coming to order, with most seats full.                                                                                    62.


                                    FRANKIE
                    I was about to send out a search 
                    party. You re never late.

                                  ANGELA
                    I know, sorry. Lunch ran long.
                          (off Frankie s look)
                    Frankie, I know you went out on a 
                    limb for me. I m not gonna blow it.

      Angela takes out her binder, clearly labeled ANGELA VALDES, 
      ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, and finds her remarks.

                                    FRANKIE
                    If you do, it s both our asses.
                          (checks her watch)
                    Where are these FBI bozos? Never 
                    think we can start a party without 
                    them. I d better get up there.

      Frankie stands and goes to the lectern. As she passes the 
      door, it opens and several FEDERAL AGENTS enter, with FBI 
      jackets and full credentials displayed. We recognize one of 
      them: Greg, Angela s boyfriend. He sits next to her, gives 
      her a cool, professional nod. A whisper:

                                  ANGELA
                    You re on this now?

                                  GREG
                    Just got assigned. If I request 
                      reassignment they re gonna ask why.

                                  ANGELA
                    It s not a problem.

      But her face says otherwise. Greg clocks this, but before he 
      can say anything more, Frankie begins the meeting.

                                    FRANKIE
                    I m Francesca Lavarro, Chief of 
                    Criminal Division. Along with my 
                    deputy, AUSA Angela Valdes, I ll be 
                    heading up this task force. Our 
                    goal is the apprehension and 
                      prosecution of one of the most 
                    notorious drug traffickers in our 
                      hemisphere, a Mexican national 
                    named Felipe Lobos.

      Frankie hits a button, displaying a PHOTO of LOBOS on the 
      monitor behind her.                                                                                    63.


                                    FRANKIE (CONT D)
                    Agent Medina, can you come up and 
                    bring everybody up to speed on 
                    Lobos s movements here in New York 
                    this week?

      AGENT JUAN JULIO MEDINA enters and takes the lectern. Dressed 
      in a suit, with his close-cropped hair exposed, we don t 
      recognize him -- until we get close and see the teardrop 
      tattoo on his face. That s right-- TEARDROP THUG is a Fed.

                                  TEARDROP THUG/MEDINA
                    Lobos landed at Teterboro airport 
                    on Tuesday. Once a year he comes to 
                    New York to visit his banker and 
                    his American attorneys. He did make 
                    those appointments, but also a 
                    third, to meet this man--

                    Carlos  Vibora  Ruiz.

                    Inca of the Due Loco set of the 
                    Latin Kings.

                                  TEARDROP THUG/MEDINA
                    We learned: 1) Lobos has one single 
                      distributor for his product in New 
                    York City; 2) He is not entirely 
                    happy with this distributor; and 3) 
                    the Kings are too low-rent for 
                    Lobos. Their customers can t afford 
                    his product-- and he was not shy 
                    about saying that to Ruiz. He did 
                    not give a fuuuuck.

      The room laughs. Medina heads back to his seat, and Angela 
      takes the lectern. She avoids eye contact with Greg.

                    We have permission from the Mexican 
                      government to detain and prosecute 
                    Mr. Lobos-- if we can build a 
                      compelling case against him.

                                    FRANKIE
                    We can t touch him unless we know 
                    we can put him in jail.

                                  ANGELA
                    Who can give us the names, places 
                    and dates to convict Lobos? His New 
                    York distributor. Unfortunately, we 
                    have no idea who that is.

                            (distributes a document)
                    We do have a profile of the type of 
                    criminal we re looking for. He s a 
                      highly-organized individual, with 
                    an established network in place.

      As Angela s briefing continues, we see:

      INT. EAST SIDE TOWNHOUSE - DAY

      Sabueso walks up a staircase to the master bedroom.

                                  ANGELA (V.O.)
                    Lobos s product is high-grade, 
                    extremely potent and expensive. So 
                    this guy has rich customers-- high 
                    net-worth individuals willing to 
                    pay for a pure high.

      He enters to find an orgy in full swing, naked, copulating 
      YOUNG WOMEN as far as the eye can see. An older MAN hands him 
      an envelope stuffed with cash. 

      INT. CHEMICAL BANK - DAY

      Eddie stands at the commercial TELLER, emptying the lockbag.

                                  ANGELA (V.O.)
                    He already knows how to move money 
                    through the system.

      As he hands her the deposit slip for $44,873, signed by 
       Joshua Kantos ...

      INT. GHOST S APARTMENT BUILDING - BASEMENT - DAY

      Tasha teeters on the concrete in her Louboutin boots.

                                  ANGELA (V.O.)
                    Is violent enough to control his 
                      territory...

      Tasha opens her Vuitton bag and pulls out Ghost s bloody 
      tank. She opens the door marked  Incinerator  and puts the 
      shirt inside. As the light of the fire glows on her face --

      INT. GHOST S PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

      A beautiful room. The family all together, hanging out.

                                  ANGELA (V.O.)
                    ...but still has something to lose. 
                    Something Lobos can threaten to 
                    keep him in line.                                                                                    65.


      Tariq fires up his iPad and sticks in his headphones, while 
      Raina does homework and Estelle plays with baby Yasmine.

                                  ANGELA (V.O.)
                    So why is Lobos looking to replace 
                    him? What could have gone wrong? 
                    There must be some element out of 
                    his control.

      INT. LOWER EAST SIDE LOFT - DAY

      Liliana gets on a large freight elevator. She checks her pack-
      - full of cash-- and sends Julio a text: I m coming in. The 
      elevator stops and a young COUPLE gets on, holding hands and 
      making out. Liliana smiles at them, but then notices a tattoo 
      on the GUY S hand. She moves to get off before the doors 
      close, but the GIRL yanks her back, grabbing at her pack!!!

      Liliana grabs her weapon, and pulls the trigger, but it JAMS! 
      What the fuck? Liliana thinks fast and pistol-whips the girl, 
      but the guy s on her in a FLASH--

      INT. TRUTH - DAY

      Ghost enters the empty club space, cleaned and decorated for 
      that night. He begins to climb the stairs to the top of VIP.

                                  ANGELA (V.O.)
                    Whatever the reason, this problem 
                    between Lobos and his local guy is 
                    exactly what we need to exploit.

      Ghost reaches the top and looks down, over his domain. 

                                  ANGELA (V.O.)
                    Because the man we re looking for 
                    is in grave danger. From Lobos and 
                    from us. We can give him a way out, 
                    but only if he decides to take it.

      He feels weight in his pocket and pulls out his gun-- which 
      he almost used on Kantos. He considers the gun for a second 
      as he stands in the middle of his legit dream, torn between 
      his two worlds. His phone RINGS. We re TIGHT on his face as 
      he answers:

                                  GHOST
                    Ed. What s up?
                          (then)
                    I m on my way.
