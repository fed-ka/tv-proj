A Woman's house. Books and art collected over years.
Interesting, unexpected pieces of furniture. Jane kicks off
her heels, now feeling short and alone. Deep breath!

Cramped, but clearly a cook's kitchen.
The Kids have left a
few glasses and plates on the island.
9.
Jane gathers them and as she rinses them at the sink, she
suddenly and surprisingly feels very alone. She pauses,
allows herself the moment, then forces herself to snap out of
it.

This is Jane's other home. A large, bright, bustling
BAKERY/RESTAURANT. The bakery counter could rival any in
Paris. Last year, The New York Times rated Jane's pain au
chocolat the best in the United States. A line waits to get
in.
A very relaxed Jane is behind the busy counter, easily moving
between her young staff. The atmosphere is efficient and
friendly.
Jane adjusts a few signs on the counter, then reaches inside
the display case, pulling out a tray of muffins topped with
powdered sugar. She carries the tray to the open pass-
through to the BUSY KITCHEN and calls to the head Baker.
JANE
Reynaldo...
(nods to the muffins)
REYNALDO
Too much sugar.
JANE
Little bit.
Reynaldo nods as Jane hands him the tray.
Jane notices a line waiting to get up to the bakery counter.
Knowing what to do, Jane's staff has already set out cups of
coffee with lids.
JANE
Who wants coffee while they're
waiting?
Jane and the staff hand out the free coffee.
JANE WALKS THE COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER
refills a glass of water, checking on her customers.
JANE
(quietly to a Young
Employee)
Check on table five, will you?
10.
The Young Employee nods as Jane looks up and sees a MAN on
the other side of the counter. They exchange polite hellos
when Jane notices PETER, tan and confident, approaching her.
JANE
(all smiles)
Peter!
PETER joins ADAM, the man who stands across from Jane. Adam
is handsome in a way that sneaks up on you. There's
something reserved and refreshing about his demeanor. He
holds rolled blueprints.
PETER
Jane, I can't remember, have you
ever met Adam Schaeffer?
JANE
ADAM
No.
Yes.
ADAM
Well....
(shrugs awkwardly )
PETER
Look what we've got.
ADAM
(raises the blueprints)
Your plans.
JANE
(to Peter)
So excited!

A farmhouse table almost fills the room. On the walls,
posters for Jane's two cookbooks, framed food photos and a
few reviews.
Jane, Peter, and Adam sit around the table as Adam rolls out
the blueprints in front of Jane.
JANE
(before she looks)
I've been thinking about this
addition for ten years.
Peter and Adam watch as Jane's eagle eye examines the plan.
11.
JANE
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, niiice....I
like this wall of windows, Peter.
PETER
That was Adam actually.
JANE
Oh.
(still perusing, then to
Peter)
Love where you put the stairs.
That's so good!
PETER
Adam's idea...
Did she hear that?
JANE
Oh my God, the kitchen! Finally -
I have a real kitchen with four
walls... It's...oh, wow...you
actually understood what I wanted!
Jane looks to Peter with enormous appreciation.
Peter looks
to Adam.
PETER
All Adam.
Jane turns to Adam.
ADAM
I'm happy you like it.
JANE
(finally noticing him)
Okay. Hi.
(shakes his hand)
ADAM
(laughs)
Hello.
JANE
You read all my e-mails.
ADAM
All 47 of them.
12.
Jane smiles as her Office Manager sticks her head in the
door.
OFFICE MANAGER
Jane, it's 10:15.
JANE
It is?
(rises)
Oh, sorry, I have a 10:30...
dentist. Can you leave these and
I'll make a few notes? Well,
actually, I have one tiny note now.
(to Adam, re: plan)
In my bathroom...um...no his and
her sinks.
ADAM
Okay, sure. No his?
JANE
Just hers.
ADAM
And you don't think in the future
you might want a his?
JANE
Oh, God, we're talking code about
my life, right?
ADAM
(laughs)
No, no, didn't mean to be.
JANE
The truth is, in my current
bathroom, I have two sinks and
sometimes the other sink makes me
feel bad.
ADAM
One sink. Not a problem. Can we
schedule a meeting for next week?
Does Tuesday work for you?
JANE
Tuesday's great. Eight-thirty too
early? At the house?
ADAM
I'll be there.

Way too chic for a dentist's office. Jane sits nervously in
a chair in a well styled, well upholstered examination room.
The door opens quickly and a handsome, crisp looking DOCTOR
ENTERS.
JANE
Hi.
DOCTOR
Hi. I'm Dr. Moss.
JANE
(shaking his hand)
Hi. Jane Adler. So, I just wanted
to start with... and please don't
take this the wrong way but I'm the
type of person who kind of makes
fun of people who get plastic
surgery.
DR. MOSS
I understand.
JANE
You do? Good, because, you know,
some women can look a little fake
and plasticky. And in my opinion --
worse.
DR. MOSS
I agree.
JANE
Oh, that's good, so, well, as
against the whole thing as I am, I
do have a problem that's been
bugging me. My left eyelid is
really saggy. I find I'm sometimes
holding it up when I'm watching TV
or reading and I was wondering if
that's something you could fix.
DR. MOSS
(looking at her closely)
It's resting on your eye lashes.
JANE
Is it?
14.
DR. MOSS
(measures her lids with a
very tiny ruler)
Actually you have the same amount
of excess skin on both sides.
JANE
I do? Well, I'm only interested in
fixing one eye.
DR. MOSS
Jane, what you need to fix this is
a brow lift.
JANE
A brow lift? Wh-what is that
exactly?
DR. MOSS
We surgically cut at your hair
line. Incision goes right across
here.
(demonstrates on himself
by indicating a line
drawn like a headband)
Then we just lift the skin up a
little tighter across the skull.
(Jane nods, already hating
this)
We staple it back in place right
above your ears. Recovery isn't
all that bad but you could be
fairly numb and you'll probably
have a headache that lasts anywhere
from say 3 to 6 months.

Jane flies into the elevator, out of breath and a little
nauseous. She taps on the Lobby button.
The elevator moves
down. PING. The DOORS OPEN and Jane looks into an empty
hallway, facing a SIGN that reads, Santa Barbara Fertility
Center. Helping Couples Become Parents.
Jane hears someone is about to get on the elevator, steps
back toward the corner. A messy looking 5 YEAR OLD BOY
dashes in. Jane recognizes him. She looks up and Jake and
his wife, Agness, in oversized dark shades and a long black
dress (very Angelina Jolie) get on the elevator, obviously
mid-argument.
15.
Agness' mood seems very dark today. They instantly shut up
when they realize Jane is in the elevator.
AGNESS
Jane!
JANE
-- Hey..
JAKE
Hiii.
JANE
Hello.
AGNESS
(pushing the Lobby button,
mumbles)
-- Perfect.
PEDRO
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake. Jake.
JAKE
Hold on Pedro, I'm talking to
someone.
Pedro sits on the floor, crashing into the back wall of the
elevator.
AGNESS
Pedro, up! Now!!
(she snaps)
Jane unconsciously holds up her left eyebrow.
JAKE
What are you doing in this
building?
JANE
Dentist.
JAKE
You don't go to Sharon anymore?
JANE
Uh, no... changed.
Jane looks at the fertility literature in Jake's hand just as
Jake slips it behind his back. An awful two seconds of
silence, then Jane notices a tattoo of a tiger on Agness'
back. It creeps her out.
16.
Jake catches Jane's reaction, then thank God the doors open.
Jake leans down and picks up Pedro who instantly climbs up
his back.
JAKE
Honey, don't do that..
11
As they all EXIT THE ELEVATOR, Pedro has now made his way up
11
to Jake's shoulders. Think chimpanzee. Agness' cell RINGS
and as she answers it --
JANE
-- See you in the Big Apple.
Pedro is now resting on Jake's head.
JAKE
(trying to be nonchalant
with a kid on his head,
smiles)
See you there.

Jane and THREE OF HER GIRLFRIENDS are mid-meal. The wine is
flowing and the women are laughing. TRISHA has happily never
been married. JOANNE is widowed and DIANE is divorced. They
are all Jane's age and have been friends forever.
TRISHA
That is beyond....
JANE
(laughing)
-- When the three of them got in
the elevator... between that and
the staples and the headache for
six months... it was the most
insane hour of my life.
DIANE
-- Jake has lost his mind.
JANE
Oh, I don't know...
DIANE
I know. First of all, he was a
complete prick for cheating on you.
JANE
Well, can't disagree with that.
17.
DIANE
And then he marries her... a known
lunatic.
JANE
She has a big job.
TRISHA
Why do you always say that?
JANE
Because she does. She runs the
whole marketing department at KY,
whatever that station's called so
she's not that big of a lunatic.
DIANE
Janey, come on, he cheats on you
with her, your 20 year marriage
ends then six months later she
leaves Jake for some random guy,
has a baby, leaves that guy,
marries Jake and she's not nuts?
JANE
(groans)
Jo, you're so lucky Jerry's dead.
JOANNE
Oh, thanks.
JANE
No, I mean, you never have to bump
into him.
JOANNE
That's true.
TRISHA
(rises to get more wine)
Janey, you want to meet a guy I met
on Match.com that I didn't like?
JANE
Gee, what a great offer.
I don't
think so.
TRISHA
He wasn't that awful.
JANE
Oooo. Sounding better every minute.
18.
Trisha stops at Jane's seat, refilling Jane's wine glass.
TRISHA
You know it's not healthy not to
have sex for...however long it's
been...
JANE
Trust me... I'm not not doing it on
purpose.
DIANE
Okay. I don't know if this is true,
but I read on line about this woman
who hadn't done it in so long her
vagina closed up.
JANE
What!!!
Get out of here.
All the Women SCREAM.
DIANE
I swear to God. It grew back
together.
JOANNE
Wait. Was it ever one piece?
DIANE
All I know is, she had to have a
vaginaplasty.
TRISHA
Ouch!!!!
JANE
Oh my Goddddddd.
Jane flops over on the table, laughing, resting her head.
JANE
(lifts her head, then
talks as if she's in the
doctor's office)
"Dr. Moss, Hi. I have a little
situation that needs fixing...."
TRISHA
Bubbee, you want to fix your
situation? Just date someone.
Seriously. Anyone.
19.
As Jane takes that in, we:
CUT TO:

A17
They all cross THROUGH THE LOBBY toward the RECEPTION DESK.
HARLEY
So, what's up Luke?
Did you decide
to have the party?
LUKE
Oh, yeah.
Big time.
JANE
What party?
LUKE
Are you guys gonna sleep over?
LAUREN
If you give us your bed and change
the sheets.
They arrive at THE RECEPTION DESK.
JANE
You're having a party? When?
(to Reception Clerk)
Hi. Adler. Two rooms...hopefully
next to each other.
20.
RECEPTION CLERK
I have an Adler, J. in a Superior
Suite, Park Avenue view. Oh, I'm
sorry, here it is. Adler J -- two
Standard Doubles. Sorry about
that.
JANE
Yeah, we're not the ones in the
Superior Suite. Have the other
Adlers checked in yet? Just
wondering.
RECEPTION CLERK
No, they haven't, ma'am. Not yet.
Now I just need a credit card and
your signature.
As Jane takes out her credit card...
LUKE
-- Mom, is it okay if the girls
come with me now and help me set
up?
HARLEY
And by girls he means the three of
us.
JANE
Wait. Hold on. Set up what? I have
reservations for all of us for
dinner. That's not happening now?
LUKE
I don't know. Me and my friends
are having this huge thing at our
apartment and the girls said they'd
help us set up..
(sees her disappointment)
We're going to be together all day
tomorrow.
GABBY
-- Mom, it's his last night before
graduation.
JANE
Okay, okay.
Do you want me to
help or...
21.
LUKE
(super sweetly)
-- Love your credit card....
17

Jane rides the elevator carrying both girls' jackets and
carry ons as well as her own. Just as the doors are about to
close, a Good Looking Couple in their early forties gets on.
As they go up. The Guy has his hand around the woman's
waist, his fingers fanning her butt. The Couple looks at
each other, smiling privately. Jane looks away.
18

Two double beds. Jane lies on top of one of the beds, fully
dressed, shoes off, eyes wide open.

Jane ENTERS the hotel's posh bar/restaurant.
JANE
(to Host)
Hi. Adler. One.
HOST
Hi. Your table's almost ready Mrs.
Adler. Would you like to wait at
the bar?
JANE
(trying to read upside
down reservation list)
Sure. You don't happen to have
another Adler coming in, do you?
Adler for two?
HOST
(perusing)
No... You're our only Adler this
evening.
JANE
(relieved)
Thanks.
ANGLE - THE BAR
Jane takes a seat next to Two Hot Younger Women.
22.
JANE
(to Bartender)
Pinot Noir, please. No, you know
what? I'll have a Tanqueray Martini
very dry with a twist.
Jane strums the bar top, checks out the room. It's fun being
in a big city. Her martini arrives, she takes a sip and
HEARS something very familiar. Jake's laugh. She looks
across the bar and sees Jake talking to the bartender. He
seems to be alone. Jane waves. Jake notices her and smiles.
JANE
Where's your....??
Jake picks up his drink and carries it to the bar stool next
to Jane.
JAKE
Pedro got the stomach flu so I'm
flying solo.
JANE
Really? Didn't know you knew how
to be by yourself.
JAKE
Any chance you could just go easy
on me? Just a one night free pass.
(noticing her)
You look good, Janey.
JANE
Yeah....
JAKE
You do. You always do.
Your
hair's shorter.
JANE
Longer.
JAKE
I like it.
The Host joins them.
HOST
Mrs. Adler, your table's ready.
JAKE
Want some company, Mrs. Adler?
23.
Jane gives Jake a doubtful look.
JAKE
-- We both have to eat.
(sees Jane is hesitating)
When's the last time we ate a meal
together?
JANE
(thinks for a sec)
Just the two of us? Alone?
1999.
JAKE
So, come on. Once every ten years.
21
A HALF HOUR LATER
21
New drinks arrive for Jane and Jake. Physically, they're
sitting as close as they've been in a decade.
JANE
So...how are things in the
fertility world?
JAKE
(checks watch)
I can't believe it took you this
long to bring that up.
JANE
(trying not to laugh)
Sperm issues?
JAKE
Apparently. Yes.
JANE
A baby?! Really Jake? So...the
next time you go to a graduation,
you'll be what? Fifty-eight plus...
(tries to do the math)
JAKE
-- I think the number you're
looking for is 79.
JANE
Okay.
So. Seriously, how is that
good?
JAKE
Why are we talking about this? I
thought we were going to have fun.
24.
JANE
Where'd you get that idea?
22
A BOTTLE OF WINE IS OPENED
22
and poured. The bar has filled up and Jane and Jake are
sitting a little closer together.
JAKE
-- Just tell me, how long were you
seeing him for?
JANE
Oh, please, it was five years ago.
JAKE
I know but I always wondered so...
JANE
Little jealous?
JAKE
Yes.
JANE
The man's married now.
JAKE
I don't care. How long?
JANE
Eight months.
JAKE
(surprised)
Long....
JANE
Not long.

LATER

The bar is now crowded. Jane and Jake are finally eating but
still drinking. Jake is telling Jane a long story and she
can't stop laughing.

24
BRANDY TIME
24
A DJ spins for the after dinner crowd. Couples dance on the
dance floor. Jane and Jake both react to the song.
25.
JAKE
This song reminds me of your
birthday party... the one in our
old house...
JANE
-- Oh, yeah. That was such a fun
night.
JAKE
So fun. You wore that white halter
dress....
JANE
(remembering)
Oh, yeahhhh....
(remembering it all, looks
at Jake with a longing
for her own past...)
JAKE
Want to dance?
JANE
-- No...!
25
THE DANCE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
25
Jake and Jane are dancing...it's familiar yet with the blush
of the new. Something's going on here. Jake starts singing.
Jane joins in. This is by far, the loosest we've seen her.
Of course, it helps that she's drunk. They dance around one
another without inhibition. A mating dance....
JANE
(astonished, laughing)
You're married to someone else...!
JAKE
Tell me about it!
They both laugh then Jake pulls Jane close.
JANE
(sexy....)
Hey.... I know you.
26.
JAKE
(looking deeply into her)
And I know you....
CUT TO:
26
26
They're in bed and they've done it. They're not even
entirely undressed. They're spent, sweaty, breathing
heavily. Jake cups his hand on Jane's vagina, gives it a
solid pat and hold.
JAKE
Home sweet home.
JANE
Oh......God.........
Jane covers her face.
JAKE
That was one crazy ride...thought
we were going to break the bed.
JANE
(not looking good)
-- I'm having an out of body
experience.
JAKE
Totally. You're so great, Janey. I
forgot how great. Holy shit.
JANE
Please shut up.
I'm so dizzy.
JAKE
And the pilates are payin' off by
the way.
Jane moans, OPENS THE NIGHT TABLE DRAWER, leans over and
throws up into it.
JAKE
Oh no!
Jane woozily sits up on her side of the bed, her back to
Jake. Jake looks over at her.
JAKE
You okay?
27.
JANE
(starting to rise)
Look the other way.
JAKE
Why?
JANE
`Cause I have to get up.
JAKE
Jane...I know what you...
JANE
Look the other way Jake!!!
As Jake turns away, Jane runs to the bathroom, carrying a
pillow covering her bare ass. Jake hears her throw up again.
He winces.
27
27
Jane sits on the floor, by the toilet, looking wiped out.
Jake gingerly steps into the bathroom, hair a mess, wearing
boxer shorts and his unbuttoned shirt.
JANE
(looking up at him)
WHAT is wrong with us?
JAKE
What do you mean? This was
amazing. We just had a great time.
JANE
A great time? This is the dumbest
thing two people have ever done.
(giant moan.... )
Jake sits on the edge of the tub.
This is news to him.
JAKE
Really? I don't know.... I haven't
thought it out, but off the top of
my head I'd say it was smokin' hot
so something about it wasn't so
dumb.
(she stares up at him,
sick as a dog)
And, FYI, I like that you stopped
getting bikini waxes. You've gone
native. I was into it.
28.
Horrified, Jane lets out a yelp on her way to throwing up
again.
28
30
The Family celebrates over lunch. Luke is telling a funny
story about something that happened on stage at graduation.
Jane is the only one not fully chiming in and laughing. She
can't seem to move beyond what happened last night.
LAUREN
(sotto)
You okay?
JANE
Yeah.
Totally.
UNDER THE TABLE
Jake slips off his shoe and rubs his foot up Jane's leg and
under her skirt.
BACK TO SCENE
Jane jumps, quickly turning it into a reaction to Luke's
story. She gives Jake a private stare that says, "stop or
I'll kill you."
29.
JAKE
I would like to propose a toast to
your Mother.
JANE
(what???)
To me?
JAKE
I've done my part with you guys,
but Jane... you -- very talented
you...
GABBY
Oh, God...
JAKE
Gabby, I'm serious. Jane, you did
a magnificent job, as you always
do...
The Kids look at one another...what's this about?
JAKE
When I look at the three of you
beautiful kids...all grown up, I
think of all the work your mother
did, much of it without my help...
(starts to well up)
LUKE
Dude...pull it together.
JAKE
-- Janey, I take my hat off to you.
JANE
Okay, Jake. Thank you.
Out of nowhere, sudden
appreciation. But thank you.
Really.
JAKE
Not totally out of nowhere,
Jane...if you know what I mean.
JANE
(quickly)
Which I don't...but...
LAUREN
What's he...?
30.
JANE
-- Have no idea. Let's move on,
shall we?
Jane holds up her droopy left eye.
GABBY
I'd like to say something too. For
real. No offense to the lovely
Agness or her charming offspring...
(the Kids stifle laughs)
JAKE
-- Not nice.
Harley stops laughing.
GABBY
I know. I'm sorry. But I just want
to say I really loved today, just
being with the original five...
(Luke nods in agreement)
-- plus Harley, but he's like one
of us. I don't think we've ever
done this before... Had a meal
together. And hung out like
this...
LAUREN
You mean other than the first 13
years of your life.
LUKE
I know what's she saying. It's been
awesome....just for a whole day to
be just... us.
They all reflect on that one.
31
31
The Adlers are at the Reception Desk. Jane and Jake are next
to each other, signing their credit card receipts, the Kids
chat behind them.
JAKE
(to Jane)
Something feels right in the
universe again, doesn't it?
Jane looks at him but doesn't answer.
She turns to the Kids.
31.
JANE
So who's coming home when?
No
one's told me the details.
Jake's CELL RINGS. Jane half listens to his conversation.
JAKE
(into cell)
Hey.
(turns away)
How's Pedro feeling?
Distracted, Jane focuses on Lauren.
LAUREN
(responding to "Pedro")
Okay, we're gonna help pack Luke
up, the three of us leave day after
tomorrow and Luke's home the end of
the week.
JAKE
(rejoins, finishing his
call)
-- I will. Call you when I land.
(slips cell away, not
missing a beat)
Janey, what flight are you on?
JANE
I'm on the uh, the four o'clock.
JAKE
Ah, too bad. I'm on the five
o'clock.
LUKE
That's nuts, why don't you try to
get on the same flight?
JAKE
Yeah, I could try.
JANE
It's been...great, but let's not
... push it.
LAUREN
He was just trying to be nice.
JANE
I know. Okay, I've got to hit the
road, guys.
(MORE)
32.
JANE(cont'd)
(kisses each kid as they
line up)
Thanks for staying. So proud of
you. Be good. Call me if you need
me.
(she arrives at Jake,
pauses, speechless)
JAKE
(kisses her cheek)
It was really fun.
JANE
(painfully)
It was.

ADAM'S POV - JANE
jogging right past his car, listening to her iPod.
ADAM
Jane!
She doesn't hear him. Adam backs up next to her. Jane slows
down. Adam lowers the passenger window. She looks in,
doesn't recognize him at first.
ADAM
It's Adam...
JANE
It's 8:30 Tuesday morning!
ADAM
Are we still okay?
JANE
Yes! Totally forgot! I'm so
sorry! Can you give me a lift back
to the house?
ADAM
(quickly cleaning up the
front seat)
Sure...come on in.
Jane GETS INTO THE CAR just in time to hear:

ADAM
Yeah.

Two and a half years ago.
JANE
Wooo.
ADAM
(embarrassed)
It's been a process.
JANE
Here's the good news. In two more

normal again.
ADAM
In two more years I'll begin to
feel normal? Why am I having

JANE
Maybe that was just my experience.
ADAM
Oh God, I hope so.

Jane moves nervously around the kitchen, opening the fridge,
taking out juice...
37.
JAKE
Why haven't you returned any of my
calls or e-mails?
JANE
Jake, come on. This is just too
weird. We have to just never do
what we did - ever again. You're
an adulterer and I'm an awful
person, basically. I haven't slept
in days. What we did was just so
wrong on so many levels.
JAKE
And it was so right on a couple of
levels too. Admit it.
JANE
(finally settles)
No! It wasn't! On no levels was
it right!
JAKE
You can't say we didn't enjoy each
other's company. Sitting at the
bar, dancing...after dancing...
(she doesn't want to be
reminded)
Come on, you and I haven't had fun
like that in a hundred years.
JANE
Yes! Because we're not supposed to
have fun like that! We're
divorced!
Are you like, what?
Unhappy at home?
Does she not
"understand" you? Did you just
want to know what it would be like
with someone my age? What is this?
JAKE
I'd be lying if I said I never
think about you, Janey. I think
about you. A lot. And no, it's not
perfect at home. Obviously. Look
at me. I've got three grown kids
and I'm going to kindergarten
interviews. I'm a walking cliche.
Jane shrugs.
She agrees.
38.
JAKE
And I can't, literally can't stop
thinking about what happened in New
York. Fate brought us together
once, maybe it happened again.
(she pauses...)
And I know... you've moved on with
your life, I get it, but you can't
deny something real and honest
happened that night. Can't we just
go with it, see where it takes us.
No one has to know.
(Jane shudders)
You were so great. So loose and
sexy. How often do you get to be
like that?
You can run and open
restaurants and build your perfect
kitchen but what about having
someone to hold you in the middle
of the night...?
JANE
Not high on my list these days.
JAKE
But what if that someone is someone
who's known you since you're 23 and
loved you for most of your life.
JANE
I forgot what a good lawyer you
are.
JAKE
Give this a shot, Janey.... Life is
short and it's tough. Don't
discount what we have with each
other.
(he's getting to her)
You know what they say... people in
nursing homes who have plants live
longer than the people without
plants.
JANE
Oh, so you're saying you think this
is a healthy choice for me?
JAKE
Honey, I know it is.
39.
37
38
Jane and Jake have done it again. In broad daylight and
sober. They catch their breath.
JANE
Oh, God, it's official.
We're
having an affair.
JAKE
Why do you need to label
everything?
JANE
Because that's what this is.
JAKE
Yes, in its crassest form, maybe,
if we were two other people.
JANE
Just because we were married for 19
years does not not make this an
affair.
JAKE
Okay, but since we were together
for so long, it's not really that
wrong.
JANE
Really? You want to run that logic
by your wife?
Jane fans herself.
JANE
Do me a favor, you're on my side.
Can we switch? I feel disoriented.
JAKE
Since when is this your side?
JANE
Since ten years ago.
Please...
40.
They switch sides. In the middle of this maneuver Jake lands
on top of Jane. He pauses.
JAKE
Could I interest you in a little...
JANE
No!
They flop onto the opposite sides of the bed.
Jane fans
herself. So hot.
JAKE
(turns to her)
Why do you think the sex is so much
sexier this time?
JANE
I don't know.
Jane pulls the sheet up.
They look at one another. He gets
her to smile.
JANE
I've gotta get to work.
JAKE
Me too. Okay...
(moans as he sits up, then
rises)
Jake starts to get dressed. Jane watches him from bed,
checking out his stomach. He notices.
JAKE
(indicating his belly)
See what happens when you're not
looking out for me.
(pats it)
She lets me eat everything.. pasta,
cream cheese...
JANE
Can you hand me my robe?
Jake reaches for Jane's robe, hands it to her.
She indicates
Jake should turn around.
JAKE
Why do I have to..?
41.
JANE
-- Because the last time you saw me
standing up naked I was in my
forties.
(Jake can't believe this)
Things look different lying down.
Just...
Jake rolls his eyes, turning away from her.
JAKE
You've gotten a little nuts.
JANE
(slipping into her robe)
Jake, I think it would be really
good for us to not talk for a few
days. Okay?
JAKE
(turning back to her)
You know what I think -- just for
the record? I think we're doing
something kinda brilliant. All the
things that tore us apart aren't
issues anymore. I'd say our
problems actually went away.
JANE
What..?
JAKE
Didn't you always say you felt you
weren't being heard? Wasn't that
our big issue -- both of us always
feeling rejected and unappreciated.
Look at us now. You're so much
more together, you're not exhausted
all the time, you're not catering
every weekend and busy all day with
the kids and I'm calmer, less
obsessed about work. I'm a partner.
I'm there. We grew into the people
we wanted each other to be! And I
don't know... I appreciate things
about you I couldn't even see
before.
JANE
(not wanting to get into
it)
Really?
(MORE)
42.
JANE(cont'd)
Well, you know, I'm not as good as
you at remembering all the details
of our...
JAKE
(getting dressed)
-- Do you remember never having
time for sex? Now look at us.
We've already done it two times
this week and it's only Tuesday. I
swear to God, if half the couples
who got divorced, could get back
together 10 years later, their
problems would be solved. I think
we're on to something.
JANE
Not sure I agree and...also, we're
not back together.
JAKE
And I know other divorced people
think about this...they wonder -
what if....
(fixes his tie)
I think this is very French of us.
JANE
How is this French of us?
JAKE
I have a young wife but I'm having
sex with my old wife. Not old, you
know. Ex!
(Jane nods....)
I didn't mean old...
39
Jane tosses Jake his jacket. They EXIT the BEDROOM and head
39
toward THE FRONT DOOR.
JAKE
You're doing that thing where you
act like you're not listening...
but think about what I'm saying,
okay?
(then)
Do you have any of your homemade
granola here? I haven't had it in
so long.
JANE
You miss it?
43.
JAKE
So much.
JANE
We sell it for $6.50 a bag at the
store.
JAKE
Yeah, why give it away when you
can...
(Jane OPENS the front door
and moves him outside)
Kiss good bye?
Jane kisses him on the cheek.
JAKE
She wants to be courted!
(as he heads for his car)
I can do that!
(turns back)
And honey, thanks for the....
(indicates sex with his
fingers)
-- Coffee....
Jane can't close the door fast enough.
40
40
Jane carries three beautiful homemade pies, arriving in THE
LIVING ROOM where her Friends are gathered. Platters of food
and open bottles of wine are on the coffee table.
TRISHA
Oh my God, now what?
Three pies?!
This is a feast!
JANE
I don't know what's going on, I
have so much energy lately which I
think is probably a result of...
all the sex I'm having.
(the Ladies LAUGH)
Yeah. I'm actually not kidding.
I'm having an affair.
(They stare at her)
With a married man.
44.
DIANE
What? When did this happen?
Where'd you meet him?
JANE
Well, it... started in New York.
DIANE
In New York??? Last week?
JANE
Yeah, we did it once there and once
here. Maybe more than once there,
I was drunk so...
TRISHA
You had drunken sex with a married
man in New York when you went for
Luke's graduation?
JANE
(laughs, embarrassed)
Turns out I'm a bit of a slut.
(re: pies)
Apple, Blueberry or Plum?
DIANE
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on....
You're not saying!!!!
JOANNE
(clueless)
-- What?
TRISHA
(catching on)
No! You're not!
JANE
Oh, God, but I am. I'm having an
affair with Agness Adler's husband.
The Women all SCREAM as Jane fans herself.
TRISHA
That. Is. Genius!
JOANNE
But also sort of wrong.
JANE
I know.
45.
DIANE
Oh, please. Not that wrong.
JANE
I know! I'm so happy to be able to
tell someone. This is the most out
of control thing I've ever done.
Literally. You know me.
DIANE
Yes we do. You don't do anything
wrong, or bad. Ever. So you're
allowed this one. I'm sorry ... I
kinda love it.
JOANNE
He was yours first.
JANE
True. Not that I want him back by
the way.
TRISHA
Of course not. You can do better
than Jake.
JANE
(a little insulted)
Thanks.
TRISHA
I mean you've outgrown him. You've
blossomed, you feng shuied your
whole life... Just please, don't
let him talk you into saving him.
JANE
I won't...
(wonders what that means)
DIANE
There is something kinda perfect
about this. You don't have to cook
for him or clean up after him or
actually even sleep with him....
JANE
Yeah, I have an Ex with benefits...
46.
JANE (CONT'D)
But, girls, what about the fact
that I'm now the other woman? I'm
the one we hate.
TRISHA
Oh, forget that.
Agness is still
the one we hate.
Even in this
scenario.
DIANE
Yeah, karma is the ultimate bitch
on this one.
41
41
Jane walks through the busy kitchen holding a sheet of paper.
Her shirt is a little more fitted. Her make up, a little
prettier. She crosses to the head Baker who's just taking a
tray of cookies out of the oven.
JANE
Reynaldo, I'm changing the
breakfast menu, want to give it a
little more life...
(shows it to him, he seems
distracted)
What do you think?
REYNALDO
(distracted)
-- What'd you do? Something to
your hair?
JANE
I don't think so.
REYNALDO
Something about you looks
different. Little more "caliente."
JANE
Caliente?
Another Chef in the kitchen nods in agreement.
REYNALDO
You see it Eddie?
EDDIE
Whatever it is, it's workin'.
47.
He winks at Jane as he stirs cookie batter.
Jane blushes as
her cell phone rings.
JANE
Hello.
(listens)
No! I didn't do this again!
42
44
Water is running in the sink, even though no one's at the
sink. Jake is in the shower stall, fully dressed, putting
away his cell. He quietly pushes the shower door open and
then carefully shuts it with a small snap. Jake fake coughs
and then turns off the sink water. He checks his watch when
he hears GLASS BREAKING in another room then hears Agness
calling his name in anger. He leaps.
49.
JAKE
Coming!
Jake quietly UNLOCKS THE BATHROOM DOOR and EXITS to find his
path is blocked by Pedro who sits on a tricycle staring up at
him.
PEDRO
What were you doing in there?
JAKE
Going to the bathroom.
PEDRO
The toilet didn't flush.
JAKE
Yes it did.
PEDRO
Why were you in the shower with
your clothes on?
JAKE
(making sure Agness
doesn't hear)
What are you talking about?
PEDRO
I heard the shower door close.
JAKE
What do you have, x-ray ears?
Agness joins in briefs and a white tank, black bra peeking
through. She holds a broom.
AGNESS
What's up Pedro?
PEDRO
Jake took a shower with his clothes
on.
JAKE
Pedro!
Darling...
AGNESS
What's he talking about?
JAKE
I don't speak Pedro.
That's your
department.
50.
AGNESS
(to Pedro)
Don't go in the kitchen, P, I broke
something.
(to Jake, annoyed)
Yo. Can you help?
Agness EXITS back to the kitchen as Pedro stares at Jake.
CUT TO:
45
TWO GORGEOUS CROQUE-MONSIEURS - COMING OUT OF AN OVEN
45
These open-faced fancy French Grilled Cheese Sandwiches are
carried to Jane's counter. We're:
Jane very professionally places the Croque-Monsieurs onto two
waiting plates, adds some salad on the side. Adam stands
nearby with a glass of wine, jacket off.
ADAM
That looks amazing.
JANE
It's called a croque-monsieur. It's
one of the first things I learned
to make when I lived in Paris
because the ingredients are really
really cheap.
ADAM
When did you live in Paris?
JANE
In my early twenties. I went there
to take a six day pastry class and
ended up staying a year working as
an apprentice in a bakery.
Jane places the plates AT THE ISLAND as she and Adam SIT SIDE
BY SIDE. Jane raises her wine glass.
JANE
Thank you for taking my 47 e-mails
and turning them into something so
beautiful.
51.
ADAM
You are rapidly becoming one of the
most appreciative clients I've ever
had...
JANE
Well, I'm not all that used to
being able to count on anyone...
ADAM
(surprised by that)
Really?
46
JAKE DRIVING - SAME TIME
46
He squints, looking ahead, SEES:
JANE'S HOUSE - ALL LIT UP
And Adam's car parked out front. Jake turns OFF HIS
HEADLIGHTS, slowly pulling around to the side of the house.
47
47
JANE
I know it's none of my business
but... I'm trying to figure out why
someone like you is divorced.
ADAM
And what'd you come up with?
JANE
Something in the you're too nice
department..?
ADAM
Yes, that and my wife fell in love
with my best friend. Ex-best
friend.
JANE
Oh, no!
ADAM
We were all on a biking trip, he
and his wife, me and my
wife...through Tuscany and on the
last day of the trip they announced
they were in love.
52.
JANE
That's awful.
ADAM
Yeah.
Not a great plane ride home.
JANE
I can imagine, sitting there for
eleven hours with your wife who you
know is -- oh, that's rough.
ADAM
Actually they went on to Venice and
I flew back with Carol, his wife.
You can't imagine what it's like to
sit next to someone who's been
crying for ten straight hours.
JANE
I don't blame her.
ADAM
I was talking about me. Anyway,
they're married now and it's
pretty much an ongoing awful thing.
But, you and your ex... When I saw
him stop by for a cup of coffee the
other morning, I thought -- Wow!
That's the way it's supposed to be.
You two seem to have it all figured
out.
JANE
We're not as figured out as you'd
think.
48
51
Jane walks Adam to the door.
He holds rolled blueprints.
ADAM
This was so nice and relaxing and
the lavender ice cream was actually
the best dessert of any sort I've
ever had... like, in my life.
JANE
Aw, thank you. I always make ice
cream when I can't sleep, so I'm
glad someone was here to eat it.
(opens door)
ADAM
(pauses...)
Great getting to know you a little.
JANE
(nods)
It was really fun.
Adam waves, Jane waves. Definitely a little sweet/awkward.
Jane closes her door, starts turning out lights, heading for
the kitchen, when there's a QUICK KNOCK on the FRONT DOOR.
JANE
Woops!
Coming!
Jane quickly returns to the door and opens it to find:
JAKE
leaning in the door frame.
55.
JAKE
O.M.G. I thought he'd never leave.
(entering)
Hello Jane, you look very beautiful
tonight.
He takes her in his arms.
JAKE
Mmmmm. Love when you smell like
butter.
JANE
(easing away)
What are you doing here?
JAKE
Missed you.
JANE
It's nine o'clock. Where does your
wife think you are?
JAKE
At yoga.
Shall we do some
downward facing dog?
JANE
Not tonight big guy.
They CROSS INTO THE KITCHEN. CAMERA TRACKS.
JAKE
Is it really necessary for you to
always say no before you say yes? I
won't think less of you, you know.
JANE
Really, Jake, I'm a little tired, I
was just gonna take a bath.
JAKE
Good. So, we'll just hang out.
(now IN THE KITCHEN, he
SEES the dinner dishes on
the counter)
Ooooo, is that Croque-Monsieur?
Who's plate is this? Yours or his?
JANE
Mine.
56.
JAKE
(eats her leftovers,
savors the taste)
Oh my God, just as I remember it.
JANE
Don't you ever eat at your house?
JAKE
Pedro dictates all meals and he has
a very limited palate.
(sees melted ice cream)
What kind of ice cream is that?
JANE
Lavender Honey.
JAKE
(immediately)
Not sleeping?
JANE
Not at all. You?
JAKE
Never slept better. And my
digestion is finally back on track.
You've turned my world right side
up, Jane. You know what this
means, don't you?
JANE
No...
JAKE
That I've never really known how to
live without you.
52
52
Jane takes a bubble bath. Jake lies on the floor, leaning
against the tub, his back to her, eating a bowl of ice cream.
JAKE
Maybe we should be growing old
together.
JANE
Hate to tell you, big guy, but we
already grew old apart.
57.
JAKE
What's with the `big guy'? Is that
because you think I'm fat or is it
a term of endearment?
JANE
I have no idea why I keep saying
that. I'm sorry. I'll stop.
JAKE
Thank you.
(then)
I love how quiet it is in your
house. I have no quiet in my life.
Ever.
JANE
Yeah, well, you live with a five
year old.
JAKE
Yes...and don't forget Pedro.
Jane splashes him.
JANE
So what does that mean exactly...?
What's going on over there at your
place?
JAKE
My marriage is... not turning out
as I hoped. That's obvious....
Agness started out really looking
up to me... We never used to fight
but now... with the kid....lately
we're all about where he's gonna go
to school and now she says we need
a bigger house, more help. I was
thinking of cutting back at work...
now that's never gonna happen. And
she wants another baby before Pedro
gets too old which I get but since
we're always fighting... oh, God,
listen to me.
JANE
Isn't a baby part of the deal when
you marry a woman that age?
58.
JAKE
Is it? I guess so. She's got me
booked at the fertility center
every other day and she's so amped
up on hormone injections I may need
to find an exorcist if she doesn't
calm down.
(Jane laughs)
I wish it was funny.
(finishes his ice cream)
Incredible ice cream. I'm turning
around...
(as he turns, Jane shrinks
in the tub)
Remember when we used to smoke pot
and eat your ice cream in the hot
tub?
JANE
The "hot tub"... That feels like a
billion years ago.
JAKE
How long has it been since you...
(indicates smoking a
joint)
JANE
Me?
Since before Lauren was born.
JAKE
27 years?!!
JANE
At least.
Jake slips a joint out of his shirt pocket, twirls it.
JANE
Are you kidding me? Put that away!
It's been too long...
JAKE
Exactly.
JANE
I'm not going to....
JAKE
Okay, why don't I leave this with
you... (It's kind of amazing.)
Maybe you'll take a few hits...
(MORE)
59.
JAKE(cont'd)
get your sea legs, then we'll smoke
the rest of it together.
JANE
Maybe....
Jake places the joint in a drawer.
JAKE
So that nerdy architect likes
you...you know that, right?
JANE
He's not nerdy and he definitely
doesn't. We're working together.
JAKE
I was watching when you bent down
to open the oven, his eyes were
glued to your ass.
JANE
(changing the subject)
Hey, will you do me a favor?
53
53
Jake is on a small ladder, changing a light bulb in the
chandelier. Jane, in a robe, stands beneath him.
JAKE
(looking down at her,
smiles)
Tell the truth, Janey is this a
great affair, or what?
JANE
I don't know. It's my first.
JAKE
(climbing down)
We don't even have to have sex and
it's fun.
(arrives next to her)
I wish I could sleep over.
JANE
I gotta tell my shrink about this.
This is a lot to handle. I guess
you should go ... I'm sure yoga's
probably closed by now.
(MORE)
60.
JANE(cont'd)
Oh, you got a little ice cream on
your shirt. Let me get that out.
JAKE
It's okay...
Jake takes Jane in his arms and gives her a deep hug. He
lingers, kissing her neck, smelling her skin. She kisses him
on the cheek. He slides her robe off her shoulder. He
softly caresses her shoulder, kissing it, then makes his way
up her neck.
Jane gives in and kisses Jake fully on the
lips. He pulls her close, her robe falling.
JANE
Wow, wow, wow...what's happening,
Jake?
The Phone RINGS.
Jane pauses.
JAKE
Don't get it.
JANE
I always get it. I have three
kids.
(Jake wishes she wouldn't.
She hesitates, picks it
up)
Hello. Hiii...
(makes an I told you so
face)
You still on the plane? How was
Luke when you left? Oh, that
sounds like fun. Let me know what
I can bring..... No! Don't have
any idea where he is.
(points to Jake)
Okay, honey, talk to you tomorrow.
(hangs up)
Now I'm lying...... Lauren and
Harley are giving Luke a graduation
party this weekend. Sweet, huh?
Jake's CELL PHONE RINGS, sees it's Lauren calling.
JAKE
(into phone)
Hello stranger. Welcome back.
Jane OPENS THE DOOR and Jake darts over for a quick kiss and
then EXITS toward his car. They wave to one another.
61.
JAKE
(into phone)
-- Just getting in my car. This
weekend? Sounds great. Let me
know what I can bring...
Jake looks to Jane. She shakes her head -- he's shameless.
Jake shrugs. Jane watches as Jake drives off, talking on his
cell.
54
55
Jane, Dr. Allen and the Dog walk the corridor.
62.
JANE
(whispering)
So, at this point, I just need some
sound, unbiased guidance. Is
having an affair with you know who
a good thing or a bad thing?
(they stop at Dr. Allen's
office door)
It's a bad thing, right? How could
it be good?
DR. ALLEN
(opening his door)
It's not good. It's not bad.
Oh, man.
Not what she needs to hear.
56
56
Jane sits in a chair across from an empty chair.
Dr. Allen
turns on a few lamps as his dog settles.
DR. ALLEN
You know, things happen in life and
our job is to find out why. What
we have to do is take a real look
at this. Are you ready to do that?
JANE
I am. Definitely. I've made a list
of what this can possibly be
about...at my end. Can I read it
to you?
DR. ALLEN
(taking his seat)
Of course.
JANE
(digging out her
Blackberry)
Thanks. I e-mailed it to myself.
(reads from Blackberry)
Okay. Am I still trying to figure
out why the marriage failed? Do I
want to get back together? Do we
have unfinished business? Is this
about revenge?
Am I just...
lonely? Or, is it my "caretaker"
thing?
(MORE)
63.
JANE(cont'd)
You know, the kids are finally gone
and now all of a sudden Jake's back
and I get to take care of him in
some way...
Dr. Allen nods, impressed with the work she's done.
JANE
And, listen, I get how therapy
works, I do... We look at things,
we examine them, weeks turn into
months, what....? we're going on
eight years, right?.... and I'm
okay with that, I like it... but in
this case, I need to know what you
really think. Like, I'd like you
to say... Don't do this, it's
absolutely wrong or go ahead,
you'll be fine. I actually want to
be told what to do.
DR. ALLEN
What's interesting is I'm already
seeing you open up more than I have
in some time. I'm thinking,
through this affair, you may learn
to view the world in a different
way.
JANE
I'm sorry. I need more concrete.
Are you saying I should keep seeing
him? Because, honestly, if the
guilt and fear could go away, maybe
I could let go a little and figure
this out.
DR. ALLEN
I wouldn't resist looking at this.
JANE
(mulls that over quickly)
Okay... and another way of saying
that is....?
DR. ALLEN
Let go Jane. It can't hurt.
Jane fist pumps in the air.
64.

Jake is in the Waiting Room with several other "Older" Men
all with their much younger Wives.
A Nurse ENTERS, holding
a chart.
NURSE
Jacob Adler?
Jake rises.
One of the younger women whispers...
WOMAN
Have fun...
58
58
The Nurse shows Jake into a windowless room with a sink, a
pleather barcalounger, a TV and a DVD player.
NURSE
Okay, you know the drill. You can
hang your things in the closest,
the remote is on top of the TV and
the materials are in the drawers.
(cleaning the remote with
an anti-bacterial wipe)
Please deposit your specimen in the
cup and I'll see you when you're
done.
She dims the light before leaving.
Jake takes off his jacket, tosses it on the chair, slips off
his shoes, takes off his pants, sits for a sec when his PHONE
RINGS. He looks at the name of the caller. Smiles.
JAKE
Hi.
59
JANE WALKS QUICKLY THROUGH A FARMER'S MARKET ON HER CELL. 59
JANE
(on her cell)
Hey, where are you?
JAKE
At the office.
JANE
Want to grab some lunch?
65.
JAKE
Absolutely. When?
JANE
Can you do it now? I have about an
hour. Thought we could go to The
Stanhope....get room service.
(she's nervous just saying
it)
JAKE
(rising)
Be there in ten!
JANE
See you there, Adler.
JAKE
(hangs up)
She's comin' back!
Jake rushes to put on his pants, catches his foot in the
pant's hem, hops to safety. He reaches for his jacket then
grabs an anti-bacterial wipe, using it to turn the door knob.
60
60
Harley and Lauren are having lunch in the CAFE connected to
the Lobby. Harley has a clear view of the Lobby's Reception
Desk. Lauren has her back to it.
LAUREN
-- Luke's so excited about his
party. We can fit forty people in
our place, can't we?
HARLEY
Sure, if nobody wants to sit
down...
(notices JAKE ENTERING the
hotel)
-- Hey, there's your...
Harley then realizes JAKE IS signing the Register and
CHECKING IN and chokes on his French Fry.
LAUREN
My what...
(starts to turn)
Harley grabs Lauren's face in his hands and kisses her, even
though he's choking. He coughs while kissing her.
66.
LAUREN
Harley!!!
HARLEY
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to spit on
you. I just needed to kiss you.
LAUREN
While you were choking?
HARLEY
It worked.
I'm not choking
anymore.
Harley swallows a cough, reaching for his water, HIS EYES ON
JAKE as Jake is HANDED A ROOM KEY and POINTED TOWARD THE
ELEVATOR. Harley drinks his entire glass of water as he
watches.
LAUREN
(turning)
Who did you just see?
Luckily Jake is now gone.
HARLEY
No one. Thought it was your
cousin...but...
Harley falls silent as he SEES JANE ENTER THE HOTEL AND CROSS
TO THE RECEPTION DESK. After a sec, she's pointed toward the
same elevator.
HARLEY
Ohhhh my sweet Lord....
LAUREN
(looks up from her salad)
Now what?
HARLEY
Honey, I totally forgot I have a
conference call at 1:15, I gotta
get back to the office. Waiter!
Honey, stop eating, get the waiter.
Call the one over there.
(pointing her away from
Jane)
LAUREN
Harley, we can't leave, we're
meeting with the Wedding
Specialist.
67.
HARLEY
(watches as Jake waits for
Jane around the corner)
Yeah, you know what? Today's not a
good idea to do that.
(Sees Jane join Jake, they
step into the elevator
and immediately fall into
each other's arms and
kiss)
Oh my God...!!!
61
61
The curtains are drawn,
the lights are low. Jane, in a hotel
robe, slips a cd in the
cd player and we hear a mellow song,
perfect for love in the
afternoon. The Bathroom Door OPENS
and Jake EXITS, also in
a hotel robe.
Jane stands across the room from him. They smile at one
another. From behind, we see Jane untie her robe, letting it
fall to the floor. Jake looks at her, from head to toe and
back. They smile at one another, then something comes over
Jake. His eyes roll back, his legs give out and he collapses
against the wall.
JANE
Jake!!!
62
62
The Hotel's Wedding Specialist has joined Lauren and Harley's
table. She holds a binder filled with photos. Harley is a
mess, knowing what's going on upstairs.
WEDDING SPECIALIST
I adore October weddings. Let me
show you what we did last October.
She opens her Book of Photos for Lauren. Lauren gasps.
HARLEY
(rising)
Honey, I'm gonna make that phone
call from the...
Lauren and the Wedding Specialist don't look up and don't
hear him. They keep talking to each other.
68.
HARLEY
(nods)
-- Okay. Good. You just keep doing
that and I'll...
They still don't look up. Harley nervously HEADS FOR THE
LOBBY when he spots the HOTEL DOCTOR, bag in hand, arriving
at the Reception Desk.
HOTEL DOC
What's the room number?
RECEPTION CLERK
408. Adler. His wife said he's
conscious now...
HOTEL DOC
(taking off)
On my way.
Harley stops in his tracks, freaking.
Adler???
63
63
Jake is under the covers, in his robe, a blood pressure cuff
around his arm. Jane, still in her robe, paces. The Hotel
Doc sits on a chair next to Jake's side of the bed.
HOTEL DOC
Your blood pressure's good.
JANE
How's his heart?
HOTEL DOC
Do you have a heart condition, Mr.
Adler?
JAKE
No.
And I just had a check up.
JANE
You did?
Oh, that's good.
HOTEL DOC
(listening to his heart)
Deep breath. So, no chest pain?
JAKE
None.
69.
HOTEL DOC
When you got dizzy, did you feel
your heart was beating funny?
JAKE
Yes, but I was admiring my
beautiful...
(indicates Jane)
Jane holds up her weak eyelid.
HOTEL DOC
-- Well that's nice to hear after
all these years...
(winds up his stethoscope)
Did you forget to take any of your
medications today?
JAKE
Took `em all.
HOTEL DOC
What all did you take?
JAKE
Uh....Lipitor, baby aspirin..
(whispers)
Flomax.
JANE
(sitting on the bed)
Flomax?
JAKE
(embarrassed)
Yes, otherwise I pee 40 times a
day.
HOTEL DOC
How long have you been taking the
Flomax?
JAKE
Not that long. And I only take it
sporadically. I have to sneak it
actually.
(explains confidentially)
It reduces semen and that's not
good for my wife right now.
(to Jane)
Sorry.
70.
HOTEL DOC
(looks over at Jane)
Really..?
JANE
Yes, I prefer a lot of semen.
Always have.
(rises)
Okay, well, thank you so much for
coming. Looks like he's gonna live,
so...
HOTEL DOC
(packing up)
Yeah, my guess is Flomax is
probably the culprit here. It can
definitely give you a sudden drop
in blood pressure so I suggest you
stay off it for a few weeks, which
apparently your wife will
appreciate.
(holds in a chuckle)
JANE
Yeah.
Really good for me.
The Doctor snaps his bag shut, rises.
HOTEL DOC
And I suggest you rest quietly for
the rest of the afternoon.
(to Jane)
No hanky panky, Mrs. Adler.
JANE
No chance. I assure you.
64
64
Harley sits on a bench with his head between his legs. Lauren
arrives, joins him on the bench.
LAUREN
Are you acting like this because of
the wedding? Tell me the truth?
HARLEY
(head down)
Not at all. Swear to God.
71.
LAUREN
Because I don't want to be one of
those couples where the guy goes
into a coma the whole time we plan
the wedding. It's not worth it to
me.
Harley looks up, sees the Hotel Doc walk by the Reception
Clerk. The Doc gives her a wink and a "thumbs up" and keeps
on walking.
HARLEY
(deep sigh, rises)
Okay! We're back in business!
65
OPRAH - CLOSE - ON TV
65
In Jane and Jake's room.
REVERSE - JANE AND JAKE
Sitting up in bed, in their robes, watching Oprah and eating
chicken soup on trays. Jake reaches for the salt. Jane
eases it away from him. Jake looks over at Jane, oozing with
love and appreciation.
JAKE
See. Just that move...you have no
idea. Not everyone's like that...
JANE
(mutes Oprah, then:)
Jake, I have a confession to make.
Back when we broke up... I knew it
wasn't all your fault.
JAKE
You mean that?
You've never said
that to me before.
JANE
I know. Because when you cheated,
I didn't have to. But I think in
some way, I gave up on us and I'm
not sure you ever really did.
JAKE
I still haven't.
Jake takes Jane's hand. She looks down at his wedding ring,
then turns her eyes back to Oprah. A beat, then:
72.
JANE
Are you and Agness... still having
sex?
Jake doesn't answer.
Jane turns, looks right at him.
JAKE
Only if she initiates it.
Jane GROANS.
JAKE
I'm trying not to rock the boat at
home until you and I figure this
out.
(sees her reaction)
This is a little trickier at my end
than yours.
JANE
Right. Yeah. Okay....
(rises...)
Now I know you're gonna think I'm
leaving because of what you just
said, but I'm not. I really have
to get back to work.
JAKE
(takes Jane's hand)
We got really close there for a
moment.
She knows he's right. Jane's Cell RINGS.
She lets it ring
again, then answers it.
JANE
(into phone)
Hello?
66
ADAM - AT HIS OFFICE
66
ADAM
(into phone)
Hi, hope I'm not interrupting
anything.
INTERCUT JANE AND ADAM
JANE
Adam! Oh!
Hi.
73.
Jake is instantly jealous.
He rises, crosses to the closet,
starts dressing, his eyes glued to Jane who seems to be very
engaged by Adam.
ADAM
I just found out there's a French
Film Festival in town and that made
me think of you so I was wondering
if you'd like to go to the opening
night tomorrow night.
(a little nervous... will
she accept?)
JANE
Oh, that sounds so fun...
(Jake rolls his eyes)
Let me think, tomorrow's what?
JAKE
(desperate, whispers)
-- Say you're busy. Agness has a
dinner thing tomorrow, I can come
over.
(Jane hesitates)
Please.
JANE
Oh, um, you know, I'd really love
to, but, my son is coming home from
college the next day and I have a
bunch of things I have to do to get
ready...
(hates lying, Jake crosses
to her, smiles)
I'm so sorry.
ADAM
No, don't worry. No problem. Maybe
we can see something another night.
JANE
Absolutely. I would love that.
Jake smiles appreciatively, crosses to Jane, hugs her.
67
ADAM HANGS UP
67
We see he is holding Two Movie Tickets. He looks at them
then crosses to the desk of a Female Worker.
74.
ADAM
Melanie, how would you and your
husband like two tickets to the
opening of the French Film
Festival? Reserved seats...VIP
parking...
FEMALE WORKER
Seriously?
68
68
Jane and Jake are finishing getting dressed, moving about,
putting on shoes, blouses, ties, jackets, belts...
JAKE
You'll make the whole thing?
The
roast chicken, the---
JANE
-- mashed potatoes, sauteed string
beans and double fudge chocolate
cake. I know your favorite dinner,
Jakey.
JAKE
(touched)
You haven't called me Jakey in 10
years. This has been a great day
for us. So, do we have a date?
JANE
(fixes Jake's hair)
We have a date.
Jake grabs his heart. Jane leans on him, a smile on her face
as we begin to HEAR MUSIC.
69
72
Jane clips the price tag off of a new dress and slips it off
its hanger.
73
A CLOCK ON A NIGHT STAND
73
tells us it's 8:45.
ON JAKE
His eyes glued to the clock. We are IN JAKE AND AGNESS'
BEDROOM. Jake and Agness lie on their bed, both doing paper
work. Pedro is asleep between them. Jake gets up, slipping
his cell into his hand.
AGNESS
(not looking at him)
Why are you taking your cell to the
bathroom?
JAKE
Oh. Didn't mean to.
(places it back on the
night stand)
AGNESS
Carry him to his bed, will you?
Jake carefully lifts Pedro off the bed.
AGNESS
(while reading)
And hurry back. I'm ovulating.
JAKE
You are?
AGNESS
Why do you think I cancelled my
dinner?
Agness pulls her t-shirt over her head... she is gorgeous.
74
74
Jake gently lies Pedro in his bed, pulls up the covers. Pedro
takes Jake's hand, holds it to his chest, looking up at him.
Jake offers a comforting smile and Pedro closes his eyes.
76.
Jake sits on the bed and lets Pedro fall back asleep, holding
onto his hand.
75
77
Jane, Gabby, Lauren and Harley are in the kitchen, cooking,
setting the table, opening wine, chatting.
LAUREN
-- Oh, Mom, I keep forgetting to
tell you about our meeting at The
Stanhope. We went there for lunch
two days ago and met with their
Wedding Specialist....I think that
could be the place, Mom....
JANE
Two days ago you went to The
Stanhope...for lunch?
HARLEY
Yes and guess what?
We saw
nothing.
Jane and Harley connect.
He immediately looks away.
LAUREN
What is that supposed to mean?
HARLEY
Who wants wine? Anyone?
(starts pouring)
GABBY
(looking in the fridge)
Mom, you have an insane amount of
food in here, even for you.
77.
JANE
(taking out last night's
roast chicken)
I knew you were all going to be
here for the weekend so I made a
bunch of stuff last night.
LAUREN
Looks like Jake Adler's favorite
meal to me.
JANE
(laughs)
Very funny.
HARLEY
Very.
Jane looks to Harley again when they all hear a car horn
HONK. Jane LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and sees JAKE'S PORSCHE PULL
UP with Luke in the passenger seat. The Girls rush out the
Kitchen door. Harley sees Jake getting out of the car and
pours himself a larger glass of wine as Jane approaches him.
JANE
Harley?
Just then, Luke enters and Jane lights up.
JANE
Yay!!!!
(hugs Luke)
LUKE
(surveying all the food)
Mom, this looks amazing.
Harley and Luke hug, talk the talk. `Sup? Yo...
JAKE
(sheepishly joins the
group, eyes on Jane)
Hi.
JANE
(briskly)
Hey.
Harley takes a huge gulp of his wine.
JAKE
(holding Luke's backpack)
Where should I put this...?
78.
JANE
(turns her back on him,
making herself busy)
Wherever.
Harley watches their interaction tennis match style. Jake
looks at the table set for five, wishes he was joining them.
He sees last night's dinner, now being served as left overs.
Jane slices the roast chicken.
JAKE
That looks incredible.
Jane looks up at him, knife poised.
Is he kidding?
JANE
Thanks.
She goes at the chicken with the knife, slicing off a leg.
Jake flinches.
HARLEY
Jake?
Glass of wine?
JAKE
Uh, sure.
Thanks.
HARLEY
Jane?
JANE
(not looking up)
No thank you.
Jake's cell RINGS.
He turns his back to take it.
JAKE
(into cell)
Hi Ag... Just got here.
Jane has a hot flash.
Starts fanning herself.
JAKE
(into cell)
Okay, I will. Yeah, no, I know.
(turns back to the family)
I'm sorry guys, I gotta hit it.
JANE
Bye-bye.
The Girls look to Jane.
79.
JAKE
I have to stop at the market.
Agness is making some pasta thing
and she ran out of olive oil.
GABBY
Hey, at least she's finally
cooking.
JAKE
So...see everybody at the party
tomorrow...
LAUREN
Yeah.
It's gonna be so fun.
JANE
(to Lauren)
I told you I'm bringing someone,
right?
LAUREN
No. Who?
JANE
Adam.
My architect.
JAKE
You're bringing your architect?
JANE
Yes I am.
JAKE
Like as a date?
JANE
(looking right at him)
Yeah.
GABBY
I like the idea.
JANE
Me too.
HARLEY
Yeah, seems like it should round
out everything really nicely.
(pouring another drink)
Nobody wants wine but me?
80.
Luke opens a cupboard, takes out a bottle of olive oil, hands
it to Jake.
LUKE
Here, now you can stay another five
minutes.
(catches Jane's eye)
You have three bottles in there.
JAKE
Janey, can I talk to you privately?
Just for a sec.
Jane heads out still holding the carving knife.
Harley slips
the knife out of her hand.
HARLEY
There you go....
(to Kids)
Somebody's talkin' graduation gift.
78
78
Jane and Jake stand in the courtyard off of the Living Room.
JANE
What is it, Jake?
What?
JAKE
I don't get not calling me back.
JANE
`Cause I don't care what your
excuse is.
(shuts the door to the
living )
JAKE
She didn't go out, Jane. She
cancelled her plans and every
time I tried to call or write, she
caught me. I wanted to be here.
JANE
You know what, Jake? You were
worried about rocking the boat at
home? Well now you're rocking my
boat and I don't like it.
JAKE
(stopping her)
Honey, don't let one night...
81.
JANE
You don't understand. I'm not even
blaming you. I fully participated
in this. But I don't want to do it
anymore. The last thing in the
world I should be right now is your
mistress, sitting around at nine at
night wearing heels and perfume and
blowing out candles and wrapping
everything in Saran Wrap because
your wife cancelled her plans. It
was cliche and humiliating.
JAKE
(wistfully)
You lit candles?
JANE
Oh, shut up. Look, I've had a
pretty good life these past 10
years. I figured it out and I
moved on. I no longer feel alone
or divorced. I just feel normal.
You know how long that took, just
to get my balance back?
JAKE
No.
JANE
The point is, I'm going in the
wrong direction here. But the
worst part is... It's feeling like
it used to feel. All the little
untruths that are hard to catch but
add up...
JAKE
-- Janey, c'mon, it was one
mistake...
HARLEY
(joining them)
-- Everything okay out here?
(Jane and Jake turn)
The kids are gettin' hungry...
JANE
Yeah. We're done.
(walks away, pauses in
front of Harley)
We were just...
82.
HARLEY
(as she passes)
-- None of my beeswax, Jane.
(once she's gone)
And please never tell me.
Lauren joins.
LAUREN
What's up?
JAKE
Nothin', punky.
(rubs her arm)
LAUREN
(taking Jake back inside)
Yeah? So, we're going to see you
tomorrow night, for sure, right?
Harley starts to follow them out when Jane grabs his shirt
sleeve.
JANE
Okay...What did you see and what do
you know?
HARLEY
Nothing. Really.
Jane gives him a look that could get blood from a stone.
HARLEY
(confesses rapidly)
Okay, he checked in, you arrived,
you met in the elevator, possible
kiss there, Doctor went up, Doctor
came down, thumbs up. That's it.
Have no idea what happened in
between.
JANE
(dying...)
Have you told Lauren?
HARLEY
No and I won't --
LUKE
(joining them)
Mom. Dad's leaving...
83.
Jane and Harley ENTER from the courtyard just as Jake is
about to leave. Jane immediately crosses to the table which
now has dinner on it.
Lauren kisses Jake good-bye on the cheek then joins the
others who are about to sit down for dinner.
LUKE
(from the Dining Room)
Thanks for picking me up, Dad...
Jake pauses awkwardly at the door. He can't catch Jane's
eye. He waves to the kids, who don't seem to notice then
heads out.
83
JANE
So, let me ask you something and
please don't think I'm weird or out
of line or anything... but do you
by any chance poke smot?
ADAM
Do I...??
JANE
I mean do you smoke pot?! I
haven't asked anyone that question
since I was twenty-two.
86.
ADAM
Uh. No, I don't. But I have. But
I don't think I've had any since my
kids were born...so not in like 27
years.
JANE
Oh my God, we have kids the same
age! And I haven't had any since
my kids were born either!!! Except
for tonight. I had one hit off of
this.
Jane pulls the joint out of her purse, just as they pull up
next to a Police Car.
ADAM
You might not want to hold that
quite so...
(nods)
Hello Officer.
JANE
(turns, SEES the Cop Car,
GASPS and DROPS THE
JOINT, then TURNS to Cop,
waves, then:)
I actually know him! Blueberry
scone and a latte.
(the Cop nods, pulls away)
Oh my God! That was horrifying. I
instantly saw myself in a mug shot.
My heart is leaping out of my...
(then distracted)
Wow... This is the most insane
dashboard I've ever seen. It's like
we're in a cockpit. It's
spectacular. Adam, what kind of
car is this?
ADAM
Jane?
JANE
(turns to him)
Hi.
ADAM
Did you get this high from one hit?
87.
JANE
Yes! I don't know what they've
done to pot over the last 30 years
but it rockkkkks!
84
86
Jane and Adam, two very straight laced grown ups, ENTER the
party, pausing as they peruse the crowd.
88.
JANE
How you feeling?
ADAM
Totally fine.
JANE
Me too.
Adam starts to move to the music insanely well and then just
insanely. Lauren and Harley greet them. Jane greets them
back with a huge hug.
JANE
Hi... love your dress.
Hey Harls.
HARLEY
(that's weird...)
Harls...?
JANE
Adam, this is my oldest, Lauren and
her fiance, Harley.
(giggles to Kids)
We're on a date.
Adam and Jane stifle laughs.
87
AT THE BAR - WIDE - MOMENTS LATER
87
Jane and Adam chat with all the Kids.
Looks like it's going
great -- Adam is a big hit.
ON JAKE - WATCHING FROM ACROSS THE ROOM
Jake nurses a drink and is not looking happy. He sees the
Kids disperse, finishes off his vodka, ready to make his
move.
ON JANE AND ADAM
Now alone.
They haven't seen Jake yet.
ADAM
(starts moving to the
music - Jane laughs)
By the way -- How great is this
party? Let's be the last to leave.
(bops to the MUSIC then
SPOTS JAKE ACROSS THE
ROOM, seriously eyeing
him.)
(MORE)
89.
ADAM(cont'd)
Hey, there's your ex-husb-- Uh-Oh.
He's headed right toward us. Not
the time to be "feeling groovy"
(dances again when he sees
Jake in SLOW-MO getting
closer and closer)
Oooo. Why so intense, big fella?
Adam slides a bit behind Jane as Jake arrives with Agness who
looks inappropriately youthful.
JAKE
Hello Jane.... Adam.
ADAM
(all smiles)
Hey, good to see you again.
JANE
Adam, this is Agness, Jake's
wife...
(suddenly realizing)
Now that is an odd sentence for me
to say since that was me for most
of my life. Seriously. How weird
is that? Both of us married to the
same man!
AGNESS
(dismissing the idea)
You know... it's... hey, what are
you gonna do?
JAKE
Yeah, why go there.
At this point, Adam gets hit with a severe case of the
giggles. As the rest continue, he can't keep a straight
face.
JANE
Because there, is...fascinating. I
mean, when you think about it, it
sort of links us in some cosmic
crazy way, doesn't it, Agness? Of
all the men on the planet, we both
said "I do" to this guy.
AGNESS
Yeah. Twenty-five years apart. I
know you're having like an "Ah-Ha'
moment, but I think I'm gonna get a
refill. Adam, good meeting you.
90.
ADAM
(whispers to Jane as
Agness exits)
She's got a really scary tattoo.
JAKE
Janey, can I talk to you for a
quick sec?
Jake nods his head toward the bathroom and heads for it. Jane
looks to Adam.
JANE
He always needs me for a quick sec.
(starts to exit)
You okay?
ADAM
Oh, I'm very okay!
88
88
Jane and Jake are crammed into an extremely tight space.
JAKE
What's going on?
You're acting
insane.
JANE
(whispers giddily)
I'm stoned.
JAKE
What?! You smoked the joint I gave
you?
JANE
You told me to!
It's a-mazing!!!
JAKE
But you weren't supposed to smoke
it with him, you're supposed to
smoke it with me!
JANE
Somebody's jealous....
JAKE
Yes, of course. Why shouldn't I
be... you're my...
91.
JANE
-- What?
What am I, Jake?
JAKE
You're my ex-wife, lover, oldest
friend and girlfriend.
Jane blurts out a laugh.
JANE
Okay. You're hilarious. And
because of that, even though I kind
of hate you/love you, I'm going to
let you have some...
JAKE
You love me? I mean, I heard "hate"
had top billing, but...
Jane takes the joint out of her purse, lights it up and hands
it to Jake. Just as she does that, THE DOOR OPENS and HARLEY
ENTERS, thinking the bathroom is free. Jake quickly yanks
him in, shuts the door, locks it. Harley is now caught
between Jane and Jake and a cloud of smoke.
HARLEY
Oh my God, you're smoking weed in
the guest bathroom.
JAKE
Yes we are and we'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell anyone about
this.
HARLEY
No. Never.
Adding it to the list.
JANE
Care for a toke?
HARLEY
I don't really smoke marijuana.
JANE
(blowing out smoke)
Me either.
HARLEY
Okay, one hit.
JANE
(looks at herself in the
mirror)
(MORE)
92.
JANE(cont'd)
Oh, my God. Is that what I look
like?
89
90
Adam drives Jane home.
Clearly the end of a great night.
JANE
Wow. Fun is not overrated, is it?
93.
ADAM
You know what's great?
JANE
What?
ADAM
How much I like you.
JANE
(really touched)
Thank you... I really like you a
lot too.... even though...oh.. you
didn't say, "a lot".
ADAM
But I was thinking it.
JANE
So... I'm not too old for you?
ADAM
How can you be too old for me when
I'm older than you.
JANE
I just figured all these women you
get fixed up with are thirty-five.
ADAM
Your age is one of my favorite
things about you.
(she appreciates that)
Do you think you have any more of
that chocolate cake at your house?
JANE
Hungry?
ADAM
Starved!
91
A BLACK SCREEN - LIGHTS POP ON
91
And we are IN THE BAKERY at ONE A.M. Jane turns on a few
more lights, but keeps it a bit moody.
ADAM
Officially now the best date of my
life. Pre or post divorce.
94.
JANE
Get out... All right....so
basically I can make you anything
on the menu or even not on the
menu. Just name it.
ADAM
No?
Really? Okay.
(scans the blackboard
menu)
What about a... warm chocolate
croissant?
JANE
My speciality!
92
OMIT
92
JANE FLOURS AND ROLLS CROISSANT DOUGH as Adam, now in an
apron, watches, chatting with her. Jane then places the
dough in a machine called a Sheeter. The dough slides into
the sheeter and then slides back out bigger and flatter.
ANGLE - JANE AND ADAM - TWO STONERS
watching the sheeter, mesmerized.
NEXT Jane folds the flattened dough, measures it with a yard
stick, then cuts it into sections. She takes one of the
sections, spreads it on a marble slab and very quickly cuts
it into triangles. She's a whiz at this.
THEN, Jane shows Adam how to stretch the triangles of
dough.... Nervous at first, he gets the hang of it. Then,
Jane teaches Adam how to place a bar of chocolate in each
triangle and roll it into a croissant. Laughing as they
93
Jane and Adam sit at a table in the corner, a stack of
croissants piled high between them. Music plays as Adam
takes the top croissant and Jane takes the next.
95.
ADAM
(bites into it)
Oh. Baby.
JANE
(smelling hers)
Mmmmmmmm.
ADAM
It's crazy how good this is.
JANE
(biting into one, nods)
Yeah, and I'm not even stoned
anymore.
ADAM
Neither am I.
JANE
(happy about that)
Oh, then...merci, Monsieur.
ADAM
Do you remember when I asked you
the other night, if you were dating
anyone and you said no... It
sounded to me like you were maybe
saying yes.
JANE
I was sort of seeing someone.
But,
it's over now.
(Adam nods)
Honestly.
ADAM
`Cause I'm not strong enough to
fall for someone who's with someone
else. Wouldn't be able to take
that again.
JANE
I understand. I wouldn't say it
was over if it wasn't.
Adam takes Jane's hand in his...relieved.
ADAM
Great.
Adam turns Jane's hand over and looks at it a bit
quizzically.
96.
JANE
(explains)
Cooking scar.... From a very hot
batch of caramel...
ADAM
Ooooo. What about that one?
JANE
That one's from boiling sugar...I
wasn't very skilled in the
beginning.
And that one is from a
large French...
Adam presses Jane's palm to his lips and kisses her scar.
JANE
-- Saute pan.
Adam then kisses the burn on her forearm. Jane sighs, closes
her eyes. This feeling is unexpected. She opens her eyes as
Adam moves closer.
ADAM
Would it be okay if I...?
Jane nods.
He kisses her great.
ADAM
I was going to say, kiss you.
JANE
I figured.
ADAM
If you feel this is in any way
wrong because we're working
together...
JANE
... I don't ...
He smiles as she folds into him and they kiss and kiss and
kiss again.

97.
Quiet. Jane enters from the garden, humming, "Wouldn't It Be
Nice." Luke ENTERS, still looking half asleep in his T Shirt
and boxers.
JANE
Hey sleepy! What time did you get
in?
LUKE
Have no idea. Lauren and Harley
drove me home.
LAUREN
(joining)
I'm surprised you remember that.
JANE
(turns to see Lauren)
Hi. I didn't know you slept here.
Lauren, in an open robe over drawstrings and a tank top,
takes out a box of cereal.
LAUREN
We were playing Scattagories with
Gabby and Ollie then Harley fell
asleep on the couch.
Harley meanders in wearing Victoria Secret Heart patterned PJ
bottoms and a Girl's V-neck T-shirt.
LUKE
Sweet.
HARLEY
I got cold in the middle of the
night.
Lauren and Jane laugh.
JANE
Okay, who wants what?
(noticing Gabby entering)
Hi baby...
GABBY
(looks out the front
window)
What's Dad doing here?
98.
Everyone LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and SEES Jake sitting in his
Porsche.
96
99
The Adlers are watching The Graduate. The lights are low.
Jake, shoes off, hands everyone bowls of popcorn. Jane sits
in a club chair. Harley's on the floor and the Adler Kids
are on one long sofa, all covered in a blanket. Jake hands
them popcorn then squeezes back in, between the Girls.
ON THE FLAT SCREEN - BUCK HENRY AND DUSTIN HOFFMAN
BUCK HENERY
Are you here for an affair, sir?
DUSTIN
What?
BUCK HENRY
The Singleman party, sir?
Jane cringes as the Kids laugh. She looks over at Jake
snuggling between the Kids, all eating popcorn and laughing.
He catches Jane's eye and mouths.
JAKE
I'M SO HAPPY!!!
100
101
Jake, bare legged and wearing a robe and slippers, crosses to
the KITCHEN where he finds Luke and Gabby digging through the
fridge.
JAKE
Any leftovers?
GABBY
Are you kidding?
(takes out an armful of
Tupperware)
JAKE
Any of that noodle thing left?
(Gabby hands it to him.)
Where's Mom? She disappeared so
fast after the movie.
GABBY
She's probably sleeping.
LUKE
I think she's on her computer.
They all nibble out of Tupperware, leaning against various
counters.
LUKE
Tonight was weird.
GABBY
So weird. Still is.
JAKE
I loved tonight.
GABBY
Yeah. That's why it was so weird.
Just seeing you in your robe in our
kitchen. Remember when you weren't
even allowed in. Mom used to go out
to the car to talk to you...
LUKE
(handing Gabby his
Tupperware)
You know, I don't even really
remember you and Mom as a couple.
104.
JAKE
What do you mean... you were ten
when we broke up.
LUKE
I was eight actually and I don't
know...it's all foggy to me now.
JAKE
You don't remember us in Hawaii or
all sleeping in that tent in the
backyard.
LUKE
Yeah, of course, but I don't
remember like you and Mom hugging
or waking up together...
Jake grabs his heart, moans.
LUKE
-- It's okay. I'm not damaged or
anything. You've been good
parents...
GABBY
Speak for yourself dude. I'm
definitely damaged from the
divorce.
Harley and Lauren ENTER.
Lauren turns the tea kettle on.
LAUREN
Hello troops.
JAKE
Why are you still here?
LAUREN
I don't know, you and Mom sleeping
in the same house. Harley thought
we should stay.
Jake turns his beams on Harley.
HARLEY
She exaggerates. I just thought
perhaps you might want to talk
later, or ... Is that the noodle
thing?
JAKE
Oh. Sorry. I think I ate it all.
105.
GABBY
Dad!
JAKE
I didn't know anyone wanted any.
102

Jane, sits on her bed, talking to Adam via iSight. On her
LAPTOP SCREEN, we see Adam but he's a bit of a BLUR.
JANE
Wait, I can't see that one.
Can
you back up a little?
CLOSE ON JANE'S LAP TOP SCREEN - ADAM IN HIS BEDROOM
He back ups from the lens and models a rather ridiculous ski
sweater.
JANE
(hmmm)
Very festive...
ADAM
O-kay. Thank you.
(into lens)
Gift from my ex-sister-in-law.
Have no idea why I kept it.
(pulls sweater off)
Into the pile. Hey, check out the
pile, Jane.
Adam POINTS HIS LAPTOP to the floor to show a HUGE STACK OF
OLD CLOTHES.
JANE
Nice!
(then)
Hey, the pile's moving....
ADAM
Murphy, get out of there!
A small Mutt scurries out of the pile.
Jane laughs.
ADAM
(re-enters in an odd
shirt)
What about this?
I was in India
and I had it made.
(MORE)
106.
ADAM(cont'd)
The guy ran out of fabric so he
didn't make me long sleeves.
(looks down)
Or short sleeves. It's weird.
JANE
And kinda girly.
ADAM
(taking it off)
Not what I'm going for.
(holds up a sweater)
Gray sweater. Very old.
JANE
But cute.
ADAM
(slips it on)
You sure? You don't have to say you
like it just because you nixed the
last 20 things.
Jane likes this man.
JANE
Keep it. It's cozy.
Boy, you have
a lot of clothes.
ADAM
(looks at the floor)
Uh, not anymore. Okay, we're
almost done. You are helping me so
much by the way.
JANE
-- Adam, I really have to pee.
ADAM
Oh good. Me too. Meet you back in
thirty....
(lifting the laptop)
Putting this on my desk....
ON JANE'S SIDE
Just a shot of Jane's Pillows on her bed.
JANE'S VOICE
I'm not in there...
ON ADAM'S SIDE - AN ISIGHT FRAME OF AN EMPTY DESK CHAIR.
107.
ADAM'S VOICE
Can't hear you.
103
103
Jake pokes his head in, looks around, sees no one in the
room. He hears Jane in the bathroom and ENTERS quietly,
quickly squirms out of his boxers and T-shirt, then, DROPS
HIS ROBE, and lies on his side, on the bed, completely NUDE --
elbow up, palm supporting his head -- a smile on his face. He
changes his smile to a smoulder.
Jake hears water running. Suddenly modest, he quickly drags
over the open Laptop and places the open screen in front of
his privates. He smiles, ready to be discovered.
JANE
A104
dries her hands at the bathroom sink.
A104

Adam crosses through the room on his way to his laptop.
105
JANE ENTERS HER BEDROOM, SEES JAKE and lets out a SCREAM. 105
Simultaneously, ADAM PLOPS DOWN IN HIS DESK CHAIR, LOOKS AT
HIS SCREEN and instantly YANKS HIMSELF AWAY in disgust.
ADAM
Mother of --
(looks again)
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
Jake LOOKS DOWN AT THE SCREEN,
SEES ADAM'S SCREAMING FACE
AND SCREAMS BACK.
JANE
What are you doing in here?!!!
ADAM
(covering the screen with
his hands)
Get it off!!!
JAKE
(covering himself)
I wanted to see you.
108.
JANE
Why are you naked!?!
JAKE
(sits up straight, the lap
top shooting even more
directly at his groin)
Why do you think?
ADAM
Okay, I'm gonna be sick.
Jake LEANS IN, covers Adam's eyes on the screen, which, of
course, does nothing.
ADAM
Not working! Big close up!
Jake rises, now his ass gets the close up, he bends over to
get his robe.
ADAM
Okay!
Good night!
Jake SPINS THE LAPTOP and the ISIGHT LENS LANDS ON JANE.
Jane and Adam look at one another. No time to say anything.
She's desperate. He's lost.
The DOOR FLIES OPEN, the KIDS RUSH IN, just as Jake ties his
robe.
GABBY
Everybody okay?
No one says anything.
LAUREN
What's happening?
Adam listens, his eyes on Jane. Jake crosses to Jane, facing
the Kids. He walks in and out of the iSight shot.
JAKE
Okay. Let me explain. The reason I
left Agness wasn't just because my
marriage wasn't working.
(The Kids wait...)
I've also fallen in love...back in
love... with your mother. Or maybe
I never stopped loving her.
GABBY
Is this a joke?
109.
JAKE
I know this is shocking, but I
think this is the best thing that's
ever happened to me. Your Mom and
I have been seeing each other, on
the side... ever since New York.
LAUREN
Mom, is this true?
JANE
(dying)
That part is, but..
JAKE
I found my way back home.
I just
hope she'll take me back.
Gabby breaks down in tears.
Lauren puts her arm around her.
Jane starts to cry, looks at her laptop, just as she HEARS A
CLICK and THE LAPTOP SCREEN GOES BLACK.
JAKE
Why's everyone crying?
Why isn't
this good news?
LAUREN
Because we're still getting over
the divorce.
LUKE
Mom, are you and Dad getting back
together?
JANE
No... we're not.
Jane looks at the Kids with incredible sadness.
106
125
Harley leads Jane down the narrow hall to the Bedroom.
HARLEY
Now I know you don't need my advice
Jane, but...
JANE
I got this one...
HARLEY
I know you do.
Jane pauses, Harley nods for her to go inside.
JANE'S POV - INSIDE THE BEDROOM
Her Three Kids are under the covers. Lauren is between Gabby
and Luke. They look like they just woke up.
111.
Jane stands in the doorway. The Kids don't say a word. Jane
doesn't wait. She crosses to the bed, sits on it, looks at
her children.
JANE
Knowing how to be divorced is next
to impossible... and sometimes over
the years, I've thought that your
Dad and I weren't quite finished.
And, as it turns out, we weren't.
So I went out of my comfort zone,
which, I found out, if you're
really honest with yourself, isn't
all that comforting. So, I
experimented with a part of myself.
I wanted to find out if, after all
these years there was still
something there between us.
LAUREN
And was there?
JANE
There kinda was.
Lauren smiles with her eyes.
GABBY
But Mom, you have to understand how
bonkers this sounds to us. For two
people who for years couldn't be in
the same room together...to then
have an affair??? You and Dad...!
JANE
I know...it was hard for me and I
was doing it. I hope you'll
forgive me for confusing you or
betraying your trust, but I did
this for me and for him and I
realized even though your Dad and I
once had something extraordinary...
we no longer really fit together.
But he is a part of me and always
will be.
LUKE
So it's over now? You guys are
back to being divorced.
JANE
For better or for worse.
112.
Lauren takes her Mom's hand. Harley joins them, sitting on
the other side of the bed, holding back tears.
HARLEY
Group hug?
And as they all move into hug, we:
CUT TO:
126
126
REVERSE ON JANE walking through Adam's firm.
She arrives at:
127
ADAM'S OFFICE
127
Adam is on a phone call.
ADAM
(into phone)
Yeah no problem...we can definitely
do that...
(notices Jane)
-- James, can I call you back,
someone just... Thanks.
(rises)
Hi.
JANE
Hi. May I come in?
ADAM
-- Sure.
JANE
I didn't call you last night
because I wasn't sure you would
take the call and then I thought
that could go on for months and...
ADAM
-- I would have taken the call.
JANE
Oh. Well, anyway, it's better to
say these things in person. Adam,
the man I was seeing was...
ADAM
I think I'm up to speed on that
part.
113.
JANE
I want you to know it didn't last
long and you're divorced, so maybe
you understand, when marriages end,
there's doubts and hurt, and you've
got kids and sometimes you wonder
if you did the right thing and when
the moment presented itself...
ADAM
-- I get it. I could imagine it...I
could...
JANE
I told him it wasn't going to work
between us but I guess he didn't
believe me and unbeknownst to me,
he showed up at my house yesterday.
He left Agness and...
ADAM
-- Jane. I actually think I
understand what happened
but...uh...you know I'm not as
macho as I appear and I think it's
probably best for us not to get any
more... involved because your
relationship with Jake isn't really
done and I know you're saying it
is, but he's in love with you and
for everyone's sake, that should
probably get resolved.
JANE
Wow.
So that's how grown ups talk.
Adam smiles.
JANE
Please tell me you're not going to
quit my job and ask Peter to take
over because then I'll never get to
see you and...
ADAM
I was thinking of asking Peter to
step back in.
JANE
Oh... I hope you don't...
ADAM
Thanks.
