                          HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET

      EXT. HICKORY AVENUE/ROLAND PARK - EARLY EVENING

      An average, ordinary middle-class neighborhood. Solid 
      homes. Well-kept lawns. Family-size cars. Completely out of 
      place, a regulation Baltimore City Police Department 
      Cavalier drives along.

                                  BOLANDER (O.C.)
                    Nothing is real.

                                  PEMBLETON (O.C.)
                    What do you mean, nothing is real?

                                  BOLANDER (O.C.)
                    There is no reality.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Really...

      The Cavalier pulls over to curb. FRANK PEMBLETON gets out 
      of driver's side as STANLEY BOLANDER emerges from the 
        passenger's. They head down the sidewalk.

                                  BOLANDER
                    Take the color green. You see green, I see 
                    green. We call it "green" because as a 
                    society we have agreed that this thing, 
                    this color, is green. We think we're having 
                    the shared experience of green, but how do 
                    we know? Maybe my green is actually greener 
                    than your green.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    You mean, maybe my green is red?

                                  BOLANDER
                    Maybe. Take colorblind people, they carry 
                    with them a stigma --

                                  PEMBLETON
                      A stigmatism.                                  BOLANDER
                    Because they don't see what the rest of us 
                    see as green. But maybe, just maybe, their 
                      perception is correct. Maybe a colorblind 
                    person is actually seeing pure green, the 
                    real green.

      They pass through yellow plastic police lines. We become 
      aware that the calm of the neighborhood has been shattered 
      by a crime. An M.E. Van waits for its latest passenger. 
      UNIFORMS hold ONLOOKERS at bay. Other POLICE PERSONNEL move 
      in and out of a white, two story home.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Man, this is just my luck. I get a call. My 
                    partner's off tonight. So I look around the 
                    Squad Room. I see Munch. No. I see Howard. 
                    No. Felton. Lewis. No. No. I think 
                    Bolander. I'll take Bolander. He's the only 
                    one who won't drive me crazy.

                                  BOLANDER
                    I'm driving you crazy?

                                  PEMBLETON
                      Philosophizing. You're not know as the 
                      philosophical type, Stan.

                                  BOLANDER
                    You get shot in the head, it makes you 
                    think.

      They reach the front door of the house. The BODY of a 
      seventeen year old, olive-skinned man, Hikmet Gersel, lies 
      dead, shot through the chest. His face is covered with 
      white stage makeup. He wears a leather jacket. ALYSSA DYER, 
      Assistant Medical Examiner, takes notes. PEMBLETON turns to 
      Officer STEVEN PASKULY.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Hey, Paskuly, what've we got?

                                    PASKULY
                    The deceased name is Hikmet Gersel, G-E-R-
                    S-E-L. 
                                  (MORE)                                    PASKULY (CONT'D)
                    Seventeen years old, exchange student from 
                    Turkey.

                                  BOLANDER
                    Do Turks wear white makeup? Is that some 
                    kind of religious thing? Or is he a mime?

                                    PASKULY
                    The owner of the house thought he was a 
                    burglar, shot him.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Where's the homeowner?

                                    PASKULY
                    Inside. I got him and his wife in separate 
                    rooms. Plus a friend of this kid here. The 
                    friend says they were going to a party and 
                    got the wrong address.

      PEMBLETON, BOLANDER and PASKULY enter house.

      INT. LIVING ROOM/JIM BAYLISS HOME - EARLY EVENING

      PEMBLETON, BOLANDER and PASKULY enter. COPS all over. A MAN 
      in his mid-thirties sits with his head in his hands.

                                    PASKULY (CONT.)
                    The guy's name is Jim Bayliss.

      The MAN looks up, lost, confused. PEMBLETON registers 
      surprise, leans into BOLANDER.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Stan -- Jim Bayliss, he's Tim's cousin.

      BOLANDER looks at PEMBLETON, then at JIM. On JIM, in shock,

                                                                              FADE TO:

                                                                              FADE IN:

      INT. TIM BAYLISS' CAR - NIGHT

      CU on TIM BAYLISS' face.

                                  PEMBLETON (V.O.)
                    You have the right to remain silent. 
                    Anything you say can and will be used 
                    against you in a court of law. Do you 
                      understand?

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    Yes.

      CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL BAYLISS, in street clothes, in 
      his own Car, driving, alone.

                                  PEMBLETON (V.O.)
                    Do you need me to explain further?

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    No. I'm a lawyer.

                                  PEMBLETON (V.O.)
                    Even so. I have to ask.

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    Of course.

      BAYLISS pulls up to curb.

      EXT. HICKORY AVENUE/ROLAND PARK - NIGHT

      Car stops. BAYLISS gets out.

                                  PEMBLETON (V.O.)
                    You have the right to an attorney. If you 
                    decide not to speak to an attorney at this 
                    time, no questions will be asked of you. Do 
                    you understand?                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    Yes.

      BAYLISS crosses to the Jim Bayliss' home as the M.E. TEAM 
      puts BODY into van.

      INT. DEN/JIM BAYLISS HOME - NIGHT

      PEMBLETON sits beside JIM.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Do you need me to explain further?

                                  JIM
                    No.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    If you do decide to speak to us, you may 
                    stop at anytime. Do you understand?

      JIM nods.

      INT. LIVING ROOM/JIM BAYLISS HOME - NIGHT

      BAYLISS enters, looks around at the chaos.

                                  PEMBLETON (O.C., CONT.)
                    Do you need me to explain further?

                                  JIM (O.C.)
                    No.

      BAYLISS, on a mission, crosses to BOLANDER.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Where is he?

                                  BOLANDER
                    The den.

      BAYLISS turns toward Den, BOLANDER reacts.

                                  BOLANDER (CONT.)
                    Hey, Tim, wait --

      BAYLISS keeps going.      INT. DEN/JIM BAYLISS HOME - NIGHT

      JIM and PEMBLETON sit opposite each other.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    If you wish an attorney, you will be 
                    afforded one. Do you --

      Door opens. BAYLISS enters.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Jim, you okay?

      PEMBLETON is up on his feet instantly.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Hey, hey, Tim, you know you're not allowed 
                    in here.

                                    BAYLISS
                    He's my cousin.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    That's why you're not allowed.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Frank, this is me here. Don't start giving 
                    me regulations, don't shove procedures in 
                    my face --

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Calm down.

                                    BAYLISS
                    And don't tell me to calm down --

                                  JIM
                    Teege.

      BAYLISS turns to face JIM.

                                  JIM (CONT.)
                    It's okay.

                                    BAYLISS
                    But --

      JIM gives him an "I-got-it-under-control" look. BAYLISS       hesitates for a beat, nods, looks at PEMBLETON, turns, 
      exits. BOLANDER closes the door.

                                  JIM
                    Working Homicide has really changed him. 
                    Teege never used to be so... aggressive.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Why do you call Tim "Teege"?

                                  JIM
                    It's a family nickname. When we were 
                    playing basketball in school, we were the 
                    dynamic duo. Tim and Jim. T and J. Teege... 
                    Stupid, huh?

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Growing up, my brothers called me Bucky. 
                    Can't remember why.
                            (resumes his seat)
                    Okay. To repeat... If you want a lawyer, 
                    you will be afforded one.

      JIM shakes his head, no.

      INT. MASTER BEDROOM/JIM BAYLISS HOME - NIGHT

      SHANNON BAYLISS, mid-thirties, sits on canopied bed, 
      holding one CHILD, six months old. On the floor, two other 
      CHILDREN, three and six, play. BAYLISS enters.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Shannon --

      SHANNON sees him, smiles relieved. The CHILDREN also react. 
      QUICK CUTS of hugs, kisses. Then:

                                    SHANNON
                    It's a nightmare.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Yeah.

                                    SHANNON
                    I called my parents. Asked them to come 
                    watch the kids. The detective says I'll 
                    have to go down to Headquarters to tell 
                                  (MORE)                                    SHANNON (CONT'D)
                    what happened. He was very nice about it.

                                    BAYLISS
                      Pembleton?

                                    SHANNON
                    The white one. You want some coffee or 
                      something?

                                    BAYLISS
                    Naw. Actually I gotta hit the head.
                            (hugs SHANNON again)
                      Everything's gonna be fine.

      BAYLISS exits.

      INT. HALLWAY/JIM BAYLISS HOME - NIGHT

      BAYLISS enters, walks to Bathroom. The door is locked. He 
      looks inside one of the Children's Rooms.

      BAYLISS' POV: another seventeen year old, DAVID SCHOLTZ, 
      whose face is also covered in white makeup and wearing a 
      leather jacket. Bathroom door opens. BOLANDER emerges.

                                  BOLANDER
                    There must been okra in the Kentucky Burgoo 
                    I had with dinner. I get a bad reaction to 
                    okra.

                                    BAYLISS
                            (indicates SCHOLTZ)
                    Who's the kid?

                                  BOLANDER
                    Friend of the deceased.

      BOLANDER heads off. BAYLISS stares at SCHOLTZ, who looks 
      up, sees BAYLISS and looks away, nervously. BAYLISS enters 
      the Bathroom, shutting the door behind him.

      INT. DEN/JIM BAYLISS HOME - NIGHT

      JIM sits alone. Beat. PEMBLETON enters with a UNIFORM.                                  PEMBLETON
                    Alright, Jim, this officer is going to 
                    transport you to Headquarters where we'll 
                    take your statement.

                                  JIM
                    I told the first policeman who arrived 
                      everything.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Uh-huh. But I'd kinda like to hear it for 
                    myself.

                                  JIM
                    Okay.

      Pembleton turns to UNIFORM, who takes out handcuffs. JIM 
      reacts, surprised.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Sorry. It's standard.

                                  JIM
                    Yeah... I know that.

      UNIFORM cuffs JIM, who faces PEMBLETON with fragile smile.

                                  JIM (CONT.)
                    I've just never been handcuffed before.

      PEMBLETON nods to UNIFORM, who escorts JIM out.

      INT. HALLWAY/JIM BAYLISS HOME - NIGHT

      BAYLISS hovers by the Den door as JIM and UNIFORM come out, 
      followed by PEMBLETON. BAYLISS sees JIM cuffed, reacts. 
      BOLANDER approaches, carrying a .44 caliber Smith and 
      Wesson revolver.

                                  BOLANDER
                    We need you to identify this as the weapon 
                    you used.

                                  JIM
                    Yes. It is. That's it.

      SHANNON comes out Bedroom, see her HUSBAND handcuffed and 
      the revolver. She lets out a WAIL. BAYLISS goes to her,       holds her. On JIM, being led out the door,

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. SQUAD ROOM/HOMICIDE UNIT - NIGHT

      The name "G-E-R-S-E-L" is written on "The Board" in RED 
      under Pembleton's name.

      PULL BACK to REVEAL MELDRICK LEWIS leaning over the 
      shoulder of JOHN MUNCH, who sits at his desk, poring over 
      financial ledgers.

                                  LEWIS
                    The restaurant is losing money?

                                  MUNCH
                    The restaurant's not losing money, we're 
                    losing money. All of our money.

                                  LEWIS
                    How's that possible? The bar's full every 
                    night.

                                  MUNCH
                    The bar is full. The restaurant is empty. 
                    We gotta figure out a way to get people to 
                    come in and eat.

                                  LEWIS
                    You wanna know the best way to get people 
                    to come in and eat? Serve good food.

                                  MUNCH
                    We serve good food.

                                  LEWIS
                    Our chef, Henri? He stinks. I don't even 
                    think he's really French.

                                  MUNCH
                    You don't like the food?

                                  LEWIS
                    The truth? Since you hired that frog man, I 
                    only are there but once. I tried his Croque 
                    Monsieur and I got the runs. 
                                  (MORE)                                  LEWIS (CONT'D)
                    I say we hand Henri his toque and point to 
                    the door.

      BAYLISS crosses by.

                                  MUNCH
                    Hey, partner, we need to have a confab.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Later.

      BAYLISS continues to "The Box", where the blinds are 
      closed. PEMBLETON and BOLANDER exit.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Okay. I'll take him down to the lab, GSR 
                    him.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Frank, can we talk?

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Sure.

                                  BOLANDER
                    You want me in or out, Tim?

                                    BAYLISS
                    Out, Stan. Thanks.

      BOLANDER crosses toward Coffee Room.

                                    BAYLISS (CONT.)
                    Look, I'm sorry for the way I behaved at my 
                    cousin's house. You just gotta understand, 
                    Jim and me, we grew up next door to each 
                    other. He and his brother Kurt were like my 
                    brothers. Jim's dad died when he was 
                    thirteen --

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Tim --

                                    BAYLISS
                    No, no, listen to me, Frank. I'm telling 
                    you all of this so that you know the kind 
                                  (MORE)                                    BAYLISS (CONT'D)
                    of person you're dealing with. He's not 
                    some sleazy smokehound. He's a fine man, a 
                    fine human being.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    I don't doubt that.

                                    BAYLISS
                            (takes a step back)
                    Oh, I see...

                                  PEMBLETON
                    See what?

                                    BAYLISS
                    You're giving me that look you give when 
                    you've got your mind made up, when you've 
                    decided to hunt for bear. Well, I'm here to 
                    tell you, Frank, I'm not gonna let you do 
                    it.

      NAOMI approaches.

                                  NAOMI
                    Excuse me... Bayliss, you told me to tell 
                    you when your cousin's wife arrived.

      BAYLISS signals NAOMI to wait.

                                    BAYLISS
                    I'm not gonna let you hurt my family, 
                    Frank. I know all your tricks. You better 
                    not take one little baby step outta line.

      SHANNON enters "The Aquarium", escorted by UNIFORM. BAYLISS 
      follows NAOMI over.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Tim --

      BAYLISS keeps going. PEMBLETON watches BAYLISS as he enters 
      "The Aquarium".

      INT. CRIME LAB/POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

      A Crime Lab TECHNICIAN sits at a table as PEMBLETON and JIM 
      enter.                                  PEMBLETON (CONT.)
                    We're gonna test your fingers for barium 
                    residue. That's the powder on a person's 
                    hand after a gun is discharged.

                                  JIM
                    I know that, Frank. And you already know 
                    that I fired the gun.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    No offense, but you say you fired the gun. 
                    I believe you, but I don't know. Maybe 
                    you're saying you fired the gun to protect 
                    someone else.

                                  JIM
                    I fired the gun.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    After the test, we'll have proof that what 
                    you say is true. It's important, in a case 
                    like this to be sure, absolutely sure, 
                    about every single element.

                                  JIM
                    Right.

      JIM sits, watches as Crime Lab TECHNICIAN puts a thimble-
      like instrument, the "dabber", on his own finger. He dabs 
      up and down JIM's hand, starting at the top of the 
      forefinger, then into the webbing between the forefinger 
      and thumb, making sure to cover the inside of the fingers 
      and the back of the hand. As he does, dabbing about a 
      hundred times, PEMBLETON and JIM talk.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    May I ask where you got the gun?

                                  JIM
                    I just bought it about a month ago. 
                    There've been a couple burglaries in our 
                      neighborhood. One couple got tied up. The 
                    wife was raped. I figured, these days, I'd 
                    better be prepared. I've never owned one 
                    before. Never even shot it before tonight.                                  PEMBLETON
                    Why'd you choose a forty-four?

                                  JIM
                    Teege picked it out for me. He knows guns.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Me, I would've had you buy a three fifty-
                    seven.

                                  JIM
                    Why?

                                  PEMBLETON
                      A forty-four is a big gun. No one needs a 
                    gun that big.

                                  JIM
                    What kind have you got there?
                            (indicates gun in 
                            Pembleton's holster)

                                  PEMBLETON
                    A nine millimeter Glock.

                                  JIM
                    Is that a good kind?

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Depends what you like. Some of the guys 
                    held onto their thirty-eights when the 
                      Department started issuing Glocks.

                                  JIM
                    But you like that one better?

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Holds more rounds in the clip. I'd rather 
                    have the fire power already loaded, just in 
                    case, y'know? Stopping power is greater, 
                    too.

                                  JIM
                    You mean impact?                                  PEMBLETON
                    Yeah, this gun discharges at nine hundred 
                    and ninety feet per second.

                                  JIM
                    That's fast...
                            (looks away, lost in 
                            thought)
                    I bought the gun so that my family would 
                    feel safe. It's funny... When I was a kid, 
                    we never even locked our front door.

      The Crime Lab TECHNICIAN puts the dabber into a plastic 
      ziplock bag.

      INT. GIARDELLO'S OFFICE/HOMICIDE UNIT - NIGHT

      AL GIARDELLO works at his desk. BAYLISS enters without 
      knocking.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Gee, I want to be in the "The Box" when 
                    Pembleton interrogates my cousin.

      GIARDELLO looks up, takes off his glasses.

                                    BAYLISS (CONT.)
                    I know that it's the first rule drilled 
                    into us at the Academy -- when a relative's 
                    involved we have to stay out -- but I think 
                    I should be given a little leeway here. 
                    He's gonna have to face Pembleton and we've 
                    all seen what Pembleton can do to somebody 
                    in that Box. So I'm asking you, Gee, let me 
                    be there for my cousin.

                                  GIARDELLO
                    We have to do this by the book, so that 
                    there are no questions later.

                                    BAYLISS
                    You're saying no?

                                  GIARDELLO
                    I'm saying no.

      BAYLISS turns to go.                                  GIARDELLO (CONT.)
                    You can watch from the Observation Room.

      BAYLISS nods.

                                  GIARDELLO (CONT.)
                      I promise, we'll do right by him.

      BAYLISS exits.

      INT. SQUAD ROOM/HOMICIDE UNIT - NIGHT

      BAYLISS crosses to "The Box", looks inside.

      BAYLISS POV: JIM sits opposite PEMBLETON and BOLANDER. 
      They're laughing.

      BAYLISS stops, takes a breath, crosses to Observation Room.

      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/HOMICIDE UNIT - NIGHT

      JIM sits opposite PEMBLETON and BOLANDER.

                                  BOLANDER
                    So, you and Tim were big basketball stars, 
                    huh?

                                  JIM
                    We were the two tallest guys in our school. 
                    We also grew up playing hoop together in 
                    his backyard so we knew each other's moves.

                                  BOLANDER
                    You ever think about turning pro?

                                  JIM
                    Naw. We were okay -- for white guys... 
                    Besides I needed to keep my grades up. I 
                    had to study if I wanted to get into a good 
                    law school.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Jim --
                            (smiles)
                    I know you told the uniforms, when they 
                    first arrived at your house, what happened. 
                    But sometimes, so near the actual event, 
                                  (MORE)                                  PEMBLETON (CONT'D)
                    people get caught up, y'know, and they 
                    leave things out. Now that you've had a 
                    chance to, to, relax, I'd like you to -- 
                    and take as much time as you need -- to 
                    tell us exactly, step-by step, what 
                      transpired.

                                  JIM
                    Sure... How far back do you want me to 
                    start?

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Wherever. You tell us.

                                  JIM
                      Alright... I was in the den, playing with 
                    my kids...

      On JIM, remembering,

      FLASH BACK TO:

      INT. DEN/JIM BAYLISS HOME - EARLY EVENING

      JIM bounces his three year old DAUGHTER around. His six 
      year old SON tugs at his knee.

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    The doorbell rang. Shannon called from the 
                    living room, said she'd get it.

      JIM swings his DAUGHTER, who SQUEALS with laughter.

                                  JIM (V.O.) (CONT.)
                    I'd been working a lot lately. This was the 
                    first change I'd had in a while to spend 
                    with the kids.

      O.C., HEAR SHANNON SCREAM.

                                  JIM (V.O.) (CONT.)
                    All of a sudden, Shannon screamed. So I 
                    went running.

      JIM is up and out of the room.      INT. HALLWAY/JIM BAYLISS HOME - EARLY EVENING

      JIM meets SHANNON halfway.

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    Shannon was yelling about this weirdo at 
                    the front door.

      JIM leads SHANNON to Den, pushes her inside, closes door.                                        ACT TWO

                                                                              FADE IN:

      INT. "THE BOX"/HOMICIDE UNIT - NIGHT

      SHANNON sits opposite PEMBLETON and BOLANDER.

                                  BOLANDER
                    Shannon, we'd like you tell us exactly what 
                    you remember. Don't leave anything out, no 
                    matter how trivial may seem.

      PULL BACK to REVEAL BAYLISS in Observation Room.

                                    SHANNON
                    Jim is a good man. A good husband. A good, 
                    a great father.

                                  BOLANDER
                    No one's attacking his character.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    We need to hear what happened.

                                    SHANNON
                    I'm not sure that what I remember is what 
                      happened...

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Where were you when the doorbell rang?

                                    SHANNON
                    In the kitchen, cleaning up.

      On SHANNON, nervous,

      FLASH BACK TO:

      INT. KITCHEN/JIM BAYLISS HOME - EARLY EVENING

      SHANNON puts the last plate in the dishwasher, turns it on.

                                  PEMBLETON (V.O.)
                    Where was your husband?                                    SHANNON (V.O.)
                    In the den. Working, I guess.

                                  PEMBLETON (V.O.)
                    Where were your children?

                                    SHANNON (V.O.)
                    I'd just put the baby down for the night. I 
                    don't know where the other two were. No, 
                    wait, maybe they were with Jim...

                                  PEMBLETON (V.O.)
                    It's not important. Go on.

      The doorbell RINGS.

                                    SHANNON (V.O.)
                    I heard the bell. It rang a couple times. I 
                    figured Jim wasn't going to get it, so I 
                    went.

      She crosses out.

      INT. LIVING ROOM/JIM BAYLISS HOME - EARLY EVENING

      SHANNON goes to front door, opens it, revealing GERSEL.

                                    SHANNON (V.O.)
                    This young man was standing there, with 
                    white makeup on. At first, I was startled, 
                    so I let out this yelp. He was laughing and 
                    dancing and singing some song. But in a 
                    foreign language. I asked him what he 
                    wanted and he kept talking in this odd 
                    language. So, I said, "Wait a moment, I'll 
                    get my husband" and I shut the door.

      SHANNON shuts door.

                                    SHANNON (V.O.) (CONT.)
                    He started knocking on the door and 
                    laughing and singing again.

      She exits.

      INT. HALLWAY/JIM BAYLISS HOME - EARLY EVENING

      SHANNON crosses to Den.                                  BOLANDER (V.O.)
                    Did he seem to be on drugs?

                                    SHANNON (V.O.)
                    Yes. Maybe.

      JIM comes out of Den as she approaches.

                                    SHANNON (V.O.) (CONT.)
                    I told Jim what was going on. We went back 
                    to the living room.

                                  BOLANDER (V.O.)
                    You went back to the front door with him?

      JIM and SHANNON exit.

      INT. LIVING ROOM/JIM BAYLISS HOME - EARLY EVENING

      JIM and SHANNON enter.

                                    SHANNON (V.O.)
                    Yes. Well, he went to the front door. I 
                    stayed back aways.

      She stands in archway between Hall and Living Room. JIM 
      opens door.

                                    SHANNON (V.O.) (CONT.)
                    Jim tried to figure out what the young man 
                    wanted. But he was being so silly and loud 
                    and aggressive, that Jim finally lost his 
                    patience.

      With both hands, JIM shoves GERSEL, who falls backwards 
      onto sidewalk. JIM SLAMS door.

                                    SHANNON (V.O.) (CONT.)
                    But the young man wouldn't go away. He kept 
                    knocking and knocking, yelling and singing. 
                    That's when I went back to check on the 
                    kids. I suddenly got very worried about 
                    them. We've been having some problems in 
                    our area.

      INT. HALLWAY/JIM BAYLISS HOME - EARLY EVENING

      SHANNON walks toward Den.                                    SHANNON (V.O.)
                    I was walking down the hall and -- this is 
                    inane, but -- the floorboards squeaked. I 
                    remember thinking about how the floor was 
                      squeaking, when all of a sudden I heard --

      ECU of SHANNON's face. On the SOUND of the gun BLAST,

      FLASH FORWARD

      TO:

      INT. "THE BOX"/HOMICIDE UNIT - NIGHT

      ECU of SHANNON's face.

                                    SHANNON
                    I'll never forget that sound. It echoed 
                    through our house. It shook the house, like 
                    an earthquake...

                                  PEMBLETON
                    From what you're saying, the situation at 
                    the door was tense but explosive. How did 
                    things escalate so fast?

                                    SHANNON
                    Jim can get very frustrated by people who 
                    don't speak English well. He always says 
                    that the taxi cab drivers in Baltimore only 
                    know their way around Beirut.

      PEMBLETON rubs his hand across his bald head.

                                  BOLANDER
                    Well, uh, thank you.

                                    SHANNON
                    I'm done?

                                  BOLANDER
                    You're done. I'll have an officer drive you 
                    home.                                    SHANNON
                    If you don't mind, I'd rather wait for my 
                    husband.

      BOLANDER turns from SHANNON to PEMBLETON, then back to 
      SHANNON. BOLANDER smiles his friendliest smile.

                                  BOLANDER
                    No problem.

      SHANNON rises.

      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/HOMICIDE UNIT - NIGHT

      BAYLISS watches SHANNON and BOLANDER exit. KAY HOWARD 
      enters, carrying a cup of coffee. BAYLISS turns to face 
      her. HOWARD offers cup.

                                  HOWARD
                    Thought you could use this.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Thanks.
                            (sips)
                    It's black.

                                  HOWARD
                    I wasn't sure how you take it.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Usually with a little cream.

                                  HOWARD
                    Oh. Sorry. You want me to get you some 
                    cream?

                                    BAYLISS
                    No.

      BAYLISS turns, looks back into "The Box". Howard exits.

      INT. "THE BOX"/HOMICIDE UNIT - NIGHT

      PEMBLETON and BOLANDER sit opposite SCHOLTZ, still wearing 
      whiteface and leather jacket.                                  BOLANDER
                    You were friends with Hikmet and Gersel.

                                    SCHOLTZ
                    Yes, he goes to my high school... He came 
                    in this past September.

      PULL BACK to REVEAL BAYLISS in Observation Room.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    You two were going to a party tonight?

                                    SCHOLTZ
                    A Kiss party.

                                  BOLANDER
                    What is that? A make-out party?

                                    SCHOLTZ
                    Kiss, the rock group? This is the way they 
                    used to dress. A bunch of us are hardcore 
                    Kiss fans. Hikmet thought Gene Simmons was 
                    the coolest. One of the girls in our school 
                    decided to have a costume party... Do you 
                    think I could get a towel? The makeup is 
                    starting to cake. I'd like to take it off.

      BOLANDER rises, calls out door.

                                  BOLANDER
                    Can we get a towel, please?

      BOLANDER closes door, sits.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    So you're going to this party...

                                    SCHOLTZ
                    We got lost. We thought we were on Hickory 
                    Lane, not Hickory Avenue.

      On SCHOLTZ, remembering,

      FLASH BACK TO:

      EXT. HICKORY AVENUE/ROLAND PARK - EARLY EVENING

      Pick-up truck drives along.                                    SCHOLTZ (V.O.)
                    Hikmet was really excited about going to 
                    the party.

      The pick-up stops in middle of street.

      INT. PICK-UP TRUCK/HICKORY AVENUE - EARLY EVENING

      GERSEL and SCHOLTZ sit side-by-side. GERSEL points to 
      house.

                                    SCHOLTZ (V.O.)
                    We were so happy when we finally found the 
                    place. Hikmet couldn't wait, he jumped out 
                    of the truck.

      GERSEL leaps out. SCHOLTZ laughs.

      EXT. HICKORY AVENUE/ROLAND PARK - EARLY EVENING

      GERSEL runs up to the house.

                                    SCHOLTZ (V.O.)
                    I drove around the corner to park.

      Pick-up pulls away.

      INT. PICK-UP TRUCK/HICKORY AVENUE - EARLY EVENING

      SCHOLTZ drives with one hand, pulls out bottle of Jack 
      Daniels.

                                    SCHOLTZ (V.O.)
                    I... Hikmet and I had both been drinking. A 
                    lot.

      SCHOLTZ parks.

      EXT. HICKORY AVENUE/ROLAND PARK - EARLY EVENING

      SCHOLTZ exits pick-up, crosses to bushes.

                                    SCHOLTZ (V.O.)
                    And I suddenly got sick.

      On SCHOLTZ, leaning over, puking,      TIME CUT TO:

      EXT. JIM BAYLISS HOME/HICKORY AVENUE - EARLY EVENING

      SCHOLTZ walks across street.

                                    SCHOLTZ (V.O.)
                    I was crossing the street when I saw Hikmet 
                    standing at the front door of the house. 
                    And a guy in the doorway was holding a gun. 
                    They were both yelling loud. The guy aimed 
                    the gun at Hikmet's chest, Hikmet put his 
                    hand's up. Then the guy --

      ECU of SCHOLTZ's face. On the SOUND of the gun BLAST,

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. "THE BOX"/HOMICIDE UNIT - NIGHT

      ECU of SCHOLTZ, who wipes his face with towel.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Hikmet had his hands up?

                                    SCHOLTZ
                    Yes, sir.

      PEMBLETON turns to BOLANDER. SCHOLTZ finished wiping off 
      the makeup. Underneath is a sweet-faced teenager.

                                    SCHOLTZ (CONT.)
                    I think I'd better call my mom.

      BOLANDER nods.

      INT. GIARDELLO'S OFFICE/HOMICIDE UNIT - NIGHT

      GIARDELLO sits, as BAYLISS and PEMBLETON face off.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    He held up his hands.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Says who? That little freak? He was across 
                    the street, in the dark. And drunk. 
                                  (MORE)                                    BAYLISS (CONT'D)
                    You gonna believe his word over my cousin?

                                  PEMBLETON
                    The law says a homeowner is justified in 
                    using lethal force if he perceives a threat 
                    to his life or the lives of his family. If 
                    Hikmet Gersel had his hands up, then we've 
                    got a whole lot more going on here than 
                      justifiable homicide.

                                    BAYLISS
                    What're you saying, Frank, that my cousin 
                    murdered the kid?

                                  PEMBLETON
                    I'm saying I got three different versions 
                    of the same story. I can understand 
                    Scholtz's version being different from 
                    Jim's, but not his own wife's.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Shannon's a great girl, but she's a little 
                    flaky.

                                  PEMBLETON
                          (to GIARDELLO)
                    I want another crack at Jim.

                                    BAYLISS
                    C'mon, Gee, it's nearly midnight. Let me 
                    take him home. Let him get some rest. 
                    Whatever else you need, you get in the 
                    morning.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    You let him walk out now, we lose whatever 
                    chance we have of finding the truth.

                                    BAYLISS
                    We already know the truth.

                                  GIARDELLO
                            (rises)
                    Go ahead with the interview, Frank.

      PEMBLETON exits. BAYLISS rages.                                    BAYLISS
                    I know what this is about. You and he have 
                    always had this father-son thing going. You 
                    have always favored him over me.

                                  GIARDELLO
                    What're you talking about?

                                    BAYLISS
                    You know exactly what I'm talking about.

                                  GIARDELLO
                    What? You mean because you're white?

                                    BAYLISS
                    Bingo.

                                  GIARDELLO
                    That's not true.

                                    BAYLISS
                    It is true, whether you want to admit it to 
                    yourself or not.

                                  GIARDELLO
                    Listen to me: When the sun comes up on this 
                    shooting, I'm going to have -- not just the 
                    bosses and the media on my ass -- but the 
                    boys in Washington, the Turkish Embassy. We 
                    have the potential here for an 
                      international incident.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Oh, I see, this is all about saving your 
                    ass --

                                  GIARDELLO
                    Careful, Bayliss --

                                    BAYLISS
                    Eat me, Gee.

                                  GIARDELLO
                    I'm gonna let that pass, Bayliss. Now get 
                    out.

      BAYLISS turns and goes.      INT. "THE BOX"/HOMICIDE UNIT - NIGHT

      PEMBLETON and BOLANDER stand watching as JIM enters, 
      cuffed, escorted by UNIFORM.

                                  BOLANDER
                    Take those handcuffs off.

      UNIFORM obliges.

                                  BOLANDER (CONT.)
                    Everybody been treating you okay?

                                  JIM
                    Yes.

                                  BOLANDER
                    You want something to eat or drink? You 
                    hungry?

                                  JIM
                    No, thanks. I never eat this late.

                                  BOLANDER
                    That's probably wise. For me, about this 
                    time of night, all I want is a bag of Utz.

      UNIFORM exits. BOLANDER sits.

                                  BOLANDER (CONT.)
                    Have a seat.

      JIM sits.

                                  JIM
                    You've got more questions?

                                  BOLANDER
                    I don't. Frank does.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Well, y'know how it is, you think you've 
                    asked every possible question, then 
                    suddenly you go, "What an idiot I am. I 
                    forgot about this or that"...                                  JIM
                    Like what?

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Hikmet Gersel, that's the name of the boy 
                    you shot. Since last fall, he's been an 
                    exchange student at Polytech High School. 
                    That's not far from your house. You ever 
                    see him before?

                                  JIM
                    No.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    At the supermarket? The mall?

                                  JIM
                    No.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Okay, good.

                                  BOLANDER
                    You said that when Hikmet came to your door 
                    you were afraid he might be a burglar.

                                  JIM
                    That's right.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    In your experience, do burglars usually 
                    come and ring the front doorbell?

                                  JIM
                    These days, who knows? Just when I think 
                    I've heard about the most twisted perverted 
                    crime possible, the morning paper delivers 
                    a more twisted, more perverted one on my 
                    doorstep. My law firm has dockets full of 
                    crimes that make no sense.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    You told us that you said to Hikmet, "Get 
                    away fro here," then "Get away from my 
                    house," and finally, "Get away."                                  JIM
                    Uh-huh.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Were those the only words you said to him?

                                  JIM
                    No, I'm sure I said a lot more, like, "What 
                    do you want?"

                                  BOLANDER
                    When you brought out the gun did you say 
                    anything?

                                  JIM
                    Yes, I think I said, "Back off or I'll 
                    shoot," something like that.

                                  BOLANDER
                    Did Hikmet respond?

                                  JIM
                    He was muttering away, I couldn't 
                      understand him.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Did you know he was speaking a foreign 
                    language.

                                  JIM
                    For all I know he was on PCP. He was 
                    talking in a singsong kid of way. Real 
                    crazy.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    You had no idea he was speaking in a 
                    foreign language?

                                  JIM
                    He said some words in English that didn't 
                    make sense.

                                  BOLANDER
                    Like what?                                  JIM
                    Something like, "That's the kind of sugar 
                    Pappa likes."

                                  BOLANDER
                    When you pointed the gun at him, did he do 
                    anything?

                                  JIM
                    He laughed this bizarre laugh, then he 
                    tried to grab it. I told you that already.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    He laughed because he thought you were 
                    joking?

                                  JIM
                    I don't know what he was thinking, you'd 
                    have to ask him.

                                  PEMBLETON
                      Unfortunately, I can't...

                                  JIM
                    What the hell is that supposed to mean? 
                    Look, I've been straight with you guy since 
                    the start. If you're accusing me of 
                      something, come out and say it. Quit the 
                    games.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    We're not here to judge you, Jim, we're 
                    simply trying to get the clearest possible 
                    picture of what went on. We don't decide 
                    right or wrong. Only you know whether or 
                    not you did something wrong. If there's 
                    anything you're holding back, anything 
                    you'd like to get off your chest --

      SOUND of BANGING, coming from the other side of the mirror.

      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/HOMICIDE UNIT - NIGHT

      BAYLISS stands, BANGING on glass. PEMBLETON turns, stares 
      into the Observation Room. BAYLISS stops.      INT. "THE BOX"/HOMICIDE UNIT - NIGHT

      PEMBLETON turns back to JIM and BOLANDER.

                                  BOLANDER
                    Can you do me a favor? Can you show me how 
                    he reached for the gun? Stand up and show 
                    me.

                                  JIM
                    I...

                                  BOLANDER
                            (stands)
                    C'mon, please. I'll be you. You be the kid.

      JIM stands.

                                  BOLANDER (CONT.)
                    Okay.
                            (mimes gun)
                    I've got the gun. What does he do? Act it 
                    out.

      JIM raises one arm to reach for the imaginary gun.

                                  JIM
                    Like that. But quicker.

                                  BOLANDER
                    I see. Okay. Let me do it. You be you.

      JIM mimes the gun. BOLANDER reaches for it, holds both arms 
      up as if to surrender, then grabs gun.

                                  BOLANDER (CONT.)
                    Like that?

                                  JIM
                    This arm was lower. Like this.

      He brings both of BOLANDER's arms up, but keeps one lower.

                                  BOLANDER
                    Thanks. I see now, yeah. Please, sit down.

      Beat. PEMBLETON opens a file.                                  PEMBLETON
                    Your youngest brother, Kurt, was in Kuwait, 
                    right? During the Persian Gulf war?

                                  JIM
                    Yes.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    He got shot, he died.

                                  JIM
                    Yes.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    How did that make you feel?

                                  JIM
                    You are a bright guy, Detective, how do you 
                    think it made me feel?

      More BANGING on mirror from BAYLISS, then silence.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    You said earlier that you'd never had cuffs 
                    on before tonight. Yet I found a prior -- 
                      aggravated assault.

                                  JIM
                    I wasn't arrested per se. Teege took into 
                    the Police Station

                                  PEMBLETON
                    What had happened?

                                  JIM
                    I was drinking in those days. We were in a 
                    bar. Some punk said something I didn't 
                      appreciate, I let him have it.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    This punk was named Parviz Nejhat. He was 
                    Iranian.

      Another BANG.                                  JIM
                    What's your point?

                                  PEMBLETON
                    My point, Jim, is why -- after you closed 
                    the door in Gersel's face -- why didn't you 
                    just call the cops? Why was your first 
                    impulse to get the gun? Why was your only 
                    impulse to shoot the boy?

      JIM reacts. A SERIES of BANGS -- harder and harder. 
      Suddenly, the mirror EXPLODES, shattering all over the 
      floor. BAYLISS stands on the other side. On PEMBLETON, 
      facing BAYLISS,

                                                                            FADE OUT.                                      ACT THREE

                                                                              FADE IN:

      INT. BALLISTICS/POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

      SOUND of a gun BLAST, REVEAL WESTMORELAND MAXWELL test 
      firing Jim's revolver. REVEAL PEMBLETON, BAYLISS and 
      Assistant State's Attorney ED DANVERS watching. MAXWELL 
      approaches them.

                                    MAXWELL
                    The bullet that killed Hikmet Gersel was 
                      definitely fired from this gun.

                                    BAYLISS
                    We already knew that.
                          (to PEMBLETON)
                    Or are you thinking that Jim shot the kid 
                    then switched guns? Surrendered a different 
                    gun? What kind of case are you trying to 
                    build here?

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Bayliss, why don't you go break some more 
                    windows.
                          (to DANVERS)
                    Does he have to be here?

                                    DANVERS
                    I don't think we're compromising anything 
                    by his presence. Go on.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Okay. Theoretically,a woman can lead a man 
                    on, go up to his room, take off her 
                    clothes, jump into bed -- it becomes rape 
                    the moment she says stop. Jim may have 
                    feared for his life at some point during 
                    the confrontation, but he wasn't afraid at 
                    the moment he fired the fatal bullet.

                                    BAYLISS
                    He made a bad judgment call. You're gonna 
                    crucify him for making a mistake?                                  PEMBLETON
                    This is more than a bad judgment call. He 
                    killed Gersel for some other reason.

                                    DANVERS
                    What other reason?

                                  PEMBLETON
                    I think it's racially motivated.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Why does that not surprise me, Frank? Why 
                    am I not stunned that you've unearthed yet 
                    another racial injustice?

                                  PEMBLETON
                    I guess you know me too well, Tim.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Danvers, will you put a stop to this 
                    nonsense?

                                    DANVERS
                    I could deem the incident accidental, a 
                      misunderstanding established by 
                      circumstances. I could decide that the 
                    suspect not be charged. But I'm not sure I 
                    should take on the burden of 
                      determination... I'm going to recommend we 
                    go before a Grand Jury --

                                    BAYLISS
                    On what charge?

                                    DANVERS
                      Manslaugter.

                                    BAYLISS
                    What? Why?

                                    DANVERS
                    Because you're a cop. Because your cousin's 
                    white. I don't want it to look like we're 
                    showing any favoritism.                                    BAYLISS
                    Oh, I see. In an effort not to show 
                      favoritism, Jim's being overly prosecuted.

      BAYLISS walks away. On DANVERS, turning to PEMBLETON,

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. HOLDING CELL/POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

      JIM sits, cramped together with two PRISONERS. BAYLISS 
      enters, followed by TURNKEY, who opens cell door.

                                  JIM
                    Man, I'm glad this is all over.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Jim... It's a lot of bull, but there are 
                    some unanswered questions --

                                  JIM
                    What're you talking about?

                                    BAYLISS
                    The State's Attorney is putting the case 
                    before a Grand Jury.

                                  JIM
                    You're not serious. I thought the creep was 
                    going to hurt my wife --

                                    BAYLISS
                    What can I say? Everybody's trying to cover 
                      themselves.

                                  JIM
                    Jeez...

                                    BAYLISS
                    C'mon, we'll talk about this on the ride 
                    home. We just gotta go down to the Court 
                      Commissioner's Office to sign you out.

      TURNKEY takes out handcuffs.                                  JIM
                    No. He's not putting those on me again.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Jim --

                                  JIM
                    Teege, man, I'm telling you, you don't know 
                    what it's like wearing those things -- it's 
                    like you have no control, it's like they 
                    can do anything they want to you.

                                    BAYLISS
                          (to TURNKEY)
                    Can't we lose these?

                                    TURNKEY
                    You know the rules.

                                    BAYLISS
                    I'll be right with him. I'll be 
                      responsible.

                                    TURNKEY
                    You gonna be responsible to feed my kid 
                    when I lose this job?

      TURNKEY grabs JIM's wrist. JIM flings the TURNKEY's hand 
      off.

                                  JIM
                    Get away from me. I'm warning you -

                                    BAYLISS
                    Hold on --

      TURNKEY grabs JIM. PRISONERS start CHEERING, WHISTLING, as 
      JIM deftly pushes TURNKEY, who falls hard to the floor. 
      From behind, BAYLISS wraps his arms around JIM, who pushes 
      him back into cell. JIM turns, out of control, facing 
      BAYLISS, who is calm. They peer into each other's eyes.

                                    BAYLISS (CONT.)
                    Trust me, Jimmy, this is the only way out.

      JIM's rage diminishes. He looks around, sees TURNKEY 
      getting up.                                  JIM
                    I'm sorry.

      He holds out his wrists to be cuffed. On the cuffs 
      tightening around JIM's wrists again,

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. SQUAD ROOM/HOMICIDE UNIT - NIGHT

      HOWARD and LEWIS work at their desks as MUNCH enters, 
      depressed.

                                  MUNCH
                    Well, I did it. I fired Henri. I've never 
                    had to fire anyone before. I hate being a 
                    boss.

                                  LEWIS
                    He took it badly, huh?

                                  MUNCH
                    He stared at me with those sad, sweet, 
                    Gaulish eyes, so full of hope, so eager to 
                    please... But I didn't beat around the bus. 
                    I told him, flat out, "Mon aim, vous tees 
                    through."

                                  LEWIS
                    What'd he do?

                                  MUNCH
                    That's the incredible thing -- he simply 
                    held out his colander to me and left. What 
                    dignity. What grace.

                                  LEWIS
                    Well, the good news is -- I hired us a 
                    cook. Not a chef. A cook. She starts 
                    tomorrow.

                                  MUNCH
                    Where'd you find someone so fast?                                  LEWIS
                    In my own backyard. Literally. I hired my 
                      grandmother.

                                  MUNCH
                    Your grandmother?

                                  LEWIS
                    My grandmother.

                                  MUNCH
                    We went from employing Henri de Segonzac, a 
                    graduate of Le Cordon Blue, to Granny 
                    Lewis?

                                  LEWIS
                    She's spent the past twelve years making 
                    hash at Down Home Soul Cooking. She has, 
                    what we call, a following.

                                  MUNCH
                    I love her to death.

      PEMBLETON and BOLANDER enter.

                                  HOWARD
                    Hey, what's the latest on Tim's cousin?

                                  PEMBLETON
                    I'm going home.

      PEMBLETON gets his things. BOLANDER moves to MUNCH, HOWARD 
      and LEWIS.

                                  BOLANDER
                    Danvers is sending the case to the Grand 
                    Jury.

                                  MUNCH
                    Lovely.

                                  LEWIS
                    How's Tim about that?

      PEMBLETON SLAMS desk drawer, exits. LEWIS calls after him.                                  LEWIS (CONT.)
                      Nevermind.

      BOLANDER sits at his desk, depressed.

                                  MUNCH
                    What's the matter, Big Man?

                                  BOLANDER
                    Am I the only one around here who thinks we 
                    are having an incredibly tough year? Am I 
                    the only one who thinks that God or Fate or 
                    the Furies, whoever deals out the cards, 
                    keeps dealing off the bottom of the deck? 
                    Lewis loses a partner, I get a bullet in 
                    the brain, Kay gets one in the heart and 
                    you, Munch, you had that incredibly dumbass 
                    idea about buying the restaurant...

                                  MUNCH
                      I wouldn't say it was dumbass, exactly.

                                  BOLANDER
                    You and me, we argue all the time. But 
                    never about the big stuff. Pembleton and 
                    Bayliss, this thing with Jim, this is big, 
                    this is ugly. I don't know how two partners 
                    could ever come back from something like 
                    this...

      With that, BOLANDER goes to work. On LEWIS, HOWARD and 
      MUNCH exchanging a glance,

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. TIM BAYLISS' CAR - CONTINUOUS

      BAYLISS drives, JIM sits in passenger seat, SHANNON is in 
      back.

                                  JIM
                    My name was Captain Lightning.

                                    BAYLISS
                    I was Zapman.                                    SHANNON
                    You guys were how old?

                                  JIM
                    None of us had hit puberty.

                    What was Kurt's super identity?

                                    BAYLISS
                    Ultra King.

                                  JIM
                    Ultra King, right.

                                    SHANNON
                    You obviously had been reading too many 
                    comic books.

                                  JIM
                    We decided to dedicate ourselves to 
                    fighting crime. Real crimes. We were very 
                    serious about it. Even set up a kind of 
                    Batcave in our garage.

                                    BAYLISS
                    We'd run around the neighborhood, with 
                    beach towels tucked into the neck of our 
                    shirts, jumping off porches and stuff, 
                    looking for criminals.

                                    SHANNON
                    You ever find any?

                                  JIM
                    No. Though we did beat the snot out of this 
                    Jap kid. We thought he was a spy.

                                    SHANNON
                    How long did you boys keep fighting crime?

                                  JIM
                    'Til my dad died.

      JIM looks out window.

      JIM's POV: His house coming up.                                  JIM (CONT.)
                    Then all the fun and games stopped.

      JIM focuses on the house, as BAYLISS pulls into driveway.

      EXT. JIM BAYLISS HOME/HICKORY AVENUE - NIGHT

      The Car pulls into driveway. BAYLISS, JIM and SHANNON get 
      out. The driveway and lawn are a mess -- trampled through, 
      paper strewn. They walk to front door. JIM stops.

      JIM's POV: The chalk line around the body of Gersel; inside 
      the circle are the remains of his blood and guts.

                                  JIM (CONT.)
                      I would've though you cops would clean up 
                    after yourselves.

                                    BAYLISS
                    That's not our job. I'll bet the inside of 
                    the house is a mess, too.

                                  JIM
                    Y'know, you could start a company, a 
                    cleaning company. After the cops leave the 
                    scene of a crime, they come in, clean up 
                      everything.

                                    BAYLISS
                    In Balto, you'd make a fortune.

                                    SHANNON
                    I'm going to check on the kids, send my 
                    folks home.

      SHANNON faces JIM, who's staring at the chalk line.

                                    SHANNON (CONT.)
                    You should go to bed.

      JIM nods, still staring. SHANNON kisses BAYLISS.

                                    SHANNON (CONT.)
                    Thank you.                                    BAYLISS
                    Hey...

      SHANNON goes into house. BAYLISS puts his palm on JIM's 
      shoulder. Beat. JIM turns to him. Without thinking, they 
      hug each other -- a spontaneous act of forgiveness, 
      comfort, support.

                                    BAYLISS (CONT.)
                    Shannon's right, you should get some sleep.

                                  JIM
                    In a minute.

      JIM crosses to side of house, gets hose. He turns on 
      spigot. He crosses back to front door. He turns down the 
      nozzle, water spews forth. He starts hosing down the 
      sidewalk, washing away the chalk line, the blood, the guts.

                                  JIM (CONT.)
                    Who'd've thought his guts would be the same 
                    color as ours...

      BAYLISS reacts. On the TWO of THEM watching the blood and 
      guts flow in a stream to the curb,

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. BEDROOM/PEMBLETON APARTMENT - NIGHT

      MARY WHELAN-PEMBLETON lies sleeping. PEMBLETON enters. 
      Trying not to wake her, he tip-toes around. He bumps into 
      chair.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Owh.

      MARY wakes up, startled.

                                  MARY
                    Oh jeez, Frank --

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Sorry, Mary.                                  MARY
                    I thought it was a burglar.

                                  PEMBLETON
                            (kisses her)
                    Sorry.
                            (slips off his jacket)
                    What would you have done if it was?

                                  MARY
                    Was what?

                                  PEMBLETON
                      A burglar.

                                  MARY
                    I don't know. Wake you up.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    But I'm not always here, especially when 
                    I'm working the night shift. What would you 
                    do if someone broke in and you were alone?

                                  MARY
                    Scream. Hide. Pray.

                                  PEMBLETON
                            (takes off his gun)
                    Maybe I should get you one of these.

                                  MARY
                    One gun in the house is plenty, thanks.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Mary --

                                  MARY
                      Goodnight.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    I want you to be able to protect yourself.

                                  MARY
                    You give me a gun, I'm more likely to shoot 
                    myself in the foot.                                  PEMBLETON
                            (exits into Bathroom)
                    You're not afraid?

                                  MARY
                    Well, sure, I've got a healthy amount of 
                    fear. But choose to live in the City. That 
                    means a certain amount of risk. I could 
                    have a gun, an alarm system, big thick bars 
                    on the window, twelve locks on the door, by 
                    lying her all safe and sound -- and the 
                    ceiling could fall on my head.

      PEMBLETON comes out, ready for bed. He climbs in next to 
      MARY, kisses her.

                                  PEMBLETON
                      Goodnight.

                                  MARY
                    Oh no, you don't.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    What?

                                  MARY
                    You don't come in here, wake me out of a 
                    sound sleep, then turn the lights off 
                    unless you've got a lot more in mind than 
                    catching some Zs.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    I'm tired.

      MARY leans over, kisses him passionately.

                                  PEMBLETON (CONT.)
                    I just got my second wind.

      One the TWO of THEM, kissing,

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. GRAND JURY/MITCHELL COURTHOUSE - DAY

        Twenty-three average, ordinary CITIZENS sit on the Grand 
      Jury. DANVERS stands before them, explaining points of law.

                                    DANVERS
                    Your job, as a member of the Grand Jury, is 
                    not to judge guilt or innocence. Your sole 
                    purpose is to determine whether James 
                    Bayliss had criminal intent when he shot 
                    Hikmet Gersel. If you believe he did, the 
                    case will go to trial, where with due 
                    process of law in an open court, evidence 
                    will be weighed to establish guilt or 
                      innocence.

                    If you decide that James Bayliss was 
                    "placed in fear" and, therefore, not

                    Where do they find the jurors anyway? Who 
                    wants to be judged by idiots too dumb to 
                    beat the system?

                    If they're strongly anti-gun or, y'know, 
                    racially sensitive, they're more likely to 
                    indict. But as a rule, the Grand Jury 
                    usually tilts in favor of the homeowner.

                    wound to the chest, puncturing the left

                    I was the first to arrive at the scene. 
                    Mister Bayliss was genuinely upset. Very 
                      emotional.

      JIM looks up to see MISSUS GERSEL, a Turkish Woman about 
      his age.

                                  MISSUS GERSEL
                    I am Umut Gersel. Hikmet's mother.

                                  JIM
                    Oh. Ma'am, I am truly sorry about your 
                    loss.

                                  MISSUS GERSEL
                    My son, he loved everything American. 
                    Growing up, he'd watch your movies and TV 
                    shows and rock n' roll. But mostly he loved 
                    what America stood for. Many of us believe 
                    there is too much repression in my country. 
                    We are not allowed to think or move as 
                    freely as you are, but if that freedom 
                    means getting away with killing an innocent 
                    boy, perhaps we are better off...

      MISSUS GERSEL walks off. PEMBLETON tosses cigarette to 
      floor, stomps it out with t he toe of his shoe. He looks 
      over at BAYLISS. A beat between them. BAYLISS turns back 
      toward his cousin.

                                  PEMBLETON
                      Therefore, it is my opinion that Mister 
                    Gersel believed the gun was a toy, part of 
                    the heavy metal party he thought he was 
                      attending. In the spirit of play, he raised 
                    his hands in mock-surrender.

                    I keep seeing the look in Gersel's eyes 
                    right after I fired. And I'm wondering, did 
                    Kurt have the same look in his eyes?

                    Yes, of course.

                    Does Mister Bayliss have a history of

                    I'm sorry, you can't ask that. Y'see, even 
                    though Mister Bayliss' motivation may or 
                    may not have been racist, you must concern

                    You know what I remember the most about

                    everyone. How you were always somehow 
                      responsible. If I screwed up or Kurt got in 
                    trouble or if the team lost a game, you 
                    took the responsibility on your

                    There's a tried but true proverb: "A man's 
                    home is his castle"... The place you sleep 
                    and eat, the place where you read or watch 
                    TV, where you play with your children or 
                    make love... If you're lucky enough to have 
                    a home, you have the right to defend it. 
                    You have the right to make sure that your 
                    children are safe, that your wife, your 
                    husband, your long-time companion is safe. 
                    No one should ever be forced to flee from 
                    their own home. It is out ultimate 
                      sanctuary... Do I feel good about what I 
                    did? No. I will have to live with the 
                    horror of that split second for the rest of 
                    my life... Do I believe I did the right 
                    thing? Yes... Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. 
                    And I know that you know that given the

                    reason to fear for his safety and the

                    I thought you came up from D.C. to take me 
                    out to lunch, to celebrate my becoming a 
                    Captain. Instead, you complain about your

                    You've always bitched about every present

                    Al seems so earnest, but there's another 
                    side to him, isn't there?

                                  TIM
                    Well, maybe you're just not good at

                    think Senator Bob really has a shot in

                    Megan, I'm sorry I came up. It was a 
                    mistake.

                                    RUSSERT
                    Is this your way of telling me you have no 
                    reason to visit me anymore? Fine. Go play 
                    tennis with Hillary. Play golf with Quayle. 
                    Who am I? I'm no bigshot politico. I'm just 
                    a cousin.

                    Ah, a little family rivalry. I understand. 
                    I've got problems with a few of my

                    I have never played tennis with Hillary. 
                    And I don't play golf. I'm from Buffalo.

                                    RUSSERT
                    Poor baby, I don't know how you manage to 
                    get by.

                    Ya know that saying about "you're lovely 
                    when you're angry"? Well, you ain't.

                    with my cousin, Beau.

      RUSSERT exits into Squad Room. On FELTON, open-mouthed, 
      without a comeback,

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. SQUAD ROOM/HOMICIDE UNIT - DAY

      HOWARD, MUNCH, LEWIS, BAYLISS and BOLANDER sit back at 
      their desks. PEMBLETON writes "G-E-R-S-E-L" in BLACK on the 
      "The Board".

                                  MUNCH
                    Oh, boy. Lunch time. Let's head over to 
                    that fabulous restaurant, lip-smacking 
                    eats.

                                  LEWIS
                    Yeah, what a good idea. I heard they got a 
                    new cook.

                                  MUNCH
                    Is that right?

                                  LEWIS
                    Stan, you wanna join in a little noon 
                    repast?

                                  BOLANDER
                    No, thanks.

                                  LEWIS
                    Hey, Frank, what about you?

                                  PEMBLETON
                    I've got plans.

                                  LEWIS
                    Kay?                                  HOWARD
                    Been there, done that.

      GIARDELLO exits his Office.

                                  MUNCH
                    Gee, you hungry?

                                  GIARDELLO
                    Very. I'm just on my way out to eat.

                                  LEWIS
                    Then come on over to the Waterfront.

                                  GIARDELLO
                    Your place?

                                  MUNCH
                    Our place. We're having our mid week 
                    special -- All the Polynesian Pork Burgers 
                    you can eat -- eight ninety-nine.

                                  GIARDELLO
                    I'm in the mood for Soul.

                                  MUNCH
                    No problem. We've got smothered pork chop 
                    you could die for.

                                  GIARDELLO
                    Or die from. I already had ptomaine 
                    poisoning once this year.

      GIARDELLO exits. MUNCH and LEWIS are not amused. PHONE 
      RINGS. BOLANDER lifts receiver.

                                  BOLANDER
                      Homicide... Uh-huh... What's the address? 
                    Okay, we'll be right over.
                            (hangs up)
                    Munch, let's go.

                                  MUNCH
                    What've we got?                                  BOLANDER
                    Skeleton found buried in the basement of a 
                    house over on Gough Street. A couple's 
                      renovating the house, the contractor dug up 
                    bones. They're turning the cellar into a 
                    playroom.

                                  MUNCH
                    Nice.

                                  BOLANDER
                    My bet, the skeleton's at least a hundred 
                    years old.

                                  LEWIS
                    Why's that, Big Man?

                                  BOLANDER
                    Every year or so someone digs up bones in a 
                    basement in Fell's Point. It usually turns 
                    out to be some poor sailor who got a 
                    night's leave off some nineteenth century 
                    schooner docked in the harbor. The sailor 
                    came into town for a drink or some poker, 
                    got rolled for his pay, got stuffed in the 
                    basement. Meanwhile, up in Maine or England 
                    or even China, some young bride walked the 
                    shore, peering out into the sea, waiting 
                    her whole life for him to return.

                                  MUNCH
                    Jeez, Stanley, more and more I see the poet 
                    in you.

                                  BOLANDER
                    That ain't poetry, Munch. Them's the hard, 
                    cold facts.

                                  HOWARD
                    Life was simpler a hundred years ago.

                                  BOLANDER
                    Death was simpler.

      MUNCH and BOLANDER head out as BAYLISS rises, crosses to 
      PEMBLETON.                                    BAYLISS
                    You're not going to say anything to me, are 
                    you?

                                  PEMBLETON
                    What would you like me to say?

                                    BAYLISS
                    For a start, "I'm sorry"...

                                  PEMBLETON
                    I'm not sorry. I did my job.

                                    BAYLISS
                    You still believe that my cousin killed 
                    that boy because he was an Arab?

                                  PEMBLETON
                    Hikmet was not an Arab. Turks are not Arabs 
                    --

                                    BAYLISS
                    My cousin could not consciously kill 
                    someone.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    I don't think it was premeditated. I think 
                    it was inherent. Jim's racism is so much a 
                    part of him, that he didn't have a chance 
                    to think about what he was doing. Jim is 
                    worse than a Klansman. 'Cause at least in 
                    their white sheets, they are recognizable. 
                    But your cousin's brand of bigotry is more 
                      frightening because, like still water, it 
                    runs deep. He doesn't even see it himself.

                                    BAYLISS
                    You are wrong, dead wrong.

                                  PEMBLETON
                    The only one "dead wrong" is Hikmet Gersel. 
                    Did you see what happened when the verdict 
                    was announced? They applauded. Those law-
                    abiding citizens, those good people 
                    applauded the death of a child. Let me ask 
                    you something, Tim -- and then you tell me 
                                  (MORE)                                  PEMBLETON (CONT'D)
                    whether or not it was racially motivated -- 
                    if that boy had been American, if that boy 
                    had been white -- do you think anyone would 
                    have cheered?

      PEMBLETON sits down, goes to work. On BAYLISS, turning and 
      walking out,

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. DEN/JIM BAYLISS HOME - DAY

      JIM and BAYLISS watch basketball game on TV. JIM holds his 
      BABY, staring at him.

                                    BAYLISS
                    Webber was a great trade, huh? Bullets look 
                    like a new team.

      No response.

                                    BAYLISS (CONT.)
                    Jim?

                                  JIM
                    Huh?

                                    BAYLISS
                    What's going on?

                                  JIM
                    I don't know.
                            (re: the BABY)
                    I'm looking at little Kurt here and I'm... 
                    I don't know... I'm wondering about all the 
                    babies all over Baltimore, all across the 
                    country, all over the world...

                                    BAYLISS
                    What about 'em?

                                  JIM
                    I've been thinking about what you said, 
                    about me not taking responsibility for 
                    this. And I...
                            (exhales)
                                  (MORE)                                  JIM (CONT'D)
                    I loved my dad so much. When he died, all I 
                    wanted was to live my life the way he 
                    would've wanted me to, y'know, be 
                      responsible, be honest, take care of my 
                    mother. And Kurt...

                                    BAYLISS
                    I know what you're saying, you shot Gersel 
                    because, even as a kid, you had to be the 
                    man of the house, you had to defend your 
                    home.

                                  JIM
                    Yeah... Or maybe I shot him because the 
                    first time I ever heard the words "kike" 
                    and "nigger", it was from my dad's mouth... 
                    I'm not blaming Dad, it's just that...
                            (looks at the BABY)
                    I wonder -- no matter what I do for this 
                    baby -- someday, will he shoot someone 
                    else's baby?

                                    BAYLISS
                    I guess our job is not to let that happen. 
                    To try, not to let that happen. That's all 
                    we can do.

      Beat, as they turn back to the game. CHRIS WEBBER scores. 
      CHEERING.

                                  JIM
                    Do me a favor, will you?

                                    BAYLISS
                    Sure.

                                  JIM
                    Adjust the color. The green seems a little 
                    off.

      BAYLISS gets up to adjust the set. JIM rocks his BABY. On 
      JIM and BAYLISS, trying to make it through a complex world,

                                                                            FADE OUT.
