               Do not follow where the path may lead. Go, instead, 
                  where there is no path and leave a trail.

      EXT. FROZEN WILDS - DAY

      Camera looks skyward from under a frozen sheet of ice. 
      Tracking. Finding above: boots, legs, finally the whole of a 
      man. One BILL HASKELL, 20s. Bearded and freezing to death.

      He s lying prone atop a frozen river in the wickedest of 
      blizzards. Nothing but whiteness and death out there.  His 
      breaths come slow. Near death. Calmly, in v.o.:

                                  BILL (V.O.) 
                    You re looking at a rich man.

      A long beat as his life starts to ebb before our eyes...

                                  BILL (V.O.)
                    I wasn t that once.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      INT. MIDDLE CLASS HOUSE - NIGHT

      --young BILL HASKELL, 10. Middle class house. Standing before 
      a mirror in his bedroom, clad in Sunday s finest. He s 
      looking uncomfortably at himself as he holds a tie before his 
      throat. You get the impression the child s never even seen a 
      tie before. 

      Chyron:  Windham County, Vermont, 1887. 

      Camera drifts over, reveals through the window, coming up the 
      driveway, a HORSE & CARRIAGE. Something unsettling about that 
      to young Bill...

      INT. MIDDLE CLASS HOUSE / FOYER - CONTINUOUS

      His father, BENJAMIN HASKELL, on the first floor, has an 
      entirely different response. He straightens his own tie, eyes 
      the coming buggy, calls anxiously to his WIFE:

                                  BENJAMIN HASKELL
                    Look prim, Elizabeth. Is our boy 
                    ready? First impressions are 
                      everything. Everything dominoes 
                    from that first impression. I want 
                    him in a tie if he's not already--
                          (calling upstairs)
                    William!

      ANGLE. WILLIAM. In his room. This all too much, too 
        officious...

      ANGLE. FATHER. Surveying the glimmering appointments of the 
      buggy through the window:

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Good God, look at that buggy. What 
                    do you think something like that 
                    costs?                                                                                   2.


      ANGLE. BILL S MOTHER--ELIZABETH--ascending the stairs, 
      calling out to Bill--

                                  ELIZABETH HASKELL
                    William, Mr. Chandler's here--

      Following her as she steps into Bill s room. It s empty.

                                  ELIZABETH HASKELL (CONT D)
                    William?

      Her eyes falls across the window. It s open...

      EXT. VERMONT COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

      FIND Young Bill, running off through the darkness. Sans tie. 

      Running. Running. Til he finds a familiar haven. A towering 
      oak over a river. He knows this tree well. Where the 
      footholds are. He climbs deftly.

      Finds respite in the boughs. Sits there. Catches his breath.  

      We are with him for a beat. This place: his hideout, refuge. 
      And whatever was back there...was not what he wanted.

      After a moment, he senses a presence. Someone else in the 
      tree. A few boughs up. Silhouetted there: another boy. Young 
      BYRON EPSTEIN, also 10. 

      They sit there in silence together. You get the sense they ve 
      done this a lot over the years. Finally:

                                  YOUNG BILL
                    They're sending me to boarding 
                    school. I didn't think they were 
                    actually going to do it--

                                  YOUNG EPSTEIN
                    What's at boarding school?

                                  YOUNG BILL
                    They keep saying it's gonna get me 
                    manners. 

                                  YOUNG EPSTEIN
                    You got a shit-ton of manners.

                                  YOUNG BILL
                    They say it's gonna get me prepared 
                    for preparatory school.

                                  YOUNG EPSTEIN
                    Isn't that what prep school's for? 
                    To prepare you? For whatever it is 
                    you're supposed to be prepared for?

                                  YOUNG BILL
                    College.                                                                                   3.


                                  YOUNG EPSTEIN (INCREDULOUS)
                    You're 10. 

                                  YOUNG BILL (SURVEYS RIVER) 
                    Doesn't matter. Everyone's doing it 
                    earlier and earlier now. And my 
                    dad, if there's one thing he hates, 
                    it's being left behind.

                                  YOUNG EPSTEIN
                    But it's not about him--

      Bill gives him a knowing look.

                                  YOUNG BILL
                    It's not about me.
                          (considers the night)
                    Feel like I'm in a box. Locked up 
                    in my own life. Without a key.

                                  YOUNG EPSTEIN
                    No way. Me and you...we're free. 
                    Look at us. They can put you in 
                    school for a bit, but that ends. Me 
                    and you, the world can't hold us. 
                    Anything we wanna do, anywhere we 
                    wanna go...when we're older, we can 
                    do it. Me and you.

                                  YOUNG BILL
                    Not anywhere...

                                  YOUNG EPSTEIN
                    Yes anywhere. Like there. We could 
                    go there.  

      Said with a nod up at the full moon.

                                  YOUNG BILL
                    No we couldn't.

                                  YOUNG EPSTEIN
                    You just gotta think you can. 
                    That's the point.

                                  YOUNG BILL
                    Even if there's no chance we could 
                    ever get there. The moon.

                                  YOUNG EPSTEIN
                    Way I see it, if you aim for it, 
                    and you don't get there...I bet you 
                    still get somewhere interesting. 
                    Somewhere you never woulda thought--

      He s interrupted by the appearance of a lantern, bouncing 
      toward them in the darkness--

                                  BENJAMIN HASKELL
                    William! Get down here!

      Bill eyes Epstein in the moonlight.                                                                                  4.


                                  YOUNG BILL (CRESTFALLEN) 
                    Coming.

      As he dutifully descends the tree--CUT TO--

      EXT. VERMONT COUNTRYSIDE - MOMENTS LATER

      Bill s Father, hurriedly ushering him back toward the house. 
      Epstein follows at a small remove--

                                  BENJAMIN HASKELL
                    I have saved every penny I have to 
                    afford you this opportunity. You 
                    will not embarrass your mother and 
                    myself--

      His eyes fall across MR. CHANDLER--the spitshined buggy 
      driver--in the yard.

                                  BENJAMIN HASKELL (CONT D)
                    Mr. Chandler! So sorry. A small 
                      indiscretion. My profound apologies-

      As he hastens forward to shake Chandler s hand, camera 
      lingers behind with Bill & Epstein...

      This is it. Goodbye time for best friends.

                                  YOUNG EPSTEIN 
                    Me and you. We shoot for the moon. 
                    Got it?

                                  YOUNG BILL (DUBIOUS) 
                    Even if we've got no chance of 
                    getting there...

      Epstein nods with a grin. Exactly the point.

                                  YOUNG EPSTEIN
                    Even if we've got no chance of 
                    getting there.

      A final wan smile between them. Then they separate, cutting 
      off toward their respective houses. Linger on Young Bill--

                                  BILL (V.O.) 
                    My whole life: planned out for me. 
                      Fast-tracked to get me to the 
                    Promised Land. My father told me 
                    not to complain, because guys like 
                    Byron Epstein...didn t have that 
                    same sort of opportunity... 

      And we see: Epstein s house--as he moves for it--slightly 
      better than a hovel.                                                                                   5.


      INT. UNIVERSITY - DAY

      Quick hits: tracking from other students reading math texts, 
      business texts....to a COLLEGIATE BILL flipping through 
       travel lit , 1890 s-style--Bret Harte s accounts of the 
      California Gold Rush, W.L. Stevenson s south seas stories--

                                  BILL (V.O.)
                    They prepared me, all right. For 10 
                    years, I read every book under the 
                    sky. 

      EXT. BIG CITY - DAY

      Quick hits: Epstein in the broad-shouldered industrial world 
      of American cities in the 1890s...

                                  BILL (V.O.) 
                    And while I was reading...Bill was 
                    living.  He saw the world. The 
                      unvarnished one that was not in 
                    books.

      Epstein: exiting a Loan Shop with a turn-of-the-century 
      version of a payday loan in hand--PROPRIETOR emerging behind 
      him, watching him go with the eyes of a shark...

                                  BILL (V.O.)
                    The one filled with bank failures, 
                    with families being tossed out of 
                    homes, 4 million men wandering the 
                    continent looking for work...

      As Epstein stands in an impossibly long unemployment line:

                                  BILL (V.O.)
                    This couldn t be it. There was no 
                      possibility in it. There had to be 
                    more. A place where there was 
                    nothing but possibility.

      INT. BALLROOM - DAY

      A banner fills frame: CONGRATULATIONS CLASS OF 1897! Camera 
      booms from this down to a coat-and-tie affair. A bit stiff, 
      if we may call a spade a spade. It s  May 1, 1897.  

      We find Bill here, newly graduated, being introduced to 
      various movers-and-shakers by an enthusiastic COLLEAGUE. 

                                  COLLEAGUE
                    Captains of industry everywhere you 
                    look. Guy over there s in the 
                    horseless carriage game. Guy over 
                    there: telephones. Supposedly he s 
                    figured out how to lower rates so 
                    the common man can afford it. And 
                    if the common man can afford 
                      it...sky s the limit. Those are the 
                    games we wanna be in.                                                                                   6.


      While all of this is going on, we are with Bill: amicable, if 
      uncomfortable. These people: the 1%. Not, at the end of the 
      day, his people. Colleague, noticing:

                                  COLLEAGUE (CONT'D)
                    I m not detecting ambivalence am I?

        Misinterpreting Bill s silence:

                                  COLLEAGUE (CONT D)
                    God, of all people, you shouldn t 
                    be nervous. Your dad s been pulling 
                    strings with all of these people. 
                    Candidly, I m a bit jealous...

      Bill s demeanor changes when he does spot one of his people. 
      Arguing with the Concierge at the door. 

      A scruffy guy with a poor suit. Epstein.

                                  BILL
                    Excuse me. 

      Before Colleague can respond, Bill excuses himself, pardons 
      his way through the crowd to Epstein & the Concierge.

                                  BILL (TO CONCIERGE, REASSURING) 
                                  (CONT D)
                    It s okay. He s with me. 

      Concierge relents. Bill and Epstein step inside the party. 
      Epstein s got a shit-eating grin. Bill, pleased as hell to 
      see him:

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    See you wore your finest.
                          (re Epstein s natty wool 
                            suit)
                    Are there actually moths in there?

                                    EPSTEIN
                    This coming from a guy who looks 
                    like a constipated penguin.

      They embrace with a sincere pat on the back.

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                      Congratulations, brother.

      They separate. Colleague has appeared.

                                  BILL
                    Richard. Meet Byron Epstein.

      Colleague nods affably, but you can tell the man s a bit 
      confused about Epstein s low-brow presence here. 

                                  COLLEAGUE (TO BILL)
                    Come over. I want you to meet the 
                    telephone guys.                                                                                   7.


      Bill meets eyes with Epstein. A knowing look there.

                                  BILL
                    Actually, we ve got a train to 
                    catch. 

      A waiter passes. Epstein procures two glasses of champagne. 
      As he hands one to Bill:

                                  COLLEAGUE
                    Where re you headed?

                                    EPSTEIN
                    West.

                                  COLLEAGUE
                    West? Why west?

                                  BILL (WRY)
                    Because that s where every young 
                    man goes...

                                  COLLEAGUE
                    Yeah, but what s out there?

                                  BILL (SUBTLE GLEE) 
                    I don t know. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    And that, my friend...
                          (swallows champagne)
                    ...is exactly the point. 

      As Bill and Epstein clink glasses--CUT TO--

      EXT. URBAN TRAIN STATION - DAY

      --the duo moving quickly through the bustling downtown 
      station. Around them, the advanced urban sprawl of 1897 
      America. They reach the train just as it s set to depart. As 
      they climb aboard, settle on the steps--

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Can still back out. You did, after 
                    all, have more opportunity back in 
                    that room than most human beings 
                    will have in a lifetime.

                                  BILL
                    Wouldn't be on my terms.

                                    EPSTEIN
                          (invigorated)
                    All I know is you may be high-
                    falutin school-boy, and all that, 
                    but soon as we hit on that train, 
                    and we're about 2000 miles that 
                    way, that diploma of yours won't be 
                    anything more than a piece of 
                    paper. Just be us, a couple of men 
                    on the land. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                  8.

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT'D)
                    And damn if it's not gonna be me 
                    with the idea that makes us rich.

                                  BILL
                    We wanna bet on this?

                                    EPSTEIN
                    1000 bucks.

                                  BILL
                    You don't got 1000 bucks.

      Epstein unfurls a cocky grin.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Not yet I don t. 
                          (puts a hand out)
                    1000 bucks. I'm the guy the comes 
                    up with the idea that makes us 
                    rich.

      Bill s eyes, though, are on the COMMUTERS hurrying by in the 
      station with their suits and valises. Brow-furrowed, stressed-
      out ants, all of them.

                                  BILL
                    What if I say it's not about 
                    getting rich for me?

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Then I'd say you're full of shit. 

      The train chugs to life. Begins to leave the station. Epstein 
      gazes into Bill challengingly.

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                    We got a bet or don't we? 

      As Bill meets his gaze, shakes his hand with a knowing smile--

      EXT. FROZEN WILDS - DAY

      We are back in the frozen wild. Bearded Bill s near-frozen 
      lips curl a half a percent in bemused, wizened reminiscence. 

                                  BILL (V.O.)
                    1000 dollars. Seemed like a million 
                    then. Like something that 
                        actually...mattered.
                          (beat)
                    But even then, whether we knew it 
                    or not, the bet wasn't about the 
                    money. It was about the bet itself. 

      Around him in the whiteness...shouts, euphoric, unbridled...

      INT./EXT. TRAIN - DAY

      Various shots of Bill & Epstein, young men emancipated upon 
      the land:                                                                                  9.


      " Hanging heads out the window, shouting exultantly out at 
      the passing America landscape. 

                                  BILL (V.O.)
                    Epstein wanted to prove he was the 
                    dog with the runny nose, the poor 
                    man that society couldn't keep 
                    down. And to him, even though I was 
                    his best friend...I was society.

      Camera drifts back to Bill in the window behind him--

                                  BILL (V.O.) 
                    Thing he didn t get was that was 
                    the last thing I wanted to be. All 
                    I wanted was to get away and find 
                    my own thing. Something that was 
                    real, bare-boned...

      CUT TO--BILL & EPSTEIN--in the back of the dining car, 
      tossing dice and drinks with negro porters and cooks. 

                                  BILL
                    A place to set up shop...and carve 
                    out my future with my own two 
                    hands.

      INT. TRAIN - LATER

      CASH--being tossed into a hat. Widen. Bill & Epstein--forming 
      a  kitty  for their coming endeavor.

                                  BILL
                    That s all of it. 350. Every cent I 
                    got for graduation.

                                    EPSTEIN (CONSIDERING CASH)
                          (mild disappointment)
                    Huh. 

                                  BILL
                    Huh what?

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Thought it d be more, that s all. 

                                  BILL
                    Don t look a gift horse in the 
                    mouth, brother. I m putting all 
                    that into the kitty.

      It s then that Epstein unfurls his own wad of cash and tosses 
      it into the kitty.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Just...I got, what, 400 here. 
                    Thought it d be me that d be the 
                    one light on the contribution.

                                  BILL (INCREDULOUS) 
                    What, you rob someone?                                                                                10.


                                    EPSTEIN
                    Funny. That there is legally 
                    acquired tender, brother. Which I 
                    prefer to call capital investment, 
                    if we re going to be business men 
                    about things. 

                                  BILL (COUNTING) 
                    So we re looking at...750.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Ain't much of a nest-egg, but it's 
                      something.

                                  BILL (NODS)
                    Who we kidding. It's nothing. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Makes the story all the more 
                    beautiful though, doesn't it? When 
                    we're millionaires...we can say we 
                    started with nothing. 

      Bill nods. Liking that.

                                  BILL
                    Here's to nothing, brother.

      Epstein smiles. Nods. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    To nothing. 

      Off their smiles, CUT TO--

      EXT. TRAIN - DUSK

      --the DUO, sitting topside, the wind in their hair, looking 
      out at an illimitable sunset over the Buffalo-swollen 
      prairies of middle America. 

                                  BILL (V.O.) 
                    In that moment, we were one of the 
                    most potent and foolish forces in 
                    the world. Two men shooting for the 
                      moon...even if they didn t have a 
                    chance in hell of getting there.

      INT. BAR - DAY

       Colorado Springs, Colorado. May 7, 1897.  Bill & Epstein 
      idle over beers, the latter reading classified ads in a 
      paper.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Thought the west was supposed to be 
                    about opportunity. Ain t seeing 
                    Jack for opportunity. It s all 
                    menial stuff.                                                                                 11.


                                  BILL
                    Don t mind menial. If that s where 
                    we gotta start and work our way 
                    up... 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Always amuses me how the rich man 
                      romanticizes the menial life. 
                    Thinks it s closer to the earth. 
                    Like it ll deliver him. 

                                  BILL
                    I am nowhere near rich. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    All I m saying is, I ve lived the 
                    menial life, brother. Ain t nothin  
                    romantic about it. 

                                  BILL (RE NEWSPAPER) 
                    How  bout you stop sermonizing and 
                    start telling me what you re seeing 
                    in there.

                                    EPSTEIN (READING) 
                    Let s see...they re looking for 
                    cowherds.

                                  BILL
                    Don't know about the first thing 
                    about animals.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Railroad men.

                                  BILL
                    Coulda done it back home.

      Epstein orders 2 more beers, returns to the classified. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    We could be soldiers, go to the 
                      Philippines...

                                  BILL
                    Got no interest in dying anytime 
                    soon.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Not for a dollar a day.

      The new beers come. Bill moves to pay for them. 

                                  BILL
                    What do I owe you?

      Bartender nods up the bar. 

                                  BARTENDER
                    Our man down there s fronting 
                    drinks til closing time.                                                                                 12.


      And it's here we meet a crucial figure in our story. A man 
      the end of the bar: The One Who Kept Going. An impossibly 
      weathered veteran of the gold fields. Call him BECKETT. 

      Bill & Epstein cross to him. 

                                  BILL
                    Wanted to thank you for your 
                      generosity.

                                    BECKETT
                    It's only generous if it hurts. And 
                    buying drinks...ain't no pain in 
                    that for me ever again. Sorta 
                    beyond that phase, if you get me.

                                  BILL
                    Thanks all the same.

                                    BECKETT
                    Telling you, thanking a rich man 
                    for a nickel's like thanking the 
                    sky for air. Drink up. Take a 
                    coupla bottles with you.

      Bill and Epstein meet eyes. The man s clothes bespeak a hard 
      life. The only thing currently with him is a rusting coffee 
      tin on the bar before him. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Mind us asking what sorta business 
                    you're in--?

      In answer, Beckett produces a gold nugget, drops it on the 
      counter before them. 

      This is a big moment. The first time we see gold in the 
      series. And goddamn if it isn t beautiful.

      The size of a man s thumb. Radiant with a deep luster native 
      only in the purest of gold.

      Bill s putting two and two together in his head. Ah...

                                  BILL
                    Colorado. That s right. They been 
                    saying in the papers for a while 
                    now miners ve been pulling all 
                    sorts of gold out of the ground... 

                                    BECKETT (KNOWING SMILE) 
                    If it s in the newspaper, it s 
                    over. 
                          (beat)
                      Colorado s panned out. Has been for 
                    a long time. Just like Black Hills 
                    and California before that.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Then where were you?                                                                                13.


                                    BECKETT
                    Just like anything else, if you 
                    really wanna be the trailblazer, 
                    you go as far as everyone else 
                      does...then you keep going. 

                                  BILL
                    And that gets you where exactly?

      Beckett mulls, finally nods.

                                    BECKETT
                    The Yukon.
                          (beat)
                    Placer fields have been locked 
                    beneath permafrost for thousands of 
                    years. Only now are people starting 
                    to realize what s down there.  

      He finishes his beer. Nods knowingly.  

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    But...you gotta get there before 
                    the newspaper does. 

      He hefts his coffee tin, moves to leave. 

      Epstein & Bill quickly realize the man s left that beautiful 
      nugget on the counter.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Forgot something, boss.

      Beckett looks back. Shakes his head with a subtle smile. 

                                    BECKETT
                    No. I didn t.

      He lifts the lid off the coffee tin. Revealing within, 
      crammed all the way to the top, more gold nuggets. Bigger and 
      more beautiful than the first one. A knowing smile from him. 

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    Keep it.

      Then he s gone.

      EXT. COLORADO SPRINGS TRAIN STATION - DAY

      Bill & Epstein sit on their satchels. Consider the nugget. 
      Mulling the man s advice. 

                                  BILL
                    Just so you know, technically, if 
                    we were to go up there, and were we 
                    to strike it rich, it's wouldn t 
                    have been your idea. It was his. So 
                    don't think you're getting the 
                    thousand. 

      Epstein hefts the nugget Beckett gave them.                                                                                14.


                                    EPSTEIN
                    We land coffee cans full of 
                      this...I ll give exactly half a 
                    damn about a thousand bucks. 

      Off that nugget, glinting in the sunlight--DISSOLVE TO--

      EXT. ALASKAN STRAIT - DAY

      ...foam dancing in the wake of a ship. Rise to find Epstein & 
      Bill on dock. Looking out at yet another world: black cliffs 
      with jagged peaks, coastline shrouded in fog. We are a long 
      way from anything they ve known.

      This is  The Lynn Canal, Alaska, June 2, 1897 . 

      As Bill considers the foreboding allure of the landscape, he 
      turns his attentions to the curious assortment of other 
      passengers. A diverse ship of fools and aspirants. A fat 
      SOCIETY LADY in tailored garb. Drinking tea being served to 
      her by a SERVANT.

      A priest (later, FATHER JUDGE, 40s), with a rifle slung over 
      his shoulder. Consorting with a young native HAN WOMAN in 
      Western clothes. The woman, an early example of the local 
      population being  civilized . Their relationship, seen in 
      pantomime, is a head-scratcher. What exactly are the terms?

      As Bill absorbs it all in contemplative silence...he notices 
      a snaky little pickpocket (later, SOAPY SMITH, 30s), trying 
      to get into the Fat Lady s purse while her back s turned. 

      Yet every time he s about to consummate the nab, she shifts 
      just enough to almost notice him and he retreats. This 
      happens 2 or 3 times, Soapy being silently and humourously 
          frustrated...then...

                                    STEWARD (O.C.) 
                    DY-E-A!

      Everyone turns their gaze to the shoreline ahead. What 
        materializes from the mist is technically a  town , but one 
      about as far removed from civilization as you can get. Dyea. 

      EXT. DYEA STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

      Bill & Epstein disembark amongst the others, regard the 
      foreboding end-of-the-world town. 

      Visible in the streets, a surprising amount of MINERS. 
      Hastily rigging sleds, gearing up. Almost like one might 
      expect to see before the start of a modern Iditarod. 

      Bill nears Father Judge, who s some ways ahead of them, 
      investigating the commotion.

                                  BILL
                    What's going on?

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                      Evidently, the Pass has been locked 
                    up for last 4 weeks with storms.                                                                                 15.


      Said with a nod to the imposing mountain range behind town. 
      The Chilkoot Pass climbs up through a narrow shoot. It s 
      heavy with snow. Impossibly steep. Intimidating. 

                                  FATHER JUDGE (CONT D)
                    This is apparently the first window 
                    they've had in the weather. So now 
                      everyone s heading out. Trying to 
                    get over before the next storm 
                    hits. Which, by the look of it...
                          (he considers his portable 
                            barometer...)
                    ...won't be long. 

      EXT. DYEA STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

      Bill & Epstein, moving through the miners--

                                  BILL
                      Obviously, we wait.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    What do you mean? Obviously we go. 
                    Remember what our boy back in 
                    Colorado said. Get there first. 

                                  BILL
                    You don't get anywhere first if you 
                    die on the way. 

      Epstein nods to a nearby VENDOR, hawking provisions & gear.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    What s it cost to kit up?

                                  VENDOR
                    300 ll get you a sled, provisions, 
                    shelter, clothes. Cover you for the 
                    next six months. 

                                    EPSTEIN (PROFFERS MONEY) 
                    Sign us up--

      Bill coolly guides Epstein aside--

                                  BILL
                    No, no. Hold up. We've got to think 
                    about this. I'm serious.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    So am I. You wanna wait here til 
                    it's summer, be my guest. But I'm 
                    buying that kit, even if I got to 
                    separate out my own money to do it. 

                                  BILL
                    Oh don't do that. We're doing this 
                    together. That was the agreement.                                                                                 16.


                                    EPSTEIN
                    Then you better put on your 
                    climbing shoes. 'Cause I am going 
                    up that, today. 

      Said with a nod toward Chilkoot. Upon which a thin river of 
      ascending miners can be seen.

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                    Every miner up there stakes a plot 
                    ahead of us. First guy chooses the 
                    best claim, second guy the second 
                      best...all the way down the line 
                    til we get there. You really want 
                    the hundredth best claim? The 
                      thousandth?
                          (to Vendor)
                    I'll take the kit. 

      Bill simmers. Knowing he can t stop Epstein s impulsiveness--

                                  BILL (TO VENDOR) 
                    We'll take half the kit. For 150. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    'Hell you talking about? Now's not 
                    the time to be saving money--

                                  BILL
                    Full kit's gonna slow us down. And 
                    if you want to go up that...we're 
                    gonna have to hustle our ass. Less 
                    time we're on that mountain, better 
                    chance we have at actually living. 

      He shakes his head. More to himself than anyone else:

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    Goddamn I don't believe this. 

      EXT. CHILKOOT PASS - LATER

      XCU...the skids of a sled, as it's slowly dragged up a snowy 
      slope. Very slowly dragged. Widen. Find Bill & Epstein 
      straining to pull their heavy kits up the mountainside. 

                                  BILL
                    You're a son of a bitch, you know 
                    that.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    If it weren't for me, You'd be 
                    sitting behind a desk somewhere, 
                    selling stocks. Getting old and 
                    cynical before you ever even lived. 

                                  BILL
                    And if it weren't for me, you'd be 
                    dragging that crap up the mountain.                                                                                 17.


      Said with a nod ahead to the Society Lady and her Servant, 
      the latter struggling mightily to coax the heavy fully-kitted 
      sled up the mountainside.

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    Sitting goddamn ducks for the 
                    storms. 

      EXT. CHILKOOT PASS - DAY

      More strain. More struggle. Bill & Epstein have left a number 
      of the more heavily-kitted groups behind. Ahead, they spot 
      Judge and his female colleague. Putting up a tent in the 
      shelter of a solid rocky crag. 

                                  BILL (RE TIME OF DAY)
                    Folding up early there, Father.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    You put a month's worth of snow up 
                    on that ridge, sooner or later it's 
                    coming down. Heat's sinking into it 
                    by the hour. Best travel at night. 
                    When the snow's frozen back up. 
                    Less likely to come roaring down on 
                    you. 

      Bill & Epstein smile, continue onward.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    See you on the other side, Father.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    Assuming that s the ridge you re 
                    talking about. 

      A nod and a smile as Bill & Epstein move on. 

      EXT. CHILKOOT PASS - NIGHT

      A string of lights is distributed sparsely up the 
      mountainside. Hikers, climbing at night according to Judge s 
      logic. Come in on one of those lights...the lantern clasped 
      in Bill s hand. Epstein s gassed by the cold and altitude. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    I'm shot.

                                  BILL
                    Keep moving. Every hour we move is 
                    an hour sooner we're off this 
                    mountain.

      As they move on, someone comes into view, appearing at the 
      peripheries of their lamplight. A HALF-MAD MINER, blackfaced 
      and ghastly in the night. His tattered kit beside him. 
      Rubbing something again and again over that blackened face.

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    You all right there?

      Miner looks up. Sees the looks of consternation.                                                                                 18.


                                  HALF-MAD MINER (RE HIS FACE) 
                    Charcoal. And I d do it too if I 
                    were you.  Less you wanna lose your 
                    lips and nose to the cold. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Get the sense you been out here for 
                    a while, boss--

                                  HALF-MAD MINER
                    Shh...
                          (beat)
                    Hear that?

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Hear what? 

                                  HALF-MAD MINER (REVERENCE) 
                    The sound of life. 
                          (beat)
                    The sound of nothing. And that s 
                    exactly what you wanna hear on 
                    Chilkoot. Nothing. Soon as you hear 
                    a rumble up there in the darkness, 
                    you got about 10 seconds til you re 
                    dead. You gotta listen. Otherwise 
                    the mountain ll eat you in the 
                    night.

                                  BILL
                    Sure you re all right?

                                  HALF-MAD MINER
                    Sooner you shut up and start 
                    listening I will be.

      He glares at them. Bill nods. He & Epstein move on.

      EXT. CHILKOOT PASS - DAY

        June 13, 1897. Chilkoot Pass. 

      Beneath a cluster of rocks, Bill & Epstein s tent. The latter 
      inside, stirring uncomfortably in his sleeping bag.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Goddamn half-kit. Coulda had real 
                    blankets. Instead, I m an ice cube 
                    in an old wet sock. I m serious, 
                    Haskell. This is a deal-breaker for 
                    me. 

      Bill s outside. Eyeing the train of ascending miners below. 

                                  BILL
                    You re the guy that wanted to get 
                    there first. I d say on that 
                      front...we re doing a pretty good 
                    job. 

      He turns his gaze then from the miners to the sky. To the sun 
      burning brightly there.                                                                                 19.


      Lastly, he turns to look up at the cornice high on the ridge 
      above. It looms there, wind-swept, way-too-steep and high. 
      Off it, glistening in the heat... 

      EXT. CHILKOOT PASS - NIGHT

       June 20, 1897. Chilkoot Pass. 

      The slope: now a near-impossible 45 degrees. Bill & Epstein: 
        persevering, their faces frozen constellations of beard, 
      charcoal, and snow. 

      Below, the ever-present string of lights in the night, 
      connoting the other miners as they climb. 

      Bill s eyes are on the sloping darkness above. His ears, per 
      earlier wisdom, are trained on the silence. It s different 
      out here in the wilderness. Illimitable. Behind him:

                                    EPSTEIN
                    10 days we been on this hill. 
                          (beat; off Bill s look)
                    And you thought I couldn't count.

                                  BILL (DISTRACTED) 
                    Nope. Yesterday you told me it was 
                    9. Day before that, 8. You're a 
                    counter.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Feel like that Greek king--the one 
                    pushin the boulder up the hill for 
                      eternity--what's his name--
                      Syphilis...

                                  BILL
                    Sisyphus.
                          (eyeing mountain above)
                      Difference is we chose to be here. 
                    For him it was punishment--

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Sure as shit feels like punishment 
                    about now, Haskell--   

                                  BILL (LISTENING TO DARKNESS)
                    Shh....

      Epstein pauses. Sees Bill listening...

                                  BILL (EAR UPSLOPE) (CONT D)
                    Hear it?

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Hear what--

      And then it comes. The rumble. 

      Half-beat. No doubt about. Something above. Roaring down 
      toward them unseen in the darkness. Something massive.                                                                                20.


      Epstein turns to run downslode. Bill, though, spots, 15 feet 
      above, a rock outcropping--

                          BILL*EPSTEIN*
      Not down. Not down!*What?!*

                                  BILL
                    UP! UP!

        RUMMMMBLLLLEEEE!

                                    EPSTEIN
                    You outta your head--

      Bill yanks Epstein upward. They scramble up toward the rock 
      outcrop--

      --JUST AS THE AVALANCHE HITS. A HUGE WAVE OF SNOW ROARS PAST--
      CRESTING OVER THE ROCK OUTCROPPING--

      It just gets a hold of Epstein s shoulder, spins him away--

                                  BILL
                    EP!

      But for a moment, all he can do is press himself against the 
      outcropping--

      --then it s past.

      Bill leaps into action. Pushes downhill through the swirling 
      mist, his light refracting eerily in the snowy haze.

      Epstein s visible--his legs are, anyhow. Half-buried.

      Bill descends on him. Feverishly begins digging...

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    Ep...Come on, Ep....!

      And out comes Epstein, gasping, shocked.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Jesus Christ...Jesus Christ!

      As he catches his breath, the mist settling, Bill holds up 
      his lantern, looks downslope. Epstein follows his gaze. 

      Below, where seconds before there had been a trail of lights 
      connoting the miners...there is only darkness.

      No lights. Not a single one. 


                                      END ACT ONE                                                                                21.


                                        ACT TWO

      EXT. CHILKOOT PASS - DAWN

      Death. 

      The rising sun illuminates the aftermath of the avalanche: 
        bodies--already in rictus--being pulled from the snow by 
      those lucky enough to survive. Townspeople, working their way 
      up to the torn, pockmarked slope. 

      And Bill & Epstein--assisting--seeing familiar faces being 
      pulled from snowy tombs--the Fat Society dame, her Servant...

      Epstein can barely speak. Aside, to Bill:

                                    EPSTEIN
                    If we d still been down here...
                          (..we d be dead, but...)
                    You and your goddamn half-kit, 
                    brother. 

      He looks to Bill. That small choice likely saved their lives.

                                    EPSTEIN (HEARTFELT) (CONT D)
                    Thank you. 

      EXT. CHILKOOT PASS - LATER

      Bill & Epstein move through the carnage--bodies being loaded 
      onto sleds once designed to carry these people and their 
      dreams to the promised land--now conscripted to carry them 
      downslope to their grave. 

      Bill watches as Father Judge says prayers over the half dozen 
      or so fallen. Epstein, sensing the thoughts behind Bill s 
      ashen demeanor:

                                    EPSTEIN
                    You re not thinking about quitting, 
                    are you?

      Bill doesn t respond.

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                    It ain t gonna bring them back. 
                    It s not. 

      Epstein turns, looks up at the ridge. They re that close. 
      Bill looks to him, then back down at the dead...

      EXT. CHILKOOT PASS - LATER

      The slope, a near-impossible 45 degrees. Bill & Epstein 
      strain against gravity as they pull their sleds ever higher. 

      Behind Bill s goggles: eyes hollow, haunted, on auto-pilot.

      He presses on, ever harder--the ridge just above--the mud and 
      rocks calving beneath his feet.                                                                                22.


      Below, Epstein senses Bill s dogged drive:

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Go easy, brother. Maybe you oughta 
                    slow it down...

      But Bill presses on--

      EXT. CHILKOOT RIDGE - DAY

      --and moments later crests the ridge. As does Epstein beside 
      him a moment later. Both men pulling away their goggles from 
      their blackened faces. Tears come to Bill s eyes. A near-
      broken man. But unbowed. 

      Both men look ahead, o.s., with astonishment...

      EXT. CHILKOOT RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

      Camera rises behind them, revealing on the other side, a 
      chasm in the clouds, allowing the sun s full radiance to fall 
      on the basin on the other side. 

      Everything is visible: the splendor of far-off snow-capped 
      mountain ranges. The fluid magnificence of the caribou herds. 
      A string of frozen lakes like diamonds on the land.

      It is nature unfettered. So sublime it seems incapable of the 
      raw fury it unleashed just pages earlier. 

      For a long time, they just behold it. 

      EXT. CHILKOOT RIDGE - LATER

      Epstein, peering down the far side of the ridge. A long, 
      steep pure slope of snow slants away toward the valley floor 
      below. 100 years later, this is a snowboarder s dream. A 
      long, untrammeled ride...

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Takes us almost 2 weeks to get 
                    up...what do you reckon it'll take 
                    to get down?

                                  BILL
                    If we walk it, few days...

                                    EPSTEIN (NODS TO HIS SLED) 
                    And if we sled it?

      Bill considers his sled, then the steep slope. 

                                  BILL
                    10 minutes. If we don't break our 
                    necks.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Maybe we walk it then.

      Bill eyes the black-diamond slope again.                                                                                23.


                                  BILL (WEARY) 
                    Goddamn am I tired of walking. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Hoping you would say that. 

      They share a look. Ease their sleds toward the cornice. 

      And for the first time in 3 weeks, let gravity claim them.

      Two sleds & two men drop down onto the slope. And in moments 
      are roaring valley-ward...

      It s a short-cut. A thrill-seeker s move. Simultaneously an 
      adrenaline rush and horrifying...

      Down they go, white-knuckled, runnels of tears streaming from 
      their wind blown eyes--

      EXT. FROZEN LAKE / MAKESHIFT COMMUNITY - MOMENTS LATER

      CRASH! A few beats later, Bill s sled finally careens, 
      catches an edge, and flips, spilling him onto the snow in a 
      tumble. 

      He s at the bottom, though. Flat land. For a moment, he just 
      sits there, a smile threatening to cross his lips for the 
      first time in days. The mountain, in that moment, 
      beneficent...

      Then a pair of boots appears beside him in the snow. Shiny, 
      well-polished Balmorals. Delicate. A woman s.

      He looks up to see something so wholly anomalous upon this 
      landscape that he can scarcely process.

      A woman. SABINE, 20s. Good-looking, too. 

                                  SABINE
                    I trust you had a good ride.

      Bill stands. Fresh off 3 weeks of blizzard, fatigue, and near-
      delirium, he s wholly unprepared for witty rapport.

                                  BILL
                    I, uh, I did.

      Bill quickly takes in the surroundings, a couple other 
      prospectors are visible, bivouacked for the day. 

      Bill fumbles a bit, both with his tongue and the glove he 
      tries to remove to shake her hand:

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    Bill, uh...Bill...

      You get the sense that Sabine s accustomed to this. Men 
      fumbling before her beauty. Playfully:

                                  SABINE
                    Nice to meet you Billa Bill.                                                                                24.


      He finally gets his glove off. Shakes her hand. There s a 
      great asymmetry here--she in her fineries, he looking like 
      he s just returned from polar exploration--

                                  BILL
                    It s Haskell, actually. Bill 
                    Haskell.

                                  SABINE
                    Sabine.

      There s a half beat in which they meet eyes with enough 
      mutual appreciation that we think this might be the start of 
        something--down the road, perhaps--then--

                                    EPSTEIN (O.S.) 
                    Lady, you are either a dream or a 
                    mirage.

      Reveal Epstein, a weather-beaten abomination like Bill, 
      tramping across the snow toward them.  He thrusts a mitt 
      toward her. 

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                    But either way, I m going with it.  
                    Byron Epstein.

      As she clasps his hand, nodding politely--CUT TO-- 

      EXT. FROZEN LAKE / MAKESHIFT COMMUNITY - LATER

      Along the river, a makeshift camp: two dozen people, toiling 
      to build boats--essentially from scratch--along the 
        shoreline...

      Bill & Epstein follow Sabine through it all.  

                                  SABINE
                    Heard about the avalanche.
                          (it s a shame)
                    Third one this year. 
                          (knowing exhale)
                    Can only reckon you two're bound 
                    for Dawson City like the rest of 
                    us. "Paris of the North". 

                                  BILL (SURPRISED)
                    Wouldn't expect a Paris anywhere up 
                    here.

                                  SABINE
                    There's a lot of things up here you 
                    wouldn't expect. 

      Said as they pass the first of the many self-styled 
      entrepreneurs they will encounter going forward--a weathered 
      vet--call him BOATSELLER--

                                  BOATSELLER
                    Got a vessel: tarred, sealed; 
                    proven workhorse that s already 
                    made the journey up and back. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                25.

                                  BOATSELLER (CONT'D)
                    Put a hundred in my hand and I ll 
                    give you the oars.

      As they pass, to Sabine--

                                  BILL
                    100 bucks. Boat s worth 5 tops!

                                  SABINE
                    Not if it gets you upriver first 
                    and you get your hands on that 
                    million dollar claim. 

      Bill s intentions are of course elsewhere--

                                  BILL
                    If you don t mind me saying, miss--
                      I wouldn t ve expected to find 
                    someone so...cultivated--this far 
                    north.

                                  SABINE (PLEASED) 
                      Cultivated. That s got more 
                    syllables and sentiment than 
                    anything I ve heard in months. 
                    Thank you.
                          (wry smile)
                    But...I m as derelict as the rest 
                    of you, trust me. Come this 
                      ridiculous long way to make a whole 
                    bunch of money in a very short 
                    while.

      She nods to a compatriot across the way.

                                  SABINE (CONT D)
                    Nice meeting you Billa Bill. Byron.

      She smiles warmly at them, heads off. Bill watches her go. 
      Epstein looks over at Bill. Sees the fixity of gaze he s 
      following Sabine with.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Oh don t go gettin  that look. 

      He moves off. Leaving Bill there, cool as a cucumber, but 
      smitten nevertheless...

      EXT. FROZEN LAKE / MAKESHIFT COMMUNITY - LATER

      Bill & Epstein, moving through the workers, surveying the 
      fairly impressive progress they ve made on the boats--given 
      that the wood s not milled and their tools are limited. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    How in the hell we gonna build a 
                    boat?

                                  BILL
                    Just like everything else, I 
                    reckon. You start...and you don t 
                    stop til you re done.                                                                                26.


      They re interrupted by a familiar face. Soapy Smith.

                                  SOAPY SMITH
                      Gentlemen. S. Rochester Smith. 
                    Enchanted to make your 
                      acquaintance.

      Bill & Epstein meet eyes.

                                  SOAPY SMITH (CONT D)
                    I am not a mincer of words, and as 
                    such, will get to the point. I can 
                    safely assume that you two men are 
                    bound for the Paris of the North.

      A nod from Bill.

                                  SOAPY SMITH (CONT D)
                    Well then, I m here to tell you 
                    that, land-wise, it is feedin  
                    frenzy up there. Fortunately, I am 
                      a representative of the only 
                    certified real estate company up 
                    there at present. I have on offer 
                    gen-yine deeds to prime real 
                    estate, as well as claims to 
                      millionaire-making mining concerns 
                    on the creeks in the Yukon.

      Soapy: diminutive, dumb as a log, though convinced he s a 
      mover like none other. He presses DEEDS into Bill & Epstein s 
      hands. Bill & Epstein consider them. Written there, in big 
      letters,  Lawson City...  It s such an oversight, it s almost 
      laughable.

                                  BILL
                    Think you might mean  Dawson City  
                    here, boss.

      Soapy gives the deeds a gander, quickly comes to realize he s 
      made a rather big mistake here. 

                                  SOAPY SMITH
                    Well, Alackaday. That is a grade-A 
                      head-scratcher, ain t it? 

      Epstein crowds him.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    And brother, you are grade-A lucky 
                    there ain t a woodshed around here. 
                     Cause if there were, my partner 
                    and I d be obliged to take you 
                     round back and give you a princely 
                      ass-whooping. 

      Soapy, in life preservation mode, makes a realist plea--

                                  SOAPY SMITH
                    It s nothing personal--                                                                                27.


                                    EPSTEIN
                    And how is that--

                                  SOAPY SMITH
                    I don t you know either of ya s 
                    from Adam. And if that s the 
                      case...think about it. How could it 
                    be personal?

      Bill & Epstein meet eyes again--is this guy kidding--?

                                  SOAPY SMITH (CONT D)
                    It s just how it goes up here, you 
                      understand? It s the Game you re in 
                    now.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Ain t seeing nothing about this 
                    that s a game.

                                  SOAPY SMITH
                    Then boy, you don t know people. Up 
                    here, the mask is off. You re 
                    either gittin , or you re gittin  
                    got.

      Epstein slowly lets go of him.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Try to rip us off again, and I ll 
                    build that woodshed myself, got me?

      A big, dumbass Labrador smile from Soapy--

                                  SOAPY SMITH
                    No, we re boys now. We re boys. We 
                      understand each other. Right?

      He pats both men on the shoulder, quietly tucks the deeds 
      under his arm, retreats. 

      Bill looks to Epstein. Both men quietly shake their heads. 
      Soapy s dirty as they come. But strangely, in his stupidity, 
      without malice. 

      EXT. FROZEN LAKE / MAKESHIFT COMMUNITY - LATER

      ON FATHER JUDGE & THE  SQUAW --arriving at the encampment. 
      Bill, seeing this. Curious couple, these two. As he sorts, re-
      packs his gear--

                                  SABINE (O.S.)
                    Guess that s it for me.

      Bill turns to see Sabine standing there. She nods to her 
        compatriots, loading their newly constructed boat.

                                  SABINE  (CONT D)
                    They re telling me she s sea-
                    worthy.
                          (smiles)
                    Maybe we ll see each other. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                28.

                                  SABINE  (CONT D)
                      Supposedly, up there, for such a 
                    big place, it s a small world. 

                                  BILL
                    Hope so. 

      They share a smile, She turns to cross to her boat. As Bill 
      watches her go, he takes notice of something else, a few 
      yards downriver from her boat. Epstein, haggling with the 
      earlier Boatseller. 

      ON BILL--crossing to Epstein--hearing--

                                  BOATSELLER
                    Hundred s the price.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    You think I m going north of 
                    eighty, you are one shithouse loon--
                    Eighty...

      As Bill moves to intercede--

                                  BOATSELLER (TO EPSTEIN) 
                    Put eighty US in my hand right now 
                    and we're dutch.

      Epstein quickly does so before Bill can arrive.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Gimme the oars.

                                  BILL
                    Wait--

      But the Boatseller takes the cash, presses the oars into 
      Epstein s hands before Bill can do anything. As he turns to 
      other business, Epstein turns to Bill, sees the look of 
      anguish on his face.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    What's that look for? We got a 
                    boat. We're in the game-- 

                                  BILL
                    You gotta stop pissing our money 
                    away--we make these decisions  
                    together, always--

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Yeah, no shit--

                                  BILL
                    We re gonna be living here 
                      indefinitely, and we're down 
                    already, what, half our money?

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Ah, once our stake's up and rolling-
                    -we'll be fine--                                                                                29.


                                  BILL
                    We are in the middle of the Yukon, 
                    brother. We run outta money we are 
                    dead. 

      Epstein gives him a look. Yeah, no shit. Like I don t know 
      that? Bill puts out his hand.

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    I want it. The money. I m treasurer 
                    now.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Says who?

                                  BILL
                    Says logic. Of the two of us, who s 
                    just a tad less likely to run off 
                    and spend it than the other?

      Epstein rolls his eyes. Fine. Whatever. Hands him the cash.

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    Is that all of it?

      Epstein nods. Yes! Bill folds it up, puts it away.

      EXT. FROZEN LAKE / MAKESHIFT COMMUNITY - LATER

      As Bill & Epstein slide their new purchase into the shallows 
      of the river--

                                    EPSTEIN
                    And don t act like you re secretly 
                    not happy. Imagine us sitting here 
                    for a month trying to figure out 
                    how to carve a boat out of that 
                    goddamn forest. Then getting 
                    upriver and finding out the claims 
                    are all full. You know what you 
                    would ve said to me then?

                                  BILL (GOOD-NATUREDLY)
                     We shoulda bought the boat.  

                                    EPSTEIN
                    You re goddamn right.

      The men smile, of one mind again. As they lay the boat into 
      the shallows--CUT TO--

      EXT. RIVER - DAY

       Yukon River, June 27, 1897.  

      MONTAGE: the men, navigating downriver. Around them, the 
      majesty of the Yukon Territory in summer. An illimitable riot 
      of jagged topography and color. Sky, land, and water teem 
      with life.                                                                                 30.


      As the boat glides along, camera looks down at it, finds it 
      ensconced in a sea of salmon, massive like they were 100 
      years ago, spawning tenthousandfold from bank-to-bank.  

      Bill s absorbing it all like a silent, awed pilgrim.

      He pauses then. Up in the trees, people. The Tlingit. 
      Watching them as they move down river. A couple of the 
      tribesmen, faces partially painted, shadow them through the 
      trees 40 feet away on the shoreline. Their faces impassive, 
      ancient.

                                  BILL
                    Ep.

      Epstein looks up. Sees what Bill sees. In the tribesmen s 
        hands...weapons.

                                    EPSTEIN
                      Sonofabitch. Why didn t I buy a 
                    rifle?

                                  BILL
                    Just wave.
                          (doing so)
                    Make nice.

      Both men wave. Smile. But the Tlingit, reaching a crop of 
      boulders that impede their movement, stop, just stand there, 
      watching with their dark, impassive expressions. 

      Then the raft s around the bend and they re gone from view. 

      But the feeling they ve left in the pit of the men s stomach 
      remains.

      For a long time, Bill & Epstein say nothing.

      EXT. RIVER / RAPIDS - DAY

      Class 4 rapids fill frame. A nasty, deadly white water roller 
      coaster. Camera rises to find, upstream: Bill & Epstein s 
      boat approaching.  July 1, 1897. 

      ON BILL--spotting the rapids ahead. Coming on fast. Over the 
      roar of rushing water:

                                  BILL
                    We gotta portage!
                          (beat)
                    Portage! Get to the side--!

      They scramble like hell, rowing madly, trying to get out of 
      the current--

      --but they re too late. 

      The churn claims them. They fight to keep the boat balanced--

      --but there s a stomach-turning drop--the boat clips a rock, 
      spins, lurching from the water at 45 degrees--                                                                                31.


      --dumping Bill into the icy water.

      ON BILL--struggling against the churn beneath the surface--
      it s like being inside of a washing machine on  spin --

      ON EPSTEIN--the boat miraculously slamming back down, 
      rightside up, with him still aboard. He tries to arrest its 
      progress as it races out of the chute, at the same time 
      trying to spy Bill in the frothy water--

      He accomplishes neither. Before he knows it he s 100 yards 
      downriver, hopeless in the intense flow, yelling back: 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Bill! BILL!

      His POV--that wicked churn, diminishing upriver by the second-
      -the water s surface there belying no sign of his friend...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      --BILL, gasping, pushing through the surface, slamming into 
      rocks, reaching for anything, any purchase--

      --his fingers barely seize hold of a heavy boulder. He pulls 
      himself into the shallows. Look downriver in vain for 
      Epstein. Nothing visible--

                                  BILL
                    Ep! EP!

      Nothing. Just him, the river, and the stream of blood that 
      runs from a gash over his eye.

      He spots something then, eddying briefly before him before 
      cascading away downstream. One of the $10 bills he d pocketed 
      earlier. A couple more are visible quickly coursing away. 
      Bill quickly turns out his pockets. Empty. 

      Their money s gone. All of it. Lost to the river.

      He takes stock then, considers the foreboding wilderness 
      around him. He may have far more immediate concerns...

      EXT. RIVER BANK - LATER

      ON BILL--shaken, trying to negotiate his way downriver along 
      the banks. But the shoreline s an impassible tangle of rocks 
      and foliage. No choice but to go inland and around...

      As he pushes through the dense greenery, rain starts to fall. 
      This is the first time we ve seen Bill alone on the land, 
      without human company or equipment. It s a sobering thing. 

      He thinks Tlingit thoughts. Discomfiting. He presses on, the 
      rain blending with the blood coursing from his head wound... 

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                32.


      ...Bill, pressing ever onward. Exhausted. Shivering in the 
      falling rain. The sound of the river has diminished here. He 
      tries to push back toward it, but it s difficult. 

      He stops. Listens for the river. The falling rain s not 
      helping on this account. Everything is hissing whispers and 
      susurrations. An auditory maze.  

      And night is starting to fall.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Bill, moving ever onward. Listening... 

      Sounds distinguish themselves from the falling rain. 

      It s not the river, though. It s something else. At first he 
      thinks it s the Tlingit...but soon realizes it s something 
      bestial.

      Bill stops. Sees, barely--through the darkness and downpour 
      and foliage--the rain-slickened form of a GRIZZLY, sniffing 
      the air... 

      An icy wall of fear slams into Bill. He tries to move away.

      The Grizzly looks up, aware...olfactory nerves locking in...

      ON BILL--the forest labyrinthine around him in the darkness. 
      He s reduced to feeling his way through. He can t see the 
      bear anymore. Is instead reduced to listening to the darkness 
      behind him...

      THE GRIZZLY--though it s not yet lain eyes on Bill--seems to 
      know unfailingly where he s going. Sniffing the air. 
      Smelling...the blood? 

      And it goes on this way, a game of blind man s 
        bluff...neither using sight...but the bear grows ever 
      nearer...

      Bill can hear him now. The snorts. The heavy footfalls. Those 
      claws on the rain-slickened rocks...

      Bill breaks out into a flat, panicked run...pushing 
      everything out of his way--

      --the bear hears this of course--

      --and a few beats later, Bill wends through the forest, and 
      sloshes down into a summer-thawed marsh. Swamp s a more apt 
        description. All mud and standing water. 

      The mud locks up around him. He struggles. Can move no more 
      than a few inches at a time--

      He turns. Behind him, the Grizzly comes into view. For the 
      first time laying a direct sightline on Bill.                                                                                 33.


      It s not the roar that you d expect that comes out of the 
      Grizzly s mouth, but instead a gnashing of teeth. Hungry. 
      Feral. Razor sharp. 

      Bill struggles. The Grizzly comes down into the marshwater. 
      Begins trudging powerfully and inexorably toward Bill.

      Bill yells at him. A primal bit of nonsense that does nothing 
      but unsettle himself all the more. 

      The bear, 10 feet away...8 feet away...

      Bill yells again. Tries to get  big . Which only incenses the 
      bear. 6 feet. 5 feet...

      A shot rings out in the night, filling the surrounding 
      terrain like thunder. The bear roars, hit. 

      Bill spins. Sees a darkened shooter in the trees. Another 
      muzzle flash--

      --another bullet slams into the bear. 

      But the bear keeps coming for Bill. Bill tries to back up. 
      Good God, what does it take to stop one of these things?!

      A third shot strikes home. The bear keeps coming. Scant feet 
      from Bill now, a blood thing delirious with pain and fury. 

      Then a fourth shot rings out, and the bear goes down for 
      good. Splashing in the mud right before Bill. 

      Bill looks up, shocked...

      The shooter circles around the edge of the marsh. Holding a 
      hooded lantern up. In the radiance, we see Father Judge, 
      rifle in hand. 

      Judge extends Bill a branch. Bill reaches it...pulls himself 
      up out of the swamp. 

      Off Bill--collapsing with muddy, shocked gratitude at the 
      priest s feet--


                                      END ACT TWO                                                                                34.


                                      ACT THREE

      EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

      Judge guides the shaken, bloody Bill back through the trees.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    Heard a boat d gone over. 
                          (beat)
                    Lucky I was able to get through to 
                    you. 

      Bill: still collecting himself.

                                  FATHER JUDGE (CONT D)
                    What s the matter, boy? That bear 
                    take your tongue?

                                  BILL
                      Just...don t know if I m more 
                    shocked to be alive...or seeing a 
                    man of the cloth with a gun...

      We get our best look at Judge yet. The priest: definitely no 
      mountain man. Patrician, wire-rim glasses, a slight build. 

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    I of course don t agree with Darwin 
                    on much...but up here, there s a 
                    certain credence to his idea of 
                    survival of the fittest. 
                    End of the day, you can t negotiate 
                    with nature. You either best it, or 
                    it bests you. 

      Hefting his rifle ever so slightly:

                                  FATHER JUDGE (CONT D)
                    However that may be. 

      EXT. RIVER BANK - LATER

      ON JUDGE & BILL--reaching the shoreline an hour later. Sun s 
      coming up. Judge s boat is visible, with the Han woman 
      waiting stoically. Downriver, across the flow, there s an 
      elated whoop:

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Son of a bitch!

      Visible on the opposite bank: Epstein & their boat. Epstein 
      looks like he s going to piss himself with happiness at the 
      sight of Bill.

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                    Son of a bitch, you made it!
                          (re language in Judge s 
                            presence)
                    Sorry, father!
                          (to Bill)
                    How are you, you old halfass?!
                                  (MORE)                                                                                35.

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                          (to Judge)
                    Sorry again, father!

      Bill gives Epstein a wave. I m good. I m good. You just work 
      on shutting up. To Judge:

                                  BILL
                    I don t know how to repay you...

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    Just pay me a visit at my chapel 
                    sometime when you re in Dawson.

                                  BILL (IMPRESSED)
                    You got a chapel in Dawson?

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    Not yet. But I m fixing to.
                          (knowing smile)
                    Man s gotta have a dream, doesn t 
                    he? Otherwise...what in God s 
                    name d any of us being doing up 
                    here just a chip shot away from 
                    Hell?

      Off their shared smile--CUT TO--

      EXT. RIVER BANK / RAFT - MOMENTS LATER

      Bill boards the raft. Epstein embraces him.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Thought I lost you.

      A nice moment for Bill. But he s troubled.

                                  BILL
                    Got an admission to make. Maybe I 
                      shouldn t ve been treasurer. 

                                    EPSTEIN (SURVEYS HIM)
                    You didn t.

                                  BILL (NODS)
                    I did. Lost it all when I was in 
                    the river. 
                          (shakes his head)
                    I don t know if we ve got to sell 
                    the boat and head back...but 
                    without cash, we can t get gear, 
                    can t get a stake...I m sorry, 
                      brother...I was just being, I don t 
                    know, righteous, thinking you were 
                    the untrustworthy one.

                                    EPSTEIN
                      Well...you were right about that. 

      He sits back. Smiles. Digs into his sock.                                                                                36.


                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                    And God Bless me for it. God Bless 
                    both of us.  

      From his sock, he withdraws a small  reserve  wad of bills.

                                  BILL
                    You sneaky son of a bitch--

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Only a fool gives all his money 
                    away. 
                          (looks up into rain)
                    Never know when a rainy day s 
                    coming.  

      Bill embraces him again, both chagrined and relieved.

                                  BILL
                    You sneaky son of a bitch.

      EXT. RIVER - DAY

      --rain. Relentless. The landscape is brutally beautiful 
      around the boat. Bill shivers. His clothes, unable to dry in 
      the unrelenting downpour, are clammy and wet. Epstein s 
      erected a makeshift shelter with his oilcloth parka, has 
      built a small fire in a coffee tin, but Bill s failing. 
      Shivering, fetal.

       Yukon River, July 7, 1897. 

      Bill s spirits: shot. Epstein: trying to buoy him.

                                  BILL
                    Be a shame...to come all this way 
                    just to die. 

      Epstein shakes his head confidently.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    You ain t dying.
                          (beat)
                    Know why?

                                  BILL
                    Why?

                                    EPSTEIN
                    You re too damn responsible. 

                                  BILL
                    How s that figure into things?

                                    EPSTEIN
                    See, if you die, then it s just me 
                    out here on this river. Million 
                    miles from home. No clue how to 
                    mine for gold, no clue how to get 
                    back once the cash runs out. 
                          (shakes head)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                37.

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT'D)
                    Bill Haskell I know...wouldn t 
                    screw a man like that.

      Bill smiles at the sentiment.

                                  BILL
                    Hang around long enough, I just 
                    might.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Nah. You re not gonna die. All you 
                    need is a nice, warm bath.

                                  BILL
                    Now you re just being an asshole.

      Epstein s eyes are on the river ahead. Philosophically:

                                    EPSTEIN
                      I acknowledge I m not exactly the 
                    reading type, but if I m not 
                      mistaken...that does say  Bath  
                    doesn t it?

      Bill weakly looks up. Incredulity washes over his face.

      Reveal ahead, massive letters painted on the side of a 
      building. HOT BATHS - 5$. 

      Around it, a visage so welcoming it verges on impossible...

      A CITY. With wharves. A mainstreet. Saloons. Brothels. 
      Electric light in places. 

      It s a chunk of civilization carved impossibly out of the 
      foreboding landscape. 

      It s Dawson City. Paris of the North.

      Off the music and laughter, the people in clean clothes 
      moving back and forth on the sidewalks--and Bill & Epstein s 
      faces, regarding it all in dumbfounded amazement--


                                    END ACT THREE                                                                                38.


                                        ACT FOUR

      EXT. DAWSON CITY STREETS - DAY

      BILL & EPSTEIN--coming up from muddy wharves into the main 
      artery of Dawson City. Everywhere is signage, every thing and 
      service imaginable for sale. Around them, a babel of 
      languages: Russian, German, French. 

      They pass a REALTOR touting a lot in the middle of the block. 

                                    REALTOR
                    This is prime real estate, my 
                    fellow pilgrims! Location, 
                    location, location. You open your 
                    concern here, you will have no more 
                       concerns ! More foot traffic here 
                    than anywhere in the entirety of 
                    the Yukon Territory. 

                                    HECKLER
                    Not 6 months ago that chunk of mud 
                    couldn t even sell for 5 bucks!

                                    HECKLER #2
                    And not only that, it s next to a 
                      whorehouse!

      Which, Bill & Epstein see, is true. A brothel, right there.

                                    REALTOR (UNFAZED) 
                    Finest views in all of the 
                    northwest territories, gentlemen!

      There s raucous laughter all around.  

      Bill & Epstein pass by, absorbing the aforementioned views: 
      COURTESANS, advertising their wares from balconies and 
      windows of the brothel.

      Like that first glimpse we got of the gold earlier in 
      Colorado, there is something so beguiling about these women--
      seen as they are through the eyes of men that have long been 
      in the field--they are in a word, like that gold, sumptuous. 

      Off Bill & Epstein, as mesmerized by the women as they are by 
      the high-strung energy and possibility of the town--CUT TO--

      --a POV of them--from a window across the street...

      INT. BUILDING - DAY

      Reveal BELINDA MULRONEY, 30. Stolid. Prepossessing. Watching 
      their arrival with silent consideration. With eyes that 
      overlook nothing--or anyone--that comes to Dawson...

      INT. DAWSON CITY HOTEL - DAY

      Epstein & Bill enter. Approach the CLERK.                                                                                39.


                                    EPSTEIN (GOOD MOOD) 
                    Room and a bath.

      An uncomfortable beat as the CLERK surveys Epstein.

                                  CLERK
                    No Jewboys.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    What?

                                  CLERK
                    You want a room, go tent up with 
                    the niggers outside of town. 

      Epstein & Bill look at him incredulously. He s a big nasty 
      bastard. A hardened Yukon vet. He turns away from them to 
      other business, as if they don t exist. 

                                  CLERK (CONT D)
                    Go on now. Get out of here. 

      Epstein, incensed, produces a fisftul of cash. Insistent: 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    My friend wants a bath. 
                          (beat)
                    He s a god-fearing 
                      Catholic...pretty sure he won t 
                    sully your water.

      Bill gives him a look--don t be a spendthrift--

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                    Not a word, squeaky pockets. 

      The clerk begrudgingly takes the cash. Epstein grits his 
      teeth, looks to Bill. 

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                    I ll be in the saloon. 

      He exits. Bill looks back to the Clerk. No love lost there. 
      His eyes say: Jew-lover. But his hand begrudgingly slips Bill 
      a set of keys.

      INT. DAWSON CITY HOTEL ROOM - LATER

      ON BILL--standing unmoving in his room. Simultaneously miffed 
      by the Clerk and in a state of disbelief over the amenities 
      he stands amidst. 

      A TLINGIT WOMAN, slave-like, finishes filling the bath with 
      buckets of heated water. Departs. 

      Bill slowly unpeels the wet clothes he s worn for 6 straight 
      days. Slips into the water. To say it s exquisite is an 
        understatement. It s tremulous, skin-prickling as his flesh 
      hits the water...                                                                                40.


      EXT. DAWSON CITY STREETS - DAY

      Epstein moves through the streets. Still fuming. He considers 
      his wallet. In his anger, he s probably plopped down a little 
      more money than he should have. His wallet s looking very 
      light...

      Across the street: a loan shop. Off Epstein--CUT TO--

      INT. LOAN SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

      Epstein enters. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    What s it take for a loan?

      The PROPRIETOR eyes him. Coolly, simply:

                                  PROPRIETOR
                      Collateral.

      Off Epstein--CUT TO--

      EXT. DAWSON CITY STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

      --Bill, emerging out in the streets, cleaned up, rejuvenated. 

                                    EPSTEIN (O.S.) 
                    Hey. Hey!

      He turns to see Epstein motioning him excitedly from the 
      saloon. Get your ass in here!

      INT. SALOON - MOMENTS LATER

      A veritable zoo in here. Gambling. Drinking. Whores. 
      Burlesque show. Epstein pulls Bill through the crowd. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    I have never been to Paris, but 
                    this has gotta out-Paris Paris...

                                  BILL
                    Hey, about that guy back there--

                                    EPSTEIN
                    What? You think I m gonna let some 
                      anti-Semite piss on this parade--?

      He stops, finding the guy he was looking for--an excitable, 
      impressionable 19-year-old--JACK LONDON--

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                    Hey Bill, I want you to meet my new 
                    buddy--
                            (forgetting)
                    W...what was your name again?

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Jack London.                                                                                41.


      Bill & Epstein share a look. Kid s apparently dead serious 
      about  branding  himself.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    By the looks of you, I wouldn t peg 
                    you as the formal type. How  bout 
                    tossing in your middle name while 
                    you re at it?

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Jack, you won t remember. London, 
                    on the other hand, that s 
                      indelible. 
                          (drinks)
                    Fair number of men ll come out of 
                    here rich, but only a handful will 
                    be remembered.

      A good-natured chuckle from Epstein.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Right on, you nut.

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Give it a chuckle if you want, but 
                    you are looking at a walking, 
                    talking novel here. 
                          (re environs)
                    A shelf full of novels. Penwright 
                    there: dumber n a crate of turnips. 
                    Goes on a drunken bender upriver at 
                    40 Mile, sobers up a week later and 
                    he s stakeholder to the hottest 
                    claim on El Dorado Creek. No clue 
                    how he got it. But he s sitting on 
                    a half million in nuggets and it 
                    hasn t even been a month yet. 

                                  BILL
                    El Dorado Creek. That s the place 
                    then.

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Sure. Only if you don t wanna get 
                    rich. El Dorado s already panned 
                    out. 

                                  BILL
                    Already panned out--

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Staked anyhow. So unless you re 
                    gonna jump someone, I wouldn t put 
                    any mud on your boots heading up 
                    that way.

      London: fully immersed in all that he says. He s a junkie for 
      the hardscrabble Yukon life. A prodigious drinker, too, 
      though at 19, it s yet to show a downside. Instead only fuels 
      his excitement. Epstein, meanwhile, can only be interested so 
      long, and gets distracted by a courtesan across the way.                                                                                 42.


                                    EPSTEIN (RE COURTESAN)
                    She s giving me the love-eye. I m 
                    telling you. That right there is 
                    the love-eye.

      London nods in another direction--to an elegant-looking 40-
      year-old GERMAN man with a retinue around him.

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Take the Count over there: German 
                    nobility. Got all the equipment, 
                    the men...and they ve been pulling 
                    nothing but mud for almost 6 
                    months. Not a spot of color. Just 
                    goes to show...Yukon s the only 
                    place in the world where a dumbshit 
                    can be a king and a king can be a 
                    dumbshit.  

      He decides he likes that last line. Scribble it on the back 
      of a scrip of paper. 

                                  BILL
                    So if it s not El Dorado Creek, 
                    where is it?

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Bonanza.

                                  BILL
                    Where s that?

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Oh, Bonanza s easy: just go looking 
                    for the cloud of smoke...

      He pauses as a FRIEND comes over, whispers something to him. 

                                  JACK LONDON (CONT D)
                    No...

      Friend gives him an enthusiastic, silent nod. Yes...

      London stands. To Bill & Epstein--

                                  JACK LONDON (CONT D)
                    C mon.
                          (off their looks)
                      Swiftwater Bill is here.

                                    EPSTEIN
                      Swiftwater who?

                                  JACK LONDON
                      Swiftwater Bill. Richest prospector 
                    in all of north America. Maybe the 
                    world. Spends it faster than he 
                    makes it. And they re telling me 
                    he s got a girl upstairs.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    There s girls down here.                                                                                43.


      London swallows the rest of his drink. Grin.

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Not in a tub of champagne there s 
                    not.

      INT. SALOON / UPSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

      FOLLOWING LONDON, BILL, EPSTEIN as they crest the steps--

                                    EPSTEIN
                    And what do you mean a  girl , by 
                    the way?

                                  JACK LONDON
                      A courtesan. A whore. A hooker. One 
                    that hooks--

      Ahead: men clamor, trying to get into a room, get a view of 
      the spectacle.

      London pushes past with Bill & Epstein in tow.

      Buoyant music cranks from a phonograph. People are dancing, 
      drinking, laughing. Very much the penthouse crowd, Dawson-
      style. SWIFTWATER BILL, 50s, holds court. He s a rugged, low 
      IQ, high-enthusiasm, high-net worth Zorba of the North. He s 
      passing around champagne:

                                  SWIFTWATER BILL
                    Drink up. Drink up before the 
                    bubbles escape!

      He pours for everyone--even Bill, who accepts it with ready 
        enthusiasm--

      Bill pauses, seeing Swiftwater s next stop. The girl in the 
      bathtub who becomes visible as the crowd shifts.    

      Swiftwater Bill pours her a drink. Bill beholds, for a moment 
      caught up in the strange burlesque elegance of it. 

      Seen from behind, she s a dorsalist s dream, the way the 
      champagne and water hang on her bare back. A courtesan 
      evidently, she seems perfectly comfortable nude amidst the 
      drunken masculinity around her. Her carriage: confident...

      Then she turns. And meets eyes with Bill.  

      Bill dies a bit.

      It s Sabine. 

      INT. SALOON - NIGHT

      Bill, crestfallen, descends the stairs with Epstein in tow. 
      Epstein, though, doesn t have intentions of hanging around. 
      His eyes fall across his earlier COURTESAN. She of the love-
      eye. He claps Bill on the shoulder.                                                                                44.


                                    EPSTEIN
                    Think I m gonna go do some 
                      prospecting.

      He peels off. Bill returns to the bar. Orders a drink from 
      the bartender (later, JOE MEEKOR). Beside him:

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (O.S.) 
                    Dawson City. Where naivete comes to 
                    die. 

      Bill looks up to see Belinda there. Imposing despite her 
      stature. It s the confidence. The gun strapped to her leg. 
      She swallows a mouthful of booze, eyes the place. 

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    Everybody comes a saint, and leaves 
                    as something less than that. 
                          (off Bill s silence)
                    Give him another, Joe. Man s 
                    tongue s still too tight.

      Meekor serves up Bill a drink. Bill nods politely.

                                  BILL
                    Thank you, ma am--

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    Don t  ma am  me. I m still south 
                    of 30. Despite what these northern 
                    climes have done to my otherwise 
                    youthful, pearly skin.

                                  BILL
                    Thanks all the same.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    Belinda Mulroney.

                                  BILL
                    Bill Haskell.

      They shake hands. She eyes him. 

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    You labor or management, Haskell?

                                  BILL
                    How s that?

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    Only two types come up here: the 
                    guy with the shovel and the guy 
                    with the business plan. Shovel 
                    guys, they re welcome. One thing 
                    Yukon s not short on is dirt to dig 
                    in. Boys wanna be boys and play in 
                    the big old sandbox, that s up to 
                    you. Guy with the business plan, on 
                    the other hand...Dawson s full-up. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                45.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT'D)
                    We got more middle-men and business-
                    men and hucksters than we know what 
                    to do with. Blight on the 
                      landscape, if I can be perfectly 
                    honest. 

                                  BILL
                    Nope. Shovel guy. Looking to get 
                    into the sandbox. And pull out a 
                    future. 

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    You keep believing that, and you 
                    and me are gonna be just fine.

                                  BILL
                    How s that?

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                     Tween the two of us--and not to 
                    rain on your parade in advance--
                    there s no money in gold.

      She nods to the revelry around her.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    Soak it up, Haskell. How much of 
                    that gold being pulled up out of 
                    those hills is ending up in their 
                    pockets? 

      She motions vaguely to the elegant BURLESQUE DANCER on stage. 
      Exquisitely lit. Spellbinding.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    Gold s a whore, Haskell. Just like 
                    her up there. More beautiful than 
                    the rest. Can t take your eyes off 
                    her. But she gets passed around. 
                    And that s the thing about whores: 
                    you may lust after them--you may 
                    even think you love them--but you 
                    don t need them.

      Said as she draws a toothpick from her mouth. Considers it.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    This, on the other hand...you need. 

      Bill looks to her curiously. The way she holds that tiny, 2  
      span of wood.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    And when you need something up 
                    here, there s nothing you won t do 
                    to get it. No price you won t pay.

      She turns it in her fingers slightly so the wood s fibers 
      buckle slightly. In XCU we see wood like we have not before. 
      Like the gold and courtesan before, sumptuous, elemental...                                                                                46.


                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    To build a fire so you can survive 
                    the winter. To build these precious 
                      buildings. To melt the permafrost 
                    so you can get to your gold in the 
                    first place.

      She looks to Bill.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    Without wood, there s no Dawson 
                    City. And if there s no Dawson 
                    City, there s none of you boys 
                    foraging out there in the dirt for 
                    your future.

                                  BILL
                    And you re telling me this why?

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    I own the mill, Haskell. Everything 
                    in Dawson comes through me. 

      Bill smiles inwardly. Of course.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    You stay out of the wood business, 
                    I ll stay out of your sandbox, 
                    how s that strike you?

      She smiles at him when she says this. But the implicit threat 
      is clear. Bill isn t cowed. He returns the smile.

                                  BILL
                    Strikes me fine.

      Belinda nods to herself like she s gotten what she wanted. 
      She nods to Meekor for 2 more drinks.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    Then you and me, Haskell...we might 
                    be copacetic yet.

      As they drink--CUT TO--

      EXT. SALOON / BACK HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      --Epstein and the Courtesan, slamming up against the wall, 
      hot and heavy.

      As they re getting into it--both of them harebrained, excited-

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Just so you know...I can t pay.

                                  COURTESAN
                    That s okay.
                          (kisses)
                    For the ones I like, I ll go 
                    gratis.                                                                                47.


      A little more escalation--

                                  COURTESAN (CONT D)
                    You are a rabbit. I must really 
                    like you... cause I don t even give 
                    it to my boyfriend for free--

      Which makes Epstein take pause.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    You got a boyfriend?

      Seeing him regard her dubiously--

                                  COURTESAN
                    Sorta yes. Sorta no.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    There s no sorta. It s one or the 
                    other. 

      She kisses him again. And damn is she hard to say no to.

      INT. SALOON - CONTINUOUS

        Bill--finishing his drink--Belinda, wrapping up too--

                                  BILL
                    Say I wanna stake up on Bonanza. 
                    How do I go about doing that?

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    Like anything else up here. You 
                    just go up and do it. Then come 
                    back, drop a few bucks at the 
                      Recorder's office, and you're 
                    official. 
                          (beat)
                    Word of warning, though. There s no 
                    law up there, Haskell. And you 
                    leave a bunch of men alone to their 
                    own devices, and there s money 
                    involved, suddenly they aren t men 
                    anymore. 

                                  BILL
                    You get a gun, you only end up 
                    using it.

      Belinda moves as if to respond--but they re interrupted by--

      --a gunshot--somewhere in back.

      Everyone looks up. 

      A moment later,  Epstein runs out, pulling his pants up. As 
      he nears Bill, excitedly: 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Think I jumped someone s claim!                                                                                48.


      Belinda eyes him, darkening. To Bill: 

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    Best get him out of here. 

      EXT. DAWSON CITY STREETS - NIGHT

      Bill & Epstein spill into the street--

                                  BILL
                    Just had to go get into it, didn t 
                    you--

                                    EPSTEIN
                    I didn t know!

      Screaming behind them. A Russian pimp, known locally as 
      TOLSTOY, comes out of the saloon, a stream of others in tow. 

      He discharges a double-barreled shotgun into the air, 
      freezing Bill & Epstein in their path.  

      They turn to see Tolstoy reloading. He s drunk, fingers 
      coursing with booze and adrenaline as they fumble to slide 2 
      new shells into the shotgun.

                                    TOLSTOY
                    I will kill you once, then kill you 
                    again, son of a bitch! 

      All around them, people materialize from buildings. Keep a 
      safe distance, but watch the spectacle with interest. 
      Epstein, still buckling his pants, looks ready to bolt. Bill 
      though, is strangely calm:

                                  BILL (TO EPSTEIN, QUIETLY) 
                    Go easy.

      Epstein gives him a look--the hell you talking about--?!

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    He put that one in the sky when he 
                    coulda put it in your back. He s 
                    trying to scare you.

      Tolstoy: cursing, reloading, spittle flying--

                                    EPSTEIN
                    He s doing a hell of a job.

      Epstein almost bolts again--Bill seizes his arm--

                                  BILL (SOTTO) 
                    Do not run. 

      Epstein looks back at him. Bill, aware of all the eyes:

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    Only one chance to make a first 
                      impression, brother. And we got all 
                    of Dawson looking at us.                                                                                  49.


      Tolstoy s fingers, getting those shells in. Closing up the 
      shotgun. Growling. Approaching.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    So does he. 

                                  BILL (COOLLY) 
                    All bark, no bite. Trust me. 

      Tolstoy snaps the shotgun to his shoulder. He s scarcely 10 
      feet from them. Gun leveled right at their chests. 

      Around them, the whole town bristles. 

      Tolstoy bristles, fingers uncertain on the trigger--

      There s subtle commotion to their left. Bill & Epstein turn 
      to see--along with Tolstoy--Father Judge stepping forth 
      calmly from the crowd. 

      Sitting down on the steps nearest them, as if to get the best 
      seats in the house. 

      A beat as everyone looks at him incredulously. He shrugs to 
      Tolstoy, as if apologizing for the interruption.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    Proceed. Please.

      A chuckle or two emanates from the crowd.

      Tolstoy dithers. Discomfited by the nearness of a priest to 
      his homicidal intent. 

      Does he really want to gun two men down in the street? In 
      front of a man of the cloth?

      The crowd begins to laugh, knowing what his intent will be 
      before he does. 

      Finally, Tolstoy lowers the gun. 

      People erupt into laughter, jeers, cheers. The public arena: 
      tickled, as always, by spectacle.

      As everyone begins to disperse, Tolstoy lingers briefly. 
      Gives Epstein the stink-eye.

                                    TOLSTOY
                    God looks after you, does he? 
                          (pure spite)
                    But even God, one day, must turn 
                    his gaze elsewhere...then you ll be 
                    in God s blind spot, my 
                      friend...God s blind spot...

      He retreats with a glare. Epstein breathes for the first time 
      in about 3 minutes. Bill looks appreciatively to Judge 
      sitting there calmly.                                                                                50.


                                  BILL
                    That s twice you ve saved us.

      Judge shrugs, stands.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    Saving a man s hide s not saving 
                    him.

      He smiles, bleeds away into the crowd. Leaving Epstein and 
      Bill there in the street. Epstein looks to Bill.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    What d he mean by that? Saving a 
                    man s hide isn t saving him?

      Off Bill, faintly bemused--CUT TO--

      EXT. DAWSON CITY STREETS - LATER

      --Bill, tossing Epstein a satchel.

                                  BILL
                    We ll get the rest of our kit once 
                    we ve staked.
                          (beat)
                    Best we put Dawson in our 
                      wake...and get on with the business 
                    we came here for.

      As they head out into the dawn landscape, shovels and gear 
      clanking from their packs, a handful of people watch from 
      sidewalks and windows. People aware of them now before of 
      that earlier drama in the street.

      A few we don t know. But a few we do. Not the least of which 
      is Soapy Smith, who s apparently made town. He considers the 
      young men with his usual opportunistic eye. 

      A few windows down, up in window, is another: a bleary-eyed 
      Tolstoy, watching. He gives them a twice-over, then closes 
      the curtains, turning in after the long night. Saving his 
      ire, and intentions apparently, for later. 

      Off the boys--oblivious to this--disappearing into the 
      landscape--


                                    END ACT FOUR                                                                                51.


                                        ACT FIVE

      EXT. LANDSCAPE /  BONANZA CREEK  - DAY

      The men move through the early morning swampy landscape, 
      fording rivers across fallen logs. 

      Bill surveys the landscape ahead. A knowing look on his face. 

                                  BILL
                     Just look for the cloud of smoke. 

      Reveal, ahead: the sprawling madness that is Bonanza. 

      10 miles of back-to-back claims. It s a strange marriage of 
      the industrial and the primitive: windlasses, sluices, a 
      permanent haze hanging over everything from the ever-burning 
      fires thawing the permafrost. Dried food hanging in trees, 
      litter of empty tins. In microcosm, we are looking at Man, 
      butchering the land in search of resource...

      EXT. BONANZA CREEK - LATER

      FOLLOWING THE PAIR--further upriver--passing a claim. A 
      familiar face there. The Clerk from the hotel, visiting who d 
      appear to be his brother. 

      Both men, no fans of the Semite, scowl at Epstein. 

      Bill & Epstein press on. 

      Everywhere, though, men look at them with gaunt, distrustful 
      eyes. A foreboding pervades. To these men, they are 
        competition. And they are not welcome.

      Bill s got the geology book in his hand, dog-eared by now 
      from travel and study.

                                  BILL
                    Look for alluvia. Natural dams. All 
                    gold needs is a calm spot to rest. 
                      Swiftwater ll carry it for a bit, 
                    but gold, I ve learned, is 19 times 
                    heavier than water, and as such, 
                    it s gonna wanna rest. And all it 
                    takes is that calm little spot...
                          (beat)
                    That s all we re looking for, 
                    brother. That calm little spot. 

      EXT.  BONANZA CREEK  / UPRIVER - LATER

      Many hours later, Bill & Epstein arrive at the end of the 
      claims. It s less than ideal. No more flatland. Just steep 
      rising knuckles of granite and scree. 

      The LAST CLAIMANT beside them, a bitter man hardened by too 
      much time work and too little reward, eyes them darkly. His 
      eyes survey them. Their nearness to the tattered string he s 
      erected to demarcate the limits of his claims. Might as well 
      be the Great Wall of China.                                                                                 52.


                                  THE LAST CLAIMANT
                    You come to do some vulturin  off 
                    my claim, you ain t welcome.

                                  BILL
                    Trust me. We respect the sanctity 
                    of your claim. Which lies, if I m 
                    not mistaken, everywhere within 
                    that finely expressed bit of string 
                    you got there.

      Motioning to their side of the string:

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    Here now, if I m again not 
                    mistaken, is No Man s land. Staked 
                    by no one and thus available.

      Bill turns his eyes to the jagged land, surveying.

                                  THE LAST CLAIMANT
                    Flap em all you want. Doesn t 
                    matter no how,  cause there s no 
                    creek left anyhow. Not unless you 
                    wanna haul up 100 tons of equipment 
                    and do some lode mining up in them 
                    cliffs!

      Said with a motion up the impossibly steep slope beyond them.

                                  THE LAST CLAIMANT (CONT D)
                    Do everyone a favor and go back to 
                    the Outside, you jackholes.

      He goes back about his business. Epstein shakes his head. 
      Bill s eyes, though, are intent upon what he was looking at 
      earlier. 

      He quietly guides Epstein s gaze to a faint undulation in the 
      creekbed just upriver from the Last Claimant s site. At the 
      foot of the escarpment. It s...

                                  BILL
                    ...a carve-out. Like there s a turn 
                    in the creek there...

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Even though there isn t...

                                  BILL
                      Unless...there is.

      He traces the carve-out in the streambed with his finger, the 
      way it arcs across the creek s flow, as if joining the creek 
      at a 90 degree angle from an unseen source...

      Both men s eyes rise up the far bank...to the massive field 
      of scree there, sloping down from the high palisades above. 

      Unclaimed space. By all appearances worthless.                                                                                53.


                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    If there s a flow under those 
                    rocks, and we can get to it, we d 
                    be upriver from everyone else. With 
                    God knows how much unexposed 
                    creekbed waiting for us. Untouched 
                    for God knows how many years.

      Epstein looks at the daunting field of scree.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    If we can get to it.

      EXT.  BONANZA CREEK  / UPRIVER - LATER

      Hours later. Bill & Epstein, toiling. Struggling to clear the 
      sizeable chunks of scree. Back-breaking work, this. Last 
      Claimant casts a constant glare at them. 

      As they work, Bill s thinking aloud:

                                  BILL
                    Figure, what, 100 years ago, 1000 
                    years ago, there s a landslide. 
                    Covers the creek. Which by the 
                    looks of it is pretty damn near its 
                    source. And if run-off s slowly 
                    pulling gold out of the mountains 
                    over the century...depositing it 
                    along the creek...there are all 
                    sorts of obstructions here...be 
                    first stop for a lot of that 
                      gold...gold d sit right here, in 
                    that calm little spot, waiting for 
                    a couple of halfasses like us to 
                    come around and show it the light 
                    of day...

                                    EPSTEIN (STRAINING)
                    You re. Just. Guessing.

      Bill nods downriver to the primitive-industrial string of 
      claims.

                                  BILL
                    We re. All. Just. Guessing.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Ain t exactly a convention of 
                      academics, is it?

                                  BILL
                    Which means, couple of halfasses 
                    like us...

      Bill moves a final stone, then peers down into the darkness 
      between the stones below.

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    ...might just have a chance.                                                                                54.


      He reaches down between the thick stones...stretches...and 
      we re with his hand in that moment, straining into the 
      darkness, away from the light...fingertips just barely 
      reaching...

      ...wet, unadulterated sand. 

      He slowly pulls it up into the light. It scarcely covers the 
      tips of his fingers. But it s beautiful and pure in the 
      light. A promise there might indeed be creekbed below. He 
      meets eyes with Epstein.

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    We may just have creekbed down 
                    there, brother. 

      They clasp hand, that bit of wet paydirt sliding down between 
      their palms. Genuinely excited, though not exactly sure what 
      it all means just yet.

      Nevertheless, Epstein looks around at the incredible amount 
      of scree around them. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Creekbed or not, we re gonna need a 
                      locomotive to move all of this.

      EXT. DAWSON CITY - DAY

      Bill & Epstein move back through town, their excitement 
      palpable. Both men checking their wallets--

                                  BILL
                    What do you got?

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Cobwebs.

                                  BILL
                    I m sittin  on a fiver. Which 
                    should just get the claim recorded. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Gonna wrap a few things up. Meet 
                    back in 20?

      A nod from Bill. He steps into the Recorders Office.

      Epstein peels off.

      We follow him. Up the street.

      To the Loan Shop. As he steps inside--CUT TO--

      EXT. DAWSON CITY STREETS - LATER

      --Bill, emerging from the recorder s office with claim in 
      hand. That piece of paper: empowering, legitimizing. He looks 
      up, sees Father Judge on the sidewalk.                                                                                55.


                                  BILL
                    Wanted to thank you again, Father.

      Judge nods. Bill hefts his claim:

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    I m in business.

      Judge smiles knowingly:

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    So am I.

      Said as he nails a sheet of paper to a pole in front of that 
      primo plot of land mid-street, next to the brothel.

       Future Site of St. Mark s Catholic Chapel. 

      Bill eyes the declaration, the brothel, then Judge.

                                  BILL
                    You bought it.

                                  FATHER JUDGE (PLEASED) 
                    Got thoroughly ripped off, too.

      An appreciative chuckle between them.

                                  FATHER JUDGE (CONT D)
                    We come with different yearnings. 
                    But perhaps we re equally foolish 
                    in our ambition.

      They share a smile. Bill looks up. 

                                  BILL
                    You seen my friend anywhere?

      Judge shakes his head.

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    I ll come see you when you re up 
                    and running. And I ll promise not 
                    to look at your neighbors when I 
                    do.

                                  FATHER JUDGE 
                    First part, I believe. Second part, 
                    I don t believe for a minute.

      He smiles. So does Bill. Bill peels off.

      FOLLOWING BILL--surveying the streets for Epstein. No sign of 
      him. A brief sense of anxiety burgeons...

      Then Epstein comes into view. Rounding a corner. He s got a 
      wide, proud smile. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Meet our Locomotive.                                                                                56.


      As he slowly guides a meek-looking BURRO into view--CUT TO--

      EXT. DAWSON CITY / MILL - LATER

          -- LOCOMOTIVE --harnessed now with a wagon. Bill & Epstein 
      load milled wood into the wagon-bed. 

      Bill crosses to Belinda, who s considering his claim 
      document.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    It s official. Which mean s you re 
                    official now.

                                  BILL
                    You say that like it s a bad thing.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    Not necessarily. People know where 
                    to find you, that s all.

      She produces a REMINGTON ROLLING BLOCK RIFLE. Slips it into 
      his wagon. Off Bill s look, she nods over to Epstein:

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    Your friend here bought it.

                                  BILL
                    We ain t gonna be doing the firearm 
                    thing--

                                    EPSTEIN
                    After the things I seen, 
                      brother...I m not taking any 
                    chances. We can do it with my money 
                    or our money, but either way I m 
                    buying it.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (NODS)
                    Hundred.

      Epstein pays her out as Bill eyes her. 

                                  BILL (WAY TOO HIGH A PRICE) 
                    Hundred.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    Suppose you re gonna tell me it s 
                    grand larceny.

                                  BILL
                    It is.

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    Not if it saves your life it s not. 

                                  BILL
                    It s just the good samaritan in 
                    you, is it?                                                                                57.


                                    BELINDA MULRONEY
                    Nope. I just stock the things 
                    desperate men need. And watch  em 
                    shell out ungodly amounts of money 
                    to get them. It s up to them to say 
                    no. 
                          (to Epstein)
                    You saying no there, mister?

      Epstein shakes his head. He s all good. Bill eyes her a 
      moment longer, then climbs aboard the wagon. As he & Epstein 
      head out, Belinda watches. 

                                    BELINDA MULRONEY (CONT D)
                    Good luck.

      Something not insincere in that. As if she s watching yet 
      another young troop go to war, unaware of what s about to hit 
      them...

      EXT. THE CLAIM - DAY

      A week later.  August 2, 1897.  Bill & Epstein s fledgling 
      claim is coming together. Loco s methodically moving away 
      stones, revealing the first hints of prime alluvial creekbed 
      beneath the scree. 

      Bill s midway through building a cabin. He senses eyes, 
      however far away, on him.

      He looks up, sees high on the ridge, spectral forms in the 
      treeline. The Tlingit. Pushed to the peripheries by all the 
        prospecting. For a moment, he locks distant gaze with them. 
      Their faces, impassive.

      He turns then, looks down Bonanza s expanse behind him. 

      The permanent haze. The fires burning. The denuded hillsides. 
      The equipment and detritus cast about. White Man, and his 
      industry, has definitely staked its claim.

      He turns then, looks back at the Tlingit, but they re gone.

      EXT. THE CLAIM - NIGHT

      For Alaska, a  pleasant  evening. Bill and Epstein, idling 
      before the campfire. Epstein, introspective:

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Tell me again why you came up here.

                                  BILL
                    Told you. Just trying to find a 
                    piece of something that s mine. 
                    Carve out my future with my own 
                    hands. 

                                    EPSTEIN
                    I got a different take. 

      Bill gives his an inquisitive look.                                                                                58.


                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                    Think you did it for me. 

      Bill smiles. Absurd.

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                    I m the halfass here, we both know 
                    it. A man of no prospect. You on 
                    the other hand, sky s the limit. 
                    And you knew, guy like me, only way 
                    he was gonna come out this way and 
                    make something of his life, is if 
                    you went with him.  

      Bill smiles. There s truth there, even if he didn t fully 
      realize it at the time. He nevertheless coolly demurs:

                                  BILL
                    I like my theory better.

      They share a knowing smile.

                                    EPSTEIN
                    Thank you all the same, brother. 

      It s as sincere as we ll ever see him. He s genuinely moved 
      by Bill s friendship. 

      Bill nods. You bet. Epstein hefts his cup.

                                    EPSTEIN (CONT D)
                    To aiming for the moon.

      Bill hefts his own.

                                  BILL
                    Even if we don t have a chance in 
                    hell of getting there. 

      Off them, clicking cups--CUT TO--

      EXT. THE CLAIM - LATER

      --Bill, later, going out into the creek for ablutions. He 
      rinses his mouth. Washes his face.

      Standing ankle deep in the creek, he pauses. Looks down.

      A glint there in the dark water.

      He squats to get a closer look. Realizes it s not below...but 
      instead a reflection on the water of something above.

      Camera pivots as he slowly looks up--Dear God what a show-- 

      The Northern Lights. Flickering into existence across the 
      night sky. 

      And for a moment we revel in it along with Bill. It s 
      staggering.                                                                                59.


      If only for a moment, alone worth coming this entire way...

                                  BILL(V.O.)
                    It s hard to describe. The feeling 
                    of arrival, of accomplishment, of 
                    having come this whole way and 
                    staking a small piece of the world 
                    for yourself, however tiny that 
                    stake was. It was ours. Down to the 
                    center of the earth, we d earned 
                    that plot of land. It gave you a 
                    sense of potentiality that was as 
                    vast as the sky itself. If you 
                    could do this, what else could you 
                    do? And perhaps in that was the 
                    real wealth to was gained: The 
                    sense that nothing in the world 
                    could stop us. 

      We linger with Bill, his wonder at that sky above...then...

      A gunshot rings out.

      Bill wheels, sees that FLAMES are starting to kick up around 
      their cabin.

      He races back across the creek, but before he can get to the 
      cabin, he finds Epstein, mortally wounded on bank before him. 

      Epstein struggles to say something, but he can t. Bill 
      simultaneously tries to stem the flow of the mortal wound and 
      scan the surrounding for the assailant.

      Nothing. Only darkness.

      Around them, flames lick up the cabin s timbers, consume 
      their fledgling sluice. 

      Epstein struggles, fading. As a last act, he reaches up, 
      seizes Bill s hand, the one he s attempted to stanch the 
      blood s flow with.

      In those hands, that scant beats before together held the 
      promise of newfound paydirt, now only blood.

      Then Epstein expires.

      Bill, horrified, scans the environs again.  

      He scrambles across the dirt, grabs the Remington. Returns to 
      Epstein s body. 

      OFF BILL, a tiny man with his friend dead in his arms, a gun 
      unfamiliar but necessary in his hands, surrounded by the 
      illimitable expanse of night and all its unseen threat...

      Nothing but fog as far as the eye can see. We could be 
      anywhere. The Himalayas, Norway... Heaven. 

      Our view drifts with the fog as it curls over a puddle of 
      BLOOD (we are definitely not in heaven)... Words appear on 
      screen:

        OUTSIDE DAWSON - ALASKA TERRITORY

      WE MOVE UP the body of EPSTEIN. Eyes open and glassy. A 
      figure stands over him.

      It s Bill. Eyes bloodshot. There are tears somewhere back 
      there. He leans over his friend. Puts his head on his chest. 

      ANGLE ON THE TWO BEST FRIENDS 

      Bill s breath is visible, coming out in short bursts. No 
      breath comes from Epstein s mouth.

      The living and the dead.

      Tenderly, Bill closes Epstein s eyes. He loves this man. He 
      lifts him and places him on a makeshift cart.

      Now there are truly tears in Bill s eyes.

      EXT. TRAIL TO DAWSON - LATER

      Bill emerges from the fog, dragging the cart on which lies 
      his best friend. Exhausted eyes filled with ragged 
      determination. 

      A blanket covers Epstein s body. A single booted foot sticks 
      out. 

      EMBOSSED ON THE LEATHER OF THE BOOT

      is the image of a cowboy whirling a lasso--an emblem of the 
      adventurous creed Epstein lived by.

      ANOTHER SWADDLED FIGURE

      passes in the fog. A HARD-FACED woman, also dragging a cart. 
      Cargo covered with an oil cloth. Her cart hits a bump.

      A DEAD hand drops out from under the oil cloth. Small. White. 
      A child s hand. 

      Death a common occurrence here.

      Bill looks away... rattled. This is not the world he wants 
      the world to be.                                                                                      2.


      EXT. TOWN OF DAWSON - LATER

      Weak early morning light cuts through the fog. Bill pulls the 
      cart through the near-empty street. He pauses to stare around 
      him. 

      A BAR

      is the only commercial enterprise open at this early hour. 

      INT. BAR

      LAUGHTER and LOUD TALK dims as ...

      ... a Bill enters, walks up to THE BARTENDER.

                                  BILL
                          (quiet)
                    Where can I find the law?

      THE BARTENDER--skinny, sweaty, drunk--heads toward him from 
      behind the bar. 

                                  BARTENDER
                    Ain t no law around here. 

      Voice of a patron,  You re IN the Town Hall.  

      The bartender notes Bill s bulky cart through the window. 
      Doffs his dirty woolen hat in deference. 

                                  BARTENDER (CONT D)
                    Mortuary ain t open yet. Animals 
                    gonna get him, you leave him 
                    outside.

                                  BILL
                          (intently)
                    He doesn t need a mortuary. I 
                    intend to take him home. 

                                  PATRON
                    Don t look like he s got a lotta 
                    walking in him.

      Bill turns... Stares with searing eyes at the patron who made 
      a joke about his dead friend. 

                                  BILL
                    You make jokes about funny things.

                                  PATRON
                    You re supposed to make jokes about 
                    funny things.                                                                                      3.


      Man s amped up on booze. A kid nearly, but grown big and 
      strong. Rises from his stool. Legs shifting, everything about 
      him shifting.

      Just Itching for a fight.

      A hand grabs Bill s shoulder. It s Soapy.

                                  SOAPY
                    Hey, hey... Don t let him in, don t 
                    let him in. Your brains ll be 
                    mixing in with the sawdust.

      Bill allows himself to be pulled toward a stool a bit further 
      down the bar.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                          (to bartender)
                    Give my friend a drink.

      The bartender pours. Soapy pushes away the glass.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    Not that cedar bark shite. The good 
                    stuff. Only the good stuff for my 
                    friend.

      Turns ingratiatingly to Bill.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    You pay me back later, huh?

      A drink is put before Bill, He gulps it down. It lightens him 
      a bit. 

      He turns to the window. Outside, a few stragglers pass on the 
      packed clay street. Across the street, stand a row of 
      stores... all shut down.

                                  BILL
                    Why s all the stores closed up?

      Soapy stares at Bill. Does he really not know?

                                  SOAPY
                    Because it s midnight.

      Bill s fatigued eyes wince in the sunlight coming through the 
      window. A world where even the sun s upside down.

                                  BILL
                          (some urgency now)
                    When s the next boat out of here?                                                                                      4.


                                  SOAPY
                    I ll answer you straight. I see 
                    you re an honest man and your query 
                    deserves an honest answer. Boat 
                    comes in two days...

      Soapy makes his face go sad in an almost Kabuki way.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                     ... but your friend won t be on 
                    it. 

      Referring to the cargo just outside the bar. A tremble of 
      anger goes down Bill s spine.

                                  BILL
                    Why s that, grifter?

                                  SOAPY
                          (to bartender)
                    Give my friend another drink.

      Bill pushes away his glass. Doesn t want another drink.

                                  BILL
                         (anger beginning to boil)
                    Why won t he be on the boat?

      Soapy can t contain his giddiness any longer.

                                  SOAPY
                    Because he s DAY--ED!

      Soapy CACKLES with laughter. A few other patrons join in. 
      Bill whips around him. 

      Bill only now takes in his surroundings. Patrons all staring 
      at him. A dream-like hostility palpable in the dusky light 
      from kerosene lanterns.

      Bill is definitely the outsider here.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    Death brings death. I for one try 
                    to stay away from it lest I catch 
                    what it s got. Boat captains think 
                    like I do. All of us here and I m 
                    including you in my arithmetric, we 
                    don t leave when we re healthy?

      He pauses for dramatic emphasis... then speaks ominously.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    We gonna be buried here. That s a 
                    fact. You look hearty now, but no 
                    one can speak to the future.                                                                                      5.


      A threat there. Soapy stares at Bill with what he thinks is a 
      wise expression.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    The future s wanton.

                                  BILL
                    You take the scenic route, get 
                    where you going, don t you? Let s 
                    hear your pitch, grifter.

                                  SOAPY
                    I got the gift of gab. A curse and 
                      a blessing. Here s how it is.

      A different look in Soapy s eyes now. Business excites him. 
      He lives for it.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    Just because your partner s gonna 
                    be buried in this hard, cold clay, 
                    don t mean a man such as you, with 
                    other options, got to. 

                                  BILL
                    What other options?

      Soapy s eyes are afire with the sexiness of this 
      opportunity... for him.

                                  SOAPY
                    Your claim.

      Bill glances around him. Everyone seems to be listening to 
      the conversation. Awaiting his response

                                  BILL
                    It ain t even been dug on. Might 
                    yield nothing.

                                  SOAPY
                    You used a great word there. Might. 
                    Might be something. Might be 
                    nothing. That s the beauty of a 
                    claim such as yours, staked up in 
                    the hill, the only one so far. It 
                    could be anything.

      Soapy s eyes are searing. He may not be the brightest guy in 
      the world, but he has an uncanny understanding of what we 
      call the bottom line.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    What you got to understand is, the 
                    folks around here are hungry for 
                    gold. They ve travelled a thousand 
                    miles for it. Nearly died for it. 
(MORE)                                                                                      6.

SOAPY (CONT D)
                    Images of gold pass before their 
                    eyes before they sleep.

      Soapy lowers his voice so he will not be heard by the patrons 
      around him, all straining to hear their tete e tete. 

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    A great deal of money will be 
                    invested in ignorance when the need 
                    for delusion is deep. And what you 
                    got in your claim is a beautiful 
                    delusion. Right now, it s un-
                    examined. As you say, un-dug... 

      Bill is staring hard at Soapy. This has been a revelatory 
      conversation.

                                  BILL
                    And you want to be the middle man 
                    for my delusion? Sell it when it s 
                    hot.

                                  SOAPY
                    My proposition is this, and the 
                    deal is over the moment your spade 
                    touches soil. I will pay you one 
                    hundred dollars for your claim AND 
                    I will pay your boat fare out of 
                    Dawson. In legal tender, or gold. 
                    Your choice. Maybe you want gold. 
                    Tell the folks back home, you dug 
                    it out yourself. Be a bit of a 
                    hero.

      There may have been a whiff of temptation to the offer... but 
      Soapy s last statement is beyond offensive to him.

                                  BILL
                    Listen to me and tell this to 
                    anyone wants to know my intentions. 

      Soapy had been talking in a whisper, but Bill makes his voice 
      loud enough for all to hear.

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                          (eyes searing)
                    I m not leaving Dawson until my 
                    friend gets justice.

                                  PATRON
                    Jew already got his justice.

      This from the patron who tried to pick a fight with Bill 
      earlier. He s been waiting for this moment.

      Bill has reached what he thinks is the end of his rope 
      (actually it s a long, long rope).                                                                                      7.


      The pugnacious patron grins a grinny grin grin. Which 
      evaporates as Bill tackles him.

      THE TWO MEN

      CRASH over a table, splintering it. Bill s opponent lashes 
      out at Bill with a broken beer mug... It hits the side of his 
      forehead.

      The patron has the upper hand. Punches Bill hard in the face, 
      grinning. He loves this shit. But Bill scissors his legs 
      around the patron s legs, flipping him. 

      BILL S OPPONENT

      is under Bill now. But in the tumult, he s pulled a knife. 
      The knife is at Bill s throat. Bill holds the blade back with 
      his left hand. 

      BLOOD

      seeps out onto the blade as it cuts through the flesh of 
      Bill s palm. Excruciating to watch. In seconds the knife will 
      cut through his hand.

      Bill elbows the patron in his face with his free arm... and 
      the knife drops. Bill punches his opponent in the face so 
      hard, the man nearly passes out.

      Bill rises, kicks the knife across the sawdust-spattered 
      floor. 

      Bill s hand is bloody. So is his forehead. He glares at the 
      patrons, all gathered around watching. Bill looks half 
      crazed. 

                                  BILL
                          (growls it out)
                    You re not getting rid of me that 
                    easily. You re not getting rid of 
                    me.

      But the patrons are no longer staring at Bill. They are 
      staring past him... at a commotion out the window. Bill whips 
      around.

      THROUGH THE WINDOW

      we see A SMALL CROWD surrounding Epstein s body. Vultures 
      over carrion.

      EXT. SALOON - SAME TIME

      Bill SLAMS his way through the crowd. Dispersing them.                                                                                       8.


      EPSTEIN S CORPSE

      is half off the cart now. Jostled. Picked over. 

      HIS DEAD FEET

      wear only socks. 

      Bill shouts impotently at the now-empty street

                                  BILL
                    Goddamit, you took his boots!! What 
                    kind of man would steal a dead 
                    man s...

      But he doesn t bother saying the rest of the sentence. 

      BILL S EXHAUSTED EYES

      say it all. He s in the third circle. 

      ANGLE ON BARTENDER

      behind the sanctuary of his bar. 

                                  BARTENDER
                          (cracked smile)
                    Animals got him.

      ACT TWO

      ANGLE ON EPSTEIN

      lying on hard, frozen earth now. OUR VIEW loosens to reveal 
      he s lying in a veritable garden of bodies. We are:  

      EXT. MORTUARY - MORNING

      THE MORTICIAN--the plumpest man in Dawson--stands with Bill 
      over the corpse. Wind whips his hair. We can feel the chill.

                                  MORTICIAN
                    I m sorry, sir. No way we can bury 
                    him today. No way, no how. Too many, 
                    um... passengers ahead of him. 

      Bill puts two more coins into the mortician s hands. The 
      mortician nods gravely.

                                  MORTICIAN (CONT D)
                    We will hasten to dispatch him to 
                    the angels.

      ON BELINDA

      entering the area as Bill is leaving. She is dressed somberly 
      for the occasion, but her dress clings. It can t help itself. 

                                    BELINDA
                    I heard about what happened. I came 
                    to pay my respects.

                                  BILL
                    I hope he s in a better place.

      Glances with distaste at his surroundings. Remembers his 
      manners.

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    Thanks for coming. He would have 
                      appreciated it.

      Belinda holds him with her very presence. She enjoys this 
      kind of power. Belinda wipes a tiny bit of oil under her 
      nose. Offers her vial to him.

                                    BELINDA
                    Mint oil. For the smell. 

      Knew he d refuse. Puts the vial back in her purse.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    May I ask your intentions? Will you 
                    plunge into your virgin claim, or 
                    will you be going home? Back to 
                    Maine is it?                                                                                    10.


                                  BILL
                    Vermont. 

                                    BELINDA
                    Vermont. First state in the union 
                    to allow female suffrage. 
                          (musing)
                    Seemed important when I lived in 
                    the  lower 45. Now seems quaint.  
                    Voting for which man will have 
                    power over you.

      She stares appraisingly at him.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    I like you. Selfishly I d like you 
                    around. But your friend drew fire 
                    on account of, I believe, where you 
                    and he staked your claim. I worry 
                    about you.

                                  BILL
                    Your worry will be my good luck 
                    charm. 

                                    BELINDA
                    I hope it works. 

      Bill nods, gives her a quick smile and heads out. Belinda 
      stares after him, in no hurry. She s never in a hurry. 

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    He was a good friend, wasn t he?

      Bill turns. Something different about Belinda now. Genuine 
      feeling in her eyes. 

                                  BILL
                          (emotionally)
                    Yes he was.

      Belinda moves toward him. She takes his hand in hers. 

                                    BELINDA
                       (almost to herself)
                    I haven t had many true friends.

      She touches her whole palm to his chest. Feeling him. Not 
      really sexual... but a touch is a touch. 

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                          (means it)
                    Good friends are more valuable than 
                    gold.

      Belinda moves off. She likes making her own exit rather than 
      being exited upon.                                                                                    11.


      EXT. DRY GOODS STORE - DAY

      The door opens to reveal Father Judge, face red from work. 
      Behind him, we see shelves smashed, new lumber stacked. He s 
      building his church.

      Bill stands before him. Father Judge stares intensely at him, 
      as if trying to figure him out.

                                  BILL
                    You ve probably heard that my 
                    friend is no more.

                                  JUDGE
                    I have heard.

                                  BILL
                    If it s not too much trouble, 
                    Father, would you conduct a 
                    ceremony over his grave? It would 
                    be very meaningful to his family... 
                    and to me. 

      Father Judge hesitates. Compassion in his eyes.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    I can t do a Christian rite for a 
                    Jew...

      Bill s upbringing allows no disrespect for a member of the 
      church.

                                  BILL
                      I understand.

      He turns away , trying not to show his anger. Father Judge 
      holds him back with the rest of his sentence.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    ... But I will perform the Jewish 
                    rite of Kaddish. 

      Bill stares at Father Judge. This is the first real human 
      moment he s had since Epstein died. 

      And it brings tears to his eyes.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      ANGLE ON EPSTEIN

      lying on a block of ice at the end of the dry goods store. 
      Bill touches Epstein s cold face. Possibly his last touch.

      And then he does what he s been avoiding doing. He reaches 
      into the lining of Epstein s vest.                                                                                     12.


      All the blood leaves  Bill s face. Bill frantically checks 
      Epstein s other pockets.

                                  FATHER JUDGE (CONT D)
                    What are you looking for, son?

      Bill stares at father Judge but he isn t listening. He 
      hurries off. Father Judge s eyes are searing.

                                  FATHER JUDGE (CONT D)
                    God has been aloof. The hands of 
                    men have battered you. Take heed 
                    when god touches you.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      INT. BILL AND EPSTEIN S TENT - LATER

      Bill frantically whips through the tent, checking every 
      possible hiding place. Shakes out the sleep wear. Empties the 
      packs. Rushes outside.

      EXT. CLAIM - SAME TIME

      Bill searches the outside environs. Examines the saddlebags 
      on Loco (he and Epstein s donkey. Turns, sensing something.

      A FEW FEET AWAY

      A MAN sits with his back against a tree. Big brown mustache, 
      crinkled blue eyes, smoking a corn-cob pipe. Like one of 
      those faces from a Klondike photo. MEEKOR. 

      He seems to be enjoying the day.

                                  MEEKOR
                          (casually)
                    You smoke?

      Bill stares at him, wide-eyed, rattled.

                                  BILL
                    No, I do not.

      Goes back to searching.

                                  MEEKOR
                    Should take it up. Helps with the 
                      mosquitos.

      Bill is running out of areas to search.

                                  MEEKOR (CONT D)
                          (faintest interest)
                    What you looking for?                                                                                    13.


      Bill responds without looking up.

                                  BILL
                    My partner s claim.

                                  MEEKOR
                          (nods)
                    Got it.

      Bill rummages around the spent fire... is totally caught up 
      in his search. Slowly stops. Looks back up at Meekor.

                                  BILL
                    That mean you understand what I 
                    just said?

                                  MEEKOR
                    Nope. Got it.

      He produces the claim from his vest pocket. 

      Bill lunges at Meekor. Pushes him up against the tree. 

                                  BILL
                    You take it out of a dead man s 
                    pockets?

      Meekor doesn t seem the tiniest bit rattled.

                                  MEEKOR
                    No, sir. Wouldn t do that.

      Bill lets him go. He stares at Meekor as if staring at 
      someone not quite of this world.

                                  BILL
                    Stay right there.

      Bill backs up toward his tent without taking his eyes off 
      Meekor. Reaches in... fumbles around, pulls out a pistol. 

      Something stops Bill from actually pointing it at Meekor 
      though. He holds it at his side. Threat enough.

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    I m going to give you exactly three 
                    seconds to tell me how you got a 
                    hold of that claim.

                                  MEEKOR
                    Don t know if I can do that in 
                    three seconds.

      Bill s eyes widen with growing frustration. 

                                  BILL
                    You can take more time.                                                                                    14.


                                  MEEKOR
                    Around yesterday, your partner, Mr. 
                    Epstein, came into a loan shop for 
                    a loan. For supplies and such.

                                  BILL
                    And the owner of the loan shop took 
                    his claim for collateral? That it?!

      Meekor is a bit thrown by Bill s genius.

                                  MEEKOR
                    Answers come faster when the 
                      questioner helps  em along I guess.

                                  BILL
                    And you have some kind of 
                      controlling interest in this loan 
                    shop?

                                  MEEKOR
                    Control and interest are two 
                    separate things in my book. I m 
                      interested in fish... but can t 
                    make  em bite.

      Getting answers from Meekor is like punching a marshmallow. 

                                  BILL
                    Who do you work for?

                                  MEEKOR
                    I don t work for anyone. Just do 
                    things on my own that people pay me 
                    for. 

      Meekor s logic is starting to make Bill s head explode. He is 
      close to doing violence to him.

                                  BILL
                    Who owns the goddam loan shop? 

                                  MEEKOR
                    Would have saved some time you d 
                    asked that question to begin with. 
                    Since you re in such a hurry.

      He is in the process of re-lighting his pipe. It takes a 
      moment.

                                  MEEKOR (CONT D)
                    Belinda Mulroney owns the loan shop 
                    and thus, your partner s half of 
                    the claim, which I am being paid to 
                    work.                                                                                     15.


                                  BILL
                    So Belinda s my new partner.
                          (eyes searing)
                      Convenient for her my first partner 
                    got killed.

      ACT THREE

      A BLACK SKY

      glowers over the infinite expanse of Spruce and rock that is 
      Alaska in spring. A human-less wilderness of virgin nature. 
      God s country...

      ... and God is angry. Thunder BOOMS as...

      DIAGONAL SHEETS OF RAIN

      puncture a million holes in the water of the Klondike river. 

      ON THE BANKS OF THE ROILING RIVER

      the miners look tiny, putting up sandbags--a bulwark against 
      flooding.

      The rain connects everything. It consumes the universe.

      THE CEMETERY

      is a furiously pocked pond, grave stones sticking out like 
      teeth in a huge mouth. 

      ON BILL

      moving quickly through the street of Dawson. Rain-slammed... 
      but so consumed with his mission of the moment, he hardly 
      notices.

      He passes Jack London heading in the opposite direction, 
      holding up a ladies parasol, his mangy dog walking beside 
      him. Yes, a ladies parasol. 

      Jack sees Bill and does an about face. Walks with Bill, 
      holding the parasol over both of them.

                                  JACK LONDON
                    The man of the moment. Man who can 
                    put me in liquor for a week. 
                          (thinks better of it)
                    A few days anyway. 

                                  BILL
                    How can I help you?
                          (amused despite himself)
                    You know that thing doesn t work? 
                    It s paper.

      Referring to the parasol... water gushing right through.

                                  JACK
                    Gives me something to blame for 
                    getting wet though. Which way do I 
                    bet, friend? 
(MORE)                                                                                    17.

JACK (CONT'D)
                    Soapy has a pool going. One says 
                    you re staying in Dawson. The other 
                    says you re gone on the next boat. 
                    Remember, I m no good without my 
                    liquor and I am the closest thing 
                    to civilization for ten thousand 
                    miles. Civilization depends on your 
                    answer.

                                  BILL
                    What are the odds?

                                  JACK 
                    Even odds. You re inscrutable. 
                      Unguessable. Not to mention 
                      important. You re the most 
                    important man in town right now. 
                    Next to me. At least while the 
                    betting pool is on. 

                                  BILL
                    I m not anything. 

      Whirls on him. A charged emotion in his eyes.

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    I m just another man burning 
                    daylight and wasting gravity.

      Speaks to the mood he s in. He charges forward into  The 
      Dawson Grande Hotel... 

      ... leaving Jack in the middle of the street with his wilted 
      parasol. Jack pulls out a notebook, hunches over it so it 
      doesn t get wet.

                                  JACK 
                          (muttering)
                     Burning daylight. 

      Scribbles the words down.

      EXT. BELINDA S PRIVATE CHAMBERS

      Several large men of the bearded variety guard the door. Bill 
      stands there, dripping wet. Pissed at having to be kept 
      waiting. 

      One of the bearded men gestures for Bill to come in and Bill 
      pushes past him, accidentally on purpose jostling him.

      INT. BELINDA S PRIVATE CHAMBERS 

      Bill enters and pauses. The room is grandly feminine, with 
      hand-carved curlicues in the wainscotting and mother-of-pearl 
        chandeliers. A FANTASY of heaven in the third circle of hell.                                                                                     18.


      Bill stands in the center of this femininity--a rain-soaked 
      man in muddy boots.

      Belinda emerges from another chamber.

                                    BELINDA
                    Sorry to keep you waiting. I was 
                    making myself fragrant. 

      She is spectacular. Her dress looks like it was made out of 
      gold hammered so thin it could shimmer in a breeze. 

      She looks like the Goddess of Gold.

      Bill came here pissed as hell. He has to fight to hold onto 
      his drive.

                                  BILL
                    I like to know when I m getting a 
                    new friend. I m too old to have 
                    someone dropped off at my house to 
                    play with.

                                    BELINDA
                    So you met Meekor. 

      She drapes herself on the couch near him.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    Don t be petulant. I own half of 
                    your claim. I need to protect my 
                      investment.
                          (beat)
                    Meekor was an inevitability. Why 
                    warn someone about an 
                      inevitability? 

                                  BILL
                    Is that what you are? An 
                      inevitability? Who lives, who dies. 
                    You decide with a fetching wave of 
                    your hand.

                                    BELINDA
                    Are you accusing me of something?

      A slight break in her voice. He stares at her. Her green-blue 
      eyes show just a hint of hurt. 

      Still staring at her, he shakes his head. 

                                  BILL
                    No.

      Belinda folds her feelings back into herself.                                                                                    19.


                                    BELINDA
                    Gold is a fool s errand, honey. I 
                    wouldn t kill for it. 

      Her manner is casual, but not her eyes.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    I m building Xanadu.
                          (off his look)
                    I thought you were an educated man.
                          (quotes)
                     In Xanadu, did Kubla Khan, a 
                    stately pleasure dome decree.  Gold 
                    has brought people to this 
                      uncivilized wilderness but it s 
                      civilization gonna make  em stay. 
                          (off Bill s look)
                    And, no, I m not building an ice 
                    palace in Dawson. I m building a 
                    hotel. The largest, grandest hotel 
                    in America. Baccarat crystal, 
                    velvet couches. It s all been 
                    ordered. While you dream of gold, I 
                    use gold to make dreams.

      She heads to her marble-topped desk. Opens the lid of a blue 
      cloisonne jewel box. Inside are stacks of (gold backed) 
      hundred dollar bills. Holds up a wad of bills.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    Know why these are better than 
                    gold?

      No Bill doesn t know.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                          (smiles)
                    Easier to count.

      She leans against her desk, staring at Bill.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    You should take Sope s offer. Sell 
                    your mud hole and head back to 
                    Maine.

                                  BILL
                    Vermont. 

                                    BELINDA
                    It doesn t matter. Both are away 
                    from here.

      She stares emotionally at him.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    You don t belong here.                                                                                    20.


                                  BILL
                    I don t think so. 

      Belinda simmers... fetchingly. 

                                    BELINDA
                    What s your game? Justice? 
                      Vengeance? 
                          (quietly strong)
                    Men always have a mission. Make up 
                    for the fact they can t give birth. 
                    Women are born with a mission. Men 
                    gotta make them up. Do you write to 
                    your mother?

      She puts herself between him and the doorway, knowing he 
      won t just push her away. 

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    World is divided between men who 
                    write their mothers and men who 
                    don t. 

                                  BILL
                    Do you write to yours? 

                                    BELINDA
                    I killed my ma.
                          (beat)
                    She died as I exited her womb. Left 
                    me to the vagaries of the world. 

      Bill gently lifts her up and places her out of his way. He 
      heads toward the door. Stops... amused by something.

                                  BILL
                    Your mother birthed you... and 
                    you re birthing a hotel. I think 
                    your mother has the edge.

                                    BELINDA
                    It s not a competition.
                          (hits her)
                    Was that a compliment?

                                  BILL
                    You ll know when I m making a 
                      compliment.

                                    BELINDA
                          (beat)
                    You really don t know, do you?

      Bill pauses in the doorway.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    If you re staying or going.                                                                                    21.


      Bill holds her gaze for a moment. His gaze is unwavering... 
      but it does not give answers. He walks off.

      She stares after him. Her blue-green eyes shine with tears. 

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    I wish it had been a compliment.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      ON BILL

      charging forward, head bent, as the rain lashes down with 
      renewed brutality on the now-mud-sloshed streets of Dawson. 
      OUR VIEW whips away from him to...

      A COCK-EYED SIGN

      nailed against a dilapidated structure. Faded words read 
      (without irony)  DRY GOODS . ROUGH HANDS pull off the sign. 
      The hands belong to Father Judge.

      The Dry Goods store is officially no longer a dry goods 
      Store.

      INT. FORMER DRY GOODS STORE - SAME TIME

      Father judge tosses the sign onto a large heap of rotten wall-
      boards. He s been single-handedly turning the store into a 
      church.

      It s a bit of a disaster now. All that s left of the store is  
      the counter. The shelves have all been splintered and tossed 
      into a heap.

      There are maybe a hundred leaks in the ceiling. It s all but 
      raining in here. 

      A KNOCKING on the door. Father Judge turns, surprised. Who 
      would be calling in this storm? 

      THE DOOR

      is opened to reveal A TALL MAN with a patchy black beard, 
      wearing a black, seal-skin rain coat and strange looking rain-
      hat.

      He is  THE COUNT .  

                                  COUNT
                          (slight German accent)
                    I am Charles Eugene Schultz. But my 
                      friends... and enemies... call me 
                    The Count.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    What can I do for you?                                                                                    22.


        Histrionically, the count removes his hat. A gesture of-jokey 
      deference.

                                  COUNT
                          (humble voice)
                    Forgive me but I have sinned.
                          (beat)
                    I would like to make a confession.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. FATHER JUDGE S  CHURCH  - MOMENTS LATER 

      Father Judge sits across from The Count as rain pours down 
      around them from the leaky roof.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    What do you have to confess?

      The Count s face is all penitence and sorrow.

                                  COUNT
                    Arson and murder.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                          (reacts)
                    When did you commit these acts?

                                  COUNT
                    I haven t committed them yet.

      He smiles a humorless smile. Stares at father judge until he 
      understands the implicit threat.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    Do you care to be more forthright, 
                    sir?

      Father Judge s eyes burn. We haven t seen him angry yet. But 
      he does get angry.

      The Count stares around him.

                                  COUNT
                    This watering can will be your new 
                    church, huh?  

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    If God s willing.

                                  COUNT
                    God is not willing, Father. This is 
                    prime real estate. Right in the 
                    middle of Dawson. Many others have 
                    had their eye on it. I am a 
                    Lutheran, friend.                                                                                    23.


                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    We are not friends.

                                  COUNT
                          (stares him down)
                    During my lifetime, I will not have 
                    a papal atrocity built in my back 
                    yard. My future sins will attest to 
                    that. 

      Father Judge stares him down.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    You intend to burn down my church 
                    and murder me in it.

                                  COUNT
                    So you see, my mortal soul is at 
                    stake.
                          (beat)
                    You have a day to vacate.

      The Count heads toward the doorway... then pauses. 

                                  COUNT (CONT D)
                          (slow smile)
                    Aren t you going to offer 
                      penance... for my future sins.

      Father Judge s eyes are red. Old Testament eyes.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    Your penance is being who you are.

      The Count stares back. Eyes take in the water pouring down 
      through the sieve of a roof.

                                  COUNT
                    Your roof is leaking, Father. 

      Stares intently at father Judge. Making his last words sound 
      personal.

                                  COUNT (CONT D)
                    Too many leaks to be fixed. 

      And he heads off into the rain, sleek as a seal.

      ON FATHER JUDGE

      returning to his  church,  lost in thought, eyes harrowed.

      Alone (very much alone) Father Judge goes back to work , 
      smashing in the broken-down counter of the former Dry Goods 
      Store with an axe.                                                                                     24.


      Hard labor making him sweat. He removes his vestments 
        revealing...

      A VERTICAL SCAR

      It goes down his chest from neck to navel. Like he was 
      gutted... and it didn t take. 

      ON FATHER JUDGE

      Rage in his eyes now... SLAMMING the axe harder and harder 
      against the old splintering wood of the former store counter. 

      Grey hair wild. Scar reddening.

      A different kind of priest.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      ANGLE ON HEAVY BOOTS

      sloshing through mud. Soaked through and through. The owner 
      of the boots may as well be barefoot. 

      ON BILL 

      heading toward his claim through visible sheets of rain... 
      eyes alert now. Every part of him alert. 

      OUR VIEW passes along the mining encampments along the 
      swollen Klondike. Everywhere, miners are bustling about, 
      putting up sandbags, reenforcing their structures.

      Almost everyone looks up as Bill passes. Pause in their work 
      to stare. It s unnerving.  

      ONE MAN (standing just outside his structure)

      regards Bill with an extra challenge in his gaze. OUR VIEW 
      drifts down to his feet.

      He is wearing Epstein s boots. (We recognize the embossed 
      cowboy with the lasso).

      A charge comes into Bill s eyes. He starts to move toward 
      this man as... 

      ... THE MAN S BROTHERS emerge from the tent, cold eyes on 
      him. One is whittling a piece of wood with a large knife. 

      Two boys have also emerged from the tent and are clinging to 
      the men s pants. Big, curious... unfriendly eyes.

                                  BILL
                      (to booted miner; growls it out)
                    We ll talk alone sometime.                                                                                    25.


      Continues on, glaring back at the man with Epstein s boots. 

      ON BILL

      arriving at his claim. 

      Meekor is in the midst of tying forked sticks on the base of 
      his structure with triple wrapped bark. He smokes his corn 
      cob pipe as he works. Glances at Bill. 

                                  MEKOR
                    Oughta move your structure to 
                    higher ground.

      Bill is in no mood for Meekor. He s just seen a man wearing 
      his dead friend s boots. 

      Bill storms toward him (Meekor remains standing and smoking; 
      has a kind of Zen quality). Bill has to shout above the rain.

                                  BILL
                    This is the way it s gonna work. You 
                    stay in your area, I stay in mine! 
                    You don t say anything to me, you 
                    don t make small talk, you don t give 
                    me advice! Far as I m concerned, 
                    you re part of the mountain.

                                  MEEKOR
                    Which part?

      Bill stares at him in disbelief. Did he really ask that? 

                                  BILL
                    The part that s quiet and don t 
                    move!

      Bill storms toward his tent.

                                  MEEKOR
                    Not all parts like that.

      Bill turns... is about to let Meekor have it, but pauses at 
      the image of the mining camp spread out before him. Bill and 
      Meekor s quarrel had been louder than Bill thought. 

      A HUNDRED HOSTILE EYES

      are fixed on him, one of them probably a murderer.

      Bill pulls out a pistol, puts it into his pants for ready 
      use. He stares right back at the miners, ready for anything. 
      He goes back into his tent.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    26.


      INT. BILL S TENT - NIGHT

      Bill is in his tent. A single candle is burning. It sounds 
      like a thousand thumb tacks are hitting the canvas of his 
      tent. The rain. With each gust of wind the canvas of the tent 
      billows and shifts, threatens to blow over.

      Pen in hand, Bill is writing a letter to, yes... his mother. 

      OUR VIEW moves through the detritus of the mining settlement 
      past gaunt, tired faces, and rugged nature (spruce trees, 
      lashed by wind and rain, growing out of cracks in rocks), as 
      we hear Bill s voice.  

                                  BILL (V.O.)
                    Dear Mother, I find myself a 
                    stranger in a strange but beautiful 
                    land. This is a place they say 
                    where the gold fairly sticks out of 
                    the dirt. I saw a man recently 
                    carrying a nugget the size of an 
                    apple. Like one of those on our 
                    trees out back....But sadness has 
                    followed us. Epstein is dead. 
                    Murdered by a savage, and cowardly 
                    man. I know not who. I know not 
                    how. The Klondike seems hardly real 
                    without him.  To Go for the Moon 
                    whether we get there or not --
                    that s what we promised each other. 
                    An optimists s giddy plan or a 
                    fool s journey? I fear the latter 
                    now. All is rendered hollow as I 
                    write this. I expect to see you 
                    soon. As soon as I can lay my 
                    friend to God s care, and bring the 
                      perpetrator to justice, if there is 
                    justice to be had up here where no 
                    law has yet reached. Your face 
                    brings me comfort. In my mind. And 
                    soon in my sight.

      He hesitates, then writes the last words.

                                  BILL (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ... I will be home soon.

      A BOOMING CRASH OF THUNDER

      breaks  the silence.

      THROUGH A GAP IN THE TENT FLAPS

      we see the top of the denuded mountain BLEACHED in a flash of 
      lightning. A single spruce tree stands on the summit like a 
      flag.                                                                                    27.


      ANOTHER FLASH OF LIGHTNING

      makes instant daylight out of the mountain peak. The spruce 
      tree is no longer at the summit. It is several yards down the 
      slope now. 

      It s like the mountain is moving.

      Suddenly, there s A TERRIBLE RUMBLING. This can t be good. 
      Beneath the sound, we hear the TINY SHOUTS of other miners.

      Bill exits his tent just in time to see...

      THE MOUNTAIN

      slide away from itself... rushing inexorably downward. Bill 
      grabs at his tent as A TSUNAMI OF MUD hits...

      ...carrying him, the tent, everything in its path down the 
      slope with the force of a hundred freight trains.

      ON BILL

      struggling  in the fast-moving mud as it pulls him down the 
      slope. He goes down, sunk in it. 

      The mud settles a bit... and miraculously, Bill rises--mud 
      covered, pounds and pounds of mud cloaking him. He stares at 
      the slope above him and sees the horrific sight of...

      MINERS 

      scattering as another SEA OF MUD slams down off the mountain. 
      We glimpse the horror of a mother clutching her seven year 
      old s hand hardly having the time to react as the mud 
      engulfs, making them part of the earth. 

      Other miners are carried off like sticks in a waterfall. 

      Bill struggles frantically up the hill.

      THE ENCAMPMENT

      We re in the first moments after the disaster. CHAOS 
      everywhere. The injured SCREAMING. Miners pulling other 
      miners out of the mud. OUR VIEW whips to...

      A MAN COVERED HEAD TO TOE WITH MUD standing stock still (a 
      mud snowman) a jagged piece of wood piercing his shoulder. He 
      doesn t appear to know where he is.

      A mud-covered Bill (barely recognizable) claws through the 
      mud at the structure where he saw mother and child engulfed.                                                                                    28.


      Grabs a hand. Pulls A WOMAN out from under a heavy blanket of 
      mud. Barely alive. She gestures frantically. Her eyes the 
      only thing human in her mud visage.

                                  WOMAN
                    My boy! My boy!

      She stares frantically at Bill.

                                  WOMAN (CONT D)
                    I was holding his hand! I couldn t 
                    hold on! He slipped away!

      Bill pushes aside feet of mud... sees a broken structure 
      beneath. Slides down.

      ON BILL

      looking through a disaster of broken pilings and thick walls 
      of mud. He hears A CHILD S SHOUTS. The kid s alive. 

      Bill plunges deeper. Reaches through a hole in the cedar 
      smaller than a head. 

      FINGERS touch his fingers. It s the kid, stuck in a blocked-
      in crawl space. The kid is CRYING.

      OUTSIDE THE COLLAPSED STRUCTURE

      OTHER MINERS have gathered, trying to console the hysterical 
      mother. 

                                  MOTHER
                    I can hear him! He s alive!

      Bill rises up. All action now.

                                  BILL
                          (eyes wild)
                    I need oil. Something slippery. 
                    Anything.

      Most of the miners are too stunned to react. Bill goes over 
      to a gunnysack, rummages through it. 

                                  WOMAN MINER S VOICE
                    I have mineral oil.

      Bill grabs it, starts to strip while heading back to the 
      collapsed structure. Doing a dozen things art once.

                                  BILL
                    Caves in Vermont. Folks got stuck, 
                    we got  em out like this.                                                                                     29.


                                  MOTHER
                        (hysterical)
                    I don t hear him no more.

      Looks desperately to Bill who, completely naked now, lowers 
      himself into the shaft. It s true, we no longer hear the 
      child s SCREAMS. He might not have made it.

      ON BILL

      wriggling his way through the underworld of mud toward the 
      crawl space. A CEILING OF WOOD cracks audibly above him. 
      Bulges downward. Mud oozes through the crack.

      In seconds the structure will cave in. Bill wriggles further. 

      He s made it to the crawl space. He fumbles for a match. 
      Breathing heavily. Lights the match.

      THROUGH THE SMALL HOLE IN THE CRAWL SPACE

      we see A LITTLE BOY OF SEVEN sitting hunched against a 
      cracked cedar wall. In his underwear. Terrified. Big eyes 
      staring at Bill. 

                                  BILL
                    Listen to me. I need you to listen 
                    to me, okay?

      The boy nods at Bill. He s in shock.

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    I need you to come toward me.

      The boy inches toward him. Bill hands him the mineral oil 
      through the hole. Something behind Bill collapses. Fuck. Bill 
      turns frantically back to the boy.

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    Pour this over you like it s water. 
                    That s right, that s right.

      The boy has obeyed, drenched in oil now. 

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    Now you re going to have to push 
                    yourself through that hole. 

      The boy stares terrified at the hole. It s so small. 

                                  BOY
                          (pale)
                    I can t fit.

                                  BILL
                    Yes you can. It just looks like you 
                    can t.. You ever see a sea otter?
(MORE)                                                                                    30.

BILL (CONT'D)
                          (off the boy s confusion)
                    A sea otter s bigger than you, but 
                    it can get through gaps in rocks 
                    you don t think a guppy can get 
                    through. You re a sea otter. 

      The boy stares at Bill. Bill holds the boy s gaze. Can see 
      the boy trusts him. 

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    Say it,  I m a sea otter. I m a sea 
                    otter. 

      Tentatively the boy moves toward the hole. Scrunches his head 
      into it. Grimaces in pain. 

      THE CEILING OF THE CRAWL SPACE

      CRACKS OPEN behind the boy, dropping down a huge mass of mud. 
      More to follow in seconds.

      Bill grabs the boy s ears, using them like handles... and 
      using every ounce of strength... scrapes him through.

      THE CRAWL SPACE

      caves in with a CRASH behind him. 

      OUTSIDE THE STRUCTURE

      Everyone waiting and staring. There s not a sound from 
        underground. 

      And then... there s a movement in the mud. An arm. The boy s 
      father rushes over and pulls his son to his feet.

      The boy emerges from the sunken mine to tears and applause. 

                                  BOY
                          (smiling)
                    I m a sea otter.

      A DOZEN MINERS

      rush over to help Bill out of the mud. 

      EXT. ENCAMPMENT - LATER

      The camp is in a frenzy of work. Bill working amongst them. 
      People shoveling mud into the roiling river. Getting as much 
      mud out of there as possible. 

      Everyone mud-sludged. A uniformity of being.                                                                                     31.



      AERIAL VIEW - CAMP

      Miners place sandbags in a triangle ABOVE the camp. If the 
      mountain crumbles again, the mud will SLIDE around the 
      settlement. Hopefully. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      A TIN PLATE 

      filled with hot steaming brown goop is handed to a miner. 

                                    MINER S VOICE
                    Shit on a plate.

      That s exactly what it looks like. The miner who just spoke 
      hoovers it down though. We are:

      INT. GORNA S CABIN - LATE NIGHT

      Bill sits with a dozen other half-cleaned-up miners. The 
      place is cramped, stained with smoke. Bill s bright eyes 
      taking everything in.

      GORNA (the owner) moves through the structure handing out the 
      food--a small ageless woman with a thick Kentucky accent. 

      Hands a tin plate of food to Bill.

                                  GORNA
                    Wolf!

      Like it s an order. 

                                  GORNA (CONT D)
                    I like eatin  critters that wanna 
                    eat me. 

      LAUGHS a too loud laugh. Shrewd brown eyes cracks in shoe leather. 

                                  GORNA (CONT D)
                    Open that winder! Warm as spit in 
                    here.

      The miner she just yelled at quickly opens a slat in a 
      makeshift window. Gorna queen of her domain in here.

      A miner hands Bill a mason jar filled with a clear liquid. 
      Bill takes a sip. Winces.

                                  MINER
                    Home made moonshine, brother. From 
                    Spruce bark. Special Yukon recipe.                                                                                    32.


                                  BILL
                    Back home we gotta word for that.

                                  MINER
                    What s that?

                                  BILL
                          (grins)
                      Turpentine.

      The miner LAUGHS and LAUGHS. 

                                  MINER
                      Turpentine.

      Saying it in his native southern accent now. Making it sound 
      even funnier. Spits some of the moonshine into the fire and a 
      gust of flame rises. 

                                  MINER (CONT D)
                    Maybe so. Turpentine.

      Bill turns from him, his bright eyes taking in everything 
      about this brave new world. 

      Notes A GAUNT MAN staring at him with the saddest eyes we ve ever 
      seen. A RAW RED SCAR goes down his face. His name is GOODMAN.

      Goodman sees he s got Bill s attention. He pushes a kit of 
      mining tools toward Bill.

                                    GOODMAN
                    You might get some use of these. 
                    Belonged to my son. He don t need 
                    it no more.

      Goodman s eyes are filled with warmth... and liquor.

                                  BILL
                    Why s that? 

                                    GOODMAN
                          (quiet)
                    He didn t have a guardian angel like 
                    the boy you saved. He just had me.

      The mug of moonshine drops from Goodman s right hand. He 
      scrambles, embarrassed, to pick it up with his left.

      ANGLE ON RIGHT HAND

      Goodman s thumb is gone. From the scars, it looks like it had 
      been exploded off his hand.                                                                                    33.


                                  BILL
                            (quiet;compassionate)
                    What happened to your thumb, 
                    friend?

                                    GOODMAN
                    War.

      Doesn t want to talk about it. Goodman drinks, stares with 
      moist eyes at the tools he just gave Bill.

      During this interlude, people have been talking around him. 
      The conversation has grown heated. Something being talked 
      about with great interest.

      But it s like listening to people talking in a foreign 
      language, they ve been in each other s company so long. 

      We hear disparate phrases.  Justice for hire...  Gorna: 
       Ain t live up to heaven.  

                                  BILL
                    What re they talking about?

      Meekor has just sat heavily down beside Bill with his chow.

                                  MEEKOR
                    Law coming to town tomorrow.

                                  BILL
                          (stunned)
                    What law?

                                  MEEKOR
                    Mounties from Canada. 

                                  YOUNG MINER
                          (grins)
                    Gonna crack down on us sinners.

      Bill stares through a slit in the wall boards. 

      THROUGH THE SLIT

      we make out A FULL MOON hanging over Dawson... where justice 
      is perhaps on its way.

      ON BILL

      There s a new (hopeful) fire in Bill s eyes. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      A BIG PLUMP HORSE TURD

      dropping onto the muddy street. We are:                                                                                    34.


      EXT. DAWSON - DAY

      OUR VIEW rises from the steaming horse turd to its owner. Not 
      a horse actually, but a burro. Just larger than a dog really.

      ATOP THE BURRO

      sits INSPECTOR STEELE (50s), a tall man dressed in full 
      Mountie uniform, including the famous puffy fur hat. Handle-
      bar mustache. Hard metallic eyes. He rides, stately and 
      erect. 

      King of the fools.

      A SQUADRON OF MOUNTIES march behind him.

      A number of townspeople have gathered on the edges of the 
      street, watching this bizarre parade... and drinking. 

      A male bystander takes a grab at Sabine s ass. Sabine slaps 
      him away...

      ... moves of with great dignity. Making a big show of being 
      above this tomfoolery. Above all of this.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. THE MOUNTIES  HEADQUARTERS - DAY

      The Mounties are in the midst of building their 
        headquarters... and the barracks behind it. All are dressed 
      in their distinctive red British Army Jackets, and breeches. 

      ON STEELE

      moving through the area, occasionally giving a directive, 
      eyes serious. They re always serious. Flanked by two Mounties 
      carrying SHOTGUNS. 

      A MOUNTIE approaches Steele, says something discreetly to 
      him. Steele turns to see...

      BILL

      at the forefront of a crowd of residents here with their 
      petty problems. Two mounties are holding them back. Bill has 
      clearly been arguing with them.

      Steele makes a gesture and the mounties move aside to let 
      Bill in.

      INT. HEADQUARTERS - A BIT LATER

      Steele sits at his desk now, a Mountie on either side of him. 
      One of the mounties busily scribbles notes.                                                                                     35.


      Bill sits across the desk. Steele appears to be taking Bill 
      very seriously.

                                  STEELE
                    When did this murder take place?

      Hurls all his contempt into the word  murder.  He seems to be 
      angry on Bill s behalf.

                                  BILL
                      Yesterday. We had just staked our 
                    claim. Uphill from the river.

      Steele reacts as if he s just been hit in the face. Goes back 
      to being poker-faced. 

                                  STEELE
                    You say the shot came from the 
                    North east?

                                  BILL
                    It s where I saw the smoke.

      One of the seated Mounties confers with Steele quietly. 
      Steele nods.

                                  STEELE
                    Rifle shot?

      Bill nods. What the hell is going on?

                                  STEELE (CONT D)
                    Likely the Tlingits.

      Never has a man seemed more sure of himself.

                                  STEELE (CONT D)
                    Two specimens of that tribe were 
                    seen near where your friend was 
                    killed. They will be found. 

                                  BILL
                    Tlingits?

                                  STEELE
                    The Indian tribe that used to 
                    dominate this region. In their 
                    savage ignorance, they think this 
                    land is theirs. They have an 
                    invisible boundary, beyond which 
                    folks who venture have been 
                    harassed and threatened. I m 
                    referring to the hillside where you 
                    and your friend Mr. Epstein staked 
                    your claim.                                                                                    36.


                                  BILL
                          (stunned realization)
                    The second we staked our claim we 
                    were marked men?

      Steele stares at Bill with his hard metallic eyes. Yes, 
      that s what Steele thinks. 

      And thinking and knowing is the same for Steele.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      ANGLE ON BILL

      walking fast down the main street of Dawson--an extra charge 
      in his eyes now. Jack London sidles up to him. Keeps pace 
      with difficulty.

                                  JACK 
                    I might be able to help you in your 
                    newest endeavor. Hear you re 
                    heading for the Tlingit camp.

                                  BILL
                    Your information is correct.

                                  JACK
                    I m told they re just East of Wolf 
                    Paw trail.

      Jack s beginning to get out of breath keeping pace with Bill. 

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    It ll be my pleasure to guide you there.

      Bill whirls on him.

                                  BILL
                    Why? To fill more scribbles in your 
                    notebook. This is my battle.

                                  JACK
                    You ll need someone who can speak Tlingit.

      Bill stares at him. His eyes are harrowed. The moment of 
      truth is coming. He nods, charging forward...

      ... Jack hurrying to keep pace.

      ACT OUT                                                                                    37.


      ACT FOUR

      EXT. BELINDA S LUMBER MILL - DAY

      Father Judge has just bought lumber, and finished loading it 
      into his cart.

      He heads down the street, when suddenly the Count steps out 
      in front of him. SEVERAL EMPLOYEES of the Count s stand 
      beside him. Threat in their eyes.

                                  COUNT 
                    Looks like our conversation earlier 
                    did not make enough of an 
                      impression, your holiness. 

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    I am not holy. I am a servant of 
                    God.

      Father Judge tries to move on, but the Count puts a hand to 
      his chest. The time for subtext is over.

                                  COUNT
                    Let me make this very clear, your 
                    holiness. If you do not leave your 
                    dry goods store by tonight, you 
                    will not live to see the morning.

      Glances at A MOUNTIE passing on the street.

                                  COUNT (CONT D)
                    Possibly the presence of these 
                    ponces masquerading as the law 
                    embolden you. 

      The Count moves so close to father Judge we can practically 
      smell his whiskey breath. 

                                  COUNT (CONT D)
                    I have money and power. If the 
                    Canucks come after me, they will 
                    meet the same fate as you. And 
                    their blood will be on your hands. 
                    You will be the hand that kills 
                    them. I will just be, as you say, 
                    the servant.

      He turns and walks off with his men.

      CLOSE ON BELINDA

      watching this exchange from the lumber site. She has her own 
      compelling interest in this affair.                                                                                    38.


      ON FATHER JUDGE

      moving down the street, eyes searing, rimmed in red. LOUD 
      ANGRY BUZZING comes on the soundtrack as if coming from the 
      raging emotions inside Father Judge s head.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      WIDE VIEW - TWO TINY FIGURES 

      walk in the valley between snow-capped mountains... followed by 
      moving black clouds of mosquitos--the source of the buzzing. 

      CLOSER - MEN

      The BUZZING is insanely loud inside this insect war zone. 
      Bill and Jack have smeared their faces with clay against the 
      flying predators. 

                                  JACK 
                    Whatchu gonna do you deem the 
                    savages guilty?

                                  BILL
                          (searing)
                    The first thing is to know.

      Bill is lost in thought. A man with one direction right now.

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    Have you seen the tribe s leader?

                                  JACK
                    Know of him. A half breed. They say 
                    his white ma threw him in the woods 
                    when he was born. He survived two 
                    weeks in the snow and frost until 
                    his tribe found him. Legend is he 
                    thrived on rage. Rage instead of 
                    mama s milk. Grew strong on it and 
                    is now their leader. 

      ON A RIDGE ABOVE THEM

      we glimpse a shadow flit past... followed by another. They 
      are being tracked.

      BELOW

      Jack has stopped. Takes a long draught from his flask of sour 
      mash. Stares confusedly around him. 

                                  BILL
                    Are we lost, scribe?

      Jacks s answer is to take another long drink from his sour 
      mash.                                                                                     39.


                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    Might want to take it easy with the 
                    booze.

      Jack turns to Bill, eyes lit... everything about him lit.

                                  JACK LONDON
                    Dog knows.

      It s only now we notice Jack s mangy dog and constant 
        companion... sniffing his way forward. 

      Jack, (Bill following) moves in the direction of the dog.

                                  BILL
                          (mutters it)
                    We re following a dog.

      Jack lights up a cigarette with trembling fingers. Offers one 
      to Bill who refuses.

                                  JACK
                    Might want to take it up. Helps 
                    with the mosquitos.

      Bill smiles. Heard that one before. 

      THE DOG

      has stopped. Bill and Jack stop beside him. Their fearless 
      canine leader smells the air.

      BEFORE THEM

      lies a forested expanse framed by a cliff on the left, from 
      which pours a cascading waterfall. 

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    That forest before you, hero, is 
                    sacred Tlingit hunting ground. 
                    Abandon hope all ye who enter here.

      He grins a lopsided missing-tooth grin and stumbles forward.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Ye are no longer in the land of 
                    your father.

      Bill follows... but doesn t like this.

      WIDE VIEW OF EXPANSE OF ALASKA WILDERNESS - DAY

      The sky is entirely black, except for a single SLASH OF 
      LIGHT... like a signal from God. Thunder GROWLS.                                                                                     40.


      INT. TLINGIT FOREST - SAME TIME

      We re in a world of green. Puffy wet moss everywhere. It 
      covers the rocks, the trunks of the huge CREAKING trees.

      IN THE FOREGROUND

      A FIGURE whisks past. Soundlessly, like an animal. Unseen 
      by...

      BILL AND JACK 

      trekking through the dark, ominous forest. Jack continuing to 
      drink.

                                  JACK
                    Lie on the leaves, close your eyes, 
                    might feel the cold paws of wolves 
                    passing over you. And you re one of 
                     em here. A wild... human... 
                    animal. No difference. 

      Jack offers the flask to Bill. Pushes it on him.

      For the first time, we sense a glimmer of real fear in Bill s 
      eyes. He takes a long draught from the flask. And then 
      another. 

      The moment is interrupted by LOUD GROWLING.

      JACK S DOG

      stands frozen before them, staring into the thick trees. Tail 
      down, back arched. Ready to pounce.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                          (whispers it)
                    We re being tracked.

                                  BILL
                    By what?

                                  JACK
                    Could be wolves.
                          (beat)
                    Could be men.

                                  BILL
                          (almost to himself)
                    No difference.

      Bill pulls out his gun. Jack stops to stare at him.

                                  JACK
                    That ll only help with wolves.                                                                                    41.


      No drunkenness in Jack s eyes now. He s scared himself sober. 
      Bill puts away his gun.

      They move tentatively forward through the dark, sacred woods. 
      They freeze at the sound of a BREAKING TWIG.

      AN ELK

      stands less than ten feet from them. Not moving a muscle. 
      Just staring. More curious, than afraid.

      Bill and Jack continue forward... alert to every sound. 
      Knowing how vulnerable they are.

                                  BILL
                          (a whisper)
                    You ever seen an Indian?

                                  JACK
                    Yes, I have seen Indians and talked 
                    to them--

                                  BILL
                    What is their complexion?

                                  JACK
                    They are like all the colors of a 
                    mountain, run together and dripped 
                    in a jar.

      He suddenly stops walking. 

      AHEAD OF THEM

      A MAN is standing absolutely still. As still as the elk. God 
      knows how long he s been standing there. 

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                          (quiet)
                    They are the color of nature.

      Bill and Jack turn.

      EVERYWHERE THEY LOOK

      stand TLINGIT WARRIORS. They have come silently and taken up 
      positions, surrounding them. Still as the trees.

      Their eyes are not friendly.

      ACT OUT                                                                                    42.


      ACT FIVE

      EXT. TOWN OF DAWSON - NIGHT

      It s just beginning to rain again. Not much... but a storm is 
      coming. Something different about this storm. It s more 
      rageful.

      A ROARING WIND blows an awning off a closed-up store. The 
      awning is hurled down the street as if thrown by a giant.

      INT. FATHER JUDGE S DRY GOODS STORE/CHURCH - NIGHT

      A FLASH OF LIGHTNING bleaches the straight-backed figure of 
      Father Judge sitting on a freshly made bench. His first pew. 
      He looks devastated.

      BEFORE HIM 

      is his packed suitcase. He s made the decision... but can t 
      quite get himself to leave yet.

      Finally, he hoists the suitcase. Heads disconsolately toward 
      the door. He pauses at the door to cast one last look at his 
      would be church. His eyes fall on...

      A WHITE-WASHED WOODEN CROSS

      lying on a plank of white-smeared plywood on the floor. Just 
      painted.

      He can t leave a cross on the floor.

      FATHER JUDGE

      lifts the cross. HIS HANDS are smeared white from the fresh 
      paint. This gets to him. The cross leaving a mark on his 
      hands. A deep emotion passes over his features.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      FATHER JUDGE

      climbing a ladder to the peaked roof of the store, holding 
      the heavy cross. Eyes determined, hair blowing in the wind. 
      His coat is smeared white with the holy burden.

      FATHER JUDGE 

      balances himself astride the pitch of his roof. A skeletal 
      wooden structure has already been placed there.

      LIGHTNING flashes. Wind and rain whip his harrowed face as he 
      lifts a hammer and nails his cross to the roof.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    43.


      INT. TAVERN - SAME TIME

      A small crowd has gathered around TWO PEOPLE KISSING. The 
      young, pretty (might be under 18) SABINE and a GRIZZLED 
      MINER. Sabine pulls out of the kiss,.

                                  SABINE
                    That s your dollar s worth.

      Gold dollar in her hand, she moves with a slinky, confident 
      grace through the tavern. We hear other laughing miners,  I 
      got a dollar too.  etc. 

      SABINE

      turns to stare at them with sleepy eyes. Conscious of her 
      effect. 

                                  SABINE (CONT D)
                    I m tired of kissing.

      Continues forward with forced arrogance. A little leather 
      pouch is dropped at her feet.

                                  MALE VOICE
                    This should get me more than 
                    kissing.

      Sabine picks up the leather pouch. Looks inside. Gold dust. 

      She looks at the MAN who tossed it at her feet. He is neither 
      attractive or unattractive. Neither appealing or unappealing. 
      He is nothing.

                                  SABINE
                    Have you ever heard of buying a 
                    lady a drink?

                                  MAN
                    What would the lady like to drink?

      Sabine ignores the mocking tone. Sidles (with a touch of 
      regret) up to the man. 

                                  SABINE
                          (to bartender)
                    Red wine. Merlot.

      She turns to her new customer. Smiles an exaggeratedly 
      elegant smile.

                                  SABINE (CONT D)
                      Enchantee.

      Her eyes are sad.                                                                                    44.


      INT. BELINDA S PRIVATE CHAMBERS - SAME TIME

      Belinda stands at her boudoir window combing her hair... all 
      alone. We sense she spends a lot of time alone.

      VIEW OUT WINDOW

      By the stables near the Hotel, two people are all but going 
      at it. Sabine and the man who just approached her. Sabine 
      hardly moves. Her eyes are open. 

      BELINDA

      starts to turn away when she reacts to something new in the 
      landscape of Dawson.

      Something akin to (but not quite) panic crosses her features.

      HER POV - TOWN OF DAWSON

      The cross--a distance away... but shining brightly through 
      the night.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      THE COUNT

      He is playing poker with a few of HIS MEN. He is holding out 
      his forearm, while talking, making his muscle taut. 

      A MOSQUITO 

      is sucking the blood on his forearm, bloated red almost to 
      bursting.

                                  COUNT
                          (boasting)
                    You hold the muscle, he can t fly 
                    off. He tries but he s stuck--

      The Count suddenly goes quiet. Through the window, he sees 
      the cross. His eyes flash and (in his moment of distraction) 
      the blood-bloated mosquito flies off.

      WIDE SHOT - TOWN OF DAWSON - NIGHT

      In the darkness there is only one thing that stands out. It 
      can be seen from anywhere in town.

      THE WHITE CROSS

      on Father Judge s just sanctified... church.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    45.


      A DARK FIGURE

      comes toward us out of the storm moving into the entrance-way 
      of a tall lean-to-like structure. This is CHEYEHO, chief of 
      the Tlingit tribe. 

      He comes into clearer focus. Blue-grey hair, decorative scars 
      on his cheeks. DEEP BLUE EYES a jewel-like surprise in his 
      Indian features. Strong eyes. No promise of mercy or 
      vengeance there. A survivor s eyes.

      IN THE TENT BEFORE HIM

      sit Bill and Jack (not bound), guarded by the Tlingit hunters 
      who brought them here. Cheyeho sits across from them, making 
      himself an equal of sorts.

                                    CHEYEHO
                    I did not ask you here but I 
                    welcome you.

                                  BILL
                          (to Jack)
                    He speaks English.

                                  JACK
                    That s good because I don t speak 
                    Tlingit.

      Bill gives Jack a look. Cheyeho stares only at Bill. Bill is 
      the man who interests him.

                                    CHEYEHO
                    I know about your friend. I mourn 
                    him with you. 

      A charge comes into Bill s eyes. 

                                  BILL
                    What do you know about him?

                                    CHEYEHO
                    I know everything in these woods. I  
                    am like an owl. You and your friend 
                    have what you call  a claim.  In 
                    the hills. You buy land you don t 
                    own from a man who doesn t own it.  

                                  BILL
                    We have different principles of 
                    commerce. 

                                    CHEYEHO
                    Why don t you buy waves in the 
                    ocean? Pieces of sky. Somewhere, 
                    there is a white man who thinks he 
                    owns the moon.                                                                                    46.


      There are tears of anger in Bill s eyes.

                                  BILL
                    Did you kill him?

                                    CHEYEHO
                    We kill only for a purpose. 

                                  BILL
                    That s not an answer.

                                    CHEYEHO
                    Are you a God fearing man?

                                  BILL
                          (a challenge)
                    I am.

                                    CHEYEHO
                    And God is everywhere. He is in 
                      everything?

                                  BILL
                    Yes.

      Cheyeho smiles. It s a surprisingly easygoing smile. It 
      lightens his face. He turns to his fellow tribesmen. He 
      speaks in Tlingit, but subtitles translate.

                                    CHEYEHO
                    You see? The white man fears 
                      everything.

      He turns back to Bill. No longer smiling, the storm whipping 
      the trees behind him.

                                    CHEYEHO (CONT D)
                    Your fear is misplaced here. 

      Cheyeho s eyes are tinged with rage.

                                    CHEYEHO (CONT D)
                    You are in Tlingit territory and 
                    this is the land of no God. I m 
                    sorry for the loss of your friend, 
                    but we did not kill him.

                                  BILL
                    Who killed him?

      Bill s eyes burn. The question that haunts him. That might 
      haunt him to the grave.

      Cheyeho stares at Bill. Two men. That s all they are. Two 
      men. Something passes between them. Some sort of 
      understanding.                                                                                     47.


                                    CHEYEHO
                    The sky killed him.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      A CRACK OF THUNDER

      EXPLODES in the sky. The sky is murderous. 

      OUR VIEW drifts down from THE RAIN-SPATTERED CROSS to the 
      image of Bill and Jack arriving back in Dawson. 

      CLOSER - BILL AND JACK

      The two taking leave of each other.

                                  JACK
                    You think they killed your friend?

                                  BILL
                    They didn t act guilty.

                                  JACK 
                    Maybe they don t feel guilty.

        A conundrum. Bill feels it. The two men take leave of one 
      another. Jack heading to the tavern. 

      Bill alone with his stormy thoughts.

      ON BILL

      walking along the main street of Dawson. His mind churning. 
      He glances at the display window of a supply store. What he 
      sees makes him stop.

      ANGLE ON WINDOW 

      Bill s reflection is a spectral presence. He looks ragged, 
      harrowed, pale. He almost doesn t recognize himself.

      ON BILL

      He sees something else in the window. Something that sends a 
      chill down his spine.

      THE WINDOW 

      We RACK FOCUS from Bill s reflected image to reveal the goods 
      on display. Prominent amongst the other items are...

      ... EPSTEIN S BOOTS. 

      Etched in the leather, we make out the cowboy whirling a 
      lasso.                                                                                     48.


      CLOSE ON BILL

      The emotional vagaries of his own adventures are brought home 
      to him by the strange journey of his friend s boots.

      Bill turns emotionally from the sight... and he sees 
      something else...

      THE WHITE CROSS

      standing like a beacon on the roof of Father Judge s church.

      Bill approaches the store, eyes blazing. His gaze falls on a 
      heavy piece of rotted lumber in the street.

      He picks it up... heaves it against the store window, 
      shattering the glass.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EPSTEIN S BODY

      lies on a the makeshift knave of the church, lit in trembling 
      lightning. He s been arranged carefully on a table. Hands 
      folded. 

      Boots back on his feet. Where they belong. We are:  

      INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

      Father Judge and Bill stand over the body, sharing a Kaddish 
      prayer book. Father Judge has not slept in a long time, but 
      is voice is firm. 

      He is doing what he came here for.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    May his great name go exalted and 
                      sanctified. 

                                  BILL 
                          (quiet)
                    Amen. 

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    In the world that He created as He 
                    willed. May He give reign to His 
                    kingship in your lifetime and in 
                    your days and in the lifetimes of 
                    the Family of Israel... swiftly and 
                    soon. 

      Bill s cue.                                                                                     49.


                                  BILL
                          (tears in his eyes)
                    May His great Name be blessed 
                    forever and ever.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    May His great Name be blessed 
                    forever and ever.

      Father s Judge s VOICE breaks. This next passage has great, 
      great meaning to him.

                                  FATHER JUDGE (CONT D)
                    ... Blessed, praised, glorified, 
                    exalted, extolled, mighty, 
                    upraised, and lauded be the Name of 
                    the Holy One, Blessed is He.

      A FLASH OF LIGHTNING

      bleaches Epstein s face in white light... 

      ... It also lights up the window near the body where...

      A DARK-BEARDED MAN 

      is staring in at them. Sees Bill and father Judge staring at 
      him and backs off, grinning.

      Bill turns with suddenly alert eyes to father Judge.

                                  FATHER JUDGE (CONT D)
                          (a growl)
                    This is not your fight. They are 
                    here for me.

                                    COUNT S VOICE
                          (shouting)
                    The Pearly gates beckon you, your 
                    holiness! 

      Father Judge s eyes are wild. Instinctively, he turns toward 
      the AXE sitting on a small table. 

      Bill sees the moment. Father Judge sees Bill see. 

      A defining moment. It s like we re between the ticks of a 
      clock.

      THROUGH THE WINDOW

      we see The Count, with A DOZEN OF HIS MEN. Several hold 
      flaming torches.

                                  COUNT
                    You have three seconds to show 
                    yourself, your holiness!                                                                                    50.


      Bill pulls out his pistol. Father Judge grabs his wrist with 
      surprising force. He stares searingly into Bill s eyes.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    Leave this place. If you re a man, 
                    leave this God forsaken place... 
                    before it unmans you.

      Bill pulls his arm away. Moves with his pistol toward the 
      door.

      EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

      Bill exits. Before him stand The Count and his murderous 
      gang.

                                  THE COUNT
                    Who the hell are you?

                                  BILL
                    This is a place of worship.

                                  THE COUNT
                    Hell it is. It s a goddam Dry Goods 
                    store.

      Father Judge exits the church too. Father Judge and Bill 
      stand together facing the gang of thugs.

      The Count lifts his rifle, aiming it right at Bill. 

                                  COUNT
                    I urge you to drop your fire-arm.

      Gives just the faintest gesture. The man standing beside him 
      lifts his rifle to aim at Bill as well. Suddenly... 

      ... we hear the COCK of another rifle... and another... and 
      another...

      ALL AROUND THEM

      MEN come out of the shadows, all with guns.

      The Count continues to aim at Bill, but his eyes are wild. 
      What the fuck is going on?

      FROM THE DARKNESS

      comes Belinda, dressed in a long leather rain cloak. The most 
      gorgeous female bad-ass the world has ever seen.

                                    BELINDA
                    Not tonight, Count.                                                                                    51.


      THE COUNT S MEN

      are still pointing their rifles at Bill and Father Judge. But 
      Bill has eyes only for Belinda.

                                  BILL
                    Strange to see a woman flourish in 
                    such an environment.

                                    BELINDA
                    Every day I m alive is a stroke of 
                    luck.

      She pulls out her own rifle, aims it at The Count. 

      Fuck this. The Count COCKS his rifle... pointing it right at 
      Bill.

                                  COUNT
                    No matter how this goes down... you 
                    die.

                                  BILL
                    I d say the same goes for you.

      The Count s eyes are black with anger. He s got this intruder 
      (Bill) in his sights. He likes him in his sights.

                                  COUNT
                    Depends on the lady s aim. I have 
                    several paces on her.

      It s true. Belinda is quite a bit farther away from The Count 
      than The Count is from Bill. 

                                    BELINDA
                    Just to show you what a good sport 
                    I am...

      She lowers her rifle just a little.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    ... I will aim at the smallest 
                    target on your person.

      She s aiming at his crotch.

      THE COUNT

      still stares at Bill. Eyes black fires. He wants so much to 
      kill him.

      Finally, he turns to Belinda.                                                                                    52.


                                  COUNT
                          (eyes black coals)
                    It will be a long winter. You and I 
                    will meet again. 

                                    BELINDA
                    I look forward to it. 

      The Count lowers his weapon. 

                                  COUNT
                          (to his men)
                    Lower your weapons. We won t kill a 
                    female.

      The Count s men lower their weapons. 

      THE COUNT AND HIS MEN LEAVING IN THE BACKGROUND

      Father Judge has a moment with Belinda.

                                  FATHER JUDGE
                    I owe you thanks. You are a woman 
                    of virtue.

                                    BELINDA
                    Virtue s got nothing to do with it.

      She heads off with her people. 

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    This is about real estate. Your 
                    church is temporary, father.

      Turns to give him a last smiling look.

                                    BELINDA (CONT D)
                    Don t do too much praying in it. It 
                    ain t gonna be for praying.

      Father Judge stares after her. A half smile in his eyes. Like 
      he knows who she is better than she does.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

      The yellow eyes of a gigantic beast comes toward us through 
      the darkly swaying trees.

      The image resolves into TWO MOUNTIES holding lanterns. TWO 
      MINERS walk alongside them. One is the miner we saw earlier 
      wearing Epstein s boots. The miners freeze.

                                  MINER #1
                          (quick whisper)
                    There they are.                                                                                    53.


      BEFORE THEM

      is a campground. A butchered deer hangs from a tree. A spent 
      fire next to a leather tent.

                                    MOUNTIE #1
                    How do you know it s them?

                                  MINER #1
                    They were in the hills across the 
                    river the night that man was shot.

                                    MOUNTIE #1
                    You saw them?

                                  MINER #1
                    He did.

      Referring to his friend. The friend nods. The Mounties don t 
      seem sure what to do. They are very young.

      INSIDE THE TENT

      sleep TWO TLINGIT hunters. We hear THE COCK of a rifle. And 
      both Tlingits are immediately awake. 

      THE TWO MOUNTIES

      stand before them, rifles aimed right at their heads. They 
      look scared. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. TINGLIT CAMP - NIGHT

      The same camp where Bill and Jack were brought by the 
      Tlingit. A TLINGIT WARRIOR rides in... SHOUTING in Tlingit.

      CHEYEHO

      emerges from his shelter. He moves toward us, taking in what his 
      fellow tribesman is telling him, growing angrier and angrier. 

      CLOSE-UP - CHEYEHO

      He nods, understanding what s happened. There s a storm in 
      his eyes. 

      OUR VIEW rises to the sky. Here the storm is clearing. 

      BLACK CLOUDS

      part (like curtains) to reveal the full moon in all its 
      luminous glory... lighting up...                                                                                    54.


      THE MINERS  CAMP

      lying under the same sky. Under the same moon.

      AN EXHAUSTED BILL

      arrives to find Meekor outside his tent, gazing down the slope. 
      A sweaty Soapy is here too. Moves obsequiously toward Bill.

                                  SOAPY
                    I came here to yap with you.

      But Bill has turned to follow Meeker s gaze down the slope.

      OTHER MINERS 

      are awake too. Everyone staring down the slope. 

      BILL S POV - DOWN THE SLOPE

      THE TWO TLINGIT HUNTERS are being led in chains by Steele and 
      a posse of his men. Clearly a statement to the miners. 

      They ve caught Epstein s killers. The law is here.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    Your sitch-ation s changed. Justice 
                    has been rightfully served. God 
                    bless us all.

      Bill stares and stares. Something about this is just too simple.

      CLOSE ON TLINGIT CAPTIVES

      One of them turns, sensing eyes on him. He seems to be 
      staring right back at Bill. It can t be true, but it s like a 
      personal moment is taking place between Bill and this 
      captured Tlingit.

      The Tlingit s eyes are filled with the rage of injustice. 

      THE OTHER MINERS

      are eying Bill to see what he ll do. Gorna amongst them.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    A man changes when his sitch-ations 
                    changes. I expect, as discussed 
                    earlier, you will return to the 
                    green pastures of Maine and the 
                    embrace of your loved ones.

                                  BILL
                    Vermont.                                                                                    55.


                                  SOAPY
                    An equally bucolic locale.

      Soapy drags a pail toward Bill.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    It is my honor to act as 
                      facilitator to your return to the 
                    bosoms of your loved ones. 

      Soapy s eyes have a special light now. The love of the deal.

      THE PAIL

      is filled with nuggets of gold. It s beautiful. A glowing 
      treasure yanked from the earth at terrible cost.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    Pure gold. In exchange for your claim.

      There s a fire in Soapy s eyes.

                                  SOAPY (CONT D)
                    Four hunnerd dollars worth. More 
                    than most of these here miners will 
                    make in two years.

      Bill picks up the pail. It s heavy. 

      The young miner who talked worshipfully to Bill earlier, 
      stares from the background... hoping his hero does not have 
      feet of clay. 

      Bill turns to look at the Tlingit being led away into the 
      distance. Just dots on the landscape now. 

      A clear reminder that justice has not been done.

      A deep emotion passes over Bill s his features. He stares at 
      Soapy with burning eyes. 

                                  BILL
                    It s not enough. 

      ANGLE ON GORNA

      staring... a hint of a smile in her shrewd blue eyes as...

      Bill puts down the pail. Moves to his claim and...

      ... DIGS.

      Doing what all of them have done. Picking up the mantle of 
      adventure and challenge at the root of manhood... of 
      humanhood.                                                                                    56.


      We begin to hear the distant BOOM of Tlingit war drums. The 
      Tlingit reaction to what we ve just seen.

      CLOSE-UP - BILL

      plunging in his spade over and over... bending out of frame 
      and then rising back in.

      Every time he bends out of frame, we see the full moon (the 
      moon that played such a role in his and Epstein s dreams). We 
      hold on the moon...

      ... the BOOM of Tlingit war drums and CHANTING in the 
      background. And in Bill s eyes, we see an echo of that cry.

      The rebel cry from the dawn of man.

      FADE OUT
