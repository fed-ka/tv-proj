November 7 2012                                  PART ONE: NOAH.


      EXT. ROOFTOP - PARK SLOPE, BROOKLYN - DAY.

      Early morning. The unfinished roof is deserted. NOAH, 42, 
      sits on a crate, smoking a cigarette and watching the sun 
      rise slowly over the brownstones of Brooklyn.

      He s wearing his pajama pants and a white tee-shirt. He s a 
      handsome guy, well-built, solid. Maybe a little scruffy. 
      Probably has a beard. And his hair is falling into his eyes. 
      It s not some kind of hipster declaration, he just hasn t had 
      time to get it cut.

      From up on his perch, the city looks peaceful. Charming. Far 
      away.

      Noah takes another drag and extinguishes the cigarette. He 
      picks up a hand-sized rock by the chimney vent, turns it over 
      and reveals a compartment designed for hiding house keys, 
      where he stashes the pack.


      INT. BATHROOM- DAY.

      Noah washes his mouth out with toothpaste and scrubs his 
      hands vigorously in the sink. He breathes into them and 
      sniffs.

      An old-fashioned ALARM CLOCK goes berserk in the adjacent 
      bedroom. Noah s wife, HALLA, 40, reaches one hand out from 
      under a pile of covers and attempts to blindly silence it. 
      Her hand flails, landing to the left and right of the clock, 
      missing it every time.

      Noah laughs.


      INT. BEDROOM - DAY.

      Sitting on the edge of the bed, Noah turns off the alarm 
      clock and pulls back the covers. Halla opens one eye and 
      looks up at him, groggy.

                                  HALLA
                    Hi friend.

                                  NOAH
                    Hi friend.

      Noah leans over and kisses her forehead. Her cheek. Her neck.                                                                                      2.


                                  HALLA
                    You smell good.

      She reaches up for him and he climbs on top of her. More 
      sleepy kissing. As his hands move down her body -

      The BABY MONITOR on the other side of their bed crackles 
      alive and then admits a CRY.

      Noah groans and rolls off of Halla.

                                  NOAH
                    I ll get it.

                                  HALLA
                    No, I ll get it. You load the car.

      Halla slips out of bed, wearing his tee-shirt. He watches her 
      go.

                                  NOAH
                    Nice bum.

      Halla slaps her ass in response. Noah grins. 


      EXT. STREET - DAY. 

      NOAH is packing a minivan on the curb outside his brownstone. 
      It s one of those inconceivable acts of geometry that only 
      men of a certain age with at least two children seem to have 
      mastered. He approaches the task like a chess master. 
      Absolute concentration. 

      His son, MARTIN, 13, comes out of the apartment and sits down 
      on the stoop, watching him. 

                                  NOAH
                    Hey. 

                                  MARTIN
                    Hey.

                                  NOAH
                    Are you packed?

                                  MARTIN
                    Yup.

                                  NOAH
                    Are you excited?

      Martin doesn t answer. He picks angrily at some debris on the 
      steps.                                                                                      3.


                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    You re hiding it well, but I can 
                    tell that you are.

                                  MARTIN
                    I wanted to stay here for the 
                    summer.

                                  NOAH
                    I know.

                                  MARTIN
                    I wanted to go to league camp.

                                  NOAH
                    Well, next summer, if you bring 
                    that grade point average up, you 
                    can stay and go to league camp. -

                                  MARTIN
                    That s ridiculous!

                                  NOAH
                    Why is that ridiculous?

                                  MARTIN
                    You said I could go to league camp -

                                  NOAH
                    If you got your grades up. You seem 
                    to have forgotten the second clause 
                    of the contact. 

                                  MARTIN
                    It sucks at Grandpa s.

                                  NOAH
                    That s not true. 

                                  MARTIN
                    It is true.

                                  NOAH
                    Martin, your grandfather has a 
                    swimming pool, two tennis courts, 
                    and a sauna on his property. It 
                      objectively does not suck there.

      Martin glares at his father.

                                  MARTIN
                    You suck.

      Noah shrugs.                                                                                      4.


                                  NOAH
                    That is, at least, a more 
                      defendable hypothesis.


      Martin spots his basketball tucked into middle of the 
      suitcase rubric.

                                  MARTIN
                    Oh shit, I ve been looking for 
                    that.

      He jumps up, darts over to the trunk and reaches for the ball 
    -

                                  NOAH
                    No wait!

      But it s too late. Martin pulls the ball out, thus 
      destabilizing the structure. The suitcases fall, popping open 
      on the street.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Martin! What the hell?!

      Martin just stares at him, blank. 

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    What were you thinking?

      Martin runs off into the house.


      INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY.

      Noah sits in front of a massive floor-to-ceiling bookshelf, 
      pulling select volumes and adding them to the pile. 

      His younger son, TREVOR, 8, walks through the room on his way 
      to the kitchen.

                                  NOAH
                    Trevor. Come here for a second. 

      Trevor looks at Noah in trepidation. He s been in similar 
      situations. He knows they don t end well for him.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    What are you going to read this 
                    summer?

      Trevor shrugs.                                                                                      5.


                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Come on, you ve got three glorious, 
                      uninhibited months ahead of you and 
                    a whole bookshelf in front of you. 
                    Pretty soon, you ll be nine and 
                    then ten, you ll get a job, you ll 
                    meet a girl, you ll have kids and 
                    you ll never have the chance to 
                    read for pleasure again. You have 
                    to make the most of the time you ve 
                    got, little man. While the world is 
                    still your oyster.

      Trevor reaches up and pulls down a book.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                          (taking the book)
                    No. Not that one. 

                                  TREVOR
                    Why not?

                                  NOAH
                    You re too young.

                                  TREVOR
                    Is it dirty?

                                  NOAH
                    No. Who told you that?

                                  TREVOR
                    My friend at school. She said her 
                    mom read your book and she said it 
                    had too much s-e-x.

                                  NOAH
                    First of all, there s no such 
                    thing. And second of all, you go 
                    back to school and tell your little 
                    friend to tell her mother that you 
                    and all your siblings were the 
                    products of immaculate conception. 
                    So if she thinks my book is 
                      pornographic, it s her dirty mind 
                    at work, not mine. Tell her that.

      Trevor sighs. 

                                  TREVOR
                    Do I have to?                                                                                      6.


      EXT. STREET - DAY.

      Noah is back on the curb, repacking the trunk. A VOICE begins 
      speaking, over the scene. Noah doesn t react to it. He 
      doesn t hear it.

                                  VOICE
                    Mr. Kalish. Hi. Thanks for coming 
                    in.

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    It s not like I had much of a 
                    choice.

                                  VOICE
                    Well, we ll try not to take up too 
                    much of your time.

      Trevor exits the brownstone and bounds down the steps, 
      followed by his older sister, WHITNEY 16, who wears red 
      lipstick, dark sunglasses and a tiny jumpsuit.

                                  VOICE (CONT D)
                    I d like to begin by asking you a 
                    few questions about how this whole 
                    mess got started. 

      The kids climb into the minivan.  

                                  NOAH
                          (to Whitney)
                    Good morning, daughter.

                                    WHITNEY
                    Good morning, father.

                                  NOAH
                    Do you need your sunglasses in the 
                    car?

                                    WHITNEY
                    I m breaking them in.

                                  NOAH
                    Are we going to see your eyes at 
                    all this summer?

                                    WHITNEY
                    I doubt it.

                                  VOICE
                    Is that alright with you? Mr. 
                    Kalish?                                                                                      7.


      Halla comes out of the brownstone carrying their youngest 
      daughter STACEY (2) in her arms.

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    It s a free country, Pal. Ask away.

      Halla opens the back seat and installs Stacey in her car 
      seat.

                                  HALLA
                          (looking around the car)
                    Where s Martin?

                                  NOAH
                    Still in the house, isn t he?

                                  HALLA
                          (frowning)
                    I don t think so.


      INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY.

      Noah wanders through the house, looking for his son.

                                  NOAH
                    Martin? Martin?

                                  VOICE
                    So can you tell us a bit about who 
                    you were in the summer of 2013?

      Noah checks the kitchen .... it s empty.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY.

      He checks the living room. Empty.

                                  VOICE
                    Mr. Kalish?

                                  NOAH S VOICE 
                    I don t understand the question.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY.

      Empty.                                                                                      8.


                                  NOAH
                    Martin? Come on dude, this isn t 
                    funny. Everyone is waiting on you.

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    What, exactly, do you want to know?

                                  VOICE
                    Anything you think is relevant.


                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. HALL CLOSET - DAY.

      Nothing but sheets and towels. 

                                  VOICE
                    How were you feeling about your 
                    life?

      Noah closes the closet and heads down the hall towards a door 
      with a KEEP OUT sign on it.

                                  NOAH S VOICE 
                    Fine.

                                  VOICE
                    Can you say a little more?

      Noah s hand is on the doorknob-

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    Great. I was feeling great. My kids 
                    were healthy. My wife was 
                      beautiful.


                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. MARTIN S ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

      A terrible mess. Basketball posters on the wall. Clothes 
      strewn across the floor. Cereal boxes. Piles of sneakers.

      Noah crosses the room -

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    My life was pretty fucking perfect.

      And opens the door to an adjacent bathroom -                                                                                      9.


      INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS.

      Martin is dangling from the light fixture on the ceiling, 
      HANGING by a cord.

      Noah s heart stops.

                                  NOAH
                          (small)
                    No.

      Noah reaches up and rips the cord off the light. Martin falls 
      to the ground. He lays there in a crumpled huddle.

      Then he starts to giggle.

      It takes Noah a moment to realize what s just happened. He 
      SEES that the cord continues beneath Martin s collar. He 
      yanks up Martin s shirt to reveal a rock-climbing harness, 
      which was actually supporting the boy s weight.

      Noah grabs Martin by the arm and pulls him to his feet with 
      so much force he almost dislocates Martin s shoulder.

                                   MARTIN
                    Ow! Dad! What the fuck?


      INT. MARTIN S ROOM  - DAY.

      Noah THROWS Martin into a chair.

                                  NOAH
                    What is wrong with you?

                                  MARTIN
                    It was a joke!

                                  NOAH
                    You thought that was funny? You 
                    think killing yourself is -

                                  MARTIN
                    I looked it up on the internet! It 
                    wasn t easy! They pay people a lot 
                    of money to fake a hanging. In, 
                    like, movies and shit. It s a real 
                    skill.

      Noah stares at Martin.

                                  MARTIN (CONT D)
                    I thought you d be proud of me.                                                                                    10.


                                  NOAH
                    Are you insane? Everyone is in the 
                    car waiting for you. Is it so much 
                    to ask that for one day - one day 
                    out of your entire life - that you 
                    think of somebody other than 
                    yourself?

      Martin s eyes start to swell. 

                                  MARTIN
                          (mumbling)
                    It was supposed to be a joke.

      Noah doesn t know what to do. He would like to punch 
      something. His kid, perhaps, or at least, a wall. Instead, he 
      takes a deep breath and sits down heavily on the edge of the 
      bed.

                                  NOAH
                    Dude, what is going on with you? 
                    Last summer you were this happy 
                    little kid. What happened?

      Martin doesn t respond. He can t. He s concentrating too hard 
      on not crying. Noah picks up a cereal box, looks inside and 
      RECOILS.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    You have to clean up this room. 
                    You re going to get maggots.

                                  MARTIN
                          (sniffling)
                    Now?

                                  NOAH
                    No, forget it. We ll have it 
                    fumigated at the end of the summer.

      Noah stands.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Let s go. Before your mother comes 
                    in.

      Martin doesn t move.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Come on, man.

                                  MARTIN
                    I hate Grandpa.                                                                                     11.


                                  NOAH
                    I know. So do I. But look at it 
                    this way. At least you stand to 
                    inherit some of his money when he 
                    dies.

                                  MARTIN
                    I won t take a penny of it.

                                  NOAH
                    You ll change your mind.


      EXT. STREET - DAY.

      Noah opens the sliding side door and Martin climbs into the 
      mini-van.


      INT. MINIVAN -DAY.

      Noah gets into the passenger s seat. Halla is driving.

                                  HALLA
                      Everything okay?

                                  NOAH
                    Fine.

                                  HALLA
                    What happened?

                                  NOAH
                    He had a stomach ache.

      Halla turns around, worried.

                                  HALLA
                    You feel okay, Marty?

      In the backseat, Martin nods, subdued. Noah counts the his 
      children.

                                  NOAH
                    One, two, three, four. 
                          (to Halla)
                    That s all the kids I ve got, 
                    right?

                                  HALLA
                    From me at least.

      Noah smiles. Halla turns on the car.                                                                                    12.


      INT. MINIVAN -DAY.

      A few hours later. Stuck in bumper-to-bumper beach traffic on 
      the one stretch of highway that takes vacationers from the 
      city out to the beaches of Long Island.

      In the backseat, Whitney is on her phone. Martin is staring 
      out the window. Stacey is sleeping. And Trevor is, for some 
      unknown reason, SINGING  Kumbaya  on an endless loop.

      In the front seat, Noah squints at the road. He closes his 
      eyes tightly and then opens them again.

                                  NOAH
                    That s weird. My vision just got 
                    blurry for a second. 

                                  HALLA
                    You okay?

                                  NOAH
                    Yeah, it cleared.

                                  HALLA
                    I spoke to my Dad. Guess what? He s 
                    read your book.

      Noah s jaw tightens automatically.

                                  NOAH
                    And?

                                  HALLA
                    He really liked it. He said he s 
                    excited to talk to you about it.

      Noah rolls his eyes.

                                  HALLA (CONT D)
                    What? 

                                  NOAH
                    Nothing. That s great. I m excited 
                    to talk to him too.

                                  HALLA 
                    I don t understand why you have 
                    such a chip on your shoulder about 
                    him. You act like he s out to get 
                    you or something.

      Noah doesn t answer.                                                                                    13.


                                  HALLA (CONT D)
                    He s actually quite generous to 
                    younger writers. He s famous for 
                    his mentorship-

      Noah closes his eyes again and takes a sharp breath in.

                                  HALLA (CONT D)
                          (worried)
                    What s going on?

                                  NOAH
                    Nothing. I have a headache.

                                  HALLA
                    Do we need to stop?

                                  NOAH
                    No.

      In the backseat, Trevor, who has fallen silent, starts to 
      sing  Kumbaya  again.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Trevor?

                                  TREVOR
                    Yeah?

                                  NOAH
                    I ll pay you ten dollars to shut 
                    up.

                                  TREVOR
                            (cheerfully)
                    Okay.

      The car inches forward.


      EXT. MONTAUK - ELMO S PANCAKE PALACE - DAY. 

      Four hours later, the minivan finally pulls into a restaurant 
      parking lot. All the kids pile out.


      INT. BOOTH - DAY.

      The family sit around a booth, looking at their menus. 
      Whitney is still wearing her sunglasses.

                                  HALLA
                    Whit, can you take those things off 
                    inside?                                                                                    14.


                                    WHITNEY
                    I m sure I can.

      Noah reaches across the table and takes the sunglasses off 
      his daughter s face.

                                    WHITNEY (CONT D)
                    Hey!

      She looks up at him, angrily, through BLOODSHOT eyes.

                                  NOAH
                    Where were you last night?

                                    WHITNEY
                    I was at Courtney s.

                                  HALLA
                    What were you doing at Courtney s?

      A WAITRESS, early 30s, comes over to take their order. She s 
      very pretty, with dark hair and wide-set eyes. Her name tag 
      reads  Alison .

                                  ALISON
                    What can I get you all?

                                    WHITNEY
                    We were studying.

                                  MARTIN
                    I ll have the burger.

                                  NOAH
                    Really.

                                  ALISON
                          (to Martin)
                    Fries?

                                  MARTIN
                    Yeah.

                                    WHITNEY
                    Really.

                                  NOAH
                    Studying for what?

                                  ALISON
                          (to Martin)
                    Cheese?                                                                                    15.


                                  MARTIN
                    Yeah.

                                    WHITNEY
                    The SATs.

                                  NOAH
                    That test is in November.

                                  ALISON
                          (to Noah)
                    Something to drink?

                                  MARTIN
                    Sure. Surprise me. Something stiff.

      She looks up at him. He smirks. She smiles and writes his 
      order down.

                                  HALLA
                    Your father and I are not morons, 
                    Whitney. We know what it looks like 
                    when someone has been smoking pot.

                                    WHITNEY
                    Oh my God. First of all, no you 
                    don t because I ve been high, like, 
                    fifty times in the last year and 
                    you have never noticed -

                                  HALLA
                    Excuse me?

                                    WHITNEY
                    And second of all-
                          (to Alison)
                    Is there anything on this menu that 
                    is under 1000 calories? 

                                  ALISON
                    Probably not.

                                    WHITNEY
                    That s what I thought. I ll just 
                    have a diet Coke.

      Halla grabs a menu-

                                  HALLA
                          (to Alison)
                    Oh for God s sake, Miss, don t you 
                    have a salad or -                                                                                    16.


                                    WHITNEY
                    Forget it. I m not hungry.

                                  HALLA
                    You have to eat.

                                  TREVOR
                    Can I have the blueberry pancakes 
                    please?

                                  ALISON
                          (writing on her pad)
                    Excellent choice.

                                  NOAH
                          (to Halla)
                    Look at it this way ... if she s 
                    not hungry, she s not high.

                                  ALISON
                          (to Whitney)
                    I could get the cooks to make you 
                    an egg white omelette. That s what 
                    I usually have them make me.

      Whitney looks at her suspiciously.

                                    WHITNEY
                    But they cook in like, a ton of 
                    butter, right?

                                  ALISON
                    No, I ll make sure they use a 
                    nonstick frying pan. With a little 
                    cheese maybe-

                                    WHITNEY
                    No cheese.

                                  ALISON
                    No cheese. But how about some 
                    avocado? Because it s the good fat. 
                    The kind that helps you burn more 
                    fat.

                                    WHITNEY
                    Fine.

      She passes her menu over. Alison looks at Noah and WINKS.

      The noise of the scene starts to recede. There s a slight 
      RINGING in Noah s ears.                                                                                     17.


                                  VOICE
                    Do you remember the first time you 
                    saw her?

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    Like it was yesterday.

      Noah s POV: Alison is standing in a lotus position, with her 
      right foot braced against her inner left thigh. Noah can SEE 
      a glimpse of yellow underwear. 

                                  NOAH S VOICE (CONT D)
                    There was something so easy about 
                    her. So effortless.

      Alison turns to Noah and says something that he can t quite 
      hear. He frowns. 

                                  NOAH
                    Sorry, what?

                                  ALISON
                          (far away)
                    What would you like to order?

      He stares at her for a moment too long. Her gaze becomes 
      concerned.

                                  HALLA
                    Noah? Are you alright?

                                  NOAH
                    I m fine. I m fine. I just need to 
                    use the... where is the ...

                                  ALISON
                    Past the bar, take a left -

      Noah gets up and heads quickly across the restaurant, to a 
      door marked  RESTROOMS . He pushes through the door and then -


      BLACKOUT.


      INT. HALLWAY - DAY.

      A little hallway in front of the bathrooms. Noah is lying on 
      the floor, in a daze. His head is bleeding.

      Noah s POV: A figure kneels in front of him, blurred. He 
      blinks. It s clearly a woman. He blinks again and Alison 
      comes into focus.                                                                                     18.


                                  ALISON
                    Can you hear me? Are you alright?

                                  NOAH
                    I think so.

      He tries to sit up. He s overcome with dizziness -

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Oh God.

                                  ALISON
                    Should I call an ambulance?

                                  NOAH
                    No!

                                  ALISON
                    Are you sure?

                                  NOAH
                    How long was I out?

                                  ALISON
                    I m don t know. A few minutes?

                                  NOAH
                    Okay. I ll be fine. I m just going 
                    to rest here for a moment.


      The door to the restaurant swings open and a WOMAN enters. 
      She eyes Noah and Alison strangely, then disappears into the 
      women s bathroom.

      Alison turns back to Noah.

                                  ALISON
                    Let s at least give you some 
                    privacy. 

      She gets behind him, hooks her arms under his shoulders -

                                  NOAH
                    Wait, no. What are you -

      She pulls him into the men s room. The door closes behind 
      them.                                                                                    19.


      INT. MEN S BATHROOM - DAY.

      Alison props Noah up against the wall and crouches down to 
      examine the cut on his forehead. She moves his hair to touch 
      it. He GASPS in pain.

                                  ALISON
                    That needs stitches.

      Noah reaches up to feel for himself.

                                  NOAH
                    I m bleeding?

                                  ALISON
                    You must have hit your head on 
                      something.

                                  NOAH
                    Shit. Is there a first aid kit 
                    around here, or -

                                  ALISON
                    Why don t you just let me call you 
                    an ambulance?

                                  NOAH
                          (slightly panicked)
                    That really isn t necessary. If you 
                    would just pass me a few paper 
                    towels - 

                                  ALISON
                    Okay. Okay. You re in charge.

      Alison stands, wets a pile of towels and kneels in front of 
      him again to clean the wound. He WINCES.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    So is this like, a typical day for 
                    your family?

                                  NOAH
                    I m not usually the one bleeding, 
                    but yeah. 

      She smiles.

                                  ALISON
                    I m Alison, by the way.

      Noah looks up at her. She really is very beautiful. He has a 
      sudden urge to reach out to her. To pull her towards him -                                                                                    20.


                                  NOAH
                    I m Noah.

      A KNOCK on the door -

                                  MARTIN S VOICE
                    Dad! Are you in there?

                                  NOAH
                          (calling)
                    Yeah man. I m here. 

                                  MARTIN S VOICE
                    Is something wrong? 

                                  NOAH
                    No, just got the runs. You may not 
                    want to stand too close to the 
                    door.  

                                  MARTIN S VOICE 
                    That s disgusting, Dad. 

                                  NOAH
                    Tell your mother I ll be right 
                    back.

      They listen to the sound of Martin s footsteps walking away. 
      Alison turns back to Noah. Her face is inches from his own. 
      She is staring at him, curious. Waiting for an explanation. 

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    I just don t want to worry them. 

      Beat. Then Alison nods and finally stands. 

                                  ALISON
                    Wait here. I ll find a band-aid.


      INT. ELMO S PANCAKE PALACE - DAY.

      Noah slides back into the booth with the rest of his family. 
      Halla immediately spots the bandage under his hair.

                                  HALLA
                    Oh my God, what happened to you?

                                  NOAH
                      I slipped. Hit my head on the sink.

                                  HALLA
                    Just now? In the bathroom?                                                                                    21.


                                  NOAH
                    Yeah, the waitress brought me a few 
                    bandages -

      Halla watches Alison leave the restroom area and cross the 
      restaurant. 

                                  HALLA
                    She was in the bathroom with you?

                                  NOAH
                    No, of course not. She showed me 
                    where the first aid kit was and -

      A chicken finger hits his head. Courtesy of Stacey.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Is this for me? Why thank you very 
                    much. Is it a cookie? Can I dip it 
                    in your milk?

      Noah attempts to dip the chicken finger in Stacey s glass of 
      milk. She SQUEALS with delight.


      EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY.

      The kids are loaded back into the minivan. Noah buckles 
      Stacey into her car seat.

                                  STACEY
                    You ve got dirt on your face!

                                    WHITNEY
                    That s not dirt, stupid. That s dry 
                    blood.

                                  NOAH
                    Whitney, if you don t adjust the 
                    attitude, I swear to God ...

      In the front seat, Halla turns and looks at Noah, concerned.  

                                  HALLA
                    Is it still bleeding?

                                  NOAH
                    I doubt it. It was a tiny cut -

                                  HALLA
                    When we get to my parent s place, I 
                    want to see it.

      He freezes.                                                                                    22.


                                  HALLA (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  NOAH
                    I forgot to leave a tip. 

                                  HALLA
                    It s fine. She was obnoxious 
                    anyway.

                                  NOAH
                    Halla. They live on those tips. 
                    I ll be right back.

      Before she can stop him, he s jogging back across the parking 
      lot.


      INT. ELMO S PANCAKE PALACE - DAY.

      Noah enters from the outside. Alison is clearing off the 
      booth. He watches her from behind... her long, bare legs... 
      her slim waist... her neck...

      Just for a moment though. Then he pulls out his wallet, opens 
      it, finds a bill-

      She s moving back across the restaurant, trays in both hands, 
      stacked high with dirty dishes-

      Noah steps in front of her. She stops and smiles. It s 
      radiant.

                                  ALISON
                    Miss me?

                                  NOAH
                    I forgot to leave a tip. I m sorry. 
                    I m a little out of it today.

                                  ALISON
                      Understandably so.

                                  NOAH
                    This is, uh, this is for you.

      He holds up the twenty. But she has no hands. 

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Do you have a pocket or -

      He scans her body for someplace to tuck the money.                                                                                     23.


                                  ALISON
                    On my ass.

      She steps towards him. He looks over her shoulder, down her 
      back. Sees a pocket in the skirt.

                                  NOAH
                    Oh, you want me to ... okay.

      She moves even closer. Her breasts brush his chest. Before he 
      can think about what he s doing, Noah reaches around her 
      waist and slips the twenty into her back pocket.

                                  ALISON
                    Thank you.

                                  NOAH
                    You re welcome.

      Alison pivots gracefully and moves past him, into the 
      kitchen. He stares after her.


      EXT. BRUCE BUTLER S HOUSE - DAY.

      Huge wooden gates, covered with ivy, open slowly. The minivan 
      passes through and stops in the center of a circular, pebbled 
      drive. Before them stands a Georgian country masterpiece. One 
      of those dreamy old mansions, built by oil barons, during the 
      turn of the previous century.

      The front door swings open and Halla s mother, MARGARET, 65, 
      comes flying out.

                                  MARGARET
                    You re here! Finally!

      The kids pile out of the car. One-by-one they embrace their 
        grandmother. 

                                  MARGARET (CONT D)
                    Whitney let me look at you. God, 
                    you re so thin. Have you stopped 
                    eating or something?

                                  HALLA
                      Practically.

                                  MARGARET
                          (to Whitney)
                    Well, keep it up, you look 
                    fabulous.                                                                                    24.


                                  HALLA
                    Mom, this is not a behavior pattern 
                    we want to encourage.

                                  MARGARET
                    Don t listen to you mother. She s 
                    just jealous. She was always a 
                    donut. Lose a few more pounds dear, 
                    and I ll take you to Paris.

      Behind the car, Noah has opened the trunk and begun unloading 
      luggage. Martin sidles up to him.

                                  MARTIN
                    Aren t you worried these people are 
                    going to fuck us up royally?

                                  NOAH
                    Oh come on, your mother turned out 
                    okay.

                                  MARTIN
                    She s a nutjob too, Dad.

                                  NOAH
                    Maybe so, but if you keep talking 
                    about her like that, you re going 
                    to wind up with a fist in your 
                    mouth.

      Martin stares at Noah, shocked.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    We all have our limits, Pal.

      Martin walks away.


      EXT. YARD - DAY.

      Noah, a beer in hand, opens the screen door and steps out of 
      the house, unto the expansive deck. Before him is an epic 
      backyard. A swimming pool in the foreground. Tennis courts in 
      the distance. A flower garden. A vegetable garden. A 
      fountain. A gazebo. A hammock. 

      Trevor is already in the pool. Whitney is reading in the 
      hammock. Martin is hitting balls down on the tennis courts.

      Noah HEARS a sound behind him and turns. Halla s father, 
      BRUCE, 70, has joined him on the deck. He s holding a bottle 
      of white burgundy.                                                                                    25.


                                  BRUCE
                    Noah, I thought I might be able to 
                    interest in you in an apertif.

                                  NOAH
                    Thanks Bruce. I ve got a beer.

                                  BRUCE
                          (frowning)
                    Where in the world did you find 
                    that?

                                  NOAH
                    In the refrigerator?

                                  BRUCE
                    Huh. Must have been left by one of 
                    the Mexicans.

      Bruce pours himself a glass and shows the bottle to Noah.

                                  BRUCE (CONT D)
                    It was a gift from Paramount.

                                  NOAH
                    That s right. The new movie opens 
                    soon, doesn t it?

                                  BRUCE
                    Next month.

                                  NOAH
                    Have you seen it?

                                  BRUCE
                      I couldn t bear to. After the mess 
                    they made of my last book ... 
                    nobody listens to me out there. 
                    Nobody actually wants my opinion. 
                    They just want me to cash my check 
                    and show up at the premiere. So 
                    that s what I do now. And I feel 
                    like a bit of a whore, of course, 
                    but then I come home and I look 
                    around...

      He surveys his kingdom.

                                  BRUCE (CONT D)
                    And I feel better.

      Noah suppresses an eye roll. Both men drink.                                                                                    26.


                                  BRUCE (CONT D)
                    So, I read your little book.

      Noah winces.

                                  BRUCE (CONT D)
                    I enjoyed most of it very much. Of 
                    course you could have used a decent 
                    editor, but the first novel, by an 
                    unknown writer ... I m sure you 
                    didn t get to pick.

                                  NOAH
                    No.

                                  BRUCE
                    Halla tells us it did well? I don t 
                    keep up with such things.

                                  NOAH
                    Well enough to get a second book.

                                  BRUCE
                    Well congratulations, son. That s 
                    not easy to do.

      Bruce holds out his glass. They clink.

                                  BRUCE (CONT D)
                    Now you can finally quit that 
                    horrible job of yours.

                                  NOAH
                    It wasn t that big an advance.

                                  BRUCE
                    Oh no? Pity.

                                  NOAH
                    I like my job, Bruce. I wouldn t 
                    quit it even if I did make the kind 
                    of money you do.

                                  BRUCE
                    Your first book felt a bit 
                      disjointed, if you want to know the 
                    truth. Like you never really had 
                    the chance to complete a thought. 
                    You need to give yourself time,    
                    Noah. To write, of course, but just 
                    to be. Out here, some days I don t 
                    even go into my office. I just walk 
                    down to the beach and think. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    27.

                                  BRUCE (CONT'D)
                    By the time I sit back down at my 
                    computer, a whole chapter just 
                    flows out of me. 

      Noah doesn t respond.

                                  BRUCE (CONT D)
                    Everyone has one book in them. 
                    Almost nobody has two.

      Noah drains his beer. 

                                  BRUCE (CONT D)
                    How s the brownstone?

                                  NOAH
                    It s wonderful. 

                                  BRUCE
                    Large enough for all of you?

                                  NOAH
                          (flat)
                    Yes. Thank you again for the loan.

      Bruce waves him off.

                                  BRUCE
                    It was my pleasure. I couldn t have 
                    my grandchildren growing up in a 
                    tenement.


      INT. KITCHEN - DAY.

      Halla and her mother are making dinner in the kitchen. Stacey 
      is coloring at the table. Noah enters and retrieves another 
      beer from the fridge.

                                  NOAH
                    I m going to take a walk.

                                  MARGARET
                    Don t go far. We eat promptly at 
                    six. Otherwise Bruce gets 
                      heartburn. 

      Noah leaves.


      EXT. THE BEACH - DAY.

      Noah sits down by the surf, nursing his beer, watching the 
      waves. The beach is relatively empty.                                                                                     28.


      It s early in the season, and most of the sunbathers have 
      gone in for dinner. Only the SURFERS are still in the water, 
      sucking the marrow out of the swell.

      Out of the corner of his eye, Noah notices a ROGUE BOARD 
      drifting towards shore. He looks around for the owner, but 
      there s nobody close by. Worried that it will be swept out 
      again by the tide and lost, Noah gets up, wades into the 
      water to retrieve it. 

      Then he sits back down in his spot.

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    If you asked me if I was a happy 
                    man, back then, I would have said 
                    yes. I loved my wife. I loved my 
                    kids. My first book had just come 
                    out... everything I promised myself 
                    I d achieve when I was a young 
                    man... I d done it.

                                  VOICE
                    But?

                                  NOAH S VOICE 
                    That s the thing. There was no 
                     but .  When I look back on what 
                    happened, I couldn t tell you why.

      A SURFER appears suddenly, like a seal, in the white water. 
      He stands and waves. Around his ankle, there s a broken 
      leash. 

                                  SURFER
                          (re: the board)
                    Thanks for the rescue, man. It s 
                    getting gnarly out there.

                                  NOAH
                    No problem.

                                  SURFER
                    I m Cole.

                                  NOAH
                    Noah.

      They shake.

                                  COLE
                    You gonna paddle out?

                                  NOAH
                    No, I don t ... I m just watching.                                                                                    29.


                                  COLE
                    On vacation?

                                  NOAH
                    That s right.

                                  COLE
                    Want to learn? I teach people. I 
                    run a clinic. We meet every 
                    morning. Seven am at Tower 4. 

                                  NOAH
                    Thanks but I m not sure it s my 
                    thing.

                                  COLE
                    Where you staying?

      Noah gestures vaguely behind him in the direction of Bruce s 
      house.

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    Oh wow. You a wall street guy?

                                  NOAH
                          (surprised)
                    Do I look like a Wall Street guy?

                                  COLE
                    Hey, no offense man. I like Wall 
                    Street guys. They re psychopaths. 
                    They make good surfers.

                                  NOAH
                    I m a teacher. It s my father-in-
                    laws house.

                                  COLE
                    Ah. Well. I like teachers too. If 
                    you change your mind, just show up 
                    one morning. First lesson s on me.

                                  NOAH
                    Thanks man.

                                  COLE
                    It s the least I can do. You saved 
                    my board.

      Noah nods. Cole starts down the beach. As he walks away, Noah 
      SEES the tattoo of an angel spread across his back.                                                                                    30.


                                  COLE (CONT D)
                          (turning back)
                    If you see a bonfire outside your 
                    window tonight, that s my crew. 
                    We re having a sort of meet-and-
                    greet to see who s back for the 
                    season. You should come.

                                  NOAH
                    But I don t surf.

                                  COLE
                    Alright, don t come. But don t call 
                    the cops.


      INT. BRUCE S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT.

      Halla applies a fresh bandaid to the cut on Noah s forehead.

                                  HALLA
                    How did it happen again?

                                  NOAH
                    I told you. I slipped in the 
                    bathroom while I was washing my 
                    hands. The floor was wet. It was 
                    just ... it was stupid.

      Halla hesitates-

                                  HALLA
                    I was afraid you were having 
                    another seizure.

                                  NOAH
                    Stop -

                                  HALLA
                    You weren t feeling well all day.

                                  NOAH
                    There s nothing wrong with me. The 
                    doctors said so. You re making us 
                    both crazy worrying about it. 

      Halla s eyes start to well up.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Hey. Hey, look at me.

      She looks at him.                                                                                    31.


                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    What s the matter?

      She shakes her head.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    What s going on?

                                  HALLA
                    I don t want to lose you.

                                  NOAH
                    Halla. Baby. You re not going to 
                    lose me. You will never, ever, lose 
                    me. 

      She moves into his chest and he wraps his arms around her. He 
      kisses the top of her head ... her ear ... her neck... her 
      mouth...


      INT. BRUCE S HOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - NIGHT.

      Noah and Halla make love silently in a little attic room. 
      They move with the practiced familiarity of two people who 
      have been together for years, who know each other s bodies 
      like their own...

      Noah is close to coming. He shuts his eyes. His tongue slides 
      out of his mouth a little. Halla laughs.

      Noah s eyes pop open.

                                  NOAH
                    What?

                                  HALLA
                    Your face when you re about to come 
                    is funny.

      There s a SOUND outside the door. Halla freezes.

                                  HALLA (CONT D)
                    Did you hear something?

                                  NOAH
                    No.

                                  HALLA
                    I did. Stop, stop.

      From outside the door, comes a light scratching, and then-                                                                                    32.


                                  STACEY S VOICE
                    Mama? I had a bad dream.

      Noah groans and rolls off of his wife for the second time 
      that day. Halla scrambles out of bed and opens the door. 
      Stacey is huddled on the floor, crying. Halla swoops her 
      daughter up in her arms.

                                  STACEY
                    I don t like it here.

                                  HALLA
                    It s okay, baby. It s just a 
                    strange house. You can sleep with 
                    us. 


      INT. BRUCE S HOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - LATER.

      The room is dark. Noah and Halla lie in bed with Stacey 
      between them. The girls are fast asleep. Noah is awake, 
      staring at the ceiling. He turns and looks out the window. 
      From this high up, he has a clear view, past the backyard, 
      over the dunes, all the way to the water. There, in the 
      distance, he can see the distinct flicker of fire.

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    I was a little restless, sure. But 
                    all men are a little restless.

      He turns and looks at his sleeping family. 


      EXT. DUNES - NIGHT.

      Noah quietly opens the wooden gate that separates Bruce s 
      property from the sand. He continues down a small path of 
      wooden planks through the dunes. 

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    You give up some personal liberties 
                    to live in a secure state. On all 
                    levels. National. Municipal. 
                    Marital.

      The sky above him is streaked with stars.


      EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

      Noah wanders down the deserted beach, headed towards the 
      bonfire.                                                                                     33.


                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    I d never had a problem with it 
                    before. I liked being married. When 
                    other men used to complain about 
                    their wives, I d just think  Well 
                    that poor sucker made a bad 
                    choice. 

      Up ahead, he sees a woman sitting alone on the sand, close to 
      the surf. As he crosses behind her, she turns to look at him. 

      It s Alison. Her face is illuminated by the moon. She looks 
      stunning. Otherwordly. 

                                  NOAH
                          (amazed)
                    Hi.

                                  ALISON
                    You found me.

                                  NOAH
                    What? No, I was just ... I was just 
                    out for a walk and you happened to 
                    be -

                                  ALISON
                          (smiling)
                    Hey Noah? I was kidding. 

                                  NOAH
                    Oh. Right. Sorry, I -

                                  ALISON
                    How s your head?

                                  NOAH
                    It s - uh - it s fine now. Thank 
                    you.

                                  ALISON
                    Are you going to the party?

                                  NOAH
                    Uh - what party?

                                  ALISON
                    The surfers are throwing a bonfire.

                                  NOAH
                    I don t surf.

                                  ALISON
                    Me neither. Walk me home then?                                                                                    34.


                                  NOAH
                          (surprised)
                    Um, okay.

                                  ALISON
                    Unless you have somewhere else to 
                    be?

                                  NOAH
                    No, I - where do you live?

                                  ALISON
                    I m just up over that dune.

      She holds out her hand to him for assistance. He pulls her up 
      to stand. She tries to brush the sand off her body. 

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    Would you mind cleaning the places 
                    I can t reach?

      She turns her rear towards him. She s wearing jeans and a 
      thin tank. There s sand caked all over her very attractive 
      ass. 

      Beat.

                                  NOAH
                    I don t think that s a good idea.

      Alison turns back towards Noah and grins.

                                  ALISON
                    Fair enough.

      She pulls a pack of cigarettes out of her purse.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    Want one?


      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT.

      Noah and Alison walk down a little paved road that runs 
      parallel to the beach. They re both smoking.

                                  ALISON
                    I don t get it. Are you a writer or 
                    not?

                                  NOAH
                    I ve written a book.                                                                                    35.


                                  ALISON
                    So you are then.

                                  NOAH
                    No, but you know what they say. 
                    Everyone has at least one book in 
                    them. You haven t really proven 
                    anything until you ve followed it 
                    up.

                                  ALISON
                    I don t know anyone who says that. 

                                  NOAH
                          (weary)
                    I do.

                                  ALISON
                    Sounds like you hang out with 
                    assholes.

      Noah smiles. He s never thought of it that way.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    And your wife? What does she do?

                                  NOAH
                    She, um, she sells luxury books.

                                  ALISON
                          (frowning)
                    Luxury books?

                                  NOAH
                    You know, coffee table books. On 
                    fashion. Or travel. Lifestyle 
                    stuff.

                                  ALISON
                    She s a writer too?

                                  NOAH
                    No, she doesn t - she sells them. 
                    To hotels and fancy stores. 

                                  ALISON
                    So she sells books that rich people 
                    read?

                                  NOAH
                    Well, I mean, you certainly can 
                    read them. But mostly, they re kind 
                    of decorative.                                                                                     36.


      Alison laughs.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  ALISON
                    Nothing. I just never knew that was 
                    a job.

                                  NOAH
                    Yeah, well, it s not like curing 
                    cancer, but Halla s got a great 
                    eye, so...

      Alison stops.

                                  ALISON
                    This is me.

      They re standing in front of a gravel driveway which leads to 
      a small, airy beach cottage, up on stilts. 

                                  NOAH
                    Wow. What a great house. 

                                  ALISON
                    I think so.

      She heads up the driveway.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    So does she sell your book?

      Noah is lost for a moment in the moonlit perfection of this 
      little bungalow.

                                  NOAH
                    What? No.


      EXT. OUTDOOR SHOWER - NIGHT.

      Alison leads Noah around the side of the house to a quaint 
      water closet made entirely of wooden planks. She strips down 
      to her bikini and steps inside, barely closing the slotted 
      door behind her.

                                  ALISON (O.C.)
                          (from inside the shower)
                    Do you mind if I just rinse off?

                                  NOAH
                    Not at all.                                                                                    37.


      The SOUND of water turning on. Behind the door, steam begins 
      to rise. A moment and then Alison s bikini top drops to her 
      feet.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    I love these things.

                                  ALISON (O.C.)
                    What?

                                  NOAH
                          (shouting)
                    I said I love these things!

                                  ALISON (O.C.)
                    Outdoor showers?

                                  NOAH
                          (shouting)
                    Yeah.

                                  ALISON (O.C.)
                    Come on in! When the planks get wet 
                    they smell like pine.

                                  NOAH
                          (shouting)
                    I can smell it from here!

      Alison s wet head appears around the door. She reaches out a 
      glistening hand.

                                  ALISON
                    You have to try it.

      She grabs Noah s arm. Her touch startles him. Snaps him back 
      to reality. 

                                  NOAH
                          (sharply)
                    No.

      He pulls away, almost violently. He looks around. What is he 
      doing here?

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    I have to go. It s late. I ll, um,  
                    I ll see you around. 

      Noah turns and leaves as quickly as he can.                                                                                    38.


      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT.

      Noah walks down the dark road, trying to calm his heartbeat. 
      Behind him, he HEARS the muffled sound of a man and a woman 
      arguing. The woman s voice sounds a lot like Alison. 

      The fight seems to escalate. They re screaming at each other.

      Noah slows down.


      EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT.

      Shrouded by shadows, on the far side of the street, Noah 
      watches the events unfolding down Alison s driveway.

      She s wrapped in a towel talking to a MAN, mid-30s, in swim 
      trunks. Noah is too far away to hear what they re saying. A 
      surfboard leans against a parked car.

      Alison PUSHES the man away as hard as she can. As he stumbles 
      back, the motion-sensitive light switches on and Noah can see 
      his face -

      It s Cole.

      Cole reaches for Alison. She SLAPS his hand away. He comes at 
      her again, grabbing her by the hair, whispering into her ear.  
      Noah doesn t know what to do. It looks like she s being 
      attacked. He steps forward, into the street, with the intent 
      of saving her -

      Just as he does, she turns her head and looks down the 
      driveway. Noah FREEZES. She seems to SEE him. Somehow, 
      through the dark, she s looking right at him. 

      Then she does something strange. She SHAKES HER HEAD. It s a 
      slight movement, but it s clear. 

      Alison turns back to Cole and says something incendiary. He 
      takes a beat, looks at her, then he PUSHES her against the 
      hood of the parked car. He bends her over on her stomach and 
      enters her from behind.

      Alison rests her head against the hood of the car. She s 
      facing down the driveway. She s facing Noah. Her eyes meet 
      his and LOCK.

      He knows he should go - it isn t right to watch - but he 
      can t move. He can t breathe. Somehow he knows that she wants 
      him to stay. Like she s putting on a show.  

      For him.                                                                                    39.


      INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY.

      Noah is sitting across the table from a POLICE OFFICER, mid-
      40s. His hair is shorter, almost cropped. He s older too, 
      though it s difficult to say how much. He looks beyond tired. 
      He s weary.

      He stares off into space, remembering.

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    Mr. Kalish? Mr. Kalish?

      Noah snaps back to the present moment.

                                  POLICE OFFICER (CONT D)
                    Then what happened?

                                  NOAH
                    What do you mean?

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    You walked her home and then?

      Noah looks at the cop. Confused. Innocent. He shrugs.

                                  NOAH
                    Nothing. I left.



                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

                                  PART TWO: ALISON


      INT. ALISON S HOUSE - DAY.

      Ditch Plains, Montauk. Dawn. The same beach cottage. Up on 
      stilts, with a view of the ocean.

      ALISON, 31, lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. She turns 
      over and looks at COLE, 35, sleeping next to her. He s facing 
      away from her, curled around a pillow.

      Alison stares at his back. Between his shoulders, there s a  
      striking TATOO of the archangel Gabriel, as a child, sitting 
      down, holding his knees to his chest. His wings are spread 
        majestically behind him. A sword lies at his feet.

      Alison reaches her hand out to touch the tattoo, then thinks 
      better of it, and slips out of bed instead.


      INT. ALISON S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY.

      Cosy and cluttered. Shells from the Maldives, rocks from 
      Hawaii, wood carvings from Indonesia. The old wood floors are 
      covered with colorful rugs. The couches are deep and faded by 
      the sun.

      Alison fills a tea kettle with water and sets it to boil on 
      the stove.

                                  COLE (O.S.)
                          (from the other room)
                    Where d you go?

                                  ALISON
                    Nowhere. 

                                  COLE (O.S.)
                    Come back to bed.

                                  ALISON
                    Okay.

      She doesn t move.


      INT. BEDROOM - DAY.

      Alison climbs back into bed. Cole turns and wraps his arms 
      around her. 

                                  COLE
                    How d you sleep?                                                                                    41.


                                  ALISON
                    Fine.

                                  COLE
                    Any dreams?

      Alison frowns, trying to remember -

                                  ALISON
                    No.

                                  COLE
                    You re supposed to write them down 
                    as soon as you wake up.

      Alison looks to the bed stand on her left, where a silly pink 
       dream journal  remains in its packaging.

                                  ALISON
                    Okay.

                                  COLE
                    That lady we talked to said it 
                    would really help.

                                  ALISON
                    I know.

                                  COLE
                      I remember my dream.

      He pulls her closer to him. 

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    Want to hear?

                                  ALISON
                    I don t know... 
                          (she kisses his neck)
                    Was it dirty? 

                                  COLE
                    Not exactly.

      She moves down his chest.

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    You were pregnant.

      She freezes.

                                  ALISON
                    Really.                                                                                    42.


                                  COLE
                    Really. 
                          (beat)
                    What do you think about that? 

      They stare at each other. It s a serious question. 

      Alison doesn t answer. Instead, she moves her mouth farther 
      down his stomach. Cole makes a half-hearted attempt to stop 
      her -

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    Ali...

      Her head disappears from frame. Cole gives up. He lies back 
      and groans. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Alison and Cole having sex. He s on top. She s staring at the 
      ceiling. Her arms are wrapped around him. But her expression 
      is oddly vacant. Like her mind is someplace else entirely. 

      Cole comes ferociously. He rolls to one side. She looks at 
      him and smiles.

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    How was that?

                                  ALISON
                    Really good.

      Cole knows she s lying. He sighs. 


      EXT. ALISON S HOUSE - DECK - DAY.

      An hour later. Alison emerges from the house, holding her 
      tea. She sits down in a rocking chair and looks out. Across 
      the street, she can SEE a section of the ocean between two 
      houses. The sun is rising over the water. 

      On the driveway below, Cole appears, in a half-zipped 
      wetsuit, carrying his surfboard under his arm.

      He waves to her. She waves back.

                                  COLE
                          (calling up)
                    What are you doing today?

                                  ALISON
                    I was thinking about going to work.                                                                                    43.


                                  COLE
                    And later?

      She shrugs.

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    I m going to swing by and visit him 
                    after my clinic this afternoon. 
                    Want to meet me there?

                                  ALISON
                    Okay.

                                  COLE
                    Can you be there by four?

                                  ALISON
                    I think so.

                                  COLE
                    Cool. And then afterwards, I want 
                    to take you out to dinner. Unless 
                    you already have a hot date?

                                  ALISON
                    I have to check my calendar.

      Cole grins.

                                  COLE
                    You do that.

      He starts down the driveway. She watches him go. Suddenly, 
      she stands and goes to the railing -

                                  ALISON
                    Be careful!

      Cole stops, turns back. He looks concerned.

                                  COLE
                    I will, Ali.


      EXT. OUTDOOR SHOWER - DAY.

      Alison sits on the floor of the outdoor shower, under the 
      spray. She s staring at the water as it hits her feet and 
      disappears between the slatted wooden planks. We get the 
      feeling she s been sitting there for a while. Like, maybe, 
      she s having a hard time getting up.                                                                                    44.


      A VOICE starts speaking. It s the same voice we heard on 
      Noah s side, the POLICE OFFICER. And just like Noah, Alison 
      doesn t seem to HEAR it.

                                  VOICE
                    Why don t you tell me how it began?

                                  ALISON S VOICE
                    Oh God, it was so long ago, who 
                      remembers?

                                  VOICE
                    We re hoping that you do, Ms. 
                    Bailey.


      EXT. ROAD - DAY.

      Alison peddles her bicycle along the side of Montauk Highway 
      on her way into town. The road is mostly deserted. The sun is 
      now cresting over the tops of the hills. 

                                  ALISON S VOICE
                    It all started on a dark and stormy 
                    night. 
                          (beat)
                    Oh, God, I m kidding. Please don t 
                    write that down.


      INT. ELMO S PANCAKE PALACE - BATHROOM - DAY.

      In a dirty, cramped employee bathroom, Alison changes into 
      her uniform. A short, candy-striper dress. She rolls her hair 
      into a tight bun and covers it with a baseball cap that reads 
      ELMO S PANCAKE PALACE.


      INT. ELMO S PANCAKE PALACE - KITCHEN - DAY.

      Alison emerges from the bathroom into the restaurant kitchen. 
      The LINE COOKS are behind the counter, prepping food. 

                                  LINE COOKS
                    Alison! Que pasa?

                                  ALISON
                    Otro dia juntos en el paraiso.


      They laugh. She goes to the linen closet, finds an employee 
      apron, order pad, etc., then turns and bumps smack into -

      LUTHER, mid-thirties. Too handsome for his own good.                                                                                    45.


                                  LUTHER
                    Hey, good morning.

                                  ALISON
                    Luther. What are you doing here?

                                  LUTHER
                    I own the place.

                                  ALISON
                    It s seven am. Isn t that your 
                    bedtime?

                                  LUTHER
                    Ha.


      INT. ELMO S PANCAKE PALACE - COUNTER - DAY.

      Alison stands behind the counter, wiping down menus and 
      stacks them in a pile. Luther hovers.

                                  LUTHER
                    So what s going on, Bailey?

                                  ALISON
                    Not much.

                                  LUTHER
                    You know what I was thinking about 
                    last night? That first summer you 
                    came to work for us. What were you, 
                    sixteen? My father still owned the 
                    place. I was working behind the 
                    counter. Remember that?

                                  ALISON
                    Sure.

                                  LUTHER
                    God, you were so hot back then, in 
                    your little candy stripes. 

      She tries to ignore him.

                                  LUTHER (CONT D)
                    Not to say there s anything wrong 
                    with you now, but fifteen years 
                    ago... jesus. I thought, if I just 
                    put my noodle in that girl s ca-ca 
                    before I turn 18, I will die a 
                    happy man. And then I did. The end.

      She glares at him. He grins.                                                                                    46.

                    I love that story.

      Alison moves down the counter and begins scooping butter from 
      a large tubs, into individual serving trays.

                    How s Cole?

                                  ALISON
                    He s fine.

                                  LUTHER
                    You guys still shacked up together?

                                  ALISON
                    We re married, Luther.

                                  LUTHER
                    Listen. I didn t want to be the one 
                    to have to tell you this, but the 
                    last couple of times I ve been down 
                    to Ditch Plains, he s been joined 
                    at the hip with this girl named 
                    Jolene.

                                  ALISON
                    She works for him. Just like I work 
                    for you.

                                  LUTHER
                    Okay maybe. But have you seen her? 
                    Because assuming she s not half the 
                    bitch you are (and honestly, how 
                    could she be) and assuming Cole has 
                    eyes in his head, I m telling you, 
                    it s just a matter of time until -

                                  ALISON
                          (annoyed)
                    Don t finish that sentence.

      JANE, late twenties, enters the restaurant from the outside 
      door, already in her uniform.

                                  JANE
                    Sorry I m late.

                    Jesus Jane.

      She stops. Confused.                                                                                    47.


                                  JANE
                    What the hell are you doing here?

                                  LUTHER
                    This is my restaurant. Why does 
                    everyone keep asking me that?

                                  JANE

                    Yes.

                                  JANE
                    Why did you come in?

                                  ALISON

                    I have to leave a little early

                    What?

                                  JANE
                    Are you high?

                                  LUTHER
                    No, this is natural charm.


      He storms out of the restaurant, back into the kitchen. The 
      girls look at each other and laugh.                                                                                    48.


      INT. ELMO S PANCAKE PALACE - COUNTER - LATER.

      Mid-afternoon. The lunch rush is finally clearing out. Jane 
      and Alison are both back behind the counter, looking worse 
      for wear. Alison consolidates ketchup bottles. Jane empties 
      the coffee and makes another pot.

                                  JANE
                    I went to see that psychic 
                      yesterday.

                                  ALISON
                    The one your cousin knows?

                                  JANE
                    Yeah. Her boat is parked down at 
                    the Marina.

      Jane finds a glittering business card in her purse and holds 
      it up for Alison to see.

                                  ALISON
                    And?

                                  JANE
                    She was incredible. I swear to God 
                    I didn t tell her a thing, but she 
                    knew my whole life. All about Tim. 
                    She knew that he was married and 
                    that he had three kids. She told me 
                    that it was an impossible 
                      relationship and that I had to end 
                    it.

                                  ALISON
                    I ve been telling you that for six 
                    months.

                                  JANE
                    Yes, but she s a professional. And 
                    she said she had a vision of me 
                    standing beneath a waterfall with 
                    the man I was going to marry.

                                  ALISON
                          (genuinely)
                    That s very exciting.

                                  JANE
                    Isn t it? Do you know where I can 
                    find a waterfall?                                                                                    49.


                                  ALISON
                    I think there are some in upstate 
                    New York. I ll borrow the truck 
                    from Cole and take you next 
                    weekend.

                                  JANE
                    Really? 

                                  ALISON
                    Sure. We ll make a day of it. Maybe 
                    go into the city afterwards. Find a 
                    club...

                                  JANE
                    What if we meet my soulmate?

                                  ALISON
                    We ll bring him with us.

                                  JANE
                    What if he doesn t like clubbing?


      A BELL rings to indicate the front door has opened. Noah and 
      his family enter the restaurant. Noah is holding Stacey, 
      who s half-dozing, sucking her thumb against his shoulder. He 
      talks to her softly, trying to wake her up. She nods and then 
      cranes her little neck to kiss him on the cheek.

                                  VOICE
                    Do you remember seeing him for the 
                    first time?

                                  ALISON S VOICE
                    Yes.

                                  VOICE
                    Do you remember what you thought?

      No response.

                                  VOICE (CONT D)
                    Ms. Bailey?

                                  ALISON S VOICE
                      I remember he was holding his 
                    daughter.

      Halla looks around the restaurant for someone to help them. 
      She sees Jane and Alison behind the counter and gives an 
      impatient little wave.                                                                                    50.


                                  JANE
                      A six-top. Awesome.

      She grabs some menus off the pile.

                                  ALISON
                    I ll take them.

                                  JANE
                    Don t you have to go soon?  

                                  ALISON
                    I ll cover this table. Then I ll 
                    leave.

      Alison takes the menus from Jane and heads across the 
      restaurant.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    Welcome to Elmo s. Will you need a 
                    high chair?

      Noah looks up at her and smiles.

                                  NOAH
                    That would be great.


                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. ELMO S PANCAKE PALACE - COUNTER - DAY.

      A few minutes later. Alison fills six glasses with ice water.

      She notices the card for Jane s psychic lying on the counter. 
      She picks it up, considering...

      Suddenly, Noah and Stacey appear on stools in front of her. 
      Alison quickly pockets the card.

                                  ALISON
                    Why hello.

                                  NOAH
                    Hello. We re sorry to bother you. 
                    We were wondering if you had any 
                    crayons.

                                  ALISON
                    I bet I do.

      Alison smiles at Stacey. The little girl just looks at her 
      shyly. She s sucking on a necklace of plastic beads.                                                                                    51.


                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    My God, she s cute.

                                  NOAH
                    Yeah, I think so.

      Alison finds a pail of crayons behind the counter.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Oh Stacey. Look what the nice 
                    waitress gave you. What do you say?

                                  STACEY
                    Thank you very much.

      Alison s heart melts. 

                                  ALISON
                    You re very welcome, Darling. 

      Meanwhile, Noah has put two crayons up his nose and he s 
      coloring with them on the back of paper place mat.

                                  NOAH
                    Look at me. I m a coloring walrus!

      Stacey laughs. Alison notices one of the beads in her 
      necklace is MISSING.

                                  ALISON
                    Oh no, you ve lost a bead.

                                  NOAH
                    What?

      Noah takes the necklace out of Stacey s mouth and looks at 
      it.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Shit. Stacey, did you swallow one 
                    of these?

      Before she can respond, Noah dumps the crayons out on the 
      counter. Then he plugs Stacey s nose, put his finger in her 
      mouth and makes her vomit into the pail. It all happens so 
      quickly, and he s so nonchalant about it, that Stacey doesn t 
      even have time to get scared. She whimpers a little, when 
      it s over, but doesn t cry. Noah pulls her onto his lap.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    You re okay, baby. You re okay.

      Noah looks down into the bucket and pulls out a bead.                                                                                    52.


                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Look at what was in your tummy! 
                    That s not food.

      Alison stares at him, amazed. She s never seen a man handle a 
      child so easily.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                          (re: the bucket)
                    I m sorry about the -

                                  ALISON
                    No, it s okay. Is she-

                                  NOAH
                    She s fine. Maybe, if you have some 
                    apple juice or something?

                                  ALISON
                    I ll bring it right over to you.

      Noah picks up Stacey and carries her back to the booth. 
      Alison turns to the soda fountain, reeling.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. ELMO S PANCAKE PALACE - DINING ROOM - DAY.

      Alison carries a tray full of drinks across the restaurant. 
      Noah comes towards her, from the other direction. He looks 
      suddenly quite pale. There are sweat beads forming along his 
      hairline

                                  ALISON
                    Are you alright?

                                  NOAH
                    Fine. Could you just tell me where 
                    the bathroom - 

                                  ALISON
                    Past the bar. Door on the left.

      Noah presses past her, stumbling a little. She watches him 
      go, concerned.


      INT. ELMO S PANCAKE PALACE - DAY.

      Alison pushes through a door marked  Restrooms , which opens 
      unto a little hallway. Noah is sitting on the ground, in a 
      daze. His head is bleeding.                                                                                    53.


                                  ALISON
                    Oh my God! Are you alright?

                                  NOAH
                    I think so.

                                  ALISON
                    What happened?

                                  NOAH
                    I m not sure. I may have had a 
                    seizure.

                                  ALISON
                      A seizure? 

                                  NOAH
                    Just a little one.

                                  ALISON
                    Wait, I ll go get your wife.

                                  NOAH
                    No -

                                  ALISON
                    No?

                                  NOAH
                    I ll be alright. Could you just... 
                    could you sit with me for a second?

      Alison looks at him warily.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    I m really okay. This has happened 
                    before. I just need to rest for a 
                    moment.

      She sits down next to him. He looks at her. Tries to smile.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    I m Noah, by the way.

                                  ALISON
                    I m Alison.

      Noah leans his head back against the wall and closes his 
      eyes. Alison watches him. She s suddenly overwhelmed with 
      tenderness for this man. She wants to reach out to him. To 
      take his hand or something.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    This really isn t your day, is it?                                                                                    54.


                                  NOAH
                          (eyes still closed)
                    I ve had worse.

      A phone RINGS in Alison s pocket. She takes it out and looks 
      at the caller ID. It s Cole.

      Alison quickly silences the ringer and puts the phone away.

                                  ALISON
                    Sorry. Wait here. I ll find you a 
                    bandaid.

      Noah opens his eyes and looks at her.

                                  NOAH
                          (sincerely)
                    Thank you. 


      INT. ELMO S PANCAKE PALACE - DAY.

      The restaurant is practically empty. Alison clears off the 
      carnage that Noah s family left in the booth. Jane comes up 
      with a tray, to help her.

                                  JANE
                    Please go. Let me finish this.

                                  ALISON
                    You sure?

                                  JANE
                    Yes, go. Get out of here. Tell Cole 
                    I say hello.

                                  ALISON
                    You re the greatest.

      Alison removes her hat and apron and shakes out her hair.

                                  JANE
                    How d you make out?

                                  ALISON
                    What? Oh, they stiffed me.

                                  JANE
                    Really?

      Alison nods.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Assholes.                                                                                    55.


      EXT. ROAD - DAY.

      Alison, back in her civilian clothes, rides her bike through 
      the quaint beach town. 

      She stops in front of a little bakery and hops off.


      INT. BAKERY - DAY.

      Alison points to a chocolate cupcake covered with rainbow 
      sprinkles.

                                  ALISON S VOICE
                    Look, I can t really tell you what 
                    I was thinking. That first year, 
                      everything was still such a blur.

                                  ALISON
                    Three please. And some candles.


      EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY.

      With the cupcakes packaged neatly in her basket, Alison rides 
      along the side of the road.

                                  ALISON
                    I do remember the sun was really 
                    bright. Like, unusually strong for 
                    so early in the season. 

      She stops at a four-way intersection, gets off her bike and 
      walks it off the road, to the mouth of a dirt lane flanked by 
      holly trees. 

      She shades her eyes with her hand and stares down the path.

                                  ALISON S VOICE
                    There was no place to hide. 


      EXT. MARINA - DAY.

      Alison rides her bike into the parking lot of the fishing 
      marina.


      EXT. DOCKS - DAY.

      Alison stands at the end of one of the docks.

      She reaches into her bag and pulls out the glittery business 
      card that Jane left on the counter.                                                                                    56.


      It reads: 

                  Isabel Guralnik, Psychic.  The Painted Lady 

      Alison looks up again. Sure enough, the boat in front of her 
      is called The Painted Lady.


      INT. ISABEL S BOAT - HULL - DAY.

      WHACK. A knife descends on a cutting board, severing a fish 
      head. 

      A woman, ISABEL, mid-60s, with a crown of kinky grey hair, 
      tosses the head in a nearby bucket. Alison nervously sits at 
      a little card table, watching her.

                                  ISABEL
                    So you re a friend of Jane s?

                                  ALISON
                    We grew up together.

                                  ISABEL
                    Where?

                                  ALISON
                    Here.

      Isabel turns and looks at Alison over her crooked wire-rimmed 
      frames.

                                  ISABEL
                    In Montauk?

                                  ALISON
                    That s right.

                                  ISABEL
                    A native. That s very good. That 
                    means your reading will be very 
                    clear. 

      With one swift motion, Isabel tears out the fish s spine.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. THE HULL - LATER.

      Isabel sits across the card table from Alison. A line of 
      tarot cards are spread between them.                                                                                     57.


                                  ISABEL
                    And the final card.

      Isabel flips over The Devil.

                                  ISABEL (CONT D)
                    Lucifer. That s worrisome. 

                                  ALISON
                    Am I going to die?

                                  ISABEL
                    No, that s not what Lucifer means. 
                    This is the card of temptation. 
                    Something is coming. Something... 
                      powerful... wild... ... it may be a 
                    very good thing... or he may 
                    enslave you. 

                                  ALISON
                    He?

      Isabel frowns at the cards.

                                  ISABEL
                    This is very strange.

      She holds up another card. It s the picture of a very young 
      squire. 

                                  ALISON
                    Who is that?

                                  ISABEL
                    The Page of Cups. Do you have any 
                    children?

      Beat.

                                  ALISON
                    No.

                                  ISABEL
                    Huh. Then I think you are about to 
                    receive a message. Be careful with 
                      messenger. He is very sensitive. 
                    You must be clear with him. Or he 
                    will misunderstand you. He wants to 
                      misunderstand you.

      Alison picks up the card and stares at the smiling little 
      boy.                                                                                    58.


      EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY.

      Alison is back at the same the intersection. Again, she 
      stares down the dirt road lined with holly trees. 

      She gets off her bike and starts to walk it slowly up the 
      lane.


      EXT. CEMETERY GATES - DAY.

      Alison stops at the entrance to a small, New England 
      cemetery. She leans her bike against a crumbling stone wall 
      and takes out the box of cupcakes.

      She checks the time on her phone. It s already 6 pm. 

      And there are three MISSED CALLS from Cole.


      EXT. CEMETERY - DAY.

      Alison sits in front of a newish headstone. She traces her 
      hand over the engraving.

      It reads: 
                          GABRIEL BAILEY, 2011-2013. 

      There are fresh flowers on the grave and a little keychain 
      with a surfboard attached. Cole, it seems, has already been 
      there.

      Alison unwraps the bakery box and takes out one of the 
      cupcakes. She sticks a candle on top, lights it, and places 
      it at the foot of the grave.

      Then she kneels down, gets her face very close to the ground, 
      and begins to sing. 

                                  ALISON
                          (singing)
                    Happy Birthday to you. Happy 
                    Birthday to you. Happy Birthday 
                    dear Munchkin. 

      She chokes on a unexpected sob. She wipes a sudden torrent of 
      tears away with the back of her hand.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    Happy Birthday to you.

      Alison presses her ear to the earth as if she s listening for 
      a response.                                                                                     59.


      EXT.  CEMETERY - LATER.

      Hours later. The last rays of the summer sun hover on the 
      horizon. Alison is sleeping on Gabriel s grave. She wakes 
      with a start and looks around, confused. Without the bright 
      sunlight, the cemetery is a very different place. The tall 
      trees that were sheltering her from the sunlight, just hours 
      before, are now hulking, menacing. The shadows are long.

      She s frightened. She quickly pulls out her phone and makes a 
      call.

                                  ALISON
                    Cole?


      EXT. CEMETERY GATES -NIGHT.

      Alison sits on the stone gates, waiting. Headlights down the 
      dirt path. They come closer and closer, blinding her. A pick-
      up truck stops and Cole gets out. He looks at his wife. 

                                  ALISON
                    Please don t be mad.

      Cole silently loads her bike into the back of his truck. 


      INT. ALISON S HOUSE - NIGHT.

      Alison opens the oven. She pulls out a tray with dried pot 
      leaves spaced in neat rows. 


      EXT. DECK - NIGHT.

      Alison expertly crumples a leaf between her fingers. She 
      rolls the joint quickly, lights one end with a lighter and 
      takes an epic drag.  

      She leans back in the rocking chair and watches the stars 
      coming out. Her shoulders slowly loosen and fall. 

      Alison HEARS the sound of a screen door opening beneath her. 
      Cole appears in the driveway below, his wet suit half-zipped, 
      carrying a surfboard.   

                                  ALISON
                          (surprised)
                    You re going out again?                                                                                    60.


                                  COLE
                    I had a lousy surf. Broke my strap. 
                    Almost lost my board. Gonna try to 
                    redeem myself.

                                  ALISON
                    Alone? 

                                  COLE
                    Unless you want to come with me?

      Beat. Then Alison shakes her head.

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    That s what I thought. 

      He stands his board up and examines it.

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    Are you ever going to get back in 
                    the water?

                                  ALISON
                    I don t know. 
                          (beat)
                    I m sorry.

                                  COLE
                    I don t care. I just thought you d 
                    miss it.

                                  ALISON
                    No, I mean, I m sorry about this 
                      afternoon. 

      Cole looks up at her.

                                  COLE
                    I went by the restaurant. They said 
                    you d left hours ago. Where were 
                    you?

      Alison shrugs, helplessly.

                                  ALISON
                    Nowhere.

      Cole just sighs. He picks up his board and heads down the 
      driveway.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                          (calling after him)
                    Be careful.                                                                                    61.


      This time he doesn t turn around.


      EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT.

      A few hours later. Alison sits on the beach, wrapped in a 
      wool blanket, watching the surf. 

                                  ALISON
                    I was thirty-one years old. I 
                    remember promising myself I d get 
                    to thirty-five. I d make it through 
                    until then. And if nothing had 
                      changed... well then I d tried hard 
                    enough. 

      She HEARS a noise behind her and turns around. She s shocked 
      to see Noah, smiling down at her.

                                  NOAH
                    Hello.

                                  ALISON
                          (stunned)
                    Hi.

                                  NOAH
                    I found you. 

                                  ALISON
                          (confused)
                    Were you looking for me?

                                  NOAH
                    I m kidding. I was just on my way 
                    to that barbecue down there. 

                                  ALISON
                    Oh you re a surfer?

                                  NOAH
                    Yeah. Sort of. I m learning ... do 
                    you live around here?

                                  ALISON
                    Right over that dune.

                                  NOAH
                    Cool.

      Noah just stands there, grinning. 

                                  ALISON
                    How s your head?                                                                                    62.


      Noah touches his bandage.

                                  NOAH
                    Oh it s okay. I think.

                                  ALISON
                    Did you end up going to the 
                    hospital?

                                  NOAH
                    No, I couldn t face it. I might go 
                    tomorrow.
                          (beat)
                    Can I join you?

                                  ALISON
                    Uh, sure.

                                  NOAH
                    Or, I m sorry - did you want to be 
                    alone?

                                  ALISON
                    No, no. Sit.

      Noah sits down happily, next to her. He takes out a pack of 
      cigarettes and offers her one.

                                  NOAH
                    Want one? They re french.

                                  ALISON
                    I quit a while ago.

                                  NOAH
                    Me too. But I m on vacation.

      Alison smiles.

                                  ALISON
                    Okay. Why not.

      She takes one and he lights it for her.

                                  NOAH
                    I only allow myself to smoke french 
                      cigarettes.

                                  ALISON
                    Why?                                                                                    63.


                                  NOAH
                    Because they re so hard to come by. 
                    I usually give up before I find 
                    one.

      Alison laughs. 

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    So I m Noah, in case you -

                                  ALISON
                      I remember. I m Alison.

                                  NOAH
                    I know. I m sorry again, about this 
                      afternoon. 

                                  ALISON
                    Don t worry about it.

                                  NOAH
                    I can t believe I made you watch me 
                    choke my kid.

                                  ALISON
                    Things happen. Kids are stupid.
                          (beat)
                    I m glad she s alright.

                                  NOAH
                    And then I had a seizure in your -

                                  ALISON
                    Hey, Noah. Do I look upset?

                                  NOAH
                          (honest)
                    You look great.

      Alison flushes. She wasn t expecting that. 

                                  ALISON
                    Then drop it.

                                  NOAH
                    Okay.

      They resume staring at the ocean.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    So do you live out here year round?

                                  ALISON
                    Yup.                                                                                    64.


                                  NOAH
                    What do people do  for fun?

                                  ALISON
                    With kids? All sorts of things - 
                    surfing, sailing, fishing -

                                  NOAH
                    No, I mean, single people.

      He turns and stares right at her. Almost like he s asking her 
      out.

                                  ALISON
                    Um... I wouldn t know.

                                  NOAH
                    You re not fun?

                                  ALISON
                    I m not single.

                                  NOAH
                          (surprised)
                    You re married?

      She nods.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    But no ring.

                                  ALISON
                    We re both surfers. We were afraid 
                    we d lose them in the water. 

                                  NOAH
                    Wow. You re married.

                                  ALISON
                    You sound shocked.

                                  NOAH
                    It s just, you seem so...

      Alison frowns.

                                  ALISON
                    What?

                                  NOAH
                      Independent.                                                                                    65.


                                  ALISON
                          (touched)
                    Oh. Thanks.

      Beat.

                                  NOAH
                    Any children?

      Alison looks at the sea again.

                                  ALISON
                    No.

                                  NOAH
                    Well you re young. You ve got 
                    plenty of time. 

      Alison nods but doesn t respond. An awkward silence sets in. 
      They both smoke. 

                                  ALISON
                    Can I ask you a question? It may be 
                    kinda rude?

                                  NOAH
                    Go ahead.

                                  ALISON
                    Why d you have four?

                                  NOAH
                    Kids?

      She nods. Noah smiles.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    I used to have a good answer for it 
                    actually. It was something about 
                    wanting to populate the earth with 
                      reasonable people so the 
                      extremists, with their enormous 
                    families, didn t take over.

                                  ALISON
                    You had four children for political 
                    reasons?

                                  NOAH
                    I was in grad school. It seemed 
                    like a good idea at the time.

                                  ALISON
                    And now?                                                                                    66.


                                  NOAH
                      I couldn t imagine my life without 
                    each one of them. They really are 
                    the best things that ever happened 
                    to me. I know everyone says that, 
                    but it s true.

      More silence. They don t look at each other. But there s some 
      kind of heat building between their bodies. 

                                  ALISON S VOICE
                    I didn t like getting close to new 
                    people back then. I didn t want to 
                    have to explain to anyone else what 
                    had happened. 

      She lays back against the sand with a sigh. A moment. Then he 
      lies back as well. They look up at the stars.

                                  NOAH
                    It s such a beautiful night.

                                  ALISON
                    Yeah, it is.


                    I feel like doing something crazy.

                                  ALISON
                    Like what?

                                  NOAH
                    You want to go for a midnight swim?

      Alison feels suddenly sick. 

                                  ALISON
                    No, I... I don t.

      She sits up.

                                  NOAH
                    I m sorry, that was stupid - 

                                  ALISON
                    It s okay.

                                  NOAH
                    I didn t mean to suggest anything 
                      inappropriate. I just thought it 
                    might be refreshing to, you know, 
                    get wet.

      He cringes.                                                                                    67.


                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    That didn t come out right either.

      Alison can t help it. She smiles. Then she stands up. 

                                  ALISON
                    It was nice bumping into you.

                                  NOAH
                    Can I at least walk you home?  


      EXT. ALISON S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT.

      Alison and Noah turn up the pebbled driveway that leads to 
      her house.

                                  NOAH
                    Wow. This is where you live? This 
                    place is great.

                                  ALISON
                    Thanks. 

                                  NOAH
                    When did you buy it?

                                  ALISON
                    My parents built it actually. It 
                    was their summer home.  

      Noah spots the outdoor shower adjacent to the side of the 
      house.

                                  NOAH
                    Is that an outdoor shower?

                                  ALISON
                    Yeah.

                                  NOAH
                    Oh man, I ve always wanted one of 
                    those.

                                  ALISON
                    Want to try it?


      EXT. OUTDOOR SHOWER - NIGHT. 

      Alison shows Noah the little wooden stall.

                                  NOAH
                    This is my idea of happiness.                                                                                    68.


                                  ALISON
                    Go ahead. Get wet.

      Noah grins.

                                  NOAH
                    No. I should go home.

      He turns to look at her. Stare at her, more accurately. She 
      smiles up at him. She doesn t mean to. It just keeps 
      happening.

                                  ALISON S VOICE
                    But he didn t feel like a new 
                    person. He felt like someone I had 
                    known a long time ago. And then 
                    lost track of.

                                  ALISON
                    Okay. Well, thanks for the walk.

      She puts out her hand to shake. He ignores it, moves in and 
      KISSES her on the cheek.

                                  NOAH
                    I guess I ll see you around town?

                                  ALISON
                    There s no real way to avoid it.

      Noah nods and heads up the driveway.

      Alison takes a deep breath, trying to calm her heartbeat. 
      Then she steps into the shower, turns on the hot water and 
      takes off her clothes.


      EXT. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Alison exits the shower, wrapped in her towel just as Cole is 
      turning up the driveway, accompanied by a stunningly 
      beautiful, younger girl. They re both carrying boards. This 
      is his employee JOLENE, 25.

                                  COLE
                    Hey.

                                  ALISON
                    Hey. Hi Jolene.

                                  JOLENE
                    Oh my God, Alison. Cole told me 
                    what day it was and I just want to 
                    say, I am so sorry.                                                                                    69.


      Alison glares at Cole.

                                  COLE
                    What? Is it a secret?

                                  JOLENE
                    Did I say something wrong?

                                  COLE
                    No, Jo. You didn t. I ll see you 
                    tomorrow?

                                  JOLENE
                    Okay. Goodnight Alison.

                                  ALISON
                          (as pleasantly as she can)
                      Goodnight.

      Jolene heads off down the street. Cole walks slowly towards 
      Alison.

                                  COLE
                    She was just trying to be nice.

                                  ALISON
                    Fuck her if you want to. I don t 
                    care. Just don t make me watch.

      He stares at her in disbelief. Then he turns, PUNCHES a dent 
      in the hood of his truck.

      She JUMPS.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    Cole! Don t do that!

                                  COLE
                    Why not?!

                                  ALISON
                    Because you re scaring me!

                                  COLE
                    I m scaring you? I m scaring you??? 
                    I did everything you wanted. I read 
                    all the books. We went to the 
                      counselor. We went to the priest. I 
                    took you to that fucking shaman in 
                      Patagonia. I m trying, Alison.

                                  ALISON
                    I know.                                                                                    70.


                                  COLE
                    I wake up every day with his face 
                    in my head too. You re not the only 
                    one who lost a child. 

                                  ALISON
                    I know.

                                  COLE
                    How much longer are you going to 
                    treat me like I m the one who 
                    killed him? 

                                  ALISON
                          (stunned)
                    I don t.

                                  COLE
                    Yes you do. 

      A long pause. Then Alison goes over to him. She leans into 
      him. 

                                  ALISON
                    I m sorry.

      Cole doesn t respond.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    It hurts.

      Cole melts. He wraps his arms around her.

                                  COLE
                    I know it does, baby.

                                  ALISON
                    Make it stop.

                                  COLE
                    I don t know how.

      Alison reaches up and kisses Cole. He kisses her back, 
      gently. She kisses him harder. Hungry. Her hands move down 
      his body, into his trunks. He puts his fingers in her hair 
      and pulls her towards him gently, whispering in her ear -

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    Let s go inside.

                                  ALISON
                    No.                                                                                    71.


      Alison puts both hands on Cole s chest and SHOVES him away 
      suddenly. He looks at her, confused. He reaches for her. She 
      SLAPS his hand.

      They stare at each other. Breathing hard.

      In one swift movement, Cole grabs Alison by both shoulders, 
      turns her around and pushes her against the hood of his car. 
      He bends her over onto her stomach, rips off her towel, and 
      enters her from behind.

                                  COLE
                    Is this what you wanted?

                                  ALISON
                    Yes.

      As Cole fucks her, Alison rests her head on the cold metal of 
      the car hood and looks out into the darkness. As usual, she 
      feels nothing.

      Suddenly, she GASPS.

      There, in the shadows, on the other side of the street, she 
      sees Noah. Watching. 

      His eyes bore into hers. He s not looking away. He s not 
      ashamed. He s just standing there, watching her with another 
      man. 

      As if it s all for him.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                            (whispering)
                    Harder.

      Cole pounds into her harder. Noah doesn t break his gaze. 
      Alison has never done anything like this before. She s 
      terrified, but also, incredibly turned on. She FEELS 
      something start to build -

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    Harder.

      Cole grabs her hips and slams himself into her. She closes 
      her eyes and lets the sensation overwhelm her. They come at 
      the same time.

      It s the first orgasm she s had in a year.

      Cole falls on top of her.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    Oh my God.                                                                                    72.


                                  COLE
                    Did you just - ?

                                  ALISON
                    Yeah. 

      Alison opens her eyes and looks out into the darkness. 

      Noah is gone.


      INT. POLICE OFFICE - DAY,

      Alison sits in the interrogation room. She looks radically 
      different. She s wearing a business suit. Her wild hair is 
      pulled tightly back and clipped into a neat bun. There s a 
      briefcase on the floor next to her. She s older too, though, 
      like Noah, it s difficult to tell how much. 

      She s staring off at the wall...

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    Ms. Bailey?

      Alison turns and looks at him.

                                  POLICE OFFICER (CONT D)
                          (gently)
                    It s almost three o clock. You said 
                    you had to pick up your kid at 
                    three.

      Alison looks at her watch.

                                  ALISON
                    Oh God, thank you. Can I go then?

      The officer nods.

                                    OFFICER
                    You can go.

      Alison gathers her things and leaves.
