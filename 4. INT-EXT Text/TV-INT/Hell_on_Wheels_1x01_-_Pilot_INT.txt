      In the gray morning light, you can make out the form of a 
      UNION SOLDIER sitting on the edge of the bed, pulling on his 
        boots.  

        A nearly empty bottle of rye whiskey stands on the night 
        table.

      The soldier stands.  Buttons his coat. Bloodshot eyes clouded 
      by whiskey.  

        A WHORE watches idly from the bed, her head propped on her 
      hand.  The hint of a smile.  The soldier looks ashamed as he 
        staggers out of the room.


      A FEW WOMEN, dressed in heavy black dresses and bonnets -- 
      war widows -- light votivesnear the altar.  

                                      SOLDIER S VOICE
                      It s the war. It weighs heavy on my 
                      mind, father.

        A large wooden crucifix hangs above the altar.  


      The soldier sits slumped in the confessional, his head buried 
      in his hands.                                                                                        2.


                                    SOLDIER
                      The things I seen...andthe things 
                      I done...

      The PRIEST -- seen only in silhouette -- speaks from the 
      other side of the screen, his voice barely above a whisper.

                                    PRIEST S VOICE
                      Unburden yourself, my son.

                                    SOLDIER
                      I m ashamed.

                                    PRIEST S VOICE
                      Give your burden to Jesus.  He 
                      wants it.  He demands it.

        A long gathering beat, then...

                                    SOLDIER
                      I was with General Sherman on his 
                      march South.  What we did... evil, 
                      unspeakable things...

                                    PRIEST S VOICE
                      You were a soldier.  You were 
                      following orders.

      The soldier shakes his head.

                                    SOLDIER
                      No, no.  Not just orders.  We 
                      opened a dark door and the devil 
                      stepped in.

                                    PRIEST S VOICE
                      Only way to cast out the devil is 
                    to confess to God.

                                    SOLDIER
                      No... No, I can t, Father. 

        Soldier stands up to leave.

                                    PRIEST S VOICE
                      Tell me about Meridian.

        Soldier s eyes widen. He goes to screen. Tries to get a look 
      at the priest.

                                    SOLDIER
                      How do you know about Meridian?

        Soldier s hand goes to his gun, but...                                                                                        3.


        Screen opens.  A .36 caliber Griswoldand Gunnison 
        Confederate six shooter appears in the opening.  It 
        discharges with a concussive bang, shooting the soldier right 
        between the eyes.

      The soldier falls back through the confessional door.

      And now we see the  priest  on the other side.  CULLEN 
        BOHANNON.  30 s.  Shock of shoulder length blonde hair.  He 
      wears a gray, Confederate great coat.   

      He stands there like some blue-eyed wraith.  Haunted.  
        Haunting.  The war is not over for this man. Not by a long 
      shot.  He exits the confessional.

      He walks calmly away from the confessional.  Even stride.  No 
        hurry.

      One woman makes eye contact with him.  And what she sees in 
      those eyes truly disturbs her.  She averts her gaze.

        Cullen leaves the cathedral.

        OMIT55


        Thomas  Doc  Durant addressing a group of well-dressed 
        gentlemen.  Snifters of brandy.  The air heavy with cigar 
        smoke.  The proverbial  smoke-filled  room.

      He paces back and forth in front of a proposed map of the 
      Union Pacific Railroad.

                                    DURANT 
                    In conclusion, this 
                        transcontinental railroad, this 
                      ribbon of iron, this glorious road 
                      from sea to shining sea represents 
                      nothing less than our destiny as a 
                      nation.  A nation which nearly 
                      destroyed itself by war between 
                      North and South can only be healed 
                    by the binding of the East and 
                      West.  Mark my words, gentlemen.  
                    It will be built.  Yes, it is still 
                      a dream, but it is a dream 
                        ineluctable. 

        Durant has them in his grasp.  His eyes roam the room.

                                    DURANT (CONT D)
                      For what was the Great Pyramid of 
                      Giza but a dream before Khufuhad 
                      the audacity to build it?  And what 
                    of the Acropolis?  The Great Wall 
                    of China?  All built by men of 
                      vision.  Just as this epic road 
                      will be built by men of vision.  
                      The only question that remains, 
                      gentlemen, is which of you will 
                      join me in this mad, noble quest?  
                      Who among you in years hence will 
                      say that they stood idly by as this 
                      nation became an empire and who 
                      will say that they lent a hand in 
                      making manifest our destiny as a 
                      great nation!    

      The audience breaks into spontaneous applause.   Durant 
        smiles like a conquering hero.  He makes eye contact with a 
      MAN in the audience...

        SENATOR JORDAN CRANE.  A white-haired patrician with an 
        aristocratic air.  He applauds enthusiastically.                                                                                      5.


                                    DURANT S VOICE (V.O.)
                      It s all horse shit.  The faster I 
                      shovel, the faster they eat it up.  


        Everybody gone but Durant and Crane.

                                    CRANE
                      But it was a truly inspirational 
                      speech.

                                    DURANT
                      Twaddle and shiteI say. 

                                    CRANE
                      Then why am I here?

                                    DURANT
                      You re here to play your part.

        Durant slides a stock certificate across the table.  The name 
      of the company on the stock is Credit Mobilier.

                                    CRANE
                      Credit Mobilier?  

                                    DURANT
                      It s a construction company I m 
                      starting up.  Credit Mobilierwill 
                    be awarded all major construction 
                      contracts for the Union Pacific 
                      Railroad.
                            (beat)
                      I own it.  And I m giving you a 
                      chance to get in on the ground 
                      floor.

                                    CRANE
                      So, you ll be paying yourself to 
                      build the railroad with government 
                      subsidies?

                                    DURANT
                      Now that, my friend, is 
                        inspirational.

                                    CRANE
                      Yes it is. But I can t afford these 
                    on a senator s salary.

                                    DURANT
                      Payment comes in many forms, 
                      Jordan.  
                                    (MORE)                                                                                      6.

                                    DURANT (CONT'D)
                      And as head of the Congressional 
                      Oversight Committee on Railroads, I 
                      think you will find a way to pay 
                      for them over and over again.

                                    CRANE
                      Might I ask, how many shares are 
                      here?

                                    DURANT
                        Two-hundred.  I think you ll find 
                      that more than fair.

                                    CRANE
                        Four-hundred sounds  fairer. 

                                    DURANT
                      You want to re-negotiate a bribe?

                                    CRANE
                      Bribe s such a dirty word.
                            (beat)
                      Why don t you think on it, Doc.  
                      We ve got a vote before committee 
                      next Tuesday.

      He gets up.  Starts for the door.  Leaving the stocks on the 
        table.

                                    DURANT
                      Good luck with your land 
                      speculation in Nebraska.

      Crane stops at the door. Durant leans back in his seat.

                                    DURANT (CONT D)
                        Fifty-thousand acres bought on the 
                      cheap. And oddly enough it sits 
                      smack dab in the middle of my 
                      proposed route.   

      Crane stands there, hat in hand.

                                    DURANT (CONT D)
                      What would happen to the value of 
                      that land if I decided to route the 
                      railroad around it?

      Crane says nothing; it s clear this is not something he wants 
      to happen.  

                                    DURANT (CONT D)
                      Take the stocks, Jordan.                                                                                        7.


      Crane shuffles over to take the stack of stock certificates. 
        Durant brings his hand down on them.  

                                    DURANT (CONT D)
                      But I ve decided to re-negotiate.  
                      A hundred shares. 

      Check mate.  Durant smiles up at the defeated Crane.

      The train clatters and lurches along. It is a bumpy, 
        uncomfortable ride, especially in the third class car.

        Pamphlets in evidence: advertising workers needed to build 
      the Union Pacific Railroad.

        Cullen sits in one of the seats.  Hat pulled low, he is 
        drifting off to sleep.  Clean shaven.  Hair shorn.  

        Seated across from Cullen are two men dressed in comically 
        threadbare suits.

      Irish brothers MICKEY and SEAN MCGINNES. They are hunkered 
      down over the newspaper, struggling with the words.  

                                    MICKEY
                            (slowly and barely 
                              literate)

                                    SEAN
                      Prayed...

      They speak with a rustic, sing-song lilt.

                                    MICKEY
                            (indignant)
                      I was gettin it.  

        Cullen stirs.  Eyes the brothers from under his hat.                                                                                      8.

                                    SEAN
                      Conference.

                                    MICKEY
                      Prayed in the conference?

      They are stumped.

                                    CULLEN (O.S.)
                        Confessional.

        Mickey and Sean look up at Cullen. They are momentarily taken 
      aback by that look in his eyes.

                                    SEAN
                      Someone killed the poor beggar 
                      whilst he was confessin ?

                                    MICKEY
                      What is the world comin to?

                                    SEAN
                      I suppose the only consolation is 
                      that he got to heaven that much 
                      faster. 

        Cullen tips his hat back.  Sits up straight.

                                    CULLEN
                      And how do you come by that 
                      conclusion?    

                                    SEAN
                    He confessed his sins.  He died in 
                      Grace.

                                    CULLEN
                    So God just punches his ticket to 
                      heaven?  

      Sean and Mickey look at one another.

                                    MICKEY
                      Well yeah.                                                                                      9.


                                    CULLEN
                    If that s how God goes about his 
                      business, then you can keep him. 

        Mickey and Sean look shocked.

                                    SEAN
                      Keep God?

                                    MICKEY
                    Do you not believe in a higher 
                      power?

                                    CULLEN
                      Yes.  I wear it on my hip.

      They follow his eyes down to the holsteredsix shooter.  
      Their eyes widen.

                                    SEAN
                      Are you a gunslinger, then?

                                    CULLEN
                      No. I m just heading west to look 
                      for work on the railroad.

                                    MICKEY
                    So are we.

                                    SEAN
                    To seek our fortunes as it were.

                                    MICKEY
                    We have a plan.

        Mickey nods towards the suitcase between him and his brother 
      on the seat.

                                    MICKEY (CONT D)
                      I m Mickey, this here s Sean.

                                    CULLEN
                      Cullen Bohannon.

        Mickey and Sean take turns shaking with Cullen.

                                    SEAN
                      Mickey has twelve toes.

                                    MICKEY
                      And Sean but eight.

                                    SEAN
                        Individually, we re freaks.                                                                                      10.


                                    MICKEY
                      But together we re whole.

        Cullen looks at the brothers McGinnes, not quite sure what to 
      make of them.

        EXTREME TELEPHOTO SHOT1616

        A cloud of dust and smoke hangs over the desolate, heat-
        warped landscape.

        Ant-size FIGURES laying railroad track.  Far-off RHYTHMIC 
        CLINK, CLINK, CLINK of spikes being driven.

        A DISTANT POP! followedby a puff of black smoke.  BLACK 
        POWDER exploding.

        A train pulls into the distant scene.  Smoke belching.

        DANIEL JOHNSON sits at a small campaign desk, writing in a 
        ledger. Johnson is a wiry, tough-as-nails son-of-a-bitch. He 
      has a hook for a right hand.  He is soaked with sweat.  Flies 
      buzz all around him.  

                                    JOHNSON
                      Next!

        Cullen enters the tent.  Johnson doesn t look up from his 
        ledger.  

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      Name.

                                    CULLEN
                      Cullen Bohannon.                                                                                      13.


                                    JOHNSON
                      Railroad experience?

                                    CULLEN
                      None.

                                    JOHNSON
                      Why should I hire you?

                                    CULLEN
                      I m willing to do just about 
                      anything.

                                    JOHNSON
                      You and a thousand others.

        Johnson looks up.  

                                    CULLEN
                      I ve got no place else to go, Mr. 
                      Johnson.

                                    JOHNSON
                      Save the sob stories.  Will you 
                      work a cut crew?

                                    CULLEN
                      Yes.
                            (beat)
                      What s a cut crew?

                                    JOHNSON
                      It s not for the faint of heart, I 
                      can tell you that, Mr. Bohannon.  
                      It s brutal work.  Gets hotter than 
                        a whorehouse on nickel night out 
                      there.  

                                    CULLEN
                      I ve never been afraid of hard 
                      work.

                                    JOHNSON
                      You re a Johnny Reb, aren t you?

                                    CULLEN
                      Yes sir.

                                    JOHNSON
                      I could tell by that Griswold
                      you re carrying there.

        Johnson nods towards Cullen s gun.                                                                                      14.


                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                    It was a Griswoldlike that took my 
                      hand off.

        Cullen says nothing.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      We ve all paid a price, Mr. 
                      Bohannon.  I m sure you have your 
                      own scars.  

        Johnson contemplates his hook.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      I was a Copperhead before the war.  
                      I got no hard feelings towards you 
                      gray backs.   You did what you had 
                    to do.
                            (beat)
                      It s the darkiesI blame.  I sure 
                    as hell didn t give a shitabout 
                      fighting for their freedom but I 
                      didn t have a choice.  Way I see 
                      it, they owe me a hand.

        Johnson rubs his chin with his hook.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      Did you own slaves, Mr. Bohannon?

                                    CULLEN
                      I did.

                                    JOHNSON
                      Then I guess you know your way 
                      around a nigger.


      The big tent has a wooden floor and oil lamps.  Nothing fancy 
      here.  Cheap, strong whiskey for men wanting to get drunk 
      fast. 

        Cullen sits with Johnson and FIVE OTHER MEN sit at a table in 
      the corner.  A bottle of whiskey stands in the middle of the 
        table.  

                                    WALKING BOSS TWO
                      So, how many slaves did you own?

                                    CULLEN
                      Five in all.  I owned a small 
                      tobacco farm.

                                    JOHNSON
                      Any women?

                                    CULLEN
                      Two.

                                    WALKING BOSS TWO
                      Did you sample the goods?

                                    CULLEN
                      No.  It wasn t like that.

                                    WALKING BOSS ONE
                      Are you bitter that you had to give 
                    up your slaves?

                                    CULLEN
                      I gave them their freedom a year 
                      before the war started.                                                                                        21.


                                    JOHNSON
                      Are you serious?

                                    CULLEN
                      I kept them on at wages.  

                                    JOHNSON
                      You re an odd duck, Bohannon.

                                    CULLEN
                      I married a Northerner.  She 
                      convinced me of the evils of 
                      slavery.  

                                    JOHNSON
                      You gave up your slaves and you 
                      still fought in the war?

                                    CULLEN
                      That s right.

                                    JOHNSON
                      Why?!

                                    CULLEN
                      Honor.

                                    JOHNSON
                      You southerners and your honor!

        Johnson fills Cullen s glass.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      So, where is your wife?

                                    CULLEN
                      She s dead.  

                                    JOHNSON
                      Did the war take her?

                                    CULLEN
                    In a manner of speaking.


        A shaky hand pours a glass of whiskey.  The hand belongs to 
        Johnson.  He drinks the whiskey down in one gulp.  Breakfast 
      of champions.

        Cullen is asleep in his chair from the night before.

      In the background, the bartender drags a drunk to the back of *
      the tent and tosses him out.*

                                    JOHNSON
                      Rise and shine, Bohannon.  

        Cullen stirs.  

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      It s another beautiful day on the 
                      railroad.


      An opulently appointed private car replete with Persian rugs 
      and ostentatious empire style furniture.  The train clatters 
        along.

        Durant is bent over a desk, looking at a survey map.  He is 
        flanked by TWO ENGINEERS.  

                                    ENGINEER ONE
                    As you can see, we ve made 
                      wonderful progress through the 
                      prairie.

                                    ENGINEER TWO
                      We ve already built fifty miles of 
                      usable road.  

        Durant looks at the map with a furrowed brow.

      CLOSE ON THE MAP -- Durant traces the course of the track 
      with his index finger.  It is basically a straight line, 
        heading west from Council Bluffs, Iowa.                                                                                      23.


                                    DURANT
                      Why have you made my road so...
                            (looking for the word)
                        ...straight?

      The engineers look at one another.

                                    ENGINEER TWO
                    We took the quickest route.

                                    DURANT
                      Why?

      The engineers are completely confused.

                                    ENGINEER ONE
                      Aren t we in a race with the 
                      Central Pacific?

      This elicits a laugh from Durant.

                                    DURANT
                      The Central Pacific?  Those 
                      imbeciles will never even make it 
                      out of Sacramento.  I hear they re 
                    so desperate they re hiring chinks.

        Durant returns to the map.  

                                    DURANT (CONT'D)
                      I was thinking of something more 
                      like this.

        Durant traces a meandering, serpentine route over the 
        straight route.

                                    ENGINEER ONE
                      But we re building over flat land.  
                      Why wouldn t we make it straight?

                                    DURANT 
                      Why wouldn t we make it straight he 
                      asks.  

        Durant chuckles.  

                                    DURANT (CONT'D)
                      Take a closer look. 

      When the engineer bends in closer, Durant pushes the man s 
      face into the map hard.  The engineer struggles to get free 
      but Durant is too strong.                                                                                      24.


                                    DURANT (CONT'D)
                      Let me elucidate.

        Durant gestures broadly over the map with his free hand.    

                                    DURANT (CONT'D)
                    In case you hadn t heard, this 
                      undertaking is being subsidized by 
                      the enormous teat of the Federal 
                      Government.  This never-ending, 
                        money-gushing nipple pays me 
                      sixteen hundred dollars a mile yet 
                      you build my road straight? 

        Durant lifts the engineer s head.  A thread of blood trickles 
      from the man s nose.

                                    DURANT (CONT D)
                      You re fired.  Get out.

      He hesitates.

                                    DURANT (CONT D)
                      I said get out!  

      The engineer walks over to the door and opens it. They are in 
      the middle of nowhere. 

                                    ENGINEER ONE
                      But we re fifty miles from the next 
                      station.

                                    DURANT
                      Then you d better walk in a 
                      straight line.

      The engineer looks back at Durant one last time.  The train 
      isn t moving that fast, but still.   

                                    DURANT (CONT'D)
                      Go!

      The man jumps from the train.  The door flaps in the breeze.  
        Durant turns to the other engineer and smiles.

                                    DURANT (CONT'D)
                      You look like a bright fellow. 


        Robert and Lily are making love.  Lily is on top of Robert.  
      Their bodies glisten with sweat.  Lily MOANS.  

                                    ROBERT
                      Shh.  The others.

      She MOANS again.  Robert puts his hand over her mouth. Lily 
      bites down on his hand.  Lily moves on top of Robert, her 
        muffled moans barely audible.

      Now it s Robert s turn to moan.  Lily s hand shoots to his 
        mouth.  They come to a climax, their moans muffled by the 
        other s hand.

      Lily rolls off of Robert and lies next to him.  

                                    ROBERT (CONT D)
                    Do you think they heard us?

                                    LILY
                      Who cares?                                                                                        27.


                                    ROBERT
                      I don t want to torment the poor 
                      bastards.  Out here alone in the 
                      middle of nowhere.

                                    LILY
                      They have their hands.

        Robert can t help but laugh.  But the laugh turns into a 
        coughing spasm.  It is a horrible, racking cough with no end.

      Lily rushes over to a little medical bag.  She takes out a 
        bottle of laudanum.  She spoons some into his mouth but it 
      has little effect.

      Lily holds Robert in her arms until the coughing abates.

                                    ROBERT
                      I fear this cough is going to be 
                      the end of me.

                                    LILY
                      Nonsense.

                                    ROBERT
                      Lily, if I were to die--

                                    LILY
                      Please stop talking like that.

      He starts to talk, but she kisses him on the lips, silencing 
      him.  Lily rocks Robert in her arms.  She starts singing 
        Greensleeves...

                                    LILY (CONT D)
                      Alas, my love, you do me wrong to 
                      cast me off discourteously...

        Lily s clear, strong voice carries over to...

        ...the outside of the tent.  Their silhouettes can be seen 
        through the canvas.  That full moon hangs ominously.


        A crowded five man tent.  The men are bunking down for the 
        night.  

        Cullen enters the tent.  Walks over to Elam, who is...

        ...sharpening a Bowie knife with a twelve inch blade on a 
        whetstone.  He slides the blade along the stone over and 
      over.  *

                                    CULLEN
                      How s William?

      Elam gestures over at a bunk in the corner -- William s body 
        covered by a sheet.

      Elam is totally stoic.  Betrays no emotion.

                                    CULLEN (CONT D)
                      What are you planning on doing with 
                      that Arkansas toothpick?

      Elam doesn t answer.  The only sound is the knife on the 
        stone.  

                                    CULLEN (CONT D)
                      Don t do it.  *

                                    ELAM*
                    We ain t on the plantation no more, *
                      walking boss.*

      The knife continues, slow and menacing.*

                                    CULLEN*
                      You kill him, you ll hang.*

      The blade suddenly stops.*

                                    ELAM*
                      How they gonnahang me if there *
                      ain t no witnesses?*

      Elam tests the blade with his thumb.  It creates a metallic *
        ting.Elam looks up at Cullen.  Cullen returns Elam s stare, *
      not giving an inch.*

      Elam smiles, releasing the tension.  Goes back to sharpening.*

                                    CULLEN*
                      You ve got to let the past go.                                                                                      33.


        Cullen starts away.

                                    ELAM 
                      Have you let it go? *

      CLOSE ON CULLEN -- he hesitates for just a second, then moves 
      on, never looking back.  


        THIRTY IRISHMEN crammed into the tent, sitting on the dirt 
        floor, watching images projected from a magic lantern.  

      The images consist of colorized sepia photographs and painted 
        images of Ireland.  

      Sean works the lantern, handfeeding the strips of images 
        through the gate.  He sees Cullen enter and waves him over.  

      They speak in hushed whispers.  

                                    CULLEN
                      You re doing quite a trade.

                                    SEAN
                      Not bad for a coupla Irish 
                      bumpkins.

                                    CULLEN
                      Where s Mickey?

      Sean nods towards Mickey, who stands near the screen.

                                    SEAN
                      He s preparin for the grand 
                      finale.

        Cullen watches the images of Ireland.  Sean watches Cullen.

                                    SEAN (CONT D)
                    Do you not pine for your own 
                      homeland, Mr. Bohannon?                                                                                      34.


                                    CULLEN
                      No.*

                                    SEAN*
                      And why is that?*

                                    CULLEN*
                      It s gone.  *

      An image of an old Irish woman appears on screen.  Right on 
      cue, Mickey starts singing ThaCaileagA'st-Earrach, a 
        traditional Gaelic ballad.  He sings in a clear, strong 
        tenor.  

      More images of Ireland interspersed with images of mothers 
      with their children.

      Some of the men start crying.  The haunting ballad continues.  

      An image of a family dressed in mourning weeds, standing over 
        a grave appears on screen.  The ballad swells to a crescendo.

      There isn t a dry eye in the house.  

        Cullen watches in amazement as the tough-as-nails railroad 
        workers blubber like babies.

                                    SEAN
                       Tis stronger than whiskey.
                            (beat)
                      But we sell that too.  

      Sean winks at Cullen.


        Robert and Lily are awake, dressed for the day.  Suddenly 
      they hear SCREAMS and sounds of the attack from outside their 
      tent.

        Robert opens the tent flap.  Peers out...

      The braves attacking.  Some go into the tents.    

        Another spears a man as he tries to raise his pistol and 
        shoot.  The pistol discharges as he is run through by the 
      long spear.

        Another surveyor attacked with a war club.  Arrows being 
      fired in rapid succession.

      The braves beautifully efficient in their murderous assault.

        Robert is stuffing maps and notebooks into a satchel.

                                    LILY
                      What are you doing?

                                    ROBERT
                    We have to save our work!

      Lily waits anxiously at the entrance. 

        Pawnee Killer dismounts, starts touching the victims with his 
      coup stick.  

      Some of the Cheyenne braves start disfiguring the bodies and 
        taking scalps.

                                    LILY
                      Robert, come on!  We have to go!                                                                                      36.



        Cullen and Johnson sit in a secluded corner in the nearly 
      empty saloon.  There is an empty bottle of whiskey on the 
        table.  

                                    JOHNSON
                      Tell me, Mister Bohannon.  Did you 
                      see the elephant during the war?

                                    CULLEN
                      I saw my share of action.

                                    JOHNSON
                      Where?

                                    CULLEN
                      I don t really like to talk about 
                      it.                                                                                       38.


                                    JOHNSON
                      I loved the war.  It was the best 
                      thing that ever happened to me.

                                    CULLEN
                      I thought you said you were against 
                      it.

                                    JOHNSON
                      I was.  But that doesn t mean I 
                      didn t enjoy myself once I was 
                      pressed into service.  

        Cullen signals for the bartender to bring over another bottle 
      of whiskey.  

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      I m skint.

                                    CULLEN
                      This one s on me.

      The bartender puts the bottle down.  Cullen pours two tall 
      ones.

                                    JOHNSON
                      Some men shrink when they see the 
                      elephant up close.  Not me.  I 
                      blossomed.

        Johnson downs the whiskey in three big gulps.  He just 
        doesn t seem to get drunk.

        Cullen pours Johnson and himself another.  Johnson takes 
        another, smaller drink.  Suddenly reflective.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      I will admit, though, there were 
                      times I crossed lines... moral 
                      lines... I didn t think myself 
                      capable of crossing.
                            (looks at Cullen)
                      But that s what men do in war.

      He knocks back rest of his drink. 

      Under the table, Cullen pours out his whiskey.  There is a 
      large puddle of whiskey there.

                                    CULLEN
                      Moral men don t.

      This stops Johnson.  He looks over his glass at Cullen.  
        Intense look exchanged between them.                                                                                      39.


                                    JOHNSON
                      So, you did nothing that you were 
                      ashamed of?

                                    CULLEN
                      Oh, I did plenty I was ashamed of.  *

        Another tense pause.

                                    CULLEN (CONT D)
                      Were you ever in Meridian, 
                        Mississippi, Mr. Johnson?

        Johnson says nothing.  Cullen s hand goes to his Griswold. 
      Then, a CLICK! fromunder the table.

                                    JOHNSON
                      That s my Colt pointed at your gut, 
                      Bohanon.  

      Under the table.  Johnson s pistol pointed at Cullen.  
        Cullen s hand remains on his pistol grip.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      I don t want to kill you here, but 
                      I will if I have to.

        Cullen s removes his hand.

                                    JOHNSON (CONT D)
                      Let s take a walk.


        Durant sits in an opulently furnished Pullman car.  He is 
        drunk.  His little black eyes are hooded and unfocused.  He 
      sips brandy from a cut crystal tumbler.  

        Durant s eyes focus as he addresses someone off screen.

                                    DURANT
                    Is it a villain you want?

        Durant nods.  Holds up his glass.

                                    DURANT (CONT D)
                      I ll play the part.  After all, 
                      what is a drama without a villain?  
                      And what is the building of this 
                      grand road if not a drama? 
                      Gentlemen, this business is not for 
                      the weak of heart.  

        Durant takes another drink of brandy.  


        Durant s eyes dart back and forth at his audience.

                                    DURANT
                      History doesn t remember us fondly 
                      but history is written by the 
                      zebras for the zebras.  One hundred 
                      years hence, when this railroad 
                      spans the continent, and America 
                      rises to become a power like no 
                      other the world has seen, I shall 
                    be remembered as a caitiff and a 
                      malefactor who operated only out of 
                      greed for personal gain.
                            (beat)
                      All true.  All true.  

        Durant wags his index finger.  

                                    DURANT (CONT'D)
                      But remember this: Without me and 
                      men like me, your glorious railroad 
                      would never be built.

        Durant slumps in his chair like some drunken panjandrum.  And 
      now it is revealed that except for Durant, the Pullman car is 
        completely empty.  He is totally alone.
