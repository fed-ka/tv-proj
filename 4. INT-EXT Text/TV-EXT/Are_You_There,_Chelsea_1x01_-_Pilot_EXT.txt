                really wakes you up.  I m making some 

                big changes.

                                  SHONIQUA

                Oh my God.  You re going to quit 

                  drinking?

                                    CHELSEA

                Better. (PROUDLY)  I am going to get 

                an apartment walking distance to work.

                                  MARK

                Wow.  That s insane.

                                  SHONIQUA

                What are you talking about, Mark?  You 

                live walking distance to work.                                                                                       6.

  CHELSEA S BOSS, JERRY, 45-50, ENTERS.  HE IS AN IMPOSING FIGURE.  
  FOLLOWING HIM ARE TWO MEN CARRYING A LARGE BOX.

                                  JERRY

                (TO THE MEN)  Put it in the store 

                room.  Way in the back.  Behind the

  CHELSEA AND SHONIQUA SHARE A LOOK.

                                    CHELSEA (V.O.)

                Nobody knows if my boss Jerry is in 

                the mafia and nobody asks.  We do know 

                that he has secret meetings here at 

                night and that he can get seats behind 

                home plate at any Mets  game.

                                  JERRY

                (TO CHELSEA)  Hey, darlin .  Havin  a 

                good day?

                                    CHELSEA

                Yep.  But yesterday sucked.  I got a 

                D.U.I. and spent half the night in 

                Essex County Jail.

                                  JERRY

                Really?  Next time tell  em you work 

                for Jerry Ragusa and, if that doesn t 

                work, call me.                                                                                      7.

                There isn t going to be a next time.  

                I m getting an apartment walking 

                distance to work.

                                  JERRY

                You should just marry me.  Then you 

                wouldn t have to work at all.

                                    CHELSEA

                Thanks, Jerry.  If my life goes way 

                worse than I can even imagine in the 

                next ten years, that will definitely 

                be an option.

                                  JERRY

                  (Playfully)  How come you re so mean 

                to me?  Huh?

                You know I can t afford an apartment.

                                    CHELSEA

                What did I tell you the day we 

                  graduated from high school?

                                  IVORY

                That you thought you were pregnant.

                                    CHELSEA

                And that college was a waste of time.

                five?  All you need then is a wind 

                breaker and a couple pairs of stretch 

                pants from Talbots.  Plus, I have 

                  insurance.  I can marry Jerry.

                You must be Chelsea.  Ivory said you

  HE WALKS OFF TO ANSWER HIS CALL.

                Okay, this guy clearly has no idea how 

                  ridiculous he looks.  

                                  IVORY

                He s incredibly smart and funny, 

                Chelsea.  He went to Harvard.                                                                                    12.

                He should ve gone to clown college and 

                learned to pull fish out of his pants 

                like the good Lord intended.

                                  IVORY

                We get it.  You think he looks like a

                                    CHELSEA (V.O.)

                It occurred to me that I had judged 

                another human being based on his 

                  horrible, clown hair without even 

                  bothering to find out what he drinks. 

  CHELSEA S BODY LANGUAGE BECOMES MORE AND MORE INTERESTED.

                                    CHELSEA (V.O.)

                Maybe I was being shallow.  Obviously 

                it wasn t his fault he was a redhead.  

                It was his ancestors .  But why hadn t 

                he done anything about it?  I mean, 

                it s one thing if you have a hare-lip 

                or a club foot.  And yet, he was oddly 

                cute and the more I talked to him, the 

                more I admired him for having the 

                  confidence to walk around with a lid 

                like that.

                                    CHELSEA

                Two words.  You live with your 

                parents.

                                  IVORY

                That s five words.

                                    CHELSEA

                Five sad words.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                    15.


                                        SCENE D



  CHELSEA IS DELIVERING DRINKS TO A TABLE.  TODD WALKS BEHIND HER 
  WITH A PLATE OF WINGS.  

                                  CUSTOMER #1

                (TO TODD)  Hey Shorty, those are ours.

  TODD DROPS OFF THE WINGS AND EXITS.

                                    CHELSEA

                Did you just call my boyfriend Shorty? 

                                  CUSTOMER #1

                He s your boyfriend?

                                    CHELSEA

                Now that he quit cheating on me, yes.  

                And believe me, he s not short where 

                it counts.

  WITH THAT SHE HEADS BACK TO THE BAR.  JUST THEN HER FATHER, 
  MELVIN, ENTERS.  HE S 60, OVERWEIGHT, WEARS A TRACK SUIT, AIR 
  JORDANS AND SPORTS A BLUETOOTH. 

                                  MELVIN

                Hey, Sweety.  Where s your boss?  We 

                have some business to conduct.

                                    CHELSEA

                Dad, pull your pants up.

                                  MELVIN

                They re low riders.                                                                                    20.


                                    CHELSEA

                They re sweatpants.  Come on, pull  em 

                up under your nipples.   You re an old 

                guy.

  SHE PULLS UP MELVIN S PANTS.  MELVIN SPOTS JERRY TALLYING 
  RECEIPTS AT A NEARBY TABLE AND APPROACHES HIM.

                                  MELVIN

                There he is.  This is your lucky day, 

                Jerry.  I just got my hands on a 1986 

                Cadillac Seville.  Mint condition.  

                Perfect for a man of your stature.

  CHELSEA PUTS IN A FOOD ORDER DURING THE FOLLOWING:

                                    CHELSEA (V.O.)

                My Dad s never had a real job in his 

                life.  He gets money by buying and 

                selling old cars and lawn mowers and 

                other crap in the Penny Saver.  Jerry 

                lets him conduct his crazy business at 

                the bar, but only because he s hot for 

                me.  

  ANGLE ON: JERRY AND MELVIN.  

                                  JERRY

                Melvin, I m a wealthy man.  I wouldn t 

                have bought a 1986 Cadillac in 1987.

  JERRY HEADS TO HIS OFFICE.  

                                  MELVIN

                Ooh, mother nature just sent me a text 

                message.

  HE HEADS FOR THE FRONT DOOR.                                                                                    21.


                                    CHELSEA

                Don t pee in the alley, Dad.

                                  MELVIN

                  (SWEETLY)  Oh Honey, your mother would 

                never let me pee outside.  That s the 

                only thing that s better for me since 

                she passed on.  And nobody yaps during 

                football games.

                                    CHELSEA

                (CAVING)  All right, go.

  AS MELVIN EXITS HAPPILY:  

                                    CHELSEA

                Behind the dumpster.

  AND HE S OUT.  CHELSEA LANDS NEXT TO SHONIQUA AT THE DOOR.

                                  SHONIQUA

                Your Dad is so cute.

                                    CHELSEA

                He calls you Black Magic.

                                  SHONIQUA

                Yeah, but he s not a hater.  He s just 

                old school.

                                    CHELSEA

                He says he likes black people because 

                they make good employees and they can 

                run really fast.

                                  SHONIQUA

                Well, I would say thank you to that.                                                                                    22.


                                    CHELSEA

                Why are you such an idiot?

                                  SHONIQUA

                Because you re such a whore.

                                    CHELSEA

                Ooh, speaking of my whoriness, guess 

                who I m going out with tonight.

                                  SHONIQUA

                The guy you dry humped at the Chevron?

                                    CHELSEA

                No, but I wonder how he s doing.  His 

                mom has Crohn s disease.  I should 

                send a card.  (THEN)  I m going out 

                with Ivory s friend.

                                  SHONIQUA

                  I thought you said he looked like 

                Ronald McDonald.

                                    CHELSEA

                I did.  But it was so great talking to 

                him.  Don t get me wrong, looks have 

                and always will come first.  

                                  SHONIQUA

                Okay, but you realize he couldn t part 

                that big red  fro if he wanted to.  

                That should give you some idea of 

                what s going on downstairs.                                                                                    23.


                                    CHELSEA

                I was thinking the same thing.  Then I 

                thought, are you ready?   Does it 

                really matter? 

  SHONIQUA GASPS.

                                    CHELSEA

                It was just for a second, then I got 

                grossed out again.  But I did think 

                it.

                                  SHONIQUA

                  That s... so... mature.

                                    CHELSEA

                I know.  I feel like I m really 

                growing up since I got the D.U.I.  

                  (CHECKING THE CLOCK)  Ooh, quitting 

                time.  Mark, can I get a shot?

  MELVIN ENTERS AND SPOTS THE MINTS AT THE HOSTESS STAND.

                                  MELVIN

                (GOING FOR THE MINTS)  Ooh.

                                    CHELSEA

                  (STOPPING HIM)  Hey, hey, hey.  Go 

                wash your hands.

  HE ROLLS HIS EYES AND GOES TO THE MEN S ROOM. 

                                    CHELSEA

                And pull your pants up!

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                    24.


                                        SCENE H



  IT S A LIVELY FRIDAY NIGHT AT THE ULTIMATE SPORTS BAR AND GRILL.  
  THE PLACE IS JUMPING.  JERRY, MARK AND TODD ARE BEHIND THE BAR.  
  IVORY AND DUMB DUMB ARE SEATED ON STOOLS.  CAMERA FINDS CHELSEA, 
  IN TOP FORM, WORKING THE ROOM AS WE HEAR THE FOLLOWING:

                                    CHELSEA (V.O.)

                After my disastrous night with 

                Jonathan I felt like I needed to do 

                damage control, so I invited him down 

                to the bar and made sure I looked 

                extra cute.  I even wore the Fiesta 

                panties.  But before he showed up, 

                Ivory and I had to give Dumb Dumb a 

                little tutorial.

  CHELSEA APPROACHES IVORY AND DUMB DUMB WHO ARE AT THE BAR 
  PERCHED ABOVE TWO SHOT GLASSES.

                                  DUMB DUMB

                I m not going to drink that.  It 

                smells like oven cleaner.  

                                  IVORY

                Well it tastes like lemons, Dumb Dumb.  

                Just drink the whole thing really 

                fast.

  LOCKING EYES WITH IVORY, DUMB DUMB STICKS HER TONGUE IN THE 
  GLASS, PULLS IT OUT, THEN MAKES A FACE.

                                    CHELSEA

                It s okay.  Take your time.  We re 

                here for you.

  BIG RED ENTERS.                                                                                      45.


                                  IVORY

                Ooh, he s here.

                                    CHELSEA

                How do I look?

                                  IVORY

                You re hanging a little wall-eyed.

                                    CHELSEA

                Thanks. 

  CHELSEA ADJUSTS HER BREASTS AND HEADS OVER TO JONATHAN.

                                    CHELSEA (V.O.)

                Before I could even say hello, 

                Jonathan told me we needed to  talk.   

                I could tell by the look on his face 

                it wasn t going to go well.

                                  JONATHAN

                You know, things are going a little 

                too fast for me, Chelsea.

  AS HE CONTINUES TO TALK WE HEAR:

                                    CHELSEA (V.O.)

                It was crazy.  I didn t even want to 

                go out with him in the first place and 

                now he was acting like I wanted to 

                have his orange babies.  

                                    CHELSEA

                So you re dumping me?                                                                                    46.


                                  JONATHAN

                It s just, I have a lot of 

                  opportunities right now and I don t 

                want to be nailed down to one woman.

                                    CHELSEA

                Nail down?  I think you need to calm 

                down.

                                  JONATHAN

                Look, we re just really different 

                people.  I mean, I ve never gotten a 

                D.U.I. and my parents are pretty 

                normal.

                                    CHELSEA

                Are you saying my Dad s not normal?

                                  JONATHAN

                He talks about what a cute ass you 

                have.

                                    CHELSEA

                I do have a cute ass.  And as far as 

                the D.U.I., people make mistakes.

                                  JONATHAN

                Chelsea, you still drink all the time.

                                    CHELSEA

                Which is why I moved closer to work.  

                It s called responsibility!

                                  JONATHAN

                You know what?  I just realized I ve 

                got to be somewhere.                                                                                     47.


                                    CHELSEA

                You know what?  I just realized I no 

                longer feel comfortable in your two 

                dollar and thirty-nine cent 

                  underpants.  

  SHE SLIPS OFF HER PANTIES AND HANDS THEM TO HIM.

                                    CHELSEA

                Keep  em.  Because that s the closest 

                you ll ever get to my hot pocket 

                again.

  HE HEADS FOR THE DOOR.  A CUSTOMER APPROACHES CHELSEA.

                                  CUSTOMER #2

                Can you get me a vodka martini?

                                    CHELSEA

                Hold on a second, sir.  (THEN, CALLING 

                AFTER JONATHAN)  And you do need to 

                trim your huge, hairy, orange, man 

                bush!  Don t shoot the messenger!  (TO 

                  CUSTOMER)  Twist or olive?

                                    CHELSEA (V.O.)

                My grandmother always said it was 

                  physically impossible to dance and 

                feel bad at the same time.

  MORE AND MORE PEOPLE (INCLUDING OUR REGULARS) JOIN HER.

                And she was right.  I did feel better.  

                Then three things hit me 

                  simultaneously.  One, if a guy can t 

                hang with my people, he can t hang 

                with me.  Two, my people are so weird 

                and so great.  And, three, and perhaps 

                most important, I wasn t wearing 

                  underwear.

  SHE NOTICES A GROUP OF GUYS LOOKING UP AT HER IN THE RING.  AS 
  SHE CONFIDENTLY BUT CAREFULLY DANCES HER WAY BACK INTO THE 
  CROWD, WE:
