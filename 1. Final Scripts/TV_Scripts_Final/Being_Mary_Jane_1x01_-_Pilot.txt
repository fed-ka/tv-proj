      FADE IN:


      INT. MARY JANE S HOUSE - KITCHEN - WEE HOURS OF THE MORNING

      CU of two nine-inch baking pans filled with cake batter 
      inside of the oven.  We watch as the cake rises.

      CU of two oven mitts removing them from the oven.

      From the POV of inside the oven, we get glimpses of the woman 
      putting the cake pans aside and then removing her hands from 
      the oven mitts.  She s a BLACK WOMAN.

      After a beat, we hear KNOCKING and a DOORBELL RINGING.  She 
      moves out of frame and after a beat the KITCHEN LIGHTS CUT 
      OUT.  

      The only light is from the illuminated clock that reads:  
      2:07 AM.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. MARY JANE S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      We pick her up in the dark house.  We see hints of a gorgeous 
      home and we catch a glimpse of her amazing cheek bones and 
      the rag tied around her head.  Pan down to see a baseball bat 
      in her ring-free left hand.  She reaches her security monitor 
      but she can t discern who it is, HIS head is down.  After a 
      beat:

                                  BLACK WOMAN
                    Who is it?

      He lifts his head, revealing a handsome BLACK MAN in a nice 
      suit and loosened tie at her door.  He s all smiles.  

                                  BLACK MAN
                    It s me.

                                  BLACK WOMAN
                          (to herself)
                    Shit.

      DOORBELL RINGS again.

                                  BLACK MAN
                    Hello?  Single Black Female - Pilot2.


      He s a little tipsy.

                                  BLACK WOMAN
                    Is everything okay?

                                  BLACK MAN
                    Yes -- actually no.  Look, I need 
                    to see you.  I know it s late or 
                    early, depending on your 
                      perspective.  It s just that my car 
                    drove me over here.  I told it not 
                    to, but you know how pushy foreign 
                    cars can be. 

      He takes a beat, gathers his truth. 

                                  BLACK MAN.
                    I know I haven t called you in a 
                    minute, but I needed to see you.  

      She turns away from the peephole.  After a long beat she 
      takes another look through the peephole.  He does look good 
      and sincere. 

                                  BLACK WOMAN
                          (to herself)
                    Damn.
                          (then)
                    Hold on.  

                                  BLACK MAN
                    You re calling the police aren t 
                    you?

                                  BLACK WOMAN
                    Maybe.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      INT. MARY JANE S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

      The light cuts on to reveal a well appointed room that s a 
      bit of a mess.  

      QUICK CUTS OF:

      She shoves her laptop and Kindle and vibrator under the bed.

      She shoves the books, magazines, dirty dishes and wine 
      glasses scattered throughout under the bed too.  Single Black Female - Pilot3.


      She snatches off all of the Post-its covering the walls.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. MARY JANE S HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Her bathroom is equally messy.   

      QUICK CUTS OF:

      She straightens the product and makeup strewn across her 
      countertop. 

      She snatches off the Post-its all over the mirror and near 
      the toilet tissue holder. 

      She rips off the head rag, shakes out her wrapped head.  
      Seconds later -- perfect hair.

      She pulls off her sweats and stores them under the sink.

      She whips her bra off from underneath her T-shirt with 
      precision quickness.

      Finally, she takes a look at herself in the mirror -- she s 
      very sexy in her nearly see-through T-shirt just covering her 
      tush.  Then, she runs out of the bathroom.

      We stay on the empty bathroom.  Seconds later she rushes back 
      in and bee-lines for the toilet.  She forgot one!  She flips 
      up the toilet lid and snatches the last forgotten Post-it.  

      She runs out.  She runs back in and checks herself in the 
      mirror.  She likes what she sees.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. MARY JANE S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - FORTY MINUTES LATER

      Our Black Woman emerges from her bathroom to find her 
      handsome Black Man asleep.  She smiles.  It s nice to have a 
      man in her bed.  She puts on her satin pillowcase, then 
      quietly, but awkwardly, slips into bed and faces him, smiling 
      and watching him sleep.  Then Rihanna s voice creeps in to 
      score this moment our girl is having.    Single Black Female - Pilot4.

                                  BLACK WOMAN
                          (whispers to herself)
                    God, if he s mine, please give me a 
                    clear sign.

      He moves and she removes her hand, then a beat later, while 
      still asleep -- HE VOMITS!  Our Black Woman SCREAMS.

                                  BLACK WOMAN (CONT D)
                    Oh my God -- Oh my God -- Oh my 
                    God...

      INT. MARY JANE S HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      She struggles to get him to her toilet, dead weight weighs a 
      ton.  

                                  BLACK WOMAN
                    Come on, come on... not on my rug!

      Inches away from her toilet he s about to hurl again, but she 
      stretches his head to the toilet and he makes it in the nick 
      of time.  While he continues to vomit, she falls on the floor 
      to catch her breath.

                                  BLACK WOMAN (CONT D)
                    Oh my God, Oh my --

      Then she leaps up and dry-heaves over her sink.  It s a two-
      part harmony of disgust.  After a minute, she gathers herself 
      and prepares a warm, wet towel... then she laughs.   

                                  BLACK MAN
                          (groaning)
                    It s not funny.

                                  BLACK WOMAN
                      Unfortunately it is. 

      She takes a seat near him, he turns around and she hands him 
      a towel.  He cleans himself up a beat.  She then turns a bit 
      serious:

                                  BLACK WOMAN (CONT D)
                    Look --

                                  BLACK MAN
                    Look, don t say  look.   I know 
                    what  look  means.

                                  BLACK MAN (CONT'D)
                    And I m not drunk just to be drunk, 
                    I had to do something to tell you 
                    what I need to tell you -- I love 
                    you.

      Rihanna s lyrics pipe up and underscore this moment.  

                                  BLACK WOMAN
                    Don t say that.

                                  BLACK MAN
                    Why can t I say it if I mean it?

      She smiles.  It feels good to be loved.  He goes to kiss her 
      and she doesn t stop him.  After a beat, he pulls away 
      quickly and throws up again.  

                                  BLACK WOMAN
                    I ll get some sparkling water, 
                    it ll settle your stomach. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. MARY JANE S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

      She pulls the Pellegrino from the fridge.  As she walks back 
      to the bedroom, the trail of his clothes from the living room 
      to the bedroom makes her laugh -- she s giddy with the idea 
      that someone loves her. 

      Her fantasy is interrupted by a sharp pain on her heel.  She 
      lifts her foot up to see what caused the pain -- his PLATINUM 
      WEDDING BAND is stuck to the bottom of her foot.  She pries 
      it out of her foot to get a closer look.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      EXT. MARY JANE S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - WEE HOURS OF THE 
      MORNING

      She pushes and kicks her half-dressed Handsome Man out of the 
      front door.  She even gets in a few good licks upside his 
      head.

                                  BLACK WOMAN
                    Liar!  I let you kiss me with vomit 
                    on your breath!  

      As he scrambles to get himself together, she moves out of 
      frame.    Single Black Female - Pilot6.


                                  BLACK MAN
                    I meant what I said.  I love you.

      Then out of nowhere, a strong blast of water hits his face.  
      Our Black Woman continues to hose him down until he reaches 
      his car.  

                                  BLACK MAN (CONT D)
                    Are you crazy?!

        Neighborhood dogs start BARKING.  That makes her stop the 
      water torture.

                                  BLACK WOMAN
                    Kiss my ass --

      She throws his keys at his head.

                                  BLACK WOMAN (CONT D)
                    And get the hell out of here.

                    Good.  There s a tree down the

      With one final glare, her theme music kicks in:

      INT. MARY JANE S CAR/DRIVING - DAY

      NPR pipes through the speakers.  They re reporting on women 
      in Zimbabwe raping men for their sperm.  

                                  NPR REPORTER (V.O.)
                    The Zimbabwean women have been 
                    accused of raping men and stealing 
                    their semen.  One victim claims 
                    that he was hitchhiking and a car 
                    full of women picked him up.  He 
                    alleges that one of the women threw 
                    water in his face and injected him 
                    with something that made him 
                    sexually aroused.

      Mary Jane shakes her head at the news.  The car phone RINGS, 
        interrupting the radio.  She looks at the caller ID and it 
      says MOMMY DEAREST.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Good morning, Mom.  I m running 
                    late and I m still in the car.

                    orange lipstick you had on

                    It s attacking your face.  Don t 
                    follow trends, set them.  And yes, 
                    I want you to talk to Paul.  But 
                    don t be hard on him.

                                  MARY JANE

                    Nothing s happy about it.  Bye.

      Mary Jane hangs up and a beat later, her nostrils start to 
      flare uncontrollably.  She s about to cry.  But before she 
      will ever let that happen, she pinches her inner-thigh really 
      hard.  After a beat, you can see the water in her eyes dry up 
      and her nostrils stop flaring.  She then stands, straightens

      Mary Jane is in the mirror, applying her own makeup, while 
      her WHITE MAKEUP ARTIST sits nearby flipping through a  
      magazine.  Other MAKEUP ARTISTS are touching up the WHITE 
      TALENT sitting in their chairs.  

      There are TV monitors in the room.  We can see MARK BRADLEY 
      currently on the news, but we can t hear him because the 
      volume is turned really low.  

      Mary Jane finishes up and heads out the door and down the:

      She smiles, waves, says to hi to all that pass her.  She runs

      They come to a fork in the road.  Kara and the producers go 
      down one hall, and Mary Jane heads for the big door that 
      leads to the live set.

      She holds the smile and everyone dismantles and heads to the

      at the desk.

      INT. PARENTS  HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

      Everyone is jubilantly singing HAPPY BIRTHDAY by STEVIE 
      WONDER.  Everyone is Mary Jane, her 72-year-old father, PAUL 
      PATTERSON SR., Patrick and his girlfriend, TRACY, and their 5-
      year-old daughter D ASIA.  Patrick s older daughter, NAIMA, 
      23, is there with her two girls (4 and 6).  His other 
      daughter NIECY, 19, is also there with her 1-year-old son 
      TREYVION.  They are all circled around Helen.  It s her 73rd 
      birthday and there are 73 candles on the cake that Mary Jane 
      was baking earlier.  They finish singing.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Make a wish, Mommy.

      She goes to blow out the candles but has a coughing fit 
      instead.  It turns serious -- water, pats on the back, and 
      arms pulled above her head don t make it subside...  The 
      panic doesn t end until Patrick deftly manages to get an 
      oxygen mask around her mouth and instructs her to breathe.  
      Mary Jane watches her father walk out of the room.

      Tracy, white and overweight, with residual signs of a rough 
      life, hands him a glass of water and some pills.  Mary Jane 
      chuckles to herself and exits the room.

      EXT. PARENTS  HOUSE - DAY

      Mary Jane finds her father on the front porch.  She sits in 
      the open chair next to him.  He stares off into the 
        neighborhood street.  Mary Jane does the same... it s an 
      opportunity to see that we are in a nice middle-class 
        neighborhood with a lot of FRIENDLY NEIGHBORS waving from 
      their cars, or as they pass by walking their dogs.  Finally, 
      Mary Jane rubs her father s back a bit.

                                  MARY JANE
                    She s going to be okay.

                    I just wish she d go on and die.

      Mary Jane is stunned, especially coming from this sweet and 
      gentle man.

                    Yes, I do.  And I hope you know 
                    that kind of love one day.  I hope 
                    you all do.

      along the way.

      He goes back to washing dishes.  Tracy chuckles under her 
      breath.  Mary Jane rolls her eyes, then after a beat she goes 
      behind him and hugs him.

                    if you would just give her her

      INT. MARY JANE S CAR/DRIVING - A LITTLE LATER

      NPR is on again and they re talking about African women 
      stealing sperm again.  Close on a piece of cake riding in the 
      front seat.  Pan up to see Mary Jane driving.  From her POV 
      we see a young man standing on a busy street corner twirling 
      a TAXES IN ONE HOUR sign -- this is her younger brother, PAUL 
      PATTERSON JR. -- a kid from the skateboard generation, but so 
      much more.  He has cool tricks and when he demonstrates them, 
      cars HONK for his aptitude.  Mary Jane smiles to herself.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. MARY JANE S CAR - MINUTES LATER

      Paul Jr. crams his sign in the back, then gets in the 
      passenger seat, where he is presented with a slice of her 
      famous carrot cake.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Here.

                                  PAUL JR.
                    Wow, you guys couldn t wait until I 
                    got off work?  This might be her 
                    last birthday.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Might not.

                                  PAUL JR.
                    Was she happy?

      Off her look, he laughs.  She laughs.

                    So let s talk about the girl you 
                    had over last night.

                                  PAUL JR.

                    Lent was five months ago.

      Paul shrugs, takes a bite of his cake.

                    That was her only rule when you 
                    moved back in.

                                  PAUL JR.
                    I know.  I got to get up out of 
                    there.

                                  MARY JANE
                    You do.  And twirling a sign is not 
                    going to get it.  Or selling weed.

                                  PAUL JR.
                    I knew I shouldn t have sold to 
                    your friends.  They re my best

      She pulls into the parking lot.  Paul Jr. jumps out.  Mary 
      Jane lets out a deep sigh.  Her PHONE RINGS.  A number comes 
      up.  Her mood changes.  She hits ignore then types something 
      into her phone.

      Paul Jr. gets back in the car.  He proudly shows Mary Jane 
      the card.  It s a nude virgin figure representing Virgo.  

                                  MARY JANE
                    Really?

                                  PAUL JR.
                    Thought it was a nice complement to 
                    the incense I got her.

                                  MARY JANE
                    What so she can choke --

      As he whips out the incense rolling papers fall out too.

                    Tell them to stop calling me.

      Just then a call comes in.  It s NEVER ANSWER #2 again.  Mary 
      Jane quickly hits ignore.  Paul smiles.

                    I got a few of those on my phone 
                    too.  Who are you avoiding?  David?  
                    Or is he Never Answer Number One?

                                  MARY JANE
                    Why do you always bring him up?

                                  PAUL JR.
                    You may be over him, but come on.  
                    Dude had season tickets for the

      Frustrated, she punches him, but it only makes him laugh 
      harder.  Then, involuntarily, she lets a laugh slip out.

      FADE IN:


      INT. BOUTIQUE STORE - LATER THAT EVENING

      Mary Jane is trying on shoes.  The store is officially closed 
      so she s been at it a while.  The salesclerk is TONYA 
      ANDERSON, a fashionista type that has made retail a career at 
      thirty-ish.  They are mid-discussion and all out of 
      champagne.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Patrick and his tribe think it s a 
                    damn bed and breakfast.  Now my 
                    parents have so many mouths to 
                    feed, they can t keep up with the 
                    house anymore.  It s falling apart.  
                    They worked so hard to move into 
                    that neighborhood... I don t get 
                    it.  We all had the same upbringing 
                    -- college, Little League, 
                    debutante balls...

                                  TONYA
                    I don t like those.  

      Mary Jane takes the shoes off and tries on another without 
      missing a beat.

                                  MARY JANE
                    I know Paul s in school, but damn, 
                    can t he graduate on time, stop 
                    changing his mind?  

                                  TONYA
                    It s like you said on your show a 
                    while back -- the middle class in 
                    America is now the ghetto.  It s 
                    the haves and the have-nots now.  

                                  MARY JANE
                    Yeah and I have to have these.

                                  TONYA
                    Those are nice.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Ring them up before my conscious 
                    wakes up.  Single Black Female - Pilot33.


                                  TONYA
                    You deserve them.

                                  MARY JANE
                    I deserve them.

                                  TONYA
                    You work hard for your money.

                                  MARY JANE
                    I do work hard for my money.

                                  TONYA
                    You give it to Patrick, it ll just 
                    end up up his nose.

      Mary Jane s CELL PHONE RINGS.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Hey, hey.  I can say that.  You 
                    can t say that.
                          (then answering her cell)
                    Hey Kara?

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


      INT. KARA S HOUSE - STAIRS - SAME TIME

      It s beautiful but messy home.  She sits on the bottom of the 
      stairs.

                                  KARA 
                    So what did you think about my 
                    guest for our rapey African story? 
                    You saw my e-mail, right?

                                  MARY JANE
                    Yeah.

                                  KARA 
                    Hold on a second --
                          (then yelling upstairs)
                    Get in the tub, Vander.  Finn, feed 
                    the dog.

                                  MARY JANE
                    I like it.  I think it will pair 
                    really well with our first segment.  

                                  KARA 
                    Great.  You read the first half of 
                    her book -- I ll read the second.  
                    Oh, and I can t come out tonight.

                                  KARA  (CONT'D)
                    I already put on my sweats.  Sorry. 
                    See you tomorrow.
                          (as she s hanging up)
                    I will give you a candy IV if you 
                    will just get in the damn tub!

      Mary Jane hangs up.  A moment later they hear TAPPING ON THE 
      GLASS DOOR.  They both look up.  Mary Jane turns ghost white.  
      Tonya waves the couple at the door away.

                                  TONYA
                    We re closed!

      We finally see who they see.  It s her Handsome Black Guy and 
      his WIFE.

                                  WIFE
                          (muffled)
                    Please?  

                                  TONYA
                    Should I let them in?

      Handsome Guy finally sees Mary Jane and turns solemn. 

                                  TONYA (CONT D)
                    I m going to let them in.  He 
                    spends a lot of money on his wife 
                    and I want a new iPad.

      As Tonya walks to the door, he pulls his wife away.  She 
      playfully tries to come back.

                                  TONYA (CONT D)
                    Come on in.

                                  WIFE
                    Honey, she said --

                                  HANDSOME MAN
                    It s okay.

      Mary Jane finds her legs and crosses to the front of the 
      store in time to see them get into the car that was parked in 
      her driveway less than twenty-four hours ago.

                                  TONYA
                    Isn t it beautiful when you 
                    actually see it?

      INT. HALO LOUNGE - A LITTLE LATER

      Mary Jane and Tonya sit at the backlit bar... it casts a sexy 
      glow on a sexy place.  It s a hot night, but there are only a 
      few other black folks in the place -- THREE BLACK GUYS and a 
      BLACK CHICK.  They talk over the loud bar and music.

                                  MARY JANE
                    What are the odds they re going to 
                    come over here and talk to us?

                                  TONYA
                    Hopefully not much.  They look 
                    African.  I m not there yet.

      They share a laugh.  

                                  MARY JANE
                    Well then what boat did Deleo come 
                    off of?

                                  TONYA
                    His own.  He is a Jamaican that 
                    lived in Ethiopia for a year.  Big 
                      difference.  Plus I gave Adamo 
                    another chance.

                                  MARY JANE
                    You love the white guys.

                                  TONYA
                    He s not white, he s Italian.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Uh hello?

                                  TONYA
                    Please, Italian guys are basically 
                      light-skinned black men.

      They both laugh at the truth in this statement.

      She enters, and immediately removes her shoes and bra.  She s

      scratches her boobs.

      She DIALS again.

                    Boooo.

      She hangs up, puts her phone down and picks up the book she 
      was supposed to read.  After a beat, she sets down the book 
      and trades it for the Psychology Today magazine, she stares 
      at the black woman s photo on the cover.

      Now changed into a worn out men s Duke University T-shirt, 
      she washes her face and brushes her teeth.  She stops 
      brushing for a moment, lifts the T-Shirt up to her nose and 
      breathes in deeply.  After a beat, she goes back to brushing.

      INT. SNC NEWS NETWORK - LIVE SET - NEXT DAY

      Mary Jane is mid-show.  She is talking about the African 
      women arrested for raping men in order to get their sperm for 
      an abundance ritual.  It s a quick peek into who she is on 
      air.  She s damn good and very personable.  Her take on the 
      story questions if the crime is RAPE or THEFT?    Single Black Female - Pilot38.


      And if it s the latter, she asks her guests,  How do you put 
    a value on sperm?   She gets a few fun comments from her 
      CRIMINAL ANALYSTS.  

      But her SPECIAL GUEST is a white woman with a memoir coming 
      out that outlines how she made stealing sperm from rich and 
      powerful men a business.  A lot was settled privately in 
      exchange for money, homes, cars, furniture, etc.  And with 
      some, she secured her future by having their babies.  Her 
      stance is that she stole the sperm, she never raped anyone to 
      get it.  

      (*Note: Any on-air segments will be produced like a news/talk 
      show to give it authenticity.)

      During the next break, everyone relaxes for a bit and the

      Special Guest.

                                  MARY JANE

                    What happened?

      He s confused for a moment, then:

      INT. DR. HUDSON S OFFICE - EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

      DR. LISA HUDSON, a Spelman girl, who has certainly made good, 
      is looking at Niecy s baby via a sonogram.  She takes some 
      measurements, types on the keyboard.

                                  DR. HUDSON
                          (wipes off gel)
                    She s squished in there.  But she 
                    looks good.  And you look to be 
                    about thirty-two weeks.

                                  NIECY
                    That s what the clinic said.

                                  MARY JANE
                      Thirty-two weeks... as in eight 
                    months?  Single Black Female - Pilot40.


                                  NIECY
                    I need to use the bathroom.

                                  DR. HUDSON
                    Oh good, put half of it in this cup 
                    for me. 

      Niecy gets up off of the table with the help of Dr. Hudson.  
      She waddles out with her cup.

                                  DR. HUDSON (CONT D)
                    Eight months, and you didn t know 
                    she was pregnant?  

                                  MARY JANE
                    Okay, I thought she was fat.  Those 
                    girls eat twenty-four/seven, plus 
                    she was always wearing those big 
                    shirts.  Look, what am I going to 
                    do?

                                  DR. HUDSON
                    You don t have to do anything.  You 
                    heard her, she s been getting 
                    prenatal care.

                                  MARY JANE
                    At a clinic.

                                  DR. HUDSON
                    It s what she can afford. 

                                  MARY JANE
                    Turn your car around, I see where 
                    this is going.

                                  DR. HUDSON
                    Of course, she s going to keep on 
                    having these babies, if you keep 
                    taking care of them.

                                  MARY JANE
                    It s family.

                                  DR. HUDSON
                    Okay, then baby-sit sometimes.

                                  MARY JANE
                    I do.  And all that leads to is 
                    dreams about me kidnapping them.

                    between them. I do everything 
                    right, wait  til I get to college 
                    to have sex, use condoms, get my 
                    career, wait to find the husband 
                    first.  And what do I have to show 
                    for being a good girl?

                                  DR. HUDSON
                      A wonderful career, a beautiful

                      Seriously, how many kids was I 
                    supposed to have by now?

                                  DR. HUDSON
                    I think you wanted three back-to-
                      back-to-back by thirty-five.  And a 
                    Jamaican or Haitian nanny.

      They share a laugh thinking about the memory.

                                  MARY JANE 
                    No, porn is still pretty much a big 
                    deal.  So much so I didn t even 
                    have one of my witty comebacks, I m

                    Okay, what about Laurence

                                  NIECY
                    Well, that had nothing to do with 
                    her being black --  cause I know 
                    that s what you re getting at -- 
                    she didn t get nothing out of it 
                    because she s a head case.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Is this a joke?

                                  NIECY
                    No.  But you want to know what s 
                    real funny?  Dante got another girl 
                    pregnant.

                    And because she knows I got his 
                    baby too, she made her shower the 
                    same day as mine, even though she s 
                    only six months pregnant.  And I 
                    know he s going to go to hers 
                    because that s like his real 
                      girlfriend... but if I had it at 
                    your house, he ll want to come 
                      because...

      She can t talk anymore she s so upset.  Mary Jane pulls over,

                                  MARY JANE
                    That s a double negative.

                    pretty little girl who will be half 
                    black and Filipino.  I got a plan, 
                    Auntie.  I m getting my tubes tied 
                    after this baby.  And when this one

                    to school to be something you want 
                    to talk about.  So please, can I 
                    have my baby shower at your house?

      As Mary Jane lets all this sink in, her eyes catch a glimpse 
      of something familiar -- it s her Handsome Black Man s car 
      with Handsome Black Man s Wife driving it.  She turns into 
      the Target parking lot.  Mary Jane pulls out in traffic and 
      makes a U-turn to follow the car in the parking lot.  She 
      finds a park, all the while keeping her eye on the Wife, who 
      heads to the store with her reusable bags.  Single Black Female - Pilot46.

                    Something more stupid than you 
                    getting pregnant again.  I ll be 
                    right back.

      Mary Jane hops out of the car and heads into the store.

      INT. TARGET - MOMENTS LATER

      Mary Jane looks down a few aisles, worried she s lost her, 
      until she finally finds the Wife looking at the kitty litter.  
      She walks toward her, then has second thoughts, but it s too 
      late.  The Wife has caught her staring.  It s awkward.  She s 
      pretty and she looks like a nice person, as evidenced by her 
      warm smile.  She returns to reading the label, then turns 
      back to Mary Jane.

                                  WIFE
                    I thought that was you.  You re 
                    Mary Jane Paul, right?

                                  MARY JANE
                    Yes.

                                  WIFE
                    I love your show.  Oh my God, that 
                    show yesterday.  Wow.  You go 
                    there.  Take it to unexpected 
                    places.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Thank you.

                                  WIFE
                    No, thank you.  Now that Oprah 
                    isn t on anymore, it gives me 
                    something to look forward to in the 
                    middle of my day.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Did you know your husband and I 
                    have been sleeping together?

      The woman s knees buckle a little.

      The Wife stands there holding the bag of kitty litter, 
      absorbing, thinking.

                                  MARY JANE (CONT D)
                    I m sorry, I m just tired of him 
                    getting away with this.  Causing 
                    you to live a lie and me to cry.  
                    He knows the truth.  I know the 
                    truth.  I thought you should know 
                    the truth.

      A SHOPPER enters their aisle.  The Wife waits for them to 
      pass, then:

                                  WIFE
                    What was your goal here?

                                  MARY JANE
                    I wanted you to know the truth.

                                  WIFE
                    Okay, now that I know, what do you 
                    want me to do with that 
                      information?

                                  MARY JANE
                    I don t know.  That s for you to 
                    figure out.

                                  WIFE
                    Oh.  Okay.  Well do you mind 
                    helping me figure it out?  You 
                    thought it was so important for me 
                    to know, perhaps you ll find it 
                    equally important to help me figure 
                    out if I should keep the father of 
                    my two children who I m madly in

                    him and count my blessings your 
                    news wasn t worse.

      The Wife goes back to reading the label.  Mary Jane stands 
      there awkward for a minute.  Her legs won t move... then just 
      as she does:

                    No.  We always used condoms.

      The two women stare at each other a beat, until the Wife goes 
      back to shopping for kitty litter.  Mary Jane exits the 
      aisle, some CUSTOMERS start to recognize her.  One asks to

      Mary Jane doesn t.  Kara, after a bit of thought, chases her 
      down.  She catches her at the:

      She turns on the TV and after some DVR manipulation, she

      They both lay their phones down.  Mark goes back to reading.  
      Mary Jane takes a sip of her wine and starts watching Vampire 
      Diaries.  After a minute, she excitedly pauses the show and 
      picks up her phone.

      They hang up.

      She goes back to watching the show, but somehow fast forwards 
      to the commercials.  She s clearly technically challenged.

      LIGHT CUE

      We can now see that Mary Jane has found her way back to work 
      in the middle of the night.  She settles in behind her desk 
      to work, as Alanis keeps asking Mary Jane what s the matter.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      She closes her eyes and makes a wish.  It s interrupted by 
      the BELL of the microwave.

      Back at her desk, we can see that she has been researching 
      other stories related to women stealing sperm.  While 
      working, she receives a MESSAGE from her FACEBOOK PAGE that 
      she has a private e-mail from DAVID PAULK.  Nerves and  
      excitement result in a genuine smile.  Hesitant at first, she 
      opens it.  It reads:  I ve been calling you.  

      She blushes and e-mails him.  She simply types  Hey. 

      She then clicks on his profile.  His picture comes up and 
      he s a very handsome Black guy.  She checks out a few pics.    Single Black Female - Pilot55.


      You can discern he s a corporate type guy, who loves the 
      outdoors, his buddies and gathering around sports related 
      events i.e. Superbowl, and all things Duke.  He has a nice 
      smile.

      Checking more pictures, she finds one of the two of them 
      happy together.  She smiles.  Then it shows she has a 
      message.  

      It reads:  hey... ur up late.  Working? 

      She types:  Yes.   Then erases it and types:   Baking a 
      cake. 

      He types:  mmmm, miss those. 

      She types:   I miss you...   But quickly erases it.  She then 
      types:   How have you been?   But erases that.  She then 
      types:   What happened to us?   But again, erases it and 
      types:   You look happy without me.  Are you?   But -- you 
      guessed it -- she erases it.

      He types:  dinner? 

      She types:  Yes... When?

      He types:  now? 

      She types:  uh-oh  then erases it.  Then types  okay  and 
      sends it.

      Mary Jane tries to act modest, but she is bursting at the 
      seams to come through for her favorite niece.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. MARY JANE S HOUSE - KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER

      The Young Folk are crowded in her kitchen having a good time, 
      while she tries to wash dishes.  VILMA, her maid, walks up 
      and takes over washing the dishes, never making eye-contact.  
      It s awkward.  The following is subtitled.

                                  MARY JANE
                          (in Espanol)
                    Vilma, if you re going to work for 
                    me, you have to look at me.

                                  VILMA

                    Please, just give me time.  Single Black Female - Pilot62.


      Mary Jane is about to respond but is distracted when she 
      sees, out of her kitchen window, Patrick pull up in his late 
      80s El Camino.  She dries her hands.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. MARY JANE S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      She walks up to the car, where Patrick is parked.  He sees 
      it s her, but chooses to keep his focus on his cell phone 
      where he plays Solitaire.

                                  MARY JANE
                    You can come in.

                                    PATRICK
                    I ll wait.

      She hands him some money.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Here.

                                    PATRICK
                    I m good.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Just take it.

      Then Niecy breaks through the moment with her excitement.

                                  NIECY (O.S.)
                    Daddy, look what I got!

      Patrick and Mary Jane look up to see Niecy at the front door 
      with the black Bugaboo stroller that Mary Jane gave her.

                                    PATRICK
                    I don t need it anymore.

      The two siblings finally lock eyes.  Mary Jane feels bad that 
      she stole Patrick s moment -- because he couldn t give it to 
      his daughter.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Patrick, I m --

      Patrick gets out of the car and helps his daughter load the 
      stroller into the car.

      INT. BOUTIQUE STORE - LATER THAT EVENING

      Mary Jane is trying on some new shoes.  She struts back 
      toward Tonya, who smiles back approvingly.

      INT. MARY JANE S HOUSE - WALK-IN CLOSET - LATER THAT EVENING

      Mary Jane is doing her weekly ritual of picking out her 
      wardrobe for the week.  There are five hooks on the wall, 
      labeled Monday thru Friday.  Monday thru Wednesday is already 
      set with an outfit, accessories and a corresponding shoe.  
      She currently has on Thursday s outfit and is trying on the 
      sexy shoes that will likely go with it, when we hear her 
      DOORBELL.  She looks at the clock-- it s 10:27 PM.

      She heads toward her security monitor.  It s David.  She 
      composes herself, then:

      She laughs.

      INT. MARY JANE S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

      In the wee hours of the morning, Mary Jane slides out of the 
      bed, while David lays there watching her.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Uhh, brother, a booty call means 
                    you go home.

      He laughs.

                    I m going.  I m going.

      She exits into her bathroom.

      good time.

      We discover her filling a turkey baster of cloudy liquid, 
      then depositing it into a 2 oz travel-size container.

                    I hung in there, waited for him to 
                    marry me, so we could start our 
                    family.  You know, the way you re 
                    supposed to do it.  And although I 
                    held on to the hope to be married 
                    one day, I was running out of time

      INT. MARY JANE S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

      From the POV of the interior of the freezer, we see Mary Jane 
      remove her box of baking soda from the freezer.

                    When we broke up, he took the TV 
                    and seven good years of my life.  I 
                    took the sperm.  I see it as 
                    finding a way to get something out 
                    of the relationship.

      We then see Mary Jane place the small container now labeled: 
      D.P. 7/2012 inside of the baking soda box, then put it back 
      in the freezer where it was.  As the freezer door closes, we:
