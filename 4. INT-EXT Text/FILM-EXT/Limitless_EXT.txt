The sleek lobby is deserted. We SEE, through the GLASS, lying
on the floor, the barest glimpse of the FEET of what are
presumably TWO DEAD SECURITY GUARDS -- although their bodies
are largely hidden behind their massive curly walnut desk.
All the security monitors are BLACK -- the feeds clearly cut.
EDDIE (V.O.)
They've become sophisticated.
Before they couldn't have done
this. But now...?
The CAMERA RISES, breathlessly, in a blur, up all 80 floors
of this stunning new building, coming to rest on...
EDDIE MORGAN,
30's, lean and stylish, standing on the exterior ledge of his
multimillion-dollar terrace. New York City looms around him,
beneath him. His hands are outstretched. Balancing. He is
calm, but fatalistic. He's clearly going to jump.
EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I will never let them touch me.
His attention is CAUGHT by the SOUNDS of a commotion in the
next apartment. He looks over, at-
2.
THE ADJOINING TERRACE
Through the gauzy curtains of the window, TWO MEN force A
MIDDLE-AGED MAN towards the windows... there is arguing.
EDDIE (V.0.)
My neighbor must've heard the
noise. Opened his door to complain.
Two MUFFLED SHOTS - the neighbor drops. The door is pounded
again. It doesn't give.
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
He bought me half a minute. I wish
he hadn't. Last thoughts are self-
pitying and mine are no exception:
the waste. The waste of it all. I
mean, how many of us ever know what
it is to become... the perfect
version of ourselves. I'd come
that close. To having an impact on
the world.
The pounding intensifies.
EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And now, the only thing I'd have an
impact on...
He looks over the railing...
EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
... was the sidewalk.
His smile is bitter, as we CUT TO:
EDDIE (V.0.)
Not so long ago, this was me.
Eddie is walking down the street, messily eating a street
falafel. His hair is longer, his clothes schlumpier, his face
rounder --he's out of shape. A belly bulges against his belt.
He wears jeans and that worn-out corduroy "writer's" sport
coat --the one that your girlfriend fights to give to the
Salvation Army.
(CONTINUED)
3.
CONTINUED:
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
I was a writer. Two years after my
copywriting job at Dexter & Kerr
came to a non-mutual end, I had, in
an extraordinary burst of desperate
energy, bullshitted my way into my
first book contract. This was it:
Eddie is walking home, eying the homeless on the street,
feeling his dismal future breathing down his neck.
EDDIE (V.0.)
She was right. I was almost 35.
No one talks about "potential" at
35. I had missed the on-ramp.
Soon I'd be sleeping in the lower
bunk of my childhood bedroom... my
father happy to welcome me into the
challenging field of dental supply
inventory...
He's interrupted by A VOICE - calm, amused:
VOICE
Eddie. Morgan.
VERNON GANT looks him over with condescending bemusment. He's
30, wears an expensive suit, looks like he comes from money.
EDDIE (V.0.)
Of all the useless relationships
better forgotten and put away in
mothballs, is there any more
useless than... the ex-brother-in-
law?
VERNON
Shit! It's gotta be-- 9 years--?
EDDIE
But who's counting.
VERNON
(taking him in)
Hey, you!!!
He genially whacks the sides of Eddie's arms. Eddie
halfheartedly whacks back. Vernon sizes Eddie up.
VERNON (CONT'D)
Jesus, Eddie, pack it on, why don't
you?
(CONTINUED)
8.
CONTINUED:
Eddie didn't need that. He's very self-conscious about his
weight.
EDDIE
Sedentary job, you know...
VERN
So you're still trying to write?
EDDIE
As a matter of fact, I've got a
book contract.
Vern looks half suspicious, half impressed.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
How about you?
(POINTEDLY)
Still dealing, Vernon?
VERNON
(SMUGLY)
Do I look like I'm still dealing?
Eddie sizes him up: the suit, shoes, watch, haircut.
EDDIE
No.
VERNON
Come on, let's get a drink. I wanna
hear about this book.
EDDIE
Nah, I should go--
VERN
You can't tell me you're a health
nut, now. Not with that tire-
EDDIE
(ANNOYED)
Enticing invitation. Thanks.
Vern plucks the pack of cigarettes from Eddie's upper jacket
pocket.
VERN
C'mon, c'mon, one beer. Or I won't
give `em back.
He holds the cigarettes just out of Eddie's reach.
(CONTINUED)
9.
CONTINUED: (2)
EDDIE
It's one o'clock in the afternoon,
Vern.
VERN
When's that ever stopped you?
EDDIE
(SIGHS)
Fuck.
Eddie makes his way home, a little tipsy and filled with self-
loathing.
EDDIE (V.O.)
All the way home she was back on my
mind ... Melissa.
FLASH!
A memory -- Melissa's face as she's talking, laughing.
EDDIE (V.O.)
She'd been so smart. Smarter than
anyone around her. And oh, how she
loved to provoke people...
14.
Eddie walks, pensive.
EDDIE (V.0.)
But there was no link between my
Melissa and this upstate Melissa
dumped, cold-calling people from
her living room.
An edgy neighborhood on the furthest edge of lower Manhattan.
This block may never be gentrified.
EDDIE (V.O.)
40 long blocks later I was "home."
He digs in his pocket for the keys and comes up with...
THE LITTLE WHITE PILL
Eddie standing on the street, the crowd flowing around him.
He turns this way and that, clearly anxious, impatient. Where
to go? What to do to kill the time?
23.
1. Eddie orders a PRETZEL from a food cart. He is having to
dig into his pockets to come up with the change. The VENDOR
becomes so impatient he won't give him the pretzel, and
serves another customer first. Eddie looks at HIS CELL
PHONE. Makes sure it's on. No call.
2. Eddie sits on a stoop, slowly nibbling on his pretzel, his
eye glued to his phone. No call.
3. Eddie tosses the finished pretzel's wrapper and SHAKES HIS
PHONE in frustration. A RING! Eddie jumps up, fumbles with
his phone just as a passing male WALL STREET SHARK pulls out
his phone and answers. The ring wasn't for Eddie.
Eddie, holding Vern's card, buzzes the buzzer. There's no
answer. Eddie buzzes again and again. Finally:
(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED:
VERN'S VOICE
(GROGGY)
Yeah?
EDDIE
Vern! It's Eddie.
VERN'S VOICE
Bad time, okay--?
EDDIE
Vern -- last night 90 pages just
wrote themselves! I totally chucked
the novel I pitched them --I
suddenly SAW, Vern, how this whole
societal economic class struggle --
and its solution -- didn't have to
be futuristic or fictional -- it
was actually ACHIEVABLE here, in
our lifetime -- and I could just
lay it out, like, like a manifesto,
or something, like Mein Kampf
except not by a crazy racist fuck!
(no response, realizing)
Okay, I won't talk any more about
this if you let me in.
The buzzer buzzes.
Eddie sees young, beautiful Melissa, laughing, in the surf.
Eddie walks down the stairs, shaken up but profoundly
relieved. Even a little giddy. Then he stops.
(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:
EDDIE (V.0.)
Only then did it occur to me that
someone could have followed me from
Vern's apartment.
Eddie walks, trying to cast inconspicuous glances over his
shoulder.
EDDIE'S POV - THE STREET
Is this guy following him? That guy? They all look innocuous.
They all look threatening. He has no idea.
Eddie is walking down the street, a brisk confidence in his
step, that penetrating gleam of intelligence back in his
eyes. We know right away that he's on MDT.
EDDIE (V.0.)
Back on MDT, it was obvious what I
should do.
Eddie leaves with several people. Kevin Doyle presses a card
into Eddie's hand.
KEVIN DOYLE
You must have a portfolio, but if
you don't, I'd be very interested
in working with you.
(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED:
Eddie politely takes his card. Smiles charmingly.
EDDIE
Thank you so much.
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
"I must have a portfolio." Very
well -- if I must, I must.
There is a MYSTERIOUS BLACK CAR just sitting at the curb, in
front of his building. No one gets in or out. Eddie turns
back to his machine.
EDDIE (V.0.)
And finally, Kevin Doyle, trying to
sound casual.
KEVIN DOYLE'S VOICE
Eddie, I was having drinks with a
friend of mine, and... ah, you
won't believe this...
Eddie simply stands there coolly; Kevin is nervously saying
goodbye to Van Loon and Pierce, making small talk.
KEVIN
..and, oh, you know, she's on the
wait list... Rosemary's pretty
devastated...
VAN LOON
My daughter went there. I'll call
the school for you.
Kevin blubbers with gratitude. Van Loon's car pulls up. Kevin
pumps his hand. Van Loon looks past Kevin -- to Eddie.
VAN LOON (CONT'D)
Eddie. Ride?
It's the first real acknowledgement that he's taken Eddie
seriously.
Van Loon's limo pulls up.
EDDIE (V.0.)
I didn't go in.
Eddie keeps walking by his building.
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
I wanted to walk, move, digest,
ingest...
His stride picks up, buoyantly.
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
There are moments in life, moments
when you know you've crossed a
bridge, your old life is over. Van
Loon was my bridge. One week, two
weeks from now, I would be
hobnobbing with ambassadors, flying
to Dubai for meetings, blowing off
supermodels, vacationing in Medici
villas... And that too, was only a
bridge...
He steps off the curb.
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Suddenly...
A SHARP, JARRING
CUT TO:
Eddie is stepping off another curb, God knows where.
EDDIE (V.0.)
There was another skip.
(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED:
He stops, rocked.
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
How had I gone that last 20 blocks?
I got another ten...
ON EDDIE WALKING...
EDDIE (V.0.)
... then...
...in mid-step...
Eddie is walking past the Metropolitan Museum.
EDDIE (V.0.)
I was back uptown.
A SHARP, JARRING CUT TO:
Bam! A LARGE BLACK MAN crumples in front of Eddie -- goes
down, hit, blood pouring from his nose. (Could he be the
boyfriend of the girl Eddie's just banged?) Eddie stares at
his bloody fist. It hurts--!
EDDIE (V.0.)
And again...
Eddie is walking, now with a limp. He stops. Looks back. The
familiar postcard view of Manhattan is ahead of him, looking
like it always looks.
EDDIE (V.0.)
When it finally stopped, I couldn't
account for the last eight hours of
my life.
(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED:
He notices his foot hurts when he puts it down. He has a
limp.
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
There was nothing to do but walk
home.
He turns around and limps back towards the island.
Eddie bursts from the door, VOMITS into the gutter.
EDDIE (V.0.)
I couldn't have.
He leans against a street sign, trying to right himself. He
gasps for breath.
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
...or could I?
Eddie walks, slipping through the crowd, trying to suppress
his limp... he looks nervously behind him... is that MAN in
the TAN RAINCOAT following him? He tries to walk faster, but
it makes his limp more pronounced. He turns the corner. He
seems to have lost the guy.
Eddie sits on a park bench, making calls on his cell phone.
EDDIE
Hello, may I speak to Paul Kaplan,
please?
WOMAN'S VOICE
(SUSPICIOUS)
Who is this?
EDDIE
I'm a journalist. From Electronics
Today magazine.
WOMAN'S VOICE
Look... my husband died three days
ago.
Eddie is floored.
EDDIE
I'm... I'm so sorry. Goodbye.
SMASH CUT TO:
Eddie has dialled another number.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
I, ah, may I speak to Jerry Brady?
MALE VOICE
Jerry's in -- who's this?
EDDIE
Uh-- Bill Johnson.
MALE VOICE
Well Bill... Jerry's in the
hospital...
(VOICE QUAKING)
...and he's really sick.
(CONTINUED)
65.
CONTINUED:
EDDIE
Oh my God. What's wrong with him?
MALE VOICE
We don't know. He just started
getting these headaches a couple of
weeks ago...? Then, uh, last
Wednesday he collapsed at work...
SMASH CUT TO:
Eddie turns to the last page of Vernon's book.
EDDIE (V.O.)
Of all the people I called, three
were dead, and the rest were sick.
Eddie dials the last number. Instantly, there is a RING. We
RACK FOCUS TO-The MAN in the TAN COAT, sitting a discreet
distance from Eddie. His phone is ringing. Eddie turns white.
The man takes out his cell phone and answers.
MAN'S VOICE
Hello...? Hello...?
The man suddenly looks up. Locks eyes with Eddie. Knows that
he knows. Eddie leaps up, begins to run. The man leaps up and
follows.
Eddie runs desperately, as fast as a person off MDT possibly
can.
He still has the limp from his blackout escapade, too. He
can't run fast.
Tan Coat is gaining. Eddie collides with pedestrians, steps
on street sunglass displays, sends a saxophonist sprawling.
EDDIE (V.0.)
In the end, my stupidity saved me.
Eddie, panicked, not looking, runs for the crosswalk.
EDDIE'S POV - A HUGE TRUCK
is barrelling, unstoppably, right towards him--!
(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED:
EDDIE is frozen. The TRUCK SWERVES, up on the curb. Tan Coat
must dive out of the way, knocking down pedestrians like
bowling pins, as the TRUCK hits a STREETLIGHT, mangling it --
then is WHACKED -- twice -- by TWO CABS piling up behind it.
When Tan Coat extracts himself from the pile of prone
pedestrians, his last glimpse is of-
EDDIE - DOWN THE BLOCK
disappearing down into a Subway entrance. Swallowed by a
crowd.
TAN COAT
hesitates, but knows that he can't catch up. Eddie's given
him the slip. This time.
Eddie leaves with Melissa. He is controlling his tears --
barely.
MELISSA
You have some left? Good. Go home
and take it. Take the dose down,
but don't just stop -- you'll die
if you just stop. Try to taper off.
Otherwise, the headache's just the
beginning... I have to go--
Eddie, indeed, is rubbing his temples.
EDDIE
But when I run out--
MELISSA
I don't know. I have to go--
Eddie catches her arm.
EDDIE
Who invented MDT?
MELISSA
I don't know--
(BEAT)
Goodbye, Eddie.
He lets go of her arm. A puffy, crippled woman about to cry.
She turns her back and moves away from him, stiffly, limping,
without looking back.
EDDIE (V.O.)
No one seemed to be watching my
apartment, maybe I could chance it.
ON EDDIE
He glances around - the coast is clear - and sets off across
the street. He looks weak, ill - his breathing labored. He
stumbles - catches himself
EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I was getting sicker by the moment.
Luckily I had one pill on me...
He pulls it from his pocket.
(CONTINUED)
71.
CONTINUED:
WHAM! He's pushed up against the wall of his building. Not
by Tan Coat.
By GENNADY THE RUSSIAN.
GENNADY
You fucking forget about me? Huh?
Eddie is stunned -- Gennady whacked his head against the
building pretty hard. He still clutches the MDT tablet tight
in his fist.
EDDIE
I... I... ahh...
GENNADY
One o'clock? And you not here?!
Eddie tries to catch his breath.
EDDIE
I'm here now!
Eddie lurches along the street, staggering like a drunk,
barely able to walk. People avoid him, veering away.
EDDIE (V.O.)
I had to get my stash.
As she leaves, we see that we are in the POV of...
A MAN
across the street. He clicks open a CELL PHONE.
Lindy bolts from the cab just as TAN COAT puts his hand on
the opposite door. She takes off into Central Park. And he's
after her like a shot.
Lindy veers off the path, through the trees, zig-zagging,
trying to find a place not to be seen.
TAN COAT
Zig-zags too, not far behind her.
LINDY
Begins to scream, desperate:
LINDY
Help! Help!!
Up ahead, miraculously, A COP ON HORSEBACK. He steps the
horse toward her. She races over and presses her body against
the side of the horse.
(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED:
She's so panicked and out of breath she can barely speak.
LINDY (CONT'D)
There's... a... man... chasing me.
He has a long, tan --
The cop seems to be paying attention, then suddenly GRUNTS
and TWITCHES, his eyes flutter, glaze... and HE TOPPLES OFF
HIS HORSE to the ground... ...revealing TAN COAT, on the
other side of the horse. The BLADE in his hand is bloody.
LINDY runs.... tries to lose herself in a WEDDING PARTY...
comes to a section of huge, decorative BOULDERS and ROCKS.
Dives behind one of them.
Ahead, she can see the outdoor ICE SKATERS, couples,
families, enjoying the ice. It seems surreal. Several yards
behind her is TAN COAT, looking behind every tree, every
trash bin. Lindy picks up the phone, keeping her voice low,
although she's hyperventilating.
LINDY (CONT'D)
Are you still there?
And we CROSS-CUT BETWEEN:
Tan Coat is perhaps five yards behind Lindy and getting
closer. But she's not crying any more. She's looking at-THE
ICE SKATING RINK, and the skaters, whirling across the ice.
LINDY'S
eyes flash. She knows what to do. Suddenly, she BOLTS from
her hiding place behind the rock, tearing down the hill as
fast as she can. Tan Coat is behind her like a shot.
Lindy races down the hill, pushing past the line of people,
and onto the ice... Tan Coat is clearly desperate --he
doesn't give a shit who sees him chasing her.
In a flash, he's on the ice after Lindy, running and sliding.
People collide with him, he pushes skaters aside, sending
them sprawling... Just as he's closing in on Lindy...
Lindy wheels around, grabs a SIX YEAR OLD GIRL under the
arms, and HOISTS HER INTO THE AIR, swinging her legs at Tan
Coat as hard she can! The little girl's skates arc through
the air --whoosh! -and connect, CUTTING Tan Coat's FACE.
Badly.
He sinks to his knees, hand to his cheek, welling blood.
People scream and scatter. Lindy keeps her wits about her.
She runs, sliding across the ice, and leaping the fence, with
surprising grace. She's gone.
Eddie at the WINDOW, looking down...
He sees Lindy briskly walking away. RACK FOCUS as Lindy
passes... GENNADY. Leaning against a sign post. Lighting a
cigarette. And looking up at Eddie's hotel. Waiting.
Gennady stands there, looking up at the hotel. So he's a
little surprised to find EDDIE walking right up to him.
EDDIE
Looking for me?
Gennady quickly gets aggressive:
(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:
GENNADY
You think you can run out on me?
You think I don't know where you
are?
EDDIE
I was under the impression that our
business was settled.
Something is jammed into Eddie's ribs. Something under
Gennady's coat. Eddie doesn't blink.
GENNADY
Walk.
Gennady walks him around the corner, down some stairs, to the
(deserted) ground entrance of someone's apartment. Eddie
remains cool.
EDDIE
So now you're going to rob me? I
thought you were a businessman.
GENNADY
I want some more of that shit.
EDDIE
What shit.
GENNADY
The pills.
He whacks Eddie, hard, across the face. Eddie, stoic, on MDT,
doesn't react.
EDDIE
Well, so do I. You took the last
one.
GENNADY
So you get me more.
EDDIE
I can't get more -- the dealer's
dead.
Now Gennady smiles.
GENNADY
Oh. Well. Too bad for you. Because
how you gonna go to those fancy
meetings with your nose fed to my
dog?
(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED: (2)
Eddie doesn't like that Gennady knows anything about his
business life. But he stands his ground.
EDDIE
Nothing. I. Can. Do.
GENNADY
Make some calls. One hundred pills.
EDDIE
A hundred can't happen. The
dealer's dead, I have to call three
people to even get a line on--
The gun barrel is brought up beneath Eddie's chin.
GENNADY
You know I don't really do this. So
clean, like this. What I do to you,
I do in stages.
EDDIE
I might... be able to get ten.
GENNADY
Ten. Fuck your ten.
EDDIE
(holding his ground)
Ten. And no guarantee there's more.
Gennady looks at him for a long, menacing moment.
GENNADY
Oh, I think guarantee.
But he's accepted the ten. For now. He PUSHES Eddie against
the wall, hard, knocking the wind out of him.
EDDIE (V.0.)
Self-pity and MDT were not
compatible. One has to go on...
Eddie walks down the steps, with a beautifully dressed shark
lawyer, MORRIS BRANDT, 50's.
EDDIE (V.0.)
Time was bought, and I was released
-- for now.
Eddie's two SECURITY GUYS, waiting, fall into step ten paces
behind him.
MORRIS BRANDT
You're lucky somebody wiped the
room. Weak circumstantial at best.
Just between us -- were you there?
EDDIE
I don't remember.
MORRIS BRANDT
(SHRUGS)
Busy life.
(CONTINUED)
90.
CONTINUED:
He's heard it all, and doesn't really care.
EDDIE (V.O.)
No one knew, or would ever know,
that I now carried the pills with
me at all times.
Eddie stands, waiting, his two security guys lurking 10 steps
behind. GENNADY appears, now with TWO RUSSIAN THUGS of his
own. This is new, and Eddie wasn't expecting it.
Gennady's security guys eye Eddie's security guys, and vice
versa. Gennady is wearing a suit and looks much more
sophisticated. Eddie hands Gennady a small envelope. Gennady
takes it. In his eyes is a penetrating intelligence.
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Right away, it was obvious he was
on MDT.
Gennady whips out a silver lighter and lights himself a
cigarette. His movements are elegant, refined.
GENNADY
Next week...? I require twenty
pills.
EDDIE
Next week? You can fuck yourself.
(BEAT)
Not that you'll feel anything.
(CONTINUED)
94.
CONTINUED:
Gennady's eyebrow goes up. Gennady's security guys reach into
their jackets. So do Eddie's guys. Gennady's eyes flick over
the situation, motion to his guys to keep still. Gennady
laughs, an unpleasant sound.
GENNADY
I don't think your Forbes 400 new
financial friends would appreciate
the details of your little dilemma
with the police?
Gennady turns with a flourish and walks off. Over his
shoulder, with smug confidence:
GENNADY (CONT'D)
Thursday. You have them here.
Gennady turns, walks to the curb, where a NEW BLACK TOWN CAR
is waiting for him and his boys.
EDDIE (V.0.)
Obviously, this could not go on.
But there is very little on this
earth that 45 million dollars can't
solve. And tomorrow at nine, Atwood
would sign the papers.
Eddie and Van Loon flank Mrs. Atwood, walking her to her car.
EDDIE
I realize that this is a useless
platitude, but... if there's
anything we can do...
VAN LOON
Obviously we want to be as helpful
and respectful as possible.
MRS. ATWOOD
Thank you so much. I rely on your
discretion.
She shakes both of their hands. A driver has the door open
for her; she gets in, now out of earshot.
VAN LOON
(LOW)
You think there's a proxy?
EDDIE
Cagey fuck like him giving away
power of attorney?
Eddie shakes his head. The two men look at each other darkly.
The driver closes her door, turns -- and now Eddie can see
his face. It's TAN COAT.
(CONTINUED)
97.
CONTINUED:
With a huge, angry scar slashed across his cheek. Eddie and
Tan Coat look at each other. A steely moment of recognition.
Tan Coat turns away, gets in the driver's side. Van Loon
watches the car pull away.
VAN LOON
Well. He'd better get better.
We PUSH IN on Eddie's face. Who now knows.
EDDIE (V.0.)
But Atwood wouldn't get better.
Because Atwood was out of MDT.
Eddie, beautifully dressed, walks. Ten paces behind walk his
SECURITY GUYS. He is thinking.
EDDIE (V.0.)
Well. Why be surprised? How many
other meteoric rises might be
explained by MDT? At least I had
some; my life wasn't in jeopardy.
Only my money...
EDDIE (V.0.)
They'd kept me all day.
Eddie rushes down the steps, two at a time, looks at his
watch.
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
I'd missed my meeting with Gennady.
EDDIE (V.O.)
And so... here I am.
And now we pick up Eddie where we left him, standing on the
ledge.
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
I knew they would kill me, slowly
and horribly. But this choice would
at least be mine.
We now hear the ZZZZZZZZ! of some major power tool drilling
at the door, punctuated by more BAMS! -- one way or another
they're going to get in. Eddie takes a breath, tries to jump.
He can't.
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
But we're instinctive creatures. We
want to live.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
104.
CONTINUED:
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
So, my foggy brain tried to
remember... where one tablet of
MDT... might be.
We PUSH IN on Eddie's eyes... We are still REWINDING in
Eddie's mind... images of where we've seen him keep MDT...
nothing... nothing... nothing... We STOP at the SUGARBOWL on
Eddie's dining table. Then go forward --no, wait!-rewinding,
stopping again on the SUGAR BOWL. Pushing in on the sugar
bowl.
Eddie spins around, looks back into his apartment, eyes
intense.
EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It was possible. And possible was
enough.
We are in jittery, handheld THUG'S POV shot as they burst
back in, barreling by rooms, looking in them, pressing on to
more rooms...
A MAN'S SHADOWY SHAPE AHEAD, IN THE KITCHEN -
Thug #2 BLASTS his GUN... the MAN crumples, the glass doors
behind him EXPLODE...... the MAN goes down...revealing Eddie
standing behind him --(he's been holding up his neighbor's
body) and, just as this registers -- WHACK! -- Eddie gives
THUG #1 a savage shot with a fireplace poker. Thug #1 goes
down, unconscious... the gun skitters across the floor...
THUG #2 dives, reaches for it. Eddie grabs a piece of the
shattered glass and, in a vicious swipe, brings it down on
the Thug's hand. But this guy is not a tough Russian
motherfucker for nothing. Bleeding profusely, he doesn't let
go of the gun... his bloody hand comes up, tries to aim...
(CONTINUED)
109.
CONTINUED:
Eddie DIVES BACKWARDS, through the broken glass door to the
patio. The thug stumbles after him...
EDDIE'S HAND, still holding glass, CUTS the awning-rope
holding up the awning... The awning comes down on the thug, a
huge canvas curtain DROPPING between the Thug and Eddie.
BLAM! BLAM! Several holes appear in the canvas as the thug
tries to shoot Eddie anyway, but Eddie has leapt out of the
way.
THUG'S POV - UNDER THE CURTAIN
As he wrestles it off... he sees Eddie, on the ground, prone,
just watching him calmly. He starts to smirk. Eddie touches a
MATCH to the ground. The FLAME shoots across the floor to the
thug, who now realizes he's standing in a puddle, the
overturned can of BBQ fluid next to him. In an instant, his
LEGS AND PANTS are on fire. Now the man screams. Shoots
blindly. But - click! -- is out of bullets. He rushes at
Eddie, screaming, on fire, in animal rage. Eddie brings up a
wrought-iron patio chair to meet him, catching him squarely
in the ribs. He gasps, bends over... looks up at Eddie,
beaten...
The face that looks back is without pity.
We are looking up at the penthouse. A SHAPE is dropping,
fast, towards us -- the shape of a man.
It's here! The man's head EXPLODES against the railing like a
pumpkin as the rest of him disappears down, out of sight.
EDDIE (V.0.)
Later, it would be noted that my
neighbor was in the music business.
One of his drug deals had obviously
gone bad...
(BEAT)
And the night was still young.
Eddie and Steadman exit, come down the steps, Eddie looking
thrown. He drifts along, half-a-step behind Steadman, deep
in thought.
STEADMAN
It's not so bad, is it?
Eddie doesn't answer.

116.
CONTINUED:
STEADMAN (CONT'D)
Doesn't every man on the path to
greatness have to tolerate the wind-
drag of compromise?
A black LIMO waits at the curb.
STEADMAN (CONT'D)
Overall, we'll all be better off...
foreign policy, the courts, even
the Constitution could stand a
little tweaking...
They descend the last few steps. Steadman opens the limo
door for Eddie...
But Eddie hesitates. Doesn't get in.
STEADMAN (CONT'D)
Eddie?
EDDIE
After you.
STEADMAN
(CORDIAL)
No, "Senator". You first.
Eddie gestures for him to get in.
EDDIE
Please.
STEADMAN
All right then...
He gets in. And Eddie CLOSES THE DOOR AFTER HIM. Stands
outside the limo, looking back at Steadman through the rolled-
down window, his face a cold mask.
STEADMAN (CONT'D)
Oh, now. Don't underestimate us.
EDDIE
Don't underestimate your own
creation.
Steadman looks at him quizically.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
I mean, you invented it. What does
it do? It puts me 50 steps ahead
of you fucks.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
117.
CONTINUED: (2)
EDDIE (CONT'D)
You think I didn't spend my days on
MDT devising a personal defense
structure that would scare the shit
out of the Israelis--? You think
there's not people with a bead on
you right now, right in this
building? You think this
conversation is private?
STEADMAN
You don't know the caliber of
enemies you'll be making.
EDDIE
You want to push that button? I'll
show you my silos if you show me
yours.
STEADMAN
You'll run out. You'll die.
EDDIE
Or I'll think of something. Isn't
that what MDT does? Makes you
think of something? Might even
tell me how to get off it.
A flicker in Steadman's eyes. Anger.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
What if I just ask the drug... how
to tell the drug... how to fuck
itself? I mean, isn't it like the
8-ball?
Steadman raises his hand to the driver and the limo pulls
away.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
It always answers.
As the limo recedes into the distance, Eddie finally exhales.
And only then do we see it.
He's scared.
