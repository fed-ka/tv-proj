                school I took those brainy courses, but 

                I also took shop classes because I was 

                good with my hands and I liked smoking.  

                And it s the skills I learned there 

                that gave me a career.  Now I m

                of soda we have kept that crap out of 

                this country.  So everyone whose life

                Christeo is with the Boston family that 

                was supposed to get Yuko.

                ways might be outdated.  Sometimes you

                Maybe if there were no fights more 

                women would go to hockey games.

                Yeah, because that s what s wrong with

                No.  You are the man.

                                  TIM

                (SMILES)  You just might be the only 

                one who understands me.

      THERE IS A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM FROM UPSTAIRS.  EVE RUNS IN 
      AND THROWS HER ARMS AROUND TIM.  VANESSA, KRISTIN AND HOWIE 
      ENTER TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON.

                                  EVE

                Victor!

                                  TIM

                Broken ankle Victor?

                                  EVE

                He just asked me to the movies.  I m so 

                sorry.  You were right.

      TIM IS SHOCKED, BUT SMILES AT VANESSA.

                                  TIM

                See, and you thought I didn t know what 

                I was doing.

                                    VANESSA

                I still don t.

      HOWIE NOTICES YUKO SITTING ON THE SOFA.The Last Days of Man52.


                                  HOWIE

                Hey, Yuko, you want to go play World of 

                  Warcraft?

                                  YUKO

                Don t understand.

      HOWIE ASKS HER ONCE AGAIN, BUT IN JAPANESE.

                                  HOWIE

                  (TRANSLATION TO COME)

      YUKO SHRUGS  WHY NOT  AND OFF THEY GO.  VANESSA, KRISTIN AND 
      EVE ALL LOOK AT EACH OTHER, SHOCKED.

                                    KRISTIN

                What just happened?

      TIM JUMPS TO HIS FEET, INVIGORATED.

                                  TIM

                I ll tell you what?  Just when I think 

                it s over for men I m reminded of one 

                  undeniable fact -- a horny male can 

                  accomplish anything.  It s been that 

                way since the beginning of time.  

                That s why there s still hope.  (TO 

                EVE)  And why you re never going out 

                with anyone named Victor!

                                  EVE

                Dad!

      AND AS THE NONSENSE STARTS UP AGAIN...

                                                                            FADE OUT.
