
     A blustery night; distant THUNDER.  Clark returns home to 
     find the bag labeled "For the Man In Love", swinging from his
     doorknob.  He pulls out the blue bottle, reads:

                                   CLARK
                        (reading)
                   'Does the love of your life notice 
                   the little changes you make?  Would 
                   you like to draw her a little 
                   closer? one application of this 
                   shampoo will put you in her hip 
                   pocket forever.'

     Lightning, THUNDER.  As Clark smiles, enters his apartment:

                                                 BLACK.

                            _END OF ACT ONE_

                              _ACT TWO_

     FADE IN:


     Julie, dressed for work, hurries outside. She shuts the
     door, starts away, the door opens.  It's Dick, wet, in robe,
     towel drying his hair.

                                   DICK
                   You didn't say good-bye!

                                   JULIE
                        (smiles, runs back to
                         him)
                   I'm late! You were in the shower.
                        (they kiss)
                   Mmmm. You smell good.

     She hurries down to her car, jumps in, drives off, as Dick
     retrieves the morning paper from the bottom of the steps,
     returns to the door.  As he arrives at the door, he is
     suddenly gripped with a strange, constricting feeling. He
     drops the paper and towel, grabs his head, then his sides,
     then stares at his arms.  QUICK CUTS:


 25  HIS HANDS                                                 25   

     are disappearing into the sleeves.


 26  HIS FEET                                                  26   

     The hem of the robe is dropping toward the feet, which seem
     to pull back inside the cloth.


 27  HIS HEAD                                                  27   

     Shrinks down into the collar of the robe, which drops to the
     porch.


 28  THE FALLEN ROBE                                           28   

     From under a fold of material, tiny Dick Keaton peers out.
     RACK TO REVEAL, behind him, Hans, dressed in coveralls, who
     leaps out of the bushes and approaches with a bag attached
     to a stick.  Dick hears him, vanishes back into the robe.

     Hans, whose coveralls read "Snoil Exterminating" brings the
     bag down onto the wriggling lump under the robe.

                                                 CUT TO:



     Hans, in a neighboring building window or outside the big 
     glass windows, or out on the patio.... watches.


 51  INTERCUT HIS POV (POSSIBLY BINOCULARS)                    51   

     Clark reaches again for the bottles, looks frustrated.  Hans
     smiles a wide, toothy grin as he pulls out a cel phone.

                                   HANS
                        (on the move)
                   It's started.

     Hans folds up the cel phone and vanishes.



     Lois edges her way into the shadows of the alley.  She is 
     cautious and anxious.  Clark is unseen in the dark shadows
     throughout this scene.

                                   LOIS
                        (calls out quietly)
                   Clark.  Clark are you here?

                                   CLARK (O.S.)
                   I'm here.

     Lois walks towards his voice.  She nears him.  We will not 
     see Clark.

                                   CLARK (CONT'D)
                   Lois, stop.  Please don't come any
                   closer.

                                   LOIS
                        (frightened)
                   What's wrong?


 59  INTERCUT - VERY CLOSE ON CLARK                            59   

     We are tight enough not to note the size difference; he is 
     in deep shadow.

                                   CLARK
                   I went to see Dr. Klein...

                                   LOIS
                   Clark, I think whatever's happening 
                   has something to do with that 
                   exterminator!  Dick is gone, and 
                   there was an exterminator at _his_
                   place...

                   Whatever information you get... 
                   I'll find a way of contacting
                   you...

                                   LOIS
                   Clark, would you please come out
                   and talk to me?!

     She steps forward but still can't see Clark.

                                   CLARK
                   Lois stop.  Just listen.  I can't
                   let you see me like this.

                                   LOIS
                        (emotionally)
                   Can't or won't?  Clark, you know
                   how scared I was to let you into my
                   life.  I always thought it was weak
                   to need someone.  But it's not.

                                   CLARK
                   Lois... I need to handle this
                   alone.

                                   LOIS
                        (confused)
                   Handle what??
                        (fighting tears)         
                   Look, ask me to scour the earth for 
                   a bad guy, ask me to wake up every 
                   cop... knock on every door, ask me 
                   to walk on water, but please don't 
                   ask me to walk away!  Because 
                   that's one thing I don't know how 
                   to do.

     A silence hangs between them.

                                   CLARK
                        (with difficulty)
                   I know.

                                   LOIS
                        (fighting tears)
                   I just got you back!  I can't let
                   you go!

                                   CLARK
                   This is so hard for me to say... 
                   But that's what I'm asking you to 
                   do.

     Lois creeps forward and, for just a second, sees what
     appears to be a child's silhouette in the shadows.  Her
     mouth falls open and immediately the silhouette blurs away
     with the familiar WHOOSH!
