      EXT. SANTA MARTA BEACH - DAY (D/1)11

      Early morning in Paradise.  Through a LONG LENS it s a 
      perfect California postcard -- bright blue sky, waves 
      crashing up and down the sand.  Hardly anyone out this early, 
      but a few hardy SURFERS out on the water and --

      Two little GIRLS, 7, at tide s edge.  Droopy drawers and 
      clumsily tied bikini tops.  Eyeing something washed up on the 
      sand, we can t see what.  A jellyfish, maybe, or a horseshoe 
      crab.  Their body language clear -- the Taller Girl daring 
      the Blond Girl to touch it.  Gross!  Don t be a chicken!...

      The Blond Girl reaches out, tentative, to touch --

      A DEAD TEENAGE GIRL.  Yellow swimsuit, thin braids tangled in 
      seaweed.  The little Blond Girl SQUEALS for her mom as a wave 
      washes over the body and we --

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CBI HQ. SACRAMENTO - DAY22

      A flurry of activity -- CHO and LISBON organize fingerprint 
      gear, load guns, pack evidence kits -- preparing to head out. 

      (In the b.g., JANE and VAN PELT walk around the room close 
      together (we don t know why yet), drawing closer to Lisbon.)  
      ON A MONITOR near Lisbon, a YEARBOOK PHOTO of our Teenage 
      Victim, smiling and happy (and wearing braids).  As RIGSBY 
      enters --

                                  LISBON
                    Victim is Christine Tanner, 
                    fifteen.  Drowned.  Washed up on 
                    the beach in Santa Marta.
                          (to the room)
                    Who s got the ultraviolet?

      Rigsby tosses her the ultraviolet wand, starts packing.

                                  RIGSBY
                    So she drowned.  Why us?

                                  LISBON
                    Coroner found a head wound 
                      consistent with getting hit by a 
                      surfboard, and found water in her 
                    lungs, only it was ditch-water.   
                    No salt.  Lot of bugs.    

                                  JANE
                      Excellent.
                          (off Lisbon)
                    The killer s clever, but not quite 
                    as clever as he thinks he is.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    Isn t this Santa Marta PD s case?

                                  LISBON
                    Only above the high tide mark.  Any 
                    bodies in the water are State 
                    business.

      Lisbon eyes the photo of Christine on her computer screen.  
      The girl looks so happy.  

      Jane and Van Pelt near Lisbon, occasionally turning this way 
      or that.  Now Lisbon, puzzled, sees Jane has his hand lightly 
      on Van Pelt s wrist, as if taking her pulse while they walk.  
      Jane s very intense, eyes half-closed as if seeing something 
      no one else can.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    All right, what are you doing?

                                  JANE
                    Grace is mentally telling me where 
                    she hid the keys to the van.  If I 
                    find them, I get to drive.

                                  LISBON
                    So now you are a psychic.

                                  JANE
                    No no.  It s all science. 

      Jane, still touching Van Pelt s wrist, pirouettes away with 
      her, an eerie, slow-motion waltz.  Lisbon and the others 
      can t help watching...  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Keep concentrating, Grace... With 
                    your mind only, tell me forward, 
                    backward, right, left...



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                THE MENTALIST     "Red Tide"     PROD. DRAFT 7/29/08     3.

                    How is that science?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Ssssh!

      Rigsby s enthralled.  

      Jane puts out his hand as if feeling a vibration in the 
      air... 

                                  CHO
                          (to Van Pelt)
                    He watched you hide the keys.

                                  JANE
                    From the men s room?  Now that 
                    would be a trick.

      Jane reaches past Van Pelt, into the planter behind her.  
      Pulls out the keys.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Who s got shotgun?

      Off him, a smile as he leaves the others, flummoxed --

      FADE IN:

      EXT. SANTA MARTA BEACH - DAY (D/1 CONT D)33

      A memorial service out on the water: A circle of twelve or so 
      TEENAGE SURFERS, leis around their necks, bobbing gently on 
      their surfboards.  Amongst them, featured but not focussed on 
        particularly -- Fit, tan, various shades of blond -- are 
      DALE, 16, HOPE, 15, WIN, 15 and ANDY, 16.  (Several other 
      locals watch the ceremony from the beach, including a few 
      SURFERS, 20 s to 50 s.)  

      Jane, Cho and Rigsby walk down the beach, toward this scene, 
      hot and awkward in their suits --

                                  CHO
                    You had the keys in your hand the 
                    whole time.

                                  JANE
                    Nope.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Van Pelt told you beforehand.  

                                  JANE
                    If I tell you how it s done, the 
                    Magic Circle sends a team of 
                    assassins to kill us all.  It s the 
                    law. 

      They arrive at a MAKESHIFT SHRINE in the sand where people 
      have left flowers, candles, teddy bears, handwritten notes. 

                                  RIGSBY
                          (pointing)
                    Her body was discovered right 
                    there.  Coast Guard says that would 
                    indicate she was put in the water 
                    somewhere within a half mile north 
                    of this spot and between five 
                    hundred and a thousand yards out 
                    from shore.  Any further along the 
                    coast or out to sea, the current 
                    would have taken her to Mexico.  

                                  JANE
                    How long was she in the water? 





                                                                            (CONTINUED)                THE MENTALIST     "Red Tide"     PROD. DRAFT 7/29/08     5.

                    We re waiting on the coroner to 
                    tell us that.

      The mourning surfers toss their leis in the center of the 
      circle, then they start paddling toward the beach.

      Jane s gaze rakes the beach.  He zeroes in on one of the 
      spectators on the sand.  A surfer, 30's, more like a BEACH 
      BUM.  Stringy braids, unkempt; he seems very upset, pacing 
      and muttering to himself.  Jane starts to move toward the 
      bum, but Hope comes out of the water and tentatively 
      approaches the CBI trio.  Her friend Win kinda scootches up 
      behind her, drawing closer as the conversation continues.  
      Dale and Andy walk away, up the beach with their boards.

                                  HOPE
                    Hey.  Excuse me.  Are you guys 
                    cops?

                                  RIGSBY
                    CBI.

                                  JANE
                    Cops.

      Hope turns toward Win.

                                  HOPE
                    They are cops.  
                          (to Jane et al)
                    I told him you were cops.  He 
                    thought you were like, men in 
                    suits.  So is it true what they re 
                    saying?  Somebody killed Chris?

                                  JANE
                    It s true.

      Hope and Win are appalled.

                    Christine was your friend?

                    Yeah.  We hang at the same breaks.  
                    I love Chris.  What happened?

                    Epic north-east swell.  Chris loved 
                    to go out at sunset.  She d stay

        ESTABLISHING a rundown little dump in a bad neighborhood.

      INT. LIVING ROOM. CHRISTINE S HOUSE - DAY66

      A dark cluttered wreck of a room.  Decent TV.  Lisbon and Van 
      Pelt talk to DAMON TANNER, mid-30's, Christine s father.  
      Hollow-eyed and beaten down, a drinker -- Christine s loss 
      only the latest blow.  Next to him on the couch is LISA, a 
      tough 12.  In a broken La-Z-Boy is MICAH, 7, playing on a 
      battered old Gameboy.  Both are pale and exhausted from 
      weeping. 

      Van Pelt s watching Lisbon like a hawk, trying to learn.

                                  TANNER
                    Excuse the mess.  Chris was the 
                      house-proud one round here.

                    We understand.  Mr. Tanner, we may 
                    have to ask some tough questions.

      Lisbon just stares at him, as if she had gone away somewhere 
      in her mind.  Van Pelt waits a beat, expecting Lisbon to take 
      up the questioning.

                    Drowned.  Damn.  I can t help you. 
                    I would.  But me and Chris didn t 
                    hang out so much any more.  She was 
                    making something of herself she 
                    said.  And I m a negative force.  
                    Nice uh?  What kind of freak drowns 
                    somebody?  

                                  LISBON 
                    You tell us.  Who does she know 
                    that might have reason to do this?

      Marla shrugs, but starts thinking.

                    Maybe she s been hooking up with 
                    somebody she shouldn t have?

      A name obviously occurs to Marla.  A sly look fades in.

                                  MARLA 
                    Now that you mention it...

      Lisbon has heard that tone before.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes, Marla.  If you help us, I ll 
                    talk to the prosecutor.  See if I 
                    can help you on these charges you 
                    have pending.

                    was molesting her as part of his 
                    satanic rituals.

      Lisbon and Van Pelt look at her poker-faced.

                    I m kidding.  

      Lisbon stands, nods to Van Pelt and they start to go.

                    Last year, Chris was banging an 
                    older guy.  Like old.  She called 
                    him Pops.

                                  VAN PELT

                    Pops.  That was it.  One time, she 
                    said he was getting weird, and she 
                    was talking about dumping him.  
                    But I don t know if she ever did.  
                    Like I say, we haven t been close 
                    for a while now.

      Lisbon and Van Pelt think they have a live lead.

                                  LISBON
                    That s interesting.  But it s not 
                    enough for a call to the D.A.  
                    Didn t she say anything else about 
                    him?  Anything at all?

      EXT. TRAILER PARK. NEAR BEACH - DAY1515

      An ancient trailer in the back row.  From deep inside the 
      dark interior we HEAR the muffled sound of sinister THRASH 
      METAL MUSIC, cranked high.   

      Lisbon and Rigsby cautiously approach.  No guns drawn, but 
      definitely ready for trouble.

      She steps forward and BANGS on the door with authority.

                                  LISBON 
                    Phillip Reeker.  Police.  May we 
                    speak with you, please?

      A beat.  Rigsby nudges the door open a crack...  

      THEIR POV - INSIDE THE TRAILER

      Makes Jame Gumb s basement look very done, very Hamptons 
      WASP.   The music is BANGING now.  Tension is high.  They 
      both draw their weapons.  The place is too spooky not to.

      To find Jane and PHILLIP REEKER, the beach bum -- AKA Flipper 
      -- so deep into playing chess that they don t notice anyone s

                    We had different expectations and 
                    that led to friction.  What can you

                    You know what she was doing that 
                    started the argument, when I hit 
                    her?  She was pouring the sump oil 
                    from her car right into the storm

                    Mr. Tanner.  If we make an arrest, 
                    I will call you first, I promise. 

      Behind her, Rigsby leads Reeker, still cuffed, to a holding 
      tank.  Tanner sees them, pushes by Lisbon, belligerent -- 

                                  TANNER
                    Is this him?  Is this him?

      Lisbon intercepts him.

                                  LISBON
                    Go home, Mr. Tanner.  Look after 
                    your children.

                                  TANNER
                    You re dead motherfucker!  You re 
                    dead!

      Lisbon grabs him and shoves him toward the door.

                          (screaming)
                    Go home!  Now! 

      Tanner busts into tears.  Lisbon stands and looks at him, 
      frozen.  Lisa, leading Micah, comes and takes her father s 
      hand.

                                  LISA

      INT. BULLPEN.  SHERIFF S OFFICE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER2020

      Lisbon briefs Cho, Van Pelt, and Rigsby.  They re all looking 
      at her like kids at the quiet calm teacher that just screamed 
      for the first time.

                                  LISBON
                    Coroner just told me Christine was 
                    put into the water sometime early 
                    Wednesday morning.  So this Tuesday 
                    night party is critical.  Somebody 
                    who was there must know what 
                    happened later that night.

2121INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY 

      Big place -- this school has money.  A memorial has just been 
      held for Christine Tanner.  A blown-up PHOTO of her sits on 
      the easel near the stage.  Stragglers are still leaving.  
      Dale, Win, Hope and Andy are seated together in the front 
      row.  The way Andy and Hope are casually entwined tell us 
      they are a couple.  Lisbon approaches.

                                  LISBON

                    We know how to grieve.

                    Good.  I m not a grief counsellor.  
                    The principal didn t want to

                    Hi guys.  I know Hope and Win.

      The kids glance at Dale.  Jane catches it.

      Dale looks sheepish, almost ashamed, as they reach the school 
      building.

                          (idly)
                    Anybody not show up lately?

      Jane clocks the remnants of a BONFIRE nearby, a circle of 
      stones and charred wood.  Lisbon looks at the waves crashing.  
      Gorgeous.

                                    RAYBURN
                    Just this week, the night guard.  
                    Walked off the job.  Cement trucks 
                    show up in the morning, they can t 
                    get on the freaking site.  That 
                    alone put me back six hours.

                                  LISBON
                    When was it he quit?    

                                    RAYBURN
                    Tuesday.

      Lisbon and Jane exchange a glance.  Jane starts to look 
      around more intently.

                                  JANE
                    What section were you working then?

      Rayburn points...

                                    RAYBURN
                    South east quad.

      Jane wanders off.

                                  LISBON
                    What s his name, the night guard?

                                    RAYBURN
                    Eddy Garcia.  I got his paperwork 
                    in the site office, if you want it. 
                          (to erring worker)
                    Jorge, what are you, nuts?  It goes 
                    over there!   

      He turns back to Lisbon.  A beat.

                                  LISBON
                    The paperwork?

                                    RAYBURN
                    Right.  So you think he might have 
                    done this murder?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)              THE MENTALIST     "Red Tide"     PROD. DRAFT 7/29/08     28.

                    Lisbon.  Come and have a look at 
                    this.

      Lisbon turns --

      Jane is crouched to study a new cement floor.  Lisbon comes 
      over and bends low like Jane.  

                                  LISBON
                    It s cement.  What.

                                  JANE
                    You have to let the light hit it 
                    right. 

      She sees what he sees.

                                  LISBON
                    Oh yes.  
                          (calling out)
                    Mr. Rayburn?

      Rayburn comes over and grudgingly bends down to look at the 
      cement floor in the same way.  

      RAYBURN S POV - When the light hits the cement right, out in 
      the middle of the floor, you can see a little pink bump, an 
        imperfection in the smooth surface.  

                                  JANE
                    See that?

                                    RAYBURN
                    What is it?

                                  JANE
                    The tip of Eddy Garcia s nose.

                                    RAYBURN
                    Get outta here.

      Rayburn walks over to the bump, bends down and touches it,  
      screams and falls on his ass. 

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY (D/1 CONT D)2525

      The body of Eddy Garcia, encased in a shroud of cement, is 
      lifted by four strong men into the back of the coroner s 
      wagon. 

      Lisbon and Jane talk with Rayburn. 

                                  LISBON
                    How is it you don t notice a nose 
                    in your floor? 

                                    RAYBURN
                    It s what I m telling you. 
                    We re trying to finish this thing 
                    too fast.  

                                    MERRICK (O.S.)
                    What the hell is going on here?

      DANE MERRICK - a large rich man - emerges from a black merc 
      that seemed to creep up unseen like a cat.  From the car 
      stereo comes the FAINT THUMP of clearable ROCKABILLY music.  
      Merrick sees Garcia s body.

                                    MERRICK (CONT D)
                    Oh for heaven s sake.  That s a 
                    person?  Someone I employ?

                                  LISBON
                    We think so.

      Merrick sighs wearily, pinches his nose.  

                                    MERRICK
                    God help me.  If it s not one 
                    thing...

      He turns on his heel and walks back to his car.

                                  LISBON
                    Mr. Merrick, Dane Merrick?

      Merrick pauses impatiently, eyeing Jane and Lisbon.

                                    MERRICK
                    OSHA right?  Talk to my lawyers.  
                    As you saw, I have no knowledge of 
                    this regrettable incident.

      Merrick punches Jane on the nose.  Jane goes down like timber 
      and Merrick goes to follow up with a good kick...

      Two UNIS launch on Merrick.  Roaring with anger, he is 
      wrestled to the ground.  Jane crawls onto a cement bag, 
      holding his bleeding nose.  Lisbon watches balefully.

                    You brought him all the way back 
                    here why?

                                  LISBON
                    The local Chief begged me not to 
                    put him in his jail.  Merrick s a 
                    big cheese down there.  

                                    MINELLI
                    That is a signal, is that not a 
                    signal to cut the man loose?

                    He hit Jane pretty good.  People 
                    were watching.  I had to arrest 
                    him.

                    sexual relations with Christine, 
                    that makes him suspect number one

                    Do you have a thing for youngsters 
                    in general, Dane?  Or was it 
                    Christine in particular that 
                    appealed to you?  That, I can 
                      understand.  Because you know, you  
                    meet some fifteen-year-olds, 
                    they re just as smart and mature

                    Maybe Christine was one of them.

                                    MERRICK
                    Are you serious?  Do you actually

      Dane Merrick walks to a limo with his FANCY LAWYER, enjoying

      Spooky shadows, the wind wailing.  Dale, Hope, Win and Andy 
      approach the chain-link fence.  Dale in the lead, as usual.

                    Your subconscious minds may recall 
                    things that can help us.  Hypnosis 
                    will let you come up with those

                    Who knows?  Maybe something Chris 
                    said.  Maybe a glimpse of somebody 
                    up on the bluff there.  The 
                    smallest thing you recall might be 
                    a vital clue.

                                  ANDY
                    I don t want you messing inside my 
                    head.  No offense.

                                  JANE
                    That s the thing with hypnosis.  
                    I can t mesmerize you against your 
                    will.  It s not possible.  You re 
                    in control the whole time.
                          (a pleading smile)

                                  LISBON
                    Christine really needs your help.

      Off the kids, what else can they do but...

      EXT. SECRET BEACH/CONSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER3333

      The kids now sit on a log near the crackling flames.  Jane 
      stalks among them.  Lisbon watches, getting a sense of the 
      showman Jane once was.  CU on Jane s fingers tapping his leg 
      in rhythm, establishing an  anchor  for the kids... He walks 
      behind them slowly --

                                  JANE
                    Close your eyes... Listen, listen 
                    only to my voice... And think of 
                    that night... the bonfire... the 
                    sound of the ocean... The sound of 
                    the ocean.  

      The kids fall into varying degrees of trance.  Andy resists, 
      but Hope is completely under, it seems.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I don t know what you will recall 
                    of that night, but you will recall 
                    something because it s all there in 
                    your memory and all you have to do 
                    is go back to that night and be 
                    there, and there you are.  

                                  HOPE
                    Aaah!

                    What is it, Hope?  What do you see?

      Hope, eyes wide open, is still inside her memory.  She points 
      to the bluff.

                                  HOPE
                    I see, I see Dale s father.  There.

                    him?

      Jane touches her shoulder.

                                  JANE
                    Come back now, Hope.

      Hope shakes off the trance state, looks confused.

                                  HOPE
                    What?  What happened?

      Win walks off into the dark.  Andy scrambling to catch up.

      INT. BULLPEN. SHERIFF S OFFICE - DAY (D/2)3434

      Morning.  Lisbon and Jane and Cho, near the big double doors, 
      sipping coffee and eating doughnuts.  Lisbon eyes her watch.

                                  LISBON
                    What do you think?  Did it work?

                    of them had walked in?

      Just then the doors open.  

      It s Hope.  She smiles diffidently at Jane and Lisbon, shy 
      and childlike in the unfamiliar surroundings.

      Dale steps forward, drunk from booze and being 17 and 
      immortal.  An argument, Garcia grabs Dale s shoulder, Dale 
      breaks free, punches Garcia across the jaw with his fist.  
      Garcia goes down --

      A wet THWACK as Garcia s head hits the bulldozer blade.

      Dale still stands over the dead guard.  As the others beg and

                    only deceiving yourself.

                                  DALE
                    It was her.  It was her who killed 
                    Chris.  She was jealous of her ever

                                  DALE
