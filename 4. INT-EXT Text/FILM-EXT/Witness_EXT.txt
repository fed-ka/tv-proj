TITLE SEQUENCE
The faces of several young children are presented in CLOSEUP,
as they walk TOWARD US across a ploughed field. On the SOUND
TRACK, the haunting SOUNDS OF A GREGORIAN FUNERAL CHANT. The
CAMERA PANS UP to the faces of older brothers and sisters,
then to parents and grandparents. These are not familiar
faces, but faces from another age, strong and open. All are
dressed in the distinctive clothing of the Amish.
Through the last traces of early morning mist another group
of black-clad figures make their way down a lane.
An Amish buggy, black and highwheeled, stark against the
landscape, appears, a spirited chestnut in the traces.
Framed in the glass window of the narrow buggy is the stern
figure of an Amish man in black topcoat and flatbrimmed hat,
his bonneted wife in muted colors, the face of a boy, attired
like his father, peering out.
The horse's breath smokes on the frosty air, the buggy CREAKS
on its springs, and there's the rhythmic CLIP-CLOP OF HOOVES
on the pavement.
ANOTHER LANE
Two Amish buggies reach a crossroads, join a procession of
three others. They disappear as the lane wends through a
leafless thicket of hickory.
VALLEY
A BIG SHOT... now the procession numbers almost a dozen
buggies... it is headed toward a distant farmhouse.
BARNYARD
Where literally dozens of carriages are parked. The horses
have been taken from the traces, removed to the shelter of
the barn.
As the black clad mourners begin to move into the house (women
and children presumably first).
The mourners have gathered about the grave, standing in
silence as four pallbearers are lowering the coffin into the
pit. The many buggies are aligned in the b.g.
As the pallbearers begin to shovel soil and gravel into the
grave, the Preacher begins to read a hymn in German... a
slow atonal litany which seems to hang forever on the frosty
air.
RACHEL
TIGHTENING to her as the hymn continues...
CUT TO:
A few BRIEF SHOTS of a lone buggy containing the Lapp family
take us from the 18th century into the 20th century the
reassuring RATTLE OF THE CARRIAGE WHEELS on quiet backroad,
to the ROAR OF TRAFFIC as the buggy waits patiently for a
chance to cross a busy interstate highway.
A huge tractor trailer rig hovers over the frail buggy as it
trots down the interstate. The camera cranes up to reveal a
procession of vehicles behind the truck for a chance to
overtake it.
Daniel Hochstetler moves through the crowd on the plat-form,
Rachel turns surprised, as he approaches, a faint color coming
to her cheek.
RACHEL
Daniel?
HOCHSTETLER
I... I was at the feed store. And I
saw your horse, so...
There is an embarrassment between them broken by the arrival
of the train.
HOCHSTETLER
You will come back soon?
Samuel can barely contain his excitement as he drags at his
mother's hand.
SAMUEL
Quickly, Mother Quickly!
Rachel embraces Eli.
ELI
You be careful out among them English.
She turns to Hochstetler.
RACHEL
I need time, Daniel.
Daniel Hochstetler leaps into the driving seat of his open
wagon and with a flick of the reins and a whoop sets his
horse off at a fast trot.
The ENGINE gives a WARNING BLAST before creeping slowly
forward.
The train moves across a broad panorama of fields, dotted
with dolls'-house-sized farms and the tiny figures of Amish
farmers working their horse-drawn equipment.
SERIES OF CUTS
As the train continues its eastward journey... Samuel stares
raptly out of the window at the changing patterns of the
countryside. He points in wonder at a brightly colored hot
air balloon as it drifts slowly over timbered hills... he
looks unsure as the pattern of field and wood gives way to
suburbs, bustling shopping centers, restaurants, car lots
and fast food outlets.
As the train travels past dilapidated row houses, streets
choked with cars and the gutters with filth.
Book emerges from the terminal, looks about him, then crosses
to a big Mercury Sedan which is parked nearby. Two men sit
in the front seat. Book crosses to the driver's side and
opens the door.
BOOK
Go get a cup of coffee, Stan.
The driver, a uniformed policeman, glances at the man beside
him who nods in agreement. He gets out and Book gets in behind
the wheel.
Book's car stops, and from out of the shadows darts a wizened
little MAN. He looks about before crossing to the driver's
side window.
Book's car pulls up outside the bar and he and Carter get
out, and move swiftly inside.
As Book and Carter explode through the door of the bar,
violently propelling Coalmine along with them. Now we see
Coalmine is not the killer.
As Book and Carter escort Coalmine out of the bar a police
squad car pulls up, its headlights shining into Book's car.
An alarmed Rachel holds Samuel close as Book forces Coalmine's
face down next to the car window.
BOOK
Put some light on him.
A cop pulls out a flashlight, begins to play the beam over
Coalmine's face.
BOOK
(continuing; to Samuel)
Look at him.
Crazy as Rasputin on speed and booze, Coalmine glares at
Samuel inside the car:
Samuel, white-faced, finally shakes his head in the negative.
Coalmine tries to twist free of Book's grip. Book snaps, and
slams Coalmine's skull into the window edge, finally crushing
his face up against the front window. His face takes on a
grotesque shape against the glass. Carter restrains his
partner and Book cools down. Coalmine is led stumbling away
by the uniformed police. This sudden show of violence has
horrified and angered Rachel, and she glares at Book as he
gets back in the car.
RACHEL
John Book, you listen to me! I will
have no further part in this, nor
will my son! As God stands between
us!
Book sighs, starts the engine and moves off.
Book pulls up outside a hotel entrance as a uniformed DOORMAN
moves to open the rear door.
NIGHT
An attractive woman in her early thirties in robe and slippers
stares in disbelief as Rachel and Sam file into the house.
This is ELAINE, Book's sister. She stops Book as he tries to
follow Rachel inside.
ELAINE
How could you do this to me tonight?
I told you I had company
BOOK
Sorry. It's important.
BACK TO RACHEL
As she glances in a doorway.
HER POV  ELAINE'S KITCHEN
It's a shambles, with dirty supper dishes piled sink, the
table littered with empty beer cans.
BACK TO RACHEL
As she hustles Samuel along.
BOOK / ELAINE
Book frowns:
BOOK
Where's Timmy and Buck?
ELAINE
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
BOOK
You've got a man here and the kids
are upstairs?
ELAINE
That's none of your goddamn business!
So keep your goddamn holier-than-
thou mouth shut!
(and)
Anyway, they like Fred.
BOOK
Oh sure, Fred.
Elaine looks like she's going to blow again, then decides
it's pointless.
ELAINE
Who are these orphans, anyway?
BOOK
They're Amish.
ANGLE IN GUEST ROOM
Samuel is asleep in one twin bed in a tiny, cluttered room.
Rachel, in a plain nightgown, is preparing to climb into the
other one.
Off screen we hear a DOOR CLOSE, presumably Book leaving. A
beat, then Elaine opens the door and looks in.
ELAINE
Everything okay?
RACHEL
Yes, thank you very much.
ELAINE
(a beat)
John said you're Amish.
RACHEL
Yes.
ELAINE
(blankly)
Oh.
She nods and goes.
Rachel crosses to Samuel, sits on the bed. Samuel looks up
at her bleakly.
SAMUEL
I don't want to stay here.
RACHEL
They are English. They don't
understand.
SAMUEL
I wish dawdie was with us.
RACHEL
(swallows)
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
She puts her hand on his forehead, closes his eyes. she
frowns, and...
Carter exits the cafe carrying burgers, donuts and a couple
of beers. Book wakes from a brief nap as Carter gets into
the car.
Book chews into his burger while Carter takes a doughnut.
Its clear they've worked through the night.
Elaine's house is situated on the corner of a row of terraces,
which stretch into the distance on both sides of the street.
Book, Sam and Rachel sit on a park bench eating a lunch of
hot dogs heaped with kraut.
Book watches with amusement as Samuel wolfs down his lunch.
Rachel eyes him a beat. then:
RACHEL
Your sister said you don't have a
family?
BOOK
No.
RACHEL
She thinks you should get married
and have children of your own. Instead
of trying to be a father to hers.
Except she thinks you're afraid of
the responsibility.
Book gives her a look:
BOOK
Oh? Anything else?
RACHEL
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing
because you think you're right about
everything. And you're the only one
who can do anything. And that when
you drink a lot of beer you say things
like none of the other police would
know a crook from a... um... bag of
elbows.
Book is staring at her. Rachel nods.
RACHEL
I think that's what she said.
Just then Samuel belches with huge satisfaction, drawing
looks from Book and a couple of passersby. Rachel smiles
proudly.
RACHEL
Good appetite.
CUT TO:
The front door of Schaeffer's upper-middle class home is
opened by his wife MARILYN. She knows Book and is surprised
and delighted to see him. In the background daughter KATHY
is visible. Schaeffer himself appears and Book is welcomed
inside.
Book slams the front door of his car, checks it for being
locked, glances at a roiled newspaper in his hand (the sports
section of the Inquirer), starts across the parking lot toward
his apartment, walking as he keeps glancing down at the sports
section. He comes to a sort of crosswalk, stops, reads, starts
to take a step... and looks up.
WHAT HE SEES
McElroy, smiling nicely, starting across toward him from the
other side of the parking lot crosswalk
BACK TO BOOK
Freezing, eyes widening. Utterly surprised and caught.
MCELROY
Still smiling, he brings up his right hand out of a shopping
bag (which he appeared to be carrying)  letting the shopping
bag fall away as he does so  revealing a five-inch barrel
Smith and Wesson .357 blue finish revolver with a silencer.
Without hesitating, coming right on, still smiling, he FIRES
once.
BOOK
Already starting to leap away to one side, he is hit, driven
into a half-turn. He clutches at the wound, as:
MCELROY
Coming right on, FIRING again... the pistol's report a
WHOOSHING, like the opening of a bottle of cheap champagne.
And McElroy still smiling as:
BOOK
Hit... a grazing near-miss this time, but enough to send
Book down hard and grasping.
MCELROY
Lowering the pistol alongside his leg, as two MEN, barely
taking notice of anything, cross with their backs to Book
toward McElroy.
He smiles at them.
BOOK
Down, muttering CURSES.
THE SCENE
As McElroy walks past Book, drops the pistol to the pavement,
keeps on going... and is gone.
BOOK
GROANING in pain, beginning to try to crawl crab-like. And
we HEAR  from the agonized recesses of Book's Dream.
SCHAEFFER (V.O.)
Who else knows?
BOOK (V.O.)
Just us.
As the lights of an oncoming car  going very slowly, on its
way to a parking space  sweep over him and we HEAR it come
to a sudden, squealing stop. Book is already trying to get
to his feet... now succeeds, lurching into a swaying stance,
using an adjacent car for support. OFF SCREEN we HEAR a car
door slam, and footsteps hurrying in our direction,
accompanied by excited voices. Book HEARS, turns to face the
oncomers,
ANGLE
A fat, middle-aged MAN has approached to within some feet of
Book, looks on edgily:
MAN
Hey, buddy, what's the score? Little
too much to drink?
Book stares at him, then looks down at his belly.
BOOK'S WOUND
As Book removes his hand we can see one of the bullets struck
him low in the side, just below the ribcage... the other
just above it (but this one inflicting only minor damage).
THE SCENE
As the man stares:
MAN
Goddamn, buddy. You better get to a
hospital!
(and)
Here; I'll give you a hand.
He starts to approach, but Book shoves him away.
BOOK
No! No hospital!
By now the man's WIFE is hovering at a safe distance:
WIFE
Let him alone, Henry! If he wants to
die in the street, that's his
business!
But the man is not content:
MAN
Shut up, Romona! Will ya look at
that blood?
Book has tried to lurch toward his car; the man tries to
intercept him:
MAN
Come on, buddy... you're gonna bleed
to death!
Book whirls on him, his service revolver in his hand pointed
squarely at the fat man's face:
MAN
Shit!
WIFE
(quavering)
I told you, Henry!
Book doesn't trust himself to speak, but the .38 is
sufficiently eloquent for the circumstances, He stares at
the fat man another beat, then hesitates, turns, starts back
toward his car.
As Book's car wheels somewhat erratically through traffic.
Elaine is outside the bathroom listening to instructions
from her brother. From inside we hear the SOUND OF RUNNING
WATER. Elaine is puzzled but also senses the urgency.
BOOK (V.O.)
Put my car in the garage and close
the door.
ELAINE
John, I don't understand any of this.
BOOK (V.O.)
(snaps)
You don't know anything... borrowed
your car. Didn't say why. And you
never heard of that woman and her
boy.
ELAINE
John, why?...
BOOK
(shouts)
Just do it!
HIS POV  BOOK'S CAR
Coming up the long drive.
BACK TO SCENE
As the car pulls up in the barnyard and Eli crosses to it.
Suddenly the car door flies open and Samuel jumps out, races
across the barnyard to hurl himself into the old man.
ANGLE AT CAR
As Rachel steps out of the passenger's side, Book remains
seated.
He lets his eyes travel around the farm.
RACHEL
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make
coffee and breakfast.
BOOK
I can't.
RACHEL
What about Samuel? Will you come
back to take him to trial?
Book starts the engine:
BOOK
(grimly)
There isn't going to be one.
Rachel stares at him, not sure what he means. Then backs
away, closing the door. Book begins to turn the car around
in the barnyard.
ANGLE
As Eli crosses to Rachel, his arm around Samuel.
ELI
Who was that man?
RACHEL
His name is John Book.
Eli is about to inquire further when Samuel cries:
SAMUEL
Momma  look.
They glance in the direction Samuel is looking.
THEIR POV  BOOK'S CAR
The car has failed to take a bend in the road and is now
bouncing across an adjoining ploughed field. It's knocked
over a tall birdhouse by the roadside. The car finally comes
to rest against a bank of earth.
BACK TO RACHEL
She stares...
CUT TO:
As Samuel races for all he's worth across the field,
negotiates the creek via a fallen log  Rachel, now, also
running toward the car.
Eli works fast harnessing his mules to an open wagon. He
hops up to the front seat and urges them to trot.
ANGLE AT BOOK'S CAR
We see that Rachel has made Book as comfortable as possible
in the front seat of the car and is packing the wound under
his trenchcoat with material ripped from her apron.
Momentarily he comes awake:
RACHEL
But John... why didn't you go to a
hospital?
BOOK
No, no doctor...
RACHEL
(bewildered)
But why?
BOOK
Gunshot... they'll file reports...
they'll find me.
RACHEL
But 
Book reaches up to grip her arm fiercely:
BOOK
And when they find me, they'll find
your boy!
He slips under again. Rachel stares at him, realizing the
price he's paid in returning them to safety.
She reaches out, touches him gently.
But the moment is broken by...
ANOTHER ANGLE
As Eli reins up in the springwagon. He climbs down, crosses
to glance into the car.
ELI
Is the English dead?
RACHEL
No...
ELI
Looks dead...
And together they begin to lift Book from the car and place
him in the back of the springwagon. And...
Levi has hitched Eli's mules to the rear of Book's car and
is towing it up the drive toward the barn, with Samuel
catching a ride on the bumper.
RACHEL
Where she's waiting with the big barn doors thrown open. As
the mules tow the car in, she closes the doors.
A bright, sunny afternoon.
SAMUEL
Where he's leading a team of horses to the barn. In the b.g.
three buggies are parked in the barnyard, traces empty.
Visitors.
ANGLE IN SICKROOM
Where Book lies in the bed. His fever seems to have subsided.
He's coming awake, tries to focus on the room.
BOOK'S POV  CLERGY
PANNING the four men in Amish black who are standing around
the bed looking down at Book, muttering among themselves in
German.
These include TSCHANTZ, the district bishop, a hawk-nosed,
sterneyed old fellow; Stoltzfus, a deacon as well as a healer;
and two preachers, ERB and HERSHBERGER. Eli stands somewhat
apart.
ANGLE
Another moment of silence, then Book opens his eyes.
Tschantz rumbles in German.
SUBTITLES OVER.
TSCHANTZ
Well, Stoltzfus, another Lazarus to
your credit.
STOLTZFUS
He was touched by God's hand.
Tschantz grunts, motions, for the other clergy aside with
him.
Rachel enters briskly with a steaming pot of tea and a cup,
smiles.
RACHEL
Hello.
Book stares at her, then at the old bearded gentlemen.
BOOK
(closing his eyes)
Who are they?
RACHEL
The leadership of our district...
the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the
one with no hair on top. They decided
to come and see you for themselves.
Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came
the first day. I think he saved your
life.
BOOK
Can I have something to drink?
Rachel brings him tea.
BOOK
Does anybody know I'm here?
RACHEL
Only the elders.
BOOK
How long?
RACHEL
What?
BOOK
How long have I been here?
RACHEL
Two days.
BOOK
(a beat)
Listen, thank you. Thanks for
everything. But I've got to go.
RACHEL
(frowns)
But you can't.
He tries to rise, falls back faint. Rachel rearranges the
sheet.
RACHEL
See. Anyway, you don't have any
clothes on. And besides that, Bishop
Tschantz wants to talk to you when
you feel better.
The elders appear to have concluded their conference, and
are filing out. Stoltzfus pauses at bedside.
STOLTZFUS
Rest, Mr. Book. That's the ticket.
And drink my of my tea.
He goes. Book is still fending off the dizziness. Rachel
puts the teacup to his lips.
BOOK
Tell him his tea stinks.
RACHEL
(smiles)
You tell him. When you're able.
He looks like he's about to drop off again. Rachel rises.
RACHEL
(from the door)
We're all very happy that you're
going to live, John Book. We didn't
quite know what we were going to do
with you if you died.
That penetrates for a moment just before Book slips into
sleep again.
Schaeffer is knocking at the front doors. A beat, then Elaine
opens it cautiously, peers out.
ELAINE
(half fearfully)
Did you find him?
SCHAEFFER
Not yet.
Suddenly her eyes blaze, she starts to close the door:
ELAINE
Then go away, you bastard.
Schaeffer quickly  but gently  prevents her from shutting
it.
SCHAEFFER
Elaine, I've come to apologize for
Lt. McElroy. He overstated the
department's position.
ELAINE
(bitterly)
He accused John of taking kickbacks.
And you know  anybody who knows
John  knows that's a goddamn lie!
SCHAEFFER
(smoothly)
Of course, Elaine. But as long as
there's any question, better Johnny
should come back and clear his name.
ELAINE
(cuts in)
Better you should get off my front
porch before I get my mace!
SCHAEFFER
Elaine, I don't want to have to take
you in for questioning. You've got
his car, you were the last to see
him 
ELAINE
(clipped)
I don't know where he is.
SCHAEFFER
But... if you had to guess?
ANOTHER ANGLE  SCHAEFFER'S CAR
McElroy watching.
THEIR POV  FRONT DOOR
We see a final exchange between Elaine and Schaeffer. Elaine
forces the door shut. Schaeffer turns, walks slowly to his
car.
REESTABLISHING, and TIGHTENING to the upstairs sickroom window
where a lamp dimly burns.
Book stands near the door to the kitchen, and has heard most
or all of Eli's words. He turns, and painfully makes his way
into the washhouse, moving quietly, hoping no one will come
out from the kitchen.
Samuel harnesses up the family mare, and backs her into the
traces of the buggy.
Eli calls impatiently from the buggy. Samuel sits beside
him.
ELI
Hurry up now, John Book!
With awave Samuel runs into the schoolyard to join his
friends. A teacher begins ringing a bell.
As the milk herd is released back into the pasture. Book
crosses into the f.g., stares OFF SCREEN.
BOOK'S POV  HORIZON
And dawnfire etching the hilltops. The BELLHOUSE behind the
house, the sun reflecting from the heavy bell beneath its
small roof.
BACK TO BOOK
Something in him can't help but respond to the beauty.
A beat, then he blows on his hands, rubs them briskly together
against the morning chill, and turns back to the barn.
It is later in the morning. Rachel comes out onto the porch,
tosses a pan of dirty dishwater off onto the grass, looks
toward the barn.
ANGLE  THE BARN
Eli and Book standing in one of the open doorways, looking
in.
Book collects the pieces of the birdhouse which his car
knocked down the day of his attempted departure. He pauses
as a figure approaches. We recognize Daniel Hochstetler,
Rachel's would-be suitor. He heads for Book with an outgoing
smile and outstretched hand. Here's a likable man who likes
people.
HOCHSTETLER
Good morning. Book, is it? You are
the Yankee they talk about?
BOOK
I thought I was the English.
HOCHSTETLER
English, Yankee. It's the same. My
name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.
(sizes up his clothes)
You look plain, Book.
(grinning)
Very plain.
Book is not particularly amused.
HOCHSTETLER
I came to see Rachel Lapp.
BOOK
Try the house.
Hochstetler gives Book a powerful clap on the shoulder.
HOCHSTETLER
(genially)
You bet. you take care of yourself.
Hochstetler heads for the house. Book stares after him with
some interest.
ANGLE
As Rachel emerges from the house to greet him. She also
catches sight of Book and she pauses, a shadow of confusion
crossing her expression for an instant.
And Hochstetler doesn't miss it either.
Then she gives her suitor a genuine smile of welcome.
HOG PENS
Book, having gathered up the pieces of the bird house, is
headed toward the outbuildings, passing by hog pens. He
glances toward the house:
HIS POV  THE BACK PORCH
Where Rachel and Hochstetler are sitting in a porch swing,
sharing a pitcher of lemonade.
BACK TO BOOK
Thoughtful... He glances at the hog pen as a huge sow SQUEALS
and angrily noses her young ones away from the trough so she
can feed.
BOOK
Pigs.
As Rachel, lamp in hand, walks up to the barn. She looks in
to find Book tinkering with the battery hookup to the Lapp
buggy.
He glances up as she enters:
BOOK
Hi...
As she sets her lamp down near the one he's using.
RACHEL
(beat)
When will you be going?
BOOK
Not long... A few days.
Another beat as Rachel watches him... Book, checking out the
battery power, hits the radio  and suddenly from the
Twentieth Century comes the sound of one of its major
inventions  rock and roll.
It fills the barn, but Book turns up the volume a click more
even and, eyeing Rachel, starts moving with the beat. It's
his culture, coming through loud and clear, as incongruous
as it all might seem with the tough Philly cop decked out in
Amish.
Rachel can't help but laugh... Sensing her response, Book
sweeps her up and they boogie in the lamplight, Rachel
alternately protesting and laughing.
BOOK
You like it... Don't you?
Rachel, confused, protests:
RACHEL
No... You just stop 
But she doesn't really want to. Book grins:
BOOK
(mock alarm)
Next thing you know you'll be off
drinking beer and racing motorcycles.
And it goes on... Rachel alternately protesting and laughing.
ANGLE  THE BARN DOOR
As Eli suddenly appears. He glowers for an instant,
thunderstruck, then BELLOWS:
ELI
Rachel!
THE SCENE
As Book and Rachel's dancing comes to a sudden halt. Both
turn, look at Eli. Rachel regards him level-eyed, without
discernible alarm. Book, looking a bit sheepish, goes over,
turns off the radio, as:
ELI
(in the dialect)
What is this? This Myusick?
Book hesitates, then starts to say something:
BOOK
It's not her fault. I 
But he gets such a look from Eli that he turns, goes out.
ELI
(in the dialect)
How can this be? How can you do such
a thing? Is this plain? Is this the
ordnung?
RACHEL
I have done nothing against the
ordnung.
ELI
(in the dialect)
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this
man to our house. With his gun of
the hand. You bring fear to this
house. Fear of English with guns
coming after. You bring blood and
whispers of more blood. Now English
music... and you are dancing to
English music! And you call this
nothing?
RACHEL
I have committed no sin.
ELI
(in English)
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel,
it does not look...
(tone softening... in
the dialect)
Don't you know there has been talk?
Talk about you, not him. Talk about
going to the Bishop. About having
you... shunned!
RACHEL
That is idle talk.
ELI
(in English, pleading)
Do not make light of it, Rachel.
They can do it... quick! Like that!
And then... then I can not sit at
table with you. I can not take a
thing from your hand. I... I can not
go with you to meeting!
(the old man almost
breaks down as, in
the dialect)
Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go
too far! Dear child!
Rachel is annoyed  also touched, no doubt, by the old man's
plea  but irked by his condescending tone.
RACHEL
I am not a child.
ELI
(suddenly stern again)
You are acting like one!
RACHEL
I will be the judge of that.
ELI
(fierce as a prophet)
No! They will be the judge of that!
And so will I... if you shame me!
RACHEL
(blinking a tear now,
but meeting his gaze)
You shame yourself.
And shaken  but proud and erect  she turns and walks out.
As Book pauses by the barn door, glances over his shoulder.
HIS POV  BUGGY
With trace horse harnessed... Samuel and Eli loading
provisions into the buggy, standing down by the house.
As he goes into the barn.
Book approaches Luke's stall warily... and as he does so the
temperamental mule, reacting to form, starts to skitter, his
hooves CRACKING against the walls of the stall. Book flinches.
Book starts to talk gently to the animal:
BOOK
All right, you nasty son of a bitch,
we're going to be friends whether
you like it or not.
Then, summoning his resolve, he carefully opens the stall
gate.
ANGLE
As Luke eyes him balefully, Book reaches into his pocket,
brings out some lumps of sugar.
BOOK
See... Sugar. You like sugar, don't
you for Christ's sake?
Finally, keeping a mistrustful eye on Book, Luke condescends
to eat. Book nods with satisfaction.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Rachel has entered the barn, is watching Book with a puzzled
expression.
RACHEL
(surprised)
Well...
Book turns, grins with some pride of accomplishment!
BOOK
Won him over just like that.
RACHEL
I see.
(and)
But I hope you have a lot of sugar.
(then, going)
Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
Just then Luke skitters impatiently... Book gives him a
nervous look; one last tentative pat as Luke eyes him
skeptically, then closes the stall gate and turns to go:
BOOK
Later.
And we...
BIG SHOT... it's early morning as the Amish buggies are
arriving at the Zook farm for a barn-raising.
In the b.g. we can see big stacks of lumber all around the
construction site where a couple of dozen men have begun
raising the main supports on the already laid foundation.
Elsewhere, long tables have been set up and women are
spreading them with cloths, setting out big tanks of hot
coffee and cold lemonade for the men,
LAPP BUGGY
As Eli, Book, Rachel and Samuel step down, Book eyes the
construction site.
ELI
Wait here 'til I find a gang you can
work with.
He goes. Book glances around as even more buggies arrive and
more workmen and their families climb out.
Eli appears with Hochstetler in tow. Hochstetler's broad
face breaks into a grin:
HOCHSTETLER
Book! Good to see you!
He pumps Book's hand with his usual vigor, smiling a greeting
and pleasantry to Rachel. She looks on, amused.
Hochstetler gives Rachel a look, and we realize that his
showing up just now to appropriate Book was no happenstance.
And Book realizes it as well.
HOCHSTETLER
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
BOOK
It's been a while.
HOCHSTETLER
No matter. Come with me. We can always
use a good carpenter.
With that he throws a huge arm around Book's shoulder and
ushers him away. Rachel calls after them:
RACHEL
Good luck.
BOOK / HOCHSTETLER
As they move off.
HOCHSTETLER
Your hole is healed, then?
BOOK
(gives him a look)
Pretty much.
Hochstetler nods with satisfaction:
HOCHSTETLER
Good. Then you can go home.
DISSOLVE TO:
CUTS
As the morning progresses:
...Book and Hochstetler sawing and augering out heavy timbers
on big sawhorses. There's an unmistakable atmosphere of
competition between the two men, which doesn't go entirely
unnoticed by the half-dozen or so other young men on the
gang.
...or, indeed, by Rachel; in fact, she seems  without leaning
on it too heavily  to be measuring the two men as the morning
progresses, and she occasionally passes within proximity of
them.
...Eli and a couple of other elders prowling the job with
sheaves of hand-drawn sketches under their arms, supervising
the construction. All around them the structure is rising
with remarkable rapidity.
...Rachel, where she's helping the women set out the huge
noon meal. Other women are sitting on benches in the b.g.,
knitting or doing quiltwork.
...Samuel, where he's banging away with a hammer, with a
group of boys his own age. Elsewhere we see little girls
"botching" (a hand-clapping game played to German rhymes).
...The very elderly; sitting on the grass or in wheelchairs
in the sunlight, looking on  the old men kibitzing in German,
the women gossiping.
Until...
BIG SHOT
Of the barn-raising with the noon sun high overhead... at
least a hundred and fifty men are swarming over and about
the barn framework...
...some aid the rafters, some hauling lumber to the job,
others sawing, hammering, drilling, joining, planing and
what-all... so many that the barn seems almost to be rearing
up before our very eyes. And there isn't a power tool in
sight.
WOMEN'S AREA
As Rachel crosses near the benches... we can see other women
eyeing her, whispering among themselves, some tittering.
Rachel ignores them.
She joins the stoutly amiable Mrs. Yoder from the funeral
sequence earlier. The older woman is emptying a big pan of
fried chicken into serving platters. She smiles, obviously
liking Rachel.
MRS. YODER
Everyone has an idea about you and
the English.
RACHEL
All of them charitable, I'm sure.
MRS. YODER
Hardly any of them.
ANGLE  THE ROOFBEAM
Book and Hochstetler astride the roofbeam studs, holding
them together prior to nailing them to the roof-beam. They
are, therefore, crotch to the mast and facing one another,
way out at the far end of the roof.
Suddenly, as Hochstetler raises his hammer, the studs start
to part, threatening to de-ball the both of them.
Hochstetler drops his hammer, grabs both sides of the roof
with incredible brute strength, and, literally, pulls it
back together.
Book stares at Hochstetler with nothing short of awe.
Hochstetler, straining and grinning, looks to Book:
HOCHSTETLER
Nail it!
BOOK
Yes, sir.
And he does nail it while Hochstetler, grinning and holding,
looks on.
DISSOLVE TO:
BIG SHOT
The barn is done, the workmen climbing down from the rafters.
It's late afternoon.
ANGLE ON BOOK
He hesitates. His face is pale and covered with sweat. The
exertion of the day has taken its toll. He's in danger of
fainting and is some forty feet above the ground. But he's
determined it won't happen, determined that he won't fall,
nor will he humiliate himself by calling for help. Hochstetler
guesses the situation. He moves beside Book, claps an arm
about him, says nothing, doesn't even look at Book. From
below, someone TELLS them to hurry up.
Hochstetler shouts:
HOCHSTETLER
We admire our work!
The moment passes for Book, and he's okay. Hochstetler removes
his supporting arm. Book looks him in the eye, nods his
appreciation almost imperceptibly. Hochstetler wants no
thanks, and Book knows it. Hochstetler gives him a resounding
SLAP on the back, and starts climbing down. Book follows.
The gathering has congregated to hear Bishop Tschantz offer
up a blessing on the new barn.
CONGREGATION
PANNING the faces as they listen to the heavy German words
rolling out over the still evening air.
Book stands a little to one side of the Amish. The prayers
he cannot share with them. Rachel is aware of this, feels
something of his emotion. She looks toward him, then she too
closes her eyes and drifts away from him, into the soothing
prayer.
CUT TO:
Book stands outside, listening to the NIGHT SOUNDS. He turns,
walks up toward the porch.
Book takes a seat in a chair, SIGHS, looks toward the night
sky.
There is a SOUND, but it's a moment before he turns his eyes
toward the door.
ANGLE  THE DOOR
Samuel standing there in his nightshirt.
BACK TO SCENE
As Book leans forward in his chair.
BOOK
Hey, Sam...
SAMUEL
...I want to say a thing.
BOOK
(sitting up)
What's that, Sam?
The boy hesitates, holds for a time, then suddenly darts
across to Book, wraps his arms around him, hugs him tightly...
then breaks away, turns and runs hack into the house, leaving
the door open behind him.
ANGLE  BOOK
Looking after the boy, genuinely moved. After a moment, he
speaks softly:
BOOK
Same to you, Sam.
After another moment, he gets up, moves to close the door
that Samuel has left open behind him.
ANOTHER ANGLE  BOOK
From the lighted/shadowed area outside the door. He comes to
the door, starts to close it, then hesitates, looks into see
where the light is coming from. He looks down the corridor.
The light is obviously coming from the kitchen. He speaks
softly:
BOOK
Sam?
No answer. Book steps inside, pulls the door shut behind
him, moves down-the corridor toward the kitchen.
REESTABLISHING...
ANGLE  HEN YARD
Where Rachel is scattering feed to the chickens.
A beat, then Book approaches from behind her. A moment, as
she senses his presence.
Book watches as Rachel begins to gather the eggs, placing
them in the fold of her apron.
When he speaks, he speaks softly, and she pauses in her work.
BOOK
Last night.
She goes very still, but keeps her back to him.
BOOK
If... we'd made love, then, I couldn't
leave.
She lowers her head slightly, but remains turned away from
him.
Book continues to stare at her.
The Lapp carriage on a winding lane.
We can see the Lapp buggy approaching a rural intersection,
another buggy approaching at right angles.
As the Lapp buggy passes the intersection and the Hochstetler
buggy swings in behind them. Then the Hochstetler buggy,
coming on at a faster clip, starts to pass the Lapp buggy.
It's a Saturday afternoon in the tourist season, and they're
everywhere  taking shots of anything Amish. There's a ROWDY
YOUNG ELEMENT amongst them who are making their presence
fast, and generally making a nuisance of themselves.
Book and Rachel get out of the buggy. Samuel stays inside;
the crowds make him nervous. A huge tourist bus billowing
smoke pulls up nearby.
Rachel enters the store, but before Book can follow he's
stopped by a TOURIST LADY with an instamatic camera... She
waggles the camera at him...
TOURIST LADY
Could I... ah, you know?
BOOK
(smiling)
Lady, if you take my picture, I'll
rip your brassiere off and strangle
you with it.
The Tourist Lady stares at him in stunned disbelief, her
grin frozen on her face. Then she begins to scuttle back
from whence she came.
The buggy turns into the side street. Some hundred yards
ahead another buggy is stopped in the middle of the road 
several youths gathered about it. A pickup truck is stopped,
facing the buggy.
Hochstetler and his family sit, impassive, ignoring various
jeers and taunts from the English lads  various jokes about
them being dirty etc. One jabs an ice cream cone into
Hochstetler's forehead, which leaves a curious white circle
on his forehead. Another fools about with the horse causing
it to shy. A third notices the slow, sure, approach of John
Book.
YOUTH
Here comes another one!
Book stops, his path blocked by the third youth. The youth
flicks off Book's hat.
BOOK
(quietly)
You're making a mistake.
Hochstetler calls from his buggy.
HOCHSTETLER
Everything is all right, John.
BOOK
(to the youth)
Pick up the hat.
The youth momentarily unsure  something about Book's tone
of voice. The youth does pick up the hat, crumples it, stamps
on it, and puts it back at a crazy angle on Book's head. A
pause, then Book explodes.
The kid never knew what hit him or where it came from, he
hits the road surface already unconscious. A second youth
grabs Book from behind. A mistake. Book is smashing into
him, spatters of blood from his nose flying in all directions.
He's hitting too hard, too often. It's Schaeffer he's hitting.
Hochstetler is pulling him away, Rachel is there too. A crowd
is gathering, but as suddenly as it began it's over. Book
shakes Hochstetler off him, straightens his hat, and in a
kind of daze, begins walking past the scene in the direction
of the Lapp farm.
The youths are picking up their wounded, helping them back
to their truck, aided by none other than Hochstetler. An OLD
LOCAL addresses Rachel.
LOCAL MAN
Never seen anything like that in all
my years.
RACHEL
(covering)
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
LOCAL MAN
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be
different.
(addresses a gathering
crow)
Our Lancaster brethren, they just
don't have that kind of fight in
them.
RACHEL
John, lost control of himself. He...
will be repentant.
LOCAL MAN
(to Rachel)
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
RACHEL
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
A second man calls from the pickup.
SECOND MAN
Kid's nose is broken!
LOCAL MAN
We'll take him up the hospital. Good-
day to you, Mrs. Lapp.
(he shouts after her)
This ain't good for the tourist trade,
you know! You tell that to your Ohio
cousin!
But Rachel is already steering past the scene and following
the by now distant figure of John Book.
Book comes out of the carpenter's shop carrying the repaired
birdhouse on its pole in one hand, a shovel in the other.
Rachel is shepherding the milking cows toward the barn.
RACHEL
You should not bother with that
birdhouse.
(a beat)
If you're leaving tomorrow.
BOOK
I'm leaving tonight.
(and)
I'm going to need my clothes. And my
gun.
She nods, looks away... looks back at him twice in glances.
There is a moment when it appears she might either bark at
him or begin to weep. He waits. When she does turn to him,
she speaks softly:
RACHEL
There was a time when I thought you
might have stayed.
BOOK
(hesitating... then)
There was.
RACHEL
There was a time when I would have
welcomed it.
BOOK
(after a beat)
I know.
RACHEL
(asking)
I was being foolish?
BOOK
No.
(and)
I was being unrealistic. Even thinking
about living this life.
RACHEL
You're so sure of that?
BOOK
Aren't you? After today?
RACHEL
(almost conceding it,
but... her voice
rising a bit, annoyed)
I'm not so sure of anything as you
are, John Book. You could live this
life if you wanted to bad enough.
(a beat)
Just as I could live yours!
BOOK
(almost groaning)
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
RACHEL
There is always a way! But you are
such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot
see! You'd rather go back to that
city! To nothing! No woman! No
children! No land!
BOOK
(now getting annoyed)
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman
and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's
what I know and that's what I do!
RACHEL
What you do is take vengeance! Which
is a sin against heaven!
BOOK
That's your way, not mine.
RACHEL
That's God's way!
BOOK
Well in the City of Philadelphia,
God needs a little help!
He has offended her, immediately knows it, but can't bring
himself to make an instant apology. But he's chewing on it
when she takes the moment unto herself. She pulls herself
up, speaks with great dignity:
RACHEL
I could never love a man who was
so... little.
He looks at her, sad-eyed, his anger ebbing and gone,
realizing that he'll never meet a finer woman... never even
get close to such a one. He appears to start to speak, but
then does not.
She turns, moves away a few steps, stops, looks back at him.
she holds for a moment, blinking tears, then speaks with
some difficulty, emotion welling in her words.
RACHEL
The other night... when you saw me
after my bath... I... I tried to
look as I thought you would want a
woman to look.
(sadly... but with a
slight, proud lift
of chin)
I am sorry... that I did not.
She holds for an instant, then turns and walks off.
BOOK
Looking after her. A face full of loss.
The distant figure of Book working on the birdhouse.
In the rapidly fading light, Rachel walks slowly toward Book.
CLOSE on her face, staring straight ahead toward Book.
ANGLE on Book, CLOSE. He turns and watches Rachel's approach.
BIG WIDE ANGLE
The light now nearly gone, the NIGHT SOUNDS beginning, as
Rachel reaches Book and they embrace.
Book and Rachel in a passionate embrace, sink to the still
warm earth and make love.
ESTABLISHING an all-night cafe in the early hours of the
morning.
TIGHTENING to the bleakly lighted windows.
As Schaeffer and his men are climbing into their car. Holmes
and the Sheriff watch after them.
HOLMES
Maybe I'll take a drive over that
way.
SHERIFF
Let 'em be. It's their dirty laundry.
But Holmes pauses to watch Schaeffer's car pull out.
With the first light of dawn on the eastern horizon,
Schaeffer's car approaches along the lane, pulls into the
Lapp driveway and comes to a halt.
In the b.g. we can make out the farmhouse and outbuildings.
HOLD as Schaeffer, McElroy and Fergie step out of the car.
They break out short-barreled twelve-gauge pumps, start TOWARD
CAMERA, spreading out as they turn up the long driveway...
figures of ominous intent striding through the misty dawn.
ANGLE
GOING WITH the trio of gunmen... McElroy, breath smoking in
the chill, eyes the terrain:
MCELROY
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity.
What do you figure they plug all
their shit into?
SCHAEFFER
They don't have any shit.
Samuel running.
Fergie almost to the upper barn, McElroy  well back and
moving slowly, circumspectly  headed toward the lower barn.
Fergie at the door to the upper barn, moving very cautiously,
gun up. He eases around the doorpost, looks within.
McElroy standing still, shock-eyed, looking toward the sound
of the shots. Then starting slowly forward.
SCHAEFFER
On the porch of the house, looking toward the barn.
Some distance from the barn, Samuel's hearing the shots,
stops dead in his tracks... the sound of the shots still
REVERBERATING across the quiet fields.
SAMUEL
(stricken)
Mr. Book?
He hesitates, then turns, starts trotting back toward the
barns.
Rachel has moved into the open kitchen door, glances anxiously
toward the barns. Starts out. Schaeffer pushes her back.
SCHAEFFER
Get back in there.
RACHEL
My son is out there!
SCHAEFFER
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
As McElroy, checking the safety on his twelve-gauge, steps
into the barn.
Schaeffer staring toward the barn, SHOUTS:
SCHAEFFER
What the hell happened?
He listens, hears nothing, snorts, starts toward the barn
checking his gun, not hurrying.
Samuel running as fast as he can trips as he crosses a small
muddy stream, falls full length, scrambles up, runs on.
Samuel, at the top of the barnyard, stops at the SOUND OF
THE SHOT, wide-eyed. He listens for an-instant, starts a
step toward the barn, then stops again, looks to a large
bell suspended in a cupola by one of the outbuildings. He
moves quickly to the bell, seizes the rope, pulls. The bell
CLANGS loudly, Sonorously.
SCHAEFFER
On the front porch, looking around for the location of the
sounding bell. He takes a step toward the barn, the stops,
looks back toward the house... frustrated.
Samuel RINGING the bell. The bell rope is short, and so is
Samuel and his feet go off the ground with every swing of
the rockerarm.
He hangs on grimly, his black hat clinging to the back of
his head, his face set against the tears that move down his
cheeks.
SCHAEFFER
Comes hesitantly down the path toward the barn, looking toward
the sound of the bell, but also looking back in glances toward
the house to make sure Rachel and Eli stay where they are.
He still can't see Samuel.
HIS POV  THE PORCH
As Rachel starts off the porch, takes a few steps.
SCHAEFFER
Turning, SHOUTING:
SCHAEFFER
You stay put!
RACHEL
She stops. She is also unable to see Samuel.
SCHAEFFER
Moving out toward the barn, rounding a corner... and there
is Samuel at the bellrope. He starts toward him.
Beyond Samuel, well out in the fields of the Stoltzfus farm,
Stotlzfus and others  including Hochstetler and his brothers
 are baling the first cutting of June hay.
But the operation has come to a halt. All are looking in
toward the Lapp farm, hearing the RINGING OF THE BELL (the
Amish cry for help), wondering, hesitating.
But now, as we watch, led by Hochstetler, they start in toward
Samuel.
As Schaeffer reaches Samuel, SHOUTS:
SCHAEFFER
Cut that out!
Samuel looks at him, keeps on pulling.
Schaeffer quickly crosses to him, grabs him by the back of
the neck, tries to pull him off the bell rope. Samuel hangs
on grimly.
Schaeffer yanks hard, succeeds in yanking Samuel free, shoves
him roughly aside. Then Schaeffer turns, FIRES a shotgun
blast into the top of the bellrope. It still hangs by several
threads, so he FIRES again.
The rope drops to the ground. Schaeffer reloads, turns to
look at Samuel, just getting to his feet. A moment... when
Schaeffer, recognizing Samuel as the Amish kid who saw McElroy
kill Zenovich, perhaps thinks of disposing of the witness
right then and there.
But a glance toward the oncoming Amish gives him pause. He
SNARLS at Sam:
SCHAEFFER
Get down to the house and stay there!
Samuel gets to his feet, turns, trots off.
RACHEL
Already halfway out to the barn, running to gather Sam in
her arms... then to lead him back toward the house.
SCHAEFFER
Turning, starting very slowly toward the barn.
As first Stoltzfus and Samuel, then Book and Schaeffer emerge
into the barnyard. Schaeffer has the muzzle of his pistol
pressed firmly against Book's throat, just below his jaw.
Schaeffer pulls up, frowning:
SCHAEFFER
Hold it.
WHAT HE SEES
The Amishmen gathered  the Stoltzfus family, the Hochstetler
brothers, et al. All staring hard at Schaeffer and Book.
From a high wide angle the final scene is played out.
Schaeffer and Book, now moving again slowly up the drive,
the Amish following along closely on both sides.
CLOSE ON BOOK
As Schaeffer prods Book forward, warily eyeing the Amish.
SCHAEFFER
Get back, you people!
(prodding)
Keep moving, Johnny...
Book takes a couple of steps further, then abruptly stops.
The Amish stand about close, staring, no one moving. Book
now slowly turns his head, looks at Schaeffer.
BOOK
You're going to have to do it right
here, Schaeffer.
SCHAEFFER
Don't try me, Johnny!
Eli steps forward, bloody cloth held to his head.
ELI
So... will you kill us all, then?
ANGLE
As Schaeffer's eyes waver between Book and Eli, Book slowly
turns until he is facing Schaeffer... the gun now leveled 
and almost pressing against  Book's chest. Book locks eyes
with Schaeffer.
Quietly:
BOOK
It's all over, Paul.
SCHAEFFER
Move! Or you die right here!
Book's right hand snakes out, grabs Schaeffer by the gunhand
wrist, twists viciously, Schaeffer SCREAMS in pain, the gun
falls out of his hand, he starts to his knees under the force
of Book's grip.
ANOTHER ANGLE
As Book bends, picks up the pistol, releases Schaeffer, pushes
him away. Schaeffer staggers against Hochstetler, who  partly
to keep him from falling, and partly (it appears) to
congratulate him on his surrender  wraps one brawny arm
around Schaeffer's shoulders, gives him a short approving
nod... holds Schaeffer as:
BOOK
Turning, looking into the crowd, finding Rachel. Their gazes
meet, hold for a long MOMENT. In the eyes of both we read
resignation... whatever there was between them has been
terribly damaged. It is almost certainly over for them, too.
HIGH SHOT holding the moment.
The door opens and Book steps out, looking somehow strange
in his working suit. He looks about him, sees Samuel down by
the pond.
He eases down beside Samuel. They both stare into the pond.
SAMUEL
Are you really ever coming back?
BOOK
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to
a courthouse together, put some people
behind bars.
SAMUEL
Have you got your gun on now?
BOOK
Sure have, Sam.
Sam grins. Book takes him in his arms, holds him.
Book opens the door of the car, turns to find Rachel standing
there with his Amish hat in hand.
RACHEL
I want you to take this... to remember
by.
BOOK
Where's my baggy pants?
RACHEL
Here. Whenever you want them.
He wants to kiss her, but does not. Their eyes say it all.
Eli has a final word, SHOUTING from the porch.
ELI
You be careful, John Book! Out among
them English!
Book gets quickly into the car.
As Book drives, he sees an open buggy coming down the hill
toward the farm, He slows as he passes, It's Daniel
Hochstetler. A long beat, and as they pass, Hochstetler gives
Book an expansive tip of his hat.
