      WHUMPH!  CAMERA SHAKE, just one, big jolt.  Then nothing.

                    Trying to phone the Doctor, sir. 
                    But there's no signal!  This number
                    calls anywhere in the universe, it
                    never breaks down.  They must be
                    blocking it.  Whoever 'they' are.

                    coming into orbit.

      Alarm blaring.  ROSE's feet crunch over broken glass, the
      shop door broken.  Following her in and PAN UP to reveal...

      Big shop, abandoned.  Empty, except for two LOOTERS, shoving
      laptops into a sack.  They glance at Rose, keep scavenging.

                                    ROSE
                    All right, you two.  You can put
                    that stuff down, or run for your
                    lives.  No.  You can put that stuff
                    down, AND run for your lives.  Bit
                    new to this.  Like the gun?

      And big smile, she hoists it up, ka-chik!

      The looters run!

                    Yeah, more to the point, I've got
                    a missing planet!

                    Then you're not as wise as the
                    stories would say.  The picture is
                    far bigger than you imagine.  The
                    whole universe is in outrage,
                    Doctor; 24 worlds have been taken
                    from the sky.

                    The locations range far and wide. 
                    But all disappeared at the exact
                    same moment.  Leaving no trace.

                    Nothing.  They rearranged

      in a wide semi-circle, a silent DALEK at each one.

      Still, only the voice.  A FIGURE hidden in shadow.

                    Negative!  No reports of Time Lord. 
                    We are beyond the Doctor's reach!

      CUT TO CU of a black & silver DALEK base, gliding forward...

                                      VOICE
                      Fascinating.  If I had not elevated
                    you beyond crude emotions, I could
                    almost mistake that tone for one
                    of victory.  Beware your pride.

      Travelling up, to find CU HAND.  A metal hand, chrome,
      jointed fingers, poised over switches built into the base.

                                      SUPREME DALEK OOV
                    The Doctor cannot stop us!

                                      VOICE
                    And yet, Dalek Caan is uneasy.

      The HAND flicks a switch.

      A SPOTLIGHT SLAMS ON, far end of the chamber, throwing
      into harsh relief, on a plinth of its own, a holy relic...

            DW4 - Ep 12 - Pink
      A weird shape.  A Dalek that's been opened, gutted and
      melted, its harsh lines now curved and warped; DALEK CAAN.

                                      SUPREME DALEK OOV
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    The Abomination is insane.

                                      VOICE
                    Show respect.  Without Dalek Caan,
                    none of this would be possible. 
                    And he speaks only the truth. 

      CUT CLOSER.  In the middle of the warped, open shell sits
      a DALEK MUTANT, tentacles stirring. This creature is more
      distorted than ever, its skin bubbled.  One blind eye
      staring out; voice ancient, sing-song, mad.

                                      DALEK CAAN
                    ...he is coming.  The threefold
                    man, he dances in the lonely places. 
                    Oh, creator of us all.  The Doctor
                    is coming...

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Lights low, quiet, all strangely calm.  JUDOON, one
      UNHELMETED, standing back, on guard.  THE DOCTOR hunched
      over the terminal, hard at work, but frustrated, getting
      nowhere, with the SHADOW ARCHITECT beside him.

      But all this seen from a distance.  By DONNA.  She's
      exhausted, sits alone towards the back of the room.


                                                                (CONTINUED)Doctor Who 4 - Episode 12 - Shooting Script - 12/02/08       page 23.

      She's been crying, a little.  Wipes her face.  Sits there.

      And then...

      SLOW ZOOM into Donna.  She's just staring to the middle
      distance, lost in thought.  But as the zoom creeps closer...

      Natural sound lowers, muffled, then fading to nothing... 

      Bring in a new sound...

      Softly, but getting stronger...

        A heartbeat.

      Closer on Donna, staring...

      Louder...

      She snaps out of it as someone steps into foreground -
      It's an ALBINO SERVANT.  A gaunt, white woman, 20's, red
      eyes, humble, black robes.  She offers Donna a china bowl.

                                      ALBINO SERVANT
                    You need sustenance.  Take the
                    water.  It purifies.

      Donna takes the bowl.  But the Albino stays, staring.

                                      ALBINO SERVANT
                    There was something on your back.

                    How d'you know that?

                                      ALBINO SERVANT
                    You are something new. 

                                      DONNA
                    Not me, love.  I'm just a temp. 
                      Shorthand, filing, 100 words per
                    minute, fat lot of good that is
                    now.  I'm no use to anyone.

                                      ALBINO SERVANT
                    I'm so sorry for your loss.

                                      DONNA
                    Yeah.  My whole planet's gone.

                                      ALBINO SERVANT
                    I mean the loss that is yet to
                    come.  God save you.

      The Albino walks away, Donna unnerved - then, calling across -

                    The Tandocca Scale is a series of

                    by Migrant Bees.  Infinitely small!

      No reply.  The Doctor's frozen, standing still, lost.

      In all three locations.  (Sc.63, 64, 65 now continuing,

      Harriet leans forward, presses a button.

      On Mr Smith's screen, Gwen's terminal, and the Nobles'
      computer, the image divides into four; displaying COMPUTER
      POVs of HARRIET, TORCHWOOD, SARAH JANE, the fourth square
      still just white noise.  (Rose, Sylvia & Wilf staring at
      the same display, listening to every word, unable to
      communicate - everything they say goes unheard.)

                    He did.  And I've spent a long
                    time wondering about that.  Whether
                    I was wrong.

                    I knew, one day, the Earth would
                    be in danger, and the Doctor would
                    fail to appear.  I told him so
                    myself.  And he didn't listen.

                    single, simple Dalek succeeded
                    where Emperors and Time Lords
                    failed.  A testament, don't you
