Officer Sharon Pogue is driving the car. It is two years
since we saw her at the accident site. Her partner,
ROBBY LEWIS, sips coffee and keeps one eye on the CAD
monitor which lists all area police calls. She slows
behind a car that is crawling along, an old 60s car,
driven by a young man and woman who sit very close on the
bench seat. The car's ENGINE is MISSING and smoking.
SHARON
That car is older than they are.
ROBBY
'67 Chevy Impala.
SHARON
That's what I said.
(CONTINUED)
3.
CONTINUED:
ROBBY
Needs a servicing.
SHARON
Don't we all.
Robby nearly spits his coffee, laughing at what Sharon
has said and trying not to choke. Sharon smiles, shaking
her head.
SHARON
Get it together, officer.
As Robby smiles, Sharon looks ahead at the young couple
who each have an arm around the other. She is stroking
his neck. He is making gentle circles in her hair.
Sharon watches this, and for a moment her eyes reveal a
depth that may be loneliness, but she quickly pushes her
thoughts away and hits the HORN, startling Robby and
startling the people ahead who now disengage and drive
on.
ROBBY
Jesus, Pogo! Almost spilled my
coffee again! You didn't like his
hair, or what?
SHARON
I love Elvis hair. They were
going two damn miles an hour.
But Robby's eyes have caught something on the monitor.
ROBBY
Let's roll to this -- fight in
progress.
As Robby secures that coffee cup, Sharon hits the SIREN
and speeds around the car in front of them.
Sharon's on the radio to dispatch as Robby drives and the
Kid keeps mouthing off.
SHARON
(to radio)
Three Adam Five -- show us 1019 to
the jail with one male prisoner.
KID
Take off your uniform. Take off
my handcuffs, bitch, and come back
here. I want one touch.
ROBBY
Give it a rest!
Sharon is stone-faced through this.
(CONTINUED)
6.
CONTINUED:
KID
If you're going to put me away,
you gotta give me one sweet touch.
As Robby and Sharon bring their suspect to the booking
counter, each holding one of his cuffed arms. The Kid is
looking at Sharon's hand on his arm.
KID
That ain't the touch.
That ain't
the touch I want.
They get him to the counter.
ROBBY
As I remove your cuffs, I want you
to put your hands here. Spread
your legs. More.
As they remove the cuffs, the Kid makes a sudden move
toward Sharon, reaching between her legs -- but she was
not only ready for this, but hoping for it -- and the
stoniness of her face cracks into fierce anger as she
moves quickly and grabs the Kid by the hair, bringing his
face into her upraised knee. He cries out and goes down
on his knees, hurting and bleeding. The jailer rushes
over to help, but Robby grabs the Kid's wrists.
ROBBY
That's it.
Back off, John, we got
it.
Robby glances at Sharon -- a dark glance.
She is on the floor using an exercise rig, sliding into
crunches, pushing herself, sweating, alone. We BEGIN
DRIFTING TO the rain-spattered window as night sounds
filter in, HORNS, SOMEONE SHOUTING, a CAR MOVING BY with
THUNDEROUS BASS MUSIC that pulses the very air and
RATTLES the LOOSE GLASS of her window.
Catch is arriving home, soaking wet. He lives in a
slightly-seedy three-story. As he walks down the
corridor toward his apaprtment, he passes a neighbor's
door and notices a set of keys dangling from the lock.
He pauses -- and then knocks softly on the door.
Someone looks through the peephole and then opens the
door -- a young single mother, friendly but with a little
caution, too. She recognizes Catch. Behind her is a
little boy, (five). The woman's name is CANDACE. Her
son is TOMMY.
CANDACE
Hi.
CATCH
Hi.
Your keys are in the...
He gestures, and she sees the keys and retrieves them,
more friendly now.
CANDACE
Oh, thank you. Thanks a lot.
God. I was trying to carry Tommy
and all these bags. He was so
tired. Of course, as soon as I
put him down he had all this
energy...
While she is talking, Catch is staring deeply at the boy,
who is shy. Catch almost speaks to the boy, wants to,
goes halfway to a smile -- but the sight of the kid stirs
that layer of darkness in Catch. He nods a good-bye to
the mother and is about to go. She thinks about this, as
he is turning, and pushes through her remaining caution
to say...
CANDACE
Y'know, we were just baking
nectarine bars because the peaches
weren't ripe. Ever had a
nectarine bar?
He smiles and seems to want to stay, but he is already
retreating. His contact goes only so far -- and no
further.
CATCH
Sorry.
Gotta be going.
And with one more glance at the boy, he walks to his
apartment, unlocks it and steps in.
11.
He walks into a bare living room -- no chairs, tables,
lamps, nothing on the walls. He walks into a spotless,
never-used kitchen and flips on the light, opens a
drawer.
In the drawer is a collection of kids' toys, some found,
some purchased, mostly plastic figures. The action of
opening the door has started some battery-operated
animals moving around in there. Now from his pocket he
takes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it in
and closes the drawer.
He walks back into the living room. He sits on the
floor, leans back against the wall, his clothes still
soaked from the rain. He stares at his thoughts, looking
a bit numb -- and lost.
Sharon is just leaving with a clean uniform on a hanger
in a plastic bag. It's a neighborhood place where
alterations are done. As she is leaving, an older woman
is just entering. This is MRS. VANDER, beaming at
Sharon, a real talker.
MRS. VANDER
Sherry!
SHARON
Hi, Mrs. Vander. You're looking
good.
MRS. VANDER
Oh, you just wait. I splurged.
She is pulling a new blue dress out of a shopping bag.
MRS. VANDER
It's for the church and the party.
It's just a little too long.
SHARON
Looks great.
MRS. VANDER
Y'know, I cried over the
invitation -- just imagine me in
church.
(laughs)
It'll be so good to spend time
with you.
(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:
Sharon forces a smile -- but is mystified. Mrs. Vander
is walking to the counter and pausing to say...
MRS.
VANDER
You know Dan and I
renewed our
vows last year. I
bet that's
where your mom got
the idea.
SHARON
Their vows?
MRS. VANDER
Your mom and dad -- the
ceremony...
Mrs. Vander realizes what's going on and stammers on,
sympathetic and embarrassed.
MRS. VANDER
Oh, well... y'know, I just got
that invitation a few... just now,
so I'm sure you'll...
SHARON
Oh, yeah. We've had... there's
been some problems with the mail
in our building, so... I'll
probably get it today.
They're both covering like mad, both realizing Sharon's
been left out.
SHARON
So, I guess I'll see you.
MRS. VANDER
Sure, honey.
I'll see you there.
Sharon leaves -- Mrs. Vander staring after her, feeling
bad. As Sharon walks away, we see her forced smile die,
replaced by an old pain and darkness.
ELANORA CHU, 60, is an attractive woman with warmth and
intelligence in her eyes. She is in a wheelchair, at a
writing table where she carefully translates an English
text into Chinese characters.
She glances up as Catch opens the front door and heads
for the kitchen, speaking as he goes, not looking at her
or into the living room at all.
CATCH
I got you nectarines because the
peaches are hard as rocks.
ELANORA
Your jacket's all dirty.
She rolls away from the table in her motorized chair --
and as they speak across the house, she performs a
ritual...
CATCH (O.S.)
I tackled a guy.
Elanora is moving about the living room, picking up
framed photographs and turning them face down. We don't
see what -- or who -- is in these photos. She is turning
them all in a routine way, used to this.
ELANORA
Why would you 'tackle' a guy?!
CATCH (O.S.)
Why do you think?
Catch is at the cupboards, putting away groceries as
Elanora rolls into the kitchen, her CHAIR HUMMING.
CATCH
He had the ball. He was going for
a touchdown.
ELANORA
Can you be serious?
(CONTINUED)
22.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
(as he works)
What day is today?
ELANORA
Wednesday.
CATCH
No.
They are not smiling at their little jokes, but they have
an ease with each other and the deep love of dear
friends. He doesn't pause in his work, but we can see
some nervousness in him as he says...
CATCH
Met somebody today.
Mrs. Chu is now taking some of the groceries out of the
bags to help.
ELANORA
Oh? That's good. Ahh -- they had
the broccolini today. Thank you.
CATCH
A woman.
Elanora is more interested and curious now, still helping
with the groceries and being casual.
ELANORA
You didn't tackle her, too, did
you?
CATCH
No.
ELANORA
Good, Catch.
CATCH
She's a police officer.
ELANORA
(stops; worried)
Are you in trouble?
Catch goes on working, a depth in his eyes.
CATCH
No.
No trouble.
(CONTINUED)
23.
CONTINUED:
Elanora watches him work and gladdens slightly.
We see
her own depth of feeling.
ELANORA
Well... that's a good thing.
He is still working, but his eyes are on his thoughts,
his struggle.
CATCH
I saw her once a long time ago.
Elanora stares a moment.
This has meaning for her.
ELANORA
Where?
He doesn't answer.
He's nervous about this.
CATCH
She looks the same.
Now she watches him as he moves to the refrigerator and
continues his work in silence.
It's a noisy restaurant with a large bar area. We PAN TO
a booth of off-duty cops, out of uniform now, including
Ray, Sanchez, Sharon and a few more male officers.
They're all a bit high. Sharon shows the signs, too.
They are passing around a photo now as one COP looks at
it and says...
COP
Beautiful.
... And Sanchez says proudly.
SANCHEZ
Yeah. My wife's got him in
agility class.
RAY
No shit.
Ray is handed the photo, and we see that they're talking
about Sanchez's dog, the name "REX" printed on the photo.
(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED:
RAY
'Rex.' Rex is good. I wonder who
the first person was to name a dog
'Fido,' and what the hell does it
mean?
SHARON
I like how you're always asking
the big questions, Ray.
There is some laughter.
Ray is a smart-ass and a flirt.
RAY
I got a big question for you, Pogo
-- but I can only ask it when
we're alone.
She moves some of the change on the table, sliding it
toward Ray.
SHARON
Here -- use this -- call your wife
and ask her instead.
SANCHEZ
I happen to know Ray's wife is
busy tonight.
They laugh and drink and Ray asks her...
RAY
Why doesn't your partner ever come
out with us?
SHARON
Robby's a family man.
RAY
I'm a family man.
SHARON
Yeah, but his family actually
likes him.
More laughter. Sharon's eyes do a quick roam of the bar.
Ray catches this.
RAY
That Lambert -- I guess he's not
showing either.
She shrugs this off like it's not important and starts to
slide out of the booth.
(CONTINUED)
25.
CONTINUED:
RAY
Where are you going?
SHARON
The head.
Do you mind?
SANCHEZ
She's just gonna freshen up her
makeup.
RAY
You're wearing makeup?
She leaves the booth with a wry frown.
SHARON
That reminds me, Ray. You still
have that eye-liner you borrowed
from me?
She grins, leaving the laughter behind her.
ANGLE - DOOR
Catch has entered the bar. He is watching Sharon leave
the booth and walk to the rest rooms. He looks back at
the raucous booth and hesitates. He sits at a small
table near the door.
Sharon is drying her hands in the bar's bathroom, staring
into the mirror. No smile now. We see into her mind for
a second.
FLASHBACK - MAN
Pointing the gun at her face today.
BACK TO SHARON (PRESENT)
in the mirror and see how shaken she still is.
ON CATCH
A waitress is leaving his table, and he looks back at
Sharon's booth and sees that she still isn't there. He
starts to turn, and then freezes as he hears...
(CONTINUED)
26.
CONTINUED:
SHARON (O.S.)
There you are.
She has stepped out of the bathroom and spotted him.
He
is surprised, face to face now.
SHARON
We thought you wouldn't show.
Why
you sitting here?
He shrugs.
CATCH
I don't talk to a lot of people.
Would you...?
He half rises and gestures to the other chair. She
glances back at her booth, then sits. She's nervous,
too.
SHARON
I didn't have a chance to thank
you. I'm Sharon Pogue.
She puts out her hand. He stares at that hand for just
half a beat before taking it. They shake. The feel of
her hand holding his evokes the memory of the accident,
but he covers this.
SHARON
You look familiar.
CATCH
I guess I live on the beat you
patrol.
Her way to cover nervousness is to be blunt, even tough.
SHARON
Why would you do that -- jump a
man with a gun?
CATCH
(shrugs)
He was going to shoot you.
SHARON
He could've shot you. You have a
death wish? You a bungee jumper?
CATCH
No. I didn't have time to think
about it.
(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
What d'you think about it now?
CATCH
I figure... it was worth the risk.
SHARON
For someone you don't even know?
CATCH
Yeah -- and for what you do. I
think cops are great. Out there,
trying to keep it safe. You know?
Tough job. Firemen are
everybody's heroes. Kids wave at
firemen. People should wave at
cops. Did you ever think about
how many people are walking around
this town because you saved them?
SHARON
I never thought about it.
CATCH
... because you helped them or
because you arrested somebody who
would've hurt them or because you
just... did your job?
SHARON
Now I'm walking around this town
because of you. Ever think about
that? Maybe you should be a cop.
CATCH
I don't know... I look pretty dumb
in a hat...
He has made her smile.
CATCH
... and I don't drive and, like I
said, I don't talk to many people.
Am I talking too much? I am. You
go ahead.
SHARON
Okay. What d'you do? You
employed around here? Oh, God.
Sorry. Every time I try to talk
to somebody, it comes out like an
interrogation.
(CONTINUED)
28.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
Where do you want to be ten years
from now?
SHARON
What?
CATCH
Somebody taught that to me. Kind
of a shortcut. You ask somebody,
what are your plans for
tomorrow -- what're your dreams
for ten years from now. It's
supposed to get things started.
SHARON
Does it work?
CATCH
I never tried it.
SHARON
Bullshit.
CATCH
No. Really. I just remembered it
-- God is my witness.
SHARON
Not in here.
It's mostly cops.
Now she has made him smile, the first real smile we've
seen from Catch. It's open and real and she is charmed
by it.
SHARON
You have a nice smile.
She's a bit self-conscious, saying that, and just as she
says it, the waitress arrives with shots and beers for
both of them. Sharon looks up, questioning, and the
waitress nods toward the booth. Catch and Sharon see the
cops, staring, smiling, raising their glasses. There is
a hint of teasing in their grins. And now Sharon is more
self-conscious, and a bit tough again, taking her drink
and turning back to Catch.
SHARON
So... what were we talking about?
Oh, yeah, you were giving me some
line about starting a
conversation.
(CONTINUED)
29.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
The shortcut.
SHARON
Okay.
I'll play.
They clink glasses and drink.
Then...
SHARON
Tomorrow I've got a night watch
shift. If the weather clears, in
the morning I'll go hiking. If it
rains, I'll go to the gym -- and
the laundromat. Ten years from
now... I want to be living in some
mountainous place.
CATCH
Tibet?
SHARON
Could be Tibet. Could be
Colorado. Your turn.
But now Ray Juliette is approaching the table.
RAY
Hey, Pogo -- don't keep him all to
yourself. Come on over, Lambert,
join the group. We'll buy you
dinner, give you a medal for
saving Pogo's ass.
Sharon drains her shot and stands.
SHARON
Actually, I'm kind of tired, Ray.
I'm taking off.
CATCH
Oh.
I'll... walk you to your car.
Catch stands and turns to Ray.
CATCH
Thanks for the drink.
RAY
Least we could do. We don't like
her very much -- but we don't want
to lose her.
Sharon frowns and waves to the booth of cops.
Ray smiles
and shakes hands with Catch as a good-bye.
(CONTINUED)
30.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
Take care.
And Catch and Sharon leave.
As they get in and she STARTS the ENGINE.
CATCH
I'm on Lundy Street, just off
Pico.
They drive a while. She notices his anxiety.
He grips
the armrest when she speeds up.
SHARON
I'm good at this.
CATCH
Streets are wet.
SHARON
Are you one of those people who
drive ten miles an hour in the
rain? I hate that.
CATCH
I never drive.
She glances at him, and he notices her glance.
CATCH
I'll be alright.
(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:
He's forcing himself to relax. He takes a deep breath,
sitting back in his seat. He watches her as she drives.
After a moment...
CATCH
Y'know, I can picture you in
Colorado.
SHARON
Oh yeah?
What am I doing there?
CATCH
Driving around... pissed off.
She smiles in spite of herself, slows down.
SHARON
I'm not pissed off at you.
CATCH
Give me some time.
Now she laughs. She drives, not to his building, but to
her own street. She parks, takes a deep breath. This
sounds a bit hard-bitten because she's using her
toughness to cover.
SHARON
Those guys
in the bar are my
friends --
sort of. We work
together,
we tell jokes and we
bullshit,
but I can't say to
them...
She halts.
CATCH
What?
She says this clipped and fast and even tougher:
SHARON
Every time I close my eyes, I see
that goddamn gun pointing at me
and I don't know why I'm telling
you unless it's because you were
there and because I had three
drinks, but I'm not ready to go
inside and close my eyes and I
don't want to go to your place and
I don't want to keep driving
around, so what the hell do we do?
(CONTINUED)
33.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
Whew. I feel like we're boxing,
and you've got me on the ropes.
(pause)
We'll do whatever you want.
SHARON
What I want
is to know how you
happened to
be walking by that
parking lot
at that minute. What
if you hadn' t been there?
For a moment, she shows her fear.
CATCH
I guess we were supposed to meet.
They stare a while, then she opens her door.
SHARON
If you want -- you can come in for
a minute.
As they walk in, she moves into the kitchen.
SHARON
Want a drink?
CATCH
No thanks.
She pours one for herself while he looks about. It's a
stiff drink. Now that he's here, her I-don't-want-to-
make-a-fool-of-myself alarm is on. She flops on the
sofa, watches him.
SHARON
Sit down or something.
CATCH
I'm circling awhile.
He's looking around at the clutter of her life -- the
intimate details.
SHARON
You're not supposed to look
around. I didn't have time to
straighten up.
(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
So... it's more real this way.
SHARON
It's rude.
He turns to her.
CATCH
Now that I'm in here, you seem mad
about it.
SHARON
I'm not mad. You'll know when I'm
mad. I don't usually let somebody
in here, but here you are. That's
all. Let's talk about something
stupid.
CATCH
You first.
She smiles in spite of herself.
SHARON
Okay -- one thing I don't believe
is that 'supposed to' business.
We were 'supposed to' meet. That
sounds a little fringy to me, like
something you might hear on public
access TV. You believe that?
CATCH
Some people say we each give off a
particular odor -- that can only
be detected by one other person's
brain.
SHARON
So, we... smell each other?
Who
says that?
CATCH
I have no idea.
(as they smile)
I'm more in the destiny school,
we-met-in-another-life school. Do
you believe that? Do you think
when we die -- we come back in
another form?
(CONTINUED)
35.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
You mean like
a duck? No. I
think dead is
dead. I've been
thinking about
it all day -- and I
don't want to
think about it
anymore.
He looks at her, steps close to her, takes the drink out
of her hand, puts it to his lips and drinks it all down.
He puts the glass on the table.
SHARON
Why'd you do that?
CATCH
See?
Now you're thinking about
me.
She gets a half smile, assessing him. Her look is
direct, and the attraction is there. He feels it, too,
and he deflects it, nodding toward a large photomural of
snowcapped mountains.
CATCH
Let me guess.
Colorado.
SHARON
It's Austria, but I can't picture
myself in Austria. I'm not good
with languages, so I couldn't
qualify for the departments over
there.
She rises and goes to a desk and takes the holstered gun
off her ankle. She takes the cuffs off her belt, the
mace from her jacket, the shield from her shirt pocket,
puts them all in a desk drawer. She takes off her jacket
and throws it over a chair. Disarmed, she turns to him.
Her look is all wanting and pushing away, almost fierce
in her struggle. He sees this.
SHARON
Thanks for... coming up here.
CATCH
Does that mean I'm going?
SHARON
(flustered)
No.
You don't have to.
I...
CATCH
You okay now?
(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:
Her eyes grow a bit hard, defensive.
SHARON
Oh.
You're here as a medic.
CATCH
Is this the mad part?
She smiles in spite of herself -- again. He has gotten
to her. She wants to fall into this guy, but she's
pumping those brakes. They are standing close together.
SHARON
Maybe going is a good idea.
CATCH
Can I come back some time?
SHARON
Why?
CATCH
(shrugs)
Must be the smell.
That makes her laugh, and her resistance falls away with
her surprised laughter, and she puts her hands around the
back of his neck. Her touch is electric to him. She is
going in for a kiss, and he is retreating. They stare a
moment -- and then he suddenly takes her shoulders and
lets loose his own longing. It is a hungry and
passionate kiss, and in the very midst of it, he breaks
off and pulls back, his darkness rushing at him. She is
staring, surprised, and he is looking a bit shaken,
getting the words out just above a whisper.
CATCH
I better go.
She doesn't know what to say. The moment hangs. He
leaves. Once he closes the door, the breath escapes her,
and she shakes her head -- feeling like an idiot. She
lost control. With a stranger.
SHARON
Oh, God.
Candace, Catch's neighbor, is waiting for the slow,
RATTLING ELEVATOR with her son.
(CONTINUED)
39.
CONTINUED:
The elevator door opens -- and there is Catch, seated on
a newly-bought wicker chair in the elevator with a small
table across his lap, other boxes nearby and a
long-stemmed rose in his hand, wrapped for giving.
CATCH
Oh.
Sorry.
He rises and hurriedly gets his purchases off the
elevator so the woman and little boy can enter.
CANDACE
Shopping day?
He smiles at her, a bit less subdued than before as he
gets his things into the hall -- and he manages a special
look for Tommy, a wink. He frees the elevator; they step
inside. As the door starts to close, Catch's face
"follows" the sliding door with a funny look for the boy.
We hear Tommy laugh as the door closes. Catch carries
his new possessions to his apartment.
As they enter.
(CONTINUED)
40.
CONTINUED:
It's a bit dark inside, older furniture, lots of keepsake
clutter and photos. Sharon is restless in here -- bad
memories.
SHARON
Looks the same. Still smells like
cigarettes. I thought he quit.
MOTHER
He's down to six a day.
SHARON
Your hair looks nice.
Her Mother touches her hair, self-consciously. She can't
help glancing at her daughter in all that gear --
bullet-proof vest under her shirt, radio, cuffs -- and
that gun.
MOTHER
Are you well?
Sharon steps close to the mantel. There is a photo of
her there, graduating from the police academy, a
professional, not a family shot. She is surprised.
SHARON
I guess I'm well. Is this always
here?
MOTHER
Yes.
It's always there.
SHARON
Did Larry tell you I came by where
he's working? Is that why you
called me?
MOTHER
I called because we want to invite
you to our renewal of vows. It's
three weeks from Saturday.
SHARON
Who's 'we.'
You said 'we' want to
invite you.
MOTHER
The family.
Sharon takes that in, still looking about.
(CONTINUED)
41.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
How come you're renewing your
vows?
MOTHER
It's sort of... a fresh start.
SHARON
Your idea?
MOTHER
No. Both of us. It's a way of...
having the marriage blessed.
SHARON
Wasn't it blessed before?
Her Mother sighs, sad for all the trouble between them.
MOTHER
Sherry... of course it was
blessed. You just...
SHARON
I just what, Mom?
MOTHER
You just think about the bad, and
you never remember the good. I
wish you remembered the good.
Sharon stares deeply at her.
SHARON
Sorry.
I wish I did, too.
(then, almost
like a child)
Does he? Remember any good about
me?
MOTHER
Of course. He doesn't hate you.
He just... still feels hurt.
SHARON
Hurt?
I hurt him?
MOTHER
Being arrested like that.
Somebody doesn't forget that.
SHARON
Oh? How come you forgot what he
did?
(CONTINUED)
42.
CONTINUED:
MOTHER
It wasn't as bad -- you always
make it sound worse. And it
hasn't been that way for years.
SHARON
I'm glad it hasn't been that way.
That means it worked, Mom. That
was the point. That's why I did
it. Christ. Why do I get
punished for it?
MOTHER
Honey, nobody's punishing you.
We're inviting you. Will you
come?
SHARON
Of course I'll come.
MOTHER
We didn't think you'd want to.
SHARON
Why not?
Now her Mother shows a trace of fear.
She says gently...
MOTHER
We don't want any trouble... on
that day. Please.
SHARON
Mom, I'm your daughter. I don't
want any trouble -- ever. I'll
come to the ceremony. I won't
come to argue, and I won't come in
uniform.
They each get a small, sad smile.
MOTHER
It's on the 23rd. Saint Monica's.
SHARON
I'd like you to send me an
invitation. Mrs. Vander said it's
a beautiful invitation.
Her Mother starts to leave the room.
MOTHER
I'll show you.
(CONTINUED)
43.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
Mom. I'd like to get one... in
the mail... from my family. Okay?
MOTHER
Yes.
Sharon goes to the door, then stops and turns, letting
her guard down all the way to say...
SHARON
Tell Dad... thanks.
And she leaves.
Sharon is dressed for bed in a sleep shirt, lying on the
bed, surrounded by old photos and a couple of photo
albums from her girlhood. In a vase on her bed table is
Catch's rose.
Sharon is feeling blue, looking at her young self within
the family that has shut her out. She closes the book,
angry at herself for nearly crying. She sits up and
catches sight of the rose and rummages in the drawer and
pulls out the tape with Catch's phone number on it.
She's very conflicted
about this. She puts the tape
down, but it sticks to
her fingers. She tears it off and
tries to throw it onto
the table, but it hangsoff her
thumb. She sighs and
steels herself and dialsthe
number.
He has bought a shelf unit that "needs some assembly" and
he's at work with a screwdriver, his new chair and table
nearby, the phone on the floor. PHONE RINGS, and he
picks it up.
44.
FULL SHOT
As we INTERCUT the call:
SHARON
Do you have a machine?
CATCH
What?
SHARON
Do you have an answering machine?
CATCH
Yes.
SHARON
Will you hang up please, and I'll
call your machine.
CATCH
Why?
She hangs up. He stares at the phone a moment,
bewildered. He hangs up, and his PHONE RINGS. He lets
it ring. His MACHINE comes on with no recording, only a
BEEP.
SHARON
Hi. Maybe we can... have
breakfast or something. I get up
early and run in Ballard Park.
There's a Denny's across from the
park. Like eight or so. If
you're there, you're there.
She hangs up, sighs a heavy one.
SHARON
Oh, God.
And she falls back on her bed.
Catch walks in, glances at the clock. It's 7 A.M. He's
nervous -- and excited. He takes a seat where he can
watch the park, the runners. He waits.
She has tossed and turned all night. She is awake,
turning to look at her clock-radio. It is 7:14. She
raises a hand over it.
(CONTINUED)
45.
CONTINUED:
It changes to
7:15 and the RADIO COMES ON.
She slams her
hand down on
it, cutting it OFF. She lays
back and
heaves a sigh
that becomes a moan, sits up
again and
picks up the
phone, dials the number on the
tape.
SHARON
Hi, don't pick up. Look, I didn't
sleep much and anyway this is a
bad idea. I was feeling funky
last night and I'm all right now
so let's just leave it where it's
at. Bye. Oh, thanks for the...
Bye.
She hangs up and lays back down and pounds her head into
the pillow and covers herself, even her head, with the
sheet.
Catch is waiting, watching out the window.
It's 8:05,
until we...
DISSOLVE TO:
... and now it's 8:38, and Catch is still waiting and
watching.
She is still in bed, under the sheet. Someone begins
KNOCKING on her door and she sits up, bleary and
frustrated.
SHARON
Damn it!
She stumbles out of the bedroom to her door.
SHARON
What?!
Who?!
CATCH (O.S.)
It's me.
SHARON
Oh, Jesus.
(CONTINUED)
46.
CONTINUED:
She opens the door.
He wears a stern look.
She is not
apologetic.
SHARON
I was just falling asleep.
Finally.
CATCH
We made a date.
SHARON
It wasn't a 'date.'
CATCH
Okay, an 'appointment.'
I keep my
appointments.
She gives an exasperated moan and turns to stagger back
to bed. He closes the door and follows.
SHARON
I called you.
I called you at
seven.
CATCH
I get up early. I walked there.
I waited there.
SHARON
Check your messages.
She heads for the bed, passing a
mirror, looking at her
rumpled self and groaning at the
sight.
She climbs into
bed and snuggles there and puts
the sheet over her head.
He is entering the bedroom. He
carries a Denny's take-
out bag.
SHARON
(under the sheet)
I need more sleep. Come back in a
month.
CATCH
Come back? What makes you think
I'd come back here?
The lump under the sheet says...
SHARON
Then why are you here?
(CONTINUED)
47.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
I'm here to tell you that when you
tell someone you're going to be
somewhere then that someone
rearranges his life and you should
be more aware of that and a lot
more considerate instead of
just...
She has come out from under the sheet and is watching
him.
SHARON
What's in the bag?
CATCH
What?
None of your business.
SHARON
Did you bring some coffee?
CATCH
You think you deserve coffee?
SHARON
What else did you bring?
Food?
CATCH
(opening the bag)
You definitely don't deserve food.
I've got coffee, sugar, sweetener,
non-dairy...
SHARON
Just black.
Black. Thanks.
She sits up. He hands her the coffee.
She sips,
relishing the sip, then studies him.
SHARON
So what kind of life did you
rearrange in order to get to
Denny's? You never said one word
about yourself last night. What
d'you do?
CATCH
What's the difference?
SHARON
What's the difference?! You're
standing in my bedroom. That's
the difference. Who are you?
(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
Somebody who keeps appointments.
SHARON
You're ducking. Don't duck.
(then a thought)
Oh, shit -- you're married, right?
Convinced -- she picks up one of the throw pillows from
the bed and tosses it at him.
CATCH
I'm not.
SHARON
I don't believe you.
CATCH
You don't believe me?
Give me
back the coffee.
SHARON
No.
CATCH
Give me the coffee.
She hands him the coffee. He hits her with the pillow
and hands her back the coffee. He has made her smile,
but she continues, half teasing now.
SHARON
Oh, God. Oh, wait -- you're
involved in some criminal
activity, aren't you? Great --
That's all I need.
CATCH
My name is Catch Lambert. I don't
work. I don't commit any crimes.
I like being with you. We can
start from here -- from now.
SHARON
Bullshit. I'm... I let you in
here. I'm not going to be some
fool. I need the details.
CATCH
And I need to start from here.
SHARON
That's ridiculous. Why?
(CONTINUED)
49.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
That's the way it is.
SHARON
Oh.
Your rules.
CATCH
My rules.
SHARON
Jesus. Okay. Fine. I don't
really want to know you anyway.
Goodbye.
He is conflicted -- but he won't relent. He walks to the
door. She stares, waiting. But he never turns around.
He walks out. She is mystified, exasperated. She hears
her FRONT DOOR CLOSE. She puts the coffee on her bed
table -- and finds herself staring at that damn rose.
She suddenly gets up and begins to dress hurriedly --
with a plan.
Sharon enters, looks at the elevators. It's not moving.
She goes to the stairs, listens, hears him TRUDGING UP
the stairway. She follows silently.
As Catch reaches his apartment door, unlocks it, opens it
and walks in.
50.
Before he can close the DOOR behind him, it BANGS open
wider, startling him -- and Sharon is in the doorway,
staring hard at him.
SHARON
(sarcastic)
Can I come in?
She walks in and closes the door and starts looking
around as he says...
CATCH
Yeah.
Sure.
Come in.
Despite his recent "decorating" the apartment is still
nearly empty. No books, magazines, photographs, no
clutter of life. She glances into the equally sterile
kitchen.
SHARON
You live here? Nobody lives here.
This place is some kind of front,
a scam, a drop -- or what?
CATCH
This is what you told me about --
right?
SHARON
What?
CATCH
Your interrogation.
Do I need a
lawyer?
He has made her look at herself, and take a breath.
SHARON
I just don't want to be jerked
around.
CATCH
I'm not.
SHARON
Then tell me straight out.
Who
are you?
He is silent, and she starts to leave.
Moment of truth.
CATCH
What is it you're looking for?
(CONTINUED)
51.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
Your life.
I don't want any
surprises.
CATCH
This is it. I sleep here. I walk
around town. That's all of it.
SHARON
That's all of it?
CATCH
Yeah. Except for you -- the way I
feel about you.
SHARON
Which is?
CATCH
Surprising.
I thought it was
impossible.
I thought I was...
SHARON
You thought you were what?
Gay?
CATCH
Dead.
In a way.
SHARON
I'm supposed to understand that?
CATCH
No. Did you ever wonder what
'scratch' meant, when people say,
'we'll start from scratch'? This
is scratch. We can start from
here.
She looks at him, looks at his empty place, his non-life,
and back at him again.
SHARON
I don't know.
I just don't know.
She breaks off the stare and heads for the door.
He
watches her go.
As Catch enters. She is watching TV. He does glance
into the living room briefly to throw her a quick hello
smile, before moving to the kitchen. She SNAPS OFF the
TV and begins turning the photos face down as she sends
her voice to the kitchen.
ELANORA
I remember that. That was a
smile.
He is putting groceries away as she rolls into the room.
He doesn't look at her, tries to be casual, but his
thoughts are bubbling out.
CATCH
You know the cop -- the woman cop?
She... visited me.
Mrs. Chu registers surprise at this, but keeps it covered
and casual.
ELANORA
Oh?
Where did she sit?
CATCH
I have a chair now.
ELANORA
You're... seeing her?
He darkens a bit as he works.
CATCH
She has a lot of questions.
She
wants to know everything.
ELANORA
Of course she does. Everybody
does.
CATCH
We could start from today.
What's
so wrong with that?
ELANORA
Tell her.
The can in Catch's hand bangs on the cupboard, and he
stops, suddenly uptight.
(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
Tell her what?
Mrs. Chu comes closer.
ELANORA
Tell her, Catch. Tell somebody.
It's been almost two years.
CATCH
(a warning)
Nora...
ELANORA
Every time I tell somebody, it
gets a little bit easier. I'm not
saying it goes...
His next warning is tough and absolute.
CATCH
Nora!
She is silenced. The moment hangs. She rolls her chair
to him, takes a box of cookies out of his hand, opens the
box and eats one, defusing the moment.
ELANORA
She nice?
He starts to work again.
CATCH
She's tough.
ELANORA
She pretty?
CATCH
That doesn't matter.
ELANORA
(smiles)
She is pretty.
CATCH
She's sort of pissed-off at me.
ELANORA
Apologize.
CATCH
For what?
(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:
ELANORA
It doesn't matter. We like it
when men apologize.
He stares at her a while.
CATCH
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
She smiles and hands him the box.
ELANORA
Have a cookie.
See?
Sharon is typing at the computer, dark and dogged in her
work.
Lieutenant Sanderman is watching her through the
glass wall of the watch commander's office. He comes out
of the office and moves to where Sharon is typing.
SANDERMAN
Sharon...
SHARON
(typing)
Lieutenant...
We can see the
computer screen now. Sharon is searching
for any prior
record of "Catch Lambert" -- arrests,
convictions.
She has several "Carl Lamberts" on the
screen, even a
"Casper," no Catch.
SANDERMAN
Anything bothering you?
SHARON
Why?
What'd I do?
SANDERMAN
Nothing. I'm talking about your
general attitude lately.
Sharon stops typing.
She can find nothing.
She clears
the screen, sighs.
SHARON
My attitude's fine. End of a long
day. I'm tired.
SANDERMAN
Family matters getting to you?
(CONTINUED)
55.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
Family?!
SANDERMAN
Your brother, Larry...
SHARON
What about Larry?
SANDERMAN
You know Nester -- on the Culver
City P.D.? He went out on a
violent domestic dispute
yesterday. A neighbor called it
in. It got a little ugly. No
arrest -- a warning.
This hits her hard.
SHARON
Larry.
Oh Christ.
SANDERMAN
Nester said it's not the first
time.
Sharon is quiet a while, taking it in, shaken by it.
SHARON
Thanks for telling me.
The place is messy.
A TV can be heard -- CARTOONS.
LARRY
What's up?
SHARON
Where's Kath?
LARRY
She's busy with Larry Jr. right
now.
Sharon nods, but then walks past him.
As Sharon walks into this toy-strewn room. Larry Jr. is
sitting on the floor, watching a small TV. Kathy is not
with him. Sharon kneels beside the boy a moment.
SHARON
Hey, Champ.
But he stays focused on the TV, some darkness, some
unsayable worry in his eyes. She picks up a toy car,
speaks softly.
SHARON
Y'know, they call this one a woody
'cause it has wood on the sides.
LARRY JR.
I know.
Now he looks at her with sad and bottomless eyes. She is
hurting for him. Larry is now in the doorway. Sharon
kisses the child's head and walks out, passing her
brother.
LARRY
Why'd you come by?
SHARON
To see Kathy.
As Sharon heads for the master bedroom, Larry takes her
arm.
LARRY
She's not feeling good.
(CONTINUED)
57.
CONTINUED:
Sharon pulls away from her brother.
SHARON
I'll just say hello.
Sharon walks in. Kathy is sitting on the bed, her face
badly bruised. They stare. Kathy speaks quietly, her
eyes filling.
KATHY
Don't make it worse.
SHARON
It gets worse?
KATHY
He's okay now. He's torn up about
it. Don't make him mad.
Sharon moves closer. She reaches out, touches Kathy with
a comforting touch as the woman turns her bruised face
away.
SHARON
When Larry and I were growing up,
our mother said that all the time.
'Don't make your father mad.'
(pause)
Has he hit Larry Jr. yet?
KATHY
He never would.
SHARON
Oh.
Just you, huh?
Larry is in the doorway now, angry.
LARRY
What d'you think you're doing in
my house, Shar? In my home.
She walks out of the room and he follows her.
She turns on him.
SHARON
You see a pattern here, bro?
(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED:
LARRY
I lost my temper. Things got out
of hand. It won't...
SHARON
People always say that: 'I've got
a temper.' Like it's an excuse.
LARRY
I don't need a goddamn lecture.
She comes very close to him.
SHARON
You want to hit someone?
Next
time your 'temper' flares
up, Lar,
and you just have to hit
somebody,
you go home and hit your
father.
LARRY
You blame everything on him.
SHARON
I'm blaming you, you fucking
coward.
He grabs her shirt hard.
LARRY
You don't come in here...
He pushes her into the wall.
LARRY
You don't come in here and call me
names.
SHARON
What do you call a man who uses
his wife as a punching bag?
(pause)
Coward.
He swings a slap at her. She blocks it and punches him
hard in the face, and he crashes down on the floor.
Kathy comes running, calling out...
KATHY
Don't hurt her, Lar...!
(CONTINUED)
59.
CONTINUED:
Kathy sees that it's Larry on his ass. The little boy
comes out of his room. There is a surprised moment.
Then Kathy picks up the child and takes him back to his
room. Larry is sitting up, shaken, his nose bleeding.
Sharon goes close to him, rigid with fury.
SHARON
I know how it feels, 'cause I
remember. I remember standing
between you and Dad and taking the
blows for you -- and for what?!
You turned out to be just like
him, you bastard.
(pause)
And so did I.
And she leaves the house and SLAMS the DOOR.
She is just returning home after her shift, very tired,
drained. She absently turns ON the TV, the STEREO. She
notices a blinking light on her MESSAGE MACHINE and hits
the button.
LARRY (V.O.)
I bet you feel real proud of
yourself, Shar, knocking me down
in front of my family. You know
what I've got in my hand? I've
got a Polaroid picture of my
busted-up face, and I'm thinking
of sending it to your department,
to your lieutenant. I'm going to
turn you in to the police, Shar,
and see how you like it.
The message ends.
She stands there a moment.
SHARON
(quietly)
Oh, God. Oh, shit.
She sits on the edge of a chair, worried, deep in her
thoughts, hitting bottom -- the darkness engulfing her.
In a moment, she looks at her desk, walks there, opens a
drawer, pulls out that piece of tape with Catch's number
on it -- but it is all stuck to itself. She hesitates,
then starts to pick it apart when a KNOCK at the door
makes her jump. She wonders, then, somehow, she knows.
She walks to the door.
(CONTINUED)
60.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
It's you, right?
She unlocks
and opens the door, stares at Catch, very
vulnerable,
on the very edge, her pain and fear over
Larry just
under the surface. Catch holds a box of
cookies as
an offering.
SHARON
Can you just shut up?
Just shut
up and listen.
CATCH
I didn't say anything.
SHARON
I don't want to talk. I don't
care if you have to play some game
and pretend you're a... 'angel of
mercy' or... whatever. I don't
care, but I don't want to hear
about it. All right? I don't
want to hear anything.
She steps back, allowing him in, and closes the door and
turns to him.
SHARON
It's a bad night.
He sees her pain and puts his arms around her, pushes
through his fear and holds her -- and she lays her head
on his chest. He embraces her fully, and the effect on
him goes deep, to his core, where there is both pain and
longing, but he holds on to her, even rocks her a bit.
She sighs. In a moment...
SHARON
This is good... but I'm too tired
to stand up anymore.
He walks her to the couch and has her sit, and then
slowly, gently, he "disarms" her. He lifts her leg,
takes the ankle holster and gun off, puts it on the
table. He turns her, takes the cuffs off her belt from
the middle of her back. He reaches into her pants pocket
and removes the Mace. From her shirt pocket he takes her
I.D. shield. He has her lie down on the couch now, their
faces close, eyes locked. They linger...
SHARON
You want to kiss me?
(CONTINUED)
61.
CONTINUED:
He looks a little lost, but he nods, helpless. He comes
toward her lips -- finally -- but just before they touch,
she says, softly...
SHARON
Kiss me someplace I've never been
kissed.
He's not sure what to do. He begins to look her over --
as if hunting, and she gets a soft smile. He starts
slowly toward her ear -- but she shakes her head. Her
shirt is out of her belt and her midriff bare, and he
starts to move there, but checks her with a look. She
shakes her head. He hunts. Her smile deepens a bit. He
takes her hand and turns it over, going for the soft
flesh on the underside of her forearm, and she closes her
eyes. He kisses her there softly, and then again, and
then he lavishes kisses from her wrist to the underside
of her elbow as she sighs with pleasure and draws up her
knees in a kind of sensual glow that is leading them
to... No. He stops. She looks at him, a deep look, soft
voice.
SHARON
Why do you stop? You always stop.
She has a glimpse of his mystery, the old sorrow, the
deep pain. He hugs her drawn-up knees, closing his eyes
a moment. Then he sits on the couch, puts a pillow on
his lap and raises her slightly, lays her head on the
pillow. He strokes her hair, her scalp as she closes her
eyes and sighs, slowly moving toward sleep. Our TRUMPET
MUSIC slides in here, lush and dreamy as we linger a
while, and then --
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
Just after dawn. Catch has slept on the couch. He is
beginning to awaken now as the first light strikes the
windows. The dreamy TRUMPET FADES OUT. Catch's eyes
clear, sleep replaced by thought, and he is suddenly
shaken by --
FLASHBACK - CATCH'S POV
-- a sliver of memory. But in this one, he is driving.
We see his hands on the wheel. Then his POV looks to the
side and we see an Asian-American woman seated beside
him, attractive, about his age. Her name is Annie. She
is saying something to him. We don't hear the words.
When the FLASHBACK ENDS --
62.
BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)
Catch sits up on the couch, jolted.
He gets another
sudden --
FLASHBACK - HEADLIGHTS
glaring through his windshield, blinding him. He gasps,
sitting there on the couch, but it's all over. He
stands, rattled, and he moves toward Sharon's bedroom.
Sharon is peacefully asleep. He stands over her with
troubled eyes, but this slowly changes to a loving look.
He bends close to her face. He feels her breath on him.
He wants to lie down with her -- but he raises a hand and
very gently brushes her cheek. She stirs. He does it
again. She sighs a peaceful sigh, opens her eyes. He
smiles at her.
CATCH
New day.
We've never seen the apartment flooded by sunlight like
this, all blinds open.
(CONTINUED)
69.
CONTINUED:
We START in the kitchen, staring at the drawer that is
now so loaded with toys, it won't shut. Some brightly-
painted soldiers are sticking out of the drawer.
In the living room there are two chairs now, and more
lamps and tables. Our PAN REVEALS that the dog from the
alley is sitting in the living room, watching Catch --
whom we now see is hanging a picture on the wall -- a
mountain scene. He holds the picture in one place, then
moves it to another, wondering. His fight with Sharon
still colors his mood, but he's working through it.
CATCH
Do we go for... symmetry? Or...
more off-center. Japanese.
He glances at the dog as he moves the picture.
CATCH
Are you into this? Bob?
The dog watches him.
Catch hesitates, then walks over and stands beside this
man until he -- JACK MOLINA -- looks up. Jack beams with
recognition and surprise.
JACK
Catch -- Jesus!
Catch is held back, smiling a bit, but on thin ice here,
dipping into his past.
JACK
How are you? Sit down. Been
years. You been out of town?
CATCH
(sitting)
I've been around.
Jack's smile clouds as memory kicks in.
JACK
Oh, man, I'm really sorry about
what happened. I never got a
chance to say...
Catch, with a steady look, says...
CATCH
We don't need to go there.
Jack nods a moment.
JACK
Okay. All right. So... what
d'you want, a coffee?
(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
I want my old job back.
(pause)
What d'you think?
JACK
You been workin'?
CATCH
No, but I'm up to speed.
JACK
(thinks)
Well, it's not good with Randal
anymore.
CATCH
No?
JACK
No, he's out of it, but Danny
Coley's got something going.
Wanna go see 'im?
Catch stares, nods.
CATCH
Finish your coffee.
as she lies on the bed, on her stomach, her top off, and
Catch straddles her, massaging her back and shoulder
which are sore from her tackle.
SHARON
Ow.
Ow!
CATCH
Sorry.
SHARON
No.
That's good. Deeper.
CATCH
(as he works)
How heavy was this guy?
SHARON
Like a truck.
CATCH
God.
Tractor-trailer?
SHARON
Pickup.
Ow.
Ow! That's really
good.
She begins to moan as he digs out the pain. He is
fighting against the erotic charge of this, trying to
keep it medicinal, but he's got his hands all over her
naked back, and she is moaning -- so he stops and takes a
breath.
CATCH
I better... More oil.
He reaches to the bed table and puts oil on his hands,
noticing a card that stands open on the tabletop, a very
pretty invitation.
(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
This is pretty.
SHARON
Don't get oil on it.
CATCH
Renewal of vows -- that's great.
Is this your parents?
SHARON
Yes. Just put it down.
I'm not
going.
CATCH
Why not?
She doesn't answer. He puts it down, comes back to the
slow rubbing of her shoulders, her neck. In a moment...
SHARON
If I go, my brother'll hurt
me
with the department. I got
mad
and knocked him down. All
they
need is a complaint. Just
leave
it alone and keep rubbing.
Okay?
She moans in pleasure as he rubs, trying to push all
other thoughts away.
CATCH
So... he says you can't go?
SHARON
Can't you rub without talking?
(then)
It's been bad with my family a
long time, so the hell with it
anyway. If they don't want me
there, I don't want to be there.
All right?
CATCH
All right.
(then, as he works)
Bad how?
SHARON
Oh, Jesus!
But we see her eyes turn inward toward the old pain and,
for once, she shares it.
(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
My father used to knock us around,
all of us. But I'm the one who
called the cops -- finally.
(pause)
They say I turned against the
family.
Catch works in silence a while, absorbing this, looking
at Sharon with more tenderness than ever. In a moment...
CATCH
But... they invited you.
SHARON
You don't know anything about it.
So forget it.
CATCH
Well... I know about family.
SHARON
Oh, yeah?
What about it?
CATCH
It's... a door you don't close.
SHARON
I didn't close the door.
CATCH
You're closing it now. Right?
Family invites you, you go.
Family shows up, you welcome them
in. That's family.
SHARON
Oh, sure. What if they don't
deserve it?
CATCH
Then you forgive.
SHARON
You have all the answers.
CATCH
No. I just... It seems like a
chance, doesn't it? A chance to
make things right. I'd take it.
Then you tried -- y'know? And
it's up to them.
(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:
Sharon is considering his words, but she's also deep in
her old pain, defensive, challenging.
SHARON
You close with your family?
That hits him, but he keeps rubbing her, gentle now,
looking a little lost. He doesn't answer.
SHARON
See?
So why should I listen to
you?
But as he works her back in silence, we see her facing
her pain and thinking through it.
Just after dawn. Catch is on the couch, stirring in his
sleep, in the grip of an unsettling dream. We hear what
he hears: the VOICES of his wife, his son, murmurings.
We're not sure of the words, even laughter. Catch's eyes
snap open, jolted out of sleep, but the VOICES don't
stop, and he suddenly sits up. The VOICES FADE as he
catches his breath, gulping air. He tries to calm down.
In a moment, he rises and moves to Sharon's bedroom.
He comes to the side of the bed and sees that she is
asleep. He sits on the bed and studies her, his dark
thoughts dissipating as he watches her sleep, his eyes
going deep. In a moment he begins to raise a hand to
brush her cheek -- the way awakened her before -- but he
stops before touching her. Instead, he brings his face
close to her and lightly kisses her.
She stirs. He kisses her again. She opens her eyes.
They stare at each other. She raises a limp hand and
touches his face. He begins to come close, slowly, for
another kiss. She welcomes it. They kiss on the mouth,
very tenderly. They kiss again -- deeper. They kiss
again, and she holds him, and he moves fully onto the
bed, lying over her and supporting his weight on his
elbows and kissing and kissing and letting go for once,
hungry for her because she is in his heart now, and she
is a salvation, and there is a moment when they both
pause and stare clear-eyed, acknowledging what they are
doing, and both of them abandon their fear and pain and
begin to smile, and they make love that way, smiling, as
we slowly...
DISSOLVE TO:
85.
The night of that same day finds us at this neighborhoody
place with a lot of down-to-earth atmosphere and not a
lot of noise, like Harvell's in Santa Monica -- earthy
blues and jazz from a small band in a darkish club, small
dance floor. We PAN during this slow number and ARRIVE
AT a few dancing couples, including Sharon and Catch who
mostly just hold each other and sway. When their eyes
meet, there is a lot of deep pleasure there.
The music ends. The small crowd applauds. Couples head
back to the tables, but the little band goes right into a
more up-tempo but still earthy blues. Sharon stops and
pulls Catch back onto the dance floor. He smiles and
follows.
This number has a driving beat, and, slowly, we watch
Sharon drop her inhibitions and become more and more
free
out there, and Catch is smiling and wowed by her, and
she
laughs, wowing herself, and she keeps going, getting
wild
and playful, and it's something to see. We LINGER ON
the
joy and abandon. She's earned it. They go a little
crazy, happy crazy, and in a while we...
DISSOLVE TO:
SAME - HOURS LATER
The blues club is emptying out. It's late. The band is
finishing what seems to be its last number, for the last
of thinning crowd -- including a tired, happy Sharon and
Catch who applaud the end of the number. Catch stares at
her.
CATCH
What's your favorite song?
He rises -- as if to go to the band with a request.
She
smiles, spent.
SHARON
Catch, I'm beat. So are they.
I
think they're finished.
CATCH
One more.
It's a surprise.
She watches as he leaves her, walks to the bandstand.
He
talks to the leader who is the PIANO PLAYER.
SHARON'S POV
From the instrument cases on the floor behind the piano,
Catch picks up a trumpet case, opens it. Now Sharon's
tired smile is changing to curiosity, wonder.
86.
ON CATCH
As he puts the mouthpiece on the horn, nervous, but
excited, too, speaking to the Piano Player.
CATCH
Thanks, Danny.
DANNY (PIANO PLAYER)
Gonna be good having you back,
Catch.
Catch comes to the edge of the bandstand, grinning a bit
at Sharon, at his surprise for her, nervously fingering
the horn. He puts it to his lips.
ON SHARON
Mouth-open surprise -- and then smiling with the wonder -
- and Catch begins to play, closing his eyes and
rendering a ballad, like the haunting "ANGEL EYES."
Sharon's smile slowly fades, replaced by a much deeper
look, not only because he is so good, but because he is
showing her his heart, his love and even his pain -- more
than he can show her any other way. We INTERCUT as he
opens his eyes briefly, watching her, sending her the
music, closing his eyes again to fall into the song -- as
Sharon's eyes fill at the beauty and sadness of it, and
at this look inside her man. We LINGER. Then...
DISSOLVE TO:
Sharon is asleep, alone in the tousled bed.
Catch is dressed, putting a leash on Bob, glancing into
the bedroom at Sharon.
(CONTINUED)
88.
CONTINUED:
There is love in his look, and then a passing question,
too, a residue of fear now that their relationship has
begun in full -- but it all ends up in a soft smile for
her as he walks Bob to the door. He hesitates at the
door -- then walks into the kitchen and slides open that
drawer of toys, stares at them.
Sharon is waking, sleepy. She rises, finds a robe and
slips it on, calling out softly for Catch.
Sharon sees that Catch and Bob are gone. She drifts to
the window, looks at the day, looks down at the street --
and she sees them.
SHARON'S POV
She sees Catch and Bob on their way into the park across
the street from the building.
ON SHARON
She smiles and moves into the bedroom to dress.
Catch is at home, still shaken by what happened to him in
the park. He reaches for the PHONE, punches in a number.
It RINGS and Elanora Chu picks up. Catch is deep in his
pain.
ELANORA (V.O.)
Hello?
CATCH
(softly)
Hi.
ELANORA (V.O.)
Hi! How are you? Have you been
out in this great afternoon?
Brenda took me for a walk.
She senses the silence on the other end and quiets a bit.
ELANORA (V.O.)
Anything wrong?
CATCH
I've been... remembering.
She is quiet for a moment.
ELANORA (V.O.)
Catch... This is good.
CATCH
It's awful.
ELANORA (V.O.)
No.
No, there's good to remember.
(CONTINUED)
94.
CONTINUED:
He doesn't speak, shakes his head.
ELANORA (V.O.)
Catch?
CATCH
I'll call you.
He hangs up, staring at his thoughts.
As Sharon enters, sees the man at the elevators. He gets
into an elevator, and she just misses him. She watches
the elevator indicator. It stops at two. She hurries up
the stairs.
As Sharon bangs into a hallway through the stairway door.
She looks one way, looks the other way down the long
hall, and sees the man just entering a door. She walks
to that door. It is marked "private." She knocks and
walks in.
She enters a comfortable office, many shelves, books,
couch and chairs, big desk. She hears the man's voice
from an anteroom. He's coming toward her.
PINDELLA (O.S.)
Excuse me -- that's a private
entrance...
He sees her now, sees the uniform.
(CONTINUED)
95.
CONTINUED:
PINDELLA
Oh... is there a problem?
He's calm, gentle in the eyes. She stares a moment,
trying to keep her emotions undercover.
SHARON
I'm not sure.
Who am I speaking
to?
PINDELLA
I'm Dr. Pindella.
She takes her time, afraid.
SHARON
What kind of doctor?
PINDELLA
What is this?
SHARON
Do you know a Catch Lambert?
PINDELLA
Oh.
Yes!
Is he in trouble?
SHARON
I... need to talk to you.
He glances at his watch, worried for Catch.
PINDELLA
Well, I have a patient in five
minutes. But I can...
SHARON
Are you a...?
PINDELLA
I'm a psychiatrist.
SHARON
And Mr. Lambert...
PINDELLA
My relationship with Mr. Lambert
is confidential.
She's dying inside -- but covering, lying, forcing her
way into this.
(CONTINUED)
96.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
He's your patient. He's your
patient we... know all this. This
is police business. I'm officer
Sharon Pogue -- L.A.P.D.
PINDELLA
Look... I want to help Mr. Lambert
but I can't tell you anything that
isn't public record.
SHARON
In general. In general.
He's
your patient, and he...
PINDELLA
He's not my patient. He walked
away from treatment. That was...
nearly a year ago.
SHARON
Why did he walk away?
PINDELLA
I can't discuss that, but if you
know how to reach him, I would
appreciate being able to talk to
him.
SHARON
(desperate)
You can help by just
telling me
what's in the public
record.
It'll take me half a
day to do a
search. Can you tell
me? Just...
She is unable to play this out as a "cop," her emotions
coming through. Pindella sees this. She sits on the
edge of a chair and takes a breath, speaks more softly.
SHARON
Can you please tell me what's in
the record?
He stares a moment, sympathetic -- and realizing...
PINDELLA
You were with him -- in the car.
Your uniform threw me. Are you
his friend?
She looks at him, nods.
(CONTINUED)
97.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
More.
He takes that in, leans back on the desk.
PINDELLA
I can tell you he was in an
accident, hospitalized, referred
to me as an outpatient...
SHARON
What accident?
PINDELLA
A bus... a city bus hit his
vehicle. That was a couple of
years ago. It was... an awful
thing. His family was in the van.
His wife and child. His wife's
parents...
SHARON
A bus... and a van. Where?
On...
the freeway?
Something is pulling at her memory. Her vision turns
inward, and she stops breathing for a moment --
remembering. She was there. And here we get a...
FLASHBACK - CARNAGE
A glimpse of the carnage -- what she saw, first on the
scene -- with Catch lying there. All the while Pindella
is speaking.
PINDELLA (V.O.)
I think so. Yes. Near Santa
Monica.
On the freeway. He was
severely injured but... thrown
clear.
The others were trapped in
the van.
BACK TO SHARON (PRESENT)
still in shock, looks at Pindella again.
SHARON
Survivors?
Only him?
I... don't
remember.
PINDELLA
Remember?
(CONTINUED)
98.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
(quietly)
Yes.
I was there. I was there.
Pindella stares, then...
PINDELLA
His wife's mother survived, but...
she was paralyzed.
She takes a moment, absorbing this.
PINDELLA
Elanora Chu.
She's still in town,
I believe.
SHARON
Does he... still see her?
PINDELLA
He used to. I don't know.
(pause)
I'm glad to see... he has someone
else who cares about him. I know
he's running from this. He left
all his friends, his home, his
whole life.
SHARON
He says... he doesn't remember the
accident.
PINDELLA
He lost a lot of memory. I tried
to help him with that. He
resisted. Walked away.
She stares.
SHARON
I think he remembers me.
Very subdued now, she asks...
SHARON
How does he live?
PINDELLA
He received a large settlement
from the city, but he...barely
touches it. He was a professional
musician.
She stares at him and nods.
(CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
Trumpet.
As he says that, we hear our TRUMPET MUSIC begin -- a
fast and furious MUTED TRUMPET, incredible RIFFS, and we
use this to carry us, as we...
DISSOLVE TO:
Sharon is in the report room, using the computer,
hunting. We MOVE AROUND to see her and the screen. She
is searching the police records to find the accident.
The CONTINUING TRUMPET RIFFS are the motor for this. She
suddenly stops as we FOCUS ON the name: "LAMBERT." Then
we watch her as she punches up the data and she reads.
DISSOLVE TO:
We MOVE THROUGH Sharon's nearly dark apartment, its
stillness in strange contrast to the manic TRUMPET RIFFS.
We PAN to find her curled in a chair, staring deeply,
sadly, drinking a drink. As we PAN, we DISCOVER she is
looking at that mural of the mountains and through this
to her thoughts, and then she makes a decision and rises
and goes to the phone, punches in a number.
He is sitting on his bed, back against the headboard,
sitting there fully dressed, shoes and all, knees up --
as he plays his muted trumpet, hard and fast, playing the
incredible riffs we've been hearing, playing in a driven
way, keeping his demons away. When the RING of the PHONE
breaks through, he stops suddenly. He waits. His
MACHINE CLICKS ON and BEEPS. We INTERCUT the call as
Sharon's voice comes on, subdued.
SHARON
Catch, it's me. Can you pick up?
But he sits there, waiting, listening.
SHARON
Why don't we... meet tomorrow?
I'll be in Westwood. Can you meet
me there? Westwood and Cole.
About two o'clock. Okay?
(CONTINUED)
100.
CONTINUED:
He sits there. He slowly puts the horn down. He reaches
for the phone now -- but she hangs up before he picks up
the call.
CUT TO:
She is exercising on the machine, sliding into her
crunches, fast and furious, but all the pain and sorrow
is in her eyes, and in a moment she just stops. The
TRUMPET MUSIC KEEPS GOING ON through this. She looks
over at the phone.
We PAN OVER Bob-the-Dog, watching something. We see a
few scattered sheets of music lying about, hearing
RUSTLING, and we ARRIVE AT Catch, seated on the floor,
shuffling through a stack of sheet music, driven, looking
for something. The PHONE RINGS. He ignores it. He is
opening up each chart of music, shaking it out,
searching.
Sharon's voice comes on his machine, almost hollow with
sorrow.
SHARON (V.O.)
Catch.
Can you... pick up?
(pause)
Will you call me?
He keeps searching, seeming to not even
listen. The
MACHINE CLICKS OFF. He shakes the next
music chart and
something falls out. He stares at this
piece of paper,
picks it up, slowly turns it over. It
is a picture of
himself, a man blowing a horn, drawn in
crayon by a four
or five-year-old. Catch stares at this
with a depth that
goes on forever, as the MUSIC ENDS.
107.
It's the next day, and Sharon is preparing to go to her
parents' renewal of vows. She is at the bottom -- with
Catch gone from her life -- but she is doing her best to
go through with this.
We START ON a table, looking at the invitation and next
to that is a wrapped gift. We hear Sharon moving about,
see her nervous, half-dressed, speaking to herself. In
the b.g. we hear our TRUMPET-BASED MUSIC. Very soulful.
SHARON
I just came by to... wish you
well. To... congratulate you and
wish you well. Shit.
(CONTINUED)
113.
CONTINUED:
She checks the mirror again, doesn't like the look,
starts undressing, comes back to the table with the gift
on it, wonders if she should add more decoration to the
box. She does, and as the trumpet plays on we --
CUT TO:
SHARON
dressed differently, re-wrapping the gift and then --
CUT TO:
SHARON
dressed differently, rewrapping it again and then --
CUT TO:
SHARON
sitting still in a chair, holding the gift on her lap,
looking at the clock, nervous, scared, sad.
As Sharon comes in quietly. The church is not full, but
perhaps 50 people sit in the front pews, watching the
ceremony at the altar: The priest, Mr. and Mrs. Pogue,
altar boys. Sharon moves forward and slips into a pew a
few back from the altar. The slight disturbance of
people sliding over to let her in causes a few people to
glance over.
(CONTINUED)
114.
CONTINUED:
One of them is Kathy. They trade a brief, nervous nod.
Then Kathy whispers to her husband...
KATHY
She came.
We see Larry grow tense and angry.
KATHY
Don't say anything.
Think of your
parents.
Larry doesn't look at Sharon. The little boy, looking
fine in a tiny suit and tie, and being bored, leans to
look at his aunt.
Sharon and Larry, Jr. trade a look.
She winks, then
settles back in her pew, watches.
ON ALTAR
We get our first
look at Sharon's FATHER, Carl Pogue, 62.
Standing beside
his wife, a rather big, stolid guy, taken
with the moment,
both he and his wife emotional over
this. He wears
a hearing aid. The priest is speaking.
ON SHARON
watching with a mix of feelings as the mass continues and
the vows are renewed, the priest reciting the rituals.
to that minute and, for once, we go in order and
play out
each piece of it. We see Catch driving the van,
his wife
ANNIE beside him. His son Chet is in back with
his
grandparents, Elanora and her husband. The boy
is a bit
whiny, pouty.
We INTERCUT the flashback WITH --
CATCH
at the grave, struggling through this.
CATCH
Chet... you weren't feeling so
good, remember? It was your
birthday, and you ate too much.
We see
Annie and Catch both glance back toward Chet, and
we get
present sound in this FLASHBACK scene as Catch and
Annie
both say, "What's the matter? Hm? Aww." And then
Annie
looks out the window and turns to Catch and -- we
CUT TO
Catch at the grave, his eyes filling.
CATCH
And, Annie, you said... you
said...
In the FLASHBACK we see Annie turn to him again, and this
time we hear her say, softly...
ANNIE
Slow down in the rain, all right?
We GO TO Catch at the grave, fighting tears.
CATCH
And I don't know if I slowed down.
I don't know. I hope I did,
but... I didn't always listen. I'm
sorry. I'm really sorry.
Back in the FLASHBACK, we see Annie reach around as
Elanora hands Chet to her. Then we're BACK at the grave
and INTERCUTTING so that we see Catch speaking through
his tears and we also see this tender moment played out
in the van.
CATCH
... You put him on your lap, and
he looked at me, and I made a
face. Remember? I made you
smile, Chet.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
117.
CONTINUED:
CATCH (CONT'D)
And then we all smiled, and it was
a great minute. It was. I'm
really glad... I found that
minute. No matter what.
Catch stares at the grave, in tears, as the rest of that
minute now plays out, punishing him. It lasts only about
three seconds: a bus out of control, headlights suddenly
glaring through the windshield, Catch turning the wheel,
BRAKES SCREAMING, PEOPLE SCREAMING -- and then it's over.
And Catch has been battered by the memory, and is
weeping, but has not looked away. He is still staring at
the name of his family, and he is able to say, in a
broken voice...
CATCH
I won't forget... anymore.
I love
you.
He steps forward and puts his hand on the plaque, rests
it there. We STAY ON this, then in a moment, we...
DISSOLVE TO:
The renewal of vows is over, and Sharon is standing in
the aisle, nervous and not sure what to do. Guests are
up and milling about, many leaving the church. "See you
at the house." "See you at the party." Etc. A
PHOTOGRAPHER is setting a group shot at the front of the
church. Mr. and Mrs. Pogue, Larry and Kathy and the
little boy...
PHOTOGRAPHER
All right. The whole family in
this one. Just...
Out of the milling crowd comes Sharon, taking a breath
and braving it, walking up there, speaking quietly.
SHARON
Where do you want me?
The Photographer turns to her, wondering.
SHARON
I'm the daughter.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Oh!
Oh, well, how about...
(CONTINUED)
118.
CONTINUED:
We see the family shift so that Larry and his family are
on one side of the parents. Sharon follows the
Photographer's gesture to stand at the other side, beside
her Mother. Her Father has not looked at her. The photo
is taken. Sharon now turns to her mom and dad. This is
difficult, the strain is thick in the air.
SHARON
You both look so great.
MOTHER
(nervous)
You, too.
SHARON
I just wanted to...
The Father speaks to her, his voice not hard, but flat,
not warm either. No smile.
FATHER
You coming to the party?
SHARON
Sure.
He nods, then turns to greet well-wishers. Sharon is
left alone by the drifting away of the family, but one
old couple greets her, the older woman (Mrs. Vander)
wearing her new blue dress, her HUSBAND beaming beside
her.
MRS. VANDER
Sherry!
Look how nice you look.
HUSBAND
Big police officer now.
SHARON
Not so big.
(to Mrs. Vander)
Nice dress.
Sharon moves off toward a side exit, trying to catch up
with Larry and his family.
We're in the midst of the party. We see Sharon drifting
a bit, a hello here and there. She feels out of place.
(CONTINUED)
120.
CONTINUED:
Though the home and yard are thick with people, there is
some tension, especially in the core group -- all who
know about the estrangement of Sharon. Now and then a
nervous glance from her mother is directed at Sharon, or
a hostile glance from Larry.
Sharon passes the videographer, who is pointing light,
camera and microphone at the Vanders -- having them put
their good wishes on tape. She smiles, then looks over
and sees her Father across the room. He is alone. She
steels herself and heads his way. He makes eye contact,
then averts his look. She is approaching him, about to
speak, when he walks up to some friends and starts joking
with them, leaving Sharon hurt, humiliated.
Her mother has seen this and comes to her, speaking
quietly, nervously.
MOTHER
Don't make him talk about...
anything today.
SHARON
Mom, I was going to fix his tie.
His tie is crooked.
She sighs, pushing through her hurt to say...
SHARON
It was a nice ceremony.
MOTHER
(worried)
Yes. We're running out of
chicken, though. Nobody's eating
the ham.
SHARON
It's a great party, Mom.
You look
happy.
Some joy is allowed to surface in her Mother's face.
SHARON
Thirty-five years and still in
love, huh?
Her Mother's look clouds a little, nervous again.
MOTHER
You think that's wrong, don't you?
SHARON
Of course not...
(CONTINUED)
121.
CONTINUED:
MOTHER
I always... I feel like
apologizing to you. But I love
him.
SHARON
I know.
MOTHER
And then I feel like apologizing
to him for loving you. I'm the
one in the middle. I'm the only
one in this family who knows how
to forgive anybody.
And she walks away. Sharon's eyes follow her, surprised
and thoughtful. She watches her Mother approach her
Father and straighten his crooked tie. Then Kathy is
moving toward Sharon. Sharon turns to her and they both
speak quietly -- at the same time.
BOTH
You look great.
Then they smile sad smiles.
Kathy gestures to her face,
the faded bruise.
KATHY
Tons of makeup. On Larry, too.
They smile wryly again.
SHARON
Sorry about that, but... I
couldn't stand him doing that to
you. I took it on...
KATHY
Don't worry. I'm not your mother.
If he tries it again, I'm gone.
I'm out of there, me and Larry
Junior. He knows that.
They stare, and Sharon gives her a hug, Kathy returns it.
ON LARRY
We see Larry, across the room, notice this hug. He keeps
his expression intact for the group he's in, but we see a
flare of anger in his eyes.
122.
ON SHARON
moving across the living room.
She sees Larry Jr. sitting alone and goes to him, sits
beside the child -- who looks sad.
SHARON
What's up with you?
LARRY JR.
They won't let me watch T.V.
SHARON
Oh. Well... let's pretend this is
T.V. It's a show about a party.
They look about the room.
SHARON
(as if it's a secret)
That man... is really a super
hero.
LARRY JR.
Is not.
SHARON
Is too. And so is she. Look.
See? Red tights under her
dress... Oh-oh, that man gave her
a drink with something in it.
LARRY JR.
With what?
SHARON
With stuff to make her sleep.
He's a bad guy.
The woman sips her drink, and the boy smiles, getting
into it.
LARRY
She drank it.
SHARON
Watch. She'll fall down any
minute.
The boy is suddenly swooped up, lifted away by his
father. Larry puts the boy down near the door.
LARRY
Hey, sport, you should go play
outside.
(CONTINUED)
123.
CONTINUED:
He turns to Sharon.
LARRY
Stay away from my family.
Then he turns to the crowd, smiling a smile without
humor, speaking loudly.
LARRY
Hey, everybody, keep it down.
Somebody might call the police.
There is some nervous laughter, people watching them now.
Sharon is angry and embarrassed, keeping her voice low.
SHARON
What're you doing?
LARRY
(to crowd)
Once the cops leave, we can really
party.
The crowd around them is all staring now -- as he turns
back to Sharon.
LARRY
Why don't you give everybody a
break -- and go home?
In the hushed tension that follows, a GLASS falls and
SHATTERS, and more people quiet down and stare. Sharon
looks at her glaring brother, looks at her Mother
nervously picking up the broken glass -- no support
there. Angry and shaken, she turns to the door.
She walks to the door, opens
it, starts to leave, starts
to close the door behind her,
and she stops, take takes a
breath, battling hard against
the old patterns of hurt
and anger. She looks at that
nearly-closed door. She
pushes it open and walks back
in.
We see a surprised and angry look from Larry, a worried
look from her Mother -- but Sharon is moving through the
crowd, searching until she sees her Father. She heads
toward him. He sees her and walks into the kitchen,
avoiding her. She follows him. We see Larry and his
Mother exchange an anxious look -- and then move toward
the kitchen.
Sharon enters, waits, others are leaving the kitchen,
leaving her alone with her dad, but he starts to follow
them.
(CONTINUED)
124.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
Don't walk away. Okay?
He acts as if he just noticed her.
FATHER
What?
She gestures toward his hearing aid.
SHARON
Is it working?
Do you need to
check it?
He absently touches the device.
FATHER
It's fine.
SHARON
Dad...
But the kitchen door opens. We hear the party going on
out there. Larry and Sharon's Mother enter, her Mother
looking at her husband and back to her daughter, very
frightened. Larry is raging in a near whisper.
LARRY
What the hell are you doing?!
MOTHER
Sharon, please.
SHARON
Please? Please what?! Will you
stop protecting him? You were
always protecting him! Don't talk
to your father. Don't bother your
father!
She turns to her dad.
SHARON
I'm going to bother you for one
minute, Dad. Okay? Can you
handle that?
Larry advances on her.
LARRY
Just get the hell out...
And she turns on him in a fury that halts him.
(CONTINUED)
125.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
This isn't about you, Larry -- or
you, either, Mom. This is between
me and my father, so leave us
alone for one goddam minute!
She turns back to her father.
SHARON
How about you, Dad. Do you want
me to leave?
FATHER
Up to you.
SHARON
Dad... I'm asking. Am I welcome
here?
FATHER
Jesus -- you're here, aren't you?
What d'you want?
SHARON
I want to know!
(then, quieting)
Do you want me here? Do you love
me, Dad? I want to know.
The question's out, and she's totally exposed now -- and
the silence that follows breaks her heart. She nods
toward his hearing aid. Her voice is close to a whisper,
thick with tears.
SHARON
Do you... need to... check that
again?
FATHER
I feel like...
He can't finish it.
SHARON
What, Dad?
You feel like what?
FATHER
I feel like I don't have a
daughter anymore.
She takes the blow and doesn't crumble, only her eyes
show the depth of the pain. She speaks quietly, softly.

SHARON
Well... you do. It's a shame
you're going to miss knowing her.
You're going to miss all that.
And she leaves, brushing past Larry and her Mother.
Sharon comes out of the kitchen, blinking
back tears.
The party goes on around her, oblivious.
She stops on
her way to the door because she sees the
video crew
moving, hunting the next guest -- and she
makes a
decision and walks toward them, stops in
the light, faces
the camera.
SHARON
I'm next.
As they roll tape, people turn, gather, watch.
Sharon
speaks over a torrent of emotions.
SHARON
(to camera)
Hi, Mom and Dad. Congratulations.
We see her family coming out of the kitchen and walking
into this, surprised, stopping still.
SHARON
Y'know... being in this house
reminds me of something.
I was
about ten, I guess, and Larry and
I were playing aliens -- remember,
Lar? We're making a lot
of noise,
and Dad comes home from work tired
and pissed off...
CUT TO:
HER FATHER
watching this. Her Mother is near panic, Larry staring
hard, Kathy wondering. INTERCUT their reactions
during...
SHARON
SHARON
We're yelling like mad, and Dad
bursts into the room and says,
what the hell are you doing? And
I'm scared. I'm really scared.

SHARON (CONT'D)
And I say, we're playing alien
invasion, Dad, and he says, oh,
yeah, I'll show you a damn
invasion, and he picks me up,
picks me up off the floor and
throws me on the couch. I hit
that couch and bounce off, and he
grabs Larry and throws him on the
couch, and then... then he starts
making these monster sounds, and
he says, we came to earth to kick
ass, and I run at him and jump on
him and he tosses me on the couch
and then Larry, and we're laughing
so hard I almost wet myself, and
he keeps tossing us and growling
and beeping, and it was... it was
great. It was great, and I'm
never going to forget that.
Never. And I miss that. I miss
it. So I just... I wanted to tell
you tanks for that, Dad. Thanks.
That's all.
(pause)
Bye.
She hands the microphone back and walks away as the
surprised looks, the deep looks of her Father, Mother,
Larry and Kathy follow her. She walks to the front door
and leaves.
Sharon just sits behind the wheel, still shaky from
crying. She puts the key in the ignition, but doesn't
move -- no longer sad, but drained now. He watches her.
In a moment, he gets out of the car.
