A SPACIOUS BEDROOM WITH SKYLINE VIEWS.  THE ROOM IS EMPTY 
SAVE FOR A BARE KING-SIZE BED.  TILLY PRYOR, 40 S, ENTERS 
FROM A WALK-IN CLOSET WITH A FEW LAST ITEMS TO PACK.  AFTER 
TWENTY YEARS OF LIVING WITH THE FINER THINGS IN LIFE, TILLY 
IS A WOMAN WHO IS USUALLY WELL PUT TOGETHER.  BUT NOT TODAY.  
HANK PRYOR ENTERS FROM THE HALL WITH TWO GLASSES OF WINE.  
HANK CARRIES HIMSELF WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF A BORN LEADER, 
SOMEONE USED TO BEING ON TOP.  EVEN WHEN HE S NOT.  LIKE NOW.

                                HANK

              Hey, Til.  I thought you might want a 

              glass of wine.

                                TILLY

              Oh, I m not really in the mood.

HE HANDS HER THE WINE AND SHE STARTS TO DRINK IT.  HANK TRIES 
TO GAUGE HER MOOD.

                                HANK 

              So... how you doing?

              How am I doing?  On the day we have to 

              move out of our home of seventeen 

              years?  The apartment we brought our 

              babies home from the hospital to?

              (SIGHS) I m not mad anymore, Hank.  

              I m just kinda sad, and scared.

                                HANK

                (CROSSING) Oh, Tilly, come here.

                                TILLY 

              ...And still a little mad.

HANK STOPS.

                                HANK

              I know my stepping down from the 

              company, us losing so much our savings 

              seems like the end of the world.  But 

              you know what I like to say:  it s 

              never  I m Hank Pryor.  Damn it.   

              It s  I m Hank Pryor damnit!   I m 

              gonna get us back on top.  Maybe not 

              today, maybe -- (OFF HER WORRIED LOOK)

                                      SCENE A

(Hank, Tilly, Maddie, Henry)

HANK AND TILLY ENTER AN EMPTY HOUSE.  AN OLD TRADITIONAL WITH 
HARDWOOD FLOORS, BIG WINDOWS AND CHARACTER TO SPARE, THE 
PLACE IS NOT HUGE, BUT IT S CERTAINLY COMFORTABLE.  WITH A 
LITTLE LOVE THIS COULD BE SOMEPLACE SPECIAL.  THEY WANDER 
AROUND, TAKING IT ALL IN.  NOT LOOKING WHERE THEY RE GOING, 
THEY ALMOST WALK INTO EACH OTHER -- THEY BOTH MOVE THIS WAY 
AND THAT, TRYING TO GET OUT OF EACH OTHER S WAY.

                                HANK

              Shall we dance?

HE SPINS HER AROUND GRACEFULLY.  THEY STAY ARM IN ARM.

              tough for you, Hank.

              No tougher than for you.

              Here s my little secret for dealing 

              with Maddie.  Before I say anything to 

              her -- anything --  I like apples... 

              yellow is a color,  first I ask myself 

              not how Maddie s going to react, but 

              how Moody s going to react.  Moody 

              Maddie.  Trust me.  The life you save 

              might be your own.

HANK ENTERS THE LIVING ROOM, REVEALING THE CHAOS AND CLUTTER 
OF A MOVING DAY IN FULL SWING.  FURNITURE IS SCATTERED HERE 
AND THERE.  MOVERS COME AND GO.  HANK NOTICES MADDIE SPRAWLED 
ON A CHAIR, TEXTING.  HE STARTS TO SAY SOMETHING, THEN STOPS, 
CONSIDERING HIS WORDS CAREFULLY.  SHE NOTICES HIM.

              what to do with that room yet.  I was 

              thinking of making it my office.

                                      SCENE C

(Hank, Tilly)

A JUMBLE OF BOXES, FURNITURE AND A LITTLE DOUBLE BED, ON LOAN 
FROM GRADY.  TILLY, IN PAJAMAS, IS ROOTING THROUGH A BOX OF 
CLOTHING.  SHE COMES ACROSS THE SEXY LITTLE NIGHTIE, SCOFFS 
AND STUFFS IT BACK IN, THEN PULLS OUT A BULKY SWEATSHIRT.  
HANK ENTERS.  THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE TINY BED.

HANK CROSSES, HEAD DOWN.  TILLY CROSSES THE OTHER WAY.  AS 
EARLIER, THEY ALMOST WALK INTO EACH OTHER, THEN MOVE THIS WAY 
AND THAT, MIRRORING EACH OTHER AND TRYING TO GET PAST.  THIS 
TIME NEITHER THINKS IT S CUTE.  FINALLY HANK JUST TAKES 
TILLY S ARM AND  GENTLY  PULLS HER PAST HIM.

THEY CLIMB INTO THEIR SIDES OF THE LITTLE BED AND TRY TO GET 
SETTLED:  THEY LIE ON THEIR BACKS, BUT THEIR SIDES TOUCH AND 
THAT S NO GOOD.  SO THEY SHIFT ONTO THEIR SIDES, FACING EACH 
OTHER, NOSE TO NOSE.  NO.  THEY FLIP OVER, FACING AWAY FROM 
ONE ANOTHER.  NOW THEIR BUTTS ARE TOUCHING.  TILLY FLIPS BACK 
ONTO HER OTHER SIDE AND HANK TURNS ONTO HIS BACK.  THEY 
SHIMMY AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER UNTIL THEY RE AS FAR APART AS 
POSSIBLE.  WHICH ISN T VERY FAR.  THEY LIE STILL IN THE DARK, 
EYES CLOSED.  A LONG, STILL MOMENT, THEN:

                                HANK

              You re breathing on me.

              You know I sleep on my right side.  

              Turn over if my breathing is so awful.

              Then get use to my breath.

THEY CLOSE THEIR EYES AND LIE STILL.  A BEAT.  TILLY EVER SO 
SLIGHTLY INCREASES HER EXHALATIONS HIS WAY.  HANK TRIES TO 
IGNORE IT, BUT FINALLY:

                                HANK 

              Fine!  

HE FLIPS ONTO HIS SIDE, TURNING AWAY FROM HER.  HE WRIGGLES 
AROUND, MAKING HIMSELF AS COMFORTABLE AS HE CAN.

                                TILLY

              I know you re purposely pushing your 

              butt into me.

                                HANK

              is how I sleep on my side!

HENRY S ROOM IS ALSO MOSTLY STILL IN BOXES.  THEY ENTER.  
HENRY CLIMBS INTO BED.  HANK REMAINS STANDING.

                                HANK

              So.  Ghosts.  Okay.  Henry, I know you 

              like to  use your imagination.   And 

              that s to be celebrated.  To an 

              extent.  But when that imagination 

              becomes more of a liability than an 

              asset, perhaps it s time to pull back 

              on the reins a bit.  With me so far?

                logically.  Okay.  In reality, there 

              are no such thing as ghosts.

              tons of nights together.  You always 

              work late, and sometimes when Mom 

              would be off at her charity stuff, 

              Henry would need somebody around.

              That s why you kids had Maria-Elena.

              Yeah, but late at night you can only 

              hear about her dad being killed by a

              Could I get a few hours of sleep 

              before we do this?  Right now I don t 

              stand a chance. 

                                TILLY

              I ll give you two hours.

              Thanks.

HANK CRAWLS INTO BED AS TILLY EXITS.  HANK SETTLES.  A MOMENT 
OF PEACE, THEN -- CRASH! -- A LEG PUNCHES THROUGH THE 
CEILING.  HANK JUMPS, TILLY RUNS BACK IN.  THEY WATCH AS THE 
LEG ATTEMPTS TO GO BACK UP BUT IS STUCK.

              (CALLING) Grady?

                                GRADY (O.S.)

              I m in the attic!

                                HANK

              (CALLING) Oh. (THEN) Listen, when 

              you re finished up there, we ve got a 

              hole in the ceiling we need you to 

              look at.

                                GRADY (O.S.)

              You got it, Hank!

GRADY TRIES TO PULL HIS LEG THROUGH AGAIN TO NO AVAIL.  A 
BEAT, THEN A LITTLE LEG PUNCHES THROUGH THE CEILING.

                                HANK

              (TO TILLY) You re right.  They do 

                everything together.
