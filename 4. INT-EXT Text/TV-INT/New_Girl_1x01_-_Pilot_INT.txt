      JESSICA DAY, late twenties, sits in a taxi with a large 
      winter coat on. She s on the phone. It s summer in New York. 

                                  JESS (INTO PHONE)
                    It s a surprise for him. I m going 
                    to walk in and just drop my coat on 
                    the ground. What do you think? 



      Jess  model-beautiful best friend, CECE MEYERS, is putting on 
      her shoes in front of the mirror.

                                  CECE
                    Why don t you hang it up?

                                  JESS
                    No...
                          (speaking softly)
                    I m not wearing anything 
                      underneath.

      The DRIVER looks back at her through the rearview mirror.

                                  CECE
                    What? I can t hear you.

                                  JESS
                    I m... I m naked under my coat. 

                                  CECE
                    Are you whispering something?

                                  JESS
                          (louder)
                    I m naked!

      The sound of the cab swerving a little in traffic. 

                                  JESS (CONT D)
                          (softer)
                    I think the cab driver knows.

                                  CECE
                    It s August, Jess. Anyone who s 
                    wearing a winter coat is either 
                    naked or a hoarder. 
                          (then)
                    This will be good for you guys. You 
                    got to keep it spicy. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      2.

                                  CECE (CONT'D)
                    I don t understand how you still 
                    have sex at all after seven years. 
                    I d have to take Ambien and pretend 
                    it s all a dream. 

                                  JESS
                    He said he has this fantasy that 
                    I m a stripper with a heart of 
                    gold. And he s helping me put 
                    myself through college-

                                  CECE
                    He didn t say the college part, did 
                    he?

                                  JESS
                    Nope.

                                  CECE
                    What s your stripper name?

                                  JESS
                    I don t know. Rachel Johnson.

                                  CECE
                    Your stripper name is Rachel 
                    Johnson? 

                                  JESS
                    Now, I m nervous-

                                  CECE
                    Jess. Remember in 6th grade when we 
                    were freaks and no one would talk 
                    to us? Did you ever think you d 
                    have a boyfriend?

                                  JESS
                    No, I thought I d be the crazy 
                    woman living over your garage.

                                  CECE
                    Now look at you. You re naked in 
                    the back of a cab. I m so proud of 
                    you.

      Jess beams.

                                  JESS (V.O.)
                    You know in horror movies, when the 
                    girl hears the sound in the 
                      basement...                                                                                      3.



      Jess walks into a small cozy apartment for two. 

                                  JESS (V.O.)
                    That s what my break-up was like. I 
                    should ve just called the cops.

                                  JESS
                    Heeey... I m home...

      Her boyfriend, SPENCER, walks out in his boxers, surprised. 
      Jess drops her coat. We stay above the shoulders, of 
      course... 

                                  JESS (CONT D)
                          (sexy singing)
                      Duh-duh-duh...   

                                    SPENCER
                    Jess-

      Jess turns her back to Spencer and starts shaking her tush. 
      She doesn t see a HOT GIRL come out and stand there, staring. 

                                  JESS
                          (singing, oblivious)
                    Duh-duh, sexy, naked, it s all 
                      happening... Sexy, sexy, I m doin  
                    sexy stuff to this plant...

      The plant falls over.                                                                                      4.


                                  JESS (CONT D)
                    Oh, okay, I ll pick it up later- 
                          (singing)
                    Duh-duh- Who s that girl? 

      She does a big jump and spins around. 

                                  JESS (CONT D)
                          (singing)
                    That s Jess!

      Jess finally sees the girl. A moment of silence.

                                  HOT GIRL
                    I like your bow.

      A red stick-on bow falls on the floor. FREEZE FRAME.

                                  JESS (V.O.)
                    So that s what happened.



      Reveal the voice-over is coming from Jess in present day...  

                                  JESS
                    That s why I need a new apartment. 

      She s facing THREE GUYS, mid twenties: SCHMIDT, slick, button-
      up shirt, NICK, hoodie, and COACH, large and in sweat pants. 
      If you squint, they look like the three stages of the 
      evolution of man...

      BACK TO THE LOFT:

                                  NICK
                    Come on. You had no idea he was 
                    cheating on you? 

                                  JESS
                    No. We d been dating forever. I 
                    thought I- I thought I knew him-

      Jess starts crying a little. The guys glance at each other. 

                                  JESS (CONT D)
                    It s okay- I m just emotional right 
                    now... You know how it is. 

      The guys stare at her blankly. They have no idea.                                                                                      5.


                                  JESS (CONT D)
                    It s weird. When I saw your ad on 
                      Craigslist, I thought you were 
                    girls- 

                                    SCHMIDT
                          (very defensive)
                    What? Why? Why would you think 
                    that? That s crazy. 

                                  NICK
                    Schmidt wrote the ad.

                                  JESS
                    I guess because you described the 
                    curtains as  beige-y .   

      Schmidt takes off his t-shirt, revealing a rock hard six-
      pack. He runs his hand up and down them.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    What about these? Are these beige-
                    y?

                                  JESS
                    This isn t going to work, right? I 
                    mean, you don t want to live with a 
                    girl. I m going through a break-up 
                    and I m a teacher, so I m going to 
                    be bringing home like a lot of 
                    popsicle sticks and stuff, and 
                    sometimes when I m sad I pretend to 
                    be Carrie Bradshaw and I put on 
                    weird bras and type on my computer. 
                    Oh yeah, and I sing to myself. A 
                    lot.  
                          (sung)
                    A lot.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Are you going to shower naked?

                                  JESS
                    I mean- yeah?

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Then yes. Yes we want to live with 
                    you.

                                  COACH
                    No. She ll tear us apart. She ll 
                    make me wear pants. I want to sit 
                    on that couch and let my beans out.                                                                                      6.


      Jess immediately stands up from the couch.

                                  JESS
                    So I m going to go-

                                  NICK
                    Wait, sorry. We re idiots. Give us 
                    a shot. Take a look at the 
                      apartment. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Nick. Come on. We re not desperate. 
                    We ve got a lot of options. 



                                  GUY
                    One thing about me. I love soup.
                          (a long, weird beat)
                    I. Love. Soup.



      A GUY IN HIS FIFTIES wearing LIPSTICK.

                                  GUY
                    Weeeell. Full disclosure. I m 
                      definitely a morning person. 

      BACK TO LOFT:

                                  NICK
                    We re desperate. Our buddy moved 
                    out three weeks ago. 

                                  JESS
                    I m sorry, I don t think-

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Wait, you re telling me you had no 
                    idea that guy was cheating on you?

                                  JESS
                    No. I told you. And I don t really 
                    want to talk about it-

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Did he lose a lot of socks?

                                  JESS
                    Yeah. So?                                                                                      7.


                                    SCHMIDT
                    Where do you think those socks 
                    were?

                                  JESS
                      I don t... oh.

                                  NICK
                    Did he take his phone into the 
                    bathroom?

                                  JESS
                    He thought it was rude to talk at 
                    the table.

                                  COACH
                    How many showers did he take a day?

                                  JESS
                    Two. One after the... gym.

                                  NICK
                    Whose idea was it to move in 
                    together?

                                  JESS
                    Well, my lease was up, so...

      They all stare at her.

                                  NICK
                          (softly)
                    Keyser Soze!

                                  JESS
                    Oh my god. You guys are geniuses.  

                                  NICK
                    No. We re guys. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Come take a look at my room. 
                          (then)
                    Wow. I ve never said that to a girl 
                    and not meant sex.

      As they re walking away...

                                  JESS
                    So, wait, my boyfriend took this 
                    class on Chinese Tea Ceremonies 
                    every Thursday....

      As Nick shakes his head, cut to:                                                                                      8.

                    ups are hard.



      Jess wears a large flannel and jeggings. She is cutting up an 
      apple at the table with Nick and Coach. 

                                  JESS (V.O.)
                    Just when you think you have 
                      everything under control, you 
                    don t...

      Nick watches with Coach. Nick hands her a banana.

                                  NICK
                    Banana?

                                  JESS
                          (breaking into sobs)
                    My. Life. Is. A. Lie.

                                  NICK
                    When she cries, it sort of sounds 
                    like Rihanna. 

                                  JESS
                          (crying, like Rihanna)
                    Eh! Eh! Eh!



      Jess is in front of the TV watching  Pretty Woman,  dipping 
      Saltines in fried rice. She s in a sort-of trance. Nick, 
      Schmidt, and Coach watch from the table. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    She s watched that movie seven 
                    times. I know all the lines now. I 
                    don t want to know the lines to 
                     Pretty Woman.  What if I m talking 
                    to a girl and all of a sudden I m 
                    just like,  Ohh, I m not wearing 
                      pantyhose!                                                                                        9.


                                  COACH
                    She ate all the food I have stashed 
                    in the couch. 

                                  NICK
                    You have food stashed in the couch?

                                  COACH
                    Yeah. Obvi. 



      Schmidt comes home from a night out, making out with a HOT 
      GIRL in the doorway. Suddenly, the girl stops making out with 
      Schmidt and sees Jess watching  Pretty Woman  in the dark. 

                                  HOT GIRL
                    Oo, I love  Pretty Woman !

      The girl runs to the couch and sits next to Jess, leaving 
      Schmidt standing there. 

      REVEAL Coach sitting on the couch next to them reciting all 
      the lines, as if in a trance.

                                  COACH
                          (doing voices)
                    I was in here yesterday, you 
                    wouldn t wait on me- Oh. - You 
                    people work on commission, right? - 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Nick! 

                                  JESS (V.O.)
                    The problem was I didn t know who I 
                    was without him. I was like a 
                    frozen computer. I tried to click 
                    on stuff, but all I had was that 
                    little spinning pinwheel thing. Or 
                      something.  



      The kitchen is a mess with open jars and food products. Jess 
      is sitting on the floor eating bread, on her ex-boyfriend s 
      Facebook page. She s singing  My Favorite Things.                                                                                         10.


                                  JESS
                          (singing)
                    Raindrops on roses and whiskers on 
                    kittens- I hate you, I hate you, I 
                    hate you- 
                          (takes a big mouth full of 
                            bread)
                    I miss you.

      REVEAL Nick, Schmidt, and Coach are standing together and 
      watching her on the floor. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    We got to get her out of here.

      Jess, startled, turns around. In a moment of panic, she 
      throws the bread across the room. 

                                  JESS
                    It s not mine!
                          (then)
                    Oh god. This is bad, right?

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Yeah. It s been a week. I can t 
                    live like this. I brought a girl 
                    home the other night, and she 
                    thought I had a baby. I m taking 
                    you out. I m going to get you a 
                    rebound. Shower sex. Hopefully. 

                                  NICK
                    This is not going to work. 

                                  JESS
                    Can I wear this flannel?

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Wait, let me see it for a second. 

      Jess takes it off and hands it to Schmidt. Schmidt 
      immediately takes a pair of scissors, cuts it up into tiny 
      pieces in the sink. 



      Jess is walking down the hallway, on the phone. As she walks, 
      kids say hi to her and slap her high-five. She s clearly one 
      of the most popular teachers.  

                                  CECE (FROM PHONE)
                    So, good, they re taking you out...                                                                                     11.


                                    STUDENT 
                    Hey, Ms. Day. 

      Jess slaps the student high-five.

                                  JESS
                    Ceec, I feel great. Why have I 
                    never had guy friends before?



      Cece, in a bizarre deconstructed designer dress, sits in a 
      director s chair getting primped and poked by makeup and hair 
      people. She talks on the phone.

                                  CECE (INTO PHONE)
                    Yeah, that s so weird...



      A TEENAGE JESS is sitting at the piano with her legs splayed. 
      She sings  Silent All These Years  by Tori Amos with a lot of 
      emotion. 

      ON TEENAGE CECE, watching in the crowd, her arm draped over a 
      hot guy who looks like Jordan Catalano, shaking her head in 
      shame. 

                                  JESS
                          (singing)
                    So you found a girl who thinks 
                    really deep thoughts! What s so 
                    amazing about really deep thoughts? 
                    Boy, you best hope that I bleed 
                    real soon...

      A GUY IN THE AUDIENCE runs out of the auditorium gagging.

      BACK TO PRESENT:

                                  JESS (CONT D)
                    They re going to help me pick up 
                    dudes. Like real ones. I gotta look 
                    hot.

      Jess passes a group of OLDER WOMAN TEACHERS who wave 
        enthusiastically and make  hang loose  hand gestures. Some 10 
      YEAR OLD students have started following her. 

                                  CECE (INTO PHONE)
                    Just don t take anything from Lost 
                    and Found again- Jess? I m serious.                                                                                    12.


                                  JESS
                    Of course not. I gotta go. 

                                  CECE (INTO PHONE)
                    Jess-

      Jess stops in front of a Lost and Found box. She holds up a 
      striped sweater. She puts it on. It fits, but snug. 

                                  JESS
                    What do you think of this?

      Jess turns around and talks to the nearby group of ADORING 10 
      YEAR OLDS. All of the girls  Oo and Aah.  One of the little 
      boys in the group speaks up.  

                                  YOUNG BOY
                          (a la Rachel Zoe)
                    Die. Die. Love. Die.



      A staff meeting at Schmidt s suit-and-tie, high stress office 
      filled with ball-busting WOMEN. MANDY, his douchiest co-
      worker bothers him as he tries to text.  

                                  MANDY
                      Victoria s Secret party on 
                    Saturday. Are you on the list?

                                    SCHMIDT
                          (covering his panic)
                    Yeah. Obviously. We go every year. 

      His FEMALE BOSS comes in. 

                                  FEMALE BOSS
                    Hey Schmidt, nice tie. Can I borrow 
                    a tampon?

      All Schmidt s female co-workers snicker and high-five. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    You know what- I m not a sex 
                    object. I m just trying to do my 
                    work, do a good job...

      More laughter. One of the women makes a cat noise.



      Schmidt looks at the Victoria s Secret website, on the phone.                                                                                     13.


                                    SCHMIDT (INTO PHONE)
                    We need Caroline, Nick. She can get 
                    us in.  



      Nick is sitting next to a pile of L-SAT books, but reading 
      one of Jess  copies of US Weekly.

                                  NICK (FROM PHONE)
                    I m not calling her. 

                                    SCHMIDT (INTO PHONE)
                    Listen to me. Knowing, every year, 
                    that I will go to the Victoria s 
                    Secret Wild West Charity Auction 
                    for Poverty reminds me that even 
                    though these women make fun of me 
                    and they slap my ass on the 
                    elevator, I m still a man and I can 
                    still motorboat a girl dressed like 
                    a Native American. 



      Schmidt, incredibly drunk, with his shirt off, is motor-
      boating a girl dressed as Pocahontas. He looks up.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    I m never going to die!

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Perfect. Tell me. Why did you let 
                    the girl who does PR for Victoria s 
                    Secret dump you? 

                                  NICK
                    She didn t love me anymore.

                    You can work around that. Look at 
                    your parents.

      As the woman is about to scream:


      BACK TO OFFICE.

                                  COACH
                    She burned 800 calories. What do 
                    you want me to do...
                          (doing a silly voice)
                    Be friendly with them and talk to 
                    them-

                                  BOSS
                    Yes. That s exactly what I want. 



      Coach sits in the living room. Jess, wearing the same tight 
      striped sweater from Lost and Found, is trying to figure out 
      how to use a hair straightener.  

                                  COACH
                    Hey.. How do you talk to women?                                                                                     16.


                                  JESS
                    You re doing it right now.

                                  COACH
                    No, for real. 

                                  JESS
                    I m a woman.

                                  COACH
                    No, for real.

                                  JESS
                    Well, you know what I tell my 
                    fourth graders- if you don t 
                      understand someone, try to put 
                    yourself in their shoes.  

                                  COACH
                    Yeah right. I m not wearing girl 
                    stuff.
                          (then)
                    Why is your hair on fire?

      Jess screams and runs into the bathroom...



      Jess takes her hair out of the straightener. It s a half 
      burnt, wavy mess. She looks down at the box where Kim 
      Kardashian is smiling up at her and giving her a thumb s up. 
      She looks at herself in the mirror, about to cry. 

                                  JESS
                    You can do this.
                          (singing)
                    Your hair looks crazy, but you re 
                    still on top! That s Jess!

      Jess high-fives herself in the mirror, leaves the bathroom 
      and heads into her room. She opens the door to find...



      Coach wearing Jess  jeggings in front of her mirror. 

                        JESSCOACH
      Aaaaah! My jeggings!You told me to- They look 
                                                  like jeans!

      Jess shuts the door to her room. She sits outside. Schmidt 
      walks by, looking amazing.                                                                                    17.


                                    SCHMIDT
                    Okay, let s do this. How long is it 
                    going to take you to get dressed?

                                  JESS
                    I m dressed. 

      Schmidt stares at her. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Right. Sort of Grandma-hot. I could 
                    go there with you. Listen, it 
                    wouldn t be my first choice, but I 
                    could go there. Let s do this.

                                  COACH
                          (from inside the room)
                    I can t get them off... they re too 
                    tight...

      Schmidt looks at her, weirded out. She shrugs.



      Schmidt, Coach, and Jess sit on stools, as Nick tends bar. A 
      girl walks by, flips off Schmidt. 

                                  JESS
                    Does she know you?

                                    SCHMIDT
                    No, Jess. Not the real me.

                                  COACH
                          (quietly to Jess)
                    They looked like jeans.

                                  JESS
                          (softly to him)
                    It s okay. I accept you. 

      Schmidt points at A HOT GUY at the end of the bar.  

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Okay. Him. 

                                  JESS
                    He looks like you.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    You re right. He s out of your 
                    league.                                                                                      18.


      Nick is one of the bartenders- he delivers drinks.     

                                  NICK
                    Beers. And... a Ros . 

                                  JESS
                    Pink wine makes me slutty. One sip 
                    of pink wine and I m like Fergie in 
                    the Black-Eyed Peas. I m like the 
                      Incredible Slut. 
                          (to a passing guy)
                    How you doin?

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Now listen to me. I know at some 
                    point someone in your life told you 
                    that it was okay to be exactly who 
                    you are and that one day you d find 
                    a man who loves the real you- a man 
                    who just lives to rub on your 
                    hairy, hairy legs.    
                          (then)
                    That s not going to be tonight. 
                    You re going to take off that 
                    sweater, because it smells like 
                    apple sauce... And you re going to 
                    go over there, and you re going to 
                    hide your crazy. Because that guy 
                    broke your heart and the only way 
                    it s going to stop hurting is if 
                    you go do some bad things with that 
                    man, right over there.

                                  NICK
                    Listen to him. He s like Mary 
                    Poppins for rebound sex.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Here s what s going to happen. You 
                    walk over there. You stand next to 
                    him. You smile. 

      Jess smiles a large, toothy smile. 

                                    SCHMIDT (CONT D)
                    You don t smile like that.

      Jess smiles using her lips to cover her teeth. 

                                    SCHMIDT (CONT D)
                    Nope.

      Jess shows a little teeth- it looks weirder.                                                                                    19.


                                  NICK
                    You look like a young Susan Boyle.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    No smile. If he checks you out, 
                    make eye contact, but just for a 
                    second. Don t speak unless he 
                    speaks to you. What did I just say? 

                                  JESS
                    I got this.

      Jess takes a swig of her pink wine and walks over. She sidles 
      up next to the guy. The GUY quickly checks her out. Jess 
      waits. A beat. She can t help herself.  

                                  JESS (CONT D)
                    Hey Sailor...

      Jess makes a weird half-toothy, half-toothless smile. He 
      looks scared.

      Over his shoulder, we see Nick laughing and Schmidt banging 
      his head against the bar. 

      Benjamin, the intern, and Mandy walk up with another friend, 
      PETER. 

                                  MANDY
                    Schmidt. This is Benjamin. He s an 
                    intern. We re boning. Can I get 
                    some shots up in this bitch? 

                                    SCHMIDT
                          (to Nick)
                    Check his ID.

                                  MANDY
                    What are you- like a bartender?

                                  NICK
                    Yup.

                                  MANDY
                    Weird.

                                  BENJAMIN
                          (to Schmidt)
                    I heard you re not coming to the 
                    party Saturday. I heard you re not 
                    on the list. Suuuucks bro. 

      Schmidt looks at Nick:  You re going to let this happen?                                                                                      20.


                                  NICK
                    Oh, we re going.

      Schmidt smiles. Jess walks up behind them.

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Whoa. You scared me.

                                  PETER
                    What s up, I m Peter.

      Jess just stares at them, trying to make her mouth into a 
      sexy smile. Everyone waits for her to speak. 

                                  MANDY
                    Do you guys smell applesauce?

                                  JESS
                    You re mean.

      Jess hits Mandy with a light girly smack. 

                                  MANDY
                    Oh my god!

      Mandy lightly hits her back. Jess lightly hits her back.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Yes! Yes!

      The guys break it up.

      JUMP CUT- LATER: 

      Schmidt plays Big Buck Hunter with Coach. 

                                    SCHMIDT (CONT D)
                    Wait. You put on her pants?

                                  COACH
                    Not pants. Jeggings. Jeans plus 
                    leggings. Can I show you something?

      He lifts his shirt to reveal the jeggings. 

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                      I couldn t get them off.

      AT THE BAR

      Jess and Nick are at the bar. ANOTHER GUY walks up. 

                                  JESS
                    Hi.                                                                                    21.


                                  GUY
                    I have a girlfriend.

                                  JESS
                    Wow. I just said Hi. I can t hide 
                    my crazy.

                                  NICK
                    Where would you hide it? One more 
                    pink wine.

                                  JESS
                    Maybe you should be my rebound. You 
                    know? Just get it over with. Get 
                    all that sexual tension off the 
                    table. 

                                  NICK
                    Okay, sure. 

                                  JESS
                    Wait, seriously?

                                  NICK
                    Sure. But I mean, you ll fall in 
                    love with me. And then you ll 
                    realize I m emotionally stunted and 
                    incapable of love, and I ve been 
                    studying for the bar exam for three 
                    years and that s not normal. And, 
                    in the morning, when you just want 
                    to eat your breakfast, I ll be 
                    picturing you naked. And then one 
                    of us has to move. So, yeah, we 
                    should totally hook up. 

                                  JESS
                          (then)
                    You got dumped, didn t you?

                                  NICK
                    No.

                                  JESS
                    It takes one to know one. What 
                    happened? 

                                  NICK
                    I don t need to talk about it. I m 
                    fine- I m not the one crying on the 
                    floor. 

                                  JESS
                    Fine.                                                                                     22.


                                  NICK
                    Fine.

      Schmidt comes up to them, points to PETER, on the other end 
      of the bar. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Hey. The intern s little friend 
                    wants to talk to you.

                                  JESS
                    Why? I gave him the Boyle smile. I 
                    Boyled him.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    I laid some ground work. Go. 

                                  JESS
                    Yes! Okay.

      Jess bends at the waist, flipping her hair over. She fluffs 
      it with her fingers, shaking it out. Peter sees her doing it.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Stop. Stop whatever you re doing 
                    right now. 

      Jess shakes her hair back and forth violently, hitting 
      Schmidt in the face. Then Jess walks over to the guy. 

                                  NICK
                    What did you do?

      Schmidt shrugs. He takes a swig of a beer. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Why do we never have friends that 
                    are girls?  

                                  NICK
                    Yeah, Schmidt, I have no idea.



      Schmidt sits on a couch next to a NICE GIRL. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Let s just be friends. 

                                  NICE GIRL
                    Totally.

      A beat. And then Schmidt and the Girl start making out.                                                                                    23.


      BACK TO BAR:

                                    SCHMIDT
                    You know, I don t even really think 
                    of her as a girl. I think of her as 
                    a chubby little alien who is 
                    learning the ways of the human. 
                          (alien voice)
                    A. Fork. Can. I. Eat. It?

      Jess suddenly comes back, angry. She slaps a twenty down.

                                  JESS
                    You paid him to talk to me? 

                                  NICK
                    Wow. Only twenty dollars?

                                  JESS
                    You know what? You re just-

      Peter walks by. 

                                  PETER
                    See you tomorrow... Sailor. 

                                  JESS
                    Can t wait. Should I call or- cool!

      Peter s gone. Nick and Schmidt stare, surprised. 

                                  NICK
                    What? What s happening tomorrow?

                                  JESS
                    Dinner. With food. 

      She  raises the roof. 

                                  JESS (CONT D)
                          (singing)
                    Who s that girl? It s Jess! She s 
                    on fiiiiire!

                                  NICK
                    What is that- did you make up a 
                    theme song for yourself?

                                  JESS
                    You know, some guys like that I 
                    don t limit myself to the 
                      conventional ideas of what s sexy. 
                    Some guys like my hairy legs- Maybe 
                    not Spencer, but...                                                                                    24.


                                  NICK
                    Oh god. Are you going to cry? 

                                  JESS
                    Yes! I am! What s wrong with it? 
                    What s wrong with having feelings? 
                    What are you so afraid of? You got 
                    dumped. Just admit it sucks. 
                    Instead of just standing there 
                    being like,  I know everything. I m 
                    Nick. I m smarter than everyone. 

                                  NICK
                    Okay, but when you were imitating 
                    me, your voice actually went higher-

                                  JESS
                     I m Nick, and I have a low voice. 
                          (to Schmidt)
                    And you- you are just wrong. I m 
                    not going to have another 
                      relationship based on lies-  I want 
                    to be with a guy who doesn t want 
                    to play games, who likes honesty-

                                    SCHMIDT
                    How d you get him to go out with 
                    you?

                                  JESS
                    I said I needed rebound sex. 

      Jess  raises the roof.  

                                  NICK
                    You should be careful with that 
                    roof. We wouldn t want it to fall 
                    down-  

                                  JESS
                    I m going out with that guy 
                    tomorrow. And we may or may not get 
                    to third or fourth base. It is on!

      She does a strange hip-thrusting dance and walks away. As she 
      turns around, REVEAL that her skirt is tucked into the back 
      of her LARGE GRANNY PANTIES. 

                                  NICK
                    Should we tell her?

                                    SCHMIDT
                    I think we let her have her moment.                                                                                    25.


      ON JESS:

                                  JESS
                          (singing to herself)
                    She got a date in a bar with a real 
                    dude- She s on fiiiiire! 
                          (stops, realizing)
                    Wait, where am I going? I didn t 
                    actually have to go anywhere...



      Nick sits across from CAROLINE, his ex-girlfriend. 

                                  CAROLINE
                    Nick.

                                  NICK
                    Caroline. Just so you know- I am 
                    totally over you. 

                                  CAROLINE
                    Good. Does that mean you re going 
                    to stop prank calling me?

                                  NICK
                    What? That s crazy.

                                  CAROLINE
                          (cockney)
                     Ello Caroline- Oi still love you.
                          (then)
                    So what is this about? The party?

                                  NICK
                    No... But if you could get us in-

                                  CAROLINE
                    No.  

                                  NICK
                    Okay. Fine. I should probably...  
                          (this hurts to say)
                    Why did you dump me? 

                                  CAROLINE
                    Nick. Are you actually having a 
                    feeling that you re not making a 
                    joke about?

                                  NICK
                    Can you just- just tell me.                                                                                    26.


                                  CAROLINE
                    Because. When I met you, you wanted 
                    to change the world. And you were 
                    crazy and fun and trying to figure 
                    it out. And then your parents told 
                    you to go to law school. And you 
                    just gave up. You stopped caring 
                    about everything. Including me.   

                                  NICK
                          (after a beat)
                    Oh. That s it? That s not bad. I 
                    thought you were sleeping with 
                    someone else.

                                  CAROLINE
                    Nick. I m glad you called.

                                  NICK
                          (cockney)
                     Oim glad,  oney.

                                  CAROLINE
                          (smiling)
                    Fine. You re on the list. 

      Suddenly REVEAL Schmidt at the next table who had been hiding 
      behind a Village Voice. He stands up, pumping his fists.

                                  CAROLINE (CONT D)
                    Has he been there the whole time? 
                    Of course he has.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Caroline. I ve missed hearing you 
                    guys have sex. It was like hearing 
                    dolphins playing with a ball. 



      Coach s spin class has transformed. Soft acoustic guitar 
      music plays. Coach is wearing jeggings and trying to be nice.

                                  COACH
                    Would you like to go a little 
                    faster?

                                  WOMAN ON BIKE
                      I can t...                                                                                    27.


                                  COACH
                    What about now? Would you like to 
                    go any faster now? I would really 
                    like you to go faster.

      The woman, creeped out, leaves. Another woman leaves. That 
      only leaves a CHUBBY 11 year old GIRL.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Hey, aren t you going to go too?

                                  CHUBBY GIRL
                    My mom said if I don t exercise, 
                    she s taking my phone. I like your 
                    jeggings. I didn t think guys wore 
                    those. They make fun of them at 
                    school.

                                  COACH
                    Jeggings are awesome. 

                                  CHUBBY GIRL
                    You re awesome. Look. I made jorts.

      Chubby girl shows him her cut-off jeggings. Chubby Girl s MOM 
      runs into the room and grabs Chubby Girl out of the class.

                                  MOM
                    Was the man in tights making you 
                    feel uncomfortable?



      Cece, looking gorgeous as per usual, sits on the couch 
      waiting for Jess. Nick and Schmidt sit opposite her, staring.

                                  CECE
                    Does the dress fit, Jess?

                                  JESS (FROM OFF)
                    Ummm... 

      The sounds of things falling.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Cece, Are you warm? I m a little... 
                    warm.

                                  NICK
                    No, Schmidt-

      Schmidt takes off his shirt. His abs are oiled up.                                                                                     28.


                                  CECE
                    All that oil- can t be good for the 
                    couch. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Cecilia.
                          (Italian accent)
                      Che-cilia. What are your hopes and 
                    dreams? Tell me everything.

                                  COACH (FROM OFF)
                    What s up, jerks?

      Coach walks into the room, then stops in his tracks when he 
      sees Cece.

                                  CECE
                    Hi, I m Cece, Jess  friend from 
                    growing up- 

                                  COACH
                    What- are you a model or something?

                                  CECE
                    Yes. Yeah. Mostly print right now- 
                    I m saving money so I can go to an 
                      engineering program. I m really 
                      interested in video game design.

      A wordless moment from all of the guys.

                                  COACH
                    That s cool. I know what it s like 
                    to have people judge you on your 
                    looks. I m a trainer. 

                                  CECE
                    Oh, really, don t you have to be... 

                                  NICK
                    Not fat?

                                  COACH
                    Can a fat man do this?

      Coach tries to pick up the couch that Cece where Cece sits. 
      He falls back down immediately, screaming: 

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                          (high pitched)
                    Oh god, oh god.                                                                                    29.


                                  CECE
                    I think you look great. I like 
                    those pants.

      Coach just stares at her, his mouth open a little.

                                  NICK
                    So you hung out with Jess in high 
                    school. Was that like God watching 
                    the Titanic? 

                                  CECE
                    We just found each other. I was 
                    kind of freakishly tall and she was 
                    just... freakish.

      Jess comes out in Cece s high-fashion, super tight dress, 
      high heels, and a shiny beaded scarf. 

                                  JESS
                    Check it out.
                          (beat-boxing)
                        Um-ch-um-ch-um-ch...

      She takes one step, and immediately falls.

                                  CECE
                    Maybe no heels?

                                  JESS
                          (getting back up)
                    I can t breathe... I haven t eaten 
                    bread in twelve hours.

                                  NICK
                    How many of those hours were you 
                    asleep?

                                  JESS
                    Do you like this scarf with it? I 
                    got it on a bus. For free.

                                  CECE
                    I love it. He s going to love you.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    No! No! That scarf is horrible. 
                    Don t take advice from a hot girl. 
                    Cece telling you to wear that scarf 
                    is like Mozart saying,  You can 
                    play the piano! It s easy!  No. You 
                    can t. You can play, like, maybe a 
                    plastic harmonica. Maybe.                                                                                      30.


                                  CECE
                    What are you saying? Jess isn t 
                    hot?

                                    SCHMIDT
                    No. I m...

      Schmidt suddenly runs out of the room.

                                    SCHMIDT (FROM OFF) (CONT D)
                    It s a trap!

                                  JESS
                          (texting)
                    I ll just tell him I m ready...

                                  NICK
                    Don t text him- he didn t text you.
                          (off her look)
                    Oh god, how many times today?

                                  JESS
                    No, no- Nick. I really need this.

                                  NICK
                          (then, genuine)
                    Don t worry. You re doing 
                      everything right. You re the one 
                    who knows who you are. If he 
                    doesn t like that, he s crazy. I 
                    mean seriously, why would you 
                    listen to us?   

      Coach tries to lift the couch again. 

                                  COACH
                    Ow. Ow. Ow.

      Jess looks at all of them, nervous but excited.



      A HOT HOSTESS leads Jess to her table.

                                  HOT HOSTESS
                    I love that scarf.

                                  JESS
                    Thank you!

      Jess suddenly looks at how hot the hostess is and gets 
      suspicious. She takes off the scarf.                                                                                     31.



      Jess  table is now covered in bread- crumbs, half eaten 
      rolls. She s in the pits. The hot hostess walks up.

                                  JESS
                    Do you have anything more that s 
                    free that also has bread in it?

                                    HOSTESS
                    I m sorry, we re going to have to 
                    ask you to give up the table- 

                                  NICK (O.S.)

                    We re like Reverse Mormons. One man 
                    just isn t enough for her. 

                                  JESS

                    with it.                                                                                     34.

                    I m not crying... I m not...

      People in the restaurant look over. Coach steps forward. 

                                  COACH

                    No. Not doing it, sorry. 

      Coach hits him on the shoulder hard.

      ON a table with an OLD COUPLE. 

                                  OLD WOMAN
                    What s happening over there?

      BACK TO JESS  TABLE:                                                                                    35.


                                    HOSTESS
                    You have to leave. Now. All of you. 

      They start to head out.

                                  JESS (V.O.)
                    When you get your heart broken, you 
                    can call up a girl and spend an 
                    hour talking about how men suck. 
                    That s fine. But sometimes what you 
                    need is just a guy to look at you, 
                    shrug, and say&

                                    SCHMIDT
                    I d still do you.

                                  COACH
                    Yup.

                                  NICK
                    Yeah.

                                  JESS
                    Aww, you guys.
                          (then)
                    That s never going to happen.



      The guys are sitting on the couch wearing jeggings. Jess sits 
      on the floor with a bottle of pink wine. They are all 
      watching  Pretty Woman,  reciting lines.

                                  COACH
                    How much for the entire night? 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    You couldn t afford me.

                                  COACH
                    Try me.
