    Two men work in the darkness. They stand on makeshift 
      scaffolding busily tying off the corners of a huge tarp. The 
      first of the men to speak, DAVE, (late 20s, laid back, 
      scruffy sexy) has an Irish (alternately, English) accent.

                                  DAVE
                    You re confident this will impress 
                    her -- not send her into witness 
                      protection?

    The second man (35, brash, confident, manic) wears a leather 
      jacket over a  Virginia is for Lovers  T-shirt. For the time 
      being, we ll call him CUPID.

                                  CUPID
                    Grand gestures, Dave. It makes them 
                    weak in the knees. Ready?

      Dave takes a deep breath, nods.

                                  CUPID (CONT D)
                    One... Two... Three...

    The two men hoist the tarp up and over a wooden ledge. They 
      regard each other. Cupid grins, jackhammers his eyebrows.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Dave and Cupid step into a blinding light. They squint as 
      their eyes adjust. They turn and regard their work. 
      Spotlights are illuminating the tarp draped over what must be 
      a billboard. A QUESTION MARK has been painted on the tarp.

                                  CUPID (CONT D)
                    Trust me. This llblow Holly s 
                    mind.

                                  DAVE
                    On that, we can agree.

      HELICOPTER SHOT starts on the two men at the base of the 
      question mark. As the SHOT GOES WIDE and opens out on the 
      million lights of Hollywood and the L.A. Basin, we realize 
      we re looking at the HOLLYWOOD SIGN. The men have covered up 
    the  W  with a giant question mark, and they ve masked the 
      final three letters with blank tarps.

    The sign now reads -- HOLLY?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Cupid and Dave climb up the scrubland toward the street.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   2.


                                  DAVE (CONT D)
                    How long you think we ve got before 
                    the cops show up?

                                  CUPID
                    Oh, I m pretty sure they ll be up 
                    there waiting for us.

      Dave stops in his tracks.

                                  DAVE
                    Excuse me?

                                  CUPID
                            (nonchalant)
                    Yeah, that s the best part. You get 
                    arrested. Then interviewed. You 
                    tell the reporter your story. You 
                    can t buy that kind of publicity.

                                  DAVE
                          (frantic)
                    Dude! I m here on an expired visa. 
                    They ll send me back to Ireland. My 
                    storywon t matter.

      Cupid strokes his chin, considers.

                                  CUPID
                    I wish you d mentioned that.

                                  DAVE
                    I wish you d brought up the getting 
                    arrestedpart earlier. I thought 
                    we d take credit in a personals ad 
                    or something.

                                  CUPID
                          (sighs, then...)
                    Fine. I ll tell your story.

                          the hill)
                     Tis a far better thing I do than 
                    I ve ever done...

                                  DAVE
                    You sure? Because I can t...

                                  CUPID
                    Go. I ll make it happen. We re 
                    gonnafind Holly. Bank on it.

      Dave offers up his hand. Cupid shakes it. Dave heads out into 
    the darkness. Cupid continues up the hill.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   3.

    The cop who cuffed Cupid jerks his arms up, leads him back to

      POVSHOT of the HOLLYWOOD SIGN which still reads  HOLLY? 

      ANGLE ON DR. CLAIRE ALLEN (35, professional, sexy) waiting on 
      a street corner. She gazes up at the Hollywood sign with an 
      amused, curious expression. The  Don t Walk  sign changes to 
       Walk,  and Claire crosses Sunset toward Border s Books. 


      Trevor exits Cedars. Claire exits a beat later, calls out.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Hey, ...Trevor!

      Trevor turns, stops, waits for Claire to catch up. He is in a 
      cheery mood. He s his old self. She hands Trevor a card.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)

                    Look at that, you ve got a card.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yes. I ve got a card. It s a 
                    singles  group. I provide free 
                    counseling to people who have 
                    become disenchanted with the dating

                    Look, Trevor, I just staked my 
                    professional reputation on you.

                    Which was sweet.

                    Isaac! Marla! Have a good weekend!

      Claire turns to see Isaac and a woman who must be Marla 
      exiting the hospital hand in hand. Claire shakes her head.

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    They re going down to Laguna for 
                    the weekend, do some waterboarding.

                    I said that wrong. On the water? 
                    With a board? What s that called?

                          (concerned)
                    Trevor, Marla has a reputation as a

      Trevor starts walking away, turns around.

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    See you tonight. Sounds like these 
                    people need me.

      Claire dejectedly watches Trevor depart. It s clear from her 
      expression that she expects this to end badly.


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   17.


                                        ACT TWO


      Trevor appears at the top of the escalator as we hear the 
      sound of an acoustic guitar and a talented singer.

                                  STREET MUSICIAN (0.S.)
                    Where will I wander and wonder? 
                    Nobody knows. But wherever I m 
                    going, I ll go in search of a rose.


      ANGLE ON DAVE. He s the source of the song we ve been 
      hearing. He s singing to a couple tourists who have stopped 
    in front of his open guitar case.

                                  DAVE
                    I ll savor the softness of summer/ 
                    I ll wrap up when winter blows/ And 
                    wherever I m going, I ll go in 
                    search of a rose.

      Dave sees Trevor. He strips off his guitar and embraces him.

                                  DAVE (CONT D)
                      Where veyou been? I thought they 
                    sent you up the river.

                                  CUPID
                    All that matters is we re back in 
                    business. Got plans tonight?


      Trevor enters the courtyard of TresEquis, a former adult 
      movie theater that s been converted to a Mexican-themedbar. 

      Trevor bounds up a set of exterior steps to an apartment. 
      He s surprised to find a  ROOM FOR RENT  sign in the window. 
    He tries his key. It doesn t work. Trevor heads back down the 
      stairs, moves through the courtyard. We take note of the 
      adult theater marquis which proclaims tonight  MARIACHI 
      KARAOKE NIGHT.  Trevor enters...


      Dave is beautifully framed with the lights of the Ferris 
      wheel spinning behind him as he poses with his guitar. An 
      L.A. TIMES PHOTOGRAPHERsnaps photos as Prudence observes.

                                  PHOTOGRAPHER
                    I think I got it.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Thanks, Roger.

                                  DAVE
                    I wonder where Trevor is.

      Prudence looks past Dave, lights up.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Dance DanceRevolution!

      Prudence moves past Dave affecting a zombie gate, tone.

                                  PRUDENCE (CONT D)
                    Must. Dance.

    As she passes Dave, Prudence speeds up. Dave watches her 
      curiously, bends down to put his guitar in its case.


      Dave catches up with Prudence just as she feeds quarters into 
    the DANCE DANCEREVOLUTIONVIDEO GAMEat the mouth of an 
      indoor/outdoor arcade. A 14-YEAR-OLD ASIAN BOYwaits 
      stoically next to her.

                                  DAVE
                    What are you doing?

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Teaching this youngster how we 
                    kicked it in the mid-90s.

    The video game cranks up, and Prudence and the 14-year-old 
      start dancing, stomping on the lighted dance floor in time to 
    the patterns scrolling down the screen.

      PUSH IN ON DAVE as he observes Prudence dancing with playful 
      abandon. He smiles, utterly charmed by her gusto. Prudence is 
      decent at the game. The kid next to her, though, is an ace.

                                  DAVE
                    Is it like golf? The lower the 
                    score the better?                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   39.


                                  PRUDENCE
                    Shut up.
                          (stilldancing)
                    So what happens if you find Holly, 
                    and she has a boyfriend? Or worse, 
                    what if you didn t have quite the 
                    same impact on her that she had on 
                    you?

                                  DAVE
                    I get over it eventually. Not 
                    knowing whether it was real would 
                    be worse than knowing it wasn t.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    I guess.
                          (whatthe hell...)
                    I suppose the reason I d never go 
                    on a quest like yours is because I 
                    gave up believing in happily-ever-
                      afters...this whole 19th century 
                    invention we call romantic love. 
                    Arranged marriages in the dark ages 
                    had a better chance of survival.

                                  DAVE
                    To be fair -- wives were considered 
                    property in the dark ages. Not many 
                    breakups under the circumstances.
                    ...So then, will your parents be 
                    choosing a husband for you?

                                  PRUDENCE
                    I believe in love. Just a pragmatic
                    love. It s why I started going to 
                    Dr. Allen s sessions. She gets it.

      Dave is dubious. Prudence points out a lovey-doveycouple of 
      teenagers strolling through the arcade hand in hand.

                                  PRUDENCE (CONT'D)
                    Okay, take these two... For them, 
                    love is winning a giant stuffed 
                    animal, a photo-booth make-out 
                    session, a ride on the Ferris 
                    wheel, but that s not real...

                                  DAVE
                    Couldn t tell you. I ve never been 
                    on a Ferris wheel.

      Prudence stops dancing. She can t believe it.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   40.


                                  PRUDENCE
                      Inconceivable.

                                    14-YEAR-OLD
                    Better luck next time, lady.

      Prudence turns to the kid, gives him a feisty look, then 
      shoves him off the machine. She dusts off her hands...


      Trevor is pacing impatiently. He hears a honk, he turns and 
      spots Claire driving up. She rolls down her window.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Sorry. Traffic.

    Off Trevor, grumbling.


      Claire and Trevor stand in the spot where Dave was posing.

                                  TREVOR
                    Dave was supposed to be right here.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (digging for clues)
                    Don t you love amusement parks? Did 
                    you go to many as a kid?

      Trevor gives Claire a flat look.

                                  TREVOR
                    You mean when I wasn t inspiring 
                    poets or shepherding the Amoretti
                    through their bacchicrites? 

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yeah. When you weren t doing that.

                                  CUPID
                    Back off, Nancy Drew. I m on a 
                    mission here. And despite your wet 
                    blanketry, I ve got a good feeling 
                    about tonight.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You think maybe you and Dave might 
                    be better served by altering your 
                      expectations.

                                  TREVOR
                    Poppycock. That s mortal-think.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   41.



      Dave and Prudence ride the Ferris Wheel. They re at the very 
      top. Dave looks over the side. He appears frightened.

                                  DAVE
                    I thought these things were kiddie 
                    rides. You know, like a merry-go-
                    round tipped on its side. This is 
                      terrifying.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    You were right. You re totally 
                    uncool.

                                  DAVE
                    Yes, but, on the other hand, you ve 
                    gotta admire my keen self-awareness.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Here. We ll get through this 
                    together.

      Prudence blithely offers up her hand to hold. The two smile 
    at each other -- a fun moment. 

      CAMERA GOES CLOSE ON THEIR HANDS as they squeeze tightly. 
      Prudence s thumb rubs the back of Dave s hand.

      We re on Dave s face as he realizes what s happening. He 
      turns to Prudence and finds she s already looking him in the 
      eye. Prudence leans over, kisses Dave. For a moment Dave 
      isn t an active participant in the kiss. He s merely a 
      passenger. After a couple seconds of this, he seems to be won 
      over.

    As the kiss continues, the pair revolves to the bottom of the 
      Ferris Wheel where Claire and Trevor have been searching.

      ANGLE ON CLAIRE AND TREVOR

      Claire taps Trevor on the shoulder, points to the kissing 
      couple. Trevor deflates. 

                                  TREVOR
                    I blame you for this.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Chalk one up for mortal-think.

    Off a two shot: Trevor forlorn, Claire pleased.


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   42.


                                        ACT FOUR


      Trevor, Claire and Dave are near the front of line of 
      beautiful people waiting to get into the club.

                                  TREVOR
                    So, remember, when we get inside, 
                    we re looking for the woman who 
                    inspired you to buy that one way 
                    ticket to America. Try not to trip 
                    and land with your tongue in anyone 
                    else s mouth.

                                  DAVE
                          (head still swimming)
                    Yeah, I m not quite sure how that 
                    happened. Prudence s just so easy 
                    to talk to...

                                  TREVOR
                    Focus, man.

                                  CLAIRE
                     Ease of communication  is one of 
                    my four pillars of a sound--

                                  TREVOR
                    Zip it.

                                  DAVE
                    You should see her dance. She d 
                    probably really fancy this place.

      A LARGE BOUNCER makes an announcement to everyone in line.

                                  BOUNCER
                    People! If you re not on the list, 
                    you will not get in tonight. We re 
                    having a private party. 

    As people in front of our group disperse, Trevor muscles his 
    way up to the Bouncer, indicates Dave.

                                  TREVOR
                    My buddy was here last night, and 
                    he thinks he left his credit card 
                    at the bar. Can he go in and check?

                                  BOUNCER
                    Quick like a bunny.
                          (to Trevor and Claire)
                    You two wait right here.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   43.


                                  TREVOR
                          (sotto to Dave)
                    Take a quick lap. See if she s here.


    We return to Trevor and Claire waiting for Dave.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I don t get it. You say you re on a 
                    mission to match one hundred 
                    couples. We find a man and a woman 
                      youintroduced hitting it off, 
                    kissing, and yet, you drag him away.

                                  TREVOR
                    Have you not been paying attention? 
                    I get credit for a match when it s 
                    true love, the kind of love  you d 
                    cross oceans to find.  They were 
                    very specific on that point. Romeo 
                    and Juliet counts. Romeo and the 
                    coat check girl doesn t. Got it?

      Dave emerges from the club. Trevor spots him.

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    There he is. Any luck?

      Dave shakes his head. Nada.Off Trevor s disappointment.


      CAMERA HOLDS ON THE SIGN ON THE DOOR. Suddenly the door opens 
    and Dave steps out onto the street, guitar case in hand.

                                  TREVOR (O.S.)
                    Dave!

      Dave turns, discovers Trevor jogging toward him, waving the 
      L.A. Times. Trevor catches up, hands the newspaper to Dave.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   45.


                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    Front page. Calendar section. 
                    Prudence came through for us.

      Dave finds the page. The story on Dave features the sketch of 
      Dave s dream girl, a photo of the altered Hollywood sign and 
      a photo of Dave on the pier with the Ferris Wheel behind him 
    and the headline: The Face that Launched A Thousand Tips.

                                  DAVE
                    This is amazing.

      A stranger walking down the sidewalk calls out to Dave.

                                  STRANGER
                    Hey, you re that guy! Good luck. 
                    Hope you find her.

                                  DAVE
                    Cheers, mate.

                                  TREVOR
                    The price of fame.

                                  DAVE
                    Gets worse. The local top-40
                    station wants me to come down for 
                    an interview before tonight s show.

                                  TREVOR
                    If Holly still lives in L.A., 
                    she llbe there tonight.

                                  DAVE
                    I sure hope so, because I m a 
                    foreigner with an expired visa who 
                    just took credit for an unlawful 
                    act in a major American newspaper.

      Dave points out the photo of the HOLLY sign, winks.


      Claire walks hurriedly across the parking lot. She eyes a 
      SPEEDY REPOSSESSION truck and boat trailer.


      Claire s dad, BILL ALLEN (still dashing and charismatic at 
    60) stands on the bow of a 10-year-old sport yacht.  Note: 
      these run around $200,000 used. It s not an impressive boat 
      when one contemplates livingin it.

                                  BILL ALLEN
                    I speak as a child of God and 
                    brother to the suffering poor!
                    I speak for those whose land is 
                    being laid waste, whose homes are 
                    being pillaged, whose culture is 
                    being subverted! I speak as a 
                    citizen of the world, for the world 
                    as it stands aghast at the path we 
                    have taken!

    As Bill Allen rails against his fate, we realize there s a 
      thin line between the  crazy  Claire deals with at the 
      hospital and the  crazy  she grew up with...

      REVERSE ANGLE shows us Claire arriving and sidling up beside 
    two bewildered blue collar men wearing SPEEDY REPOSSESSION 
      shirts. They re standing on the dock watching Mr. Allen.  The 
        African-American RepoMan turns to his partner.

                                  REPOMAN
                    I swear I heard this before.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (interjecting)
                    It s Martin Luther King --  The 
                    Trumpet of Conscience. 

    The RepoMan nods -- sounds right. Bill notices his daughter 
    on the dock. He seems to regain some of his composure.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   47.


                                  BILL ALLEN
                    Hey there, Claire Bear. These 
                    gentleman are trying to take my 
                    home, my castle.

                                  CLAIRE
                    It s a boat, Dad.
                          (tothe repomen)
                    Can I write you a check for the 
                    missed payments?

    Off Claire s hopeful, pleading expression.


      Trevor and Claire walk and talk, coffee cups in hand.

                                  CLAIRE
                    The story is about a scholar -- a 
                    university professor. He falls in 
                    love with one of his students.

                                  TREVOR
                    Old story.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   49.


                                  CLAIRE
                    He falls madlyin love with her. 
                    She reciprocates. But the semester 
                    ends. For her it was a passing 
                    fling. For him it was much more.

                                  TREVOR
                    Like I said -- old story.

                                  CLAIRE
                    But it doesn t end there. He can t 
                    stop thinking about her. He stalks 
                    her, leaves drunken messages on her 
                    machine. She reports him to the 
                      university. He resigns in disgrace. 
                    He snaps. He has to get as far away 
                    from her as possible. He changes 
                    his identity. Eventually he can t 
                    even remember who he is. He tells 
                    people he s the god of love.

                                  TREVOR
                    Okay. Not bad. But I ve got a 
                    better one. Let s take your 
                    professor. This time, let s say 
                    he s a real ass hound. Always 
                    seducing the co-eds.Then, 
                      unexpectedly, he falls for one of 
                    his peers -- another professor. 
                    He s head over heels. This morally 
                    bankrupt man finally finds someone 
                    who turns him into the man he was 
                    supposed to be.

      Claire is rapt. She thinks she s hearing Trevor s real story.

                                  CLAIRE
                    And then?

                                  TREVOR
                    Then some jealous co-edhe tossed 
                    away the year before makes it her 
                    mission to spoil his happiness. She 
                    tells the new woman about the girls 
                    he s seduced. Provides names, 
                    numbers. The professor s lover can t 
                    take it. She wants to escape, to 
                    sleep until it doesn t hurt any more. 
                    She s got some pills. She figures the 
                    more she takes, the longer she 
                    sleeps. Our Prince Charming finds her 
                    in bed, but no matter how many times

      There s a long beat as Trevor reflects on the story. Claire s 
      heart goes out to the man in front of her.

                    Poetic justice? Or is it irony?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Trevor, I know I can help you.

                                  TREVOR
                    I m not sure about your ending, 
                    either. A tad hackneyed. Instead of 
                    the insanity thing, let s say he 
                    travels from village to village 
                    wrestling Minotaursfor sacks of

                    Trevor, Marla dumped Isaac today. 
                    There was a big scene here at the 
                    hospital. You have no magic. You 
                    aren t a god.

                                  TREVOR
                          (exasperated, weary)
                    No bow. No arrow. I ve explained 
                    that. I can t make you believe me. 
                    After tonight, I ll have my first 
                    match, and I ll be that much closer 
                    to going home and getting out of 
                    your hair forever.


      Trevor and Prudence walk past the Frank Gehrymasterpiece.

    The song continues to play as CAMERA FINDS Felix and Lita 
      admiring their own handiwork. They have managed to use tarps 
    to cover the appropriate letters.

                                  CLAIRE (O.S.)
                    If I hadn t seen it with my own eyes, 
                    I doubt I would ve believed it.


      Dave, wearing a look of supreme bliss, strides down the 
      sidewalk, turns into the HOLLYWOOD HOSTEL.


      Prudence walks down the street. She s sad, lost in thought. 
      Something catches her attention in a storefront window.

                                  CLAIRE (O.S.)
                    All right. I ll meet you down 
                    there, see if we can t make this 
                    work. You know where we re going?

                                  TREVOR (O.S.)
                    No earthly idea.

      ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE BUSINESS as the window frames Prudence 
    who puts her face against the glass.

                                  CLAIRE (O.S.)
                    That omniscience kindacomes and 
                    goes, huh? It s on Fountain, 
                    between Pacific and Atlantic. How 
                    does one o clock sound?

      Trevor doesn t answer immediately. He s facing his window, 
      staring at something. He almost appears to be in a stupor.

      TREVOR s POV: One bead has moved all the way across the pool 
      hall counter line strung across his bedroom.

                    Trevor?

                          (mystified)
                    I ll be there.

      Claire and Trevor sit at an outdoor table engaged in 
      conversation. From this distance the two look more like 
      friends or people on a date than a doctor and her patient. We 
      leave them feeling as though their relationship evolved into 
      something new.
