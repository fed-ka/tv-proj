A pocket watch. Open. Ticking. Swinging from a chain.
Held by a young man named JOE in a clearing beside a Kansas
corn field. Sky pregnant with rain.
Waiting. He checks the watch, removes his earbud headphones,
stands.
Without much ceremony a BLOODIED MAN in a suit appears from
thin air, kneeling before the young man. Hands and feet
tied. Burlap sack over his head. Muffled screams, gagged.
With no hesitation Joe raises a squat gun and blows the man
apart with a single cough of a shot.
LATER
Joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck.
Cuts open the back of the body's jacket, revealing FOUR bars
of gold taped to the dead man's back. Joe takes them.
Massive, in the middle of nowhere. Black smoke.
JOE (V.O.)
Time travel has not yet been
invented. But twenty five years
from now it will be. Once the
technology exists, it will be
relatively cheap and available to
the public at large. And so. It
will be instantly outlawed, used
only in secret by the largest
criminal organizations. And then
only for a very specific purpose.
Joe drives up and parks his truck, removes the wrapped corpse
from the flatbed.
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It's nearly impossible to dispose
of a body in the future. I'm told.
Tagging techniques, whatnot. So
when these future criminal
organizations in the future need
someone gone, they use specialized
assassins in our present, called
loopers.
A sidecar roadside diner in the middle of nowhere. Joe's
truck in front.
Joe's truck zooms from the flat fields towards a mid sized
city on the horizon.
Joe drives through the sooty city streets. A muted beep, and
he fishes a matchbook sized screen from his pocket.
JOE
Yeah Seth? Yeah. Ok.
4.
A young looper named SETH on the side of the road, kneeling
beside a motorcycle without wheels called a SLAT BIKE. He
kicks it in frustration.
A VAGRANT approaches and SETH pulls a gun, identical to
Joe's.
SETH
Walk around! Around, I'm not
kidding. Wide around, ya shit.
The vagrant crosses the street. Joe pulls up.
JOE
Seth.
SETH
Hi Joe.
JOE
That's new.
Seth kicks the bike.
SETH
Thanks. Goddamn thing. You going
to the Belle?
Seth and Joe.
JOE
Slat Bikes are all junk. Stick
with rubber on the road.
SETH
Yeah but Gat Men pull up in them,
they get respect.
JOE
They get respect cause they run the
town. How much did that thing set
you back? How much?
Seth holds a quarter idly in his palm.
SETH
I was gonna pull up in it.
Tonight. Heads or tails, call it
in the air.
The coin lifts, floats several inches in the air, quivering.
5.
JOE
Congratulations. You're pulling up
with me instead.
Joe notices the floating quarter.
JOE (CONT'D)
And don't, if we're going in, don't
do that.
SETH
Chicks dig TKs.
JOE
It's tacky, don't do it.
Seth catches the quarter, sullen.
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
When the TK mutation started
appearing in the general populace
it was on every magazine - Next
Step in Evolution, what's next.
Everyone got tested. But turns out
this was it, and now it's just a
bunch of assholes thinking they're
blowing your mind by floating
quarters.
A shitty but bright nightclub in the heart of the city.
Flashy people shiver behind a velvet rope, huge black cars,
big rollers in odd suits swept in by the bouncers.
All trying very hard to be big time.
JOE (V.O.)
Big heads. Small potatoes.
Drives past, revving the engine.
Down the street. Joe tosses the keys to an attendant.
A dingy stage door in back of the building. Joe and Seth
ring a buzzer, smile for a camera, and the door opens.
Zach stands waiting, checking his wristwatch, gun in hand.
Obviously performing a similar ritual to Joe's.
JOE (V.O.)
Time travel in the future is so
illegal, that when we sign up for
this job we agree to a very
specific proviso.
8.
Zach raises his gun.
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
If our employers in the future get
busted up by the law, their first
priority is going to be erasing any
trace of their relationship with us
ever existing.
A flash of light, and a HOG TIED MAN with a sack over his
head kneels in front of Zach.
Zach fires, and the man's chest explodes.
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
So. If they're busted, and if
we're still alive 30 years from
now, they'll find our older self
and zap him back to us, like any
other job.
Zach rips open the back of the corpse's jacket, revealing
several dozen gold bars taped to his back.
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
This is called closing your loop.
Zach freezes. Looks at the shape of the corpse's face
through the sack.
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And you get paid out a mythic
amount of money, and you get a
handshake and get released from
your contract. Enjoy the next 30
years.
Joe and the loopers are kicked out by burly GAT MEN, followed
by Kid Blue, pointing and yelling at them. The loopers laugh
their asses off.
Joe's Miata screams through the abandoned city streets,
racing with several other loopers in trucks and sports cars.
IN THE CAR
Jammed with Seth and Loopers, Joe at the wheel. Still so
high. Suddenly one of the Loopers SHOUTS -- Joe slams the
BRAKES
Screaming to a halt just shy of a malnourished BEGGAR KID.
Caught in the headlights. Behind him, a miserable vagrant
village in a field.
IN THE CAR
Joe stares at the kid, frozen. A moment. Then spins the
wheel, peels out. The Loopers hoot and shout. Joe's Miata
screams along the dirt road bordering the vagrant village,
whizzing past open fires and dirty huddled families.
JOE'S FACE - serene and focused. Going somewhere.
Joe drops Seth off at his building with its bright red
garage.
10.
JOE
Sell that goddamn slat bike back.
That's a lot of stupid money.
SETH
I got stupid money.
Seth holds his hand under fuzzy dice hanging from Joe's
mirror, and they spin.
JOE
Alright.
Seth stumbles toward his door, checks his pants.
SETH
I think I did something. You know
what? TKs are special. Fuck you.
JOE
Hey Seth.
Seth slumps against the car.
JOE (CONT'D)
Alright, Zach. What's his payout,
30? 40? If that? That's not
going to last you 30 years. And it
won't get you overseas.
SETH
Overseas...
JOE
So in five, ten years you're back
to riding the rails, or worse
you're like Kid Blue, working as a
gat man, wagging your dick at
loopers and roughing up shop clerks
for payoff money.
SETH
Fuckin Kid Blue.
JOE
Save a little something. Alright?
Cause that'll be yours, and then
you've got yours and that's all
that matters, your life is your
own.
SETH
I gots mine you gots yours. I wish
I was smart like you. Saint Joe.
Seth pats Joe's cheek, and waddles off towards his apartment.
11.
Joe's truck zooms away from the city, into corn fields.
Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away.
A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears before Joe.
Shoots the man in the chest, without hesitation.
FLASH: a hog-tied man with a sack over his head appears.
Singing.
Seth, with his gun raised, hesitates.
SETH (V.O.)
Through the gag and mask, but I
could hear the tune. Deep
memories, my mom in a dark room,
singing. Back warm and safe, when
I coulda still been good. And once
I knew it was him... Joe I
couldn't. I couldn't. I had to
see.
Seth pulls the sack off the man's head.
Seth standing with his gun in his limp arm, receding behind
us as we run away.
SETH (V.O.)
And I had my blunderbuss so I know
he's got about fifteen strides till
he's out of my range. And they
come and go, and I just watch him
till he's gone.
17.
A hunched figure sprints through an abandoned lot towards a
train yard.
It is a 55 YEAR OLD SETH. He limps up to a razor-wire fence
bordering the train yard.
Surveys the sharp wire, rips the lining from his jacket and
wraps first his left hand then his right.
But stops.
On the palm of his right hand, a WEATHERED SCAR. Clearly
carved in the shape of an arrow, pointing down to his wrist.
Old Seth squints at it, confused. He pulls back his sleeve,
revealing his clean bare forearm.
Then his face changes.
Because his arm is no longer bare. Suddenly, out of nowhere,
more intricate scarring has appeared down its length.
The scars spell out clearly: BE AT 75 WIRE STREET IN 15
MINUTES
Old Seth's breath returns, jagged. He pulls his sleeve up
and hoists himself up the fence, climbing fast.
He reaches the top, gets a good grasp on the wire to hoist
himself over... and stops again.
His right hand is missing a finger. The ring finger is just
gone, its stump worn with age.
Old Seth stares. And now his middle finger is gone as well.
A freight train whistle moans. The cars, open and inviting,
leading out of town. Behind him, the city.
Terror and indecision seizes his chest, so much so that it
takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing
has changed to a ragged whistle.
24.
He lifts his hand, now with just two fingers, to his face...
and the smooth scarred hole where his nose used to be.
The train yard far in the distance. Old Seth RUNNING back
into town.
He looks down at his right hand, fingerless now but for his
thumb.
He speeds up, desperate. Cuts through an alley. And has no
right hand, just a stump.
OLD SETH
No no no no no!
A bell-like DING. Old Seth spins, sees a WEDDING BAND lying
on the sidewalk.
He picks it up with the four remaining fingers on his left
hand, stuffs it in his pocket, sobbing.
Bursts out of the alleyway, limping now, straight into the
street and into the headlights of an oncoming car.
The car screeches to a halt, and its harsh white light shows
Old Seth's missing right ear, and deep scars down his face.
IN THE CAR
Old Seth throws open the drivers side door and throws out the
DRIVER. Jams on the gas.
Speeding through the streets, hands slipping on the wheel.
His pant leg crumples. Empty boot tangling with the pedals.
The car hits a pole.
Out climbs what's left of Old Seth, his face mangled, missing
a foot, one arm gone to the elbow.
Street sign - WIRE STREET. The numbers, 45.
He runs. Howling, missing his tongue. Arm totally gone.
Then falls as his leg goes to the knees. And he's crawling,
an animal form, bellowing wordlessly.
Makes it to an iron street-side door. 75. And with his one
arm, slams it.
Slumps against it, heaving. After a long moment it swings
open.
25.
With no hesitation, a BLAST from the darkened doorway, and
Old Seth's head mists open. He slumps to the pavement.
Kid Blue steps from the doorway, drags the body inside.
Deep in the dark doorway we glimpse a DOCTOR in a surgical
frock smeared with bright red blood. The door SLAMS.
Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away. He takes his
stance. Earbud headphones, the drone of French lessons.
A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears kneeling
before Joe. Joe raises his gun without hesitation and shoots
the man in the chest.
Walks to the body, flips it. The man's hands, tied and
purplish. Joe hesitates. Puts his hand next to them.
Similar.
He flips the man onto his back, stares long and hard at the
shape of the man's face under the cloth sack.
Tears it off. An older Asian man's face, frozen in terror.
Joe smirks, the spell broken. His face hardens.
Our montage comes to an end suddenly and all is silent.
Joe in the corn field, in his stance, ready to draw.
But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks his watch,
confused.
2:30 and change. Waits. Watching the blank space where the
man is supposed to appear.
Hand on his gun. Breathing shallow. Something is wrong.
2:32. An eternity. Then, there he is.
But different. Not kneeling. On his side, so he flops over
and has to straighten himself. The man's hands are UNTIED.
Holy shit.
Joe raises his gun, scared. Time slows. Finger tightens on
the trigger.
Then he sees: the man has NO SACK ON HIS HEAD. And the face
that stares back at Joe is his own.
57 YEAR OLD JOE. His eyes fixed on Joe.
And for just one split second, Joe's face slackens, and his
finger eases on the trigger.
It's all the hesitation Old Joe needs. He throws his body
into a spin.
Joe snaps out of it, and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
The shot catches Old Joe square in the back, and the impact
blows him forward. But instead of blood beneath his torn
jacket's back, we see the layered gold bars spill out. They
caught the blast.
In what seems like one fluid motion Old Joe's fingers grab
one of the bars, he spins again, throwing handfuls of dirt
and the bar back towards Joe.
Joe flinches, again just for a moment, and when his eyes
focus again and his arm steadies the gun it's too late.
Old Joe is on top of him, with a heavy blow knocking the gun
aside, and with an even heavier one swinging down on Joe's
head, a fist and then
THE CORN FIELD, HOURS LATER
Joe wakes. Blood caked on his face. Headphones beside him,
still squawking French lessons. Sits up.
27.
JOE
Oh god.
Gold bars scattered in the dirt. But no Old Joe. And no
truck. Joe staggers to his feet, shaky. Head thick. But
realizing.
JOE (CONT'D)
Late to my own funeral.
Joe runs, shaky, towards town. Fishes his phone-device from
his pocket, chucks it.
Across the street, Joe huddles behind a car, breathing hard.
Looks up at his lit window. Debating.
5 floors up, Joe leaps out, hits the fire escape, bullets
shattering the window. Blind with blood, ears ringing, Joe
barrels down the fire escape. A confused blur of iron steps,
slipping and scrambling down, but now the tall gat man is out
the window and shooting down at him.
Somehow Joe slips and rolls, grabs at thin air, falling -
three stories at least, falling.
When he hits the ground the world goes away.
OLD JOE
29.
We abruptly CUT ON to a very familiar scene.
Young Joe stands alone in the corn field, in his stance,
ready to draw. But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks
his watch, confused. 2:30 and change.
This is exactly the scene where Old Joe appears, being
replayed before our eyes. But when Old Joe does APPEAR, it's
different: his hands are tied, his head covered with a sack.
And something very different happens:
Joe raises his gun and without hesitation PULLS THE TRIGGER.
Old Joe's chest explodes. He falls dead.
Joe approaches the body, and slows. Sensing something. He
pulls off the sack. The face of his older self. Old Joe.
He flips him over. Gold bars CLINK beneath a bloody jacket.
Joe has closed his loop.
Out at sea. Joe, bundled against the cold, leans on a
railing, eagerly watching the horizon.
Joe walking the city streets, breathing deep. Alive.
Cloudy and cold. Joe wanders alone. Buffeted by strangers.
Music pumping, Joe deadened at a table, in another world.
Beside him a YOUNG PUNK makes a glass float using his TK
power, then shatters the glass. Red liquid goes everywhere.
A shoot-out between rival gangs. Joe's guns blaze.
A remorseless killer. Blasting away, cold and skillful.
Smashing up shops that won't pay protection. He's muscle.
Snow on the ground.
Old Joe shoots up a storefront with his gang.
The car screeches to a halt on a beach side road. Old Joe
gets out, runs across the beach to the water, pulling his gun
out of its holster. He fires it out to sea till its empty,
then throws the gun into the ocean.
He runs back to his Wife, standing on the beach. They kiss.
They fall to the sand, and kiss.
32.
A cottage in the country.
Old Joe in his mid 50s, his Wife lying on a hammock with him,
reading. Hands lazily entwined. A good life.
Dark cars parked out front. We watch the quiet facade for a
moment too long, violence that we don't want to think about
happening inside.
Then the door BURSTS open and Gangsters drag Joe out, sobbing
thrashing and bleeding from his head.
33.
And appears in front of his younger self.
The scene now plays out as it did the first time. Joe
hesitates, Old Joe gets the upper hand, knocks him out.
Old Joe looks around, gets his bearings. Stares at his
younger self a moment. Then goes to the truck.
Old Joe drives the truck into the city.
Wearing the clerk's jacket, Old Joe takes four aspirin.
Holds his head a minute, rocking gently.
On the street outside the building. Old Joe approaches,
watching the window high above. Weighing his options.
He scans the street. Spots an ARMORED VAN in the alleyway.
Movement from behind it - Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man
loading their bars in the back.
OLD JOE
Shit.
Old Joe turns to go, but STOPS when his eye catches movement
between parked cars.
It's Joe. Young Joe, hid between the cars, looking up at the
apartment building weighing his options.
OLD JOE (CONT'D)
(SOTTO)
Don't do it. Idiot. Don't do it.
After a moment Joe dashes across the street and into the
building. Old Joe stays still a moment, watching him go.
Ducks into shadows as Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man step from
the alleyway, wiping their hands.
KID BLUE
Two more trips.
They enter the building.
Old Joe takes a breath, then casually walks down the
sidewalk, past the alleyway, scoping the Armored Van. A GAT
MAN DRIVER in the driver's seat.
Old Joe dashes out onto the street as gunfire cracks from the
high apartment window. Sharp eyes will notice that Old Joe's
right ear is now clipped off, an old wound.
He dashes towards the apartment door, gun in hand, but stops
when the window five stories above shatters with gunfire.
Old Joe backs up, and sees Joe scrambling down the fire
escape as the TALL GAT MAN fires down at him.
Old Joe takes expert aim with the gat, and fires three shots
upwards. The Tall Gat Man's gunfire stops.
Joe slips on the fire escape, falls two stories and lands on
the hood of a parked car.
Old Joe goes to him, checks his pulse.
Behind them the TALL GAT MAN hits the sidewalk with a SPLAT.
Old Joe goes to the tall gat man's remains, picks another gat
out of them, and goes back to Joe's inert body on the car
hood.
OLD JOE
Stupid little shit.
He lifts him in his arms.
Joe wakes slowly, pained. Lying alone in an abandoned lot on
the outskirts of town.
Slowly he takes stock of himself. Nothing broken. A tight
bandage on his ear.
A mournful train whistle, and he turns. Through a chain link
fence, the train yard. He was put here for a reason.
A man and a young boy in rags hop onto an empty cargo car,
heading out of town. Joe watches the boy, his eyes angry.
Stands shakily. And walks away from the train yard.
Something like a HELICOPTER sweeps overhead, a spotlight
zigzagging the area. Joe ducks into shadows, heading towards
the city.
More helicopters sweep the streets, searchlights blazing.
Cars with Gat Men circle slowly, shining spotlights
themselves.
Joe leaps from the shadows, ducks behind a dumpster. Barely
avoiding the light. He won't last long out here.
JOE
Where would I go if I were me.
37.
He sprints into an alleyway, but Gat Men are coming down the
other side with flashlights.
Goes back the way he came, turns a corner.
Joe finds himself in front of a familiar BRIGHT RED GARAGE.
Seth's apartment. Three stories up, Seth's darkened window.
He looks up at it, hesitant but desperate.
Gat Men in cars and helicopters patrol the streets.
Kid Blue sits on the curb, smoking a cigarette. Seething at
his bandaged hand. Deep in thought. His eyes lift. An
idea.
The familiar red garage. And three stories up, Seth's lit
window.
Kid Blue pulls a small caliber gun from a holster concealed
on his boot, enters the building.
The sun rises over a flat endless field of corn stalks.
39.
We push forward through the green stalks at a brisk pace.
They part before us, endless, hypnotic.
Old Joe emerges from the corn fields bordering the sidecar
roadside diner. Fumbles in his jacket, dry-swallows four
aspirin. Regains his footing. Walks around the diner
cautiously.
Parked in back behind a dumpster, SETH'S SLAT BIKE.
...and hits the dusty parking lot running. Towards the corn.
Kid Blue squats on his haunches with four more Gat Men, their
guns trained on the diner door. Three Gat Men burst out,
followed by Joe.
DINER GAT MAN
The back, he's running!
JOE
Around back!
50.
They all run around back, where Old Joe is halfway to the
corn but not there yet.
The seven Gat Men and Kid Blue and Joe fire their guns after
him while running but they're too far away (and they're
running) so nothing hits. Joe blasts at the old man blindly,
sprinting with all his might, eyes streaming tears in the
dust.
When Old Joe hits the wall of corn he seems to vanish. Four
of the Gat Men follow him in, while the remaining pursuers
slow to a stop, doubled over, panting. Defeated.
It takes a few seconds for Kid Blue to realize that Joe is
there with them. It takes another second for Joe to realize
that the dynamic has changed. He turns and runs back towards
the diner, Kid Blue and the Gat men in pursuit. One of the
Gat Men fires.
KID BLUE
Alive! No, alive!
Joe makes it to the Slat Bike, jumps on, hits the ignition.
CLICK.
JOE
No fuck no fucking piece of shit
CLICK CLICK. The Kid and the Gats closing in, and just the
moment that Kid Blue lays his hands on the back of the bike
the engine turns over with a ROAR.
The back of the bike kicks up, heat and air blasts from the
open slats beneath, blowing Kid Blue back on his ass. The
bike HOVERS a few feet off the ground.
Joe roars off into the corn. The Kid is on his feet running
back to the Gat Men.
KID BLUE
The tracker! Get the tracker!
Joe riding at full speed through the thick corn stalks. He
BAILS, snapping through corn stalks and rolling to a painful
stop. The bike ZOOMS onward through the stalks, quickly out
of sight.
Pained, Joe lies still, breathing hard. Pulls Old Joe's torn
paper from his pocket. On one side, the number Old Joe
scribbled: 1027363259 He flips it over. It's a map.
Mostly of empty farm land, bisected by a bold highway and
scattered farm houses.
One of them is CIRCLED IN BLACK.
SARA
51.
A bare field of churned chocolatey earth. Near its edge juts
the dead stump of an old tree.
A YOUNG WOMAN in work clothes named SARA chops away at the
trunk with a large axe. Over and over, splintering it apart.
Endless plains of corn surround the field. In the near
distance, a two story farm house with an adjacent barn.
Sara focused on her work as the sun rises.
Sara fiddles with a garbage can sized DEVICE, and with a
crackle of mechanic thrusters it floats up and over the corn
fields, spraying something chemical.
She sits on a rocking chair, and mimes smoking an invisible
cigarette.
Our first good look at her face. Clear and beautiful, but it
has been here for awhile.
The morning light changes from steel blue to pale white.
Rocking gently, fake smoking and drinking coffee. Not going
anywhere.
Sara storms down the porch and stalks across the lawn,
shotgun extended. Not fucking around.
Does not slow her pace until she is ten yards from the corn
fields, where she plants herself and shouts:
SARA
Listen up fucker. I have shot and
buried three vagrants in the past
year. If you want to know the
Christ's honest truth I'm starting
to get a taste for it. So I don't
care what hobo sob story you've
got, I get a dozen a week and it
cuts no cash with me. It's me and
my husband here, we're broke and
angry at our lot in this world and
heavily armed. So take some corn
and move on, but if you show your
face again I will cut you the fuck
in half.
Silence. Just the wind in the corn. A long beat. Then Sara
turns, walks briskly back.
Moments later Joe's face pokes through the corn stalks. He
takes in the farm. The barn behind it. The fallow field.
LATER
Joe sits in the same spot, a few feet in the corn but with a
clear sight line at the house.
His gun on his knee.
JOE'S FACE - Pale, sweating. Something's wrong. He winces.
Pinches his eyes. Headache.
The sun pounds down. He looks at the piece of map.
JOE
C'mon. C'mere. C'mon. C'mon.
C'mon.
53.
Helicopters sweep by.
Raining. The Gat Man pushes the Kid out the back entrance
door, into the alley. The Kid instinctively turns towards
the street.
But the Gat Man steers him back, deeper into the alley. The
Kid realizes what this means. Everything changes.
KID BLUE
Oh no. Oh no no no no
He fights in vain to break from the Gat Man's grip. Weeps,
begs, clasps at whatever he can grab.
The Gat Man turns a corner -- towards the alley's dead end.
KID BLUE (CONT'D)
No! No! No no no no!
Shrieking. Annoyed, the Gat Man throws the Kid hard to the
concrete. The Gat Man pulls his gun, raises it without
ceremony.
BANG. The Gat Man's face explodes. Staggers, his gun FIRES
into the wall. He drops like a doll.
Kid Blue lies in the rain, hyperventilating. His pant leg
hiked up, showing his boot with its holster.
In his mangled left hand, the small caliber PISTOL he keeps
stashed. His pinkie on the trigger.
KID BLUE (CONT'D)
Oh.
Cradling his crushed hand, dazed, he scampers off like a
soaked rat.
Silent and still. Sara comes out onto the front porch. She
gathers up a few things, turns out the porch light.
Notices a floodlight still lit on the BARN across the yard.
She turns the porch light back on.
The dark corn fields, silent and vaguely threatening. She
steps back in the house, emerging again with the shotgun.
55.
Sara stalks towards the barn, shotgun in hand. Shadows loom
across the yard. All is silent.
She reaches the barn. A hard pool of light from a mounted
floodlight falls off to inky darkness.
Hits a metal switch near the barn door and the light snaps
off. In its absence the darkness swarms.
She briskly walks back towards the house, but slows. Stops.
Turns. In the darkness by the barn, crunch crunch. Crunch.
And maybe a shape. Deep in the swarming dark.
SARA
Hey. Who's there.
Sara levels the shotgun at the darkness, and steps back.
Quiet but definite - crunch crunch. And now, definitely a
shape. A man. coming towards her.
SARA (CONT'D)
Stop right there. Stop!
Joe slumped over unconscious where we left him, in the corn.
Sara's shout wakes him with a start. Sweating, pasty.
Disoriented. Something is wrong with him.
In a flash of panic he parts the corn stalks, sees Sarah
backing away from the barn. The dark hulking figure of a man
pursues her slowly but steadily.
JOE
SHIT
His hand goes to his holster but his gun has fallen out, he
scrambles in the dirt for it.
Sara backing up still, shotgun leveled. The man, still in
darkness, comes towards her.
SARA
You stop right there, you stop!
She fires her gun in the air. The man pauses, but then
continues towards her. She trips on a root, FALLS.
56.
Joe's gun leveled, face set. But the porch light on the
man's face: it is not Old Joe.
It is a man in his 30s, filthy, with down's syndrome. A
greasy sign around his neck: PLEASE HELP MUWTE FOOD $ GOD
BLESS YOU
Joe lowers his gun, face melting.
SARA
Jee sus.
(to the MUTE VAGRANT)
Hey, hey. I'm going to get you
SOME FOOD-
But the man scampers off, leaving his sign.
SARA (CONT'D)
...great.
The child, in darkness, watching. He recedes into the
bedroom, his hand slipping off the glass.
Sara stands, picks up the sign, calls after the MUTE.
SARA
Hey you forgot your greasy goddamn
hobo sign oh for godssakes.
(turns to Joe)
Alright, what are you?
Joe turns away from her quickly, but doubles over, crumpling
to a heap on the grass. Sara checks his face.
57.
SARA (CONT'D)
Hey. Look at - hey. The fuck-
ehh.
Joe PUKES. She steps away. Takes a moment. Breathes.
She drags Joe up onto the porch, under the light.
SARA
Hey. Up here, at the light. Hey.
Sara SLAPS HIM. Hard. His eyes snap open. He sees her face.
She feels his head. Checks his eyes. Cherry red and veined,
swollen under the lids.
JOE
(TOTALLY GONE)
My head... splitting apart... time
eventualities, he said-
SARA
How long since you dropped?
JOE
DROPPED
Sara mimes an eye dropper.
SARA
Dropped, or what the kids call it.
JOE
A day.
SARA
One day. Wow.
She leans back on her haunches, looks at him, deep in
thought. Deciding what to do. Joe lies prone, shaking,
sweating.
JOE
Thirsty. I can't feel my legs
SARA
You're withdrawing from a synthetic
barbiturate. It's a quick punch
but it's this bad a day in, without
care you might not make it through
the night.
Sara looks at his shoes. Beneath the caked mud, fine
leather. Her eyes linger on his gun. They turn cold.
58.
She stands quickly without a word, vanishing into the house.
Joe lies still, breath shallow. Turns his head, hazy.
JOE
Thirsty. Thirsty.
Soft footsteps approach. Small bare feet padding towards him
through the front door. A young boy steps out onto the
porch, 6 years old, named CID.
Cid looks Joe over. His eyes linger on Joe's gun. Then he
kneels, his small hands feeling Joe's sweaty face. Pushes a
straw to Joe's lips. Joe's hands clasp around a plastic cup
with a cartoon tiger, and he drinks.
SARA (O.S.)
(SHARP)
Cid. C'mere monkey.
Cid goes back into the house, leaving his cup with Joe.
A darkened highway, the lights of the farm house distant. A
small STAKE BED TRUCK rumbles up, stops on the soft shoulder.
Sara at the wheel. Sits a second. Then climbs out.
Roughly pulls Joe out of the flatbed. He lands in the dirt.
Sara avoids looking at him, closes up the flatbed.
Joe weakly grabs her ankle. She pries his hand off, and
discovers CID'S CUP in the dirt beside him. Takes it
angrily, strides back to the truck.
Dawn breaks. Exhausted Gat Men dutifully patrol the streets
with flashlights, stopping every passerby.
On the outskirts of the city. Vagrant fires burn distant
orange. A large drainage pipe drips into a brackish creek.
A bank of fog clears, revealing Sara's face looking down at
us. She slaps us hard.
SARA
Hey.
Sara's face. SLAP!
SARA
Hey.
Sara's face. SLAP!
61.
Old Joe hides in the trees across the street from a suburban
track home.
A young boy in a bright jacket runs out the front door and
off down the street.
Old Joe checks the folded map in his trembling hands. On it,
this house is circled in black, exactly like Sara's farm.
Stuffing the map in his pocket, he pushes out through the
trees.
Sara approaches the barn, her shotgun in hand.
Joe sits on the ground just outside the open barn door, the
metal cot behind him still handcuffed to his wrist.
Methodically cleaning and loading his gun.
SARA
Toss it.
Joe freezes. Then, half annoyed
JOE
I just finished cleaning - alright.
Tosses it into the dirt. Sara lowers the shotgun slightly.
SARA
How do you feel?
JOE
I'm at thirty percent.
SARA
Take it slow and by the end of the
week you'll be at fifty. Good.
She tosses him a key, he unlocks his handcuff.
SARA (CONT'D)
I took you in so you wouldn't die,
and now you're not going to die.
(MORE)
63.
SARA (CONT'D)
So take the morning to rest, then
you need to get off my farm.
JOE
I can't do that.
SARA
I'm sorry?
JOE
I need to stay here for a little
while longer.
SARA
I am not cool with that.
JOE
Well I'm sorry.
SARA
Well I'm sorry too, you just lost
your take the morning to rest
privileges, get off my farm.
JOE
No.
Sara raises the shotgun.
SARA
Get off my farm.
JOE
No. You couldn't scare a retarded
hobo with that thing. Literally.
SARA
This is a Remington 870, one blast
could cut you the fuck in half.
JOE
And that's, that's telling. You're
holding a gun. I say I'm not
afraid, so you describe the gun to
me. But it's not the gun I'm not
afraid of.
(BEAT)
What are you gonna shoot in the
air? Blow a hole in your barn? To
scare me? Go ahead. But you
couldn't let me die, you won't kill
me.
SARA
So now I saved your life that makes
me weak?
64.
JOE
Look I'm not a threat to you or
your boy. I need to be on your
property but I'd prefer to not have
any contact with you at all, I'll
stay in the fields. There's just
one thing you need to do for me,
and you won't have to deal with me
again.
He takes the map from his pocket, unfolds it. Tosses it over
to her.
JOE (CONT'D)
Just, verify for me that's your
house on the map. So I know I'm in
the right place.
SARA
What is this?
JOE
A map.
SARA
That's my house. Why is it marked?
JOE
Doesn't matter. Ok. I'll be out
of the barn in an hour, if you can
spare it I'll take the water jug
with me. Does that well have
water? I'll fill it from there.
Sara turns the map over. Sees the NUMBER that Old Joe wrote
on the back. 07153902935.
And everything changes.
SARA
What is this.
She shows him the number. She is not asking what the number
is - she knows. Joe is suddenly not so relaxed.
SARA (CONT'D)
What is this.
JOE
Does that mean something to you?
For the first time in their conversation, Joe looks in her
eyes. Sara stares daggers, searching. Very different than
she was ten seconds ago.
Joe scoots back
65.
JOE (CONT'D)
HEY-
And without hesitating Sara hefts the shotgun and SHOOTS HIM.
BLAST! Rips his shirt open bloody, blows him back screaming.
Old Joe STOPS in his tracks, children running around him.
His hand goes to his temple.
Fog clears from Sara blasting us with her shotgun.
Old Joe's hand runs from his temple to his neck. Feels a new
but old scar, just a little divot behind his ear.
A suburban park. On its far end, a birthday party.
The YOUNG BOY in the bright jacket we saw run out of the
house earlier sits alone under a tree.
Old Joe approaches him.
66.
OLD JOE
Hi. Daniel, right? I'm Chad's
father. Aren't you going to come
over? We're doing cake.
DANIEL
It's ice cream cake and I can't eat
ice cream. Cause of the milk.
OLD JOE
Well you should join the party even
if you don't have cake. You have a
birthday coming up?
DANIEL
In July. We were gonna go to the
lake but I don't think we are now.
OLD JOE
I'm sorry.
Old Joe leaves, walks across the grass. Having trouble
breathing.
The same track home Old Joe studied from the trees earlier.
Daniel trots towards it, coming home from the birthday party.
Well tended by someone who loves growing things. Laurels,
ivy on trellises, flowers and trees.
Daniel comes through the side gate. Lifts the back door
matt, revealing a dusty key.
Old Joe. Sitting in a corner of the yard. Face set hard.
Daniel stands, key in hand. Drops the matt. Slow motion.
Turns. Sees Old Joe, standing now.
Stillness between them. OLD JOE'S FACE. Struggling to be
stone, and then it is.
He draws his gun in one fluid motion and FIRES.
We don't hear the shot. We just hear the garden, the wind
through the plants.
68.
And we just see Old Joe's face. Struggling now to remain
stone.
Numb he puts his gun away and exits.
Old Joe walks across the park. Map in his hand. Children
play in the distance. Children's voices all around.
Old Joe spins, his breath up into his head.
The map falls to the ground. The park around him, green and
full of children.
He keels over onto his knees and cries. Grabs the grass,
holds it in his fingers, thick and green.
Old Joe. Staring at the grass. On the map beside him:
three circled houses around the city. And the torn corner.
They sit on the steps, Joe stripped to the waist. Sara picks
salt chunks from his chest with tweezers and antiseptic.
Joe surveys the surrounding land, cleaning his gun.
JOE
We're surrounded by the corn, that
leaves us blind. He can get within
fifty yards of the house without a
hawk spotting him.
(BEAT)
What makes sense is, we burn the
fields, level them.
Sara realizes he's seriously asking.
SARA
No you cannot burn down my corn
fields.
JOE
What kind of equipment's in the
barn?
SARA
Farm equipment.
JOE
Nothing that shoots.
SARA
No farm equipment that shoots. No.
70.
Joe finishes assembling his gun. Sara's eyes flick to it.
SARA (CONT'D)
You use what you need, set up
anywhere. But one thing, I don't
want you talking to Cid. I watch
my son, you watch the corn. That's
the deal.
JOE
Good by me.
He hisses as she applies antiseptic to a gash in his arm.
SARA
Hold still. Easy for things to get
infected on a farm, start falling
off.
(SOTTO)
Pussy.
Caught off guard, Joe almost smiles. Then grimaces.
JOE
If I'm out here and you're in the
house we're gonna need some way to
communicate.
SARA
There's a dinner bell down by the
barn, ring that if someone's
coming, I'll hear it.
JOE
Dinner bell. We need walkies, or
buzzers.
SARA
Dunno what we've got but I'll look.
She spots Cid at the screen door, watching them.
SARA (CONT'D)
Cid.
She goes to take him inside.
JOE
Got any ammo for that shotgun?
That isn't a seasoning?
but it's Joe who wakes up with a start. Slumped against the
steps, gun in hand.
Cid's hand on his forehead. Cid steps back quickly, puts his
finger to his lips. Shhh.
72.
Old Joe. Running hard. Sirens, flashlights behind him.
Being chased.
Zig zags through an alleyway, a pursuing car smashing up
behind him.
Bursts out onto the street, nearly hit by another car.
Shouts all around, a few shots. Surrounding. He runs.
Cars, motorcycles, cop prowlers, all roar to life and blaze
through the city streets in one direction.
Kid Blue, squatting in the 10th story of a half finished
highrise, looks down on the activity in the streets.
Spread on the floor are maps with notes. He's been searching
for Old Joe.
And now his eyes are alight. He bolts for the stairs.
A small park on one block. With a playground. Swings, and a
merry-go-round. Gat men sweep the park.
75.
After they pass, Old Joe's face pops up under the merry-go-
round. He crouches in a shallow space beneath it.
He sees: Across from the park, a cheap APARTMENT BUILDING.
He checks his map - the 2nd circled address. Kid number two.
He waits.
Sara chops the dead tree trunk in the field, greatly
diminished but still formidable. Joe approaches.
JOE
Can't you pull that out with a
plow?
SARA
Uh huh.
She keeps chopping.
JOE
I found a, in the barn I found some
parts, and I made a, thing.
Joe pushes one of Cid's BUZZERS into her hands, which we now
see is a colorful plastic frog toy with a light bulb nose.
JOE (CONT'D)
If you see anything, just push
that, and,
Joe pushes the button on his buzzer, and Sara's lights up and
vibrates. She regards the toy, then stares hard and cold at
Joe.
JOE (CONT'D)
It's important.
SARA
When?
JOE
Last night. He woke me up. Don't
tell him I told you though, he...
Sara rolls her eyes, turns away. Starts chopping again. Joe
doesn't leave.
SARA
What?
JOE
You said you were his mom.
76.
SARA
Uh huh.
JOE
He told me you're not.
This hits Sara hard. She resumes chopping to cover it.
SARA
He said that?
JOE
If he's not your son who is he?
SARA
(SHARP)
He's my son.
(BEAT)
I had Cid when I was twenty two.
But I didn't want to give up my
life. In the city.
The word city has weight for her. Implies volumes.
SARA (CONT'D)
So I dropped Cid with my mom, here.
And my sister. And they saw how I
was living and they took him. My
sister raised him here, she loved
him. He called her mom.
JOE
How'd she get killed?
When Sara's eyes hit him they're daggers.
JOE (CONT'D)
Cid told me. You have to talk to
him about it.
Icy silence from Sara, and an odd stare.
SARA
I told you one thing, I told you to
stay away from my son.
JOE
He asked about my gun. You think
this is going to go away if you
don't talk to him about it but it's
just gonna grow
SARA
Stay out of it. Stay the fuck away
from my son.
77.
She goes back to chopping. Joe lingers, then leaves. She
hacks away.
Sara sits with coffee, looking out at the fields. Deep in
thought.
She takes a drag from her pretend cigarette.
A motel style building. Gat Men in cars pass occasionally
with spotlights and radios, but the activity has calmed.
Old Joe slips around a corner. Staying hid. Checks the
address on the map. 12 Talbott Dr, #205.
Makes a break for stairs leading to the 2nd level. But just
at that moment a car pulls into the building's lot.
Old Joe ducks under the stairs. Holding his breath.
The car parks. Door slams. Footsteps. A WOMAN. Slumping
exhausted, up the stairs.
And through the slatted steps Old Joe sees her face flash by.
It is Suzie, the girl from Abe's brothel. Old Joe's face,
pure disbelief. He recognizes her instantly. It can't be.
He gingerly steps half a foot out. Looking up he can see the
apartment doors above. Suzie walks down the landing.
Towards apartment 205.
Jesus it can't be.
Then she passes it. Keeps walking. Old Joe's eyes,
relieved.
She stops at the next door over, knocks. It opens, vaguely
indistinct conversation between her and the girl that
answers.
SUZIE
Sorry, I know I promised five, you
know how it gets.
GIRL NEIGHBOR
Don't worry sugar. She was no
problem. Gat men searched through
here, lookin for god knows...
Suzie disappears into the apartment. Re-emerges, holding a
sleeping 6 year old girl. She whispers goodbye to the
neighbor and walks back to APARTMENT 205. She enters.
78.
Old Joe, frozen. Gun in his hand. Face numbly: You have to
be shitting me.
He climbs the stairs. On the 2nd story landing. To 205.
Breath held, back against the wall. Peeks in the window.
On the couch, Suzie holding her daughter. Head in her lap.
Stroking her hair. Suzie's back is to us, and with her long
red hair down, she is eerily reminiscent of Old Joe's wife.
Old Joe watches them for a long time.
Joe sits, watching the corn. It rustles in the wind. Hand
on his blunderbuss. Beside it, his frog buzzer.
The tension is constant. And it's a long, long day.
Sara walks fast down the hall
Cid's screams from the house, clear as day.
Joe paces in front of the barn. Turns his head back towards
the house, not sure what to think.
The screams stop. Joe turns uneasily back to the swaying
corn.
A Gat Man named CANADY strolls out of a donut shop, coffee in
hand, and gets in his car.
BANG and the drivers side window explodes outward bloody.
A moment, then Kid Blue stumbles out, holding his ears in
pain. Off down the alley and out of sight.
Just outside the barn, a trap door covered with earth opens
two inches. Joe and Cid prop it open, and peer out at the
house.
Joe reaches down to help Cid out. Looking down at Cid in a
hole with a trap door. Like Seth.
He grabs Cid's hand and lifts him out.
Sara comes out, sees Cid and her face breaks with relief.
Cid runs to her, and in the distance they embrace.
91.
Sara and Joe share a look. Joe quickly turns his eyes back
to the corn fields.
Kid Blue emerges from a passage, into the parking lot. Looks
up at Suzie's apartment door. Then down the street. A few
drops of rain fall.
Driving on a highway along the beach. A few drops of rain on
the windshield. Old Joe (late 40s) and his Wife in intense
conversation, her hand on his.
92.
OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)
But I will.
WIFE (IN FRENCH)
You want to, I know that. But you
won't.
OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)
I'd do anything for you.
WIFE (IN FRENCH)
You'd do. You'd kill for me, you'd
take life for me. But I don't want
that. You kill for what you love,
but someone loves the person you
kill, and it starts again. I don't
want that. I can't love a killer.
What would you give up for me?
That's yours?
OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)
Anything.
She smiles but does not believe him. Old Joe sees this. A
moment, in thought.
The car screeches to a stop, and Old Joe runs to the sea.
THROWS his gun in the ocean. Above the waters, the sun
breaks the clouds. Rain falls.
He runs back to her. Falls on her. Kissing her. He holds
her face like the most precious thing in the world.
OLD JOE
Anything.
Oddly quiet. Old Joe walks down the sidewalk towards the
side entrance to the theater. Face uncovered. In plain
sight. Not caring. Stops 30 feet shy of the entrance, at a
street garbage can.
He draws his gun and leans over to drop it into the can. He
lets it dangle from his fingers above the trash can.
His pocket watch, hanging open from its chain. The picture
of his Wife inside. Spinning. His gun slowly slipping from
his grasp.
93.
With each spin of the watch, the photo of his Wife appears
cloudier. Blurred. Indistinct.
Gun on the tips of his fingers, about to fall. Then the
photo is nearly gone.
OLD JOE'S EYES.
The thrown gun splashes in the sea, and Old Joe turns back to
the beach. But where his Wife was in the previous memory,
now there is the FOG.
A wall of it, massive, reaching to the sky. Old Joe dwarfed
against it. Caught between the roiling waves and this wall of
nothingness falling towards him.
OLD JOE'S EYES.
The gun on his fingertips. About to fall. A moment of
decision.
Joe and Sara fall out and down the stairs.
The front door and windows EXPLODE in a burst of splinters
and glass.
From a high vantage point. Cars, bikes, Gat Men on foot, all
heading towards the club. An army, all meeting at the Belle
Aurore. Massing to attack.
Moments after the blast. Joe and Sara lie in the dirt.
Jesse's TRUCK parked nearby.
Joe stirs first. Stands shakily. The front door jam is
splintered. Windows broken. He goes inside. Sara gets up,
staggers in after him.
SARA
Cid! Cid!
JOE (O.S.)
Cid!
Joe bursts out of the screen door, holding his Blunderbuss
and wiping off Jesse's gat.
Bloody Cid-sized footprints lead out the screen door and
streak across the lawn, into the corn.
Sara comes out after Joe, sees him heading for the corn.
SARA
What are you doing with those guns?
What are you going to do?
She lunges for him, wild. Wrenches his arm and he spins,
throwing her to the ground.
101.
JOE
How did your sister die?
Sara holds his gaze. Then everything breaks inside her and
she collapses in sobs. Heaving.
JOE (CONT'D)
That happened to her. Cid.
(BEAT)
Jesus. Jesus he killed her
This breaks Sara out of her sobs
SARA
No! No he was climbing a
bookshelf, it fell back on him. He
has no control, he gets scared, it
explodes.
JOE
What is it a TK mutation?
SARA
Joe someday he'll learn to control
it.
JOE
Yeah I know he will. Imagine what
he could do.
SARA
If he did good with it! If he grew
up good!
JOE
He doesn't.
Joe heads to the corn, Sara scampers after him but slips on
the wet grass, and Joe hits the corn with a head start.
SARA
You stay away from him! Cid! Cid!
She runs into the corn.
WITH SARA as she stumbles blindly through the tall stalks.
SARA
Cid! Make a noise baby, call to
me! Cid!
WITH JOE through the corn, following traces of blood on the
stalks.
102.
SARA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
You stay away from Joe, you come to
me! Cid!
Tries cocking the GAT but it's broken. Tosses it, wields the
Blunderbuss.
Joe breaks out of the corn, panting. He steps out into the
middle of the highway.
Storm clouds on the horizon. He cleans and readies his
Blunderbuss.
105.
Clothes and boxes piled in the back of Jesse's truck. Sara
loads one last bundle. Calls to Cid, in the front seat.
SARA
Ok baby, we're going.
Joe waits. Then, a CLOUD OF DUST on the distant highway. He
tenses. The cloud gets closer. It is a truck. An armored
truck.
Joe squints. It's the ARMORED TRUCK that Kid Blue loaded his
gold bricks into. The front windshield blown in.
The truck stops fifty feet away, and Old Joe steps out. He
throws a gold bar, which lands in the dusty highway between
them.
OLD JOE
Bon jour. You take this truck, you
take your money, and you go live
your life. No one's coming after
you. I fixed it.
JOE
And you go kill the boy. That's
how you fix it.
OLD JOE
That's how. You got your life
back, you better think right now
about what that's worth to you.
JOE
My life? Your life. Becoming you.
106.
Joe raises his Blunderbuss and FIRES. Too far away, the shot
scatters. The old man flinches, backs away.
Joe walks forward towards Old Joe, stepping over the gold.
OLD JOE
Stupid little shit! You let him
live, he's gonna take away
everything that's yours, everything
that's mine! You seen what the
boy's gonna become.
JOE
I haven't seen that yet.
Joe fires again, close enough now to draw blood off Old Joe's
chest and knock him back.
Out of nowhere a SLAT BIKE careens around the van, which has
until now blocked our line of sight down the highway.
Kid Blue.
The bike clips Joe's leg, sending him spinning violently to
the dusty pavement.
The bike shoots off down the highway, a cloud of dust in its
wake. It takes a hundred yards for the Kid to pull it to a
stop and spin it around.
Joe is hurt bad. He grapples for his blunderbuss.
Kid Blue guns the engine, gat in hand. Levels it, steady as
a rock.
Joe shoots at the Kid, but he's out of range, the gun fires
scattershot.
Kid Blue fires, a bullet hits dangerously close to Joe.
Panicked, Joe begins firing at the pavement around him, round
after fiery round.
Kicking up dust. Lots of dust. Raising a cloud.
KID BLUE'S POV - zooming towards Joe, now obscured in a cloud
of dust and smoke. He fires his gat into the cloud, tries to
slow the bike but can't in time.
In the dust cloud Joe hears the bike roaring down upon him.
He covers up and when he feels the bike roaring past blindly
FIRES his buss.
A moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud. Without
a driver. It skids, crashes.
When the dust clears away Joe lies still, arms over his head.
107.
Besides him, the broken remains of Kid Blue.
Painfully, Joe raises himself. Then realizes:
Old Joe is gone.
Sara starts the truck up.
SARA
Here we go. Give it a wave
goodbye.
They roll down the dirt road that leads to the highway.
At the far end of it, at a distance but walking towards them,
is the dark figure of Old Joe. Gun in hand.
Sara hesitates a minute, then guns it. Straight for him.
CID
STOP
SARA
Duck down baby
CID
Stop please he can shoot us
SARA
Just stay down
Half the distance closed, but he's still far off. A shot
cracks the front grill, another cracks the windshield.
CID
Stop!
The truck lurches horribly, and flips straight back in a
graceful arc, landing upsidown.
Sara and Cid, dazed, hanging by their seatbelts.
SARA
Are you ok?
CID
I'm sorry
In the rear view mirror, Sara sees Old Joe getting closer.
SARA
You're ok. C'mon baby we have to
run now.
108.
She unfastens them and they both climb out, and Old Joe stops
suddenly, taking aim.
Sara pulls Cid behind the flatbed for cover as two bullets
glance off the overturned truck.
SARA (CONT'D)
We're going into the fields. I
want you to run, I'll be right
behind you, don't look back. Okay?
Old Joe lowers his gun and runs towards them.
SARA (CONT'D)
Go!
They both sprint off the road.
The wide bare field. Cid runs ahead towards the corn, Sara
not far behind. The earth soft, their feet sink in, like a
nightmare.
Old Joe crosses the road and chases them onto the field,
firing at them on the run.
Bullets thunk in the earth. Sara stumbles, exhausted. Cid
turns, about thirty feet ahead of her.
Old Joe stops running and steadies his gun.
A distant gunshot CRACK. A fan of crimson blood sprays from
Cid's head. His neck twists and he crumples to the ground.
SARA
NO!
Sara is stopped in her tracks by an invisible force.
SARA (CONT'D)
No Cid no!
The topsoil of the earth around them RISES in a fine dust.
Old Joe reacts as the topsoil rises, an eerie moment.
109.
Sara struggles to reach Cid but is still about twenty feet
behind him.
Cid raises his head. The bullet grazed his jawline. Not
severe but lots of blood.
Cid's eyes locked hateful on Old Joe. Blood soaks his shirt.
Far behind him, the barn splinters apart as if in a tornado.
SARA
No!
With a sudden jolt the field ripples out from Cid, like a
stone thrown in a pond.
Sara lifts into the air.
Old Joe is hefted off the ground. His gun falls.
Joe struggling through the fields, limping, desperate.
Something like a furious wind rushes through the stalks.
Cid stands. Intense, eyes dark, in another place.
Old Joe, suspended mid-air, realizes what's about to happen.
He lifts his hand defensively and SCREAMS
Cid's face straining, about to scream.
Cid's focus adjusts from Old Joe to Sara. She floats,
reaching out to him. Frightened. Yelling something he can't
hear but he can see her eyes.
Cid's face breaks. He barely mouths the word
CID
MOM
And everything FALLS. Sara, Old Joe, the earth. All comes
crashing down.
The corn stalks shiver then are still.
110.
Joe breaks out of the stalks and onto the field. Gasping for
breath. Gets his bearings. In the far distance across the
field, Old Joe, Sara and Cid.
Too far.
Cid runs to Sara, who sits up slowly. They embrace.
SARA
You did good, baby. You did so
good. I love you.
Behind them, Old Joe struggles to his feet. Sara kisses Cid.
SARA (CONT'D)
Into the fields. Run now baby.
Go.
CID
NO
SARA
GO NOW
CID
No no mom no
SARA
You go!
She pushes him away and Cid runs. Then she turns. Standing
her ground. Directly between Old Joe and Cid.
Old Joe TRIPS in the mud, fumbles his gun. Sees Cid
approaching the safety of the CORN STALKS. Blocked by Sara.
OLD JOE
Move!
Still too far away, struggling as fast as he can, helpless as
Old Joe closes in on Sara. He fires his buss at Old Joe, but
is way out of range.
Old Joe gets his gun, rises with it. Cid about to hit the
stalks. Sara between them.
Cid nears the corn fields, running. Seconds from safety.
111.
Old Joe. Gun raised. Pocket watch wrapped around it. His
wife's picture in it. Clear as day.
No time to move around Sara. Now or never.
Joe running, useless gun in hand.
JOE
No!
Sara, not going anywhere.
OLD JOE
I'm sorry
He pulls the trigger.
Joe running. Time slows. Watching:
Everything is a little surreal. Dream-like. Slow.
Old Joe shoots Sara.
We hear no gunshot. Just the wind in the corn, and young
Joe's breathing. She falls, giving him a clear shot at Cid.
JOE WATCHING:
Just as Old Joe gets him in his sights, Cid breaches the corn
fields and is gone, vanishing in the stalks.
Old Joe lowers his gun, stunned but still frantic. He
stumbles towards the corn, still far off, his face breaking.
Trips, falls in the mud. Corn field vast in front of him.
Cid is gone. He lost him. He holds his pocket watch. Sobs.
Lost.
JOE WATCHING:
112.
On the horizon, a train.
JOE WATCHING:
Cid sits in a darkened car, holding a bloody rag to his jaw.
Joe watching, seeing:
Cid's face. Bloody. Dirty. His eyes full of hate. The
train rumbles towards the dark city.
Joe watches. Sees, in his mind's eye, all of this.
And through all of this we have only heard the wind. And Joe
breathing.
Time hanging, slowed nearly to a stop. A moment of decision.
Joe turns his blunderbuss back on himself and FIRES.
Revealing that all we saw was in Joe's head, and we are still
in the moment where Old Joe is about to shoot Sara.
But this time, just as he's pulling the trigger, a distant
shot is heard.
And Old Joe DISAPPEARS.
Sara stands shell shocked just for a moment. Then she
doesn't process any of it, she just turns and yells
SARA
CID!
Cid stops just shy of the corn. Turns back to the field.
There's his mom, Sara, unharmed and smiling. The bad man is
gone. The field is empty.
113.
We don't see Joe, but far across the field Cid runs to his
mom, into her arms. Sara lifts him, holds him.
She carries him. Walking fast back towards a far distant
figure lying still on the edge of the field. Joe.
Then a faint buzz. The flasher, in her pocket. She pulls it
out. Two flashes.
She slows. Stops. Looking at him, far away. Two flashes.
CID
Where's Joe?
SARA
He had to go away, baby.
CID
He took the bad man with him?
She kisses him.
In the distance, Sara turns away and carries Cid back towards
the farmhouse.
Sara emerges from the ruined front door, crosses the porch.
Sara crosses the lawn, and walks across the field.
Joe's body. Sara goes to him, slowly. She kneels beside him.
His pocket watch in the dirt. Open. No photo inside.
Ticking away. Around and around.
She closes it.Touches his hair. The wind through the corn.
After a long while, the sun breaks through the clouds.
