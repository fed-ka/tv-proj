Jake looks VERY CAUGHT.

END OF ACT TWO24.


ACT THREE



Gil (clean shaven now, douchey new outfit) knocks on the 
  KASSIE door, then LEANS against the wall to look  cool .
(32, average) opens the door.

KASSIE
Gil?  Hey.  Whatsup?

GIL

Ooh, ouch, put on make-up much?  You 
look like you just got outta bed.

KASSIE
I did.  I worked a double shift.  
 expecting visitors.And I wasn t

GIL
Oh.  Well...good luck with that.

KASSIE
With what?

GIL
With...not expecting visitors.  
 a loser.  Ha-Cause you reha!

KASSIE
Right.  Did you just come here to 
 clothes are insult me?  And who s
those?  You look like you robbed a 
Serbian DJ.  Or a guy named DJ.

GIL
(hurt)
What?  No, these are - cool.  Kay 
told me Jake Gyllenhaal put this 
exact outfit in his will as what he 
wants to be buried in. 

KASSIE
Alright Gil, so great catching up 
with you.

She starts to CLOSE THE DOOR-- Gil STOPS it with his hand and 
immediately turns SUPER SINCERE:

GIL
I miss you!  Please Kassie, take me 
ll see.  I  changed, you back.  I ve
even went to the gym today.  
(MORE)25.

GIL (CONT'D)
Did not realize you needed a credit 
card to join though, so I had to go 
back to my car, which had been 
towed in the interim, which forced 
me to walk all the way home, which 
actually turned out to be quite a 
workout--  But whatever, how bout 
just one date?  Come with me to 
 engagement party Jake and Annie s
tonight.  Please.  I need this.

KASSIE
(long beat, then)
Okay.  Sure.  I...I missed you too, 
Gilly. 

He s SURPRISED.  She SMILES at him.  He KISSES her!  Then--  

GIL
So, not to bring up the make-up 
thing for real now, but are you 
gonna change at all?  Cause the 
Evite did say cocktail attire...

She ROLLS HER EYES and SMILES as she heads inside to change.  
Gil PUMPS HIS FIST dramatically like an athlete!



Jake (blazer, tie) eats nachos sadly at the same outdoor 
table where he and Annie first met.  A WAITRESS approaches.  

WAITRESS
You okay?

JAKE
 supposed to be at Not really.  I m
my engagement party right now, but 
 we keep getting in huge fights - I m
 technically not even sure if we re
 get why engaged.  I just...don t
 this has been so hard.  Like if it s
some kinda sign or something...?

WAITRESS
 as in  okay? Oh, no I meant  You
 get can I else anything there  Is

a waitress, not Iyanla Fix My Life.

JAKE

 good, thanks.Right.  I m

The Waitress just walks off.  Jake looks FORLORNLY at the 
BENCH WHERE HE FIRST SAW ANNIE.  It triggers a MEMORY...26.



Jake THINKS about that memory, then-- THROWS DOWN his nacho!

JAKE
Check please!  Can I get the check!?

He grabs his stuff FRANTICALLY, when-- his phone RINGS!  It s 
Annie!  He answers it!  INTERCUT BETWEEN THEM AS NECESSARY:

JAKE (CONT D)

ANNIE
Jake, before you say anything, I just 
 so so sorry.  For everything.  ...I m

the proposal...s plural.  It s just 
sorta what I do.  My dumb emotions 
 and then I explode my life.  get goin 
I m a spazz.  But I m working on all 
that.  With a team of therapists, and 
gurus, three different astrologists, 
a chiropractor, two unlicensed life-
coaches, and a self-described warrior 
poet.  I wish I was just born super 
mellow and logical like you - I love 
that you never explode - but, I mean, 
have you met my dads?  They named me 
 why I after a musical.  But that s
need you.  Desperately.  Without you, 
 just...spin off into space.  I d
(tears up)
Jake, I...could not love another 
human more.28.


JAKE
No Annie, I need you.  The truth 
is, I love your explosions.  My 
life would be so boring without 
 them.  You challenge me.  You re
like my little exploding challenger 
- heard it right when I said it.

ANNIE
Not great.

JAKE
I thought about everything, and this 
is all my fault.  I waited way too 
long to propose.  Just like I waited 
too long to say I love you, even 
though I loved you from the moment I 
saw you.  I always wait too long on 
 even the emotional stuff.  I don t
  like saying the word  emotional .
 just - uch.  I guess cause my It s
folks fought so much when I was a 
kid, I just always tried to be so 
 like I quiet and easy...and now it s
 express a single emotion ever.  can t

Wow, I think I just, like, figured my 
entire self out in this moment.  
(refocuses on Annie)
 care But whatever - Annie, I don t
about the proposals, or my crappy job 
- which I probably woulda ridden all 
the way to retirement had you not 
exploded me outta there - I only care 
about being with you.  Forever. 

ANNIE
 Me too!  Side note though, you don t
think any of these botched proposals 
 not supposed are like a sign we re
to be together or anything, do you?

JAKE
(concerned, then fronts)
 What?  No, of course not.  I don t
believe in signs.  Especially not 
negative ones.  I mean, if there 
was like, say, a positive sign that 
we were supposed to be together, I 
 discount one of those.wouldn t

ANNIE
Of course not.  But in this 
 think we particular case, I don t
should read too much into this 
negative sign, right?29.


JAKE
Fuck this sign, okay?  I said it.   

ANNIE
 Totally!  Now just stay there, I m
coming to you!

JAKE
Wait, how do you know where I am?

ANNIE
 at our engagement party, You re
right?

JAKE
 not there either?No.  Wait, you re

ANNIE
I couldn t face you.  Or all them.  
Or all them without you.  I freaked.

JAKE
Well, then where are you?

 PHONE, JAKE HEARS:THROUGH ANNIE S

WAITRESS (THROUGH PHONE)
You okay?

JAKE
Wait a second.

Jake stands up and looks THROUGH THE WINDOW: ANNIE S INSIDE!  
 both at Pinche Maricones!  She runs out to him!  They re

JAKE (CONT D)
Oh my god!  Annie!

ANNIE
This is so crazy!  
(they hug big, then)
Wait, this is it!  This is the sign 
 supposed to be together!   that we re

JAKE
Oh yeah, this is as good a sign as 
s like we  ever seen.  It I ve
 get away from each literally can t
 like Rachel McAdams other.  We re
and romantic time travel movies.

ANNIE
(laughs)
And thank god, cause that first 
sign - the one that clearly stated 
we should not be together - was 
giving me some serious pause.30.


JAKE
Oh sure, that was a devil of a sign.  
As obvious as they get.  But this 
sign trumps that one for sure.  This 
 higher up on is like the sign that s
 the pole, that says, like,  Vehicles
With Permit Number 170 Exempt .

ANNIE
(laughs)
Totally.  
(tears up)
Jake, I...just really love you.

JAKE

JAKE (CONT D)
Annie, will you marry me?  Again?  
With this ring of calamari even 
though recent studies show that 
most calamari is actually pig anus?  

ANNIE
Ew.  But, yes.  YES!

He puts the calamari ring on her finger.  They KISS BIG!  The 
restaurant CHEERS (even the bitchy Waitress)!

JAKE
 both here, then...Wait, if we re



All the Guests walk out of the building to go home, GROUSING.  
Just then, Jake and Annie SPRINT UP SO OUT OF BREATH!  32.


JAKE
 here and--Wait!  We - We re
 catch his breath, (can t
has to take a knee)
Jesus Christ.

ANNIE
Wow, babe, we gotta get you in a 
 sorry gym.  Guys, listen, we re
 late, we just...had to stop we re
to get you all a present...to say 
thanks for coming.

Annie pulls CHIPS and SALSA out of her purse (from Pinches).

JAKE
The salsa symbolizes...the spice of 
life.  And...um...

ANNIE
The corn - or maize - of the chips 
is meant to evoke the sustenance of 
friendship.
(off their BLANK STARES)
Okay, the truth is, neither of us 
were gonna come tonight cause we 
blew another proposal and got in 
another big fight--

Everyone GROANS--

JAKE
But, then we actually sorta stumbled 
into an even better proposal.  So, 
we re engaged for real now.  And it 
was perfect this time.  

ANNIE
Well, except that it took place at 
a restaurant that doesn t recognize 
the most basic civil rights of the 
LGBT community-- sorry Dad and Dad.
(beat)
 head inside for a toast!Now, let s

Jake and Annie start inside (no one else moves), when--

MYRNA
Yeah...you guys are a very strong oh-
for-two on this thing, okay?  We re 
 happy for you.  But I think it s
time we call it a week on trying to 
 celebrate your engagement.  Let s
 save up for the wedding, which I m
 sure will be a huge disaster.  Can t
wait to get my eyes on that.  
(pointedly to Annie)
If you even invite me.33.


 still MAD.  She starts to WALK AWAY, when-- Annie Myrna s
 odd.  She holds stops her with a WEIRD FORCED HUG.  It s
Myrna AWKWARDLY for a beat.  Then they separate STRANGELY.

ANNIE
 Listen, Myrna - Mrs. Schuffman - I m
 sorry.  I never had a mom, okay?  I m
the product of an egg from a lesbian 
my dads no longer speak to, and a 
sorta soft serve swirl of their

d want to be my mom if I  who I You re
could pick.  Truly.  I only insulted 
you cause the easiest way to hurt a 
guy is to go after his mother.  And 
 how I always fight: below the that s

wanted to hurt Jake.  But I never

MYRNA
(tense beat, then laughs)
Hey, I respect that strategy.  
 how I used to fight with That s
Don.  Granted, we ended up bitterly 
divorced, but I regret nothing.  

Now they HUG FOR REAL!  Jake BEAMS.  Then Gil CLEARS his 
throat (he wants an apology too).  Annie turns to him. 

ANNIE
 sorry too.  I My sweet Gil.  I m
re a garbage person. think you don t

GIL
Thank you.m   Cause I feel like I

that, I was like, am I?  And are we?

Okay, buddy.  Now, who would like 
to come in and have a drink - not 
as a celebration of our engagement 
in any way whatsoever - just as a

Everyone LAUGHS.  Then they all start to walk inside HAPPY!
