    The parking lot is lousy with TEENAGERS of myriad races. 
    MUSIC BLARES from a Chevy Suburban s GIGANTIC SUBWOOFER: 
     Pretty Girl Shake It.  The groove is BASS HEAVY and 
    HYPNOTIC.  

    The kids stand around watching a rap group, THE RANGERS, 
    quite literally  jerk  to their own music. It s a mix of 
    shaking,  jerking  and spinning, melding the old school 
     breakdance  moves of their parents with new moves you 
    haven t seen before.

    The MUSIC SHUTS OFF. SAMMY and BEN push forward to start 
    breaking up the throng. The teenagers start aggressively 
    protesting having to move.

    These are  harmless  teenagers, but as soon as Ben and Sammy 
    split, they realize just how outnumbered they are. The group 
    as a collective grows more belligerent.

    SAMMY stands off in one corner surrounded by a few TEENAGED 
    MALES. Ben sees how his partner is corralled, and moves 
    closer to maintain tactical control. 

    Before Ben can move, a FUNKY WHITE GIRL steps in his face. 
    Funky attitude, not dance moves. Ben spins her around to hook 
    her up. Her COMBATIVE BLACK FEMALE FRIEND steps between Ben 
    and Ms. Funkytown.

    Ms. Combative gives Ben a HARD SHOVE. As she SPITS in his 
    FACE, WE FREEZE and PHOTOFLASH.

                  Cops routinely find themselves 
                  underwater. The best manage to keep 
                  their heads above the surface. But 
                  even for a strong swimmer like 
                  Officer Ben Sherman, the undertow 
                  can be tricky.

    GUYS drinking out of plastic cups wear T-shirts with slogans 
    like EXPOSITION ST. UNDERTAKERS and ALVARADO DESPERADOS.

    This is a COP COMMUNITY POOL  JAM . There are HOUSES visible 
    in the background, two story, with SUVS and TRUCKS parked in 
    the driveways.

    Sammy and Ben swig cold Coronas, digging the scene. JONES 
    stands in front of a gas grill, flipping a rack of ribs. 
    MUSIC blasts from a BOSE system in the corner. 

    Sammy eyes a BLONDE who s body is filled with erotic promise. 
    Jones peeps Sammy peeping her, then focuses back on the 
    grill. Ben doesn t miss her either. Smiles.

                  Pretty much.

    MORE GIRLS jump in the pool. OTHERS sway to the music.

                  The man s still holding on to that 
                  Silver Lake shit, Sammy. You need

                  Man likes living in a shoebox, what  
                  can I tell you.

                                BEN
                  I live fifteen minutes from the 
                  division, not two hours. I don t 
                  need to live out here in Castaic 
                  Copland for personal validation.

                  Cops need the long commute to 
                  decompress. Come home to a yard. A 
                  dog. A houseboat. A life.

    Ben looks over at the pool. A bodacious wonder emerges from 
    the water wearing a red Bikini. It s KAYA. The waitress who 
    slipped Ben her number a while back.

                                BEN
                  I got better ways of decompressing.

    She walks over and kisses Ben deeply on the lips.

    Sammy watches as Ben and Kaya jump into the pool. Jones 
    shrugs.

                  See, the average brother would 
                  settle for some  Mike and Molly  
                  chick. But white boys go Beyonce 
                  all the way. Spike Lee had it 
                  right, man.

    We re CLOSE ON A hand. Clutching a BLACK CROCODILE PURSE.

    JOHN, TANG, and DEWEY stand around the hand and the bag. 
    There s not much else. Part of a BLOODY STUMP, tightly 
    clutching a bag. Tang kneels down. 

                                TANG
                  That s Porosus Crocodile. Bag s 
                  worth like 50 thousand dollars.

    John and Dewey stand back, a little in awe.

                                JOHN
                  For a purse? Come on.

                  My sister would give her left arm

                  Looks like someone did.

    TWENTY FEET AWAY

    LYDIA and RUBY have their notebooks out. They re looking down 
    at the ground at TIRE TREADS, BROKEN GLASS, and SPLOTCHES OF 
    BLOOD.

  A few CRIME TECHS rope off the area with YELLOW TAPE. Another 
    TECH walks over and PHOTOGRAPHS the HAND.

                                RUBEN
                  We don t have a body. Maybe she 
                  made it to the hospital.

    Lydia smiles. She points to the ground.

    Ruben nods. Lydia walks towards the arm and the purse. Ruben 
    follows behind. Lydia perks up when she sees John. She makes 
    eye contact with Dewey, who walks off in the other direction.

                                LYDIA (CONT D)

                  Two people coming out of that bar 
                  saw a silver SUV speeding down the 
                  block. Another said it was a 
                  Suburban. Guy over there said it 
                  was a Ford Escape. No plates.

    Lydia and Ruben look down at it.

                                LYDIA
                  Nice purse. Did you take a look?

                  We felt such a distinguished piece 
                  of apparel required a more delicate 
                  touch.

    Lydia smiles. She reaches into her pocket and puts on some 
    surgical gloves. Reaches inside the bag. Pulls out a wallet.

                                LYDIA
                  Mrs. Meredith Williams. Address is 
                  off Sunset. Bel Air probably.

    Lydia hands the wallet and the ID to Tang.

    Lydia and Ruben walk towards a HOUSE. They both stop at the 
    edge of the driveway. There s another Black and White unit 
    idling behind them as back up. 

    As soon as they reach the driveway, Lydia points down to the 
    ground.

    There are RED SPOTS intermingled with car treads in the 
    driveway. Lydia unbuttons her jacket and unsnaps her gun, but 
    keeps it in the holster. Ruben does the same. 

    Lydia s contact. Ruben is cover. The two UNI s from the 
    backup car stand in the background, just in case. Lydia 
    KNOCKS. Holds up her badge to the keyhole.

    The door opens and Lydia has to look down. A SIX YEAR OLD BOY 
    wearing SUPERMAN PJS with a CAPE opens the door.

                                BOY
                  Hello?

    Lydia bends down. Switches tactics.

                                LYDIA
                  Hi, sweetie. Is your mother home?

                                BOY

  A young mother, 30s, white, comes to the door. Her name is 
    PAMELA.

    The GARAGE DOOR rolls up. Lydia and Ruben enter. The ESCAPE 
    is parked there, but it s SMASHED on the left side. The hood 
    is heavily dented from an impact.

    Lydia looks down, and sees something underneath the DRIVER S 
    SIDE WHEEL. There are parts of a LEG and a TORSO. Mrs. 
    Williams  FACE, somehow untouched, stares right back at 
    Lydia, eyes open. Lydia jumps back.

                                                                    TIME CUT TO:            SOUTHLAND - Ep#402 - YELLOW - 11/09/11              7.



    Pamela holds an INFANT while her son, still dressed in his 
    Superman PJs, hugs her leg. They re teary-eyed as they watch 
    Lydia and Ruben lead a MAN, SCOTT DAVIS to their sedan.

    NEIGHBORS watch from their driveways as the Davis Family 
    GARAGE is roped off with crime scene tape. A SMASHED SILVER 
    FORD ESCAPE emerges as CRIME TECHS remove BODY PARTS from 
    underneath the car.

    Lydia sits Scott in the back of the car. He s still pretty 
    groggy. 

                                SCOTT
                  We were gonna lose the house. I 
                  just got a job. So I drank with a 
                  few of my buddies. 

    Ruben looks at Scott, and turns his head to look at the 
    family.

                                SCOTT (CONT D)
                  I thought I hit a coyote.

                  You ripped a woman in half, Mr 
                  Davis. 

    Scott starts crying. She shuts the door and looks at Ruben.

                                LYDIA (CONT D)
                  We should congratulate him on his 
                  new job. Making license plates.

                                RUBEN
                  That s harsh.

    Lydia points to the Escape.

                  They re gonna be scrapping chunks 
                  of Ms. Williams out from under that 
                  car for hours. We should make him 
                  help.

                  Because I have a card.

                                JOHN
                  No, sir, it s about your wife.

                                MR WILLIAMS
                  She s with her boyfriend. She won t 
                  be back until tonight.

    John and Tang look at each other.

                                JOHN
                  There was an accident, sir. We re 
                  still investigating the 
                    circumstances. We believe your wife 
                  was hit by a car and killed.

    The information washes over Mr. Williams  face like water. He 
    starts CRYING. 

                                JOHN (CONT D)
                  Would you like to sit down?

    The staff finally drops the pretext that they haven t been 
    listening the whole time. Mr. Williams looks up.

                                MR WILLIAMS
                  She s dead. She s dead!

    John and Tang look surprised. The reaction isn t grief. It s  
    joy. They start hugging each other.

                  La bruja esta muerta!

    Officer Tang looks up and around. John looks at her.

                                JOHN
                  What are you looking for?

                  Maybe they found the ruby slippers 
                  with the rest of her body.

    FADE IN:


    Sammy and Ben stand across from CRYSTAL, a 19 year old girl. 
    She s wearing glass heels and a short, tight fitting blue 
    dress, and carrying a small purse. She s ready to party.

                                SAMMY
                  Stand against the wall, Cheryl. 

                                CRYSTAL
                  I m Crystal now. 

    She does as she s told. Sammy walks over to the car and Ben 
    follows. They re just out of earshot.

                                BEN
                  She s got a pipe stashed somewhere. 
                  Easy felony  frank . Served with 
                  mustard and relish.

                                SAMMY
                  One good hooker is worth ten CIs. I 
                  say we flip her.

                                BEN
                  She s still a kid. Little jail 
                  time, and maybe she goes straight.

                                SAMMY
                  Let someone else play Captain Save-
                  a-Hoe. The pipe gives us leverage. 
                  I say we use it. 

    They walk back over to Crystal. Ben moves closer.

                                SAMMY (CONT D)
                  Gimme your purse.

    She reluctantly gives Ben the purse. He rummages through it 
    and finds fifty dollars, a lighter, and a PIPE. Ben holds it 
    up. He hands it to Sammy. Sammy holds it up. Marvels for a 
    minute.

                                SAMMY (CONT D)
                  Gimme one good reason why I 
                  shouldn t take you to jail?

    The tears begin to stream down her face.

                                CRYSTAL
                  Cause Ronnie will beat my ass.

                  You don t think I don t see him 
                  parked over there? You going to 
                  jail fucks with his money. Start 
                  talking.

    She looks around. Nervous, like a rabbit. Finally, quietly..

                                CRYSTAL
                  Day Day got a stash house.

    Sammy and Ben look at each other.

                                SAMMY
                  Two Trey Day Day Crawford?

                                CRYSTAL
                  Yeah. Over by his spot on Denker.

                                                                          CUT TO:

    I./E. JOHN & TANG S PATROL CAR (MOVING)/STREET - DAY1212

    Tang drives. John looks out the window. Fidgets. You can tell 
    he s not used to sitting in the passenger seat.

                                JOHN
                  How long have you been a cop?

    Tang doesn t answer.

                                JOHN (CONT D)
                  Married? Kids?

    Tang looks forward, down the road.

                                JOHN (CONT D)
                  Divorced?

                                TANG
                  Your feigned interest in my 
                  personal life will have no bearing 
                  on how I evaluate your street 
                  readiness.

    John smirks.

                                JOHN
                  That has to be the nicest way 
                  anyone has ever told me to shut up.
                        (beat)
                  So, never married?

                                TANG
                  Okay, then. Shut up.

    Tang smiles. Then she frowns when she sees a NAKED MAN about 
    10 feet in the distance.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)          SOUTHLAND - Ep#402 - YELLOW - 11/09/11              13.

                                JOHN
                  Full moon in broad daylight.

    They pull up along side the NAKED MAN. John rolls his window 
    down.

                                TANG
                  Sir?

                                NAKED MAN
                  Hey.

    The man keeps running. SWEATING. Like it s normal.

                                JOHN
                  How s it hanging, brother?

                  Rough morning. I m a little 
                  underwater.

                  You know you forgot your clothes, 
                  right?

                                NAKED MAN
                  Just needed a run.

    Tang thinks about it. Looks ahead.

                                TANG
                  You can t run on city streets, sir. 
                  But take the on-ramp. Freeways are 
                  okay.

                                NAKED MAN
                  Great. Thanks.

    The man speeds up, and runs up the ramp.

                                TANG
                  Call CHP. He s their problem now. 
                  You hungry?

    Ben, Sammy, Jones, and Anawalt are parked parallel. Facing 
    downhill. Trees protect them from being seen. They re looking 
    DOWNHILL at some GUYS on the corner. One of the GUYS has on a 
    RAIDERS NUMBER 2 JERSEY. The other has a TORRI HUNTER JERSEY. 
    The other guys have on white T-s and Khakis.

                                SAMMY
                  I like Torii Hunter.

                                JONES
                  My man JaMarcus will smoke his ass.

                                SAMMY
                  That jersey is cursed. No way.

    Sammy puts a 20 dollar bill on top of the hood.

                                JONES
                  How can you sit so comfortably with 
                  balls that big? I got your 20, 
                  swinging.

    Jones reaches into his wallet and pulls out a 20.

                                JONES (CONT D)
                  Ben, you in?

    Ben smirks. Shakes his head.

                                BEN
                  I m out.

                  Shouldn t we be focused on what 
                  we re about to do?

    Anawalt frowns. Ben looks at her.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          SOUTHLAND - Ep#402 - YELLOW - 11/09/11              16.

                  kick ass.

    SIX KIDS, late teens, standing in a circle near the corner. 
    Dollars are piled up on the ground. It s a CRAPS game. Torii 
    Hunter is just about to roll the dice when we hear a YOUNG 
    VOICE yell

                                YOUNG MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                  FIVE OH! FIVE OH! FIVE OH!

    Hunter grabs the DICE and JaMarcus grabs the POT. They 
    scatter as

    TWO POLICE CARS zoom up. Sammy and Ben emerge from one car 
    and JONES and ANAWALT from the other.

    Hunter and BLACK RAIDERS JERSEY run down the block at TOP 
    SPEED. 

    Sammy, and Ben and Jones and Anawalt quickly subdue the six 
    youngsters, guns out. The kids know the routine and hit the 
    pavement, facedown, hands visible. But RAIDERS JERSEY and 
    Hunter run down the block.

    Jones looks up to watch them go. The man with the JaMarcus 
    jersey runs even faster.

                                JONES
                  JaMarcus is coming for that ass!

    JaMarcus gets close and is just about to overtake Hunter, but 
    he wins by a nose. 

    Jones slams his fist on the hood of his car. Sammy does a 
    victory dance.

                                SAMMY
                  Just win, baby!

    Sammy and Jones stand near the car. Ben and Anawalt have the 
    teens on the knees, hands behind their heads. Ben and Anawalt 
    have their guys cuffed.

                  We re gonna need a bigger boat.

    Sammy looks at the kids.

                                SAMMY
                  Where the hell you learn to count? 
                  You got five.

    Ben looks down.

                                BEN
                  I hooked up three of them. Anawalt?

    Anawalt looks around, frantic.

                                JONES
                  The last guy you had. When you 
                  arrested him. Are you sure you 
                  heard the handcuffs click?

    Anawalt stands up. Stunned. Sammy and Jones look at each 
    other. They re more annoyed than frantic.

    They look across the street at the PROJECTS.

                                SAMMY
                  We know where he ran. Let s smoke 
                  him out.

    Ben looks at Anawalt.

                                BEN
                  Remember, for your next job, the 
                  regular McNugget meal comes with 
                  six nuggets. Not four. Plus fries 
                  and a drink.

    Ben, Sammy, Jones, and Anawalt walk quickly through the 
    courtyard. Anawalt looks crushed. She knows she messed up. 
    The courtyard is one big block. People look out of their 
    windows and pull up their chairs to watch the police moving 
    through their space, like it s some 4-D program.

    OLDER WOMEN hang up their laundry. Some KIDS run after each 
    other, playing, so commonplace is it that the cops have their 
    guns out, looking for somebody.

    OLDER TEENS, with hard eyes, eye-fuck our cops and spit on 
    the ground. Sammy walks closer to Ben.

                                SAMMY
                  Why you being so hard on Anawalt? 
                  You never lost a suspect before?

    Ben smirks.

                                BEN
                  I plead the fifth.

    Ben moves closer to Anawalt.

    Sammy and Ben stand on one side, Anawalt and Jones on 
    another. 

  A TEN YEAR OLD KID struts around, wearing a single spotless 
    Size 12 KOBE sneaker. Jones walks up to him.

                                JONES

    Jones passes the shoe to Ben, who looks at it.

                  Is this like ghetto Cinderella? 
                  Anawalt matches the other shoe and 
                  finds her Prince?

                                ANAWALT
                  Kiss my ass, Sherman.

                                JONES
                  No way someone leaves behind a 
                  brand new customized tennis shoe 
                  unless they were on the run. See 
                  the initials on the back?

    Sammy looks at it. Sees AR on the side.

                                SAMMY
                  What s that for. Asshole Running?

                  Anawalt s Regret.

    Sammy bends down and looks at the Cocky Ten Year Old.

                                SAMMY
                  You see the kid who was wearing the 
                  other sneaker?

                  What if I gave you a Happy Meal and 
                  let you play with the siren in our 
                  patrol car?

    Kid thinks about it. Points at a building.

                                COCKY TEN YEAR OLD
                  Second floor. 

                                                                          CUT TO:


    There s a HARD KNOCK on the door. A heavy set BLACK WOMAN in 
    her LATE 30s opens the door and JONES enters, followed by 
    Sammy, Ben, and Anawalt. 

                                JONES
                  I apologize, ma am. Does this shoe 
                  belong to someone you know?

    They enter and see that the place, for a project apartment, 
    looks immaculate. Mirrors, family pictures, a Rent-A-Center 
    couch with the plastic still on it, and respectable 46 inch 
    flat screen TV.

  A GRANDMOTHER, and TWO YOUNG KIDS sit next to a TEENAGER, 
    watching ESPN. They look up at Ben with a nervous expression.

    Ben moves towards the kitchen. Right before he reaches it, he 
    sees a SOCK coming out from under a semi open CLOSET DOOR. He 
    looks across the room at a mirror just before a 

    BASEBALL BAT

    Swings at his head. Ben ducks just in time.

    Ben gets off the floor and charges at the FUGITIVE KID, who s 
    running with one sneaker. He BUMPS the kid against the wall, 
    and the kid drops the bat.

    The kid moves into THE KITCHEN. His left hand is the only one 
    that s cuffed.

    Ben pulls at the kid s shirt and misses. The kid runs to the 
    stove, grabs a skillet and throws it at Ben. It glances off 
    Ben s forearm and hits him with a little grease. 

    Ben comes after the kid as the kid grabs a KITCHEN KNIFE. 

                                BEN
                  Drop it! Drop it!

    But Ben SLAMS into him and the kid drops the knife. Sammy and 
    Jones and Anawalt are behind Ben now. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          SOUTHLAND - Ep#402 - YELLOW - 11/09/11              22.

                  You could have killed me asshole. 
                  Damn baseball bat?

    Ben bends the kid s arms back. Sammy stands the kid up, 
    backing Ben off. Anawalt walks over to Sammy. She finishes 
    handcuffing the kid.

    Ben looks down at his forearm. It s bruised. Ben walks over 
    to RENEE, the woman who opened the door.

                                BEN (CONT D)
                  He your son?

                                RENEE

                  Don t know him.

    Ben walks over.

                                BEN
                  So you don t know this guy, but you 
                  let him hide in a closet?

    Ben is pissed.

                                RENEE
                  He more my people than you. 

    Ben is livid. Jones pushes him back.

                                SAMMY
                  Come on, Ben. Let s go.

                                BEN
                  Wait and see if we ever respond to 
                  a call over here again.

                                RENEE
                  Ain t nobody asked for you to come 
                  here? Get the hell out of my house!

    She looks at the kid.

                                RENEE (CONT D)
                  You got somebody you want me to 
                  call?

                                KID
                  No ma am. Thank you.

    Ben looks at the kid with disbelief. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          SOUTHLAND - Ep#402 - YELLOW - 11/09/11              23.

                  Oh, now you re polite? Let s go.

    Jones puts the kids shoe on the ground, steps him into it, 
    and the four leave the apartment with their handcuffed 
    suspect.

    The ten year old rolls up to Sammy. Sammy discretely slips 
    him a five. 

                                COCKY TEN YEAR OLD
                        (whispering)

                                SAMMY
                  Can t right now. I m sorry.

    The kid spits on the ground. Pissed. Stares holes into Sammy.

                                                                          CUT TO:


    Tang s driving. John fidgets. They re Code 3. LIGHTS and 
    SIRENS. He looks out at Hollywood Boulevard. He can t hold 
    his tongue.

                                JOHN
                  Are you going to ever let me drive?

    Tang shakes her head.

                                TANG
                  No.

                                JOHN
                  What about after the evaluation?

    Tang shakes her head again. John leans back in his chair. 
    Tang looks at him.

                                TANG
                  How did you hurt your back?

    Tang SLAMS on the breaks. They stop near the corner of 
    Cauhenga and Hollywood near an ADULT BOOK STORE. 

  A MAN has run out of the bookstore,looking like the HUMAN 
    TORCH from FANTASTIC FOUR. He flames down the block.

    ANOTHER MAN runs out of the porno shop after him with a FIRE 
    EXTINGUISHER putting him out. As Tang and John leap out.

                                                                          CUT TO:


    Lydia and Ruby walk down a tree lined street. Kids ride 
    bikes, and an OLDER MAN stands outside, washing his car. 
    Every other car in the driveway is a Lexus or a Mercedes.

                                RUBEN
                  I love Baldwin Hills.

                                LYDIA
                  Just because it s South L.A. 
                  doesn t mean it has to be run down.

    At the end of the block, they see a TALL MAN in a dirty t-
    shirt and jeans mowing the lawn. As soon as he sees them, he 
    cuts the mower and walks over. He has a slight limp. More 
    like a strut.

                                DARRELL
                  May I help you, Detectives?

    He looks at the bulge underneath Lydia s shoulder.

                                DARRELL (CONT D)
                  Realtors don t carry.

                                DARRELL
                  Yes.

    Ruben pulls out a picture of MACK LOGAN.

                                RUBEN
                  Do you know this man?

                                DARRELL
                  Mack Logan? Yeah. He lied on me, 
                  and robbed me of two decades of 
                  sunshine. What did he do now?

                                RUBEN
                  Someone shot him dead at point 
                  blank range, not even 10 minutes 
                  from here.

    Lydia scans his face. Looking for any glimmer of emotion.

                  Helping my grandmother with her 
                  pill regimen. She s 93. I take care

                                RUBEN
                  And she ll vouch for you?

                                DARRELL
                  I hated that fool. That s no 
                  secret. Mack said I confessed at 
                  County to raping some white woman I 
                  never even met, just so he could go 
                  home three years early. My mama 
                  died thinking I was a rapist. 
                  Without that DNA stuff, I d still 
                  be doing time because of him. 

    The door opens and GRANNY comes outside. She s bright eyed 
    but frail.

                                GRANNY
                  Darrell, why don t you offer your

                  It s okay Granny, they were just 
                  leaving. 

    Darrell ushers his grandmother back in the house and closes 
    the door. Ruben hands him a business card.

    Lydia and Ruby walk back to the car.

                                RUBEN
                  I dunno. You notice the limp? Like

    Ruben nods.

                  You think Granny might change her

    I./E. DETECTIVE CAR/BALDWIN HILLS HOUSE - STREET - DAY2424

    Lydia and Ruben hang back in the car. They watch Darrell walk 
    down the street. They linger.

                                LYDIA
                  Let him get down the block.

    Darrell bends the corner and they get out of the car. They 
    walk down the street towards 

    DARRELL S HOUSE.

                                RUBEN
                  What do we say to the old lady?

                                LYDIA
                  We just introduce ourselves.

    They KNOCK on the door. Takes a minute. It opens.

                                LYDIA (CONT D)
                  Mrs. Miller. Sorry to bother you

                  Brenda! How you doing, girl?

    She gives Lydia a kiss on the cheek. Lydia looks at Ruben. 
    Shrugs.


    Sammy and Ben walk down a street filled with older, some 
    dilapidated, houses. At the end of the block, there s a 
    PHALANX of police cars. Some P2s, many of them the same 
    officers we saw from roll call, are parked in front of

  A HOUSE

    With a huge CROSS in the front and a neon sign that says, 
    JESUS IS LORD. Sammy and Ben walk over to PAOLO, a female P2  *
    who s talking with KARLA EVANS, a black woman in her 30s. Ben 
    reaches Paolo first.*

                                BEN
                  What s going on Paolo?*

                  like it s a litter box. My four 
                  year old doesn t know any better, 
                  and constantly comes home covered 
                  in cat shit.

                  Have you logged a complaint, ma am.

                                KARLA
                  Yes. Numerous times. But it keeps 
                  happening. Like today. So I went to 
                  tell her about herself. And she 
                  shot at me.

                                SAMMY
                  What?

                                KARLA
                  I heard a gunshot.

                                BEN
                  You saw a gun.

                                KARLA
                  No. I heard a gunshot. That old 
                  bitch fired at me. That s why I 
                  called y all.

    Ben and Sammy and Paolo stand off to the side. Sammy looks at  *
    Paolo.*

                                SAMMY
                  You go in?

                                PAOLO*
                  Naw. We got here three minutes 
                  before you did. 

    Sammy and Ben look at each other.

                                BEN
                  Just some old lady.

    Ben and Sammy walk up the steps to the

    FRONT DOOR.

    Ben KNOCKS. The door opens slightly and then there are

    GUNSHOTS. A whole FUSILLADE OF GUNSHOTS. 

    The PICTURE WINDOW in the LIVING ROOM SHATTERS and BEN and 
    SAMMY leap off the porch, running towards the

    SQUAD CARS

                  right before she fired.

    Paolo shakes her head.*

                  That request has to come directly 
                  from Captain Rucker.

    Sammy starts laughing. Ben looks concerned.

                  What s so funny?

      (STOPPED/MOVING) - DAY

    Lydia and Ruben walk towards their car. Lydia is carrying a 
    pair of TENNIS SHOES, some JEANS and a SWEATSHIRT in a 
    PLASTIC BAG. The SHOES have a few DROPS of BLOOD. They open 
    the doors and sit down.

                                RUBEN
                  No mask. No weapon.

                                LYDIA
                  If blood on the sneakers matches 
                  Logan, or the clothes test positive 
                  for gunshot residue, we have enough 
                  PC for an arrest.

    She looks at him.

                  If Darrell killed Mack Logan, 
                  didn t Logan have it coming? Who 
                  knows what Darrell went through in 
                  prison.

                                LYDIA
                  That s not Darrell s choice to 
                  make.

    Lydia starts the car. They roll forward. Right as they pull 
    out, Darrell Miller walks up with a bag of groceries. They 
    don t make eye contact with him. They rolled out just in 
    time.

                                                                          CUT TO:


    Sammy and Jones stand across from Captain Rucker behind the 
    wall of cars. There s an AUDIENCE of PEOPLE now being held 
    back by yellow tape. Sammy stands close with the Captain. 
    Rucker s wearing a stylish black suit. His tie loose.

                                RUCKER
                  You pulled me out of the City 
                  Council banquet for this?

                                SAMMY
                  She s not coming out, and she s 
                  fired at everyone who s approached 
                  the front. We need SWAT, sir.

                                RUCKER
                  I got your SWAT right here. I m not 
                  calling Metro for some little old 
                  lady.

    They both look at the porch. The JESUS IS LORD neon sign is 
    still flashing.

                                RUCKER (CONT D)
                  Anawalt. 

    Anawalt walks over. She s nervous.

                                ANAWALT
                  Pastors. She doesn t realize that 
                  she s talking to me every time she 
                  calls. She also wants food for her 
                  cat.

    Rucker thinks. Nods.

                                RUCKER
                  Sherman. Follow me.

    Ben walks with Captain Rucker to his sedan. Rucker reaches 
    into his pocket and pulls out his KEYS, popping the trunk. He 
    turns to Ben. 

                                RUCKER (CONT D)
                  Hand me the bag.

    Ben reaches in the trunk and pulls out a THICK BRIEFCASE 
    (similar to the one John Wells occasionally carries). Ben 
    watches carefully as Rucker kneels snaps the buckles.

    What s he gonna pull out? A bazooka? A grenade launcher?

    Rucker reaches inside and pulls out a thick, leather-bound 
    KING JAMES BIBLE. He looks up at Ben.

                                RUCKER (CONT D)
                  It s time to go to my playbook.

    FADE IN:


    Captain Rucker slowly walks towards the house. Ben pauses 
    next to Sammy before stepping forward.

                                BEN
                  He s a deacon at Park s Chapel.

                                SAMMY
                  God protects children and fools. 
                  You re crazy to go up there.

                                BEN
                  Captain s orders.

                                SAMMY
                  I don t think all this Holy Rollin  
                  is gonna work. Old bat fires at any 
                  thing that moves.

    Ben follows behind Rucker. Rucker has his Bible open. His 
    voice booms so loud, he doesn t need a loudspeaker.

                                RUCKER
                  Blessed is SHE who s transgression 
                  is forgiven, whose sin is covered. 
                  Blessed is the woman to whom the 
                  Lord does not impute iniquity and 
                  in who s spirit there is no 
                  deceit. 

    Rucker walks slowly, and the cops and  Lookie-loos  wait with 
    baited breath. We hear the sound of a gun CLICK CLACKING.

                                OLD WOMAN (O.S.)
                  You come any closer, I ll shoot.

    Ben looks at his feet. There s a TABBY rubbing up against his 
    leg. Ben picks it up.

                                RUCKER
                  What are you doing, Sherman?

                                BEN
                  We have your cat! If you don t come 
                  out here in the next 20 seconds, 
                  we ll take her to the pound. You ll 
                  never see her again.

    Long pause. The front door of the house cracks opens.

                                                                          CUT TO:          SOUTHLAND - Ep#402 - YELLOW - 11/09/11              36.



    Lydia and Ruben walk swiftly. They re headed back to Darrell 
    Miller s house.

    They re flanked from behind by TWO OFFICERS.

                                RUBEN
                  Can t believe the blood on the 
                  shoes matched.

                                LYDIA
                  Guilt never surprises me. Only 
                  innocence does. 

    Lydia turns to the officers.

                                LYDIA (CONT D)
                  Take the back. We have the front.

    They re about ten feet from the house when Darrell Miller 
    walks out of the house. He s showered with a fresh T-shirt. 
    Same jeans.

    Right as he steps off the porch he sees Lydia and Ruben 
    walking up. Darrell freezes. Ruben and Darrell lock eyes.

    Darrell RUNS. Just takes off down the street. Ruben takes off 
    after him.

    For an old man, Darrell moves like Jim Brown. He jumps over a 
    BUSH and JUKES LEFT and RIGHT.

    Ruben s in hot pursuit, pumping his legs, moving fast. In his 
    mind, Ruby is Cary Grant in  North By Northwest .

    Darrell runs towards a house at the other end of the cul-de-
    sac. Ruben follows.
                                                                          CUT TO:

    I./E. BALDWIN HILLS NEIGHBOR S HOUSE/PATIO/POOL - DAY3232

    The door kicks in. 

    Panting, RUBEN steps through a well appointed living room. 
    Gun out.

    Darrell picks up a fireplace poker and swings it, clearing 
    space. Darrell rears it back and CRACKS a framed Kandinsky 
    print near the fireplace.

    Darrell slowly retreats backwards through the living room, 
    passing through FRENCH DOUBLE DOORS onto a CEMENT PATIO. 
    Darrell pauses. Ruben raises his gun. He could end Darrell s 
    life with a sneeze.

                                RUBEN
                  I coulda shot you already.

                  Then what chu waitin  for? 

    Darrell s about to say something else slick when

    LYDIA

    channels her inner Troy Polamalu and TACKLES Darrell from his 
    blind side, pushing him sideways. Darrell grabs her arm as 
    they topple into a

    SWIMMING POOL

    Lydia reaches for Darrell. Darrell flails and splashes with 
    panic. Lydia pulls him over to the side. Ruby grabs the big 
    man under his armpits and HOISTS him onto the side of the 
    pool.
                                                                          CUT TO:


    Ben still has the cat. The door opens and an

    OLD WOMAN

    Steps out. She s wearing an old tattered housecoat.

                  Don t hurt her.

                                BEN
                  Drop your gun, and I ll bring her 
                  to you. What s her name?

                                OLD WOMAN
                  Spooky.

    She drops her long barrelled rifle. Ben walks towards her. As 
    she steps out onto the porch, she reaches downwards, and out 
    of the folds of her comes a small PISTOL. Ben sees it, but it 
    happens so quickly he doesn t have time to react.

                                RUCKER
                  Gun!

    Rucker steps forward. He levels his green banded shotgun and 
    BLOWS THE OLD WOMAN OFF HER FEET. There s a collective GASP 
    from police and Lookie-loos alike. It s a beanbag gun.

    Ben feels his chest. Damn, another close call. He moves 
    quickly with Sammy and Jones to RUSH THE PORCH. Sammy opens 
    her housecoat.

                                JONES
                  Kevlar! Damn! 

                                SAMMY
                  That bit with the cat was smart.

3434I./E. JOHN & TANG S PATROL CAR - (MOVING/STOPPED) - STREET 
    DAY

    Tang drives. John rides shotgun. But for the first time he 
    seems relaxed. Not as tense.

                                JOHN
                  Call said he was around here 
                  somewhere.

                                TANG
                  At 6 6, he d be hard to miss.
                        (beat)
                  I hate your friend.

                                JOHN
                  Dewey s an acquired taste.

                                TANG
                  He s a dick.

                                JOHN
                  He s also a hell of a cop. Or at 
                  least he used to be.

                                TANG
                  You know what people have been 
                  calling us? The Walking Dead.

                                JOHN
                  You think that s funny?

                                TANG
                  I stopped caring what people think 
                  since I told my parents I was going 
                  to be a cop.

    John looks at Tang. She looks back. For the first time, 
    they re beginning to really trust each other.

                                JOHN
                  When did you first know you wanted 
                  to be a cop?

    She s about to answer when she has to suddenly SCREECH TO A 
    HALT. A BALD WHITE MAN walks right in front of the car. He s 
    huge. A mass of muscle. He looks like a WWE Fighter, but 
    homeless.

    Tang opens her door and stomps out of the car. Hot.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)          SOUTHLAND - Ep#402 - YELLOW - 11/09/11              39.

    CONTINUED:3434

    John opens his door and steps out of the car. The big guy 
    stands there. His hands are shaking.

                                BIG GUY
                  I ain t going back to jail.

    The big guys lets out a blood-curdling yell, and CHARGES JOHN 
    like a bull. 

    John sidesteps him and slaps the side of his head. 

    The man grabs John around the waist and they go AT IT. 
    Rolling around on the ground. PUNCHING. KICKING. The guy s a 
    beast. But John holds his own. 

    Tang grabs her baton and, without hesitation, joins the 
    donnybrook. She s efficient, hardcore, and plain nasty. Her 
    movements are economical and swift. She aims for the shins, 
    and the elbows. Some Krav Maga, with a bit of Compton thrown 
    in for good measure.

    All it does is piss this guy off. He pushes John five feet 
    back with one swipe. He catches Tang s baton and takes it out 
    of her hand.

    Even as both of our heroes are beating the snot out of this 
    guy, they don t appear to be winning. 
                                                                          CUT TO:


    John and Tang show the signs of battle. John s shirt is 
    RIPPED. Tang s mouth has a little BLOOD. But they re both 
    going at it.

    The big guy hasn t slowed down either. And despite the fact 
    that his face looks like hamburger, he still has enough 
    strength to shake them off.

    He pushes Tang to the ground and starts going for her gun 
    belt. John pulls at his arm with all of his strength, but its 
    for naught.

    He stands straight up, and is about to unholster Tang s gun 
    when

    TWO DARTS LAND IN THE CENTER OF HIS BACK.

    REVEAL: DEWEY holding a taser.

    The jolts pulse through the guy, but he doesn t feel it. He 
    turns around and faces Dewey. 

                                BIG GUY
                  Is that all you got?

    Dewey, crazy as the Big Guy is, charges right at him. Our 
    three cops finally subdue him. The Big Guy rolls around, but 
    he no longer has the leverage. John pulls his wrists together 
    and handcuffs him. The three of them rest on the pavement. 
    Tired. But victorious.
                                                                          CUT TO:


    The parking lot is lousy with TEENAGERS. Some of them are 
    wearing SCHOOL UNIFORMS, but have their ties loose if they re 
    BOYS. The GIRLS have their shirts unbuttoned and skirts hiked 
    up a bit like Britney Spears used to do eons ago when she was 
    cool.

    Other kids have on SKINNY JEANS, and BALL CAPS. Most of the 
    kids are BLACK but there are plenty of WHITE and ASIAN KIDS 
    mixed in. 

    MUSIC BLARES from a GIGANTIC SUBWOOFER. It s the song  Pretty 
    Girl Shake It.  The groove is BASS HEAVY and HYPNOTIC. The 
    DUDES are moving their heads and the girls follow 
    instructions.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          SOUTHLAND - Ep#402 - YELLOW - 11/09/11              41.

    CONTINUED:3737

    But surprisingly, not that many people are paying attention 
    to the girls. Everyone s focused on THE RANGERS, the actual 
    teenage rap group who made this song.

    The group is actually here right now. They re the handsome 
    haughty kids dancing in a cipher.

    The group became a YouTube sensation with their homemade 
    FLASH MOB style spontaneous dance videos, and that s what 
    they re doing right now. Shaking,  jerking  and spinning, a  
    mix of the old school  breakdance  moves of their parents and 
    some new things you haven t seen before.

    While all this is going on, Ben and Sammy emerge from a 
    police car. THIS IS THE MOMENT WE OPENED THE EPISODE WITH.

    Sammy and Ben stand there for a minute. They re actually 
    enjoying watching the dancing and the kids.

                                SAMMY
                  Shame to break this up. I feel like 
                  the father in  Footloose .

                                BEN
                  How old are you, dude?

    Ben walks over to the Suburban. No one is sitting in the car, 
    so he reaches in and cuts the ignition on the car. The music 
    goes KAPUT. 

    Groans from the crowd. Sammy and Ben go right to the center 
    of the crowd.

                                SAMMY
                  Sorry. You guys have to go. You 
                  don t have permits.

                                TEENAGE MALE 2 (O.S.)
                  Fuck your permits!

    Sammy and Ben split up. The group suddenly becomes self aware 
    and stops following instructions. Ben and Sammy are both 
    outnumbered five to one.

    SAMMY is off in the corner, surrounded by a few males. 
    Sammy s not cowed in the least.

                                  AGGRESSIVE TEEN
                  Dude, we was just dancing.

                                SAMMY
                  Dance your ass back home. 

    Ben sees that Sammy is corralled, and tries to move closer, 
    to maintain tactical Advantage. But PEOPLE get in the way.

    Ben sees how ONE TEENAGE MALE pulls at Sammy s uniform.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          SOUTHLAND - Ep#402 - YELLOW - 11/09/11              42.

    Before Ben can intervene, A FUNKY WHITE GIRL steps in Ben s 
    face. Funky attitude, not moves.

                                FUNKY
                  You gonna make us go away? We ain t 
                  doing nothing.

    Ben tries to keep Sammy in his line of sight. But it s 
    getting harder.

                                BEN
                  Out of my face, or I ll arrest you.

                                FUNKY
                  For what? Breathing air?

    Ben s had enough. He spins her around and moves to hook her 
    up. Her COMBATIVE BLACK FEMALE FRIEND steps between Ben and 
    Ms. Funkytown. Funkytown does the Funky Chicken and wriggles 
    away.

                                COMBATIVE
                  Step off, white boy.

    Her combative friend pushes Ben in the chest. Ben is taken 
    aback. He s still trying to get to Sammy. She pushes Ben 
    HARD. So much so that he loses balance. He s also losing 
    Sammy, who s getting pulled at from all directions.

    Just as Ben regains his balance, she SPITS IN HIS FACE.

    Ben doesn t even think. He just reacts. With one fluid move 
    PUNCHES the combative Black Girl, closed fist, RIGHT IN THE 
    FACE.

    She WAILS like a BANSHEE. All of a sudden she s a teenage 
    girl channeling her inner teenager.

    The crowd BACKS AWAY from BEN.

    Ben is at once horrified by what he did, but justified. He 
    can see Sammy now. The crowd talks shit, but they give him 
    space. 

    Ben is suddenly hyper-aware of the RED LIGHTS focused on him. 
    Kids hold CELLPHONES aloft. Capturing every move. Suddenly 
    it s like the world is closing in on him.

    Sammy walks over. Glares at Ben. Pissed.

    Ben hooks up the Funky White girl and leads her to the car. 
    He walks over to her Combative friend.

    Like the chastened child that she is, she follows Ben. They 
    all get in the car. And just like that, the parking lot is 
    empty, like the whole thing never happened.
                                                                        FADE OUT.

    FADE IN:


    John has his leather jacket on. He s waiting. Dewey comes 
    out:

                                DEWEY
                  Damn, Johnny, that put the DON in 
                  Donnybrook, didn t it? You looked 
                  good out there.

                                JOHN
                   Walking Dead  my ass.

    Dewey laughs.

                                DEWEY
                  You hear about your boot? My friend 
                  at Alvarado says he clocked a 15 
                  year old black girl at a high 
                  school dance.

    John shakes his head.

                                JOHN
                  Still stepping on his meat.

    Tang walks out. She s pretty glam, except for her black eye. 
    John shakes her hand.

                                JOHN (CONT D)
                  You got a new nickname.

    John picks up his bag.

                                JOHN (CONT D)
                  Can t say the same about my

    Sammy puts a hand on Ben s shoulder.

                  See you tomorrow. Long drive home.

    Ben walks to his car. Fumbles with his keys He feels a hand 
    on his shoulder. He looks up and it s ANAWALT. 

                                ANAWALT
                  Nice work out there.

    She hands him a sheet of paper. It s a MCDONALD S 
    APPLICATION.

                                ANAWALT (CONT D)
                  You dropped this.

    She walks away. Ben opens his car door. He crumbles up the 
    application and throws it inside. He picks up his bag and 
    throws it in the passenger seat.

    Ben sits down in the driver s seat. Just sits there, with the 
    door open. Stares into space. 

                                                                        FADE OUT.
