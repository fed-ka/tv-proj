      WATER DRIPS into a small PUDDLE under a chair - dripping off 
      TOM.  Preoccupied with prodding his sore knee, he doesn t 
      notice.  MADDY sits across the table from him.

                                  MADDY
                    Haven t you got a big game Friday?

                                  TOM
                    Yeah, it s the county cup final and 
                    we re playing Baron s Mill High 
                    School.  The team we always lose 
                    to.

      Weaving through the few other CUSTOMERS, RHYDIAN and SHANNON 
      arrive with a tray.  Hot chocolate all round.

                    then.

      MADDY is setting the table for dinner.  EMMA is carrying

      stirring something on the stove.

                    Maybe she s nervous - you know,

                    Maddy needs to know what they think 
                    of us.  To them, we re weaklings, 
                      traitors to our heritage.  Pets.

                                  MADDY
                    You re making out she s our enemy.

                                  EMMA
                    We re just saying: if she

      Sitting down to dinner, MADDY nods.  Sounds scary.

      just being here together is a huge step for both of them.

      MADDY gets up, laying a hand briefly on RHYDIAN s shoulder - 
      she s here for him - 

      Then she takes her milkshaketo the counter, sits down there.  
      BERNIE stops polishing the coffee machine to frown at CERI.

                                  MADDY
                    He s, urm, interviewing her.  For 
                    the school magazine.

                                  BERNIE
                    Is she buying anything?

      MADDY sighs and fishes coins out of her pocket.

                                  MADDY
                    She ll have a coffee.

      BERNIE starts making it.  MADDY cocks her head - engaging her 
      Wolfblood hearing to eavesdrop on RHYDIAN s reunion.

      ANGLE ON RHYDIAN AND CERI -

      Where you could cut the atmosphere with a knife.  RHYDIAN 
      doesn t know what to say.  And CERI s having problems just 
      being here.  Can t get comfortable on the chair, for a start:

                                  CERI
                    Don t know how you can sit on this.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    It s just a chair.

                                  CERI
                    It s not natural.  Not for us.

                                    RHYDIAN*
                    What are you doing here?  You re on 
                    Maddy s territory -

                                  CERI
                            (contempt)
                    And what will the tame wolves do 
                    about it?

      BERNIE arrives with the coffee.  About to say something, he 
      senses the atmosphere and just leaves.

      CERI sniffs the coffee - a big, animal sniff which draws 
      looks from the other patrons.  Bends down to it rather than 
      lifting the cup - laps some with her tongue -

      And recoils, spitting it out!  

      RHYDIAN wants the ground to open up and swallow him.  And 
      CERI can see that.

                                  CERI (CONT D)
                    You don t need to be afraid.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    I m not afraid.  I m embarrassed.  
                    There s a difference.

                                  CERI
                    Different word, same human emotion.

      The way she says  human , it s not a good thing.

                                  CERI
                    My beautiful boy.

                                    RHYDIAN
                      Newsflash,  Mum  - you re twelve 
                    years late. 

                                  CERI
                      I couldn t find you!  I d left you 
                    safe while we went hunting.  When I 
                    came back they were taking you away 
                    in their machines. 

                                    RHYDIAN
                    You could have gone to Social 
                    Services, told them you were my 
                    mother.

                                  CERI
                    They d have locked me up.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Not if you d lived like a human 
                    being.

                                  CERI
                    That s worse than being locked up.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    So why come back for me now?

                                  CERI
                      I sensed your first transformation.  
                    Knew it was time for you to live 
                    the life you were born for.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    And you found me how?

                                  CERI
                    A true wolfblood can always find 
                    their kin.

                    Her pack were here for me when you 
                    were too busy running wild -

                                  JIMI
                    Hey, Bernie!

      JIMI, SAM and LIAM have taken a table nearby.  Pretending to 
      be talking among themselves, while actually well aware 
      RHYDIAN can hear.

                                  JIMI (CONT D)
                    Has something gone off in here?  
                    There s a nasty smell about.

                                  LIAM
                    I think it s coming from that 
                    table.

      RHYDIAN grits his teeth.  But he has more important things to 
      concentrate on than those idiots.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    You don t know anything about my 
                    life.

                                  CERI
                    I can see your life, right here.

                                  MADDY
                    Leave it out, Jimi.

                                  JIMI
                    Yeah, better be careful, he might 
                    punch me.  But he d probably miss!

      LIAM and SAM cackle with laughter.

                                  CERI
                    You brought this on yourself, 
                    trying to live by their rules.  You 
                    can t go over there and teach them 
                    the lesson they deserve without 
                    revealing yourself.  You can t be 
                    human - but as long as you re 
                    hiding, pretending, you can t be 
                    truly Wolfblood either.

                                  JIMI
                    So who d youthink his new friend 
                    is?

                                  LIAM
                    Maybe it s a self-help group.  
                    Weirdos Anonymous!

      More LAUGHTER.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Can we just go somewhere else?

                                  CERI
                    Of course.

      She and RHYDIAN get up.  

      JIMI pulls a face, holds his nose.  SAM and LIAM snigger-

      CERI seems not to have noticed but as she turns, her hand 
      flashes out, wolf-fast - GRABS AND TWISTS JIMI s EAR!

      JIMI shrieks.  As she raises her hand, he has no choice but 
      to scramble out of his chair, let her drag him closer, or the 
      pain would be worse -

                                  BERNIE
                    Pack it in!

      MADDY is on her feet, RHYDIAN s grabbed her arm but...

      CERI pulls JIMI close and SNARLS into his face. The most 
      terrifying thing he s ever seen.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Stop it!

      He pulls her off JIMI who falls back into the table.  MADDY 
      and BERNIE scramble to help JIMI up - SAM and LIAM are just 
      staring, paralyzed by fear

                                  JIMI
                    She s an animal!  She should be 
                    locked up!

      RHYDIAN bundles the still snarling CERI out of the door.

                    So why was Rhydian talking to her?

      The classroom door opens - expecting Jeffries, the pupils 
      quieten down a little -

      But it s RHYDIAN.  A little scruffy and tired, but okay.

      MADDY feels like she s been holding her breath for the last

      In order to get it to fit, he has to take something out and 
      put that in the locker separately.

      It s a sleeping bag.  Folded clothes under it in his bag.  
      He s packed to leave home.

      MADDY approaches his locker.  She s seen the sleeping bag.

                                  MADDY
                      Rhydian, what are you doing?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    I m going with her.

                                  MADDY
                    What?  

                                    RHYDIAN
                    She s my mother. She can teach me 
                    things...

                                  MADDY
                    You can t just run away.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    It won t be the first time.  It s 
                    just the first time I ve had people 
                    I m sad to leave behind.

                                  MADDY
                    I ll tell Jeffries.  Or ring your 
                    foster parents.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    You won t.  Tom or Shannon would - 
                    they d think they were doing the 
                    right thing, saving me from a 
                      hopeless mother.  But you know the 
                    truth.  I m going to live the life 
                    I was born for.

                                  MADDY
                    And what if it isn t?  What if you 
                    get there and you hate it?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Maybe I will.  But you have to let 
                    me try.

      MADDY can t believe he s asking her to keep this secret.  But 
      she also knows he s right.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      TOM moving between classes. RHYDIAN catches him up. 



                                    RHYDIAN
                    Hey, Tom, I owe you an apology.

                                  TOM
                    You feeling all right?  Should I 
                    get the nurse?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    I m serious.  The football team, 
                    all that stuff.  I let you down.

                                  TOM
                    Nah. itwas dumb - expecting you to 
                    be brilliant when you don t even 
                    like football. 

                                    RHYDIAN
                    What can I do to make it up? For 
                    you, I mean?  

      TOM stops.  RHYDIAN too.

                                  TOM
                    Is this a wind-up?

                                    RHYDIAN
                      Why dyou say that?

                                  TOM
                      Because...you reacting sort 
                      of...cuddly.

                                    RHYDIAN
                      Seriously, Tom.  I wanna leave with 
                    a clean slate.

                                  TOM
                    Leave?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    ...this issue...withno bad 
                      feeling.

                                  TOM
                    Well, you could join the team 
                    again.

                                    RHYDIAN
                      I can t.

                    Because I don t belong.

                                  TOM
                    Mate.  The last time I heard such 
                    total rubbishwas Shannon claiming 
                    she watched a ZacEfronmovie cos 
                    of the plot.
                          (but seriously)
                    You belong where you want to be.  
                    If you want to be on the team - 
                    even for one game - then make it 
                    happen.  

                                    RHYDIAN
                    I can do that?  Join for one game?

                                  TOM
                    It s our biggest match of the 
                    season. The one everybody wants.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      TOM, MISS GRAHAM, RHYDIAN

      TOM hovers at a distance.  MISS GRAHAM, putting equipment 
      away, talks to RHYDIAN -

                                  MISS GRAHAM
                    When you re in a team, you ve made 
                      a commitment.  Whatever s going on 
                    your life, you have a 
                      responsibility to the team - and 
                    they have a responsibility to you.

                                    RHYDIAN
                      I understand that.

                                  MISS GRAHAM
                    One last chance.  But this time, 
                    you d better play like you mean it&

      TOM grins.  Job done!

                                                                            CUT TO:


      RHYDIAN, SAM, TOM, N.SFOOTBALL TEAM, LIAM, JIMI

      The home team are changed and doing their own little warm-up 
      routines.  Chattering and laughter -

      The door opens.  It s RHYDIAN.  Hostile silence.  Players 
      glare at him.  Stung, hiding it, RHYDIAN unpacks his kit. 

                                  SAM
                    He can t play.  

                                  TOM
                    We need him.

                                  SAM
                          (final desperate ploy)
                    He doesn t even have any boots!

      JIMI reaches under the bench, pulls out the boots RHYDIAN 
      discarded yesterday - and offers them back to him.

                                  JIMI
                    You re on, Welshie.  Let s get out 
                    there and win!

      SAM collapses onto a bench with a groan.  Foiled again!

                                                                            CUT TO:

      JIMI, LIAM, SAM, TOM, RHYDIAN, N.SFOOTBALL TEAM

      Everyone's changing, and leaving.  JIMI, about to leave with 
      LIAM, SAM, and TOM, stops to look back at RHYDIAN.

                                  JIMI
                    Burgers at Bernie s.  You coming?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Maybe later.

                                  JIMI
                    Great save.  Great throw.  

      He sounds almost puzzled by that - how did this weirdo save 
      the day? - but he s happy all the same.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Cheers, Jimi.

                                  TOM
                    Laters, yeah?

      They leave.  RHYDIAN s alone in the dressing room.  Packs up 
      his bulging rucksack.  Holds up the football boots, looks at 
      them long and hard.

      He s having second thoughts about his decision.

                                                                            CUT TO:
