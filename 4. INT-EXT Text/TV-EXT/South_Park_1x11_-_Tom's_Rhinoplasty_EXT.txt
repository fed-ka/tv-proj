               The boys are all gathered on the playground.

                                     CARTMAN
                         She wasn't looking at you, buttLord!

                                     STAN
                         You guys can stop fighting, it was 
                         ME she was checking out.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Until you puked on her.

               Chef walks up.

                                     CHEF
                         Hello there, children. What's all 
                         this I'm hearing about a new teacher?

                                     KYLE
                         Ms. Ellen, dude! She's BEAUTIFUL!

               Wendy is sitting on the swingset next to her friend Bebe. 
               Bebe looks at Wendy who is hearing all of this and looking 
               pitiful.

                                     CHEF
                         Is she like, Vanessa Williams 
                         beautiful or Toni Braxton Beautiful?

               The boys think.

                                     CHEF
                         Or Pamela Anderson beautiful?

               The boys don't know.

                                     CHEF
                         Or is she Erin Grey in the second 
                         season of Buck Rodgers beautiful?

                                     STAN
                         Yeah, that one!

                                     CHEF
                         WWOOH!!! I gotta meet this woman!!

               Finally, Wendy walks up.

                                     WENDY
                         Stan, Didn't you notice how her left 
                         arm is longer than the right one?

                                     STAN
                         No.

                                     WENDY
                         Well it is!

                                     CHEF
                         That's okay. You know what they say 
                         about women with one arm longer than 
                         the other...

                                     KENNY
                         Mph rmph rm rmph rm rmph!!

                                     CHEF
                         That's right!

               The boys all laugh merrily.

                                     WENDY
                         Well did you notice that mole on the 
                         back of her neck with the hair growing 
                         out of it?

               Everybody thinks.

                                     CHEF
                         That's okay, you know what they say 
                         about women with a mole on the back 
                         of their necks with hair growing out 
                         of it...

               Pause...

               Kenny looks at Chef, confused.

                                     WENDY
                         Stan, we're still valentines, right?

                                     STAN
                         Sure, Wendy, whatever.

               The boys walk away AD LIBBING lines about Ms. Ellen (She is 
               so pretty) etc.

                                     KYLE
                         Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen 
                         Valentine's day presents!

                                     STAN
                         Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight!

                                     CARTMAN
                         I'm going to buy a vacuum cleaner. 
                         Chicks love vacuum cleaners.

               Wendy looks like she's about to cry as SAD MUSIC swells up. 
               TRACK in on Wendy's sad little face as the song begins:

                                     SONG
                         I remember when we were so in 
                         love.........

               As the SONG CONTINUES, we see a montage of Stan and Wendy 
               together:

               From Ep.1: Stan Barfs in the cafeteria. 
               From Ep.1: Stan's Barfs at Stark's Pond. 
               From Ep.7: Stan Barfs in the cemetery. 
               From Ep.1: Stan barfs in Wendy's face.

                                     SONG
                         The moments that we shared were 
                         timeless...

               The song ends, and poor little Wendy walks away, sniffling.


               Establishing.


               Establish.


               The song SHADOW DANCIN' by Andy Gibb starts up as we follow 
               Mr. Garrison's feet walking down the street a la Travolta.

               The camera PANS UP to reveal Mr. Garrison (still with is 
               Hasslehoff head, of course) walking proudly.

               He passes an attractive forty-something woman, Mrs. Kimble.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Hi, Mrs. Kimble.

                                     MRS. KIMBLE
                              (hot for him)
                         Oh, howdy, Mr. Garrison. Say honey, 
                         you look kinda different...

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Really?

                                     MRS. KIMBLE
                         Did you get a haircut?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         No, but thanks for asking.

               Garrison struts on down the street as the song continues, 
               with a big smile on his face.

                                     MRS. KIMBLE
                         Call me! I'm in the book!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Wow, Mr. Hat... Having a nose job is 
                         even better than I thought! There's 
                         a whole WORLD of opportunity opening 
                         up in front of us!


               It looks like every other house in South Park.


               It's day again in South Park.


               Establishing.


               Over somebody's shoulder, we can see into the lit up window 
               of the restaurant, where Ms. Ellen and Stan are talking.

               It's Wendy. She's looking in from outside in the rain.

               Like a scene from a movie, she just stands there, with a 
               demented look on her rain soaked face -- The light from the 
               neon sign flickering slowly.

                                     WENDY
                         It's over... I give up.

               Wendy lowers her sad little head, and walks away, as sad 
               PIANO MUSIC plays.


               Garrison is walking down the street slowly.

                                     GARRISON
                         Boy, I'll tell you something Mr. 
                         Hat. Being hot and sexy is fun for a 
                         while, but it sure does get boring.

                                     MR. HAT
                         You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!

               Just then, Garrison hears a growing sound. Women screaming...

               Garrison looks over and sees about fifteen South Park women 
               all charging towards him with love in their eyes. They all 
               ad lib ('ooh, there he is' and 'It's him! It's Mr. Garrison!')

                                     GARRISON
                         What the...

               The charging, screaming women surround Garrison, and like 
               crazed Elvis fans start kissing him and tearing off his 
               clothes.

                                     GARRISON
                         Hey wait, wait, wait....AGHAGAH!!! 
                         Mr. Hat save yourself.


               Garrison-Hasslehoff stops running and tries to catch his 
               breath. His clothes are torn to shreds.

                                     MR. GARRISON-HASSLEHOFF
                         Oh, Mr. Hat... I hate this, I wish 
                         I'd never had a nose job!!

               In the distance, the SCREAMING WOMEN can be heard.

                                     MR. GARRISON-HASSLEHOFF
                         Damn this beautiful face of mine!! 
                         Damn it to hell!!

               The screaming women round the corner. Garrison has to take 
               off running again.

                                     MR. GARRISON-HASSLEHOFF
                         We have to go get surgery again, Mr. 
                         Hat!! I want to be the old me again!!

               The screaming women chase Garrison through town.

               Garrison runs into Tom's Rhinoplasty. The screaming women 
               run by.


               Police cars, fire trucks, ambulances and helicopters swarm 
               the little school.

               Stan and Wendy stand amongst the horde of onlookers.

                                     STAN
                         Wow... I can't believe Ms. Ellen was 
                         a criminal Iraqi fugitive...

                                     WENDY
                         Yeah, you just never know.

                                     STAN
                         Well, I guess...I'm sorry that I was 
                         ignoring you and stuff.

               Wendy smiles.

                                     WENDY
                         Happy Valentines Day, Stan.

               Wendy puckers. Stan looks a little scared, but then moves 
               his mouth towards hers...

               Both kids open their mouths slightly...

               Stan vomits into Wendy's open mouth.

                                     WENDY
                         EW!!!

                                     STAN
                         Sorry.

                                     WENDY
                         No, it's okay Stan! Everything's 
                         going to be okay!

                                     KYLE
                         Cartman, are you still trying to 
                         become a lesbian?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah dude, my mom says all I have to 
                         do is chow on this box.

               THIRD COMMERCIAL BREAK


               Ms. Ellen is being escorted into what appears to be a large 
               missile.

                                     IRAQI
                         For crimes against this country, you 
                         are hereby sentenced to be shot into 
                         the center of the sun.

                                     MS. ELLEN
                              (Struggling)
                         THIS IS ALL A MISTAKE!! THIS CAN'T 
                         BE HAPPENING!!

               Ms. Ellen is thrown in the missile and the large door is 
               closed. We can see her through one of the windows, banging 
               on it.

                                     MS. ELLEN
                              (Muffled)

               Another Iraqi hits a switch-

               -and the missile blasts off into the sky. FWWWOOOMMM!!!!


               Establishing.


               Wendy has a little pool in her backyard, where she is having 
               a medium sized party.

               Adults are CHATTERING and drinking as Wendy sits in a small 
               little lounger next to Bebe. Both of them have frozen drinks 
               and sunglasses on.

               Several Women walk over to Wendy with their cocktails, oddly 
               enough, they are the women who were chasing Garrison.

                                     MRS. KIMBLE
                         Great Party, Wendy.

                                     WENDY
                         Thanks, Mrs. Kimble, thanks for 
                         helping me get Mr. Garrison to come 
                         back as a teacher.

                                     MRS. KIMBLE
                         Anything for you, sugarpie.

               Kyle walks up.

                                     WENDY
                         Oh, hi, Kyle.

                                     KYLE
                         I've been thinking, Wendy... This 
                         whole outcome is pretty strange...

                                     WENDY
                         Uh-huh, excuse me.

               Wendy to turns to a bunch of Iraqi's who are waiting in line.

                         How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly 
                         arrested for...

                                     WENDY

                         out the eclipse shoe boxes!

               Wendy holds up a shoebox to her eye.

               ANGLE - SHOEBOX

               We see the tiniest little splotz hit the sun and immediately 
               get engulfed.

                         Wendy, you didn't!

               Wendy says nothing. She just starts laughing.

               Kyle's eyes grow wide as Wendy's laugh turns completely 
               insane.

                                     WENDY
                         I told her! Don't fuck with Wendy 
                         Testaburger!!

                                         THE END
