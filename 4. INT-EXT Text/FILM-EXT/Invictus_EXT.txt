A big, rich, powerhouse all-white high school located near
the freeway into Cape Town. The RUGBY FIELDS are immaculate.
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS in striped rugby jerseys train with
total intensity under the critical eye of the COACH.
Right ACROSS THE BOUNDARY FENCE from the rugby fields is an
area of WASTE LAND leading up to the freeway. There, BLACK
AND "COLORED" (MIXED-RACE) BOYS of the same age play a loose
game of soccer with a tennis ball. Most of them have bare
feet and threadbare, dirty clothes, most of them are
noticeably smaller and skinnier than the white boys.
Two cultures, separated by more than the high boundary fence.
SUPER TITLE: SOUTH AFRICA, FEBRUARY 11, 1990
A COMMOTION ON THE FREEWAY intrudes on the soccer game.
Horns honking, cars pull over onto the shoulder, people jump
out.
Lead by police motorbikes, then patrol cars, a white Mercedes
approaches, heading towards Cape Town. Whoever is in the
Mercedes has stopped traffic.
The soccer players abandon their game and run for the
freeway, whistling and shouting.
The rugby players are more disciplined -- or obedient -- and
do not acknowledge the commotion until the convoy passes
right by them. The coach shakes his head in disgust.
HIGH SCHOOL BOY
Who is it, sir?
COACH
It's that terrorist, Mandela. They
let him out.
(BEAT)
Remember this day, boys. It's the
day our country went to the dogs.
CUT TO:
2.
A short, STOCK-FOOTAGE MONTAGE which spans the tumultuous
four years between NELSON MANDELA'S release from prison and
his inauguration as President of South Africa.
Footage would include:
- Mandela's release from prison
- negotiations with the apartheid regime
- scenes of white fear and emigration
- the horrifying sectarian violence leading up to the
ELECTIONS
- the khaki-clad AWB (Afrikaner right wing) attack on the
World Trade Center (where negotiations were taking place)
- the lifting of economic sanctions and cultural boycotts
- the lifting of the international ban on the Springbok rugby
team and immediate Test match losses to New Zealand and
Australia.
- popular black leader Chris Hani's assassination by white
RIGHT WINGERS
- black retaliation
- Mandela's frantic intervention to keep the country from
going up in flames
- the election itself, with those incredible images of
thousands and thousands of people, black and white, lining up
patiently, some to vote for the first time in their lives
- the African National Congress victory
- Mandela's inauguration as President, where he delivers the
FAMOUS WORDS:
"Never, never and never again shall it be
that this beautiful land will again
experience the oppression of one by another,
and suffer the indignity of being the skunk
of the world."
As APPLAUSE FADES ...
GO TO BLACK:
Mandela steps outside, closes his front door quietly, takes a
moment to savor the air. It is bone dry and cold -- typical
conditions in the Highveld at this time of year.
It is so quiet that, for a moment, it seems as if Mandela is
completely alone in the world.
The big yard is fenced. There is a small GUARD HOUSE at the
driveway gate.
When Mandela steps away from the house, A UNIFORMED SOUTH
AFRICAN POLICEMAN IN THE GUARDHOUSE pushes the button that
opens the gate.
When the gate begins to open we see that there are TWO GREY
BMWs parked either side of it.
As Mandela walks out through the gate, Jason and Linga
intercept him.
JASON
(traditional greeting in
XHOSA)
I see you, father.
Mandela's face comes alive as he smiles.
MANDELA
(without breaking stride)
Morning boys. How are you?
Jason is Mandela's head of personal security, Linga his
number one bodyguard. They are both former "terrorists", and
they are utterly devoted to Mandela.
JASON
We're sharp, Madiba.
MANDELA
Good ... good. And how's your
mother doing, Linga?
LINGA
She's much better, thank you.
MANDELA
Good.
Mandela picks up the pace. Jason and Linga fall back, so
that they are a few steps behind him.
They share a quick look. They hate this walk. It scares
them. There's no way for it to be anything but completely
unsanitary, from a security point of view.
CUT TO:
5.
A SMALL DELIVERY VAN drives really fast, blows through stop
signs.
CUT TO:
Mandela strides along the big, wide, tree-lined streets.
Jason and Linga shadow him, eyes and ears alert.
Up ahead, we see a SMALL, UPSCALE AREA OF SHOPS AND
RESTAURANTS.
CUT TO:
Mandela, Jason and Linga reach the shopping area. Dark,
deserted.
CUT TO:
ANOTHER ANGLE of the shops as the small van turns onto the
street with a squeal of tires.
CUT TO:
The SLIDING DOOR on the van IS OPENED from inside. Too dark
to see in. Ominous.
CUT TO:
Mandela, Jason and Linga pass a HUGE POSTER OF MANDELA in the
window of CORNER GROCERY. Mandela does not react to this
giant picture of himself, Jason and Linga do, proudly --
(A GENERAL NOTE: starting with the window of this grocery,
there are pictures of Mandela everywhere. Magazine covers,
newspaper centerfolds, T-shirts, children's art -- as if to
make up for all the time Mandela's image and words were
banned.)
-- until they HEAR THE SOUND OF THE VAN tearing towards them.
They turn, SEE HEADLIGHTS VEERING TO THEIR SIDE OF THE
STREET.
6.
BOTH MEN DROP THEIR HANDS TO THEIR GUNS. Linga steps in
front of Mandela, shielding him, Jason steps out wide, ready
for anything.
Mandela is completely calm. The van screeches to a halt just
past them.
A GUY jumps out of the van holding a tied BUNDLE OF
NEWSPAPERS, which he drops with a thump at the grocery door.
The guy doesn't see them. The delivery van is gone before
the newspapers stop moving.
Mandela heads for the newspapers -- he wants to see the
headlines.
Jason and Linga take their hands off their guns, but they do
not relax. These are dangerous times.
GO IN ON THE TOP NEWSPAPER, which shows a PHOTO OF THE
INAUGURATION, and the following words, in Afrikaans: HE CAN
WIN AN ELECTION, BUT CAN HE RUN A COUNTRY?
JASON
What does it say?
MANDELA
It says, "He can win an election,
but can he run a country?"
LINGA
(DISGUSTED)
Not even one day on the job and
they're after you.
MANDELA
It's a legitimate question.
Mandela turns and marches for home. Jason and Linga fall in
behind him. In the east, the first milky hint of day.
Magnificent, sweeping government buildings made of carved
African field stone, with an Italian tiled roof, situated on
a hill overlooking Pretoria. The seat of power.
Today, the entrance is mobbed with a huge, joyous, multi-
racial throng, plus news crews from all over the world. Lots
of new South African flags evident.
We move through the throng and swoop up into the air, so that
we can soar along the outside of the building and LOOK
THROUGH THE WINDOWS into the offices of state --
-- where people who worked for the De Klerk regime are
packing up, in anticipation of being booted out by the
Mandela regime. These characters run the gamut from little
old Afrikaner tea ladies in tears, to the stoic fossils of
grand apartheid. They are all white. A good third of the
offices are already deserted.
The deserted offices have open doors. Through a window,
through an open door, we see Mandela and his bodyguards
striding down a Union Building hallway.
We swoop in through the window --
As Jason -- very upset -- walks back to security, Jessie
holds out a file for him.
JESSIE
Two copies of the schedule.
Jason snatches the file, keeps walking.
JESSIE
Thank you, Jessie!
When he reaches the security office door, Jason walks right
past, keeps going, has to make a full loop of the reception
area, just to get himself together.
Even so, when he gets back to the security office door, Jason
pauses, gathers himself to do something that he knows he's
going to hate.
A huge, raucous crowd, almost entirely white and male. Many
wearing the Springbok green and gold. Widespread evidence of
drinking.
Lots of OLD SOUTH AFRICAN FLAGS -- the blue, white and orange
apartheid flag -- make a defiant statement against the NEW
SOUTH AFRICAN FLAGS ringing the stadium.
On the field, THE RUGBY TEAMS ASSEMBLE and face each other in
two lines. The BRITISH LIONS in their white on white with
black and red trim, the SPRINGBOKS in their green and gold.
Like their supporters, the Springboks are all white, but for
one man, who is "colored" (mixed race).
22.
Big, tough, brutal-looking men. Scary. (We may or may not
notice Francois Pienaar, standing at the head of the line of
Springboks.)
CUT TO:
-- onto the field, towards the waiting teams.
The crowd rise to their feet. Lots of them jeer Mandela,
lots cheer. All the old South African flags are waved at him
defiantly -- plus some new ones.
Mandela waves to them all, smiling proudly. To him, a crowd
is an opportunity to make new friends. But he stays in the
center of the field.
23.
Jason and crew are hyper-alert, a human fence around Mandela.
Mandela reaches the rugby players.
Waiting for him at the head of the Springbok line, wearing
the NUMBER 6 JERSEY and captain's armband, is FRANCOIS
PIENAAR. Now we know what he does.
Mandela extends his hand.
MANDELA
Good luck, captain.
PIENAAR
(SHAKING HANDS)
Thank you, sir.
Mandela shakes hands down the line of Springboks, then
returns, shaking hands with the British Lions. Quick,
perfunctory handshakes.
As Mandela does this, we take BODYGUARD POV SNAPSHOTS of the
crowd, increasingly keyed-up and restless. Time to play
rugby.
Mandela finishes, waves to the crowd, and begins the walk
along the center of the field, back to the tunnel.
Crowd noise increases. They know the opening whistle is
about to blow.
Then, Mandela sees something in the crowd, at field level.
MANDELA'S POV: A GROUP OF ROUGH-LOOKING WHITE MEN WAVE THE
NEW SOUTH AFRICAN FLAG AT HIM.
WITHOUT WARNING, MANDELA CHANGES DIRECTION, heads towards
this group, towards a wall of his former -- and perhaps
current -- enemies.
ON JASON: shit!
JASON
(INTO RADIO)
Stay with him.
ETIENNE
Stop him.
JASON
Stay with him.
24.
With his bodyguards scrambling to stay in position, Mandela
reaches the stands, hand outstretched, leans into the crowd.
MANDELA
Thank you for honoring our new
flag!
Some shake his hand, some -- very pointedly -- do not.
The crowd noise takes on an ugly undertone -- Mandela is
delaying the rugby.
Mandela is undeterred. He's into this one-on-one outreach.
He turns, looks for more hands to shake --
-- and Jason steps in between Mandela and the crowd.
JASON
We're delaying the rugby, Madiba.
MANDELA
Oh, yes, of course.
Mandela gives one last wave, turns away.
As he does, SOMEONE WINDS UP AND THROWS SOMETHING from the
stands.
Jason and Etienne catch the movement, whirl, too late.
AN ORANGE WHIZZES PAST MANDELA'S HEAD, explodes juicily on
the field.
Mandela didn't see it, doesn't react. If anything, his smile
widens as he heads across the field. The bodyguards close
around him protectively, get him back to the tunnel.
Two international front rows come together with bone-
crunching force.
Huge, violent men grunt like bulls. The crowd roar vibrates
the stadium. The scrum -- a phalanx of eight men locked
together against eight -- wheels, buckles, then steadies
under the watchful eye of the referee.
Fanning out behind each scrum are the backs -- faster, more
glamorous players who will run with the ball, or kick it.
The Lions scrumhalf thrusts the ball into the maw of the
scrum, the huge men lock up against each other with maximum
force.
The ball comes out the back of the Lions' scrum, the
scrumhalf dive-passes it away to the backs, who flick it out
laterally to the wing, with lightning speed.
The wing lofts a delicate kick just over the onrushing
Springbok defenders. The Lions charge the ball, which
bounces erratically --
-- right into the hands of the man who kicked it. One last
burst of speed, one quick juke to avoid a desperation tackle,
and the wing scores in the corner.
As the Lions kicker gets ready to convert the try, we find
the Springboks huddling under their goal posts, hands on
their hips, stunned.
26.
At the center of the huddle Pienaar bleeds behind his gum
guard as, furiously, he tries to inject some fire into his
team.
PIENAAR
Concentrate, dammit! Focus! We
can beat these guys if we play our
game, not theirs!
ON PIENAAR, as he realizes he is not getting through. There
is dullness, shock in his player's eyes --
-- which all lift to the heavens as the CONVERSION KICK SOARS
through the uprights.
We FOLLOW THE KICK as it drops past a GIANT SCOREBOARD.
STAY ON THE SCOREBOARD as it registers the conversion and
shows the score: LIONS - 10 SPRINGBOKS - 0
-- where the Lions score yet another try. This is an ass-
whipping.
CUT TO:
The conversion sails over the `boks heads.
The scoreboard clicks over to: LIONS - 20 SPRINGBOKS - O
One last, bloody, violent bit of play -- then, mercifully,
the final whistle blows.
Final score: LIONS - 32 SPRINGBOKS - 15.
The Lions celebrate. The Springboks head off the field,
heads down, shoulders bowed in defeat -- none more bitterly
disappointed or bloodier than Francois Pienaar.
In the stands, the unheard of happens -- the Springboks are
booed by their own fans. Not by everybody, but by enough.
We STAY WITH THE `BOKS as they trudge across the field, then
clatter along the concrete tunnel to their dressing room.
A very poor township outside Johannesburg. A stark reminder
of how much work Mandela has ahead of him. A STAMPEDE OF
KIDS runs by.
We FOLLOW THE KIDS and find a SMALL, BEAT-UP CHURCH. A noisy
LINE OF THREADBARE KIDS leads from outside into the church.
There is a pecking order in the line, based on size.
MRS. COLEMAN (O.S.)
No pushing now! There's enough for
everybody!
34.
Eersterust is a settlement and conference location just
outside Pretoria.
Today it is the location of a full membership meeting of the
National Sports Council, an ANC organization that is now the
governing body of all sports in South Africa.
A banner draped across the conference center entrance tells
us so: WELCOME NATIONAL SPORTS COUNCIL.
Grey BMW, armored grey Mercedes, grey BMW in a line at the
entrance.
Jason, Kwezi, Winston and Sam scramble out of the building
and dive into the lead BMW.
Etienne, Hendrick, George and Willem dive into the trailer.
37.
Ever the gentleman, Mandela ushers Barbara into the Mercedes.
As she gets in:
BARBARA
I strongly advise against doing
this. Especially on your own. It
... it gives the impression of
autocratic leadership.
Mandela's convoy heads away from Pretoria, very fast.
NSC FIREBRAND (V.O.)
... and in concluding this historic
conference ...
39.
Mandela's convoy roars in. Mandela is the first one out,
Linga next.
Jason and crew scramble to cover the immediate area.
Kwezi opens the door for Barbara on the other side.
Mandela strides over to Jason, says something to him. Jason
looks surprised, turns to Hendrick.
Linga's customary scowl intensifies.
CUT TO:
As delegates spill out of the conference hall, Mandela's
convoy leaves as fast as it arrived. It almost looks as if
they're fleeing.
43.
We are in a COURTYARD behind the palace. Drawn by four white
horses, A ROYAL CARRIAGE (an open carriage) pulls up, stops.
The courtyard quickly fills with liveried footmen, then
security guards.
QUEEN ELISABETH and Mandela emerge from the palace. Footmen
open doors on both sides of the carriage. The Queen and
Mandela climb in (the Queen on the right hand side).
When they sit down next to each other, Mandela leans over and
says something to the Queen that makes her giggle ...
... almost. For Queens do not giggle.
The carriage pulls forward and these two human icons sit up
straight, as they get set to face the world.
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
... and in London, President
Mandela made quite an impression on
the Queen --
CUT TO:
The PRESIDENT'S JET taxis towards the familiar BMW, Mercedes,
BMW convoy.
CUT TO:
Mandela disembarks, very slowly. He is exhausted, his feet
are swollen, his knee hurts. This is a very different man
than the one we have just seen wooing the world.
He is met at the bottom of the stairs by Hendrick.
HENDRICK
It's good to be home, sir.
Mandela just nods. Too tired to talk.
Hendrick escorts Mandela to the Mercedes, opens the door for
him.
Mandela takes a step towards the open door -- and staggers.
Reflexively, Hendrick reaches out, steadies him.
MANDELA
I'm fine.
Mandela steps out of Hendrick's hands, holds onto the open
door.
MANDELA
Travelling the world, begging for
money, is very tiring.
Mandela reaches into his jacket, pulls a SMALL PACKAGE out,
hands it to Hendrick.
MANDELA
This is for you.
Mandela slides into the car. Once the door is closed,
Hendrick glances at the package. We don't see it. It is too
dark.
But we do see that Hendrick is amazed by it.
CUT TO:
49.
The bodyguards' BMW's flank the gate. As the gate opens --
-- Linga gets out of one BMW, Hendrick gets out of the other.
They are alert. It is freezing cold.
Bundled up against the cold, Mandela emerges through the gate
and they close in on him. It is clear that he is pushing
himself, physically.
LINGA
(TRADITIONAL XHOSA
GREETING)
I see you, father.
MANDELA
Morning boys.
HENDRICK
Morning, sir.
They keep moving. It is too cold for anything else.
MANDELA
How is your family, Hendrick?
50.
HENDRICK
Top shape, sir. How about yours?
Mandela's smile becomes fixed on his face.
MANDELA
I have a very big family. 42
million people.
Then, he stops, turns, heads back towards the house.
MANDELA
I don't think I want to walk today.
Hendrick realizes that he blundered, somehow. He shoots an
anxious glance at Linga -- who looks at him as if he'd just
committed blasphemy.
Mandela goes through the open gate without a word. The gate
closes behind him, leaving Linga and Hendrick to watch him
through iron bars.
Linga turns on Hendrick.
LINGA
We never ask him about his family.
HENDRICK
But he asks about ours all the
time.
LINGA
Think about it, man. He's
separated from his wife. His
children ... how often do you see
them here?
(BEAT)
He's not a saint, okay. He's a
man, with a man's problems -- and
he doesn't need us reminding him
about them.
Linga heads back to his BMW. Hendrick stands at the gate,
looking in at the house.
CUT TO:
Nerine's modest little car heads towards the seat of power.
Pienaar climbs out of Nerine's car.
A pretty sizeable KNOT OF JOURNALISTS rush towards him.
Pienaar takes a deep breath. He is a bundle of nerves.
CUT TO:
When Pienaar steps outside and sees all of Pretoria -- all of
South Africa -- stretching away below him, he pauses. He
looks at his country in a new way.
A BEEP BEEP from Nerine's car interrupts his reverie, as she
pulls up at the bottom of the stairs.
On a PRACTISE FIELD at this world-class facility, the
SPRINGBOK SQUAD (about 30 guys) sprint to the 25 m line,
drops, begins 20 explosive push-ups.
NOTE, also, that at least half of the players who faced the
British Lions earlier are gone.)
68.
MINISTER OF SPORT (V.O.)
The World Cup is played every four
years. Sixteen teams qualify from
around the world.
CUT TO:
The Springbok squad leap up after the push-ups, sprint to the
50 m line, drop, begin 20 rapid crunches --
-- under the critical eye of the new COACH and MANAGER.
CUT TO:
The coach blows his whistle.
COACH
Again!
ON PIENAAR, as he leaps to his feet, leads the charge back to
the 25 m line.
CUT TO:
Hands on their knees, sucking air, retching, the squad has
worked their way down the full length of the field.
SPRINGBOK MANAGER
I reckon you've knocked the
stuffing out of them today.
COACH
I haven't even begun.
(BEAT)
We may not be the most talented
team in the world -- but we're
going to be the fittest.
He blows his whistle.
COACH
And back!
The squad can't believe their ears. No one moves. Except
Pienaar.
PIENAAR
Come on boys, let's show him.
Staggering more than sprinting, Pienaar heads towards the 25m
line.
SPRINGBOK FLANK
Shit, what's Pienaar been eating?
But, they follow him.
CUT TO:
A luxury bus heads along the freeway.
The same township where Sipho rejected the Springbok rugby
jersey.
At one edge we find what passes for a SOCCER FIELD. Just a
littered rectangular expanse of Highveld winter dirt.
75.
TV VANS and a very nervous SPRINGBOK MANAGEMENT CREW drive to
the edge of the field, stop, get out --
-- and are immediately mobbed by THREADBARE, EXCITED KIDS,
many of them begging for cash and candy. SIPHO in the thick
of things.
One of the Springbok management crew pulls a ROLLED BANNER on
two spiked poles out of their van.
Mallet and banner in hand, the management crew head to the
edge of the field, mobbed by shouting, whistling township
kids.
They hammer one pole into the ground, unroll the banner (seen
from the back so that we can't read the words), get set to
hammer the second pole into the ground --
-- except that there is a SMASHED BEER BOTTLE in the way.
Broken glass everywhere.
They look at the broken glass, then turn and look across the
field.
Broken glass glints in the low sun, all over the field.
SPRINGBOK MANAGEMENT CREW#1
They can't play on this.
SPRINGBOK MANAGEMENT CREW#2
When are they due?
SPRINGBOK MANAGEMENT CREW#1
Fifteen minutes.
SPRINGBOK MANAGEMENT CREW#2
Plenty of time.
He reaches into his wallet, pulls out a R100 note (about
$17), holds it up high. The kids yell for it.
SPRINGBOK MANAGEMENT CREW#2
THIS GOES TO WHOEVER COLLECTS THE
MOST GLASS!
Mayhem, as kids sprint out across the field, hunting for
glass. Sipho goes for the tiniest, most treacherous shards.
CUT TO:
76.
The driver sounds the horn, as they pull into the township.
-- which is covered with kids on their hands and knees.
As the kids approach the bus, they dump their broken glass
under the banner, which reads --
77.
ONE TEAM, ONE COUNTRY
-- brown, green, white, blue shards tinkling and piling up,
like lethal jewels, backlit in the low winter sun.
One of the big kids gets the R100. Attention focussed on
THAT --
-- until the bus door opens with a loud hiss of hydraulics
and the Springboks exit, one by one.
Pienaar first, with a huge NET BAG OF PRACTISE BALLS over his
shoulder.
The Springboks are all so big, so strong, so healthy, they
look like gods, or aliens, emerging from a spaceship. The
kids go quiet, awed and uncomfortable.
Until Chester Williams steps off the bus, and there is a
collective sigh of recognition and wonder.
Now, the kids can relate to the Springboks. Even Sipho, who
looks on from the side of the field.
Springbok management notes it.
The TV crews note it.
Pienaar notes it.
PIENAAR
Okay Chester -- I reckon you're up.
CHESTER WILLIAMS
(PANICKING)
What am I supposed to do?
PIENAAR
What you do best.
Pienaar turns to the throng.
PIENAAR
WHO WANTS TO PLAY RUGBY?
A roar. They all do.
Pienaar opens the net bag full of rugby balls, gives a ball
to Chester.
PIENAAR
Let rip.
78.
Chester boots the ball out over the crowd, high and
incredibly far in the thin winter air. (60 yards, easily.)
Pienaar tosses balls to the others.
PIENAAR
Let's do our best.
One after another, the Springboks kick the balls high into
the air.
PIENAAR
Go get them!
The kids go after them. Sipho stays on the sideline.
BEGIN RUGBY CLINIC MONTAGE
Barely controlled chaos. Each Springbok works with one ball
and a group of kids. There are THREE THEMES to this montage.
FIRST, a primer on the basic rules of rugby, with
demonstrations.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
Who here knows the first rule of
rugby?
TOWNSHIP KID
Me!
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
What is it?
TOWNSHIP KID
Only hit the other players when the
ref isn't looking!
Laughter. A good ice-breaker.
PIENAAR
No. The first rule of rugby is you
can only pass the ball backwards or
sideways.
Pienaar demonstrates. (NOTE: All the rules are
demonstrated.)
VARIOUS SPRINGBOKS
- If you drop the ball, or pass it
forwards, you scrum for possession.
- This is a scrum.
- You kick forwards.
(MORE)
79.
VARIOUS SPRINGBOKS (cont'd)
If you kick it out of bounds, you
throw it back in to a lineout.
- This is a lineout.
- You score in four ways: a try,
when you dot the ball down behind
the try line. That's five points.
- Another two points when you
convert the try by kicking the ball
through the uprights.
- Three points for a penalty kick.
- Three points for a drop kick.
- Have you got all that?
KIDS
No!
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
Agh, bugger it, let's just run and
pass. Whoever drops the ball does
pushups!
SECOND, as the players work with the kids, they get into it.
Much to their own surprise, they enjoy the energy, they enjoy
the kids, they enjoy the giving. Even the grumpiest, most
conservative Springbok.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
Okay. Who wants to scrum against
me?
One huge man scrums against a horde of kids. He pushes them
backwards with a roar -- then lets them push him backwards.
They love it, the cameras love it.
THE THIRD THEME shows the emergence of Chester Williams as
the face of the Springboks. The crowd of kids around him is
twice as big as any other player's crew. Given Chester's
basically shy nature, he finds it all a bit overwhelming.
The TV cameras follow him even more closely than they follow
Pienaar.
AT ONE POINT, an errant pass puts a rugby ball right at
Sipho's feet. He hesitates, then picks it up. He doesn't
just hold it, he feels it.
END THE MONTAGE as the luxury bus pulls away, surrounded by a
horde of cheering kids, many of whom hold new rugby balls
under their arms.
One blast on the horn, one answering cheer from the kids and
the bus slowly accelerates away.
CUT TO:
80.
ESTABLISHING SHOT from the air of Cape Town, one of the most
beautiful cities in the world. We see the Cape Peninsula,
the harbor, the city itself draped around the shoulders of
Table Mountain like a multi-colored Mediterranean shawl.
On its descent towards Cape Town airport, a SOUTH AFRICAN
AIRWAYS JET flies across the view with the smiling face of
Chester Williams painted on the fuselage.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
This is Boland Botha coming to you
live from Cape Town airport --
From a position near an IDLING LUXURY BUS, Boland speaks into
his mike.
BOLAND BOTHA
-- where the Springbok flight has
just landed.
CUT TO:
ON THE APRON, the team disembarks.
The boys are dressed in Springbok blazers, slacks and ties.
A magnificent sight. Gladiators in top shape, faces
appropriately stern.
ON BOLAND BOTHA, next to the bus.
BOLAND BOTHA
(INTO MIKE)
I say cautiously, because in my
humble opinion --
Behind Boland, the Springboks get into the bus, fast.
BOLAND BOTHA
-- this team has been over-trained
on the field, and over-committed
off it.
CUT TO:
The luxury bus comes around a bend in a leafy suburb of Cape
Town, right under the flanks of Table Mountain.
Ahead, we see NEWLANDS STADIUM, home of the World Cup opener
between the Springboks and Australia.
A magnificent old stadium in a beautiful setting.
The bus pulls away.
84.
WE STAY AT NEWLANDS STADIUM -- and SWOOP UPWARDS until we are
looking down on the stadium and surrounding streets.
This AERIAL SHOT BECOMES A BIG MAP --
The entire Springbok squad has been on a training run through
Cape Town, on ordinary streets, through ordinary people.
(This is unthinkable in top-level sports anywhere else. It
really happened.)
When they are recognized, drivers toot their horns,
pedestrians cheer, kids on bicycles ride with them (mostly
still white).
As they approach the hotel grounds, Pienaar surges to the
front, so that he can give them a message as they pass
through the hotel gate.
PIENAAR
Players-only meeting in the team
room after dinner.
A SOUTH AFRICAN DEFENSE FORCE HELICOPTER hovers over the tall
building next to Newlands stadium.
Helicopter against spectacular scenery.
Mandela's helicopter lands at the edge of the field, and
brings practise to a halt.
ON COACH -- not happy, but what's he going to do.
Mandela springs out of the helicopter, energized, excited.
Linga and Jason with him.
The players assemble in a loose, semi-formal unit. Not a
line, but orderly. (We may or may not notice that Chester
Williams is missing.)
Pienaar stands at the front, relaxed. He's an old hand with
Mandela, by now.
MANDELA
Francois, gentlemen -- forgive me
for interrupting your work the day
before such an important match ...
(BEAT)
... I just wanted to wish you good
luck, in person.
There is a naughty twinkle in Mandela's eye.
MANDELA
And sometimes, very seldom, as
President, I am allowed to do what
I want.
They all laugh.
91.
Mandela wades in amongst them, leaving Linga and Jason
behind.
Picture this: Behind the barbed wire security of a modern,
South African military base, a tall, regal black man in his
70's is surrounded by huge, sweating, battered, brutal-
looking white men --
PIENAAR
(DOING INTRODUCTIONS)
Mr. President, this is --
MANDELA
I know who this is.
(SHAKING HANDS)
Good luck, Andre.
(shaking hands with all of
THEM)
Good luck Brendan, we're behind you
all. Japie -- etc
-- every single one of whose names he has committed to
memory. Statesmanship is often about attention to detail.
The players are awe-struck.
(FOR THE RECORD: Andre, Gavin, James, Japie, Christiaan,
Brendan, Hennie, Joel, Johan, Joost, Marius, James, Chris,
Pieter, Garry, Mark, Kobus, Hannes, Krynauw, Ruben, Francois,
Robby, Adriaan, Rudolf.)
CUT AWAY to Jason and Linga, who are amazed by what they're
seeing.
LINGA
Did you ever imagine this?
JASON
How could I?
By the time Mandela has shaken every single player's hand, he
has won the team over, coach and manager included. They
glow.
And then, Mandela frowns, steps back, looks at all of them.
MANDELA
But where is Chester?
Pienaar doesn't answer immediately, he looks at his coach
first. Coach nods.
92.
PIENAAR
He's injured, sir. His hamstring.
We're trying to keep it quiet.
MANDELA
Is he out for the whole tournament?
PIENAAR
With hamstrings, who knows?
(BEAT)
We'll miss him.
MANDELA
The whole country will miss him.
A somewhat sour note to leave on. But it's about to be
rescued.
SPRINGBOK PROP
Mr. President, sir --
MANDELA
Yes, Hennie.
SPRINGBOK PROP
-- this is for you. From us.
The huge, thick man holds out a GREEN CAP with gold piping
and a Springbok leaping above the visor.
Mandela takes the cap as if he has just been given a holy
relic.
MANDELA
I am honored. Truly honored.
Mandela runs his finger over the embroidered Springbok
leaping across the front of the cap.
MANDELA
Good luck gentlemen. Your country
supports you, completely.
The team applauds, beaming, glowing.
Mandela turns to go back to the helicopter.
MANDELA
Francois, walk with me.
Pienaar walks Mandela back towards the helicopter.
93.
MANDELA
I have something for you.
Mandela reaches into his jacket, pulls out an ENVELOPE WITH
THE PRESIDENT'S LETTERHEAD on it. Gives it to Pienaar.
MANDELA
This helped me, many times.
Perhaps it will help you, too.
CUT TO:
Pienaar holds the envelope, stares upwards at the rising,
departing helicopter, as do the rest of the team -- until
Coach blows his whistle.
COACH
Enough fun and games! We've still
got work to do.
CUT TO:
A massive crowd roars.
The Wallaby flyhalf runs forward, puts his boot into the
ball, sends it soaring towards the waiting Springboks.
The Springbok lock rises high into the air, supported on all
sides, takes the ball out of the air perfectly --
-- just as the Wallaby pack closes in and huge men meet with
an adrenaline-fueled crunch of bodies.
The World Cup has begun at last.
CUT TO:
But not for Chester Williams. Clad in Springbok blazer and
tie, he sits behind the coach, the manager and the reserves,
in the stands -- and almost succeeds in hiding his utter
disappointment at not being on the field.
96.
Jason prowls through the stadium, talking constantly on his
radio. Hunter's adrenaline.
CUT TO:
Back to action on the field.
The highlights we see here should match the rugby primer we
saw in the township. This continues the education of those
who do not know rugby.
So, for instance, we see a ball knocked forward, and the
resulting scrum.
We see a ball kicked out of bounds, and the resulting
lineout.
We see scintillating passing, rucking, mauling, tackling,
strategic kicking at it's very best. Both teams are crisp
and strong.
INTERCUT SHOTS OF THE RUGBY MATCH --
-- with SHOTS OF THE SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS (snipers, lots and
lots of uniformed cops inside and out, sniffer dogs etc. all
overseen by Jason) --
-- with SHOTS OF THE CROWD, which, unlike the earlier test
against the Lions, is completely and passionately united
behind the Springboks (all commentators talk about the
extraordinary passion of the crowd, that day) --
-- always returning to the VIP BOX, where something
interesting is taking place right behind Mandela: Linga
Moonsamy, the rugby scorner, the soccer lover, loses his
scowling reserve and gets sucked into the game.
97.
When a ball soars between the uprights and everyone in the
box groans, Linga leans towards Hendrick and asks:
LINGA
What happened?
HENDRICK
They scored.
When another ball soars between the uprights and the crowd
roars, Linga asks again:
LINGA
What happened?
HENDRICK
We scored.
A third ball through the uprights. Before Linga can ask:
HENDRICK
They scored again.
A fourth ball, to the joy of the others in the box.
LINGA
We scored?
HENDRICK
Ja. We're tied.
A fifth ball through the uprights, and the crowd goes wild.
HENDRICK
We're up by three.
ACTION ON THE FIELD, as a Wallaby drive combining backs and
forwards moves relentlessly towards the Springbok try line.
Six times the drive is stopped by Springbok tackling, but the
Wallabies keep possession and, on the seventh wave of the
assault score a beautiful open try, which is converted.
A ripple of concern goes through the crowd --
-- and the VIP box.
LINGA
They're ahead?
HENDRICK
By four.
Nerves in the box.
98.
But not on the field, as Pienaar starts a drive with a tackle
we feel ourselves, resulting in a change of possession --
-- and a stunning, open field try scored in the corner by the
Springbok wing, who raises his fist in the air, after juking
the last Wallaby to try and tackle him.
The crowd roars.
In the VIP box, Mandela is on his feet, shaking hands with
everyone he can reach, including Linga and Hendrick, and the
waiter.
The difficult, angled conversion is missed.
LINGA
What does that mean?
HENDRICK
We're only ahead by one.
Another penalty kick.
HENDRICK
We're ahead by four.
A drop goal.
HENDRICK
By seven.
An incredible try by the Springbok fly half.
HENDRICK
By fourteen.
Everyone dares to dream. The classic South African penchant
for pessimism begins to abate.
Two things to note: The crowd roar grows and grows and grows
and is echoed in the VIP box. Even Jason turns to look at
the action on the field -- but only for a second. Also, this
match serves as the coming-out party for the SPRINGBOK FLY
HALF, who scores 22 of South Africa's 27 points this day.
SUDDENLY, A REFEREE'S WHISTLE CREATES PANDEMONIUM on the
field, in the stands, and in the VIP box.
LINGA
What happened?
HENDRICK
We won!
99.
LINGA
We did?
Mandela shoots to his feet, pushes his chair away and begins
the famous "Mandela shuffle" -- a very cool African boogie
that is one of his signature moves. ON THE MANDELA SHUFFLE --
DISSOLVE TO:
Big party, spilling onto the streets. Most of the partiers
are white. Black South Africans look on, or serve drinks.
We follow the crowd into a big sports bar --
Pienaar leads his hung-over, sleep-deprived team on a very
slow jog through the mostly empty streets.
101.
When he gets to an intersection, he sneaks a peek down at the
palm of his left hand.
CLOSE-UP ON PIENAAR'S HAND, where he has drawn a crude street
map.
Pienaar takes a left at the intersection.
CUT TO:
Another intersection, another peek at the map on his hand,
and another left turn, takes the team --
-- back onto the waterfront, to an idling FERRY BOAT, where
the coach and the manager wait for them -- along with the
player's wives and girlfriends.
COACH
I hope you're not that slow next
week.
Pienaar grins, stops. The team stops around him.
SPRINGBOK FLYHALF
What's going on?
PIENAAR
A change of pace.
CUT TO:
The ferry pulls away from the waterfront, with the team on
board, pulling on tracksuits against the cold sea air.
It is early winter. The seas are fairly rough.
So are the stomachs of the `boks who partied hard last night.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
Who's bloody idea was this?
ON PIENAAR, innocent as a lamb.
102.
Behind the ferry, Cape Town and Table Mountain, in all their
glory.
Ahead of the ferry, one of the most notorious island prisons
in modern history --
-- ROBBEN ISLAND.
Robben Island lies only eight miles from the mainland. It is
two miles long, with sandy beaches full of penguins and
seals. It would be pretty --
-- but for its MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON. Concrete, barbed
wire, guard towers.
(In 1995, the political prisoner wing was shut, but the
island still housed criminal prisoners, so the island still
had the feel of real incarceration. Today, it is a tourist
destination.)
As they approach the island, a sense of dark history settles
over the Springboks and their partners.
One of the Springboks turns to a DECKHAND, getting ready to
moor at the jetty.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
How do they bring the prisoners
here?
DECKHAND
On this boat.
Sobering.
The Springboks and their partners step onto dry land with
some relief, look around at the prison, humbled.
103.
NERINE
(TO PIENAAR)
Imagine being able to see Cape Town
so close by.
PIENAAR
That would make it worse.
They head towards the prison entrance, slowly becoming a
tighter and tighter bunch. The ghosts of Mandela, and all
the others who spent much of their lives here, are very
strong.
CUT TO:
VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE SPRINGBOK PARTY, in the EXERCISE YARD,
the LIME QUARRY, the MESS HALL. None of the usual horsing
around. This place affects them, deeply.
CUT TO:
The gates open. Linga gets out of one BMW, Hendrick out of
the other. We know the routine.
Only, Mandela doesn't appear for his walk. Linga and
Hendrick wait for a moment, then head in through the gate --
-- break into a sprint, when they see MANDELA'S FORM,
CRUMPLED on the lawn.
CUT TO:
Chester Williams jogs under the tense eye of coach, trainer,
manager and Pienaar.
He accelerates, running fast, but not sprinting.
COACH
That's not good enough.
Chester opens it up. Full sprint, sustained. Pienaar grins.
Chester is back.
COACH
Let's hope the Samoans don't injure
it again.
CUT TO:
ONE, BRIEF SHOT of a typically brutal Samoan tackle, and the
ensuing foul play in the maul.
CUT TO:
FOUR QUICK SHOTS of Chester williams scoring four tries.
CUT TO:
ONE MORE SHOT of the Springboks trudging off the field.
Every single player is bruised or bleeding, or both.
CUT TO:
Rain, rain, rain. The field is flooding.
CUT TO:
A HUNDRED ZULU CLEANING LADIES with brooms and squeegees push
the water off the field. Capacity crowd cheers them on.
(This happened. There will be stock footage.)
CUT TO:
A quagmire, despite the efforts of the Zulu ladies. Muddy
green and gold against the muddy blue, white and red of
France. End of a close game. Both teams are tired, muddy
and desperate.
The French assault the Springbok try line, wave after wave.
The Springboks defend valiantly, but slowly go backwards.
Finally, the French score a try -- or do they?
CLOSE-UP ON THE RUGBY BALL, under a mountain of muddy men, on
the ground three inches outside the try line.
110.
The referee waves off the try.
CUT TO:
The sound of the match ON THE RADIO of one of the BMWs.
Johan Lomu's name in every sentence.
All the bodyguards are out of the cars, enjoying the winter
sunshine as they listen to the match.
KWEZI
So, let me understand this. The
All Blacks are killing a team that
thrashed us last year?
ETIENNE
Thanks for reminding me.
Hendrick opens the trunk of their BMW, pulls out a RUGBY
BALL, shows it to Linga.
Linga nods. Okay. Throw it.
CUT TO:
A pile of guns in holsters, on the hood of a BMW. Suit
jackets draped over the side mirrors.
In the wide street, in their shirts and ties, the boys toss
the ball around. The white bodyguards handle the ball
expertly, the black bodyguards for the first time in their
lives.
ETIENNE
Give it a spin when you pass it.
(DEMONSTRATING)
Like this.
Kwezi catches the ball, tries to throw it with spin, blows
it. The ball bounces crazily all over the street, seems to
have a mind of its own as it eludes Kwezi.
They all laugh.
CUT TO:
113.
Two mixed teams. Hendrick passes to Linga, who passes back
to Hendrick, who scores.
HENDRICK
(PANTING)
You should've played rugby.
LINGA
(PANTING)
They wouldn't let me carry my gun.
Laughter. This scene was unthinkable a year ago.
CUT TO:
114.
BMW, Mercedes, BMW, driving from Pretoria to Johannesburg at
the end of the day. Red winter sunset over the arid
Highveld. GO `BOKS, GO AMABOKOBOKO signs, side by side.
Chester and Pienaar billboards.
MINISTER OF SPORT (V.O.)
The All Blacks beat Ireland 43 to
19 --
The two BWMs wait faithfully.
Linga gets out, meets Hendrick at the gate.
LINGA
Big day.
HENDRICK
Be an even bigger day if we
actually won.
120.
Then, they both look at their watches again.
HENDRICK
Where is he?
They share a worried look. Linga reaches for his radio.
CUT TO:
Mary's voice on Linga's radio.
LINGA
(INTO RADIO)
Okay, thanks. Out.
Linga lowers his radio, embarrassed.
LINGA
He's sleeping in.
HENDRICK
Or was.
Linga and Hendrick stand at the gate for a moment, then turn
to head back to their respective cars. Linga pauses.
LINGA
I had an idea. About today.
(BEAT)
It's a crazy idea.
121.
HENDRICK
Hey, don't worry, man. I already
know you're crazy.
CUT TO:
Mary walks briskly to her car, gets in and drives towards the
opening gate, fast.
CUT TO:
Linga and Hendrick watch as Mary drives away.
122.
HENDRICK
Now you've done it.
CUT TO:
As in Cape Town, the Springboks jog through the streets. As
in Cape Town, cars toot their horns, people cheer.
But the crowd running with them is twice as large as it was
in Cape Town -- and twice as black.
This crowd shows that the Springboks really do have the
support of the whole country now.
As the `boks rumble past, newspaper vendors, gardeners,
pharmacy delivery men on small motorbikes abandon their tasks
and run alongside the team.
Pienaar turns to look at one of his teammates, grins, gets a
grin in return.
CUT TO:
It is hours before the match, but every entrance to Ellis
Park stadium is chaotic with people, cars, face painters,
flag sellers, fruit vendors. Cops everywhere, and everywhere
outnumbered.
In the crowd outside, WE FIND SIPHO, collecting empty bottles
from trash cans, for recycling.
Jason was right about the demographics of the crowd: white,
khaki-clad, quite a few old South African flags among the sea
of new flags. Springbok colors everywhere. We may even see
the FOUR BOERE from the Lions debacle earlier.
FACE PAINTER
(TO BOERE)
Face flag?
BOER
Bugger off!
Ellis Park isn't exactly the Rainbow Nation today.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
We're at Ellis Park on this
historic day, where, even this
early, crowd excitement is at fever
PITCH --
Boland does another live remote. FANS CHEER AND WAVE behind
HIM
BOLAND BOTHA
-- because their beloved green and
gold have somehow managed to exceed
all expectations.
CUT TO:
124.
A luxury bus pulls away from the hotel, with a FULL POLICE
ESCORT, LIGHTS ON, SIRENS BLARING.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
But now they come up against a team
that is unlike any other they have
played.
CUT TO:
Mandela's Mercedes exits his gate, BMWs fore and aft.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
To lose to them is no disgrace. To
lose to them in the finals is, in
fact, an honor.
CUT TO:
Back to Boland's live remote.
BOLAND BOTHA
So, take a reality check, sit back
and share an afternoon with one
billion fellow fans around the
world. And as you do, feel a
special pride in having made it
this far. This is Boland Botha,
signing off and sitting back at
Ellis Park.
Huge crowd now, all around the TV truck, streaming in.
CUT TO:
Driving down a secure access lane, the Springbok bus and
police escort approach Ellis Park.
And pass Sipho, who stares up at them from the sidewalk.
CUT TO:
Mandela's convoy pulls up at a secure entrance.
CUT TO:
Stadium almost full. Crowd noise a dull roar.
ABOVE THE SPRINGBOK BENCH, near the field, we find Nerine,
Mr. and Mrs. Pienaar ... and Eunice, as they take their
seats. Pienaar got the fourth ticket for her.
126.
Eunice turns to Mrs. Pienaar.
EUNICE
What's Mr. Francois doing now?
CUT TO:
Vast city seen from the air. Zero in on Ellis Park.
CUT TO:
ANOTHER ANGLE of a SOUTH AFRICAN AIRWAYS 747 flying over the
city, in the direction of Ellis Park.
Every seat full. Almost every seat filled by a big white
man. Excitement unbearable.
Jason stalks the runways between the seating sections, high
in the stadium. Binoculars around his neck, radio in hand.
Something catches his eye. Something in the air. Jason
lifts his binoculars to his eyes.
POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -- the 747 is heading right for the
stadium.
Jason lowers his binoculars. He frowns -- more puzzled than
alarmed. (This is pre-9/11.)
He lifts his radio to his mouth.
JASON
(INTO RADIO)
Do you see that jet, to the east?
CUT TO:
Etienne, in another part of the stadium, looks eastwards --
sees it.
ETIENNE
(INTO RADIO)
Did they get clearance for this?
CUT TO:
JASON
(INTO RADIO)
Not from us.
The 747 gets closer, fast.
Jason is hit by a horrible thought.
128.
JASON
(INTO RADIO)
Where is he?
LINGA
(ON RADIO)
VIP BOX.
Jason finds the VIP box, looks out at the 747 --
-- and realizes that the jet is heading straight at that side
of the stadium.
JASON
(INTO RADIO)
Get him out of there. Now.
CUT TO:
Nothing Jason can do about it but hold his breath as --
SMASH CUT TO:
Jason has to fight down the impulse to flee.
SMASH CUT TO:
129.
The 747 nose appears over the rim of the stadium.
SMASH CUT TO:
The ALMIGHTY ROAR OF FULL THROTTLES fills the stadium, as the
747 passes less than 200 feet overhead --
-- so that everyone can read the huge letters painted on the
bottom of the wings:
GOOD LUCK BOKKE
(This really happened.)
THE CROWD GOES WILD.
JASON NEARLY FAINTS with relief.
-- where the already-whipped up crowd goes crazy, as both
teams sprint onto the field and go through their brief warm-
up ritual.
WE FOCUS ON THE CROWD, focus on how white and old South
Africa most of them are.
The referee blows his whistle again, and both teams assemble
in a line, facing each other. Glaring like boxers across
immaculate green grass.
Mandela emerges into daylight, wearing not a suit, not a
Madiba shirt --
-- he is wearing Francois Pienaar's green and gold number 6
rugby jersey.
On his head is THE SPRINGBOK CAP given to him by the team in
CAPE TOWN
The crowd catches its breath. This is unprecedented,
shocking ... and brilliant.
The Springboks digest this extraordinary display of support.
132.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
(murmuring to Pienaar)
The All Blacks won't like that.
Pienaar nods, eyes glinting. Mandela is giving them an edge.
As he walks towards the waiting teams, Mandela lifts the
Springbok cap high, waves it, and fires his famous,
beautiful, huge, African smile at the crowd --
-- who roar and stand, slowly, and start chanting, slowly ...
CROWD
Nelson ... Nelson ... Nelson ...
NELSON ... NELSON ... NELSON ...
63 000 South Africans, chanting as one.
CUT TO:
A QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS
ALL ACROSS SOUTH AFRICA, THE CHANT ECHOES through EMPTY
STREETS. Not a soul, not a car to be seen. Everyone is
inside, watching TV.
CUT TO:
CROWD
... NELSON ... NELSON ... NELSON
... etc.
Mandela shakes hands with the Springboks, who are brimming
with pride. Mandela shakes Chester Williams' hand with
special energy.
MANDELA
I'm so glad you're here.
Chester beams.
CUT TO:
IN THE STANDS, EUNICE ULULATES, loud African warrior woman
call. Mr. Pienaar looks at her, shocked. Looks at her as a
person for the first time, maybe.
MR. PIENAAR
DO THAT AGAIN!
133.
Eunice ululates again.
CUT TO:
ON THE FIELD, Mandela shakes hands with the All Blacks, who,
as predicted, don't like his partisan clothing. Mandela
looks up at Jonah Lomu.
MANDELA
Hello, Jonah.
Lomu looks down at Mandela, eyes glowing with aggression --
-- and suddenly, he bares his tattooed Tongan tongue in a
FIERCE WAR CRY.
As do the rest of the All Blacks.
WE HAVE SEGUED TO THE FAMOUS HAKA, a Maori war dance that
tells an opponent they're going have their daughters stolen,
their wives ravaged and their brains eaten right out of their
skulls with a sharpened tea spoon.
It is abundantly clear why, as the Minister of Sports told
Mandela, half of the All Blacks matches are won before the
whistle blows.
This is very intimidating.
Especially because, this day, the All Blacks push the haka
closer and closer to the Springboks --
-- who do not back down. In fact, they close ranks and
advance.
Major, major international smackdown. This is not fake. The
emotions, the aggression are real.
ON MANDELA, whose diplomatic mask slips a little showing a
warrior's glitter in his eyes. He wants to respond,
primally. His fists clench at his side.
The HAKA ENDS with a fearsome, guttural Maori yell.
ON THE SPRINGBOKS, massed together, faces red with emotion,
pulses racing.
Mandela takes a deep breath in.
Then the boys answer.
With, of course, a terrorist anthem of their own: NKOSI
SIKELEL' IAFRIKA.
134.
Pienaar starts it.
PIENAAR
NKOSI --
ALL SPRINGBOKS
-- SIKELEL' IAFRIKA etc ...
With decent pronunciation, with full fervor and heart, THE
BOYS ROAR THE ANTHEM back at the All Blacks.
The crowd joins them. "Nkosi" roars through the stadium,
through the nation.
ON MANDELA: his heart swells, as he sings with his people.
CUT TO:
ON JASON, who stands surrounded by his former enemies singing
the song that kept him -- kept all of them -- going through
the apartheid years.
In this stadium, at this moment, all hostility, all fear, are
a thing of the past.
The tension finally goes out of Jason's shoulders.
ON JASON'S FACE, close to tears, as NKOSI slowly fades.
As Mandela said -- a very inspirational song.
BEGIN HEARTBEAT OVER. Is that a heartbeat, or an African
drum?
CUT TO:
ON THE FIELD, the All Black fly half tees up the ball, for
kick off.
As the fly half back-pedals slowly, and pauses in readiness,
waiting for the whistle --
CUT AWAY:
TO RAINBOW NATION FACES, poised all over South Africa,
WATCHING ON TV and IN THE STANDS. Heart/drumbeat over.
The last face is Sipho's.
The crowd noise spills out of the stadium behind Sipho.
135.
A RADIO PLAYS NEARBY, tuned to the game. The radio is in a
cop car, manned by TWO BEEFY WHITE COPS. As the crowd noise
rises, Sipho edges closer to the cops. They eye him out.
CUT TO:
The referee blows his whistle.
The All Black fly half boots the ball towards the Springboks,
charges after it, along with the rest of the All Blacks.
Game on.
We have only seen snippets of rugby, so far. And mostly from
a somewhat polite distance -- the usual distance of TV
coverage. Say, at closest, the referee's point of view.
Not now. Not for the climax. We experience this beautiful
piece of mayhem up close and personal.
We're inside the heaving scrums. We are the ball. We see
the way cleats leave a pattern of round white dimples on
abused skin, which quickly turn to purple as they fill with
subcutaneous blood.
136.
We feel a tackle in our own spine; we see teeth sink into
flesh in the intimacy of a loose scrum; we feel a hard fist
smacking us again and again in the hot privacy of a rolling
maul.
For this is not a pretty match, not for one moment -- just as
the Springbok coach wanted.
This match is all about a less talented team stifling the
best team in the world by sheer determination and fitness.
This is about the Springboks applying continuous, unrelenting
pressure, and forcing the vaunted All Black attack into
making mistakes. Lots of them.
Dropped balls, errant passes, knock-ons. No fluency of
movement, no electric building of momentum.
Because of one thing: tackling.
Tackling and tackling and tackling again.
The first time Lomu touches the ball, the stadium, the nation
holds its breath --
-- until the Springbok wing scythes into him at thigh height,
wraps him up and brings him down.
The second time Lomu gets the ball he is brought down from
behind by Pienaar, with a picture perfect tackle.
We can cut away to the faces of the spectators when we want;
from Mandela to Nerine to Sipho and on and on, all over the
country. But, in truth, our attention belongs on the field.
ON PIENAAR, continually exhorting his men, leading by
example, wreaking havoc in the All Black backfield.
ON LOMU, who always seems just one broken tackle away from
running one in -- except that there are no broken tackles.
ON THIRTY BIG, STRONG, BATTLE-SCARRED MEN, who have devoted
their entire lives to this moment. They are not playing for
money. They are playing for pride, for their countries.
Outdated notions. We miss them.
No tries are scored in the Final. The two fly halves match
each other, penalty goal for penalty goal.
With each made kick, the goal posts shrink for the next. The
penalty goals are unchallenged. It is up to the kicker to
make them or fail. That is pressure.
137.
The score is 6 - 6 when, just before half time, the Springbok
fly half takes a long, perfect pass from the scrum half, and
with the All Black defenders looming, kicks a drop goal
through the uprights.
The Springboks lead 9 - 6. A tight match.
So tight, in fact, that there is only one score in the second
half -- an All Black drop goal that levels the score at 9 -
9.
Until right before the end of the match, when the All Blacks
camp in the Springbok half.
The scrum half sends a long, spiralling pass to the fly half,
who is in perfect position to go for a drop goal.
The kick soars into the air, high and straight.
43 million South Africans hold their breath.
All around the world, fans lean forward on their chairs.
This will be the decisive blow.
But the kick just goes wide.
Relief.
The referee blows his whistle to signal the end of
regulation. Both teams are spent.
Sipho leans on the cop car, listening to the radio. He and
the two cops suck nervously on sodas.
CUT TO:
138.
Two sets of bruised, bleeding, exhausted, cramping men face
each other for the extra time kick off.
Pienaar turns to his men.
PIENAAR
Who's the fittest team on this
field?
The answer lies in their eyes: they are.
An All Black penalty goal makes it 12 - 9 almost immediately.
A Springbok penalty goal answers. 12 - 12.
Seven minutes from the end of extra time, the Springboks earn
a scrum deep in All Blacks territory.
PIENAAR
Keep it here. Run it forward.
The scrum goes down, wheels a little.
SPRINGBOK FLY HALF
Francois!
Pienaar turns his head. The fly half taps his own chest:
give me the ball.
Pienaar hesitates, then nods to the scrum half: give him the
ball.
The ball goes into the scrum.
The ball works its way back through the feet of the eight
Springbok forwards.
The scrum half gathers it, spins it out to the fly half --
-- who takes one step to his left and KICKS A DROP GOAL high
into the air.
Ball soaring past a backdrop of open mouths. Higher than the
uprights ...
... but through them nonetheless.
Springboks 15 - 12 All Blacks.
An entire nation jumps to its feet.
139.
Pandemonium on the field, pandemonium in the stands.
Jason is hugged by an ecstatic boer (Jason is not a hugger).
CUT TO:
Mrs. Pienaar and Nerine are in tears. Mr. Pienaar hugs a
shocked Eunice.
Sipho toi-tois next to the cop car (a township war dance,
very political). The two cops toi-toi with him.
CUT TO:
AROUND THE NATION, an EPIDEMIC OF HUGGING begins. This
spills out onto the streets later, but for now, let's
restrict this to the people who've been watching the match
together.
CUT TO:
The Springboks say a prayer on the field. Pienaar kneels in
the middle, leading the prayer.
Behind them, a WORK CREW ASSEMBLES A PORTABLE PODIUM.
At "Amen", Pienaar's men lift him to his feet, then onto
their shoulders.
141.
The crowd roars again and again as PIENAAR TAKES A VICTORY
LAP on the shoulders of the men he has led through thick and
thin.
Tears stream down his face, through his unstoppable grin.
As they near the podium, the team is intercepted by a news
crew and --
-- none other then BOLAND BOTHA.
BOLAND BOTHA
Francois ... a few words ...
The interview booms through the PA system. Pienaar just nods
-- he isn't about to spoil the moment by reacting to this
buffoon.
BOLAND BOTHA
... great game, but I don't think
you could've done it without the
amazing support of these 63,000
South Africans --
Francois grabs the mike from Boland.
PIENAAR
(into mike, words booming)
We didn't have the support of
63,000 South Africans today. We
had the support of 42 million South
Africans.
The crowd roars.
The Springbok manager grabs Pienaar's shoulder, points.
SPRINGBOK MANAGER
They're waiting for you over there.
Pienaar turns, looks.
Mandela waits at the podium, eyes alight with joy.
In front of him is the WILLIAM WEBB ELLIS TROPHY, a big gold
confection.
Their eyes meet.
Their eyes stay locked as Pienaar fights his way through the
press, the officials, his own team, to the podium.
142.
Mandela holds out his hand. Pienaar takes it. Big hands,
one black, one white, one with bruises visible, one with a
lifetime of bruises implied.
Both wearing the NUMBER 6 SPRINGBOK JERSEY.
MANDELA
Francois, I want to thank you most
sincerely for what you have done to
our country.
Pienaar shakes his head.
PIENAAR
Mr. President, I want to thank you
for what you have done.
Eyes lock again, for just a moment, blue eyes, brown eyes --
African eyes, both.
And then PIENAAR RAISES THE TROPHY HIGH. A very traditional
sports hero's moment, richly deserved.
Real gold, against the green of the battered field.
But that is not the real prize.
The prize is what happens next, all over the nation.
DISSOLVE TO:
ALL OVER SOUTH AFRICA, people spill out into the streets, to
celebrate.
Utter joy, everywhere, as black and white, servants and
employers, strangers, enemies, foreigners are swept up in
love and happiness.
People who have been suspicious of each other, hated each
other, feared each other all their lives ... they hug each
other on this day.
DISSOLVE TO:
Housewives, gardeners, cops, kids dance in the middle of the
street.
A car horn beeps politely.
BMW, Mercedes, BMW come slowly down the street.
143.
The crowd begins to dance and ululate as they part to let the
convoy through.
The convoy switches to another street --
-- which is just as crowded as the first, with happy South
Africans.
It is as if every single person in the Rainbow Nation wants
to celebrate together.
The convoy switches to yet another street --
-- to no avail. South Africa is literally dancing in the
streets.
