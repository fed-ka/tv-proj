      PUSH IN on a car s wiper blade. Underneath it, a half-dozen 
      parking tickets. We drift past the tickets, coming around to 
      the driver s-side window, where we find an orange  FINAL 
      VIOLATION  sticker, that reads:  This car will be towed.  

      A tow truck hooks to the car, lifting it up.

      From inside the car, we see the TOW TRUCK OPERATOR get back 
      into his cab. CAMERA DRIFTS DOWN, past the dash, to reveal...

    A MAN S BODY slumped over, head-down in the front passenger 
      footwell.

      His head is encased in a plastic bag, wrapped with duct tape 
      at the neck. The body jerks up, as the car is pulled by the 
      tow truck out into traffic.

                    So what now?

                                    BECKETT
                    This witness of theirs is the key. 
                    Without knowing who he is or who's 
                    after him, there's no way to take 
                    the next step.

                                  CASTLE
                    There may be another way to find 
                    out who their witness is.

                                    BECKETT
                    Yeah? How?

                    So?

                                  CASTLE
                    So, what if we ask the other side?

                                    BECKETT
                    What, you want to ask the mob who 
                    the witness is?

                                  CASTLE
                    Well, clearly they know who he is 
                    if they re trying to kill him. Like 
                    you said, he s gotta be a 
                      significant witness in a big case.

                                    BECKETT

                                  CASTLE
                    I m just saying, maybe he knows 
                      something. Maybe he can tell me 
                    what the Feds won't.

      Off Beckett s look, we...

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Beckett leans against a car outside an office building, 
      holding a brown bag and a coffee. She watches as WILL 
      SORENSON comes out of the building and approaches the car. 

                                  SORENSON
                    Well this is a nice surprise. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Hopefully this will be, too. 

      She hands him the brown bag. He looks inside. 

                                  SORENSON
                    Am I really that predictable? 

      He pulls out a rainbow sprinkle doughnut and smiles. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Maybe I just know you too well. 
                    After all, we were an item once. 
                    You might want to eat it before 
                    anyone sees. Might ruin your FBI 
                    street cred. 

                                  SORENSON
                    Yeah, I d never hear the end of it. 

      He starts to split the doughnut in half. 

                                    BECKETT
                    No, you eat it. I m not really into 
                    sprinkles anymore... 

      He looks disappointed. 

                                  SORENSON
                    Right. So you re buttering me up, 
                    or should I say  sugaring me up ? 
                    Is this the part where you ask me 
                    to bend the rules to help you on 
                    your case?

                                    BECKETT

                    To talk to Jimmy Moran. 

                                  SORENSON
                    Jimmy Moran? The mobster?
                          (off her look:  yeah )
                    What makes you think I can help 
                    with that?

                                    BECKETT
                    Because the FBI and the U.S. 
                      Attorney s Office have him in 
                    Witness Protection.

                                  SORENSON
                    And you know this how? 

                                    BECKETT
                    Word on the street.

      Sorenson sighs.

                                  SORENSON
                    Look, even if it s true, I don t 
                    work organized crime cases.

                                    BECKETT
                    No. But we both know how this 
                    works. You reach out to the agent 
                    in charge, he talks to the AUSA 
                    running the case, and I get to talk 
                    to Jimmy Moran.

                                  SORENSON
                          (smiles, shakes his head)
                    And I do this for you, why? 

                                    BECKETT
                    Let me put it another way: the 
                    Spolanos know that Jimmy Moran s 
                      cooperating with the government. We 
                    know they want him dead, because 
                    they murdered the surgeon you Feds 
                    hired to change his face. 
                          (off Sorenson)
                    You guys put this doctor in harm s 
                    way. Which means you re gonna do it 
                    for him, not me.
