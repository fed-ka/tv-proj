Dawn with her rose-red fingers rises over a dusty country
road. A car chugs over the horizon.
NARRATOR
As far as con man stories go,
I think I've heard them all.
Of grifters, ropers, faro fixers,
tales drawn long and tall.
But if one bears a bookmark in
the confidence man's tome,
twould be that of Penelope,
and of the brothers Bloom.

The car deposits two shabby boys (10 & 13) in front of a
country house.
Both in black.
Each with a suitcase.
NARRATOR
At ten and thirteen Bloom and
Stephen (the younger and the old)
3
5
The brothers on the porch, suitcases in hand.
NARRATOR
For Bloom had Stephen, Stephen
Bloom, and both had more than most.
The front door opens, and a pair of FOSTER PARENTS eye the
brothers suspiciously.
6
6
A wide dusty Main Street, which the two brothers survey.
NARRATOR
Another home, another main street.
Stephen looked around,
then summed the burgh up thusly:
STEPHEN
Bloom, we've hit a one hat town.
NARRATOR
One theater. One car wash. One
cafe. One park. One cat. Which,
through some mishap, had one leg.
The cat sits on a roller skate, rowing itself down the street
with its one leg.
STEPHEN
Sweet Jesus. Look at that.
7
7
A group of children flee the school joyfully.
NARRATOR
One school, which meant one tight-
knit group of local well-off kids.

The children run out of the candy store, all slurping Rocket
Pops.
NARRATOR
Their pocket-change bought rocket
pops,
9
10
The children play, resplendent with their Rocket Pops.
NARRATOR
They were the `they'. All well
loved, rooted, happy as you please.
Bloom and Stephen sit off to the side of the park, none too
happy nursing their Pixie Stix.
NARRATOR (cont'd)
Always there. In every town.
Stephen glares, flicks the Stix away like a cigarette.
STEPHEN
The playground bourgeoisies.
He storms off.
Bloom lingers, staring silently at the
children.

11
11
The brothers amble down a wooded path.
Bloom stops, staring
into the trees.
Through the dense thicket of foliage... the children playing.
And one gleaming eye framed perfectly through a small open
patch in the leaves.
Bloom pushes the leaves aside. A girl. Golden curls.
Summer dress. Standing in the distance on a wide lawn.
Bloom gazes.
Stephen places his hand on Bloom's back.
12
12
Bloom stumbles from the trees (very much as if he's been
shoved) and regains his footing and freezes, not shielded at
all now from the playing kids and the girl.
NARRATOR
Could he simply
STEPHEN (O.S.)
Talk to her!
NARRATOR
Just drop his fears and go? Leave
his brother in the woods, and join
the children?
The girl makes eye contact, twisting a daisy chain between
her tiny fingers. Bloom's adam apple convulses.
He turns tail and runs back into the woods.
NARRATOR (cont'd)
No.
13
14
STEPHEN
A plan.
Stephen spreads out a hand-drawn flowchart on a stump, and
talks Bloom through it.
NARRATOR
A fiction made for profit, in which
both boys played a part.
A simple con in fifteen steps.
STEPHEN
And this is where we start.
Stephen runs his finger backwards down the connected boxes,
each neatly numbered, stopping at #1.... "Bloom Talks To
Girl"
15
15
Children and the gold haired Girl playing.
The wall of
foliage where the forest begins shimmers.
NARRATOR
And then, as if a curtain had been
pulled back from the sky...
Some barrier within the younger
Bloom was broken.
Bloom bursts through the trees and strides across the wide
lawn, confident, glowing, stopping face to golden face with
the girl.

15
CONTINUED:
15
BLOOM
Hi.
They talk.
They run.
They laugh.
They play.
NARRATOR
So Bloom performed his role in
Stephen's story to a T.
BOX #2 on the flowchart - "Bloom wins the kids' trust"
16
16
Bloom does indeed, sitting and laughing with a circle of
kids, suddenly a natural born charmer.
NARRATOR
And being who he wasn't, could be
as he wished to be.
The Golden Girl smiles at him.
From the shadows of an adjacent alley, Stephen watches,
pleased. He slinks away.
SERIES OF SHOTS-
17
17
BOX #3 - "Stephen finds a cave" dissolves to Stephen scouting
out a cave deep in the woods.
18
18
In the park, Bloom runs with the kids, laughing.
19
20
Back in the park, Bloom says goodnight to the kids and walks
homeward in the warm twilight.
7
21
23
Bloom holds court with the kids.
BLOOM
hermit in the woods. A one eyed,
steel toothed vagabond...
24
25
BLOOM
...and told me of a cave.
GIRL
What kind of cave?
BLOOM
A cave of wonders.
BOY
Pffft ha.
GIRL
Shut up, Dave.
BLOOM
At noon on every Sunday, there
appears a ball of light, which
flutters like a butterfly...
GIRL
A will-o-whisp?
BLOOM
That's right. It guides you
9
26
27
BLOOM
...to where the treasures lay.
BOY
So where's this cave?
GIRL
Yeah, where?
28
29
The girl's bright, trusting face looking at him. A moment of
silence. Then, triumphant, an excited boy leaps to his feet.
EXCITED BOY
Well that's just two bucks each!
The kids all rejoice, and fist-fulls of dollars are thrust at
Bloom. He looks almost crestfallen as his eye catches the
girl's joyful gaze.
NARRATOR
So Sunday came...
30
30
Children in their bright Sunday clothes run through the dark
woods, led by Bloom.
10
30
CONTINUED:
30
NARRATOR
...and straight from church, into
the woods Bloom led.
31
32
The children look at the craggy mouth of a forboding cave.
GIRL
Just like the hermit said!
Deep in the cave's dark maw, a spark of light.
The children gasp collectively.
The Girl grabs Bloom's arm.
Bloom stares, transfixed as any of them.
The spark becomes a glowing, fluttering point of light, which
hangs in the mouth of the cave for a tantalizing moment, then
recedes deeper into the gloom.
With a cry the children, Bloom included, dash into the cave.
33
34
NARRATOR
They didn't catch the will-o-wisp,
but didn't really care.
The muddied children walk home, laughing, while Bloom leans
against a lamppost. Stephen appears behind him, counting
their money.
STEPHEN
It seems to me that in the end, the
perfect con is where
each one involved gets just the
thing they wanted.
BLOOM
Yeah I guess so.
NARRATOR
Our fledgling thieves were
satisfied.
12
35
35
A front door opens, revealing a porch-full of 30 angry
parents holding 15 muddied kids by their ears.
NARRATOR
The children's parents, less so.
The Foster Parents exchange a glance.
QUICK SHOTS -
Stephen is smacked.
The wad of money is snatched from a grubby small hand by an
angry big one.
A telephone slams down.
On a form, the field "Reason for return:" is filled with
"Larceny."
36
37
Through a storefront window - rows of the children's muddy
Sunday clothes hang, each tagged.
NARRATOR
`O'Henry's' was the town's one dry
clean shop.
And striding out of the store beneath the `O'Henry's
Cleaners' sign is Stephen, fifty dollars in hand, sucking a
Rocket Pop. The OWNER leans out of the door, looking a
little nervous. Stephen throws him back a salute.
38
38
Bloom sits against a wall, suitcases beside him. Boxes of
Rocket Pops, and one in each fist. Stephen plops down beside
him.
STEPHEN
So how's it feel?
Bloom's eye catches the children, and the girl, playing in
the distance.
NARRATOR
In truth, young Bloom won't know
for twenty years just how he felt.
HONK! A `Child Welfare' car waiting out on the street.
The
brothers pick themselves up.
NARRATOR (cont'd)
And so, we'll skip ahead now in our
story.
Stephen tosses his Rocket Pop.
STEPHEN
Let `em melt.
The con man team of the brothers Bloom, suitcases in hand,
strides down the alleyway.
Stephen in front.

Bloom a few steps behind, stealing one last glance back at
the children playing in the sun.

OPENING CREDITS

CUT TO:
40
41
A stately house in the middle of nowhere, on fire. Stephen
holds the door of a car open, while Bloom steps from the
flaming house.
STEPHEN
"Four months and a thousand years
ago." That's Kipling, isn't it?
He stole that from Kipling.
BLOOM
No.
42
42
Hazy light over the sprawling city.
43
47
Bloom stumbles up stone steps to street level.
A THOUSAND
YEAR OLD MAN sweeps up across the square.
Bloom sits wearily on the curb, bowler hat in hand, shirt
bright red with fake blood, face long as hell.
Putting the broom aside a moment, the old man walks painfully
across the street to Bloom. Standing nearly toe to toe with
him, the man pulls a huge joyful smile across his grizzled
face.
He then smears his hand over his mug, pulling the smile off
his face and rubbing it on Bloom's mouth. When he takes his
hand away, Bloom plays along and has the same big joyful
smile. The old man winks at him and walks back to his broom.
As soon as the old man is away, Bloom drops the smile.
Stephen paces out into the street.
STEPHEN
We missed the sunrise.
That
would've been nice.
They walk across the street to the Tiergarten.
48
48
Berlin's Central Park and zoo, dead and brown. The brothers
stroll through the woods, Stephen a few steps ahead, Bloom
trailing behind, lost in thought.
Camel heads poke over a wall with `Kamelhaus' painted on it.
Stephen throws open the wall's gate.
STEPHEN
(to camels)
Back to the swamps!
The camels are unimpressed.
Bloom slouches into a bench.
23
48
CONTINUED:
48
Stephen shows the deck of cards to Bloom, who nods. Stephen
cuts the deck, shows him a card. Bloom shakes his head, no.
STEPHEN (cont'd)
At least you're honest.
Bloom stares into space.
STEPHEN (cont'd)
Alright, let's do this. Let's just
get it done. So first you say `I'm
quitting, Stephen. I'm out.' Then
I say...
BLOOM
`Do we have to go through this
again.'
STEPHEN
Then you make a show of putting on
your jacket and say `no I mean it
this time Stephen, this time I'm
really out.'
BLOOM
Then you say `let's have a drink,
and in the morning Bloom you'll
have come to your senses'
Stephen pulls a flask, unscrews it.
STEPHEN
(re: Bloom's bright red
blood stain)
That's a major design flaw in fake
blood, by the way.
BLOOM
`and we'll be moving on.'
STEPHEN
Real blood turns brown after a half
hour.
BLOOM
Listen to me, Stephen.
STEPHEN
This scotch costs more than your
suit.
24
26/11/06.
48
CONTINUED: (2)
48
BLOOM
Listen to me.
STEPHEN
And the flask stopped a bullet from
a black powder rifle at Appomattox.
BLOOM
Listen.
Bloom bats the flask away. A camel catches it, tips its
camel neck back and gulps it down.
STEPHEN
That's my new favorite camel.
BLOOM
I hate you. I hate this life, I
hate it, I hate that you won't
fucking listen to me for one
goddamn second. Just listen.
Stephen listens.
BLOOM (cont'd)
I can't wake up next to another
stranger, who thinks they know me,
or even wants to know me, cause I
don't know - who - I'm thirty five
years old, and I, I'm useless, I'm
crippled, I don't, I've only ever
lived life through these roles that
aren't me, that are written for me
by you.
STEPHEN
Tell me what you want.
BLOOM
Why? So you can write me a role in
a story where I get it? You're not
listening to me. I want a real...
thing, I wanna do things how I
don't know are gonna work out, a,
I, want, a...
STEPHEN
(sotto)
You want an unwritten life.

48
CONTINUED: (3)
48
BLOOM
I want an unwritten life!
(realizes Stephen just
wrote that line for him)
Aauuugghh god!
The camel belches.
Bloom makes a show of putting on his
jacket.
BLOOM (cont'd)
I'm going away. Somewhere you or
even the Chink won't be able to
track me down, so don't try. No
more stories.
Bloom tosses Stephen the bowler, and storms off.
He gets
about ten feet, then hesitates.
BLOOM (cont'd)
I love you. Bye.
Then goes.
The camel nudges Stephen's jacket, looking for more scotch.
Stephen puts the bowler on its camel head.
STEPHEN
Sorry bud.
I'm dry.
Stephen watches his brother walk off into the rising morning
mist, lost in thought.
His hands mechanically begin shuffling the pack of cards.
FADE OUT
FADE IN:
49
49
Beautiful green hills surround the walled medieval city of
Ferentino.
TITLE CARD:
Ferentino, Italy - 3 months later.
A tiny red car inches its way across the countryside. It
winds its way up and deeper into the city on the hill.
26
50
50
The tiny stone porch outside a private apartment.
The red
car's bumper pulls up, parks.
On a small wood table, empty booze bottles and a loose pack
of cards. Fingertips spread the cards, then the fingertips'
owner heads for the apartment door.
51
52
Stephen guides a dressed Bloom out the door. The grandmother
follows them, still barking angry Italian at Bloom. At the
last moment she says a few kind words, kisses him on the
cheek and sends them off.
53
53
A few tables on a stone walkway overlooking the countryside.
The red car parked nearby. Stephen eats, Bloom stares.
BLOOM
How'd you find me?
27
53
CONTINUED:
53
STEPHEN
The Chink.
BLOOM
How'd the Chink find me?
Stephen's eyes:
"Are you joking?"
STEPHEN
How've you been?
BLOOM
Great.
STEPHEN
I've done a lot of thinking the
past three months. You don't want
out. You think you do but you
don't. Here, c'mere. I want to
show you something.
BLOOM
I'm quits, Stephen.
Stephen stands, strolls off.
Bloom wearily follows.
BLOOM (cont'd)
Where are we going?
STEPHEN
New Jersey.
BLOOM
(sighs)
Well lemme get my jacket.
CUT TO:
54
54
CUT TO:
55
55
A long private road through a tunnel of trees leads to a
ludicrous mansion. Our trio watch it from the road.
BLOOM
Looks like an etching from a Bronte
novel.
28
55
CONTINUED:
55
Stephen flips open a first edition Jane Eyre. The
illustration inside is in fact an exact match, right down to
a plaster deer in the front yard.
BLOOM (cont'd)
Huh. Look at that. Well thanks.
I'm gonna head back to Italy.
STEPHEN
Big money. Inheritance. Dad died
early, Mom died two years ago after
ten years fighting an illness that
I can't pronounce.
BLOOM
How much?
The Chink writes a number in the snow with a stick. Just
when we think she's done, she adds several more zeros.
BLOOM (cont'd)
Jesus.
STEPHEN
Look out.
Stephen pulls Bloom into the trees as a cherry red
Lamborghini roars down the private road, does an unruly donut
and crunches painfully into a tree, kicking up a cloud of
dust and smoke.
Thumping bass from the audio system turns off, and from the
dust cloud emerges PENELOPE, early 30s, beautiful but in a
non-Lamborghini way.
Bloom watches her through the trees, none too happy.
56
56
Off to the side of the house. They lean on the hood of their
rental car, an old school Cadillac.
In the background, a tow truck arrives with a brand new
Lamborghini, and leaves towing the old one.
BLOOM
What am I doing here, Stephen? I
have one rule, and you've never
even tested it.
29
56
CONTINUED:
56
STEPHEN
Stick with me.
BLOOM
No women. One rule. You know we
don't do women, I don't, and it's
not a morality thing or- a thing-
it's, whatever it is it doesn't
matter what it is, that's just our
rule. So what are we,
(RE: the rental car)
Did you rent a `78 Caddy?
Stephen nods to the Chink.
Bloom nods appreciatively.
BLOOM (cont'd)
Controversial choice. So no, is
what I'm saying. I'm quits anyway.
I'll be in Italy. Drinking.
The front door of the mansion slams, and they watch Penelope
drag a harp around into the back yard.
STEPHEN
Penelope Stamp. Thirty three.
Lived at home her whole life.
Bloom's eyes never leave Penelope.
BLOOM
An eccentric shut-in rich bitch.
You're not helping your case.
The Chink silently hands Bloom a retractable spyglass, he
watches Penelope drift atop a hill and sit on a stump.
STEPHEN
She's bored, a seed in the snow.
We're going to put her through a
grand adventure, bring her to life.
BLOOM
So this is the big plan. Lure me
back into things with some
beautiful intriguing elusive girl,
stir up old memories with the
prospect of redemption and rebirth.
Seriously Stephen. Amateur night.
Bloom watches her play Clash songs on the harp.
30
56
CONTINUED: (2)
56
BLOOM (cont'd)
I'm not saying yes. But what's the
con?
Stephen spreads a folded piece of paper on a tree stump, with
a flowchart on it. Numbered boxes.
Bloom doesn't take his spyglass off Penelope.
STEPHEN
It's actually pretty simple. We're
brothers, antique dealers, perusing
the Americas for antiquities en
route to someplace exciting via
luxury steamer, say Greece. You
tie into her and work your magic...
Penelope plays on.
57
58
A grumpy Bloom perched on the red Schwinn, an ill fitting
Styrofoam helmet on his head.
Stephen sits in a lawn chair watching the highway below.
The Chink sets up a lawn umbrella, a chair for herself, and a
cooler with Coronas.
BLOOM
There are less painful ways to cut
into a mark.
STEPHEN
Wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk.
Score to beat is 7.9. Keep your
head in the game, the Chinese judge
is tough.
BLOOM
This is a banana seat, man!
He directs this to the Chink, who blinks with innocent
incomprehension and opens two Coronas.
BLOOM (cont'd)
Don't give me that blank look, you
know what a fuckin banana seat is.
32
58
CONTINUED:
58
Stephen spots something and blows a whistle.
With a grunt,
Bloom launches the Schwinn forward.
Gaining speed, bumping over weeds and gopher holes, down the
steep steep hill.
At the bottom of the hill, a two lane highway.
Cruising down
the highway, a cherry red Lamborghini.
Whose front right fender Bloom expertly smashes into.
CUT TO:
59
59
Silent and blue. Time slows to a crawl as Bloom sails
through the air, arcing over the Italian luxury car's hood
and past a horrified Penelope, face frozen mid scream behind
the wheel.
BLOOM (V.O.)
There's actually a knack to this.
You want to avoid dying or breaking
anything that won't grow back, but
you don't want to roll out of it
and come up roses. If you're
trying to fast track into a mark's
sympathies, there's nothing quite
as efficient as having your first
conversation be from a hospital bed
they put you in. I usually like to
try for a dislocated shoulder.
Several things happen at once.
Bloom hits the pavement shoulder-first, hard.
The bent bike
follows suit.
Up on the hill, Stephen and the Chink raise score cards.
8.9
and 5.6.
The Lamborghini screeches to a stop.
Everything is still.
Then the car jolts forward. Then stops. Then again, jolts
and stops. Rolls forward a few feet, lazily drifting, then
jolts and stops.
Bloom painfully stands, as confused by the car's behavior as
us.
33
59
CONTINUED:
59
Stephen and the Chink lower their cards, equally confused.
One last long beat of silence, then the car jolts forward,
veers drunkenly to the left, tips into a ditch and chunks to
a stop. The horn blares.
Bloom looks up to the hilltop for guidance.
Stephen stares blankly.
The Chink raises a new score card -
7.8.
60
64
They pull up in the car.
A tow truck is dropping off a new
Lamborghini.
BLOOM (V.O.)
Get invited in for coffee, and tell
them the full tale.
Bloom looks about to launch into something, when Penelope
drops a stack of cash bound in a green rubber band on his
dashboard.
PENELOPE
For the bike, and the whole, thing.
This was a big shit sandwich. Ok.
Bye.
The car door slams and she's gone.
Bloom sits a moment.
BLOOM (V.O.)
However, there are advantages to
playing it cool. Letting it lie
for a day or two, then casually re-
establish contact.
Bloom starts driving off, and adjusts the passenger side
mirror so it points back to the road. As he does he sees
Penelope in it, sprinting after his car.
He stops.
A moment later she appears at his window, heaving.
36
64
CONTINUED:
64
PENELOPE
I realized... I should have...
invited you in... for coffee...
right?
65
67
Bloom and Penelope walk and talk, finally rounding the house
and ending up at the driveway.
BLOOM
Well, I should, uh, it's late. So.
I meet a lot of people in my job I
have to professionally act
interested in. It's a good feeling
to be genuinely interested in
someone.
PENELOPE
Are you leaving?
BLOOM
Yeah.
40
67
CONTINUED:
67
PENELOPE
Are you coming back?
BLOOM
Well next time I'm in town. We're
taking a steamer at noon tomorrow
off the docks, to the continent for
a few months.
During this, Bloom very naturally moves his hand to the small
of Penelope's back. The edge of his thumb comes to rest on a
small slit of exposed skin.
Penelope's expression does not change, but a noticeable blush
crosses her still face.
When Bloom removes his hand, the blush falls.
BLOOM (cont'd)
Paris and Greece, I think. I've
gotta get a hat. Thanks for the
pinhole camera demonstration. And
for the good conversation. Goodbye
Penelope.
PENELOPE
Goodbye Bloom.
He drives off.
She stands in the doorway, watching him go.
68
68
A jaunty steamer ship docked and ready. Bloom watches the
access road, Stephen makes notes, the Chink whittles.
BLOOM
I need another day with her.
STEPHEN
You'll have two weeks on the boat.
BLOOM
I need another day to get her on
the boat, she isn't hooked. That
bit I skipped where we were talking
in the backyard, it was ten minutes
on the optics of lensless
photography, we didn't really talk.
41
68
CONTINUED:
68
STEPHEN
It isn't the talking that hooked
her.
Bloom turns from the road.
BLOOM
I think you're wrong.
A screech of distant tires and a crash.
Bloom doesn't look.
BLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Though every time I say that, you
end up being comically right.
That's her, isn't it? Yeah.
Penelope pulls a clumsy steamer trunk that never could have
fit in her Lamborghini, which is bent around a pylon.
Bloom meets her.
PENELOPE
Hey.
BLOOM
Hi.
What are you doing here?
She holds out the stack of bills in the green rubber band.
PENELOPE
You left this money in my kitchen.
He doesn't take it.
BLOOM
Yeah, I didn't want it, but thanks.
PENELOPE
Oh.
(beat)
Hey, where's this boat going?
69
69
The good ship Fidele breaks the waves Greece-ward.
70
70
Bloom and Penelope stroll the deck.
42
70
CONTINUED:
70
BLOOM
Why did you decide to come?
PENELOPE
Well I'd never been to Greece. Or
Europe. Or outside New Jersey.
BLOOM
It just seems like a big leap.
From where you were at yesterday to
being a world traveler.
PENELOPE
It looked like fun.
I wanted to do
it.
BLOOM
A new hobby.
Up ahead, Bloom spots a large man in a fur collared cape
gazing out to sea. He quickly turns Penelope away.
BLOOM (cont'd)
Here, this way.
71
71
The Chink and Stephen play shuffleboard.
Bloom leads
Penelope to them.
BLOOM
Penelope, this is my brother
Stephen.
STEPHEN
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
Bloom's told me about you, you're
the epileptic photographer?
PENELOPE
Sort of.
STEPHEN
This is my personal secretary and
masseuse, Mrs. Yuengling.
A nearly imperceptible glare from the Chink.
PENELOPE
Yuengling like the beer?
43
71
CONTINUED:
71
STEPHEN
Heh. No. So what are your plans
in Greece?
PENELOPE
I don't plan.
STEPHEN
Good for you.
The Chink hits a damn near impossible shuffleboard shot, then
gives Stephen a pointed deferential giggle-bow.
72
73
Several small tables scattered about the moonlit deck, Bloom
and Penelope sit with flutes of champagne. Penelope, in an
elegant but understated dress, shuffles a pack of cards.
BLOOM
You look very nice.
She laughs as if at a joke she doesn't think is funny.
44
73
CONTINUED:
73
BLOOM (cont'd)
What was your childhood like?
PENELOPE
I make cameras out of watermelons.
BLOOM
Lonely.
PENELOPE
Lucky guess.
Penelope's hands move faster.
She knows how to shuffle
cards.
BLOOM
How was it lonely?
PENELOPE
Fishing for an entertaining
childhood anecdote that
encapsulates my adult issues?
BLOOM
Well it's funny how everyone's
usually got one.
As Penelope tells her story she gets fancier with her
shuffles.
PENELOPE
When I turned six I started getting
allergies, hayfever, rashes, really
bad. So my mom took me into the
doctor, and he did that test where
they use needles to prick a grid on
your back with all the different
toxins, to see which ones you're
allergic to. The next day I came
in, the doctor lifted up my shirt,
and my back looked like a patch of
oily, moldy, blackish green double-
puff marshmallows. I was allergic
to everything. So they sealed the
house with plastic and a special
ventilation system, and I spent my
entire childhood and adolescence
indoors. Mostly alone. Lonely.
She pulls the Queens out of the deck and lays them face up on
the table.
45
73
CONTINUED: (2)
73
BLOOM
Wow.
PENELOPE
It wasn't `til I was nineteen they
discovered what I was actually
allergic to was the aluminum alloy
the hypodermic needle was made out
of. Then I was going to leave, but
my mom got sick. So I stayed. And
she stayed sick, a long time.
BLOOM
Do you feel cheated?
Penelope does an amazing card trick using the four queens.
PENELOPE
The trick to not feeling cheated is
to learn how to cheat. So I
decided this wasn't a story about a
miserable girl trapped in a house
that smelled like medical supplies
wasting her life on a dying person
she sometimes hated. It was about
a girl who could find infinite
beauty in anything, any little
thing. And do anything she decided
to do. And love the person she was
trapped with. So I told myself
that story until it became true.
Now did doing that let me escape a
wasted life, or did it just blind
me so I wouldn't want to escape it?
I don't know. But either way, I
was the one telling my own story.
So I don't feel cheated.
She finishes the trick.
A single pair of hands clapping turns their heads. At the
far end of the deck, alone at a table, the large man in the
fur collared cape, who for reasons unlikely to become clear
at the moment will be called THE CURATOR.
THE CURATOR
And a magician is just an actor
playing the part of a magician.
My
compliments.
Bloom takes Penelope gently by the elbow and guides her up
and away.
46
74
74
They stroll out onto the moonlit bow of the ship.
PENELOPE
Who is that man? You avoided him
earlier on the deck.
BLOOM
I don't know, but he's carrying a
knife up his sleeve and wearing a
cape. Do me a favor and steer
clear of him.
A waltz drifts through the air from a band unseen.
BLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd)
I don't suppose in all your hobby
acquiring you ever learned how to
dance?
PENELOPE
I went through a phase when I was
mildly obsessed with the Bolero.
BLOOM
Give me a minute.
He leaves her alone. Clouds obscure the moon, shadows
deepen. She shivers.
A match strikes.
She jumps.
The moon re-emerges, and she is no longer alone on the deck.
The Curator lights a dapper briar pipe, shakes out the match.
THE CURATOR
Mademoiselle.
PENELOPE
Monsieur.
THE CURATOR
(in French, subtitled)
I didn't mean to startle you.
PENELOPE
(in French, subtitled)
Yes you did.
47
74
CONTINUED:
74
THE CURATOR
(in French, subtitled)
Apologies, but the deck was dark,
and I had to approach.
(English)
It's been such a time since I've
encountered the Brothers Bloom.
PENELOPE
You're in antiques?
THE CURATOR
(Cheshire grin)
Antiques. I wonder, my dear, if
you know the true nature of the men
you travel with?
The band strikes up a Bolero. The Curator flicks his wrist,
and a long thin blade falls into his hand.
THE CURATOR (cont'd)
A little fear might suit you, I
think.
He raises the blade... it is in fact a fine mustache brush,
which he delicately employs.
THE CURATOR (cont'd)
Bon soir, ma cherie.
With that the Curator backs into the shadows, and is gone.
Moments later Bloom trots up to her, oblivious.
BLOOM
It isn't a Spanish band, but
they'll do their best.
He hands her a single blood red rose. She puts it in her
teeth, and they dance. If there is a tinge of tension in the
air, the Bolero suits it.
The moon ducks behind a cloud once more, and they dance on in
the dark.
75
76
The Chink and Penelope lie on their stomachs on the deck, a
beer can pinhole camera between them.
Penelope gives a lesson on how it works.
The Chink appreciates her.
77
77
Bloom escorts Penelope to breakfast.
PENELOPE
How'd you find her?
BLOOM
The Chi-nese, uh, Yeungling?
She
found us.
78
79
PENELOPE
I like her.
BLOOM
Good.
They smile when they see Stephen and the Chink at a table.
Their smiles drop when they see the Curator sitting with
them. Bloom glares at the Curator, but speaks to Stephen.
BLOOM (cont'd)
What's he doing here?
STEPHEN
I invited him, sit down. This
ship's too small to dance around
each other for a week, we might as
well have it out now. Bloom. Sit.
Penelope, do you know our friend?
PENELOPE
Only as the creepy Frenchman.
THE CURATOR
Book-learned. You know languages
but not accents, my dear. I am
Belgian. Maxmillion Melville, at
your service.
BLOOM
Also known in certain professional
circles as the Curator.
PENELOPE
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
What do you do?
THE CURATOR
I'm a curator, presently for the
National Museum in Prague. And
yourself?
PENELOPE
I'm an epileptic photographer.
THE CURATOR
Good for you. Boys? What do you
do?
50
79
CONTINUED:
79
STEPHEN
We have a legitimate antique
reselling business.
THE CURATOR
Baissez le rideau, la farce est
jouee.
STEPHEN
We've gone straight, Max.
THE CURATOR
Pardon, but you do not ascend to
the grand heights of the Brothers
Bloom only to toss it all and sell
terra cotta to blue haired weekend
antiquers.
STEPHEN
We did.
Eat your waffles.
THE CURATOR
But Mademoiselle appears...
confused. Perhaps she is unawares?
BLOOM
Eat your waffles, fat man.
THE CURATOR
Unaware that the Brothers Bloom are
in fact the two most highly
respected art smugglers in the
western world?
STEPHEN
Were. We've been on the straight
for three years. So that's that.
THE CURATOR
Well, if that is that, then that is
indeed that. As you say.
Penelope snaps her fingers.
Everyone looks up.
PENELOPE
Your name's Melville?
THE CURATOR
Maxmillion Melville, Esquire.
51
79
CONTINUED: (2)
79
PENELOPE
Sorry, no, cause I noticed but I
couldn't place it, this ship is the
Fidele, which was the ship in
Melville's novel "The Confidence
Man." So that's weird.
Everyone glances at Stephen, a little uncomfortable.
STEPHEN
Huh.
80
81
The Chink sits smoking her whittled pipe, watching Bloom
alone on the deck. Stephen passes her, and she stops him
with a look.
STEPHEN
Shut up.
I know what I'm doing.
She hands him a thin piece of paper.
He looks it over.
STEPHEN (cont'd)
This came through just now?
The paper is a telegram with the Fidele's imprint, received
from St. Petersburg. Stephen reads it.
53
81
CONTINUED:
81
STEPHEN (cont'd)
"My dear Stephen STOP Word on the
wire is the Bros B are bound for
Prague STOP Am heading there myself
would love to see my boys STOP
Affectionately DD." The Diamond
Dog.
He crumples the paper, looks down at Bloom.
STEPHEN (cont'd)
Wire him back for me. "Dear Dog
STOP Unless you've lately felt an
excess of eyes left in your head
kindly stay the fuck away from me
and my brother STOP Regards,"
etcetera.
82
82
The good ship Fidele rounds the Rock of Gibraltar.
83
83
Bloom and Penelope lie on the deck, watching dolphins.
She says this word like she's eating chocolate:
PENELOPE
Smugglers. It's like an adventure
story. Whose idea was it to go
straight?
BLOOM
Mine. Stephen always loved the
life. Then he was almost killed on
a run to Jakarta, two thugs with
heads like canned hams worked him
beyond all reason.
84
84
Stephen is set upon by two thugs.
He rushes them.
STEPHEN
Have at thee, you ham headed
bastards!
54
26/11/06.
85
85
BLOOM
And I called it, that was it.
PENELOPE
Scary.
BLOOM
For me. Stephen enjoyed it. He
loved the idea that we were
internationally infamous art
smugglers, but I think deep down,
same as me, he felt like we were
putting on a persona, faking it.
PENELOPE
Telling a story.
BLOOM
He'd love to die on a job.
Cornered at midnight on a run to
Jakarta. That's his dream, to tell
his story so well it fulfills
itself. It somehow would make it
finally real for him.
PENELOPE
That's kinda the thing we all want,
right?
He looks at her in the sun.
BLOOM
Trying to get something real by
telling yourself stories is a trap.
Trust me on that one.
86
86
Kalamata, if it matters.
The Fidele docked in bright blue water. Our intrepid heroes
stand aside a dusty road, surrounded by their luggage.
The Curator approaches, tips his hat to them.
THE CURATOR
Best of luck with the antiquing,
boys. Au revoir, Chinois.

THE CURATOR (cont'd)
(to Penelope)
Mademoiselle. Mes restes d'offre.
With a wink, he is gone.
A beat.
Penelope stands apart.
BLOOM
My French is a little rusty, but I
believe he just told you `my offer
stands.'
PENELOPE
He came out of nowhere last night.
87
87
Penelope taking air on the moonlit deck.
The Curator
dissolves out of the darkness.
PENELOPE (V.O.)
Whatever's in his pipe, it made me
thick.
He brings her face close to hers, smoke twisting, and speaks
unheard words low and fast.
88
88
BLOOM
Oh lord.
What has he got?
PENELOPE
An 8th century prayer book.
89
89
We fly through the city streets...
PENELOPE (V.O.)
From his museum in Prague, stashed
in the castle.
Up to the base of the castle, through a grated hole in an
ancient wall, into...
90
91
BLOOM
That's what he does.
STEPHEN
Wonder who's his fence?
BLOOM
Probably his Spanish guy, right?
(asks Penelope)
Did he say who's buying?
PENELOPE
An Argentinian. Argentine?
Argentinian?
92
92
THE CURATOR
A gentleman from Argentina. He's
quite sick, cancer in his bones,
and desperate for sentimental
reasons to own this piece while he
may.
93
93
PENELOPE
He'll sell it to a middleman for
one million, US. The Argentin...a
guy will pay two point five.
STEPHEN
Not bad.
PENELOPE
Is he legit?
57
93
CONTINUED:
93
STEPHEN
The Curator? That's a relative
term. He's telling the truth.
BLOOM
I'm sorry you had to deal with that
guy.
Behind Penelope, two porters load her steamer trunk into the
back of a taxi.
BLOOM (cont'd)
Where's that cab going?
PENELOPE
The train station.
BLOOM
Where's the train going?
PENELOPE
Prague.
Bloom breathes.
PENELOPE (cont'd)
Let's do it. Let's, just, I want
to try this. Let's be smugglers.
I think it'd be fun. We should do
this.
BLOOM
No.
PENELOPE
Why not?
BLOOM
Well first off, we don't have a
million dollars.
PENELOPE
I do, I've got, that's whatever.
I
mean a real reason.
BLOOM
This is real, it's dangerous, it
could go very bad.
PENELOPE
I think a little real danger might
suit me. I'm gonna do it.
(MORE)
58
93
CONTINUED: (2)
93
PENELOPE (cont'd)
So if you want to join my smugglers
gang, you know, I'll consider it.
She walks off towards the taxi.
BLOOM
This is not an adventure story.
PENELOPE
What are you talking about?
It
totally is.
94
94
A train roars through the night towards Prague.
95
100
The train steams onward into the growing storm.
101
101
Our intrepid four stroll the bridge, the city's castle
looming before them.
Penelope slumps pale faced in dark glasses.
63
101
CONTINUED:
101
STEPHEN
The last time I was in Prague, I
was in love.
PENELOPE
What was she like?
STEPHEN
Pale skin.
Long feet.
So.
He winks.
102
104
STEPHEN
You will go to the bank, that wire
should have cleared if you put it
in at Athens.
PENELOPE
Cash?
105
110
Penelope and Bloom stroll home in silence through crowded,
vibrant cobblestone streets.
PENELOPE
You aren't constipated. You're
scared. What are you scared of?
They walk on, suddenly somehow holding hands.
As they approach the hotel, Bloom deftly breaks their hand
holding off. Penelope notices why.
111
112
The sun sets against the castle, taking us into night.
113
114
Bloom watches the Dog get into a waiting black Mercedes. For
an instant the car's interior light shows an 11 year old boy
behind the tinted glass, as the Dog slides in and puts his
arm around him.
The Mercedes drives off.
72
115
115
Right in front of the hotel, on the water. Bloom sips coffee
from a china cup, spinning a paper in his hands. Stephen
joins him, with a matching cup.
STEPHEN
I'm sorry I wasn't there.
BLOOM
You can't always be there.
STEPHEN
No, I guess can't.
A beat.
BLOOM
That was a real tonal shift.
The
Curator's tale.
On one side of the paper is the sketch of Penelope, on the
other is the con flowchart. "#12 - The Curator's Tale."
"#14 - Castle Break-In."
STEPHEN
I'm a big fan of tonal shifts. I
didn't write it for him, though.
BLOOM
He made it up on the spot?
STEPHEN
I don't know.
116
121
Several empty glasses of wine, one full one in Penelope's
hand. All heads are slumped.
PENELOPE
Oh.
75
121
CONTINUED:
121
BLOOM
It's my fault. I can't believe I
left you alone with him.
The Chink hands Stephen a piece of paper.
He glances at it.
STEPHEN
The check was cashed yesterday
afternoon, he'd have deposited it
in a Swiss account. I'm sorry Pen.
PENELOPE
What a waste.
Bloom puts his hand on her arm, sympathetic.
PENELOPE (cont'd)
That poor man. What a waste.
Bloom's expression turns quizzical.
PENELOPE (cont'd)
That poor Argentina man. He'll
never see the book now, it'll just
rot in the catacombs. What a
waste.
When Penelope lifts her suddenly brightened eyes in a moment
of divine inspiration, Bloom meets her gaze with fear.
122
122
Bloom paces, Penelope looks up at the castle with binoculars.
The Chink and Stephen stand by.
BLOOM
No. No no. Can't you see what
happened here, there is no book,
we've been swindled -
PENELOPE
But maybe there is, maybe it's
real, we don't know!
BLOOM
It's not real, it's a con.
PENELOPE
It's my money, I'm going to find
out for sure. He gave us every
piece of information we need.
76
122
CONTINUED:
122
She spreads the castle floor plan out on a bench.
Bloom turns to Stephen and the Chink with a "this is crazy
right?" expression and gesture. They give him nothing back.
STEPHEN
We'd need to clear the
administrative offices.
Some sort
of disruption.
The Chink strokes her chin in mock-thoughtfulness.
PENELOPE
(to Bloom)
C'mon. Help me break into this
castle. It'll be fun.
123
123
A Barbie Doll set up in the middle of the field explodes in a
theatrical plume of fire.
Several others follow suit.
The Chink pops up from behind a mound of dirt in her aviator
goggles, cigarette dangling from her lip. She leans on a
detonator plunger.
Bloom, Stephen and Penelope crouch nearby, watching her work.
STEPHEN
She's an artist with nitroglycerin.
It's kind of her thing.
PENELOPE
I feel like I want to know more
about her.
BLOOM
STEPHEN
Yeah.
Yeah.
STEPHEN
Check the tat.
On the back of the Chink's neck, a few finely scripted lines
of Chinese.
77
123
CONTINUED:
123
STEPHEN (cont'd)
An inky wisp of personal
information. We transcribed it,
brought it into a Chinese
restaurant.
PENELOPE
What's it say?
BLOOM
The literal translation is
something about water cranes, but
essentially it means "When you're
done with something, blow it up."
124
126
The sun arcs into the sky above the castle.
127
128
In his boxers, holding trousers and shirt in his teeth, Bloom
swings over the ledge from Penelope's window into his.
129
132
A little alcove with a good view of the castle.
80
132
CONTINUED:
132
Stephen trains his gaze on one set of windows high in the
Eastern tower. Bloom paces.
133
134
Stephen, Bloom and Penelope are joined by the Chink.
STEPHEN
Ok.
He looks through his binoculars again.
BLOOM
Alright?
PENELOPE
Ok.
They share a brief moment with their eyes, and Penelope trots
off. The Chink caught it. She looks at Bloom slyly.
BLOOM
For the record, I'm still against
this. Why send her in alone?
The Chink finds a way to casually smell Bloom's fingers.
STEPHEN
Because going in alone is a very
important thing to do. She's
walking into a zero security
tourism office during a fire drill
and taking a five hundred dollar
manuscript replica from a utility
crawlspace. Worst case scenario, a
file clerk asks if she's lost.
Which isn't even going to happen.
(to the Chink)
She's in position.
He spots Penelope casually waiting beside an unmarked door.
Bloom notices the Chink looking at him with a knowing grin.
She mimes sealing her lips and tossing the key.
81
134
CONTINUED:
134
She then takes the ballpoint pen detonator... out of the
handbag dangling at her hip.
STEPHEN (cont'd)
Cause nobody's going to know we
were ever here.
Bloom spots the handbag.
Something's not right.
BLOOM
Uh-
The Chink clicks the pen.
135
136
A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION blows a massive ten foot wide chunk
out of the side of the Eastern tower, spewing a painfully
dramatic ball of fire and debris.
Screams.
Shouts.
Panic.
Our three look up at the tower, agape.
THE CHINK
Fuck me.
Bloom grabs the binoculars from Stephen, looks for Penelope.
137
137
Panicked tourists stumble away from the descending dust.
Penelope sees what's happened, but holds her ground.
The unmarked door opens, and a dozen business people pour
out.
138
138
BLOOM
Don't do it don't do it Penelope
don't-
82
138
CONTINUED:
138
STEPHEN
They're locking down the castle,
she won't get in.
139
139
She takes a step towards the door.
140
140
Bloom drops the binoculars and sprints.
141
141
A burly SECURITY GUARD trots across the courtyard, herding
tourists and smoking a cigar.
SECURITY GUARD
To ze back, no panic, to ze back...
He blocks the office door, and sets his cigar down for a
moment. Penelope spots it.
142
142
Bloom nears the courtyard, sees Penelope up ahead.
BLOOM
Pen! Don't - abort!
Corned beef!
Corned beef!
143
143
Penelope deftly spins the cigar 180 degrees.
The Guard absently picks it up and puts it back in his mouth,
fire-side first. He howls, doubles over.
She dashes into the door.
Bloom bursts out of the crowd and lunges for the door, but a
SECOND SECURITY GUARD stops him.
Dozens more security guards swarm in. Overhead, an army
helicopter buzzes by. Bloom stares into the doorway,
helpless and scared.
83
144
147
A full view of the castle reveals just about the worst case
scenario. The entire area swarms with army helicopters and
tanks, soldiers with rifles, yellow tape, news crews.
Stephen, Bloom and the Chink sit behind the police line on
the bridge with the rest of the crowds. Heads in their
hands.
148
149
Bloom suddenly stands.
BLOOM
Wait. Wait, we're fine. She's
fine. If the soldiers find her
wandering the halls they'll assume
she's a clerk, they'll just shoo
her out. So as long as she doesn't
do anything suspicious, she's fine.
150
154
The hubbub has died down considerably, soldiers march away
from the castle in formation. Bloom Stephen and the Chink
sit watching for some sign.
Three police cars, sirens blazing, drive down the length of
the bridge.
BLOOM
The Chief of Police.
As the last one passes, Bloom sees the Chief of Police riding
shotgun, and Penelope sitting with a soldier behind caged
mesh in the back seat.
His face falls.
Then Penelope spots him, points and says something.
Very suddenly, the police car stops.
The Chief of Police gets out.
Nods at our intrepid three.
And opens the door for Penelope. As she climbs out he
motions for the passing soldiers to stand at attention and
salute her.
He kisses her hand.
CHIEF OF POLICE
(in Czech)
It has been a privilege, madame, to
behold even briefly such a strong,
beautiful flower.
PENELOPE
(in Czech)
Thank you sir, I will not soon
forget your kindness.
She blushes and smiles, then does an unhurried victory strut
back to Bloom, Stephen and the Chink.
86
154
CONTINUED:
154
The police cars drive off.
Penelope pulls the book out from under her jacket and sets it
on a bench. A moment of victorious silence.
Clapping her hands, she does a little shuffle dance of joy.
PENELOPE (cont'd)
(sings)
We're a band of smugglers hey,
la la la la la,
we smuggle by night, drink by day,
smugglers ho, ho ho...
Everybody!
155
155
Bloom and Stephen sit among empty wine glasses.
The Chink approaches, gives Stephen a hand gesture.
STEPHEN
Let her sleep. Train doesn't leave
till eight.
BLOOM
That was real.
STEPHEN
Yeah, I know.
BLOOM
Fuckin scary.
156
156
Bloom walks pensively through a green park. Cat Stevens'
"Miles from Nowhere" plays from a nearby radio.
His eye catches something.
A shiny red apple on a fruit
seller's cart.
He approaches it slowly, face flushed, breath shallow, eyeing
the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance.
Holy shit.
He is going to steal that apple.
Deftly he passes, lifting and pocketing it just as the Vendor
turns away. Bloom has done it. His pale face tightens.
87
156
CONTINUED:
156
And turns.
And sees a five year old boy.
Giving him a stare of infinite
judgement.
Bloom turns on his heel and RUNS HELL FOR LEATHER.
The vendor shouts. The little boy chases him, pointing and
screaming. Dogs bark. People stare. And Bloom sprints,
apple in hand, a joyful smile forming on his lips.
157
158
The train thunders South, towards Greece.
159
161
The good ship Fidele breaks the waves, blowing its horn.
88
161
CONTINUED:
161
Stephen stands on the deck.
Bloom joins him.
STEPHEN
Mexico.
He strolls off, leaving Bloom watching the horizon gloomily.
162
162
Our intrepid four sit around a small table (except for the
Chink, who lies on a deck chair in a bikini and Chuck
Taylors, sunning herself.)
STEPHEN
Oh-kay. We're rendezvousing with
Senor Rioso's guys here, on an
isolated beach just south of the
Mexican port town Tampico. A
simple handoff. Penelope and
Yeungling will stay with the car,
Bloom and I will do the handing.
PENELOPE
You guys seem a little tense.
STEPHEN
Well I'm not thrilled they set this
in Mexico. There could be
legitimate reasons, but Mexico's -
and I don't want to simplistically
vilify an entire country, but
Mexico's a horrible place. So
we'll be careful.
163
163
The Chink fires an automatic pistol eight times into the dead
center of a target pinned to a palm tree. She re-loads.
164
164
The beach sprawling below them, Penelope and Bloom meander.
The hotel itself feels very old, red ruinous stone.
PENELOPE
Is this going to be more dangerous
than I think, tomorrow?
89
164
CONTINUED:
164
BLOOM
Yeah. You should sleep at the
hotel tonight, I'll stay with
Stephen at the beach house. You'll
need sleep.
On the distant beach, following the faint rapport of gunfire,
a palm tree falls over.
PENELOPE
I'm really happy right now.
Are
you?
BLOOM
Right now I am.
She kisses him and runs off along the cliff side, singing the
smuggler song.
BLOOM (cont'd)
Penelope...
But she's too far away now, and the ocean is too loud. She
can't hear him, and he can't hear her, and in another moment
she has vanishes into the green brush and white flowers.
Behind Bloom's pained face, the sun dips towards the beach.
165
166
Bloom stands, the beach behind him, the glowing lights of the
hotel before him. Growing determination.
167
167
Bloom knocks on a door.
Penelope answers, in her bathrobe.
PENELOPE
Hey.
BLOOM
I know what I've gotta do. I've
gotta talk to you. Are you wearing
shoes?
PENELOPE
What's up?
He pulls her out of the room.
168
169
The waves break angrily on the beach. In the distance,
Stephen finishes his drink on the beach house porch, goes
inside and turns out the light.
170
170
BLOOM
No, we were going to blow you off
tomorrow using the cackle bladder,
it's a, term, we have actors
playing the Argentina guy's men,
when we showed up the deal would go
bad, they would open fire on us,
Stephen and I would pretend to be
shot using blood packets, squibs.
That's - cackle bladder, in the old
days they put fake blood in chicken
bladders, so... So you'd escape
with the Chink, she'd send you off
with a little travelling money and
that would be that.
PENELOPE
Wow.
BLOOM
But that's not how this one's going
to end. I love you now, and I want
to get you out of this. I'm going
to do what I have to do to get you
out of this, away from all this for
good. Are you ready?
92
171
171
Bloom leads Penelope down the beach by the hand.
BLOOM
Stephen's gone into town to prep
the Argentina actors. Your money's
at his place.
PENELOPE
Money? I don't want the money,
let's just leave.
For a moment he's tempted.
The dark beach house looms ahead.
BLOOM
C'mon.
172
173
A wood patio with steps leading down to the sand.
Bloom
watches Penelope, now very distant, almost gone.
Stephen comes out, pulls out a flask.
STEPHEN
Hey.
(nothing)
I think that was the most honest
conversation we've ever had.
(more nothing)
You actually connected on a few of
those punches.
BLOOM
Did you expect me to do it? To
come here tonight, end it the way
you wrote it? Or were you really
disappointed I didn't run off with
her?
STEPHEN
I was disappointed.
But I wasn't
surprised.
Bloom turns and SLUGS him in the jaw.
Stephen falls to the
sand.
BLOOM
I let you do your monologue, but
you wanna know why I did it? I did
it so she'd never want to see me
again. To get her away from all
this for good.

Without looking back Bloom walks off down the beach, in the
opposite direction of Penelope, leaving Stephen bleeding in
the sand, alone in the dark uncertain night.
FADE OUT.
TITLE CARD - 3 months later.
174
174
Penelope's home, bucolic on a lazy Spring day.
At a picnic table at the far edge of the front lawn, Penelope
sits writing with intense concentration on a piece of paper.
After awhile she raises her head, regarding what she's
written thoughtfully. Folds it up, puts it in her pocket.
Clicks the seemingly innocent ballpoint pen.
BEEP.
The mansion EXPLODES, completely.
She walks away without looking back.
After a beat, the plaster deer explodes in a ridiculous
fireball.
175
175
Green hills surround the walled medieval city of Ferentino.
A tiny white car inches its way across the countryside, and
up into the city.
176
176
Bloom walks up the stone alley to his apartment, a bag of
groceries in hand. He spots the white car parked out front.
Loud shouting in Italian grows louder, until Penelope and the
Grandmother burst out the front door. Berating each other
with Italian curses and hand gestures.
Penelope sees Bloom, and freezes.
PENELOPE
Hello.
97
176
CONTINUED:
176
BLOOM
Hey.
The Grandmother keeps up her barrage as she takes the
groceries from Bloom, but as soon as she's behind Penelope's
back she gives Bloom a wink, points to her and gives a thumbs-
up of approval.
177
177
Bloom and Penelope wander the twisty alleyways of the city.
BLOOM
How did you find me?
PENELOPE
The Chink.
BLOOM
How did you find the Chink?
PENELOPE
She gave me her cell when we got to
Mexico.
BLOOM
I didn't even know she had one.
PENELOPE
I think she's kind of selective in
who she gives the number to.
178
178
They sit with wine and bread.
BLOOM
Why are you here, Penelope?
PENELOPE
Why did you decide to stay with
your brother instead of coming with
me in Mexico?
BLOOM
Everything Stephen said that night
was true.
98
178
CONTINUED:
178
PENELOPE
I've been doing a lot of thinking
the past three months. I want you
to consider something.
She takes a piece of paper from her pocket, unfolds it and
slides it across the table to him.
On it, written over and over in a dozen different stylized
fonts, is "PENELOPE THE CON ARTIST."
Bloom sets the paper down with a snap.
BLOOM
Go away. Everything Stephen said
was true. I was just playing you
as a mark. Everything between us,
none of it was real.
She leans in close to him, her hand on his leg.
PENELOPE
I don't believe you.
It's obvious even before she kisses him that she's right.
179
179
Bloom dials a pay phone.
He's been crying.
It rings.
BLOOM
Pick up... c'mon...
180
181
BLOOM
How quickly can you get to
Ferentino?
STEPHEN (ON PHONE)
Uh... Nine-ish?
Bloom fishes out his pocket watch.
BLOOM
Alright.
Click. As he's putting his pocket watch back, he finds the
stack of green rubber band money in his breast pocket.
182
183
Stephen and Bloom sit on the little landing outside the
apartment.
STEPHEN
So she comes back wanting to work
with us. Honestly? I think we'd
be lucky to have her. If you
called me to hear my opinion on the
matter. Which I'm getting the
feeling you didn't.
BLOOM
I did what I did in Mexico to get
her out of all this. I would rather
die than bring her into the con.
STEPHEN
So maybe you want to tell me what
I'm doing in Ferentino.
100
183
CONTINUED:
183
BLOOM
You knew she'd come back. What did
you figure she was good for,
another million?
STEPHEN
One point seven five.
BLOOM
We will play her again, one last
con, but not for money. I'm gonna
tell you how this one's gonna end.
You built us into this, you're
gonna fly us out, end it so she's
done with all of us. End it all so
it can't start up again.
STEPHEN
You want me to plan a con whose
sole purpose is to blow her off for
good?
BLOOM
I love her. You owe me this. I
don't want to turn her into me.
184
188
The blood red sun sets over the city.
189
197
The Peugeot drives into the heart of the city.
198
198
Bloom, Stephen and the Chink parked in an alley, watching a
doorway across the street with a pair of binoculars.
Bloom breathes uneasily, checks his watch.
BLOOM
She gives the Dog the book, he
gives her the fake money. This is
taking too long.
Just then Penelope trots out.
Metal attache case in hand.
199
199
On the outskirts of town, parked beside a murky little lake.
Our heroes gather around the metal attache case on the hood.
PENELOPE
He hassled me. Took forever
looking the book over, haggled the
price. Wanted to pay me in Rubles.
Stephen smirks, then opens it.
The money's there.
STEPHEN
Alright.
Let's get the hell out of
Russia.
108
199
CONTINUED:
199
Bloom pulls the Dog's gold lighter from his pocket, takes one
last glance at St. Petersburg and tosses it down into the
lake.
200
200
The brown Peugeot drives towards the climbing sun.
201
202
A BLACK MERCEDES roars out on to the road, machine gun fire
blazing from its windows, literally shredding the Peugeot.
The car spins, tires flapping, and hits a highway embankment
full speed, launching into the air.
203
204
The car slams into the steep grassy embankment, manages to
flip upright, and rolls into a thick forest, coming to an
abrupt stop against a stout tree.
109
204
CONTINUED:
204
STEPHEN
OUT!
They all four dive out of the car, Bloom shoving Penelope,
tumbling into the thick forest an instant before the car
becomes a roiling ball of flame.
Bloom lies shell-shocked, his vision blurry. He vaguely sees
Penelope passed out beside him, Stephen on the other side of
the car.
A DARK FIGURE comes trotting into the woods, shining a
flashlight on the charred car. Goes to Stephen. Reaches
down to him...
Bloom's mind flutters away into darkness.
205
206
A desolate gas station parking lot. Bloom sits in the Bug,
loading his revolver with shaky fingers. Penelope stands
outside.
BLOOM
Stephen, god please what's
happening. I don't know what to
do. I don't know Stephen please.
Please. What's happening. Please.
A long black sedan screeches to a halt in the parking lot
outside the window, Bloom bolts out of the car, pistol ready.
But the Chink climbs out of the black sedan.
PENELOPE
Where does she get all these cars?
Bloom motions for Penelope to stay back, then goes to meet
the Chink in the middle of the parking lot.
BLOOM
If you know what's happening, now
would be a really good time to
speak up.
She sets a suitcase down beside her.
Bloom takes this in.
BLOOM (cont'd)
No, please. Not now. I need your
help here now, I don't know what to
do.
The slightest smile communicates all the compassion in the
world. But she's leaving.
She hands him a small slip of paper, their fingers touching
for an instant.
111
206
CONTINUED:
206
She gives Penelope a quick little "call me" gesture, picks up
her case and walks off.
A truck blocking our view of her car pulls away, and she gets
in.
Bloom looks down at the slip of paper.
A short phrase, in
Chinese.
BLOOM (cont'd)
Thanks.
The engine turns over, and the Chink's car EXPLODES in a
dramatic fireball.
The paper flutters out of Blooms's fingers a moment before he
and Penelope are thrown to the pavement by the shock wave.
Bloom and Penelope lift their heads, absorbing what just
happened.
207
207
A busy street, which a title card identifies as "Chicago,
Illinois."
On the corner, an unassuming Chinese restaurant.
208
210
The Bug parked nearby. Penelope sits on the curb, crying.
Bloom sits next to her.
PENELOPE
What did it mean?
BLOOM
I don't know.
PENELOPE
What did it say?
BLOOM
"We're all of us marks in our own
cons." And she said goodbye.
PENELOPE
I still can't believe it.
BLOOM
That the Chink fell for a car bomb?
Neither can I.
PENELOPE
(hopeful)
What? Oh, oh god do you think she
faked it? So the Russians would
think she was dead?
113
210
CONTINUED:
210
Bloom stands, paces away. He leafs limply through the manila
folder - addresses, pictures, information...
A paper with the Dog's photo clipped to it.
An address in
St. Petersburg.
The napkin Stephen wrote the con flowchart on.
The third box
- "The End."
PENELOPE (cont'd)
What do we do now?
Scrawled on the inside of the manila envelope - "An unwritten
life." Bloom's face clears. He wipes his eyes.
BLOOM
Ok.
Bloom goes to the Bug.
PENELOPE
Where are you going?
BLOOM
This wasn't Russians. This was
done by an old mentor of ours who
wants us off the map. He has an
apartment in St. Petersburg. So
this is, yeah. I've gotta go back
to that apartment to face the Dog
and get my brother back. That's
how I'm gonna end this.
Penelope's eyes gleam. She jumps up to the passenger door,
and Bloom stops her with a weary look.
PENELOPE
We can skip the whole you-sending-
me-nobly-away-and-me-refusing-to-
leave-your-side-thing.
BLOOM
Thank Christ.
211
211
A narrow alley between tall apartments.
Bloom parks, pulls
his gun and checks it.
114
211
CONTINUED:
211
BLOOM
If there are shots you run to the
car and drive, with or without me.
212
214
Bloom trots out of the apartment building, and sees two
things: Penelope working the VW's starter, and a black
Mercedes speeding down the narrow street towards her.
He sprints towards her, screaming
BLOOM
Get out!
Get out of the car!!
She sees the approaching Merc, too late, and ducks down.
A hand hurls something from the darkened window. It smashes
through the Bug's passenger side window, showering Penelope
with glass.
The Mercedes roars off down the street.
Bloom reaches the Bug and throws the door open.
Penelope lies covered in safety glass, holding a Russian
nesting doll.
215
216
Bloom sits in the car, alone. He punches the dashboard
again, helpless enraged and scared.
Penelope gets in, looks at the address on the note.
PENELOPE
Ok.
217
217
Penelope and Bloom sit in the car, parked in front of the
impressive facade of a closed, burned out old theater.
The clock on the dashboard reads 1:50.
BLOOM
I'm so scared. Anything I can
imagine finding in there, I'm
scared of.
PENELOPE
I'm going to be here when you come
out.
She kisses him.
He puts his hand on the door.
Hesitates.
Then goes.
Walks up the stairs to the inky maw of the theater door.
Goes in alone.
119
218
221
Rumbling towards Finland.
In the Bug, Bloom sleeps in Penelope's arm while she drives.
She looks at his hand on hers, his shirt cuff bright red with
Stephen's "blood." She strokes his shoulder sadly.
Off Bloom's sleeping face...
222
224
She does.
He bursts out of the car, and run/tumbles down the grassy
hillside till he finds the car tracks.
He follows them to the charred remains of the Peugeot.
Penelope stumbles down after him.
PENELOPE
What is it? You're scaring me-
BLOOM
What did you ask the Russian kid,
in the Dog's apartment? He said
the Dog isn't here, then what did
you ask?
Bloom kicks open the trunk.
Pries open the blistered attache
case.
125
224
CONTINUED:
224
Sifts through the charred pile of cinders that was the money
from the "Russians" till he finds what he was looking for and
brings it out into the dying light.
PENELOPE
How long had he been alone.
BLOOM
And what did he say?
A scrap of unburned money.
A fragment of Ben Franklin's
face.
PENELOPE
Since yesterday morning.
A single eye gazing up at him, the green grass behind it.
The eye is perfect.
No cross hatching.
Bloom sinks to his knees.
BLOOM
This is real. They hassled you.
PENELOPE
Bloom-
BLOOM
The Dog was gone before we got
there. They hadn't cleared out of
their apartment, they had been
cleared out.
225
226
BLOOM
Real Russians. Took his store.
They didn't know about his deal
with us, but you haggled with them.
You really sold the book to real
Russians. The Diamond Dog was
gone.
126
227
227
The scene beside the lake, our four heroes checking the money
in the attache case.
STEPHEN
Let's get the hell out of Russia.
Bloom tosses the gold lighter, it splashes into the lake.
We
follow it, plunging beneath the surface.
Deep deep down, among weak tendrils of light, the Diamond Dog
sinks into watery blackness, a long blade in his neck.
228
228
BLOOM
And they came after us.
And
Stephen...
Penelope holds him tight.
PENELOPE
I know.
BLOOM
Stephen saved my life.
PENELOPE
I know.
BLOOM
He's gone.
Bloom folds into Penelope's arms, but she doesn't let him.
She holds his crying face up.
PENELOPE
And he did it so you could live.
Your brother loved you. He loved
you so much. Look at me. Stephen
said something once, I got the
feeling he'd rather be telling it
to you. He said there's no such
thing as an unwritten life. Just
badly written ones. I love you.

PENELOPE (cont'd)
We're gonna outrun these bastard
Russian mafia, and we're gonna hide
out in Rio, then we're gonna live
like we're telling the best fucking
story in the world. Are you ready?
She holds his face close to hers for a long beat. Then
smiles and pushes away, launching up the grassy hill.
Bloom watches her.
Time slows as she turns back towards him, still running, and
holds out her hand for him to follow.
BLOOM (V.O.)
I was thinking of something Stephen
said too. "The perfect con is one
where everyone involved gets just
the thing they wanted." Well.
He takes the girl's hand, and runs with her towards the point
of light breaking over the hill.
229
229
Sunset with her wine-red fingers falls over the road ahead.
The rumbly old VW chugs away from us, towards the horizon.
