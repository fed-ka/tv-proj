  In ONE LONG SHOT, A MOTORCYCLE TEARS through the streets.  
  It sweeps right into frame.  TWO HOT GIRLS flank either 
  side.  The DRIVER gets off and hands his helmet to the 
  girls.  It s Dave.  He looks like a star, until:  

                              DAVE
                    Hi, my name s-- Line?!*

                              MAX (O.S.)
                    Cut!

  REVEAL: Max is filming Dave s commercial. 

MAX (CONT D)
How do you forget your own name?

                              DAVE
                    Sorry, Max.  I just blanked.

                              MAX
                    Dave, that was your thirty-seventh *
                    take and each one is worse than the 
                    last.  What s the problem?

                              DAVE*
                    I m freaking out, man! *

                              MAX
                    Dave, walk with me.*
                      (puts arm around Dave)*
                    I know Steak Me Home is important to *
                    you.  We all have things that are *
                    important to us.  Like, for me, it s *
                    figuring out new ways to get *
                    strangers to buy me gasoline.*

DAVE*
Point?!*

 truck in the first place?  Let s*
stop being polite and start getting 
real.*

DAVE
                      Uh...okay.  Well, I guess I opened a 
                    truck because of my dad.  Every 
                    weekend after my swim meets, my dad 
                    and I would get a hot dog from this 
                    food truck.  It was the best hot dog 
                    ever.

                              MAX
                    This is great.  I m loving the emo.  
                    Just gonna do a slow push in.

  REVEAL: Max, holding the camera, is on a skateboard and 
  slowly wheels closer to Dave.

DAVE
My dad and I would sit on a bench, 
have a dog and talk about whatever.  *

the permission slip so he can shower *

MAX
                    Uh-oh, shoelace stuck in the wheel,  *
                    going down!  *

Max stumbles and falls.


  Max and Dave are there.  It s very quiet.

                              DAVE
                    How did we forget to say I sell 
                    steak sandwiches?

                              MAX
                    Dave, nobody remembers what 
                      commercials sell what products.  
                    Like that Old Spice one with the 
                    black guy who s shirtless in the 
                    shower?  What s he selling?

                              DAVE
                    Old Spice!

                              MAX
                    No, no, no, I m talking about the 
                    Old Spice commercial with the guy 
                    that--  Ohhhh.  My bad.  He s so 
                    ripped, it s hard to focus on 
                    anything else.

DAVE
