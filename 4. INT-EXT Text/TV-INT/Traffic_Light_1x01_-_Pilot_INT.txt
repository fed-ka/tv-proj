          ADAM, 33, an editor at a Men s magazine, drives home 
          through the streets of Chicago. (Think Paul Rudd). He 
          dials his cell. 

                                            ADAM
                        (INTO PHONE) Hey, Mike. What re 
                        you up to?

                                            MIKE 
                        (ON SPEAKER) You know, kicking 
                        back, enjoying a fine cigar, 
                        livin  the good life.

                                            ADAM 
                        You re in your car, aren t you?



          MIKE, 33, a lawyer, is, in fact, parked a few blocks from 
        his home, smoking a cigar in his car. (Think a less angry 
          Vince Vaughn in  Old School ).

                                            MIKE 
                        Yup. Parked two blocks from the 
                        house. As soon as I get home, Lisa 
                        puts me to work on the second 
                        shift. 

          QUICK POP: Mike runs after his naked 3 year-old son, 
          dripping with water from the bath. Mike slips in a 
          puddle, falling on his butt as his wife LISA runs by with 
          a basket of laundry. Post-work, pre-bedtime chaos.

                                            MIKE (CONT D)
                        Kids change everything. You ll 
                        see, Adam. It s great but-- you ll 
                        see.

        Mike looks over to his mini-DVD player on the passenger 
          seat.  Iron Man  is on pause. He s been watching it every 
        day after work in fifteen minute chunks. 



                                            ADAM
                        Would you stop with that  you ll 
                        see  stuff? We re just moving in 
                        together.

          QUICK POP: A REALTOR shows Adam and his girlfriend CALLIE 
        an empty brownstone.

                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                      2.

                        She s been practically living at 
                        my place for months. It s not that 
                        big of a deal.

          QUICK POP: Adam sweats bullets as he signs the mortgage. 
         30 years fixed  seems to gyrate on the page.

                                            MIKE
                        (SPEAKER) God, I love your 
                        innocence. I really do. 

                                            ADAM
                        It still amazes me that a guy who 
                        can survive in a cut-throat legal 
                          environment has lie to his wife 
                        about traffic so he can enjoy a 
                        cigar and watch  Batman. 



                                            MIKE
                        Finished  Batman.  Watching  Iron 
                        Man  now. It s very good. (THEN) 
                        Look, marriage is a negotiation. 
                        Especially after you have kids. I 
                        negotiate with some of the most 
                        evil bastards in the world. It s 
                          exhausting. The last thing I want 
                        to do is negotiate some more when 
                        I get home. I ve had to cede some 
                          territorial jurisdiction.



        Lisa and Mike unload the groceries. Lisa pulls out a 
          bottle of green dish soap.

                                            LISA
                        What s this? Why did you buy this?

                                            MIKE
                        There wasn t any red soap so I 
                        bought the green.

                                            LISA
                        You re not authorized to make that 
                        decision.



                                            MIKE
                        I need to clear out a little space 
                        for myself and this is just a lot 
                        easier. You ll see.

                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                      3.

          ETHAN, 33, an EMT, drives. Ethan s perpetually single but 
        has a guileless honesty that s charming. (Think a younger

                        You re driving Carl to his walk?

        At the mention of the word  walk,  Carl jumps around.

                                            ETHAN
                        (SPEAKER) Carl prefers a park on

                        half as well as you treat your

                        I d rather have three weeks of

                        use together at your new home-- 
                        but no kitchen stuff. Something

        SFX: The beeps of another call on Mike s line.

                        Wait. That s Lisa. See you guys 
                        tomorrow. Don t give him a ticket. 
                        (CLICKS OVER) Hey, honey. Yeah, 
                        traffic s hell. (BEAT) The traffic

                        probably about twenty minutes.

        Mike hangs up. There s a tap on the window. He rolls it 
        down to reveal a GUY about Mike s age, holding a cigar.

                        Of course.

        Mike hands him his cigar lighter. The guy lights his 
          cigar, blows out a satisfied puff of smoke, then:

                                          GUY
                        Can I borrow  Iron Man  when

                        Sure.

        PULL BACK TO REVEAL a line of about three or four cars 
          parked behind Mike, each with an arm out the window, 
          holding a cigar. Behind them, at an intersection, a 
          traffic light turns to RED.

        ACT TWO



          Ethan, Mike, and Mike s wife, LISA, 33, help Adam and his 
          girlfriend CALLIE unpack while eating pizzas. Adam hands 
          Callie a present. Mike and Ethan take note.

                        do together.

          Behind Callie, Mike gives Adam the thumbs up. Callie 
          opens it. It s a Wii game.

                        You are a very thoughtful man.

          Callie kisses Adam. Mike pulls a picture out of a box. 
        It s of the 1999 University of Illinois baseball team.

        They laugh.

                        There s nothing like being on a

        Adam is at his desk in the swank offices of the men s 
          magazine where he works. The magazine s publisher, MARTY, 
        an incredibly well-off man in his 50s, enters.

                        economic times to make you feel

          photo of Callie.

                        of them a few issues ago.

        Adam pulls out a magazine with a large wrestler, dressed 
        as a clown holding an electric saw, on the cover.

                        Yeah, that s why I m here, smart-
                        guy. Remember the big manipulation 
                        prologue? Here s the pay-off. My 
                        kid s obsessed with the Sawing 
                        Clown. Do you think you can get 
                        him and a few other wrestlers to 
                        do an exhibition performance at 
                        the party?

                          Absolutely! I totally hit it off 
                        with the Sawing Clown. I even 
                        helped him shop for an engagement 
                        ring for his fiancee.



        Adam admires a diamond setting with the SAWING CLOWN.

                        I don t know, man. I think the 
                        cushion cut diamond with the 
                        princess setting is a little more 
                        classic. And I m not sure how I 
                        feel about the white gold. There, 
                        I said it.

                        that. You ll want to be careful. 
                        They consider themselves athletes.

                        last issue of Gourmet. You want 
                        one?



          Ethan, in his EMT uniform, talks on his phone.

                                            ETHAN
                        Sherry broke up with me.

                        Total pro. Really nice. No scenes. 
                        A friend s gonna pick up her 
                        stuff. I m gonna have to give her 
                        a ten. Cool girl.

                        good?

                                            ETHAN
                        Yeah, just a little surprised, I 
                        guess. Should have seen it coming 
                        though. She has a birthday coming 
                        up. I usually get dumped in 
                        periods of reevaluation.

                        (SPEAKER) Buddy, as a friend, I 
                        gotta say: as we get older, the

                        and women willing to  take things 
                        day by day  is gonna get smaller 
                        and smaller. You ever think about, 
                        you know, maybe trying out a real 
                          commitment? See how it feels?

                                            ETHAN
                        I know how it feels. It feels like  
                        the sweater my Aunt gave me. It s 
                        too tight, it s itchy, and it 
                        smells like a farm.

                        (SPEAKER) What?

                        Doesn t matter. Single s my 
                        natural state. You and Mike were 
                        always the relationship guys. Me 
                        and Ben were the single guys. I 
                        gotta get back out there. Can you 
                        go out tonight?

                                            ADAM
                        (SPEAKER) I think I can make that

                        Cool. Calling Mike.



        Mike is in the car with Lisa. The phone rings. The 
          dashboard display reads:  Ethan calling. 

                                            MIKE
                        Hi, Ethan. Lisa s in the car. Say 
                        hello. Her car s in the shop.

                                            ETHAN
                        (ON SPEAKER, FLUMUXED) Oh. Hi 
                        Lisa. (BEAT) Okay, Mike, I ll call 
                        you later.

          Ethan hangs up. A beat, then:

                                            LISA
                        Why did you tell Ethan I was in 
                        the car?

                                            MIKE
                        I was being polite.

                                            LISA
                          (SKEPTICAL) Uh-huh.

                                            MIKE
                        What?

                                            LISA
                        The way Ethan hung up so fast-- it 
                        made me feel like he wanted to 
                        talk about something you couldn t 
                        talk about in front of me. Like 
                        you re keeping some secret. 

                                            MIKE
                        That s ridiculous. Ethan s crazy. 
                        Fifty percent chance that was a 
                        pocket call. 

                                            LISA
                        Okay, as a fun experiment, next 
                        time one of the guys calls, don t 
                        tell  em I m here.

        Mike looks at her and doesn t blink.

                                            MIKE
                        Fine. No problem.

        Mike turns to look out his window and shows his real 
          feeling: yikes. The phone rings again. Mike answers.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    15.

                        Hi, Mom. Say hi to Lisa. Her car s 
                        in the shop. (OFF LISA S LOOK) 
                        What? Mom s not one of the guys.

                                            MIKE S MOM
                        (ON SPEAKER, FLUMUXED) Oh. Hi 
                        Lisa. (BEAT) Okay, honey, I ll 
                        talk to you later.



        Mike paces as Ethan grills a hamburger for his dog.

                                            MIKE
                        You hung up too quickly. Now 
                        Lisa s suspicious.

                                            ETHAN
                        I m sorry. I freaked out. I can t 
                        keep track of what Lisa s allowed 
                        to know.

                                            MIKE
                        Nothing. She s allowed to know 
                        nothing. Especially not from you. 
                        (THEN) Look, I m not trying to 
                        bang cocktail waitresses here. I m 
                        just trying to carve out a little 
                        Mike time. And to do that, I have 
                        to be able to control the 
                        information.

                                            ETHAN
                        That s why I got off the phone so 
                        quickly. 

                                            MIKE
                        I m sorry. You know who the real 
                        enemy is here? Technology. And 
                        I ve invited it into my house like 
                        we were friends. Stupid, stupid 
                        cell phone! Stupid email! Our dads 
                        never had to deal with that. My 
                        marriage has coincided with the 
                        greatest erosion of male freedom 
                        in human history.

                                            ETHAN
                        I m calling Adam.

          Ethan looks around for his phone.

                                            MIKE
                        It just sucks. My car was the last 
                        place I could completely relax and 
                        be myself.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    16.

                        You know what really sucks? That 
                        you can t do that in your own 
                        home.

                        Ooh, single guy-- thinks he s 
                        deep. Trust me, one day you ll be

                        right now-- and I m gonna love it.



          CLOSE ON: A large TV screen. A game of Wii Sports boxing 
        is underway. A character that looks like Callie delivers 
          a series of jabs to a character that looks like Adam. 

        PULL BACK TO REVEAL Adam and Callie, playing the game.

                        She s animated!

        The phone rings. It s Ethan. Adam pauses the game and 
          picks up.

                                            ADAM
                        (INTO PHONE) Hey, buddy.

          Ethan hangs up, perplexed.

                        dance has just begun...



        Adam hangs up the phone and carefully puts it down so as 
        to give him time to think of his approach.

                        They want me to join them. Could 
                        be fun... But, you know...

                        She doesn t want him to go. But 
                        she doesn t want to straight out 
                        say that.

                        You should go... if that s what 
                        you want to do.

        Adam tries to think of a good way to respond to this.

                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    18.

                        I m gonna be honest. I think our 
                        boy is out-matched.

                        No, I ll stay. We just moved in. 
                        We re having fun.

        She snuggles into him.

                                            CALLIE
                        I love living with you.

                        I love living with you too.

          While still hugging Adam, Callie moves the wii joystick 
        and knocks out Adam s character on the wii game.

                                            ADAM (CONT D)
                        A sucker punch? Really? That s how 
                        you re gonna play?

          Callie does a playful little victory dance.



        Adam and Callie shop for stuff for their place, 
          surrounded by other couples. Adam points to a table lamp. 
          Callie scrunches her face: that would be a  no.

        Adam gets a text from Ethan:  Wanna go out?  Adam sighs.

        He answers the phone and immediately coughs twice.

        Mike leans back in his chair and enjoys his role of 
           advice giver.  He tries to affect a manner reminiscent 
        of Don Corleone in the opening scene of  The Godfather.

                        But the car phone thing s altered 
                        the balance of power a bit. Let s 
                        go with not telling her. That s 
                        the safer call.



        Mike and Lisa are in the car on the way to work. The

          there. No go. He s got to make small talk.

                        My assistant s gonna give me a 
                        ride home tonight, honey, so I ll 
                        just see you back at home.

        She kisses him and gets out. Mike waits a beat for her to 
        walk away, then immediately calls Adam back, thrilled at 
        the success of their plan.

                                            MIKE
                        Dude, that was amazing.

                                            ADAM
                        (ON SPEAKER) Worst conversation 
                        I ve ever had. Almost fell asleep.

        In the background, we see that Lisa has forgotten 
          something and heads back to the car.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.

          CONTINUED: (2)

                                            MIKE
                        You get the stuff for the 
                        wrestling?

        Lisa opens the car door and gets in. Mike doesn t know 
        how to stop Adam.

                                            ADAM
                        (ON SPEAKER) Yeah, I got the 
                        perfect tights. I m pretty sure 
                        they ll fit you...

        Mike gets more desperate as Lisa looks on, aghast.

                                            ADAM (CONT D)
                        (ON SPEAKER) Oh, and you re gonna 
                        have to snag some of Lisa s 
                        lipstick-- red to match the wig. 
                        The other guys are pretty big so 
                        you might want to wear a shoe with 
                        some heel--

        In desperation, Mike coughs twice. A beat, then:

                                            ADAM (CONT D)
                        (ON SPEAKER) What s up, Lisa?

        Lisa is dumbfounded.

                                            LISA
                        I... I just... I... We ll... I... 

          Unable to string a sentence together, Lisa walks off.



        Adam is hanging pictures in the new place. Callie enters.

                                            ADAM
                        Hey, how d it go with Liz s dog?

                        Had to pull him off a beagle, but 
                        otherwise, uneventful.

                                            ADAM
                        You re a good friend. I hope she 
                        doesn t expect you to walk her dog 
                        every time she has to work late...

          Adam s phone rings. It s Ethan.

                        You have plenty of things to live 
                        for...

          Callie looks over, concerned.



                                            ETHAN
                        (ON PHONE) Yeah, like Monday Night 
                        Football. I got a call into Mike.

                        hold of yourself, Ethan. You ll 
                        meet someone else. I promise.



                                            ETHAN
                        (ON PHONE) Yeah, probably tonight. 
                        Say  maybe  if you re gonna go. 



                                            ADAM
                        (ON PHONE) Maybe. Bye. 

        Adam hangs up.

                        You know what? I m sick of it. He 
                        wants to go out again. But I m 
                        putting my foot down. No.

                        you. We ll both comfort Ethan.

        Adam tries to hide the fact that this is not the outcome 
        he was looking for.

                                            ADAM
                        I don t think that s necessary.

                        He sounds really bad. I m worried 
                        about him.

                                            ADAM
                        He s not that bad.



          Adam, Mike, Callie and Lisa comfort Ethan, who pretends 
        to be heartbroken while sneaking peaks at the game. 
          Callie rubs Ethan s shoulders.

          Ethan looks over forlornly at an attractive woman.

        ACT FOUR



        The gang comfort Ethan, who s really getting into it now.

                        This morning I woke up and found 
                        one of her t-shirts and I just sat 
                        there and cried for two hours.

                        (RUBBING HIS SHOULDERS) Ethan...

        Lisa pulls Mike aside toward the bar.

                                            ETHAN
                        And then I looked in the mirror 
                        and I realized what I was doing. I 
                        was becoming my father. (TO 
                        CALLIE) Could I have a tissue?

        She reaches down to grab one in her purse. Ethan looks at 
        Adam and winks:  how good am I? 

          ANGLE ON: Lisa and Mike sit at the bar. She kisses him.

                                            LISA
                        I m glad you asked me to join.

                        Of course. Ethan s really hurting 
                        and we need everyone here to 
                        comfort him.

                        with everybody. It s been awhile.

        Lisa picks up a quarter, eyes it for a beat, smiles, then 
          bounces the quarter off the bar into Mike s beer glass. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.

                        You know, when we were in college,

                        No, no. No. Adam had to help with 
                        his boss  kid s bar mitzvah by 
                        getting this wrestler to perform 
                        at the party. The wrestler dresses 
                        as a clown. He didn t show up so I 
                        agreed to sub in as the clown.

                        I worked out a lot of possible

        The Bar Mitzvah party. A frenzy of crazed 13 year-olds

                        Okay, Let s work out our moves 
                        here. I ve been studying the 
                        Sawing Clown s work and I thought 
                        I d start with the  circus drop -- 
                        give the kids a good opening.

                                            WRESTLER #2
                        What are you talking about?

                                            MIKE
                        Come on, guys, I know I ve never 
                          technically  wrestled,  but I ve 
                        done some acting. 

                                            WRESTLER #1
                          (STIFFENING AT THE WORD) Acting?

                                            MIKE
                        In college, I understudied the 
                        Tailor in  Fiddler.  

                                            WRESTLER #2
                        We re not actors. We re athletes.

                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    33.

                        (LAUGHING) Sure you are. I was an 
                         athlete  in college too. 
                        (EXITING, CONVINCED THEY RE 
                        KIDDING) Remember I m starting 
                        with the  Circus drop. 



          Ethan is at home. There s a knock on his door. It s 
          Sherry, smiling through tears. She hugs him. 

                                            SHERRY 
                        Callie called me. I had no idea 
                        how much you cared about me. 

        She smothers a bewildered Ethan in kisses.

                                            SHERRY (CONT D)
                        I m not gonna let you become your 
                        father.



        Wild cheering as Mike enters the ring. Mike loves this, 
            acknowledging the crowd by firing up his power saw. The 
          crowd goes wild. The bell rings. Mike approaches the 
          other wrestler, gives him a wink, and is immediately 
          smashed to the ground. In the wings, Adam winces.

                                            MIKE
                        Hey, what are you doing?

                                            WRESTLER #1
                        Acting.

        The wrestler does a drop on Mike as the crowd goes wild. 



          Mike s carried off in a stretcher as Adam runs alongside. 

                                            MIKE
                        Did you hear that applause?

                                            ADAM
                        Yeah, buddy, you were awesome.

        Mike raises himself on the stretcher to acknowledge the 
          crowd. He raises his fist in victory but winces in pain.

                                            ADAM (CONT D)
                        I m so sorry.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.

                                            MIKE
                        Nah, still paying you back for 
                        getting me in that game.

                                            ADAM
                        That was mostly Ben.

                                            MIKE
                        I know.



        Adam and Callie put a new lamp on the side table.

                                            ADAM (V.O.)
                        Sometimes it s yellow-- you slow 
                        down, get your bearings, and ask 
                        yourself if this is someplace 
                        you d like to stop.



        Mike and Lisa put their 3 year-old son to bed.

                                            ADAM (V.O.)
                        And sometimes the light is red-- 
                        you take a moment, look around, 
                        and know that where you are is 
                        already pretty great; is, in fact, 
                        exactly where you need to be.

        Mike smiles at Lisa: this is a good life.



        Mike and Adam are at a bar. Adam calls Ethan as Mike 
          practices bouncing quarters into his glass.

                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

          CONTINUED:

                                            ADAM
                        (INTO PHONE) We re at the bar. You 
                        gonna join us?



          Ethan, phone in hand, is on the couch with Sherry. 

                                            ETHAN
                        (INTO PHONE) We ll see.

          Ethan absentmindedly pulls at the collar of his sweater.



                                            ADAM
                        (INTO PHONE) What do you mean, 
                        we ll see?

          Hearing this, Mike stops bouncing the quarters.



          Ethan looks over at Sherry. 

                                            ETHAN
                        (INTO PHONE) We ll see. 

          Ethan hangs up and turns to Sherry.

                                            ETHAN (CONT D)
                        Poor Adam. He s really depressed 
                        about his job.



        Mike smiles, smug and content.

                                            MIKE
                        He s asking permission.
