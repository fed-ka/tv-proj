      It is after the soccer game and Gloria and Manny are walking
      toward their car.  Jay lags slightly behind.

                    I'm quitting soccer.  It is a game
                    for children.

                    You're not quitting.  You would have
                    stopped that goal if you were staring
                    at that girl again.

                                      MANNY
                    She is not a girl, she's a woman.

                    do you always have to do stuff like

12INTERVIEW -- JAY AND GLORIA

                                      GLORIA
                    Manny is very passionate, like his
                    father.  My first husband was very
                    handsome, but too emotional.  It
                    seemed like all we ever do was fight
                    and make love, fight and make love. 
                    One day, I'm not joking, we fell out
                    the window together.

                                    JAY
                    Which were you doing?  
                          (to camera)
                    I'm hearing this for the first time.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    11.
                                         


      Phil holds the gun.

                                    PHIL
                    What are you wearing?

      Reveal Luke wearing three shirts, a big jacket and two hats.

                                    LUKE
                    Nothing.

                                    PHIL
                    Uh-uh.  Jacket off.  One shirt, one
                    hat.  No pain, no gain.  Jesus, how
                    many pairs of underwear do you have on?

                                    LUKE
                    One.  
                          (then)
                    Six.


      Luke is down to one layer of clothes.  Phil has the gun.

                                    PHIL
                    I want you to know, I'm not enjoying
                    this.  But it's an important lesson
                    you're learning.

      He begins to pace off steps away from the nervous Luke.


      Phil is finishing his paces, then turns.

                                    LUKE
                    You're too close.  It's going to
                    hurt.

                                    PHIL
                    It's supposed to.

                                    LUKE
                    Why are you smiling?


      Phil has the gun trained on Luke, then:

                                    PHIL
                    Oh, forget it.  I can't do this. 
                    The point is you're scared, and I
                    think you've learned your lesson
                    just by --        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    24.
                                         

      BANG!  The gun fires, and Luke yelps.

                                    PHIL (CONT'D)
                    Wow.


      Phil is tending to Luke's injury, still holding the gun.

                                    LUKE
                    You hit my bone!

                                    PHIL
                    It was an accident!        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    25.
                                         

      Haley comes out.

                                      HALEY
                    Dad, you have got to talk to Mom! 
                    She is like completely freaking out
                    and embarrassing me!

                                    PHIL
                    Well honey, your Mom isn't always as
                    cool about things as I am --

      Dylan steps outside, joining Haley, and Phil accidentally
      fires the gun again, hitting him.

                                      DYLAN
                    Owww!

      He falls to the ground.

                                    PHIL
                    What is with this thing?

                                      HALEY
                    Oh.  My.  God.

34INTERVIEW -- MITCHELL & CAMERON (THEIR CONDO)

                    I've got good reason to be nervous. 
                    I'm having flashbacks to when I told
                    my family I was gay.  My mom cried
                    for a week and my Dad still does
                    this thing where he announces himself
                    before walking into any room we're
                    in to make sure he doesn't see
                    anything.

                    My parents always knew.  My mother
                    says she was in labor with me for

                          (having noticed her
                            outfit)
                    Wow, that's a beautiful skirt, Gloria.

                                      GLORIA
                    Oh, thank you.  It's suede, Pheel.

      He feels her skirt. 

                                    PHIL
                          (hearing "feel")
                    Ooh, it's --

      Claire slaps his hand away.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Phil!  That's how she says "Phil". 

      The lights dim.

                    What the hell's going on?

      MUSIC CUE: LION KING "CIRCLE OF LIFE"

      Everybody turns.  Cameron enters holding Lily.  In time to
      the music, he dramatically raises her toward the heavens. 
      They all look at one another, mystified.

                                      MITCHELL
                    We adopted a baby.

                                      CLAIRE
                    What?!

                                      MITCHELL
                    That's why we went to Vietnam.  Her
                    name is Lily.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    29.

                    Oh my god, look at the little angel!

                                      CLAIRE
                    She's yours?!

                                      MITCHELL
                    I know.  I can't believe it either.

                                    PHIL
                    Hi, Lily.  
                          (TO MITCHELL & CAM)
                    Isn't that going to be tough for her
                    to say?

                                      HALEY
                    She's so cute.

                          (to Haley)
                    You could totally have one, you know.

      Cameron brings Lily over to Jay.

                                      MITCHELL
                    So... what do you think, grandpa?  

      Everybody turns to see Jay's reaction.

                                    JAY
                    I gotta admit I never thought I'd
                    get a baby out of you two.  
                          (he takes Lily)
                    You're a cute little fortune cookie,
                    aren't ya? 
                          (then)
                    Okay.  That's wet.  Someone take
                    him.

                                      MITCHELL
                    Her, Dad.  I'll change her.  

                                      CLAIRE
                    Let me help.
