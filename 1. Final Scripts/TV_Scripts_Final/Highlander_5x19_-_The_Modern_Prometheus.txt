      FADE IN.

17011701EXT.  STADIUM  - STAGE DOOR  -  NIGHT

      A crowd of rock FANS mill impatiently outside the stage door. 
      Some of them wear tour t-shirts with "LORD BYRON AND THE
      UNDEAD" emblazoned in blood red.

      The stage door opens, the fans surge forward.  Two SECURITY
      GUYS move them back as

      LORD BYRON emerges, primed to brave the gauntlet.  Early
      30's, he carries a gold-handled CANE to ease his lame right
      foot.  His brooding eyes blaze with adrenalin, his slim body
      glistens with sweat.  TWO GROUPIES, rabid with excitement,
      shriek his name...

                                      GROUPIES
                    Byron!  Byron!

      He whirls, stares right at them -- they GASP, awe-struck by
      his presence.  More than a man, he's a force of nature.

      Suddenly, one young man, JERRY, breaks through the security
      cordon.  He rushes up to Byron, breathless with excitement. 
      He holds a cassette tape in his hands.

                                      JERRY
                    Did you get my tape?
                          (beat)
                    I'm Jerry.  Jerry Garrity.

      Two muscled Security Guards quickly step in and pull Jerry
      back.

                                      JERRY (CONT'D)
                          (as he's pulled away)
                    "End your confusion, love a man, not
                    an illusion."

                                      BYRON
                          (finishing the lyric)
                    "I could never be all that you dream. 
                          (to the Guards)
                    It's okay.

      They release Jerry.

                                      JERRY
                    You listened to it.

                                      BYRON
                    I thought it was great.

      His voice is deep-throated, hypnotic.  His arm wraps around
      Jerry's shoulder, draws him closer.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    C'mon, Jerry.  Let's go for a ride.

                                      JERRY
                    This is for real.

      Byron guides him to his limo.  One of the Security guys opens
      the door.

                                      BYRON
                    As real as it, gets.

      They get in the limo, pull out into the Paris night.

17021702EXT.  PARIS ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

      Silhouetted against the deep blue-black sky, a FIGURE balances
        tightrope-style along a rain-slicked rooftop.

      It's Lord Byron.  The wind whips his hair around like an
      angry demented thing.  He raises a whiskey bottle, tips his
      head back, drenches his face in alcohol.

                                      BYRON
                    The pause that refreshes.

      He turns, offers the bottle to

      JERRY

      clutching white-knuckled onto a chimney top behind him. 
      Jerry's had a few and tries to focus.

                                      BYRON
                    Come and get it.

      Jerry gulps.

                                      JERRY
                          (beat)
                    Okay.

      He pushes off, teeters slowly towards Byron.

      WHOOSH!  A startled flock of pigeons swoop across the roof. 
      Jerry slips, loses his balance, slides towards the edge.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96517  "The Modern Prometheus"   3.  Final Shooting Script 1/7/97

1702CONTINUED:1702

      A HAND shoots out, grabs him by the arm.  Byron pulls him
      back up to safety.  Jerry's shaken, grateful, hanging on to
      Byron for dear life.

                                      JERRY (CONT'D)
                    You saved my life.

      They sit down oh the roof ledge, legs dangling over the edge. 
      Jerry looks down into the abyss... five stories to the ground. 
      Byron hands him the whiskey.

                                      BYRON
                    That's what it s about.  Living close
                    to the edge.
                          (beat)
                    Drink.

      Jerry does as ordered.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Better?

                                      JERRY
                    Sure.  Great.  Can we talk about the
                    music?

                                      BYRON
                          (not hearing him)
                    You ready?

                                      JERRY
                    Huh?

      A dark gleam in his eyes, Byron points across the alley to
      another rooftop, several yards away.

                                      BYRON
                    Let's jump.  Then we'll go lay down
                    some tracks.
                          (beat)
                    You and me.  Damon and Pythias.
                          (Jerry doesn't get it)
                    Batman and Robin.

      Jerry gets it, but hesitates.  Looks across, gauging the
      distance, then looks back to Byron, who sighs his
        disappointment.  He stands up.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    If you're not living, you're dying.

      Jerry looks up at Byron, then over the edge again.

                                      JERRY
                    I'm cool.  Really.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96517  "The Modern Prometheus"   4.  Final Shooting Script 1/7/97

1702CONTINUED: (2)1702

      Byron extends his hand.  Jerry slowly reaches out and takes
      it.

      Next thing he knows, he's on his feet looking up at the man
      he so desperately admires.  Byron's eyes, his wicked smile,
      they blast through his fear, through his doubt.

      Jerry swallows hard.  He nods, almost imperceptibly -- an
      acknowledgment of Byron's power, and a surrender of his own. 
      Byron saw it.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Good.

                    Batman and Robin.

                                      BYRON
                    No guts, no glory.

      Byron leads him a few steps back.  Then with a running start,
      they...

      JUMP.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Geronimo!

      Jerry SCREAMS as they fly through the night air...

      LEGS KICKING, searching for a foothold,

      HANDS FLAILING, desperate for purchase,

      FINGERS REACHING OUT, straining for something solid to grab
      hold of...

      Something please God something anything...

      Nothing.  They both fall short, plummeting to the pavement
      five stories below.

17031703EXT.  ALLEY - NIGHT

      THWUNK.  Two crumpled bodies kiss the concrete.

      After a moment, Byron COUGHS back to life.  He gets up, dusts
      himself off.  He looks down at Jerry's lifeless body like a
      child looks at a broken toy.

                                      BYRON
                    That was a very good try.

      Byron picks up his cane and disappears into the evening mist.

      FADE IN:

17041704INT.  BLUES CLUB  -  NIGHT

      Dim lights struggle against the blue haze of Gitanes.  On
      stage, MIKE PALADINO, early twenties, plays guitar with
      Dawson's bass and drum player to a small after hours crowd. 
      Mike's eyes are closed, his fingers dance over the frets in
      a reverie that is a cross between magic and a religious
      experience.

      At a table not far from the stage, METHOS, DAWSON and MACLEOD.

                                      MACLEOD
                    This kid's great.

                                      DAWSON
                    We picked him up in London.  He came
                    to every show, every night.

                                      METHOS
                    No accounting for taste.

                                      DAWSON
                    This is the first time he's been
                    onstage.  He was with us for/two
                    weeks hauling amps for a bus ticket
                    before we even found out he played.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He plays.
                          (beat)
                    Just look at him.

                                      DAWSON
                    Never gets tight or nervous.  Just
                    lays it out.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Nervous?  He's already forgotten
                    anybody else is here.
                          (beat; to Methos)
                    Remember what that's like?

                                      METHOS
                    I never played guitar.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's not what I mean.
                          (beat)
                    To be so lost in what you're doing
                    that there's no time, no space.

      Methos takes a drink of beer, plays it cool.

                                      METHOS
                    There's a greeting card in there
                      somewhere.
                          (off MacLeod's look)
                    I don't remember, but I wish I did.

      MAURICE stops by MacLeod's table.  He's the Manager of the
      club.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What do you think, Maurice?

                                      MAURICE
                    Your friend plays well.

                                      MACLEOD
                    C'mon, Maurice, book him for a night
                    or two as an opening act.

                                      DAWSON
                    The kid's got chops.

      Maurice nods, listens to something in the music.

                                      MAURICE
                    He has more.  He has passion.  It's
                    a gift.
                          (knowing eyebrow)
                    And a curse, n est-ce pas?

      BUZZ.  MacLeod and Methos look toward the doors.  Byron enters
      with two beautiful GIRLS, one hanging on each arm.  A murmur
      of recognition ripples through the crowd.

      Methos reacts.  A little smile.  Byron spots him and heads
      their way.

                                      METHOS
                    Well, well.  Look who's here.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Who's that?

                                      DAWSON
                    Byron.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So that's Lord Byron.

      Byron reaches their table, grabs Methos' hand warmly.

                                      BYRON
                    Doc!  It's been ages.

                                      METHOS
                    You've become quite famous again.

      Byron brushes it aside.

                                      BYRON
                    Can't seem to shake it.

      Methos handles the introductions.

                                      METHOS
                    Duncan MacLeod.  Joe Dawson.

      Byron and MacLeod shake.

                                      BYRON
                    Any friend of Doc's...

      MacLeod takes in Byron -- dressed in black leather, a cape,
      sporting a cane -- and his spandex-clad entourage.  He's not
      impressed.

                    Charmed.

      But Dawson beams...

                                      DAWSON
                    My pleasure!  Been a big fan of yours
                    for a long time.

                                      BYRON
                    In that case, let me buy you a drink.
                          (to Maurice)
                      Champagne.  For everyone.

      Maurice moves off.

      Byron smiles a twisted smile.  He maneuvers the two Girls
      into chairs and takes a seat at the table.

      ON STAGE

      Mike finishes to wild applause.

                                      BYRON
                          (re: Mike)
                    Who's the kid?
                          (without waiting for
                          an answer)
                    He's not bad.

      Mike comes bouncing back to their table, pumped.

                                    MIKE

                                    MIKE
                    Thanks, Joe, I --

      His eyes land on Byron, widen in recognition.  Byron smiles
        expansively.

                                      BYRON
                    Great chops, kid.

      Mike's in heaven.

                          (overwhelmed)
                    I've got all your CDs, man.  Even
                    the imports.

      It's a love-fest.  Dawson grins, punches Methos in the
      shoulder.

17051705EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - SWITZERLAND - 1816 - DAY

      Byron rides along in an open carriage with his lover, CLAIRE
      CLAIRMONT.  They kiss deeply, lustily.

      Methos (known then as DOCTOR BENJAMIN ADAMS) YAWNS
        ostentatiously.  Claire GIGGLES.  Byron comes up for air.

                                      BYRON
                    I fear the good Doctor grows weary
                    of our entertainments.

                                      METHOS
                    As spectator, surely.  As participant,
                    never.

      Claire SQUEALS with mock horror, swats Methos playfully with
      her fan.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Doctor Adams!  Your effrontery shocks
                    me.

                                      BYRON
                    Shocked, are you?  You would be more
                    so if you saw him at his labors.

      Byron snuggles up to Claire again, breathes down her neck.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Cutting open corpses, up to his elbows
                    in rotting flesh and maggoty entrails.

                                      CLAIRE
                          (recoils)
                    No!  Truly!?

      Methos nods matter of factly.

                                      METHOS
                    There are certain questions about
                    life only the dead can answer.

                                      BYRON
                    Only the dead... and poets!

                                      METHOS
                    Then I shall have my answers when
                    the Shelleys arrive.

                                      BYRON
                    Rather, Percy Shelley and that woman-
                    child, Mary, he calls wife that you
                    seem so interested in seducing.

      They pass a couple of YOUNG GIRLS walking on the road.  The
      Young Girls recognize Byron, call out his name.

                                      YOUNG GIRLS
                    Byron!  Lord Byron!

      Byron rises to the occasion, takes the reins in one hand,
      rips off his cravat with the other, shouts...

                    "This Band, which bound thy yellow
                    hair, Is mine, sweet girl!  Thy pledge
                    of love; It claims my warmest, dearest
                    care, Like relics left of saints
                    above."

      He flings the cravat to the excited Girls and WHIPS the horses
      to a canter.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Hah!

      Suddenly, Methos and Byron get the BUZZ as

      ANOTHER COACH

      races up behind them.

      HANS KERSHNER

      a tall, powerful Immortal, is at the reins.

                                      METHOS
                          (to Byron)
                    You know him?

                                      BYRON
                    Hans Kershner.  He thinks I slept
                    with his wife.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Did you?

                                      BYRON
                          (with laughter)
                    of course!

      Byron looks to Methos.  He smiles wickedly.

                                      METHOS
                          (to Claire)
                    Hold on.

      Byron whips his horses.  They take off.  Meanwhile, in the
      other carriage

      KERSHNER

      takes the challenge and WHIPS his team up to match Byron's
      speed.  The race is on!

      Claire SCREAMS in delight, holding fast to her bonnet as the
      carriages buck and sway dangerously.

      BYRON

      is clearly thrilled by the chase as

      KERSHNER

      races up along side him, scowling.

      BYRON

      slows just a little, then drives his carriage into Kershner's.

      WHEEL HUBS knock and GRIND against each other on the narrow
      lane.  Kirshner desperately tries to hold his ground, but
      fails.  His carriage is driven off the road and crashes. 
      Kershner jumps at the last minute to safety.

      As Byron's carriage madly races in the distance, his mad
      laughter echoes.

      The carriage races up at a gallop.  Claire's voice screams
      its excitement.  Finally, the carriage halts.

      Byron, Claire and Methos tumble out of the carriage, shaken,
      breathless -- and pumped with excitement.

                                      BYRON
                    Am I as dangerous as my reputation,
                    Doctor?

                                      METHOS
                          (laughing)
                    You are mad.
                          (a significant glance
                          at Claire)
                    Are you trying to get us killed?

      Byron's eyes sparkle, his body quivering in a kind of
      exquisite ecstasy.  A mad, brilliant smile.

                                      BYRON
                    You speak of death.

      He taps the head of his cane on Methos' chest.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Yet note how quickly your heart beats. 
                    You seem more alive than ever!

      Byron draws the delighted Claire to him, kisses her roughly. 
      He pulls Claire into a passionate embrace, then they run
      laughing into the villa.96517  "The Modern Prometheus"   13.  Final Shooting Script 1/7/97

17071707EXT.  VILLA DIODATI - SWITZERLAND - PATIO - 1816 - DAY

      A dramatic sky overhangs the stone cornices of the old villa. 
      A storm is approaching, bringing distant thunder.

                                      BYRON
                          (dramatic reading)
                    The bloated mass of flesh that was
                    his body stumbled toward me.  His
                    shrill and piercing voice screaming
                    my name.  I ran in terror until my
                    legs were leaden.

      Scattered about on various chaises, Lord Byron, Claire
      Clairmont, and Methos are joined by PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY,
      small, delicate of frame, with a consumptive complexion, and
      beautiful MARY SHELLEY, listening intently, her intelligent
      eyes darting excitedly around, recording every detail.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    And I could run no more.  I turned
                    and looked into the lifeless eyes
                    and the bloodless face that was my
                    own.  I screamed.  I was already
                    dead.

      Claire applauds happily; Byron shoots her a disgusted look.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    What drivel.
                          (beat)
                    God, I bore even myself!

      Byron tosses the handwritten sheets aside.

                                      SHELLEY
                    I thought it was wonderful.  And for
                    the evening's entertainment...

      Shelley starts to pass Byron a pipe filled with opium.  Byron
      waves it away.

                                      BYRON
                    It will take more than Morpheus'
                    smoke to quiet me tonight.

      Mary turns to Methos in an attempt to change the subject.

                                    MARY
                    I trust you had a pleasant journey
                    this afternoon, sir.

                                      CLAIRE
                    I love to dance.

                    What have you to cure a troubled
                    spirit?  For mine has been wounded
                    in life's battles.

      Claire giggles.

                                      CLAIRE
                    You cannot wound a spirit.

      Byron pulls a pistol from a desk.  In a flash he's across
      the patio, the barrel of the pistol pressed against Claire.

                                      BYRON
                    Shall we test your theory, my little
                    nymph?  Shall I kill you here and
                    now?

      Claire gasps.  Methos jumps to his feet.

                                      METHOS
                    I think we've taken this game a little
                    far.

                    Shall I see your spirit rise up before
                    me?  And pluck it from the air?

                                      METHOS

                    I only meant... I only...

      Under Methos' glare, Byron relents and lowers the pistol. 
      Claire breaks down, sobbing.  Mary rushes to her side, holds
      her.

      Shelley produces a vial of laudanum, passes it to Claire who
      sips delicately.  Her sobbing quiets.  Byron is manic with
      energy.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)

      He raises his pistol and fires.  A small statue SHATTERS.

      Lightning clashes.  Wind howls.  The old Villa looks like a
      castle against the stormy sky.

                                      BYRON (O.S.)
                    Every one, come!  Come!

17081708INT.  VILLA DIODATI - DRAWNIG ROOM - NIGHT

      A roaring fire casts the room in an eerie light.  Byron stands
      by the fireplace, book in hand.  Methos, entering, looks at
      Byron with amused suspicion.  The others straggle in behind
      him.

                                      METHOS
                    What are you up to now?

                                      BYRON
                    It is time for more stories.

      He dramatically throws the book into the fire.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Let us call forth the armies of the
                    night and do them battle, soul to
                    soul, until they or we call hold,
                    enough, and give over the field.

                                      SHELLEY
                    Sounds thrilling.

      Mary reacts, exchanging a look with Methos -- less thrilled.

                                      METHOS
                    Sounds morbid.

                                      SHELLEY
                    Let us bring forth our own ghosts
                    from deep within us.  From those
                    dead humors rattling round the
                    midnight of our souls.

      Byron turns his gaze directly on Mary.

1708CONTINUED:1708

                                      BYRON
                    Who's next?  The quiet "Mrs. Shelley?"

                                    MARY
                    You mock me, sir, but I have known
                    death.  I have held it in my arms.
                          (beat)
                    I hope never to feel the like again.

                                      BYRON
                    But feel you did.  In tasting grief,
                    in tasting fear, is that not the
                    time we truly live?
                          (a challenge)
                    So, fair muse, what ghosts have you
                    to share tonight?

      Mary's confidence wilts in the blinding spotlight of Byron's
      attention.  She turns her eyes away.

                                    MARY
                    I'm afraid my imagination fails me
                    at present.

                                      BYRON
                    But look, dear lady.  Your neighbor
                    greedily gulps the nectar of
                      creativity itself.

      He takes the vial of laudanum from Claire and offers it to
      Mary.  Conscious all eyes are on her, Mary seizes it boldly. 
      She takes a quick sniff, then drinks deeply.

      Almost immediately, her eyes glaze over, she begins to tremble
      violently.  Byron glares at her suspiciously.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    What melodrama is this?

      Shelley giggles in a drunken stupor.  Claire dances to music
      only she can hear.

      But Methos sits up, concerned.  Mary begins to CHOKE
        uncontrollably.  He rushes to her side and supports her as
      her breathing eases.

                                      METHOS
                          (to Shelley)
                    I think your wife has had enough,
                    sir.

      Shelley, too drunk to help, waves a languid hand.

                    hands I commend her spirit.

      With a snort of disgust, Methos turns his back on Shelley
      and scoops the swooning Mary into his arms.

17091709INT.  VILLA DIODATI - BEDROOM - LATER - 1816

      A barely conscious Mary tosses in her bed.  Confused, blinking
      through her laudanum haze, she looks up at Methos, who stands
      over her.

                                    MARY
                    Am I dead?

      Methos smiles.

                                      METHOS
                    If you are, then I must be an angel,
                    and that's the one thing I'm not.

                                    MARY
                    All this talk of death and ghosts.

      She begins to get drowsy again.

                                    MARY (CONT'D)
                    I had a baby once.  Clara.
                          (beat)
                    I dreamt she came back to life.
                          (through labored
                            breaths.)
                    With a beak for a mouth, snarling
                    teeth and claws for hands.

                                      METHOS
                    It was only a dream.

                                    MARY
                      Sometimes...
                          (she swallows)
                    Sometimes I wonder who is more
                      unhappy... those who die?  Or those
                    who live.

      She shivers.  He softly strokes her hair, comforting her.

                                      METHOS
                    You are wiser than you know.

      He pulls the covers up, tenderly tucking her in.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Perhaps, dear Mary... death is not
                    truly journey's end, but merely
                    another bend in the road.
                          (beat)
                    If we truly believe that, we can
                    live without fear.

      Her eyes closer she drops off into sleep.

                                      BYRON (O.S.)
                    Bravo!  Bravo!

      Byron stands in the doorway, applauding and smirking at
      Methos.

                                      METHOS
                          (a whispered hiss)
                    Be still!

      Byron sits on the bed beside the barely conscious Mary.  He
      fondles her hair.

                                      BYRON
                    Still.  So quiet.  Almost like death.

      His hand slips along her side, drifts down to her leg.  Mary
      stirs in response.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Yet look!  She stirs.  Is she not
                      beautiful?

                                      METHOS
                    That she is.

      Byron places Methos' hand on Mary's breast.  Methos lets it
      stay for a moment, his eyes going from Byron's face to Mary's. 
      Finally he takes the hand away.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Let her rest.

      Byron's fingers trace the line of her leg up to her inner
      thigh.  Mary MOANS softly.

                                      BYRON
                    But would she want to sleep?  I say
                    we take her, and push the bounds of
                    our rapture to heaven itself.

      Methos is tempted, but resists.

                                      METHOS
                    I think we should leave before we
                    push the bounds of decency.

      Byron laughs, and starts to unbutton Mary's gown.

                                      BYRON
                    Decency means nothing.  All that
                    matters is this moment, the three of
                    us here, in this room.
                          (with passion)
                    Look at her, feel her hunger.
                          (beat)
                    What's the point in living if we
                    don't taste what life offers us?

      He kisses Mary, deeply.

                                      METHOS
                    Enough!

      Methos tears him away from Mary.

                                      BYRON
                    How dare you!
                          (beat)
                    This is my home.  My life.  I will
                    do with it as I choose.
                          (with a smile)
                    Unless you choose to stop me.

      With catlike grace, Byron draws his sword from his cane,
      holds it at the ready.  Methos shakes his head, does not
      answer the challenge.

                                      METHOS
                    Put it away and leave her be.  I'd
                    rather have your poetry than your
                    head.

      There's an edge of steel.  Something in the voice.  There's
      no sword in his hand, but Byron sees the tip of the iceberg
      of something he doesn't want to mess with.  He petulantly
      sheathes his sword.

                                      BYRON
                    Very well.  As a favor to you.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

                    Clapton was in my head and I was

      Mike's enthusiastic response is cut off as the club door
      opens again and Byron and the Girls emerge, heading for their
      waiting limo.

                    How do you like it?

      Wide-eyed Mike looks down.

                                    MIKE
                    I'm too scared to tell.

                                      BYRON
                    Hah!  Of course you are!  Scared...
                    to... DEATH!

      He flings his arms wide like some giant leather bird of prey.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Suck it in, man!  Savor the fear!

      Mike hesitates.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    You can do this.

                    Look deep.  Let it fly.

      Mike gets caught up in the moment.  He mimics Byron, arms
      outstretched, head thrown back.  The wind whips his hair.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    That's it.

                    in your mouth... and spit it out!

      Mike lives a moment of sweet ecstasy...

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Feel it.

      Then, Mike slips.  Loses his footing, topples off the rail --

      Byron catches him by his belt, pulls him back to safety.  He
      spins Mike around, grips his face, locks on with those tractor
      beam eyes of his.  A voice like dark thunder...

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    You were there.

      Mike nods excitedly.

                                    MIKE
                    What a rush!  What s next?

                                      BYRON
                    Now you are alive.  Now we play!

17121712INT.  BYRON'S PENTHOUSE LOFT - NIGHT

      Decorated in eclectic Punk-Gothic.  Oversized windows show
      the lights of Paris.  Giant modernistic CANDELABRAS throw
      molten half-light on twisted shapes of furniture.  Bizarre
      works of ART dot the walls (Monet meets Kandinsky),
        interspersed with various ro ck and movie POSTERS.  One of
      them is an oversized poster of "Frankenstein."  The overall
      effect is sensual, exciting... but also unsettling.

      An UNEARTHLY WAIL rips through the air.

      Mike riffs drunkenly on his guitar.  A near-empty glass of
      whiskey sits at his elbow.

      Something moves across the room.  A dark, squirming mass of
      human limbs.  A MOAN.  A SHRIEK.  Pleasure?  Pain?

      The shadows shift.

      It's Byron and the Girls playing Kama Sutra - The Home Game. 
      Byron unravels himself, applauds Mike s playing.

                                      BYRON
                    Bravo!  You are the man.

      Mike's got whiskey tongue.

                                    MIKE
                    Uh... thanks.  You really think so?

                                      BYRON
                    I said so.
                          (to one of the Girls)
                    Didn't I say so?

      She nods.  The Girls float over, snuggle up to Mike, now
      duly baptized by the Master.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                          (back to Mike)
                    You're coming by the studio tomorrow,
                    right?  Sit in on some tracks.  Meet
                    some people.

                                    MIKE
                          (going for cool)
                    You know it.

      Byron pulls out a small packet, raises it high above his
      head.

                                      BYRON
                    Nightcap, anyone?

      He snorts a pinch of white powder, offers it next to Mike. 
      Mike shakes his head.

                                    MIKE
                    Thanks, but... I don't think so.  I,
                    uh, I oughta get going.

      Byron's eyes turn to ice.

                                      BYRON
                    That's cool.

                                    MIKE
                    So... what time tomorrow?

                                      BYRON
                          (cool)
                    Actually, tomorrow's a little busy. 
                    But my manager'll send you a coupla
                    tickets for the show.

      He turns his back on Mike.  A silent signal.  The Girls drift
      back to Byron, sidestepping Mike like fresh roadkill.

      Disappointed, Mike grabs his guitar, weaves toward the door.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Don't know what you're missing.

      Mike turns around.  Byron's smiling face floats an inch away. 
      His eyes flash like Fourth of July fireworks.  Inside, Mike
      feels himself slipping off that railing again.  Slipping and
      falling.  Into Byron's eyes, Byron's smile... how bad could
      it be?

      He puts out his hand, takes the packet of white powder.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    You're the man.

      FADE IN:

17131713INT.  BLUES CLUB - DAY

      It's early in the day, the club is empty.  Except for Dawson
      and his band practicing on stage for an audience of MacLeod
      and Methos.  Maurice putters around behind the bar.

      Mike enters, high as a kite.  He heads for the stage, starts
      taking out his guitar.  Everyone stops playing and looks at
      him.

                                      DAWSON
                    You're late.

                                    MIKE
                    Sorry.

                                      DAWSON
                    You don't want to do this, just say
                    so.

                                    MIKE
                    No, man, I'm ready.

      He runs a couple of chords.  With a shrug, Joe signals his
      guys and they start playing.  Mike joins in, but he's sloppy,
      fighting to keep up, squinting at his instrument.  Yesterday's
      magic is nowhere in sight.

      MacLeod and Methos exchange a look, realizing, just as

      DAWSON

      stops playing and puts a hand on Mike's arm, stopping him.

                                    MIKE
                    What?

                                      DAWSON
                    Maybe you should get some sleep. 
                    We'll do this later.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Tough night?

                                    MIKE
                    It was hot.  You should've heard me. 
                    Byron said I was awesome.  I was
                    flying.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I think you still are.

      MacLeod and Dawson share a look.

                                      DAWSON
                          (beat)
                    He give you something to help you
                    along?

                                    MIKE
                    What do you mean, man?

                                      DAWSON
                    Look...

      Dawson takes a deep breath, decides to take the plunge.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    Maybe this is none of my business.

      Mike sees it coming, starts to squirm.

                                    MIKE
                    Maybe it isn't.  You should have
                    heard me.  I was never better.

                                      DAWSON
                    Getting high doesn't help your
                    playing.  You just think it does.

                                    MIKE
                    You accusing me of something?

                                      DAWSON,
                    Nothing I haven t done myself.  And
                    paid for.  Words of wisdom... take
                    'em or leave 'em.

      Mike gets his back up.

                                    MIKE
                    Look, man.  We re talking about
                    Byron.  You should be happy for me,
                    not bitching at me.

      He storms off, almost knocking Maurice down as he exits. 
      Dawson looks after him in frustration.

                                      DAWSON
                    Screwed that up, didn't I?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Somebody did.

      He looks over at Methos, waiting.  With a sigh, Methos stands
      up.

                                      METHOS
                    I'll go talk to Byron.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'll join you.
                          (off Methos' reaction)
                    Just to make sure he listens.

                                      DAWSON
                    Thanks, guys.

      They exit.  Dawson picks up his guitar, but his heart's not
      in it, he doesn't play.

      Maurice, wiping a nearby table, looks up at Dawson.

                                      MAURICE
                    You are worried.

                                      DAWSON
                    Damn right.  Kid's in a tough place.

                                      MAURICE
                    To play the great music, one must
                    embrace life, yes?

                                      DAWSON
                    The good and the bad, hallelujah.

                                      MAURICE
                    I was a young man, working in my
                    Uncle's club, the first time I heard
                    Charlie Parker.
                          (beat)
                    Sometimes the man is not as strong
                    as the music.

      Maurice shrugs his world weary shoulders, moves off, leaving
      a troubled Dawson on stage.

17141714INT.  BYRON'S PENTHOUSE LOFT - DAY

      Lord Byron lays down the law to his MANAGER, who scribbles
      notes furiously on a pad as Byron is lambasting him.

                                      BYRON
                    Life, my friend, is in the details. 
                    I like almonds, not cashews.

      MacLeod and Methos enter mid-harangue.  Byron stabs the air
      with his cane for emphasis.  It's clear he's just busting
      the guy's chops.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Shelled, roasted, unsalted.

1714CONTINUED:1714

      Methos watches this display with bemusement, but MacLeod
      registers a scowl of distaste.  Byron plays up the moment
      for their benefit.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    And fed to me by women... Tall
                    women... With long black hair...
                          (beat)
                    I know you want to make me happy.

      The Manager scampers off.  Byron relaxes, all calm and grace,
      turns to MacLeod and Methos.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                      Afternoon, boys.

                                      METHOS
                    Still lacerating the help, I see.

                                      BYRON
                    Ahhh, it's good to be the Star.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You and Mike had quite a session
                    last night.

                                      BYRON
                    Kid's got a good shot.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's why we're here.

      Byron ignores MacLeod, pulls out another packet of white
      powder and offers it to his guests.

                                      METHOS
                    Pass.

                                      BYRON
                    Got to rev the motor or you're just
                    idling.
                          (beat)
                    Don't know how you guys live without
                    it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Just fine, thanks.  And so did Mike. 
                    At least until last night.

      Byron snorts some coke, reacts.

                                      BYRON
                    Whoa!  That's better.  Immortality
                    gets pretty damn dull after the first
                    couple centuries, doesn't it?

      He sniffs, wipes his nose, refocuses on Methos.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    What's the secret, Doc?  What do you
                    do when there's nothing left but the
                    deep, cold emptiness that stretches
                    for centuries behind us... when you
                    look in the mirror and all you see
                    is the abomination that you are.

      Methos doesn't answer.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

      Mary stands by the door to the drawing room.  She appears
      tentative, unsure of entering.

      Footsteps behind her.  She turns.  It's Methos.  He offers
      her his arm.

                                      METHOS
                    Shall we?

                                    MARY
                      I confess, I'm afraid to go in.

                                      METHOS
                    It's just his way of being
                      entertaining.
                          (beat)
                    They're only ghost stories.

                                    MARY
                    Told by master wordsmiths.  Lord
                    Byron's words are things that will
                    live forever.  What have I to offer
                    in such company?

                                      METHOS
                    Your heart.  Your dreams.
                          (beat)
                    Your nightmares.

      Mary turns sharply.  Something in his voice.  A confession?

                                    MARY
                    Is that where you found your story?

      Methos nods slowly.

                                    MARY (CONT'D)
                    Pray, tell me.

      He shakes his head.

                                      METHOS
                    Not now.

      He gently takes her hand and pulls her toward the drawing
      room.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Come, let us show Byron and Shelley
                    that they do not have the only
                    creative minds of the day.

17161716INT.  VILLA DIODATI - DRAWING ROOM - 1816 - NIGHT

      Claire, stoned and drunk, dress falling off her shoulders,
      plays the piano for Shelley, Byron and Dr. Polidori.  As
      Methos and Mary enter, Byron stands, aims his cane in their
      direction.

                                      BYRON
                    We began to despair of your company.

      He bends over Shelley's ear, whispers loudly so all can hear.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Hark, Percy!  The good Doctor is in
                    love with your Mary.  What say you
                    to that?

      Shelley raises a glass of claret in a drunken toast.

                                      SHELLEY
                    I say run!  And fleet be thy feet. 
                    Fly from love, that horned beast
                    that impales all men!

      Mary looks stricken, but says nothing -- this isn't the first
      wound she's received at Shelley's hand.

      Methos is about to retort when he gets the BUZZ.  His eyes
      meet Byron's -- another Immortal.  Byron moves to him.

                                      BYRON
                          (sotto)
                    It seems my destiny awaits.
                          (to the assembled
                            company)
                    With your permission, my friends.

      He takes Methos by the arm and they leave the drawing room
      together, Mary's eyes following them out.96517  "The Modern Prometheus"   31.  Final Shooting Script 1/7/97



17171717INT.  VILLA DIODATI - HALLWAY  - 1816 - CONTINUOUS

      Methos and Byron move toward the front door.

                                      METHOS
                    The jealous husband?

      They reach the door.  Someone is pounding on it from outside. 
      Byron pulls it open to reveal Hans Kershner, soaked to the
      skin from the storm outside.

                                      BYRON
                    Hans, good friend!  Come, man.  Warm
                    thy sodden self by my fire.

      WHAM!

      Kershner lets loose with a roundhouse punch.  Knocks Byron
      on his ass.

                                      KERSHNER
                    That is for my wife!

      Kershner draws his sword.

                                      KERSHNER (CONT'D)
                    Defend yourself!

      Byron makes a show of standing shakily, leaning heavily on
      his cane, favoring his lame foot.

                                      BYRON
                    Alas, my good man, I am a poet, not
                      a warrior.

                                      KERSHNER
                    What you are is a cuckolding cripple.

      Byron whips his sword out suddenly, coming erect, putting
      paid to the image of a man too lame to fight.

                                      BYRON
                    Try me, and you shall see the poet's
                    mettle.

      Methos hastily tries to intervene.

                                      METHOS
                          (to Byron)

                    way.
                          (to Kershner)
                    Think, man, who this is.  Would you
                    be Lord Byron's murderer?

                    He shall be Lord Byron's first
                    conquest.

      Kershner draws his own sword.

                                      KERSHNER
                    Try me then, boy.

      Methos is forced to dodge out from between the two combatants
      as

      BYRON

      makes the first lunge, driving Kershner through the door and
      out onto

17181718EXT.  VILLA DIODATI - PATIO - 1816 - CONTINUOUS

      The patio stones are slippery under the falling rain.  Byron
      and Kershner struggle for footing as they dodge and parry. 
      Methos watches from the front steps.

      ANGLE ON THE FRENCH DOORS

      where MARY watches secretly.

      BACK TO SCENE

      as Byron presses Kershner to his knees.  He struggles to get
      up, loses his balance...

      BYRON

      knocks KERSHNER S SWORD from his hands and presses the point
      of his sword to Kershner's throat.

      ANGLE ON THE FRENCH DOORS

      Mary GASPS in wide-eyed horror.

      METHOS

      hears her, sees her watching.  He calls to Byron:

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    My Lord!

      Byron looks up, sees Mary, potential witness.

      A BEAT.  Then, through clenched teeth, to Kershner...

                                      BYRON
                    I give you your head.  Leave now,
                    and live.

      Byron relaxes his stance, turns his back on Kershner and
      heads for the patio doors.  But Kershner's no man of honor. 
      He scrambles over to where his SWORD lies...

      Mary watches Byron approach.  Over his shoulder, she sees
      something FLASH in the moonlight.  Steel.  Suddenly, her
      hand flies to her mouth as...

                                      KERSHNER (O.S.)
                      Arggggghhhhhh!

      Byron arches his back as Kershner s SWORD strikes a mortal
      wound.

      Mary makes as though to run forward.  Methos grabs her, holds
      her back.

      Kershner withdraws his sword.  Raises it for the killing
      blow.

      BYRON

      using every last ounce of life left, swivels around, brings
      his sword up with both hands,

      WHOOSH!

      and takes KERSHNER'S HEAD.

      BYRON falls dead.

      ANGLE ON

      a horrified MARY, struggling to pull away from Methos as he
      tries to drag her away

      ZAP!

      A LIGHTNING FLASH freezes her in her tracks.  Another FLASH
      illuminates the carnage before her as the awesome power of
      the QUICKENING twists and contorts Byron's lifeless body
      like a dancing dead thing.

      And then, it's over.  The lightning ends.  The thunder stops. 
      Only the wind and the rain remain.

      Mary stands stunned, having seen it all, Methos still holding
      her.

      Methos kneels by Byron.  Mary s blanched face, stares at

      Byron stirs weakly.  Mary stares at the wound in his chest,
      now healed.

      Methos takes her hand.  She recoils from his touch.

      He nods his acknowledgment.  No lies.

                    I saw him die, and live again.  While

      Methos grabs her hands, speaks earnestly.

                                      METHOS
                    There is no explanation.
                          (the best he can do)
                    He is not governed by the laws of
                    mortal flesh.  His kind is different.

                    How do you know this?  How can you
                    know this?

      He looks in her eyes, cannot deny her the truth.

                                      METHOS
                    Because I am like him.

      Mary looks from the recovering Byron to Methos.  Sees the
      truth in his eyes.  Her anger gives way to tentative wonder.

                    I beseech you, tell no one.  We must

                    Poor, tormented creature.  The sad

                    life and eternal loneliness.

      She reaches out to touch his face, to comfort him.

      Before Methos can speak, Byron coughs back to life,
        interrupting the moment.  He sits up, taking in the scene.

                                      BYRON
                    An interesting bit of entertainment
                    this was, I wager.

      He rises, does his best to brush off his sodden clothes.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

17201720INT.  BYRON'S PENTHOUSE LOFT   THE PRESENT

      Byron stands in front of the giant "Frankenstein" poster. 
      He reads to MacLeod and Methos from a book...

                                      BYRON
                    "Light, feeling, and sense will pass
                    away; and in this condition must I
                    find my happiness."

      He snaps the book shut.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                      "Frankenstein," gentlemen.
                          (beat)
                    Mary Shelley's greatest work.

      MacLeod's getting restless.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Get to the point.

                                      BYRON
                    The point is we're all Frankenstein's
                    monster.  Doomed to walk the frozen
                    tundra for eternity.
                          (gestures to MacLeod
                          and Methos)
                    Or the streets of Paris.  What's the
                      difference?
                          (picks up cocaine)
                    At least this gives us the illusion
                    of life.

      He holds it out to MacLeod.  MacLeod SMACKS it out of his
      hand, scattering white powder everywhere.

                                      MACLEOD
                    If that's your idea of life, you
                    might as well be dead.

                                      BYRON
                    So speaks the hero.

1720CONTINUED:1720

                                      MACLEOD
                    I want you to listen to me.  No
                    poetry... No illusions... no lies. 
                    This is real, and it's a warning.
                          (beat)
                    Leave the kid alone.

      Byron raises his hands in mock surrender.  MacLeod turns on
      his heel, storms out with Methos on his tail.

      Byron stands alone with the giant poster of the monster he
      has come to despise as himself.

17211721EXT.  STREET - DAY

      MacLeod and Methos buy a couple of crepes from a street corner
      vendor, walk and talk.

                                      METHOS
                    Didn't think you two would hit it
                    off.  Matter and anti-matter.  Put
                    'em in the same room... kaboom!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Your friend is a mess.

                                      METHOS
                          (mild)
                    He's a genius.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He's pathetic.

                                      METHOS
                    It would be easy to think so.
                          (beat)
                    Do you remember what it's like to be
                    so hungry it hurts?
                          (off MacLeod's nod)
                    Byron feels like that all the time. 
                    Twenty thousand people screaming his
                    name, and it's not enough to fill
                    that hole inside him.
                          (beat; you'd almost
                            think he'd been there)
                    Always wanting more.  Always needing
                    more.
                          (beat)
                    Try it sometime.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No thanks.

      Methos pauses, searches his memory quickly, recites...

                                      METHOS

                    Of cloudless climes and starry skies."

                                      MACLEOD
                    "And all that's best of dark and
                    bright Meet in her aspect and her
                    eyes."
                          (beat)
                    I know the poem.

                                      METHOS
                    Point is, how can you think like
                    that, write like that... without
                    being larger than life?  Mozart. 
                    Van Gogh.  Charlie Parker.  Messed
                    up guys.

                                      MACLEOD
                    DaVinci.  Bach.  Nice, normal guys.
                    And great artists.

                                      METHOS
                    C'mon... you can't deny the world
                    needs its Jim Morrisons, its Kurt
                      Cobains... and yes, its Lord Byrons.
                          (beat)
                    He's given the world great poetry.
                    And he will again.

                                      MACLEOD
                    At what price?

17221722EXT.  BYRON'S ROOFTOP - DAY

      Pouring RAIN.  Booming THUNDER.  Dazzling FLASHES Of
      lightning.  But the most dramatics element of all is

      LORD BYRON

      naked to the waist, hugging a lightning rod anchored to the
      roof.  Byron tosses his head back, lets out a PRIMAL HOWL
      like a wolf from hell.

                                      BYRON
                      Ahhhhhhhh!  C'mon, old man!  Come
                    get me!  Are you there?!

      Another FLASH of lightning streaks across the sky.  Over the
      noise of the rain and thunder Byron SHRIEKS to the heavens...

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Coward!

      He runs his TONGUE along the wet lightning rod.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                          (to someone O.S.)
                    That's the difference between you
                    and me
                          (hugs the rod)
                    I embrace life.  You run from it.

      He turns his scowling face to

      MIKE

      standing off to one side, drenched and miserable.

                                      BYRON
                    "Daddy" doesn't like you playing in
                    my sandbox.

                                    MIKE
                    I didn't tell them to come.  I swear.

                                      BYRON
                    Details, kid.  I don't need the
                      aggravation, know what I mean?

                                    MIKE
                    But they don't understand.

                                      BYRON
                    Of course they don t.  They never
                    will.  Because they're dead and they
                    don't even know it.
                          (beat)
                    The world is full of small men with
                    small dreams.
                          (pulling him close)
                    What do you want, Mike?
                          (beat)
                    Are you ready to grab onto life with
                    both hands and squeeze it 'til it
                    screams for mercy?

                                    MIKE
                    I'm ready!

      Byron lets go of him, shoves him away.

                                      BYRON
                    I don't think so.  You want to play
                    in the big time, gotta be a big boy.
                          (beat)
                    Go home, kid.

      A brilliant FLASH of lightning directly overhead.  Byron
      SCREAMS to the thunder, to the heavens.

      Mike watches for a moment, then leaves.

17231723EXT.  BLUES CLUB - DAY

      MacLeod and Dawson are approaching the club together.  As
      they reach it, Mike Paladino peels out of the doorway.  He's
      pissed.

                                    MIKE
                    Thanks for nothing, you guys.

      MacLeod knows Dawson doesn't deserve that tone of voice.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You have a problem?

                                    MIKE
                    Did I ask you to mind my business?
                          (beat)
                    Just stay the hell out of my life.
                          (re Dawson)
                    If he wants to spend the rest of his
                    life playing in dives like this,
                    that's fine.  But I don't.

      He turns to storm away.  A HAND reaches out, grabs him roughly
      by the arm, spins him around.  It's MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Who the hell do you think you're
                    talking to?

                                    MIKE
                    Let go.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Call a cop.
                          (stares him down)
                    All we're doing is looking out for
                    you.

                    Right.  He's gonna make me a star.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You think Byron gives a damn about
                    you?  You think he cares whether you
                    live or die?

                    Maybe.

      His face conflicted, Mike doesn't answer.  He turns and walks
      off.  Dawson calls after him.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    Hey.

      Mike looks back.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    You're still opening tonight.

      Mike hesitates, then keeps on walking.

17241724INT.  BYRON'S PENTHOUSE LOFT - DAY

      Byron sits alone in his loft, a half empty bottle of Jack
      Daniels in one hand, "Frankenstein" looming over his shoulder.

                                      BYRON
                          (quoting Byron's
                             Prometheus")
                    "Titan!  to whose immortal eyes The
                      sufferings of mortality; Seen in
                    their sad reality.  Were not as things
                    that gods despise..."

      A KNOCK at the door.  Byron twitches -- the spider sensing
      the fly.  He's his old arrogant, sneering self as he opens
      the door on Mike.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Mommy say you could come out and
                    play?

      Mike struts past him forcefully.

                                    MIKE
                    I don't need anybody's permission to
                    do anything.

                                      BYRON
                    By George, I think he's got it.
                          (clapping his hands)
                    Bravo!  Let's celebrate.

      He moves to a table, opens a drawer, and takes out a silver
      case containing a syringe.

                    What the hell.  Maybe I shoulda

17261726INT.  BYRON'S PENTHOUSE LOFT - NIGHT

      The loft is dark, still, quiet.

      BANG BANG!

      Someone pounds on the door.

      A BEAT.

      THWACK!   The door flies open, SPLINTERS the frame.

      MACLEOD bursts in.  He quickly scans the room... it appears
      to be empty.

      He turns to leave, notices something...

      something white...

      a HAND...

      trailing out from behind the sofa.

      He dashes over looks down.

      MACLEOD S POV

      MIKE lies in a contorted heap, his dead white face staring
      glassy-eyed at the ceiling.

      MACLEOD knows in his heart it's hopeless, but he drops to
      his knees, feels for a pulse.  The kid is cold.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Damn him!

      He grabs the nearest thing that isn't nailed down -- a lamp,
      an empty whiskey tumbler, maybe a chair -- and hurls it across
      the room at the gloomy Frankenstein poster, shattering the
      glass.

      A couple of tall women with long black hair are leaving
      Byron's dressing room.  They pass Methos on his way in.

                                      BYRON
                    Hey, Doc!

      Byron's dressed in his concert costume -- a gothic burlesque
      of studded leather and Renaissance frills.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Gonna be a killer show tonight.

                    I'm not here for the show.

                                      BYRON
                    Well...

      He gestures to a buffet table laden with liquor and food.

                          (with passion)
                    There is no heaven.  It's an illusion
                    for fools and innocents. 
                          (beat)
                    I have no dreams, no hopes, no poetry
                    left.  I feel nothing but this gnawing
                    hunger and hear nothing but my own
                    voice, screaming my failure.

                    You know what I am.

                          (with sympathy)
                    Yes.  I know.

      Byron can't take pity.  He comes up close to Methos, slinks
      an arm around his shoulder.  Covering up his moment of pain
      with a mocking tone:

                                      BYRON
                    But do you know who you are?  You're
                    the guy in the audience, Doc.  And
                    I'm the guy on the flying trapeze.
                          (the old smugness)
                    Who's having more fun?

                                      METHOS
                    But who lives longest?

                                      BYRON
                    Who cares!

                                      METHOS
                    I do.

                                      BYRON
                    Do you want a tombstone that says,
                    "He lived for centuries."  Or one
                    that says, "For centuries, he was
                    ALIVE!"

                                      METHOS
                    You haven't been listening.  I don't
                    want a tombstone.

      Byron cocks an ear.

                    Hear that!?  They're playing my song.

      Byron picks up his guitar and heads for the door.

17291729INT.  STADIUM - TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

      Methos walks down the tunnel that leads from the dressing
      rooms to the stage.

      Byron's band can be heard as MUFFLED ROCK in b.g.

      Methos gets the BUZZ.  He turns.

      MACLEOD

      strides purposefully forward.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Mike Paladino's dead.  O.D.ed.

      Methos puts himself in his path, tries to slow him down.

                                      METHOS
                    I don't suppose a discussion about
                    personal responsibility would interest
                    you right now.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Sure it would.  I hold Byron
                      personally responsible.

                                      METHOS
                    He didn't force Mike to do anything.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's a load of crap and you know
                    it.  Mike is dead because of Byron.

                                      METHOS
                    Mike is dead because of Mike.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That boy idolized him, and Byron put
                    the gun in his hand and dared him to
                    pull the trigger.
                          (with passion)
                    "To live like me you have to be like
                    me."
                          (beat)
                    Except Mike couldn't.  He wasn't
                    Immortal.

                                      METHOS
                    And that's Byron's fault?

      He pushes past.  Methos runs to catch up.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Mac, wait!  Think about the poetry
                    he's written, the music he's made. 
                    The music he has yet to make.  Are
                    you prepared to kill all that?

      MacLeod comes up short, gets in Methos' face.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And what about Mike?  What music
                    could he have made?

      Methos is quiet.  No answer.

      Eyes hard, jaw set, MacLeod moves off down the tunnel, the
      CROWD CHEERING in b.g.  Methos lets him go.

17301730INT.  STADIUM - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

      Byron's band has finished their set.  Manic CHEERS and
      WHISTLES continue b.g. as Byron bounces backstage.

      Drenched in sweat, eyes blazing, panting like he's just run
      the Boston Marathon...

      He gets the BUZZ.  A tall FIGURE storms down the dark tunnel. 
      It passes under an overhead light --

      MACLEOD

      bears down on him like a freight train from hell.

                                      BYRON
                    Lemme guess?  You want an autograph.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No thanks.

      MacLeod pulls his sword.

      Byron flicks his cane and out comes his sword, and then with
      his freehand, pulls a larger blade.

      In the B.G., the crowd is chanting.

                                      BYRON
                    Listen to that!  They love me!

                    You.

      Byron lashes out.  MacLeod meets the challenge.  They duel
      down the corridor and out into --

17311731EXT.  STADIUM - STAGE DOOR - CONTINUOUS

      They circle each other.

                                      BYRON
                    You think all this is about right
                    and wrong.  It's not nearly that
                      significant.
                          (beat)
                    In the end, this --
                          (pointing his sword
                          at MacLeod)
                    Is all that matters.

      Byron lunges, MacLeod deflects the blow, knocks Byron a bit
      off balance.  But years of compensating for his lame right
      foot have made Byron extremely dexterous.  He twists in the
      air, comes back ready to attack.

      MacLeod puts his back into it, goes at him with a series of
      rapid swings.  CLANG!

      Byron's SWORD is knocked out of his hands, goes flying through
      a car window.  Glass SHATTERS.

      MacLeod swings, takes Byron's head.

      The QUICKENING begins.

      LIGHTNING dances overhead.

      FLOODLIGHTS Pop And EXPLODE in the electrical storm.

      B.g., the excited crowd CHEERS at the spectacular LIGHT SHOW
      high in the sky above the stadium.

      Back on the ground,

      MACLEOD convulses in a paroxysm of ecstasy as he receives
      the strange wild sacrament that was Byron's essence.

      FADE IN:

17321732INT.  BLUES CLUB - NIGHT

      Quiet.  After hours.  Empty tables.  The late night crowd is
      gone.

      On the dim stage, Dawson and his guitar play a sad, meandering
      melody.

      Methos sits at a nearby table nursing a beer.

      MacLeod enters.  Methos looks up, their eyes meet.  And hold
      for a BEAT.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Byron's dead.

      Methos goes back to his beer.

      MacLeod glances toward Dawson.  No reaction.  Did he hear
      him?  He takes a step toward the stage.

                                      DAWSON
                    I heard you.

      He looks at MacLeod with empty eyes.  He shakes his head,
      goes back to his guitar.

      MacLeod moves over to Methos' table.  An awkward BEAT --
      MacLeod has nothing to apologize for, but after all... Byron
      was his friend.

      Methos speaks to the table.

                                      METHOS
                    I told you this was inevitable.

      Close enough for MacLeod.  He takes a seat.  Methos looks
      up, shrugs.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Matter and anti-matter.  I think
                    Byron knew it, too.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It didn t have to be that way.  He
