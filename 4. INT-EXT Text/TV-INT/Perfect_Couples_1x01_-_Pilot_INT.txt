ISABELLA
Julia?

JULIA
(so half-hearted)
Is Vance here?  We dared him to 
come hit on you.  We forced him.  
Because we re jerks.

Vance enters and heads for the door.  He turns to ISABELLA.

VANCE
Try not to hold this against them.


Dave is UNDER THE SHEETS, expectant.  Julia walks in.

DAVE
Where did you go?

Vance enters.  Dave reacts, surprised.

VANCE
 What, are you naked?  You re
insatiable.  Are you, like, gay, so 
you feel the need to prove 
something?  You can tell me.29


DAVE
You went to get him?  But tonight 
 want the was about us.  We didn t

VANCE
(put off)
Drama?

AMY STORMS IN, with her ARMS FULL, surprising everyone.

AMY
You monster!

 etc.Amy THROWS her things at Vance: CLOTHES, CD S,

VANCE
My pants?  You brought throwing 
stuff from home?

AMY
To get back at me you drag sweet, 
young Isabella into our mess?

VANCE
How do you know about Isabella?
(realizing)
No.  Is this because I called --

REX and LEIGH ENTER.

REX
Hey, guys.

VANCE
Vultures!  You told her?!

AMY
(shakes her head)
I was there when you called.  After 
your drunken visit, I needed the 
help of a true relationship genius.

Leigh BEAMS as Amy PUTS HER ARM AROUND HER.

REX
Leigh had it handled, so I went to 
the garage for my carpentry.

LEIGH
(to Dave and Julia)
We asked Amy not to come, but now 
s fix this. here, let that we re

LEIGH (CONT'D)
You two love each other.  Stop 
playing your games and start being 
honest about what you need.

REX
t you want a  Vance.  Don C mon,
partner who really gets what you re 
all about?

POP TO:


Rex stands and sways with Korean congregants who sing a 
joyous song in their native tongue.  He mumbles gibberish.


As they were.

DAVE
Okay.  Everybody out!

VANCE
No, Dave.  You need to moderate 
this.  You have unique insights 
into my psyche and Amy s.
(beat, to Amy)
Because he slept with you.
(to room)

DAVE
(to Julia, pissed)
You had no right going to get him.

JULIA
 mad at Wait -- you reme?

DAVE
Yes.  I finally step up and do the 
 let me right thing and you don t
have it.  Why?

JULIA
I was trying to be nice.

DAVE
re not  nice, but you Nah, you re
that nice.  You begged me to get 
rid of him.  What possible reason 
could you have to pick him up?31


LEIGH
What an interesting relationship 
challenge.
(to Rex)
I think we need Dr. Dahlquist.

REX
I agree.  This is a situation where 
she d want us to ignore her request 
to stop calling her at home.

JULIA
Nope.  Not interested in this.  
Happy Anniversary, everybody!

She STOMPS out.  Dave follows.


Dave follows Julia.  She keeps walking, trying to lose him.

DAVE
We were having a good time.  Why 
did you choose to ruin it?

JULIA
It was already ruined once Vance 
called!  You were either gonna go, 
or stay and worry about him.

She enters a room.  He follows.


A small guest room, full of clothes and knick-knacks left 
 mom.  Dave shuts the door.over from Julia s

DAVE
(putting it together)
 I think I get it.  The night s
ruined, so you might as well get 
something out of it.  You pick up 
Vance, you pick up a chit.

She scoffs.

DAVE (CONT D)
It keeps happening.  I goof up -- 
with Game Night, with Vance -- you 
say it s okay, but really, you hold 
on.  You earn a chit, squirrel it 
 a little game you play.away.  It s

From the other side of the door WE HEAR:32

JULIA

 chits ?

Home office.

Julia takes this in.

DAVE (CONT D)
Two years, your mother was around.  
And she was not a kind woman.  But 
 say anything.  Because I couldn t
of your chits, you kinda own me.  

JULIA

DAVE
(sits with her)
No no, don t do that.  It s my 
fault too.  I know when I m getting 
away with something I shouldn t.

JULIA
Leigh was right.  These games.  
They mess with you.

They sit there a little lost.  A beat.

LEIGH (O.S.)
Now make her feel safe so she knows 
she can be honest about her needs!

DAVE/JULIA
Go away! / Enough!

DAVE
(beat, re: Leigh)
I do give you what you need, right? 

JULIA
You usually do.33


Not the answer he was hoping for.

JULIA (CONT D)
I mean tonight, you could have 
asked Vance to leave without me 
forcing you.

DAVE
Yeah.  I should have.

JULIA
I sometimes wish you d do the right 
thing without me asking.  To know 
 what I want before I say it.  It s
an awful lot to ask, but you do it 
for Vance.  I wish sometimes you 
could do it for me.

DAVE
Of course I can.  I want to give 
you that.
(beat, re: clock)
 forty minutes So tonight.  There s
left.  No more games.
(musing)

asking for?

JULIA

It started so great and we just 
 blew it.  I want it to end.  I m
