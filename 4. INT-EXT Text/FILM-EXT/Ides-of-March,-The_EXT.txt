ROB BRAUN, a local Cincinnati anchor, talks to camera as we
see STEPHEN and BEN exit the building. Under this we hear
Rachel Maddow reporting.
RACHEL MADDOW (O.C.)
Well it all comes down to this...We
are one week away from the Ohio
primary...
Camera now moves past ROB to another news truck where an
MSNBC REPORTER stands in front of a camera waiting to go
live. There is a monitor in front of him.
The camera keeps moving into the monitor where RACHEL MADDOW
does the lead in.
As RACHEL's audio continues we see the following images.
CUT TO:
We cruise along a snow-covered rural landscape - flat, gray,
desolate. In the distance we see a barn with huge red-white-
and-blue letters painted on the side. They read "OHIO FOR
MORRIS".
RACHEL MADDOW (O.S.)
Two democrats are left standing.
Senator Pullman of Arkansas who is
trailing Governor Morris from
Pennsylvania.
Moments later we roll past another farm with a large
billboard staked into the ground beside the road: "PULLMAN -
AMERICA'S FUTURE BEGINS ON MARCH 15th".
We cut to canvassers - bundled to the hilt against the cold -
knocking on doors in a suburban neighborhood. Yard signs for
both candidates line the street.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
RACHEL MADDOW (O.S.)
Governor Morris has mounted a
sizable lead with 2047 delegates,
winning New Hampshire, California,
New York and Michigan...But Senator
Pullman with 1302 delegates is
still in the hunt having won
Florida, Tennessee, Virginia and
Missouri...
Supporters at an intersection waving hand-made signs to cars:
"HONK FOR MORRIS". A passing car lays on the horn and the
supporters cheer.
RACHEL MADDOW (O.S.)
A win in Ohio could turn it all
around for the Arkansas Senator...
CLOSE UP of a Pullman bumper sticker on an SUV at a
stoplight, right next to a "My Child is an Honor Student"
decal.
RACHEL MADDOW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
So one week from Tuesday the all
important hundred and eighty one
Ohio delegates could be the
deciding factor..
A clerk placing a Morris sign in the store window. In the
shop next door various TV's are in a window display. We see
RACHEL MADDOW'S report on them.
RACHEL MADDOW (O.S.)
And once again the old adage is
true..."As goes Ohio, so goes the
Nation."
CUT TO:
We see Satellite trucks, press vehicles, police cars, etc.
At a catering truck, MOLLY STEARNS, a 19 year old intern
grabs a tray of coffees and a box of doughnuts.

We stay on her as she runs across the street and through a
door...
CUT TO:
IDA and PAUL walk to Ida's car.
PAUL
This is off off off the record.
IDA
What?
PAUL
Franklin Thompson.
IDA
Seriously?
PAUL
Off the record. The only people who
know are the Governor, Stephen and
me.
IDA
My lips are sealed.
PAUL
I have a meeting tomorrow at
Thompson's house.
IDA
He's gonna endorse?
PAUL
After I'm done talking with him,
what do you think?
IDA
That's huge.
PAUL
It's more than huge. He has 356
pledged delegates...they all travel
with him. That puts us over the
top.
IDA
He's said publicly he's not gonna
endorse anyone.
(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED:
PAUL
That's what they all say until we
get them alone in a room.
IDA
So this is for real?
PAUL
Yup. It's just about in the bag.
IDA
When are you gonna announce?
PAUL
Nope. That's all you get for now.
CUT TO:
Establishing shot.
Ben walks around to all the staffers, he hands out new cell
phones.
BEN
Okay so listen up...these are your
new cell phones...Shelly has pre-
programmed everyone's numbers
in...thank you Shelly...no personal
calls...if you lose them, Paul has
authorized me to kill you.
Ben walks into Stephen's office and hands him his new phone.
BEN (CONT'D)
New phones...
STEPHEN
I'll get it in a bit...
As Ben leaves, we see that Stephen is looking at early
footage of Governor Morris. Another staffer and an editor
are watching it with him. Outside the office we can see
other staffers, through the glass partitions, running around
in campaign mode.
We see some of the footage.
(CONTINUED)
15.
CONTINUED:
GOV MORRIS (ON MONITOR)
The economy...health care...I've
got to believe we can do it. We
have enemies...we have to
understand why our enemies are our
enemies, and see if there is
something we can do about that
besides using force. What we know
from history is the answer to
extremism is not extremism.
Whoever is the next president,
whoever steps up, has got a lot of
work to do, but you have a little
work to do yourself.
Stephen hits pause.
STEPHEN
Fucking kill me...where did we get
this?
EDITOR
Before he announced at a town hall
meeting in Pennsylvania...
STEPHEN
Thank God it wasn't overseas. Just
get rid of it -
EDITOR
It plays to his base, if-
STEPHEN
Are you fucking stoned...this is
the same...the exact same piece the
Republicans are gonna run against
him in the general...we don't need
to brag about it...Hi I'm Neville
Chamberlain and I want to be your
commander in chief.
EDITOR
If it's gonna come out-
STEPHEN
It's gonna come out but not paid
for by us pal. (To Staffer) Any
truth on whether Pullman had
investments in those diamond mines
in Liberia?
(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED: (2)
STAFFER 1
We're still checking...it was a
blog so who the fuck knows...
STEPHEN
Doesn't matter I want to hear him
denying it. If it's true, find
out, if it's not, let them spend
the next day telling the post that
he doesn't own a diamond mine in
Liberia...win win.
STAFFER 1
Okay.
STEPHEN
We need to counter this Christian
shit we're taking from last
night...so get going...Where's our
cut on the new thirty and a sixty
second spots? We'll show it to him
this afternoon in the staff
meeting.
EDITOR
Got it.
The Editor and staffer exit.
Stephen turns to his computer and types as Molly walks in and
hands him some papers.
MOLLY
Ben wanted me to get you to sign
off on this before the staff
meeting.
STEPHEN
Oh, right. Thanks. I've been
waiting for this.
MOLLY
Anything interesting?
STEPHEN
Just some white paper I gotta pass
out tonight.
MOLLY
White paper?
(CONTINUED)

STEPHEN
Negative shit. Our oppo guys do
research - we feed it to the press,
hope they bite.
MOLLY
So like what sort of negative
stuff?
STEPHEN
Read tomorrow's paper and you'll
see.
MOLLY
Which paper?
STEPHEN
All of them.
MOLLY
So it's something big?
STEPHEN
I wish it were something bigger
actually. Just some transportation
numbers. I'll have to spin this
shit pretty heavy if we want it to
stick.
MOLLY
Well that's what you're good at,
right?
STEPHEN
I guess.
MOLLY
(Holding up her phone)
Did you get your phone?
STEPHEN
(Holds his up)
Just now.
MOLLY

It's exciting isn't it?
He looks at her.

STEPHEN
A Cincinnati Bearcat?
MOLLY
Oh no...I'm not from here...I

STEPHEN
Oh that's right...but you changed
something. (Searching for a way
out.)
MOLLY
My hair?
STEPHEN
You changed your hair.
MOLLY
(ENJOYING THIS)
No..
STEPHEN
I must look like a total dumb ass
right now.
MOLLY
Not at all...you're the big man on
campus...I'm just a lowly intern.
STEPHEN
Come on it's not like that.
MOLLY
Sure it is...you get to stay at the
Millennium, they put us into a
motel on the other side of the
river.
STEPHEN
You're right, I am big man on
campus.
MOLLY
Now you're starting to see.
She starts to leave.
MOLLY (CONT'D)
We do have the better bar though.

have a drink with the worker bees.
STEPHEN
Maybe I will...when's a good night?
MOLLY
Tonight's good...
STEPHEN
Really? Tuesday?
MOLLY
Yeah it's quiet.
STEPHEN
Quiet's good.
MOLLY

STEPHEN

MOLLY
Programmed right there in your
phone.
STEPHEN
Oh...right...(He opens the phone)

Stephen smiles to himself.

DUFFY
You're gonna look like fools

Stephen comes running out the door. An ambulance has pulled
up and EMT's are on their way in. Police are also pulling
up. Stephen keeps walking - he gets in his car and sits

Nothing. No emotion.
Stephen pulls out his phone and listens to his messages.

JOHN KING (V.O.)
The coroner has stated, that based
on the evidence found by the police
in the hotel room, that this was an
accidental overdose, a lethal
cocktail of alcohol and
prescription drugs. The Cincinnati
police chief, Darryl Mathews, has
called for a full investigation
pending a toxicology report which
could take up to two weeks. Just a
terrible terrible situation for the
former Senator, now DNC Chairman,
Jack Stearns and his family.
Off the Governor's face we:
CUT TO:
STEPHEN and SENATOR THOMPSON are seated on a bench.
SENATOR THOMPSON
I want on the ticket...you need me
on the ticket...and you need my
delegates...you could use em before
Tuesday. Make a fine story on the
Sunday morning news cycle...so I
expect to hear from you by noon
tomorrow...or I endorse Pullman and
take my cabinet seat.
They look at each other.
SENATOR THOMPSON (CONT'D)
Anything else you want to talk
about?
CUT TO:
We're at a press conference - The GOVERNOR, PAUL, BEN, and
the rest of the staff, are standing behind the microphone.
The Governor is making a statement
GOV. MORRIS
The entire staff is in a state of
shock. We have sent our
condolences to Jack and JoAnna
Stearns and their whole family...

GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D)
and of course our hearts go out to
them... it's hard to imagine what
they're going through...
All we know at this point is it
appears to be a drug...an
accidental prescription overdose.
Ida?
IDA
Is suicide ruled out?
GOV. MORRIS
We have no reason to believe...
He looks to Paul.
GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D)
I don't think we have any of that
information yet. Obviously there
will be a full investigation. Just
wanted to say that our hearts go
out...our prayers go out to the
entire family...and she was part of
our family.
REPORTER 5
Did you know her well Governor?
GOV. MORRIS
Not well. But I did know her, and
what I saw was a hard working,
young woman, with a great and
positive spirit. It's a very sad
day in our campaign and a very sad
day for the people close to Jack.
REPORTER 6
How long has she interned with you
Governor?
The Governor looks back at Paul. Paul steps up to the mic.
PAUL
She'd only been on the road with us
for a few weeks...maybe four I
think, I can check.
IDA
Will you continue with your
schedule today? You're set to tour
Proctor & Gamble this afternoon.
(CONTINUED)
86.
CONTINUED: (2)
PAUL
We will most certainly stay on
schedule. This accident, and we
have to assume for now it's an
accident, is just simply a tragedy.
The work, the schedule won't be
altered. It just means that those
of us that knew Molly will go about
our jobs with a heavy heart.
As these questions continue, the Governor's cell phone
vibrates. He pulls it from his pocket and reads the name of
the caller. It reads "Molly." He looks up. Panic starts to
set in - the only sounds we hear are his heart beating and
the phone vibrating.
The Governor looks at each of his staff members. Then he
scans around the room looking through the press corps up to
the back doorway where he locks eyes with Stephen.
STEPHEN holds a cell phone to his ear. They stare at each
other. Then Stephen hangs up, and the Governor's phone stops
vibrating.
Stephen turns and leaves.
CUT TO:
STEPHEN approaches the restaurant - the lights are off. He
peers through a window - we hear the door unlock. One of the
Governor's SECRET SERVICE MEN opens the door. He motions
Stephen in.
PAUL walks out, starts down the street. As he passes the
first corner, he sees the Governor's SUV and the Secret
Service SUV both parked on the side of the road. Paul looks
at the SUV... then walks up to the window. The window rolls
down and the GOVERNOR leans his head out.
GOV. MORRIS
Paul you got a minute?
We stay outside the car for along time. We hear CHRIS
MATHEWS under this shot. We see Paul get out of the SUV and
the two SUVs drive off, leaving him standing there.
STEPHEN'S in a different hotel now.
The TV is on.
CHRIS MATHEWS
How much could a big shake up days
before the Ohio primary hurt a
campaign. I asked Paul Zara how
his firing could actually help the
candidate.
We See STEPHEN, shaving in the bathroom mirror, as he listens
to the TV.
PAUL
The Governor and I both felt, that
in light of some of these changing
numbers, it was best to put a new
face on the campaign...Stephen is
very talented...very smart...
CUT TO:
92.
We see a shot of an old church. People are walking up the
steps and through the big open doors.
We're on the street in front of the church. People are
filing out. PAUL is waiting next to STEPHEN'S car as Steven
walks up.
PAUL
You should hire Jack for a speech
writer.
STEPHEN
I'll keep that in mind. Are you
here to talk to me?

PAUL
Look at you, all grown up with tits

STEPHEN
I learned from the best.
PAUL
One day we'll grab a beer and
you'll tell me what you had on the
Governor that put me out.
STEPHEN
How do you know I didn't have
something on you?
They both smile.
PAUL
You better get going, you've got a

offices to go look at.
