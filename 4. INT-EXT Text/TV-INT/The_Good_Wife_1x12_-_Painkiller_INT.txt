                    Is that a stuffed elephant behind 
                    you there, Zachary?  

      Zach turns.  Yes it is.  He knocks it to the floor.

                    That s adorable.  I had no idea you 
                    collected stuffed animals.

                    Mom s out there.  


    Mom is indeed out there, interviewing MOLLY CARLING, 24, nerdy-*
      intellectual, focused.  A single mom s dream of a nanny.  

                                  MOLLY
                    I ve spent the last year nannying 
                    full-time, but with grad school, I 
                    can really only do part-time--

                                  ALICIA
                    You re at Northwestern?

                                  MOLLY
                    Yes.  A dual Masters in Business and 
                      Educational Psychology.  I m very 
                    interested in child development.  
                    Have you heard of the EMT?
                          (Alicia shakes her head)
                    The Educational Measurement Test.  
                    My father created it.  

    Oh.  Alicia smiles at Molly s pride in this.  As-- both pause, 
      hearing the argument growing in Grace s room:  No, I didn t--  
       You did!    Stop making things up! Alicia smiles: sorry.  

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                          (getting it)
                    I m from a big family.  Six 
                    brothers and sisters.

    Ah, Alicia nods, liking her, shoots a look to Jackie coming 
    out of the kitchen: could you take care of that?  Jackie 
      nods, heads toward the bedroom, as... 

                                  ALICIA
                    Anyway, part-time is perfect for us-- 
                    I m just looking for someone to 
                    supplement the hours my mother-in-
                    law s here. 

                                  MOLLY
                    This would be afternoons, evenings?

      Alicia pauses: the argument getting louder-- with Jackie now 
      joining in:   





                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #111   "Painkiller"   YELLOW REVISIONS   11/30/09     3.

                    Grace, I just cleaned this.  What s 
                    it doing on the floor--

                                  GRACE (O.S.)
                    Would everybody just get out?

                                  ALICIA
                          (finally answering Molly)
                    Yes.  I m hoping to have someone 
                    start next week, so I ll call your 
                    references and be in touch.

      They both stand, interview over, Alicia escorting Molly out. 

                                  MOLLY
                    Good, thank you, Mrs. Florrick.  I 
                    love your apartment.

                                  ALICIA
                    Thank you.

      Alicia closes the front door, starts back toward the 
      argument.  The phone rings; she picks it up on the way:

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Hello.

                                  WILL (O.S.)
                    Oh, Alicia, hi.  Sorry, it s Will, 
                    I know you just got home--

      INTERCUT with...


      ...Will, leaving work, on his cell, dressed in a tux. 

                                  WILL
                    --but I just got a call from

                                  ALICIA
                    The hospital?

                                  WILL
                    Yeah, we signed them a month ago.   

      Alicia covers the receiver as she ventures into...THE GOOD WIFE #111   "Painkiller"   YELLOW REVISIONS   11/30/09     4.




      ...the argument between Jackie, Zach, and Grace, quickly and 
      silently stopping it by raising her hand.  Quiet.  

                                  WILL
                    The administrator called.  It seems 
                    like there s a bit of a fluid 
                    situation over there involving a 
                    possible malpractice suit.

                                  ALICIA
                      A possibleone?

                                  WILL
                    Yes.

      Alicia gestures to Zach.  Stand.  He does mopily.  She 
      points: out of the room.  He shuffles out.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    I think they re being over-cautious, 
                    but they re a new client with deep 
                    pockets, and they just came off a 
                    million dollar malpractice pay-out, 
                    so we jump through hoops.  They got 
                    a call ten minutes ago from a 
                    paramedic coming in with a heater. 

      Alicia picks up Grace s Algebra textbook, opens it for her.  
      Points.  Read.  Grace shrugs, sits down, reads...

                                  ALICIA
                    A heater?

                                  WILL
                    Yes, a high-profile patient. 


      Alicia heads back into the living room--

                                  WILL
                    I don t have all the details, but 
                    it looks like an OD.  I need 
                    someone to get over there, and make 
                    sure if this does turn into a 
                      malpractice suit, we have our ducks 
                    in a row.

      Alicia pulls out the chair at Zach s computer.  Zach frowns, 
      sits, and Alicia shoves a Social Studies book into his hands.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #111   "Painkiller"   YELLOW REVISIONS   11/30/09     5.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Look, I know we ve been asking a 
                    lot of you lately, so if you want 
                    me to put this on Cary, I can.

      Alicia frowns at that, finished with her silent little 
      parenting dance... 

                                  ALICIA
                    No, I ve got it.

      And--


      --sudden chaos.  In ER.  A mix of doctors, patients and-- 
      high school cheerleaders.  Huh?  Grief-stricken.  Tear-
      stained.  Alicia looks oddly at them as she passes, seeing...

      ...a half-dozen high school football players ahead, seated on 
      benches.  Heads in hands.  Others pacing.  Alicia, trying to 
      figure out what s happening, moves toward a reception desk 
      when she notices...

      ...a woman at the center of this high school grief.  A mom.  
      TINABOWERS, 30s, white.  On a good day, she s a *
      professional, strong woman who rules a department; on a bad 
      day: distraught, lost.  Alicia recognizes that look.  As...

                                  KALINDA
                    Thank god.

      Alicia turns, sees Kalinda behind her...

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    I thought he was sending out Cary.

                                  ALICIA
                    What s going on?

                    Ben Bowers.  Woodland Park High 
                    star quarterback, USC recruit.  He 
                    collapsed on the field.  

                                  ALICIA
                    How is he?

                                  KALINDA
                    I think we re going to find out 
                    now.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #111   "Painkiller"   YELLOW REVISIONS   11/30/09     6.

      CONTINUED:66


      Kalinda nods toward an ER DOCTOR exiting the ICU, grave look 
    on his face.  He approaches TinaBowers.  It only takes three *
      unheard sentences and...

      ...Tinacries out-- not over-loud, but heart-wrenching.  Her *
      knees buckle under her and people reach out to keep her from 
      falling to the floor.  Alicia finds herself moved by the 
      scene: the cries of a mom.  

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    Okay, time to work.

      Alicia turns to Kalinda, surprised by her... indifference?  
    Or is it just professional calm?


      Bang-- Alicia and Kalinda bang through doors following DILLON 
      LOOMIS, uber-efficient hospital bureaucrat, but not 
      heartless, down an ER hall.  On his cell, rushing...

                                  LOOMIS
                    Get Corporate Compliance, HR, PR-- 
                    no, I have outside counsel.  Code 
                    was called at 8:35.  In-house 
                    called police at 8:45.  They re on 
                    their way.

      Loomis nods them toward an emergency room bay, and--

      ---WHOOSH - Kalinda yanks a curtain aside, finding the body 
    of BEN BOWERS, 17, football uniform from the waist down.  
      Sensors on his bare chest.  The room strangely quiet after 
    the ER, only Loomis whispering on his cellphone in the 
      background, a nurse moving a heart monitor out the door.   

      Loomis looks up to Kalinda, Alicia, reporting:

                                  LOOMIS (CONT D)
                    Police are five minutes away.

      Kalinda nods, immediately starts to take pictures, careful 
    not to touch anything, as...

      ...Alicia pauses, startled by the grim, naked sight.  A dead 
      body.  A dead 17-year-old.  She moves around it, taking it 
    all in.  Just the quiet click-click-click of Kalinda s 
      camera.

      Alicia studies his face, his eyes wide open, his ripped 
      jersey, his helmet on the floor-- the whole thing difficult, 
      awful really, even ghoulish.  Hushed:


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #111   "Painkiller"   YELLOW REVISIONS   11/30/09     7.

                    One shoe.

      What?  Kalinda looks up.  Alicia nods toward his feet.  Only 
    one cleat on.  The other foot just a sock.  Kalinda shrugs-- 
    so what?-- continues to photograph.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Where s the other one?

      Alicia looks around.   Nothing on the floor.  In the corners. 
    But Kalinda is busy kneeling over a half-moon gym bag...

                                  KALINDA
                    Is this his bag?

                    Paramedics brought it in.

      Kalinda kneels, gets photos of the open bag.  She takes out a 
    pen to open the bag s mouth further:

                    Alicia.

    Oh, Alicia kneels, helps her, holding the pen to keep the bag 
      open as Kalinda zooms in on a prescription bottle.  Printed 
    on it  Dr. Wesley.   

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    That s the attending physician?

                          (reluctantly)
                    Yes.

      Kalinda takes a picture.  Sees next to it, inside the bag, 
      white dots.  Oblong.  Oh, free-floating pills at the bottom 
    of the bag. 

                                  KALINDA

      Loomis frowns, damn, speed dials his cellphone as Kalinda 
      starts to estimate while still taking pictures:

                    Cops are two minutes behind us.  
                    They take a half hour to call in 
                      detectives.  Another half hour to 
                    find these pills.  
                          (calls out to Loomis)
                    Your doctor has about ninety 
                    minutes before he s arrested.

                                  LOOMIS
                    I have to get the board together.  
                    We could be liable.  

                                  KALINDA
                    First, get to your doctor, make 
                    sure he exercises his Miranda.  

                                  ALICIA
                          (to Loomis)
                    I ll go with you.

      But-- bang-- the ICU doors open.  Two cops and a suited 
      detective, RYAN MURPHY, cool, laid-back, Mr. March in the *
      cops  charity calendar.  Kalinda quickly steps away from the 
    gym bag.

                                  MURPHY
                    Ah, Kalinda.  Somehow I should ve 
                    expected it.

                                  KALINDA
                    Hey, Murphy.  You got here fast.

                                  MURPHY
                    It s a heater.  On a Friday night.  
                    What do you expect? 

      Kalinda shoots a look toward Alicia who nods, nonchalantly 
      steps away from the sport bag too.

                                  MURPHY (CONT D)
                    So you been documenting the scene?

                                  KALINDA
                    Yep.

                                  MURPHY
                    Don t supposed you d want to focus 
                    my eyes on the salient details?

                                  KALINDA
                    Where s the fun in that?

      Murphy smiles, approaches the body with the two cops as 
      Kalinda nods to Alicia who starts with Loomis out the door.


    The ER.  Still noisy.  Alicia stops with Loomis, seeing... 
    the mom, TinaBowers, seated, being talked to by an African-*
      American doctor.

                                  LOOMIS
                    Damn.

                                  ALICIA
                    That s Dr. Wesley?

      Loomis nods.  Alicia exhales deeply, hates that she has to do 
      this, ventures into the circle of comforters, hears the 
      whispered, tearful words of DR. SHAWNWESLEY, youthful, *
      poised, a black McDreamy.  

                                  DR. WESLEY
                    I m so sorry, Mrs. Bowers.  I m 
                    just so sorry...

                    He was 17.  How...?

                    I don t know...

                    I want to see him.

                                  DR. WESLEY
                      I understand--

                                  ALICIA
                    Dr. Wesley, can I talk to you a 
                    second?

      Alicia s words are quiet, sympathetic, but interruptive.  
      Both Tinaand Wesley look up. *

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Please.  

      Wesley studies her, confused.  Then looks to Tina, but she s *
      already being comforted by another parent.  Wesley nods, 
      crosses to Alicia:

                                  DR. WESLEY
                    Do I know you?

    But Alicia walks Wesley even further away.  Sees the tears in 
    his eyes.  His devastation.

                                  ALICIA
                    I m a lawyer from Stern, Lockhart & 
                    Gardner, doctor.  You can t be 
                    talking with the mother right now.

                                  DR. WESLEY
                    I-- Why not?

      Alicia hates herself for being this person.  But it s her job.

                                  ALICIA
                    Your patient overdosed on pills you 
                      prescribed.  And there is some 
                    question about the dosage.  Even a 
                    simple expression of sympathy could 
                    be construed as an admission of 
                    guilt.

    Dr. Wesley stares at her.  Startled. 

                                  DR. WESLEY
                    Then it s an admission.  That s my 
                    patient.  I m their family doctor.

                                  ALICIA
                    And I m your lawyer.  If I were 
                    sick right now, I d do exactly what 
                    you told me.  But you re in 
                    trouble, so you need to do exactly 
                    what I tell you.

      Wesley pauses, looks at her differently.  There s an honesty 
    to that.  Alicia adds for good measure:

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Please.

      Wesley takes a second, nods-- okay-- follows her.  As...

                                  DR. WESLEY
                    I m in trouble?  The police think--?

                                  ALICIA

                                  DR. WESLEY
                    The south tower.  

    He points down a hallway toward an elevator.

                                  ALICIA
                    I want you to go there.  And don t 
                    talk to anybody.  I know this will 
                    be difficult, but promise me, 
                    please.

                                  DR. WESLEY
                    I d never put Ben in harm s way.  
                    If you re my attorney, I want you 
                    to know that.

      Alicia studies him, nods.  He reads her face, sensing the 
      sincerity.  Appreciating it.  

                                  DR. WESLEY (CONT D)

                    Just block it out.

    He nods.  Some amount of awareness of her history.  Wesley 
      gets on an elevator.

                    I ll speak to you soon.

    And the doors close.  Alicia exhales.  Hopes she handled that 
      well.  No time to pause, she winds back toward the main ER, 
      sees a phalanx of grieving football players/cheerleaders 
      ahead, takes a detour into a little alcove-- way off the 
      normal path-- when she...

      ...pauses, sees something there.  Sticking out from under a 
      curtain.  THE OTHER CLEAT.  Size 13, still muddy.  

    How the hell did it get all the way over here?  Meanwhile...


      ...back at home, Zach stands in front of a mirror.  Trying to 
      look good.  Combing his hair over one eye.  Yuck.  He shakes 
    the whole mane for a natural look.  Doesn t like it.  

      A hum comes from his bureau.  His cellphone.  Picks it up.  
      Reads a text.  Excited, he grabs his coat.  Quietly, 
      secretly, opens his door.  As...


      ...Becca, still looking good girl sexy, leans outside the 
      Florrick apartment door, texting.  Turns to another teenaged 
      girl, waiting at the elevator door holding it open. 

                                  BECCA
                    He s a Florrick kid.  Give him a 
                    minute.

    The other girl sighs, wants to get going.  

    The Florrick front door quietly unlocks, opens.  Yep: Zach, 
      holding a finger to his lips.  Becca smiles.  Loves Zach s 
      little boy innocence.  Sees his coat.  

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    Are you sure you re warm enough 
                    there, Zachary?

      Zach grins-- doesn t mind being teased.  Whispering:



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #111   "Painkiller"   YELLOW REVISIONS   11/30/09     13.

      They start toward the elevator when-- SCREAMMM!  They spin 
      back toward the apartment door.  It s coming from...


      ...Grace in the kitchen, horrified, staring down at...

      ...Jackie s body on the kitchen floor.

      Peter.  A mask of worry.  Intensity.  Alicia sits across from 
    him in the visiting room.  No glass between them.

                                  ALICIA
                    It was a stroke.  She s still 
                    unconscious.  But stable.

                    Which hospital?

                    The kids couldn t get through to

                          (nods: that s right)
                    She s sixteen.  Zach was sneaking 
                    out to go to a concert.  We already 
                    talked.  

                                  PETER
                    I need to get out of here.

      Alicia eyes her husband-- a moment of compassion.  He s 
      trapped, a lion in a cage.  In control now:

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    There s an excellent neurologist,

                    physician.  And unfortunately, we
                    bare the cost of a supervised visit.  
                    It could be several thousand.

                    Thank you.

      Alicia looks toward the guards nearby at the end of the row.  
    And up toward a blinking red light on a video camera.  Peter 
      notices Alicia s covert looks: what s going on?

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    How are you?

      Just Alicia s writing there...

      Peter pauses over it.  Takes a second, looks up at Alicia.  A 
      bombshell.  Their eyes meet.  For public consumption:

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    You can just initial there.  And 
                    talk to Golden about it later.

      Peter stares at his wife.  Admiration growing.  He initials.

                                  PETER
                    Thank you.  

                                  ALICIA
                    You re welcome.

                    It s just odd.  I started the day 
                    with one lawyer, now I have... ten.

      Chuckles from the table.  Will, Diane, Cary, other lawyers.  
      Loomis at the end.

                                  LOOMIS
                    Your issues are our issues, Shawn.*

                                  DR. WESLEY
                    Thank you for posting my bail, 
                    standing by me.

                                  LOOMIS
                    Of course.  We want to see you 
                    cleared, Shawn.*

                    Now due to the popularity of the

                                  WILL
                    Yes, Ben.  We believe the State s 
                    Attorney s office is guilty of 
                    legal overreach.

                    They have charged you with murder-- 
                    which is a sign of their 
                    desperation.  It s a charge aimed at 
                    headlines.

                                  DR. WESLEY
                    Isn t that bad?  Hi.

      This last he directs to a late Alicia, entering.  A familiar 
      face.  She nods back as Diane and Will register this... 

                                  WILL
                    No.  It means they probably don t 
                    intend to bring it to trial.  They 
                    just want to get a plea bargain 
                    with some jail time, any jail time--

                                  DIANE
                    Which we won t accept.

                                  WILL
                    Right.  We just need to make them 
                    aware of the facts.

                                  DIANE
                    Which are-- you prescribed the ten 
                    milligram pain killers, but not the 
                    eighty milligram?

                                  DR. WESLEY
                    That s right.

                                  WILL
                    Good.  So we need to find out where 
                    these other drugs came from.  Our 
                    team will do some digging, cut this 
                    off before it goes to trial.

                    Hey, Li.

    Li looks up from the body, cheerfully:

                    Kalinda.  We miss you.

                          (looking toward the body)
                    What s that?  Stomach contents? 

                                  MURPHY
                    Don t answer her.  I think you ran 
                    into the only cop who can resist 
                    your charms, Kalinda.

    Li shrugs: can t help himself.

                                  KALINDA
                    So what s your take on the Florrick

                    See how easy that was?  Take care. 

    And Kalinda starts out.


      Alicia stands in the entryway with Tina.  Delivery food *
      trays, flower arrangements everywhere.  

                                    TINABOWERS*
                    That s the one I hate.

      A flower arrangement shaped like a football.  Alicia nods.

                    I m not sure what you want to hear-- 
                    my son didn t run around with drug 
                    dealers.

                                  ALICIA
                    I know, but is it possible a friend, 
                    or the football coach--

                                    TINABOWERS*
                    I knew the people in his life.

                    But kids aren t always... forthcoming.

      Tinastares at Alicia.  It could be rude, but somehow it s *
    not from someone else dealing with it.  

                                    TINABOWERS*
                    Ben didn t have time.  He was 
                    either at school, at practice, or 
                    at the gym-- that was his life--

      Alicia nods.  Sees nearby, a sweatshirt with a logo: Iron Muscle 
      Gym.

                                  TINABOWERS (CONT D)*
                    Maybe it was too much-- I don t 
                    know.  I m a single mom.  You can t 
                    see everything, you can t be there 
                    every minute-- when they fall, when

                    mom of one of the Columbine

                    god, I understand.  

      Tinais just ripped apart.  Alicia watches her, moved.  *


      Alicia waits on her cellphone in the corner of the conference 
      room, Kalinda and Cary in the background.

      ...Molly on the phone, chopping vegetables.  Becca and Zach 
    on the couch, pseudo-studying.  

                                  MOLLY
                    Doing great.  Grace is in her room, 
                    and Zach s friend Becca is here.

                          (looks up)
                    Oh, really?  Where are they?  

                                  MOLLY
                    Well, actually, I asked them to 
                    stay in the living room if you 
                    don t mind.  I just felt more 
                      comfortable with that.

      Alicia smiles, relieved...

                    Hey, need some help?!

    But she s gone.


      Kalinda, in tank top, track pants, bench presses.  Lifts her 
      barbell-- up, down-- as she checks out her surroundings, 
      peering one way, seeing...

      ...three Steroid MUSCLEMEN, inflated like Hulk dolls, 
      quitting for the day.  They pass her.  She peers the other 
      way, still lifting, seeing the trio stop and chat with...  

      ...a trainer in an  Iron Muscle  shirt, TREY DONOVAN (30s), 
      power Christian, tan, big smile.  A Muscleman leans in, asks 
      Trey something.  He nods.  Something going down.  They start 
      out.  And...  Kalinda drops her weights.  Follows.  Until...

      ...damn-- they enter the Men s locker room.  Kalinda 
      considers this, thinks a second.  Sighs.  Knows what she has 
    to do.  She takes out her cellphone.  And...


      ...Cary grins, in work out clothes too, approaching:

      Cary lifting weights, Kalinda spotting him, but watching Trey 
      working out on a machine across the gym.

                    She wanted to get engaged.  Right out

      Kalinda eyes another steroid muscleman stopping by Trey s 
      machine, chatting.

      Cary peers up to see Trey and the muscleman pass toward the 
      locker room.  Cary nods, gets up, follows.


    The muscleman.  He stands by Trey s locker-- a permanent 
      trainer s locker.  Trey reaches in as...

      ...Cary eyes them, pretending to open his own locker.  He sees 
      Trey offer the muscleman a baggie of something.  Pills?  Too 
    far away to see exactly.  The muscleman starts past and Trey 
      quickly closes his locker, starts to pass Cary too when...

      ...crosses toward Will s office.  She pauses there.  Looks 
    one way.  Into Will s office.  He s in there: on the phone.  
    She looks the other way toward Diane s office.  Diane in 
      there too.  She looks again at the prescription.  And 
      reluctantly knocks at Diane s office door.

      Very different from the big show of lawyers upstairs.  He

      Will, moving down a hall with Alicia.

                    Does Dr. Wesley know you re the one

                    they re vulnerable on other 
                    questions.

      door, listening.

                    Okay.

    He nods.  And Alicia starts off.  Will and Diane s eyes meet.  
    Two strategists considering this.  Will shrugs: why not?  
      Diane nods: agreed.  Meanwhile...

      ...Alicia starts away when her cell rings.   Twilight Zone.   
      Alicia stops, surprised, smiles.  She answers:

      Jackie.  Looking a little pale, but otherwise well.  In bed.  
      Alicia surprises herself by how happy she is to see her.

                                  ALICIA
                    You look good.

                                  JACKIE
                    Well, I m just trying to get some 
                    life back in me.

      Alicia chuckles.  Jackie looks at her.

                    What did I do now?

                    Whenever you re complimented, you 
                    treat it like criticism.

                                  JACKIE

                                  JACKIE
                    She s pushy.  A know-it-all.

      Jackie turns to Alicia.  Suspiciously. 

                                  JACKIE
                    Are you trying to make me feel

                    Yes.  But it s true.

      A NURSE enters, bringing in a dose of pills--

                    Take these with a full glass of

                      A practiced eye.  Not to worry.

      Alicia stares at the pills, absorbed.  And...


      Zach s bedroom door.  It s closed.  No, actually open a half 
      foot.  Closing in, we hear... 

                                  BECCA (O.S.)
                    It looks kinda naked there.


      Zach s bedroom desk-- without a computer.

                                  ZACH
                    Yeah.  I think I ll get it back 
                    when my dad s home.

      Becca sits on the floor, laptop open in her lap.  Zach lies 
    on the bed, head perched on his hand, book open unread in 
      front of him, watching her.

                                  BECCA
                    Your dad s coming home?

    She looks toward him.  Sees Zach eyeing her.  She grins:

                    The door s open.

      Becca looks toward the door, smiles, picks up a baseball 
      mitt, throws it at it, slamming the door.

                                  BECCA
                    Aren t you breaking the rules with

      Zach shrugs, studies Becca.  Hormones popping like popcorn.  
      Becca quieter, still smiling, but eyeing him.  

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    Turn your head sideways.

      Zach stares at her confused.  Becca reaches out, pushes his 
      bent arm out from under his head, making his face level with 
      hers.  She smiles and leans slowly toward... 

      ...him... slowly... slowly... 

      ...she knows how long she s stretching this out, enjoying the 
      power.  Finally her lips reach his, kisses him.  A long 
      lingering kiss.  She backs away.  Whispering:

                    It s all about tracking and 
                    barcoding.  When we take twenty 
                    pills out of stock, we scan the 
                    prescription bottle to log the 
                    pills, then scan the stock bottle.  
                    In theory, it all reconciles at the 
                    end of the day.

                          (unhappy with coworkers)
                    Some think when we re busy, they 
                    can just skip the barcoding.  When 
                    the computer reminds them, they 
                    just manually override the warning.

      Alicia considers it.  Nods.

                                  ALICIA
                    Would you be able to tell me if a 
                    certain prescription was barcoded?

                                  JILL
                    Was it filled here?
                          (Alicia nods)
                    You have the Rx number?

      Alicia hands her the photo.  Jill looks up at her:

                    My mother-in-law; she takes pictures

    Oh.  Peter thinks a moment.

                    That s a lot to consider.  

      Golden nods, starts to reply when he sees the door opening, a 
      GUARD there.

                    What s up, Dominic?

    The GUARD doesn t answer.  Just leaves the door open.  Golden 
    and Peter look toward it.  Wait.  A person finally steps into 
      sight.   

                                  PETER (CONT D)

                    And here we are again.

      Kalinda sits across from Peter and Golden.

                                  A.S.A. PINE
                    I felt it was my professional duty 
                    to follow through.  By the way, the 
                    pharmacy may not have barcoded 
                    Ben s prescription-- but they also

      Alicia, absorbing this - how much worse can it get?   Pine

    the conference table.  Just staring off into space.  
      Thinking.  Backing out, we see Alicia sits across from her.

    In silence.  Both women.  Pausing for a second.  In their 
      separate worlds.

                    He s facing four years in prison, 
                    the loss of his career-- and you

      Alicia looks toward Kalinda.  Studies her.

                                  ALICIA
                    I m amazed at how little I know 
                    about you.

                                  KALINDA
                    What do you want to know?

                                  ALICIA
                    I m not sure.  

      Knock-knock.  They look up, see Cary knocking on the glass.  
      Kalinda rolls her eyes: great.  More Cary.  

                                  CARY
                    Two things.  I looked at the

                    Yeah, only if we represent them.  
                    Right now, we don t.

      A beat as they both look at Cary, realizing...

      Zach works on his living room computer when Molly sweeps 
      past, carrying laundry to fold.

                                  MOLLY

      Zach, uncomfortable.  Wanting to work.

                                  ZACH
                    I don t even think about it that

                    computer of your dad with a hooker 
                    and a crack pipe.

      Zach freezes as Grace, hearing this, peers out of her 
      bedroom.

                                  ZACH
                    How do you-- what are you talking

      Molly studies him, sees Grace too...

    And she sweeps cheerfully into the kitchen.  Zach and Grace 
      trade a wary look.  Who is she?


      After hours.  Most of the lights off.  Just the work-out

                    You re fired.

      Alicia has an envelope in her hand.  A check.  

                                  MOLLY
                    I-- Why?

      Alicia takes the groceries from her...

                                  ALICIA
                    Here s a lesson for your next job.  
                    When you want to have a discussion 
                    about sexually transmitted diseases 
                    with your charges... talk to the 
                    parents.

                                  MOLLY
                    What?

                                  ALICIA
                    Two weeks pay.  Thank you.

                                  MOLLY
                    I never said anything about sexually 
                      transmitted diseases.  They said I 
                    said that?  They re lying.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Take the check.

                                  MOLLY
                    It s because of what I saw on their 
                    computer.  That s why.

                                  ALICIA
                    Thank you.

    And Alicia closes the door.  Hears Molly outside...

                                  MOLLY (O.S.)
                    You don t know what s going on in 
                    your own house, lady.

      Alicia kneels.  Slides the check under the door.  


    The same cop bar.  Childs with the same beer.  Waiting.  
      Checks his watch.  And... Kalinda slides into the booth 
      across from him.  Childs has a shot ready.  Kalinda takes it.  

                                  CHILDS
                    Well?

                                  KALINDA
                    They re looking for wiretaps.

      Childs frowns, worried.  Kalinda downs the shot.

                                  CHILDS
                    My wife told him.

                                  KALINDA
                    Yep.  They want me to locate the 
                      recordings.

                                  CHILDS
                    How would you do that?

                                  KALINDA
                    Through you.

                                  CHILDS
                          (nods)
                    Why doesn t hesubpoena them?

      Kalinda shrugs.  Childs considers it.

                                  CHILDS (CONT D)
                    He s worried what s on it.  Or he 
                    doesn t remember what s on it.

      Kalinda gets up to leave.

                                  CHILDS (CONT D)
                    Where are you going?


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #111   "Painkiller"   YELLOW REVISIONS   11/30/09     55.

                                  KALINDA
                    Home.

                                  CHILDS
                    I m not done.

                                  KALINDA
                          (smiles)
                    You want this to work.  You need to 
                    give me something to give them.  
                    Phone me when you have it.

    And Kalinda leaves.  Childs looks after her, suspicious.


      Alicia, Grace, Zach, and Peter.  The whole family by Jackie s 
      bedside.  Golden standing in the doorway, giving them a 
      modicum of privacy.  Jackie s thrilled to see Peter--

                                  JACKIE
                    You made it. 

    He smiles.  Strokes her hand.  Alicia watches him -- the 
      doting son.

                                  PETER
                    They taking good care of you here?

                                  JACKIE
                    Good enough.

                                  PETER
                    You need anything?  

                                  JACKIE
                    I m fine.  Happy to have you all in 
                    one room.

      A nice family moment-- the first time they ve all been 
      together in months.  Golden s phone rings.  Peter glances 
      toward him, as Golden turns away to answer.  

                                  JACKIE (CONT D)
                    So is Molly filling my shoes at home?

                                  GRACE
                    No.  Mom got rid of her.

                                  JACKIE
                    What?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #111   "Painkiller"   YELLOW REVISIONS   11/30/09     56.

                                  ZACH
                    Lasted three whole days.

                                  ALICIA
                          (to Jackie)
                    You were right.

                                  JACKIE
                    Well, I just--

    But Jackie stops herself, decides to take the compliment.

                                  JACKIE (CONT D)
                    Thank you.  

                                  ZACH
                    We miss you, grandma.

                                  JACKIE
                    You do not.

                                  ZACH
                    We do.

      Jackie looks toward Grace.  She shrugs: yeah, she sort of 
      misses her too.  Jackie takes Grace s hand as...

      ...Golden finishes up his call, crossing to Peter, whispers 
    in his ear:

                                  GOLDEN
                    Childs is giving her a listen to 
                    the taps.

      Peter looks at him: really?  Golden shrugs.  

                                  JACKIE
                    And Peter, your appeal?  How is it 
                    going?

                                  PETER
                    Well, mom.  Some new developments 
                    that could really help.

    And Peter shoots a look toward Alicia. 

                                  JACKIE
                    Well, then maybe you ll be coming 
                    home the same time I do.

                                  PETER
                    I hope so.

                    Then things can go back to normal.  
                    Wouldn t that be nice?  

      Alicia studies her.  As we back away from the family, 
      dynamics about to change.
