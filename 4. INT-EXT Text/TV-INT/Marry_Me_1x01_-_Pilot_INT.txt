some reason.  Sorry. 
(kisses her cheek)
See you on the astral plane, baber.

ANNIE
Wait!  I mean...hang back, buddy.  
Um, before the trip is officially 
over, are you sure there isn t like 
anything else you wanna ask me or 
whatever?  I ll pop some champagne,

JAKE
Man, that Daniel Day Lewis 
absolutely transformed into the 
lead of a terrible movie that 
 everyone says is great.  I m
exhausted, babe.  But have at that 
champagne.  Have at, girl.

He SLAPS her ass and heads for the bedroom.  DISAPPOINTED, 
Annie turns to the kitchen to make a drink.  Behind her, JAKE 
GRINS AS HE GETS DOWN ON ONE KNEE AND PULLS OUT A RING.  But 
before she can see him, Annie Monroe finally just SNAPS:

ANNIE
Fuck you fuck you fuck you!   

JAKE
...Sorry, what?

ANNIE
 believe you I mean, I just - I can t
 propose to me on this trip, didn t
Jake.  It woulda been so perfect.

She gives him DOUBLE FINGERS over her shoulder, then returns 
to angrily making a margarita (WHICH OCCUPIES HER THROUGHOUT).

ANNIE (CONT D)
Did your garbage friend Gil get in 
your head again about how terrible 
marriage is?  Hey, note to self: no 
 anymore, so  to self one says  note

from someone who starts every one of 
 that way.  And FYI, Gil his  jokes

 he got divorced cause he let blows ,

 maintain an and now probably can t
erection for as long as sex takes.  
Your friends are garbage people!  

JAKE
Hey, your best friend always says 
 rather get divorced than she d
 never totally married - which I ve
understood by the way - and you 
 call don ther a garbage person!

ANNIE

like her.  Dennah might think she s 
super cool now with her high-
 waisted jumpers, and her  marriage
 attitude and all that shmarriage

 called her late coming, and it s

as well switch to an AOL email

to an US Weekly of that surfer girl 
who got her arm bitten off by a 
shark! 

JAKE
I will never apologize for that!  
Bethany deserves to be treated just 
like everybody else!

ANNIE
The gist was clear!

JAKE

ANNIE
WHAT!?

She SPINS around and is STUNNED to see Jake on one knee.

ANNIE (CONT D)
Oh.  
(beat, unsure what to say)
...Yes?

JAKE
(exasperated)
Yeah, I guess, will you marry me?6.


ANNIE
 like that very much, thank you.I d

She sorta tip-toes over and looks at the RING.

ANNIE (CONT D)
Ooh, cushion cut...

She HESITANTLY KISSES him on the cheek.  Jake SIGHS, then:

JAKE
Okay everybody, come on out.

ALL THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY COME OUT FROM HIDING PLACES 
s two  Mom, Gil, Dennah, Annie AROUND THE APARTMENT (Jake s
gay Dads, etc.).  They were all there to surprise Annie after 
the proposal, but now just stare at her, MOUTHS AGAPE.  

Annie is ABSOLUTELY FLOORED.  Beat. 

ANNIE
 everyone.  Great...  Hey...it s
 MOM, weakly)(to JAKE S
Hi Mrs. Schuffman - Myrna? - too 
 soon to call you Mom I m
assuming...?

MYRNA
You mean, too soon after you called 
me bitch?

ANNIE
(has no response, beat)
Should we move on to the toasts?

Awkward silence.  GIL (31, out of shape, divorced) pipes in.

GIL
Note to self: awkward.

Annie just drops her head, MORTIFIED.  Jake is AT A LOSS.

GOOD MUSIC KICKS IN AS WE CUT TO A MONTAGE OF HAPPY PHOTOS AND 
VIDEOS OF JAKE AND ANNIE THROUGHOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP: them 
dressed as PEANUT BUTTER and JELLY for Halloween; a bunch of 
SELFIES of them kissing; a VIDEO Jake shot of him catching 
 clearly Annie singing WAY TOO LOUDLY in the shower (Annie s
the much bigger personality in all of these); etc.  The 
LAUGHTER and LOVE is a funny contrast to the epic fight we 
just witnessed, but proof nonetheless that these two idiots 
are perfect for each other.

TITLE CARD: MARRY ME7.


ACT ONE



Annie stands at her open front door, calling after all the 
Guests (who have just hurried out):

ANNIE
Any chance we can just chalk all 
that up to constructive criticism, 
gang?  Fearless feedback?
(desperate, sincere)
I love you all!

DEFEATED, she closes the door, then VERY SLOWLY TURNS AROUND 
to face Jake, SCARED.  He s INCREDULOUS.  Tense beat.  Then--

ANNIE (CONT D)
Welp, you sir have earned yourself 
what can only be described as a love-
 a  talkin making marathon.  We re
Choose Your  choice,  real dealer s
Own Adventure  kinda thing.  Should 
we stretch? 

JAKE
What.  The fuck.  Just happened.

ANNIE
(feels really bad)
 know.  I just - all I had I don t
 so today was a Kind Bar and - I m
sorry, Jake.  I love you more than 
myself.  Truly.  I will fix this.

JAKE
How?

ANNIE
(stumped)
Hmm...how indeed.  Smart.

JAKE
(laughs, amazed)
I mean, that was just spectacular.  
Even for you, Annie.  But I guess 
you did tell me you wanted a huge, 
memorable proposal, so...congrats - 
 bout this  be talkin people gon 
one for awhile!

ANNIE
...No such thing as bad press?8.


JAKE
(stands)
Listen babe, I think I m just gonna 
sleep at my place tonight if that s 
cool.  I love you.  I do.  I just 
 wanna be in this moment for don t
one more second.

ANNIE
(nods, choking up a bit)
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.  Fair enough.

He AWKWARDLY KISSES her cheek, then heads for the door--

ANNIE (CONT D)
Wait, Jake!  Just to clarify 
though...we are engaged, or we re 
not?d love to make a few   Cause I 
calls, fire off some emails, maybe 
 profile.update m LinkedIn
(off his look)
Cannot joke my way out of this.  
Good note.

JAKE
You know what?  No, we re not 
 wanna tell engaged yet.  I don t
this story for the next 60 years.  
Just - gimme a few days to regroup, 
then I ll propose again, okay?  But 
I m doing it my way this time.  Low 
key, like a normal human.  I know 
you always wanted this to be like 
 romcom, the end of some bad 90 s
 not a Jennifer Aniston but you re
 a character.  If anything, you re
lot closer to her in real life.  

ANNIE
She does seem awfully crazed about 
getting married.  

JAKE
So, do you think you can wait just 
like a little bit longer?  Or am I 
gonna end up in one of those People 
Magazine human interest stories 
where a girl snaps and pushes her 
boyfriend off a cruise ship or 
something?    

ANNIE
Pfff, me?  Are you kidding?  I can 
 chill.  Hella totally wait.  I m
 do it, whatever.  chill.  Do it, don t
(beat)
But I mean, definitely do it though, 
right?  9.


He ROLLS HIS EYES, EXASPERATED (but with love), and walks 
out.  Annie instantly COLLAPSES to the floor, SO DESTROYED.  



 best friend, DENNAH (32, hot, high-waisted jumper), Annie s
 best friend, Gil, is in shotgun.  They both drives.  Jake s
stare ahead silently, absolutely BLOWN AWAY.  

DENNAH
Wow.  Just...wow.  I feel so bad 
for them.

GIL
I know.  Me too.  
(beat, then)
Question though: when Annie said 
that thing about me not maintaining 
legit erections, do you think she 
heard that from someone or was just 
sorta guessing based on my recent 
weight gain and general malaise?

DENNAH
Unclear.  But as long as we are 
chatting: Are people not feeling my 
jumpers?  You guys can tell me if 
you don t think this is a good look.

GIL
Oh sorry, I thought you were doing 
that sorta Brooklyn-y thing where 
girls purposefully pick out the 
most unflattering clothes for their 
body type and then wear them in the 
hot sun.    

DENNAH
I am doing that.  Is it not enough 
to carry the day?

GIL
Okay so maybe there was one time.  
When I took my NyQuil too early.  
But even the greats strike out once 
in awhile.  Francis Ford Coppola 
Dr.  Robert Altman made  made  Jack ,
 Roman Polanski T and the Women ,
made a child have sex with him.   

DENNAH
I still don t get how he came outta 
that whole thing as like a Nelson 
Mandela type figure.10.


GIL
One of life s many mysteries.  Like 
black guys with English accents...
(beat, looks off)
 not wrong, though.  I did Annie s
 why I lost let myself go.  That s
Kassie, god rest her soul. 

DENNAH

GIL
Living with Barry from Barry s Boot 
Camp.  

DENNAH
Really?  Good for her.

GIL
Well, not the Barry.  A guy named 
Barry who works there.  But he s in 
incredible shape, which you know is 
very painful for me.

ANNIE

She stares at the PHOTO, fondly.  It triggers a MEMORY...12.



Annie cries on her bed as she eats the chocolate strawberries 
and drinks the champagne from the bottle.  Suddenly-- KAY 
 JUMPS OUT of the closet!  (her weird neighbor, 30 s)

KAY
CONGRATULATIONS!!!

ANNIE
AAHHHH!

Annie SCREAMS as she JUMPS UP-- SLAMS into the wall-- and 
DROPS to the ground!  Beat.  Then she PEEKS above the bed. 

ANNIE (CONT D)

KAY
Sorry.  I missed the cue to come 
out, then you guys were fighting, 
then you were sobbing 
uncontrollably.  There really was 
 never a great window.  But don t
worry, I did not pee in your hamper.

ANNIE
Thanks...?  
(climbs up onto the bed)
 Annie was bad, Kay.  Real bad.  Lil 
I gotta figure out how to fix this.

Kay sits down next to her, and rubs her back WARMLY. 

KAY
I m really sorry, Annie.  I did pee 
in it.  But I took all the clothes 
out first.

Annie just BURIES her face in her pillow, DESTROYED.  

END OF ACT ONE14.


ACT TWO



Annie SWEATS LIKE SHAQ as she and Dennah transition from 
DOWNWARD DOG to STANDING BOW in their (very) hot yoga class. 

ANNIE
Ugghhh...

Dennah easily holds the TOUGH POSE (balancing on one leg/one 
arm forward/the other behind her holding up her other foot).  
Annie WOBBLES and SHAKES and keeps PUTTING HER FOOT DOWN for 
balance (the only movement in the still class of EXPERTS).

ANNIE (CONT D)
 love just like one sip of God, I d
Diet Coke right now.

The shirtless teacher, WES (40, lean, tan), walks by them:

WES

tuladandasana.  And Annie, really 
great...determination.  Way to go.  

ANNIE

compliment for me every week. 

WES

ANNIE
Thanks, Wes.

DENNAH
Wait, so lemme get this straight

ANNIE
 Nope.  No I am not, Dennah.  Can t
 surprised either.  This is say I m
just like that time I was so 
excited to get a hamster I 
literally pet it to death.  
(shakes her head)
And now all our friends and family 
probably hate me too.  God, I 
waited for this moment for 32 
years.  And had I just waited like 
32 more seconds... 15.


They TRANSITION to another TOUGH POSE (both hands on the mat/ 
 crooked leg one leg in the air).  Dennah NAILS IT.  Annie s
SHIVERS above her as SWEAT DRIPS down her face to the mat.

ANNIE (CONT D)
 not You gotta help me.  He s
returning my calls.  He did email 
me - but unless he flew to Peru in 
the last ten hours and then 
immediately lost his wallet and 
phone - I m pretty sure his account 
got hacked.  
(sits up)
 just sit around and wait for I can t
him to propose again.  I gotta do 
something to make everyone forget 
re  you this ever happened.  C mon,
smart.  How do I fix this?  Go!   

DENNAH
Ooh, I d love to help, but I m super 
busy right now.  I m switching over 
 gonna be a sad Aunt to AOL cause I m
 also working on and whatnot.  I m
jokey ways to replace the thing at 
the bottom of my email that says

a body like one of those shapeless 
army duffel bags.  I gotta make 
some changes.  Quick.  That reminds

JAKE
A hike?  What am I, an explorer?  
Besides, I decided a long time ago 
to just be one of those people who 
s cool  exercise, if that doesn t
with everyone.  

Gil stops at an UGLY SHIRT (epaulets, pockets all over, etc.).

GIL

is the kinda shirt that says,  Hey, 
pay attention to me.

up?  No.  But did it actually turn 
out to be even better than I coulda 
ever dreamed?  Also, no.17.


GIL
Well, you dodged a bullet.  Marriage 
blows.  And the best part is now

He puts up a HI-FIVE...Jake leaves him HANGING.  

JAKE

 probably totally few days.  She s
freaking out right now.  Is it bad

their core, are basically just a 
two person Hunger Games.

apartment cause she found out the

Gil exits a dressing room in a SUPER DOUCHEY OUTFIT.  

GIL
Okay, what do you think?  Be 
honest.  First blurt.  But keep in 
mind that I feel good about it.

JAKE

minutes ago?

ANNIE (CONT D)
This is exactly what I always 
dreamed this moment would be like.  
Well, except for this next part...
(gets down on one knee)
Jake, will you marry me?

JAKE
(laughs warmly, blushes)
Yes, okay?  We re engaged.  Again.  
That was very romantic.  Thank you.  
Now please stand up.

She SMILES WIDE at him as she stands up.

JAKE (CONT D)
Hey, just outta curiosity though, 
why are we listening to the theme 
 right now?   Willy song from  Free

ANNIE
You know, I guess I was about 12 
when I started dreaming up my 
perfect proposal, and the song just 
 always wanted stuck.  Also, I ve
 me like the River someone to  hold
  That sounds nice.Jordan .

He LAUGHS, BEAMS at her, then GRABS her (like the River 
Jordan) and they KISS BIG as everyone CHEERS!  The MUSIC 
S BOSS  romcom, when-- JAKE SWELLS like the end of a bad 90 s
(50) presses STOP.Revision23.


JAKE S BOSS
Uh, not to kill the mood here, but 
did she just say you guys were in 
Mexico the last two weeks?  Cause 
you told me you were in the 
hospital, in agony, over whether or 
not to pull the plug on your dad.

Jake looks VERY CAUGHT.

SMASH CUT TO:



5 years earlier.  Annie and Jake (a year into dating) host a 
karaoke party for FRIENDS (younger Dennah/Gil/Kassie/etc.).  
My Heart Will Go On .  Gil and Kassie duet Celine Dion s

GIL
Near...

KASSIE
Far...

GIL/KASSIE
Wherever you are, I believe that 
the heart does go on...

KASSIE
(still singing)
 very flat, Gil...You re

GIL
(points at her FLAT CHEST)
 been flat your whole life...You ve

KASSIE
Screw you, Gil!

GIL
I WISH YOU EVER WOULD YOU FROZEN 
BITCH!

She THROWS the mic at him and storms off!  He follows!  The 
Guests are BLOWN AWAY (odd to see a couple bicker through a 
song about eternal love).  Kay BURSTS into tearful applause!  

KAY
What?  I liked it.

ANNIE
(jumps up, grabs the mic)
Thank you!  That was horrifying.  
(types in a song)
Okay, this next song goes out to 
Jake.  I will always love you.  
(stops herself)
Wait, just to clarify, the song is 
 not I m  You . Love Always Will  I
saying I love you.  Cause neither 
of us has said it yet.  Even though  
m  been a year.  Not that I it s
 totally cool upset by that.  I m
 the chill with like whatever.  I m
girlfriend, bra.  
(the backing track begins)
To be clear though, I don t not 
 love you, Jake.  I just wasn t
gonna say it til you did.  
(MORE)27.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Technically, I didn t say it.  
Unless you want me to so that you 
can say it back almost immediately?  
Your call here, buddy.  
(awkward beat)
In hindsight, I probably shoulda 
picked a different song.

JAKE
(laughs, then smiles wide)
I will always love you too, Annie.

ANNIE
(so touched)
Awww...
(then immediately sings)
And III-EEE-III will always love 
YOUUUUUUUUU!



GUESTS stand around, ANNOYED, as CATERERS pass appetizers.  

MYRNA
Unbelievable.

DENNAH
I mean, I have other stuff going on 
besides celebrating this engagement 
for a week straight.  What is this, 
Coachella?

 surprised he got her back.  Gil enters with Kassie.  Everyone s

GIL
Guess who s back?  Gil and Kassie.  
We re Gassie again!  Or Kil.  
Neither is great.  But, we are back!

Gil grabs a MINI BURGER and bites it, proud of himself.  31.


KASSIE
 belly)(pats Gil s
Ooh Gilly, don t ya think you 
should go for the healthy option?  
I mean, if there even is one.  What 
is this, Milwaukee?

GIL
 not cause a Kass, honey, let s
scene.  This is sorta our coming 
out party.  How bout a drink?

KASSIE
Okay, sure.  
(turns to Kevin 1)
 have a gin and tonic with one I ll
squeeze of lime but no fruit in or 
on the cup please - aggravates my 
fever blisters.  Just squirt the 
lime once, and walk away.  

KEVIN 1
 m Kevin.  We ve not a waiter, I I m
s dad?   Annie met.  A lot.  I m
(Kassie stares blankly)
I got in that bad accident leaving 
your house two years ago where I was 
thrown through the windshield of my 
car?  And landed at your feet?

KASSIE
Ohhh yeah...
 (gives everyone an  I
 shrug) remember don t
So...where are we on that G and T?

Kevin 2 MOVES to attack her-- Kevin 1 HOLDS him back.  Gil is 
ASHAMED.  Kay weirdly gives Gil a congratulatory THUMBS UP!



Jake and Annie SPEED toward the party!  They SWERVE in and 
out of traffic like the end of a 90 s romcom!

ANNIE
Everyone s really gonna hate us now!

JAKE
 not great, Annie!  Not great!It s



Jake and Annie roll off each other.  They just had sex.  

JAKE
Nice job, Annie.  Some really 
creative stuff there in the middle.

ANNIE
(laughs)
Thanks, you too.  You know, on the 
plus side of all this, I think we 
just invented botched proposal sex.  

JAKE
(laughs)
Worth it.  
(beat)
re  believe we So...wow, I can t
getting married, right?

ANNIE
  I know.  It s...terrifying.

JAKE
Could not be more scared right now.

ANNIE
Also, real talk: did not think it 
was gonna be that tough to get 
engaged.

JAKE
Yeah, that was a real dooze.

They LAUGH.  Gil enters-- Jake and Annie SCREAM!  He grabs a 
glass of water off their nightstand, and sits on the bed.  

GIL
You guys were so right about 
 ever wanna get Kassie.  I don t
back with her.  I guess sometimes 
 see a situation clearly you can t
until afterwards, and then you feel 
like it shoulda always been that 
obvious the whole time.  Like when 
any guy you know marries an Asian 
 always immediately girl, you re
s a  course!  That guy like,  Of
total Asian girl kinda guy!  How 
  did I not realize that before!? 

Jake and Annie think a beat, then BOTH NOD (it makes sense).35.


JAKE
 you do, man?So, what d

GIL
 an adult, Jake.  So I Well, I m
gallantly...had sex with her one 
last time and then snuck out in the 
middle of the night.

ANNIE
Chivalrous to the end.

GIL
(beat, smiles)
s gonna be alright, guys.   Gil Ol 
(Jake and Annie smile at 
him warmly)
Welp, congrats again on getting 
engaged.  Marriage is a blessing.  
Goodnight, my sweethearts.

He kisses their heads, and walks out.  Annie looks CONCERNED.  

ANNIE
 never be us, right?That ll

JAKE
 What, breaking into our friends 
apartment at 3am to creepily kiss 
them goodnight?

ANNIE
No, I mean, you know...divorced.

JAKE
(looks at her, sweetly)
Hey, never.  You and me are in this 
thing forever, Annie.  Or at least 
until one of us murders the other 
one.  Which is probable.

ANNIE
(laughs)
Promise?

JAKE
Promise.

They KISS, turn off the lights, then go to sleep, SO IN LOVE.
