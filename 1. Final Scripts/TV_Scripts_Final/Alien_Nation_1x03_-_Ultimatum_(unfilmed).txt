      EXT. EUCLID ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CARNIVAL - DAY

      A small ferris wheel, miniature roller coaster, raffles, 
      ring toss, spider ride, students, parents, a fund raising 
      event for the school as we pick up EMILY, BRENDA and JILL, 
      carrying her Newcomer Barbie doll, coming off a ferris 
      wheel, dizzy. (WE FOLLOW and shoot them from the invasive 
      yet distant P.O.V. of unseen observers -- hand-held, rough 
      movement.)

                                  JILL
                    My legs are jello!

                                  EMILY
                    Spatial disorientation. Neat, huh?

                                  BRENDA
                    Neat no. Queasy and dizzy yes.

      Emily is distant a beat here, looks at a game with a 
      picture of a clown in a fake jail.

                                  JILL
                            (concerned)
                    Emily?

                                  EMILY
                    It reminded me of Buck. Do you think they 
                    have decided what to do with him yet?

                                  BRENDA
                    If he's innocent, he has nothing to worry 
                    about.

      Emily reacts doubtfully.

                                  EMILY
                    I hope so, Brenda, but last night I scanned 
                    precedent cases in the Supreme Court 
                    records on my P.C. and sometimes the law 
                    makes mistakes too. Laws are enforced by 
                    people and people are biased, subjective 
                                  (MORE)                                  EMILY (CONT'D)
                    and often times prejudiced.

      Brenda kneels before Emily, holds her hands.

                                  BRENDA
                            (gentle)
                    Your father enforces the law. Do you think 
                    he's biased, prejudiced or subjective?

                                  EMILY
                            (wise)
                    No, but it's different for him. He's a 
                    Newcomer. Newcomers are not accepted. 
                    People are suspicious, quick to condemn 
                    what they don't understand or feel 
                      threatened by.

      Brenda reacts to Emily's intellect and far-sighted 
      rationale.

                                  BRENDA
                    Now where did you hear that?

                                  EMILY
                    Moodri.

                                  BRENDA
                    Moo-who?

                                  JILL
                            (explains)
                    Moodri's a Newcomer from the olden days. He 
                    lives with Emily's family, kinda like the 
                    guru you had in the sixties ...

                                  EMILY
                    You had a spiritual advisor?

      Jill rolls her eyes as they toss rings at a game.

                                  JILL
                    Emily, please stop, you'll set her off. 
                    She'll go home and play Crosby, Stills, and 
                    Nash LP's all night. If I hear "Dock of a 
                    Bay" again I'll go off-line crazy.                                  EMILY
                    I've read about the sixties, a time of 
                      enlightenment; of vision.

                                  BRENDA
                    It was an exciting time to be young.

                                  EMILY
                    What went wrong?

      They are walking along the carnival. (as if someone's 
      stalking them.)

      Emily stops in front of "The Whip", a ride which slings the 
      passengers around and around, as they get in line for the 
      ride, as a peal of screams rings out.

                                  EMILY
                    C'mon guys, physics never lets you down.

                                  JILL
                      Passadena, Emily. I can't out debate you 
                    and I'm not going. We'll watch you...

      Emily hesitates at the gate as she gives her ticket to the 
      ticket taker, climbs onto the ride, is buckled in.

                                  JILL
                    Good luck, Emily!

      Emily smiles, her expression reads, "I'm still a tad 
      scared", but she gets a determined look on her face as the 
      whip begins to go faster and faster until Emily SCREAMS, 
      stops, steels herself.

                                  VOICE (OS)
                    Mrs. Berks?

      Brenda turns to find a pair of PARAMEDICS, a MAN and a 
      WOMAN, both in their 30's, pleasant looking, I.D. badges, 
      the works.

                                  BRENDA
                    Yes?                                  PARAMEDIC MAN
                    Mrs. Rossiter in the school office asked us 
                    to tell you you had an urgent phone call.

      Brenda is concerned at this. "Who can It be?" reads her 
      expression.

                                  BRENDA
                    Could you tell Mrs. Rossiter as soon as 
                    Emily's ride is finished we'll be right 
                    over?

      Brenda points to the ride where Emily is closing her eyes 
      as the whip gains in intensity.

                                  PARAMEDIC MAN
                    Why not let us wait for Emily and bring her 
                    over when her ride's done?

                                  JILL
                    Urgent means serious, doesn't it, Mom?

      Brenda nods, unsure of how to proceed, for a beat, then 
      decides, takes Jill's hand to assure her.

                                  BRENDA
                    You'll bring Emily right over?

                                  PARAMEDIC WOMAN
                            (warm)
                      Absolutely.

      Brenda and Jill walk towards the school building which is 
      far across the playground-carnival, well out of sight as:

      "The Whip" slows, gradually comes to a halt. The two 
      paramedics stand at the gate as the riders step shakily 
      from their seats, and even Emily is dizzy as she comes 
      through the gate.

                                  PARAMEDIC WOMAN
                    Emily, dear?

      Emily steadies herself, looks at the paramedics, as over 
      their shoulder a miniature ferris wheel begins to turn, 
      motivating our cut to:      A COURTROOM CEILING FAN

      criminal court, old building, late afternoon filtered 
      sunlight as:

      GEORGE, BUCK, SUSAN, SIKES, a JUDGE and a LAWYER all are 
      waiting as the Judge reviews the papers.

                                  JUDGE
                    I have reviewed the preliminary parameters 
                    of the case. Counsel please approach the 
                    bench.

      Buck stands quiet, attentive, wearing a conservative suit.

      Sikes sits behind the fence in the spectators gallery, 
      leans forward, anxious, his fingers rapping a staccato 
      beat.

      The D.A, a smooth operator named THORPE, our Roy Cohn, 
      great suit, bad skin, cold face, seems surprised at the 
      aside, looks tolerantly toward the elderly lady judge and 
      over at LAWRENCE DARROW, a young, very short Newcomer 
      defense attorney, all about him is threadbare, shopworn, 
      and must read "underdog" and "grind." From his poorly 
      pressed polyester shirt to his thick glasses, and ripple 
      soles.

                                  JUDGE
                    Despite the larger issue of co-existence 
                    and inter-species relations that are sure 
                    to be raised here, I believe it is 
                    incumbent upon us to handle this like any 
                    other case.

      Both attorneys indicate their assent.

                                  JUDGE
                      Therefore, based on the upstanding record 
                    of the defendant's father as an upholder of 
                    the law, and the family's role in the 
                      community, let the defendant be released 
                    into the custody of his parents.                                  THORPE
                    Your Honor, what guarantees does the State 
                    have?

                                  JUDGE
                    Mr. Darrow, would your client be amenable 
                    to a guarantee bond of, say fifty-thousand 
                    dollars?

                                  DARROW
                    May I confer with my client a moment, Your 
                    Honor?

      Thorpe is miffed at this, returns to his table, shuts his 
      attache a tad more loudly than usual, irritated.

      George and Darrow confer a beat (in tongue).

                                  GEORGE
                    All I have is in my house ...

      George's eyes meet Buck's here, a beat of tacit 
      communication, of understanding, of gratitude.

                                  DARROW
                          (to Judge)
                    Mr. Francisco will put up his house, Your 
                    Honor.

      Thorpe grunts, does not look up as he gathers his papers, 
      his time will come and he is content as his Ivy league-cut 
      ASSISTANT comes over.

                                  THORPE
                    Thurgood Marshall must be doing cartwheels 
                    in his grave.

                                  ASSISTANT
                    It's no joke. Our Mr. Darrow is a Harvard 
                    man. Number one in his class, law review, 
                    the whole nine yards. Finished in one 
                    month.

      Thorpe involuntarily draws in a breath at this. Darrow 
      becomes aware of Thorpe's gaze, shoots him a wide if almost 
      childish smile as he exits.                                  THORPE
                    One month? I'm going to enjoy this war.

      Thorpe exits and his assistant picks up both of Thorpe's' 
      alligator Hermes attache cases.

      EXT. COURTHOUSE

      As George walks ahead, towards their car, Sikes and Buck 
      share a beat of silence.

                                  BUCK
                    Sorry for the trouble I caused you, Mr. 
                    Sikes.

      Sikes extends a hand, smiles.

                                  SIKES
                    Matt.

      Buck takes Sikes' hand, they shake.

      HONK! HONK!

      Susan is at the wheel of the family station wagon and 
      George comes back around, cool, still embarrassed, unable 
      to deal with the entire spectacle.

      Buck and George pass one another, silent, unable to speak. 
      This is noticed by Sikes who waves to Buck as they drive 
      off.

      Sikes puts an arm on George's shoulder.

                                  SIKES
                    I'm buying ...

      INT. POLICE BAR - NIGHT

      The motif is wanted posters wallpaper, lines of retired 
      police badges cover the bar, saw dust floors, pools of 
      light, stuffed with boisterous off-duty cops who 
        occasionally lower their voices, whisper, glance towards:

      Sikes, who has violated unwritten protocol by bringing a 
      Newcomer to the place, sitting in a booth at the far end of 
      the bar giving them a commanding view of the place as:      WAITRESS, dressed in a Frederick's version of a cop 
      uniform, places a single drink in front of Sikes and one 
      dozen in front of George who proceeds to down the drinks in 
      gulps to Sikes' horror.

                                  SIKES
                    Okay, that's it, I'm the designated driver 
                    for the 90's.

      Sikes sips his drink, stares down to George's dozen.

                                  GEORGE
                    When you drink it acts as a depressant, 
                    your senses blur, a comfortable buzz sets 
                    in. When we drink it sharpens our senses, 
                    we become intensely focused, subjectivity 
                    fades and a state approaching our vaunted 
                      objectivity is attained ...

      Sikes sits back, shakes his head, amused.

                                  GEORGE
                            (continued)
                    Did I make an inadvertent joke? Did I make 
                    a pun? Explain.

                                  SIKES
                    No, George, you're right on the money. It's 
                    just that when we go through hell it's 
                    nice, customary even, for a friend to offer 
                    his advice over a meal, a drink, whatever, 
                    but it's all redundant here after two pops 
                    you become Sigmund Freud and I wind up a 
                    basket case.

      George understands, Sikes takes up his own beer.

                                  GEORGE
                      I understand, but it goes without saying I 
                    value your opinion, Matt.

                                  SIKES
                    Go easy on Buck, George. It's a tough age. 
                    When I was sixteen it was touch and go 
                    which side of the law fence I would wind up 
                    on. 
                                  (MORE)                                  SIKES (CONT'D)
                    I pulled out of the same kind of tailspin 
                    by the skin of my teeth.

      George downs #5, slides the empty glass aside, agrees. 
      Sikes' attention is slowly divided between their 
        conversation and the bar and will be increasingly drawn to 
      the bar.

                                  GEORGE
                    Buck is my son, my responsibility, I accept 
                    the blame.

                                  SIKES
                    You should, to a degree.

                                  GEORGE
                      I appreciate your candor, even though it 
                    hurts.

                    It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see: 
                    spend more time at home, go to ball games 
                    together, go on a camping trip, hang 
                    together. Father son stuff. Buck needs you 
                    and you need him more than you know.

                    To be a successful detective, or a success 
                    in any field for that matter, you give one 
                    hundred percent of yourself. What does that 
                    leave for your personal life?

                    Question of the year, George. I never even 
                    came close to the formula with my ex.
                    Sikes' attention has turned slightly 
                    towards the bar and:

      A ROOKIE COP, lady cop, In her 20's, buxom, hot, intense 
      eyes, as if the guy she's talking to Is an excuse to 
      eyeball Sikes.

                    haired unit at the bar, the one making 
                    heavy-eye contact with me. Tell me what you 
                    see.

      George turns to the Rookie cop, gives her a scrutinizing 
      glance.

                                  GEORGE
                    I see a sexually aggressive 38D-26-35, who 
                    has more than a passing interest in your 
                    presence and your physique.

                                  GEORGE
                    Smile back. Discreetly, yet directly. If 
                    she wishes a more intimate contact she will 
                    take this as an invitation, if she does 
                    not, she will turn away.

      Sikes turns and deliberately gives a very hammy and slow 
      smile.

                                  SIKES
                            (grinning)
                    I feel like one of those jerks who writes 
                    letters to girlie magazine editors.

      Sikes covers his face, thusly mortified, as a BIG MAN COP 
      behind the rookie thought Sikes was smiling at him.

      Sikes looks up to the perfect Vargas-girl in rookie 
      uniform, name is CHERYL KANE.

                                  CHERYL
                    I'm Cheryl Kane. Newly assigned to your 
                    precinct. Detective Sikes may I presume...

      Cheryl hardly pays any attention to George who dons his 
      jacket as there is heat radiation passing between Sikes and 
      Cheryl.                                  GEORGE
                    You're on your own. See you in the morning, 
                    Matt.

      Cheryl barely acknowledges George, slides into the booth 
      across from Sikes, all systems go.

                                  CHERYL
                    I've been hoping we could get together, say 
                    maybe over dinner tomorrow night. We could 
                    discuss police procedures.

      Cheryl's hands are under the table, Sikes jumps, clears his 
      throat, looks around to see if anyone saw.

                                  SIKES
                    What could I tell you about procedures? At 
                    this rate you'll make commissioner your 
                    first year ...

      Cheryl smiles, rises, returns to the bar on legs that don't 
      quit.

      EXT. FRANCISCO HOUSE NIGHT

      As George crosses from the curb towards the front door, 
      nearly trips over one of Emily's skates which he picks up, 
      smiles, "kids."

                                  GEORGE
                    Emily, Emily ...

      Carries the skate through the front door.

      INT. FRANCISCO HOUSE

      As George hangs up his coat, starts towards Buck's room, 
      from which come the sounds of a Newcomer instrument at 
      somewhat LOUD TONES, making George wince, the familiar 
      clicking sounds of George's native tongue make him turn to 
      see:

                                  MOODRI
                            (voice)
                      Restraint, George.                                  GEORGE
                      Restraint?

      Moodri stands at the door of his humidity controlled room, 
      nods sagely.

                                  MOODRI
                      Restraint. Communication. Compassion.

                                  GEORGE
                            (calm)
                    Restraint ... Communication... 
                      Compassion ...

      Moodri smiles, winks at George, who enters.

      INT. BUCK'S ROOM

      where in the moonlight, framed in his window, Buck sits 
      strumming his Newcomer instrument which trills an almost 
      HYPNOTIC MELODIC CHORD, as George enters, sits on the bed 
      across from Buck, a beat...

        (SUBTITLED):

                                  GEORGE
                    You have the gift. Your mother's side of 
                    the family could be great musicians if they 
                    wanted..

      Buck continues to play.

                                  BUCK
                    You speak in tongue?

                                  GEORGE
                    Whatever the tongue, the message is the 
                    same.

                                  BUCK
                    Message?

      George pauses, this does not come easy.                                  GEORGE
                    I'm sorry. I'll try to be a better Dad to 
                    you from here on. Forgive me?

      George raises an open palm-towards Buck who continues to 
      strum. George gives up, starts to rise, when suddenly Buck 
      seizes his hand.

                                  BUCK
                    I let you down. I'll try harder to be a 
                    better son. I'll make you proud of me, 
                    you'll see.

                                  GEORGE
                    I am proud of you, Buck.

                                  BUCK
                    I'm sorry, Dad.

      A tear slides down George's cheek and he quickly wipes it, 
      as if embarrassed.

                                  BUCK
                            (continued)
                    Moodri says; tears are signs of strength 
                    not weakness.

      Father and son embrace.

      INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF SIKES' APARTMENT - NIGHT

      As Sikes comes up the steps, arms laden with mail, 
      groceries, newspapers, dry cleaning, singles life detritus, 
      dropping some, picking it up, dropping it again as:

      CATHY comes out, dressed to the nines, sees Sikes 
      predicament as he fumbles with the outer door lock.

                                  CATHY
                    Let me give you a hand

                                  SIKES
                    I've just about got it...

      BONK!

      A half gallon container of milk falls on Sikes' foot, 
      causing him to drop everything, he winces.      Cathy and Sikes gather groceries, kneeling together on the 
      floor.

                                  SIKES
                    Hey, don't keep your date waiting on my 
                    account.

                                  CATHY
                    "My date" is a medical Symposium on 
                      epidemiology. The study of epidemics.

      Cathy, close to Sikes, quietly reaches forward to brush an 
      eyelash off Sikes' cheek, but Sikes flinches as if she took 
      a swing at him, causing him to recoil, to see his revulsion 
      which he feels very unforgettable about, a beat of this 
      passes silently between them.

                                  CATHY
                    There was a lash on your cheek.

                                  SIKES
                    I'm head shy. What comes of having an old 
                    man who used to wail the tar out of me and 
                    my kid brother.

      Cathy is noble, manages a smile, but is attuned to the 
      bottom line.

                                  CATHY
                    Night, Mr. Sikes.

      Sikes is left alone in the hallway, feeling like a boor, 
      arms filled with junk which he now lets fall, pulls a beer 
      from the pile.

      INT. FRANCISCO BEDROOM - NIGHT

      SUSAN'S ARM

      has broken out in large red scabs, as she sits at her 
      dressing table studying her arm, rubbing cortisone cream 
      onto the lesion, in the mirror we see George enter, blowing 
      his nose, sniffling, wiping his eyes.                                  SUSAN
                    I have more lesions. I'm afraid the 
                    cortisone cream is not working.

                                  GEORGE
                    Looks to me like it's time to see one of 
                    our doctors.

      Susan tacitly agrees as George turns on the news, Fox news.

      on the case.

                                  SUSAN
                    I worry about Buck getting a fair trial.

                                  GEORGE
                    Fair to whom?

                                  SUSAN
                    You're right. I'm being subjective. Thank 
                    you.

                                  GEORGE
                    Oh, and please remind Emily about her toys. 
                    I nearly killed myself on a skate coming 
                    in.

                                  SUSAN
                    Brenda took her and Jill to her school 
                    carnival this afternoon while we were in 
                    court. They probably stopped off for a junk 
                    food attack.

                                  GEORGE
                    At least one of the Francisco's knows how 
                    to make friends.

      Susan hears the tone in George's voice, comes over to him, 
      sits down, begins rubbing his back, HUMMING, kisses him 
      until George begins to hum and ...

      RING! RING!                                  GEORGE
                    Time out, George.

      Susan playfully bites George's ear.

                                  SUSAN
                    It must be Emily.

      INT. FOYER

      Susan opens the door as George comes down the stairs to 
      find Brenda there, frantic.

                                  BRENDA
                    Is Emily with you?!

      EXT. POLICE STATION NIGHT

      as several patrol cars come to a SCREECHING halt in front 
      of the building, officers rush from the cars, passing:

      ALBERT, who has paused up the block, a hundred feet, as he 
      was on his way in to talk to:

      RAPPER JACK, young, black, porkpie hat, mirrored shades, 
      gold chains, untied Reeboks, a tattered deck of cards 
      resting on an upturned box, fast hands, a 3-card Monte 
      artist who talks in lumbering rap jargon that doesn't jive.

                                  RAPPER JACK
                            (rhyming slang)
                    Yo, my man don be shy, Step up to Rappa-
                    Jack - just say hi, Find the black ace, an 
                    bust my case.

      Rapper Jack shuffles faster and faster, stops, Albert, 
      points, wins. Rapper Jack GROANS.

                                  RAPPER JACK
                    Makes me cry on his very first try.
                    Practice is over. Got some green, muffin-
                    head?

      Albert takes out a pile of bills, innocent to the 
      lascivious look it draws from Rapper Jack.

                                  ALBERT
                    I got paid today-

                                  RAPPER JACK
                    Lay it down, and make me frown.

      Rapper Jack nods, shuffles, stops, Albert picks. Loses. 
      Rapper Jack shows him the Ace of Spades, scoops up Albert's 
      money.

                                  RAPPER JACK
                    Mess with the bess, die like the ress ...

      SERGEANT DOBBS rounds the corner, on his way to the 
      precinct. Rapper Jack's cards vanish.                                  DOBBS
                    What is this?

                                  RAPPER JACK
                      Reagan-omics.

                                  ALBERT
                    Thank you for letting me play, Mr. Rapper 
                    Jack.

      Rapper Jack and his shill manage quick smiles.

                                  DOBBS
                    Play? You played with these scam artists?!

      Albert concedes this, Rapper Jack and shill bolt.

                                  ALBERT
                    And I lost, but they did promise I could 
                    play next payday. I think I've got the hang 
                    of gambling.

      Sergeant Dobbs rolls his eyes, casts a final look down the 
      street at the quickly retreating figures of Rapper Jack and 
      his shill, Dobbs walks Albert into the station house.

      INT. STATION HOUSE DAY ROOM NIGHT

      The shift assembles, hushed voices, as the CAPTAIN GRAZER 
      enters with George. The room falls silent.

                                  GRAZER
                    What we have on our hands, as of this 
                    minute, is a missing child Last seen at the 
                    Euclid School carnival where she got 
                    separated from the people she was with, who 
                    saw nothing and know nothing. Pictures?

      George passes out a stack of Emily's photo

                                  GRAZER
                            (continued)
                    This is family business, it's personal. I

                    dust team over to her house for skin 
                    samples. I want a round-the-clock hotline 
                    number. I want radio and TV coverage.

                    If she's lost, she's scared. If this is 
                    about abduction, kidnapping or worse, the 
                    first hours are crucial.

      Francisco and Sikes rushes in as the briefing breaks up, 
      goes to George.

                                  GRAZER
                            (continued)
                    - Sikes will help you any way they can.

                                  SIKES
                          (a whisper)
                    Emily probably just wandered off.

                                  GEORGE
                            (doubtful)
                    Emily is logical objective, and highly 
                      intelligent. She wouldn't just "wander off" 
                    like that.

                                  SIKES
                    Either way you've got the whole force 
                    behind you. We'll find her. We will.

                                  GRAZER
                          (to the room)
                      Questions?

      Silence; Sikes pats George on the shoulder as the briefing 
      ends and they exit.

      INT. LOCKER ROOM

      as Sikes and George enter to a wave of patrolmen LAUGHTER.

                                  COP'S VOICES (OS)
                    As I see it; scratch one baby Slag. 
                    Somebody did a public service.

      Sikes touches George's shoulder to say "easy".

                                  GEORGE
                    It's okay. I'm chilled.

      As they round a locker to see a huge cop named KOWALSKI 
      who's holding forth with about ten other cops all of whom       grow silent, turn away at George's appearance. Not so with 
      Kowalski, who lights a cigar, eyes George, who steps to his 
      locker which is near Kowalski's. George pauses, points 
      under the bench.

                                  GEORGE
                    Is that little thing under there yours, 
                    Kowalski?

      Kowalski tries to see under the bench where George points.

                                  KOWALSKI
                    I don't see nothing. What is it?

      POW!

                                  GEORGE
                    Your brain, waxjob.

      George knees Kowalski in the face so hard the giant goes 
      rocketing back into a wall of lockers, crushes them, 
      charges back, night stick out. George deftly sidesteps, 
      winds up like a fastball pitcher, twists the stick from 
      Kowalski's hand, swings like a driving iron into Kowalski's 
      crotch, as two other cops try to restrain him and he hurls 
      them aside like paper dolls. Kowalski pulls his revolver

      Sikes dives for it.

                                  SIKES
                    No. No. No!

      George is tackled down by six cops who can barely restrain 
      him as Kowalski has Sikes in the air, about to hurl him 
      into a row of lockers.

      WHISTLE SOUNDS!

      All fighters turn, stop, look at the doorway where a 
      SERGEANT DOBBS stands, disgusted, shaking his head at the 
      tangle of bodies, the destroyed locker room.

                                  SERGEANT DOBBS
                      Francisco, report to the Captain!                                  SIKES
                    What?! It wasn't his -

                                  SERGEANT DOBBS
                    Did I rap on your cage, Sikes!?
                          (to all)
                    L.A.'s finest. The question is; finest 
                    what?

      George exits.

      EXT. PRECINCT - NIGHT

      as George comes down the steps, wrapping a towel around his 
      bloody hand, comes over to Captain Grazer who is climbing 
      into his car.

                                  GRAZER
                    That wasn't like you, Francisco. You're off 
                    active.

      George is stunned.

                                  GEORGE
                    But Captain, it wasn't my fault

                                  GRAZER
                    I'm not interested in explanations, just 
                    results. This is for your own good. You're 
                    too close to this case. It's personal. The 
                      inter-species thing could blow up in our 
                    far-, on this one. I don't you on the 
                    street seeing red.

                                  GEORGE
                    Captain, please

                                    CAPTAIN
                    It's an order, Francisco. It's regulations. 
                    It's for the best. Go home. Let us do our 
                    job.

      Grazer gets into his car.

                                  GEORGE
                            (blurts)
                    Do you believe the same men who make Slag 
                                  (MORE)                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    jokes are the same men to find my 
                      daughter?!

                                  GRAZER
                    Yes I do. Because when we put on these 
                    badges, we're not black, not white, yellow, 
                    green or blue we're cops.

                                  GEORGE
                    ...Cops.

                                  GRAZER
                    Cops, and that cuts across all lines ...

      Grazer drives out. George watches him leave. Down the steps 
      comes Sikes feeling his bruised jaw.

                                  SIKES
                    Is that what you call "chilled out?!"

                                  GEORGE
                    Grazer says I'm too personally involved, 
                    that it's regulation.

                                  SIKES
                    What is?

                                  GEORGE
                    He took me off the case!

      Sikes watches the captain's car drive off.

      INT. THE FRANCISCO HOUSE

      as George and Sikes enter, met at the door by Susan, who 
      sees George's bloody hand.

                                  GEORGE
                    I'm okay. Any word?

                                  SUSAN
                    No. Nothing yet.
                    PHONE RINGS! Once...twice a beat here.

      Buck I bounds down the stairs, I airs, grabs the phone 
      before Sikes can get it.                                  BUCK
                    Hello? ...

                                    WOMAN'S VOICE
                            (phone)
                    Check your mailbox, Slag. Special delivery.

      Sikes hears this, stops Buck from rushing to the mailbox.

                                  SIKES
                    I'll go.

      Sikes turns to George.

                                  SIKES
                            (continued)
                    Keep them inside.

      George nods, Sikes exits.

      EXT. FRANCISCO HOUSE

      Sikes exits, pulls his gun, looks about. Houses, trees, 
      darkness, it's the normalcy, the absence of activity that 
      motivates the tension here. Sikes cautiously approaches the 
      mailbox, touches an ear to it as if listening for a bomb, 
      hears nothing, pulls a stick from a nearby pile of leaves 
      and brush, flattens himself on the ground, slowly pulls 
      open the mailbox expecting an explosion and ... nothing. 
      Sikes quietly approaches the mailbox, inserts the stick, 
      curious, feels something, slides it out.

      A NEWCOMER BARBIE with an 8mm video-cassette taped around

      TV SCREEN - MOMENTS LATER

      Static, leader at the head of the tape, the set flashes 
      them several color and tint changes.

      Buck steps into frame, tries to manually adjust the color, 
      contrasts, etc.

                                  BUCK
                    It's locked in.

      Sikes, George, Susan, Moodri, Buck are in the family room, 
      watching TV as on the screen:      From the shadows there steps a hooded figure with the 
      PURIST SYMBOL on his grand wizard-like gown, the figure 
      LAUGHS.

                                  PURIST
                    Hello Slags and Slag lovers.

      The hooded figure lights a torch, casting illumination on 
      two more hooded figures flanking a chair holding Emily.

      Susan reacts.

                                  SUSAN
                    My baby!

      George comforts Susan, who begins to CRY.
                    Emily looks directly at the camera.

                                  EMILY
                    I'm okay. They haven't hurt me. They said 
                    for you to listen real good and...

      The main hooded figure gestures and a second hooded figure 
      clamps a hand over Emily's mouth.

                                  PURIST
                    Let's talk deal. Release Mrs. Brett from 
                    jail within 24 hours and we spring the 
                    little Slag. Jerk us around and we sell her 
                    for spare graft parts.

      Sikes leans back. For him the second shoe just fell.

      Hooded figure gestures, camera swings to:

      EMILY

      who though dirty, and scared, is courageous.

                                  EMILY
                    Don't worry, Mom, and take special care of 
                    my pet, Beedoes.

      The screen goes to static ... and a WHINING NOISE becomes 
      audible.                                  SUSAN
                    Who is Mrs. Brett?

                                  SIKES
                      A homegrown looney.

                                  BUCK
                    The leader of the Purist movement.

                                  GEORGE
                      Twenty-four hours. Ten P.M. tomorrow night. 
                    Where is she being held?

                                  SUSAN
                    It won't work. Their demand is impossible 
                    to grant, George.

                                  GEORGE
                    Susan, do you realize what you're saying?

                                  SIKES
                    Susan's right, George. You know the drill. 
                    No deals with the kidnappers or terrorists.

                                  GEORGE
                    If we don't deal Emily dies.

      Susan understands, takes George's hand.

                                  MOODRI
                    In these matters there is no bargain to be 
                    made, no truce struck with evil.

      George turns to Sikes, who picks up the phone.

                                  SIKES
                    Operator, get me nine-one-one.

      The DOORBELL RINGS, Buck opens the door.

      THE PRINT TEAM, which consists of a chain-smoking, fast-
      talking pair of experts, dog-eared, perpetually tired, have 
      seen it all and then some kind of guys named "NICOTINE" 
      ROBERTS and PARKER. They are like an oldmarried couple 
      constantly bickering, at odds, and finishing each other's 
      thoughts.                                  NICOTINE
                    No. We're not with the census bureau. We're 
                    here to dust for prints, - er - Newcomer 
                    skin flakes, in the kids room.

      They enter, led by Buck. George sags onto the stairs, 
      cradles his head in his hand, desperate.

      INT. FRANCISCO HOUSE HALLWAY

      Nicotine and Parker, who talk in staccato rhythms, lug 
      their cases along the hallway, escorted by Buck.

                                  NICOTINE
                    Nice place.

                                  PARKER
                    Loud colors.

      Buck opens the door to Emily's room.

                                  NICOTINE
                    Thanks.

                                  PARKER
                    We'll call you.

      Parker closes the door.

      INT. EMILY'S ROOM

      Dark, scary. Moonlight shines through an open window.

                                  NICOTINE
                    It's dark...

      CLICK! Parker hits a light switch.

                                  PARKER
                    It's light.

      The room is in shambles, furniture broken, wallpaper flaked 
      off the wall, bed clothes and toys in shreds, formed into 
      what seems like a huge hornet's nest suspended from the 
      ceiling to the floor, as if spun from threads.                                  NICOTINE
                    A nest?

                                  PARKER
                    For who? Big Bird?

      CHEEP! A sound is heard, cricket-like.

                                  NICOTINE
                    A noise.

                                  PARKER
                      Definitely not a bird noise.

      The debris and the junk is furrowed as something RUSTLES 
      through. Nicotine and Parker advance, pull their guns until

      CHEEP! grows louder, more emphatic, and suddenly debris 
      explodes upward as Nicotine SCREAMS, something has shot up 
      his trouser leg. He SCREAMS, fights, falls over backwards. 
      Parker covers with his gun, unable to help, until Nicotine 
      rips off his pants to reveal a small, furry creature on 
      Nicotine's thigh, SQUEAKING, biting. Parker is kneeling 
      with his gun on the creature that suddenly jumps on him. 
      Parker now SCREAMS, falls over backwards as Nicotine grabs 
      the pistol, cocks it.

      BANG! The door whips open.

                                  BUCK
                    Beedoes! NO!

      The creature relents. Nicotine and Parker look as the 
      creature scrambles across the room into Buck's hand.

                                  NICOTINE
                    I don't want to know...

                                  PARKER
                    A hamster from hell ...

                                  BUCK
                    Emily's pet.                                  NICOTINE
                    "Emily's pet." I'd settle for a serial 
                    killer just now.

      Buck places the creature in a small cage and watches as the 
      creature proceeds to bump and throw itself into the metal 
      bars in one corner.

      INT. FRANCISCO KITCHEN

      Kitchen Clock:

      shows 11:00, continues to TICK LOUDLY as-

      George sits quietly at the table, staring. Susan scratches 
      her arm where it shows splotches, studies George a beat as 
      tears stream down George's face. (SUBTITLES)

                                  SUSAN
                    What's wrong?

                                  GEORGE
                    It's not right for you to see me like this.

                                  SUSAN
                    We've seen each other in worse moments. 
                    Aboard the ship?

                                  GEORGE
                    No, even the ship was not this bad.

      Susan SIGHS, concedes, the bond is strong.

                                  SUSAN
                    You'll find her. I believe in you. We all 
                    do.

                                  GEORGE
                    No. Not me. Grazer took me off the case.

                                  SUSAN
                    He can't do that.

                                  GEORGE
                    He can and did. He says I'm too close to 
                    the case.                                  SUSAN
                    Being too close to the case means you'll go 
                    all out...

                                  GEORGE
                    Not to them.

      Susan reaches out, touches George's hand which he kisses 
      and notices the red blotches on it.

      KNOCK. KNOCK

      comes at the kitchen door, which Susan opens to find Brenda 
      is there, holding a pan of brownies. George looks away as 
      Brenda stammers, sorry, awkward, powerless.

                                  BRENDA
                    I'm sorry to barge in like this. I just 
                    wanted to say how I never in a million 
                    years thought ...
                            (trails off)
                    Words sound so silly at times like 
                    these ... I told the police all I know. I 
                    baked you some brownies.

      George rises, pushes past Susan, says nothing to Brenda, 
      who hands Susan the brownies, leaves as Moodri comes into 
      the room, looks at Susan.

                                  MOODRI
                    You'd think she'd know we don't eat 
                    brownies. Bluch...

      Susan sits, Moodri touches her shoulder.

                                  MOODRI
                            (continued)
                      Strength...

      Susan sighs.

                                  SUSAN
                    Strength.

      EXT. ABANDONED IRONWORKS - NIGHT

      Tall rusted buildings, piles of iron tailings, broken 
      windows, a faint light from within.      A checkers, a chess set, a tic-tac-toe all lined up.

      A small hand enters frame to win the chess game.

                                  EMILY
                      Checkmate.

      A Purist wearing a WOLF MASK shakes his head in amazement, 
      looks at the accomplices wearing a RABBIT, and FROG MASKS, 
      respectively.

                                  EMILY
                    Sorry.

      Rabbit, Wolf, Frog having been playing her at various games 
      being soundly trounced..

                                  EMILY
                    Excuse me, but how much longer must I stay 
                    here?

                                  WOLF
                    Depends how long it takes to trade you for 
                    our friend. By tomorrow at this time all of 
                    this turns into a bad dream.

                                  EMILY
                    I'd like to believe you...

      Emily triple jumps, wins the checkers game.

                                  WOLF
                    Well, thank you....-

                                  EMILY
                    But statistically speaking, kidnapping for 
                    ransom or a bargain toot has historically 
                    proven to be counterproductive.

      Rabbit and Frog look at one another as this little tidbit 
      of information sinks through, Emily wins the tic-tac-toe 
      game.

                                  WOLF
                    Button it, Slag!

      Emily jumps at the sudden assault as Wolf goes over to 
      huddle with Frog and Rabbit who are shaking their heads,       pointing to their watches and nodding to Emily whose eyes 
      mist with tears.

                                  EMILY
                          (to herself)
                    I must not cry. I cannot cry. I will not 
                    cry.

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT

      as George walks the deserted streets of a dangerous 
      neighborhood, passes a bank clock that reads: 1:00 A.M. 
      Hustlers, street people, homeless, all of whom motion and 
      gesture at him as he comes to:

      A NEWCOMER SHRINE

      A small steel facade with the sign "OBJECTIVITY RETREAT", 
      the Newcomer version of a Christian Science Reading Room 
      where he sees:

      A SALVATION ARMY NEWCOMER

      passing out sandwiches to the poor and plastic bags of 
      bloody beaver. George declines, enters.

      INT. OBJECTIVITY RETREAT

      as George enters a dark circular room: tatami mats, coved 
      circular ceiling, mist. He nods greetings to the other 
      Newcomers, removes his shoes, lies on his back in a circle 
      of Newcomers. He joins hands, closes his eyes, the entry 
      door slides shut plunging them into darkness. They start to 
      hum (filter treated) as from the coved ceiling there 
      appears:

      A pin prick of blue God light, which widens into a star 
      sized beam of light which widens to a beam of close 
      encounters light. The tight circle of Newcomers rises to 
      kneeling position, breaks off, each participant turns to a 
      partner in couples. George opens his eyes to find himself 
        face-to-face with:

      MOODRI

      whose wide eyes also reflect surprise at seeing George. 
      They speak in Newcomer tongue with SUBTITLES.                                  MOODRI
                    How long has it been since you came to a 
                    retreat?

                                  GEORGE
                    About as long as it's been since I walked 
                    on salt water.

                                  MOODRI
                    What brings you now?

      George pulls the revolver from his windbreaker. Moodri 
      looks at it, then into George's eyes.

                                  MOODRI
                    Please communicate regarding this ...

                                  GEORGE
                    I am torn between two worlds. That which we 
                    left which you told me had culture and 
                    great vision and that of violence and 
                    hostility where I find myself ... wanting 
                    to kill

                                  MOODRI
                    You were not born when I left First World. 
                    There we were treated as slaves, beneath 
                    contempt, beasts of burdens, items of 
                      convenience.

                                  GEORGE
                    And what do we have here?

                                  MOODRI
                      ...Freedom.

                                  GEORGE
                    To do their biding, play their games, feign 
                      tolerance. It's a strange species.

                                  MOODRI
                    Define strange?

      The blue light from above beams wider.                                  GEORGE
                    I find them vicious, vindictive, petty 
                    and ...
                            (pauses)

                                  MOODRI
                            (senses more)
                    "And yet?"

                                  GEORGE
                    - and yet, at the same time, they are 
                    capable of great art, compassion, 
                      sacrifice, even nobility, love.

                                  MOODRI
                    The next millennium will be a trial for 
                    this world, as the next nineteen hours will 
                    be for you.

                                  GEORGE
                      Officially I was removed so my training, my 
                      expertise, can't be used to save my own 
                    child. I can't entrust her life to them.

                                  MOODRI
                    No, you prefer to rely on this

      Moodri glances down at the gun.

                                  GEORGE
                    I have my limits.

      The light beam turns hot-white, widens, begins to close.

                                  MOODRI
                    If you wish to find Emily. You have 
                    something far stronger at your disposal. 
                    Something she reminded us of in the 
                    tape ...

      George is confused.

                                  GEORGE
                    Be clear.                                  MOODRI
                          (a whisper)
                    Beedoes.

      George is skeptical, the white light reverts to blue, and 
      narrows, plunging them into:

                                  GEORGE
                            (skeptical)
                    Her pet?

      DARKNESS ...

      INT. FRANCISCO HOUSE - EMILY'S ROOM - MINUTES LATER

      as George bursts into the room, startling Nicotine and 
      Parker who are working.

                                  GEORGE
                    Beedoes!

                                  PARKER
                    The little monster? Over there Only keep it 
                    away from us, George.

      George goes over to Beedoes' cage, sits down and CHEEP! 
      CHEEP!

      Susan and Buck enter, concerned, study the cage a beat.

                                  BUCK
                    It's like he's trying to break out.

      George reaches into the cage, picks up the furry, little 
      creature, studying it.

                                  GEORGE
                    Beedoes? What do you say we find Emily 
                    together? Team up?

      Beedoes bites George.

                                  GEORGE
                    Ow! He bit me! This is ridiculous!

      George sucks his thumb, angry, as a CUCKOO CLOCK SOUNDS ... 
      4 A.M.                                      END ACT II                                        ACT III

      EXT. PURIST HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

      as we arm down past an old neon clock that reads 4:30 A.M., 
      passing a stark Purist graffiti sign, "welcome to Earth - 
      now go home."

      A dark sedan pulls into the alley, from the sedan steps 
      Sikes,' who cautiously makes his way towards the basement 
      door with the Purist emblems splashed on it in day-glo 
      colors.

      Sikes looks about, KNOCKS TWICE on the iron door, a man 
      with a mission.

      A peephole zips open, raucous MUSIC and LAUGHTER are much 
      in evidence, a mean FACE fills the peephole.

                                  FACE
                    Get lost!

      ZIP! Peephole is closed. Sikes takes a hundred dollar bill 
      from his pocket, KNOCKS again, mean face again appears. 
      Sees the bill, an arm reaches out. Sikes seizes the arm. 
      Twists it. The bouncer SCREAMS, opens the door inwards.

      Sikes smiles sweetly as the bouncer tries to pull his 
      damaged arm from the peephole.

      INT. PURIST HEADQUARTERS

      A twisted VFW hall, huge Purist banners hang from ceiling, 
      to Death to Newcomers", "Purify the Race" slogans adorn the 
      walls.

      Purists, many dressed similar to skinheads, almost para- 
      military, are drinking beer at card tables, playing darts, 
      using painted Newcomer faces for targets as:

      Sikes walks through this tableau, over to a bar where a 
      LADY BARTENDER wearing a t-shirt that says, "Welcome to 
      Earth, Now Go Home", comes over, gives him the up and down.

                                  BARTENDER
                    Call it.                                  SIKES
                    One liquor license, straight up.

                                  BARTENDER
                    What's it to you?

      Sikes places his badge on the bar.

                                  SIKES
                    Who's asking?

      Bartender is not impressed or concerned.

                                  BARTENDER
                    ...Your mother.

      Bartender presses a button on the bar and an air-raid SIREN 
      SOUNDS, music stops, conversation halts, all eyes turn 
      towards Sikes who holds up his badge.

                                  SIKES
                    Hello, taxpayers.

      RATTLE, CLATTER, BUMP!

      Guns, knives, clubs, mace, chains, all fall from the 
      pockets of the Purists wishing not to be caught with 
      concealed weapons.

                                  SIKES

                    You people making the world safe for 
                      democracy?

      A big Purist drops a snubbed-nosed .32. Sikes grabs the man 
      by the neck, pushes him down onto the floor.

                                  SIKES
                    You dropped something. Fascist, bigot,

                    but first pick up what you dropped.

      Purist inches towards his gun on the floor, as Sikes walks 
      amidst the crowd.                                  SIKES

                    the same; poverty, prejudice, scapegoats

      Purist goes for it.

      Sikes does a dive, roll, comes into a combat firing kneel 
      right in the Purist's face, gun aimed.

      CLICK!

                      -stupidity even?

      Sikes cocks his pistol, puts it in the Purist's mouth. 
      Purist hands his pistol over.

                                  SIKES
                    So. Personally speaking. I'm losing my 
                    patience with you people.

      Purist, sweating, gun in his mouth. Other Purists don't 
      move, their women glare at Sikes as he passes, pulling down 
      the banners.

                                  SIKES

                    crossed the line today, made me a lucky 
                    man.

      Purist suddenly takes a sucker punch at Sikes who ducks, 
      kick boxes his attacker in one smooth move, out cold onto a 
      table which then collapses.

                    taxpayers down after you've crossed that 
                    line. So; Detective Sikes says; hands on 
                    heads! Up against the wall! Kiddies, we're 
                    all going for a ride!

      Purists GROAN...

      EXT. EUCLID ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CARNIVAL - NIGHT

      The rides are idle, a lone NIGHT WATCHMAN strolls the 
      playground. George pulls up in his family station wagon.

      INT. WAGON

      where Susan is in the passenger seat and Buck sits in the 
      back seat with a lap top computer. George switches off his 
      walkie-talkie, depressed.

                                  GEORGE
                    Five A.M. and Sikes is pulling in every 
                    Purist on the books, but nothing so far.

                                  SUSAN
                    Come on, Fuzzy.

      Susan takes Beedoes' cage from the back seat, CHEEP!

                                  GEORGE
                          (a sigh)
                    I still maintain, using Beedoes to find 
                    Emily is ridiculous.

                                  SUSAN
                    Then why did Emily mention him? And if 
                    Moodri said Beedoes is attuned Emily, I 
                    believe him. You're just mad cause Beedoes 
                    bit you, George. Find Emily. Beedoes! 
                    Emily ...

      Beedoes rattles his little cage.

                                  BUCK
                    Okay, Dad, I've programmed the streets into 
                    a vector grid. We drive in concentric 
                    circles that widen as we fan out, until 
                                  (MORE)                                  BUCK (CONT'D)
                    Beedoes picks up the trail.

      Buck opens his lap top, which makes BLEEPING AND BUZZING 
      noises.

                                  GEORGE
                    All right, all right. I give up.

      CHEEP!

                                  SUSAN
                    Look!

      Susan, George, Buck, all look at the cage to see Beedoes 
      jumping up and down, then changes towards the right side of 
      his cage.

                                  SUSAN
                    He keeps running to that corner.

      Buck looks at a compass, taps into his lap top.

                                  BUCK
                    Due west, Dad.

      George shakes his head, reads his dash board compass.

                                  GEORGE
                    Due west.

      Buck finishes using the computer.

                                  BUCK
                    So when you hit Carter Street hang a right.
                    George makes the right.

      Beedoes' CHEEPS rise in pitch as they've gone down the 
      trail and it's getting hotter.

      Even George seems momentarily surprised at such a definite 
      reaction from Beedoes.

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM

      Darkness.

      A big regulation clock behind chicken wire reads 6 A.M.,       Sikes has been at it all night, no luck.

      The Purist who pulled the gun on him sits tied to his 
      chair.

      A table is between them and a night stick rests on it 
      attracting the Purists' gaze, and a SECOND COP is finishing 
      a container of yogurt, exhausted.

                                  SIKES
                          (to COP)
                    Give us a minute.

      Cop looks at Sikes, then at the Purist who is painfully 
      aware of what may happen now as he watches the cop exit.

      Sikes exhales slowly, tired.

                                  SIKES
                    Here's where we are: We pegged you guys for 
                    illegal weapons, explosives, underage 
                      girlfriends, liquor, building code 
                      violations, just for starters. You are 
                    looking at serious time. Or...

                                  PURIST
                    Or?

                    Or you fill in the blanks for us.

      Purist considers this, gestures with his head for Sikes to 
      come over.

      PFFFT!

      Purist spits In Sikes' face. Sikes lunges for him throwing 
      the chair over backwards with a tremendous crash as Purist 
      SCREAMS. Other cops and Dobbs come in, tear Sikes off.

                                  PURIST
                    I want my lawyer! I got rights! Help! 
                    Police brutality!

      The cops drag the chair out with the Purist, whose nose is 
      bleeding, CRYING OUT about police brutality.

      Dobbs hands Sikes a hanky, steadies the swinging light,       concerned.

                                  DOBBS
                    Glad to see you been working on that temper 
                    you got, Matt.

                                  SIKES
                    Don't crawl me Dobbs. Read that clock. 
                    Sixteen hours to go before some shrink wrap 
                    mows my partner's kid and you get in my 
                    face about table manners?

      Dobbs pulls the brands and sunlight invades, making Sikes 
      wince.

                                  DOBBS
                    I know. I know. Look, we been counting 
                    noses and so far we got three blank spaces, 
                      unaccounted for, whereabouts unknown.

      He hands the files to Dobbs.

                                  SIKES
                    Cardozo, Bullins, and Shrake. Got pictures?
                    Shakes his head. Albert enters, broom in 
                    hand.

                                  ALBERT
                    Oh, sorry, Sarge.

                                  DOBBS
                    That's okay. Here Albert. Run out and pick 
                    up Mr. Sikes some McBreakfast. He'll need a 
                    breakfast of champions today.

      Dobbs hands Albert a twenty dollar bill.

                                  SIKES
                    Non-fat milk, plain yogurt, and granola. 
                    You can pick it up at the Happy Fruit.

      Albert, eager to please, exits.

                                  COP
                    They're bringing another bunch of Purists 
                    in, Sarge.                                  DOBBS
                    On my way.
                          (to Sikes)
                    "The Happy Fruit"? The Russian's won't have 
                    to fire a shot.

      Dobbs shakes his head, leaves. Sikes goes to the window, 
      looks out on the vast city and looks at the TICKING clock.

      EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

      as Albert comes down the steps, WHISTLES to himself, gets a 
      half block and hears:

                                    A VOICE
                            (OS)
                    Yo, Gumby.

      Albert turns, blinks and sees Rapper Jack and his shill... 
      and the cards, looks at Dobbs twenty dollar bill.

      EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

      as George, beside a Mobile station, digital clock reads 10 
      A.M., is filling his car up at the pump, talking into the 
      walkie-talkie, exhausted as from within the car comes:

      CHEEP! Lower, more emphatic.

                                  GEORGE
                    Thank you. Keep me posted if there's 
                    anything I can do.

      George places the walkie-talkie on the pump as he takes out 
      his wallet, hands the attendant some bills, gets into his 
      car.

      INT. CAR

      Susan hands George a cup of coffee, looks at Beedoes as 
      Buck is TAPPING away at his lap top, as they get caught in 
      traffic.

                                  GEORGE
                    Rush hour gridlock. Now, are we ready to 
                    throw in the towel?                                  BUCK
                    No way, Dad. By my calculations we're 
                    moving due west, heading towards the 
                    harbor. Get on the freeway.

                                  GEORGE
                    By my calculations we've given; this a shot 
                    and it's just not doing it.

                                  SUSAN
                    Humor us, George.

      George drives away. His police walkie-talkie remains atop 
      the gas pump beside the large courtesy clock which reads 10 
      A.M.

      INT. STATION HOUSE FILE ROOM

      as Sikes sits in the dusty room, illuminated by Venetian 
      blinds, TAPPING away at a computer, surrounded by stacks of 
      ID files (clock reads 11:00).

                                  SIKES
                    Cardozo, Bullins and Shrake. Search.

      The door opens and in strides Cheryl the hot rookie and she 
      nudges the bolt closed behind her, steps towards Sikes.

                                  CHERYL
                    How's it going?

                                  SIKES
                    Well so far we got their names, not their 
                    faces and it's been a long night at eleven 
                    hours and counting.

      Cheryl touches a file folder.

                                  CHERYL
                    There goes dinner, huh?

                                  SIKES
                    I'm sorry.

      Cheryl comes closer to him.                                  CHERYL
                    Well if Mohammed can't come to the mountain

      Cheryl undoes her bra, and lets it fall (as we go to 
      silhouettes and judiciously tasteful angles.)

                                  CHERYL
                            (continued)
                    We'll have to bring the mountains to 
                    Detective Sikes.

      Sikes is starting to sweat.

                                  SIKES
                    Gee, this is taking a big chance.

      Cheryl slaps a rubber into his hand.

                                  CHERYL
                    You're covered, Detective.

      Sikes is on for it now, kisses her as she sits on his lap 
      and runs her fingers through his hair.

                                  CHERYL
                    All this fuss over one little Slag. It's 
                    not like there aren't more, especially with 
                    the way they breed... Oh baby, do me... I 
                    mean look down the road in fifty years 
                    we'll be working for them. I say send them 
                    back to where they came from, pack them on 
                    the shuttle and... Hey, what's wrong? You 
                    losing gas?

      Sikes has become disenchanted, physically and emotionally, 
      he looks up at her like it's not going to work. The racist 
      line she's been spouting has ruined the moment.

      Cheryl has not a clue, SIGHS, disappointed as to why he's 
      stalled, she stands, buttons up.

                                  SIKES
                              (apologetic)
                    It's been a rough night. I'm fried and...                                  CHERYL
                          (an edge)
                    Hey, it happens to everyone, all right?

      Cheryl is pissed, she exits.

      Sikes rubs his face, rolls his eyes as if to say "what was 
      that?" Computer buzzes, Sikes goes over, turns to the 
      computer that indicates it has finished it's search as a 
      printer begins to print out:

      Three faces, Carduzo, Bullins, Shrake ...

      INT. DAY ROOM

      Sikes enters to find two hundred breakfast bags, filling 
      the room, more coming. Sikes looks at Dobbs for an 
        explanation, who looks at Albert who's putting a huge wad 
      of cash in the P.A.L. box.

                                  DOBBS
                    Albert got the hang of 3-card Monte, beat 
                    Rapper Jack at his own game, bought the 
                    whole precinct brunch including prisoners, 
                    and still popped a grand into the P.A.L. 
                    fund. I'm introducing him to the lottery 
                    next.

      Sikes places the printout photos on Dobbs' desk...

      EXT. ABANDONED IRONWORKS

      One car, old, dented, bondo marks, sits outside the rusted 
      building.

      INT. ABANDONED IRONWORKS

      Wolf, Rabbit and Frog are playing cards at a table, with a 
      loud windup TICKING CLOCK which reads 5:00 P.M. on the 
      table.

      EMILY

      sits bound in a little chair which rests on a square piece 
      of steel in the center of the room.                                  RABBIT
                    Five hours left.

                                  FROG
                    This wasn't how it was going to work.

                                  WOLF
                    There's still time.

                                  RABBIT
                    They've had plenty of time.

                                  FROG
                    He's right.

      Wolf grabs him.

                                  WOLF
                    We play out the string!

                                  RABBIT
                    I say we cut our losses.

      Emily is listening to them carefully, coloring in a 
      Newcomer coloring book.

                                  WOLF
                    Five hours to go ...

      Rabbit removes his head mask CARDOZO, a big man with rat-
      smart eyes.

                                  WOLF
                    Don't be stupid!

      Frog removes his mask to reveal his face to be that of 
      Bullins.

                                  FROG
                    You're the one who's been dumb!

      Cardozo rips the mask off Shrake, the woman paramedic. She 
      is big, tough looking, determined, in control, who cringes, 
      and they all turn towards Emily.

                                  EMILY
                    Would you like to come play?      INT. POLICE DISPATCHER'S OFFICE

      as Sikes hands the dispatcher a computer printout.

      Sikes gulps his coffee, looks at a digital clock 7 P.M.

      EXT. FREEWAY NIGHT

      as George's car comes off the ramp in the Harbor district, 
      piers, warehouses, old buildings.

      INT. CAR

      as George winces each time Beedoes CHEEPS! Louder than 
      before.

                                  GEORGE
                    What's wrong with him?

                                  BUCK
                    He's homing in, Dad.

      Buck continues working his lap top.

                                  BUCK
                    Next street is Harbor.

                    He keeps nudging west.

                                  BUCK
                    Right, Dad.

                            (resigned)
                    Right it is.

      George turns right

      Beedoes cuts loose with a SCREECH that is ear shattering, 
      making even Susan wince.      INT. ABANDONED IRONWORKS

      Emily, faced by Cardozo and Sullins, hands them two three 
      penny nails, raising questions on their crude faces.

                                  EMILY
                    Here ...

                                    CARDOZO
                    What? What for?

                                  EMILY
                    To help you.

                                    BULLINS
                    I don't get it.

                                  EMILY
                    You've removed your masks. You're in a 
                    difficult position. In order to protect 
                    your identity you must prevent me from 
                      identifying you at a later date.

                                    CARDOZO
                    Yeah. So?

                                  EMILY
                    Use these to blind me and you protect your 
                      identities ...

      Cardozo and Bullins look at one another horrified at the 
      thought; they may be killers but they're not mutilators.

                                    CARDOZO
                    This is sick...

      His nails fall.

                                  EMILY
                    I assure you the choice between blindness 
                    and death was not difficult for me. The 
                    blind lead very productive lives.

      Bullins drops his nails, backs away.

      An AMUSED LAUGH rings out.

      Cardozo and Bullins both turn to:      Shrake, still at the card table, she enjoys their 
      revulsion.

                                  SHRAKE
                    Weaklings ...

                                    CARDOZO
                    Listen, Shrake, if you're so --

      Cardozo stops himself, he gave away a name.

      Emily is now scared.

      Shrake rises, amazed at the stupidity of her accomplices.

                                  SHRAKE
                    We're past names and faces. Strong measures 
                    are what win the day.

      Shrake goes to a large tool box, which piques Cardozo and 
      Bullins' interest.

      EXT. STREET NIGHT

      George's car rounds the turn, comes to a halt across from 
      the only building in view.

      INT. CAR

      and Beedoes is braying louder than before. They must hold 
      their ears.

                    It hurts.

                    That's the building, Dad. Gotta be.

                                  GEORGE
                    I'll radio for backup.

      George looks for his walkie-talkie, remembers.

                    The gas pump... All right, you two get to a 
                    phone, give them the address and tell them

                    What are you doing?

                                  GEORGE
                    I'm going in.

                                  SUSAN
                    George, no.

      Susan tries to stop him. George will have none of it.

                                  GEORGE
                    If she's inside, there's no time to wait. 
                    Buck, drive away slowly, without noise.

      Buck nods, closes his lap top, climbs into the driver's 
      seat, takes the wheel, George gets out.

      EXT. DESERTED STREET

      as George watches the car drive away, crosses the street, 
      walks to the old, rusted door, takes out his revolver. 
      CHEEP! CHEEP!

      Beedoes pokes out of his pocket, scares George who twists 
      off the rusty padlock, enters ...


                                      END ACT III                                        ACT IV

      EXT. IRONWORKS - NIGHT

      deserted, dark, ominous, one open door, the door George 
      entered.

      INT. IRONWORKS

      as George is cautiously stalking through a series of broken 
      down cranes, machine parts, revolver ready as: CHEEP! 
      CHEEP!

      Beedoes pokes a head from George's breast pocket, and is 
      summarily shoved back inside. George senses a presence, 
      stops moving, listens: DRIPPING WATER.

      Beedoes growls.

      FOOTFALLS, several sets, echo, crisp and clean on gravel 
      and concrete, clipped staccato beat; someone is moving 
      quickly.

      George rushes to a stack of iron bars, old machinery, 
      scrambles up to get a glimpse through an old multi-paned 
      window fogged, greasy. George sees:

      A sedan pull out, dented, old, with three silhouettes 
      inside, the sound of MUFFLED LAUGHTER, as it reaches the 
      street, burns rubber.

      George hears a RUSTLE, a movement behind him, whirls, ready 
      to fire at:

      Pigeons, several of them fluttering about, resting on old 
      beams.

      George breathes easier, climbs back onto the ground, 
      advances as:

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT

      Buck comes to a screeching halt outside a deserted phone 
      booth. Susan gives him change and he charges into the phone 
      booth.                                  WINO
                    Hey!

      Buck nearly jumps ten feet.

                                  BUCK
                    Sir, I need that phone!

      The Wino takes another gulp from his bottle.

                                  WINO
                    Beat it, Slag.

      Buck ignores the Wino's tone, reaches into the booth, takes 
      the headset off the receiver and it promptly falls in two 
      pieces, broken.

      Buck runs back to the car.

      The Wino CACKLES, amused, empties his Thunderbird, hurls 
      the bottle away... it shatters.

      INT. ABANDONED IRONWORKS

      GEORGE

      Stalking through the darkness, past the rubble, smeared 
      with dirt and grease, looks at his watch:

      Watch: 9:30 1 hour left.

      CHEEP! CHEEP!

      Beedoes cuts loose louder than when we heard him before, 
      and George jumps.

                                  GEORGE
                    Right ... cheep... cheep...

      George continues on as if Beedoes had goaded him to do 
      so...

      SIKES

      standing in a prison corridor, looking into a cell at:

      MRS. BRETT, the PURIST LEADER, Purist tattoo on her arm,       defiant eyes, curled lips, snapping down cards in a fast 
      game of solitaire.

                                  MRS. BRETT

      Mrs. Brett turns at this, stops playing solitaire. Smoke 
      spins from her cigarette, she studies Sikes keenly.

                                  MRS. BRETT
                    A real "child?" Or a Slag child?

      Sikes does not answer but Mrs. Brett takes the silence as 
      an affirmative, smiles.

                                  MRS. BRETT
                    As I see it, we got ourselves a win-win 
                    situation here. Smoke a Slag they get a

                    martyrs, and both sides keep the grudge.

      Mrs. Brett smiles.

                    You ain't as stupid as you look.

      Sikes turns, leaves, walks towards an exit door, and sees 
      the clock behind the chicken wire which reads: 9:35 P.M. 25 
      minutes.

                                  MRS. BRETT

      Her laughter echoes.

      EXT. GAS STATION

      as the black OWNER is pulling down the riot guards over his 
      windows, locking the pumps, putting out a "closed" sign.

      Buck and Susan SCREECH into the station, Buck jumps out, 
      comes running over to the owner who is feeding a mangy 
      looking dog on a chain who SNARLS at Buck.

      BUCK Sir, could I use a phone, it's urgent!

                                  OWNER
                    Closed.

      stops at a large door, looks about, checks his gun as:

      Beedoes, in his breast pocket, is CHEEPING!

      George, using his Newcomer strength, tears open a new 
      padlock, pulls back a door to reveal an:

      Empty loading bay.

      George is ready to give up, is now not as cautious as he 
      was upon arriving, sags back against the wall as:

      Beedoes springs from his pocket, scurries across the floor 
      toward an old door at the far end of the loading dock.

      Beedoes now makes a HIGH-PITCHED HUMMING NOISE louder than 
      before, painful to George who moves to catch Beedoes.      INT. "NEON" - BIKER BAR - MOMENTS LATER

      It lives up to it's name, neon, smoke, juke box, leather.

      Cardozo, the biggest, block tackles Sikes into a table, 
      lifts a gumball machine to finish Sikes who delivers a 
      swift face kick, twists into Bullins, who had a knife 
      coming up fast as Shrake lunges, and she is hurled onto the 
      bar, knocked out cold.

      Motorcycle cop rushes in, looks at the carnage as Sikes 
      sinks against the bar, chances to notice Shrake's muddy 
      boats, sees:

      Clumps of reddish metal, dirt, iron tailings.

      Sikes pauses, looks at the boots of the other Purists, 
      finds the exact same deposits.

      The cavernous inner room and in the center of the room, 
      under a skylight, sitting on a little chair, gagged, is 
      Emily.

      DEAD.

      George takes a step as Beedoes SHRIEKS, baleful moaning, 
      horrified.

                    Emily!

      George's ANGUISHED CRY reverberates through the warehouse 
      as he drops his gun, realizes he has arrived too late to       save his daughter.

      Emily stirs, sits up, looks around, sees George who 
      joyously reacts, starts towards her.

                                  GEORGE
                    Baby?

      Emily, who is unable to call out, to speak, is openly 
      frightened now, shaking her head as George approaches, 
      reaches her, pulls the gag off her mouth.

                                  GEORGE
                            (puzzled)
                    What is it, Emily?

                                  EMILY
                    A bomb. We're standing on a bomb!

      George looks down, sees they are standing on a 5 x 5 sheet 
      of steel.

                                  EMILY
                      I pretended to fall asleep and heard them 
                    talking about how it would go off if 
                    someone removed me from my seat or if no 
                    one found me it would go off at ten o'clock 
                    as they told you.

                                  GEORGE
                    Ten minutes ...                                  EMILY
                    I'm sorry, Daddy. I tried to warn you.

      George kisses Emily, undoes the binding, embraces her.

                                  GEORGE
                    Whatever happens, it happens to both of us, 
                    pumpkin.

      Emily kisses George on the cheek.

      BANG! Noise from outside, Beedoes SHRIEKS, as from the 
      shadows steps:

      Sikes, gun drawn, cautious, relieved.

                                  SIKES
                    Am I interrupting anything?

                                  GEORGE
                    Don't come any farther!

                                  SIKES
                    Is that any way to greet the cavalry?

                                  EMILY
                    We're sitting on a booby trap!

      Sikes pauses, looking to George who confirms.

                                  GEORGE
                    If what Emily says is correct, under this 
                    steel plate you'll find a bomb, pressure 
                    rigged, timed to go off in ten minutes, 
                    actually it's nine minutes now...

      Sikes looks about, sees the lantern left on the card table, 
      takes it, advances towards the plate, lowers the light.

                                  SIKES
                    Hello, Mr. Claymore...

                                  GEORGE
                    The bomb squad?                                  SIKES
                    Never make it. It's us ...

                                  GEORGE
                    Don't be crazy.

                    Who's being subjective now, George?

      Sikes rushes about looking for something, sees a large 
      dolly, a wagon of sorts, used to move heavy equipment, but 
      it's old, rusted, heavy.

                                  GEORGE
                    It's going to blow in eight minutes, that's 
                    a given, if we move off the plate it goes, 
                    that's a given.

                                  EMILY
                      A Hobson's choice.

                                  SIKES
                    A what?

                                  GEORGE
                    The kind of choice where whatever
                    you do you lose.

      Sikes gets behind the wagon, rolls up his sleeves, takes a 
      deep breath.

                                  SIKES
                          (to George)

                    What are you doing?

                                  SIKES
                    What I'm doing is rolling this dolly onto 
                    the plate as a counter weight. The minute 
                    it makes contact, you dive behind that pig 
                    iron over there.

                                  GEORGE
                    This seems risky.                                  SIKES
                    Hey, I'm open for suggestions!

                    Don't be negative, Daddy.
                          (to Sikes)
                    We're ready.
                          (to George)
                    Right, Dad?

      RAPID FIRE INTERCUTS ON:

      SIKES, pausing.

      THE WAGON, not moving.

      GEORGE, watching, skeptical.

      THE WAGON, remaining immobile.

      EMILY, encouraging Sikes.

      THE BOMB, continuing to TICK.

      BEEDOES, whimpering with anguish.

      SIKES, straining, veins popping, sweating, GRUNTING, 
      stopping, looking at:

      GEORGE, SIGHING, looking at his watch: 2 minutes.

      EMILY, seeing Sikes can't do it.

                                  EMILY
                    You did your best, that's what counts.

      GEORGE, embracing Emily.

                                  GEORGE
                    You are the best daughter a dad ever had.

                                  EMILY
                    You're tops too, Dad, but you don't have to 
                    talk me through this...

      SIKES, SCREAMING a karate "kiyeh" to pump his adrenaline 
      strains and sweats.      THE WAGON, MOVING, rusty wheels move, then halt.

      GEORGE AND EMILY, resigning to defeat, turn at the sound of 
      SCREECHING METAL.

      SIKES, CRYING OUT even louder now and the wagon crawls, 15 
      feet, 14, 13, 12.

      GEORGE, starting to hope.

      EMILY, CHEERING.

      SIKES, pushing the wagon to within 5 feet, it stops.

      GEORGE, closing his eyes, terrified.

      EMILY, falling silent.

      SIKES, gasping for air, digging in with his track shoulder, 
      closing his eyes, SCREAMING.

      THE WAGON, lurching forward, onto the plate, rolling under 
      it's own momentum.

                                  SIKES
                    JUMP!

      GEORGE, Emily, diving off the plate. The wagon RUMBLES onto 
      the plate as:

      BOOM!

      The bomb, igniting in a fireball.

      EXT. IRONWORKS

      as the assembled cops, SWAT Team, Susan and Buck dive for 
      cover as the explosion sounds, windows blow out.

                                  SUSAN
                            (big)
                    Emily!

      Cops peer Lip, restrain Susan, slowly advance.

      INT. IRONWORKS

      Dust, silence, as:      GEORGE

      who landed, covering Emily with his body, looks up, no sign 
      of Sikes.

                                  GEORGE
                    Matt?

      Sikes crawls out from behind a pile of machinery, bruised, 
      filthy, exhausted, but jubilant.

                                  SIKES
                    Tell me, George, you call this being off 
                    active duty?

      The door bursts open and in comes the SWAT TEAM, backup 
      Cops, who radio the all clear sign as:

      Susan and Buck rush to George and Emily, are reunited, 
      embrace, kiss, tears, with Beedoes jumping about. Sikes 
      watches, apart for a beat, understands truly now how the 
      Newcomers may be different, but they're like us in the most 
      important way. ...the ability to love. Emily comes over to 
      Sikes.

                                  EMILY
                    Thanks for saving my family, Uncle Matt.

      Sikes, kneels, is embraced by Emily.

      EXT. SIKES' APARTMENT - DAWN

      as Sikes, dirty, catches the newspaper from the delivery 
      boy, reads the headline, "Kidnappers Foiled", smiles to 
      himself, enters his building.      INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SIKES' APARTMENT

      Cathy is on her way to work, opens the hall door for Sikes, 
      who is putting his key in the lock.

                    You're hurt.

      Sikes touches his cheek, somewhat surprised that there is a 
      wound.

                                  SIKES
                    It's just a scratch.

      INT. CATHY'S APARTMENT

      where Cathy takes off her coat, has Sikes sit on the chair 
      near the kitchen, fetches bandages, a wash cloth, and 
      Neosporin. She cleans the wound, touches his cheek.

      Sikes does not flinch, he's come a long way in the past 24 
      hours.

      Their eyes meet; we:
