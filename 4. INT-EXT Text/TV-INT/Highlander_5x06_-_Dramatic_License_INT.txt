      A chain book-store, and there's a "reading" going on. 90% of
      the customers are women -- the few guys are the type that
      cruise these events.

      AMANDA

      is in the group.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    So what happened?  Does he save her?

      CAROLYN MARSH

      stands at a microphone, eyes Amanda with barely contained
      annoyance.  30, hip expensive clothes, she's definitely not
      saccharine -- a big ego and plenty of attitude.

                                      CAROLYN
                    For that, you'll have to buy the
                    book.

      She shuts her copy book, turns coolly from Amanda -- takes a
      book from the crowding CUSTOMERS and begins to sign.

                                      AMANDA
                          (overly sweet)
                    Oh, I'll buy two.

      REFRAME AMANDA

      to include an oversized COVER-FLAT next to her: the lurid
      artwork of a mainstream historical romance novel.  An artist's
      rendering of a swashbuckling version of "Duncan MacLeod"
      stands heroically, sword aloft, exaggerated chest, a buxom
        Roxanne-type wrapped around his legs. (The "Duncan MacLeod"
      in the artwork should resemble only superficially our Duncan
      MacLeod -- the same coloring, but a different face.)  The
      signage reads "Author CAROLYN MARSH reads from her novel,
      'BLADE OF THE MACLEODS.'"

                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      MacLeod is working on a water pipe with a wrench and other
      tools.  He gets the BUZZ and pivots to see:

      AMANDA

      entering, clutching enough designer bags to qualify for the
      Imelda Marcos medal.

                                      AMANDA
                    Well, that's it.  Would you believe
                    I maxed out every card I have?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (dry)
                      Everything but your library card.

      He continues working.

                                      AMANDA
                    Speaking of books...

      She pulls out her book, flips to a section.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                          (reading)
                    "As he strode into the room, she
                    felt her knees weaken.  The dark
                    eyes that roved over her were the
                    color of midnight.  His muscles as
                    hard as the Highland hills that formed
                    them...."

                                      MACLEOD
                          (rolls his eyes)
                    Give me a break.

                                      AMANDA
                    I'm not finished!  "A mane of flowing
                    hair to rival Lancelot's charger..."

                                      MACLEOD
                    Fabio?

      He continues to work, but it looks like he's sucking in his
      gut.

                                      AMANDA
                    "This was the man her father had
                    hired to protect her.  This barbarian,
                    this smoky-eyed Scot..."
                          (punching it)
                    "This Duncan MacLeod."

      The sound of his name causes him to tug the wrench harder
      than he wanted.  The pipe comes loose, soaking him with water.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Gotcha.

      MacLeod grabs the book away.  And OFF his face --

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      MacLeod and Amanda are leaving the elevator.  MacLeod fumes
      as he thumbs through the book as Amanda looks on, sucking on
      a popsicle.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't believe it.

                                      AMANDA
                    Neither do I, frankly.
                          (beat)
                    I mean, she got the eyes just about
                    right.... but "Muscles as hard as
                    Highland hills..."?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I meant that someone's actually
                    writing this!

                                      AMANDA
                    Figured you'd written it yourself...
                    Except I met the writer.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (re: book)
                    Marsh... Marsh... Who the hell is
                    Carolyn Marsh?

                                      AMANDA
                    I thought you might know.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You think I'd tell a mortal about
                    our lives?

                                      AMANDA
                    You have before.

                                      MACLEOD
                    But not some romance novelist.

                                      AMANDA
                    Someone did.  You're a best-seller,
                    MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's not funny.
                          (beat, reading)
                      "Roxanne's breath came in labored
                    gasps as he crushed his lips to hers,
                    her hands reached for his kilt, where
                    they found..."
                          (stops, disgusted)
                    I don't believe it.

      Amanda looks interested, grabs the book away.

                                      AMANDA
                    I missed that...
                          (reads, interested)
                    Ooh.  So it's a little purple.
                          (off his look)
                    The prose, I mean.

                                      MACLEOD
                    A little!  That's not even close to
                    the way it happened...

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      A beautiful study in a well-appointed, luxurious home, Terence
      flings "Blade of the MacLeods" across the room in a fury.

                                      TERENCE
                    Gerald!

      GERALD

      the personal assistant appears at the door, stone faced.

                                      GERALD (CONT'D)
                    Sir?

                                      TERENCE
                          (under his breath)
                    I'll kill her.  I'll absolutely kill
                    her.

      TERENCE

      picks up the book, flips to the title page, rips out the
      imprint.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                          (to Gerald)
                    Buchanan Books.  Find out who's the
                    editor of this miserable piece of
                    drek!  Then find me the author.

      He thrusts the torn sheet at Gerald.

                                      GERALD
                      Immediately, sir.

      He goes.  Terence looks at the back page of the flyleaf with
      Carolyn's heavily air-brushed PUBLICITY PHOTO.

                                      TERENCE
                    I told you I'd never let you get
                    away with a stunt like this.
                          (dark)
                    Now you're going to pay.

      He holds up Carolyn's PICTURE and slowly, with feeling--
      tears it in half.  And OFF his dark look --


      THREE YOUNG MUSCULAR JOCKS glisten with sweat.  One skips
      rope, another, a lithe black guy, buzzes the speed bag, a
      third pounds a heavy bag with bone-crushing hooks.  Enough
      rippling muscle to propel a roller coaster.

      CAROLYN

      enters the dojo and surveys the pumping flesh.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    Oh, my.

      She moves closer, looking like a fox in a chicken coop, as
      she samples the material: grabs the biceps of one, the buttock
      of another.  She's a man-eater.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                          (to Jock#l)
                    MacLeod?  Duncan MacLeod?

      The fondled BOXER jumps and backs off, shaking his head. 
      Carolyn shrugs and moves on, pausing by the rippling black
      guy.  He sees her staring, looks back.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    Don't suppose you're Scottish.
                          (off his stare,
                            regretful)
                    Oh well, forget it.

      She sights on the next guy, moves toward him.


      MacLeod is on the phone, agitated.  Amanda lounges in his
      chair, idly playing with the slinky as:

                                      MACLEOD
                          (into phone)
                    The editor of the Carolyn Marsh books,
                    please.
                          (a beat)
                    Regarding "Blade of the MacLeods. 
                          (then)
                    No, I do not want to be put through
                    to her fan club!

      Too late.  MacLeod puts down the phone, hard.

                                      AMANDA
                    I didn't expect you to take this so
                      seriously.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's my name... my life!  You want
                    me to just ignore it?

      Amanda is suddenly staring out into the dojo.

                                      AMANDA
                    Well, well.  Look what the cat dragged
                    in.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (following her look)
                    What's she doing?

                                      AMANDA
                    By the look of it?  I'd say she's
                    shopping for tenderloin.

      MacLeod heads into the dojo.  Amanda follows.


      MacLeod crosses over to Carolyn.  Amanda hangs back slightly,
      grinning -- this oughta be good.

      CAROLYN'S POV - MACLEOD

      irritated, but looking the total leading man.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Excuse me, but is there something I
                    can do for you?

      She goggles, touches his arms, losing her composure for a
      BEAT.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Oh yes...

                    There's a funny smell in here.

      Amanda's had enough.  She steps in.

                    Probably lust.

      MacLeod gives her a look -- "thanks for mentioning it."

                    You don't say.

                    Sorry. With so many fans, just another
                    face in the crowd... you understand.

                                      AMANDA
                          (through her teeth)
                      Perfectly.

                    Duncan... I can call you Duncan,
                    can't I -- we have to talk.

                          (pointed)
                    I agree.

                          (a glance at Amanda)
                    Good. It'll be so much easier to
                    explain over a drink.

      She takes MacLeod's arm.  Amanda takes his other arm.

                                      AMANDA
                    Come on.  We can all talk about it.

                                      CAROLYN
                          (cool)
                    I really don't think that's necessary.

                                      AMANDA
                    I do.

                          (ice)
                    This is business.

                          (harder)
                    In that case, I insist.

                          (trapped)
                    Anything.  But let's do it before I
                    lose an arm.

      They head toward the door, Carolyn shooting daggers at Amanda,
      MacLeod in the middle.


      Amanda, MacLeod and Carolyn are sitting at a table nursing
      drinks.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (fishing)
                    So, Carolyn, your book's pretty... 
                      imaginative.

                                      CAROLYN
                    And you're wondering where I get my
                    ideas?
                          (off his look)
                    A lot of people ask that.

                                      AMANDA
                    Really.

                                      CAROLYN
                    It's simple.  Duncan MacLeod is real.

      MacLeod chokes on his drink.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    For four hundred years, that name's
                    been popping up in legends all over
                    the world.  Scotland, Italy, Turkey...

                                      AMANDA
                    Turkey?  Imagine that.

      MacLeod kicks her under the table.

                                      CAROLYN
                    It's always the same story.  A warrior
                    from the Highlands, fighting battles,
                      protecting the weak... always Duncan
                    MacLeod.  What do you think of that?

                                      MACLEOD
                      Fascinating.

                                      CAROLYN
                    At first it drove me crazy.  Then I
                    finally figured it out.
                          (pause for effect)
                    I know the truth.

      MacLeod and Amanda trade looks.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (strangled)
                    Which is?

                                      CAROLYN
                    What does man need most?
                          (off Amanda's look)
                    Besides that.
                          (beat)
                    Heroes... and when there aren't any,
                    we create them.
                          (beat)
                    "Duncan MacLeod" exists because we
                    want him to exist!  We need him to
                    exist.

      She slaps the table in triumph.

                                      AMANDA
                    Then, you don't really think it's
                    the same man?

                    Are you nuts?  He'd have to be
                    immortal.

      She laughs.  Amanda laughs.  She slaps MacLeod's back hard --
      MacLeod finally laughs.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Hilarious.

                    in a different time period.
                          (off his look)

                    This is where I get out.

      He rises.  Carolyn rises, stopping him.

                                      CAROLYN
                    But this is a gold mine!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not interested.

      MacLeod rises, taking Amanda's arm.  Amanda shrugs a "you
      lose" look at Carolyn.  Carolyn goes after them.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Look, I saw your dojo, or whatever
                    you call it -- I've seen dumpsters
                    with better facilities!

                                      AMANDA
                    True... but it's him.

                                      CAROLYN
                    I know you could use the cash, so
                    what's the deal here?

                    Maybe I should do a little research
                    on this Duncan MacLeod.

                                      AMANDA
                    Maybe you'll find out he was born in
                    the Highlands of Scotland four hundred
                    years ago.

      MacLeod stops her with a look.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Maybe he has something to hide.

                    throwing.  Just give it a try.  If
                    you don't like it, I'm gone.  Deal?
                          (beat)
                    Or do I set the research drones to
                    work?

      MacLeod is trapped.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    One time.  One party.  No publicity
                    photos, no press.  End of story. 
                    That's the deal.

                    But try to come alone.

      She throws Amanda a catty smile, turns and mows her way out. 
      Amanda looks after her.

                                      AMANDA
                    Not in your lifetime.

      MacLeod is forcing a pained smile to a group of admiring
      young women, several holding copies of Carolyn's book. He
      gives a bow to his "fans" and moves away to Amanda, wearing
      an elegant black number, watching in amusement.  In the
      background, two men are at the door checking invitations and
      letting people in.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I hate this.

                    You agreed... and I don't remember
                    any torture chamber.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's ridiculous.

      A couple of stunning YOUNG WOMEN go by, beaming at him. 
      MacLeod beams back, preening perceptibly.

                                      AMANDA
                    Maybe it's the real Duncan MacLeod.


      MacLeod joins Carolyn inside.

                                      CAROLYN
                    There you are.  You can't just take
                    off like that.  Remember our deal. 
                    You're supposed to be on display!

                                      MACLEOD
                          (through gritted teeth)
                    I don't like being on display.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Now don't pout... it's not very
                      attractive.
                          (with a smile)
                    Your public's waiting.

      MacLeod is about to answer -- he spots Terence and Amanda
      entering.

      MacLeod takes Carolyn's arm and quickly leads her into the
      crowd.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Look, you've made your rounds... 
                    why don't we get out of here?

      She looks at him, surprised but flattered.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Why, Duncan...   That would be a
                    premature evacuation, n est-ce pas?
                    Why the rush?

      MACLEOD S POV - TERENCE

      heading their way.  Murder in his eyes.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'll tell you later.

      CAROLYN

      follows his look -- sees Terence for the first time.  She
      winces, covers it, smiles at MacLeod.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    Where should we go?  The Highlands? 
                    Bali?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Anywhere you like.

                                      CAROLYN
                          (a nano-beat)
                    Okay.  Your place.

      MACLEOD

      is cornered.  Terence is bearing down, making his way through
      the crowd like a gentleman -- intent on murder.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Now.

      He grabs her arm.  He pulls her toward the door and the two
      men checking invitations.  He points to Terence.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    See that guy?
                          (beat)
                    He just tried to lift my wallet.

      As the two men move to interrupt Terence, MacLeod slips out
      the door.


      Mid-scene.  MacLeod is uncorking wine, rolling his eyes as
      Carolyn browses the place, poking around, rattling on.

                    It's simple, really.  Duncan MacLeod
                    is every woman's sexual fantasy.  A
                    warrior with the heart of a poet.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat, sarcastic)
                    I'd love to meet him.

                                      CAROLYN
                    But he's more than that.  He's a man
                    of principle... ethics.  The tragic
                    romantic hero.
                          (beat)
                    If he didn't exist, we'd have to
                    invent him.

      MacLeod hands her a glass.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So what else did you learn about
                    this... fantasy?

                                      CAROLYN
                    You really want to know?

      1605-1622 (from "Prophecy," "Homeland," "Family Tree") unspool
      under as Carolyn speaks:

                                      CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    The first time Duncan MacLeod turns
                    up, he's a chieftain's son, raised
                    to lead a Highland Clan.  He fell in
                    love with the daughter of a
                      neighboring chief, but she was pledged
                    in marriage to his kinsman.  You
                    know, a Romeo and Juliet kind of
                    thing?  Anyhow, there was a fight...
                    and he killed his cousin.  Now here's
                    the tragic part... the woman he loved
                    died anyway.  He left his clan shortly
                    after that... the stories are pretty
                    unclear about exactly why... but
                    they say he's wandered the world
                    ever since.

      MACLEOD

      is lost in thought, moved by the memories.

                                      CAROLYN
                    You know they still tell that story
                    in a little village in Scotland...
                      Glenfinnan.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (far away)
                    On the shores of Loch Shiel.

                                      CAROLYN
                    How did you know?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat, covering)
                    It's in your book.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Of course.
                          (moving in)
                    And I thought you weren't a fan.

      She moves up behind him, running her fingers over his back,
      his shoulders.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    Imagine the loss ...
                          (with feeling)
                    Wandering the earth alone, longing
                    for warmth, for companionship... for
                    love.  With no one who can truly
                      understand his soul, share his pain.

      MacLeod is distracted -- it's his LIFE she's describing. 
      She's moving as she speaks: touching him, playing him.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    I'd do anything for that man.  I'd
                    be his willing slave.

      Suddenly she plants a wet one on him, pulling at his shirt --
      trying to jump him.  MacLeod tries to pull free, but Carolyn
      hangs on like a tick.  They fall backwards over a table --

      NEW ANGLE

      and land on the floor, Carolyn STRADDLING MacLeod, jockey-
      like, kissing him passionately.

                                      CAROLYN
                    I want it, you want it... stop
                    fighting it!

                                      MACLEOD
                          (muffled)
                    Mgumph!

      She crushes his mouth with hers again.  MacLeod's EYES grow
      wide as he feels a BUZZ.  Finally he wrenches his lips free,
      looks up to see --

      AMANDA

      staring down at them, eyes like icy stalactites a mile
        underground.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Well, yipee-kayai.  The rodeo's in
                    town.

      They scramble to their feet, Carolyn smoothing her dress
      down, pissed.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Didn't you ever learn how to knock?

                                      AMANDA
                    You'd be surprised what I learned.
                          (ominous)
                    Maybe you want to find out?

      She steps forward, murder in her eyes.  MacLeod quickly steps
      between them.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda, it's not what you think!

                                      AMANDA
                    What I'm thinking, you don't want to
                    know.
                          (beat)
                    There's a cabby waiting downstairs. 
                    Thirty bucks, to bring me back from
                    your little soiree.

      MacLeod opens his wallet, starts to proffer a fifty then
      sees her face and thinks better of it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'll be right back.  Just don't...

      He looks at them, sees enough electrical tension in the room
      to start a lightning storm.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Just don't.

      He heads towards the elevator.  The women cross their arms
      and stare at each other.


      MacLeod quickly pays off the CABBY standing at the door.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Keep the change.

      The Cabby smiles and leaves.  MacLeod turns to go back to
      the loft -- he gets the BUZZ.  He freezes.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Please.  Not now.

      He turns, expecting the worst, and finds it as --

      TERENCE

      lurches in, obviously in his cups, and pissed off.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    She's here, isn't she?

                    Think I'm a fool?  Carolyn Marsh,
                    who else!

      He lurches around MacLeod, voice dripping sarcasm as he quotes
      from memory:

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    "Sable mane..." "Muscles hard as
                    hills..." "Eyes like..."
                          (faltering)
                    Potatoes, or whatever the hell she
                    said.  You're sleeping with her!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Why would I do that?

                    To make yourself look good, and make
                    me look like a fool!

                    I swear, I never went near her.

                    "... as Duncan's lips crushed her to
                    him, her hands went to his

      He throws a haymaker -- catches MacLeod on the chin.  He
      winces, holding his temper.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    Don't get between us again.

      He lurches out the door.  MacLeod turns to go back, rubbing
      his jaw.


      MacLeod enters from the stairs.  He looks around the loft.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Where is she?

      MacLeod reacts.

                    On her broom.

      MacLeod takes off down the stairs.


      Carolyn heads from the elevator to the front door where
      Terence just left.  MacLeod enters from the stairs.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Carolyn, wait!

      She turns.  MacLeod moves toward her.

                    Maybe you shouldn't go home tonight.

      Carolyn smiles, misunderstanding.  She pats his cheek.

                    Men.  First thing you do is get to
                    that all night florist on Water
                    Street.  Two dozen white roses might
                    do the trick.

      She kisses him on the cheek, starts to head toward the door. 
      MacLeod gets in her way.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Carolyn, I'm serious.  You're not
                    safe.

      We hear a drunken bellow from outside.

                                      TERENCE (O.S.)
                    Carolyn!

      MacLeod grabs Carolyn's arm.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Back door.  Quick.

      She's too startled to object as he hustles her to the side
      door, pushes her through.  Slams it shut behind her.

                                      TERENCE (O.S.)
                    Carolyn, where are you?

      MacLeod turns, looking "innocent" as Terence comes in the
      front door.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    I heard her voice.  Don't deny it. 
                    Where is she?

                                      MACLEOD
                    She's not here.
                          (beat)
                    Go home, Terence.

      Terence raises himself shakily up to full height.

                                      TERENCE
                    I shall not forget this.
                          (beat)
                    You, sir, are a skunk.  A SKUNK!

      He stalks out.  And OFF MacLeod, looking after him --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      CAMERA PANS DOWN from two dozen WHITE ROSES standing in a
      vase on a table.  Amanda lies in bed in a soft pool of light,
      reading "Blade of the MacLeods" with rapt attention as she
      munches nuts from a bowl.

                                      AMANDA (V.O.)
                          (reading aloud)
                    "... her naked flesh trembled under
                    his touch.  Slowly, slowly she lay
                    back on the satin pillows, letting
                    them caress her ivory skin..."

                                                                RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO:


      There's enough Vaseline on the camera lens to start a
      chopstick factory.  CAMERA PANS OVER the identical ripped
      dress worn in the TEASER; it lies draped over a chair.  The
      same satin shoes are on the floor beside the bed.

      ANGLE - THE BED

      where a naked BLONDE lies, her hair fanned out on the sheets,
      face hidden by a dark-maned MacLeod as he kisses her
      sensually, as OVER we HEAR:

                                      AMANDA (V.O.)
                    "... her silken blonde tresses
                    cascaded over both their bodies as
                    he caressed her.  She had been kissed
                    by men before, but never like this
                    ..."

      The woman's face turns so we can see it: back arched, eyes
      half-shut in breathless excitement -- it's Amanda!  She stops,
      takes MacLeod's head in her hands, searches his eyes
      anxiously:

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                            (breathless)
                    Tell me... I have to know... Am I
                    just another conquest for you?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    On my honor... no woman I have ever
                    been with could match you... And if
                    I live a thousand years, none could.

                                      AMANDA
                    Then take me... now!

      He does.  The two roll under the covers, FLASHES of bare
      flesh, blonde Amanda CRYING out in sheer ecstasy.

                                      AMANDA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                          (reading)
                    "... under his caresses, her skin
                    burned with a white hot passion she
                    had never known in her life."
                          (reading, with growing
                            excitement)
                    "They moved together, bodies joining
                    in exquisite union again and again,
                    until she could no longer bear it. 
                    Finally he cried out, the sound she
                    was longing to hear..."

      And OVER, drowning out everything -- a huge, male SNORE.

                                                                                SMASH TO:


      Amanda lies in bed, reading, eyes glued to the book.  Again
      the SNORE, and she looks over at --

      MACLEOD

      splayed in bed beside her, hair a mess, rumpled and snoring. 
      Definitely not the sex machine in the novel.

      Amanda gives him a speculative look.

                                      AMANDA
                    Duncan?

      More SNORING.  No action there.  Amanda reaches over and
      pinches his nose shut.  MacLeod SNARFS, rolls over.  Amanda
      sighs, gives him a fond pat and goes back to her book.


      Carolyn and Tim are preparing for a book signing, fussing
      over the positioning of the poster and the stack of books. 
      Tim suddenly lights up like a bulb.

                                    TIM
                    He's here.

      MACLEOD

      entering the store.  He's not smiling, but several female
      CUSTOMERS ogle him as he approaches the display.

      RESUME CAROLYN

                                      CAROLYN
                          (re: the customers)
                    Look, they're already drooling.

                                    TIM
                          (sighs)
                    Isn't he beautiful.
                          (as MacLeod approaches)
                    Mister MacLeod, Duncan... I'm so
                    glad you could make it!

                                      MACLEOD
                          (politely)
                    Thank you.
                          (to Carolyn)
                    Could I see you in private?

                                      CAROLYN
                    Now isn't the time, Duncan.  We have
                    work to do...

      She motions to the Tim to bring over a garment bag.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    And you've got to get into character.

      And OFF this, Tim holds up a Scottish costume.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    We had it sent in from Western Costume
                    in Hollywood.  It's the real Clan
                    MacLeod tartan.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (losing patience)
                    I'm not here to play "Duncan MacLeod"
                    for you.

                                      CAROLYN
                    I see.
                          (cooling)
                    Then put it in two words or less.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (enunciating)
                      Terence... Coventry.

      The shoe drops.  Carolyn turns to Tim.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Tim?  Give us five?

      Tim moves off, holding the costume.

                          (avoiding)
                    Why bring up Terence Coventry?  He's
                    the villain from my book.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And from the party yesterday.
                          (off her look)
                    Drop the act, Carolyn.  What's between
                    you and Coventry?

      She gives up, throws her pencil aside.

                                      CAROLYN
                    All right.  Terence and I...

                    We were once an item.

                    You used his name for your villain?

                          (with feeling)
                    He deserves it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And you expect him to ignore it and
                    walk away?

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's a switch.

      TWO CUSTOMERS gawk at his exit.


      MacLeod and Amanda are finishing lunch.  MacLeod signals for
      the bill.

                                      AMANDA
                    I told you she was trouble.  Why go
                    in the first place?

                                      MACLEOD
                    To try and get her to stop.  She
                    can't keep doing this to Terence.

                    She wanted to dress me in a kilt.

                                      AMANDA
                    Really?  I kind of like you in a
                    kilt.
                          (off his look)
                    Nice legs.

      MacLeod gives her a look.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Very flattering, but no thank you.

                                      AMANDA
                    So you're done with all of this?

                    I know.  Putting knives in my back.

                    I have a right to make a living.

      He grabs the book and waves it.

                    Not like this!  You can't do this to
                    me!

      He turns, raging, to the few CUSTOMERS gathered there.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    Do you see a mole?  Am I that ugly?!

      The Customers fall back.  Carolyn grabs the book, grabs her
      pen, and inscribes Terence's book.

                                      CAROLYN
                    You want me to write something? 
                    How's this?
                          (writing)
                    Dear Terence... screw you.

      She throws the book at him.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    If I were you, I'd take a hike... 
                    before Duncan MacLeod shows up!

      That does it.  Terence throws her over his shoulder and
      carries her, kicking and screaming, towards the exit.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    Let go of me this instant!  I'm gonna
                    scream!

                                      TERENCE
                          (not stopping)
                    Go ahead.

      She does -- a high, ear-splitting SHRIEK.

      THE CUSTOMERS, thinking this is part of the hype, burst out
      in delighted APPLAUSE.

                    If you think Terence is that mad,
                    why leave at all?

                    Right.  She pissed you off, so you
                    left her to the wolves.
                          (off his protesting
                            look)
                      I understand.  I'd do the same thing
                    in your shoes.

                    To tell you the truth, it wouldn't
                    bother me if he does kill her.

      MacLeod eyes her for a moment.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    What?

      He sighs, stands, and moves to the door.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                      MacLeod...!

      He's gone.  Amanda looks down --

      lies on the table.  Amanda picks it up.

      MacLeod is with Tim, who's packing up the display and book
      signing paraphernalia.

      FADE IN:


      Amanda steps from a cubicle to stand before a three way mirror
      in the outfit she's trying on.  It's a knockout -- black,
      slinky, showing every feature to best advantage.  As she
      looks herself over, reflected in the mirror beside her,
      ANOTHER FIGURE steps out --

      CAROLYN

      wearing an identical outfit.  Carolyn freezes, eves Amanda's
      body -- she doesn't like the competition.  She smooths her
      hips, preens a little.

                    I think Duncan would like this, don't
                    you?

                                      AMANDA
                    He'd love it.
                          (beat)
                    On me.

                                      CAROLYN
                          (frost)
                    You might want to try last year's
                    model.  I hear it's a little roomier.

                                      AMANDA
                    Why spend all that money getting
                    into a dress?
                          (beat)
                    It'll come right off when the first
                    man gets within fifteen feet.

      An ASSISTANT approaches, seeing a double sale.

                                      ASSISTANT
                          (brightly)
                    You both look absolutely faaaab-ulous! 
                    Are you sisters?

      They turn, look daggers at him.  The Assistant backs quickly
      off.  Amanda sidles up to Carolyn, hands on hips --
      intimidating.

                                      AMANDA
                    Forget Duncan.  You're way out of
                    your league.
                          (beat)
                    He and I go back a long ways.

      Carolyn holds her ground.

                          (snide)

                                      AMANDA
                    Listen, you garden variety slug, I
                    read your little book.  You think
                    you're going to turn a guy like
                    MacLeod into your fantasy lover,
                    with you as the lady in distress?

                    How... you...

      Carolyn's eyes begin to well up with tears.  She storms back
      into her dressing room, slams the door.

      Amanda turns back to the mirror -- mission accomplished --
      then from Carolyn's cubicle, we hear SOBBING.

                                      AMANDA
                    What did I say?

      Amanda shrugs, about to walk away -- but the sobs keep on. 
      Carolyn is really torn up.  Amanda waffles, but feels a twinge
      of compassion -- finally she knocks.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Hey in there.  You all right?

                                      CAROLYN
                    Leave me alone, I'm fine!

      Still crying.  Amanda pushes open the door, finds Carolyn
      sitting there, miserable, tear-streaked.

                                      AMANDA
                          (quietly)
                    No, you're not.

                                      CAROLYN

                          (beat)
                    I know someone who's a complete wreck
                    when I see them.

      Carolyn looks at her -- and howls even louder.  Amanda rolls
      her eyes -- she doesn t feel like mothering this woman, but
      she forces herself to pat Carolyn s back.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                          (without conviction)
                    There, there. It s gonna be okay.

      She uses part of her outfit to wipe Carolyn's tears.

      The assistant enters and reacts as he sees Amanda wiping
      Carolyn's tears.

                                      ASSISTANT
                    That's a five-thousand dollar dress!

                    Is that all?

      As Amanda and Carolyn react.


      MacLeod enters the house warily, his senses in overdrive. 
      He gets the BUZZ, follows it to --


      Where Terence, his APRON on, is cooking over the stove with
      a large SPOON.  He turns as he feels the BUZZ -- MacLeod.

                                      TERENCE
                          (icy)
                    What are you doing here?

                    Where's Carolyn?

      Terence tightens, advances on MacLeod, spoon in hand.

                                      TERENCE
                    On her way.  And we'd like to be
                    alone, if you don't mind.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You think I'm just going to leave
                    her here?

                                      TERENCE
                          (laughing)
                    Always the hero.  Sounds like you're
                    starting to believe your own
                      publicity.
                          (beat)
                    What are you planning to do?  Be the
                    lady's champion on a white charger?

                                      TERENCE
                    En garde!

      MacLeod looks almost embarrassed, clears his throat.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    What?!

      Then he sees he's holding the SPOON, wearing his apron.  He
      rips it off, tosses them aside, and pulls his sword.

      THE DUEL commences -- the dinner is being demolished, stuffed
      tomatoes lose their stuff, a whole duck is a half duck.

      TERENCE

      is actually a pretty polished swordsman.  The battle moves
      out of the kitchen and into:


      There's a table set for two: candles, champagne, flowers. 
      They fight past it, then -- the BUZZ.

      AMANDA AND CAROLYN

      make their entrance.  MacLeod and Terence react to their
      arrival.  MacLeod tries to hastily conceal his sword.

                                      MACLEOD

                    Yes?

                                      TERENCE
                    You won't have her!

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't want her!

                                      TERENCE
                    Then what are you here for?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm just trying to keep you away
                    from her.

      TERENCE

      rushes him, sword swinging.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    What sort of hero are you, coming
                    between a man and his wife?

      MACLEOD

      is struggling to A) keep up with the twists, and B) keep
      away from Terence's sword.

                    Wife?  She's your WIFE?

                                      TERENCE
                    Like you didn't know.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I didn't.

                                      AMANDA
                    He didn't.

                                      TERENCE
                          (to Carolyn)
                    You didn't?

                                      CAROLYN
                    We didn't.

      MACLEOD

      deftly rebuffs Terence's thrust.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                      I wouldn't.

      MacLeod steps back, raises his sword in a "time out" position.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Terence, there's nothing between
                    Carolyn and me!

      Terence hesitates -- sees MacLeod is in earnest.

                                      CAROLYN
                    It's true.

                                      TERENCE
                    Then why did you leave me?

                                      AMANDA
                    Because she loves you, you idiot.

                          (to Carolyn)
                    Is she serious?
                          (off Carolyn's nod)
                    I give up.

                    Is it so hard to understand?
                          (to Terence)
                    What did you think would happen,
                    Terence?  All those stories -- Terence
                    Coventry, world's greatest hero,
                    world's greatest lover.  You swept
                    the poor girl off her feet.

                                      TERENCE
                    Of course I did.
                          (to Carolyn, as it
                            sinks in)
                    I did?

      She nods.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    So what did I do wrong?

                                      AMANDA
                    You were too good to be true.
                          (beat)
                    What woman wants to find out she's

                          (to Carolyn)
                    You can.

      He moves toward her, locks eyes with her.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    All those stories... I told them to
                    you because I trust you.  I wanted
                    you to know me.
                          (beat)
                    Those places, those people, they were
                    my life.

      He takes her hands.  It's a magic moment, candlelight
      glinting.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    But you, Carolyn.  You are my life.

      He leans down to kiss her gently.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Oh, Terence.

      She grabs him around the neck and pulls him into serious lip-
      lock.

      AMANDA AND MACLEOD

      Amanda is almost tearing up.  MacLeod nudges her.

                                      MACLEOD
                    C mon.  Before anyone changes their
                    mind.

      They start out --

                                      AMANDA
                    Why can't you be more like that?

      And OFF this --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


      CAMERA PANS over the remains of a romantic dinner.  Candles
      burnt low.  Lobster and oyster shells, champagne butt-up in
      an ice bucket.

                                      AMANDA (O.S.)
                          (reading aloud)
                    "... his hands caressed the nape of
                    her neck.  Hands that had killed,
                    hands that could wield the mightiest
                    sword..."

      AMANDA

      reclines on the couch, reading "Blade of the MacLeods" with
      intense concentration.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                          (reading)
                    "... yet now they were at her service. 
                    Gentle, strong, sensitive ... 

      As she reads -- HANDS slide into frame, stroking her neck
      and shoulders, following the passage she's reading.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                          (reading)
                    "... tracing the delicate line of
                    her hair, down her throat, gently
                    slipping her gown from one creamy
                      shoulder."

      As she says it, he does it.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                          (reading)
                    "Her breath quickened as his mouth
                      approached the newly-bared flesh."

      MacLeod stops, looks at her.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Put the book down.

                                      AMANDA
                    It's just getting good.

                                      MACLEOD
                    We can do better.

      She lets go - the book drops.  CAMERA FOLLOWS it to the floor,
      PUSHES IN on the cover art.  A BEAT later --

                                      AMANDA (O.S.)
                    Mmmmm. You're right.
