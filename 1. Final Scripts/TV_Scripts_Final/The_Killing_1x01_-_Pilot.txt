                                        "THE KILLING"

      FADE IN:

      EXT.  PARK - WOODS - DAY

      Near dawn, sky threatening rain.  CAMERA TRACKS behind a
      lone WOMAN running through a maze of stark trees.  Breathing
      hard, pushing herself to the limit, sweatshirt soaked through. 
      At first you wonder if she's a young girl with her ponytail,
      small frame, and then you see her eyes -- wounded, haunted -
      and realize she isn't.  Meet Homicide Detective SARAH LINDEN -
      37, lone wolf type, solo distance runner, pretty without
      trying, her smiles rare, her intense eyes strange, unblinking.

      CAMERA TRACKS past, lifting towards the sky.  SMASH CUT TO --

      EXT. PARK - WOODS - NIGHT

      Tree limbs, like long fingers, reach down towards a young
      girl -- 17, sweet-faced, child-woman's body -- running hard,
      clothing torn, dirty blonde hair soaked with sweat.  With
      blood.  This is ROSIE LARSEN and she is running for her life.

      Crashing through the brush behind her, an UNSEEN ASSAILANT
      closes in, FLASHLIGHT illuminating Rosie's terrified,
      bloodshot eyes, the bruises and cuts on her arms, legs, face. 
      In the distance, the SOUND of an approaching train.  Ahead,
      what looks like a break in the woods.  With a strangled cry,
      Rosie plunges towards it--

      EXT. PARK - WOODS - INTERCUT

      Dawn.  Sarah bursts into a clearing, stopping on a railroad
      track, SOUND of an approaching train in the distance.  She
      leans over, gulping cold air, sweat pouring down her face.

      Beyond, down a small embankment, is an abandoned beach strewn
      with driftwood, fog.  In the distance, the snow-capped
      Olympics loom over the frigid waters of the Puget Sound.

      Sarah looks up, goes still.  A FIGURE lies on the beach.  A
      blanket of loopy seaweed covering it.  Gnats and flies buzzing
      over it.  SMASH CUT TO --

      EXT. PARK - WOODS - INTERCUT

      Rosie bursts into the nighttime clearing, tripping, scrambling
      on hands and knees down a small embankment.  The flashlight
      behind her jaggedly cuts through the woods, nearing.  In the
      far distance, the train's horn sounds, eerie, sonorous.

      Rosie crouches in a small pool of brackish water, pressing
      herself into the embankment, making herself as small as
      possible.  Flashlight flits over her head, then moves off.                                                                                          2.

        A breathless beat.  Rosie shakily rises.  The Assailant is
      gone.  The train horn, still distant but closer now, sounds.

      Rosie's face is suddenly flooded with light.  The Assailant
      has doubled back and is now only a dozen yards away.  Moving
      in with terrifying speed.  With a scream, Rosie runs--

      EXT. PARK - WOODS - INTERCUT

      Sarah, transfixed, nears the bloated figure on the sand. 
      The buzzing of flies and gnats louder now. 

      As the train horn blasts, unrelenting, she reaches down,
      pulls off the blanket of seaweed. 

      It is a SEA LION -- swollen and dead -- one black eye staring
      up at her.  The train thunders past.

      CAMERA PUSHES IN to an ECU on the dead sea lion's milky eye --
      blank, somehow knowing.  Sarah -- distorted -- reflected in
      it.  Even here, on this beach, she is unable to escape these
      broken bodies.  And the exhausting knowledge: life doesn't
      care.  It is indifferent.

      Suddenly, Sarah's CELL PHONE RINGS, startling her--

                                      SARAH
                          (into phone)
                    Linden here.

      Off this--

      EXT. DOCKS - DAY (CHYRON: "DAY ONE")

      Industrial docks of downtown Seattle.  In the distance,
      through the now heavy rain, the Space Needle, the gray
      downtown skyline, the waters of Lake Union, all under a
      breathtaking, brooding sky.  A city of contrasts, light and
      dark, sun and fog, where rain falls eight months of the year. 
      A city surrounded on all sides by waterways, ocean, lakes. 
      Stark beauty and dark underbelly.

      Still in her sweats, Sarah exits her car, chomping GUM,
      humping through the rain.  A UNIFORM guards the entrance of
      an abandoned factory, keeping a bunch of LOOKIE LOOS -- sullen
      emo teens and a bug-eyed crackhead -- at bay.

      Badging him, Sarah ducks under the crime scene TAPE.  Met by
      a SARGEANT -- 40s, grizzled, ex-boxer's battered face--

                                      SARGEANT
                    Bout time you got here.

                                      SARAH
                    Viaduct's a bitch this morning. 
                    Whaddya got?                                                                                          3.

                                      SARGEANT
                    White female, from what I can tell. 
                    No ID.  Homeless guy found her coupla
                    hours ago.

                                      SARAH
                    Decomp?

                                      SARGEANT
                    Nah, fresh one.  Someone did a real
                    number on her.

      Sarah glances over at the Lookie Loos.  One of them -- male,
      pierced, baleful -  stares back.

                                      SARGEANT (CONT'D)
                    Think he wants a date, Sarah?

                                      SARAH
                    Your type, go for it.

      She holds the Lookie Loo's stare, then drops her eyes. 
      Exhausted suddenly.  Deeply sick of this shit.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Coroner do Jane Doe yet?

                                      SARGEANT
                    Nah, he's en route.  You're first on
                    the scene.  Body's in the basement.

      He nods to the open freight elevator door, Sarah steps in.

                                      SARGEANT (CONT'D)
                    Want me to walk you through?

                                      SARAH
                    No, I got it.

      He tosses her a roll of BAGGIES.

                                      SARGEANT
                    You outa here next week, right? 
                    Last day Friday?

      She punches a button and the doors begin to close --

                                      SARAH
                    Nope.  Today.

      The doors CLANG shut--

      INT. FACTORY - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

      Doors CLANG open.  Long hallway, flickering overhead lamp. 
      Eerie, dark, trash strewn everywhere.  The LIGHT goes out.                                                                                          4.

                                      SARAH
                    Need some light down here!  Hey!

      No answer.  As the elevator doors CLANG shut, Sarah pulls
      out a FLASHLIGHT.  Battery iffy, flickery.  She moves down
      the hallway, calm.  Used to silent, secret places like this.

      Her light catches a dark SMEAR on one wall.  Blood.  Below
      it, a pile of trash.  Baggie in hand, Sarah sifts through. 
      Pulls out a sharp deboning KNIFE.  Bags it.

      Trains her flashlight on a faint trail of BLOOD.  Leads down
      the hallway to an almost pitch black room.  Sarah follows...

      INT. FACTORY - ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      A large OBJECT, like a side of beef encased in plastic, hangs
      from a hook.  Sarah slowly reaches up, rips it off--

      The Object lurches at her, SCREAMING.  Sarah, terrified,
      pinwheels back, dropping her flashlight.  A glimpse of a
      bloated FACE.  Then ARMS grab her.  Sarah cries out, fights--

      LIGHTS snap on, revealing a gaggle of middle-aged male
      DETECTIVES: one holding onto Sarah, one screaming in a high
      falsetto, the others bent over, clutching guts, laughing--

                                      DETECTIVE #1
                    Think you crapped your shorts there,
                    Sarah.

      On the hook, a BLOW UP DOLL.  Red mouth around a fake SPLIFF,
      Giants baseball CAP on its head.  Written across its naked
      torso: "BON FUCKING VOYAGE, SARAH".

      Sarah takes it in, catching her breath, grinning now.  Ha
      ha, you assholes.  PRELAP SFX: MALE LAUGHTER--

      INT. DINER - DAY

      Rain pelts the smeared windows of this greasy spoon.  Crappy
      MUZAK plays on the loudspeakers.  At a back booth, Detectives
      drink from chipped mugs, laughing loudly.  Sarah with them,
      clutching the blow up doll, Giants cap pulled over her eyes.

      No one caring they're three sheets to the wind at 7 AM.  Not
      the HOBO muttering to himself at the counter or the exhausted,
        mascara-smeared HOOKERS in a nearby booth.

                                      DETECTIVE #1
                    ... What I'm wonderin'?  What're you
                    gonna do in Sonoma anyways?

                                      DETECTIVE #2
                    Yeah, write speeding tickets, meter
                    maid it?                                                                                          5.

                                      SARAH
                    Know what I'm wondering, Jacobi?
                          (re: blow up doll)
                    She new?  Or used?

      They guffaw, Sarah bumps fists.  Much love here.  Yet
      something distant, remote in her eyes.

                                      DETECTIVE #2
                    Candy Cane's never been popped, gots
                    her v-card just like the ladies...

      Waves to the booth of bored Hookers.  One of the girls tiredly
      mimics a blow job back at him.  Sarah tops off his mug.

                                      SARAH
                    Don't think you're shit-faced enough,
                    have another.

                                      DETECTIVE #1
                    Serious, aren't you gonna miss being
                    a murder cop?  All this...

      He gestures broadly to the diner.  The Hobo belches.

                                      SARAH
                    Without a doubt.

      She smiles but the message clear: No, I won't miss it at
      all.

                                      OAKES
                    Always got a job, Sarah, you ever
                    wanna come back home.

      Squeezing into the booth is Lieutenant MICHAEL OAKES -- 50s,
      portly, father figure, soft touch for Sarah.

                                      OAKES (CONT'D)
                    How's Jack doin' with the move?

                                      SARAH
                    Bitching about changing schools. 
                    He'll live.

                                      OAKES
                    He and the fianc  gettin' along any
                    better these days?

                                      SARAH
                          (checking her watch)
                    Damnit...

      She rises quickly, shrugging on her coat, dumping the doll.                                                                                          6.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                      I promised I'd drive Jack to school,
                    his last day.

                                      DETECTIVE #2
                    You jumpin' ship already?

                                      SARAH
                          (shakes her head)
                    No, my plane's tonight--

                                      DETECTIVE #1
                          (bursting out in song)
                    She's leavin' on a jet plane...! 

      The others join, yukking it up.  Shaking her head, Sarah
      exits.  Oakes watches her run through the rain.  Muzak
      playing.  His smile fading--

      EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT - CHINNTENDEN LOCKS - DAY

      The waterway connecting Lake Union with the vast Puget Sound. 
      Seagulls dive and soar above the dark water, their cries
      eerie, echoing.  PRELAP VO: "Jack?  Jack?!..."

      INT. SARAH'S CONDO - DAY

        Rain-soaked, KEYS in hand, Sarah rushes in:

                                      SARAH
                    Jack!  Let's go...!

      No response.  The white-walled, sterile condo emptied of its
      furniture, its people.  Packing boxes stacked everywhere.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Jack?

      As she moves through the barren rooms CAMERA FOLLOWS.  Someone
      watching, closing in...  Suddenly, Sarah spins around--

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Boo.

      Getting the drop on RICK FELDER -- 39, salt-and-pepper good
      looks, healer-of-broken wings type -- smitten with Sarah.

                                    RICK
                    Damn.

                                      SARAH
                    Charlie Brown with the football. 
                    Every time.

                                    RICK
                          (pulling her close)
                    I think Lucy needs a spanking--                                                                                          7.

      Laughing, she pushes him away, looks around.

                                      SARAH
                    Where's Jack?

                                    RICK
                    I drove him, said you had a last
                    minute call.

                                      SARAH
                    Is he mad at me?

                                    RICK
                    No more than he usually is.

      Sarah blinks.  Turns to the packing boxes, not wanting Rick
      to see her face.

                                      SARAH
                    Looks like you took care of
                      everything.

                                    RICK
                    Nothing left to do except put you on
                    that plane.

                                      SARAH
                    You pack the wedding invites...?

      Sarah rummages around in a box, pulls out of box of Nicorette
      GUM, pops one in her mouth--

                                    RICK
                    Already mailed them.  Just family,
                    this round.

                                      SARAH
                    Your family, you mean.

                                    RICK
                    And your Aunt Regi.

                                      SARAH
                    Maybe she can give me away.  What'll
                    your folks think about that?

                                    RICK
                    They won't care.  I just packed that
                    up, Sarah--

      Sarah's sorting through another box--

                                      SARAH
                    Why do I keep thinking I'm forgetting
                      something?                                                                                          8.

                                    RICK
                    Hey.

                                      SARAH
                    What?

                                    RICK
                    Come here.

      He grabs her hand, pulls her close.

                                    RICK (CONT'D)
                    Sure you wanna do this?

                                      SARAH
                    Do what?

                                    RICK
                    Give up the job, the condo, move
                    your kid away from his cool
                      friends...?
                          (beat)
                    Marry me?

      Ah.  The real question.  Sarah takes his face in her hands. 
      Kisses him slowly.

                                      SARAH
                    What do you think?

                                    RICK
                    Not answering my question.

                                      SARAH
                    Hmmm.  How about this...?

      Another kiss, longer, deeper, sexual connect between them
      electric.  From the street, the HONK of a car horn interrupts--

                                    RICK
                    Damn.  Cab's here.

      Sarah licks his neck.  He groans.

                                      SARAH
                    Take the later flight with us tonight--

                                    RICK
                    Already rescheduled a week of patients
                    getting this place together--

                                      SARAH
                    But Candy Cane wants to play.  Lemme
                    introduce you two--

      Laughing, Rick extricates himself.  Barely.                                                                                          9.

                                    RICK
                    Sarah.  I'm gonna miss my plane--

                                      SARAH
                    You're no fun, get over here--

      He dodges her playful grab, heads out--

                                    RICK
                    Tickets are on the fridge.  Flights
                    at nine, don't miss it--

                                      SARAH
                    Yeah.  I do.

                                    RICK
                    What?

                                      SARAH
                    Want to marry you.

      This moment honest.  No jokes.  No masks.

                                    RICK
                    I know.

      Then he's gone.  Sarah spots the TICKETS on the fridge.  As
      she takes them down, a PHOTO - pinned underneath -- flutters
      to the linoleum: Sarah and her 13-year-old son, JACK, smiling
      into camera.  Mom and Son them against the world.

      Sarah hesitates, unsure what to do with the photo.  Then
      pins it back on the fridge.  Only thing left in the empty
      kitchen.  She carefully straightens it.  Making it perfect.

      EXT. SEATTLE PD - ESTABLISHING SHOT

      An old, weathered federal building in downtown Seattle.  The
      American flag at its front.  Pouring rain--

      INT. SEATTLE PD - SARAH'S OFFICE - DAY

      Musty and cramped, mismatched steel filing cabinets, walkie
      static.  On one side, windows look out on the breathtaking
      Puget Sound.  On the other, a bullpen where male UNIFORMS
      and DETECTIVES cross.

      Sarah tosses manila FOLDERS into a cardboard box, packing
      up, almost finished.  Pauses at one folder.  Opens it. 
      Inside, a SKETCH: a lonely grove of trees on the sand. 
      Beautiful.  Drawn by a talented child.

      She stares hard for a beat, then shoves it back into the
      folder.  Dumps it into the packing box.

      Looks around.  Nothing left to do.  Pops a piece of Nicorette
      from its foil.  Chews.  Takes a seat at her desk, at a loss.                                                                                        10.

      Then hurriedly, she picks up the phone, dials before she can
      think about it.  A bored as hell female DRONE answers--

                                      DRONE (O.S.)
                          (from phone)
                    Children, Family Services, can I
                    help you?  

      Sarah hesitates.  Wants to speak.  Can't.

                                      DRONE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                          (annoyed; from phone)
                    Hello?

      Her office door suddenly bangs open, revealing Detective
      STEPHEN HOLDER -- 30, ex-narc, dark circles under his eyes,
      something jumpy around his mouth.  As startled as she--

                                      HOLDER
                          (overlapping)
                    Whoa, what're you doing here--

                                      SARAH
                          (overlapping)
                    Can I help you--?

                                      HOLDER
                    This is my office.

                                      SARAH
                    Who're you?

                                      HOLDER
                    Holder, from County.  You Linden?

                                      DRONE (O.S.)
                          (from phone)
                      Hello-o-o?

                                      SARAH
                          (into phone)
                    Sorry... wrong number.

      Sarah hangs up.  Takes in Holder; his own cardboard BOX in
      his arms.  Uncomfortable in his ill-fitting, cheap suit.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Yeah.  I'm Linden.

                                      HOLDER
                    Thought you'd be outa here by now. 
                    You need more time, I can wait--

                                      SARAH
                    No, come in.  I'm almost done.                                                                                        11.

      Stiff smiles.  Wordlessly, he enters, starts unpacking. 
      Sarah packing.  Awkward silence.  Then--

                                      HOLDER
                    Hear you're moving to LA.

                                      SARAH
                    San Francisco area.

                                      HOLDER
                    Oakland?

                                      SARAH
                    Sonoma.

                                      HOLDER
                    Nice.

                                      SARAH
                    Yeah.

      Beat.

                                      HOLDER
                    So... why Sonoma?

                                      SARAH
                    My fiance lives there.

                                      HOLDER
                    He police, too?

                                      SARAH
                    No.

      Holder glances at her.  End of that convo, too.

                                      HOLDER
                    L.A. born and bred myself.  Nice
                    weather, beach, sun... Hate it.

      Sarah smiles grudgingly.

                                      SARAH
                    You'll love this place then.

                                      HOLDER
                    Been here five years already... Ouch. 

      He's glancing into one of Sarah's boxes.  CLOSE ON gruesome
      crime scene PHOTO of an ADDICT -- white, trashy, fatty (think
      Courtney Love) -- cut ear to ear.  Beneath, the sketch of
      trees from before.  Holder holds up the sketch--

                                      HOLDER (CONT'D)
                    Crack head thought she was Picasso?                                                                                        12.

                                      SARAH
                    Crack head's six year old son drew
                    it.

                                      HOLDER
                    Huh.  Kid get iced, too?

                                      SARAH
                          (shakes head)
                    Sat with Mom's body in their crap
                    SRO for two days before anyone noticed
                    he hadn't shown up for school.

      Sarah takes the sketch from him.  Puts it away.

                                      HOLDER
                    You get the prick who did it?

                                      SARAH
                    Yup.

      She turns away, tapes up a box.  Fort Knox this woman.

                                      HOLDER
                    So... What happened to the kid?

                                      SARAH
                    Beats me.

                                      OAKES (O.S.)
                    Don't waste any time moving in.

      In the doorway stands Lieutenant Oakes.

                                      HOLDER
                    County cut me loose early...

                                      OAKES
                    Welcome.  Got a tough act to follow. 
                    You wrapped up here, Sar?

                                      SARAH
                    Yup.  All done. 

      Oakes hands her a PAPER.

                                      OAKES
                    Good.  Got a call down at Discovery
                    Park.  Check it out.

                                      SARAH
                    On my last day?  Seriously, Loo?

                                      OAKES
                    Still on the city's dime last I

                    You can hand it off end of shift. 
                    Six o'clock.  Go.  Do your job.

      With a sigh, Sarah grabs her coat and a box--

                                      SARAH
                    My flight's at nine...

                                      OAKES
                    Yeah, yeah.  Bring Holder with you. 
                    Show him how to work a scene.

      Holder and Sarah assess one another.

                                      SARAH
                    Grab a box.  We'll take my car.

      Off this--

      INT/EXT.  SARAH'S CAR - DAY

      Sarah drives, Holder yaks.  Squat factories -- abandoned,
        graffiti-marred -- sliding past their windows.

                                      HOLDER
                    ... Worked county narcotics eight
                    years, mostly undercover.

                                      SARAH
                          (no shit)
                    You?  A UC?  Never woulda guessed.

      Holder shoots her a look: whatevs.

                                      HOLDER
                    Mostly street level buys and busts,
                    Joaquim shooting Rakim, blah blah. 
                    War on drugs a hot crock o' shit.

                                      SARAH
                    And you think Homicide's gonna be
                      different?

                                      HOLDER
                    Least you got a bad guy.

      They stop at a light.  Through Holder's window, a TEEN RUNAWAY --
      16, male, filthy dreads, kindly face -- slouches numbly
      against a monstrous duffel bag on the sidewalk.  Rain
      drizzling down.

      Holder presses two fingers against the glass: "Peace".  The
      Teen Runaway lazily sticks up his middle finger: "Fuck you".

      Holder grins, gives him the finger back.  They pull away.                                                                                        14.

                                      HOLDER (CONT'D)
                    Punk ass.

                                      SARAH
                    They hate us, you know.

                                      HOLDER
                    Ya think?

                                      SARAH
                    That kid, Picasso, sat with his dead
                    Mom in that crap motel?  Turns out
                    it was Dad who sliced her.  I put
                    him away.  Twenty to life.

      Holder turns to look at her.  Most she's spoken in awhile. 
      She stares straight ahead into the rain.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Thing is, kid's got no other family,
                    right?  So now, he's stuck in some
                    foster home, his second, third,
                    whatever, no end in sight.  Six years
                    old, murdered hooker for a mom... no
                    one's adopting him.  Damaged goods
                    for life.  Grows up to be some kid
                    on the street.  Another punk ass.

      She stops the car.  They're at Discovery Park.  Outside the
      windows: trees, a lonely fire road, a field.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    So you tell me.  Who's the bad guy?

      She exits.  Holder watches her go for a beat, then follows.

      EXT. DISCOVERY PARK - FIELD - DAY

        A scattering of UNIFORMS in a desolate field, woods in the
      near distance.  Rain abated for now.

      Sarah and Holder approach a young, bored UNIFORM in charge--

                                      SARAH
                    Where's the body?

                                      UNIFORM
                    Still lookin'.  School kids on a
                    field trip this mornin' found this.

      He hands a clear Evidence BAG to Sarah -- inside a shimmery
      pink SWEATER.  Torn, blood-smeared.

                                      HOLDER
                    This park's Tweaker Central at nights.

                    Bottom of the barrel types bring
                    their tricks here.  Could be some
                    basehead got her ass beat.

      He turns to Sarah but she's focused intently on the sweater.

                                      HOLDER (CONT'D)
                          (to Uniform)
                    You check ERs for any incoming last
                    night?

      The Uniform, sullen, glances at Sarah, back to Holder.

                                      UNIFORM
                    Nah.

                                      HOLDER
                    Why not?

                                      SARAH
                    Cuz that's your job.

      She hands the bagged sweater back to the Uniform.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)

                    Wool sweater.  Looks recently cleaned.

                    She brought it to the coin wash, so
                    what.

                                      SARAH
                    You dry clean wool.  Know any tweakers
                    drop their wardrobe off at the
                    cleaners?
                          (to uniform)
                    What else you got?

                                      UNIFORM
                    Not much.  Safeway card.

      He holds out a baggie: inside, a club CARD.  Scrawled on the
      back a name: "STANLEY LARSEN".

                                      UNIFORM (CONT'D)
                    Belongs to a 'Stanley Larsen.'

                    Guy loses his wallet while he's

                                      SARAH
                          (to Uniform)
                    Keep lookin'.  And call in Sex Crimes. 
                    This is theirs for now.

      She heads to the car.  Holder, surprised, follows--

                                      HOLDER
                    Yo.  We got here first.

                                      SARAH
                    Yeah and we don't got a body.

                                      HOLDER
                    Not yet.

      Sarah, impatient, checks her watch.

                                      SARAH
                    You wanna follow it up, go for it.

                    You're my ride, Linden.

                                      SARAH
                    Look, I'll drop you off at the
                    station, I gotta finish packing up--

                                      HOLDER
                    Thought you were done.

                    Hey, your flight's not til nine,
                    right?  I won't let you miss it. 
                    Promise.

      Holder flicks the bagged Safeway card, walks ahead.  Sarah
      clocks something on the back of his neck, peeking above his
      collar: a TATTOO.  The top of an ornate CRUCIFIX.  Sarah,
      curious, follows.  PRELAP SFX: BEEPING--

      EXT. RAINIER VALLEY - STREET - DAY

      BEEPING comes from a small moving TRUCK -- "LARSEN MOVERS"
      printed on its side -- as it backs up to a small grocery
      store.  Muslim SIGNAGE above the locked freight entrance.

                                    STAN
                    Keep comin', comin'... stop.

      Directing is STANLEY LARSEN -- 39, bullish, ex-biker, former
      boozer/brawler turned small business owner and family man. 
      "Larsen Movers" on the back of his red UNIFORM.

                                      BELKO
                    What's that... stank?                                                                                        17.

      From the driver's side emerges BELKO ROYCE -- mid 30s, wimpy,
      mullet-wearer, wanna-be bad boy with a voice that squeaks
      when he's pissed.  Stan's employee and best buddy.

                                    STAN
                    Gonna lose my customer, you keep
                    that up.
                          (to Old Man)
                    Stanley Larsen.  Mr. Abdullah here?

      Stan nods to an approaching OLD MAN -- Somali, shrunken,
      late 60s, in full jellabiya.  A puffy down jacket over his
      traditional Muslim attire.

                                    OLD MAN
                          (heavy accent)
                    Abdullah no here, say you take...

      He indicates a small pile of PALLETS near the freight door. 
      Stan pulls out paperwork, checks--

                                    STAN
                    That it?  He said there were twenty
                    of 'em.

      The Old Man stares, smiling, not understanding.  Belko rolls
      his eyes, impatient.

                                      BELKO
                          (loud)
                    He said there were twenty!  Twenty!

                                    STAN
                    He ain't deaf, Jesus, Belko.

      Stan makes a "bigger" gesture with his hands, points to the
      pallets.  The Old Man nods eagerly, unlocks the freight door.

                                    OLD MAN
                    Ya, ya, here, okay...

      Belko glances around, locking eyes with a clutch of hijab-
      clad SOMALI WOMEN breezing by on the cracked, lumpy sidewalk.

                                      BELKO
                    Place gives me the creeps.

                                    STAN
                    Nie panikuj.

                                      BELKO
                    Nie panikuj, my ass, Stan, Al Qaida
                    there be hatin' on us.

      Meaning a group of SOMALI KIDS - 8, wearing koofiyads and
      jeans -- kicking a soccer ball in an garbage-filled, weedy
      lot.  Staring at them openly.                                                                                        18.

                                    STAN
                    Belko.  He can hear you.

                                      BELKO
                    Osama here don't give a shit.
                          (to Old Man)
                    Do you, Osama?

      The Old Man, unsure, smiles.  Missing most of his teeth.

                                      BELKO (CONT'D)
                    What'd I tell you?

      Stan grins, shakes his head.  The Old Man rolls up the freight
      door.  Inside, racks of frozen GOAT CARCASSES hang in rows.  
      Halal meat store.  Belko pulls his jacket over his nose--

                                      BELKO (CONT'D)
                    Oh, damn.

                                    OLD MAN
                    More.  See?

      Indicating another pile of pallets inside.  Stan nods--

                                    STAN
                    Got it.  Thanks for your help.

                                      BELKO
                    Yeah, Happy Kwanzaa, my brother.

                                    OLD MAN
                    My name Faisal.  Not Osama.

      Belko stares, busted.  Stan smirks.

                                    STAN
                    Tell Mr. Abdullah I'll drop off his
                    paperwork tomorrow.

      The Old Man nods, shoots Belko a haughty look, exits. 

      A mortified Belko quickly tosses pallets into the back of
      the truck.  Stan joins, suppressing laughter.  Can't.  Bends
      over, busting out.

                                    STAN (CONT'D)
                    Osama poned you...My brother...

      Sending himself into another gale.  Belko grins reluctantly.

                                      BELKO
                    Hey, Stan.  Eat me.

      Both of them laughing together now.  Old friends.  Stan's
      cell phone RINGS.                                                                                        19.

      INT. LARSEN APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY - CLOSE ON

      A sopping wet MOP dragged over a flooded linoleum floor. 
      PAN UP to reveal MITCH LARSEN - late 30s, rough-around-the-
      edges-pretty, ex-biker bunny turned housewife and mother.  A
      foot shorter than Stan but a force of nature--

                    ... How many times I gotta tell you
                    we need a new dishwasher, Stan!

      Pulling on a roll of DUCT TAPE, Stan examines the DISHWASHER.

                                    STAN
                    It's just the gasket again, calm
                    down already--

                                      MITCH
                    That thing's gonna stay broke no
                    matter how many times you wave that
                    damn roll of tape at it.

                                    STAN
                    Belko'll fix it then, we can't afford
                    a new one, Mitch--

                                      MITCH
                    I am in no mood for that Belko-will-
                    fix-it bullshit--

                                    STAN
                    There.  Got it.   

      He reaches around the front of the dishwasher--

                                      MITCH
                    Don't you even look at that On button,
                    Stanley Larsen.

                                    STAN
                    Still got the touch, ukochana.

      He hits the ON button.  The dishwasher EXPLODES water. 
      Glumly, Stan stares.  Mitch, despite herself, grins.

                                      MITCH
                    Don't look like it to me.

      She laughs.  Despite himself, Stan joins, grabs at her--                                                                                        20.

                                      MITCH (CONT'D)
                    Get offa me you big dumb lug!

      He wrestles her laughing to the wet kitchen floor, Mitch
      hitting at him playfully and then they're kissing, laughing. 
      This marriage rock-fucking-solid even after 20 odd years.

      As they make out, CAMERA PANS up to the FRIDGE, covered in
      kid's DRAWINGS, PHOTOS.  In one, two little blonde BOYS cut
      up with a blonde TEENAGE GIRL.  The girl from the Teaser.

      Stanley isn't a john.  He's the girl's father--

      EXT. LARSEN APARTMENT - DAY

      Ballard waterfront: squat factories, fishing boats moored on
      Shishole Bay, small, rusty bridges connecting the former
      working class neighborhood to tonier parts of the city.

      Below a sign reading "LARSEN MOVERS" a small, modest working
      garage, the Larsen' apartment above it.  In the apartment's
      front door are lovebirds Mitch and Stan -- post love-making,
      tousled hair.  Mitch adjusts Stan's collar--

                                      MITCH
                    Think they know we just did it?

      Meaning their EMPLOYEES -- including Belko -- in the open
      garage, labelling boxes, pretending not to be looking.

                                    STAN
                    I'll be sure to give 'em a blow by
                    blow.

                                      MITCH
                    You're sick.

                                    STAN
                    Ain't the only one.

                                      MITCH
                    Shut up, you.

      They grin at one another.

                                      MITCH (CONT'D)
                    Hey.  Gotta ask you something.

                                    STAN
                    What.

      She fiddles with his collar, suddenly nervously--

                                      MITCH
                    Don't get mad, promise?                                                                                        21.

                                    STAN
                    Mitch.  What is it.

                                      MITCH
                    Rosie said she'd apply to schools...
                    But she wants to go outa state.

      Stan's face darkens.  Mitch, going for the save--

                                      MITCH (CONT'D)
                    That's good news, right?  Her finally
                    wanting to go to college?

                                    STAN
                    If that's what she wants.

                                      MITCH
                          (annoyed)
                    Course it is.
                          (off his look)
                    Stan, I'm not gettin' into this again--

                                    STAN
                    Outa state?  Isn't she kinda young?

                                      MITCH
                    Almost eighteen, gotta let her go
                    sometime, Papa.

      A flicker of sadness in Stan's face.

                                    STAN
                    I'll think about it.

                                      MITCH
                    Can we afford it?

                                    STAN
                    If that's what Rosie wants, we'll
                    make it happen.

                                      MITCH
                    Thanks, babe.  I mean it.

                                      BELKO (O.S.)
                    Got a move down in Burien, Stan. 
                    Gonna be late...

      Belko climbs into the moving truck, grinning.  Loving this
      family like his own.

                                    STAN
                    Gotta go.

      He smacks her ass playfully.  Mitch pinches his ass back. 
      As he climbs into the truck--                                                                                        22.

                                      MITCH
                    Stan?

      They lock eyes, smile.  Doesn't get better than this. 

                                      MITCH (CONT'D)
                    Nothing.  Get outa here.

      Saying it all without words.  He drives off, passing a
      BILLBOARD on the street.  On it a handsome, Kennedyesque-
      looking man.  Underneath the words: "RICHMOND FOR MAYOR"--

      INT. CATHEDRAL - DAY - CLOSE ON

      Our missing man, DARREN RICHMOND -- early 40s, Gavin Newsom's
      good looks (minus the slick back), City Council President,
      Seattle's JFK.  Richmond stares intently at something slightly
      above eye level.  His face lined with regret.  Loss.

      CAMERA TRACKS around him, revealing a long marble hallway. 
      At one end a beautiful stained glass window.  In front of
      it, a JANITOR silently buffing the shiny floors.

      CAMERA continues to TRACK now revealing austere stone walls
      lined with brass plates, names carved into them.  A mausoleum. 

      Richmond fixated on one name: "LILY RICHMOND." Inscribed
      below: "June 09, 1970  - October 24, 2002".

      His cell phone RINGS.  Richmond, dazed, raw, fumbles for it.

                                      RICHMOND
                          (into phone)
                    What is it, Jamie?

                                      JAMIE (O.S.)
                          (from phone; frantic)
                    Debate's in less than two hours where
                    are you--?

                                      RICHMOND
                          (into phone)
                    I'm... I'll be there.

      He hangs up.  Reluctant to leave.  One last look, then does--

      EXT. CENTER CITY - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

      Seat of political power in Seattle.  Skyscrapers, old stone
      buildings, manicured parks.

      INT. CITY HALL - STAIRWAY - DAY

      A giant, see-through atrium -- glass, steel, suspended
      walkways, views of the Puget Sound and downtown.                                                                                        23.

      Richmond ascends the stairs, a changed man -- smiling, self-
      assured, nodding to various PASSERBYERS.  On his game.

                                      JAMIE
                    Times poll just came in...

      Rushing towards Richmond is JAMIE DEMPSEY: early 30s, policy
      wonk, a younger, nerdier, non-bald version of James Carville. 
      Richmond's brilliant campaign manager, loyal sidekick type.

      On his heels is GWEN EATON -- Richmond's campaign advisor,
      mid 30's, razor sharp smarts meets sophisticated sexiness. 
      Piled down with PAPERWORK.  Coolly assessing her boss.

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D)
                    Adams closed our three point lead--

                                      RICHMOND
                    Good morning to you, too, James.

                                      JAMIE
                      Election's less than two weeks away,
                    we don't have time to be jerking off
                    here--

                                    GWEN
                    Wow.  Not what we're doing I hope.
                          (to Richmond)
                    Where were you?

                                      RICHMOND
                    Slept in.

                                      JAMIE
                    You never sleep in.

                                      RICHMOND
                    I lost my watch.

      Richmond grabs Jamie's wrist.  Checks out his WATCH.

                                      RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                    And you took it.

                                      JAMIE
                    It looks like yours but it's mine.

                                      RICHMOND
                    Are you going Single, White Female
                    on me, Jamie?

                                      JAMIE
                    What's that?

                                    GWEN
                    When do we have to leave for the
                    debate?                                                                                        24.

                                      JAMIE
                          (hurrying ahead)
                    Ten til.  I'll make sure the car's
                    out front.

                                      RICHMOND
                    He's more nervous than I am.

                                    GWEN
                    And you're surprised by this.  Oh
                    my.  What do we have here?

      From her pocket, she extracts a man's WATCH.

                                      RICHMOND
                    Looks vaguely like a man's timepiece. 
                    Where on god's green earth did you
                    find it, Gwyneth?

                                    GWEN
                    On my kitchen counter.

      They share a sizzling smile.  He takes the watch.

                                      RICHMOND
                    Your kitchen counter?  What was it
                    doing there?

      As they enter...

      INT. CITY HALL - RICHMOND'S OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Campaign POSTERS with "RICHMOND FOR MAYOR" everywhere. 
      INTERNS and AIDES rush around, yapping into cell phones,
      carrying documents, drinking Starbucks. 

      Richmond and Gwen stride through the hubbub.  She's back to
      business now, going through papers, handing him a sheaf--

                                    GWEN
                    Press is going to hammer Adams on
                    the gang issue because of the Mall
                    shootings last week.  You help them
                    along...

                                      RICHMOND
                    Mayor killed my midnight hoops
                    tourneys and after school programs
                    four years in a row.  Easy.
                          (off paper)
                    'Now we got kids who're stealing and
                    dealing we could have turned around.'  
                          (turns to her)
                    You write that?

                                    GWEN
                    Jamie did.                                                                                        25.

                                      RICHMOND
                    Not bad.  Punch list here, too?

                                    GWEN
                    Second page.  Mall shooters were
                    Somali teens, recent gang inductees...

      As they enter--

      INT. CITY HALL - RICHMOND'S INNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Richmond's sanctum sanctorum filled with light, ceiling-length
      windows, minimalist design.  At a long conference table,
      Richmond's war council gathers.  Jamie picking up their convo--

                                      JAMIE
                    ... Fifty percent of them below the
                    poverty line, prime recruits for
                    gangs.  Fastest growing pop in
                    Seattle.

                                      RICHMOND
                    Adams cares for corporations, not
                    kids.  Somalis didn't turn out for
                    his last election.

                                    GWEN
                    They will for this one.  Registration
                    numbers in Rainier Valley are through
                    the roof.

                                      JAMIE
                    Today's debate's our turning point. 
                    You actually get them to vote, we
                    got a chance.

                                      RICHMOND
                    We're still at the high school, right? 
                    I want to keep kids front and center
                    of this campaign.

                                    GWEN
                          (nods)
                    Great visuals.  Debate'll hit the
                    six o'clock news cycle.  Dinner time
                    TV.

                                      JAMIES
                          (to the others)
                    We got those posters at the school...?

      As he, Gwen and the others kibbitz, Richmond sits at the
      head of the table, taking it all in.  The energy, hope.                                                                                        26.

                                      RICHMOND
                    Oh, almost forgot... Had a little
                    chat with Councilwoman Yitanes this
                    morning.

                                    GWEN
                    Ruth's talking to you?

                                      RICHMOND
                    Not only that.  She's endorsing me.

      The others react.  Stunned, excited.

                                      RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                    Front page of the Times tomorrow
                    morning, above the crease.  Til then,
                    keep it under wraps.

                                    GWEN
                    The only way we're getting the unions
                    is with her pull.

                                      JAMIE
                    Add the Somalis to those numbers...
                      election's ours.

      Celebratory hubbub.  Gwen's cell RINGS.  Nods to Richmond.

                                    GWEN
                    Mayor Adams.  He wants to see you.

                                      RICHMOND
                          (surprised)
                    What about?

                                    GWEN
                    Didn't say.  Pre-debate psychout?

                                      RICHMOND
                    Let him try.
                          (checking watch)
                    I'll be ready in fifteen.

                                      JAMIE
                    Thought you lost your watch, Darren?

      Observant little bastard.  Darren and Gwen exchange discrete
      smiles.  Off this--

      INT. CITY HALL - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY

      Richmond enters.  A circle of POWER BROKERS surround the
      jewel in the crown -- Mayor LESLEY ADAMS, late 50s, old school
      politician, two term incumbent, deep pockets, slick tongue. 

      On a desk, Adam's briefcase.  Cicero's Pro Quinctio near it. 
      Richmond picks up the book as Adams disperses his inner circle--                                                                                         27.

                                      ADAMS
                    If Cicero had bided his time, he
                    would have gone far.  Instead the
                    Romans executed him.  Put his hands
                    and head on display in the Forum.

                                      RICHMOND
                    I read him in college.  Is there
                    something you need, Mayor?

                                      ADAMS
                    These are tough times for mom and
                    pop, Darren.  The voters want someone
                    with experience.

                                      RICHMOND

      Off Richmond: wondering if he's right--

      EXT. LARSEN APARTMENT - DAY

      Under a darkening sky, Mitch throws out wet rags, a seriously
      fucked up MOP.  Sarah, chomping GUM, and Holder approach:

                                      HOLDER
                    Lookin' for a Stanley Larsen?

      Mitch makes them right off, her face hardening, busying
      herself with the trash--

                                      MITCH
                    He's not here.

                                      HOLDER
                    You his wife?

                                      MITCH
                    Yeah.  What's this about?

      Sarah, quietly observant, takes in the empty garage, modest
      apartment building while Holder talks:

                                      HOLDER
                    Know where we can find him?

                                      MITCH
                    Stan's on a job, I don't know where
                    at.

                                      HOLDER
                    What about last night?  Where was
                    he?

      Mitch puts the lid on the trash can.  Crosses her arms.

                                      MITCH
                    Why're you asking about Stan?                                                                                        29.

                                      SARAH
                    Your husband usually go out at nights,
                    Mrs. Larsen?  Not tell you where?

      Mitch barks annoyed laughter, turns to her--

                                      MITCH
                    Course not.  Stan's always home with
                    me and the kids nights, that's
                      ridiculous--

                                      SARAH
                    Last night, too?

                                      MITCH
                    We were on a camping trip, okay? 
                    Got in late, so yeah.

                    You always get like this when the
                    police come around?  Askin' about
                    your husband?

                                      MITCH
                    No, I don't.  And they don't.  I got
                    things to do, okay?

      Rain begins to fall.  Sarah hands her a CARD.

                                      SARAH
                    Have him call.
                          (to Holder)
                    Let's go.

                                      HOLDER
                    Sure he didn't duck out last night? 
                    Maybe after you got in bed?

                                      MITCH
                    Christ, what's your problem?  Yeah,
                    I'm sure.

                                      HOLDER
                    How?

                                      MITCH
                    How do you think?

      Oh.

                                      SARAH
                    Let's go.

      They head towards the car, Sarah amused.  Holder not.

                    In situations like this I always ask
                    myself... What Would Jesus Do?

      Holder turns to look at her.  Gets it.  Deadpan--

                                      HOLDER
                    He'd say: let her cover for her ho-
                    chasin' husband, ain't my STD.

                                      SARAH
                    Hard-core guy, that JC.

                    Never figured you for a God freak,
                    Holder.

                                      HOLDER
                    Who says I am?

      Sarah grins, warming to him, glancing back at Mitch.  Her
      smile fades.

      Mitch hurriedly wheels several BIKES into the garage, out of
      the rain.  Two clearly belonging to little boys.  The third
        adult-sized.  A girl's.  Painted SHIMMERY PINK.  Same color
      as the sweater in the park.

                                      SARAH
                    Excuse me.  Mrs. Larsen? 
                          (beat)
                    Do you have a daughter?

                                      MITCH
                    Yeah.  Why?

                                      SARAH
                    She go on that camping trip, too?

                                      MITCH
                    Rosie spent the weekend here.  At a
                    friend's house.

                                      SARAH
                    When'd you last talk to her?

                                      MITCH
                    Friday.  Before we left town.  Why?

      Mitch worried now by Sarah's intense stare.                                                                                        31.

                                      SARAH
                    Call her.

      PRELAP SFX: ringing school BELL--

      INT. ROOSEVELT HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY

      Public school.  TEENAGERS gab, flirt, head into class.  Meet
      STERLING FITCH - 17, pretty, chunky, the type who smiles
      when she's scared -- frantically texting on her PHONE: "ROSIE,
      WHERE R U?  CALL ME 911!"  Accosting a nearby TEENAGE BOY --

                                      STERLING
                    Was Rosie in Chem?

      Teenage Boy shakes his head, moves off.  A worried Sterling
      heads off to class, passing opposing POSTERS ("RICHMOND FOR
      MAYOR", "ADAMS FOR MAYOR") outside the gym...

      INT. ROOSEVELT HIGH - CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Sterling sits with other yammering TEENS, firing off a text.

                                      BENNET (O.S.)
                    Settle down, guys, we don't have a

      Kids lean forward eagerly, half the girls in love with the
      cool teach.  DYLAN -- 16, pimply, slack-jawed:

                                      DYLAN
                    Um.  My question is: what exactly
                    does the mayor... do?

      Kids titter.  Bennet sighs.  Sterling furtively fires off
      another text, phone hidden beneath her desk.

                                      BENNET
                    That's not a question, Dylan.

                    else wanna try?

                    What?  I'm not doing anything...

                    Or your cell phone.  Your call.

      Kids titter louder, Sterling reddens.  KNOCK KNOCK.  Saved
      by stiletto-wearing Principal MEYERS in the doorway.

                                      MEYERS
                    Mr. Ahmed, I need to see Sterling
                    Fitch.  Now.

      INT. ROOSEVELT HIGH - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Empty except for Meyers, Bennet and a squirming Sterling --

                                      STERLING
                    ... Um, yeah.  Rosie spent the weekend
                    at my house, Principal Meyers.

      Bennet picks up on her nervousness.  Not Meyers--

                                      MEYERS
                    Then why isn't she in school today?

                                      STERLING
                    I have zero period so, like, I left
                    early and Rosie doesn't?  Have zero
                    period I mean.  So I guess she slept
                    in?

      Meyers sighs, no time for this shit.

                                      MEYERS
                    Go back to class, Sterling.
                          (to Bennet)
                    The debate starts in less than half
                    an hour.  Can you make sure the
                    seniors are seated by then?

                                      BENNET
                    Sure, Ms. Meyers.  No prob.

      Meyers hustles off.  Guilty, Sterling looks up, catches
      Bennet's knowing eye.

                                      BENNET (CONT'D)
                    Nice try.

                                      STERLING
                    What, Bennet?  I told you...                                                                                        33.

                                      BENNET
                    How about telling me the truth?

      Sterling makes a face.  The ever patient Bennet waits--

      EXT. BALLARD - TRANSITION SHOT - DAY

      CAMERA GLIDES under an old, steel bridge, its girders coming
      slowly into frame, black slashes across the rainy sky...

      INT. LARSEN APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

      Mitch sits at the kitchen table, fiddling with her cell phone. 
      Sarah paces, observing.  Holder leading the interview:

                                      MITCH
                    ... Rosie had dinner with me and the
                    boys then she left for that dance, I
                    don't know, around eight?

                                      HOLDER
                    Dance?

                                      MITCH
                    A school thing, for Halloween.

                                      HOLDER
                    And that's the last time you saw
                    your daughter.

      Mitch flinches at the phrase.  Nods.

                                      HOLDER (CONT'D)
                    You remember what she was wearing?

                                      MITCH
                    The usual, jeans, a sweater.  She
                    said only the freshman wore costumes.

                                      HOLDER
                    Can you describe her sweater?

                                      MITCH
                    Pink, glittery, she wore it all the
                    time.  I'd just picked it up from
                    the cleaners.

      Holder glances over at Sarah.  She's staring at the PHOTO of
      Rosie and her brothers on the fridge door.  Mitch, nervous--

                                      MITCH (CONT'D)
                    Why're you askin' about that?

                                      SARAH
                    Your daughter have a history of
                    running away, Mrs. Larsen?                                                                                        34.

                                      MITCH
                          (surprised)
                    No.  Never.

                                      SARAH
                    She upset when she left here Friday?

                                      MITCH
                    What's your meaning?

                                      SARAH
                    You have words with her?  A fight?

      Mitch's face hardens.  Hating this woman suddenly, deeply.

                                      MITCH
                    No.

                                      SARAH
                    But you weren't worried when you
                    didn't hear from her all weekend.

                                      MITCH
                    I told you we didn't have reception
                    at the campground.  She's seventeen,
                    not some little kid we forgot about.

      Sarah blinks.  Ouch.  Mitch sensing she's hit a nerve.

                                      MITCH (CONT'D)
                    Now if you're done why don't you do
                    your job and find my daughter--

      Mitch's cell phone RINGS.  Angry, she turns away, answers. 
      Holder makes a lazy clawing "cat fight" gesture to Sarah. 
      She ignores him, spots an open bedroom door off the kitchen--

      BEDROOM

      POSTERS on the walls, a pink BEDSPREAD, stuffed ANIMALS,
      cluttered VANITY TABLE -- a splash of color and life in this
      otherwise drab, grey apartment.  Bedroom of well loved kid.

      Sarah, drawn to something inside this room, is about to enter--

                                      MITCH (O.S.)
                    That was Rosie's school...

      BACK TO SCENE

      Mitch stands there, stunned, cell phone in hand.

                                      MITCH (CONT'D)
                    Sterling said she never spent the
                    weekend.  The last time she saw Rosie
                    was Friday night.  At the dance.                                                                                        35.

      Off this--

      INT. ROOSEVELT HIGH - GYM - BACKSTAGE - DAY

      Gwen peeks out from behind the curtain.  STUDENTS, PRESS
      noisily assemble.  Richmond absently shuffles through his
      notes at the podium.  Lost in thought.

                                    GWEN
                    Press is falling all over themselves. 
                    I just hope those kids stay awake.

                                      RICHMOND
                    Adams knew I'd come after him on the
                    gang thing.  Covered his bases.

                                    GWEN
                    Expected counter move.  Doesn't take
                    the shine off you.

                                      RICHMOND
                    So why tell me before the debate?

                                    GWEN
                    He's trying to shake you.  Obviously
                    it's working. 
                          (beat)
                    Is that what's really bothering you?

      Richmond, master deflector, pulls her close.

                                      RICHMOND
                    Move in with me.

                                    GWEN
                    Avoiding my question.

                                      RICHMOND
                    You're avoiding mine.

                                    GWEN
                    You can break hearts after you get
                    the single female vote.

                                      RICHMOND
                    You're cold-blooded.

                                    GWEN
                    That's my job.  Taking care of you.

      They kiss.  Hot and heavy.

                                    GWEN (CONT'D)
                    Maybe.  After the election.  If you're
                    ready.                                                                                        36.

                                      RICHMOND
                    I'm ready right now.

      She gently pushes away from him.  Looks him in the eye--

                                    GWEN
                    Darren.  I know where you were this
                    morning.

      Richmond's smile fades.  Suddenly vulnerable.  Exposed.

                                    GWEN (CONT'D)
                    I just wish you'd talk to me.  That's
                    all.

      He wants to, struggles to.  But can't.  Suddenly Richmond
      notices someone in the shadows.  Mayor Adams.

                                      ADAMS
                    Didn't mean to interrupt.

                                    GWEN
                    I'll be in the back if you need me.

      She exits.  They watch her go.  Adams smiling, smug.

                                      ADAMS
                    Gwen's father and I've known one
                    another for years.  Solid family. 
                    Smart woman.  You're a lucky man.
                          (beat)
                    But no one compares with your Lily,
                    of course.

      Lily.  The name at the Mausoleum.  Richmond, stunned, looks
      up slowly.  Can't believe this fuck would go there--

      FOOTSTEPS approach.  Assistant Chief MARK LEWIS - 40s, silver-
      haired, fox-faced, Sarah and Holder trailing behind him.

                                      LEWIS
                    Mayor, Councilman?  We may have an
                    issue...

      INT. ROOSEVELT HIGH - CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      As rain pelts the windows, Lewis, Adams and Richmond powwow,
      Gwen and a Mayor's AIDE with them.  At a respectful distance,
      Sarah and an impatient Holder look on.

                                      LEWIS
                    ... With the press out there, we'll
                    do our best to be discreet.  But you
                    should be aware that the school is a
                    potential abduction site.                                                                                        37.

                                      RICHMOND
                    How long's this student been missing?

                                      LEWIS
                    Since Friday.  We'll need to talk to
                    her classmates, get a clearer picture.

                                      ADAMS
                    Surely this can wait until after the
                    debate, don't you agree, Chief Lewis?

                                      LEWIS
                    I'll hold off as long as you feel
                      necessary, Mayor.  Councilman.

      Richmond, who's noted the impatient Holder, turns to him.

                                      RICHMOND
                    Can it wait?  Your investigation?

      Holder's caught off guard, glances at Sarah.

                                      SARAH
                    Missing kids're usually killed in
                    the first seventy two hours so...
                    no.  It can't.

      Lewis: pissed.  Richmond: liking her no bullshit way.

                                      RICHMOND
                    Then we reschedule.  A missing child
                    takes precedence--

                                      ADAMS
                    She's hardly a child...

      What a douche bag.  Even Lewis looks surprised.

                                      RICHMOND
                    Well, there's the press to consider
                    then, Mayor.

                                      ADAMS
                          (annoyed; covering)
                    Finding the girl is the most important
                    thing here, of course.  Let's
                      reschedule then.

                                      LEWIS
                    Sorry for the inconvenience,  I'll
                    keep you updated.  Detectives?

      Lewis heads out, Sarah and Holder following.  Under his breath--

                                      LEWIS (CONT'D)
                    Better close this thing fast, Linden.                                                                                        38.

      They cross a fretting Principal Meyers in the doorway--

                                      LINDEN
                          (to Meyers)
                    We'll need access to Rosie Larsen's
                    locker.

                                      MEYERS
                    Of course, yes...

      They all trickle out, Richmond and Adams left alone--

                                      RICHMOND
                    Don't you ever say her name.
                          (beat)
                    You understand?

                                      MEYERS
                      I apologize if I offended you, Darren.

      Adams holds his eye.  Guy's a master manipulator.  As he
      turns to go, one more move--

                                      ADAMS
                    Oh and I wouldn't depend on the word
                    of Councilwoman Yitanes.  Ruth's a
                    real flake.  Have a great day.

      He exits, Richmond reeling.  How the hell did he know about
      Yitanes?  PRELAP VO:

                                      MEYERS (O.S.)
                    The debate has been postponed...

      INT. ROOSEVELT HIGH - GYM - DAY

      On stage, Principal Meyers exhorts the student body:

                                      MEYERS
                    ... Please return to your classes...

      The kids throng the aisles, elated they don't have to sit
      through the Snore Fest.  At the front doors of the gym, Sarah
      and Holder - along with two UNIFORMS - scan the crowd.

      Sterling spots them.  Alarmed, she turns, pushing against
      the crowd, and escapes through a side door...

      INT. ROOSEVELT HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY

      Holder and Linden wait outside a classroom as kids file in,
      a few scantily clad TEEN GIRLS eyeing him blatantly.

      He looks at Sarah, shrugs: Can't help it.  Bennet approaches--                                                                                        39.

                                      BENNET
                    I have no idea where Sterling went,
                    I'm sorry.

                                      SARAH
                    We're gonna need her home address.

                                      BENNET
                    Sure, the office'll have it.

                                      HOLDER
                    How long you know Rosie Larsen for?

                                      BENNET
                    Almost four years.  Straight A
                    student, good kid, never any problem.

                                      SARAH
                    She get along with her folks?

                                      BENNET
                    Her mom showed up for every parent
                    teacher conference, back to school
                    nights.  Seemed like she cared.

                                      SARAH
                    What about Dad?

                                      BENNET
                    I never met Mr. Larsen.

      Here comes Principal Meyers, holding up a KEY.

                                      SARAH
                    Excuse me...

      She nods to Holder, all yours.  Heads off to Meyers.

                                      HOLDER
                    You were chaperoning at the dance... 
                    You see Rosie there?

                                      BENNET
                    Yeah, but she left kinda early, maybe
                    around ten?  The party was just
                    kicking up.  No idea why.

                                      HOLDER
                    Who'd she leave with?

                                      BENNET
                    I don't know, sorry.

                                      HOLDER
                    You recall what she was wearing?                                                                                        40.

                    Not really.  Rest of these girls use
                    Halloween to play stripper.  Rosie
                    was pretty buttoned up.

                    That or she thought she'd be an
                    original with clothes on.

      They laugh.  Holder leans in close, intimate--

                                      HOLDER
                    Pretty hot piece... Rosie.

                      I wouldn't know... she's seventeen.

                                      HOLDER
                    Kinda my point.

      He holds a very uncomfortable Bennet's eye.  Testing him.

                                      HOLDER (CONT'D)
                    Boys musta wanted to hit that.

                    I don't think she had a boyfriend. 
                    Anyway, I should go.  My students
                    are waiting.

      He exits, freaked out by Holder.  Off this--

      INT. ROOSEVELT HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY - CLOSE ON

      A LOCK.  With gloved hands, Sarah unlocks it, swings open
      the LOCKER DOOR.  Inside, the color pink everywhere-- book
      COVERS, a feather BOA, a STUFFED ANIMAL, STICKERS.

      Taped to the inside of the locker door are PHOTOS.  Rosie
      with her family.  Rosie as a little girl.  Rosie eating fast
      food with Sterling.  Rosie with some long deceased pet dog.

      Sarah lightly runs her fingers over the photos, becoming
      lost in them.  Landing on one photo that Rosie clearly took
      of herself: flash exploding over a face brimming with life,
      with beginning.  Eyes wiser than her 17 years, sadder than
      she showed the world.  A girl alone in her bedroom at night. 
      No masks.

                                      HOLDER
                      Sterling's not answering her home
                    phone...

      Sarah snaps out of it as Holder approaches.                                                                                        41.

                    Sent a car to sit on her house.  Got
                    anythin'?

                                      SARAH
                          (irritated)
                    Just started.

      Holder joins, rummaging through the locker, tossing out stuff:
      books, loose paper, make up.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Any word on Dad?

                                      HOLDER
                    'Cording to Mom, not answering his
                    cell.  Says he turns it off a lot.

                    Let dispatch know what he's driving.

                    Parents kill their kids.  Always
                    your first suspect.

      Holder glances at her, sensing something else here.  Lets it
      go.  They work in silence, then--

                                      HOLDER
                    Looks like goody two shoes was gettin'
                    busy.

      He holds out an open box of CONDOMS.

                                      HOLDER (CONT'D)
                    Box of twelve.  Five're missing.

                    Teacher said she didn't have one.

                                      SARAH
                    Then who took this?

      Sarah indicates the inside locker door.  The sea of photos. 
      In the middle of them, a glaringly empty spot.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Photo's missing.  Tape's fresh.

      As Holder examines it, Sarah stands, takes in the empty
      hallway.  De-foils another NICORETTE.  Chews.                                                                                        42.

                    Chief Lewis needs to cover his ass. 
                    Means we get more bodies on this.

      Her cell phone RINGS.  She answers:

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                          (into phone)
                    Linden here... Yeah, this is Jack's
                    mother...

      She steps away from Holder.  Listens.  Worried.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                          (into phone)
                    I'll pick him up.

      She hangs up, distracted.  Heads off down the hallway.  Holder
      standing there, box of condoms in hand--

                                      HOLDER
                    Hey.  Where you goin'?

                                      SARAH
                    Get a K-9 unit out to the woods. 
                    I'll meet you there.

      Holder takes in the condoms, the girly pink locker.  The
      blank spot where a photo once was--

      EXT. PIKE PLACE PARK - DAY

      A crap park on the waterfront, catty corner to the Market. 
      HOMELESS dot the benches, teen RUNAWAYS congregate against a
      stone wall.  Among them, on his skateboard, is KRIS EMERSON --
      17, white, skinny jeans, multiple pierces, gages in his ears.

                                      STERLING
                    Kris?  Hey...

      Sterling, out of breath, stands at a safe distance with her
      BIKE.  Fish out of water.  Kris skates up to her leisurely:

                                    KRIS
                    'Sup, Ster-ling.

      Rolling her name on his tongue like toffee.  She blushes.                                                                                        43.

                                      STERLING
                    I need to talk to Jasper.  But, like,
                    he's not at school or at his house...

                                    KRIS
                    And you care... why.

                                      STERLING
                    Cuz the cops are looking for Rosie. 
                    Did they hook up this weekend?

                                    KRIS
                    And I should tell you... why.

                                      STERLING
                    Kris, come on.  She could be in
                    serious trouble, I mean it.  Jasper
                    too.

                                    KRIS
                    Gimme a smoke first.

      Sterling hands him her PACK -- notes his filthy fingernails,
      the post-tweak tremor in his hands as he lights up.

                                    KRIS (CONT'D)
                    He's on the island, weekend house. 
                      Parents're in Abu Dabi or some
                    diseased hole like that.

                                      STERLING
                    So is she with him?

                                    KRIS
                    Scored some blue mickeys, figured
                    he'd be lookin' to bone.

                                      STERLING
                    God...  Gimme his new cell I don't
                    have it.  Kris, come on.  Fine.

      She angrily tosses her pack at him.  He expertly spirits it
      away, produces a filthy pen:

                                    KRIS
                    Come 'ere.

      Kris takes hold of her wrist, slowly writes the number on
      the soft, white flesh of her inner forearm.  Practically
      fucking her with the Bic, with his eyes.  Sterling, freaked,
      steps away.  Rolls down her sleeve.

                                      STERLING
                    Okay... See you.  Thanks.  Bye.

      He wags his tongue at her.  Steel PIERCE in the middle of it
      flashing like a knife.  Bye bye.  Sterling flees on her bike.                                                                                        44.

      OFF Kris: bad ass veneer fading revealing a lost kid.  PRELAP
      SFX: groovy RING of a cell phone--

      INT. JASPER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - CLOSE ON --

      A ringing cell PHONE on an expensive glass table.  Weighed
      down with party detritus -- a dirty BONG, empty prescription
      BOTTLES, candy WRAPPERS, porn MAGS, a woman's THONG.

      PULL BACK to reveal JASPER AMES, a frankly ugly 17-year-old,
      surly mouthed and puffy eyed, in nada but BOXERS and a BEANIE. 
      Intently focused on an uber-violent video game playing on
      the enormous flat screen.  Ignoring his phone.

      The weekend house is immense, waterfront views abound.  This
      is Mercer Island -- where Seattle's rich live and vacance. 
      Where their kids bring their illicit partying and fucking.

      From upstairs comes the sound of BREAKING GLASS.  Jasper
      glances up, then ignores it.  Ignores his ringing cell...

      INT. JASPER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      CLOSE ON a shattered GLASS.  PAN UP to reveal the goblet
      thrower -- a GIRL, mussy blonde hair, splayed nude across
      the bed, face hidden.  Rosie?  She moans, in pain, unable to
      rise.  Is Rosie hurt?  Is she being held captive?  WTF?

      EXT. PUGET SOUND - TRANSITION SHOT - DAY

      AERIAL on the mist-covered islands dotting the Sound.  So
      many places to lose a child.  TILT UP to reveal the Ballard
      skyline...

      INT. LARSEN APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

      Alone, pacing, Mitch frets on her cell phone, swiping at the
      kitchen table top with a wet SPONGE:

                                      MITCH
                          (into phone)
                    ... Stan, you need to call me.  As
                    soon as you get this.  Call me.

      She hangs up, angrily digs at a spot on the already immaculate
      table top.  Stops suddenly and puts down the sponge.  Closes
      her eyes.  Terror flooding in full force--

      Front door BANGS open.  Mitch turns, frantically hopeful.

                                      MITCH (CONT'D)
                    Rosie?

      But it's just DENNY and TOM - 8 and 9 - her two youngest,
      running pell mell, rough and sweet as hyperactive puppies:                                                                                        45.

                                      DENNY
                          (overlapping)
                    Rosie!  We're home!

                                    TOM
                          (overlapping)
                    She promised to bring us biking at
                    the docks, Mom--!

                                      DENNY
                    Can we go, Mom, please please please--

                                      MITCH
                    I can't hear myself think here. 
                    What'd you feed them, Terry?

      Here comes TERRY - late 20s, tight clothing, thick blue eye
      shadow, touch of tramp -  Mitch's younger, prettier sister.

                                      TERRY
                    Bag of sugar with a Red Bull chaser.

                                      DENNY
                    What's a red bill chaser, Mom?

                                      MITCH
                    What Aunt Terry has for breakfast
                    every morning. 

                                      TERRY
                    Go put your backpacks away and Aunt
                    Terry'll give you more candy.

                                      TOM/DENNY
                          (in unison)
                      Alright!!!!

      They thunder off.  Terry's smile quickly fades.

                                      TERRY
                    Any word on Rosie?

      Mitch shakes her head, starts sponging at the table again--

                                      MITCH
                    Stan isn't answering his phone...

                                      TERRY
                    What'd the cops say?

                                      MITCH
                    Nothin', just askin' me bullshit--

                                    TOM
                    Mom?!  Where's Rosie?!

      Tom and Denny fly back in.  The sisters exchange looks.                                                                                        46.

                                      MITCH
                    She's not back from school yet.

                                      DENNY
                    She promised we'd go biking!  Can
                    you bring us Mom, please please--!

                                      MITCH
                    Quit that yellin', Denny, I mean it.

      Harsher than she meant.  Denny goes red-faced.  Bawly.

                                      TERRY
                    I'll take you.  Go get your helmets.

      The boys exit, watching their mom.  Sensing something's wrong.

                                      MITCH
                    You got work tonight, Terry, forget
                    it, I'll take 'em--

                                      TERRY
                    Mitch.  Hey.  I'm staying, okay?

                                      MITCH
                    Okay.  I'm sorry, I'm just going
                    nuts here...
                          (dialing her phone)
                    That girl's getting the ass-kicking
                    of her life, I'm tellin' you.

                                      TERRY
                    Yeah, serious.  You need stilettos,
                    I got some six-inchers in the trunk.
                          (heading out)
                    I'll get 'em ready.  Just don't worry,
                    okay?  She'll turn up...

      She smiles, exits, Mitch smiling back.  Alone in the kitchen
      again, listening to her cell.  Ringing endlessly.  Worrying...

      INT/EXT. LARSEN MOVERS TRUCK - DAY

      TRACKING SHOT of tidy one story homes, white picket fences,
        breathtaking Puget Sound.  Middle America with million dollar
      waterfront views.  Over this--

                                    STAN (O.S.)
                    ... Used to drive around here, me
                    and Mitch, when Rosie was little.

      PULL BACK to reveal Stan in the driver's seat.  Belko riding
      shotgun, chomping a SUB.  Both of them enchanted by the view.

                                    STAN (CONT'D)
                    Pretended like we lived here, you
                    know.  Like... we were comin' home.                                                                                        47.

      He stops the truck in front of a modest HOUSE -- peeling
      paint, overgrown yard, a FOR SALE SIGN on the front lawn.

                                      BELKO
                    Be nice to own that one, huh?

      Stan exits the truck, uproots the FOR SALE sign.  Chucks it.

                                    STAN
                    Already do.

                                      BELKO
                    Shut up.  Stan?  You serious?

      Stan smiles.  Quiet pride.  Belko exits the van.  Can't
      believe this shit.

                                      BELKO (CONT'D)
                    You can't afford this.  What about
                    all the work's gotta be done?

                                    STAN
                    That's why I got you.

                                      BELKO
                          (quietly)
                    You need some help with cash, all
                    you gotta do is say so.

      Stan turns, stares.  Scary fucker when he gets quiet-mad.

                                    STAN
                    I'm done with that.  Been done.

                                      BELKO
                    Just sayin'.

      Belko pouting.  Something else going on here.

                                    STAN
                    You know, it's got a basement.  Fix
                    it up, make it nice, place to stay
                    you ever need one.  Just sayin'.

      Belko nods, moved as hell.  Stan's a good friend.

                                      BELKO
                    What's Mitch think about this?
                          (realizing)
                    You're in for a world of hurt, my
                    brother.

                                    STAN
                          (beat)
                    Rosie never had a backyard when she
                    was a kid.  Doesn't seem right.  A
                    kid not ever having that.                                                                                        48.

      Belko glances at him but Stan won't meet his eye.  A quiet
      moment.  Then Belko's phone RINGS.  He checks it--

                                      BELKO
                    Why's Mitch callin' me...?

      INT. LARSEN APARTMENT - KITCHEN - LATER

      Mid-convo, Stan and Mitch.  She's jumping out of her skin,
      pacing.  Stan looks on, worried, trying to be stoic.

                                      MITCH
                    ... They found a sweater in the park
                    like her pink one, Stan!  And why'd
                    she lie to us?  Where's she been?

                                    STAN
                    She still datin' that rich jerkoff?

                                      MITCH
                    What?  No...
                          (off his look)
                    No!  She broke up with Jasper in the
                    summer you know that.

      He holds Mitch's eye, sensing a half lie.  She jukes with--

                                      MITCH (CONT'D)
                    And now Sterling's run off, won't
                    talk to the cops.  What's going on?

                                    STAN
                    Okay, look, you stay here in case
                    Rosie comes back, I'm goin' out--

                                      MITCH
                    The cops, they asked about birthmarks,
                    scars, jewelry, anything Rosie could
                    be... identified with.

      A beat.  The possibility hangs between them.  Unspoken.

                                      MITCH (CONT'D)
                    I told them about that necklace she
                    always wore.  That butterfly necklace. 
                    Remember, Stan? 
                          (losing it)
                    Her butterfly necklace?

      Terror in both their eyes now.  He takes her by the shoulders,
      firm.  Calming her, himself as well--

                                    STAN
                    She's fine.  She's just a kid, like
                    we were.  Dumb, not thinking of anyone
                    but ourselves...                                                                                        49.

      Mitch half sobs, half laughs, desperate for normality.

                                      MITCH
                    My old man hated you.

                                    STAN
                    Put a lot o' white hairs on that
                    bald head us sneaking around.

      They both laugh now.  Back on solid ground.  At least trying.

                                    STAN (CONT'D)
                    I'll find her, okay?  Bring her home.

      Mitch nods, smiles, as Stan exits, one last glance back. 
      She stands there, in the silence, the empty kitchen.  Waiting
      again.  Not knowing what to do.

      EXT. EASTLAKE - DOCKS - DAY

      Modest houseboats line the dock.  Beneath the arching steel
      bridge, Sarah walks hurriedly with her son, JACK -- 13 going
      on 30, spiky gelled do, handsome, sullen.  She's angry,
      distracted.  Half of her still in the case--

                                      SARAH
                    ... Smoking cigarettes?  At school? 
                    Really, Jack?

                                    JACK
                    It's not like I was doing crack,
                    Mom, God.

      She looks at him, baffled.  Who the fuck is this kid?

                                      SARAH
                    You're going to have to stay with
                    Regi til I'm done with work.

                                    JACK
                    Fine.

                                      SARAH
                    And a promise you won't ever do that
                    again would be nice.

                                    JACK
                          (by rote)
                    Okay, I won't do it again.

      At the far end of the dock, a woman on a small houseboat,
      REGI - 60s, short hair, flannel shirt -- waves.  Sarah smiles
      tightly, waves back.  Smoothing things over--

                                      SARAH
                    So... how was school otherwise?                                                                                        50.

                                    JACK
                    Fine.

                                      SARAH
                    You give our address to your friends?

                                    JACK
                    We're on Facebook, Mom.  Kids don't
                    write letters that's retarded.

                                      SARAH
                    Well it'd be great for them to visit
                    us sometime.

                                    JACK
                    Like that's ever gonna happen.

                                      SARAH
                    They'll love California, there's so
                    much to do for kids your age.  It'll
                    be great.

      Jack looks miserable.  Sarah looks away.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    You'll make a lot of new friends. 
                    Rick's putting together a little
                    party to get all the kids in the
                      neighborhood together--

                                    JACK
                          (softly)
                    He's not my father.

      Sarah looks at him, stunned.  Her cell phone RINGS.  A beat,
      then she fumbles for her it as Jack wanders to the edge of
      the dock.  Used to coming in second.  As she talks, he works
      a big wad of spit from his mouth, dangles it over the water--

                                      SARAH
                          (into phone)
                    What is it, Holder.

                                      HOLDER (O.S.)
                          (from phone)
                    Got the K-9s, we're starting a sweep
                    of the field...

                                      SARAH
                    Yeah, okay.  I'll be there.

      She hangs up.  Looks at her son, at a loss here.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    He's trying his best, Jack.

      Jack watches the spit hit the water.  Doesn't turn around.                                                                                        51.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Jack?

                                    JACK
                    What?

      He turns to look at her.  Oblivious.  Sarah sighs.

                                      SARAH
                    I gotta go.

      She indicates the houseboat, Regi waiting, waving.  Without
      a goodbye, Jack shuffles off.  She watches his small, narrow
      back weighed down by his huge backpack.

      Sarah waits until he reaches the end of the dock.  Regi takes
      him in her arms easily.  Some women do motherhood naturally. 
      Not Sarah.  Torn, distracted, she leaves...

      EXT. DISCOVERY PARK - FIELD - DAY

      HANDLERS unleash their K-9s.  Walk a single uniform search
      line through the brown, wavy grass.  In search of a body...

      EXT. DISCOVERY PARK - WOODS - LATER

      Deep in the woods now, Handlers, K-9s, CSU mill.  Holder in
      the thick of it.  Sarah approaches--

                                      SARAH
                    Whaddya got?

                                      HOLDER
                    K-9s picked up her scent.  Started
                    at the fire road where we found the
                    sweater.  Looks like she ran a zig
                    zag through the field.  Ended here.

      He indicates the ground they're standing on.

                                      SARAH
                    You sweep for possible burial sites?

                                      HOLDER
                          (nods)
                    Nothin'.

      In the distance, the sound of a train HORN.  Sarah look up --
      intense, strange eyes -- taking in the field, the woods.

                                      HOLDER (CONT'D)
                    Maybe she's not here?

                                      SARAH
                    Where's the map?

      He hands her a MAP.  She studies it intently.                                                                                        52.

                    logged vehicle plates at the
                      campsites.  Larsen's car never left.

                                      SARAH
                    You talk to Dad?

                                      HOLDER
                    Not a suspect anymore.

                                      SARAH
                    Need to have a talk.
                          (heading off)
                    And get the unis to do another sweep.

                                      HOLDER
                    We did two, plus the dogs.

                                      SARAH
                    Thought you wanted to learn how to
                    work a scene.

                                      HOLDER

      A FEMALE UNIFORM hands her WALKIE to Sarah who keys it--

                          (from walkie)
                    Got a possible burial site.  Northeast
                    corner of the woods.

      Sarah glances back at a chastened Holder.  Moves on--

      INT. CITY HALL - RICHMOND'S INNER OFFICE - DAY

      An irritable Richmond at his desk.  Gwen and Jamie circling:

                                    GWEN
                    ... Adams announced his new anti-
                    gang funding package while we were
                    at the school.                                                                                        53.

                                      JAMIE
                    Great.  Now it looks like he's been
                    on board all along.

                                    GWEN
                    You shouldn't have canceled the
                    debate, Darren.

      He glares at her.

                                      RICHMOND
                    I didn't have a choice.

                                      JAMIE
                    Wait.  What if we play this debate
                    thing?
                          (off their looks)
                    Missing kid, desperate family, you
                    pulling all stops to find her,
                    campaign be damned...

                                      RICHMOND
                    No.

                                      JAMIE
                    You gotta admit, Darren, it's kind
                    of perfect, especially if that kid
                    turns up dead--

                                    GWEN
                    Jamie, shut up.

                                      JAMIE
                    Adams is so totally fried--

                                      RICHMOND
                    We're not using a family's tragedy
                    for a goddamn sound byte.

      His rage quiet, but terrifying.  A side of him they haven't
      seen.  He composes himself.  Then--

                                      RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                    Adams knew about Yitanes' endorsement.

                                    GWEN
                    What?  How?

                                      RICHMOND
                    Any staff we need to worry about?

                                    GWEN
                    No, of course not, Darren.

                                      RICHMOND
                    Then who told him?                                                                                        54.

      All at a loss.  RING RING.  Richmond's cell phone.  Irritated,
      he answers, as the two move off, talking in low voices--

                                      RICHMOND (CONT'D)
                          (into phone)
                    Richmond.

                                    MEG (O.S.)
                    Darren.  It's Meg.

                                      RICHMOND
                          (into phone)
                    I can't talk right now--

                                    MEG (O.S.)
                    The Times called.  That reporter
                    again.  He's asking questions.

                                      RICHMOND
                          (into phone)
                    About what?

                                    MEG (O.S.)
                    I'd rather we talk in person.  I can
                    stop by your office say five-ish?

                                      RICHMOND
                    I've got a donor thing but, yeah,
                    fine.  I'll see you then.

      He hangs up, worried.  Jamie and Gwen, talking, oblivious--

      EXT. BALLARD - STERLING'S HOUSE - DAY

      Narrow alley behind a weathered clapboard house.  Trash cans
      neatly lined up against a wire fence.  A CAT mewling,
      circling.  Sterling locks her bike against the fence.  Bends
      down to pat it--

                                      STERLING
                    Hey there, Jinxy, you hungry again?

      Footsteps behind her.  She turns, startled.  It's Stan.

                                    STAN
                    Where is she, Sterling?

      She stands, quivering, unable to meet his eye.

                                    STAN (CONT'D)
                    Where's Rosie!

      She looks at him, trembly smile.  Tears in her eyes.  Stan's
      face softens.  Despite his veneer, a gentle man.

                                    STAN (CONT'D)
                    Just tell me.  Please.                                                                                        55.

                                      STERLING
                    She's... with Jasper.

      Stan's eyes go cold--

      INT. LARSEN APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY - CLOSE ON

      Mitch, alone, sits at the table, on edge.  RING RING.

                                      MITCH
                          (into phone)
                    Stan?

      INT. LARSEN MOVERS TRUCK - INTERCUT

      Stan drives, on his cell:

                                    STAN
                          (into phone)
                    Rosie's on the island, with that
                    kid...

      INT. LARSEN APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERCUT

      Mitch: weight of the world off her back--

                                      MITCH
                          (into phone)
                    Jasper?  You sure?

                                    STAN (O.S.)
                    Yeah.  I'm on my way to pick her
                    up...

      INT. LARSEN MOVERS TRUCK - INTERCUT

      Stan, on the phone:

                                    STAN
                          (into phone)
                    No more worrying, okay, babe?

      INT. LARSEN APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERCUT

      Mitch smiles--

                                      MITCH
                          (into phone)
                    Okay.  I love you, Stan.

      She hangs up.  Pinches her eyes closed.  Thank you God.

      EXT. DISCOVERY PARK - WOODS - DAY

      Sunlight fades, almost night.  Deep in the woods, CSU and
      UNIS circle a dig site.  Holder and Sarah look on.                                                                                        56.

      RING RING, Sarah's phone.  She answers--

                                      SARAH
                          (into phone)
                    Yeah.

                                      OAKES (O.S.)
                    Found the girl.

      INT. SEATTLE PD - HALLWAY - DAY

      Lieutenant Oakes, shrugging on his coat, walks and talks:

                                      OAKES
                          (into phone)
                    Mom called.  Rosie's with her
                    boyfriend on Mercer Island.  Dad's
                    heading out to get her.

      EXT. DISCOVERY PARK - WOODS - INTERCUT

      Sarah on the phone with Oakes:

                                      SARAH
                    Mom talk directly to Rosie?

                                      OAKES
                    No, to her friend.  I'm not
                      authorizing anymore OT, I don't care
                    what Lewis wants.  We're way over
                    budget on this thing--

                                      SARAH
                    And you believe Mom's story?

                                      OAKES
                    Only story is some kid got laid. 
                    Come on in, Sarah.  It's over.  Don't
                    you have a plane to catch?

      He hangs up.  Sarah's not buying it.  Then--

                                      HOLDER (O.S.)
                    Linden.

      He's bent over the dig site.  At its bottom, a BLANKET covers
      something lumpy.  Holder pulls back the blanket, revealing--

      A grimy plastic DOLL.  One eye caked with mud.  The other a
      glaring, periwinkle blue.  Holder turns to Sarah:

                                      HOLDER (CONT'D)
                          (baby voice)
                    Mama?

      The Uniforms guffaw.  Sarah moves off, irritated.                                                                                        57.

                                      SARAH
                    Wrap it up.  We're done here.

      INT. CITY HALL - RICHMOND OUTER OFFICE - DAY

      Happy hour for the well-heeled donors.  Richmond and Jamie
      laugh with a gaggle of fat BLUE HAIRS.  Gwen, dolled up,
      interrupts discretely--

                                    GWEN
                    Meg's here.  In your office.

      Richmond nods, exits--

      INT. CITY HALL - RICHMOND INNER OFFICE - INTERCUT

      Richmond enters to find MEG -- efficient, plain -- waiting.

                                    MEG
                    Darren.  Moving up in the world.

                                      RICHMOND
                    Should have stuck it out with me,
                    Meg.  How's the governor?

                                    MEG
                    Slave driving megalomaniac, per usual. 
                    That reporter's asking about when I
                    worked here.  About the trips you
                    took.

                                      RICHMOND
                    My trips are public record, so what.

                                    MEG
                    Not all of them.

      It hangs there.  Richmond, cautious--

                                      RICHMOND
                    You were the only one who knew about
                    those, Meg.

                                    MEG
                    Some of your staff did, too.  And
                    I'm not the one blabbing.

      Gwen enters:

                                    GWEN
                    Your guests are waiting, Darren.

                                    MEG
                    I should go.  You look lovely, Gwen.                                                                                        58.

                                    GWEN
                          (tight)
                    Thank you.

                                      RICHMOND
                    I'll, ah, talk to you later.  Thanks.

      Meg nods, discreetly exits.

                                    GWEN
                    Is everything okay, Darren?

                                      RICHMOND
                    I'm not sure.

      INT. JASPER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

      DING DONG.  The doorbell.  Jasper, still engrossed in his X-
      box, ignores it.  DING DONG DING DONG--

                                      JASPER
                    What?  Jesus...

      He slouches to the front door, opens it a crack.  Stan bursts
      past him, raging like a tornado through the living room--

                                    STAN
                    Where is she?  Where's Rosie?

                                      JASPER
                    If you don't leave, like right now,
                    I'm calling the cops--

      Stan turns on him, slams him up against the wall.

                                    STAN
                    Where the hell's my daughter?

                                      JASPER
                          (whiny, scared)
                    She's not here I swear to God.

      Stan loosens his grip, ashamed.  Then spots the woman's THONG
      on the table.  Other articles of FEMININE WEAR strewn on the
      staircase.  He looks up to the second floor--

                                    STAN
                    Rosie?

      Plunging up the stairs, Jasper on his heels--

                                      JASPER
                    You can't go up there!

      Stan ignores him, rushes into the open bedroom--                                                                                        59.

      INT. JASPER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Sees the nude, blonde GIRL lying motionless on the bed.

                                    STAN
                    Rosie?

      Jasper, panting, behind him.  Stan pulls back the sheets.

      The Girl isn't Rosie and she ain't no girl.  She's a hard-
      looking, 40-something pick up from the "Last Chance" dive
      bar.  Jasper grins, puffs his chest, weirdly proud:

                                      JASPER
                    Told you Rosie isn't here.

      Off Stan, stunned--

      EXT. DISCOVERY PARK - FIELD - DAY

      PD UNITS pack up gear and K-9s.  Sarah stands there, map in
      hand, dog with a bone herself.  BEEP BEEP--

                                      HOLDER
                          (yelling)
                    Let's go, Linden!

      Holder slouches against the car, waiting.  Sarah ignores
      him, pops another NICORETTE.  Her phone RINGS, she answers--

                                    RICK (O.S.)
                    I'm thinking barbecue...

      INT/EXT.  RICK'S CAR - DAY

      Rick drives, sun-kissed Sonoma hills in the b.g.

                                    RICK (CONT'D)
                          (into phone)
                    ... Steaks, burgers, hot dogs for
                    the kids, vegan whatever for the
                    weirdos who do that...

      EXT. DISCOVERY PARKS -- WOODS - INTERCUT

      Sarah nods, half listening, scanning the map:

                                      SARAH
                          (into phone)
                    Yeah, sounds good, Rick.

                                    RICK (O.S.)
                    Then again if Emilio's caters, we
                    don't have to deal with cleanup...

      He blathers on in her ear.  Holder approaches--                                                                                        60.

                                      HOLDER
                    What's the hold up?

                                      SARAH
                    Gimme a minute.

                                      HOLDER
                    You said that twenty minutes ago.

      Frustrated, Sarah drops the map.  Rick still yakking in her
      ear.  In the distance, the train HORN again.  She takes one
      last look around.  Zeroing in on--

      Three 12-year-old GIRLS pushing bikes on the fire road. 
      Fishing POLES slung over their shoulders.

                                      SARAH
                    Where does the fire road lead to?

                                      HOLDER
                    The Sound, why?

      He notes her intensity.  Knows what it means by now.  Shit--

                                      HOLDER (CONT'D)
                    We're not dragging the Puget Sound
                    cuz the girl's not missing anymore. 
                    Remember?

                                      SARAH
                    How far away is it?

                                      HOLDER
                    The other side of the park, Linden,
                    no way she made it there on foot. 
                    Plus she was running in the other
                      direction--

                                      SARAH
                    So where are those girls going?

                                      HOLDER
                    Who cares?

                                    RICK (O.S.)
                          (from phone)
                    Sarah?  What did you say?

      INT/EXT.  RICK'S CAR - INTERCUT

      Rick, on his phone, confused:

                                    RICK (CONT'D)
                    ... Are you there?  Sarah?                                                                                        61.

      EXT. DISCOVERY PARKS - WOODS - INTERCUT

      Sarah stares intently at the girls.  At what lays beyond
      these woods.  Her strange eyes unblinking.

                                    RICK (O.S.)
                    Hello--?

      Sarah hangs up.  Thinking--

                                      SARAH
                    If they're not going to the water... 
                    why do they have fishing poles?

      Beat.  Holder, reluctantly intrigued now, takes the map. 
      Studies it.  Looks up slowly:

                                      HOLDER
                    There's a lake on the other side of
                    the woods.

      Off Sarah's gaze--

      EXT. DISCOVERY PARK - LAKE - LATER

      As the last rays of light fade, Sarah and Holder wait on the
      banks, watching the DIVERS surface, give a thumbs up.

      A crane CLANKS into motion -- pulling something from the
      depths.  A CAR.  Watering pouring from it...

      INT. LARSEN MOVERS TRUCK - NIGHT

      A somber Stan drives, talks on his cell phone:

                                    STAN
                    Rosie wasn't with him...

      INT. LARSEN APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERCUT

      As Tom and Denny -- now in their PJs -- cut up in the kitchen,
      Mitch, on her phone, sets the table:

                                      MITCH
                          (into phone)
                    But you said she was there.

      The boys, hearing the tension in her voice, look up.

                                      MITCH (CONT'D)
                          (into phone)
                    So where is she, Stan...?

      INT. LARSEN MOVERS TRUCK - INTERCUT

      Stan, wracked with guilt, worry:                                                                                        62.

                                    STAN
                          (into phone)
                    I don't know.

      Through his windshield, dark woods, a fire road.  In the
      distance, bright KLIEG LIGHTS.

                                    STAN (CONT'D)
                          (into phone)
                    I'm at the park.

      INT. LARSEN APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERCUT

      Tom and Denny stare at a now very scared Mitch--

                                      MITCH
                          (into phone)
                    Why're you at the park?

                                    STAN (O.S.)
                          (from phone)
                    You said they found her sweater here--

                                      MITCH
                          (into phone)
                    I don't know if it was hers!

                                    TOM
                    Mom?  What's wrong, Mom?

      The boys big-eyed, scared now too.  Mitch snaps angrily--

                                      MITCH
                    Go watch your videos, go on, Tommy.

                                      DENNY
                    Why does he always get to pick?!

                                      MITCH
                    Go!  Now!

      They rush out.  Mitch, barely keeping the terror at bay--

                                      MITCH (CONT'D)
                          (into phone)
                    She wouldn't be at that park...

      EXT. DISCOVERY PARK - LAKE - INTERCUT

      Klieg lights shine down on the fire road where the black Car
      now rests, center stage, dripping water.  Sarah and Holder
      circle, checking inside.  Nothing.  Sarah nods to a UNI:

                                      SARAH
                    Open the trunk.                                                                                        63.

      EXT. DISCOVERY PARK - PERIMETER - INTERCUT

      Stan stops his truck on the fire road, blocked by Crime Scene
      TAPE and UNIS.  He emerges, stone faced, cell phone in hand:

                                      MITCH (O.S.)
                          (from phone)
                    What's going on?  Stan?

      The Unis try to wave him off but Stan doesn't see them.  His
      gaze locked onto the crowd gathered around the black car...

      EXT. DISCOVERY PARK - LAKE - INTERCUT

      Sarah and Holder watch as the Uni opens the trunk.  And then
      they stare, expressionless, at what's inside --

      CU of a Girl's ANKLES, grossly swollen, bindings cutting
      deeply, cruelly into the bluish, mottled skin...

      CU of bloated WRISTS and HANDS -- painted fingernails chipped
      and broken, palms deeply cut -- bound just as tightly...

      CU of a beautiful BUTTERFLY PENDANT on a necklace wrapped
      tightly around a the soft flesh of a girl's bare neck--

      BACK TO SCENE

      Sarah and Holder look on grimly, knowing.  Rosie.  From behind--

                                    STAN (O.S.)
                    Lemme go!  Lemme go!

      At the perimeter, Stan fights off the Unis, enraged--

                                    STAN (CONT'D)
                    Rosie!  Rosie!

      Sarah, always hating this part, takes a breath.  Heads off. 
      Holder, new to this brand of horror, watches her grimly...

      EXT. DISCOVERY PARK - PERIMETER - CONTINUOUS

      Sarah ducks under the tape, approaches Stan, her face neutral. 
      He sees her, stops fighting.  The need and pain in his eyes
      so naked, raw --

                                      SARAH
                    You can't be here, Mr. Larsen.

                                    STAN
                    Is it my daughter?  Is it my daughter!

      Her face giving it away.  Her quiet words--

                                      SARAH
                    I'm sorry.  You can't be here.                                                                                        64.

      In a stupor he steps forward, shaking his head slowly.  No. 
      Another step, no.  Heaves himself suddenly at Sarah--

                                    STAN
                    No!

      Animal agony, out of control, out of his mind--

      INT. LARSEN APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERCUT

      Mitch sits at the kitchen table -- set for five - listening
      on her phone.  Wide-eyed, unbelieving.

                                      MITCH
                    Stan?!  Stan...!

      EXT. DISCOVERY PARK - LAKE - MOMENTS LATER

      Drained, Sarah walks back to the black car.  There, CSU TECHS
      are already quietly at work.  Holder meets her--

                                      HOLDER
                    Ran the plates.
                          (beat)
                    Car belongs to the Richmond campaign.

                                      SARAH
                          (stunned)
                    Richmond?  City Councilman Richmond?

      Holder nods.  Holy shit--

      INT. CITY HALL - RICHMOND OUTER OFFICE - INTERCUT - CLOSE ON

      Campaign POSTER of a smiling Richmond dominates the room. 
      Donors mill around the real Richmond, smiling, charming.  He
      glances furtively at an oblivious Gwen and Jamie.  Wondering:
      Could one of them be the leak...?

      EXT. DISCOVERY PARK - LAKE - INTERCUT

      POP!  A camera flash CLOSE ON Rosie's bound feet.  POP! 
      Another flash CLOSE ON her cruelly bound hands.  POP!  A
      third on the butterfly necklace.

      Sarah stands above the body, looking down.  Haunted by what
      she sees.  POP!  And now we see it, too--

      Rosie - bloated, fish belly pale, one leg bent at an unnatural
      angle.  Her once pretty face mottled black and blue.  Her
      dead eyes like punched out, blackened windows.

      Someone's little girl beaten and broken and torn apart, then
      tossed away like a piece of garbage...                                                                                        65.

      EXT. DISCOVERY PARK - PERIMETER - INTERCUT

      Stan fights the cops, crazed with grief, horror, as they try
      to put him in a patrol car.  No luck.  They wrestle him to
      the ground, camera CRANES high above this broken man...

      INT. LARSEN APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERCUT

      Mitch, phone still clutched to her ear, her voice hoarse,
      knowing everything now, unable to stop:

                                      MITCH
                    Stan!?  Stan!?  Stan...!?

      In the doorway, hidden in the shadows, Tom and Denny look on
      as their mother breaks into a million little pieces...

      EXT. DISCOVERY PARK - LAKE - INTERCUT

      Techs and Unis continue to work, flashbulbs POPPING.  Sarah
      stands apart, alone, staring down into the trunk.

      Camera PUSHES IN slowly on Sarah.  Her unblinking, strange
      eyes fixed on the trunk's sad contents...

      REVERSE PUSH IN on Rosie's body.  Her dead eyes staring back
      into camera, into Sarah...

      CONT. PUSH IN to a CU of Sarah, her carefully controlled
      face shifting slightly.  Knowing what she has to do now...

      CONT. PUSH IN to an ECU of one of Rosie's staring eyes. 
      Sarah reflected in it.  And the silent plea...

      Find him.
