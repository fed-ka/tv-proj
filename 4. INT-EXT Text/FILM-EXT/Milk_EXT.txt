In street clothes, trying to corral an angry mob on City
Hall's steps, Harvey lifts a bullhorn.
HARVEY MILK
Hello, I'm Harvey Milk, and I'm
here to recruit you.
A shell shocked DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 45, wades into a throng of
REPORTERS. Those surrounding her try to quiet the crowd.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN
As President of the Board of
Supervisors, it's my duty to make
this announcement. Both Mayor
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk
have been shot... and killed.
GASPS from the REPORTERS. Dianne struggles to be heard.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN (CONT'D)
Police are looking for a suspect...
Supervisor Dan White.
Harvey lifts a Nikon camera and starts SNAPPING PHOTOS of
Castro Street.
WE SEE WHAT HARVEY SEES THROUGH THE LENS: A HARDWARE STORE,
a LIQUOR STORE, empty buildings, boarded windows...
Harvey points the camera toward The MARQUEE of the Castro
Theater, big letters spelling out... "C A S T R O..."
Harvey points his camera across the street at the gray-
haired, OWNER of a liquor store. Harvey snaps PHOTOS of his
face, an expression of distrust.
Harvey SNAPS a SIGN in the liquor shop window that reads:
"EUREKA VALLEY MERCHANTS SOCIETY."
Harvey's CAMERA focuses on TWO CUTE, YOUNG, HIPPIE BOYS
WALKING PAST, one puts his arm over the other. To Harvey's
eyes it's a very new site. It's overt. Thrilling.
Harvey snaps a photo of an empty storefront with a FOR RENT
SIGN hanging out front.
Harvey's empty store front has been converted to a CAMERA
STORE (with a few, not very impressive, products).
Harvey is out on the sidewalk directing Scott who is inside
the store's large window hanging a sign: "CASTRO CAMERA."
HARVEY MILK
Just a little to the left...
The old liquor store owner from earlier, MCCONNELLY, crosses
the street to watch. Harvey gives him a warm welcome:
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
Hello there. I'm Harvey Milk.
MCCONNELLY
You're the new renters?
HARVEY MILK
Yes. Welcome to Castro Camera.
9.
Harvey extends his hand. McConnelly shakes, but is wary.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
I want to join the, um... What is
it? The Eureka Valley Merchant's
Association. I want to help in any
way possible. I'm no interloper.
A Jew perhaps, but I hope you'll
forgive that.
McConnelly looks from Harvey to Scott in the window.
MCCONNELLY
I don't think your application will
be approved, Mr. Milk. This is a
family neighborhood. Your kind are
far more welcome on Haight street.
HARVEY MILK
(trying to keep it friendly)
What "kind" do you mean, sir?
MCCONNELLY
(not playing along)
The Merchant's Association will
have the police pull your license
if you open your doors.
SCOTT SMITH
Based on what law?
MCCONNELLY
There's man's law and there's God's
law in this neighborhood and in this
City. The San Francisco Police
force is happy to enforce either.
HARVEY MILK
(to McConnelly as he walks away)
Thanks for the warm welcome to the
neighborhood!
SCOTT SMITH
We pay taxes you know!
Harvey grabs Scott's hand... keeps him from heating up, from
pouncing. It's not the time for them to bite yet.
The street is shut down for the first ever Castro Street
Fair. The crowd is mostly gay, the majority congregate
outside Toad Hall bar.
ANGLE ON: SOME OF THE OLD-SCHOOL, IRISH LOCALS milling about,
eyeing the scene skeptically.
Harvey MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD with Scott, shaking hands.
MAN ON THE STREET
Thanks for the party, Mr. Milk!
HARVEY MILK
Thanks for joining the Castro
Village Association!
Harvey arrives at A LONG LINE OF GAY MEN winding out of the
Irish liquor store (from earlier). He squeezes past them,
into the store, leaving Scott outside.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
Excuse me gentleman... ladies.
(finding the shop owner)
Hello! Mr. McConnelly!
McConnelly, at the register, is overwhelmed with all the new
business.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
I just wanted to stop in and see
how business was doing.
MCCONNELLY
Fine.
HARVEY MILK
So you don't mind all these
homosexuals in here, do you?
McConnelly grins, uncomfortable. The line of gay men is
curious about the hubbub. Point made, Harvey does a 180.
12.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
No. No. Just a joke. Mr. McConnelly
here loves our kind. Spend away!
(to McConnelly)
Tell your wife Hello for me.
Harvey spots Scott in the crowd and PULLS HIM TOWARD HIM,
KISSING HIM ON THE MOUTH. It's quite the show. They step
back out onto the street where an Irish band is now playing.
Gay men watch. Some clap. Harvey grabs Scott and spins him
through a sharp waltz. OFF the pair at home in their new
neighborhood.
A NEW sign goes in the window: "We are VERY open."
Harvey, Scott, Jim, Dick, Dennis run up the street toward one
of the Castro GAY BARS where POLICE ARE GETTING OUT OF SQUAD
CARS AND APPROACHING CUSTOMERS crowding around the entrance.
COP
Clear the sidewalk!
Some of the GAY MEN move out of the COPS' way but some of
them don't move FAST ENOUGH. The COPS start BEATING them.
Harvey, Scott and the OTHERS try to break into the crowd, to
get closer to the fight. To pull the cops off their friends.
Danny HANGS BACK, snapping PHOTOS of the event.
Scott SHOVES his way past the cops. A COP BRINGS HIS NIGHT
STICK down hard on SCOTT'S HEAD.
Harvey walks down to Market St. with a box. He waves, shakes,
flirts with everyone. His warmest hello is from a gruff UNION
MAN. Behind Harvey, Scott pushes a loaded shopping cart.
Harvey sets his box down right beside a SFPD OFFICER. It
reads, Soap Box. Harvey steps onto it. A crowd forms.
HARVEY MILK
A week ago, Police officers came
into our area with covered up
badges and sent fourteen of our
people to the hospitals, and to
jail. The charges, "Blocking a
Sidewalk."
Like a round girl at a boxing match, Scott parades around a
blown up PHOTO from his shopping cart: TWO SF COPS DRAGGING
GAY MEN INTO A PADDY WAGON.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
--Let us have our tax money go for
our protection and not our
persecution. Worry about gun
control and not marijuana control.
(MORE)
18.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
School supplies, seniors, not what
books I read--
Scott displays an old "Muscle Boys" magazine. Harvey does a
well timed take. A few hoots from the eclectic crowd.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
My fellow degenerates, I would like
to announce my candidacy for San
Francisco City Supervisor!
Scott unfurls three hand made "MILK FOR CITY SUPERVISOR"
banners that lap over the sides of the shopping cart.
WE SEE SCOTT, DANNY, JIM handing out FLYERS to a variety of
SF CITIZENS: gay boys, older people, Chinese people, scared
straight people, heckling high school boys.
Harvey EAGERLY APPROACHES anyone and everyone, shaking hands
if they'll let him, reaching out to old people, straight
people, gay people, even buttoned down BUSINESSMEN who cross
the street to try to get away from him.
Harvey hands out campaign literature to a PASSERSBY.
HARVEY MILK
Public dental care for retired
people... Legalize pot, vote Milk.
Harvey is distracted. A young, long haired CLEVE JONES
passes. At 18, he looks 15. Harvey tries for his attention:
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
Hey, I like the way your pants
fit... Where are you from, kid?
CLEVE JONES
(LAUGHS)
Sorry old man, not interested.
HARVEY MILK
Where's home?
CLEVE JONES
Phoenix.
HARVEY MILK
I'm Harvey Milk. I'm running for
Supervisor. What's your name?
19.
CLEVE JONES
Cleve... Jones.
HARVEY MILK
Well Mr. Jones, we should walk up
to my camera shop and register you.
CLEVE JONES
Fuck that. Elections of any kind
are a bourgeois affectation.
HARVEY MILK
Is that right? Do you trick up on
Polk Street?
CLEVE JONES
(only half-joking)
If I need the cash... But I'm
selective about my clients.
HARVEY MILK
Tell me one thing before you get
back to work then. What was it like
to be a little queer in Phoenix?
CLEVE JONES
I faked a lung disease to get out
of PE. So what? What are you, some
kind of street shrink?
HARVEY MILK
Sometimes. But what I'm saying is,
Phoenix can change. But we have to
start with our street: rent control,
police abuse, pot, parks, seniors.
CLEVE JONES
(turns to go)
Well, good luck with all that.
HARVEY MILK
You know what I think, Cleve Jones?
CLEVE JONES
That you're gonna get somewhere if
you keep talking?
HARVEY MILK
No. That you need to do what you're
good at. Be a prick. Fight City
Hall. Fight the cops. Fight the
people who made you come here to do
what you do.
20.
CLEVE JONES
Sorry old man, I'm leaving for
Spain tomorrow. Europe. Got all the
cash I need in my back pocket.
A GROUP OF CLEVE'S FRIENDS shout at him to join them. Harvey
watches him dart across the street to his friends.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
I didn't come out until very late
in life. There was nobody to--
ANGLE ON: PARAMEDICS placing a BLOODY VICTIM into a BODY BAG.
COP
The fruit was walking home with
his trick when they were jumped.
REVEAL: Harvey picks a blood stained whistle up off the
street, the man's last attempt to call for help.
COP (CONT'D)
(from the victim's wallet)
Name's Robert Hillsborough. Did you
know him?
HARVEY MILK
He used to come into my shop. Are
there any witnesses?
COP
Just the "trick." Jerry Taylor.
HARVEY MILK
Jerry wasn't a trick. They were
lovers.
COP
Call it what you will. He's our
only witness and he says he can't
identify the attackers.
21.
HARVEY MILK
There'd be a dozen witnesses if
they thought you boys had any real
interest in keeping them safe.
COP
You're the Mayor of Castro Street
now, right Harvey? You really wanna
help? Get your people to show some
discretion on the streets, huh?
HARVEY'S POV: The PARAMEDICS pull up the zipper on the body
bag. We follow the zipper past the victim's bloody hands, his
torso, his face.
Harvey, in his work boots and jeans, watches as a LARGE GATE
SLIDES OPEN allowing his entry. Scott, even scruffier looking
than Harvey, stands next to him.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
The "top gays" in San Francisco
were David Goodstein and his lawyer
sidekick Rick Stokes. David was a
(MORE)
24.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
rich old queen who'd bought the
biggest gay magazine, The Advocate.
He had it delivered to subscribers
in brown paper bags so no-one would
know... That's how he lived his
life, covered up, discreet.
Harvey and Scott are shown to the pool area by a HOUSE BOY.
Statues and potted plants and expensive marble. Everything
shouts "GOOD TASTE!"
Scott strips off his clothes and DIVES INTO THE POOL.
Harvey has lunch with the "gay establishment": DAVID
GOODSTEIN, 58, gold and turquoise jewelry, and Goodstein's
protg, RICK STOKES, 45, reserved.
Rick can't keep his eyes off naked Scott in the pool.
DAVID GOODSTEIN
I worked for a financial
institution. I was very discreet.
But someone spotted me at the
opera, sitting in a box, next to my
lover. And I was fired. That's
when I decided to do something. So
I bought The Advocate. And I use
my money and my influence in quiet
ways, to do what I can...
HARVEY MILK
Endorsing straight candidates is
what you think is best to help us?
DAVID GOODSTEIN
Yes, if they're friendly to our
cause.
RICK STOKES
(DEFENSIVE)
Politics is complicated in San
Francisco, and Supervisor is a
citywide office. Political alliances
need to be built. You can't simply
move here from across the country
and run for office.
HARVEY MILK
But I am running for office. I'm on
the ballot. I have the union rank
and file, the seniors, and I could
use your magazine's endorsement.
25.
DAVID GOODSTEIN
Harvey, we're like the Catholic
church. We welcome converts, but we
don't make them Pope the same day.
HARVEY MILK
And why haven't you run?
DAVID GOODSTEIN
It's too early for a gay candidate
for Supervisor. Especially one
from the Castro. It's bad for the
community's image.
Scott climbs out of the pool and sits at the table, naked and
sopping wet.
SCOTT SMITH
What's wrong with the Castro?
DAVID GOODSTEIN
Nobody works there. It's all sex
and drugs and more sex and no one
taking responsibility for their own
problems.
HARVEY MILK
The cops come into our neighborhood
and beat us. They turn a blind eye
if one of us is murdered.
RICK STOKES
Then we file a lawsuit against the
city. We go to our political allies
in City Hall...
HARVEY MILK
There are no real gay allies. Yes,
our friends may sense our struggle,
but they can't feel it. It's not
life or death for them. We need our
own in office.
RICK STOKES
You can't demand acceptance overnight.
HARVEY MILK
Why not? How can we ask them to
respect us if we don't show
ourselves some self respect, David.
26.
DAVID GOODSTEIN
The more out you make us, the
more you incite them. Step back and
quiet down.
HARVEY MILK
Go back into the closet? Is that
what you're saying? Because I know
the closet. I lived in it for more
years than I care to remember.
(rising to go)
I don't need your endorsement. I'm
not asking anyone for acceptance.
I don't have time to ask.
DAVID GOODSTEIN
For you, politics is a game, a
lark. Like putting on a rock
festival or staging a "love-in."
You're too old to be a hippie,
Harvey Milk!
Harvey turns around, ready for a fight.
HARVEY MILK
I'm not a candidate, I'm part of a
movement. The movement is the
candidate. There's a difference. You
don't see the difference. But I do.
SCOTT SMITH
(getting Harvey out)
Thanks for the swim. I'm sorry I
pissed in your pool.
A SLOW MOTION MONTAGE OF: the citizens of the Castro are
turning out to vote. Young, old, gay, straight... but a
weight hangs over the day.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
When the vote came in on election
day... out of 32 candidates vying
for 6 seats... We came in 10th.
Just a handful short of being the
first big eared, gay as a three-
dollar-bill, cock sucker ever
elected to public office.
27.
MONTAGE: More ACTIVITY inside and outside the shop. More
VOLUNTEERS. The printing press burns through flyers.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
We ran and we lost the Supervisors
race a second time in '75, but with
(MORE)
28.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
more votes than ever. So in 1976,
against everyone's advice, I really
pissed off the Democratic political
power houses, because I ran against
"their boy"--
A SIGN GOES IN THE SHOP WINDOW "HARVEY MILK VS. THE MACHINE."
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
--Art Agnos, a part of their
"Political Machine." And this time
we weren't running for City
Supervisor. This time it was
bigger, California State Assembly.
Art Agnos puts his arm around Harvey as they walk out.
ART AGNOS
You know Harv', your whole rap's a
real downer.
HARVEY MILK
My God, you're handsome up close. I
can't tell you how much I'm looking
forward to licking you... in the
polls.
ART AGNOS
(LAUGHS)
You talk a lot about what you're
against. What are you for? In this
town, you gotta give em' a reason
for optimism or you're cooked.
Art gets into his car and goes. Harvey has no car. He stops
and PONDERS ART'S WORDS... They stick with him.
Harvey walks Castro's streets alone, toward his apartment.
31.
A CAR PULLS UP BEHIND HARVEY. A MAN jumps out of the car, and
the driver speeds around the block. Harvey turns a corner.
The man follows. Harvey picks up his pace. He searches his
pockets for a whistle, a weapon, and beelines it to his shop,
his nerves are failing him.
He gets to the doorway of his camera store, and runs face
first into: CLEVE JONES. He's not the feisty young kid he met
on the street earlier. He's been sitting on Harvey's steps,
waiting with wet eyes.
HARVEY MILK
Phoenix?
(off Cleve's smile)
We should go inside.
They do. Harvey locks the door behind them.
Harvey is on the back of a motorcycle. The driver heads up
Market Street. Folks stand in voting lines, flags outside of
polling places. City Hall's tall dome grows nearer.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
And we lost that Assembly Race too,
which made me a bona fide three-
time, political loser.
Angry young men mill around the streets, their rage building.
Someone TOSSES a trash can and it ROLLS.
A POLICEMAN in riot gear comes up to Harvey.
37.
POLICEMAN
If you can't control em', we will.
HARVEY MILK
Give me permission to march them.
POLICEMAN
Where?
HARVEY MILK
Anywhere.
Surrounded by the massive crowd, HARVEY CLIMBS THE LARGE BOX
that covers the subway construction at Market and Castro.
It's a stage of sorts. Harvey lifts his bullhorn to his lips.
HARVEY MILK
I know you are angry. I am angry.
Follow me through the streets of
San Francisco to share our anger!
Harvey jumps down and begins walking, not sure if the mob
will follow. Finally, they do. Cleve catches up.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
Are they following in back?
CLEVE JONES
Yes. Where are we going?
HARVEY MILK
I don't know.
(off Cleve's concern)
We have to keep them moving.
Exhaust them. March them till they
drop. We can't have a riot tonight.
Harvey LIFTS THE BULLHORN. He starts a marching chant. The
crowd starts following along.
JUMP TO: Gays glare at cops. Cops beat their nightsticks
against their chests and power poles. Anger burns as Harvey
marches the mob toward City Hall. Dick and Jim catch up.
DICK PABICH
They're still too hot in back.
They'll burn the joint down.
HARVEY MILK
Help me turn them up Van Ness.
We'll go all the way to Broadway.
38.
Dick heads back to try and wrangle the crowd. Harvey
continues marching.
Harvey arrives, the crowd still hot. Cops beat their
nightsticks against their shields. Some jab protesters,
trying to incite a fight. Anger burns.
Harvey climbs the steps, his stage. He lifts his bullhorn.
HARVEY MILK
My name is Harvey Milk... And I
want to recruit you.
The CROWD ROARS APPROVAL.
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
I am here tonight to say, we will
no longer sit quietly in our
closets. We must fight. Not just in
the Castro, or San Francisco, but
everywhere the Anitas go. Anita
Bryant did not win tonight. Anita
Bryant has brought us together...
She is going to create a national
gay force!
(The crowd ROARS)
And the young people in Richmond,
Minnesota, or Jackson, Mississippi,
or Woodmere, New York... Who are
coming out and hearing Anita Bryant
on television telling them that
they're wrong, they're sick, that
there is no place for them in this
great country, in this world...
They're looking to us for something
tonight...
(his big moment, realizing
his true mission)
And I say, we have to give them
hope!
The CROWD goes WILD. HARVEY'S SPEECH CROSSES THE CUT TO...
CAMERA MOVES ALONG THE STREET catching glimpses of churches,
shops and tidy houses.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
--promised to stay the same as
ever. Conservative, Irish, Catholic
and with just the right touch of
poetry, they found themselves a
handsome ex-cop.
Dozens of supporters hold "MILK for Supervisor" signs in a
long line along Market St. waving to commuters. Anne walks
the long line, handing out new signs to arriving volunteers.
Harvey is handing out FLYERS. He is exhausted, his throat is
RAW. The campaign is nearly over.
A WEIRD MOMENT: A BOY walks up to Harvey and hands him a
flier. ALL SOUND GOES DEAD ON THE SOUNDTRACK as HARVEY'S EYES
lock into the BOY'S EYES.
Harvey reads the FLIER: Unite and Fight for Dan White.
Harvey looks back to pat the BOY'S head, but he's gone. He
looks to the sidewalk for the kid... a parent... nothing...
TV lights blast Castro Camera. A raucous crowd pours into the
streets to greet the roar of motorcycles. Anne pulls up with
the Sheriff on back. Harvey is passenger on a second bike.
HARVEY IS VICTORIOUS! He is instantly swarmed.
SET TO MUSIC: In his old brown suit, Harvey walks to City
Hall with a crowd of supporters. The familiar faces now
include Jack Lira.
On City Hall's steps, Mayor Moscone swears in HARVEY.
HARVEY MILK
I, Harvey Milk, do solemnly swear
that I will support and defend the
Constitution of the United States
and the Constitution of the State
of California against all enemies,
foreign and domestic; and that I
will well and faithfully discharge
the duties upon which I am about to
enter and during such time as I
hold the office of Supervisor, City
and County of San Francisco.
Bulbs FLASH. A light rain begins to fall. Umbrellas go up.
HARVEY MILK(CONT'D)
Anita Bryant said gay people
brought the drought to California.
Looks to me like it's finally
started raining!
Cheers. Harvey is emboldened.
49.
The neighborhood is booming. Storefronts and sidewalks
filled. This is not the rundown Castro that Harvey moved
into 3 years ago.
Harvey heads home, greeted by his PROUD CONSTITUENTS.
He stops at the CAMERA SHOP when he notices a BROKEN WINDOW
near the side entrance to his apartment.
CA State Senator, JOHN BRIGGS, 47, delivers his message to
the PRESS, THE TV CREWS, AND A MASS OF PROTESTERS.
HARVEY AND HIS GROUP are amongst the crowd.
JOHN BRIGGS
My proposition promises to protect
our children from these gay
perverts and pedophiles who recruit
our children to their deviant
lifestyles, including the ones who
(MORE)
58.
JOHN BRIGGS (CONT'D)
do it in our public schools. It's
time to root them out.
In the crowd is teacher TOM AMMIANO, 36, colorful, worked up:
TOM AMMIANO
And how are you going to determine
who's a homosexual?
JOHN BRIGGS
Sir, my bill outlines procedures
for identifying homosexuals.
ANOTHER PROTESTER
How? Will you be sucking them off?
JOHN BRIGGS
Sir, you can argue with me, but you
cannot argue with God.
It's getting ugly fast. Briggs is whisked away by TWO
OFFICERS. He trips off the curb and is quickly scooped up.
The meeting is breaking up, and Scott lets his NEW BOYFRIEND
go ahead. Harvey ducks away from Jack and intercepts Scott.
HARVEY MILK
I thought you were done with
politics.
SCOTT SMITH
Politics. Not the movement. What
the hell was that in there?
HARVEY MILK
The movement needs people to be up-
front. Why were you fighting me?
SCOTT SMITH
You were the biggest closet case
alive in New York. You told me and
all your boyfriends to keep our

64.
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
traps shut. You were the hypocrite
in there.
HARVEY MILK
My parents are gone. My brother
knows. I'm sure they knew.
SCOTT SMITH
I had to listen to your phone calls
home to Mom. Hear you deny that I
existed. You want to be "normal" as
bad as any of us. More than any of
us... Those are kids in there.
You're asking them to lose their
families.
HARVEY MILK
If their families won't love them
for who they are, who they really
are, then they should lose them.
SCOTT SMITH
That's fucking insane.
HARVEY MILK
(re: Scott's new Boyfriend)
Who's he? Do you live together?
SCOTT SMITH
Someone I'm seeing. He's good for
me. He makes me stay home at
nights, out of the bars...
HARVEY MILK
(quietly, so Jack doesn't hear)
I miss you.
SCOTT SMITH
Oh, Harvey, don't...
(eyeing Jack down the street)
What's that about?
JACK LIRA
(calling out)
Har-veyyyyy!
HARVEY MILK
He needs me.
Scott nods. THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN HARVEY'S ACHILLES HEAL.
He walks away from Harvey, leaving him alone.
65.
A massive, angry crowd has gathered. Baby-faced Cleve takes a
makeshift stage. He lifts the bullhorn and with nerves, reads
a speech. Its pages blow about.
CLEVE'S POV: Harvey watches from afar. Encouraging him.
CLEVE JONES
Forty years ago tonight, the gay
citizens of Germany found out they
no longer had civil rights.
Tomorrow morning, the gay citizens
of Wichita will also awaken to find
that they too have lost their civil
rights. You have whistles. You use
them when we have been attacked.
Tonight we have been attacked.
Initially Cleve is successful, but then the crowd turns,
marching toward City Hall without him.
CLEVE JONES(CONT'D)
Fuck. Shit. Harvey!
Cleve runs as fast as he can to cut through the crowd, to get
to the front. He gets on his walkie-talkie.
CLEVE JONES (CONT'D)
Get the press to the overpass!
ON HARVEY: Ducking through EMPTY STREETS, trying to get AHEAD
OF THE CROWD and beat them to City Hall.
69.
Cleve gets to the head of the crowd.
CLEVE JONES (CONT'D)
Move... Left... Move... Left...
JIM RIVALDO
(charging up)
What are you doing? Where's Harvey?
CLEVE JONES
We're shutting down traffic, both
directions.
Cleve looks up at the press that's arrived on the overpass
above, and turns to two HIPPIE KIDS near the front.
CLEVE JONES(CONT'D)
Disconnect the power arms!
The boys climb up a trolley and knock down the power arms.
Sparks fly. Brakes squeal. The press snaps photos.
Cleve searches frantically for something... He SEES a pile of
DOG POOP. He scoops it up and runs it back to City Hall's
front lawn and plants it in the grass.
IN THE VERY SAME SPOT CLEVE JUST WAS: Harvey with a clump of
REPORTERS, a red and white "No on 6" button pinned to his
lapel (HENCEFORTH, IT'S A FIXTURE).
HARVEY MILK
Dog mess is a hazard, and on top of
that, it's disgusting. Under the
ordinance, dog owners that don't
clean up can be fined. This really
is the bottom line!
He smiles at his own joke, punctuating it by "accidentally"
stepping in Cleve's well-placed dog shit. A BIG grin. BULBS
FLASH. These flashes transition into:
STOCK FOOTAGE: Along Market street: 375,000 people have shown
up for the parade, many holding signs naming their hometowns:
Newark, San Antonio, Lincoln.
78.
A MONTAGE: of the various marchers, floats, "Parents and
Friends Of", high-camp drag queens, etc.
Harvey sits on top of a car with a pink lei around his neck,
a fistful of white flowers in one hand, and in the other, a
hand written sign: "I'm from Woodmere, NY." To a news camera:
HARVEY MILK
Come out! Just come on out!
DRIVING THE CAR: Anne keeps a close eye on the parade
watchers. Any one of them could be an assassin.
111 ON A STREET CORNER - DAN WHITE IS WITH A REPORTER:
DAN WHITE
I see naked men walking around,
naked women walking around, which
doesn't bother me as far as my
personal standards of nudity, but
it's not proper. We wouldn't allow
it for any other parade in San
Francisco, and it should not be
allowed for the gay parade.
Just off stage. Anne hands him a typed postcard.
ANNE KRONENBERG
It came in the mail today.
HARVEY MILK
"You get the first bullet the minute
you stand at the microphone."
(looking for a silver lining)
Looks like the publicity's working.
ANNE KRONENBERG
You don't have to go up there.
HARVEY MILK
It could happen any day, any night,
any time...
(off the ROARING CROWD
that's waiting for him)
The nation's eye is on us. I have
to do this.
JUMP TO: POV shots of cops and loners amongst the massive
audience hint at Harvey's paranoia.
Like diving off a cliff, Harvey launches up to the
microphone. The deafening cheers surely would have drowned
79.
out gunfire, but when it fades, He's standing. He delivers
his impassioned call to action:
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
My name is Harvey Milk, and I want
to recruit you. I want to recruit
you for the fight to preserve your
democracy. Brothers and sisters, you
must come out. Come out to your
parents. I know that it is hard and
will hurt them but think about how
they will hurt you in the voting
booth! Come out to your friends, if
they indeed are your friends. Come
out to your neighbors, to your
fellow workers. Once and for all,
break down the myths, destroy the
lies and distortions. For your sake.
For their sake. For the sake of the
youngsters who are becoming scared
by the votes from Dade to Eugene. On
the Statue of Liberty it says "Give
me your tired, your poor, your
huddled masses yearning to be free."
In the Declaration of Independence
it is written "All men are created
equal and are endowed with certain
inalienable rights." For Mr. Briggs
and Mrs. Bryant and all the bigots
out there, no matter how hard you
try, you cannot erase those words
from the Declaration of
Independence. No matter how hard you
try, you cannot chip those words
from off the base of the Statue of
Liberty. That is what America is.
Love it or leave it.
Wild applause. He scans the crowd as he steps off stage. A
bit surprised to still be alive. Cleve grabs him.
CLEVE JONES
The Mayor says Briggs is on his way
here. He could intercept him for
us. We could get him face to face.
He couldn't ignore us anymore.
HARVEY MILK
Get the press.
Briggs makes a STATEMENT to the press.
JOHN BRIGGS
If they're going to lead such an
open life of homosexuality that
they want a 21-gun salute every
time somebody goes by them, those
people are going to be in danger of
being removed their job.
Harvey heads home from work. He starts into his store.
He sees JACK LIRA'S SHADOW through the curtains upstairs, and
turns instead to the cafe next door.
Harvey walks home. A PASSERBY shouts:
PASSERBY
You're the asshole that just passed
that dog shit thing aren't you? What
the hell do you have against dogs?
HARVEY MILK
(with his trademark charm)
Sir, blind people can't see "shit."
What the heck do you have against
blind people?
The young folks surrounding the PASSERBY laugh and hoot at
Harvey's joke. Even the harassing PASSERBY can't help but
crack a grin. Harvey beams.
Still made up from head to toe as a clown, Harvey walks the
streets of San Francisco. He waves, smiles, poses for photos
with tourists. It's a rare moment of grace. He jumps on a
trolley headed toward Castro. He instantly captures the
imagination of a small GIRL wearing a knit hat.
HARVEY MILK
(re: their hats)
Would you like to trade with me?
GIRL
No. What the heck are you?
HARVEY MILK
Oh, me? I'm an elected official. I
run this city.
90.
He makes a show of it. She smiles. He hands her the flower
he's been holding onto all afternoon.
The party behind him, Harvey scans the block. Cleve catches
up, looking at Harvey, probing:
CLEVE JONES
What's the matter?
HARVEY MILK
You ever heard of sore losers? Well,
I'm a sore winner... I thought we
were goners.
(HALF-JOKING)
I'd started looking forward to the
riots.
94.
CLEVE JONES
I told you, I don't "do" losing.
HARVEY MILK
I think maybe we're best with our
backs to the wall. It's too quiet.
(a new idea, what's next)
I think we should march on
Washington D.C. next year.
CLEVE JONES
Milk, you're a decent politician, a
mediocre businessman, but you're a
lousy gay man.
(Harvey knows what he's
getting at)
Take some time off. Fifty's right
around the corner.
(a devilish grin)
Nobody will want you after that...
I can handle D.C.
HARVEY MILK
(smiles, incredulous)
The people voted for us, Cleve Jones.
CLEVE JONES
They did. There's nowhere to march
tonight, Mr. Harvey Milk. Lets go
back inside.
Turning back, they savor the moment, like father and son
walking to Castro Camera, growing ever smaller in the frame.
Something's snapped. With adolescent frustration in evidence,
Dan is with his wife, the press and a few supporters.
DAN WHITE
It was a major decision on Friday
that I had to come... to arrive at.
But since that time, people unknown
to me, plus my family and friends,
have come to me and stated that
they want me to stay in office,
that they support me... So I'm
asking the Mayor to let me stay in
office to serve the people...
Walking back out onto the street, Anne and Scott turn to look
down Market Street, the camera pans and drifts to reveal:
103.
A MASSIVE CANDLELIGHT MARCH. CLEVE JONES LEADS TENS OF
THOUSANDS of San Franciscans of every religion, nationality,
sexuality, all of the familiar faces and many new ones...
THEY ALL MARCH SILENTLY up Market Street to the palace Harvey
dreamed could be his own: City Hall.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
--If a bullet should enter my
brain, let that bullet destroy
every closet door... And that's
all. I ask for the movement to
continue. Because it's not about
personal gain, not about ego, not
about power... it's about the
"us's" out there. Not only gays,
but the Blacks, the Asians, the
disabled, the seniors, the us's.
Without hope, the us's give up--
As the thousands of mourners arrive at City Hall, they place
their candles around the statue of Lincoln.
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
--I know you cannot live on hope
alone, but without it, life is not
worth living. So you, and you, and
you...
Push in on Castro Camera. The sign still in the window,
"We're Very Open."
FADE TO BLACK.
