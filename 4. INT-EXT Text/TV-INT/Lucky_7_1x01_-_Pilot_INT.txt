is at the wheel, weaving between cars, while MATT (26, 
Hugo Boss suit, smooth) freaks out in the passenger seat, 
looks over his shoulder at a BLACK ESCALADE, pursuing-

MATT

The Escalade closes in; Nicky SWERVES, almost loses it. 

NICKY

MATT
Keep driving like that, it could happen!

From the NOISY CHAOS of this chase, we CUT TO:



A TV SCREEN - showing BREAKING HELICOPTER NEWS FOOTAGE of 
the Bentley chase. Oblivious to it, DENISE (40s, pretty, 
made up and bejeweled to the nines) holds up MOVIE STAR 
PROFILE-CARDS, comparing her own features in a mirror-

 Suddenly, A PLUME OF CASH streams out of the Bentley s
sun roof, slowing the pursuers - as we CUT TO:

pounds heavier than the Denise we saw earlier) - in a 
faux-Adidas track suit. But as she goes to bite into it, 
her husband TED (40s), reading the paper, interrupts her -

Any more word on Bob?

DENISE 
Still in the coma. But Ilene thinks he 
heard her when she told him we won. 

LEANNE
What did Ted say when you told him? 

DENISE
 He got home late. I haven t.

Huh? But before Leanne can follow it up, they arrive at 
the register - Matt is there. Leanne goes through a 
pronounced change of demeanor, seeing him...

LEANNE
Are you okay? I heard the guy had a gun. RICHMAN/ZABEL - LUCKY 7 - 1/27/13                        45.

She puts her hand on his arm; like a warm blanket to him. 

LEANNE (CONT D)
If you need anything... somebody to talk 
to or anything... let me know.

He looks at her, their faces close. She seems so gentle, 
uncomplicated, compared to everything else. The air 
between them CRACKLES and then - Denise pops back in.

DENISE
Did you see Bob at the hospital? 

MATT
No, I tried, but... he was sleeping. 

LEANNE
 the nicest man ever. I hope they Bob s
find the guy that did this and string him 
up by the balls. 

Matt swallows hard, as Nicky steps up from the back as 
Samira is coming in to work. Awkward looks between them. 

NICKY
Is the lottery dude here yet? 

DENISE
Nope. Should be soon.
(then)
Hey, Samira. RICHMAN/ZABEL - LUCKY 7 - 1/27/13                        46.


SAMIRA
Hey, everybody.

Nicky smiles at her, hesitantly. She nods and looks away. 
Leanne pulls out a bottle of vodka. 

LEANNE
A quick little taste for us all to 
celebrate. And one extra one for Bob. 

As she fills shot glasses, we see, out the window -

Not necessarily. The remaining members of 
the pool can still vote to include him. 
So, Matt... Will you excuse us?

Matt nods, looks around at them all, and then leaves, 
hearing behind him as he closes the door: 

WILL (O.S.) (CONT D)
All right, this will be a blind vote, so 
 if you want each of you will write  yes

CUT TO:

Matt fretting. In the BATHROOM, staring at his face in 
the mirror, dripping water. - Working the REGISTER, 
tapping his knee obsessively with a pen. - Pacing in the 
PARKING LOT, chugging from a coffee cup. Will pops out. 

WILL (CONT D)
Okay, Matt, ready for you.



All of the others are there, stoical expressions on their 
faces as Matt enters and takes a seat. RICHMAN/ZABEL - LUCKY 7 - 1/27/13                        49.


WILL
Sorry it took so long, we were trying to 
break the tie. 

MATT
It was a tie? 

DENISE
Two votes for, two against. 

MATT
Wow. So, did you break it? 

Matt glances at their faces - varying degrees of 
stoniness and evasion - ambiguous.

window, they see Bob, laid up in bed, talking to another 
man. The brothers are clearly shocked and remorseful. And 
 emotional reaction-- Denise, seeing Matt s

DENISE

know how close you are to Bob.

face, ashamed. As Will taps on the glass, that man

Minetti leads Nicky down the hall to talk. Matt, tense, 
looks through the window, watching, but not hearing, as- 



Will walks up to Bob, who lies in bed, frail, head 
bandaged, eyes on the ceiling. Ilene sits bedside, spent, 
unreadable. As Will talks with Bob, Ilene shoots a 
strained look through the window at-

He then looks down the hall at-- RICHMAN/ZABEL - LUCKY 7 - 1/27/13                        51.


MINETTI TALKS TO NICKY, away from the others. Minetti 
consults a file- 

MINETTI
You did two years for grand larceny?

NICKY
Is that what it says in your file?

MINETTI
When he hired you, did Bob know you were 
an ex-convict..?

And we SHOOT DOWN THE HALL to Samira, sitting against the 
wall, pretending to read a book, but really clocking 
Nicky, a touch of suspicion in her eyes now.

the tie, Mr. Harris. And if you need some 
time to think about it...

Then, with great difficulty, Bob finally turns his head 
toward Matt through the window, meekly waving him in. 
Bracing for the worst, Matt enters. He walks to Bob's 
bedside. Bob glares at him, then GRABS Matt's wrist-

BOB (CONT D)

have a share of the money.

Congratulations!

MATT
Thanks, Leanne. Whew!

A sweet moment, until- 

MINETTI (O.S.)
Matt, can I have a second?

Matt turns, disconcerted now, to see Minetti waving him 
over. Leanne looks on with concern as he walks down the 
hall to join Minetti and Nicky -

sobbing in his jacket. We SHOOT OVER TO LEANNE, who stops

 a piece of all this. I just wanted havin

SAMIRA
What makes you think it was us?

The math runs through Matt's head like a bolt of 
lightning, and he shoots a look at Nicky, now wondering 
if his own brother could have voted against him.

But Nicky is looking out the window at that Escalade amid 
the crowd; Eddie and Gronk back again, to spook him a 
little. Judging from the look on his face, it's working. 

Leanne puts on a baseball cap, pulls it over her brow, to 
hide her face, when Denise steps up, giddy. She whispers.
