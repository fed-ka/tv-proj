
	... the Metropolis version of the Coconut Grove where
	chorus girl auditions are in progress.  Several girls
	stand in the upstage shadows while GIRL #1 sings in the
	spotlight.  A well-built man with a pretty-boy face sits
	at a table by the stage, shirt sleeves rolled up, smoking
	a cigar.  This is JOHNNY, the epitome of macho.  He has a
	headache.

				GIRL #1
		... psssss... steamed heat, I
		got --

				JOHNNY
		You got nothin'.

	The piano music trails off and Girl #1 stares blankly.

				GIRL #1
		But Johnny, last night you said I
		had talent.

				JOHNNY
		Last night you did.  Next!

	Refusing to give up, she starts tapping just about as well
	as she could sing.  Before Johnny can say anything more, a
	smartly dressed woman slips into the chair next to his, an
	angelic face with brains to go with.  This is TONI.

				TONI
		We have a situation.

				JOHNNY
			(dismissive)
		I'm busy.

				TONI
		It's another fire.  This time it
		was Rudy's place.

				JOHNNY
		I'll take care of it.

	Johnny puffs on his cigar.

				TONI
		But Johnny, I think

				JOHNNY
		Look, you really wanna do me and
		the Metro organization some good?

				TONI
		You know I do.

	Johnny looks at Girl #1, still tapping badly.

				JOHNNY
		Fine.  Put on your tap shoes.  I
		need a new chorus girl.

	He starts to laugh.  She leaves, fuming, and disappears
	behind an office door.

				JOHNNY
			(continuing, exploding)
		I said next!

					(CONTINUED)


	4. 


2	CONTINUED:  2	2

	Girl #1 scurries off the stage.  Johnny squints into the
	upstage darkness.

				JOHNNY
			(continuing)
		You!  With the legs!  Yeah, you.


3	CLOSE ON A PAIR OF GREAT GAMS	3

	... as they step into the spotlight.  We PAN up.  A pair
	of red shorts shows off what it's supposed to.  A white
	blouse tied midriff-style is unbuttoned far enough to notice.

				JOHNNY (O.S.)
		Uh-huh.

	And now the face, expectantly seductive.  It's LOIS LANE.

				JOHNNY (O.S.)
		Baby cakes, you're in.

	Lois smiles.  The other would-be's pass her disgruntledly.

				LOIS
		Sorry, girls. Better luck next
		time.

	off her mischievous look.

	FADE IN:


4	ON A MATCH BEING STRUCK	4

	... its flame being brought to a cigarette.

				LOIS (O.S.)
		Hey!



	Lois blows out the match and chastises the Smoker,
	pointing out the "No Smoking" sign behind him.

				LOIS
		Can't you read?

	She and Clark head down the ramp toward her desk.  Clark
	holds a coffee cup.

				CLARK
		It's too dangerous.

				LOIS
		Not for me.

				CLARK
		Lois, those guys aren't just club
		owners, they're gangsters.

				LOIS
		Look, it's very simple.  The Metro
		gang controls Riverview.
		Riverview's on fire.  I'm going to
		find out why.

	PERRY walks by.  Clark takes a sip of coffee; it's stone
	cold and he grimaces.

				CLARK
		Chief, please, talk some sense into
		her, would you?

				PERRY
		Ever tried to milk a steer, son?
			(to Lois)
		What's the problem today?

				LOIS
		The problem is Clark, here, would
		rather give up a scoop on the
		Riverview fires than let me take a
		few little chances.

	Clark surreptitiously blows on the coffee.


	6. 


6	CLOSE ON - COFFEE CUP	6

	It boils with heat.


7	BACK TO SCENE	7

				PERRY
		A scoop, huh?

				LOIS
		A sure thing.

				PERRY
		Well, Kent, it's always been my
		policy to stand behind my reporters
		and their methods one thousand
		percent.  Why, if you opened up
		that window, said you could fly,
		I'd back you up.  I'd miss you, but
		I'd back you up.

				LOIS
		Thanks, Chief.

				PERRY
		Doesn't mean you shouldn't be
		careful, Lois.

				LOIS
		I will.

				PERRY
			(to Clark)
		Don't you have a press conference
		to get to?

	Perry heads for his office as Clark continues their
	conversation.

				CLARK
		You should've discussed this with
		me before you took it on.

				LOIS
		Why would I do that, Clark?

				CLARK
		Because we're a team.

				LOIS
		But sometimes players have to wait
		on the bench while other players
		carry the ball.

				CLARK
		You're in over your head.

					(CONTINUED)


	7. 


7	CONTINUED:	7

				LOIS
		If you can't stand the heat, stay
		out of the story.
			(beat)
		Besides, I am first and foremost a
		professional and I certainly
		wouldn't do anything to compromise
		my personal safety or the integrity
		of my work.

	JIMMY rushes up to Lois, carrying a garment bag.

				JIMMY
		Lois, here it is.  The dry cleaner
		had a hell of a time with the
		feathers.

	Jimmy opens the bag and pulls out the object in question,
	a skimpy chicken costume.  As they all react...



	... as they go off, their white light strobing onto...


9	LEX LUTHOR	9

	... who stands, beaming, behind a model of his latest real
	estate project, LexHarbor: ultramodern, megalithic, a
	city-within-a-city.  Reporters, including Clark, are
	jammed into the office.

				LUTHOR
		Schools, shops, restaurants,
		theaters, offices, apartments: a
		self-contained community.  A giant
		step forward in urban reawakening.
		A new, bright jewel in Metropolis'
		crown.

	More flashbulbs as the reporters call out questions.

				REPORTER #1
		Aren't you worried about making
		such a large investment in the
		Riverview area at this time?

				LUTHOR
		I never worry, I act.

				REPORTER #1
		But what about the fires?  Even
		Superman can't keep up with them.

					(CONTINUED)


	8. 


9	CONTINUED:	9

				LUTHOR
		Superman has made a valiant effort.
		Unfortunately, he's failed.  I
		suppose this proves he's only
		human.

	Everyone laughs but Clark.

				LUTHOR
			(continuing)
		We must strike at the root of this
		problem.  When a tree is sick, you
		don't merely trim it's branches.

				CLARK
		Instead you'd chop it down and
		plant a bigger one?

				LUTHOR
		If necessary.
			(beat)
		Riverview is currently a blight on
		the face of our fair city.
		LexHarbor will change all that.

				CLARK
		How do you respond to accusations
		that coercion was used to pressure
		the city council to approve this
		project without appropriate study?

				LUTHOR
		I don't respond to accusations.
		I'm more concerned with results.  I
		believe in this city.  I believe we
		can empower ourselves and take back
		our streets from the kind of crime
		and gang influence that apparently
		even Superman can't solve.

	The reporters start shouting questions again as Clark
	reacts to Luthor's words against Superman.  Luthor slips
	through a back door and Clark looks at the model of his
	shining, prosperous waterfront.

	MATCH DISSOLVE TO



	Lois, dressed as a cocktail waitress, learns the ropes
	from TOOTS, a platinum blonde, also in uniform.

				TOOTS
		... and if you hold your tray like
		this, you'll always have one hand
		free for protection.

				LOIS
		Protection?

				TOOTS
		Eyes ain't the only things that
		wander in this joint.

	Meanwhile, Lois has been keeping her eye on the back room
	and the group of well-dressed men that has just entered
	it.

				TOOTS
			(continuing)
		So, when you're not on stage,
		you're out here takin' orders, got
		it?  Now I better get in there with
		somethin' to wet their whistles or
		I'll be back slingin' hash at the
		truck stop.

	Toots tries to take the tray away from Lois who pulls it
	back.

				LOIS
		Let me.  I could use the practice.

				TOOTS
			(pulling)
		They tip big.

				LOIS
			(pulling back)
		There's a twenty in it for you.

	Lois almost loses her balance as Toots lets go of the
	tray.


	10.



	The meeting of the Metros.  Big men with bigger egos
	around an even bigger table.  Johnny sits at the head.
	Toni is the only woman there.

				JOHNNY
		Rocko, you tell the Robertson boys
		they got one week to pay up, then
		you take care of it.  Next, Lou,
		numbers, what's the take this week?

				LOU
		Down, Johnny.  Less street traffic
		on account of the fires, which I
		think it's time we start talkin'
		about.

	Johnny glares at him.

				JOHNNY
		So, you want to run the meeting
		now, Lou?

				LOU
			(worried)
		Johnny, I didn't say --

				JOHNNY
		Then shut up and worry about your
		own problems, like getting revenue
		up before I give Briggs your
		territory.

				LOU
		Okay, Johnny, no problem.

				JOHNNY
		Anybody else?

	The door opens.  All heads turn toward Lois, carrying a
	tray of drinks with both hands.  She feels their gaze.

				LOIS
		Thirsty, boys?

				JOHNNY
		Over here, gorgeous.

	Everyone mutters approvingly as Lois offers Johnny a drink
	from her tray.  He takes it and gives her a little pat on
	the rear for thanks.  After a momentary look of shock, she
	recovers and continues her task.

				JOHNNY
			(continuing)
		So, where were we?

					(CONTINUED)


	11. 


13	CONTINUED:	13

				TONI
		Johnny, Lou's right, I think we
		should discuss these fires.

	There's a rumbling of agreement around the table, although
	no one will come out and say anything.

				JOHNNY
		You got something to say, save it
		for later.

				TONI
		If I've got something to say, why
		shouldn't I say it now?

				JOHNNY
		Because you don't talk at
		meetings, that's why.

				TONI
		Maybe I should start.

				JOHNNY
			(to the group)
		You hear that?
			(to Toni)
		Let me tell you something, Miz 
		M.B.A. All that piece of paper 
		means around here is; do the books 
		and stay out of business.

				TONI
		Stay out and watch it go down the
		drain.

	Toni looks around at the men.  There is an uncomfortable
	silence, no one wanting to look her in the eye.  Even
	though she may be right, no one challenges Johnny in this
	room.  Everyone is tense, waiting for him to respond.  He
	tries to be light about it, but he is seething.

				JOHNNY
		Sure, okay.  Go on, tell us how
		stupid we all are.

	Toni slowly rises to her feet.  Lois smiles.  Score one for
	the girls.

				TONI
		Ever since Papa died I've sat back
		and watched my brothers run this
		organization.
				(MORE)

					(CONTINUED)

	12. 

13	CONTINUED:  2	13

				TONI (CONT'D)
		First Tommy, who didn't stay alive
		long enough to do much damage, then
		Gus, who we won't see for another
		two hundred and forty years, even 
		with good behavior.  And now you, 
		Johnny.

	She looks around the table.

				TONI
			(continuing)
		We're inefficient, we're 
		misdirected, we're a fraction of 
		what we could be if only we 
		concentrated on real business 
		instead of this nickle and dime 
		gangster stuff.  Look at us.  We're 
		more interested in the new lounge 
		act than in preserving the family 
		legacy.  What would Papa say?

				JOHNNY
		Papa would tell you to find a good 
		husband, start havin' some babies 
		and leave the real work to the men.

	Toni looks over at him disgustedly.

				TONI
		That's what he did tell me, Johnny. 
		only he didn't realize that you 
		would all destroy it.

	She turns to go.  He pulls out his gun and points it at 
	her.

				JOHNNY
			(continuing)
		I'm still the head of this 
		organization, and don't you forget
		it!

	He empties his gun into the wall above her head.
	Everyone, including Lois dives for cover but Toni doesn't
	flinch.

				TONI
		Just what we need.  A cool head in
		charge.

	Toni walks out, leaving Johnny fuming and Lois wondering
	whether Clark was right.  We hear a DRUM ROLL...


	13. 


14	CLOSE ON A PAIR OF BLACK SWINGING DOORS	14

	... the kind with round windows.  The glass is opaque,
	with letters "M" and "C" etched onto each pane.

				ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
		Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to
		the Metro Club.

	A man's hands push the doors and we are...



	What was just an ordinary room hours before has been
	transformed into a glamorous supper club, complete with
	sophisticated patrons, candle lit tables and a beautiful,
	blonde Singer on stage giving us her rendition of "Too
	Darn Hot."  Clark, dressed in his undercover outfit of
	jeans, t-shirt, peacoat, and watch cap, has just entered
	the club.  He looks and behaves like a seaman just off a
	ship.  He walks to the bar and bangs his fist on it, which
	causes all the other glasses to shake.

				CLARK
		Gimme a beer.

	The BARTENDER serves him.  Clark puts a five down, takes
	his drink and checks out a little more of the club.
	Johnny, Lou and some of the other Metros sit in the
	audience with their girlfriends.  The Singer pays special
	attention to Johnny and he loves it.  Clark leans against
	a side wall, next to a curtained doorway and watches the
	show.  After a beat, a hand reaches out from behind the
	curtain and forcefully yanks him...


16	BACKSTAGE	16

	... into a little narrow hallway leading to the dressing
	rooms.  It's Lois, all made up, a terry cloth robe
	covering her costume.

				LOIS
			(whispering)
		What are you doing here?

				CLARK
		I came to see the show.

				LOIS
		You'll ruin everything.

				CLARK
		Looks like you're real close to
		the story.

					(CONTINUED)


	14.


16	CONTINUED:	16

				LOIS
		For your information I spent the
		entire afternoon with the leader of
		the Metros in his inner sanctum.

				CLARK
		Wearing this?

	He tries to peek at her costume.  A feather pokes out.
	She pokes it back in and looks at his clothes.

				LOIS
		And who are you supposed to be,
		Popeye the Sailor?

				BACKSTAGE VOICE (O.S.)
		Five minutes!

				LOIS
			(to Clark)
		Go away!

				CLARK
		I'm here to back you up..

				LOIS
		I don't need back up.

				CLARK
		I think you do.  How'd you get so
		close to this guy, anyway?

				LOIS
		He's a man.  I'm a woman.  You want
		me to draw you a diagram?

				BACKSTAGE VOICE (O.S.)
		Places!  That means you, sweet
		thing.

				CLARK
		What have you found out?

				LOIS
		Johnny and his sister don't exactly
		see eye to eye.  There's some kind
		of power struggle going on.  Now
		fly.

				CLARK
		And miss your debut?  I think I'll
		stick around.

				LOIS
		Clark, you'll stick out like a sore
		thumb.

					(CONTINUED)


	15. 


16	CONTINUED:  2	16

				CLARK
		Thanks for worrying, but... I think
		you're on.
			(beat)
		Sweet thing.

	And with that she's off to her dressing room and Clark
	goes back into...


17	THE MAIN ROOM	17

	... where Clark heads back toward the bar, resuming his
	disgruntled sailor demeanor.

				CLARK
		Whiskey. Make it a double.

	The Bartender complies and Clark swigs it back.

				CLARK
			(continuing)
		Another one.

				BARTENDER
		It's gonna hit you like a ton of
		bricks, buddy.

				CLARK
		Alcohol never affects me.

				BARTENDER
		Sure, sure.

				CLARK
		Besides, can't be any worse than
		what's already happened to me
		today. Hit me again.

	The Bartender does. Clark downs that one too.  Clearly,
	nothing happens to him when he drinks. There is a DRUNK
	at the end of the bar.  Clark studies his mannerisms and,
	one by one, introduces them to his own behavior:
	slouching, slurring, staring, gesturing.

				CLARK
			(continuing)
		Don't you want to know what
		happened?  I got fired, that's
		what.  Thrown off my ship, just
		like that.

	By now Clark is getting very LOUD. He downs another shot
	while another number starts on stage, "Down on the Farm."
	As the Singer begins the verse the chorus girls make their
	entrance behind her.

					(CONTINUED)


	16. 


17	CONTINUED:	17

	They are all dressed in skimpy barnyard outfits.  Lois is
	the chicken.  It takes Clark a moment to get over this
	sight and remember what he's doing.

				CLARK
			(continuing)
		Gimme another.

				BARTENDER
		Sure thing, pal.

	He pours.  Lois looks over from the stage, wondering what
	he's up to.

				CLARK
		Got any job openings around here?
		I've done some bartending.

				BARTENDER
			(disapproving)
		I don't think so.

				CLARK
		Why not?

				BARTENDER
		You're not the type.

				CLARK
			(too loudly)
		What's that supposed to mean?

	Meanwhile, Toni has come up next to him.

				TONI
		Is there a problem here?

	The Bartender indicates Clark.

				CLARK
		No problem.  I was just asking your
		man, here, about a job.

				TONI
		I'm afraid we have no openings at
		present.  I'm also afraid I'm going
		to have to ask you to leave.  We
		have a strict dress code here at
		the Metro Club and--

	Just then the black swinging doors BURST open and people
	begin to SCREAM.  Four figures, dressed in metallic
	warm-up suits with matching hoods and masks line up facing
	Johnny at the table.  They look like asbestos cat burglars
	ready to repeat the St. Valentine's Day massacre.  These 
	are THE TOASTERS.  One by one, they pull out small, 
	automatic, uzi-like weapons, also known as Toasters.


	17. 


18	CLOSE ON ONE OF THE WEAPONS	18

	... a menacing sight equipped with a dial that reads
	"Light - Medium - Toast" with corresponding numbers one
	through ten underneath.  A gloved hand enters the frame
	and turns the dial up to "Toast."

				TOASTER #1
		Johnny, you're a dead man!

	People are scattering, but the Toasters aren't interested.
	They only want Johnny.  He makes a run for the office
	door.  They aim and fire.  Literally.  Instead of bullets,
	small pellets of flame are expelled from the guns.  Clark
	leaps over and tackles Johnny to the ground, taking all
	the fire himself.  The flame bullets singe his clothes but
	can't hurt him.

	Lois watches, aghast.  Small fires have begun all over the
	club.  Several Metros have raised their guns and started
	firing back at the Toasters who flee the scene.  Clark
	looks over to see Toni trapped at the bar by flames.  He
	hurries through them, picks her up, then places her out of
	harm's way.  By now everyone has run out of the club.
	Lois rushes over to Clark.

				CLARK
		Out, everyone out.

	He pushes Lois and Toni toward the door.  Lou drags Johnny
	Out.  Clark is left there alone.  He inhales deeply, then
	uses his SUPER BREATH again, this time with more 
	magnitude.  The small fires go out before they have time
	to do much more damage.  Clark catches his breath as he
	looks over at the far wall.  The word "TOASTERS" has been
	burned into it.  It's still smoking.  Lois races back in.

				LOIS
		Clark, are you okay?
			(off his nod)
		Who were those guys?

	She sees the words on the wall, sees he's all right.

				CLARK
		I think we've just been introduced
		to the Toasters.

	Off their faces as they try to put the pieces of the
	puzzle together.

                                 END ACT ONE

20	PULL BACK	20

	... to reveal many employees working to clean the place
	up, including Lois.  One by one she sees the Metros enter
	the back room for another meeting.  She picks up a tray
	and heads for the door but Lou stops her.

				LOU
		Beat it.

	He slams the door in her face.  She looks around, making
	sure no one sees her, then slips through the curtained
	doorway and into the...


21	BACKSTAGE HALLWAY	21

	... where she and Clark were the night before. She looks
	around again, then steps into a...

	shelf, revealing three bullet holes. She looks through
	one.


23	LOIS' POV	23

	... into the Back Room.  These are the bullet holes that
	Johnny made when he shot the place up.  All the Metros are

		Get him out of here.

	They do.  She addresses the rest of them.

				TONI
			(continuing)
		I know some of you want to go back
		to the way things were when my
		father was alive, but that's not
		going to happen.  We've got an
		opportunity to move our
		organization to the next level.
		Out of the back room and into the
		board room.  If any of you
		disagree, you can always join
		Johnny in retirement.  Any
		questions?

	Not a word.

				TONI
			(continuing)
		Good.  Let's go to work.


	20. 


26	BACK TO LOIS	26

	... who has heard it all from the supply closet.

					CUT TO:



	Clark is eating a cold chicken lunch and typing into his
	computer as Lois rushes in.  She holds a trench coat
	tightly around her, but her cocktail waitress fishnets and
	spiked heels are visible from the knee down.

				LOIS
			(breathless)
		You haven't sent our Toaster
		article down to copy yet, have you?

				CLARK
			(swallowing)
		Just putting the finishing touches
		on it now.
			(offering)
		Drumstick?

				LOIS
			(slow burn)
		I swear, if you breathe one word...

				CLARK
			(grinning)
		You were saying something about the
		article?

				LOIS
		Yeah.  Stop the presses.  The
		Metros just had a big meeting.
		Johnny's out and his sister Toni
		has taken over.

	Lois, forgetting, rips off her coat while firing up her
	computer.

				LOIS
			(continuing)
		If we hurry we can make it into the
		afternoon edition.

	People begin to stare at her outfit.

				CLARK
		Uh, Lois?

				LOIS
		Clark, I'm on a deadline here.

					(CONTINUED)

	21. 


27	CONTINUED:	27

	Before he can say anything more, Jimmy strolls by, sizing
	Lois up.

				JIMMY
		Professional, but naughty.  I like
		it.

	Lois suddenly realizes why everyone is staring.  She grabs
	her coat and puts it back on.  Jimmy moves off.  Clark
	leans over to Lois.

				CLARK
		So I guess if Johnny's out, so's
		your plan.

				LOIS
		Don't be ridiculous, I'm perfectly
		placed.

				CLARK
		I may be, too.

				LOIS
		What are you talking about?

				CLARK
		Toni asked me to meet her at the
		club this afternoon.

				LOIS
		For what?

				CLARK
		I'm a man, she's a woman.  You want
		me to draw you a diagram?

	Lois looks at him, deadpan, as Perry walks up.

				PERRY
		Lois, how's the undercover work
		going?

				LOIS
		Fine, chief, just fine.

				PERRY
		Good.  Didn't think you'd chicken
		out on me.

	He and Clark share a laugh as Lois just glares.

					CUT TO:


	22. 



	The place looks better, but people are still straightening
	up.  Clark stands in the b.g. while Toni storms in and
	throws a copy of The Daily Planet down on the bar next to
	Lou.  She is furious.

				TONI
		Since when is Metro business front
		page news?

	Clark activates his SUPER HEARING and listens in.

				LOU
		Since the Toasters declared war on
		US.

				TONI
		I don't mean that, I mean
		information that could only have
		come from our meeting, that I'm the
		new head of the Metros.  Could
		Johnny have leaked the story?

				LOU
		Uh-uh, we put him on a plane, like
		you said.

				TONI
		Then it's someone else.  Find him.
		Fast.  We can't afford this kind of
		exposure.

	The Bartender comes up to them.

				BARTENDER
		It's the guy from last night.  You
		said you wanted to see him?

	Toni looks over and sees Clark, back in his dock clothes.

				TONI
		Send him over.

	She nods to dismiss Lou and watches approvingly as Clark
	walks over.

				TONI
			(continuing)
		I've changed my mind.

				CLARK
		About what?

				TONI
		The dress code.  It doesn't apply
		to good-looking men who save my
		life.

					(CONTINUED)


	23. 


28	CONTINUED:	28

				CLARK
		Good, cause these are the only
		clothes I've got.

				TONI
		Maybe we can change that.

				CLARK
		Look, I didn't come here for a
		handout.  You said you had a job
		for me.

				TONI
		Bartender, right?  Mr...

				CLARK
		King, Charles King.

				TONI
			(liking it)
		Charlie.  You saved my life last
		night.

				CLARK
		It was worth saving.

				TONI
		Are you always that good in a
		crisis?

				CLARK
		Try me.

				TONI
		I may do just that.  But for now
		we'll start with bartending.

				CLARK
		You're the boss.

				TONI
		Good.  I need that kind of loyalty
		around here.  It seems to be in
		short supply.  Keep your eyes and
		ears open and we'll see about
		moving you up.

	Meanwhile, Lou has come back.

				LOU
		Don't mean to bother you but we got
		a small problem.  Delilah just
		quit.  Says she's too scared of the
		Toasters to come back here.

					(CONTINUED)


	24. 


28	CONTINUED:  2	28

				TONI
			(to Clark)
		See what I mean?  No loyalty.
			(to Lou)
		Does she have a contract?

				LOU
		Yeah, of course.

				TONI
		Good.  Sue the sequins off her and
		get another singer.

				LOU
		Done.

	Lou leaves.

				CLARK
		When do I start?

				TONI
		As soon as you get yourself some
		new clothes.

	She peels off five hundred dollar bills.

				TONI
			(continuing)
		Welcome to the good life.


29	CLOSE ON A PAIR OF BLACK SWINGING DOORS	29

	... as they are pushed open again, leading us back into
	the club later that night.  The band on stage is playing.
	Lois, casually dressed but her hair perfectly coiffed and
	her face made-up walks across the room to the bar.  She
	addresses the bartender who is turned away from her.

				LOIS
		Soda, please.

	Clark turns around and smiles.  He now wears a tuxedo.

				CLARK
		coming right up.

	Lois, shocked to see him, lifts the bar rail and moves
	beside him.

				LOIS
		What are you doing here?

					(CONTINUED)


	25. 


29	CONTINUED:	29

				CLARK
		My job.  You're looking at the
		Metro Club's newest bartender.
		Like my tux?  It's Italian.

				LOIS
		What did you do, fly to Rome?  I've
		been looking for you all day.

	Clark just smiles.  Toni comes up to the bar.

				TONI
		Charlie!

				LOIS
		Charlie?

				TONI
		I hardly recognized you.

				LOIS
			(under her breath)
		Join the club.

				CLARK
			(re Lois)
		Just getting to know the help.

				TONI
			(sizing Lois up)
		Not too well, I hope.

				CLARK
		Beat  it, kid.  I gotta go to work.

	Clark pats her on the rear, a replay of Johnny's action.
	Lois gives him the evil eye and has no choice but to
	leave.  Clark pours Toni a drink at SUPER SPEED and
	places it in front of her.

				TONI
			(startled)
		I've had one better but I've never
		had one faster,

				CLARK
		Sweet vermouth on the rocks with a
		twist?

				TONI
			(smiling)
		How did you know?

				CLARK
		I asked.

					(CONTINUED)


	26. 


29	CONTINUED:	29

				TONI
		Looking out for my best interests?

				CLARK
		That's what I'm here for.

				TONI
		I think I like that.  Lou said you
		were having problems with the ice
		maker.

				CLARK
		No. No problems.


30	CLOSE ON AN ICE MAKER	30

	... broken, no ice in sight.  PAN OVER to the sink where
	Clark fills an ice tray.  Clark leans down close and, with
	one SUPER COLD breath, freezes the tray.  He pops the
	ice out and drops it into some glasses.  He grabs a nearby
	newspaper and goes back to Toni.

				CLARK
		Did you read about the Toaster's
		latest stunt?  Burned a police
		station to the ground about a
		couple of blocks from here.

				TONI
			(shaking her head)
		Bad for business.  They're out of
		control.  They've got to be
		stopped.

				CLARK
		What are you doing about it?

	Toni looks at him suspiciously.

				CLARK
		Not that it's any of my business.
		I just don't like anything
		dangerous getting too close to you.

				TONI
		That's quite a line you've got.

				CLARK
		I mean every word.

	She spots someone at the door.

					(CONTINUED)

	27. 


30	CONTINUED:	30

				TONI
		We'll talk some more about this
		later.  Right now, just stay here
		and look handsome.  I've got some
		business to discuss.

	Clark watches as Toni goes over to the-door and greets LEX
	LEATHER.  Clark quickly turns away so that Leather doesn't
	notice him.  He watches through the bar mirror as Toni
	leads him to a center table and they sit down.  He
	activates his SUPER HEARING and tries to listen to their
	conversation, but just as he begins to hear, a LOUD
	DRUMROLL nearly pops his eyes out of his head.  Apparently
	Super Hearing amplifies everything.

				ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
		Ladies and Gentlemen, the Metro
		Club proudly presents Miss Lola
		Dane.

	A SPOTLIGHT hits the curtain revealing the bare back of a
	remarkably well-curved woman in a painted-on evening
	dress.  We hear the opening saxophone notes of "I've Got a
	Crush on You."  Clark and Lex look closely at the singer
	from opposite sides of the room.  There's something
	awfully familiar about her.  Both of-their jaws
	figuratively drop at the same time as she turns around and
	begins to sing...

				LOIS
		'I've got a crush on you -- Sweetie
		Pie -- All the day and night
		time -- Hear me sigh -- The world
		will pardon my mush -- But I have
		got a crush on you.'

	It's a Lois we've never seen before.  Sexy.  Sultry.
	Seductive.  Clark is stunned.  Lex is appreciative.  Lois
	continues to sing as Toni and Lex continue to talk in
	whispers.

31	LOIS	31

	... almost misses a beat when she sees Lex Luthor staring
	up at her, smiling.  Uncertain about her cover now, she
	can do nothing but keep singing.  She looks for...


32	CLARK	32

	... who shares her worry but can't do anything about it.
	He looks back to Lex who can't seem to take his eyes off
	Lois.  Is he going to turn her in?


	28. 


33	ANOTHER ANGLE	33

	... as Lois finishes her song.  Lex takes the rose out of
	his lapel and tosses it to her on stage.  She catches it
	nervously while he applauds her.

				LUTHOR
		Brava!

	The spotlight goes out and the curtain goes down on her.
	She turns around, walks past the chorus girls who are
	ready for another number and into the...


34	BACKSTAGE HALLWAY	34

	... where Clark intercepts her.

				CLARK
		Lois --

	She puts her fingers up to her lips, looks around, then
	drags Clark into...


35	THE SUPPLY CLOSET	35

	... where they continue the conversation in whispers.

				CLARK
		Did you see him?

				LOIS
		Of course I saw him.

				CLARK
		Get out of here now.  Don't even
		stop to get your things.

				LOIS
		Clark, Lex Luthor is a friend of
		mine.  He would never do anything
		to hurt me and he's way too smart
		to let anything slip.

				CLARK
		I don't trust him.  What's he doing
		here anyway?

				LOIS
		I'll ask him next time I see him.

	Clark notices the bullet holes in the wall.  He looks
	through one.

				CLARK
		So this is how you spied on the
		meetings.

					(CONTINUED)


	29. 


35	CONTINUED:	35

				LOIS
		If you're a good boy maybe I'll
		teach you some more of my tricks,
		but right now I've got to get ready
		for my next number.

	Lois goes to open the door but before she can it flies
	open, revealing Toni standing there.

				TONI
		Interesting place for a bartender.
		Run out of olives?

	Clark must think fast.  He turns to Toni, holding Lois by
	her arm.

				CLARK
		Here she is.  Your leak.  Lois
		Lane, reporter for the Daily
		Planet.

	Lois turns to Clark in fury, but holds her tongue.  A
	scary moment ensues before Toni responds.

				TONI
		Guess I'll have to find another
		singer.
			(to Clark)
		Good work.

				CLARK
			(nodding)
		What do you want me to do with her?


					CUT TO:



	A gas flame ignites with a whoosh underneath a kettle on
	the stove.  Clark is making tea when the door bangs open
	and Lois enters, still wearing her garbage-stained evening
	dress.

				LOIS
		You rotten, back stabbing piece of
		slime.  You know, some people might
		be fooled by that innocent, boyish
		exterior but not me, not anymore.

				CLARK
		Tea, Lois?  It's a calming herbal
		blend.  I learned it from a
		medicine man in Fiji.  The secret
		is the fresh mint.

				LOIS
		I don't suppose you care but you've
		completely blown the story.

				CLARK
		By the way, I don't think I told
		you but I really liked your song.

				LOIS
			(screeching)
		What?!

				CLARK
		You have a very pleasant voice.
		Most of the time.

				LOIS
		Clark, I don't know what you think
		you're doing...

				CLARK
		You know, sometimes, on a team, the
		person carrying the ball gets
		hemmed in and she has to hand off
		to another member of the team who's
		in a better position to score.

	There is a knock at the door.  Clark X-RAYS through.  To
	Clark's surprise, it's Toni, carrying a grocery bag.

				LOIS
		Who's that?

				CLARK
		I guess... my dinner date.

					(CONTINUED)


	32. 


37  CONTINUED:	37

				LOIS
		Oh, I get it.  You don't need to
		draw me a diagram.

				CLARK
		Lois...

				LOIS
		I cuddle up to three-day-old fish
		heads while you play footsie with
		the mafia princess.

	Another knock.

				CLARK
		Oh, I get it.  You're jealous.

				LOIS
		Jealous?  Are you out of your mind?

				CLARK
		Lois, she can't see you here.
		You've got to hide.

				LOIS
		But --

	He pushes her behind the wall that masks the circular
	staircase.

				CLARK
		I'll find some way to distract her
		and then you sneak out.

	Even though she's still angry, Lois acquiesces.  Clark
	moves over to the door and opens it to admit Toni.

				TONI
		Once again I'm in your debt.  I
		thought I'd pay you back with a
		home cooked meal.  How does lasagna
		sound?

				CLARK
		Delicious.

38	ANGLE ON LOIS	38

	... rolling her eyes.

				LOIS
			(mouthing)
		Delicious.


	33. 


39	BACK TO CLARK AND TONI	39

	... as he guides her toward the kitchen and away from Lois.

				TONI
			(looking around)
		Nice place.

				CLARK
		it belongs to a friend of mine.  He
		lets me use it whenever I'm in
		Metropolis.
			(re groceries)
		You know, you don't really have to
		do this.

				TONI
		I know.  I want to.

				CLARK
		Do you always get what you want?

				TONI
		Usually.  How about you?

				CLARK
		Let's see.

	He leans in and kisses her, turning her head away from the
	door.  He motions with his hand for Lois to get out.  She
	stares at them for a beat, then creeps out, closing the
	door soundlessly behind her.  Clark ends the kiss.  Toni
	is pleasantly surprised.

				TONI
		You don't waste any time, do you?

				CLARK
		Not if I can help it.
			(beat)
		You said something about lasagna?

	She smiles.

					CUT TO:


	Lois enters, tired, angry and disgusted.  She immediately
	starts to take off her garbage-stained clothes, dropping
	them on the floor behind her as she heads across the room.

				LOIS
		Jealous?  Ha!

					(CONTINUED)


	34. 


40	CONTINUED:	40

	She disappears into the bedroom.  A few moments later she
	comes back out in a schlumpy bathrobe, her hair up in an
	ugly scrunchy.  She heads for the freezer.

				LOIS
			(continuing)
		Like I really care.

	She takes out a gallon of Rocky Road and begins to shovel
	it down right out of the carton.  A wave of emotion hits
	her as she realizes this may be the case.

				LOIS
			(continuing)
		I am jealous.

	There is a knock at the door.  She answers it, spoon in
	her mouth, revealing Lex Luthor.

				LUTHOR
		Let's do it.

				LOIS
			(through the spoon)
		I beg your pardon?

				LUTHOR
		A song request.
			(singing)
		'Let's do it.  Let's fall in love.'

	The musical question hangs in the air.

				LOIS
		I think my singing days are over.

				LUTHOR
		But why?  You were magnificent.

				LOIS
			(embarrassed)
		It was just an act.

				LUTHOR
		I prefer to think it was the real
		you.  Passionate.  Sultry.
		Seductive.
			(beat)
		Got an extra spoon?

				LOIS
		Oh. Come in.

	Lois quickly bends to start picking up the clothes.  She
	absently stuffs it all into the freezer along with the ice
	cream.

					(CONTINUED)


	35. 


40	CONTINUED:  2	40

				LUTHOR
		This is exactly how I pictured your
		apartment.

				LOIS
		I'm, uh... thinking of remodeling.
			(beat)
		Thanks for not blowing my cover.

				LUTHOR
		That's what friends are for.
		Tonight you look like you could use
		one.

				LOIS
		Lex, what were you doing at the
		club?

				LUTHOR
		Meeting with the new leader of the
		Metro gang.
			(beat)
		She called me.  According to her,
		we have similar interests in the
		Riverview district.

				LOIS
		I find that hard to believe.

				LUTHOR
		So do I.  She talks a good line:
		slum clearance, uplifting the
		neighborhood, micromanagement,
		growth and prosperity.

				LOIS
		And you believe her?

				LUTHOR
		Not for a minute.  In fact, I think
		the whole thing was designed to get
		me to slow down my own plans for
		reviving the area.
			(beat)
		She even suggested a partnership of
		sorts.

				LOIS
		And what are you doing here?

				LUTHOR
		I came to warn you.  I think Toni's
		hiding something.

				LOIS
		What?

					(CONTINUED)


	36. 


40	CONTINUED:  3	40

				LUTHOR
		I wish I knew.  I only know that if
		I were a smart reporter looking for
		answers, I wouldn't bother to look
		any further for the source of all 
		the problems in Riverview than Toni
		Taylor.

				LOIS
		Thanks for the tip.  I guess I owe
		you one.

				LUTHOR
		Don't think I won't try to collect.
		Good night, Lois.

	He kisses her on the cheek, moves to the door and exits as
	we...

					CUT TO:


	Eerie and dark. Toni enters. One by one, each of the
	Toasters appears, stepping out of different hiding places.
	They hold their weapons and they have her surrounded.
	Meanwhile, Lois has entered through the back and is
	watching, hidden from view by some blackened crates.

				TONI
		Is this really necessary?

	After a beat, Toaster #1 takes off his mask.

				TOASTER #1
		Did you bring the money?

	Toni opens the briefcase.

				TONI
		One hundred thousand.

				TOASTER #1
			(angry)
		You said two.

				TONI
		Considering how badly you botched
		the hit on my brother, you're lucky
		I'm even here. Do you realize I
		could've been killed?

					(CONTINUED)


	39. 


44	CONTINUED:	44

				TOASTER #1
		Yeah, that would've been a real
		shame.

	Lois has now maneuvered herself closer to the action when
	she accidentally trips over a dangling cord.  A rusted,
	old toaster falls off the crate next to her.  She catches
	it before it crashes to the floor and reveals her
	position.

				TONI
			(continuing)
		Just don't forget who's running the
		show.  The fires were supposed to 
		stop as soon as I took over.  What 
		do you think you've been doing?

				TOASTER #I
		Having fun.

				TONI
		Well, the fun stops now.
			(holding out her hand)
		Give me those things.

	He grabs the briefcase from her instead.

				TOASTER #1
		I don't think so.  We've kind of
		decided to hold on to them.

				TONI
		Listen punk --

				TOASTER #1
		No, you listen for a change.  You
		and the Metros, you're nothin'.  We 
		could wipe you out by just pullin' 
		a trigger.

				TONI
		I made you!

				TOASTER #1
		Yeah, and we're real grateful.
			(leveling his weapon)
		Take her.

	Toni struggles, but it's useless.  Two of the Toasters
	grab her and begin to wrap her wrists with tape.
	Meanwhile...


45	LOIS	45

	... has moved even closer, avid to hear every word.


	40. 


46	BACK TO TONI AND THE TOASTERS	46

				TONI
		Four of you against the Metros?
		You don't have a chance.

				TOASTER #1
		Why just four?  Why not forty?  Or 
		four hundred.  Recruiting's a snap.
		Plenty of guys out there love to 
		see things burn.

				TONI
		You don't have the weapons for
		them.

				TOASTER #1
		Not yet, but we'll figure out how
		to make more.  We're not as dumb as
		you think.

	They hear a CRASH from behind the crates.  Toasters #2 and
	#3 rush to find out what caused it.  They search the area
	where Lois was just a few seconds ago, their weapons drawn
	and ready.  They find nothing but a rolling bottle which
	has fallen to the ground.  They bring it back to Toaster
	#1

				TOASTER #1
		Anything?

	The others shake their head.

				TOASTER #1
		You wouldn't believe how big the
		rats get around here.

				TONI
		Oh I believe it.
			(beat)
		What now?  What about me?

				TOASTER #1
		Well, we've got a little bar-b-que
		planned for tomorrow.  We thought
		we'd start with the wharf and work
		our way back to the Metro club.
		When we're done with that, we'll
		get back to you.  If the rats
		haven't gotten you first.
			(nodding to #2)
		Keep an eye on her.

	They all leave except for Toaster #2, who settles against
	a crate for.the first watch.  We PAN up above him, on top
	of some crates that almost reach the ceiling.  Squeezed
	into the small space is Lois, looking terrified.

46	CONTINUED:	46

	We PAN over to discover the cause of her worry, a large,
	beady-eyed rodent who has settled in to become her 
	roommate for the night.  Off Lois, stuck between a rat and
	a hard place, we...

					FADE OUT.

                                 END ACT THREE



	42. 

                                    ACT FOUR


	Sun streams through holes in the ceiling revealing a
	sleeping Lois, still on top of the crates, her furry
	roommate nowhere to be found.  She rolls over in her sleep
	and her hand dangles over the edge directly above the head
	of Toaster #2 who still sits watch.


48	CLOSE ON LOIS	48

 	Her eyes pop open at the sound of Toaster #2's voice.

				TOASTER #2
		All right, I see you and I'm gonna
		get you before you cause any more
		trouble.  Your little tail is mine.

	She's awake now, adrenaline pumping. She peaks over the
	crate expecting to meet her demise but instead sees
	Toaster #2 aiming at the rat with his weapon. Toni is
 	still tied, still asleep. Lois looks around, takes her
 	opportunity, climbs down and rushes out the way she came
 	in.



 	Lois, panting with exertion, stands and waits impatiently
 	for Clark to open the door.  Yawning, wearing athletic
 	shorts and a T-shirt, he does.  Immediately she pushes
 	inside.

				CLARK
 		Lois?  What's up?

				LOIS
		Tough night, Clark?
			(beat)
		Where's the phone?

	Clark points, follows her to it. Dust and ashes still
 	cling to Lois' clothes. Clark begins to brush her off.

				CLARK
		You know, I thought I was hard on
		clothing.

	 Lois interrupts her dialing to bat his hand away.

				LOIS
			(to Clark)
		Would you stop that?
			(into phone)
		Get me whoever's in charge of your
		Arson Investigations unit.  No, I
		won't hold.  I said...

	She's on hold.

				CLARK
			(fully alert now)
		What's happened?  Where were you?

				LOIS
		Sleeping with a rat, how about you?

				CLARK
		Lois, Toni left here around ten.

				LOIS
		I know.
			(into phone)
		Yes, I'm holding.  No, don't...

				CLARK
		How do you know?

				LOIS
		Because I followed her.  Prepare
		yourself for a shock, Clark.  Toni
		is behind the Toasters.  Was behind
		the Toasters, actually.  Now
		they've got her captive.

				CLARK
		What?

				LOIS
		The Toasters are out of control and
		planning to burn Riverview to the
		ground, starting from the wharf and
		moving inward.  Unless, that is...
			(voice rising)
		... someone picks up the rotten
		line!

	Now, in the b.g., we hear SIRENS, lots of them.  Clark
	rushes to the window and looks out.  With his TELESCOPIC
	VISION he sees flames rising over the city.

				CLARK
		Lois, put down the phone.
			(off her look)
		You won't get through.

					(CONTINUED)


	44. 


49	CONTINUED:  2	49

	She sees the flames, hangs up.

				LOIS
		I'm going to the police station.
		They need to know what they're up
		against. I'll meet you back at the
		Planet.

	She pauses on her way out for a last look at the flames.

				LOIS
			(continuing)
		Superman, I hope you're out there.

	She exits. Clark looks at the flames, pulls off his
	shirt.

					CUT TO:


	We HEAR a CLAP OF THUNDER in the near distance.  Toni
	still struggles helplessly with her bonds.  Clark enters,
	moves to her side and releases her.

				TONI
		How did you find me?

				CLARK
		I had a tip.

				TONI
		We've got to get out of here before
		the Toasters come back.

				CLARK
		Superman took care of them.

				TONI
		Looks like you came through for me.

				CLARK
		Looks like you let me down.

	We HEAR the sound of RAIN beginning to pour down outside.
	Toni stares at him a moment, then lowers her eyes.

				TONI
		I had to create a situation that
		would allow me to take over the 
		Metros.  There was no other way.

				CLARK
		There's always another way.

				TONI
		Charlie, please --

				CLARK
		My name's not Charlie.  It's Clark
		Kent.  I work at the Daily Planet.

	As the reality sinks in...

				TONI
		I guess both of us were hiding the
		truth.  What happens now?

	We HEAR SIRENS pulling up outside the building.

					(CONTINUED)

	47. 


60	CONTINUED:	60

				CLARK
		I think you know.

				TONI
		Can I talk you out of it?
			(seeing his face)
		I guess not.
			(beat)
		I'll miss you, Charlie.

				CLARK
		I'll miss you too, Toni.

					CUT TO:



	Lex is on the phone, standing next to his gleaming model
	of LexHarbor.  Rain still engulfs the city behind him.

				LUTHOR
			(into phone)
		Every parcel on the list?
		Excellent.  Nothing like a little
		firestorm to lower prices on real
		estate.  Let's move directly to
		phase two.  I'd like to break
		ground on LexHarbor sometime next
		month.
			(listening)
		No, I wouldn't worry about that.
		Toni Taylor and I have an
		arrangement.  Things haven't worked
		out exactly the way she hoped,
		but she won't spend much time
		incarcerated.  When she gets out,
		she knows I'll be properly grateful
		for her silence.
			(beat)
		Destroy them.  Plans, too.  Should
		we ever need to revive the Toaster
		technology, it'll be easy enough.
			(beat; smiling)
		I know you will.  That's what I pay 
		you for.

	He hangs up, looks at the model, already looking into the
	future, envisioning the reality.

					CUT TO:


	Lois is at her desk with Perry and Jimmy.

				PERRY
		You and Kent got yourselves another
		headline.  All the risks, all the
		danger, it was worth it all.

				JIMMY
		it was worth it all just to see
		Lois in that little cocktail
		waitress number.

	Lois throws a pencil at him and he takes the hint and
	leaves.

				PERRY
			(confidentially)
		Speaking of numbers, tell me the
		truth, Lois.  How'd it feel to be
		on stage?

				LOIS
		well, it was pretty exciting,
		Chief.  But I don't think I could
		handle a career in show biz.

				PERRY
		You know, in March of 1955, The
		King auditioned for Aurthur
		Godfrey's Talent Scouts.  It was 
		his first trip to New York and his
		first airplane flight.

				LOIS
		What happened?

				PERRY
		He was rejected.

				LOIS
		So, what are you trying to tell me?
		That I should consider giving it
		another try?

				PERRY
		Hell, no.  I think you should stick
		with your first instinct.

	Perry leaves as Clark comes in.

				LOIS
		Where have you been?  I'm on page
		six.

				CLARK
		Save some room for the wrap-up on
		Toni Taylor.  I've just been saying
		goodbye.

62	CONTINUED:  2	62

				LOIS
		A touching farewell I suppose?

				CLARK
		She wasn't all bad.

				LOIS
		No one's all bad, Clark.  Or all
		good.  Except Superman.

				CLARK
		Naturally.

				LOIS
		Superman, for example, wouldn't
		have tried to cut me out of a story
		by ratting me out to the opposing
		team.  Good thing I managed to get
		back in the game on my own and
		score the winning touchdown.

				CLARK
		Sometimes the quarterback has to
		fake a throw to his primary
		receiver in order to free up his
		secondary target.

				LOIS
		I'm getting pretty tired of
		fumbling around with these stupid
		football teamwork analogies.

				CLARK
		Me, too.

				LOIS
		Let's drop them then, okay?

				CLARK
		No problem.  Let's pass.

	She gives him a dirty look.

				CLARK
			(continuing)
		Okay, so fess up.  You really
		weren't the slightest bit jealous
		of me and Toni Taylor?

				LOIS
		You'd like to think that, wouldn't
		you?  Me, home alone, in a schlumpy
		bathrobe, crying into a tub of
		Rocky Road.
