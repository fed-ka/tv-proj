      CHARLIE -- who probably hasn t slept all night -- sitting on 
    an upper tier cave with his GUITAR, struggling to find chords 
      that once came easily.  He s sweaty, twitchy...  Even if we 
      have no idea that Charlie s GOING COLD TURKEY -- we quickly 
      realize that this guy is barely keeping it together.

                                  LOCKE (O.S.)
                    Charlie--

      Charlie squints down towards the mouth of the cave and sees 
      LOCKE, silhouetted by the early morning light.

                                  LOCKE (cont d)*
                    How about you and I go for a walk?

                                  CHARLIE
                    Uh, N-no thanks, Locke.  Think I ll *
                    stay in today.*

    He goes back to his guitar, but stops when he sees Locke,  *
      moving closer, looking hard at him -*

                                  LOCKE
                    C mon.  The fresh air will do you *
                    good.*

    Not exactly a question anymore.  ON CHARLIE - After a moment, 
    he nods, puts down his guitar and rises to join him...


      Someone kneeling, head bowed, penitent before a priest --

                                    CHARLIE
                    It s been a week since my last 
                      confession.

      He lifts his head and we recognize that this CLEAN-CUT GUY IN 
      TAILORED CLOTHES is CHARLIE, five years younger.  GONE is the 
      nail polish, the grungy clothes.  He hesitates...

                                  PRIEST
                    Go ahead, my son.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Last night, I had... physical... *
                      relations... with a girl I... I 
                    didn t even know.

                                  PRIEST
                    I see.  Anything else?

                                  CHARLIE
                    Yeah.  Then, uh... right after that 
                    I had... y know... relations with 
                    another girl.*

                                  PRIEST
                    Two girls.  Well, that s--

                                  CHARLIE
                    And then... I watched while they 
                    had... relations with each other.

      SILENCE.  And we can read on Charlie s face that this ISN T a 
      joke -- that he is TRULY CONFLICTED.  At war with himself.

                                  PRIEST
                    I, uh... You... Hmmm...

                                    CHARLIE
                    See, it s my band, Father.  Drive 
                    Shaft... We ve been playing this *
                    club in Manchester and... well, *
                    we re starting to get some real 
                    heat... A following, like... And *
                    these girls... they... well... *
                    There s some serious temptations 
                    that come with the territory.  If 
                    you know what I mean.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                                6.
      (CONT'D):44


                                  PRIEST
                    Yes, well...  We all have our 
                      temptations, but giving in to them, *
                    that s your choice.  I know it s *
                      difficult, but find strength in 
                    your faith.  Your family...
                          (anxious to be done)
                    Say five Our Fathers and two Hail 
                    Marys and you will be absolved.

      The slot SLIDES SHUT.  OFF Charlie, crossing himself, a 
      little taken aback by the abruptness --


      As Charlie emerges from the confessional...

                                  IAN (O.S.)
                    And the meek shall inherit the 
                    earth.

      Charlie glances up to see, in a pew by the aisle...*

      IAN, a  MU$IC $LUT  T-shirt and ripped jeans.  (His look 
      should say OASIS, THE VERVE -- NOT HEAVY METAL.)  A few years 
      older than Charlie, he s a guy you can t take your eyes off.  
      Good-looking, charismatic.  His motorcycle boots draped over 
      the pew in front of him.

                                  CHARLIE
                          (mortified, sotto)
                    Ian -- You re in a church!  Get 
                    your sodden boots off there.

      Ian does so as Charlie wipes the pew with his jacket sleeve. *

                                  IAN
                    Relax, Choir Boy.  I bring tidings *
                    of great joy...*

      He flashes a smile as he holds up a BUSINESS LETTER --

                                  IAN (cont d)
                    We ve just been signed to a 
                    recording contract.  You re gonna 
                    be a rock god.

      And as the news LANDS ON Charlie, we BLAST BACK OUT TO --






                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                                7.




      ON CHARLIE - or rather, HIS REFLECTION in the pool, as he 
      stares at his pale, haggard face.  His hands suddenly dive 
      in, obliterating his reflected image...

      NEW ANGLE as Charlie sits at the pool s edge, splashes water  *
      on his face.  In Korean:*

                                  JIN (O.S.)
                    Hey!  You!

      Charlie squints up to see JIN, looking down on him from the 
      nook on which he and Sun have settled.  SUN stops laying out  *
      their belongings to observe her husband shouting at Charlie.

                                  JIN (cont d)
                    That water is for drinking!

      ON CHARLIE, he waves, no idea what Jin s saying...

                                  CHARLIE
                    Morning.

      JIN, disgusted, shakes his head and returns to his wife.  As 
      Charlie shakily gets to his feet, he hears:

                                  HURLEY (O.S.)
                    Jack... Dude... What s in these 
                    things -- cinder blocks?

      ON HURLEY, entering the caves, struggling to carry two large 
      suitcases.  With him is JACK, the leather bag over his 
      shoulder, cradling another suitcase, lying flat in his arms.

                                  JACK
                    Packed anything I thought d be 
                    useful here... without leaving the 
                    others empty-handed.

      Exhausted, Hurley puts his suitcases down as CHARLIE crosses  *
      over to them...*

                                  CHARLIE
                    Hey.  Need a hand?

                                  JACK
                    No thanks.  I think we re good.

                                  CHARLIE
                    I don t mind.  Used to lug around 
                    my band s equipment back in the



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              12.
      (CONT'D):99


                                  CHARLIE (cont d)
                    day.  Before we had roadies.
                          (re:  Jack s suitcases)
                    Here, lemme get that --

                                  JACK
                    Charlie.  No.  The zipper s--

      Charlie grabs the handle of the suitcase and takes it from 
      Jack -- but as he does, the lid FLOPS OPEN and the contents 
      spill out onto the ground.

                                  JACK (cont d)
                      ...broken.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Aw, hell.  Sorry... I was just 
                    trying to--

                                  JACK
                    Help.  I know.  It s okay.
                          (to Hurley)
                    Hurley, why don t we grab those 
                    last couple of bags.

                                  HURLEY
                            (unthrilled)
                    Oh, could we?

      As Jack and Hurley move away, Jack drops the leather shoulder  *
      bag on the ground, near Charlie, who continues retrieving the 
      fallen items until he catches sight of...

      HIS POV - THE LEATHER BAG, open, and piled on top are 
      numerous PRESCRIPTION BOTTLES.

      ON CHARLIE, frozen for a moment as his mind reels.  He looks 
      in the direction Jack and Hurley headed, then back behind  *
      him.  Satisfied the coast is clear, he moves to the leather  *
      bag and rummages through it, checking the labels as he goes.   *
      He brings up a bottle and evidently likes what he reads when: *

                                  JACK (O.S.)
                    What are you doing?

      Charlie finds Jack standing over him.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Oh.  Um... I ve got a bit of a 
                    headache.  So, I thought...

      Jack takes the bottle from Charlie, and checks the label.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              13.
      (CONT'D): (2)99


                                  JACK
                    Valium?

                                  CHARLIE
                      Couldn t... find any aspirin.

      Jack tosses the bottle back into the bag and zips it closed. *

                                  JACK
                    It s not self-serve, Charlie.  This *
                    medicine may have to last us 
                    awhile.  Gotta save it for things *
                    more serious than a headache...*

                                    CHARLIE
                    Yeah.  Yeah... You re right.

      And now Jack notices Charlie s SHAKY STATE for the first 
      time.  Steps closer to him.

                                  JACK
                    You okay?  You re looking a little--

      Charlie turns away, not wanting Jack to examine him, and goes 
      back to picking up the fallen contents.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Told you.  Just a headache.*

                                  JACK
                    Leave it.  Get some water.  Maybe 
                    you re dehydrated...

                                    CHARLIE
                          (continuing the clean-up)
                    Just want to be useful --

      Jack squats next to Charlie and grabs his arm.

                                  JACK
                          (firmly)
                    Charlie, I got it.  We don t need 
                    you right now.  Go take care of 
                    yourself, man.

      Charlie looks at Jack, stung, as Jack takes over.  Charlie 
      stands up, feeling dismissed, like a child, as he watches 
      Jack clean up his mess.  And as we go TIGHT ON CHARLIE... *

                                  IAN (PRE-LAP)
                    C mon, Charlie-boy... We can t do 
                    this without you...



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              14.




      We re on Charlie, moments after we left him, sitting in the  *
      front pew, head in hands, holding the business letter.  Ian s  *
      sitting on the altar now, addressing him...*

                                  IAN
                    Face it...  You re the heart and 
                    soul of the band.  You are bloody 
                    Drive Shaft.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Watch the language.

                                  IAN
                          (hopping off the altar)
                    Sod that.  This is our shot at the 
                    big-time.  What s the problem?

                                    CHARLIE
                    I dunno... I just...
                          (standing)
                    I want to keep things the way they *
                    are.  Playing the pubs.  It s *
                    enough for me.*

      He heads down the aisle.  Ian at his heels...*

                                  IAN
                    Yeah, fine for you.  You re the 
                    smart one.  Be anything you want.  
                    It s your songs that got us signed.  
                    I m just the clown with the pretty 
                    face that sings  em.  Now you wanna 
                    take away my chance to be somebody.

      They stop near the back of the sanctuary, by a CISTERN filled 
      with holy water, as Charlie turns back to him.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Ian, it s not about you.  It s...
                          (difficult to admit)
                    Look, I love the band, but... It s *
                    not who I am.*
                          (beat)
                      Sometimes... I get lost in it.*

      Ian looks at him a moment, registering Charlie s concern.






                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              15.
      (CONT'D):1010


                                  IAN
                    Won t happen.   Cause we ll be *
                    there looking out for each other.  *
                    What brothers do, right?*

      As Charlie considers this, Ian splashes him with holy water 
      from the cistern.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Ian --
                          (getting splashed again)
                    Stop that, you lunatic.

                                  IAN
                    Now you sound like Mum.

      Charlie can t help but smile at that.  After a moment...

                                  CHARLIE
                    Just promise me... If things... get *
                    too crazy... No matter what... If I *
                    say we re done... We walk away.

                                  IAN
                    We walk away.

                                  CHARLIE
                    You swear it.

                                  IAN
                          (pledging)
                    You re the rock god, baby brother.

      OFF CHARLIE, as he nods, sealing their pact...

      WIDEN to see she s addressing a lounging SAWYER, his battered  *

                                  SAWYER

      Sawyer studies Kate.  Smiles.

                                  SAWYER
                    We are testy, aren t we?  Still 
                    upset about your little breakup?

                          (just plain mean)
                    Cause now there s nothing for him

      And Kate just looks at him.  Then speaks to him evenly --

                    God, it must be so exhausting...*

                    Boy, you sure got me pegged.

                                  KATE
                    I get it now.  It all makes sense.  
                    You don t want to get off this

      Sawyer just sits there for a MOMENT.  Then he reaches into 
      his bag again and brings out a LAPTOP.  He slides the BATTERY 
      out, TOSSES it to her --

                                  SAWYER
                    All you had to do was say please.

      Kate stares at him a beat, then turns and goes.  ON SAWYER,  *
      watching her, his glib smirk melting away for just a second, 
      showing he might just ve been STUNG...


      CHARLIE, sitting against a wall.  Jonesing and a bit hyper.

                                  HURLEY (O.S.)
                    Hey.  Dude.  This yours?

      Charlie sees Hurley standing over him, holding his guitar.  
      Charlie s pleased to have some engagement, anxious to talk.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Yeah.  Probably wondering  cause *
                    I m known for playing bass in Drive *
                    Shaft.  S only  cause we could *
                    never find a decent bass player...*
                          (getting to his feet)
                    Wrote a bunch of songs with that 
                    guitar.   You All Everybody.    *
                    That was mine.  Got the idea from --

                                  HURLEY
                    Listen, man, Jack just wants you to *
                    find another place for this thing.  
                    He s moving supplies and says it s 
                    in the way.

      He hands him the guitar and walks out.  PUSH IN ON CHARLIE,  *
      feeling foolish.  Then, eyes narrowing in anger, he moves off  *
      frame...


      ON JACK, scrutinizing a naturally formed pillar near the 
      center of the cave.  He places his hand against it, and with 
      that, a small stream of dirt and pebbles cascades down the  *
      side of the pillar.  As Jack takes that in, he hears:

                                    CHARLIE (O.S.)
                    You know, most people look up to *
                    me.  Respect me --*

      Jack turns to find Charlie converging on him.

                        JACKCHARLIE
      Charlie -- ?-- And you treat me like a 
                                                  bloody child, like some 
                                                    useless joke --
      -- What are you talking --
                                                  -- I m not good enough to 
                                                  help.  Right?  No.  No, I m 
                                                  just in the way --

      Jack can see that Charlie is PALE, SWEATING -- in a bad 
      fucking way.  Concerned --

                                  JACK
                    You okay, man?  C mon, sit down.  
                    Let me take a look at you --

                      CHARLIEJACK
      -- Right.  You ll look out 
      for me.  We look out for each 
      other... Well, stuff that ---- Charlie, calm down.  
                                                  You re not yourself --

                                    CHARLIE
                    You don t know me!  I m a bloody 
                    rock god!!


      PANNING OFF HURLEY filling up his water bottle, we find...

      JIN, by the pool s edge, sporting the detached handcuff 
      bracelet, dabbing the raw skin around it with a rag.  SUN  *
      comes over, wearing a low-cut tank top, and kneels beside 
      him.  Jin doesn t look up at her.  The following s subtitled:

                                  SUN
                    You should have the doctor look at 
                    your wrist.

                                  JIN*
                    It s fine.  It will heal --*

      As he looks up at her, he sees her attire for the first time.

                                  JIN (cont d)
                    What are you wearing?  It s 
                    indecent.  Cover yourself!

      Sun leans back and eyes him squarely.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              19.

                                  SUN
                    It s too hot.

      Before Jin, stunned at her defiance, can respond, they both 
      react to a DISTANT RUMBLE and notice...

      The water in the pool RIPPLING.

      AND GRRRRRBOOOOOM!  The RUMBLE GROWS LOUDER and the Earth 
      shakes.  PUSH IN on HURLEY as he sees it first...

                                  HURLEY
                    Aw, no...

      ANGLE ON CAVE ENTRANCE - A THICK CLOUD OF DUST bursting from 
      it.  HANDHELD -- CHOATIC --*

      Hurley, Jin and Sun hurry over -- DUST SWIRLING EVERYWHERE as 
      they find... CHARLIE, choking and coughing, on the ground by  *
      what used to be the cave entrance, now sealed by rock and 
      earth.

                                  HURLEY (cont d)
                    Charlie!  Where s Jack?
                          (no answer)
                    WHERE S JACK?

    A coughing Charlie lifts his arm AND POINTS AT THE CAVE-IN.  
      And OFF HURLEY S look of dread...

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK: *

                                        ACT TWO


      ON CHARLIE, where we left him.  SHELL-SHOCKED.  As we hear:

                                  HURLEY (O.S.)
                    JACK!! --

      CUT WIDE to see HURLEY, standing at the SEALED CAVE ENTRANCE.  
      Jin and Sun are there, too.  Already pulling away rocks, 
      speaking urgently to each other in Korean...

                                  HURLEY (cont d)
                    JACK -- CAN YOU HEAR ME?!

                                    CHARLIE
                          (dazed)
                    I-- I dunno what happened.  We were 
                    talking and... it all just... It *
                    just came down on top of us...

                        HURLEYCHARLIE
        (to Charlie)
      Dude, we gotta get help.-- Happened so fast...

      Hurley grabs Charlie and pulls him to his feet.

                                    HURLEY*
                    Charlie!  You gotta run to the 
                    beach and get help!  Now!*

                                    CHARLIE
                          (grasping his mission)
                    Right.  On it.

      He runs off.  Stay with Hurley as he calls after him --

                                  HURLEY
                    Make sure you tell Kate!

      CUT TO A REVERSE, behind Charlie and we see (via the magic of 
      GREEN SCREEN) a huge, filled concert arena, complete with 
      screaming fans.  And when we REVERSE again...

      WE SEE the whole four-piece band of DRIVE SHAFT, guitarist, 
      drummer, and IAN, front and center, with his own mic stand, 
      head banging through the intro.

      CLOSE ON CHARLIE again as he steps up to the mic, and opens 
      his mouth to launch into a verse, when...

                                  IAN (SINGING)
                    YOU ALL EVERYBODY, ACTIN  LIKE IT S *
                    THE STUPID PEOPLE...*

      Charlie snaps a look over at Ian, who wails away --

                                  IAN (SINGING) (cont d)*
                    WEARIN  THE  SPENSIVE CLOTHES... *
                    AND THEY NOT...*

    A clearly perturbed Charlie joins in on the chorus...

                                    IAN/CHARLIE (SINGING)
                    YOU ALL EVERYBODY!  YOU ALL...

                                                                          UPCUT TO:


      ON A CLOSED DOOR.  We hear: APPLAUSE and WHOOPING coming from 
      the other side, as the door bursts open.  IAN enters, 
      followed by CHARLIE and the rest of the band.  In the hall 
      behind them we see SCREAMING FANS, T-SHIRTED SECURITY GUARDS.

      WIDEN as RECORD-EXEC TYPES and their assorted eye-candy dates 
      move in to congratulate them.

                                  RECORD EXEC
                    Killer, Ian.  Just killer.

      Before Ian responds, Charlie grabs his arm, pulls him aside.

                                    CHARLIE
                    What the hell was that out there?

                                  IAN
                    Uh... Another kick-ass show?  You 
                    were bloody brilliant!

                    Like the crowd wanted it, y know... 
                    Won t happen again.  I swear...

                                  GROUPIE (O.S.)
                    Ian!

      Ian turns and see a lovely GROUPIE, being blocked by the 
      security guards.  He waves her in, calls out:

                                  IAN
                    She s cool.  Let her in.

      Ian moves to greet her, as Charlie watches him go.  A RECORD 
      EXEC comes over with two flutes of champagne.

                                  RECORD EXEC
                    Have some champagne, Chuck.  You 
                    deserve it.

      But Charlie is focused on something else.  HIS POV - The 
      GROUPIE slips IAN a couple of 35mm film canisters.  You know 
      the type -- the short black plastic tubes with gray pop-off  *
      tops.  Ian kisses the girl, then notices...

      CHARLIE staring at him, a disapproving look on his face.

                                  IAN
                          (to Charlie)
                    Chill, baby brother.

      He pops open a cannister and pulls out a baggy of powder -- 
      the same type we ve seen Charlie snort on the island.

                                  IAN (cont d)
                    Rock gods gotta fly...

      And OFF CHARLIE, betrayed and alone, WE FIND --


      HURLEY - filthy and exhausted, continuing to remove rocks and  *
      dirt from the mountain of rubble sealing the entrance.  WIDEN 
      to see SUN and JIN doing the same.  Hurley strains to remove  *
    a particularly large rock until he hears: *

                    Stop!*

      MICHAEL, BOONE, WALT and the FOUR SOCKS (including Scott and 
      Steve) enter the valley.  Walt checks out the mess... *

                                  HURLEY
                    What do you mean,  stop,  dude?  
                    Jack s in there --

                                  MICHAEL
                    And if you remove that rock you 
                    might bring the whole cave ceiling 
                    down on top of him.
                          (re: Walt under his feet)*
                    Walt, get back, man.  I don t want *
                    you near the rocks, okay?  And take *
                    the dog with you --*

      Why do I have to --
                                                  -- Just do it.

      Walt sulks while he pulls Vincent to the stream for a drink,  *
      but hangs back and watches as Michael studies the collapse...

                                    MICHAEL (cont d)
                    This area over here is load 
                      bearing... We gotta dig where 
                    there s no danger of the wall 
                    buckling in on itself...

                                  BOONE*
                    How do you know so much about --

                                    MICHAEL
                    Eight years of construction work.

      Michael reaches the left side of the obstruction --

                                    MICHAEL (cont d)
                    Here.  We dig here.  Four at a 
                    time.  By hand, until we can 
                    fashion some kinda shovel.  We take *
                    shifts and go slow --

      ON WALT, as Michael continues giving out orders.  A leader.  
    A side of Michael Walt s never seen.

                                    MICHAEL (cont d)*
                    Whoever isn t digging should be

                    Okay.  Let s move.*


      BLACKNESS.  AS WE PAN ACROSS IT, we hear SCRAPING NOISES.  
      THE CAMERA finally comes to rest on the still face of --

      JACK, unconscious.  His battered body WEDGED between the far 
      wall of the space and a HUGE REMNANT of the collapsed PILLAR.

      The scraping sound gets louder, then suddenly -- a long HOE- *
      LIKE PIECE OF FUSELAGE pushes through, displacing some rocks,  *
      and revealing a hole, through which light streams in.  From 
      the other side we can barely make out --

                                  HURLEY (O.S.)
                    We re through!  We got a hole!
                          (shouting)
                    Jack!  Can you hear me?  JACK!

      The sound of Hurley s voice causes Jack to stir, rousing him 
      to consciousness.  His eyes flutter open -- trying to make 
      sense of the dark space and the VISE-LIKE GRIP on him --

                                  HURLEY (O.S.) (cont d)
                    C mon, Dude.  Answer me --

                                  JACK
                    H-Hurley?

                                  HURLEY (O.S.)
                          (faintly; to others)
                    I hear him.

    A cheer of relief ECHOES into the cave from the outside.

                                  HURLEY (cont d)
                    Jack... Bro, you okay?




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              33.
      (CONT'D):2525


      Jack tries to move.  BUT HE CAN T.  Every attempt to do so is 
      met with EXCRUCIATING PAIN.  Even talking is difficult --

                                  JACK
                    I m... I m pinned.  I can t move...
                          (suddenly remembers)
                    Charlie.  Charlie was with me -- *

                                  HURLEY (O.S.)
                    He s okay, man.  He made it out.  *
                    Listen, we re gonna get you out of 
                    there.  Just sit tight.

      And as the irony of that registers on Jack s face, WE FIND -- 


      ON MICHAEL, addressing the others before a hole roughly the  *
      diameter of a TIRE -- the ENTRANCE of their makeshift TUNNEL. *

                                    MICHAEL
                    Okay.  We can t safely make the *
                    tunnel any bigger.  But since Jack *
                    can t get out... One of us is gonna 
                    have to go in.

                                  HURLEY
                    What?  Crawl through that?

                                  BOONE
                    I think he means someone smaller.*

      Sun steps forward (others are around, NO SUBTITLES) -- *

                        SUNJIN
    I could climb through ---- I forbid it!
                                                      (to others)
                                                  I will not permit you to use 
                                                  my wife for such a dangerous--

                                  HURLEY*
                    Dude!  We don t understand Chinese.

                                  MICHAEL
                    Korean, man.  They re Korean.

      He and Sun share a fleeting look, unnoticed by Jin.

                                  CHARLIE (O.S.)
                    I ll do it.

      They all turn to see -- CHARLIE, standing behind them.  And 
      he looks like hell -- but with something that resembles 
      COURAGE... weather he got it from the drugs or not.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              35.

                                  HURLEY
                    Charlie?

                                  MICHAEL
                    No, man.  You re still shook up.  I *
                    might be able to squeeze through --*

                                  CHARLIE
                    Yeah?  Who s gonna look after your 
                    kid if something happens?
                          (to Boone)
                    And you ve got your sister.
                          (re: Sun)
                    She s got a husband.*
                          (beat, without self-pity)*
                    I got no one.  No family.  I m  *
                    alone here.*
                          (then, to Michael)*
                    And I m small.  Let me do this.*

      As Michael looks at him, consider his offer...


      CHARLIE is ready for his climb through the tunnel.  Michael 
      hands him a flashlight.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Go slow and easy, man.  Try not to 
                    nudge any of the rocks around you.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Anything else?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Yeah.  Good luck.

                        BOONEHURLEY
      Be safe, man --
                                                  -- Good luck, Charlie.

      Sun and Walt offer smiles.  Jin, Steve and Scott nod.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Thanks.

      And as the group watches, Charlie enters...


      We go TIGHT ON CHARLIE S FACE as he CRAWLS through the  *
      claustrophobic tunnel...*


      ON CHARLIE as he PUSHES his way through a CROWD -- completely  *
      oblivious to his presence -- congregated in a hallway leading  *
      to a dressing room.  Charlie reaches the DOOR at the end of  *
      the hall and pushes past a SECURITY GUARD into --


    A dimly-lit dressing room (REDRESS), where Charlie spots IAN  *
      across the room on a couch, in a drugged-out stupor with  *
      three equally zoned-out GROUPIES.  On the coffee table before  *
      them, a half-dozen FILM CANNISTERS and baggies of powder.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Bloody hell.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              38.

      He SLAMS the door behind him, causing Ian to look up.

                                  IAN
                    Hey... Baby Brother... Pull up a 
                    bird and sit down...

                                  CHARLIE
                          (to Groupies)
                    Get out.  All of you, get out!

      The girls just look at Ian for confirmation, who shrugs. *

                                  CHARLIE (cont d)
                    NOW.

      The Groupies exit sloppily.  When the last one disappears --

                                  CHARLIE (cont d)
                    You missed the sound check.  You 
                    don t come to rehearsal anymore.  
                    And we ve got a show in an hour --

                    Ooh, a show.  I like shows.

                                    CHARLIE
                    All right, Ian.  This is it... *
                    After tonight, we cancel the rest 
                    of the tour.
                          (dead fucking serious)*
                    We re walking away.

                      CHARLIEIAN
      Walk away.  Like we swore 
      we d do if things got too ---- Are you raving?  Walk away 
                                                  and go where?

      Charlie reacts, stung by that.*




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              39.

                    This is it.  End o  the bleedin  *
                    rainbow.  Try and enjoy it.  Cause *

                    Then what the bloody hell good are *
                    you?*

      And we can see from Charlie s stunned expression that this is  *
    a question he hasn t asked himself in a long time... Ian  *
      grabs one of the CANNISTERS and pushes past Charlie, in whom  *
    we begin to see the glimmer of something new: DESPERATION. *

      As Ian exits into the hallway, to the delight of the fans,  *
      Charlie crosses to a chair and sits, burying his head in his 
      hands.  And when he opens his eyes, he notices:

      One of the baggies of powder.  Charlie stares at it for a  *
      moment, listening to the crowd outside CHANTING Ian s name.   *
      Then resignation comes to his face... And as he picks it up  *
      and reaches in to take his first hit, WE FIND...*


      CHARLIE - struggling through the tunnel, scrapes on his face, 
      his flashlight finding the opening just up ahead...  Then --

    A RUMBLE.  A few SMALL ROCKS fall down in front of him.  He 
      pushes his way through.  But it s getting worse -- harder and 
      harder to see as --

      The rescue team as they hear the RUMBLE too --

      Oh no --
                                                  -- What?

                          (into the tunnel)
                    CHARLIE!  MOVE!


      CHARLIE.  As MORE AND MORE ROCKS crumble from the walls and  *
      ceiling of the tunnel.  And now he can hear Michael screaming  *
      at him --*




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              40.

                                  MICHAEL (O.S.)
                    IT S COMING DOWN!

      Charlie picks up his pace, crawling AS FAST AS HE CAN.  And 
      just as the TUNNEL COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM --


      Charlie FLINGS HIMSELF into the open space where Jack is.  
      But even that space is compromised as --

      STREAMS OF DIRT AND ROCKS POUR INTO IT.  The air is black, 
      CHOKED with dirt and dust.  And as JACK struggles to see 
      through the near-darkness, coughing and gagging, he spots... 

      CHARLIE - looking at him, almost sheepishly.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I m, uh... here to rescue you.

                                                                        BLACK OUT.

                                        ACT FOUR


      KATE -- TIGHT ON HER PANICKED, SWEATING FACE as she runs as 
      fast as she can into the valley.  Follows VOICES to --


      The cave entrance, where the rescuers are FUCKING APOPLECTIC-- 
      NO CLUE WHAT TO DO NOW --

                      HURLEYBOONE
    I say we try again --
                                                  -- We can t just leave them --

                        HURLEYMICHAEL
      -- We don t move they re 
      gonna run out of air ---- Stop talking!  I m trying 
                                                  to think --

                                  KATE (O.S.)
                    Where is he?!

      They turn to see KATE running up to them, out of breath --

                      MICHAELKATE
      Kate --Where is he, Michael?  
                                                    Where s Jack?

                                  HURLEY
                    In there.

                                  KATE
                    Do you know if he s alive?
                          (blank stares)
                    Is he ALIVE?

                                    MICHAEL
                    We don t know.  Charlie went in 
                    after him.  Through a tunnel we 
                    dug.  But it... collapsed.

                                  KATE
                    So why isn t anyone digging?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Kate --*

      Kate looks around at the others, breathlessly, desperately... 
      Then she moves to the barrier wall and starts digging --  *
      clearing away an impossibly large rock.*

                                  MICHAEL (cont d)*
                    Kate...

      She doesn t listen.  Just keeps digging. *

      LOOKS pass between the rescue team.  Without a word, they  *
      each join her.  Despite the fact that it probably won t make  *
    a difference -- but doing it -- for Kate -- anyway... And OFF  *
      KATE S LOOK OF DESPERATE DETERMINATION, WE FIND --


      CHARLIE.  IN THE DARKNESS OF THE CAVE.*

                                    CHARLIE
                    You ready?

      ON JACK, nodding.

                                    CHARLIE (cont d)
                    One... Two... Three!

      On  Three,  CUT WIDE to see Charlie, with great effort, 
      rolling the huge boulder off Jack.  Jack GRUNTS -- in  *
        EXCRUCIATING pain --*

                                    CHARLIE (cont d)
                    Sorry... Sorry, Jack --*

                        JACKCHARLIE
      My shoulder s dislocated!
                                                  -- What?

                                                  -- I can t do it, Jack!

      Jack takes a deep breath.  Speaks as evenly as possible. *

                                  JACK
                    Yes, you can.*

      Charlie stares at him a long BEAT... Then --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Okay.  So what do I do?*




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              43.

                    Grab my hand... Pull as hard as you *
                    can when I tell you.*

      Charlie takes Jack s arm.  He and Jack share eye contact for  *
    a beat, then:

                                  JACK (cont d)
                    Now!*

      TIGHT ON CHARLIE, as he pulls Jack s arm -- the SOUND of Jack  *
      HOWLING IN AGONY --*


      ON JACK S FACE, as he catches his breath.  And with the dust  *
      clearing, he can see the perspiration on Charlie s brow...  *
      the goose bumps... the watery eyes and dilated pupils... *

                                  JACK
                    How long s it been, Charlie?

      Charlie pulls away.  Puts on a smile.*

                                    CHARLIE
                    Don t know what you re talking *

                    How long since your last fix?

      Charlie looks at him, too fucking worn down to deny it... *

                                    CHARLIE
                    Almost a day and a half now.

      And that s when we realize it.  Charlie DIDN T take his drugs 
      back from Locke.  As Jack sits up --

                                  JACK
                    How s the withdrawal treating you?  *
                    Any hallucinations?*

                                  CHARLIE
                    Other than the conversation you and *
                    I had in the jungle about an hour *
                    ago, no, not really.  You have a *
                    wonderful falsetto, by the way.*

                                  JACK*
                    Why didn t you say something, man?  *
                    I could ve helped you through it.*

                                  CHARLIE*
                    Yeah -- You thinking I m not only *
                    useless, but a junkie to boot.*

                                  JACK*
                    You re not useless.  Took a lot of *
                    guts getting in here, trying to *
                    rescue me.  I won t forget that. *

      Charlie and Jack share a look.  Charlie manages a smile. *

                                  CHARLIE*
                    For the rest of our lives?*

                                  JACK*
                          (seeing the humor)*
                    At the rate we re using up the *
                    oxygen in here?  Yeah... that won t *
                    be too long.*

      They chuckle over that for a beat, until Charlie stops, 
      seeing something.  Jack notices the odd look on his face.

                                  JACK (cont d)*
                    What s wrong?*

                                  JACK
                    A what?*

                    Right there.  Behind you.  It s... 
                    There s a bloody moth in here.

      He points the flashlight just past Jack to reveal A MOTH.  
      Luminous, ghostly, beautiful.  It floats over to a nearby  *
      wall and disappears into an unnoticed crack high up. *

                                    CHARLIE (cont d)
                    Hey --

      Charlie climbs up on the boulder that once pinned Jack and  *
      peers into the crack.  As Jack pulls himself to his feet,  *
      Charlie starts to dig.  Clumps of dirt fall away --*

                        JACKCHARLIE
      Charlie!  What are you --?-- Light!  I can see light!

                                    CHARLIE (cont d)
                    The wall here -- It s soft.  Look!

      Jack joins him, digging at the wall with his good hand.   *
      Together they turn the crack into a larger hole.  As light  *
      streams in, FLARING THE LENS...


      CLOSE ON KATE - exhausted, breathing hard as she continues to 
      dig.  She stops for a second to catch her breath and a hand 
      reaches in and touches her arm.  She turns to see...

                                    MICHAEL
                    Kate... You need to take a break...

                                    MICHAEL
                    We have enough people digging.  You 
                    keep going at this pace, you re

      Then, a SHOUT from OFF SCREEN --

                    Hey!  It s the doctor!

      KATE and MICHAEL turn, as does everyone else.  Walt is 
      pointing EXCITEDLY across the valley at --

      CHARLIE and JACK.  Walking towards them.  Dirty as all fuck, 
      but very much ALIVE.

                                  HURLEY
                    What the--

      But Kate is already running for them.  And this is just  *
      instinct because if she had time to think about it, she d 
      probably never do it but --

      She wraps her arms around Jack in the HUG OF ALL HUGS. *

                                  JACK
                    Ow!  Easy...

      As the others CATCH UP.  Hurley fucking THRILLED --

                                  HURLEY
                    How did you get out?*

                                  JACK
                    Charlie found a way.

      Hurley puts his arm around Charlie s shoulder.*

                                    HURLEY*
                    Dude.  You rock.*

      And as we pull away from the joyous group, WE FIND...


      PAN ACROSS the scene.  It s an hour later and things are 
      settling down in the valley after Charlie and Jack s return.  
      Some of the people from the beach, including Scott and Steve, 
      have lingered... There s almost a celebratory feel.

      CHARLIE and JACK sit in front of a campfire, blankets draped 
      over their shoulders as Hurley stops by to give them water.  
      Charlie holds up his cut with a shaky hand...

                                  HURLEY
                          (to Charlie)
                    Dude.  You feeling okay?  You look *
                    a little...

                                  JACK
                    Flu.  He s got the flu.

      Charlie and Jack share a look, an unspoken pact between them.

                                  HURLEY
                    Oh, man.  That s rough.  After all 
                    you ve been through... Fightin  a 
                    flu bug...

      As he moves on, Charlie catches sight of...

      HIS POV - LOCKE, cooking the boar on a spit over a fire.

      Charlie looks at his trembling hands for a beat, then stands.

                                    CHARLIE
                          (to Jack)
                    I m just gonna... stretch my legs.

      Jack nods and Charlie moves off...  We go with Charlie for a 
      bit until he crosses by

      MICHAEL and WALT - We stay on them as a happy Walt climbs the 
      cave walls, Michael holding VINCENT by his leash...

                                  WALT
                    This place is so cool.  Can we live 
                    here?

      Before Michael answers, he looks over his shoulder and we 
      RACK FOCUS on

      JIN and SUN - at another fire across the camp.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              51.

      RACK BACK to MICHAEL as he contemplates the complicated 
        relationship he has with both.

                                  MICHAEL
                    We ll, uh... talk about it, pal...

      And for Walt, that s good enough for now...


      ON LOCKE, turning the boar on the spit when he hears:

                                    CHARLIE (O.S.)
                    Give them to me.

      Locke looks up to see Charlie, and gives a heavy sigh.

                                  LOCKE
                    This is the third time, you know.  *
                    Are you sure you really want --

                                    CHARLIE
                    I m sure.

      Locke nods, pulls the baggie of powder from his pocket.  
      Hands it to Charlie.  Charlie regards the grimy bag in his  *
      hand -- THEN TOSSES IT INTO LOCKE S FIRE. *

      Locke looks up at him.  Too hard to read.  Maybe impressed.  
      Maybe surprised.  Maybe exactly what he expected.  Then --

                                  LOCKE
                    I m proud of you, Charlie.  Always 
                    knew you could do it.

      Charlie nods, then suddenly notices...

      HIS POV - SEVERAL MOTHS, dancing in the air near the flame  *
      they re forever drawn to.  And while Charlie continues to  *
      stare at them... LOCKE continues to stare at him.  Smiling  *
      that smile.


      ON JACK, still sitting by the fire when he hears:

                                  KATE (O.S.)
                    Hey --

      Jack smiles as Kate sits down to join him.*




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              52.

                                  KATE (cont d)*
                    Made you something...*

      She shows him a loop of material, the ends tied in a knot. *

                                  JACK
                          (touched)
                    Ohh.  My very first sling.

      EXTRA CLOSE and INTIMATE as Kate pulls the blanket off him, 
      drapes the sling around his neck, and gently eases his sore 
      arm into it.

                                  JACK (cont d)
                    Thank you.

      She smiles... Then, a little uncomfortable, switches gears:

                                  KATE
                    So... These are the safe caves you 
                    were going on about.

                                  JACK
                    Okay, one unsafe cave in this whole 
                    valley.

                                  KATE
                    That you know of.

      After a beat...

                                  JACK
                    Does that mean you re going back to *
                    the beach?*

                                  KATE
                    Sayid should be back there by now.  *
                    If his plan worked...

                                  JACK
                    Then we re one step closer to 
                    getting off this island.*

      Kate nods.  And there s so much here.  What it all means.   *
      But for now, he s just gonna let it be.

                                  JACK (cont d)*
                    Thanks for the sling, Kate.

                                  KATE
                    You re welcome.
