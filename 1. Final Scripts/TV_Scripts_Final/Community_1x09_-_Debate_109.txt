Jeff walks down a hallway.  DEAN PELTON, PROFESSOR WHITMAN *

DEAN PELTON
Mr. Winger, did you happen to hear 
my announcement this morning?*

JEFF

DEAN PELTON
Listen jerk-wad, Greendale needs a *
win.  Since I ve been here, the *
best compliment I ve heard about 
our sports program is that our 
basketball team is really gay.  So 
what s it going to take to get you 
on board?  A plum parking spot?  
Free meals?

A night of companionship if you 
know what I mean?

what you mean.

light a cigarette, you will

attractive clothes...

Pierce trips and does a hard pratfall over some band 
equipment.

Somebody help me!  Why did I put *
you under so well?  Damn my talent!*

Britta surreptitiously opens one eye but is stuck pretending 
to be asleep in order to protect Pierce s feelings.

The Group is filing in.  Annie is mid-conversation with Jeff.

ANNIE
The topic for the debate is,  Are 
people inherently good or evil?   
So when are we getting together to 
strategize?

JEFF
Annie, I was a lawyer.  I was a 
debater for money.  I ve gone pro.  
I think I can handle it.
