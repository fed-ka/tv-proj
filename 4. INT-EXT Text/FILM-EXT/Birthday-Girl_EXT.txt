John watches while two removal men lift a new double bed
from the back of a van.
JOHN (V.O.)
Someone with a sense of humour.
Someone you can communicate with on
the same level. Someone you can really
talk to. I think communication is
key.
John encircles his house, leaving a thick trail of yellow
powder behind him.
JOHN (V.O.)
And where they've been. I suppose
they have some baggage stroke history.
We see that John is talking to his PC. It has a small digital
camera on the side.
JOHN
We all have someone in our past who
uh... one skeleton, if you like.
We've all got at least one person,
as it were, under the patio. Not
literally of course. I suppose I
only say this because I always thought
people who did this sort of thing
were... I had an image that they
were losers. Not losers. A bit sad.
But I think this is the modern world.
And I think really it's quite a brave
move. Quite a brave, reasonable thing
to do.
He smiles.
JOHN
Sorry can we start again?
SINGLE CARD ON BLACK:
BIRTHDAY GIRL
John's fingers in close-up, type JOHN BUCKINGHAM, and his
AMEX number into his PC. Finished, he stops, and rests his
face on his hands.
He hits SEND. That instant, a worry of black crows bursts up
in the field behind him and takes to the swirling air.
Blackout. Music. Titles.
The titles pop and slide over footage of Russian women, on
computer video, advertising themselves. They mostly speak in
Russian, some of which is subtitled, some speak in English.
The women slide on and off the screen, overlap and collide,
as the titles appear. Close-ups on mouths and eyes, tight
and pixellated. It becomes a wall of image and sound.
CUT TO:
The GIGANTIC UNDERSIDE of a Boeing 747 TEARS down the screen.
It's pouring with rain as they cross the car park towards a
patched up yellow Rover. John stows the suitcase in the boot
and opens the passenger door for her.
John turns the key in the ignition. The MG wheezes and coughs.
He tries again. Nothing. The third time it just catches and
he coaxes it to life. The colour's drained from his cheeks.
They head for the motorway. The silence in the car lasts
just long enough for John to feel he is breaking it.
JOHN
It's about forty miles from here. I
don't know if you've looked at a
map, it's close to London but it's a
city in itself. A Roman city. It's a
nice house. I'm having a problem
with ants. I uh... It's the warmer
weather. I can't seem to find the
nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
NADIA
Yes.
JOHN
I just can't find a nest. The root
of the problem. I've looked
everywhere. What's the Russian for
ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry.
This is strange isn't it.
NADIA
Yes.
JOHN
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
NADIA
Yes.
JOHN
I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem
with ants."
He shakes his head.
JOHN
I had this...
He pulls a sign from his jacket which says "Nadia!"
JOHN
As a joke but uh...
He tosses it onto the back seat.
They drive. He sees Nadia looking at England.
JOHN
So. Is it different to how you
imagined it?
NADIA
Yes.
JOHN
I bet.
(pause)
What about me? Am I how you imagined?
NADIA
Yes.
He double-takes, changes lanes.
JOHN
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I
speaking too fast for you?
NADIA
Yes.
John looks across.
JOHN
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
NADIA
Yes.
JOHN
Good. Or should I speak slower?
NADIA
Yes.
JOHN
Do you follow or should I speak
slower?
NADIA
Yes.
He looks across. Back at the road. He changes gear.
JOHN
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
NADIA
Yes.
John turns to face the road ahead.
JOHN
(to himself)
Oh Jesus.
He drives in silence.
JOHN
Oh Jesus.
Suddenly she winds the window down and vomits out of the
speeding car. John panics and swerves onto the hard shoulder
amidst loud horn blasts.
John navigates his way round the Rover in the rain to find
her kneeling on the verge, throwing up. He puts a hand on
her shoulder, but she stands up quickly, maintaining an icy
dignity considering what has just happened.
It has stopped raining and a group of young boys are playing
cricket in the road. They clear as a Yellow Rover pulls into
the Close, and into the drive of the little house at the
end.
As John climbs out of his car he eyes the boys. The boys eye
him, and his new friend.
Exterior view of John's darkened house. A fox trots across
the Cul-De-Sac and sits under John's car, where it curls up.
John sprints down his lawn, scattering the big black crows
eating his garden. He jumps the fence, and across the fields.
John jogs along by a river in the countryside behind his
house, wearing shorts and a tee shirt. His breath billows
around him in the sharp morning air.
He stops running by a gate overlooking a small hill. He
doubles up to recover, panting hard.
The milkman hops a low fence between two houses. He waves to
a man watering his rose trees.
A mother corrals her school children into a Volvo. They don't
want to go.
John drives his Rover through the centre of town, the low
orange sun on his face.
The Rover pulls into the driveway. John opens the glove
compartment and removes the ring Nadia gave him, and puts it
back on. He collects a brown paper package from the passenger
seat.
He walks warily out into the sunlight. She looks up, then
back to the big book in her lap. He places the tea next to
her on the grass.
JOHN
Are you O.K.?
She looks at him, then down at her tome. She speaks slowly,
in a heavy accent:
NADIA
Today is bath day.
JOHN
Sorry?
She studies her book. Looks up.
NADIA
Today is bath day.
He shakes his head.
JOHN
Bath day?
She nods.
JOHN
I don't understand.
NADIA
Happy bath day.
The penny drops.
JOHN
Today?
She frowns. John leafs through the dictionary.
JOHN
Syevodnya?
NADIA
Syevodnya
JOHN
Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
He puts his hand on her shoulder.
NADIA
Party.
(pause)
Party. Syevodnya.
John nods, smiling.
JOHN
Yes. Party. Party syevodnya.
She lights a cigarette from the butt of her last. Blows smoke.
She holds the jumper up to John, as if to try it for size,
and the theme returns.
A shot from above, of the Rover's windscreen, reflecting the
passing trees.
The roof is down. We glide up the windscreen, up Nadia's
body, in the passenger seat. Her face is upturned slightly,
she's wearing sunglasses, which reflect the passing trees.
A young girl runs through a summer meadow with a pair of
Russian Army field binoculars, around her neck.
YURI (V.O.)
I would run around with them taking
pictures of things I liked with my
mind. If I saw something beautiful I
would take a picture.
With the binoculars pressed to her face, she spies
butterflies, birds, a rabbit. She stops running and aims the
binoculars up, up, into the sun
The small party has moved outside to the patio, where they
sit around a low wooden table in the mellow candlelight. A
huge late Summer moon hangs over the fields. Alexei tinkles
beautifully on his guitar.
He stops asks a question in Russian.
JOHN
What was that?
YURI
Oh nothing.
JOHN
Tell me.
YURI
No. It is too judgmental.
JOHN
Tell me what he said.
YURI
He says why did you send to Russia
for a wife.
Silence. John suddenly looks sick.
YURI
You are not ashamed of it? It's no
surprise to want to love.
JOHN
No. It's not that.
YURI
Do you believe in love?
JOHN
I suppose it's... I mean define your
terms.
YURI
It's very strange. How many people
are truly themselves with their love?
It is the greatest human disaster
and it is never in the newspapers.
There are no Marches Against
Heartache, no Ministries Against
Loneliness, no Concerts Against
Disappointment. We look away. And
still we know in secret that nothing
is more important to us. The one
thing we all share but don't say.
Look John I will show you something.
He takes a plate and starts reaching for the food.
YURI
Here look, something beautiful from
Russia. Here is Life, there, take
it.
John accepts the plate.
YURI
Here is bread. Khylep. This is work.
We all need this, here eat.
John eats.
YURI
Good. But we cannot survive with
just work, so here is meat and blood.
Myasa. This is family and country,
flesh, strength, eat.
John bites the sausage.
YURI
But again this is not life. Here is
joy and pain. Chyesnok. Without these
life has no flavour, is too serious.
Eat.
John nibbles some pickled garlic.
YURI
But this vodka.
(pause)
Is love. Only this magic changes you
inside. The moon and the stars and
the sun.
Yuri offers John the glass. He looks at Nadia, takes it and
swigs it down in one. He looks across at Nadia, wiping his
mouth, his eyes watering. She looks back at him.
Alexei begins softly singing a song. As he sings:
YURI
This is a love song, a soldier's
song to his beloved -- Alexei, he's
Afghanstya, a veteran of Afghanistan.
He saw terrible things.
They listen to the beautiful, sad voice. For the second verse
Yuri joins in, a slow stirring lament. For the end Nadia
joins in too and the three of them begin harmonising
beautifully. John watches in the candlelight.
John, Nadia and Alexei pose with the cake. Nadia puts her
arm round John and Alexei. With a FLASH! Yuri takes a
Polaroid.
The guitar theme returns as we see the Polaroid on the table
in close up, developing speeded up. John comes into focus,
beaming.
John follows a path through a big silent wood, the low sun
flaring and catching his white work shirt.
P.O.V. OF JOHN
through binoculars, a long way off and squinting into the
sun.
Nadia lowers the binoculars and looks past us.
CUT TO:
John spots some figures lying on the grass in the distance.
He heads towards them, and watches them for a moment from
thirty yards away.
Alexei, Yuri and Nadia sit in a small clearing. A blanket,
cushions, bread and vodka are scattered around. Yuri is
strumming a guitar. Alexei and Nadia are laughing and
chatting. He removes a small twig from her hair and flattens
it under his big hand. John watches the gesture. It's so
intimate they could be lovers.
YURI
(calls)
John. We can see you hiding.
John steps out of his hiding place and approaches the group.
Alexei has Nadia falling about laughing about something. He
smiles at her then nods to John.
Pieces of cooked rabbit lie in tin foil. Alexei feeds a piece
to Nadia with a big hunting knife. Nadia smiles at John, and
starts knitting.
YURI
How is bank?
JOHN
Fine. I thought you were leaving
today.
YURI
To be indoors on such a day. It's
crime.
Nadia stops knitting and takes her shirt off and stretches
back to sunbathe in her black bra. Alexei takes the knife he
has just finished cleaning and holds the cold wide blade
flat above Nadia's bare stomach. Just before pressing it
down he looks across at John. Nadia yelps and sits up. They
laugh, and Yuri joins in. John laughs uneasily.
Alexei notices marks on Nadia's midriff. He asks her about
them in Russian.
John goes white, unable to understand Nadia's explanation.
He has no idea what she told him.
At sunset, the four run towards a lake in their underwear.
They jump and dive in, and begin splashing each other.
John duck-dives under the water and swims through the sunlit
streaked green water. We see him under the water, swimming
towards us, caught by the sun's rays.
John surfaces, and wipes the water from his eyes. He spots
Alexei and Nadia playing in the water. Alexei grabs her and
throws her in the air and she comes down with a splash.
John treads water nearby. He watches them both hold their
noses and disappear under the surface.
They've both vanished. John ducks under the water.
John's underwater P.O.V.: It's too murky to see anything.
The two surface, breathing hard, laughing. John watches them.
Alexei holds Nadia tight and looks like he might even kiss
her. But instead he ducks her and holds her under the water.
John treads water nearby. She's been under a long time.
JOHN
Hey.
John begins to swim toward Alexei. Just as he gets near,
Alexei lets Nadia surface, coughing and spluttering -- she
shouts at Alexei in Russian, angry.
Alexei makes for her again but she pushes him away, twice,
almost slapping him. She is very uncomfortable. She swims
away.
Yuri admonishes his friend in Russian. Alexei stares at John,
then swims off powerfully back towards the shore.
YURI
He's just having fun. He's maybe too
strong you know...
John watches Nadia walk out of the lake towards her clothes.
A light summer rain. Drips fall from rose petals.
John drives grim-faced through the morning rain. Yuri is
next to him staring ahead at the road. Alexei is in the back
with Nadia who is still bound and gagged. He's holding his
knife to her ribs.
John hauls ass towards us straight down the middle of the
road, a guitar case in either hand, footsteps clapping loudly
on the wet cobbles. Alarms sound, dogs bark.
He skis around a corner, and sprints up this other street.
We are close by his head, as he sprints one hundred metres.
Running flat out across the car park. Yuri throws open the
car door and John hurls the guitar cases inside. He dives
in, turns the key in the ignition. The Rover coughs and
wheezes. He tries again. It spits and misfires. The third
time it catches and lives. John grinds the gears and lurches
off.
It careens down a side-street.
Alexei opens one of the cases and looks inside. He takes a
deep breath and swears in Russian.
He shows what is in the case to Nadia. Her eyes widen.
Alexei gently lowers the gag and kisses her on the mouth.
She returns the kiss hungrily.
John spots them in the mirror and nearly crashes the car.
He looks desperately across at Yuri. Yuri is now pointing
the big knife at John's ribs. The Russian shrugs almost
apologetically.
In the back seat Nadia has freed herself and is beginning to
pull at Alexei's clothes. They begin making out passionately.
John's eyes slowly lose focus. He turns grey, then white. He
drives and we watch the life seep out of him.
Cars tear through the night along the carriage way, past a
Happy Eater. We pan round, across the motorway to a single
storey run-down Motel.
Cars crawl by on the road outside, their tail-lights
stretching over the hill.
The shot processes and fades into dawn and light.
The early morning commuters now use the carriageway.
The mid morning traffic flows by on the dual carriageway.
John drags her by the arm across the car-park towards the
Rover.
John drags her out of the Rover. She wrestles her arm free
and walks up the steps on her own, with some dignity. John
follows her.
John walks back to the Rover, Nadia behind. They reach the
car. Nadia looks at John over the roof of the car.
NADIA
What are you doing?
John looks sick. He speaks very quietly.
JOHN
Get in the car.
He gets inside. Nadia is left standing there. She gets in
too.
John driving with Nadia in the passenger seat. She is looking
across at him.
He is taking no notice.
NADIA
Plenty of women have babies in prison.
John ignores her.
NADIA
(tersely)
You don't have to do this. I can
look after myself.
JOHN
(flatly)
Have you got your passport?
NADIA
What?
JOHN
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
NADIA
Yes.
They drive along.
JOHN
We've got to get off this motor-way.
From above we watch the car turn off the motorway, around a
roundabout and into a country B road.
John's car pulling off a B road, into a slip road into a
garage.
Stern-faced, John fills the car up with petrol. He eyes the
Closed-Circuit.
JOHN
Give me some money.
NADIA
I don't have any money.
John stops squeezing petrol.
JOHN
What?
NADIA
I said I don't have any.
John stares at Nadia. He eyes the CCTV.
JOHN
Give me your sunglasses.
Nadia passes them and John puts them on,trying to look casual.
He gives the pump a couple more squirts, hangs it up,
nonchalantly sidles up to his door.
In one move he opens it, dives in, turns the key in the
ignition. The Rover coughs. He tries it again. It howls,
barks and sneezes. The attendant comes out onto the forecourt
and starts approaching the yellow Rover.
Miraculously it roars throatily to life, he floors it and
the Rover tears away from the station and off down the road
John's car shimmering as it comes over the brow of a remote
country lane, surrounded by fields and rolling hills.
Nadia puts a cigarette in her mouth and pops the dashboard
lighter. John takes the cigarette and throws it out the
window, followed by the lighter. Nadia just gazes out of the
window.
JOHN
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't
his name...
NADIA
I don't want to talk about him.
JOHN
Fine.
NADIA
It's none of your business.
JOHN
Fine. Absolutely. Must be
disappointing though. Must come as a
hell of a shock.
Nadia ignores him.
JOHN
So uh...
NADIA
Look, if you want to know is he better
in bed than you then yes he is.
JOHN
Oh Jesus.
NADIA
If what you want to know is does he
have a bigger cock than you, then
yes he does.
JOHN
(overlapping -- bigger)
Of course. Of course. Of course he
does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
NADIA
But, you know, so what?
They drive.
JOHN
It's his baby I take it.
She doesn't answer.
JOHN
Not the kids type then is he? Not
that broody. You must be pretty
miffed.
NADIA
He will come back.
JOHN
Excuse me?
NADIA
He left me my passport and ticket.
It's pretty clear he wants to see me
again.
JOHN
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon
women I really want to see again
too.
NADIA
No. But you tend to tie them up.
John freezes. He looks across. Nadia gives nothing back.
JOHN
Fuck off.
Nadia is just looking at him.
JOHN
Fuck off. You started it.
She is just looking at him.
JOHN
I don't want to talk about it.
NADIA
Why not?
JOHN
Shut up. I'm not listening.
NADIA
You don't want to talk about it.
JOHN
No.
NADIA
Okay we won't talk about it.
Nadia looks out the window.
NADIA
We'll pretend it never happened.
JOHN
So. What's it like having to fuck
men you hate?
NADIA
I don't hate you.
JOHN
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have
had sex with people you don't like
haven't you? For money. To make money.
NADIA
And? What are you saying?
JOHN
And. It's wrong.
NADIA
And who says what is wrong.
JOHN
And that would be Morals. That would
be one's own moral sense of decency.
NADIA
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me
how it feels exactly.
JOHN
So. What then? You just detach sex
from everything..
NADIA
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional
journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's
pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
JOHN
Listen. I didn't go rooting around
in your private stuff.
John remembers he did. Nadia looks across knowingly.
NADIA
Funny. Usually it's the first thing
they do.
Pause.
JOHN
So what? Do you just switch off in
your head or do you imagine you're
with him, or what?
NADIA
Sometimes.
JOHN
Sometimes which?
NADIA
Sometimes neither.
JOHN
Some... What does that mean?
NADIA
There's nothing wrong in liking sex,
John.
JOHN
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll
be having sex ever again.
NADIA
Why?
JOHN
Well, it's just that the thought
trying to charm up an erection in
front of a woman, or alone for that
matter, makes me want to die.
NADIA
So now you hate all women?
JOHN
I think it's my safest bet, don't
you?
NADIA
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I
think you got what you paid for.
John looks across.
JOHN
What?
NADIA
You...
JOHN
I got what I paid for.
NADIA
You didn't mind too much.
Pause.
JOHN
(quietly)
It wasn't what I wanted.
NADIA
So what did you want? I think we
understand each other, no?
JOHN
(quietly)
You don't understand me.
NADIA
You don't understand you either.
John turns to her.
NADIA
It's no big thing. You are the same
as most men. You are a man so you
are a savage. Not a monster, but
half animal. You put on a tie and
you go to the bank, but really you
are a beast. But also you are from
woman so you have a soul. Half beast,
half soul. But you hide your beast
in the bottom of the wardrobe. It's
not so healthy. It's fucked you up,
no?
John stops the car.
JOHN
Get out.
She sits there.
NADIA
Excuse me?
JOHN
Get out
NADIA
You are throwing me out.
JOHN
Get out.
She collects her bag from the back seat, her cigarettes,
gathers up her belongings, clicks open the door and gets
out, leaving the shot. John sits there staring ahead. We
hear her voice offscreen.
NADIA (O.S.)
You prefer your women mute.
John turns the key in the ignition. The engine bellows and
screams. Silence.
He tries again. The engine shrieks and wails like a soul in
torment. A terrible, mournful grinding noise. Silence.
NADIA (O.S.)
Car trouble?
John tries to start it. It lets out a whimper, a crying, a
few juddering moving sobs, and dies.
John sits in his dead car. He shakes his head. He rubs his
face. He sits there.
The two of them on a verge ten feet apart. John stares into
the distance.
Nadia studies the map.
NADIA
It's another twenty miles. It's going
dark.
She gets her holdall from inside the car and stuffs the map
inside.
NADIA
What now?
Nadia scans the horizon with her binoculars. John watches
her.
JOHN
Jesus. You weren't even on the plane.
Nadia lowers her binoculars and looks at John.
Alexei, dressed in a suit, stands outside John's house,
looking up. Nadia is in the window, her lipstick smeared.
They gaze at each other.
In a clearing, John watches Nadia carry a pile of sticks to
a fire she is building. She lights it with her gun cigarette
lighter, and teases the flames to life.
John and Nadia sit by the fire. She sits wrapped up to her
neck in a blanket.
NADIA
You know, in Russia, there's no work
for women. It's a different world.
JOHN
(interrupting on
"different")
You don't have to say anything
NADIA
(overlapping on "say")
What? I... I wasn't saying...
JOHN
(overlapping on
"saying")
Please, there's no... Oh.
NADIA
I wasn't saying anything.
JOHN
Then okay.
(pause)
So how old were you when you met
him?
Pause.
NADIA
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was
very kind and strong.
JOHN
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
NADIA
The rest of the world, John, it's
not all like St. Albans.
JOHN
Thank Christ for that.
NADIA
You are pretty naive if you think it
is.
JOHN
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You
have to do all this, and what have
you got to show for it? Nothing.
NADIA
I don't have nothing.
JOHN
Well what have you got?
Pause.
NADIA
I have my baby.
They sit there in the lapping firelight.
JOHN
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
NADIA
No.
JOHN
Have you had any before?
NADIA
No.
JOHN
Are you scared?
NADIA
Not really. Maybe a little.
A fox cries out in the night.
NADIA
Listen. I think it's a fox.
She listens. It cries out again. She gets out her binoculars.
NADIA
It sounds close.
She looks through them and searches the brush. John watches
Nadia with her binoculars. He looks suddenly very sad.
NADIA
I can't see anything. It's too dark.
She puts them back in her bag. John watches her. He sees her
wrist again. She lights a cigarette, and blows the smoke
into the air.
NADIA
What happened between you and the
blonde?
JOHN
What?
NADIA
The thin... the girl with small eyes.
The one in your cupboard.
JOHN
It's none of your business. She didn't
have small eyes.
NADIA
Did she leave you? Come on. It's
nothing to be ashamed of. Who did
she leave you for? Your best friend?
Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you
for a woman, John?
JOHN
She's dead.
Pause.
NADIA
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt
you. I'm sorry. That's awful. Forgive
me.
Pause.
NADIA
I'm sorry.
JOHN
I don't know why I said that. She's
not dead at all.
Nadia looks at John.
NADIA
What?
JOHN
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
NADIA
She's alive?
Nadia starts to laugh. Long and loud. We have never seen her
laugh before.
NADIA
She's alive!! She is not dead?
JOHN
Laugh it up.
She starts to cough. She gets on her hands and knees and
coughs like fury.
JOHN
You should stop smoking. You're
pregnant. You smoke like a fucking
lab dog.
NADIA
I'm trying to quit.
JOHN
I've got news for you. It's not
working.
NADIA
I smoke more these days. I smoke
more when I'm unhappy.
JOHN
Nobody's that unhappy.
NADIA
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want
me to die?
JOHN
I don't want anyone to die.
NADIA
Except for Small Eyes.
JOHN
Except for Small Eyes.
She laughs again.
NADIA
So why did it end?
John thinks. It looks as if he's going to tell the whole
story. In the end he shrugs.
JOHN
I don't know.
NADIA
What was her name?
JOHN
What's your name?
The fox cries out again.
NADIA
Listen. It's definitely a fox. Now
I'm scared.
They listen to the fox crying in the night.
NADIA
You know you can come under the
blanket.
JOHN
It's alright.
The scene from bird's eye view. John lies back and stares at
the stars. Nadia curls up on the other side of the fire, and
hugs herself.
We push down closer and closer until we are on John's face.
The theme returns.
The cricket boys from John's Close stand in a line in the
middle of the street, bathed in flashing blue light. We pan
round and end on John's house.
It is surrounded with Police.
Police cars, Police Vans, plastic police tape "POLICE LINE.
DO NOT CROSS."
John's neighbours press against the tape as officers come
and go.
Inside the house is full of police, ransacking his possessions
and dusting fingerprints. A policeman is standing reading
The English-Russian Dictionary.
We push on upstairs and along the landing to the spare room.
An officer dumps a pile of porno magazines and videos on the
bed. He then spots the belts tied to the bedstead and points
them out to a detective. They exchange a knowing grin. A
photographer steps up and snaps the paraphernalia in a
blinding flash.
The birthday cake is there, half eaten. A Policewoman puts
it in a baggy.
We pan across the bed, across the magazines and underwear in
plastic bags, down below the bed, where we find the photograph
of Nadia with the binoculars.
The young girl smiles hopefully out at us from the past.
Early dawn. A woodpigeon coos. John wakes up next to the
dead fire. Nadia is gone.
John slides down a rocky slope. He scans the forest, but
there's no-one around. He hurries through high bracken then
stops suddenly by a large oak.
In a pool in a stream below, Nadia is washing herself. She
has her back to us.
John watches her for a moment, before his eyes avert, and
his head bows.
A shimmering sun. A giant combine harvester cuts a wide swathe
through a field of high corn. As it passes we find John and
Nadia coming towards us through the heat haze.
They aren't speaking and both look tired. As they pass we
crane up out of the corn to catch an enormous 757 Jumbo Jet
just above us, coming into land. We pan round to see, half a
mile away, the massive airport beyond.
They walk towards it, two tiny figures.
CUT TO:
Aeroflot 1311. Boarding Gate 12.
On the other side of the airport, John stands in front of
the exit to the taxi ranks. He's got nowhere to go. Passengers
swirl around him.
He looks at the binocular in his hands. He removes the
binoculars and looks at them. Suddenly he stops. In the case
is a folded note marked John. John holds it in his hands --
Slowly, deliberately, he screws it up, and drops it in the
case like a bin.
P.O.V. OF JOHN
Through the binoculars. Passengers criss-cross, but we find
Nadia sitting alone, waiting for her call.
John lowers the binoculars and gazes across the airport. He
raises them for one last look.
Nadia, glimpsed through the crowd. We spy someone standing
about twenty feet behind her. It is Alexei.
We watch Alexei approach her. She looks up and is completely
thrown.
Yuri stands about ten feet away, in shades.
John lowers the binoculars, horrified. He looks again.
Nadia pulls her arm away. Alexei crouches down in front of
her and puts a hand on her knee, coaxing her.
Alexei takes her by the arm and leads her away.
John hurries out of the exit to catch the trio leaving a
different exit fifty yards away, where they get into a taxi.
John runs across a car park and over a low fence.
He chases down a slip road, as the taxi rounds the corner
behind us. He takes cover behind a van as they drive past,
and away.
John runs across a grass verge and another car park. He sees
the taxi rounding the corner and head down the road in front
of him.
John runs as fast as he can up this road, but the taxi is
getting away. Eventually he gives up, and he drives away.
At the roundabout it turns round and starts coming back up
the road. John hides behind a car, and watches the taxi pull
up outside a small hotel about fifty yards away. He watches
the trio head into the hotel.
John skirts around the edge of the hotel. He peers in through
one of the windows. It's the foyer. He heads around the back.
At the back of the hotel he looks through another couple of
windows. Suddenly he drops like he's been shot, and sits on
the grass.
Warily he looks again.
Alexei stands smoking in the middle of the room. Nadia is
sitting in a chair crying.
Alexei kneels again and appeals to her. Nadia is resisting
and yells back, but something Alexei says seems to melt her
resolve.
He holds her face, and kisses it. She turns her face. He
tries again, and this time she accepts the kiss. Slowly she
kisses him back.
John stares through the window at the scene.
John's face at the window. Almost cheek to cheek with Nadia.
John watches Nadia walk over to the dresser and search the
drawers. She goes over to the bed and looks under the pillow.
There she finds what she is looking for. Alexei's hunting
knife.
She hears Alexei coming and stands hard against the window.
the huge knife behind her back.
John outside. He is four inches from the knife.
JOHN
Oh Jesus.
John ducks down, panting, swallowing hard. At once he springs
up and skirts the building again. He finds a window to the
next suite.
He tries to force it open. Suddenly Yuri's face appears in
the window, cupped by his hands peering out into the
blackness. John drops down holds his breath.
John scrambles back to the previous window. With real effort
he presses it open. He pulls himself up and drops inside.
The front of the terminal. Taxis pull up and idle at a rank,
bringing travelers to their flights. The automatic doors
slide back and forth.
With a deafening roar, an Aeroflot Boeing 757 lifts slowly
from the runway and climbs up into the night sky, where it
becomes a distant star.
A distant aeroplane in a cobalt blue sky, through binoculars.
The young girl from the very first scene lowers the binoculars
and lets them hang around her neck. She squints up at the
sun.
A voice calls her.
WOMAN'S VOICE
Nadia!
The girl looks round.
WOMAN'S VOICE
Nadia!
She runs past us and we follow to see a couple sitting on
the grass having a picnic.
The girl hurries towards them and we realise the couple are
John and Sophia, the girl her child. She sits down with them.
