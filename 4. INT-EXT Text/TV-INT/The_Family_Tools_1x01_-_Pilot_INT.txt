      with wild hair, tiny mustache, and a Jr. ROTC cadet shirt,
    is frozen mid-bite with a spoon and bowl of cereal, creeped-

                    Mom?  I think we need to let the
                    ambulance guys in.

      TERRY, 49, a Patricia Clarkson type in a bohemian shirt and
      head scarf, makes coffee while her brother, TONY, 55 lies
      calmly on the floor, squinting like lemon got in his eye.

                    We are a family, Mason.  And sometimes
                    family means locking out emergency
                    personnel until your uncle promises
                    to retire and work on his heart
                    health.  You listening, Tony?

                                    TONY
                    I do not negotiate with terrorists. 
                    Mason, open the door for the E.M.T.'s.

                    Uncle Tony, are you going to haunt
                    us if we let you die?

                                    TONY

                    How about tea?  I got a tickle in my
                    throat today.  It's the worst.

      Jack comes in to the empty house, girded for the worst, but
      discovers his dad's TV chair is empty.  He calls upstairs:

                                    JACK
                    Dad?  Aunt Terry?  Sorry I'm late.  

    He waits for an answer and shrugs, "Oh, well."

      Jack carries his gear downstairs as the sound of firecrackers
      below freak him out for several beats of mayhem.  At the
      bottom of the stairs he finds a shitty, unfinished room,
      filled with smoke, two beds and Mason, now in his Jr. ROTC
      cadet shirt and underwear.  Mason is sweet but over-eager.   

                                      MASON
                    Hey, cuz. I heard you coming and
                    wanted to surprise you and make a
                    cool impression.

                    You know what else would have made a
                    cool impression?  Pants.  

                                      MASON
                    Ha!  As if.

                                    JACK
                    No if.  Just as.  Put pants on, Mason. 
                    Where's my dad?

                                      MASON
                    Out.  P.S. You and me are gonna be
                      outstanding roommates.  I figure we
                    can start a positive message rock
                    band ASAP.  We can sing about faith
                    and duty to country.  Or we can drop
                    the positive message and shred to
                    some death metal.  I'm flexible.  I
                    just wanna rock. 
                          (unpacking for Jack)

                    I travel military broke.  Can you 
                    leave my bags closed, please?  

      The boiler kicks in, startling Jack.  

                                      MASON
                    It does that every half hour or so
                    lately.  You'll get used to it.  And
                    if you smell something like rat turd
                    funk, I did some re-con -- it's just
                    mouse turds, so that's "all good."  
                          (lighting fuse)
                    You're gonna stay living here, right?

                    It's more of a stop-over thing.  I
                    like walls and no explosions. 

    As the fireworks start exploding Mason yells...

                                      MASON
                    Reasons to stay:  we can lift weights
                    together, do ROTC drills, jam in our

                    Plus, you can save your father from
                    his heart dying.

      Jack stares in horror\confusion.  

                                    JACK
                    So I can save him from what?

                    I'm with Aunt Terry in feeling this
                    whole thing is a blessing.  Not that
                    you're sick but that I can be of
                    true service to my dad.  Now, you

                    Oh please.  Who hasn't shot themselves
                    or a coworker in the foot now and
                    then?  Or started a brush fire near
                    a ranger station.  Or broke a dam--

                                    JACK
                    Everybody hasn't, Aunt Terry, but
                    thanks.  Maybe it's because I aim
                    too high or try too hard.  You're a
                    tough example to live up to, Dad.

                                      TERRY
                    Not lately.  Look at him -- a pine
                    cone could live up to that. 
                          (off Jack's look)
                    I'll be quiet.

                                    JACK
                    Dad, I've always wanted to do
                    something big with my life.  Save
                    lives or save souls.  But maybe the
                    person I have to save is you.  And I
                    know I get excited about things then
                    lose focus and bad things happen and
                    I jump ship and come home.  But not
                    this time.  Partly because I'm already
                    home.  But I'm focused on making you
                    proud.  And bringing us closer.

                                    TONY
                          (takes Jack's arm)
                    I'll die now just to stop hearing
                    you talk like a fruitloop, Jack. 
                          (then)
                    Here's the deal.  The doctor gave me
                    two options: retire or croak.  Took
                    me an hour to mull the choice.  Then
                    I thought, "Okay, I'll retire, but I
                    poured decades of blood, sweat and
                    tears into that business.  It's like
                    a son to me." And all I can think
                    is, "Who besides my other son could
                    I get to run it?" 

                                    JACK
                    I appreciate that sentiment, Dad.      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 8.

                    No, seriously, who?  I'm still trying
                    to come up with someone.  If you
                    know anybody else, let me know.

      Darren kisses the old man goodbye and gets in, leaving Ellis
    on the sidewalk alone.  

                                    JACK (CONT'D)
                    Let's hear it for prompt start-times,
                    huh, partner?  I foresee us having
                    successful and spiritually fulfilling--

                                      DARREN
                    Where's Tony?   

                                    JACK
                          (still upbeat)
                    Huh?  Oh.  I'm taking over for him
                    while his heart mends.  He said he
                    was gonna call you.  

                                      DARREN
                    Maybe he did -- I been busy pokin'.
                          (into phone)
                    What's that, Princess?  You still
                    out of breath?  
                          (to Jack)
                    Told you I was busy.

                                    JACK
                          (points to Ellis)
                    Darren, we can't leave your
                      grandfather out there alone.

                                      DARREN
                    Oh, he's cool.  I left him a sandwich.
                          (off Jack's look)
                    Man, you are still so uptight.  Watch:  

      Darren gets out and goes to take the sandwich and Ellis smacks
      his hand - a sudden move like the movie "Awakenings."       Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 10.
                     



                                      DARREN (CONT'D)
                          (getting in van)
                    See?  He's bad-ass.  Let's roll. 

      Darren pulls out the 40-oz from the bag.  Sees Jack eye him.

                                      DARREN (CONT'D)
                    This is coffee.  Can we go?

      Jack forces a smile and drives.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Jack is driving and trying to read a clipboard of work orders. 
      Darren has his feet up on the dash.  

                                      DARREN
                          (sotto, on phone)
                    Yeah, it's nuts -- I got this clown
                    saying he's a new Tony when nobody
                    can be a new Tony.

                                    JACK
                    I can hear everything you're saying.

                                      DARREN
                    Not you, pimp-juice.  Different guy. 
                    Across town.  
                          (into phone)
                    Yeah, that was him.  Now he's an
                    upset clown, heh-heh, but it's all
                    gravy -- I'll try and help him, but
                    history says he won't last.  

                                    JACK
                    I'm gonna last!  

                                      DARREN
                    Not you.  Damn, so paranoid.  Relax. 
                    Have some coffee.
                          (offers 40 oz, then
                          sees something ahead)
                    Whoa-whoa-whoa, stop the van. 
                          (calls out window)
                    Berrick!  Berriiiick!  What's up?  

      A shifty guy, BERRICK, hurries with a flat screen TV.  

                                      BERRICK
                    You know.  Keepin' busy.  Can I get
                    a ride?  My car won't start and I
                    kinda need to leave the area fast.      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 11.
                     



      Darren opens the door.

                                    JACK
                    Whoa.  Hey, fellas.  Don't want to
                    ruffle feathers here, but we're headed
                    to an important client, and I'd just-
                    as-soon not get involved with a thief.  

                                      DARREN
                    Thief?  That is presumptive and
                    hurtful, man.  Is that because Berrick
                    is part Asian?  

                                      BERRICK
                    Asians built the railroads, homey.

                                      DARREN
                    That's a bad start for our positive
                    working rapport.  Bad.

      This hits Jack hard.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      They drive with Berrick in the van.  Jack's pissed.  Berrick
      swigs Darren's "coffee."

                                      DARREN
                          (on phone)
                    I think this might work out, me and
                    this dude.  I miss Tony, but there's
                    a definite upside to having no boss. 
                    Do what we want, go when we want. 
                    Everyday's a party day.

                                    JACK
                    You have a boss.  Me.  It's not a
                    party day. 

      Darren and Berrick crack up.  

                                      DARREN
                          (on phone)
                    It's fun, but he won't last.

      Jack sighs, worried about his future.

                                                                                FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:


      LIZ POYNTON, 28, lovely, tough, works behind the counter. 
      She has a calm, bemused, tongue-in-cheek demeanor that tends       Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 14.
                     



    to charm the camera.  Like her brother, Darren, she's
      brilliant and bored with her job.  Jack is there, in a hurry.  

                                    LIZ
                          (likes making him
                            squirm)
                    So Jack, I hear you're the new Mr.
                    Fix-It.  Guess I'll have to start
                    dressing sexy for work.

                                    JACK
                    Are you flirting with me?

                                    LIZ
                    No.  Why?  That's stupid.
                          (brazenly looking him
                          up & down)
                    So you're stuck working with my idiot
                    brother, how's that going?

                                    JACK
                    We got stuff to work out.  He calls
                    me pimp juice--

    He does a double take, seeing Ellis is inexplicably there in
      his wheelchair but forges on...

                                    JACK (CONT'D)
                    I need sample decking for a bid. 
                    Krexboard, Composite, Fairdeck,--

                    Just Grello, right?  

                                    JACK
                    Krexboard is recycled grocery bags

                    Just get the damn Grello!   

      Tony stands up from hiding beside Liz, eating a huge sandwich.

                                    TONY (CONT'D)
                    Clients don't need choices or greeny
                    feel-good crap.  Do what works and
                    move on.  And stop hitting on Liz. 

                                    JACK
                    She was hitting on me.

                                    LIZ
                    I was just helping you pick, then
                    you came on to me, kind of strong.

                                    JACK
                    I did not!
                          (to Tony)
                    Are you just down here all day waiting
                    for me to come in and screw up?

                                    TONY
                    I had time on my hands.  Plus other
                    guys came in and screwed up too. 
                    It's been a productive morning.
                          (sees the front door)
                    Crap.

      Tony ducks behind the counter as Terry comes in.

                                      TERRY
                    Too late.  I saw you.  Why am taking 
                    days off from the spa to nurse you
                    to health if you're gonna sneak
                    downtown to fondle tools?

                                    TONY
                    No, that's your job at the spa. 

                                      TERRY
                    I am a licensed masseuse!

                                                                                  CUT TO:      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 16.
                     




                                    JACK
                    Here's the deal.  I'm firing him!

      The family eats -- Terry slapping Tony's hand as he reaches
      for rolls.  Mason practices formal (West Point) table manners.  

                                    JACK (CONT'D)
                    He's crude, disrespectful,
                      unprofessional and he stinks up the
                    van with his coconut skin cream --
                    which I think he also uses in relation
                    to a disgusting van library he had. 
                    He's got to go.

      Reveal Darren, happily eating with the family.

                                    TONY
                    You can't fire D'.  My best friend's
                    dying wish was for me to look after
                    the boy.  Now it's your job.

                                    JACK
                    The wish doesn't count if your friend
                    didn't actually die.

    We see ELLIS, catatonic in the corner in his wheelchair.

                                    TONY
                    He's damn close to dead.  In fact he
                    could be dead now.  Ellis, you dead? 
                    ...Mason, go poke him.

                                      MASON
                    Mom?!      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 18.
                     



                                      TERRY
                    I'll poke him, baby.  You eat.

                                      MASON
                          (to Jack)
                    See?  Our band could make up a sad
                    song about this.  Sad but positive.

    As Terry goes to poke Ellis in B.G.

                                    JACK
                    I need a new assistant if I'm gonna
                    take Mr. Fix-It to the next level.

                                    TONY
                    Mr. Fix-It doesn't want a next level. 
                    Mr. Fix-it likes where he's at.  

                                    JACK
                    He doesn't know what he's missing. 
                    I could really take him places.

                                    TONY
                    Mr. Fix-It gets motion sickness and
                    might just throw up down your neck. 
                    Don't change things.  Including
                    Darren.  Tough if you don't like
                    him.  That's business: Sometimes you
                    have to work with the man you got. 

      This is blowing Jack's mind.  

                                    TONY (CONT'D)
                    Frankly, you could learn from him. 
                    He knows the biz.  And he's fun.

      Darren sneaks a roll to Tony who quickly bites some and winks
    at Darren.  Darren and Tony laugh as friends.  Jack is deeply
      wounded, feeling like a third wheel.  So he slips Tony a
      pork chop, trying to be friends.  

                                    TONY (CONT'D)
                    Pork could kill me, Jack.

      Tony gives Darren a "Can you believe this guy?" look and
      they crack up again.  

                                      DARREN
                          (a rascal)
                    Won't kill me, though.        Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 19.
                     



      Darren then takes Jack's pork-chop off Tony's plate and eats
    it himself.  Tony cracks up.    Jack shakes in his anger as
    he glares at Darren.  Mason picks up on Jack's pain and out
    of loyalty stares daggers at Darren, too.  In B.G. Terry
      finally pokes Ellis into moving.

                                      TERRY
                    There he goes.  We're good.  

                                                                                FADE OUT:

                                    END OF ACT TWO      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 20.
                     



                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      CLOSE ON Jack as he gets dressed.  His face still seething
      with a spooky anger like a Stanley Kubric poster.  The image
    is scored with the sound of a woman humming.  

                                      MASON (O.S.)
                          (movie trailer voice)
                    "He tried being nice to Darren... He
                    tried being professional... 

      Mason sits beside Jack.  Terry is there.

                                      MASON (CONT'D)
                    ...But when Jack's dad sided with
                    Darren and not Jack... Jack's war
                    just got personal." 
                          (off Terry's kiss)
                    Stop, mom, I'm trying to pump up
                    Jack for Darren's butt-shellacking.  
                          (to Jack)
                    That could be our band name.  "Butt
                      Shellacking."   

      Terry is packing clothes into a trunk, and listens to an
      iPod.  (It's her voice we've heard humming during the above.)  

                                    JACK
                          (irritable)
                    I didn't say I'd start a band, Mason. 
                    And stop giving me advice.  I'm a
                    grown man.  You don't understand my
                    situation.

                                      MASON
                    Oh.  Okay.  I was only thinking how
                    I want to shellack my dad's stupid
                    Army unit.  He re-enlisted saying he
                    missed them which means he sort of
                    likes those guys more than me. 
                          (off Jack's concern)
                    Oh, it's cool.  I got you as a male
                    role model now, so I'm good.
                          (off him)
                    Stop.  Today's about your drama
                    anyway.  Forget I said it.
                                      (MORE)      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 21.
                     



                                      MASON (CONT'D)
                          (taps Terry to remove
                          her headphones)
                    Mom, can you cook a fun breakfast
                    that will cheer up Jack since he's
                    stuck working with a guy he despises?

                                    JACK
                    It's just he's got zero moral fiber,
                    zero self-development goals--

                                      TERRY
                    Jack, stop whining.  I like Darren,
                    but if you don't want to work with
                    him, don't.
                          (explains, sagely and
                            patiently)
                    Just because you can't fire a man
                    doesn't mean you can't make him quit.

      The guys are in awe of her brilliance.  

                                      MASON
                    Aw, yeah.  Shellac Darren's brain,
                    Jack.  Shellac that brain.

                                    JACK
                    Aunt Terry, I feel like I don't tell
                    you "I love you" enough.

                                      TERRY
                    Of course you love me.  How could
                    you not?

                                    TONY (O.S.)
                    I see that all my clothes have been
                    confiscated.  

                                      TERRY
                          (calls upward)
                    Yep.  And I locked up Jack's clothes
                    too, so you will be forced to stay
                    home and rest like the doctor said. 
                    I laid out an outfit of mine you can
                    wear. 

      Tony at the bottom of the stairs in a stretchy yoga outfit
      identical to the one Terry wears but it's way small on him.

                                    TONY
                    Ellis is gonna see this and pee
                    himself.       Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 22.
                     



                                      TERRY
                    Well, he'd do that anyway.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Darren waits on the curb with his 40 oz.  The van pulls over. 
      Darren gets in and Jack acts cool, Clint Eastwood style.  

                                    JACK
                    Ditch the beer.

                                      DARREN
                    It's coffee.

                                    JACK
                    I'm not your clown.  Ditch the beer.  

                                      DARREN
                    You got to relax, big-baller.  That
                    kind of tense, trying-too-hard is
                    probably why you mess up careers.

      Jack glares then snatches the forty-ounce.

                                    JACK
                    Mind your business how I mess up,
                    we're ditching your stupid beer.
                          (notices fluid)
                    Huh?  It's coffee.  Why the hell do
                    you have coffee in a forty-ounce?!

                                      DARREN
                    I owe a guy money -- he sees me
                    standing out here with coffee, he
                    knows I got a job.  He sees me with
                    a forty in the morning he won't bug
                    me.  Now I need some coffee. 
                          (takes Jack's, sips)
                    Hazelnut?  You go, girl.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Liz talks to Jack and Darren.

                                    LIZ
                          (looking Jack over)

                                      DARREN
                    We're driving three-inch deck screws.  

                                    JACK
                    You like deck screws?  Okay.
                          (to Liz)
                    We're shooting sixteen-D nails.  

      She rolls her eyes, picks up the phone to dial...

      INTERCUT WITH...


      Terry has yoga mats down and plays a yoga DVD.  She's in
      some yoga pose with Tony doing the same behind her.  Ellis
    is by Tony in his chair.  The phone rings.  Terry answers.

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:


      Liz is on the phone between Jack and Darren.

                                    LIZ
                    The boys need Tony to settle an
                    argument about the deck job.

                                    JACK
                          (leans into phone)
                    I want to shoot sixteen-D nails and
                    he wants to drive two-inch deck
                    screws.

                                      DARREN
                    Three inch -- he's lying!

                                                                  BACK AT THE HOUSE:

                                      TERRY
                    Tony can't be bothered right now. 
                    We're doing a yoga tape with Reba
                    McEntire -- they'll have to figure
                    out the deck job on their own.

                                    TONY
                          (alarmed)
                    The deck job?  She's a huge client.  

                                      TERRY
                          (without looking back)

      She hangs up and resumes breathing to country\new age music.

                                                      BACK TO THE HARDWARE STORE:

      Liz talks to Jack and Darren.

                                    LIZ
                    He's busy.  Use the sixteen-D's.

                    JACKDARREN
        In your face.  Tony likes deck screws. 
                                                    Why are you favoring Jack? 
                                                    You like him?

                                    LIZ
                    Not a bit.
                          (to Jack, super flirty)
                    You need a nail gun?   Bet you're
                    packing a nice nail-gun already.

      Darren views this with horror.

                    JACKDARREN
        You like me.That's definitely flirting.  

                                      DARREN (CONT'D)
                    Stop slutting it, Liz.  It makes me
                    ashamed you're my sister.

                                    LIZ
                    Good.  I spend my life ashamed I'm
                    your sister. 

                                      DARREN
                    We gotta roll out, Jack.  

                                    JACK
                    Is this a sore point?  When your hot
                    sister flirts with me?

                    LIZDARREN
          I don't.Shut up, man. 

                                    JACK
                    You really hate this.
                          (a la Darren)
                    Relax, daddy.  It's all good.  Have
                    a sip of coffee.

      Darren glares.  Jack finally has leverage on him. 

                                                                                  CUT TO:      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 25.
                     




      Terry happily sits in front of Tony and Ellis, facing the
      TV.

                                      TERRY
                    See, there?  Reba got that teenage
                    pregnant girl to meditate and it
                    lowered her blood pressure enough to
                    save the baby.  God she's good.

      Tony rolls Ellis up closer and pulls off his oxygen mask so
      his breathing sounds are labored and more audible.  

                                      TERRY (CONT'D)
                    Nice breathing back there, Tony. 
                    Glad to hear you're getting into it.

      Meanwhile, Tony sneaks off screen.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                    Want to really drive him nuts.  Take
                    your shoes off.  He hates bare feet.

                                    JACK
                    He hates feet, huh?  Interesting.

                          (taking shoe off)
                    What does "slow your roll" mean? 
                    Better question: what's your bad

                    Put the shoe back on!

                                    JACK
                          (picks up nail gun)
                    Really?  You want to take this up a
                    notch?  Because I--

      Pop-pop-pop!  Several nails wiz past Darren who screams as
      they break a window behind him, making Jack scream and recoil, 
      sending another nail into his bare foot.

                    JACK (CONT'D)DARREN
        Agh!!  Oh!  Oh!Oh!!  Agh!

                                    JACK
                    Why does this always happen to me?!

                                                                                FADE OUT:

                                  END OF ACT THREE      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 27.
                     



                                      ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      A miserable Tony is on a gurney beside Jack who's laying on
      the bench with his foot bandaged.  Terry sits on the bench,
      too.  Nick, the EMT from the earlier scene is there.  After
      a miserable beat.  

                                    NICK
                    We're not supposed to double up but
                    you're good customers so...

                                      TERRY
                    Thanks, Nick.  Thanks Vigo. 

                                    JACK
                    What's E.M.T. training like?  You
                    need book smarts?

                                      TERRY
                    I think you and Tony have some
                    emotions you need to discuss.  

                                    JACK
                    No emotions.  I'm good.

      Terry slaps Jack's foot -- he yelps.

                                    JACK (CONT'D)
                    Stop that!

                                      TERRY
                    Not until you communicate with your
                    father why you don't like your job.

                                    JACK
                    If he doesn't know then--

      Terry raises her hand to strike again, Jack blurts out:       Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 29.
                     



                                    JACK (CONT'D)
                    Okay, okay.  It's because... because 
                    I don't think he wants me around.  

                                      TERRY
                    Good communicating, Jack.  And how
                    do you feel about that, Tony?  

                                    TONY
                    I feel like choking my sister, Terry.

      She pokes his chest and he groans.  

                                    TONY (CONT'D)
                    I think he's quitting like he's done
                    a dozen other things.

                                    JACK
                    Why do you care if I quit?  You want
                    Darren to run the business anyway.  

      Tony just rolls his eyes.  Terry pokes Tony.

                                    TONY
                    Ow!  No, I don't.  Darren can't go
                    six hours without a hitting a bong
                    or polishing his knob.

                                    JACK
                    Then why the hell do you like him
                    better?!  I get that I'm a screw up
                    but so is he in other ways!  And you 
                    laugh and joke around with him.  You
                    only seem pissed off and freaked out
                    when I screw up.  Why?  

                                    TONY
                    I don't know.
                          (Terry pokes him)
                    Ow!  I don't know. 

                                      TERRY
                      Communicate to him.

                                    TONY
                    Because you're my son!  Ya happy?!  

                                    JACK
                    I'm your son?  That's it?!      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 30.
                     



                                    TONY
                    It's the best I got!  I'm not a
                    shrink! I'm a tool guy, Jack!  Can
                    we stop talking like fruitloops now?

      The van takes a hard right and Jack rolls off his bench onto
      the floor.  As Nick and Terry pull him up...

                                    NICK
                    This is why we shouldn't double up.

                                    JACK
                          (getting back on bench)
                    Dad, I get that I haven't made you
                    proud much.  But would it have killed
                    you to give me one word of
                      encouragement, just one, to show
                    you're glad I'm here trying?  I don't
                    even know if you want me living in
                    your basement.  Do you?!

      Jack waits, tears forming.  Tony has them too but can't speak.
      Terry pokes Tony hard.

                                    JACK (CONT'D)
                    It doesn't count if you have to poke
                    him!

      The van takes another hard right and Jack rolls off again.

                                    JACK (CONT'D)
                    Son of bitch!

                                                                    SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

      SERIES OF SHOTS


      Jack, in uniform, eats cereal with Mason and Terry.  Tony
      enters in PJ's, sees Jack glaring at him.  Tony starts to
      speak, can't, and merely takes a newspaper and goes.  Jack
      shakes his head, disgusted, tosses his spoon down and goes.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Jack goes downstairs and is again startled by firecrackers.

                                      MASON (V.O.)
                          (speaking his lyrics)
                    "Some dads know the perfect thing to
                    say." 

    He finds his shitty basement has been transformed.  Tony is
      finishing putting up some walls, including a retractable
      divider wall.  

                                      MASON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    "But those guys prob'ly suck with
                    tools."

      Mason is psyched, giving a big thumbs up.  Tony and Jack
      make eye contact.  Tony starts to say something emotional,
      but he's too macho, so he simply nods a self-conscious "hi"
      and keeps painting.      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 32.
                     



                                      MASON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    "Nobody gets a perfect father.  Which
                    stinks but it's a rule. 

      Jack then sees Darren there helping out!  Jack is touched.  

                                    JACK
                    This was your other gig?

                                      DARREN
                    Thought we could stand to cool off.

      Darren gives him a contrite nod -- both men's eyes say, "I'm
      sorry," and Darren offers Jack a piece of molding to install. 

                                      MASON (V.O.)
                    "Like any hard partnership -- at
                    work or where you're livin'..."  

      Jack smiles at Darren then at Tony who continues working. 

                                      MASON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    "...You get what you get, so don't
                    get upset.   Work with the man you're
                    given."   

      Jack feels better and begins to install the molding.

                                      MASON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    "You gotta work with the man you're
                    given."   

      The three men keep working side-by-side as Mason and Terry
      hang pictures.  The song that's been playing under all of
      this segues to amateur bass guitar, and we...

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      A WHILE LATER

      Mason reads his lyrics as Jack happily plays bass in their
      new room.  A picture we assume is Mason's father in uniform
      hangs over him.  

                                      MASON (CONT'D)
                    "Oh yeah...  Dance-dance, y'all... 
                    Work with the man you're given."
                          (stops reading)
                    That's the chorus -- then I solo on
                    beat-box flute.      Bobby Bowman  "White Van Man"           1/9/12 33.
                     



      Mason starts playing beat-box flute to Jack's bass line.  
      Mason is great in an oddball way like Napoleon Dynamite's
      dancing.  Jack smiles at him, glad he's there.  

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Music drifts up from below as Terry and Tony share a beer.

                                      TERRY
                    Tomorrow no work.  We do yoga.

                                    TONY
                    I'll bend over and you can kiss my...

    He gets his lemon-squint, heart-pain look.

                                    TONY (CONT'D)
                    Yoga.  Okay.

                                                                                FADE OUT.
