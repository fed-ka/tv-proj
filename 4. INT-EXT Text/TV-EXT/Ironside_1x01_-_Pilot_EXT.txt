      The City by the Bay is quiet this night as fog rolls in 
      under the Golden Gate Bridge.  An aerial shot: Trocodero 
        Plaza, PAC BELL, Lombard Street, past a cable car...the 
        camera lands on the world-famous Transamerica building...



      On the street below...a homeless woman s squeaky carriage is 
      the only sound that emanates from the quiet streets of the 
        Financial District..SUDDENLY, a body FLIES from the twenty-
      fifth floor of the office building, plummeting head-over-
        heels, like a rag-doll. The body floats, dream-like, until 
      it lands on Merchant Street with an ALL-TOO-REAL-THUD.  An 
        amoeba-shaped pond of blood spreads from her torso...ANNIE 
        RYAN S life is over. 



        A section of the parking lot is cordoned off by yellow CRIME 
      SCENE TAPE.  The crowd parts like the Red Sea as MARLEY, 
        walking next to Ironside, moves through the chaos. MARLEY, 
      5  10 , a statuesque beauty, is, we will come to see, all 
        things to Ironside -- but mostly the sobering yang to his 
        raging yin.  

      She and Ironside head toward the building, where they are 
        IMMEDIATELY flanked by two DETECTIVES who seem to have 
        appeared out of nowhere. By the way they re dressed, THEY 
        APPEAR to have been summoned from other engagements...                                                                                       5.


        TEDDY, 30, is unusually stylish for a police officer in 
        expensive designer boots and jeans; and VIRGIL, 35, whose 
        reputation as one of the toughest cops in the city might be 
      hard to see at this moment, as he s wearing a black leather 
        jacket over a pajama shirt, his sleepy face still marked with 
      sheet lines. We walk along with them as they make their way 
        through the CROWD, when a third member of their team parts 
      the mass of people like a linebacker... 

                                    HOLLY (O.S.)
                      Outta the way!  Watch it! 

        ...but she s a petite, beautiful detective who looks like 
      she just came from a date. Holly, 28, fresh-faced; 
        energetic. 

                                    HOLLY (CONT D)
                          (to Virgil)
                      Nice pajamas.  I can t believe the 
                      Mrs. let you out after dark. 

                                    VIRGIL
                      Nice lipstick.  What was his name? 

                                    HOLLY
                      Steve Something.  He thinks I m in 
                      the bathroom. 
                            (winks at him)
                      He ll wait. 

                                    TEDDY
                            (looking up)
                      I vowed never to set foot in an 
                      investment bank again. 

                                    HOLLY
                      Why?  Do you have your trust fund 
                      money delivered to your house? 

                                    TEDDY
                      Something like that. 

        Ironside and his team glide by the sheet-covered body, each 
      of them taking a long look as they pass, continuing toward 
      the building s entrance. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                            (looking up)
                    It happened a few hours ago.  Her 
                      employers are big donors to the 
                      Mayor, who s the reason we re here 
                      now. That s all we know at the 
                      moment. Get moving.  

      And, just like that, their group splinters as quickly as 
      they formed -- not needing to be told what to do, they move 
      out to do their jobs.  Virgil melts back into the crowd as 
      he moves to check the perimeter;                                                                                       6.


      Teddy approaches the security desk; Holly takes the stairs, 
      and Ironside heads to the elevator.  He watches his team 
      with pride -- though he would never admit it to them. 



        Tracey barrels out of the door, but Ironside is right on his 
        heels... and tackles him in the middle of the roof.  They 
        wrestle, snarling like wild animals... Ironside fights dirty 
      and hard, clawing at TRACEY s face as he climbs on top of 
      him.  They roll over several times.  Gary, picks up a piece 
      of wood and slams it over Tracey s head.  Tracey s done, but 
        Ironside s not...

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Come on.  

        Ironside drags Tracey, by the hair, to the edge of the 
        building. 

                                    GARY
                      Throw him over.  Make it quick.                                                                                       14.


      -- and hangs him over the side-- 

                                    TRACEY
                      Man, don t do this! 

        Ironside holds his leg.  Tracey screams as coins, a comb, 
      and a wallet spill from his pockets, plummet toward the 
        street below.  Ironside shakes Tracey, could drop him at any 
      time.

                                    IRONSIDE
                      We re looking for Enrico Gonzalez. 
                      Where is he?  

                                    TRACEY
                      I don t know, man.  I swear.  I 
                      never met him.  No one has.  I tell 
                      you everything I know. 

      The pants tear... Tracey drops a little more...

                                    IRONSIDE
                      Gary, you think he s telling the 
                      truth? 

      Gary shrugs signifying he could care either way.  Ironside 
      let s him fall further.  Tracey screams. 

                                    TRACEY
                      Okay!  Okay!!

                                                            FADE TO: PRESENT DAY



      The free-standing annex with more-than-required wheelchair 
        access is known as the Wheel House, and is separated from 
      the main Police Headquarters by a small green. 



      In the driveway, Freddy is doing all he can to control 
        himself. 

                                    FREDDY
                    Do you have any idea who you re messing 
                      with?                                                                                       31.


                                    IRONSIDE 
                      No, but I m slowly starting to find 
                      out.  And to tell you the truth, I 
                      don t like what I m finding. 

                                    FREDDY
                      Sometimes, doing one s job requires 
                      a degree of unpleasantry.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                    My job is find out who did this,  
                      your job is to screw people out of 
                      money and get with it.  
                            (gesturing at the nice house)
                      Your nervous face against the imported 
                      tile on your porch makes me believe 
                      we re both doing something right.  

                                    FREDDY
                            (gesturing at the chair)
                      Understandably, your accident has 
                      made you bitter. I appreciate that. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Guess what, Freddy, I was like this long 
                      before a bullet shattered my spine. 

                                    FREDDY
                      I m sorry...

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      You re not.  You should be...for a 
                      lot of things, not the least of 
                      which corrupting a young girl...but 
                      I promise you...you will be. 

                                    FREDDY
                      OK, listen, I asked Annie to go to 
                      the Flower Party with me.  

                                    IRONSIDE
                    So saying you didn t know her too 
                      well was a bit of understatement, I 
                      guess.... 

                                    FREDDY
                      It s not like that. It s part of 
                      the rules -- you have to bring a 
                      woman with you, understand?

        Ironside takes out A FLOWER PARTY INVITATION -- 

                                    IRONSIDE
                    If not, it d be just a bunch of 
                      swinging Richards talking about pork 
                      belly futures.  Big shots doing 
                      things they d never do at home.

                                      IRONSIDE(CONT'D)
                    We found out all about it, and I d 
                      watch your wrinkled ass next time 
                      you re there...we might just raid it. 

                                    FREDDY
                      She came to one, and she hated it, okay?  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Did she know what kind of party you 
                      were taking her to? 

                                    FREDDY
                      Maybe I should have told her a 
                      little more, but her replacement 
                      had no such reservations.  And 
                      that s all I m going to say without 
                      a lawyer.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Whaddya need a lawyer for?  

                                    FREDDY
                      Because I have a lot of money and 
                      people with money need lawyers.  
                      I ve done nothing wrong. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Maybe you didn t kill her, but 
                      you re hiding something...guys like 
                      you always are...

                                    FREDDY
                      Guys like you have been gunning for 
                      guys like me since the beginning of 
                      time, but you always come up empty. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Yeah, but you ain t seen nothing like 
                    me yet.

                                            ACT III



      The FOURSOME walks the Streets of the Mission District on the 
        perfect night.

                      Before you, Melanie, he never 
                      invited anyone to his hockey games.

                      I had to go out with these two 
                      alone every game night. It s like I 
                      married Starsky and Hutch. 

                                    IRONSIDE
                      That s because most women don t 
                      understand the fine art of cross 
                      checking someone s face, like Mel.

                    on a damn coffee break. I d like to 
                      cross check his face. 

      He grabs her and kisses her.

                      I m gonna start to think he s a 
                      nice normal guy...

        A blast of music floods out from a bar they pass.  Melanie 
        dances down the street singing.  Ironside looks at Gary and 
        Penny.... is she great or what?

                      I would have done the same thing. 

        Ironside laughs hard -- Penny does, too.  Ironside grabs 
        Melanie kisses her passionately, lovingly.  



      Ed walks with Ironside down the prison corridor.   

                                    ED
                    He begged us not to call his 
                      family.  You re the only one he 
                      wanted to talk to.                                                                                      36.


                                    IRONSIDE 
                      What d he do? 

                                    ED
                      Attempted robbery.  

                                    IRONSIDE
                      Jesus Christ. 

                                    ED
                      Didn t even try to get away.  
                      Wanted to be caught. 

      They move down to the end of corridor where GARY STANTON, 
      his ex-partner, but looking years older than the two since 
      we ve last seen him -- lies curled in the corner, drunk, 
        sleeping. 

                                    ED (CONT D)
                    We all feel for him...and I ve seen 
                      this behavior before...where partners 
                      are hurt...you know...or worse. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                            (they really are friends)
                      What do I do here, Ed? 

                                    ED
                      I wish there was a simple answer.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Thanks for calling.  

                                    ED
                      Get him home.  



        ...the dark alley...he sees Enrico running past the 
          dumpsters....SUDDENLY A SHOT LIGHTS UP THE NIGHT...ROBERT 
      KEEPS RUNNING TO THE END OF THE ALLEY, WHERE ENRICO LIES 
      DEAD IN POOL OF BLOOD -- GARY STANDING OVER HIM.   

                                    IRONSIDE
                      What the hell did you do? 

      Gary offers no response. 



        Marley continues to push Ironside away from the building. 

                                    MARLEY
                      Was that was really necessary?  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      No, but it was fun.  

                                    MARLEY
                    So what did you say to the Mayor? 

                                    IRONSIDE
                      I told him I had a file on him. 

                                    MARLEY
                      You don t have a file on him.  

                                    IRONSIDE
                    He doesn t know that. 

                                    MARLEY
                      Just when I think I know everything 
                      about you.   

                                    IRONSIDE
                      I warned you...
                            (then, his face falling 
                            into great seriousness)
                      They want evidence...they ll get 
                      evidence.                                                                                      47.



      Omar is running down the street.  He turns the corner.  
        Starts running again.  A cop car skids to a stop.  Virgil 
      pops out. Omar sees him and starts running again.  Virgil 
      runs through traffic. Dodging cars.   



      We pick up OMAR -- his face scrunched up in terror -- the 
        camera corkscrews around and we see the reason for his 
        distress -- HE S DANGLING JUST OVER THE EDGE OF A ROOFTOP... 
      NOW WE SEE WHERE VIRGIL GETS HIS REPUTATION.

      This scene is eerily reminiscent to Ironside hanging Tracey 
      off the building.  Virgil is holding him by the legs...

                                    OMAR
                      Please, please! 

                                    VIRGIL
                      Who was up there with her that night?   

                                    OMAR
                      I don t know...help! 

                                    VIRGIL
                      Nobody s gonna help you. 
                            (then, angry, gives him a 
                              little shake)
                      Why would you make me do this to 
                      you?

                                    OMAR
                      I m sorry!  Please. 

                                    VIRGIL
                      What are you sorry for? 
                      Erasing the ID file?  

                                    OMAR
                      Please, man.   

                                    VIRGIL
                      Who was it? 

        Virgil loosens his grip, and Omar slips down a few inches.  

                                    OMAR
                      Okay.  I ll tell you.  



        A group of parents are waiting around Ironside s van to talk 
      to him as he and Marley exit the rink from practice.                                                                                       48.


                                    PARENT
                      Coach, can we talk to you?  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                            (pissed, not in the mood)
                      Sure...I m always available. 

      But as he says this, he starts the process of getting 
        himself into the van...lowering the VAN lift. 

                                    PARENT 2 
                    We appreciate you sponsoring the team 
                      when it had no money.  But these kids 
                      have all worked so hard and they re so 
                      close... they re all gonna suffer if 
                      Nate doesn t play. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                    We established a set of rules at the 
                      beginning of the season.  What would 
                      I be teaching them if I let him play?  
                      It s out of my hands. 

                                    PARENT 3
                      It s actually in your hands.  
                      You re the coach. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I ll take that under advisement. 

      The last statement is punctuated by the van doors closing 
        behind him, perfectly timed.   



        Ironside wheels out into the night.  Heavy heart.  He stops 
      on the sidewalk, sighs, but a pair of perfect breasts move 
        across his (perfectly positioned) sight-line and bounce down 
      the street -- perfect ass to match.  A Jack Nicholson-esque 
      smile forms on Ironside s face.

                                    IRONSIDE
                      Oh, miss? 

      She turns with an inviting glance.  He swivels his wheelchair 
      on a dime and follows that perfect ass down the street.  

                                    END OF ACT V*
