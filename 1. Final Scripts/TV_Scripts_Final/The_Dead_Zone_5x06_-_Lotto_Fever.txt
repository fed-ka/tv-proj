11*INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - LATE AFTERNOON

      Johnny ENTERS lugging a suitcase and a carry-on bag.  He's
      not halfway in the door when the PHONE RINGS.  He drops his
      bags, grabs it.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Hello.


22INTERCUT - INT.  BANNERMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      It's Sarah.   

                                      SARAH
                    You're home.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Just walked in.

                                      SARAH
                    How was Boston?

                                      JOHNNY
                    Great, although I can't say the same
                    about my flight back.  You'd think a
                    guy with psychic vision would know
                    better than to sit between a screaming
                    baby and a man with chronic air-
                    sickness. 

                                      SARAH
                    I guess you're human after all. 
                    Listen, Walt was going to fire up
                    the grill and rent a few movies. 
                      Interested?

                                      JOHNNY
                    I'm beat.  All I want is a hot shower
                    and a soft pillow.  Rain check? --
                    Thanks.

      He hangs up, as the DOORBELL RINGS. 

                                      JOHNNY
                    Mister popularity.              DEAD ZONE: "Lotto Fever" - TEASER - 7/12/05 - PINK  2.



2A2AFOYER

      Johnny OPENS the door, as we SEE a nervous-looking man, BOYD
      LUMELY.  In his mid to late 30's, he's slightly twitchy.   *

                                      JOHNNY
                    Can I help you?*

      He pulls a large handgun and jams it into Johnny's face.

                                    BOYD
                    Back in the house.  NOW!*

      Johnny backs up.  Boyd steps in and CLOSES the door.

                                    BOYD
                    Anybody else here?

                                      JOHNNY
                    No.  Look, whatever you want, take
                    it.  I don't keep much cash in the
                    house, but... You can have my watch.

                                    BOYD
                    Why would I want your watch?
                          (beat)*
                    You don't remember me, do ya?

                                      JOHNNY
                    Should I?

      Keeping the gun aimed, Boyd reaches out and TOUCHES Johnny. *
      WHOOSH!*


33*VISION - INT.  CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY - A YEAR AGO

      Johnny's on a PAYPHONE in a small CONVENIENCE STORE - the
      usual aisles of junk food, kids playing arcade games and,
      over by the cashier, a sign reading "LOTTO: NOW $1,000,0000!" 

      The door chimes as BOYD bops in, clad in a POST OFFICE
      UNIFORM.  He's not as twitchy, certainly not as desperate.

                                    BOYD
                    How's it hangin', my old friend? *

      The OWNER, an older Asian man, just stares at him.

                                    BOYD
                    Y'know what you need?  Y'need one'a*
                    those fancy expresso machines.  Y'know
                    expresso?  Steamed milk?  Tiny little
                    cups? 



                                                                (CONTINUED)              DEAD ZONE: "Lotto Fever" - TEASER - 7/12/05 - PINK  3.

3CONTINUED:3

      The old man looks at him like he's from Mars.

                                    BOYD
                    Still can't speak American.  That's*
                    okay, there's plenty'a room for
                    every...
                          (as he TURNS, he SPOTS
                            Johnny)
                    What have we got here?  

      He takes particular notice of the Lotto jackpot, then back
      at Johnny.  He's got something on his mind.

                                    BOYD
                          (without looking back)
                    Take her easy. *

      As he drops the mail on the counter and heads off.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (on the phone)
                    Thank you, operator.

      Boyd steps up in front of Johnny with a curious smile.  Johnny
      smiles politely and goes back to his business. 

                                    BOYD
                    You're that Psychic guy. 

                                      JOHNNY
                    Sorry? 

                                    BOYD
                    Tommy Smith!   

                                      JOHNNY
                    Johnny.

                                      BOYD*
                    Right.  I never forget a face.  That's*
                    my gift.*

                                    BOYD
                          (offering his hand)
                    I'm Boyd.  Boyd Lumely.*

      With one hand on the phone and the other holding the book,
      Johnny just nods and smiles...

                                      JOHNNY
                    Nice to meet you.*
                          (on the phone)
                    No, not you, operator.*



                                                                (CONTINUED)              DEAD ZONE: "Lotto Fever" - TEASER - 7/12/05 - PINK  4.

3CONTINUED: (2)3

      Johnny turns back into the booth, as Boyd glances back at
      the Lottery sign.  You can see the wheels turning. 

                                    BOYD
                          (leans in close)
                    Say, John, whadd'ya think about*
                    helpin' a brother out?*

                                      JOHNNY
                    Excuse me? 

                                    BOYD
                    You know, shoot me a peek into the*
                    future.  A glimpse of the great*
                    unknown. 
                          (off Johnny's look)
                    Give me the Lotto numbers.  I don't*
                    know about you, but I sure as hell
                    could use a million bucks.

      Johnny smiles, then realizes he's serious. *

                                      JOHNNY
                    You're serious?  I'm sorry, but my*
                    "gift" doesn't work that way. *

                                    BOYD
                    No kiddin'?  

                                      JOHNNY
                          (on the phone)
                    Yes, operator.  Uh-huh.  Thank you.

      Johnny quickly jots down some numbers and hangs up. 

                                    BOYD
                          (growing agitation)
                    Seems like your "gift" worked well
                    enough to get your name on TV or in*
                    some fancy magazine.  But I guess*
                    I'm just a nobody, right?  A crummy*
                    civil servant.  Something a big shot
                    like you might scrape off his shoe.

                                      JOHNNY
                    That's not...

                                    BOYD
                          (on a roll)*
                    I know your type.  I been gettin' my
                    teeth kicked in by guys like you my
                    whole life.

      Johnny edges past Boyd, forgetting about his phone number.


                                                                (CONTINUED)              DEAD ZONE: "Lotto Fever" - TEASER - 7/12/05 - PINK  5.

3CONTINUED: (3)3

                                      JOHNNY
                    I really have to go.  Good luck.*

      Johnny quickly heads for the door. *

                                    BOYD
                          (shouting at him)
                    Aaaw c'mon, John!  Spare some of
                    that mo-jo juice for the little
                    people!  Even us losers deserve a
                    break once in a while!

      Johnny glances back one last time, then he's gone.

                                    BOYD
                    Jerk.*

      Boyd sucks his teeth, then notices something.  He grabs the
      book, as we SEE A SERIES OF NUMBERS Johnny scribbled down. 
      He looks at the Lotto sign again.  Then fishes into his
      pocket, finding a couple wrinkled DOLLAR BILLS.

                                    BOYD
                    What the hell? 

      As he heads to the counter to play Johnny's numbers...


44RESUME: INT.  JOHNNY'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

      Johnny snaps out, in disbelief.

                                    BOYD
                      Everything 20-20 now?

                                      JOHNNY
                    Those numbers weren't for the Lotto. 
                    It was the phone number for a Thai
                      restaurant.  I wanted some take-out,*
                    that's all.*

                                    BOYD
                    The point is, I played and I won - a*
                    million dollars!*

      Johnny looks at the gun,*

                                      JOHNNY
                    Why do I get the feeling you're not
                    here to thank me?

                                    BOYD
                    I'll thank you alright.  I'll thank
                    you after you get back everything I
                    lost.  After you get me back my life.

                                    BOYD (V.O.)
                    Sweet wheels, huh?


66*INT. HUMMER - CONTINUOUS

      Johnny is driving.  Boyd beside him with the gun. 

                                    BOYD
                    This baby's got digital-response
                    shock absorbers, top-a-the-line stereo
                    with real-time GPS.  And get this. 
                    She speaks Italian!

                                      JOHNNY
                    You speak Italian? 

                                    BOYD
                          (beat)
                    Not the point, John.  The point is
                    it's the best car money can buy. 
                    Top shelf all the way.*

      We now realize that Johnny has his cellphone in his left
      hand down beside the seat, as he dials without looking.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Look, you have to believe me, I didn't*
                    pick those winning numbers.  And I
                    won't be able to do it again.

                                    BOYD
                    I don't expect you to.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You don't?

                                    BOYD
                    You know how many questions there'd
                    be if the same guy was to win the
                    jackpot twice?  I got a better idea.

                                      JOHNNY
                    To make another million dollars?

                                    BOYD
                      Two-hundred thousand.

                                      JOHNNY
                      Two-hundred?

                                    BOYD
                    Actually, it's closer to two-fifty
                    if you add the juice.*
                          (off Johnny's look)
                    After I blew the Lotto money, I had
                    to keep the ship afloat.  So I went*
                    out on the street.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You borrowed money from a loan shark.

                                    BOYD
                    Not a shark, the great white monster*
                    himself.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Who?

                                    BOYD
                    Name's aren't important.  Time is. 
                    And he's given me until midnight
                    tonight to come up with the balance
                    or he's gonna disconnect my head
                    from my spinal cord.  All we need is
                    a quick $25 grand to get the ball
                    rollin'. 

                                      JOHNNY
                    And how do you plan to get it?

                                    BOYD
                    In time, John, everything in time.

      Johnny hits SEND, as we HEAR the familiar 3-TONES and...

                                      OPERATOR'S VOICE
                    I'm sorry.  But you must first dial
                    ONE...

      Boyd lifts the gun.

                                    BOYD
                          (agitated)
                    Alright, gimme the phone!  GIVE IT! *

      Johnny hands him the phone, which Boyd tosses out the window.     

                                    BOYD
                    I want you to listen to me. *
                            (matter-of-fact)
                    I have nothin' to lose by blowin'
                    your head off.  Understand?*

                                      JOHNNY
                    Yeah.

      A sexy FEMALE VOICE comes through the speakers.

                                      FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                      Avvertimento.  Il livello di vostra*
                    benzina e'basso.

                                    BOYD
                    What the hell?

                                      JOHNNY
                    We're out'a gas.

                                      BOYD*
                    You speak Italian?*

      Johnny gestures to the fuel gauge, which reads near EMPTY. 
      Boyd bites his lip, then glances up...*

      POV - SELF-SERVE GAS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON

      A seemingly empty station.*

                                    BOYD (O.S.)
                    Pull in up here.  And nothin' crazy.*


77EXT. GAS N' GO PUMP - MOMENTS LATER

      Johnny and Boyd get out of the Hummer.  There's nobody around
      except the STATION ATTENDANT inside his glass cubicle.  Johnny
      checks the gas cap, but it's locked.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Keys?*

      Boyd takes the keys and tosses them.  As Johnny sorts through*
      them, WHOOSH...


88*VISION - INT. BOYD'S MANSION - LIVING ROOM - DAY - A YEAR AGO

      Vision Johnny watches as Boyd uses the SAME KEY to unlock
      the door to the MANSION he's bought for wife MARSHA (30) and
      daughter EMILY (10).  They step into the large FOYER.*

                                    BOYD
                    Well?  Did I lie?  Or is it everything
                    we ever dreamed about?

                                      MARSHA
                          (not very happy)
                    It's so... big. *

                                    BOYD
                    And it's all for you and Em. *

      He kisses her, but she doesn't seem completely sold.


99RESUME - EXT. GAS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON

      Johnny snaps out.  Are there more glimpses of this crazy on
      this key-ring?  Boyd is busy buffing out a fender scratch.

      Johnny TOUCHES ANOTHER KEY, as... WHOOSH! 


1010VISION - EXT. CAR DEALERSHIP - DAY - A YEAR AGO

      Now Boyd is buying the Hummer.  He wears a slightly gaudy*
      looking three-piece suit.  Vision Johnny OBSERVES...*

                                      SALESMAN
                    If you put down another ten thousand*
                    I can cut those monthly payments for*
                    you.*

                                    BOYD
                    Do I look like the kind'a man that*
                    can't pay his debts? *
                          (pulls a wad of cash)
                    You wouldn't have change for a*
                    thousand, would ya?  *


1111RESUME - JOHNNY

      As he touches ANOTHER KEY, WHOOSH!


1212VISION - INT. POST OFFICE - DAY - A YEAR AGO

      Boyd is OPENING HIS LOCKER AT WORK.  Vision Johnny and a few*
      of his co-workers watch, as he takes everything out, dumps
      it on the floor, squirts lighter fluid over it and LIGHTS IT*
      ON FIRE.

                                      BOYD*
                    They can take their crummy pension*
                    plan and their lousy medical benefits*
                    and shove'm where the sun don't shine. *
                    I quit!  *

      He seems very full of himself... *


1313RESUME - EXT. GAS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON

      Johnny snaps out again and touches one last KEY...            DEAD ZONE: "Lotto Fever" - ACT ONE - 7/12/05 - PINK  11.*



1414VISION - INT.  BOYD'S MANSION - NIGHT - TWO MONTHS AGO

      Vision Johnny watches as Boyd sneaks in through a side door. *
      Marsha is waiting for him.  He's obviously drunk.

                                      MARSHA
                    Where have you been? 

                                    BOYD
                    Out.

                                      MARSHA
                    At 3 o'clock in the morning? 

                                    BOYD
                    I was with friends.

                                      MARSHA
                    You mean, the leeches.  The man from*
                    the bank called again about the*
                    mortgage payments.  I told you we*
                    shouldn't have borrowed so much.*

                                      BOYD*
                    It's nothing.  I'll take care of it*
                      tomorrow... *

      He STUMBLES, then FALLS.

                                      MARSHA
                    You're drunk.  You're always drunk.


1515*RESUME - EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

      Johnny flashes out as he looks over at Boyd, who now has his*
      wallet out, staring at a WORN SNAPSHOT.  He suddenly looks
      less like a crazed kidnapper and more like a simple man*
        overwhelmed.   

                                      JOHNNY
                    Your family?*

                    How do they feel about all this?

      Boyd's melancholy mood shifts back into kidnap mode.*

                                    BOYD
                          (edgy)
                    Never mind how they feel.*

                    You don't worry about how they feel. *
                          (beat)
                    I want you to take your clothes off.

                                      JOHNNY*
                          (taken aback)*
                    Do what?*

                                      BOYD*
                    You heard me. *

                                      JOHNNY
                    Listen, you can point that gun at me*
                    all you want, but there's a few things
                    I'm prepared to die for.

                                    BOYD
                    What?
                          (suddenly realizes)
                    That's not what I meant!  Who do you
                    think I am?!

      Boyd opens the back door of the Hummer and pulls out TWO
      CLOTHING BAGS.  He hands one of them to Johnny.

                                    BOYD
                    We can change in the bathroom.

                                      JOHNNY
                    We?

1616EXT. GAS STATION - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      They both step out of the bathroom, now dressed in TUXEDOS. 
      Johnny wears classic black, Boyd is dressed in white.

                                    BOYD
                    Sorry you got stuck with standard*
                    black, but they only had one white-*
                    on-white left in the store.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I'll try to get over it.*

                    We need to meet a guy over at the*

      Johnny notices something in the distance.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I hope you don't mind walking?*

      Boyd freaks out and sprints across the lot.

                                    BOYD
                    Aw, geez!  Hey!  What are you doin'?! *
                    That's my car!

      Boyd helplessly watches as the truck drives away up the street*
      with his Hummer.*

                                    BOYD
                    WHY ME?!  I mean, can this day get*
                    any worse?*

      Boyd TURNS and notices...

      As it swings into the far side of the station heading their*

      Boyd reminds him by opening his jacket and showing him the*
      gun tucked in his waist band.  As the car pulls up we SEE*
      it's Walt.

                                    WALT

                    Walt.  This is a surprise.

                                    WALT
                    Back at ya.  Sarah said you just got
                    back from Boston.

      Johnny snaps out.  Boyd can tell he's seen something.

                    If you'll excuse me, I see a client.

                    I saw that look on your face.

                                      JOHNNY
                    If you think I'm stealing that guy's
                    money, you're crazier than you look.

                    That guy happens to be a crook! 
                    And, I look crazy for a very good
                    reason.

      Boyd puts his hand on the gun.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Why don't I just tell you where he
                    keeps the key, and you can go get
                    the money yourself.

2727INT. GYPSY CAB - NIGHT

      The ALARM SOUNDS.  Suddenly, we SEE Johnny and Boyd jump
      into the Cab.  Boyd has the gun in one hand, and a canvas
      bag in the other.

                                    BOYD
                    Y'call yourself a psychic!?

                    I can't believe it.  I just committed
                    armed burglary.

      Boyd digs through the bag.

                                    BOYD
                    Relax.  Besides, I was the one with
                    the gun.  Holy Mother of Mercy!

                      Congratulations.  Now you can just
                    drop me off at my house.

                                    BOYD
                    Nobody's goin' anywhere.  This is
                    just seed money.

                                      JOHNNY
                    'Seed money'?

2929EXT. FRONT OF TRACT HOUSE - NIGHT

      A TRACT HOUSE in a run-down neighborhood.  Three bedrooms,
      peeling paint... but the flowerpots have been planted with
      care.

      It's dark, as Johnny and Boyd stumble around outside a large
      front window.

                                      JOHNNY
                    This is great, now they can add
                    peeping Tom to my rap sheet.

                                    BOYD
                    Just move.

                                      JOHNNY
                    This is pathetic.  A grown man
                    sneaking around in the dark.

                                    BOYD
                    Yeah, yeah, whatever.  Wait. 

      Boyd peers in through the front window...

      POV - EMILY (11)

      As she practices on an old, second-hand piano.

                                    BOYD
                    There's my sweety.
                          (scowls)
                    Geez, I hate to see her have to play
                    that crummy old piano.  At the big
                    house, she had a brand new baby grand. 
                    The sound would rip your heart out. 

      Just then, HEADLIGHTS wash over them.  They turn to see a
      late-model VOLVO pulling into the driveway.  They're literally*
      caught in the act.

      Boyd's Wife, MARSHA, gets out.

                                      MARSHA

                    That's what I said.

                                      MARSHA

                    Never mind.  We were just leavin'. 
                          (to Johnny)
                    Move!

      They start for the cab.

                                      MARSHA
                    You don't want to see Emily?

      Boyd STOPS in his tracks, as we see real emotion in his eyes.


3030INT. TRACT HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

      The interior is like the exterior, a bit run-down but
      maintained with care.  Johnny sits at the breakfast table,
      Boyd next to him.  Emily is showing him some school work.

                                      EMILY
                    This is my last report card.

                    Really?

      Boyd shoots him a look.

                    After the baby was born.  Boyd had
                    this idea that he wanted to get into
                    radio.  Said he wanted to be the
                    next Howard Stern, God forbid.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (looks over at Boyd)
                    Is that right?

                    He enrolled in night classes at the
                    Community College.  Three full
                      semesters.  All A's and B's.

                    I'll tell ya why.  Same reason he
                    never finished anything, he lost
                    interest.

                                    BOYD
                    That's not true.

      It's obvious she's hit a nerve.

                    remember how much your daddy loved
                    you.

      He holds her tight.  Johnny has a sense that there's something
      strange about the moment.  Something very... final.

                                      MARSHA
                    Go on now.  I'll be there in a minute.

      After Emily leaves, Marsha just stares at Boyd.  It's obvious
      these two have a lot to talk about and Johnny's in the way.

                    I'll just wait outside.

                                    BOYD

                    Or I could stay here.

      Boyd notices a pile of loose coins on the counter.

                                    BOYD
                    What's with all the silver?

                    Tips?  Don't tell me you went back
                    to the Waffle Shack?

                    I have bills to pay.

                                    BOYD
                    I sent you money.

                                      MARSHA
                    I like to work!

                                    BOYD
                    No wife of a millionaire should be

                    You're not a millionaire!  You're a
                    mailman with a mental condition!

      Boyd swallows his anger, then...

                                    BOYD
                    You're gonna change your tune after
                    tonight.
                          (to Johnny)
                    Let's go.

      Johnny gets up.  They start out, as Boyd hesitates...

                    I'll never forget the first time I
                    saw you.  You were ridin' the roller
                    coaster with Shin Shimosawa. 
                    Remember?

                                      MARSHA
                      I remember.

                    You were the most beautiful girl I
                    ever saw.  Still are.
                          (kisses her cheek)
                    Take care of our little girl.

      Johnny and Boyd walks out, as the SHOT HOLDS on Marsha's
      face.  Something isn't right with this.


3131*EXT. VOLVO - NIGHT

      Tearing away from the house.

                                      JOHNNY (O.S.)
                    I just don't see why you couldn't
                    have asked her to borrow the car,
                    that's all?


3232*INT. VOLVO - NIGHT

      Johnny is now behind the wheel of their new ride.  Boyd,
      with the gun, rides shotgun.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I don't see why we had to steal it?

                                    BOYD
                    You saw the look in that woman's
                    eyes.  She wouldn't spit on me if I
                    was on fire.  Besides, the cops'll
                    be lookin' for the cab by now.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (beat)
                    You have a nice family.  A little
                    high strung, but... nice.

      As Boyd considers the comment, then...

                                    BOYD
                    LOOK OUT!

      A dark sedan pulls out in front of them.  He locks up the
      brakes as the SCREECH TO THE STOP!


                                                                (CONTINUED)            DEAD ZONE: "Lotto Fever" - ACT TWO - 7/12/05 - PINK  30.

      ANOTHER ANGLE - TWO MEN

      TWO BIG GUYS wielding baseball bats get out of the sedan and
      approach the Civic.


3333*INT. VOLVO - CONTINUOUS

      Johnny tries to restart the Volvo, but can't.*

                                    BOYD
                    Start the car!

                                      JOHNNY
                    I'm trying!

                                    BOYD
                    Oh, boy.

      Johnny continues to crank the starter, as the MEN approach.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


3434*INT. VOLVO - NIGHT

      RESUME SCENE.  Johnny still trying to START the car, as the
      MEN stand on either side of the Volvo.*

                                    GOON 1/LENNY
                    Outta the car, Lumely!*

                                    GOON 2/TEDDY
                    Get out or we'll drag y'out!

                                    GOON 1/LENNY
                    Have it your way!

      Suddenly they start SMASHING the hood of the car.  Boyd
      screaming at Johnny.

                                    BOYD
                    Quit screwin' around!

                                      JOHNNY
                    The engine won't start!  I think
                    it's flooded!

      Johnny grinds the engine, as Boyd seems to have a curious
      look of frustration on his face.  Actually, more annoyed
      than frightened.  Finally, one of the Goons SMASHES THE FRONT
      WINDSHIELD.  When it's clear the car won't start...

                                    BOYD
                    Okay, that's enough!

      Boyd throws OPEN the car door and gets out.

                                    BOYD
                          (checking the
                            windshield)
                    What the hell is wrong with you guys?!

      Surprisingly, the TWO MEN immediately back off.

                                    BOYD
                    What did I tell you?  Wave the bats! 
                    And look scary!  Wave and look!  Did
                    I say anything about smashin' up the
                    car?!  Well, did I?!

      These 2 seemingly dangerous MEN, suddenly appear like over-
      grown children being scolded by their father.

                                      TEDDY
                    Sorry.

                                    BOYD
                    Look at that windshield.  Do you
                    know how much that's gonna cost to
                    replace?  And that fender?  Who's
                    gonna pay for that?

      Johnny watches from behind the wheel with confused disbelief.

                                      LENNY
                          (points)
                    It was Teddy's idea! 

                                      TEDDY
                    Me?!  You're the one that went crazy!

      Johnny's heard enough, as he gets out.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Hold on. 
                          (to Boyd)
                    What's going on?  Who are these guys?

      Boyd hesitates, realizing the charade is up.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I asked you a question.  Who are
                    they?

                                    BOYD
                          (reluctantly)
                    This is Lenny Bitmore.  And Teddy
                      Carmichael.  They worked with me
                    down at the Post Office. 

                                      JOHNNY
                    Why are they smashing up your wife's
                    car?

                                    BOYD
                          (awkward beat)
                    Because I paid'm each a hundred bucks
                    to make it look like I was in danger. 
                    Just in case you didn't believe me.

      Johnny can hardly believe what he's hearing.

                    Get out of here.  Go on.  Show's
                    over.

      The guys look at Boyd, who nods.

                                      TEDDY
                    Sorry again about the Volvo.*

      They AD-LIB an argument as they walk back to their car.

                                    BOYD
                          (checks his watch)

                    Going?  I'm not going anywhere.  No,
                    check that, I'm going home.  And
                    then I'm going to call the police. 

      Boyd reaches for the gun.  Johnny sees it and walks towards
      him.

                                      JOHNNY
                    What?  You gonna shoot me?  Is that
                    how it is?

      Boyd raises the gun and points it at him.  Johnny hesitates,
      then decides to call his bluff.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Go ahead, shoot me.  Show me what a
                    big and bad man you are.  Because at
                    this point, a bullet through the
                    head would be a huge relief.

      Boyd continues to point the gun, then SQUEEZES THE TRIGGER --
      CLICK!  Then CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK!  Johnny shoots
      him a hard look, then walks back to the Volvo.*

                                    BOYD
                    What did you think?  I was a cold-
                    blooded killer?  I was Charlie Manson? 
                    I'm a mailman for Chrissake! 

      Johnny gets in behind the wheel of the Volvo and tries to*
      start the engine.  Boyd walks around in front of the car.

                                    BOYD
                    You want me to say I'm sorry?  Okay,
                    I'm sorry.  I wasn't sure you'd
                    believe me, that's all.

                      Especially not you.

      Johnny keeps trying to start the engine, then finally it
      STARTS.

                                    BOYD
                    Okay, you want me to beg?!  Okay,
                    I'm beggin'!  I'm on my knees!

      Boyd drops to his knees in the street, the headlights shining
      directly on him.

                                      JOHNNY

                    me here, I'm a dead man. 

      Johnny can see the genuine pain and fear in Boyd's eyes.


3535QUICK FLASHBACK - MEMORY FLASHBACK

      He shakes off the vision memory.  He throws the Volvo in*
      REVERSE, backs up and drives away in the other direction. 
      Boyd remains on his knees in the road, watching the car drive
      away.  Then about 75 yards away, we SEE the Volvo's BRAKE-*
      LIGHTS FLASH.  The car STOPS.  IDLES a moment.  Then BACKS
      UP.

      ANOTHER ANGLE - BOYD

      Johnny backs up alongside him and levels a glare at him.

                    Lie to me again and you're on your

      Boyd climbs into the car.

                                    BOYD
                          (climbing in)

                    Pop, this is John.  Friend a mine.

                                      LLOYD
                    I hope you didn't lend him any money?

                    I wish it had been that easy.

                    A man doesn't quit 'til his work's

                                    BOYD
                    Why should a guy with money work at
                    all?  Who wants to be a sucker, right?

      The old man TURNS and looks at Boyd for the first time.

                                      LLOYD
                    I been workin' all my life.  Two,
                    sometimes three jobs to put food on
                    the table.  That make me a sucker?

                                    BOYD
                    That's not what I meant.  It's just
                    I got plans, ya know.  Big plans.

                                      LLOYD
                    You got a wife and daughter.  There's
                    nothin' bigger than that.

      He goes back to work.  Boyd hesitates, then pulls out an
      envelope and sets it on the table in front of his father.

                                    BOYD
                    I just came by to give you this. 
                    That's four thousand dollars.  You
                    can take some time off.  Enjoy
                    yourself for a change.

                                      LLOYD
                    I don't want time off.  And I don't
                    want your money.

      Lloyd goes back to his work.

                    it.  I don't care.

      Boyd's about to leave, but instead, he grabs his father and
      hugs him tight.  It clearly surprises the old man.

                                    BOYD
                    So long, Pop. 

      Boyd kisses his father on the cheek and hurries away.  Johnny
      locks eyes with the old man.  This is getting weirder.

                    got until midnight, right?*


                                                                (CONTINUED)        DEAD ZONE: "Lotto Fever" - ACT THREE - 7/12/05 - PINK  42.

                                    BOYD
                          (head down)
                    So?

                                      JOHNNY
                    So you said the $25,000 was 'seed
                    money'.*

                                    BOYD
                          (head down)
                    Yeah.*

                                      JOHNNY
                    'Seed money' for what? 

      Boyd slowly lifts his head and looks at Johnny, we hear a*
      SECURITY BUZZER...


4444INT. BACK ROOM - HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Johnny and Boyd ENTER through a SECURITY DOOR, as they follow
      a well-dressed ASIAN WOMAN down a narrow hallway.

                                    BOYD
                    I realize this is a bad time to ask,
                    but you do know how to play poker,
                    don't ya?

      Before Johnny can respond, they step around a corner into...


4545BACK ROOM

      The room is smoky, as we SEE a single poker table under a
      powerful overhead light.  At the table sit an assortment of
      strange and dangerous-looking characters.  Off Johnny's
        apprehensive look...

                                    END OF ACT THREE          DEAD ZONE: "Lotto Fever" - ACT FOUR - 7/12/05 - PINK  43.



                                            ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


4646INT. POKER ROOM - NIGHT

      The game is about to begin.  The other players are a motley
      crew including a COWBOY, a VEGAS-WANNABE, a geeky MATH WIZARD,
      a preppie HARVARD-TYPE and a couple COLD-EYED MOBSTERS.  A
      DEALER (45) shuffles the cards, as a WAITRESS (22) serves.*

                                    BOYD
                    Just play tight for the first couple
                    hours.  And don't chase any flushes*
                    or inside straights.  Questions?

                                      JOHNNY
                    What's an inside straight?

                                    BOYD
                          (grimaces, then)
                    You're a psychic, right?  Hell, you'll*
                    probably see their cards before they
                    do.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I told you, it doesn't always work...

                                      DEALER
                      Gentlemen, let's begin.

      Boyd slaps him on the back.

                                    BOYD
                    Go get'm, killer!

      He shoots him a double thumbs-up, as Johnny reluctantly takes
      his place at the table.  He gets nothing but dead-eye stares
      and indifferent grunts.  It's obvious he hasn't got a friend
      at this table.

                                      DEALER
                    The game is no-limit, Texas Hold
                    'Em.  Good luck. 

      THE GAME BEGINS.  It's a QUICK-CUT MUSICAL MONTAGE as hands
      are dealt, bets are made... and Johnny starts losing his ass. 

      He even resorts to subtly touching other players, getting
      QUICK FLASHES off ASHTRAYS and DRINK GLASSES... 

      BEHIND HIM, Boyd downs a few stiff drinks, as his "only hope"
      blows every deal, as his stack of chips sinks faster than
      the Titanic.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Lotto Fever" - ACT FOUR - 7/12/05 - PINK  44.

46CONTINUED:46

      Finally, mercifully...

                                      DEALER
                      Five-minute break!  

      Johnny sits, a little woozy from the beating.  The guy next
      to him, a big man wearing a string tie and a cowboy hat offers
      his not-so-heart-felt condolences.

                                      COWBOY
                    Partner, I've seen some tough poker
                    beats.  But I believe you take the
                    prize.

      He chuckles to himself and moves off, as Boyd rushes up.

                                    BOYD
                    What the hell's goin' on?  You're
                    gettin' slaughtered!

                                      JOHNNY
                    Y'think?

                                    BOYD
                    I don't get it.  Aren't you gettin'
                    any info off the other players?

                                      JOHNNY
                    Plenty.

                                    BOYD
                    And?

                                      JOHNNY
                    Let's see... the guy in the leather
                    jacket is cheating on his wife.  The
                    kid with the pocket protector earned
                    his buy-in selling copies of his
                    chemistry mid-term.  Oh, and the*
                    thug with the cigar has webbed feet.*

                                    BOYD
                    Really? *

                                      JOHNNY
                    I told you, my visions don't always*
                    show me what I want to see, just
                    what I need to see. 

      Johnny turns and bumps into another player, the preppie
      looking HARVARD GUY.  WHOOSH!          DEAD ZONE: "Lotto Fever" - ACT FOUR - 7/12/05 - PINK  45.



4747VISION - EXT. ND LOCATION - NIGHT

      Johnny gets the MURDER VISION again:  Boyd being shot, on
      his knees in the grass as the PIANO MUSIC plays in the B.G. 
      Only this time we SEE a 2nd VICTIM - JOHNNY!   

      And when we PULL BACK, we SEE the killer is none other than
      the HARVARD GUY!


4848RESUME - INT.  POKER ROOM - NIGHT

      Johnny snaps out of the vision, as the now REVEALED SHOOTER
      moves away with a curious glance back.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I don't believe this.*

                                    BOYD
                    What?  D'you see a royal flush? *
                    Four of a kind?

                                      JOHNNY
                    Better than that.  I saw your hit
                    man.

                                    BOYD
                          (head pops up)*
                    What?

                                      JOHNNY
                    Let me guess.  You've never met the
                    guy.*

                                    BOYD
                      Everything was handled over the phone. *
                    Why?

                                      JOHNNY
                    Why?  Because he's here, that's why.   *

                                      BOYD*
                          (spins)
                    Where?!

                                      JOHNNY
                    Could you be a little more obvious?
                          (nods subtly)
                    The guy at the buffet.*

      Boyd steals a quick look,*

                                    BOYD
                    Mister roast beef?

                          (disbelief)
                    I'm gonna be killed by a guy with a
                    sweater tied around his neck.*

                                      JOHNNY*
                    How could he know where to find you? *
                    Did you mention this game to anybody?*

                                      BOYD*
                    You kiddin'?  What do I look, an*
                    idiot? *
                          (off Johnny's stare)*
                      I might've mentioned it in passing.*

                                      JOHNNY*
                    I knew it!*

                                      BOYD*
                    Look, it's my fault this happened. *
                    I'll just have to face it like a*
                    man.*

      Johnny is suddenly inspired.*

                                      JOHNNY*
                    Wait a second.  Maybe this is a good*
                    thing.*

                                      BOYD*
                    A good thing?*

                                      JOHNNY
                    Think about it.  Now that you know*
                    where the guy is, you can just go*
                    over and tell him you changed your*
                    mind.*

                                    BOYD
                    I can't do that.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Sure you can.  You just walk over*
                    there and you tell him.*

                                    BOYD
                    We don't have enough money.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Money?  What's that got to do with*
                      anything?*

      It's becoming obvious that Boyd has the last wild card he*
      hasn't put on the table.*

                                    BOYD
                    That was the deal.  If I decided to
                    cancel the contract, it would cost*
                    me double.  Ten grand times 2.  And*
                    best I can tell, you've got less
                    than three thousand in chips.*

                                      JOHNNY
                    Why would you do that?*

                                    BOYD
                    I was afraid I might chicken out. *
                    Hell, I figured with you playin'*
                    cards for me, there'd be no way I*
                    wouldn't have the extra cash to pay*

                    I guess now you have to win.  Or I*
                    really am dead.*

      Before Johnny can reach out and strangle him,

                    You better hope I lose, because if*
                    he doesn't kill you, I will.*

      QUICK-CUT MONTAGE of turning cards and clinking chips. 

      JOHNNY RESUMES his losing streak. 

      BOYD chews his nails and watches his future get shorter with
      every hand played. 

      At one point, The HARVARD HIT MAN catches his eye and WINKS
      at him.

      Then, as JOHNNY is down to his last thousand dollars in chips,
      something amazing happens: He is dealt 2 KINGS in his hand! 
      He can't believe it, as the FLOP is A, 7, 5, J and finally,
      K!  Johnny has 3 KINGS, with no apparent straights or flushes
      possible! 

                                      DEALER
                    It's on you, sir.

      Johnny and Boyd exchange a look, then Johnny and the Hit
      Man...

                                      JOHNNY
                          (beat, confident)

      Boyd nearly chokes, as Johnny slides his entire stack in. *

      One-by-one, everyone else FOLDS, except the COWBOY.

                          (to Johnny)
                    Cards, please.*

      Johnny confidently lays his cards down.*

                                      JOHNNY
                    Three kings.

      Everyone at the table is impressed.

                                    BOYD
                          (pumps his fist, low)*
                    Yes!

                                      COWBOY
                    That's a damn good hand.*
                          (slow rolls)*
                    But not good enough.*

      He lays down his cards.*

                                      COWBOY
                    Three aces.*

      The other players groan.  Johnny can't believe it.  Even the
      Dealer shakes his head.  Boyd can't believe it, as he looks
      over at the Harvard Guy, who isn't winking anymore.

                                      DEALER
                          (to Johnny)
                    Not your night, sir.

      As the Dealer reaches to rake the chips, his hand brushes
      against Johnny's and - WHOOSH! *


4949VISION - INT.  POKER ROOM - AN HOUR AGO

      Johnny gets a VISION of the Dealer setting up before the
      game: hiding TINY CAMERAS up in the edges of the table, fixing

5050RESUME - INT.  POKER ROOM - NIGHT

      Johnny comes out.  Holy shit.  The game is rigged!

                                    HIT MAN
                          (to the Dealer)
                    Deal me out.

      He stares at Boyd as he stacks his chips.  Johnny steps over
      to where Boyd is standing.

                                    BOYD
                    Three aces?  What are the odds?*

      Johnny knows it's now or never.*

                                      JOHNNY
                    Get ready to go.*

                                    BOYD
                    What?*

      Johnny steps back to the table and reaches under the table*
      and RIPS OUT ONE OF THE PLANTED CAMERAS. *

                                      JOHNNY*
                    What the hell is this?!  It's a
                    camera!  And there's another one
                    right here!  The game is rigged!

      The Cowboy reaches for the cable in Johnny's hand.*

                                      COWBOY
                    He's right!  It's a set up!

      The room erupts in INSTANT CHAOS!  People yelling and pointing*
      fingers as the table is flipped over.  Amid the melee, Johnny*
      grabs Boyd and hauls him towards the security door.*

                                      JOHNNY
                    Act sick.*

                                      BOYD*
                    What?*

                                      JOHNNY
                    You want to get out of here alive?*

      Boyd nods.*

                                      JOHNNY*
                    Then act like you're dying. *

      Boyd finally gets it as they approach the Bouncer.  He*
      clutches his side and begins to MOAN.*

                                      BOUNCER*
                    What's wrong with him?*

                          (on the fly)*
                    Uh, it was the... cheese.  He's*

                      I shouldn't have eaten the cheese! *
                    Awwww!*

                                      BOUNCER
                    I'm not supposed to --

      Boyd GROWLS like a rabid dog.*

                                      BOYD*
                    I think I'm gonna hurl!*

                    For God's sake, you don't want to*
                    have to clean that up, do you?*

      The Bouncer finally hits the BUZZER,

                                      JOHNNY
                    Oh, and I'm pretty sure the guy in*
                    the sweater has a gun.*

      The Bouncer hurries away, as Johnny and Boyd glance back --*

      HIT MAN

      He's caught in the commotion, but clearly COMING AFTER THEM.

      JOHNNY and BOYD take off.*


5151*EXT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT

      Johnny and Boyd come busting out of the stairwell door.*

                                      JOHNNY
                    Which way?*

                                    BOYD
                    To the car!*

      Johnny grabs him by the arm,

                    way.*

      They take off across the darkened garage.*


5252*EXT. PARK - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      Johnny and Boyd round another corner and STOP.  They bend
      over, panting and trying to catch their breath. 

                                    BOYD
                    Do you see him?*

                                      JOHNNY
                          (looking back)*
                    No.*

                                    BOYD
                    Maybe we lost him.*

      Johnny suddenly realizes that they're standing ON THE GRASS,
      exactly like in his previous visions of Boyd's death.  Then,
      we HEAR some familiar sounding PIANO MUSIC. *

                                    BOYD
                    You hear that?*

                                      JOHNNY
                    Yeah.

                                    BOYD
                    That's Emily.  That's my daughter.*

      As he TURNS, Whaack!  A GUN-BUTT KNOCKS HIM DOWN on to his*
      knees in the grass.  Johnny TURNS to find a gun with a*
      silencer pointed at him.*

      REVEALING the HIT MAN.

                                    HIT MAN
                    That was quite a show you two put
                    on.  Too bad you got involved mister,*
                    but I can't leave a witness.*

                                      BOYD*
                    Wait!  You don't have to do this!  I*
                    changed my mind!*

                    You got the rest of the money?

                                    BOYD
                    No.

                    Didn't you hear what he said?  He*
                    doesn't want to die.*

                                    HIT MAN*
                    We have a contract.  Besides, I have*
                      a professional reputation to protect. *
                    I go around breakin' deals and I'm*
                    out of business.  Now get on your*
                    knees!*

      Johnny and Boyd exchange a look, Johnny sinks to his knees*
      next to Boyd.*

                                      JOHNNY*
                    Just my luck, you hire a cold-blooded*
                    killer with ethics.*

                                    BOYD
                    I'm sorry, John.  You didn't deserve
                    this.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You're right, I don't.*

      He reaches over and puts his hand on Johnny's shoulder,*
      WHOOSH!  Johnny SEES something that we don't.*

                                      JOHNNY*
                    But maybe our luck is about to change.*

      Boyd isn't sure what he means, as the Hit Man cocks the pistol*
      and prepares to fire.  Just as we think it's too late, the*
      scene is suddenly FLOODED WITH BRIGHT LIGHT FROM EVERY
      DIRECTION --

      Johnny, Boyd and the Hit Man shade their eyes against the*
      brightness of the lights, as...*

                                    WALT (O.S.)

                    WEAPON AND PUT YOUR HANDS ON TOP OF
                    YOUR HEAD! 

      It's a stunning eleventh hour reprieve, as the Hit Man*
      realizes he has no choice and tosses his gun away.  WALT,
      ROSCOE and OTHERS MOVE IN from all around them with their*
      weapons drawn.  The Hit Man is quickly hand-cuffed and hustled*
      away, as Johnny and Boyd get to their feet.

                    and it would have been a different*
                    story.  How did you know where we'd*
                    be?

                                    WALT
                    After I ID'ed Mister Lumely from the*
                    gas station security tape, I contacted
                    his wife.  She said if there was any
                    chance of finding him, it'd be at
                    his daughter's recital.  Which is
                    going on right across the street. *
                    We staked out the area and hoped for*
                    the best.*

      Boyd notices Marsha, his father and Emily appear just off*
      behind the lights.

                          (taken aback)*
                    Boyd?  What are you... How are you? 

                                    BOYD
                    I'm good.  I'm gettin' there, anyway. *
                    I was just in the neighborhood and I*
                    thought I'd drop off your mail.

      Hands Johnny his mail.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You're back in uniform.*

                                    BOYD
                    Yeah.  It's all because'a you.  Those*
                    things you said in court.  They went*
                    a long way with the judge.  He let*
                    me off with probation.  Even let me*
                    have my old job back with a slight*
                    cut in pay.

                                      JOHNNY
                    What about the loan shark?*


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Lotto Fever" - ACT FOUR - 7/12/05 - PINK  56.*

                                      BOYD*
                    All the attention I got, it was in*
                    his best interest to keep a low*
                    profile.  He let me work out a payment*
                    program.  20 bucks a week for...*
                    ever.*

                                      JOHNNY*
                    Sounds like a plan.*

                                    BOYD
                          (beat, emotional)*
                    Best part is, I'm back home with my*
                    family.  I hate to think what I almost*
                    lost, ya know?

                                      JOHNNY
                    I'm happy it all worked out.*

                                      BOYD*
                    Yeah, well, I better get goin'. 
                      Schedules.  I just wanted to say*
                    thank you, John.  For everything.*

      They shake hands.  It's oddly moving.  Boyd turns, then...*

                                    BOYD
                    Oh, listen, I was gonna have a little*
                    poker game over at my place next*
                    week.  Some'a the boys from the*
                    office.  I was wonderin' if you might*
                    want'a play?*

      Johnny stares at him for a BEAT, then simply WALKS AWAY.*

                                    BOYD
                    John?  Aw, come on, don't be that*
                    way!  It's just a friendly game! *
                    We'll even let you use your super*
                    powers!  John!?

      We FADE OUT as Johnny continues walking away...*

                          THE END
