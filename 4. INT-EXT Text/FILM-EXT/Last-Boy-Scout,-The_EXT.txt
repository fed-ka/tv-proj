A deafening CRUNCH as a defensive back hammers a wide
receiver, nearly decapitates him. The ball rolls free.
The back recovers it.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
... Big Ray Walton puts a
devastating hit on Bricmont, so
Chicago turns over the ball with a
minute and forty seconds left.
The injured player goes by on a stretcher, moaning.
Cheerleaders jump and frolic.
BILLY COLE
gets up off the bench. The rest of the offensive unit
sprints onto the field. Cole walks. Straight ahead,
eyes front. Like a robot. His HEARTBEAT THUDS on the
soundtrack.
COLOR MAN (V.O.)
And so L.A. has a chance to ice
the game, no pun intended... And
you gotta be thinking, give the
ball to Billy Cole. He has had an
outstanding day, racking up 138
yards against a tough defense.
DOWN ON FIELD
The huddle breaks.
The L.A. team trudges through the snow to the line of
scrimmage.
Cole adopts a three-point stance.
Everything happens in hyper-real SLOW MOTION:
The snow falls. The receivers breeze past, in motion to
begin their patterns. Moving like gazelles.
Cole's fingers paw the cold earth. Gouging it.
He is like a spring. Coiled and ready.
The ball is snapped.
Turf and snow. Erupting.
A firecracker series of POPS as linemen collide.
Legs churning.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
The ball floats through the snowy air. Pitch-out to
Cole.
He takes it on the run. Tucks it under his arm.
Behind him, the quarterback bites the dust, leveled.
Cole turns the corner. Picks up a blocker.
Feet pounding. Arms pumping.
Up ahead, the free safety barrels toward him.
Low and
hard.
Cole does not blink. He reaches beneath his jersey.
Pulls out a GUN.
Pumps THREE SHOTS into the free safety's head.
The bullets go straight through. On the back of his
helmet.
A mixture of blood and fiberglass.
Cole keeps going, jogging for the end zone.
Around him, sound. Fury. Impact. Confusion.
Another defensive back. Straight ahead.
Reacts with almost comical terror. Dives to one side.
Cole FIRES. Blows out the guy's knee. Ends a career.
Keeps going.
We are now in full-scale panic.
The players are fleeing the field. Shouts. Pandemonium.
A few brave men gather around the fallen players.
POLICE
are on the field now. Running full out. They've got
riot guns, cocked and locked. Sprinting through the
snow.
Cole crosses the goal line.
Touchdown.
Drops the ball.
Turns, facing the cops.
His eyes are insane.
The crowd is screaming. People are running back and
forth like extras in the Keystone Cops.
The first TWO BLASTS from the cops' RIOT GUNS go high and
wide. One SHOT BLOWS APART the base of the goalpost.
The forty-foot-high monument pitches over, collapsing
like a wounded giant. Lands in a shower of snow and ice.
Cole is oblivious to the bars crashing around him.
He
smiles and says:

COLE
I'm going to Disneyland...
Puts the GUN to his helmet.
FIRES.
CUT TO:
We SUPERIMPOSE the legend:
WEST LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA
DECEMBER 20
Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. America, and all the ships at
sea. Welcome to another lackluster morning in Southern
California. Palm trees limp. Windless silence. 80
degrees at 8:00 AM.
CAMERA CRANES DOWN PAST a huge, rotting billboard. On
the billboard, a girl in tight jeans. Grabbing her own
butt. A surprised look on her face. Yes, honey, that's
your butt.
MOVE IN ON a tiny, weather-beaten bungalow. In the
shadow of the 405 Freeway. A shingle hangs from a
wrought iron post: JOSEPH R. HALLENBECK, CONFIDENTIAL
INVESTIGATIONS.
On the lawn, a late-model Plymouth.
The sprinkers come to life. Fling water across the car.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Inside the car, a lone man is asleep, arms akimbo.
Sprawled across the seat. Half-empty bottle of Seagrams
V.O. RADIO on, playing tinny JAZZ music.
Picture the
tiredest, meanest, grouchiest son of a bitch
self-hating
loser you can.
Now give him
a two-year-old suit from C & R Clothing.
Such is the
aforementioned HALLENBECK.
ANOTHER ANGLE
THREE neighborhood KIDS have gathered around the car.
Enjoying the spectacle of a sleeping drunk.
One tosses a baseball from hand to hand. One picks his
nose.
(CONTINUED)
6.
CONTINUED:
KID #1
Dude's trashed.
KID #2
Shit, we should do something to
him.
Kid #3 continues mining for nose eggs.
It looks like his
entire fist is up there. Pause, then:
KID #3
I know where there's a dead
squirrel.
ANOTHER ANGLE - BUNDLE OF PAPER TOWELS - SOME MINUTES
LATER
with a tail sticking out.
The youngest Kid holds it aloft reverently.
Looks in the open car window at Hallenbeck.
Still snoozing.
Dead to the world.
KID #1
Do it.
They heave the squirrel into the car and run away.
A pause. Another pause.
The sprinkler goes round.
Nothing happens.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Hallenbeck snores. The mashed squirrel perches on his
chest. A shadow falls across him as --
KIDS
return, scratching their heads.
Staring in at him.
KID #2
Goddamn.
Dude's trashed.
KID #3
Take his bottle.
Kid #1 smiles nervously.
Reaches in with infinite
patience.
Trembling hand inches closer and closer --
And closes on the bottle as, without warning --
7.
HALLENBECK
sits bolt upright and grabs the Kid and stuffs a .38
revolver in the Kid's face and cocks it.
HALLENBECK
Hey, motherfucker.
The Kid, of course, shrieks.
And the light of sanity dawns in Hallenbeck's eyes.
He sucks in a deep breath. Releases the struggling Kid.
Swears under his breath. Watches
the boys flee in
terror. Notices a dead squirrel
in his lap. Scowls.
Heaves it out the window. Pumps
a Camel into his mouth.
Lights it. Rescues the bottle of
Seagrams.
Thus begins his morning.
He opens the car door. The sprinkler douses him.
He gets out. Stands on the lawn.
One of the Kids, the toughest one, is standing on the
sidewalk.
KID #3
I'm not scared.
Hallenbeck scowls.
HALLENBECK
You're on my property, kid.
KID #3
Sidewalk belongs to the
government.
Hallenbeck stares at him.
Smiles weakly.
HALLENBECK
Excuse me.
He leans over and vomits on the lawn.
One hand gripping the car fender.
The sprinkler goes round and round.
A redwood beach house, mellow in the morning sun.
There was a party here last night.
Banners. Balloons and streamers. Tawdry in the light of
day.
8.
Hallenbeck emerges into the blinding glare. His tie is
crooked. His cuffs are too short. He looks like a
grouchy bear.
He looks up at the girl on the billboard.
HALLENBECK
'Morning, gorgeous.
Gorgeous does not respond:
Coy.
Very coy.
Hallenbeck slides behind the wheel of his Plymouth.
KEYS
the IGNITION. Phil Woods' SAXOPHONE fills the air.
He
looks at himself in the mirror.
(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:
HALLENBECK
(softly)
Nobody likes you. Everybody hates
you. You're an asshole and you're
stupid. You're gonna lose.
(pause)
Smile, you fuck.
He stretches his mouth into a grimace.
Pulls out into the street. Off he goes.
CUT TO:
A six-foot behemoth is seated in a jacuzzi at the far end
of the deck. He is dunking a terrified female head under
the water and laughing.
Jimmy clears his throat.
(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED:
JIMMY
Ho.
Ray.
The MAN looks up, annoyed.
RAY (MAN)
What the fuck you want, Jimmy?
JIMMY
What's with the girl?
She surfaces, sputtering and screaming.
Ray thrusts her
beneath the surface again.
RAY
Bitch won't blow me.
JIMMY
(pause, then)
Too early in the morning, Ray.
Let her go.
RAY
Fuck you. She's not coming up
till she starts blowing.
Jimmy swallows hard.
Says:
JIMMY
Ray.
Let her go.
RAY
Fuck
you, loser. What are you doing
at a
league party, asshole? You and
ol'
Dex Manley should get together,
swap
stories about gettin' booted.
Jimmy controls himself with an effort.
JIMMY
Ray, she's gonna drown.
RAY
Not if she blows me.
Jimmy's eyes are smoldering. He steps to the right.
Casually scoops up a football lying on the deck.
JIMMY
Last chance, Ray.
RAY
Go spit.
(CONTINUED)
15.
CONTINUED:
JIMMY
Fine.
Jimmy turns, as if to walk away.
Instead, he spins back and launches the football.
It sings, that's how hard he throws it. And when it
smacks Ray in the face, something breaks. It ain't the
ball.
The big man howls. Clutching his flattened nose.
The girl comes up for air. Gagging and choking.
Jimmy is at her side instantly. Pulls her out of the
water.
JIMMY
Get out of here. Go.
She goes. He leans over and grabs Ray by the hair.
The guy is bleeding. Delirious.
Jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart.
JIMMY
Best arm in the National League,
you son of a bitch. Remember that.
He lets go. Ray sags, semi-conscious.
The poker players come running as Jimmy walks back inside.
Jimmy gets into the car. Takes out his vial.
Spoons some powder, sucks it up.
A voice in the background: "Hey, someone shit on my car!"
Joe Hallenbeck slides his Plymouth to the curb in front
of a cozy stucco dwelling. Gets out, crosses the lawn.
A fat NEIGHBOR is watering shrubs next door. He waves.
NEIGHBOR
'Morning, Joe, how's it going?
HALLENBECK
My ears are burning, Andy. Even
as we speak, someone, somewhere is
calling me an asshole.
NEIGHBOR
You're funny.
HALLENBECK
I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th.
16.
The two men come out the back door and cut through the
hedge.
(CONTINUED)
23.
CONTINUED:
Miller's car, a Pontiac Sunbird, is parked at the curb.
Hallenbeck stops in the middle of someone's yard.
Holsters his gun.
A neighbor's dog approaches, happily wagging its tail.
Hallenbeck bends and ruffles its fur.
HALLENBECK
Where you want it, Mike?
Head
or gut?
MILLER
Listen, Joe, I --
(stops, sighs)
Gut.
Hallenbeck pats the dog. Straightens. Plants his back
foot and spins. Punches like a sledgehammer, into Miller's
gut.
Miller drops to his knees. Begins to retch.
Hallenbeck takes out a cigarette. Lights it.
HALLENBECK
If I see you again, I'll kill
you.
Miller nods weakly.
Gasping for breath.
HALLENBECK
So.
West Hollywood at seven, right?
MILLER
Huh...?
HALLENBECK
The job.
Seven o'clock, right?
MILLER
You still... want the job...?
HALLENBECK
It's two hundred bucks.
MILLER
Yeah.
I guess it is.
He climbs to his feet, still doubled over.
MILLER
I'm sorry, Joe.
(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED:
Hallenbeck says nothing. Miller turns and stumbles to
his car. Hallenbeck's face betrays nothing. A dead mask.
He walks back toward the hedge.
The neighbor's dog runs up, a tennis ball in its mouth.
Behind him, Mike Miller gets into the Sunbird.
Hallenbeck takes the tennis ball. Throws it.
The DOG BARKS and bounds after it.
Mike Miller turns the key in the ignition.
The CAR BLOWS to pieces.
An ERUPTION OF FLAME.
Flying glass and metal. The car becomes airborne.
Engulfed in fire. Does a lazy spin. Comes down.
The shockwave catches Hallenbeck.
Slams him ass over
teacups.
Windows blow in up and down the street.
Smoke and fire roll to the sky.
The DOG cowers, HOWLING in fear.
Beside it on the grass, the tennis ball is on fire.
Hallenbeck rolls to his feet. Covered with twigs and
leaves. Clothing scorched. Stares. Eyes glazed.
CUT TO:
A mobile crane hoists what's left of Mike Miller and his
Pontiac. Policemen direct traffic, curb bystanders.
OFF TO ONE SIDE
a UNIFORM COP questions Hallenbeck and Sarah, who stand
stiffly. Not looking at each other.
UNIFORM COP
Why did Mr. Miller visit your home
this morning, Mr. Hallenbeck?
Joe lies easily:
(CONTINUED)
25.
CONTINUED:
HALLENBECK
He came by to talk business. He
had a case he was to busy to continue
with, a routine surveillance. He
farmed it out to me.
UNIFORM COP
I see.
Is that all you talked
about?
HALLENBECK
Yeah.
That's all.
He looks the Officer in the eye.
Betrays nothing.
CUT TO:
NAKED, GYRATING BODY
Female, for the record.
Signaling us that we are now:
Starry, moonlit night.
A chill breeze.
Joe draws a
breath.
In front of him, on the wall of the club, is a poster:
BAYNARD FOR SENATE, it reads. Above the logo, a picture
of a benevolent-looking gray-haired man.
Hallenbeck regards it balefully.
HALLENBECK
I didn't vote for you, you bastard.
He looks away, and suddenly notices something on the
ground:
A half-smoked cigarette butt.
Just sitting there.
Joe stares at it. Thinks it over.
Starts to walk away. Stops.
HALLENBECK
You're a fuckin' lowlife, Joe.
(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:
He bends to pick up the butt.
A steel sap whistles over his head, missing by inches.
Hallenbeck spins, startled. Reflexively lashes out with
a flattened palm. Misses, chops the air.
Two more men, behind him. Nowhere to go.
A sap pops him behind the left ear. A sickening thud.
The world spins out of focus. He goes down.
Hits the pavement like a ton of bricks.
Rolls over, staring up.
Vision muddy, indistinct.
HALLENBECK'S POV
Three silhouettes hover over him, backlit by streetlamps.
Their voices are fuzzy.
HITMAN #1
That's him.
He was with her.
HITMAN #2
Shit, he's packing. What should
we do?
HITMAN #3
Get him away from here.
Then kill
him.
HITMAN #2
There's no contract for him.
HITMAN #3
Then do it for free. Just do it
elsewhere.
The men disperse. One of them drags Joe to his feet.
A stocky, crag-faced man. He jams a silenced pistol
in Joe's kidney and points him toward a vacant lot
nearby.
HITMAN #2
Start walking. I'm right behind
you.
ANOTHER ANGLE
The two other Hitmen return to their gray, late-model
sedan. Climb into the car and sit, watching the
nightclub.
Waiting.
(CONTINUED)
37.
A rusty chain-link fence separates the lot from the boule-
vard. Choked with weeds. Broken glass. A rusted-out car.
A towering billboard looms overhead, inviting people to
drink Scotch or get laid, it's hard to tell.
Hallenbeck staggers drunkenly across the lot.
The crag-faced man follows behind him.
CRAG-FACE (HITMAN #2)
Wrong place at the wrong time,
buddy, that's all it is. Just
want you to know it's nothing
personal.
HALLENBECK
That's what you think. Last night
I fucked your wife.
The gunman cracks up.
Hallenbeck grins drunkenly.
CRAG-FACE
Oh, you did, huh? How'd you know
it was my wife?
HALLENBECK
She said her husband was a
greaseball with bad breath.
The guy cracks up again.
CRAG-FACE
You're pretty cool for a guy gonna
take a bullet.
HALLENBECK
After fucking your wife, I'll take
two.
The hitman wheezes laughter.
Joe just grins.
CRAG-FACE
You're a funny guy. It's a shame
to take you off. Here, kneel down.
HALLENBECK
Are you kidding? We barely know
each other.
The hitman is now giggling, shaking his head.
CRAG-FACE
This is wild. I never shot no
funny guy before.
(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED:
HALLENBECK
You need a special funny bullet.
CRAG-FACE
Come on, cut it out. Head or chest?
HALLENBECK
That's what your wife said.
CRAG-FACE
Would you quit with the wife?
Enough is enough.
HALLENBECK
Ask me how fat she is.
CRAG-FACE
How fat is she?
HALLENBECK
She's so fat I had to roll her in
flour and look for the wet spot.
You wanna fuck her, you gotta slap
her thigh and ride the wave in.
(the hitman loses it)
Like the Pillsbury doughboy, except
when you poke her in the stomach,
she farts. I got a buddy he's an
archaeologist, organized an
expedition to her chin. They got
lost in her nasal hair. But
seriously, her eyes are like the
streets of Paris: crossed.
They're so crossed when she cries
the tears run down her back.
She's got back-tearia.
CRAG-FACE
(can't stop laughing)
Oh, that's awful. Buddy, you're a
fucking rio --
From a kneeling position, Hallenbeck flings a handful of
gravel at the man's eyes.
The man cries out. Stumbles backward.
And Hallenbeck moves like a coiled spring. Not drunk at
all. He takes
the broken bottle he's been clutching and
cuts the guy's throat like a knife through butter.
The hitman stands with a shocked look on his face.
Blood bubbling.
FIRES the GUN once, into the ground. Drops it from nerve-
less fingers. Stares at Hallenbeck, aghast.
(CONTINUED)
39.
CONTINUED:
CRAG-FACE
Bastard.
Hallenbeck meets his gaze.
A savage, feral gleam in his
eye.
HALLENBECK
And then some.
The guy pitches over dead.
Hallenbeck kneels beside him.
Retrieves his .38, holsters it.
Slips the hitman's pistol
into his waistband.
HALLENBECK
I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th.
He takes off running.
Cory and Jimmy emerge from the club into the parking lot.
She scans the area, shaking her head.
CORY
I can't believe it. The bastard
split on me.
(sighs)
I'm staying at a motel for a couple
days. Will you follow me?
JIMMY
Sure.
He heads for his car.
ANOTHER ANGLE
The Hitmen wait in the darkened sedan.
Watching Jimmy and Cory.
The driver keys the ignition. Starts the car.
In his lap is an automatic rifle.
Joe Hallenbeck is running full out.
Headlong down the sidewalk.
Gasping for breath.
HALLENBECK
Move!!
(CONTINUED)
40.
CONTINUED:
He slams into a man. Knocks him flat. Groceries fly.
Joe doesn't care. He stumbles. Keeps going.
Jimmy Dix is behind the wheel of a silver Jag.
Cory is driving a spanking new Ford Fiero.
Jimmy follows behind Cory, watchdogging. Humming with
JOE COCKER on the RADIO.
Cory comes to a red light.
Pauses.
Turns right onto a
sidestreet.
Jimmy slows, pausing at the intersection.
GRAY SEDAN
passes Jimmy. Accelerating. ENGINE REVVING.
Jimmy only gets one glimpse into the passing car.
It's enough:
Everyone inside is armed to the teeth.
The SEDAN ROARS around the corner, cutting in front of
Jimmy.
JIMMY
Oh God. This is a hit this is a
fucking hit!!
GRAY SEDAN
comes up behind Cory. Comes up fast.
Rams her car. Metal crumples. Meanwhile:
JIMMY
frantically floors the pedal of his Jag, pops the clutch
-- And stalls out.
He roars with anger.
Flings open the door.
Leaps out and runs forward, screaming:
JIMMY
Cory, get out of there!!
Too late.
Cory is already out of her car, yelling:
CORY
Hey, can't you fucking drive??
(CONTINUED)
41.
CONTINUED:
Her eyes go wide with shock.
The Hitmen burst from their car.
OPEN UP on full auto.
Cory is cut down. Blown backward over the hood of her
Ford. Flung to the street.
JIMMY
Oh Gooood!!
And without missing a beat, the Hitmen turn --
And OPEN FIRE on Jimmy.
He takes a running start.
Clears the hood of his Jag in a single leap.
BULLETS DICE the metal behind him.
He lands, hard.
Sucks the ground.
Huddled behind his
car, as:
TWO HITMEN
move toward him, triggering THREE SHOT BURSTS.
The kid is dead meat. Or so it seems until, without
warning --
JOE HALLENBECK
charges into the intersection.
Screaming bloody murder.
He's got a GUN in each fist, and both are BLAZING.
One Hitman dies immediately:
Dances like a puppet, racked by gunfire.
Bullets go through him. SHATTER the sedan's WINDSHIELD.
The second Hitman turns and OPENS UP on Hallenbeck.
Too late. Joe rolls behind a mailbox.
BULLETS chase him, blowing apart the metal box.
The Hitman swears. Turns, running for the sedan.
He knows when a getaway is in order.
Just one problem.
He forgot about Jimmy Dix.
A SCREECH of TIRES.
As Jimmy's Jag slews around the corner, laying rubber.
Rockets toward the Hitman, pins him in its headlights --
The Hitman screams as Jimmy plows through him --
And CRUNCHES into the gray sedan.
(CONTINUED)
42.
CONTINUED:
Shatters the Hitman between the two cars...
And holy Christ, the guy's still alive.
Pinned like a butterfly, legs broken...
He raises his rifle, screaming.
Jimmy dives flat on the front seat.
The WINDSHIELD ERUPTS.
The Hitman.
Still pinned.
Still screaming.
He FIRES SHOT AFTER SHOT into Jimmy's car.
Hallenbeck walks up behind him.
Puts a BULLET in his head. He stops screaming.
JIMMY
is still huddled on the front seat in a sea of broken
glass. Hallenbeck walks up, leans in the window.
HALLENBECK
Hey.
(as Jimmy looks up)
Back up.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Jimmy puts it in reverse. The car backs up.
Steam pouring from the crumpled hood.
The Hitman, now freed, collapses to the street.
Like a sack of flour.
Hallenbeck limps toward him, wheezing.
He stops as:
MOTEL MANAGER
stands outside a door marked OFFICE.
Holding a pump action shotgun leveled at Hallenbeck.
Hallenbeck nods at the bodies in the street.
HALLENBECK
It's all over, compadre.
MANAGER
Get off my property, mister.
(CONTINUED)
43.
CONTINUED:
HALLENBECK
(scowls)
Sidewalk belongs to the government.
He turns and looks at Jimmy. The kid is in pain.
Staring at Cory's bullet-riddled body. Eyes glazed.
Hallenbeck says nothing. He crosses to the shattered
Hitman. Kneels
down, fishes through the guy's coat
pockets. Comes
up with a bloody pack of cigarettes.
Extracts one.
Lights it.
SIRENS fill the air.
And Jimmy snaps out of it long enough to reach into his
coat -- Takes out the vial of coke. Ditches it.
Drops it down a sewer grating, out of sight.
No one sees him do it.
POLICE CRUISERS
come SQUEALING up, flashers turning.
Surrounding Jimmy, who stands, head down and motionless --
And Joe, who smokes and looks at the moon.
CUT TO:
HALLENBECK
What the fuck are you trying to
do, Tarzan?
JIMMY
He hit the chick.
HALLENBECK
You don't start a fight in a
police station, dickhead. Are you
really this stupid or did you take
lessons?
JIMMY
Guy shouldn't treat a woman like
that, is all I'm saying. He just
shouldn't, okay?
HALLENBECK
Why? Because they're weak and
need protecting?
(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED:
JIMMY
(pause, then)
Yeah.
He's serious. Hallenbeck starts to chuckle. Shakes his
head, lights a cigarette. Laughs through the smoke.
This may be the funniest thing he's ever heard.
CUT TO:
Hallenbeck walks across the parking lot toward his car.
Jimmy trots behind him.
JIMMY
Mind if I catch a ride with you?
HALLENBECK
Yes.
JIMMY
My car's fucked up, remember?
HALLENBECK
Take the bus.
JIMMY
Cut it out. Look, you sorta saved
my life. Let me buy you a beer.
HALLENBECK
I'm not thirsty. Good night.
He approaches his battered Plymouth.
Jimmy scowls.
JIMMY
That's it.
Good night?
HALLENBECK
Go home.
Get some sleep.
JIMMY
What are you gonna do?
HALLENBECK
I'm gonna get a message to the
people who killed your friend.
JIMMY
What's the message?
(CONTINUED)
51.
CONTINUED:
HALLENBECK
That we're out of it. That
whatever they're doing, they don't
have to worry about us.
JIMMY
You're kidding.
Joe gets in the car.
Says nothing.
JIMMY
You're backing off, you're not
gonna do anything? I watch T.V.,
what the fuck kind of private eye
doesn't do anything?
HALLENBECK
The kind with a wife and kid.
Look, it's over. My job is done.
JIMMY
Fuck you your job is done.
We
witnessed a murder, Joe!
HALLENBECK
Yes, it was very exciting.
Tomorow I'll take you to the zoo.
(beat)
You wanna play hero, go ahead.
When you die, I'll take your
closet full of eighty-dollar
shirts.
JIMMY
Look, until this is over, I'm
sticking with you.
HALLENBECK
The hell you are.
JIMMY
I'm part of this. We do something,
we do it together.
HALLENBECK
Have a ncie night.
He STARTS the CAR.
JIMMY
Don't drive away, Joe.
Joe puts it in gear.
Pulls away.
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:
JIMMY
Joe -- !
I'll tell the cops, Joe.
Joe taps the brake.
Stops.
Leans out the window, says
softly:
HALLENBECK
Tell them what, Jimmy?
JIMMY
That Mike Miller was fucking your
wife.
(beat)
Only reason you're not in the
cooler, tough guy, is the cops got
no motive for Miller's death.
When they find out Mikey was
dickin' your old lady, seems to
me you become suspect numero uno.
I'm scared, and I'm coming with
you, got it?
Joe gets out of the car and advances on Jimmy.
HALLENBECK
You little creep, I'm gonna beat
the shit out of you.
JIMMY
Go for it. Then the cops'll
really love my story.
(smiles)
You don't start a fight in a
police station, dickhead.
HALLENBECK
You and me is not a fight.
You
and me is a massacre.
JIMMY
Gosh, you're tough.
HALLENBECK
Get in the fucking car.
Jimmy and Hallenbeck make their way down a flagstone walk
between tiny, palm-shaded cottages. The moon casts a
pale glow.
HALLENBECK
Bet these places run a fortune.
JIMMY
Tell me about it. I'm paying the
fucking rent.
HALLENBECK
How charming. Sounds like a great
girl. What else did you spring
for? Clothes? Car payments?
JIMMY
Wasn't like that. Cory could've
had lots of rich guys. Me, she
loved.
HALLENBECK
Oh. Love.
Well, forget about it,
then.
JIMMY
Let me guess.
You don't believe
in love.
HALLENBECK
(lights a cigarette)
I believe in cancer. I believe in
love.
JIMMY
What, they're both diseases?
HALLENBECK
Something like that.
Jimmy shakes his head sadly.
JIMMY
Man, I don't want to meet the
bitch that fucked you up.
HALLENBECK
I'm sure she'd love meeting you.
Probably blow you on the front
porch.
JIMMY
Little bitter, Joe?
HALLENBECK
Eat shit.
56.
The two men approach the door.
Jimmy takes out his key
ring.
HALLENBECK
The cops are gonna want to check
this place out, so don't disturb
anything.
JIMMY
Yes, massah.
The two men emerge from the house. Joe heads for his
car. Jimmy peels off toward a battered GMC Pacer parked
at the curb.
HALLENBECK
Where the hell are you going?
JIMMY
As long as we're here, I might as
well take Cory's car.
HALLENBECK
You got the keys?
JIMMY
Yeah.
I'll follow you.
Hallenbeck starts to turn away.
Jimmy gets in the car.
Hallenbeck stops. Frowns.
HALLENBECK
Cory has two cars?
JIMMY
Yeah. This one's just sitting
here until she can sell it.
The color drains from Hallenbeck's features.
HALLENBECK
Jimmy, no!!
He sprints across the sidewalk and yanks Jimmy out of the
driver's seat before he can key the ignition.
JIMMY
Ouch -- !
What's your problem?
ANOTHER ANGLE
Hallenbeck kneels and peers under the car.
(CONTINUED)
59.
CONTINUED:
Swears softly as he sees two thin copper wires, glinting
in the moonlight.
HALLENBECK
They used a car bomb on Mike, it
figures they'd try it on her, too.
(stands)
Except they wired the wrong car.
Jimmy pales noticeably.
JIMMY
Oh.
Shit.
Oh. Jeez.
Hallenbeck claps him on the back.
HALLENBECK
Easy, kid. No harm, no foul.
We
caught it in time.
He strolls toward his Plymouth, whistling.
Cheerfully unaffected.
Jimmy catches his breath. Swallows hard.
Turns, and bumps into Hallenbeck, coming back the other
way.
JIMMY
What are you doing?
Hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire-cutters.
HALLENBECK
Gotta disconnect the fucker.
JIMMY
Whoa. Hold on. Um, shouldn't we
call the bomb squad or something?
HALLENBECK
(smiles)
Relax, Junior, I used to do this
for a living.
He isolates one wire.
Turns and offers the cutters to
Jimmy.
HALLENBECK
You wanna do it?
JIMMY
No, man, I --
(CONTINUED)
60.
CONTINUED:
HALLENBECK
Come on, chickenshit. Just snip
the wire.
Jimmy hesitates, then takes the cutters. Reaches beneath
the wheel well. Plucks at the wire tentatively. Cuts.
HALLENBECK
Oh, shit not that one!
Jimmy screams and stumbles backward. Lands on his ass.
Hallenbeck is chuckling softly. Shakes his head as he
walks around to release the hood.
JIMMY
You're a fucking asshole!
HALLENBECK
And then some, Junior. And then
some.
TIME CUT TO:
THREE STICKS OF DYNAMITE - ONE MINUTE LATER
have been taped to the car's ignition system. Hallenbeck
removes the taped bundle. Holds it up for inspection.
HALLENBECK
We'll hand this over to the cops.
They can analyze it.
JIMMY
Great.
So what now?
HALLENBECK
(shrugs)
You tell me, kid.
JIMMY
Give up?
Flee? Go really far
away?
HALLENBECK
I got a better idea. Let's check
in with my family.
They start walking toward Hallenbeck's Plymouth.
Hallenbeck tosses the car keys to Jimmy.
HALLENBECK
I'm tired.
You drive.
(CONTINUED)
61.
CONTINUED:
JIMMY
Sure.
Family, huh?
You got kids?
HALLENBECK
Yeah.
Little girl.
JIMMY
Does she like you?
HALLENBECK
Not much, no. And she likes
Prince, so go figure.
JIMMY
I like Prince.
HALLENBECK
Great, you can marry my daughter.
Or better yet, fuck my wife. I
hear all it takes is a credit card
and two valid I.D.'s.
(beat)
Open the trunk.
JIMMY
(indicating bomb)
You're just gonna stick that in
your trunk?
HALLENBECK
(nods)
You're right. Let's leave it
here for the neighborhood kids
to play with.
Jimmy opens the trunk. As he does, however, a voice
rings out suddenly from the darkness.
VOICE (O.S.)
Hold it right there, gentlemen.
They stop.
Slowly they turn.
TWO MEN
are approaching from out of the trees.
One holds a flashlight trained on Hallenbeck and Jimmy.
The other carries a silenced Beretta.
JIMMY
Is it the cops?
HALLENBECK
No, Jimmy.
It's not the cops.
(CONTINUED)
62.
CONTINUED:
Working quickly, Hallenbeck tapes the bomb to the inside
of the truck lid. Slams it shut. Turns, facing the new
arrivals.
The MEN wear tailored suits with matching ties.
One is tall and lean. The other is a bruiser, short and
stout. They both have the seasoned look of professional
mob hitters.
The Taller Man speaks, gun held rock steady.
TALL MAN
Good evening, gentlemen. Bit late
for a stroll, don't you think?
HALLENBECK
Yeah, you two better be getting
home.
JIMMY
The streetlights are on.
TALL MAN
That's amusing. How delightful
to find such amusing men so late
at night.
(beat)
I don't believe I've had the
pleasure.
HALLENBECK
No, I don't believe you have.
(to Jimmy)
He'd like to have the pleasure.
JIMMY
Tell him it's not for sale.
HALLENBECK
He says it's --
SHORT MAN
What's your name, fuckface?
This from the Shorter Man, who is clearly not happy.
HALLENBECK
(shakes his head)
I'm asshole. He's fuckface.
TALL MAN
Jake, apprise Rodney Dangerfield
here of his situation.
(CONTINUED)
63.
CONTINUED:
Jake slips on a pair of brass knuckles.
Steps up and delivers a looping right to Hallenbeck's
face. A sickening crunch. A two inch gash streams blood.
Jake relieves Hallenbeck of his gun.
TALL MAN
Perhaps we can dispense with the
fun and games now, yes?
Jimmy rushes forward, snarling. The Beretta swivels.
Jimmy stops, the gun aimed at his gut.
HALLENBECK
(gasping)
Easy... Jim... All they want is
the evidence...
TALL MAN
The evidence. Very smart. See,
Jake, he knows when a situation is
untenable.
(smiles)
You like that word?
HALLENBECK
Great word.
TALL MAN
It occurs to me that you may have
the evidence in question.
HALLENBECK
(spits out blood)
Give up, Jimmy. We're dealing
with geniuses.
Another fist to the head.
Hallenbeck grunts.
Spits more
blood.
JIMMY
Leave him alone, you fuck!
HALLENBECK
Back off, Jimmy.
The Tall Man turns and eyes Jimmy.
TALL MAN
Leave him alone...?
(shrugs)
Whatever you say. Jake?
The Short Man steps away from Hallenbeck. Turns and
launches a kick at Jimmy's groin. Connects. The kid
drops to the ground, retching.
(CONTINUED)
64.
CONTINUED:
TALL MAN
(sighs)
Ah, my young friend... I neglected
to tell you that Jake attacks his
job with a certain... exuberance.
JIMMY
Christ... I'm being beat up by the
inventor of Scrabble.
TALL MAN
He's still in a good mood, Jake.
Kick him again.
Jake steps forward.
HALLENBECK
Wait!
Hallenbeck speaks through cracked, bloody lips:
HALLENBECK
You want the fucking evidence that
the stripper had. I've got it.
So we can play games, or I can
hand it over.
JIMMY
And then you'll let us go, right?
TALL MAN
Sure.
We'll let you go.
(to Hallenbeck)
Where is it?
Hallenbeck meets the Tall Man's gaze.
Speaks softly.
HALLENBECK
Hand me the car keys, Jimmy.
Jimmy stumbles to his feet.
Looks at the Tall Man.
TALL MAN
Walk over and hand him the keys.
Slow and easy.
Jimmy takes out the car keys.
Crosses to Hallenbeck.
Gives him the keys.
HALLENBECK
The evidence is in the trunk.
TALL MAN
Open it.
Slow.
(CONTINUED)
65.
CONTINUED:
Hallenbeck smiles.
Shakes his head.
HALLENBECK
I don't think so.
He turns and throws the keys as far as he can.
They fall out of sight behind a cottage.
HALLENBECK
Oops.
I guess nobody gets it.
TALL MAN
You dumb bastard, you're going to
pay for that. Jake, open the
trunk.
Jake steps forward, drawing a .38 silenced pistol.
He is going to shoot open the lock.
ANGLE ON HALLENBECK
This is what he's been waiting for. He tenses, looking
to one side: next to him is a sloping hillside, angling
down and away. He grips Jimmy's wrist, signalling to get
ready.
Jake raises the PISTOL.
Take aim at the lock and FIRES.
The SHOT is SILENCED.
What follows is not.
Because the bullet blows through the trunk --
And hits three sticks of live dynamite.
SERIES OF SHOTS
Hallenbeck is already moving, pitching to one side,
throwing himself and Jimmy down the hillside.
The night lights up like a SUNBURST.
A tower of fire...
Climbs up and outward from the car.
The TRUNK LID is BLOWN fifty feet in the air.
The tires are pulped.
GLASS SPRAYS for fifty yards in every direction.
And, most importantly:
both hitmen are engulfed in
flame.
(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED:
SOUND. Fury.
Flames, rolling skyward.
TINKLE of raining GLASS.
Bits of falling metal.
All in all, a helluva blast, and meanwhile:
JIMMY AND JOE
continue to careen down the hillside.
Bouncing like rag puppets. Out of control.
Lurch to stop at the bottom.
Covered head to toe with dirt.
Bruised.
Bloody.
Alive.
They lie side by side, sucking air --
Until they both hear an odd noise:
The sound of CRUMPLING METAL.
The sound is GETTING LOUDER.
They both crane their necks in time to see --
The flaming car, tumbling end over end
Coming down the hill.
Heading straight for them.
JIMMY
Jesus fucking Christ!
They both dive for cover, out of the way.
Barely make it.
The CAR plows past them in a shower of dirt.
CRUMPLING. Heaving. Spitting fire.
Finally SLAMS to a halt against a palm tree.
Burns.
The night is filled with SHOUTS and CURSES.
The sound of DOORS OPENING. The crackle of flames.
ON GROUND
Joe rolls over.
Looks at Jimmy.
Jimmy looks at Joe.
(CONTINUED)
67.
CONTINUED:
HALLENBECK
You alive?
JIMMY
Don't know yet.
They crawl to their feet, inspecting for broken bones.
JIMMY
The dynamite?
HALLENBECK
Either that, or we're looking at
a major factory recall.
JIMMY
Dead guys... don't make bad jokes,
right?
HALLENBECK
Right.
JIMMY
So we're alive.
HALLENBECK
Yeah.
Hooray.
He spits blood as SIRENS once more fill the night air,
APPROACHING.
HALLENBECK
Go.
Get out of here.
JIMMY
What?
HALLENBECK
Get the fuck out of here, I'll
take the heat on this one. Rent
a car. Then go home and wait for
my call. Do it.
Jimmy meets Joe's eyes.
Nods.
Dashes off into the night.
CUT TO:
Dawn is a ghost on the horizon as Jimmy parks the rental
Subaru outside. The two men emerge. Head for the front
door.
JIMMY
So I get to meet your family, huh?
What's your daughter like?
HALLENBECK
She's like thirteen. And if you
even look at her funny, I'll shove
an umbrella up your ass and open
it.
Another Goddamned day.
A chill drizzle. The palm trees look forlorn.
87.
AT CORNER NEWSSTAND
Jimmy buys a paper. Trudges along Ventura Boulevard.
Huddled against the chill.
SLEEK, BLACK SEDAN
slides to the curb in front of him.
Two men get out:
One is Pablo, who last we saw wielding a chainsaw in
Milo's snuff film; the other is an ugly piece of hired
muscle who we'll call CHET.
The two men flank Jimmy and walk alongside him.
He looks up, startled.
PABLO
Good morning, Jimmy.
JIMMY
Who are you, and how the fuck do
you know my name?
CHET
(frowns)
This is the guy? You sure it's
the guy?
PABLO
This is him.
CHET
The kid with the million-dollar
arm?
PABLO
Yeah.
CHET
Shit. He don't look like much.
I
wouldn't pay no million dollars
for this bozo.
PABLO
Neither will anyone else, anymore.
JIMMY
I'm growing whiskers here, guys.
You got something to say, fucking
say it.
CHET
Wow. Tough guy stuff. Must have
caught it from his buddy
Hallenbeck.
(CONTINUED)
88.
CONTINUED:
JIMMY
Who?
PABLO
Don't play dumb, shithead. You
were with him last night at the
club.
CHET
Mr. Marcon sent us to teach you a
lesson, Jimmy. Something about
keeping your big coked-up nose
out of his fucking business.
PABLO
Get ready, kid. This one's an E
ticket.
And, with that, they grab Jimmy under the arms.
Carry him across the sidewalk to a plywood fence.
JIMMY
Please, guys, don't do this...
Jesus Christ, I was just her
boyfriend, I swear to God, please!
They toss Jimmy over the fence.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Not a terrible fate, under normal circumstances.
In this case, however --
A fifty-foot drop...
Awaits him beyond the fence.
A huge, looming pit dug into the earth.
Foundation for a new parking garage.
Jimmy plummets like a stone.
Under normal circumstances, he'd be dead.
But since it rained last night, he's got three feet of
water to land in.
He hits with a splash.
Disappears beneath the water.
Surfaces, screaming in pain.
Thrashes in the muddy water, and only when he looks down
does he notice the splintered bone jutting out of his
skin at a crazy angle.
(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED:
His million-dollar arm.
His throwing arm.
He clutches at cracked ribs, screaming:
JIMMY
Oh, God, my arm, my fucking arm,
oh Jesus Christ!!!
He kneels in the muddy water, rocking back and forth.
LONG SHOT - JIMMY
Alone in the pit.
Huddled in a pool of muddy water.
His screams of pain ECHO in the chill, morning air.
The grey day wears on.
Jimmy trudges stiffly down the walk toward his apartment
unit. Pulls up short, staring ahead --
DARIAN HALLENBECK
Slumped outside the door to his apartment. Asleep.
A
crumpled piece of paper clutched in her hand.
He kneels beside her.
Touches her shoulder.
JIMMY
Hey.
Wake up.
She stirs. Awakens, looking at him.
Her eyes are puffy and red from crying.
Her hair is a tangled mess.
She hands him the piece of paper, and promptly bursts
into tears.
Buries her head in his chest, sobbing.
He cradles her with his good arm.
Awkwardly unfolds the crumpled paper and reads:
MOMMY AND DADDY ARE WITH US
CALL THE POLICE AND WE'LL KILL THEM BOTH.
He stares at the note, dumbstruck.
CUT TO:
A savage wind sweeps in off the ocean.
Gulls wheel overhead.
FORTY FOOT YACHT
is tethered to a wooden dock outside the beach house.
Milo and his crew prepare to cast off. Meanwhile:
PABLO
approaches along the dock, looking lean and mean in an
Izod shirt.
He stops in front of Sarah and Joe Hallenbeck.
(CONTINUED)
103.
CONTINUED:
They are seated on the dock.
Each handcuffed to a metal railing.
Pablo kneels and unfastens Joe's cuffs.
PABLO
Get up.
HALLENBECK
Go fuck yourself.
Pablo delivers a savage kick to Hallenbeck's ribs.
Hallenbeck gasps in pain.
HALLENBECK
I meant that... in a good way...
Pablo hauls him to his feet.
Props him against the
railing.
PABLO
Time for a little payback, Joe.
Call it a service to dear departed
Chet.
He slams a fist into Hallenbeck's middle.
Sarah cries out in alarm.
PABLO
How's that feel, fuckhead?
HALLENBECK
(weakly)
I'm asshole... she's fuckhead.
And with that, Pablo lets him have it.
Rains punches on his chest and gut.
Slams an elbow into his kidneys.
Drives a knee into his groin.
Joe hits the deck.
Milo calls out from the boat:
MILO
Easy, Pablo.
I want him conscious.
Pablo is kicking Joe's prone form.
SARAH
Goddamn you, stop it!!
Oh, Jesus,
leave him alone!
(CONTINUED)
104.
CONTINUED:
Pablo gives Joe a last swift kick. Spits on him.
Hallenbeck vomits. Lies bleeding on the dock.
Sarah crawls over to him. As far as the cuffs will
allow. Cradles his head in her lap.
HALLENBECK
Don't... look at me...
SARAH
Shhh. It's okay, Joe. I'm here,
it's okay.
(strokes his hair)
I love you, Joe.
Hallenbeck looks at her like she's just grown three
heads.
HALLENBECK
I get the shit beat out of me...
puke all over myself... and now
you love me?
SARAH
I never stopped loving you, Joe.
HALLENBECK
Christ, you slept with three guys.
SARAH
You knew about the others?
HALLENBECK
I knew.
SARAH
You never said anything.
HALLENBECK
Figured... you needed them.
SARAH
Joe, Goddammit, why didn't you
say something?
HALLENBECK
Like what?
'Fuck you, Sarah'?
SARAH
Yes. Fuck you, Sarah! Anything
to show that you... that you had
some pride left.
A pause.
Then Hallenbeck heaves a sigh.
(CONTINUED)
105.
CONTINUED:
HALLENBECK
Sorry... I'm fresh out.
SARAH
I'm scared, Joe. Get me out of
this.
HALLENBECK
Must be my trick ear. Sounded
like you said, 'Get me out of
this.'
SARAH
You can take these guys, Joe.
HALLENBECK
I've got cracked ribs and a
concussion.
SARAH
Save me, Joe.
Be a hero.
HALLENBECK
I don't believe in heroes.
SARAH
That's no excuse.
He stares up at her for a moment.
Then, through bloody
lips:
HALLENBECK
Fuck you, Sarah...
And he smiles.
Just then, Milo signals from the boat.
Seeing, this, Pablo approaches the couple again.
PABLO
All right, lovebirds, break it up.
He yanks Sarah to her feet.
Lets his gaze roam up and down her body.
PABLO
Nice tits.
He rips open her blouse.
Roughly fondles her breasts.
Hallenbeck. On the ground.
He growls with fury. Starts to push himself up.
(CONTINUED)
106.
CONTINUED:
PABLO
Stay down, fucker. Don't you
move.
At that moment, Milo comes striding down the dock.
Whistling cheerfully.
MILO
Careful, Pablo. We don't want to
get Mrs. Hallenbeck all excited in
front of hubby.
He squats next to Joe.
MILO
Hello, Joseph, guess what? Time
to go, and remember: you follow
orders, or the missus pays the
price.
HALLENBECK
You're gonna kill us both anyway.
MILO
Perhaps. But there are ways to
die, and then there are... ways to
die. Capisce? You determine your
wife's fate.
He yanks Hallenbeck to his feet.
Propels him toward the boat.
As her husband is being led away, Sarah calls out:
SARAH
Joe...!
He stops.
Turns.
Looks at her.
Boys and girls, there is, within Joe Hallenbeck, a spark:
Tiny. Fizzling. Almost gone.
But now, looking at his wife, that spark unexpectedly
kindles --
And eight years melt away.
Just like that.
The old Joe Hallenbeck looks his wife in the eye and
says, with deadly calm:
(CONTINUED)
107.
CONTINUED:
HALLENBECK
I'll be back.
(beat)
That's a promise.
Milo clubs Joe in the head with his pistol.
MILO
You're wasting my time, Joseph.
Let's go.
Hallenbeck turns. Dirty. Tired.
Unshaven.
Bloody.
He looks at Milo... and grins:
HALLENBECK
If you touch me again... I'll kill
you.
They stare into each other's eyes.
Hallenbeck does not give an inch.
Milo hits him again.
A sign reads, BOAT RENTALS:
DAY AND WEEK.
Jimmy moves briskly down a concrete ramp toward a
Hatteras sport charter. He is obsessed. Determined.
Darian trots along behind him. She's holding up pretty
well, considering.
DARIAN
What do you need a boat for?
JIMMY
I'm gonna crash a party out on
Catalina. Marcon will be there.
He swings a bag of gear onto the boat.
Starts to store
it.
DARIAN
Maybe... we should call the
police.
(CONTINUED)
110.
CONTINUED:
JIMMY
No, honey. Not now. There's some
big shots involved in this mess,
and it's my word against theirs.
If I blab to the cops, your mom
and dad will disappear and they'll
never find the bodies.
(beat)
I'm sorry, Darian.
DARIAN
(about to cry)
So... what do we do...?
JIMMY
What I do... is confront Conrad
Marcon and threaten to go to the
cops, unless he gives them back.
DARIAN
Is that gonna work?
JIMMY
Beats me, but I think it's what
your dad would do.
DARIAN
I'm scared.
JIMMY
Me, too, honey.
His gear stashed, he turns to Darian.
Tries a smile.
JIMMY
So... why'd you come to me,
anyhow?
DARIAN
I don't know. I thought you'd...
know what happened, know what to
do...
(beat)
I mean, you were one of my dad's
big heroes.
Jimmy almost chokes...
JIMMY
What?
(CONTINUED)
111.
CONTINUED:
DARIAN
When I was little, he used to talk
about you all the time. Best
football player in the game.
Great this. Wonderful that. You
shoulda seen him when you got
busted.
Jimmy stares straight ahead.
Takes a deep breath.
JIMMY
I'll get them back, kiddo.
I'll
get them back.
CUT TO:
The island sits beneath a dark, cloud-filled sky.
Fog nestles in the foothills, rolling in off the ocean.
CATALINA FERRY
slices through the murk, filled with light, laughter,
MUSIC.
ON SHORE
Boats are arriving at a private dock.
A steady stream of guests. Tuxedoes and evening gowns.
A parade of phony hair and phony boobs.
All mounting the stairs to a huge chalet.
Inside, a dinner party is in progress.
Boats, lots of them. Sportfishers. Yachts. Floating
boats. Money, money, everywhere, and plenty of drinks
to drop.
HATTERAS SPORT BOAT
PURRS quietly into the harbor.
Jimmy at the rudder.
Nudges up to the dock.
In the chalet above, the party rages.
SERIES OF SHOTS - JIMMY'S PREPARATION
Jimmy lashes the boat.
Goes below.
Grabs a tuxedo from the closet.
Stands, dressed, in front of the mirror.
Opens a box. Removes a 9 millimeter Baretta.
Works the slide. Jacks a bullet into the cylinder.
Stashes it in the waistband of his pants:
In back. Concealed by the tuxedo.
Studies his own grim face in the mirror.
JIMMY
Okay, hot shit, let's do it.
Jimmy emerges from the cabin.
Heads for the rail.
A voice calls out:
DARIAN (O.S.)
Nice tux.
He turns, and sees Darian Hallenbeck.
Peeking her head out from under a tarpaulin.
JIMMY
Goddammit, I told you to go home!
DARIAN
Fuck you, I stowed away.
They're
my parents, okay?
Jimmy shakes his head.
Exasperated.
JIMMY
Fine, whatever. Just stay here.
With the boat.
(CONTINUED)
115.
CONTINUED:
Darian starts to protest.
He throws her the keys.
JIMMY
Anything funny happens, get the
fuck out of here.
Darian takes the keys.
Frowns, says:
DARIAN
You look terrible.
JIMMY
I feel terrible.
DARIAN
Are you really a drug addict?
JIMMY
I was.
I kicked the habit.
DARIAN
When?
JIMMY
This morning.
Stay here.
He swings over the side, onto the dock.
DARIAN
Don't let them break your other
arm.
JIMMY
Thanks, kid.
You're a fuckin'
inspiration.
Milo's yacht is anchored about a half mile offshore.
Island lights blink in the distance. Fog rolls in.
Milo emerges from the cabin onto the deck.
Crosses to the railing, looks down at:
FISHING BOAT
bobbing in the water about thirty yards away.
A FISHERMAN is waving his arms. Hailing them.
Beside him, his wife and seventeen-year-old son.
FISHERMAN
Hey! Buddy, I got a cracked engine
casing, I'm dead in the water!
Can I get a tow?
Milo swears under his breath.
Calls out:
MILO
I'm sorry, sir. This boat is
Island Security, we're under
strict orders to stay within this
sector.
FISHERMAN
Aw, shit!
Look, it'll take ten
minutes!
MILO
I'm sorry, we can't help you.
FISHERMAN
Goddammit, now I gotta call the
Coast Guard!
Milo's crewman steps up to the rail.
Speaks urgently:
CREW MEMBER
Milo, he's gonna bring the Coast
Guard down on top of us.
Milo ponders for maybe three seconds.
Then he calls out:
MILO
Excuse me.
Sir?
The Fisherman turns.
His family beside him.
MILO
Fuck you, sir.
(CONTINUED)
118.
CONTINUED:
He reaches under his Windbreaker.
Pulls out an Ingram model MACHINE GUN.
OPENS FIRE.
The entire family is blown away.
WOOD SPLINGERS POP and fly.
GLASS SHATTERS.
The bodies topple like broken toys.
Milo ceases fire.
Turns to his crewman.
MILO
Problem solved. Get over there
and put the bodies below where
they can't be seen.
He saunters away as if nothing unusual has occurred.
Jimmy is strolling along a hedge behind the house.
Looking for a back entrance.
He hears VOICES, approaching.
Pulls up short. Ducks into the shadows.
Senator Baynard goes by, with two bodyguards.
Brisk. Businesslike.
SENATOR
Christ, I can't believe I agreed
to this dog and pony show. Let's
get it over with.
The head for the boats.
Jimmy stares after them, mind racing.
Makes a decision: heads for the boats.
Following Baynard.
Jimmy casts off the lines.
Heads for the cockpit. Darian is inside.
JIMMY
Gimmee the keys, kiddo.
DARIAN
Where are you going?
(CONTINUED)
119.
CONTINUED:
JIMMY
The Senator's here, and he's
leaving by the back door. I'm
gonna follow him.
He keys the ignition.
JIMMY
Get off the boat.
DARIAN
Fuck you, man. No way.
JIMMY
Darian, Goddammit --
She runs below decks.
DARIAN (O.S.)
I'm not coming out!
Jimmy looks up:
The Senator's boat, a sleek, powerful Marlineer, is even
now pulling out of the cove.
JIMMY
Okay.
Shit.
Okay.
Easy.
Shit.
He throttles forward.
The Hatteras pulls away from the dock.
CUT TO:
The sound of THUNDERING ROTORS, as a refitted Bell Cobra
HELICOPTER cuts through the night sky over Catalina.
Banks sharply, cruises offshore.
About two miles offshore. The Senator's Marlineer cuts
through the waves, converging with Milo's yacht.
The two boats pull up alongside.
The lines are made fast.
One of Milo's crewmen greets Senator Baynard's AIDE, a
slick-looking Italian in a $1,000 overcoat.
Baynard's man hops from one boat to the other.
Boarding Milo's yacht. Meanwhile --
Jimmy Dix is clearly lost.
He bangs his fist in frustration.
JIMMY
Goddammit, I lost him.
I can't
see a fucking thing.
DARIAN
See if this boat has sonar.
JIMMY
Oh, yeah, little Miss Know-It-All.
(CONTINUED)
121.
CONTINUED:
DARIAN
Fuck you.
JIMMY
Watch your mouth.
DARIAN
Take a bath in my ass.
They're clearly having no fun.
CUT TO:
Baynard's Marlineer surges forward.
Full throttle, heading for shore, as --
Milo skids out on deck, grabbing for his machine gun.
Calls out:
MILO
Who the fuck is he?
A crewman grabs a pair of binoculars.
Meanwhile --
125.
INSIDE STORAGE COMPARTMENT
Hallenbeck has no fucking idea what's going on, but he
can hear everthing that's said, as:
BACK ON DECK
the Crewman lowers the binoculars in disbelief:
CREWMAN
Son of a bitch! It's Dix, the
Goddamn quarterback!
Milo, meanwhile, has also spotted Hallenbeck.
He growls in rage.
Hefts the Ingram machine gun, as:
ANOTHER ANGLE
Hallenbeck thrusts forward, hooks his bound hands around
the passing anchor and whoosh -- !
He is catapulted forward, jerked like a rag puppet.
BULLETS CHOP the water where he just was.
He skims over the waves. Bounced. Battered.
Trailing behind Jimmy at fifty miles an hour.
Jimmy and Darian begin to haul him in.
Struggling. Straining.
The boat rushing headlong, driverless.
With a last, desperate surge of energy --
They drag Hallenbeck over the side. Into the boat.
DARIAN
Dad...!
(CONTINUED)
129.
CONTINUED:
She collapses, weeping, atop her father.
Hugs him for all she's worth.
HALLENBECK
What the hell's she doing here??
DARIAN
I stowed away...
GUNFIRE splits the air.
Reminds them they're not out of the woods.
MILO'S YACHT
is behind them again. The fire is out.
The chase is on.
It steadily cuts the distance.
JIMMY'S BOAT
Hallenbeck staggers to his feet.
HALLENBECK
Get below, Darian. And stay
there.
He stumbles into the wheelhouse.
Dazed.
Barely
conscious.
JIMMY
Got any ideas?
HALLENBECK
Yeah. Go really fast and hope
they don't catch us.
(beat)
Oh, shit.
JIMMY
What?
HALLENBECK
Fog bank, dead ahead. Hang on.
Into the fog they go, and, folks --
This is really scary.
Because you can't see a foot in front of your face.
They plunge through the fog at fifty miles an hour.
Hallenbeck sweats, eyes glued to the windshield.
(CONTINUED)
130.
CONTINUED:
And then a shape materializes off to port:
Milo's yacht.
Running alongside. Drawing closer.
Hallenbeck wrestles the wheel. No dice.
The yacht draws ever closer... men on deck... machine
guns...
Joe looks over... and his face tells the story:
HALLENBECK
We're dead.
Except, just then, a strange thing happens:
Milo's yacht veers off to the left. Away from
Hallenbeck. Jimmy stares, dumbfounded.
JIMMY
What the fuck? They're peeling
off. Why?
A pause... then it hits Joe like a thunderbolt:
HALLENBECK
'Cause they got sonar, that's why!
Hard to port!
JIMMY
Port?
HALLENBECK
Left, Goddammit.
The boat slews to the left, as, from out of the fog --
The Catalina ferry looms right in front of them.
JIMMY
Shit fuck piss!
They almost make it.
As it is, they avoid a head-on.
Instead, they hit
broadside.
A sickening CRUNCH -- !
Jimmy and Joe are thrown from their feet.
A momentary glimpse of faces rushing past -- Horrified
tourists -- And then the ferry is behind them.
Jimmy gets up. Staggers to the controls.
Pushes the throttle. The boat lurches forward --
Then SPUTTERS. Fizzles.
He swears violently.
(CONTINUED)
131.
CONTINUED:
JIMMY
We're on half power, we lost an
engine!
The crippled boat chugs through the mist.
JIMMY
swears again.
Bangs his fist.
JIMMY
We're sitting ducks. They got
sonar. They can find us.
HALLENBECK
Kill the running lights and radio
the Coast Guard.
Jimmy flicks off the lights. Grabs the mike. As he
does, a VIBRATING RUMBLE fills the cockpit, causing him
to pause... and then stare in shock as their boat emerges
from the fog --
And Air One hovers directly overhead.
JIMMY
Fuck me.
The two men watch, helpless, as the helicopter descends,
the Co-Pilot taking aim with a LAWS rocket.
HALLENBECK
Get down!
They both hit the floor.
Hands over their heads --
And then the pilot makes a costly error:
He descends right into the path of Milo's yacht.
With no warning whatsoever, the boat comes bursting out
of the fog --
PLOWS right INTO the HELICOPTER.
Second number one: The boat pierces the chopper, rips it
to shreds.
Second number two: The whole boat-slash-chopper mix
erupts in a shower of wood and fiberglass. Turns night
into day.
132.
JIMMY AND JOE
are still huddled on the floor.
Pause. They look up. Bewildered.
There was a big light... Big noise...
Why aren't they dead?
ANOTHER ANGLE
They move like sleepwalkers to the cockpit window.
Stare in disbelief. Joe looks at Jimmy. Jimmy at Joe.
Debris rains down.
CUT TO:
Jimmy, Joe and Darian are on deck, chugging through the
wreckage. Darian clings to her father's arm, in shock.
Hallenbeck sees something in the distance.
Squints:
HALLENBECK
What's that?
Jimmy looks:
A bright object... going in circles...
JIMMY
That's Baynard's boat!
HALLENBECK
(nods)
It can get us to shore faster than
this one, don't you think?
He starts to turn away. Notices something in the water.
Speaks over his shoulder to Jimmy.
HALLENBECK
Hand me the pole.
Jimmy hands him a long, wooden pole with a hooked end.
He fishes in the water. Snares a large, floating object.
Swings it aboard. Drops it at Jimmy's feet.
The suitcase.
JIMMY
What is it?
HALLENBECK
Birthday present.
(CONTINUED)
133.
CONTINUED:
He turns away.
Jimmy bends to open the suitcase.
Joe heads into the cockpit, Darian beside him.
Steers the boat away from the crash site. Toward the
senator's boat. Chugs forward on half an engine.
O.S., Jimmy suddenly yells:
JIMMY
Holy fucking shit!!
The once-mighty Marlineer runs aimless circles in the
mist. Half the cockpit is blown away, probably by a LAWS
rocket.
The Hatteras pulls up alongside, and Hallenbeck steps to
the rail, carrying the Baretta.
HALLENBECK
Wait here.
He swings aboard the senator's boat.
Gun cocked. Ready.
The senator's boat pulls up to the dock.
No one is
around.
134.
Hallenbeck crouches next to Darian, looks her in the eye.
HALLENBECK
Listen carefully. I'm gonna go
get your mom back, okay? You're
gonna go in the Denny's restaurant
and stay there. Talk to the
waitress but don't mention me.
Mom and I will come pick you up
later, got it?
DARIAN
(crying)
They're gonna kill you...!
HALLENBECK
Are you kidding? I do this for a
living.
(hands her a twenty)
Buy me an ice cream. I'll be back.
(beat)
I love you.
She throws her arms around him.
CUT TO:
They creep across a suburban lawn, hugging the shadows.
(CONTINUED)
135.
CONTINUED:
Across the street, Hallenbeck's house is dark.
Deserted.
Truly a sight: Jimmy, in a white shirt and tuxedo pants,
nursing a broken arm; and Joe, drenched to the skin,
pants hanging in scorched tatters.
Joe suddenly puts up a restraining hand. They stop.
Crouched behind a eucalyptus tree. Joe points:
THEIR POV
A late-model Buick is parked just up the street from his
house...
There is a man slouched inside. Smoking.
BACK TO SCENE
HALLENBECK
Shit.
Someone's staking me out.
JIMMY
(clears his throat)
Oh, I forgot to tell you. The
police want you for killing Mike
Miller.
Hallenbeck shoots him a withering look.
CUT TO:
A Coast Guard cutter is circling the site of the boat/
chopper crash. A uniformed ENSIGN shines a light on the
dark waters.
ENSIGN
I think I got someone!
Four
o'clock!
MILO
is draped over a piece of wooden wreckage.
Half his hair is burned away. His face is blistered.
He looks up, pleading, at the Ensign, as:
ANOTHER ANGLE
He hides the Ingram beneath his body, cocked and ready.
CUT TO:
136.
Hallenbeck drags the unconscious cop from the car.
HALLENBECK
Let's get him inside and tie him
up.
JIMMY
Are you crazy? That's a cop!
You
don't punch cops!
HALLENBECK
I forgot.
Hurry up.
Jimmy emerges, starts across the lawn.
Pulls up short. Stares ahead at:
HIS POV - TWO BLACK SEDANS
parked at the curb.
BACK TO SCENE
He starts to cry out --
And a dark figure looms behind him.
Clubs him in the head.
Hallenbeck leaves the rented Subaru by the side of the
road.
He is dressed in combat black. Government issue.
Rifle over one shoulder. Hunting knife in a hip
scabbard.
Like an angel of death, he moves into the brush.
Heading down the canyon.
An armed sentry patrols the grounds.
Below him, nighttime L.A. stretches to the Pacific.
Joe Hallenbeck emerges like a wraith from the trees.
Clamps a gloved hand over the sentry's mouth.
Drives the hunting knife into his back.
The wooden garage DOORS EXPLODE outward, bursting to
splinters, as a Ford BRONCO DRIVES right THROUGH them,
Conrad Marcon at the wheel. He careens off into the
night. Makes a getaway.
The Mercedes barrels out through the splintered garage
doors. BURNS RUBBER down the hill.
Conrad Marcon, meanwhile, is rocketing along the winding
road, heading up the canyon, when he sees something
ahead:
HIS POV - JOE'S RENTAL SUBARU
sitting abandoned in the roadside brush.
BACK TO SCENE
Acting on a sudden hunch, he SLAMS ON the BRAKES.
Stops the car. Gets out, crosses to the rental. Peeks
in.
A two-million-dollar suitcase sits, pretty as punch, on
the back seat.
MARCON
Shit, Joe Boy, you wasn't
bluffing...
He draws his gun. Blows out the glass.
Reaches in. Opens the car door.
Snatches up the briefcase.
CUT TO:
152.
A block of seedy-looking brick buildings.
Off Sunset.
Not many people at this hour.
MERCEDES
slews around the corner races down the street, running
without headlights.
Lurches to a halt near the mouth of an alley.
Jimmy and Joe burst from the car, guns in hand.
Hellenbeck is grim, purposeful. Jimmy is nervous.
JIMMY
I'm new at this, Joe.
How do we
do it?
HALLENBECK
We get in, we get out. Shoot
anyone who's not my wife. Check
that: Don't shoot me.
He jacks a fresh clip into his rifle.
CUT TO:
LOCKPICK
inserted in the latch of a back door.
Hallenback finds the tumblers. Springs the lock in
seconds.
Sarah is now dressed, as Joe supports her across the
sidewalk toward the stolen Mercedes.
He turns to Jimmy. Hands him a set of keys.
HALLENBECK
Drive one of their cars.
They
won't be needing them.
JIMMY
Where do you want me to go?
HALLENBECK
The two million bucks is still in
the Subaru. Parked on Mulholland
above Marcon's house. Go pick it
up and bring it to the office.
We're gonna go get Darian.
JIMMY
Yes, massah.
He moves off into the parking lot.
Hallenbeck says to Sarah.
HALLENBECK
I'll take you and Darian to the
office. You can sleep there.
SARAH
Why can't we go home?
HALLENBECK
There's four corpses in the bedroom.
SARAH
Oh.
It's a very tiny "oh."
ESTABLISHING SHOT - JOE'S OFFICE
in the shadow of the freeway. The night wears on.
From
the billboard, Gorgeous continues to entice.
155.
Joe exits the office, starts across the lawn toward the
vehicle with the flashing light.
Realizes with a sudden shock:
something's wrong.
HALLENBECK
That's not L.A.P.D....
HALLENBECK'S POV
the insignia on the door panel reads LONG BEACH SHORE
PATROL.
In the same glance, he sees there's a dead cop slumped in
the passenger seat, and worse, much worse than that:
Milo is in the driver's seat.
WIDER ANGLE
Milo, who steps out of the car and promptly OPENS FIRE on
Joe.
HALLENBECK
Son of a bitch!
He dives for cover, the turf erupting all around him, as:
Hallenbeck spins behind one of the billboard support
legs, as BULLETS CHOP it to splinters.
157.
MILO
advances.
changing clips.
Methodical.
Precise.
Like a robot.
He is obsessed.
All vestige of sanity gone.
MILO
You fucked up my face, Joseph!
Joe starts to climb. Scales the wooden structure.
Swings himself onto the raised platform.
Flattens behind the billboard.
MILO
Don't try to hide, Joseph. I've
got all night, you fucked up my
face.
He sprays a BURST of GUNFIRE up at the billboard.
HALLENBECK
huddles behind the billboard as the bullets stitch
upward. Through the wooden frame.
A hot SLUG RIPS through Joe's arm.
An eruption of blood. He hisses in pain.
Rolls away from the gunfire.
Looks around. Desperate.
Sees a painter's bucket lying nearby.
He counts to three.
DOWN BELOW
Milo calmly changes clips.
Hallenbeck bursts from cover.
Hurls the bucket down at Milo, dashes across the front of
the billboard, hard and fast --
BULLETS CHOPPING the board right behind him, blowing
holes in Gorgeous's derrierre --
And then Joe does a risky thing:
He sprints to the end of the billboard, running full
tilt, and he leaps out into space, what the hell is he
doing?
(CONTINUED)
158.
CONTINUED:
He's trying to make the freeway.
It's a good fifteen feet.
Try it sometime.
He flies through open air --
Milo's GUN CHATTERING below, seeking him out --
And just does make it.
Hits the freeway surface and collapses forward, screaming
as he rolls on his injured arm... Looks up --
EIGHTEEN WHEEL TRUCK
is headed straight for him, bearing down...!
He rolls aside just in time. It THUNDERS past.
Staggers to his feet, frantic --
and Milo is climbing the billboard.
Hallenbeck looks for a place to hide.
There isn't any.
He's going to have to run through traffic.
He shifts from foot to foot, searching for an opening,
and meanwhile --
Jimmy and Joe stand in the breakdown lane next to the
rented Subaru. Jimmy points to the shattered window.
JIMMY
Somebody broke in and swiped the
suitcase from the back seat. Had
to be Marcon, right?
There is a pause. They both stare at the car.
Two million. Down the drain.
Except, after a beat... they begin to laugh.
First chuckling, then chortling..
Now it's go-for-broke. Jimmy hoots. Joe howls.
Jimmy pulls out a key and opens the trunk --
You can guess what's inside.
JIMMY
Son of a bitch got the wrong one!
CUT TO:
AUTOGRAPHED FOOTBALL
on the dresser of a fancy penthouse suite.
Signed by Joe Montana, no less.
CONRAD MARCON
bustles back and forth, shoves the last of his needed
possessions into a travel bag. Hefts it. Puts it near
the door.
(CONTINUED)
161.
CONTINUED:
Crosses to the bed, where the other suitcase lies.
Looks at it. Smiles, contented.
Can't help himself.
He reaches out.
Flicks the latch.
Opens it.
There is a note taped to the inside:
FUCK YOU
Marcon's flaming corpse is BLOWN OUT through the glass,
along with his earthly possessions. He plummets like a
meteor.
CUT TO:
EAST L.A. SIDESTREET - NIGHT
Two ten-year-old black boys are walking down the street.
Out strolling in the poverty that exists in the shadow of
the skyscrapers.
Quite suddenly, without warning --
A football drops out of the sky.
Hits and bounces, very high --
Comes down. Settles. Rocks, back and forth.
The kids look up, puzzled.
Searching the sky.
The ball sits there.
Only slightly scorched.
Tentatively, almost like he's afraid of being caught,
one of the boys bends down... looks both ways...
Picks up the ball.
Smiles.
Then, as if by some unspoken agreement --
The other boy starts to run.
Slowly at first, then faster... faster still...
A slant pattern, heading for the mailbox...
And at 12 midnight on December 22nd, the San Pedro Street
quarterback throws an absolutely perfect pass.
Their laughter is joyful.
Innocent.
Fervid.
They will grow up to be sports heroes.
DISSOLVE TO:
162.
Jimmy and Joe walk side by side. Away from us. Slightly
drunk. Palms wave lazily. A sweaty Santa rings a bell.
HALLENBECK
See, Jim, the thing is, life sucks.
But you still can't be hangin'
around Satan Claus, you know why...?
JIMMY
Why?
HALLENBECK
'Cause someday, compadre... Satan
Claus and Santa Claus are gonna
have a big fight, and you know
what...?
(beat)
Santa's gonna kick some royal ass.
He puts a fatherly arm around Jimmy's shoulder, grins:
HALLENBECK
Hey.
Smile, you fuck.
FADE OUT.
