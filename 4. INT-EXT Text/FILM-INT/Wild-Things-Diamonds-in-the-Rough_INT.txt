A perfect rainbow is trapped inside two flawless DIAMONDS,
glinting in the morning sun.
Tounted on crushed velvet, the identical diamonds are on a glass
covered pedal stool in the middle of a vast, marble MUSEUM HALL.
The stunning beauty of the stones is matched only by the
breathtaking beauty of the young woman who's admiring them. MARIE
CLIFFORD's creamy seventeen year old skin is dappled in the
cornucopia of colors emanating from the diamonds...
She reaches out tentatively towards the glass case. Not to touch
the diamonds, but to run her fingers over a picture that's mounted
in the case below the priceless jewels. It's of a MOTHER cradling
her BABY DAUGHTER...
MARIE
Today's the day, Mom...
CURATOR (O.S.)
You here again, Marie?
Marie spins round, sees the bespectacled CURATOR, 60's, standing
behind her.
MARIE
Just leaving.
Marie carefully adjusts the sign atop the glass case...
'THE MOTHER DAUGHTER DIAMONDS...'
Marie guides her powerful car towards her parking spot, when...
SCCCREEEECCCHHHH!
She SLAMS on the brakes as a figure darts in front of her car.
Almost gives her a heart attack, throwing her forward, flailing
arms crashing into the stereo, then snapped back by her seatbelt.
She sits stock still for a second, then looks up, out of her
windshield at the young woman scouring at her, only inches from
the front bumper of the BMW.
The sudden jolt has changed the radio station. A newscaster
rambles on...
RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
... operation, aimed at finally capturing
the Black Widow suspect after a six month
trail of embezzlement and fraud, once
again failed to snare its subject.
ELENA SANDOVAL, 17, stands defiantly in front of the BMW, her
don't-fuck-with-me stare in direct contrast with her come-fuck-me
clothes.
RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
Blue Bay Police Detective Michael
Morrison was able to recover over
$400,000 in stolen money, but the
suspect, described as Female, between
eighteen and thirty, remains at large...
Marie reaches out with a trembling hand, turns off the stereo,
then leans out of the car window.
MARIE
I'm... so... sorry...
Elena smiles wryly.
ELENA
You will be.
And she means it...
03/22/2004
3.
The auditorium is packed with the Blue Bay High student body. The
natural order is clear, the pastel flock at the front, the meat
headed jocks in the center, and the rejects at the back.
Marie is amongst her sweater monkey friends, but she's still
shocked by what happened out in the parking lot...
JENNY
(handing over a present)
Happy birthday, babe. They ain't
diamonds, but you're just gonna have to
wait for those...
Marie tentatively opens the gift, sees a pair of OPAL EARRINGS.
MARIE
(unconvincing)
Thank you. Thank you so much...
JENNY
Are you OK, hon?
Marie looks back, to the far reaches of the auditorium where the
freaks and geeks crowd round Elena, worshipping her like the
Goddess she is...
MARIE
I...yeah...I'll be fine...It's
just...that new girl...I almost hit her
in the parking lot...
JENNY
You mean the towel girl, the one who
transferred in? Jesus, she's trouble. You
know the only reason she's slinging
towels is 'cos it's court ordered...
Marie and Elena make brief, electric eye contact, across the sea
of hormonally challenged students as Principal LIONEL MOSSTER, his
ill-fitting sports jacket coffee-stained, steps onstage.
MOSSTER
We're here today to address a growing
epidemic that affects all of you.
He pauses, waits for the student body to quiet down...
MOSSTER
National studies report sexual activity
among students at an all-time high.
03/22/2004
4.
The students all cheer, naturally.
MOSSTER
We'll see who's cheering when you've got
an unwanted pregnancy on your hands, or
get slapped with a paternity suit...Or
arrested for date rape. But don't take my
word for it...
He motions behind him to KRISTEN RICHARDS, early 30's, a natural
beauty who's doing her best to hide behind a bland gray suit and
glasses, and CHAD BORMAN, late 20s, devilishly handsome...
PRINCIPAL MOSSTER
Miss Richards and Dr. Borman are here to
tell you about the pitfalls first hand...
Kristen steps up to the lectern.
KRISTEN
Good morning, my name is Kristen
Richards. I'm an officer for the Miami
juvenile parole board, as some of you
already know...
Quick glance at Elena who rolls her eyes...
KRISTEN
But that's not what brings me here today.
When I heard about Principal Mosster's
sex education program I thought I'd
volunteer my own personal story, in hopes
that you might learn from the mistakes I
made. Back in High school all I wanted to
do was get drunk, stoned and laid...
The students roar their approval.
KRISTEN
By my junior year, my life was a blur of
cheap beer, anonymous sex, partying every
night of the week...
Elena covers her mouth, as if to cough...
ELENA
(through fake coughs)
...whore...
Kristen ignores the slur.
03/22/2004
5.
KRISTEN
And then, one night at some pathetic frat
party, someone slipped a roofie in my
drink...and raped me.
This quiets the auditorium.
KRISTEN
There isn't a day goes by my skin doesn't
crawl when I think of the violation and
humiliation I endured. I can promise you
that if you make the same kind of wrong-
headed choices I did, you'll be seeing
Dr. Borman...
Chad steps to the podium.
CHAD
Thank you, Miss Richards. My name's Dr.
Chad Borman. I run the forensics lab at
the police department, where my work has
helped convict hundreds of sex offenders.
Most teens like Ms. Richards never get
their lives together. The physical scars
may go away, but the emotional damage
stays forever.
While Chad drones on, MUDDY, a Gremlin-eyed drooler, sitting in
front of Elena, looks back at her shapely legs as she puts them up
on the back of the chair. He spots the ugly plastic bracelet
locked around one of her ankles.
MUDDY
That's not...what I think it is, is it?
ELENA
Whattchya think it is, bitch?
The words catch in his throat.
MUDDY
One of them...Parole leashes...
ELENA
Bingo.
MUDDY
So you can't, like, go more than ten
miles from the cop shop?
Elena taps the flashing red light on the plastic bracelet.
03/22/2004
6.
ELENA
Five. I got someone's panties in a bunch.
Back at the podium, Chad leans forward, making sure his words
resonate with the student body.
CHAD
And as for the perpetrators of this
heinous act, even if you are still a
minor, you will be tried as an adult,
and, if convicted, you will do hard time.
He pauses to let the impact of this wash over the students.
CHAD
Are there any questions?
ELENA
(calling out)
Yeah, I got one for Miss Richards.
KRISTEN
Ask away.
ELENA
When they found the scumbag who took your
precious flower of virginity, you sued
his sorry ass, right?
Kristen is taken aback by Elena's insensitivity, stumbles over her
words, finally spitting out the sad, sorry truth...
KRISTEN
Uh, no, actually, I was never able to
make a positive ID. All I remember was
his alcohol-soaked breath whispering in
my ear, "You won't remember, but you'll
never forget..."
Elena cracks a sideways grin...
ELENA
So what you're really saying is you
fucked for free...
Kristen has no answer to that. Principal Mosster does his best to
control the situation...
PRINCIPAL MOSSTER
Miss Sandoval. You're on thin ice, young
lady!
Like Elena cares.
She leans back, nods. Job done.
7.
Marie makes her way down the sleek white corridors inside the
opulent Clifford Mansion, past framed family photos, of Jay, Marie
and the late Julie...
MARIE
Jay?
H
e's nowhere to be found. Frustrated, Marie finds herself alone in
the kitchen. She angrily selects a bottle of Champagne, pops the
cork. Before she can swig any alcohol she hears raised voices.
JAY (O.S.)
It simply can't be done...
Marie tentatively edges out of the kitchen, back into the hallway,
and down towards Jay's study...
12.
JAY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
In all construction there's delays.
Marie sidles up to the door jam, peaks through the crack. What she
sees makes the blood run cold in her veins...
An imposing Cuban businessman, MR. BARAJAS, stands threateningly
over a visibly frightened Jay. Another man, CICATRIZ, dressed in
designer silks, stands menacingly in the corner, clearly the brawn
of this little operation.
MR. BARAJAS
Four months is not a delay. It's a
disaster.
JAY
You have my word, Mr. Barajas, the
building is almost finished. Just give me
a week, two tops.
Barajas nods to Cicatriz, who moves in on Jay with lightning
quickness, holds a Razor sharp KNIFE against his thumb.
MR. BARAJAS
We are long past the negotiation stage.
Cicatriz runs the steel blade across Jay's thumb. Marie has to
cover her mouth from screaming as she sees a trickle of blood
stain the spotless white carpet.
MR. BARAJAS (CONT'D)
For every day the building goes
unfinished, we'll take a finger...
A sinister grin stretches across Cicatriz's lips.
CICATRIZ
Pray, Mr. Clifford, you finish before the
eleventh day...
And with that the Cuban men head to the door. Marie scrambles
away, her heart pounding...
She's halfway down the hallway when Mr. Barajas and Cicatriz exit
Jay's study. She turns, tries to look innocent as the Cuban
'businessmen' stare her down.
J
ay appears in the doorway, sweat cascading from his brow.
JAY
Marie! Shouldn't you be with your
friends?
A
03/22/2004
13.
MARIE
I was just...
Cicatriz takes a step towards her.
JAY
(to Marie)
I'll be right there. With your gift...
just... wait outside, OK?
Marie backs away, never taking her eyes off the intimidating Cuban
men...
In a concrete makeshift office, on the top floor of the condo
building, Jay clicks open the lock on his large metal safe and the
steel door swings open.
Inside are stacks of CASH, piled high, along with a shiny new
HANDGUN. Jay flicks through the money, shaking his head...
JAY
(sotto)
Not enough. Just not enough...
A clanking noise from outside has him quickly snatching the gun
from the safe, before closing it once more, spinning the lock...
Jay walks out of his office, into the half-finished top floor of
the condos. Exposed beams and drying cement reveal how far behind
schedule Jay really is...
J
AY
Hello? Anyone there?
He swings the gun round impotently, seeing nothing in the
flickering florescent light...
Finally Jay lowers the weapon. It looks like he might collapse,
until he catches himself, palms flat against the wall, head down.
JAY (CONT'D)
Fuck me...
ELENA (O.S.)
Any time. Any place...
He reels around, sees Elena moving toward him, brushing aside the
thick plastic sheeting. She has a bottle of beer in one hand, a
video camera in the other. Jay's video camera to be precise...
JAY
What are you doing here?
ELENA
You promised to show me your erection...
03/22/2004
16.
Elena focuses the video camera on Jay's crotch. Makes him
incredibly uncomfortable, obviously.
JAY
Is that my...camera?
Elena thrusts the bottle of beer at Jay.
ELENA
Lighten up, Jay.
Jay takes the bottle from her, sets it down on the concrete floor.
JAY
Enough's enough. I think it's time you
left.
This brings a teasing pout to Elena's lips.
ELENA
Is that any way to treat Marie's new best
friend?
Jay's taken aback.
JAY
You're best friends are you?
ELENA
Sure. We've been having sleepovers.
Talking about boys, swapping tips. She's
been teaching me about shopping, I've
been teaching her about giving mind
blowing head...
Jay's taken aback once more. How much more aback can he be taken?
He reaches out and blocks the video camera lens.
JAY
Gimme the camera back...
Elena saunters slowly past, brushing up against him. Keeps the
camera trained on his worried face...
ELENA
Come get it.
Jay's reaching his elastic limit. He reaches for the camera, but
Elena won't let go. They wrestle for control of the video camera.
And finally the camera slips from both their grasps, flies across
the room and SHATTERS on the concrete floor...
03/22/2004
17.
ELENA
(slyly)
Ooopppps.
Elena runs her finger under Jay's chin, then turns and walks away,
leaving Jay standing there, all taken aback.
A perfect rainbow is trapped inside the two flawless Mother
Daughter DIAMONDS, glinting in the morning sun.
Marie can barely contain her excitement as she paces frantically
in the dark marble museum hall, reaching out a trembling hand
towards the glass case containing the priceless jewels...
JAY (O.S.)
You really think you're ready for your
inheritance?
Marie looks round to see Jay striding into the Museum, still in
the same clothes as yesterday...
MARIE
It was...it was what Mom wanted...
Jay looks at her sternly.
JAY
You're the only one who can open that
lock, but I'm the one with the key. She
wanted you to have the diamonds when you
were responsible enough to know what to
do with them...
M
MARIE
I'm...responsible...
Jay shakes his head slowly, deliberately.
JAY
Really? Underage drinking, prying into my
personal affairs, fighting...
MARIE
But they're mine. Mom left them to me.
JAY
They're yours when I say they're yours.
For the time being, I've got some major
problems at the construction site.
Deadlines have to be met. We'll talk
again when you've done some growing up.
Jay puts an arm around his stepdaughter, starts walking her back
towards the massive wooden doors.
M
03/22/2004
19.
JAY
Please, don't fight me on this.
We're
Team Clifford, remember?
MARIE
(without conviction)
Team Clifford...
She's stuck in an awkward embrace with her Step Father...
Elena paces the sterile interview room like a caged tiger. She
stops in front of the two way mirror, examines her reflection...
Tentatively she reaches out a trembling finger touching the scab
on her lip, covering the wound Marie inflicted at the party. And
slowly Elena starts to press on the cut, until the blood starts to
flow once more...
There's a quiet knock on the door and Elena quickly lowers her
hand, looks round...
Kristen Richards, the young Parole Officer who so heart
wrenchingly told her story at Blue Bay High earlier, comes quietly
into the gray room.
KRISTEN
Elena.
Elena just looks up at her pitifully.
KRISTEN
Could you tell me what happened?
Through stifled sobs, Elena states...
ELENA
It was Jay Clifford. He raped me...
The interview room door swings open and DETECTIVE MICHAEL
MORRISON, 30's, enters. He's the personification of the term
"overworked, underpaid."
MORRISON
You understand the seriousness of this
allegation, young lady?
Elena nods weakly.
MORRISON
And you know that we'll leave no stone un-
turned in the investigation.
21.
MORRISON(CONT'D)
There'll be a battery of forensics tests
you'll have to take, humiliating stuff.
And background checks, digging up all
kinds of dirt. And you'll have to testify
in court, face the man you're accusing...
Crocodile tears roll down Elena's cheeks.
MORRISON
You sure you want to go through with
this? No harm, no foul, you can just walk
away right now....
Kristen interjects...
KRISTEN
Please, Detective, this isn't the right
time...
ELENA
I ain't lying. You think I'm lying?
Kristen turns to her young ward...
KRISTEN
If you're telling the truth, you won't
find a more sympathetic ear...
ELENA
'If' I'm telling the truth...
KRISTEN
And if you're not, there's gonna be
trouble, you understand?
MORRISON
This is already trouble. The man you're
accusing happens to be a friend of mine,
and when the DNA tests prove you're lying
I'm gonna come down on you like a ton of
bricks, mark my words...
Elena withers under his glare...
Jay huddles in the small interview room along with Marie and THEO
BLOOM, his sharp suited attorney.
THEO
We're gonna sue their asses til time runs
backwards...
03/22/2004
22.
JAY
(to Marie)
You've gotta believe me, I would never,
could never do anything like this, you
know that don't you?
Marie takes his hand, squeezes it.
MARIE
We're team Clifford.
Jay forces a tired smile...
JAY
That's my girl.
The door swings open and Morrison enters...
MORRISON
Jay. Marie. Mr. Bloom...
Jay stands, shakes Morrison's hand.
MORRISON
(to Marie)
Would you mind waiting outside while me
and your stepdad have a little chat...
Marie looks to Jay, doesn't want to leave.
JAY
It's OK honey. Michael and I are old
pals...
Reluctantly she leaves, letting the door swing closed after her.
Jay sits back down. Morrison takes a chair opposite.
JAY
How's the divorce treating you?
MORRISON
She's taken me for everything I'm worth.
I swear to God, I'm never trusting
another woman as long as I live.
T
heo intervenes...
THEO
This is most egregious, Detective, my
client has pressing matters at his
construction site. He can't afford to
waste time with this frivolous
nonsense...
03/22/2004
23.
MORRISON
(to Jay)
Look, we're taking her statement right
now, gonna run every forensic test in the
book. Guarantee the case'll come apart
like a $2 watch...
Jay nods, certain he can beat this rap...
JAY
She had my camcorder. Recorded what
happened. It should still be at the
construction site. It'll clear my name...
Morrison nods.
MORRISON
You'll be outta here by tonight.
Marie waits out in the anonymous hallway, talking a mile-a-minute
on her cell phone...
MARIE (ON PHONE)
I can't believe it, Jenny...It just
doesn't make sense...I mean, I know
Jay...I know he'd never...
When a door down the hall opens she looks up expectantly, only to
see Kristen come out, walk towards her, followed by someone.
Marie's view is blocked by Kristen until the Parole Officer passes
her and reveals...Elena.
MARIE
This can't be...
A look somewhere between horror and shock is etched on Marie's
beautiful face. Elena just smiles, blows her a kiss.
ELENA
No such word as 'can't'...
Plastic sheeting covers the windowless top floor of the unfinished
condos. The white suited FORENSICS TEAM work meticulously, led by
the tireless Dr. Chad Borman, delicately dusting anything and
everything that might yield evidence...
Morrison stands at the edge of an area cordoned off by POLICE
TAPE. He's looking at Jay's smashed DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA, now
bagged and tagged as evidence...
KRISTEN (O.S.)
Sexual predators often keep a trophy...
Morrison spins, sees Kristen. He stumbles with his words, not used
to talking to beautiful women...
MORRISON
I'm sorry?
KRISTEN
Maybe he recorded the rape.
Morrison looks at the remains of the camera.
MORRISON
And maybe he didn't. We'll never know.
Tape's mangled. Forensics said it'd take
months to fix it.
He looks up into Kristen's hypnotic eyes.
MORRISON
We were never properly introduced.
Michael Morrison.
She offers her hand, and Morrison shakes it.
KRISTEN
Miss Richards. Kristen. Miami Parole. Was
just in town for a couple days checking
in on some parolees when all this went
down...
She hands Morrison a BUSINESS CARD, which he absently stuffs into
his pocket...
MORRISON
You think maybe you could lean on the
girl? Get her to drop this nonsense? We
all know she's lying. With all this Black
widow shit going down, we just don't have
the time or manpower to...
03/22/2004
25.
KRISTEN
She might not be lying, you know.
MORRISON
What makes you think that?
KRISTEN
Just a look in her eye. I...I have some
experience...
Morrison doesn't want to push her further...
All of a sudden the sunlight is blocked from the massive
unfinished floor by black sheets erected by the Forensics team,
leaving everyone in pitch darkness....
MORRISON
What the hell?
Slowly an eerie ULTRA VIOLET GLOW fills the room. The white suited
forensics technicians, glowing under the black light, wait
patiently for evidence to show itself...
Suddenly the clear IMPRINTS of hands on the wall become clear,
along with the black stains of BLOOD FLECKS...
CHAD
Gotcha...
MORRISON
What is it?
CHAD
Blood, fingerprints, sign of a struggle.
I'd say we've got a rape on our hands,
Detective, but we won't know for sure
until we run the tests...
Morrison's head is spinning...
MORRISON
Fine. Just do it...
Elena sits on the edge of a gurney in the high tech forensics lab,
rubbing her arm where a band-aid covers a fresh needle mark. Chad
appears at the doorway and she stares daggers at him.
ELENA
You vampires really need five pints of my
blood? That's like an armful...
03/22/2004
26.
Chad's surprised by her venom.
CHAD
It's standard procedure in a rape test.
Test for drugs and such...
ELENA
And such.
She continues to pace as Chad makes his way into the room, rounds
the desk and takes down a plastic beaker from the metal shelf.
CHAD
We're going to need a urine sample. Do
you think you could fill this?
ELENA
From here?
Chad goes red. Puts the plastic cup down on the desk and Elena
grabs it.
C
HAD
If...you wouldn't mind...removing your
clothes. I'll leave the room, give you
some priv...
The breath catches in Chad's throat as Elena takes her shirt off
without hesitation. Stands there in just her black bra.
ELENA
Done. Next?
Chad's jaw drops. Not just because Elena's in her underwear, but
because of the clear BITE MARKS on her neck and arms...
CHAD
Those are...
ELENA
Bite marks. He chowed down.
CHAD
They're clear evidence markers...
He reaches out, grabs a Polaroid Camera from the desk, starts
snapping away like an ornithologist at a bird convention. The
FLASH of the camera fills the room...
03/22/2004
27.
The packed courthouse is abuzz and the elderly JUDGE WILCOX is
forced to slam his gavel down...
JUDGE WILCOX
Order!
Jay sits at the defendant's table, suit impeccable, hair
immaculate, game face on. Theo sits beside him, scribbling notes.
Marie is in the front row of the gallery, surrounded by her
coiffured peers. She tries to smile stoically at Jay...
Kristen sits beside Elena at the prosecution table.
C
had is on the stand as ARLO MEESE, 35, the slick District
Attorney, steps forward.
D.A. MEESE
Dr. Borman, do your tests show that Elena
Sandoval had sexual intercourse on the
night of the 25th?
CHAD
Yes they do.
D.A. MEESE
Do they show that it was forced?
03/22/2004
28.
CHAD
Yes. There was extensive bruising and
tearing. We found no semen evidence. The
latex abrasions point to the use of
protection. This is quite common in cases
of premeditated rape.
D.A. MEESE
And what can you tell us about Miss
Sandoval's toxicology reports, Doctor?
CHAD
Came back positive for Rohypnol, a common
date rape drug. Traces were also found on
the bottle of beer at the crime scene.
Both Mr. Clifford and Miss Sandoval's
fingerprints were all over the bottle.
JAY
I took it from her. She was far too young
to be drinking!
A slam of the gavel silences Jay.
D.A. MEESE
Dr. Borman I am going to show you what's
been marked as state's exhibit number 1.
He nods to the bailiff and a PROJECTOR whirs to life. An EVIDENCE
PHOTO that Chad took of Elena's wounds is displayed on a screen
beside him.
D.A. MEESE
What does this slide show?
CHAD
Miss Sandoval was found to have numerous
bite marks on her upper torso that
occurred during the rape.
JUDGE WILCOX
What about those other markings?
Chad looks confused, studies the slide, sees four equidistant dots
aligned in a small circle.
CHAD
I wasn't able to determine...Fingernail
markings, possibly...
JUDGE WILCOX
(to Meese)
Please continue.
03/22/2004
29.
Marie can barely breathe...
D.A. MEESE
I'm going to show you another slide
that's been marked as state's exhibit
number 2.
Meese nods to the bailiff, who dutifully changes the slide. The
court goes dark for a second before the next slide is
displayed...It's a close up of Jay's teeth mouldings compared to
the bite marks...
D.A. MEESE
What can you tell us about these
mouldings?
CHAD
They were made from the defendant's
teeth, and the tests I conducted show
there's simply no other conclusion. The
bite marks on Miss Sandoval's body were
made by the defendant, Mr. Jay
Clifford...
That's it. The Court erupts, flashbulbs exploding. Jay slumps back
in his chair, his air of cool gone in an instant. He looks back at
Marie, utter disbelief on his face. The tears well in her eyes...
The Judge bangs his gavel in a vain attempt to regain control.
JUDGE WILCOX
Court's adjourned...
TV news gleefully reports Jay's trial like a sordid soap opera...
REPORTER (ON TV)
...in the face of damning evidence, Jay
Clifford remained defiant. It's thought
that his stepdaughter, Marie Clifford
will testify in his defense tomorrow. And
in other news, officials from the FBI
gave a press conference today, commenting
on their involvement in the Black widow
case...
A walking suit, AGENT MILTON DAMMERS, steps up to the podium.
AGENT DAMMERS (ON TV)
After numerous mistakes on behalf of the
local authorities in Blue Bay, the FBI is
mobilizing its task force...
K
03/22/2004
30.
Click. Morrison tosses the TV remote aside, sits down behind his
desk, piled high with files, mostly marked BLACK WIDOW, and
reaches down to pick up Jay's broken video camera, still in the
evidence bag...
KRISTEN (O.S.)
It's a long shot.
Morrison looks up, smiles faintly when he sees Kristen at the
door.
MORRISON
Not a fan of 'Hey, how you doing', are
you?
Kristen smiles, enters Morrison's cluttered office.
KRISTEN
Used to play at being a spider when I was
a kid, creeping around silently. Guess I
haven't grown out of it.
Morrison shakes the broken camera parts in the evidence bag.
M
ORRISON
It's the only thing standing between my
friend and a ten year stretch...
KRISTEN
The forensics lab will have time to look
at it now...the Feds have taken over the
Black widow case...
MORRISON
Goddamn gloryhounds. They knew I was
close. They just want to come in and take
all the credit.
RISTEN
You got a chance, Detective. To help your
friend. Don't let this case slip away as
well...
Morrison tightens his jaw, knows what he has to do.
The Forensics lab is crammed with evidence bags and files. Chad is
working diligently, painstakingly scanning a stack of $100 BILLS
one by one. He barely has time to look round when the door opens
and Detective Morrison comes in...
03/22/2004
31.
MORRISON
Chad, I got a rush job for you.
Chad rolls his eyes.
CHAD
No can do, boss. We're sifting through
the Black Widow evidence...
MORRISON
Feds are movin' in. They'll be taking
over by the case by the end of the week.
Chad's dumbstruck, but dutifully takes the shattered video camera.
MORRISON
You find anything on that tape, you let
me know, OK?
CHAD
Whatever you say, boss.
MORRISON
And make sure you get that money back
into the evidence locker.
A
nd Chad's left alone with the shattered remains of the video
camera, and a whole shit load of work ahead...
FADE TO BLACK:
The usual assortment of paparazzi and spectators crowd into the
small courtroom.
Marie is on the witness stand, staring straight ahead at her
stepfather at the defendant's table. Gone is the immaculate suit,
the perfect hair, the poker face. He's looking worried now...
Theo paces in front of Marie, running her through a series of well-
rehearsed questions.
THEO
And why did you go to your stepfather's
building site that night, Miss Clifford?
MARIE
It was my birthday. Jay left the party
before giving me my present.
THEO
And you say you saw Miss Sandoval
leaving?
Marie takes a moment, looks to Elena at the Prosecution table.
MARIE
I did.
THEO
And how would you describe her
appearance?
MARIE
She was...she looked fine. She smiled at
me. Actually smiled...
THEO
No further questions.
03/22/2004
34.
He takes a seat next to Jay, whispers in his ear. D.A. Meese
starts his cross-examination.
D.A. MEESE
Would it be fair to say you don't like
Elena Sandoval, Miss Clifford?
M
MARIE
We don't see...eye to eye...
D.A. MEESE
Is that why you attacked her at your
party earlier that night?
Marie squirms.
MARIE
No...I was...she wasn't invited...
D.A. MEESE
You'd had a few drinks, correct?
MARIE
(reluctantly)
I'd had a drink. Yes.
D.A. MEESE
So by the time you allege to have seen
Miss Sandoval, could you tell the court
exactly how much you'd had to drink?
MARIE
A glass of Champagne. Or two, but...
D.A. MEESE
No further questions.
Jay sinks a few inches lower in his seat. Going down...
A bleary eyed Chad sits in front of a bank of monitors, working
the image enhancement equipment, fighting to get a watchable
picture from the fuzzy static in front of him. Kristen sits behind
him, fighting to stay awake.
CHAD
(to himself)
Take out the chroma, raise the
luminescence...
He clumsily reaches over the control panel, hitting almost every
button on the way. And that does the trick...
03/22/2004
35.
Suddenly the picture on the monitors becomes clear. Kristen's eyes
snap open.
KRISTEN
H
oly shit...
The pixilated image of Elena smiling comes into focus on the TV...
KRISTEN (CONT'D)
Call Detective Morrison. Now...
SCENE OMITTED
The shaky, pixilated image of Elena smiling flickers on the TV.
Soon enough though her smile fades...
ELENA (ON TAPE)
You're kidding right?
Jay's voice can be heard behind the camera...
JAY (O.S. ON TAPE)
C'mon now baby, you can do it...
The video shows Elena cowering...
ELENA (ON TAPE)
Please...you can't do this...
JAY (O.S ON TAPE)
No such word as can't...
A hand reaches out from behind the video camera and grabs Elena,
throws her violently against a concrete wall.
JAY (O.S. ON TAPE)
Fuck me...
A flurry of movement that goes in and out of focus. When the
camera steadies again, Elena's hands are pressed against the wall
and she's sobbing... E
LENA (ON TAPE)
Please, Mr. Clifford, don't...
JAY (O.S ON TAPE)
Just try to keep those legs together...
And then static...
03/22/2004
36.
Pulling back from the TV we find ourselves in the courtroom,
completely empty, save for Jay, Theo, Meese and Judge Wilcox all
staring in shock at the blank TV screen...
D.A. MEESE
If Mr. Clifford would plead guilty to
rape, the state is prepared to drop the
charges of kidnapping and assault.
JUDGE WILCOX
(to Jay)
If I were you I would seriously consider
the offer.
In the cold stone jail visiting room, Jay sits behind the wire
mesh, an emotion Marie and Theo opposite. The PRISON GUARD waits
by the barred door, keeping his beady eyes on Jay.
JAY
I'm gonna lose this trial.
THEO
I'm not so sure about that. The tape's a
fake, right? So all we need to do is...
Jay holds up a hand, instantly silencing his attorney.
JAY
You had your chance.
(to Marie)
If we're gonna win at all costs, we're
gonna have to change the game.
(to Theo)
Do you have it?
Theo nods regretfully, reaches into a breast pocket, pulls out a
KEY.
THEO
I'm still dead set against this, Jay.
JAY
I couldn't care less.
MARIE
What's the key for?
JAY
The diamonds...If that's what it takes,
then that's what it takes...
03/22/2004
37.
MARIE
But...they're my inheritance...
JAY
All my assets are tied up in the condos,
Marie. We have to pay this girl off, make
her testify that she faked the tape,
faked the evidence.
MARIE
But, Jay...they're my diamonds...
JAY
As soon as I'm out of here, you'll have
them back. I swear. I know people, who
can...persuade her to hand them over...
Marie shoots an uncomfortable look to Theo, then back at Jay,
uncertain what to say.
MARIE
I
t's wrong.
JAY
More wrong than what she's doing to us?
We're team Clifford, right? You know I'm
not guilty. You know I could never do
anything like this. So do the right thing
and get me out of this hellhole...
Marie's cracking...
MARIE
I can't...
JAY
(tenderly)
No such word as 'can't.' Please...
The tears well in her eyes.
The key slips easily into the lock below the dazzling Mother
Daughter diamonds. The alarms disabled, Marie's finally able to
reach inside the glass case and touch the priceless gems...
The Curator stands behind her in the empty Museum hall, ruefully
watching his prize exhibit being removed.
CURATOR
I knew the day would come, still doesn't
make it any easier...
03/22/2004
38.
Marie, tears welling in her eyes, takes a hold of the diamonds,
carefully takes them from the case.
CURATOR
The offer still stands, Marie. If you
ever decide to sell them, please give us
a first chance...
Marie turns to him, the emotions overwhelming her.
MARIE
I don't think I'll be able to, I'm
sorry...
She scampers towards the door, past the security guards.
CURATOR
(sotto)
Me too...
An elderly man, UNCLE MARTY, in a sweat-stained T-shirt and ratty
underwear, snores on the tattered recliner, a half-drunk bottle of
WHISKY hanging from one limp hand...
Theo freezes when he sees him...
THEO
Who's this?
ELENA
Uncle Marty. Legal Guardian. Drunken
pervert, take your pick. Chill. He's out
til morning.
Uncle Marty's deafening SNORES confirm the assertion as Elena
leads them into her bedroom...
MARIE
Let's just get this over with.
(to Elena)
You won. You got what you wanted...
ELENA
(mocking)
I just wanted justice...
THEO
Tomorrow you'll take the stand, tell the
jury you faked the evidence, faked the
tape...
ELENA
(sarcastic)
Really?
MARIE
We are prepared to make it worth your
while.
She holds the Daughter diamond in front of Elena's greedy little
eyes.
ELENA
(poker face)
Not bad. But I always wanted a family...
Theo nudges Marie. She sighs, holds out the Mother diamond in the
other hand. A broad grin stretches across Elena's face.
F
03/22/2004
40.
THEO
They're yours after you exonerate my
client.
ELENA
I'm afraid I'm gonna need that payment up
front.
MARIE
No, that's not the deal.
ELENA
It is now. Take it or leave it.
Marie takes a deep breath. It's the most difficult thing she's
ever had to do in her young life. Dead silence, except for Uncle
Marty's snoring from the front room.
inally, with a very heavy heart, Marie hands over the diamonds.
THEO
When this is all over, you'll leave town.
For good.
Elena points to the ankle bracelet.
ELENA
I go more than five miles from the police
station and I'm straight back in juvie...
THEO
I understand your Parole term is up next
week.
Elena smiles.
ELENA
You've done your homework. Fine.
(points to the ankle bracelet)
As soon as this thing comes off, I'm
outta here...
She reaches down and grabs the diamonds. Dances past Marie...
THEO
May I suggest a little discretion, Miss
Sandoval. Certain...questions might be
asked about this...arrangement if you
were to...say...turn up to Blue Bay High
wearing a tiara...
Elena winks.
03/22/2004
41.
ELENA
I ain't gonna flaunt it, mate. I gots too
much class for that shit.
MARIE
You're going to tell the truth on the
stand tomorrow, yes?
Elena raises her right hand...
ELENA
I swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth...
The court Bailiff nods, takes the Bible from Elena's hands. She's
dressed in the closest thing to a modest suit she has in her
wardrobe; a low cut jacket and tiny miniskirt...
The courtroom is packed with journalists, TV cameras and nosey
neighbors. Everyone wants a piece of this story. At the
defendant's table, Jay, slick once more in Armani, watches Theo
approach the witness box with a new-found confidence.
Sitting in the front row of the public gallery, Marie is riveted
on the action. At the back of the courtroom, Kristen fidgets
nervously beside Morrison as Theo steps up, ready to question the
newly compliant star witness in this sensational rape trial...
THEO
It's your assertion that my client, Mr.
Clifford forcibly sexually assaulted you
on the night of the 25th. Is that true?
A hushed silence. Marie, Jay, Theo all wait expectantly...
THEO
Is that what you say happened?
Elena clears her throat.
ELENA
He... He didn't...
A collective intake of breath from the crowd.
ELENA
....just sexually assault me.
Theo's balls shrink instantly.
03/22/2004
42.
THEO
What...did you just say?
ELENA
He didn't just sexually assault me. He
threatened to kill me if I told anyone...
T
he court is on the verge of erupting into anarchy. Theo's
reeling, caught off-guard, stumbling over his words, trying to
give the girl one last chance to make good on her promise.
THEO
Isn't it true that you were inebriated
during the assault, that it may not in
fact have been Mr. Clifford...Or anyone?
A smirking Meese doesn't even bother to stand up.
D.A. MEESE
Objection. Leading the witness.
JUDGE WILCOX
Sustained. Council will please rephrase
the question.
Theo's stumped. His eyes plead with Elena to take the ball and run
with it. She does. Unfortunately it's to the wrong end zone.
ELENA
I was messed up, alright. In fact, only
two things I remember. One was that
bastard Jay Clifford taping me with that
Goddamn video camera while he violated
me. The other was what he whispered in my
ear, right before I blacked out...
She pauses, for emphasis. Judge, jury, gallery, press corps, the
town of Blue Bay, the state of Florida hangs on her every word...
ELENA
He said, "You won't remember, but you'll
never forget."
That's it. The court goes berserk, flashbulbs exploding, along
with the veins in Jay's head.
Kristen's reeling from shock...
KRISTEN
(to Morrison)
What did she just say?
Marie leaps to her feet, screams...
03/22/2004
43.
MARIE
Lying bitch!
Marie has to be restrained, trying to break through the crowds to
claw Elena's tear stained eyes out...
A small Television blares out today's top story...
ACTION NEWS ANCHOR
The young victim's wrenching testimonial
proved to be the final nail in the coffin
for Jay Clifford. It took less than an
hour for the jury to deliberate and
sentence Mr. Clifford to 15 years.
T
V cameras witness Jay being led away in handcuffs...
JAY (ON TV)
You can't do this to me! You can't...YOU
CAN'T!
CLICK. The TV turns off. Marie sits huddled in Jay's unfinished
concrete building site office, staring at the darkened television
set. Mascara laden tear tracks line her perfect face.
MARIE
(mumbling)
No such thing as can't...
She lets the champagne bottle slip through her fingers and it
smashes on the concrete floor. Strangely the dregs of the
champagne start running down the floor...
Marie's heart suddenly skips a beat as she thinks she hears the
rustling of plastic from outside the office.
MARIE
Who's there?
No answer. She steels herself, gets shakily to her feet, stumbling
drunkenly toward the door...
Kristen flips on a light switch. The room is illuminated for a
split second before the bulb surges and burns out, leaving Kristen
in the near-darkness...
KRISTEN
Elena?
Hello?
She takes out a FLASHLIGHT, creeps through the front room,
stepping over the discarded pizza boxes and assorted detritus.
The beam of light finds a small BLUE PILL nestled in the
carpeting. Kristen picks it up, slides it into her pocket...
Marie steps cautiously through the unfinished concrete top floor,
past the crime scene tape. In the dim light, her eyes dart to
every corner, every shadow.
S
he lets out a surprised shout as the room is suddenly plunged
into darkness. Slowly the eerie forensic ULTRA VIOLET LIGHTS
switch on, filling the room with black light.
And with a knot growing in the pit of her stomach, Marie slowly
turns, coming face to face with...
Elena, her arch-nemesis...
Kristen moves slowly into Elena's bedroom, shines her light on the
walls. What she sees makes the blood run chill in her veins.
Barely able to breathe, she takes out her cell phone.
KRISTEN
(into phone)
Detective Morrison...
Elena and Marie stare each other down. You could cut the tension
with a chainsaw, until...
MARIE
Who invited you?
03/22/2004
45.
A sinister grin spreads across Elena's face as she holds up the
breathtaking Mother-Daughter diamonds, reflecting an unearthly
glow under the UV lights.
ELENA
Mother and Daughter...
This brings a mile-wide smile to Marie as she dances into Elena's
arms. Their lips come together in a passionate kiss as their hands
dance over each other's trembling bodies. When they finally
break...
MARIE
I was sure you'd blow it on the stand,
going on about forgetting and
remembering.
ELENA
Gotta make it seem authentic. God's in
the details.
And they kiss again, lips locked tighter than Jay's jail cell...
Elena and Marie are locked in their carnal embrace, failing to
notice the florescent lights flickering back on. Suddenly Elena
feels the sharp pain of teeth biting into her neck...
She looks down to see DENTAL ALGINATE MOLDINGS of Jay's teeth
being held by a smiling Chad.
CHAD
Mind if Chad joins?
The girls look up to see a beaming Chad, holding the teeth
molding. Elena just shakes her head...
ELENA
Fuck me...
Chad works the spring hinge of the dentures like a deranged
ventriloquist act...
CHAD
Any time. Any place...
He sets the dentures down on the concrete floor, and takes in the
sight of the magnificent diamonds.
CHAD
(re: diamonds)
Two beauties...
(turning to Marie and Elena)
Two beauties...
He and Elena help Marie out of her blouse while Elena runs her
hands all over him...
Morrison and Kristen's flashlights cut through the darkness as
they move back into Elena's bedroom.
MORRISON
Just so you know, this is called
'breaking and entering'...
KRISTEN
I know all about it. Especially having
something stolen...
MORRISON
Like what?
W
03/22/2004
47.
They get into the bedroom and Morrison's jaw goes slack as Kristen
shines her light on the walls...
KRISTEN
Like my life...
The walls are covered with NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, all concerning
Kristen's rape: "Police unable to find frat house rapist,"
"Teenage victim wants 'justice' in rape case," "'You may not
remember, but you'll never forget,' only thing victim remembers"
K
risten tears some of the articles off the wall.
KRISTEN
Once a thief, always a thief...
They suddenly freeze as the front door swings open, the blood
running cold in their veins as Uncle Marty stumbles inside. They
hold their breath, praying he doesn't see them, standing in
Elena's doorway. Uncle Marty just mumbles something incoherent and
collapses face first onto the couch, out like a light...
Chad reaches into an evidence bag filled with BLUE PILLS. He
removes three...
CHAD
Little blue pills. One of the perks of
the job.
Laughter as
the girl's accept the roofies, swallowing them like
candy. Chad
gulps down the third as Elena begins to run her hands
up and down
Marie's back and shoulders. Chad's hands are all over
Marie as he
helps slip off her bra.
Elena's lips move hungrily across Chad's face, until they find his
mouth. They kiss deeply.
hen they pull apart, Chad helps Elena pull off her T-top, as
Marie runs her hands up and down Elena's bare back. Elena turns
back to her with a mischievous grin.
ELENA
You won't remember...
MARIE
But you'll never forget.
Damn straight.
(
03/22/2004
48.
Jay takes a seat on an uncomfortable metal chair in front of
bullet-proof glass. He's half the man he used to be, broken,
trembling, smoking like a chimney. His mind's still a steel trap,
just one that's rusted shut. He picks up the TWO-WAY PHONE...
THEO
(into phone)
Mr. Clifford, this is Kristen Richards,
Elena Sandoval's probation officer.
JAY
She want to pin me for some more crimes?
Kristen takes the phone from Theo.
KRISTEN
No, Mr. Clifford. I just have a few
questions. I've noticed some
inconsistencies...
JAY
You've noticed some inconsistencies?
JAY
Here's one big fucking glaring
inconsistency for you: I was set up!
KRISTEN
Maybe so, but that's not good enough. Why
were you set up? What would Elena
Sandoval have gained from all this?
Jay hesitates, unsure how, or if, to proceed. Theo shifts
nervously. Jay gives J
up.
AY
What the hell. I'm already in jail. How
much worse can it get? I paid her off,
okay? My assets were tied up in the
condos so we used Marie's diamonds.
defensive)
It wasn't like I had a choice. She had me
by the short an' curlies, understand?
03/22/2004
49.
KRISTEN
But Elena's testimony was damning. Why
wouldn't she play ball?
JAY
What is this, the Spanish Inquisition?
How the fuck should I know? Manipulative
little skank probably figured she could
bleed me for some more money down the
road. But I'll tell you this much, I'm
gonna get those diamonds back, make her
wish she was never born.
Kristen's mind is racing, trying to piece together the puzzle.
Elena stands in her bedroom, disbelief washing over her. No sign
of the newspaper articles. Her walls are barren.
E
LENA
(sotto)
Oh shit...
Chad strolls gingerly down the hallway, opens the door to the
forensics lab, freezing when he sees...
Kristen, waiting patiently for him.
CHAD
Miss...Richards. Is...Is there something
I can do for you?
KRISTEN
I was wondering if you'd do me the favor
of running a quick test.
CHAD
Uh, sure, I guess. Whatcha got for me?
She hands him the Blue Pill she found in Elena's trailer.
KRISTEN
Could you tell me what this is?
Chad tries to keep his cool.
CHAD
No problemo. It'll only take a minute.
While Chad goes about his work, Kristen begins nosing around the
office. Chad looks over his shoulder.
CHAD
Be careful, I got lots of evidence here.
She starts flipping through EVIDENCE PHOTOS...
03/22/2004
54.
KRISTEN
Are these the evidence photos from the
Elena Sandoval rape?
CHAD
They are, but...
KRISTEN
Ever find out what caused these markings?
She holds up the photograph of the four circular indentations the
Judge questioned Chad about in court...
CHAD
Like I told the Judge, I guess they're
finger nail markings...
KRISTEN
They don't look like finger nail markings
to me. They look more like this...
She holds up the back of her hand, where she'd made the
indentation with Marie's ring.
KRISTEN
Would you say these markings are the
same?
CHAD
W-where did you get that?
Kristen smiles.
KRISTEN
Marie gave it to me. But you already knew
that, didn't you, Doc?
Chad has no answer to that. He can only blink stupidly and pray
his silence doesn't incriminate him further. Kristen heads for the
door...
CHAD
(calling after)
The pill. It's Rohypnol. Uh, Roofies.
KRISTEN
Been there. Done that.
The massive front door swings open and Marie crosses the foyer,
and is about to ascend the magnificent staircases when she hears
the clanking of glass coming from the kitchen.
03/22/2004
55.
Her heart is in her throat as she calls out...
MARIE
Hello?
No answer.
Marie enters the lavish kitchen, stops in her tracks when she sees
Chad standing at the full bar, mixing the strongest drink known to
man.
MARIE
What the hell, Chad?
Chad fidgets nervously.
CHAD
That parole officer was sniffin' around
today.
Marie scoffs, steps up to the bar, gets in Chad's face.
MARIE
Not you too. She's just trying to prove
her worthless excuse for an existence.
She doesn't have a thing on us.
CHAD
Yeah, but she's askin' the right
questions. It's only a matter of time. We
gotta make our move.
Marie shakes her head, resolute.
MARIE
No. We stick to the plan. Give the
Curator time to come up with the money...
Chad's trembling hands pour the drink, most of the liquid making
it in to two MARTINI GLASSES...
CHAD
We gotta move fast, keep the heat off...
MARIE
You can't take the heat, get outta the
kitchen.
CHAD
I wanna see 'em. The diamonds.
Make
sure they're safe.
56.
MARIE
They're safe.
She downs half the drink in one giant gulp.
CHAD
I just wanna see 'em. I thought we were
supposed to be partners here.
Chad's trembling, looking like he could lose it at any second.
MARIE
You're gonna be the death of me...
She slugs the rest of the drink, strides away and Chad follows
like a lapdog...
Nothing's been touched in Jay's office, the drops of blood the
Cubans extracted from his thumb as a warning stain the white
carpet black...
Marie walks over to his desk, opens a draw. Removes a metallic
lock box.
CHAD
Open it. I wanna see those puppies.
Marie rolls her eyes, takes a key from a delicate chain around her
neck and fumbles with the lock. Finally she opens the box,
revealing the Mother-Daughter diamonds, resting on velvet lining.
The sparkling diamonds seem to have a calming effect on Chad.
He
stops shaking, his voice becoming more steady...
CHAD
I called the museum. The deal's goin'
down tomorrow. 8 am...
Marie stumbles as she takes a step toward him.
MARIE
What did you...
She looks to the empty glass in her hand, then begins to sway,
watching in horror as Chad drops the diamonds into his pocket...
C
HAD
I'm sorry, okay? But it's not like I had
a choice.
T
03/22/2004
57.
Marie falls flat on her face, her world crashing to BLACK.
FADE IN:
Marie has the phone cradled between her shoulder and ear, rubbing
her aching head, slowly getting her wits back. Nothing like good
old fashioned vengeful rage to combat a nasty hangover.
MARIE
(into phone)
Chad fucked us.
ELENA (V.O.)
(deadpan)
I know. I was there...
MARIE
No, I mean he really fucked us. He
drugged me an' took the diamonds!
Marie's fevered mind is racing as she glances at the wall clock.
7:30. Finally a desperate plan scratches its way to the surface.
MARIE
He's heading to the museum, got himself
an 8am meeting...
ELENA (V.O.)
He's gonna sell the diamonds...
MARIE
Not if we find him first...
The road runs parallel to the swamp again and Chad's eyes nearly
burst from their sockets as he sees the airboat now alongside him,
matching his speed.
ELENA
Give us back the diamonds!
Chad's heart stops.
CHAD
Us?
03/22/2004
59.
He spins round, looks straight ahead at the BMW RACING RIGHT AT
HIM!
CHAD
FUCKING HELL!
He yanks the steering wheel hard left, swerves his car clean off
the dirt road and into the thick swathe of Melaluca trees, Marie's
BMW shoots past, missing his car by inches...
Marie slams on her brakes, brings her BMW to a skidding halt on
the dirt road. She looks back over her shoulder, at the swaying
Melaluca trees. No sign of Chad's car...
Kristen is sitting at Detective Morrison's cluttered desk, her
brow furrowed as she shuffles through the stack of newspaper
articles she pulled from Elena's wall.
Morrison stands in the doorway, watching her.
MORRISON
You look like you could use a drink.
Kristen looks up from the articles, into Morrison's smiling face.
She smiles back.
KRISTEN
When this is all over, I'd like that.
Morrison turns and walks right into a suit with an FBI badge
identifying him as AGENT MILTON DAMMERS. The buzzcut agent drops
BOXES at Morrison's feet.
DAMMERS
More Black Widow leads. I need you to put
them in the evidence locker, Morrison.
MORRISON
That's not my job, Agent Dammers.
DAMMERS
It is now.
Morrison grumbles as he scans his key card, opening the wire mesh
door to the evidence locker. He picks up a box and enters,
Kristen, also carrying a box, a step behind.
MORRISON
I appreciate the help...
KRISTEN
Right back at ya.
Morrison blushes as he absently adds the boxes to the groaning
shelves stuffed with Black Widow evidence. Kristen notices the
bundles of cash stored in and amongst the Black Widow evidence...
KRISTEN
You could have a helluva holiday on that
money.
MORRISON
Recovered from the Black Widow's last
score. If I'd gotten to the scene just
five minutes earlier, I woulda gotten her
as well...
Morrison shakes his head, ruefully, when a sudden sharp beeping
has Kristen reaching into her pocket, fishing out a handheld GPS.
KRISTEN
What the hell...
A red flashing dot moves quickly in the middle of the map...
KRISTEN
Elena...
Kristen blasts down the Blue Bay streets, a siren in the
windshield blaring...
The handheld GPS continues to monitor Elena's exact position in
the midst of the swamp...
E
She checks the flashing GPS signal. Getting closer...
The Curator paces back and forth, like an expectant father, in
front of the empty glass case that used to house the diamonds.
Marie bursts into the Museum, and he strides up to meet her,
shocked when he sees Marie's covered in blood, sweat and guilt...
CURATOR
Marie? Are you alright?
03/22/2004
67.
MARIE
Never better. Got the money?
The Curator nods nervously.
CURATOR
I convinced the board of the
extraordinary circumstances
surrounding...
MARIE
Good.
S
he fishes in her bag for the diamonds...
CURATOR
I...I received a call from your
'associate'. He said he would be handling
the transaction.
MARIE
Change of plans. My 'associate' got tied
up at work. Completely swamped...
The Curator nods, unsure if he inquire further...
Marie finally pulls out two blood soaked Diamonds from her bag,
thrusts them at the Curator. He screws up his wrinkled face,
afraid to touch them...
MARIE
Calm down. It's just blood.
The Curator carefully examines the diamond, turning it over and
over in his hands. Marie stands over him, impatiently tapping her
muddy shoe on the marble floor...
MARIE
So?
CURATOR
I...I'm not sure...
MARIE
Can you get the cash or not?
The Curator looks up to her, bemused.
CURATOR
I can get the cash...it's just...
03/22/2004
69.
Marie smiles a wicked grin.
MARIE
Then let's have those dead presidents...
The Curator carefully sets down the diamonds on the marble floor.
Marie looks at him like he's mad.
MARIE
What the hell are you doing?
03/22/2004
70.
CURATOR
One last test...
The Curator hovers his heel over the biggest Diamond. Marie
screams out!
MARIE
NO!
He slams his foot down and the DIAMOND SHATTERS!
Elena SCREAMS as the passenger side window next to her SMASHES,
SPLINTERING into a million glass fragments.
Hands reach in and grab her, pulling her through the FLAMES...
Seconds later Elena finds herself on the swamp floor, in Kristen's
singed arms...
KRISTEN
You okay?
Elena can barely talk, looking back at the flaming wreckage in
front of her...
KRISTEN
Care to explain?
ELENA
It was...it was an accident...
The flames reflect in her tear-filled eyes.
Marie stands aghast at the sight of her diamonds, in a million
tiny pieces on the museum's marble floor...
CURATOR
Fakes, I'm afraid. Made of glass. Can't
believe they were our top attraction all
these years...
Every muscle in Marie's body contracts...She stands before the
empty diamond exhibit case, runs her fingers over the portrait of
her mother cradling her as a baby.
MARIE
That's my inheritance is it, Mom? Goddamn
Christmas ornaments...
03/22/2004
71.
And as the disbelief gives way to anger she rips the portrait from
the case and tears it to shreds...
CURATOR
Marie, please...
There's no stopping her now. Red-faced, she lashes out at the
display case with a devastating kick, the glass SHATTERING...
CURATOR
Marie, stop this instant!
She continues her rampage regardless, ripping a FIRE EXTINGUISHER
from the wall and hurling it through another display case...
MARIE
I hate you, Mom!
I'm glad you're dead!
Elena sits with her head in her hands, across from Kristen in an
anonymous interview room.
KRISTEN
I told you.
Elena looks up, tears streaking her mascara.
ELENA
Told me what?
KRISTEN
That if you were telling the truth I'd
back you all the way. If you lied to me
there'd be trouble...
Elena slumps back down, her head on the table.
ELENA
Chad swerved off the road, I swear...
KRISTEN
Just swerved for no reason. Just decided
to take a shortcut through the swamp?
Elena sobs, can't look Kristen in the eye.
ELENA
It was an accident...
03/22/2004
72.
The door to the interview room swings open, and Detective Morrison
strides through, a fresh-from-the-printer REPORT in his hands...
MORRISON
Accident my ass.
He flips the pages of the report...
MORRISON
Forensics finds the head trauma that
killed Chad Borman was inflicted by a
single blow from behind.
E
lena looks up, through Panda eyes...
ELENA
The crash. He...he hit his head...
MORRISON
Was that before or after you dragged him
through the swamp?
Elena has no answers as Morrison takes the cuffs from his belt,
snaps them on Elena's wrists.
MORRISON
You got the right to remain silent, which
in your case is probably best, cos of the
shit you come up with...
Kristen stands up, shaking her head.
KRISTEN
That's two strikes, Elena. One more and
you're out.
Elena looks at her pleadingly.
ELENA
I'll do whatever you want.
Kristen stops. Thinks for a moment. Nods to Morrison as he drags
Elena to her feet.
KRISTEN
Yeah. Yeah you will.
ELENA
I'll tell you the truth. I'll tell you
what happened. She killed him, and took
the diamonds. Marie, it was Marie
Clifford...
03/22/2004
73.
Morrison just sneers.
MORRISON
Keep bleeting, Missy. All the way to the
Judge. I think its time he heard the
truth about Jay Clifford's accuser.
KRISTEN
Her arrest doesn't guarantee Jay'll be
cleared, you know that. You need Marie,
you need the proof they set him up...
Morrison considers this.
KRISTEN
You came so close to nailing the Black
Widow, don't let this slip through your
fingers, Detective...
He's about to speak, when Elena's cell phone rings. Kristen takes
it from Elena, looks at the CALLER ID, sees Marie's name...
KRISTEN
Speak of the Devil...
She holds the phone up.
KRISTEN
You're gonna answer it. And you're gonna
say that everything went fine. No one
found Chad's body. The plan's still on.
Do you understand me?
Elena nods slowly. Morrison turns to Kristen.
MORRISON
You thinking what I'm thinking?
K
risten's patient with him.
KRISTEN
This is your chance. Feds can't take this
one from you...
Morrison weighs his options, then finally nods.
Kristen clicks the phone ON, holds it to Elena's ear.
ELENA
Yello...
03/22/2004
74.
Marie speeds wildly down the deserted Blue Bay streets, one
trembling hand holding a cigarette, the other her cellphone.
MARIE (ON PHONE)
The diamonds are fakes. Totally
worthless.
ELENA (V.O.)
No. That can't be true!
MARIE
Believe it. I'm leaving. Tonight.
ELENA (V.O.)
You can't...what about...me...
Marie takes a long drag from her cigarette.
MARIE
Don't you understand? There's no money.
Nothing. Zip. Zilch. Zero. How am I
supposed to take care of your broke ass?
Kristen is listening in on the whole conversation. She cups her
hand over the phone, whispers to Elena.
KRISTEN
Tell her she has to meet you. Tell her
she can't leave...
Elena nods and Kristen puts the phone back to her lips.
ELENA
I...I gotta see you.
MARIE (V.O.)
I'll send you a photo.
ELENA
Please. Just one last time.
MARIE (V.O.)
I'm gone, gone, gonski.
Elena's reeling. Kristen motions for her to continue.
ELENA
I think maybe...maybe there's a way we
could still get some money...
03/22/2004
75.
Silence on the end of the line...
Marie considers this for a long moment.
Finally...
MARIE
Okay, talk...
ELENA (V.O.)
Not over the phone. We gotta meet.
MARIE
School swimming pool. One hour.
Click. She's hung up. Kristen nods to Morrison...
KRISTEN
Where'd you keep the wire taps?
MORRISON
Evidence locker.
KRISTEN
Gimme the key.
He tosses her his electronic keycard...
E
Morrison listens nervously to Elena's tinny voice coming in
through the speaker...
ELENA (V.O.)
Is this thing working?
The Detective shoots Kristen a concerned look.
MORRISON
She's gonna blow it...
03/22/2004
76.
Kristen winces as she listens to the girls' conversation.
E
LENA (V.O.)
(through the speakers)
We're gonna go to Jay. Tell him what we
did.
MARIE (V.O.)
Like hell we are.
03/22/2004
77.
Morrison and Kristen listen intently in their headphones, unable
to breath...
Jay laughs, as he sits across from Marie and Elena, separated by
an inch of bullet proof glass. Theo stands by the door.
JAY
Well, well, well. Who'd have thought.
What a pleasant surprise. I guess you
guys have kissed and made up?
MARIE
Very funny. Did you know the diamonds
were fakes?
Jay nods slowly.
JAY
Your Mom hocked them years ago. Boozed it
all away. You already know the end of her
sorry story...
Marie's jaw tightens. Jay leans back.
JAY
So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
MARIE
We want money. Whatever you've got in
your safe at the beach condos.
Jay bursts out laughing again.
JAY
Of course you do. Of course you do.
03/22/2004
79.
ELENA
We'll get you out of here...
Jay stops laughing, leans back in to the inch thick glass.
JAY
You will?
Marie holds up a DIGITAL VIDEO TAPE...
JAY
Is that what I think it is?
MARIE
You give us the combination and this goes
in the nearest mail box, tied with a
pretty pink bow.
JAY
How do I know it's the real tape?
MARIE
You're gonna have to trust us.
JAY
I've been down that road before.
Marie opens the cassette housing, ready to rip the tape apart...
MARIE
This is non-negotiable.
Theo interjects...
THEO
Sir, we have no grounds for appeal. This
could be our only chance.
MARIE
What's the combination?
The tortured screams of inmates echo in Jay's ears.
JAY
I can't...
MARIE
No such word as 'can't'...
A PRISON GUARD puts a massive hand on Jay's shoulder...
P
RISON GUARD
Time's up, Mr. Clifford.
03/22/2004
80.
Jay sighs...
JAY
(to Marie)
Fine. 08-20-99.
Marie shakes her head.
MARIE
The combination's the day Mom died, you
sick fuck?
Jay's led away in shackles...
Marie handles the car like a Formula One driver, and with twice
the intensity. The G-force pins Elena back against the seat.
ELENA
Slow down!
Marie steps on the gas.
ELENA
We're in a world of shit!
Marie steps on the gas.
ELENA
We'll never get away with this. You know
that don't you?
Marie steps on the gas. She ain't saying a word, and time's
running out for Elena...
Morrison struggles to keep up with Marie's Bullit-esque driving.
Kristen stays focused on the one-sided conversation in her
headphones...
KRISTEN
Come on, Elena...Keep pushing...
03/22/2004
81.
Marie enters the makeshift office like a wolf stalking her prey,
heading straight for the safe. With a rock steady hand, she works
the lock...CLICK...
MARIE
One down...
Kristen listens intently to the live feed.
ELENA (V.O.)
(over headphones)
Marie! Please, I can't do this...
Marie's working the safe combination like a master thief, spinning
it nimbly between her buffed nails. CLICK...
MARIE
Two down.
Elena stands in the makeshift office doorway, trying to coax
something incriminating from Marie's perfect lips.
ELENA
I told you not to kill Chad. I'll tell it
to the police.
Marie doesn't even look round, concentrating on the job at hand.
Elena's reeling.
03/22/2004
82.
ELENA
I'll tell 'em you made me lie about your
stepfather raping me, made me perjure
myself on the stand, went and killed
Chad, and now...
MARIE
(sotto)
99. A very good year...
CLICK. Third and final tumbler falls. The safe door swings open,
revealing a STACK of CASH and Jay's HANDGUN...
Kristen shakes her head. It's hopeless, Elena can't get Marie to
say an incriminating word...
MORRISON
This has gotta end.
KRISTEN
It's gonna end. One way or another...
Marie pulls out a wad of crisp, clean bills, draws them across her
nose like a wine connoisseur.
MARIE
Money. Always in style.
She dances over to Elena, waves the cash in her face.
ELENA
Why'd you do it? Why'd Chad have to die?
Marie slides up against Elena, fluttering the cash over her in the
world's most expensive shower. Elena couldn't be less interested,
focused on getting that confession...
ELENA
You killed him, Marie. You murdered him
in cold blood...
Marie presses up against Elena, pushing her up against the
unfinished dry wall. Kisses her passionately, finally silencing
her for a few, brief, electric seconds. And when she pulls away
her fingers dance down Elena's shirt until...
S
he rips the microphone from Elena's chest. Stands there with the
dangling cord in her hands, her face caught in a permanent snarl.
The blood drains from Elena's face...
03/22/2004
83.
A piercing feedback forces Kristen to throw aside the headphones.
She looks to Morrison.
KRISTEN
She's been made...
Morrison draws his gun.
MORRISON
Stay here...
Kristen shakes her head resolutely.
KRISTEN
I got us into this...
BANG! A GUNSHOT echoes in the darkness...
MORRISON
Just stay in the car! Please...
Morrison sprints over to the building site, leaving Kristen in the
car, alone.
Elena stands with her hands up, an ugly bullet hole in the wall
just beside her. Marie keeps Jay's gun trained on her as she
unloads the cash from the safe...
MARIE
You stupid fucking Sherbert. You think
you could sell me out?
ELENA
They made me do it...
MARIE
Morrison doesn't know his prick from a
pogo stick. And that bitch Parole
Officer, she hasn't got the balls for
this...
Marie takes dead aim once more...
ELENA
Please, don't...
Marie's finger tightens on the trigger...
03/22/2004
84.
BOOM!
Kristen tenses as the gunshot echoes throughout the construction
site. She reaches across to the driver's seat, grabs the
SHOTGUN...
Elena scrambles across the concrete floor, desperately trying to
make it to the relative safety of one of the support pillars. She
sees the forensic UV light switch on the floor, reaches for it...
MARIE
stands in the shattered doorway, surveys the expansive, unfinished
floor. Is about to unleash a hail of bullets when...
The WORK LIGHTS flicker out, replaced by the eerie ULTRA VIOLET
LIGHTS scattered around the unfinished floor...Bathed in the
florescent blue glow of the lights, Elena scrambles to safety
behind a pillar. Her shirt GLOWS, her eyes like beacons...
MORRISON
Sweeps through the second floor, meticulously checking every
corner, every shadow...
KRISTEN
Runs towards the unfinished building, looking up to the UV glow on
the fourth floor. She sprints for the INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR...
MARIE
scours the bizarre darkness, hears a sound. BOOM! The orange
muzzle flash illuminates the floor briefly as Marie shoots
randomly. The flimsy plaster walls EXPLODE...
MORRISON
Enters the third floor from the fire escape, continues his
meticulous sweep of the building.
KRISTEN
Stands in the industrial elevator, jabbing the 4th floor button,
hyperventilating as more gunshots EXPLODE. She clutches Morrison's
shotgun to her chest, getting closer to the top floor.
ELENA
shields herself as plaster rains down on her, unable to see
through the cloud of dust under the UV lights, until...
03/22/2004
85.
BOOM! A bullet sparks off rebar inches from her foot. She looks up
to see the barrel of Jay's gun. Marie's face is contorted
maniacally as she squeezes down on the trigger...
MORRISON
Runs up the fire escape stairs when a final deafening GUN SHOT
rings out. Followed by SCREAMS. He rips open the fourth floor fire
door, tearing through the building, pushing through thick plastic
sheeting until he finds himself under the UV glow.
T
hick plumes of blood, black under the UV light, stain the walls
and floor. He sees Elena, in a fetal ball, trembling
uncontrollably.
Beside her, Marie lies dead, her chest a gaping crimson mess,
Jay's gun still clutched tightly in her cold, dead hands.
Kristen looks up at him, almost too shocked to speak.
Morrison's
shotgun is still smoking in her hands.
KRISTEN
I didn't have a choice. She was gonna
kill Elena.
Morrison steps forward, calmly, takes the gun from her.
MORRISON
It's gonna be okay.
Morrison gets the shock of his life when he enters the usually
quiet police station and finds himself in the midst of utter
pandemonium.
Federal Officers are everywhere.
He tries to pick his way through the crowd when he's intercepted
by Officer Entwistle.
OFFICER ENTWISTLE
You better come with me, Detective.
Entwistle leads Morrison into his office, where Agent Dammers sits
behind his desk.
AGENT DAMMERS
Detective Morrison. So good to finally
see you.
MORRISON
What the hell, Dammers?
AGENT DAMMERS
I should be asking you the same question.
Morrison stands in the middle of the evidence locker, dumbfounded.
Dammers watches him, his arms crossed.
MORRISON
It's...gone.
DAMMERS
That's right, Morrison. Every last bit of
evidence from the Black Widow case.
03/22/2004
89.
DAMMERS(CONT'D)
Not to mention the money you confiscated.
All $427,000.
MORRISON
But how...
DAMMERS
I was hoping you'd be able to answer that
question.
MORRISON
What in God's name are you talking about?
I didn't have anything to do with it!
DAMMERS
Well, your key card was the last one that
opened this locker.
Morrison's heart is beating a mile a minute.
MORRISON
Holy shit. Kristen...
A PRETTY RECEPTIONIST sits behind a sparse desk when the phone
rings.
PRETTY RECEPTIONIST
D
ade County Parole. How can I direct your
call?
Morrison paces back and forth, on the phone, as Dammers watches,
not saying a word...
MORRISON
(into phone)
This is Detective Morrison, Blue Bay PD.
I was wondering if you had a forwarding
number for Kristen Richards...
PRETTY RECEPTIONIST(V.O.)
Who?
MORRISON
Kristen Richards. She's one of your
officers. Has cases up here in Blue Bay.
The receptionist's fingers nimbly dance across the keyboard in
front of her.
90.
PRETTY RECEPTIONIST
I'm sorry, Detective. There's no one here
by that name.
MORRISON
No, of course there is. I worked with her
personally. I...
PRETTY RECEPTIONIST
I have no record of a Kristen Richards
ever working here. Besides, Blue Bay's
out of our jurisdiction...
Morrison struggles to control his emotions...
MORRISON
Oh no. No, no, no...
Morrison paces the infamous crime scene, at wit's end. Dammers
stands off to the side, just watching him with a bemused look
etched across his face.
MORRISON
She was the Black Widow. Her and that
little...
He tries to think of an appropriate slur for Elena. Can't come up
with anything, continues pacing frantically.
MORRISON
Played me like a fool.
Dammers shrugs.
DAMMERS
Hind sight's 20-20. No need to be so hard
on yourself, Morrison...
(beat, smile)
That's my job.
MORRISON
You smug son of a bitch. It's not like
you knew who she was anymore than I did.
Dammers nods slowly.
DAMMERS
That's the God's honest truth. But at
least I didn't give her my evidence
locker keycard.
03/22/2004
92.
DAMMERS(CONT'D)
And I didn't lie about who fired the
shots that killed the Clifford kid.
Morrison's heart sinks. He looks like he's going to faint.
Steadies himself, placing both hands against the wall, just as Jay
did that fateful night seemingly a lifetime ago...
An anonymous, luxurious office. A fat, balding, semi-conscious MAN
lies curled up on the floor as Elena, half undressed and wearing a
black wig, shovels cash into her oversized purse...
There's a crackle on her WALKIE-TALKIE...
KRISTEN (V.O.)
We got problems...
From outside, she can hear the wailing of SIRENS. Getting closer.
ELENA
Almost done here.
KRISTEN (V.O.)
Leave it. Come on!
96.
Elena gets hesitantly to her feet, slides a stack of $100s in her
pocket for good measure.
KRISTEN (V.O.)
He gonna be able to make an ID?
Elena glances at the Man on the floor, his puffy eyes glazed over
like a jelly donut.
ELENA
Not on your life. I gave him enough
roofies to make an elephant forget.
Jay carefully places the stacks of cash into the wall safe in his
unfinished office.
KRISTEN (O.S.)
That's an awful lot of money...
Jay spins round, flabbergasted that someone's watching him.
JAY
Who the hell...
03/22/2004
97.
KRISTEN
Not enough though. Gonna need those
Diamonds if you're gonna ride out this
disaster...
JAY
What? What the hell do you mean?
Kristen calmly reaches into her purse, pulls out a handful of
marbles. Throws them onto the ground, letting them roll towards
B
Jay...
ut they stop, change direction, all coming rolling back in a
small circle, until they come to rest in the middle of the
concrete floor...
KRISTEN
The building's built on a sink hole, Jay.
You know it, and I know it. Gonna need to
think fast if you wanna keep the Cubans
off your back...
Jay's tiny mind can't take it all in.
JAY
How'd you...how'd you know all this...
KRISTEN
It's what we do.
JAY
We?
Elena walks seductively into the unfinished office. It's on.
Marie sits in the bleachers by the side of the school dive pool,
looking at her Mother's soon-to-be-diamond ring through teary
eyes...
MARIE
I just want what's mine...
Elena stalks the bleachers behind her.
ELENA
The diamonds are your inheritance. You
deserve them...
MARIE
My fucking Step-Monster'll never give me
the Goddamn key...
03/22/2004
98.
Elena jumps down the bleachers, sits down next to Marie.
ELENA
So you take it, one way or another...
Behind closed doors, Chad's completing yet another dubious
transaction, handing over a bag of roofies. The buyer this
time...Marie...
MARIE
You take a check?
CHAD
Money talks, bullshit walks. I got
strippers to feed...
Marie fishes out the money from her purse.
MARIE
How'd you like to make some real cash?
CHAD
Chad likes the sound of that.
And it's that simple...
Chad uses Jay's teeth mouldings to bite Elena, as Marie trains
Jay's video camera on her, wailing on her in a drunken stupor.
ELENA
Hey, that hurt!
MARIE
Shut it, bitch. No pain, no gain...
Elena's face is pressed against the concrete wall...
Chad sits at his video console, all alone, expertly manipulating
the audio and video footage.
CHAD
We'll put you right here, and...
Chad presses play. On the video screen a frightened Elena is
huddled against the wall.
03/22/2004
99.
JAY (V.O.)
C'mon now baby, you can do it...
Elena watches as Marie and Theo drive away, then turns to the
glistening Mother Daughter diamonds. She opens a case with two
identical GLASS REPLICAS, and replaces the diamonds...
All the while, Uncle Marty SNORES his head off...
ELENA
(to Uncle Marty, irritated)
Will you knock that off? They're gone.
Uncle Marty's eyes snap open.
