      MUSIC CUE: "A MINOR INCIDENT" BY BADLY DRAWN BOY.

      WE START HIGH ABOVE THE OBSERVATION DECK OF THE EMPIRE STATE 
      BUILDING AND AS WE DESCEND, WE HEAR EARL MUMFORD, 60, AFRICAN 
      AMERICAN.

                                  EARL (V.O.)

                To anyone who says true love, the kind 

                you read about in fairy tales, doesn't 

                exist anymore, I say, Spend some time 

                on the Empire State Building.  I've 

                been up here thirty years, and I've 

                seen all kinds of love stories.

      WE'RE CLOSE ENOUGH NOW TO SEE THAT A CROWD HAS GATHERED 
      AROUND A POTENTIAL JUMPER, 30, WHO IS PERCHED PRECARIOUSLY ON 
      THE RAILING.  AS THE CAMERA SETTLES ON HIS SCARED FACE:

                                  EARL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                The best one of all started not very 

                long ago...with a man whose heart was 

                broken.

                                  JUMPER

                (WEEPY)  I thought she loved me.

      REVEAL EARL HOLDING A CROWD BACK AS HE CONSIDERS WHAT TO DO.

                                  EARL (V.O.)

                That's me, Earl Mumford, the handsome 

                  gentleman in the uniform, bringing my 

                years of experience to this delicate 

                  situation.  "True Love" (Revised)              12/15/09                       2.


                                  EARL (CONT'D)

                I think you should jump!  

      THE CROWD GASPS.

                                  EARL (CONT'D)

                I'm not convinced gravity has any 

                effect at this altitude and you might 

                just be in for the ride of your life.

      THE JUMPER CONSIDERS THIS AS A HANDSOME MAN, 29, STEPS 
      FORWARD BEFORE EARL CAN SAY MORE.  THIS IS HENRY PARR. 

                                  HENRY

                  (POLITELY)  Um..., excuse me, sir, 

                could I take a shot?

                                  EARL

                (SOTTO) Ooh, like a good cop-bad cop 

                thing?  Sure.  Bring down the hammer.

                                  JUMPER

                Nothing you say is going to change my 

                mind.  (WEEPY) I thought Gina and I 

                were going to be together forever.

                                  HENRY

                  I believe there's a person you're 

                meant to spend your life with, and if 

                Gina left you, that's because that 

                person is walking around down there 

                right now wondering if today is the 

                day you'll finally meet.  

      BEAT.  MURMURS FROM THE CROWD.  "THAT'S BULLSHIT," "JUMP."  "True Love" (Revised)              12/15/09                       3.


                                  HENRY (CONT'D)

                I might be wrong.  But what if I'm 

                not?  If you jump, you'll never know.

                                  EARL

                Unless I'm right about gravity.

      HENRY'S WORDS APPEAR TO BE HAVING AN EFFECT ON THE JUMPER.

                                  HENRY

                (HOLDING OUT HIS HAND)  Come on.  

                Life's too exciting to miss what's 

                going to happen next.

      THE JUMPER TAKES THIS IN AND AFTER A BEAT HE REACHES FOR 
      HENRY'S OUTSTRETCHED HAND AS THE CROWD APPLAUDS AND BOOS AND 
      THE POLICE FINALLY ARRIVE AND TAKE OVER AS WE 

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


      THINGS HAVE CALMED DOWN.  HENRY AND EARL ARE THE ONLY ONES 
      LEFT UP HERE.  EARL WALKS HENRY TO THE ELEVATOR.

                                  EARL

                I had the situation in hand, you know?

                                  HENRY

                (NICE GUY) I know.

                                  EARL

                But that being said, in addition to 

                  believing that if he had jumped he 

                very well might have floated out into 

                space, I also believed all that stuff 

                you were saying, about finding the 

                person you're meant to be with.  

                                  (MORE)  "True Love" (Revised)              12/15/09                       4.

                                  EARL (CONT'D)

                I'm lucky, because I found her and 

                she's my wife.

                                  HENRY

                You are lucky.  And I believe all that 

                stuff, too.  That's why I'm up her 

                today.  My girlfriend, Erin, gave me 

                an ultimatum.

                                  EARL

                (HANDS UP) My wife gave me these 

                gloves.

                                  HENRY

                  (PLOUGHING AHEAD)  Yeah, Erin's great.  

                She's smart and pretty and funny... 

                well, not funny, but, hey sometimes 

                life's not funny... and, yes, sure, 

                she's a little bit emotionally shut 

                down, but who wants to be with someone 

                who's always hugging you or telling 

                you how great you are? 

                                  EARL

                My wife walks around the house 

                  completely naked.

      HENRY'S NOT SURE WHAT THIS HAS TO WITH ANYTHING:

                                  HENRY

                Anyway, Erin had been hinting around 

                that she'd like to get married.    "True Love" (Revised)              12/15/09                       5.


                                  EARL

                Hinting how?  Was she making a lot of 

                stews?

                                  HENRY

                But then a couple days ago she told me 

                that if I don't ask her by the end of 

                the week, I shouldn't bother since 

                there are plenty of guys who'd love to 

                be with her who didn't cry during 

                "Marley and Me."  And she's right.  

                She's a catch.   But, gosh... seeing 

                that guy up there today... would I 

                jump off a building if I couldn't be 

                with Erin?

                                  EARL

                Might be fun.

                                  HENRY

                I just wish I could know for sure that 

                she's the one.  So that's why I came 

                up here today.  I was looking for some 

                kind of sign.  But...(STEPPING ONTO 

                  ELEVATOR)...I guess I didn't get it.

                                  EARL

                Yet.  You didn't get it yet.  But you 

                will.  Trust me on that.  "True Love" (Revised)              12/15/09                       6.


                                  HENRY

                You know, I don't know why, but I do.  

                Maybe it's because you look and sound 

                a little like Morgan Freeman.  Anyway, 

                thanks.  Thanks for listening.  (AS 

                DOORS CLOSE) And if you ever meet 

                Erin, don't tell her, but--

      THE DOORS ARE CLOSED NOW, BUT HENRY'S STILL TALKING.

                                  HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                I cried during "Driving Miss Daisy!"

      EARL IS ABOUT TO TURN AWAY WHEN THE OTHER ELEVATOR ARRIVES 
      WITH A DING.  THE DOORS OPEN, REVEALING KATE WINDSOR.  SHE IS 
      27, PRETTY IN A CLEAN-SCRUBBED MID-WESTERN WAY.

                                  KATE

                (GETTING OFF ELEVATOR)  Earl!

                                  EARL

                Hello, Kate.  What am I up to?  Not 

                much.  Just saving lives.

                                  KATE

                I heard it was pretty exciting.

                                  EARL

                All in a day's work.

                                  KATE

                Well, I know you're closing.  But I 

                think I left my hat up here earlier, 

                before all the commotion.  I was with 

                a client -- who decided to lease the 

                entire 89th floor, up high!  "True Love" (Revised)              12/15/09                       7.


      EARL HI-FIVES HER.  SHE MISSES, FALLING.  EARL CATCHES HER.

                                  EARL

                How do you do it, Kate?   You're 

                leasing more space than ever.

                                  KATE

                Oh, I just tell people that if they 

                have an office here, they'll get to do 

                what I do: (POINTING OFF) come up 

                every day to remind themselves how 

                lucky they are to live in a city this 

                  beautiful and vibrant and... romantic.

                                  EARL

                  (SMILING, THEIR THING)  If you're 

                hitting on me again, I'll remind you 

                I'm a happily married man.

                                  KATE

                  (SMILING)  Always worth a try.  (THEN) 

                Anyway, now I can't find my hat.

                                  EARL

                Hmm, I don't think I've seen any loose 

                hats, and I do tend to notice hats.

      KATE LOOKS DOWN AT A HAT, SITTING ON THE LEDGE RIGHT NEXT TO 
      THEM.  EARL NOTICES IT AND IS SURPRISED. 

                                  EARL (CONT'D)

                Well, look at that. (HANDING HER HAT) 

                Earl Mumford, at your service. 

      HE HANDS KATE THE HAT.  SHE TAKES IT WITH A SMILE, BUT IT'S 
      CLEARLY NOT HERS.  SHE PUTS IT ON.  IT LOOKS RIDICULOUS.  "True Love" (Revised)              12/15/09                       8.


                                  EARL (CONT'D)

                  Good-looking hat.  (OFF HER LOOK)  But 

                it's not your hat, is it?  Let me do a 

                quick lap, see if I overlooked it.  

                Not likely, but you never know.

      JUST AS EARL EXITS AROUND THE CORNER, THE ELEVATOR ARRIVES 
      WITH A DING!  KATE LOOKS OVER AS HENRY GETS OFF.

                                  HENRY

                Forgot my... (SEEING KATE)... hat.

                                  KATE

                (HOLDING UP HAT, SMITTEN) Is this it?

      HENRY DOESN'T LOOK DOWN AT THE HAT, TRANSFIXED BY KATE.

                                  HENRY

                Yes.

      THEY CROSS WITHOUT TAKING THEIR EYES OFF EACH OTHER. HENRY 
      TAKES HIS HAT, BUT KATE DOESN'T LET GO.  THEY'RE BOTH HOLDING 
      AN EDGE WHEN EARL RE-ENTERS, HOLDING FOUR OR FIVE HATS.

                                  EARL

                Somehow, I missed these ones -- (TO 

                HENRY) Hey!  It's you.

                                  HENRY

                I think I got my sign!

      JUST THEN FIREWORKS EXPLODE BEHIND HENRY AND KATE, PERFECTLY 
      FRAMING THEM IN A SHOWER OF COLORFUL LIGHTS.

                                  EARL

                  (OBLIVIOUS)  When you were downstairs?

      AND AS HENRY AND KATE SMILE INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES, WE 

                                                                            FADE OUT.

                                    TIFFANY

                (TO KATE, RE: HENRY)  I'm just saying, 

                he really loves you.  Why not consider 

                giving him a second chance?

                                  CONNIE

                Don't bother.  Kate's not gonna budge.  

                She's got a thing about lying.  

                                    TIFFANY

                But you're perfect for him and you 

                both love sharks.

                                  KATE

                I don't love sharks.  I just said that 

                because he loved sharks and I wanted 

                him to like me.

                                    TIFFANY

                Oh.  (A BEAT)  But wait, isn't that 

                lying?  I mean, maybe he didn't tell 

                you about his girlfriend because he 

                wanted you to like him.

      THIS SINKS IN.

                                  KATE

                You know what, Tiffany's right.

                                  CONNIE

                Not a sentence you hear everyday.

                                  KATE

                Tiffany, I'm gonna take your advice."True Love" (Revised)              12/15/09                       38.


                                  CONNIE

                (RE: SENTENCE) That's two.

                                  KATE

                  (EXCITED) Let's go.

      AND TIFFANY AND KATE RUN OFF.  CONNIE LOOKS AT THE KIDS.

                                  CONNIE

                Don't worry, I'll never leave you.


      ...CLOSE ON CONNIE (IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE SHE IS WHO LARRY IS 
      SEEING).  PULL BACK TO REVEAL THE GIRLS HURRYING ALONG.  
      CONNIE'S STILL HOLDING THE BABIES.

                                  CONNIE

                So he's not at home and his cell goes 

                right to voicemail.  Maybe you should 

                call him at work tomorrow.

                                    TIFFANY

                No, we need to find him tonight.

                                  KATE

                  Tiffany's right again. 

      CONNIE ROLLS HER EYES.  KATE LOOKS TO TIFFANY.

                                  KATE (CONT'D)

                He said they go to that bar a lot.  

                Let's look there.

                                  CONNIE

                We'll never get a cab at this hour.

                                    TIFFANY

                Sure, we will.

      SHE STEPS OUT INTO TRAFFIC.

                                  CONNIE

                (TO GIRL BABY)  Oh, here comes a good 

                lesson for you, Portia: Use your body 

                to get a man's attention.

      JUST THEN TIFFANY SHOUTS VERY FORCEFULLY IN A LANGUAGE THAT 
      ISN'T ENGLISH.  A CAB PULLS OVER.

                                    TIFFANY (SUBTITLED)

      CONNIE AND KATE ARE IN SHOCK.  AS THEY GET INTO THE CAB,

                                  CONNIE

                You speak Pakistani?

                                    TIFFANY

                No.  Because there's no such language.  

                I do speak Urdu, though.  (EXPLAINING)  

                Army brat.

                                    TIFFANY

                  (SINGING, ABSENTLY) I saw the sign...

                                  CONNIE

                Aha!  You sang it.  It's in there.  

                See you hate that song, but it's in 

                your head.  Just like Larry's in mine.

                                    TIFFANY

                I guess I like that song after all.

                                  CONNIE

                No.  No, you don't.  You're totally 

                missing the point!

      AS KATE AND TIFFANY HEAD TOWARD THE BAR, CONNIE FOLLOWS.


      THE ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS AND LARRY STEPS OUT.  HENRY FOLLOWS, 
      LOOKING A BIT STRICKEN.

                                  HENRY

                You know, I want to meet your new 

                  girlfriend, I really do, but I haven't 

                been here since... since...

                                  LARRY

                Since what?  Oh, since Kate?

      HENRY COVERS HIS EYES, IN PAIN.

                                  LARRY (CONT'D)

                Boy it completely slipped my mind.  

                When my new girlfriend mentioned that 

                this would be the perfect place for 

                our second date and that we should 

                bring our best friends... the irony, 

                obvious as it is, it never hit me.

                                  HENRY

                Well, it's hitting me.  It's hitting 

                me hard.  (STEPPING BACK ONTO 

                  ELEVATOR)  I don't think I can stay.

                                  LARRY

                (PULLING HIM OUT)  What?  No, no.  

                You've got to.  That's the whole 

                point.  You've got to meet my new 

                  girlfriend.  And her friend.

                                  LARRY (CONT'D)

                (LOOKING AROUND, ANNOYED)  I wonder 

                where my new girlfriend is.  She was 

                supposed to be here by now but that 

                would be so typical of her to screw 

                this up.

      EARL WALKS UP.

                                  EARL

                (TO HENRY)  Well, well, well.  If it 

                isn't my co-hero.  I'm tempted to 

                  encourage some people to think about 

                jumping just so we can get the band 

                back together.

                                  LARRY

                You're sort of the opposite of a 

                security guard, aren't you?

                                  HENRY

                (TAKING HIS HAT OFF AND SETTING IT 

                DOWN) How are you, sir?  This is my 

                friend Larry.  Larry's just fallen in 

                love.  (RE: EARL) This guy knows all 

                there is to know about love.

                                  LARRY

                Is that right?

                                  EARL

                Well, I've been standing up here a 

                long time and this is just about the 

                most romantic half acre on earth."True Love" (Revised)              12/15/09                       48.


                                  LARRY

                I think all of France would beg to 

                differ.

      AS EARL REACTS:

                                  HENRY

                  (QUIETLY)  Uh, I'll be right back.

      HENRY MOVES OFF BUT LARRY AND EARL ARE TOO FOCUSED ON THEIR 
      GROWING DISLIKE FOR EACH OTHER TO NOTICE.

                                  EARL

                  (ANNOYED) You say you're in love?

                                  LARRY

                That's right.  Very much so.

                                  EARL

                Are you walking on air?

                                  LARRY

                Nope.  The laws of gravity still apply 

                to me.

                                  EARL

                (SOTTO)  Hmph, gravity.

                                  LARRY

                (WHAT DID HE SAY?)  I'm sorry?

      IN THE B.G. WE SEE HENRY GET ON THE ELEVATOR.

                                  LARRY

                Is that right?  Well, maybe if you 

                were a guard on the Eiffel Tower, I'd 

                give a crap.  (THEN, REALIZING HENRY'S 

                GONE)  Wait, where'd he go?

      LARRY TAKES OFF AROUND THE CORNER LOOKING FOR HENRY AS KATE 
      AND CONNIE ENTER FROM THE OTHER ELEVATOR.  CONNIE KEEPS 
      LOOKING FOR LARRY OVER THE FOLLOWING.

                                  KATE

                Oh, hi, Earl.

                                  EARL

                Kate, well there's a sight for sore 

                eyes.  I haven't seen you in forever.

                                  KATE

                I had a little relationship trouble 

                and it all started up here so I 

                haven't had the heart to come back.  

                (THEN, RE: CONNIE)  But the good news 

                is, my cousin's in love.

                                  EARL

                  (DISBELIEF) She's your cousin?

      CONNIE ROLLS HER EYES.  AND THEN SHE NOTICES LARRY COMING 
      AROUND THE CORNER LOOKING PANICKED.

                                  KATE

                (TO EARL)  Earl, meet Connie.

                                  EARL

                Hello, Connie.

      SHE CROSSES AWAY.

                                  EARL

                She seems wonderful.  (THEN) So, you 

                want to tell old Earl what happened?

                                  KATE

                I will someday.  But right now when I 

                talk about it my eyes get really wet 

                and I need to lie down for two weeks.

      KATE LOOKS AWAY.  SHE NOTICES SOMETHING OFF CAMERA.

                                  KATE (CONT'D)

                Earl, can you excuse me a second? 

      SHE CROSSES AWAY AS WE ANGLE ON CONNIE AND LARRY, WHO ARE 
      ALREADY FIGHTING.

                                  CONNIE

                What do you mean you lost him?

                                  LARRY

                I mean, that if you had shown up at 

                the appointed time we wouldn't be 

                having this conversation.

                                  CONNIE

                Wait?  This was my fault?

      AS THEY CONTINUE ARGUING, ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR, WHICH OPENS 
      REVEALING HENRY, WHO HURRIES OUT ONTO THE DECK, ANNOUNCING:

                                  HENRY

                Did it again!  Forgot my hat. 

      HE LOOKS AROUND BUT DOESN'T SEE IT.  THEN HE HEARS:

                                  KATE (O.S.)

                (RE: HAT) Is this it?"True Love" (Revised)              12/15/09                       51.


      HE SPINS AROUND AND THERE'S KATE, HOLDING HIS HAT.  SHE'S 
      PERFECTLY FRAMED IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF THE SETTING SUN.  

      MUSIC CUE: "THE SIGN," BY ACE OF BASE (BUT A COOL NEW 
      VERSION)

      THEY CROSS SLOWLY TOWARD EACH OTHER, MEET IN THE MIDDLE, AND 
      FOR A LONG BEAT JUST LOOK AT EACH OTHER.  WE HEAR EARL.

                                  EARL (V.O.)

                Now they could have had a real ugly 

                  discussion about her feelings of 

                betrayal and his frustration about not 

                being able to explain himself, but 

                when it's love, you don't have heated 

                  discussions... 

      ANGLE ON CONNIE AND LARRY, OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT THEIR 
      PLAN HAS WORKED, HAVING A HEATED DISCUSSION.

                                  LARRY

                I'm just saying in an operation like 

                this, precision counts.

                                  CONNIE

                  Operation?  Don't call it an 

                  operation.  "Operation" implies that 

                the people participating in it have 

                the tiniest shred of competence.

                                  LARRY

                How about the tiniest shred of being 

                able to read a clock?  Do they have 

                that? 

      AS WE ANGLE BACK TO KATE AND HENRY..."True Love" (Revised)              12/15/09                       52.


                                  EARL (V.O.)

                No, when it's true love...

      JUST THEN, KATE GRABS HENRY'S FACE AND THEY KISS.  A SERIOUS 
        SOLDIER-HOME-FROM-WAR TYPE KISS. 

                                  EARL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                ...you just kiss.

      THE KISS GOES ON A WHILE.  WIDEN TO REVEAL EARL WATCHING THEM 
      WITH A BIG SMILE.  BUT AS HIS V.O. CONTINUES, THE CAMERA 
      DRIFTS BACK OVER TO CONNIE AND LARRY... 

                                  EARL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                Tell me there are no modern day love 

                  stories?!  Hmph!  You want true love?  

                Come to the Empire State Building.  

                Look in front of you...

      ...AND NOW WE'RE RIGHT ON CONNIE AND LARRY, WHO ARE STILL 
      FIGHTING, STILL OBLIVIOUS.

                                  CONNIE

                You know what, I'm glad this didn't 

                work out, because now I never have to 

                see you again.

                                  LARRY

                Not as glad as me!

                                  EARL (V.O.)

                ...you can't miss it.

      AND AS THE MUSIC COMES UP, THE CAMERA PULLS BACK FOR A 
      TABLEAU OF CONNIE AND LARRY AND HENRY AND KATE DOING WHAT 
      THEY DO BEST AND IT KEEPS GOING, BACK AND BACK, UNTIL ALL WE 
      CAN MAKE OUT IS THE GLITTERING NEW YORK SKYLINE AS WE,

                                                                            FADE OUT.
