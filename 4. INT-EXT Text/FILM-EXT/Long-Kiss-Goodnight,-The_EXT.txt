CHILDREN, dozens of them, bursting from houses. Slapping of
screen doors. A HORSE-DRIVEN SLEIGH is rattling down Main
Street. Flanked by kids. Christmas carols, droning from
loudspeakers.
HAPPY, LAUGHING SANTA waves howdy, chortling his "Ho's" in
groups of three, meanwhile he's really a grizzled old fire
marshall named EARL, freezing his nuts off.
Beside him sits MRS. CLAUS, about whom we notice two things:
First, she's the June in this June/December pair -- and
second, she's to kill for, an effortlessly beautiful woman.
For the record, meet SAMANTHA CAINE.
SAMANTHA
How you holdin' up?
EARL
Freezing my nuts off.
Santa produces a bottle of Seagrams. Starts to open it.
SAMANTHA
*Put that away*.
Earl complies, grumbling. Some teenage burnouts howl from a
street corner:
BURNOUT
Ow! Mrs. Claus is HOT!
Samantha squirms in her seat, scowling.
SAMANTHA
I can't take it, Earl, this dumb
costume is giving me a wedgie. Driving
me crazy, but there's these *kids*
here --
EARL
Right, you don't wanna be rootin' --
SAMANTHA
In front of little Billy, age four,
yeah. "Look, Mommy, Mrs. Claus chooses
to go butt-mining."
EARL
This is little Billy talking?
SAMANTHA
Age four, kid's unbelievable.
(sighs)
I'm too old for this, Earl.
EARL
Yeah, yeah. Spare me, I got a prostate
the size of a melon.
Samantha stares at him.
EARL
Seriously, half my life's a doctor's
hand up my ass, I should marry the
fucker.
SAMANTHA
Say that a little louder, there's a
kid in back didn't catch it.
EARL
It's not that fucking little Billy
again, is it?
SERIES OF SHOTS:
Throughout the following NARRATION, we watch Sam: 1) Rallying
the varsity CHEERLEADERS; 2) Showing off a GERBIL to her
seventh graders; 3) Kneeling in church with her HUSBAND,
blessing herself; 4) Absently fingering a silver KEY which
she wears round her neck; and finally 5) Probing at a tiny
ridged SCAR under her hairline.
SAMANTHA (V.O.)
Eight years. I keep hiring detectives,
but they never find anything.
(beat)
I was born 3000 days ago on the beach
in New Jersey. I entered the world
fully grown, wearing clothes I don't
remember buying. Nothing in the
pockets but a single key, filed
smooth.
(beat)
I'm married now. Nice guy, early
forties. I stand naked in the mirror
and try to guess my age. Thirty-five,
maybe. I have lots of scars.
Samantha walks with her husband HAL. Late thirties. Balding.
Coming out of St. Paul's Episcopal Church.
SAMANTHA
Hal, I gotta tell you, of all the
Christmas pageants I've seen, this
was by far the most recent.
HAL
Aw, honey, I had teenage girls playing
the wise men, what'd you expect?
SAMANTHA
Teenage boys?
HAL
Well, I thought they did fine.
SAMANTHA
Just fine? Come on, it was ground
breaking stuff. The first Nativity
where Joseph stares at the wise men's
tits all night.
She hugs him good-naturedly. As they near their house, an
eight year-old GIRL drops from a TREEHOUSE and comes running,
leaps into Mommy's arms --
SAMANTHA
Hey, you!
The kid leaps into her arms, as we HEAR:
SAMANTHA (V.O.)
Her name is Caitlin. She's my daughter
and when I woke up on that long-ago
day, she was two months grown in my
belly. I don't know who put her there.
I may never. I just know she's mine,
and she's about to turn eight.
The family troops up the driveway to their SUBURBAN HOME.
Chipper little A-frame. Christmas lights abound. Behind the
house, a vast frozen POND. It is idyllic.
SAMANTHA and HAL bid goodnight to their friends and neighbors.
Hal steers her away from a middle-aged teacher.
HAL
Christ, guy's all over you like a
cheap suit.
SAMANTHA
That's funny, there's a cheap suit
all over him like a cheap suit.
She notices EARL sitting in the bushes by the side of the
building. He is speaking intently to the gerbil.
HAL
Oh, boy. Someone's gotta take my
father home. I'm plowed.
Samantha takes the keys from him. Breathes deeply of the
chill night air. Smiling. Surveys the scene... their friends.
The neighborhood. Sighs:
SAMANTHA
This is all I ever wanted.
At which point, young Caitlin says:
CAITLIN
How would you know?
ESTABLISHING SHOT - STATE PRISON - OHIO - NIGHTTIME
Switch gears: A grim, grey building. Guarded. Patrolled.
If you had to pick a night to die horribly, you'd be hard
pressed to find a nicer one. A country highway. Bathed in
moonlight. Crusted with snow. Pontiac Sunbird, wending its
way through the wooded slopes.
Elsewhere. Tract housing, late-model cars. MITCH HENESSEY
delivers a Christmas gift to his nine year-old son TODD: not
just any gift, the *Midtown Saturn Orbiting Precinct*, with
action figures. Henessey points to the box, engrossed:
HENESSEY
...and here's the jail here, see...?
Escape chute for the Borian, he's a
dinosaur guy, Moves quick, don't
take no shit neither. See, you can
make him shoot the guard -- ah, hell,
look, I played with it a little
myself, I'm sorry.
VOICE interrupts them:
VOICE (O.S.)
TODD, TIME FOR DINNER. NOW.
An awkward pause. Henessey scowls.
HENESSEY
Hey, you go ahead, um... hope you
like the present.
TODD
It's awesome, Dad. Mom, though, she...
(sighs)
She gets weird. On my birthday, when
you gave me the Schwinn... she called
bicycle stores to see if there'd
been any robberies.
Henessey manages to control his face. Says tightly:
HENESSEY
Tell her I don't steal them locally.
He watches, forlorn, as his son vanishes inside the house.
Christmas lights, blinking feebly. We HEAR, supered:
HENESSEY (V.O.)
Dear Ma: Filled out the child support
stuff last week. Office got pissed,
under ex-spouse I put "Spawn of Satan,
Dweller in Eternal Dark." Just being
honest, Ma, lady wants me to die.
As he reaches his car, his BEEPER goes off.
Henessey on the phone. Dials. Waits. We HEAR:
HENESSEY (V.O.)
I'd go without a ripple, that's the
truth. Ex-con. Ex-husband. Expired.
Thanks, Ma, for hiding the truth
from me for so long. Or maybe you
believed in me. I miss you. I hope
you believed, even for a day. No one
did, Ma. No one at all. It's cold
here. I'm sorry you're dead. Your
son, Mitch.
The phone picks up. He says:
HENESSEY
Me. What's up?
TRIN (O.S.)
Mitch, we got a bite on amnesia
chick's photo. Found a guy remembers
seeing her, fall of '87. He wants
cash, should I grease him?
HENESSEY
Hell, no! Use your head, girl. Let
the fucker squeeze the Charmin.
TRIN
You kidding? Guy's hideous. I'll do
it, but we're talking time and a
half. Plus a night on the town when
I get back, and *no cockfights this
time*.
Samantha and daughter CAITLIN sing a hearty chorus of "Frere
Jaques." Sam giggles , Caitlin looks nervous; astride her
new two-wheeler BICYCLE while Sam finishes removing the
training wheels. Caitlin points to her stuffed TEDDY BEAR.
CAITLIN
Put Perkins in the basket. He's luck.
SAMANTHA
Mr. Perkins, going in the basket.
CAITLIN
Are the training wheels off?
SAMANTHA
Just pretend they're still there.
Piece of cake. You can do it.
CAITLIN
Wait...! I'm scared.
SAMANTHA
Shhh. Nothing to be scared of. Pretend
you're one of the X-men, you're tough.
Let's go, now. Three, two, one...
CAITLIN
Mom, I can't do it, swear --
Samantha sets her sailing. Laughs excitedly. The bike weaves,
side to side... hits the curb and topples with a CRASH. Spills
Caitlin to the pavement. Now's she's CRYING.
CAITLIN
Ouch--! I can't do it, it HURTS-!
Samantha walks over briskly. Face set in determined lines.
SAMANTHA
Nonsense. You can do it. You don't
want to, but you can.
CAITLIN
My arm hurts, please take me home...!
SAMANTHA
You can go home, Caitlin. You can
ride there.
An unpleasant note is edging into her voice. The louder the
kid cries, the more Samantha starts to SIMMER.
CAITLIN
Mom, no...!
SAMANTHA
Look, I know you're afraid, that's
the whole *point*, can you see that?
Now stop being a little baby and get
on the damn bike.
She hoists her onto the seat. Caitlin cries and hollers.
SAMANTHA
You gonna be afraid of things all
your life? Huh? That what you want?
CAITLIN
My wrist hurts...!
*Snap*. Something lets go. Suddenly Samantha's right in her
face:
SAMANTHA
Life is pain. Get used to it. See,
you *will* ride this bike home,
princess. You will ride it and you
will not fall again, *is that
understood*...?
Eyes cold and lifeless. She is not herself. CUT TO:
THE CAROLERS continue their interesting rendition. Snowflakes
fall. All is quiet. All is bright. Especially bright is the
SHOTGUN BARREL pressed to the throat of the lead soprano. HE-
109. Over and under combo. Shotgun on top. HE cannon on
bottom. You'd sing shitty too.
Two stories up. The kid is ejected, flailing. Floats in SLOW
MOTION. Across a ten foot gap -- INTO THE TREEHOUSE. Sails
head over heels into the place. Hits with a CRASH. Alive and
unhurt.
BACK INSIDE THE HOUSE
Samantha didn't even look. Didn't need to. Here comes JACK.
Up the staircase. Reloading. Samantha launches herself down
the stairs. COLLIDES, head on -- Down they go. Jack, rolls
to his feet. Propels her into the KITCHEN.
As it fades behind Henessey's Chrysler. Leaving behind porch-
bound elders, dimestore clerks. Grinning children, hair like
spun straw. All fading... DISSOLVE TO:
As they clamber from the car, Henessey shoves his sunglasses
into his sportcoat. SINGS:
HENESSEY
Putting my glasses in my cooooat..."
Samantha looks at him like he's sprouted wings.
HENESSEY
I sing what I do so I'll remember
it. "Turning off the downstairs
liiiight..." You know?
Samantha smiles thinly. The man's a lunatic.
Samantha JERKS, comes awake in the passenger seat of
Henessey's Plymouth. Bad dream. Looks over to see if he
noticed -- he's honking his horn at a TRAFFIC JAM. Sea of
taillights, dead ahead.
SAMANTHA
What's this? What the hell is this...?
We don't have time for this, of all
the cocksucking bullshit --
HENESSEY
Whoa. Ms. Class, drive a little truck
on the side, do you?
SAMANTHA
What are you, a Mormon?
HENESSEY
No, ma'am, it's just that... well,
when we met you're all, "Oh, fooey,
I burned the darn cupcakes." Now,
you go into a bar, ten minutes later
sailors come running out, they can't
take it.
Just then, THREE POLICE CRUISERS blow by, sirens screaming.
Henessey frowns, puzzled.
HENESSEY
What the hell...? Lemme check the
scanner.
He switches on a police band radio. Listens, hears:
VOICE (O.S.)
...without endangering the hostages,
over... ...Roger that two-niner. PCP
confirmed, he's on a fuse, please
provide backup, over... ...Conneaut,
I'm waiting on Special Weapons, sorry,
over...
POLICE FLASHERS, spinning. Cop cars, incoming. SLAMMING to a
halt. Disgorging uniformed cops. THE DINER is rapidly
surrounded. Its a cheery decor, the giant roofbound Santa,
all in stark contrast -- To the SCREAMING we hear, dimly,
from within.
The police are just starting to re-route traffic. A highway
cop signals to HENESSEY, "Turn around, go back."
SAMANTHA flops on the frozen ground in a stand of pine trees.
HENESSEY
Where the shit did you get that?
No answer. She deftly assembles the SNIPER RIFLE. Rests the
rifle barrel on a dead branch. Flicks on the starlight scope.
HENESSEY
Sam, Goddammit, you're gonna kill
someone! Hey!
She ignores him. Focuses through the scope. POV SAMANTHA:
Framed in spectral GREEN, the diner's interior. Hostages.
Crying mothers. Children, catatonic.
Through a tiny window -- a limited view of the KITCHEN. He's
in there. Girl, eating both barrels. Samantha's jaw tightens.
HENESSEY
The diner...? That's half a mile
away, are you fucking crazy?
SAMANTHA
HK M-40 assault rifle. At three
hundred yards, vertical drop six
inches.
Mr. Shotgun leans in. WHISPERS something to the waitress.
SAMANTHA
Shit. He's gonna do the girl.
HENESSEY
How the fuck can you tell?
She steadies the rifle. Takes aim.
SAMANTHA
I read lips.
She fires. Splintered CRACK-!
Samantha slams the trunk of the Chrysler. Gets in the
passenger side without a word. Henessey pulls away.
Yes, it certainly is. CUT TO:
They emerge into the chill air. Breath pluming from their
mouths. Samantha surveys the parking lot. Grabs Henessey,
points --
A LATE-MODEL CAR pulls into the gravel lot. Stops.
SAMANTHA
Bingo. That's an old guy's car.
HENESSEY
How do you know?
SAMANTHA
Because there's an old guy in it.
Come on.
They cross toward the car. She frowns, points to his coat.
SAMANTHA
Gun bulge.
HENESSEY
You think I'm gonna shove it down my
pants? Shoot my damn dick off.
SAMANTHA
So now you're a sharpshooter?
HENESSEY
Ho, ho.
As they approach the other car, the engine stops. The door
opens and a middle aged man emerges -- IT AIN'T NATHAN. He
pauses, lighting a cigarette.
SAMANTHA
Mr. Windeman...?
She strides right up, Henessey in tow. Flashes a dazzling
smile -- *Slow motion*. The guy DROPS HIS LIGHTER, darts a
hand inside his coat with practiced ease... Pulls out a
SILENCED PISTOL.
SAMANTHA
Oh, SHIT!
*Slow motion*. Samantha tackles Henessey. Hurls them both to
the ground... During their fall, STUFF HAPPENS:
She clutches his sportcoat -- Grips his .38 special THROUGH
THE FABRIC and squeezes... A sharp report, BAM-! Another,
BAM-! The jacket, shredded. HITMAN just caught two in the
chest. He goes over backwards, gun spitting --
Sam and Henessey hit the ground. *Back to regular speed*.
Henessey rolls over, stunned. Samantha's staring at her hand,
wondering how in the hell it just did that.
HENESSEY
*Jesus wept*...!
They scamper to their feet. Running hellbent for leather
toward the Plymouth... They never make it.
ANOTHER HITMAN steps calmly from the trees. Stands at the
shoulder of the highway, full view of the parking lot...
Adopts a two-fisted stance. Draws a bead, locks on target --
Leaves his feet.
Takes to the air as a BLACK LE SABRE swerves off the highway
with no advance warning and DEMOLISHES the bastard, wham--!
The car roars across the lot, NATHAN WINDEMAN at the wheel.
The black Le Sabre SLEWS to a stop, showering gravel -- NATHAN
shouts at Sam and Henessey:
NATHAN
Get in! Both of you, NOW!
They pile into the backseat. Nathan floors it. PEELS OUT,
bouncing
onto the highway -- and meanwhile here comes
TIMOTHY. On the run. Barks into his transmitter:
TIMOTHY
East, they're going east. *Head them
off*.
He begins to run: we have never seen anyone run this fast.
Timothy, on the move. RUNS, breakneck through the woods.
Jumps fallen logs. Ducking, swerving. In and out through the
trees, as
A forty foot embankment, damn near vertical. Plunging to the
road below. Topped by a chain-link FENCE.
Timothy hits the fence at a dead run. Up and over. Pitches
head over heels down the embankment, BOUNCING. Hits bottom
in a shower of dirt, rolls, comes up... .357 AMP in a two-
fisted grip, and *there's Nathan's car*. Blows by, doing 90.
Timothy swivels calmly, BLASTS AN ENTIRE CLIP at the
retreating car. Shot after shot, like a machine --
Nathan has pulled over in a grove of pine trees. The car is
covered with branches. He watches through a gap as two police
cars go by on the distant highway.
NATHAN
Your father was in the British SIS,
assigned to the Irish situation.
After he was murdered in 1971, his
friend Perkins recruited you for
Chapter, a black bag operation working
out of the U.S. State Department.
Charly is overloaded. Trying to keep up, not wanting to:
NATHAN
Fall, 1987: Presidential orders come
down. You're to flush out a terrorist
by the name of Daedalus. You never
complete the mission, electing instead
to die, of all things, despite clear
orders to the contrary. And dead you
remain until, without preamble, you
re-emerge, eight years later and
fifteen pounds heavier.
SAMANTHA
Would you lay off the weight?
NATHAN
I think we can safely assume Daedalus
is aware of your resurrection and is
attempting to reverse it. *Damn*, I
can't drive around in this thing.
(beat)
Any idea where we can go to stash
this car?
IN SAMANTHA'S LAP
Her fingers unconsciously fiddle with something. Damp,
crumpled. The ENVELOPE. One address left.
SAMANTHA
This address...? I... I recognize it
now. I think it belongs to a friend.
Henessey stares at her. As Nathan reaches for the envelope,
his coat falls open and Samantha GASPS; his left side is
soaked with blood.
NATHAN
Perhaps you'd best drive.
The house is actually an old converted MILL. Beyond it, frozen
landscape stretches to the lakeshore. In the BARNYARD, a
scruffy looking COWBOY TYPE is splitting logs on a tree stump.
Drops the axe. Scoops up an armload of firewood. Comes around
the corner --
Drops the logs, startled. AN UNLIKELY TRIO approaches. NATHAN,
sweating. Pasty. Levels a revolver. Samantha says:
SAMANTHA
Don't be afraid, we don't want to
hurt you.
(beat)
I just want to know who you are.
Seeing her, his eyes go wide -- He locks her in a whooping
BEAR HUG, shouts:
MAN
CHARLY, BABY!!
Picks her up, SPINS HER around, laughing... Henessey and
Nathan stare. Befuddled.
TIME CUT - MINUTES LATER
The strange man (let's call him LUKE) stands awkwardly in
the dooryard. Shifting from foot to foot. NATHAN watches him
dispassionately from the tree stump. Gun on his knee.
LUKE
(sighs)
Look, is this America's Funniest
Practical Videos or something?
The DOOR bangs open and Samantha comes out of the house.
Carrying bandages. Alcohol. Crosses to the tree stump, kneels
before Nathan. His voice is a harsh rasp:
NATHAN
Let me do it.
He bats her away, administers his own first aid. LUKE pipes
up, exasperated:
LUKE
I can't believe you don't remember
dating me. Charly, please, you pursued
me for months.
SAMANTHA
Yeah, well. I caught you and forgot
you. Sorry.
LUKE
It's December, you'll remember.
Right...?
He chuckles. Looks at her face. Stops chuckling, takes a
sudden interest in the ground. Sam crosses to HENESSEY,
standing nearby. Takes him aside, whispers:
SAMANTHA
(sotto)
This is ridiculous. What do we do
with this guy?
HENESSEY
Don't ask me, I just work here. Did
you bump pelvises with him or not?
SAMANTHA
It's possible.
HENESSEY
And you kid, Cathead --
SAMANTHA
Caitlin.
HENESSEY
Yeah, whatever. Um, could he be
the...?
SAMANTHA
I don't know.
(beat)
It's coming back, though. All these...
little details about him.
She studies Luke. Frowning. Concentrating.
SAMANTHA
I know he's got a pin in his leg,
car accident. I know he cuts his own
hair... thinks Rush Limbaugh's an
ass. I know he sits down when he
pees. I know --
HENESSEY
Enough. You're giving me a stiffy.
Just then NATHAN is hit with a dreadful-sounding cough. It
wracks him. Doubles him up. LUKE blurts out:
LUKE
Goddammit, he's *dying*. Let me call
the poor bastard an ambulance!
Nathan grits his teeth:
NATHAN
*No ambulance*. The car I ordered
will be here soon.
SAMANTHA
Mr. Windeman, please let him help
you. I know this man, I... I'm pretty
sure I slept with him.
Nathan presses a bandage to his side.
NATHAN
I'm about to faint... And if you
call an ambulance, I will fucking
kill you.
He pitches forward into Henessey's arms.
Beside the lakeshore LUKE AND SAMANTHA walk side by side.
RACK FOCUS to the porch: NATHAN is laid out on a chaise
lounge. Henessey beside him, applying cold compresses. The
older man stirs, coming awake... Tries to sit up, Henessey
nudges him flat again.
NATHAN
Where's Charly...?
HENESSEY
Relax. She's with Luke. That's his
name, Luke.
NATHAN
Goddammit, I told you --
HENESSEY
Yeah, yeah, we weren't real big on
what you told us. I had him call you
an ambulance, so shoot me. Should be
here within fifteen minutes.
Nathan groans. Henessey presses a cloth to the man's head.
HENESSEY
The guy's story checks out. Sam knows
things about him. Stuff only a lover
would know.
NATHAN
Sod that... just watch them.
HENESSEY
Don't worry about it. Chick signs my
checks, I'm gonna watch her get aced?
Lie back down.
Nathan swallows. Grimaces. Lies back down.
NATHAN
Checks. You're not fooling anyone,
dear boy.
(bemused)
You'd wash her feet and drink the
water... wouldn't you?
HENESSEY
Cut me a break, nimrod. She's married
with a kid.
Busted. Nathan coughs. Speaks, eyes faraway:
NATHAN
My star pupil...
(smiles thinly)
That man in Pennsylvania yesterday...
The one at the diner, that was hers,
wasn't it...?
HENESSEY
How'd you know?
NATHAN
(nods)
I saw the news report, they found a
shell casing a thousand yards away,
helluva shot.
HENESSEY
Tell me about Daedalus, what's his
story?
NATHAN
Arms broker, man without a face.
Veteran of Baader-Meinhoff and the
Red Brigades. He's rumored to be
based in the U.S. Doesn't travel
much, they say. Too afraid of metal
detectors, the poor sod's got a foot-
long piece of steel in his leg.
At which point, Henessey stops. Frowns.
HENESSEY
Come again?
NATHAN
A pin, Mr. Henessey. A surgical pin.
He scuffs his shoe in the porch dust. Eyes narrowed:
HENESSEY
Where the hell...? I know I just
heard that somewhere, something about
a...
His eyes widen:
HENESSEY
Oh, fuck.
Points to the lake:
HENESSEY
Nathan, that son of a bitch has one
in *his* leg.
Nathan freezes, thoughts racing... swears violently:
NATHAN
You blithering idiot, the son of a
bitch wasn't her lover, he was her
target, he's Daedalus!
HENESSEY
Oh, Jesus...! That's how she knew
all that shit, not from *dating* him --
she *studied* the fucker to take him
out!
He takes off for the lake at a dead run. Behind him, the
bloodied Nathan DRAGS himself to his feet and lurches off
the porch, stumbling. Weaving. Refusing to go down.
AT THE LAKESIDE -- Luke walks behind Samantha. Talking softly
in her ear, smiling... She hears something. A RATCHETING
noise, drawing closer, hmmm...? Looks up. Wishes she hadn't --
A BELL RANGER HELICOPTER is descending over the lake. Inside,
TIMOTHY shoulders a bolt action rifle, coolly professional.
FIRES, kicks up dirt at Henessey's feet. Stops the fucker
cold. On the shore, LUKE smiles at Samantha, says:
LUKE
Sure don't look like an ambulance,
does it?
SLUGS HER IN THE FACE. Drops her to the ice like a broken
doll.
CUT TO BLACK:
Black indeed. Deep. Empty. Out of the darkness, we hear a
NEWS COMMENTATOR. Voice scratchy. Indistinct. Far away or
long ago...
A TELEVISION IMAGE fills the screen. Black and white. Grainy.
The legend: BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND, over footage of a
sidewalk bombing. We're back in time, the year 1971. A crisp-
looking BRIGADIER is speaking to the off-camera reporter:
BRIGADIER
...the bombing has been linked to
the Ulster Volunteer Force, which,
as you know, is the counterpart of
the provisional IRA and the most
violent of the Protestant Paramilitary
groups.
An ANNOUNCER's face replaces him:
ANNOUNCER
Despite threats of reprisals,
Brigadier Baltimore repeats that he
will seek to cut UVF supply lines,
especially from Tripoli, Lybia. U.S.
President Nixon concurs that...
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
A battered TV, volume turned low. Snoozing in a chair, a
rumpled older man -- It's the BRIGADIER, the one we just saw
speaking on TV. A CALENDAR on the table identifies the date
as June 23, 1971.
IN THE NEXT ROOM
Girlish decor. Pinups of rock stars. A YOUNG GIRL is awake,
dressed and currently stuffing two pillows under a blanket.
She inspects her handiwork. Human-looking lump. Turns,
satisfied.
One last look at the WOODEN JESUS on the wall -- Creeps from
the room. Past the sleeping Brigadier. To the front door.
She checks over her shoulder, nervous. Taps out five digits.
Shuts off the alarm. Unlocks the door and slips out.
The boy's name is GREGORY. Sixteen, with a quick, easy grin.
Huddled beneath a tree with him, the girl is gelatin.
GREGORY
You've never made it with a boy,
then?
GIRL
There's nothing odd about it. I'm
only sixteen.
GREGORY
Rubbish.
GIRL
What?
GREGORY
You're fourteen and not a day more.
Here now, I'm right, you're blushing.
GIRL
Look, what if I'm ignorant? It's my
father, we never stay in one place,
I never meet bloody anyone.
GREGORY
Saw him on the telly. Think he'd
kill me? I'm a nasty one, I am.
He slides a hand under her sweater. She stiffens, terrified
and exhilarated, as he gently strokes her nipple with a thumb.
GREGORY
You know what, I'll bet you've never
even kissed a boy... now, have you?
(beat)
Aye, but you want to...
He leans in. She leans forward. A jerky, tentative duckling
on the road to swan-dom. Their lips touch.
Across the road, THE WINDOWS BLOW OUT in her father's flat.
She spins, scream caught in her throat -- as ARMED MEN rush
from the house. Through the door, the one she left unlocked.
Stutter of SMALL ARMS FIRE. She whirls on Gregory, realizes
only then that the guy is LAUGHING.
GREGORY
Thanks for shutting off the alarm,
you bloody Papist bitch.
He slaps her full across the face.
GREGORY
Tell the press the Ulster Force claims
full credit.
He spins and flees.
TIMOTHY bolts from the house, clutching a bleeding hand.
Running hellbent for leather. Reaches a parked car. Leaps in
and kicks over the engine as, behind him --
MORE MEN come piling out of the house, shouting. Running for
their cars -- never make it. CUT DOWN IN THEIR TRACKS. Wracked
by gunfire, bodies twitching...
And as Timothy PEELS OUT, spraying mud, we pull UP, UP, AND
AWAY... Into the sky, moving ever higher, gunfire fading...
Until now we're WAY UP, we can see Timothy's car... the OLD
MILL, ever so tiny below us...
It blows to pieces. Sends flaming boards flying STRAIGHT UP
AT US.
Henessey lights a smoke at the bar. Flicks the match in a
trashcan. Starts to go, stops... Reaches into the can. Plucks
out a tiny scrap: PHOTOGRAPH, ripped in two.
A photo of Hal and Caitlin.
He pockets it, disturbed. Crosses to the bathroom door. The
shower has stopped. Raises a tentative hand, starts to
knock... It OPENS. There, in a thin silk robe, is a WOMAN,
swabbing at her hair.
She breezes out of the bathroom all chipper, like nothing's
unusual. Notices Henessey cursorily. Raises a finger: "one
sec." Lowers her head and shakes it like a terrier, spraying
him.
He cannot stop staring. It's Samantha, it *has* to be...
Now she's BLONDE, though. Hair clipped short. Bobbed. Blood-
red fingernails. Red cotton shift, legs for days.
Then, she *smiles* at him -- and it's not her, not Samantha.
Amnesia's over, folks, because we're clearly looking at a
changed woman: This one's name is CHARLY BALTIMORE, and she
hasn't seen the light of day in eight years.
CHARLY
Hey, Mitch. Glad you're awake. Uh-
oh, you're seeping.
She grabs a washcloth. Frowns, says:
CHARLY
Here, look at this.
With that, she opens her robe and exposes her breasts.
Henessey perks up considerably -- then SCREAMS as she RIPS
the gauze from his chest. She clinchs the robe again.
HENESSEY
Ah, that hurt like shit!!
CHARLY
That's why I distracted you first.
(dabs at his wounds)
Same principle as breaking in virgins.
HENESSEY
Same as -- virgins, *what*...?
CHARLY
Saw it in a Harold Robbins book. Guy
bites her on the ear as he goes in.
Distracts from the pain. You ever
try that?
HENESSEY
No, I slug 'em in the jaw and yell
"pop goes the weasel," what the fuck
are you talking about? Who are you??
CHARLY
Name's Charly. The spy. Nice to
meet'cha. Drink?
Henessey hunches forward, speaks rapidly into the phone:
HENESSEY
...The lady's whacked, Trin, she's
lost it and I want fucking out, now
*call the Feds*. She's moving us
tonight, I'll sneak out to this phone,
call you back at midnight with the
details.
He hangs up quickly. Turns -- reveal CHARLY, lounging a foot
away, watching him.
HENESSEY
All right, Charly. What did that
accomplish?
CHARLY
I'm testing our boy Perkins. I figure
he's gotta be tapping your office.
Got a light...?
HENESSEY
(pause, then:)
Oh, no. He just traced that call?
She swipes matches from his pocket. Nods.
CHARLY
Come midnight, you hang by the phone.
Nobody shows, we think about trusting
him. He tries to kidnap and torture
you, well, there it is.
HENESSEY
Whoa, time out.
CHARLY
Oh, don't be such a baby.
(lights her cigarette)
Ten o'clock, we got two hours to
kill. I'm a woman, feed me.
CARNIVAL RIDES, dead for the winter. Henessey and Charly
stroll beneath them. He smokes. She eats Chinese.
CHARLY
Ugh. God I'm full, I'm gonna have a
food baby.
He takes a good long look at her, still can't fathom it.
HENESSEY
"Charly." fucking unbelievable.
(beat)
Shame about the fat ass. I bet you
were really attractive once.
CHARLY
Oh, I was. Check this out. One time?
A guy said he'd fuck me.
HENESSEY
No.
CHARLY
Swear to God.
HENESSEY
Did he make good?
CHARLY
Absolutely. Oh, and afterwards? Oh
my God, afterwards I said the most
funny thing, you know what I said...?
(beat)
I said, "Go back to your room. Dad..."
She laughs through a swig of beer. MEMORY FLASH: Charly's
bedroom as DAD puts the gun to his head and fires, CRACK...
CHARLY
It's why he thought I had him killed.
Henessey huddles, watching her closely.
HENESSEY
Your father was murdered.
She nods, gazes out over the icy waters. Speaks, her voice
faraway and gone:
CHARLY
When Da died, I went to his funeral.
12 years old, today I wouldn't. And
I overheard a woman, she was
praying... She was thanking God --
sounded so happy -- thanking Him it
hadn't been *her* father who was
killed. See... she didn't really
care that God had let someone die...
just so long as it missed *her*.
(beat)
...and she bought her cross at the
same store as mine, see, that's what
we do, we all pray to the same cross
on a hundred different walls, and
sit back and wait to see who gets
hit and who gets missed.
Anger flares in her eye. Like a stirring of mud at the bottom
of a deep, deep, pond.
CHARLY
Fuck the waiting. Fuck being afraid.
I determine who gets hit, and how
hard. And I thank no one. It's
pathetic to thank someone who spares
you -- when they're just taking
someone else.
(beat)
Walk me upstairs?
Charly stalks the city streets. A quartet sings, "God Rest
Ye Merry," ostensibly about joy, oddly the most depressing
tune ever written. On a crowded street, she is alone. Total
misfit. Searches her own haggard features in a shop window.
Swallows hard, whispers:
CHARLY
Easy, baby. She ain't coming back,
no way. Bitch is dead.
She bustles down a sidestreet, hands jammed in her pockets.
That's when a tall BEARDED MAN crosses the street and falls
in alongside.
BEARDED MAN
Good evening.
CHARLY
Fuck off.
BEARDED MAN
I see me a good-looking lady, all
upset, I wonder if she doesn't need
some male company.
CHARLY
Forget it. I'm saving myself 'til I
get raped.
His hand edges out of his windbreaker with a snubnosed .38.
BEARDED MAN
Step into the alley, honey. I ain't
asking, I'm telling.
Charly stops walking. Regards him the way you or I might
look at a telephone cord. Groans:
CHARLY
Oh, don't tell me. You're early,
Goddammit, you're supposed to be at
the pay phone. Go away and come back
at midnight. I'm not ready yet. Got
a light?
The guy stares, mouth working.
BEARDED MAN
Lady, I have a gun!
Which is precisely when a much larger Smith and Wesson COCKS
next to his ear:
VOICE (V.O.)
This ain't no ham on rye, pal.
HENESSEY holds the gun rock steady in his big fist. Charly
spins on him, eyes flashing:
CHARLY
What the hell are you doing here?
HENESSEY
Saving your life. Woulda got here
sooner but I was thinking up the
sandwich line.
CHARLY
You think I couldn't take him?
*Idiot*, you probably scared the
other guy away --
HENESSEY
What other guy -- ?
CHARLY
Headhunters, nimrod, they go in pairs,
were you always this stupid or did
you take lessons?
HENESSEY
I TOOK LESSONS.
The hitman watches, bewildered. Considers waving to get their
attention. Finally he can't stand it. Blurts out:
BEARDED MAN
Hey!
Charly snaps her head toward him:
CHARLY
*What*?
BEARDED MAN
I still got this fucking gun!
She smiles sweetly.
CHARLY
No, you don't.
Takes it off him. Just like that. He stares dumbly at his
empty hand. Half of his trigger finger is missing.
BEARDED MAN
SHIIIIT!!
Charly flips the gun into the air. Launches a SPIN KICK.
Shatters his jaw. Catapults him backwards.
Completes her spin, catlike -- Catches the .38 on its way
down. DOESN'T STOP THERE. Arm out, gun cocked -- FIRES.
Straight at Henessey, what...? He dives aside --
BEHIND HIM, a second HITMAN. Blown to tatters. The KNIFE
meant for Henessey arcs through the air...
Imbeds itself in the ground an inch from the prone detective.
He stares at it with shocked eyes. The killer hits, dead.
Twitches. CHARLY. Lowers her arm slowly. Gun barrel smoking.
CHARLY
Fuck you. Just fuck all of you.
A BRONCO ROARS UP out of a parking garage. Swerves and plunges
into the maze of streets that inspired the world's most
popular board game.
He bounces off the highway. Rolls. Over and over, shudders
to a stop. Pause... The wind blows. He groans. Looks up,
spits gravel. Stands. Dusts himself off. Watches the Bronco
go far away.
As Henessey trudges wearily down the highway we HEAR:
HENESSEY (V.O.)
Dear Mom: I was tortured, now I'm in
Atlantic City. The girl of my dreams
just threw me out of a speeding car.
Now more people will come an shoot
me in the head. On the plus side, I
won two bucks at video poker.
A SCREECH of tires, he turns, startled -- here comes the
Bronco. Skids onto the highway and races back toward him.
Pulls up alongside. CHARLY throws open the door, says:
CHARLY
Get in.
He does. Without a word. Closes the door, they drive off. He
lights a cigarette like nothing happened. Shakes out the
match, speaks without looking at her:
HENESSEY
Found a use for me.
CHARLY
Yep.
(beat)
I gotta vanish, Mitch. I need money,
a whole bunch.
HENESSEY
Why didn't you say so? Gimme a second
while I pull it out of my ass.
She turns to him, a gleam in her eye. Speaks softly:
CHARLY
The key, Mitch. The one I keep around
my neck.
HENESSEY
What about it?
CHARLY
What if I told you it's the key to
Box 406 at Pittsburgh International
Airport?
HENESSEY
How would you know? Someone filed
off the numbers.
CHARLY
Not someone. Me. I filed them off.
(beat)
There's a briefcase in Box 406, Mitch.
HENESSEY
What's in it?
CHARLY
$200,000.
Henessey does a spit-take, sprays whiskey.
CHARLY
Payment for my last assignment. I
need you to retrieve it for me.
HENESSEY
Why me?
CHARLY
Don't be stupid, they might have the
place covered. I don't want to get
shot to pieces.
HENESSEY
Shoulda known.
(sighs)
Gimme the key.
CHARLY
I'd love to. I left it with Caitlin
back in Ohio.
The BRONCO races on into the night...
The Bronco glides along. Charly in the passenger seat, eyes
roving like a hawk's. THE CAINE HOUSE is peaceful and quiet.
Christmas lights, still burning dimly.
CHARLY
Drive past, don't slow down.
(points)
Park under those trees, honk if
there's trouble.
HENESSEY
(bad Rochester)
Yas, massah, I be slowin' de caw
down fo' you.
She stuffs a .45 automatic in her waistband. Cradles an MP-5
beneath her coat. Rolls out of the still-moving truck. Makes
her way through back yards. Silent as a cat. She went to
cookouts here. Bridge parties. Now she prowls, a grim
assassin.
Leaps a fence, drops behind a woodpile -- Comes face to face
with RAYMOND, a fifth grade student we saw earlier. Secreted
behind the woodpile, SMOKING. His eyes pop as he spies good
ol' Ms. Caine, sporting blonde hair and an assault weapon.
Charly doesn't miss a beat:
CHARLY
Good morning, Raymond.
RAYMOND
Um... morning, Ms. Caine.
CHARLY
What did we learn about the dangers
of smoking...? Give it here.
A wet stain appears at his crotch. He hands her the cigarette
with nerveless fingers. Charly accepts it. Takes a long,
satisfying drag. Passes it back.
CHARLY
Thanks. Tell anyone you saw me I'll
blow your fucking head off.
Moves off through the bushes. Out of sight.
Charly kicks aside a pair of abandoned ice skates. Crouches,
face pressed to the glass door. Looking in. The house is
silent and empty. Nobody home. The Christmas tree winks off
and on. The tree she helped decorate. She opens the door and
slips inside. CUT TO:
Charly enters. All business. Begins to systematically rifle
the drawers. Her daughter's precious things. Sweeps everything
onto the floor. Utter disregard, it's a bit startling.
Crosses to the bed, throws back the covers -- MR. PERKINS
(the stuffed bear) has the chain around his neck.
We hear it, then. Ghosting on the still air, barely audible,
the sound of SINGING... Children's voices waft across the
frozen pond from St. Paul's Episcopal CHURCH. Charly frowns.
Crosses to the window, lifts the sash.
Pause. Charly chews her lip. Unlimbers the MP-5. Hefts the
wicked-looking thing. Not to fire it... but to use the SCOPE.
Adjusts focus. Practiced movements. Deft. Sure. Sights down
the weapon. Scans though the gunsights...
POV CHARLY: Hal's CHRISTMAS PAGEANT. There's Hal. Cast in
spectral GREEN. Laughing and serving breakfast. On the church
lawn, a NATIVITY scene. Teenage girls as the wise men. Choir
of children, singing... CAITLIN among them.
Charly is sweating. She lowers the scope. Squeezes her eyes
shut. Something in her, threatening to WRENCH LOOSE...
Henessey, slouched behind the wheel. Starts to light a
cigarette. Stops, the match halfway to his face. Eyes riveted
on the rearview mirror as a GOVERNMENT SEDAN turns the corner
behind him...
BACK WITH CHARLY - INSIDE
Watching her family, far away. Fighting emotion. That's when
she hears A HORN HONKING. Her head whips around, toward the
front of the house. The honk is followed by three GUNSHOTS
in rapid succession.
She's up and moving. All else forgotten.
Henessey PEELS OUT, tires smoking. Careens forward, government
SEDAN close behind --
The upstairs window EXPLODES outward. Charly, hurtles through.
Freefalls to the porch roof. Glass, showering down. Hits,
rolls. Surfaces in a combat crouch, FIRES.
Government sedan, KILLS THE PASSENGER. Collapses him over
the doorframe. Gun clatters to the street, car speeds off --
CHARLY BALTIMORE hurtles forward, SPEED SKATING across the
frozen pond toward the chase vehicles. Long, coltish legs,
to die for.
CHARLY
This is gross, this is gonna be so
Goddamn gross...
She goes SIDESLIPPING at superhuman speed. Tacks alongside
the government sedan. Targets the bald guy's head. Raises
the .45 and FIRES. Not to be graphic, but the car's driver
receives the bulk of the mess. SPRAYED.
Across the eyes. He loses control, SKIDS OUT. Catapults off
the road, onto the ice. Slides right toward Charly, *still
doing fifty*...
She doesn't miss a beat. LAUNCHES herself, twisting in
midair... Up OVER THE HOOD of the sedan, it blows by
underneath her as
ANOTHER ANGLE
The incredible part. In slow motion, she does a DOUBLE AXEL
PIRHOUETTE. Above the hood. Mid-spin, she blows THREE SHOTS
through the windshield. Kills everyone. Keeps going. The car
spins twice around. PLOWS to a halt -- Charly hits a picture
perfect landing.
On the shore, HENESSEY watches, thunderstruck. Charly skates
by the icebound sedan. Flashes a grin at the dying driver:
DRIVER
Shit... it really... *is* you...
CHARLY
Phil...? Phil Krauss? I don't believe
it, they moved you from cyphers.
Long time, man, I figured you were
dead by now.
She delivers a blow to the neck. Kills him. CUT TO:
Henessey and Charly, driving a new vehicle: late model
Cadillac. Charly driver. Henessey rifles the glove
compartment.
CHARLY
So, Mitch. Still think I'm warm and
fuzzy?
HENESSEY
Sure. It's not your fault the gun
accidentally went off in mid-air as
you tripped and flew over the car.
CHARLY
Exactly. What's in the glove box?
HENESSEY
Phone bill, Christmas card... Five
buck, swell. You didn't have to kill
him, you know.
CHARLY
Back off, man. Do I tell you how to
snap photos of extramarital blowjobs?
No.
There is a short, CHIRPING sound. Seemingly from nowhere.
They exchange puzzled looks, what the hell...? Charly abruptly
realizes it's coming from her purse. She reaches in, scoops
up the CELLULAR PHONE, the one she told Caitlin to call.
Thumbs the button. Says cautiously:
CHARLY
Hello?
A voice, then... Clipped tones, TIMOTHY'S voice:
TIMOTHY (O.S.)
It's me, I got your kid. Give your
location, we gotta lose the cellular.
Charly. Hand gripped tight on the phone. Pause, then:
CHARLY
State Road 80, 15 minutes west of
Harrison.
TIMOTHY
Okay, here's how we do it. Drive to
Harrison, find their main bus stop.
Pay phone, fifteen minutes. Better
drive fast, after five rings I hang
up.
Click.
HENESSEY
What the hell was that?
CHARLY
He's got the kid. Doesn't want to
talk on the airwaves, he's routing
me to a land line. A pay phone.
HENESSEY
Which phone? Where?
The detective's mind, racing... suddenly it hits him:
HENESSEY
Shit. Service centers...! They list
'em on the back of phone bills, right?
CHARLY
Excuse me?
HENESSEY
Shut up and find me a gun. HK, MP-5.
As he rips open the bill we CUT TO:
A neutral background, as Charly's HEAD enters frame, we're
very tight on her FACE... Tense, thin-lipped. A PHONE RINGS,
deafening. Click -- Charly speaks tersely:
CHARLY
Verify you have her.
TIMOTHY (O.S.)
I got your cellular number off a
cast on her right wrist. Right below
Mommy loves you... Picture of a panda.
Dog, panda, it's got funky ears.
CLOSE ON CHARLY: Dead still. Made of glass.
TIMOTHY (O.S.)
I want money, Charly. I know you've
got numbered accounts, we all do.
I'll let you know where and when.
Fuck with me...? I'll blind the kid
and shoot out her knees.
CHARLY
You're dead, motherfucker. We don't
involve families. It's not the way
it's done, *we don't take families*.
TIMOTHY
I'll be in touch.
He hangs up. Dead silence. HOLD on Charly's face... until
slowly, ever so slowly, the camera pulls back to REVEAL:
The .45 automatic -- Pointed at the head of an AT&T; operator.
THE PHONE COMPANY, they've taken it over. Employees CRINGE
on the floor. Henessey, MP-5 slung on his shoulder, leveled.
Charly points to the switchboard:
CHARLY
Give me an ANI trace. Do it.
Set back from the mountain road, a lonely MOTEL. A neon sign:
*Deer Lick Motel*, No vacancies. The sign sits atop a rusty
pole. Blinks forlornly.
Full dark now, the fun begins... A TANKER TRUCK rumbles up
the mountain road. Pulls up before the Deer Lick Motel. MEN
IN SUITS wield flashlights, motioning the truck forward into
a cavernous GARAGE. Inside, men in BLUE JUMPSUITS operate
cranes, maneuver a FILL TANK into place above the truck.
In the distance, as the tanker enters the garage -- CHARLY
BALTIMORE drops into frame. Lands and rolls, cat-quick. Comes
up behind a scrawny pine. Scans through a pair of Zeiss
Nightvision binoculars.
Welcome to the extraction. No more fun and games, tonight
it's a survival-zero operation. HENESSEY appears at her elbow.
Lugging the ordnance bag. He sees Charly lower the binoculars,
head in hands.
HENESSEY
What's the matter?
CHARLY
They're here.
HENESSEY
Who?
CHARLY
Fucking Chapter, that's who. Timothy
acting alone, Caitlin had a chance.
Now...? She's dead meat.
Charly and Henessey. Kneeling. He speaks tersely:
HENESSEY
Let me go in.
CHARLY
Negative. You stomp around like a
forties drunk and you're a lousy
shot.
HENESSEY
I get by.
CHARLY
You couldn't hit a lake if you were
standing on the bottom, now shut the
fuck up.
Charly studies the encampment. Armed men. Impossible odds.
Draws a long ragged breath and flops on the ground. Props
her back against a tree. Staring. Lights a cigarette:
CHARLY
I saw a little girl.
HENESSEY
(frowns)
Come again?
CHARLY
That's what happened under the water.
That night, eight years ago.
She looks up at the sky. Face troubled.
CHARLY
At the end... there she was, this
pretty little girl at the bottom of
the ocean, smiling at me. Three years
old, didn't know Daddies hid in
closets, not yet. Stared up at me in
the strangest way... saying how'd it
come to this, we were so pretty and
perfect, now look at us, sinking
with our head all open... Said when
she grew up she was gonna teach
school. She couldn't wait.
She heaves a sigh. Threads a silencer on a baretta.
CHARLY
Guards are on 27-1 megahertz, meet
me at 26-9, you need to talk. As
soon as you spot me with the kid,
start blowing the charges.
Henessey nods. Pause -- she does something unexpected. Leans
over and kisses him hard on the lips. He reacts, startled.
She pulls back, the oddest look on her face.
CHARLY
They're gonna blow my head off, you
know.
(softly:)
This is the last time I'll ever be
pretty.
She kisses him again. Softly. Tenderly. Pulls back, turns
without a word.
CHARLY
Time now. What I do next, they tell
me it... looks like a machine or
something. You don't like it, don't
look.
She moves off toward the trees. Henessey shifts from foot to
foot, awkwardly. Opens his mouth --
CHARLY
Don't say it.
HENESSEY
I was gonna say enjoy life, eat out
more often.
CHARLY
Gotta go.
(beat)
If she's alive, she's coming out of
there, Mitch. If she's not... they'll
know we stopped by.
She's gone, like a wraith. CUT TO:
SERIES OF SHOTS: Charly, on the prowl. In and out of the
trees... BURYING C-4 CHARGES. In bushes. In snowdrifts. She
crawls to woods' edge, peers out -- The motel stands solemn
and bedraggled. Draws a sharp breath -- !
There's a LIT CANDLE in the window of 17. CUT TO:
A gray-suited SENTRY. Poised on a wooded slope. He puts a
walkie-talkie to his lips and says:
SENTRY
All clear.
CHARLY, out of nowhere. Lightning fast. Hand, clamped on
mouth. In goes the knife. Deep. He burbles blood. Drops.
Before he hits, Charly's already switched from knife to gun
and moved on.
Charly appears from the shadows. Ghosts up to the window of
#17 and peers in. Scans. Misses nothing. Crosses to the door,
taps lightly. Watches the PEEPHOLE, a tiny pinprick of light.
Abruptly darkened by a human eye --
She presses the silenced Beretta to the hole and fires. Sputs
of splinters. From behind the door, a muffled thud. She goes
to work on the lock.
BACK WITH HENESSEY - MINUTES HAVE PASSED
Henessey lies prone, binoculars trained on the motel.
HENESSEY
Christ, lady, what are you doing in
there, playing fucking mah-jongg?
*Move*.
Behind him, a tiny, sharp click--! TIMOTHY has a Skorpion
machine pistol aimed at his head.
The killer speaks into a radio unit, a single word --
TIMOTHY
Bogey.
POP-! go the Kleig lights. BRILLIANCE, blinding -- CATCHES
CHARLY coming out of 17. Pins her dead to rights. Unconscious
DAUGHTER cradled in her arms. Tiny DOLL cradled in the kid's.
Charly runs, as the ground around her erupts like a
SHELLBURST.
TIMOTHY, MEANWHILE, shouting into his walkie-talkie, saying:
TIMOTHY
Take her alive, Perkins wants her!
Henessey watches, helpless and PANICKED, as Charly tumbles
BACKWARD. Crashes through a CELLAR ACCESS, it splinters
beneath her...! Plunges into blackness.
On the move. Our two heroes, shepherded across the compound.
Timothy's casualness is belied by the presence of two
dyspeptic GUARDS, each keeping a safe distance.
A POCK-FACED AGENT approaches briskly, RIFLE across his
shoulder. Holds out his hand:
POCK
Found these buried around the
perimeter.
Timothy studies it: C-4 CHARGE with remote detonation unit.
TIMOTHY
Make sure you get all of them.
The agent rushes off. Timothy looks at Charly reproachfully:
TIMOTHY
Chuck, you give me the fuck of my
life then try to stick me, come back
from the dead, whack my boss... No
sense lyin', I'm miffed.
Moves like lightning. WHACK-! Kidney shot. Charly stumbles,
vision going black. Fights for balance. Henessey starts to
react but a GUN MUZZLE stops him. Charly straightens. Grits
her teeth, says:
CHARLY
So what's the plan? What's going out
in the tanker?
Timothy and the guards exchange looks. Cracking up, they
can't believe it -- Charly's not laughing. Looks at Timothy
with hooded, lifeless eyes:
CHARLY
What's the plan? I'm gonna die, I
wanna know.
Timothy lights a cigarette. Studies Charly.
TIMOTHY
You wanna know the plan?
He casually points to the neighboring valley, where Christmas
lights twinkle.
TIMOTHY
Santa Claus -- small town U.S.A.
personified. We drive the chemical
tanker in tonight, park it. Add a
catalyst, chain reaction, it goes
hot. We evacuate. The mix heats
overnight, goes critical at 312
degrees Celsius. 8:00 Christmas
morning... Main Street looks like a
meteor strike.
HENESSEY
Are you fucking insane? You're talking
about 10,000 people!!
CHARLY
Easy, Mitch.
(to Timothy)
How you gonna blame it on terrorists?
TIMOTHY
Those roads are treacherous this
time of year. When we dump a car to
the bottom of a ravine, with the
corpse of Imn Al Rahman in it... get
the picture?
Pause. Charly summons herself. Her voice a dull rasp:
CHARLY
Listen to me, Timothy. Please. Let
my kid go.
TIMOTHY
Why? For old times' sake...?
She shakes her head:
CHARLY
Goddamn you, *look at her eyes*...
TIMOTHY
And why exactly should I do that...?
CHARLY
(spits blood)
Because they're yours, motherfucker.
She stares Timothy full in the face.
CHARLY
That night in Paris, I got pregnant.
The little girl's your daughter.
Dead silence. A pause... Then Timothy brays LAUGHTER.
TIMOTHY
Priceless. Can't believe it...
Hooting out loud. Tears, streaming... He manages to bring
himself under control. Stops, gestures to the CELLAR ACCESS,
the dark awaits...
TIMOTHY
Kid's down there. What it is, Charly,
they're gonna find you both frozen
to death in the woods. Suicide pact.
Charly fights to contain herself.
CHARLY
She's no risk, Timothy, *let her
go*.
TIMOTHY
The freezer's downstairs, Charly.
Let's get it done.
Charly and Henessey are separated at gunpoint. A look passes
between them. Henessey swallows hard.
HENESSEY
I'll wait for you to rescue me.
CHARLY
Be just a minute.
Charly goes through the opening.
He's blown backward OUT THE WINDOW. Chair and all, lofting
across the middle distance... blasts through the MOTEL SIGN.
Blows it to SPLINTERS. Tumbles, and over end... lands, WHAM.
Atop the garage's CORRUGATED ROOF. Chair flies to sticks.
A BLUE SUIT spins, startled. Gun comes up -- Henessey doesn't
miss a beat. Reaches between his legs. Plucks the KNIFE from
the wood and slings it...! Guy takes it in the head, drops.
Some days you get lucky.
He looks up in disbelief. FIREBALL, raging to Heaven.
HENESSEY
You foxy bitch.
TIMOTHY staggers from the smoke. Nicked and bloodied -- ALIVE.
Rushes into the cavernous GARAGE, where blue-suits scuttle
like ants. Points to the tanker, face crazed:
TIMOTHY
Move it out of here, now!
Caitlin in tow, SMOKE everywhere. Running flat out across
the compound. Eyes ticking back and forth, missing nothing...
Sees a gun on the ground, scoops it up: promptly DROPS IT,
the fucking thing's red hot.
That's when the POCK-FACED KILLER lurches out of the smoke,
blade arcing for her throat.
CHARLY
*Run, Catey*.
She goes under the blade. SLAMS him. Down they go, hit the
dirt -- CAITLIN beats feet, vanishes into the smoke.
Charly, fighting for her life. Manages to KICK FREE. He rears
up. Poised to hurl the KNIFE. Charly, dives, rolls -- scoops
up the gun and SCREAMS as her flesh sizzles and it spurts
three times and blows him down.
Doesn't stop. Rips the AUTOMATIC RIFLE from his shoulder.
Rummages in his coat -- Cube of C-4. Even better. Casts about,
searching the smoke... No sign of her daughter.
CAITLIN darts in and out of the trees. Frightened. In the
background, men rush back and forth. The MOTEL burns merrily.
Then, above the shouts, A RUMBLING noise, she darts a look --
as THE TANKER comes trundling out of the garage.
POV CAITLIN: Attached to the rear of the truck bed, a bright
yellow UTILITY BOX, roughly three by three. As the driver
idles, waiting for the road to clear -- Caitlin BREAKS COVER.
Runs and climbs inside the box, and meanwhile
BACK WITH CHARLY - SAME TIME
Her mother. Crouched behind Timothy's RED JAGUAR. Scans
through the rifle's Starlight Scope. Sweating. Intense. We
see the landscape, cast in ghostly GREEN.
CHARLY
Where'd you go, baby... show Mommy...
*There*. Bingo. Charly watches through the scope as a TINY
GREEN CAITLIN climbs into the box and shuts the lid.
Unfortunately, a nearby blue-suit has WITNESSED this. He
looks around, stabbing a finger at the box:
NOSY BLUE-SUIT
Hey. Hey, you see that? A little kid --
A bullet slams him backward in a cut-string sprawl.
WITH CHARLY
She lowers the rifle. Nods grimly:
CHARLY
Smart girl, honey. Stay still. Don't
make a sound. Snug as a bug in a
rug...
MEANWHILE, ELSEWHERE ON THE GROUNDS
HENESSEY, on the move. Crouched low. Choking on woodsmoke,
eyes streaming. Up ahead, a splayed CORPSE -- He hunkers
over the poor schmuck, guy's good for a radio. Snatches up
the portable unit. Fumbles with the dial, searching for 26.9
megahertz...
CHARLY slews to a stop in the red Jag. Leaps out. Darts along
the cliff, throws herself flat. Peering down at the grounds,
sniper rifle positioned -- Babysitting the tanker.
HEARS HENESSEY... Calling to her on the radio.
HENESSEY (V.O.)
Charly, you there? Hello, Charly.
Grabs the unit from her belt:
CHARLY
Mitch! I don't believe it. Listen,
if you say, "Are we having fun yet"
I'll rip your nuts off. Where are
you?
HENESSEY
Behind the big garage. Is Caitlin
with you?
CHARLY
No, but she's safe for the moment,
she stowed away on the tanker truck.
Henessey draws a sharp breath. Swallows, says:
HENESSEY
Charly, Timothy rigged the tanker to
go off early. We got fifteen minutes.
No more.
On her reaction we CUT TO:
Beside the tanker, A PANEL TRUCK sits, engine idling. Phony
logo on its side -- *Little Debbie* snack cakes. A RAMP is
lowered, and a CAR begins backing up into the truckbed, facing
outwards.
INSIDE THE TRUCKBED, harried blue-suits hurriedly unwrap the
frost-covered corpse of IMN AL RAHMAN -- and place him behind
the wheel.
MEANWHILE, AT THE BACK OF THE TANKER
A blue-suit puts a PADLOCK on the utility box as he passes.
SNAPS IT SHUT.
BACK WITH HENESSEY - SAME TIME
He hears two flat CRACK-!s on the still air.
HENESSEY
Hello...! Charly...?
Even over the receiver, her desperation's apparent:
CHARLY
Tires won't pop, Mitch. Bastard just
locked her in, she's stuck in there
and they're leaving, *Goddammit*!
Henessey rubs his eyes. Takes several deeps breaths, mind
turning it over. He looks up. Tired. Haunted.
HENESSEY
All right, I'll go in and get her,
you watch my back.
CHARLY
No chance. I make it twelve, Mitch,
automatic weapons.
HENESSEY
So kill 'em for me, bitch, Christ,
what are you good for?
He stuffs a fresh clip in the gun. Wipes away sweat.
HENESSEY
(to himself)
C'mon, buddy. Do one thing right,
just this once... please...
Closes his eyes. Gathers himself. Long pause...
HENESSEY
Piece of cake.
He leaps from the roof and makes a death run.
Gun in one hand, radio in the other. Swerving and dodging
like a broken-field runner, CHARLY in his ear screaming:
CHARLY (V.O.)
*Your nine, on your nine*!
He spins, BLASTS AWAY, dead guy, pitching forward -- SMOKE,
billowing, making him COUGH...
CHARLY (V.O.)
*30 degrees left, Mitch. Left*.
(beat)
*Your other left*.
Stumbling, catching himself. Barreling forward.
CHARLY (V.O.)
*Nix, nix, I can't see in there,
don't do it, break right...*!
He breaks right.
CHARLY (V.O.)
*Fuck me, I was wrong, get outta
threre*!
He staggers out of the smoke: TWO MEN, MP-5 machine guns.
Trained on his chest. He struggles to aim, oh, shit -- Two
distant CRACKS. The bad men go away, catapulted backwards.
Henessey shouts into the radio:
HENESSEY
Gracias.
CHARLY (V.O.)
*De nada*.
UP ABOVE, ON THE HILL
CHARLY fires shot after shot. Every time she squeezes the
trigger, someone dies. No such thing as wounded, we're talking
St. Peter looks up from a magazine and says holy shit, it's
the lunch rush at Kate Mantilini's.
BACK DOWN BELOW
The smoke clears and Mitch sees the tanker. Right there,
thirty yards away. Yellow UTILITY BOX. No one in the way.
CHARLY (V.O.)
*End run, Mitch, go wide*!
He breaks for the truck.
CHARLY (V.O.)
*No, Goddamn you, they got you
flanked...*!
Everybody fires a gun.
MITCH GETS HIT
Takes one high in the chest, SPINS him...!
UP ON THE HILL
CHARLY SPRAYS on full auto, DICES TO TATTERS the combat zone,
extinguishing the gunmen, too little too late because
MITCH IS IN DEEP
BAM--! bullet takes out his right arm, fuck *you*, buddy,
doesn't miss a beat, simply tosses the gun over to the other
hand and KEEPS SHOOTING, blows that fucker down and now he's
staggering into the trees, and collapses, and HITS... And
lies very still and bleeds. As ECHOES of gunfire die slowly,
we HEAR:
HENESSEY (V.O.)
Dear Ma: I'm looking at the ants,
they're pretty great. Some really
funny ants here, Ma. All these funny
ants, think I'll stay and watch 'em
awhile...
UP ON THE HILL
Aftermath... Charly's out of ammo. Flings aside the rifle,
snarling in a helpless rage -- Something else, then. SOUND,
nearby. Building in pitch, reaching a crescendo --
A SCREAMING CHOPPER RISES BEHIND HER.
Crests the cliff and hovers like the SWORD OF DAMOCLES.
The TANKER is rolling. Out onto the road, snorting and
belching. Preceded by the Little Debbie PANEL TRUCK.
A silver device attached to the skin of the tank.
WITH TIMOTHY - CROSSING THE SMOKE-FILLED GROUNDS
He consults a tiny, liquid crystal display on his watch. Red
numerals. *178 degrees*.
She won't quit. Busy now, deftly sticking the wad of C-4
EXPLOSIVE to the bottom of the Jaguar. Straightens. Turns
around --
Stands dead calm as they all come out of the TREES, guns
drawn... Raises her hands, see, boys...? No bang-bang.
Like backlit monsters, they approach, hulking. Matter of
yards, now... She flashes a naughty little smile --
Goes backward off the cliff and rockets earthward.
200 feet of open air, THE BUNJEE Cord pays out, fast...!
Whipsaws out the door of the Jaguar, hooked by carabiner to
the STEERING COLUMN and meanwhile
THE CHAPTER AGENTS
Rush forward, incredulous. Peer OVER THE EDGE: Below them, a
swan diver, BLACKNESS all around. She drops like a stone.
Vanishes into the fog, beautiful as a poem.
INSIDE THE JAGUAR: The cord goes taut -- Now it starts to
stretch outward. DECELERATION kicking in, Charly can FEEL
it, still whistling through space...
Hits a dead stop.
This is it. Cord, stretched as far as it goes.
She's still sixty feet above the highway.
No hesitation whatsoever. She thumbs the DETONATOR in her
right fist --
Blows the car.
UP ABOVE - CLIFF'S EDGE
The Jaguar goes up with a solid CRUMP--! Blown off the edge
of the cliff. Along with a half dozen screaming AGENTS.
BACK WITH CHARLY - FALLING
Lifeline cut. 60 feet above the road, no problem. She does
thirty feet in freefall. Raises her left hand --
Slaps a carabiner on a passing POWER LINE. Hurtles downward
until suddenly, KA-CHUK--! She LURCHES to a stop.
Doesn't miss a beat: Grips a rope and GLIDES the last thirty
feet, touches down lightly. Unhooks herself, turns as AN
ONCOMING CAR throws a fishtail SKID, just misses her. Driver
SWEARS.
She raises her gun. Fires without blinking.
Puts a hole in the passenger side windshield and the DRIVER
ain't sticking around, he's out the door and gone as
CHARLY THE EXTERMINATOR
Crosses to the car, face a stone mask. Behind her the FLAMING
JAGUAR SMASHES to the ground, raining fragments -- Followed
by BURNING CORPSES, smacking the pavement one after another.
She doesn't even look. Gets behind the wheel. Leaves most of
her tires on the road behind her.
Milling crowds. Music and laughter. SANTA heads up a TEEMING
PARADE down Main Street, atop a horse-drawn sleigh... Replay
of the film's opening, as
The gleaming TANKER roars down a sidestreet. Riding point:
the innocuous PANEL TRUCK.
The temperature gauge continues to RISE: *203 degrees*.
Charly runs a roadblock, doing fifty -- Someone put a PARADE
in front of her. Hits the BRAKES...! Fishtales into a mailbox.
Sends it flying through a plate glass window. Out of the
car, gun held low, and meanwhile --
SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE TANKER. Horses at full gallop, hooves
in pounding frenzy. Charly tries to JUMP from one to the
other -- no go, the tanker pulls away, widening the distance,
and meanwhile
TWO GOVERNMENT SEDANS
Come whipping out of ALLEYS, fall in behind them. CRACK--!
Gunshots, shattering the stillness.
A RICOCHET whines off a hydraulic cable. Spurt of fluid as
the BRAKES start to go, and meanwhile
BACK ON THE SLEIGH
CHARLY throws herself flat next to Santa.
CHARLY
Sorry, man. Government agents, high
level conspiracy.
SANTA
Fuckin' government.
The SEDANS jockey for position, try to pull ABREAST -- Charly
swerves the sleigh back and forth, won't let them through.
She hands the reigns to Santa.
CHARLY
Veer left.
SANTA
Away from the truck?
CHARLY
Do it. In five seconds I'm gonna own
that fucking truck.
Santa complies. PEELS OFF to the left -- Opens a TWELVE FOOT
chasm between sleigh and tanker. Sure enough, one of the
government cars spurts forward to fill the gap, comes ABREAST
of them. It's what she wanted.
*FIVE SECONDS*:
Charly Baltimore LEAPS from the sleigh, lands atop the
government car. Skips lightly across it, casually BLOWS TWO
SHOTS through the ROOF. Down through the metal. Drilling
into their heads. Driver and passenger, killed instantly --
As Charly hops nimbly from her 50 mile-an-hour STEPPING STONE.
Over to the tanker. Dump-stuffs a new clip, as
THE CORPSE CAR
Fades from the race, driverless. Whipping out of control.
FISHTAILS away behind them -- Takes out the SECOND CHASE
CAR, spray of metal.
Three seconds, and Charly's taken out two pursuers.
The tanker slides, DETONATING planters one by one... Comes
to rest in a central COURTYARD. Lies there, a hissing
dinosaur.
TIMOTHY'S TEMPERATURE GAUGE is still affixed to the truck's
underbelly: *280 degrees*.
The doors burst open and here she comes. Trauma, severe.
Shock, blood loss -- She makes for the tanker. For her kid.
Hitches. Staggers. Going on sheer guts.
THE HELICOPTER ROARS OVERHEAD
The PILOT brandishes his radio mic:
PILOT
Got her. Heading for the tanker,
thirty yards out. She's all over the
place, something's wrong with her.
WITH CHARLY
Left foot, right foot, she's not running, she's falling in a
straight line -- Reaches the tanker. Staggers against the
inverted chassis. UTILITY BOX. Above her.
CHARLY
*Cover your ears*.
She raises her gun. Fires. BAM-! Lock springs to pieces.
CAITLIN tumbles to the pavement, dazed and confused. Casts
about --
CAITLIN
MOMMY...!
She springs to her feet. Comes running and flings both arms
around her mother. HUGS HER -- That one puts Charly out for
a few seconds. PAIN, excruciating. Comes to her senses,
swaying like a clothesline in a high wind...
CHARLY
Run... get out...
CAITLIN
Don't go away again, Please...!
Charly grabs Caitlin's head. Turns it. Facing the TEMPERATURE
GAUGE. Red numerals: *301 degrees*.
CHARLY
The truck's a bomb... gonna blow up,
RUN... I'm right behind you, go...
Caitlin hovers, torn. Charly summons a gutteral CROAK:
CHARLY
...*Go and don't look back*...
In the end, Caitlin relents. RUNS, toward the surrounding
woods... Charly watches her go. Nods, satisfied -- Collapses.
Hits the tarmac and splays in a heap. Breath wheezing in and
out. Already the pavement is staining red.
WITH CAITLIN
As, within ten seconds of the command, she promptly DISOBEYS
her mother, looks back -- Stops dead.
There's a corpse underneath the truck.
It isn't moving. It isn't breathing. It isn't laughing or
crying...
Or hurting, not anymore.
CAITLIN
*Mommy, no...*!
Bomb forgotten. Danger forgotten. Her tiny arms pumping,
feet slapping pavement -- She returns to her mother. Grabs
one knife-bloodied shoulder, oblivious of the wound. Jerks
back and forth. Frenzied.
CAITLIN
It's okay. I'm sorry I left, please
wake up, come on please...
CHARLY. Cheek against the pavement. One lifeless eye STARES.
Bloodshot and sightless.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Government vehicles, pulling up now. At the edge of the
parking lot. 100 yards away, give or take. Numerous SEDANS.
The Little Debbie panel truck. AGENTS crouch behind cars.
Weapons trained on the wounded behemoth.
The side door BURSTS OUTWARD and a limping figure emerges,
frantically signaling for the chopper: TIMOTHY'S got murder
in his eye. THE CHOPPER banks, coming in low as he hauls
himself aboard.
PILOT
Sir, your shoulder --
TIMOTHY
Fuck the shoulder, knee's worse.
Just bring me around and hold her
steady. I'm not leaving until I know
the bitch is dead.
He grabs an automatic rifle.
BACK WITH CAITLIN - UNDERNEATH THE TANKER
She adheres to Charly's motionless form. Looking small and
terrified. Whispers in her mother's ear. Soft and low:
CAITLIN
Mommy, get up now. You just stop it,
Mommy, you stop being a little baby.
Stop it, you're not dead, I know
you're not dead so you get up now.
Face contorted, she strikes out. Flails. HITS Charly.
CAITLIN
*Don't you die*, you get up now,
Goddammit...! Life is pain, you just
get used to it, and stand up *right
this minute*, Mommy. Life is pain,
do it, you bitch. *Do it*.
Tears coursing in rivulets. Little fists clenched. Then --
It might be a trick of the wind. Tiny aspiration, not enough
breath to fog a mirror...
CHARLY
...mommy... here...
A solitary tear appears in the wide-open staring eye. One
fingernail, then. Scratches feebly. Toes, shifting. Seeking
purchase. A HAND, planting itself... TEETH BARED, a rictus
of pain... Rising up...
*Standing*. Full height now, flexing one deadly arm. She
hugs her daughter and says:
CHARLY
...You're grounded...
Overhead, the HOWLING of rotor blades. Charly gasps for
breath. Cracks open the GUN... no bullets. Swell. Scans the
pavement... There. THE MP-5 machine gun lies twenty feet
from her. Twenty miles, same difference. Across the pavement,
even farther away: Timothy's car.
*305 degrees*. Charly swallows hard:
CHARLY
I'm gonna get the gun, you run for
that car. We go on three, okay? One...
Two... *Three*.
They break cover. Into the open. A WITHERING FIRE ERUPTS.
Right at their feet...! Geysers of asphalt, shot skyward --
TIMOTHY sprays the blacktop from above. Ruthless. Charly
goes insane. Lurches, crazed, to the cab of the truck. Thumbs
the mike and says:
CHARLY
Somebody get that motherfucker off
me! I got a kid here, I got my eight
year-old daughter, *Jesus Christ*...!
It's Christmas Eve, who are you
*people*, fucking pull him off! Do
you hear me...?
CUT TO:
EYES SNAP OPEN IN DARKNESS. We don't know whose they are. We
don't know where we are.
BACK WITH CHARLY - SAME TIME
The temperature gauge: *308 degrees*. She clutches Caitlin.
Shouting into the mic:
CHARLY
Distract him, for God's sake give me
ten seconds, please, I'm begging
somebody, anybody, *she's my
daughter*...!
A sour-looking CHAPTER AGENT stands before a row of cars and
the Little Debbie panel truck. Expressionless beaurocrat.
Lifts the mic to his lips and says:
CHAPTER BEAUROCRAT
Negative, ma'am, we understand your
request, but we've decided to go
ahead and let this play out...
Behind him, the back of the panel truck EXPLODES. A car
CATAPULTS outward into space -- SMASHES DOWN atop two sedans.
Blows out their windshields. Flings itself to the pavement
and RICOCHETS forward, zero to sixty.
MITCH HENESSEY
At the wheel. Making a suicide run. Face a FRIGHT MASK of
deadly purpose. We have no idea why someone who looks like
him is alive.
They have to drag Timothy inside the car. The engine ROARS
as it leaps forward, trailing the other FIVE -- Scarred and
hideous, he stares after Charly, screaming:
TIMOTHY
*Somebody do her, somebody kill that
fucking whore, kill her*!
That's when the helicopter crashes. The pilot does everything
but flap his arms -- Forget it. IT KEELS OVER. Rotor touches
pavement -- Blows to pieces. They ALL go. Snapped off. Blown
like rockets in every direction.
TIMOTHY LOOKS UP as a rotor blade whistles right through the
windshield of his car. Shears off his HEAD. Blows out the
BACK in a shower of glass and hurtles onward, SPINNING out
of control...
Strikes the tanker. Boom.
Imagine God in Monte Carlo. Tossing dice the length of a
craps table. Now, imagine the dice are BURNING CARS.
Henessey flies out of the parking lot and INTO the WOODS as
the firestorm RAGES TO HEAVEN behind him. Cars, heading his
way -- AIRBORNE. Fights the wheel, swerving through the woods
as all around him, FLAMING CARS crash down. BOUNCING into
and out of the trees, peekaboo...
Some go flying past OVERHEAD. Striking in front like meteors,
GOUGING the earth. Caitlin screams:
CAITLIN
Don't hit the cars!
Henessey favors her with a foul look. CHARLY looks up and
sees ANGELS flying overhead, trailing concrete...
Then they're OUT OF THE WOODS. Car slingshots onto the highway
and races forward, SAFE. Behind it, the sky is aglow, SNOWING
fiery traces... Bits of earth, trees, pavement.
OVERHEAD VIEW: As they roar out of town, we see burning woods
and a CRATER approximately 150 yards in diameter -- St.
Peter's Seminary no longer exists... CUT TO:
Henessey coasts to the side of the road and stops. He lays
his head on the steering wheel, sucking air. Looks at Charly:
HENESSEY
Sorry, can't drive... Are you okay...?
CHARLY
(grimaces)
...Are you... stupid...?
HENESSEY
...funny thing...? You aren't going
to die... I am...
Charly offers him that soft, sad little smile.
CHARLY
I know.
Henessey starts to fade... breathing labored... Reaches up...
strokes Caitlin's hair. Smiles at her:
HENESSEY
Hey, gorgeous... know something...
you got your mother's eyes... don't
let... nobody tell you different...
Slumps back in the seat. Gazing at Charly. A single tear
runs from one bloodshot eye. He whispers:
HENESSEY
Scared... to be nobody... without a
ripple... please... remember me...
(beat)
...Love you...
Dies.
Charly leans on the dash. Cries for awhile. For herself...
for Henessey... for this Godawful planet, and everything
else. DISSOLVE TO:
MR. PERKINS emerges from a guest cottage, flanked by his
aide Harry.
AIDE
...They'll push for dismantlement of
our apparatus in Chile, but we've
got a degree of plausible
deniability...
Harry's FOOT comes down on a circular slab of STONE -- and a
voice from the grave says:
VOICE (O.S.)
Stay very still.
Stops him in his tracks, stops him dead --
As CHARLY BALTIMORE steps from the nearby trees. Stands,
twenty yards downrange. Beretta leveled at both of them.
Two months, you barely notice the limp. She stands there in
sleeveless top and short skirt and looks like a million.
Thumbs a metal box, click-! A red ARMING LIGHT blinks on.
CHARLY
Good morning, I'm Charly. The slab
you're standing on is actually a
land mine. Keep your foot on the
pressure plate, nothing happens.
Step off the stone, we'll all be
wearing you.
PERKINS steps forward. The gun shifts. Targets him.
PERKINS
Charly, I know we've treated you
poorly, please, it was just business --
She reaches in a pocket. Tosses him a cellular phone -- He
catches it as though it were a live snake.
CHARLY
My terms are these. Call State and
order full disclosure on your personal
correspondence. Then disband Chapter,
effective immediately. In exchange...?
I won't shoot you, and I won't make
you stand on that mine. I won't touch
you. I won't touch you. I promise.
PERKINS
You... you promise.
He swallows hard. Looks to his aide... back to her... DIALS.
Charly takes a deep breath. Scans the flowers, face placid.
It's really quite lovely today. Maybe she'll start a garden.
Perkins clicks off. Look at Charly:
PERKINS
It's done. Now, you promise... you
won't shoot me... won't make me get
on the mine...?
CHARLY
I promise.
She smiles. Shifts her aim and shoots the other guy.
Perkins' eyes WIDEN in sudden realization. He LUNGES forward,
grabs the aide, holding him up... desperately propping his
dead weight atop the land mine...
PERKINS
Goddamn you, I can't hold him... You
bitch... YOU FUCKING BITCH...!
Henessey's CHRYSLER CONVERTIBLE has been restored to a cherry
red. It purrs along the boulevard, Charly at the wheel. Hair
blowing. She talks on the cellular phone:
CHARLY
Yes, Mr. President, you have my
assurance that Perkins' latest
operation has been rendered beyond
salvage.
Behind her a GOUT OF EARTH blows skyward. Showers the road a
ways back.
CHARLY
He's not in the greatest shape either.
INTERCUT - PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
He speaks from the oval office, face grave:
PRESIDENT
I owe you an astounding debt of
thanks, Colonel. Would it be
impertinent to ask if you'd consider
working for State again? The moneys
involved would be substantial.
CHARLY
Out of the question. I've got a stack
of papers to grade. Listen, before I
go, I need a small favor...
Henessey's EX-WIFE stands in the open doorway, flanked by
her son TODD. Two uniformed COPS speak solemnly:
UNIFORM COP #1
...As I say, we can only apologize
for the system, Ma'am, but it's
confirmed that your husband is
innocent of the crime for which he
was imprisoned. This is a photograph
of the actual criminal...
He shows her a mug shot of TIMOTHY.
UNIFORM COP #1
A petty thief, now deceased. I'll
respect your wishes should you choose
to file charges against the State
Attorney...
In the eyes of a young boy, Henessey finds redemption.
Sun, passing into mystery. Wheatfield, rippling. Caitlin is
in the yard, chasing a big floppy-eared Labrador.
On the porch, a CRICKET chirps. HAL comes out, sits beside
his wife CHARLY as she finishes eating. Says softly:
HAL
Just talked to Dr. Sullivan, she's
gonna need the full braces. Even
with your teaching, insurance won't
cover it... I don't know what to do.
Pause. Charly says nothing. The dog parades up to Caitlin
with a stick in its jaws. A farm truck goes by, a faraway
speck.
Charly absent-mindedly rolls a steak knife in her fingers.
Eyes far away.
It never occurs to her what she's done until the chirping
stops.
Ten feet away, the knife quivers.
FADE OUT. ROLL END CREDITS.
