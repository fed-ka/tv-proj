 
 A cluster of low buildings, a bud of civilization whose 
 outlying roadways vein a vast plain. 
 
     PICARD (V.O.) 
   Captain's log, Stardate 43489.2. 
   We have arrived at Angosia, a 
   planet that is eager for 
   membership in the Federation. 
 
 
 PICARD and RIKER are with NAYROK, the Angosian leader, 
 in the rotunda of the senate building. The Angosians 
 take their civic duty very seriously and the senate is 
 considered a repository of wisdom and law. Various 
 government officials and petitioners pass by, either 
 in deep discussion or thoughtful meditation. 
 
     PICARD 
   I'm greatly impressed with what 
   I've seen so far, Prime Minister. 
 
     NAYROK 
   Then I hope it will reflect 
   favorably in your report, Captain. 
 
     RIKER 
   It's a tribute to your people to 
   have recovered so rapidly from 
   the Tarsian War. 
 
     NAYROK 
   It is indeed. 
    (sadly) 
   We are not warriors. We believe 
   reason can settle disputes. But 
   not every culture agrees with our 
   position. 
 
     PICARD 
   An unfortunate reality.

     NAYROK 
   The development of the mind, the 
   cultivation of the intellect -- 
   these are the pursuits to which 
   the Angosians have dedicated 
   themselves for centuries. 
 
 Nayrok nods and is about to respond... but is 
 interrupted by ZAYNAR, an aide who casually interrupts. 
 
     ZAYNAR 
   I'm sorry to interrupt, Prime 
   Minister. There's a problem. 
   May I see you a moment? 
 
     NAYROK 
   Excuse me, gentlemen. 
 
3    ANGLE -- 
 
 on Picard and Riker. 
 
     PICARD 
   I think they'll make a fine 
   addition to the Federation, Number 
   One... 
 
 Riker acknowledges, but without enthusiasm. Off 
 Picard's look... 
 
     RIKER 
   I'm not sure I'd want to live 
   here. A little stuffy for my 
   taste. 
 
 Picard thinks it over, nods slightly. It's a little 
 dry for his taste, too. 
 
4    ANOTHER ANGLE -- 
 
 Nayrok returns, his face has a look of concern... 
 
     NAYROK 
   A prisoner has escaped from the 
   penal colony on Lunar Five. 
    (shaking his head) 
   Two guards are dead. The prisoner 
   has taken a transport vessel.

     NAYROK 
   The tracking station was 
   sabotaged. The entire base is 
   in chaos. We have ordered ships 
   from the surface to follow him, 
   but to be honest, our civilian 
   pilots are not trained to handle 
   this... 
 
     RIKER 
   With your permission, sir... ? 
 
 Picard acknowledges. 
 
     RIKER 
    (keying his insignia) 
   Mister Data, a stolen transport 
   vessel has departed from Lunar 
   Five. Have you picked it up on 
   sensors? 
 
         INTERCUT: 
 
 
 Moving toward the transport vessel... which disappears 
 behind the asteroid. 
 
 
 The tractor beam shoots out from the Enterprise towards 
 the tiny half-ship, which begins to turn to face the 
 Enterprise. 
 
 
 No longer enveloped in the tractor beam, the transport 
 vessel hurtles head on towards the Enterprise, then 
 skids off the invisible shield, away from the ship. 
 
 
 continuing to orbit the planet. 
 
 
 An Angosian transport ship is now in proximity to the 
 Enterprise.

   First officer's log, supplemental. 
   We are continuing to repair damage 
   to the ship's sensors following 
   the escape of the Angosian 
   prisoner Danar. He is still at 
   large. 
 
 
 
 As it warps away to a new adventure. 
 
         FADE OUT.
