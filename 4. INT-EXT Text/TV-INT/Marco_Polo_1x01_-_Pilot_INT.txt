      MOVE IN THROUGH THE BALCONY CURTAINS... ONTO AN ORNATE BED... 
      where 17 year-old Marco Polo makes hot Italian love to 33 
      year-old DONA CATERINA, a blonde Venetian.

                                  MARCO 
                    Sei molto bella...

                          (edge of orgasm)
                    You must leave...

      But her long legs are wrapped tightly around him.

                                  MARCO
                    My soul is moist... but when I touch 
                    your breasts, I feel the sun... 
                          (kissing her areola)
                    Sea foam and roses... what is this 
                    scent? Profumo segreto?

      Her fingernails cat-claw into his back. And then -- SUDDEN 
      BANGING AT THE DOOR.

      Young Marco rolls into his trousers. The naked Dona Caterina, 
      nipples erect, blonde tresses wild, ushers him out --

      ONTO THE BALCONY

      Where he gets dressed on the reckless descent, climbing down 
      the portico where incoming ships SOUND BELLS and A DOG BARKS

      Marco sits at the end of a cot, studying parchment charts. 
      His finger traces the Silk Road route on one such flat-earth 
      map (along with India and Arabia, the map also recognizes the 
      Garden of Eden and sea monsters).

EPISODE 101



      The Old Man and TWO OTHER RELATIVES lead young Marco into the 
      ancient church. Dimly-lit, stained glass. Empty.

      Marco proceeds alone -- slowly, steadily -- down the dark 
      aisle toward -- THE FRONT PEW.

      Where NICCOL  POLO kneels, an ornate silver cross in his 
      fist. The merchant is dark eyed and handsome, but years of 
      sea and desert travel have weathered his olive skin.

      He looks up to see his son for the very first time. An 
      emotional albeit awkward moment...

                                    NICCOL 
                    Marco. She gave you a fine name. 
                    Come here, Son...

      Marco enters the pew. Stands taller than his father. Much 
      leaner. Niccol  admires his stature, his striking face. Tears 
      well a bit... then he kisses the lad on each cheek.

                                    NICCOL  (CONT D)
                    When did she die?

                                  MARCO
                    I was six.

      Niccol  ruminates. 

                                    NICCOL 
                    For you...

      He lifts the fine silver cross with Latin inscription and 
      drapes the chain around his son s neck.

                                    NICCOL  (CONT D)
                    From Jerusalem. 

      Marco fairly beams; a gift from his father, great explorer 
      returned. Then Niccol  notes that the young man s curious 
      eyes are on --

      ANOTHER BEARDED MAN, standing off, speaking in hushed tones 
      to FATHER GREGORY, an ancient Catholic Priest.

                                    NICCOL  (CONT D)
                    Your Uncle Maffeo. Not as pretty as 
                    me, admit it. But he, too, is 
                    pleased to be home; he missed the 
                    red wine. And the fat women.

      Niccol  gestures for Marco to sit.

                    Some say you saw India. Arabia. Is 
                    it true, Father? That the remains 
                    of Noah s Ark rest somewhere in the 
                    mountain ranges of Asia, Armenia

                    in Venezia... stretches four 
                    thousand miles across the world.

      Marco s eyes are glowing with imagination...

                                  MARCO
                    Did you reach Cathay?

                                    NICCOL 
                    Indeed. Some men now call it 
                     China . And it is to China that I 
                    must return.

      Marco s smile holds, but his eyes betray. 

                                    NICCOL  (CONT D)
                    I have no choice. It is a  mission 
                    of utmost importance. 

                                  MARCO

                                    NICCOL 
                    One day you will. For now... let us 
                    go to your Aunt Patrizia s and have 
                    our first cup of wine together. 
                    Then I will show you some of the 
                    wonders I brought back, yes?

      He clasps a hand on Marco s shoulder, but it s not 
      comforting. Marco s mind is reeling...

                                  MARCO (V.O.)
                    How does one tell it? I was 
                    seventeen when I met my father for 
                    the  first time.... 




      The Polo s are led down an ornate hallway, past gilded 
      chambers where --

      SILK-ROBED SERVANTS and MILITARY OFFICIALS look on in 
      silence. They bow in unison as the exhausted foreigners are 
      led up to a robed EUNUCH. He barks at them in fierce, high-
      pitched MANDARIN.

      The Polo s are handed white slippers which they obediently 
      put on. Now, they are each handed a small, ornate vessel.

                                  MARCO
                    What is the vase for?

                                    NICCOL 
                    Quiet.

                                  EUNUCH
                    Speak softly. Do not look him in 
                    the eye. Wear the slippers so you 
                    do not soil his domain. If you must 
                    spit, use the vase.

      Niccol  has Marco by the arm and speaks urgently into his ear --

                                    NICCOL 
                    Eyes down, down...

      Uncle Maffeo looks particularly unnerved.


      Niccol , Maffeo, and Marco crawl on their hands and knees, 
      heads bowed, through a royal gantlet of WARRIOR NOBLES,  
      BARONS, ruby-lipped CONCUBINES, and the FOUR EMPRESSES.

      Niccol  and Maffeo prostrate themselves, touch their heads to 
      the carpet three times. Marco follows suit. On his third bow, 
      he covertly lifts his eyes, steals a glance upward.

      IN SHADOW AND CANDLE LIGHT: An imposing figure sits on his 
      throne, a TAMED LION near his feet. KUBLAI KHAN dressed in 
      gold and silk. His face is distinctly Mongol; fierce eyes, 
      thick jowls, and cheek bones that could slice a plum. His 
      beard hangs in a sage-like wisp, his long hair braided into 
      loops behind each ear. HIS EYES contain a mischievous gleam, 
      but also something barbaric. Dangerous.

      At a signal, Niccol  hands a leather-wrapped European vessel 
      to an OFFICER who hands it to A BARON who, in turn, brings it 
      up to --  KUBLAI KHAN.

      Who does not speak. He makes a sharp, guttural intake of 
      breath, one that is echoed by his Baron, like two cats 
      coughing. Strange as it is, they are communicating with 
      breathing sounds -- the Ural-Altaic language only a true 
      Mongol can understand. Finally, Kublai Khan speaks -- in 
      impressive English.

                                  KUBLAI KHAN
                    The Latins. Yes. I remember. But 
                    where are the Christian priests you 
                    were to bring?

                                    NICCOL 
                    Lord Kublai... please accept our 
                    remorse. Our priests... they could 
                    not bear the rigors of the journey. 
                    But we did bring you holy oil from --

                                  KUBLAI KHAN
                    -- your men of God retreat, but 
                    this boy advances? This says very 
                    little for your Savior.

                                    NICCOL 
                    Loyalty of a mortal son to his 
                    mortal father, Great Khan.

      The Khan reveals no sympathy.

                    Holy oil. A letter from the Pontiff 
                    who wishes to spread Christianity 
                      throughout my lands. Is this not 
                    the same Pope who has called me the 
                    spawn of Satan?

      The elder Polo s don t flinch.

                                  KUBLAI KHAN (CONT D)
                    I will say this and you will listen: 
                    Buddhism is welcome in my kingdom. As 
                    is Taoism, Confucianism, Islam, and 
                    the Eternal Blue Sky of my grandfather 
                    Genghis Khan -- who was descended from 
                    a wolf. 

      Marco reacts, equal parts frightened and intrigued. His 
      father and uncle appear terrified. The Great Khan cradles the 
      vessel of holy oil, examining it in the light.

                                  KUBLAI KHAN (CONT D)
                    I revere them all. The Mongols 
                    don t care, you see, which God is 
                      worshipped in their lands. As long 
                    as all are faithful to the Great 
                    Khan and obey his laws, they can do 
                    whatever they please with their 
                    souls.

      Now the Khan gestures and the Baron signals for the 
      foreigners to rise and face His August Personage.

                                  KUBLAI KHAN (CONT D)

                    must come here and demonstrate 
                    miracles. 

      Marco feels the critical eyes of a handsome young Prince in 
      luxurious fox and sable, long Chinese sword at his belt. This 
      is JINGIM, the Junior Khan -- eldest son of Kublai.

      The Khan angles his hard eyes toward the young man. Niccol  
      stops breathing; can t believe his son has spoken out. Maffeo 
      might vomit.

                    As the sand shifts it makes a sound --

      A woman suddenly caterwauls IN MONGOLIAN, shrill and 
      forceful. She is allowed, for she is EMPRESS CHABI, the 
      principal wife of the Khan. 

                                  KUBLAI KHAN
                    The Empress, Chabi, wishes to ask 
                    the young wayfarer a question. 

      He sweeps a hand, inviting her.

                    women of all?

      Marco considers this, feeling the eyes of the entire court on 
      him. Especially that of young Prince Jingim. It feels like 
      some kind of trial.

      Chabi s stern face tightens... then surrenders a smile. 
      Niccol  surrenders a breath of relief.

      The other wives smile, too, and so do the concubines (the 
      lesser ones covering their mouths with silk napkins). A swell 
      of approving giggles travels through the female retinue. 

      One girl in particular lowers her painted fan, revealing 
      stunning eyes. KOKACHIN, early 20s, otherworldly beautiful, 
      peers with curiosity. At her shoulder, a giant of a EUNUCH 
      GUARD hovers like a stone arhat.

      Marco clocks Kokachin, eyes holding on her for a split second 
      before the Khan speaks --

                    Why is it, that when this thin boy 
                    from the West speaks... I see. I see 
                    what my military scouts and map-
                    makers struggle to convey. 
                      Storytellers from Azerbaijan, 
                    magicians from Tibet... can hardly 
                    make invisible places come to life 
                    like this young traveler seems to do. 

      Niccol  and Maffeo exchange glances. Quick glances, but deep --
      as only brothers can do.

                    But if it pleases your Greatness... 
                    you may take him as your man and 
                    servant.

      Marco isn t sure he heard that right. 

      The Khan shifts his eyes from Marco to Niccol . The Great 
      Khan seems to study the dynamic...

                    I give you leave.

      Niccol  turns to his son, stares at him, uncomfortable. 
      Quickly, he embraces him, kisses him on each cheek.

      Marco grips his father s arm, tightly. Niccol  takes his 
      son s hand... and slowly removes it from his arm. 

      Now, Marco finds himself physically separated from his father 
      as an OFFICIAL CEREMONY of ARMED ATTENDANTS surrounds him. 
      MONGOLIAN THROAT-SINGING is starting up; KETTLE DRUMS 
      beginning to boom.

      His eyes follow as Ahmad and an official retinue lead the 
      merchants down a long hall. Marco tries to break free, tries 
      to follow, but he s hemmed in. 

                                  COURT EUNUCH
                    This decree is not done. The

                    for this honor and pledge 
                      loyalty...

      Fuck that. Marco explodes through the official gathering. He 
      doesn t just run. He rampages, trying to get out. 

      FROM HIS THRONE -- The Khan just watches, inscrutable. He 
      makes a simple breath sound and SOLDIERS GO AFTER the 
      runaway.




      OUT OF MIST, Marco emerges naked, scrubbed of lice. 
        Disoriented. The waiting Eunuch hands him some folded 
      clothes. Simple leather and felt.

                                  COURT EUNUCH

      The Scholar gives a toothless grin of Buddhist joy.

                                  OLD SCHOLAR
                    Only the Khan knows. 

      Flustered, Marco looks toward a lute-shaped window through 
      which he can see the sun play on distant mountains of purple 
      mist. Is his father out there somewhere?

      A BIG SHADOW fills the doorway. A LARGE MONGOL GUARD holding 
      a bladed halberd. He summons.




      Inside one of the six halls of the Khanate, a war assembly is 
      being held. The Mongols call this a Kurlitai. But in Kublai s 
      progressive palace it resembles more of an internal meeting 
      of the Superpower: The Great Khan sits on a raised pavilion, 
      the embodiment of opulence and power, looking down over his 
      TWENTY FIVE MAN CABINET:

        Elaborately-dressed Mongols, Chinese, and Muslim Turks -- an 
      administration chosen for both its political and religious 
      balance. In this moment of deep stillness the Khan s TAOIST 
      ADVISOR is casting the I-Ching, a complex system of 
      divination.

      THE KHAN S EYES observe as the Taoist sets down fifty yarrow 
      stalks into 64 six-line patterns. The traditional Mongols 
      sitting nearby all frown, puzzled by Kublai s evolving 
      interest in these cultured Chinese ways.

      Ahmad bows elegantly to Kublai as the Great Khan digests 
      this, showing no emotion...

      An imposing Mongol now makes a breath sound that means he

                    How are things up north, in the old

      It s a voice as deep as the belly of a yak. Tribal. 

                                  ARIQ (CONT D)
                    Things in the old capitol are just 
                    as our grandfather Genghis would 
                    have them. 
                          (a glance at Jingim)
                    The customs of the Mongols are not 
                    those of the Chinese laws. There 
                    are some in Karakorum who fear that 
                    our overlord -- our big brother -- 
                    is becoming... too  Chinese,  too 
                    cultured in his ways --

      Now stands KAIDU of the Western Mongols, a branch that is 
      distinguished by wearing a turban.

                                  KAIDU
                    Lord Khan. May your western cousins 
                    from the House of Ogedei, speak?

      The Khan nods, irritated.

                                  KAIDU (CONT D)
                    We just want to know: Does Our 
                    Great Khan desire to be Emperor of 
                      Mongolia... or Emperor of China?

                    Little Brother. Cousin Kaidu. You 
                      underestimate me.

      Kublai rises to his full height and overweight girth, a bit 
      stiff in the joints, a bit tentative on sore feet. He holds 
      out a hand and an ATTENDANT presents to him a long ceremonial 
      sword...

                    Emperor of China? Emperor of 
                    Mongolia?

      He stabs at what appears to be a rolled silk carpet. As the 
      carpet unrolls down the length of the floor between the 
      seated Mongols and Cabinet, Kublai stands over the great silk 
      map of the massive Khan empire.

                    it now stands in mine...

      SWORD POINT touches a mark on the GREAT SILK MAP OF ASIA --

                      Xiangyang, the walled city. Thus, I 
                    have already sent troops into South 
                    China. They are amassing as I 
                    speak. My spies tell me that in 
                    order to starve the rebels out --
                          (points)
                    -- we must cut them off from the 
                    farming village of Wuchang. I am 
                    sending horse soldiers down to take 
                    that position. My son Jingim, blood 
                    of my blood...

      Jingim looks up, as if snapped from some deep thought.

                                  KUBLAI KHAN (CONT D)
                    ...he will lead the assault.

                    Our Nephew Jingim. Educated in 
                    Chinese ways. Who better to lead an 
                    attack on the Chinese?

      It s a loaded statement disguised as praise. The resentment 
      is palpable, but then --

                                  ARIQ
                    Older Brother. If this is a call to 
                    war... you have your younger 
                    brother s horse and his bow. I will

                    north and into battle with my 
                    nephew.

      A low tone rises up from where the Mongols sit. A vibrating 
      sound from the throat. Blood is in the air...

                                  ARIQ (CONT D)
                    We will crush Wuchang, then take

                          (slaps his heart)
                    -- and by the blood of Genghis, I 
                    will cut their leader s head off 
                    and tie it to the mane of my horse.

      The THROAT SINGING is rising to a deafening level; it could

      Jingim stands there, torn between barbarian inheritance and

      downward, impales the MAP IMAGE OF XIANGYANG, and --




      CHANCELLOR JIA SIDAO, 47, stares with tranquil eyes. The eyes 
      of a warrior-philosopher-sociopath.

                                  JIA SIDAO 
                    My General is great. Do you see?
                    He pretends inferiority to 
                    encourage his opponent s advance...

      HE PEERS DOWNWARD ON: A battle between a praying mantis and a 
      cricket, fighting on a table  arena  between Jia Sidao and 
      his GENERAL RED BROW. The two men bet with paper currency.

      The Chancellor now teases a small bamboo stick at the 
      cricket, makes it turn toward the mantis... 

                                  RED BROW
                    Kublai Khan s men continue to 
                    amass. Have you looked outside the 
                    walls, Chancellor.

                                  JIA SIDAO
                    How is our Emperor?

                                  RED BROW
                    Unwell.

                    How much longer I mean.

      Red Brow glances toward the GUARDED DOORS of the Imperial 
      Chambers where candles burn in vigil.

                    miracle.

      Jia sidao inhales thoughtfully. 

                                  JIA SIDAO
                    It will be a sad day, but much more 
                    efficient once he s gone. No more 
                    mixed messages from an Old King to 
                    the people. I will give all orders 
                    and all orders will be followed.

                                  RED BROW
                    Yes, Chancellor.

                                  JIA SIDAO
                    And that goes for the Emperor s 
                    favorite royal concubine. 

      Red Brow glances back at the Imperial doors again.

                                  RED BROW
                    Where is your sister?

                                  JIA SIDAO
                    Doing what she s famous for. 
                    Improving diplomatic relations with 
                    the Governor of Hangchow.

      The Chancellor smiles, leans forward, watching the mantis 
      grab the cricket. A little boy s head appears, head shaven 
      but for a long plaited queue. When he tries to grab a 
      cricket, the Chancellor grabs his arm, fiercely. Then he 
      loosens the grip, checks his temper. He smiles at little ZHAO 
      XIAN and pats the top of his head. The boy runs off...




      MEI LIN rides atop the breathless GOVERNOR OF HANGCHOW. Naked -- 
      her hair up in a coiled bun, held by a jade ornament -- her 
      shoulder reveals a vibrant tattoo of a dragon coiled around a 
      rose vine.

                    White Tiger enters the Jade Portal.

      Whatever it is she is subtly doing with her ass, half-lit by 
      candles, is pushing the politician to the verge of cardiac.

      Then she stops, suddenly, like a skilled mime. With his other 
      hand, the Governor sets down more money. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/1232.

      bun. She removes the jade ornament and lets her hair cascade 
      long and loose. He almost passes out over her legendary 
      beauty... and then she puts the jade pin to his throat. His 
      eyes widen in terror... an assassination?

                                  MEI LIN

                                  KUBLAI KHAN
                    You will now walk back down the 
                    Hall of the Five Desires. These 
                    girls from Kungarut are highly 
                    skilled in the arts of love. A man 
                    who proves loyal to me can take 
                    what he wishes...

      Marco isn t sure if this is a test, a reward, or part of his 
      training. Chabi studies him with great interest.

                                  KUBLAI KHAN (CONT D)
                    The walls have eyes, Master Marco. 

      Marco finishes his wine. He bows...




      Marco walks the sexual gantlet, CONCUBINES now snaking their 
      jeweled arms out at him, touching, teasing. A CHINESE GIRL 
      snaps open a bamboo fan with a puff of perfume... INTO OPIUM 
      MIST he finds himself...

      PASSING BETWEEN TWO BEDS OF SILK, CONCUBINES on each side, 
      stroking his belt, cooing at his hip... 

      Four, five, SIX GIRLS are teasing, demonstrating  The 
      Forbidden Cicada Dance.  Marco takes a kiss and weakens. 
      Drawn to the flesh, young loins aching. The walls have eyes 
      the Khan said. Marco seems to be deciphering that now as he 
      continues his slow, disciplined passage though the sensual 
      maze... 




      Marco, feeling the opium smoke around him, is pulled to a 
      bamboo swing where a pair of KUNGARUT TWINS demonstrate 
       Tiger s Crawl  for one of the Khan s younger wives who lays 
      naked with them. One of them kisses his eyelid, then gently 
      blows smoke in his face. Hard as it is, he moves past the 
      swing...




      A CONCUBINE MOANS under the lips of another as MORE GIRLS 
      undo Marco s shirt, tease his nipples with feathers. One 
      kisses his torso all the way down while his head swims in 
      incense and perfume. He makes it past her...




      Marco reaches the door out, sweat-soaked. He nearly 
      collapses. 

                                  MARCO 
                    Madre di Dio...




      Marco sits by his lantern, sketching calligraphy into his 
      journal. A figure appears in his open door, a SLAVE from 
      Lesser India.

                                  SLAVE
                    Master Marco. You requested more 
                    salt cakes?

      Marco gestures to his bedding and the Slave sets the bundle 
      down.

                                  MARCO
                          (thank you in Hindi)
                    Sukriya.

      Marco waits for the slave to leave. Then he gets up quickly, 
      takes the bundle of salt cakes and hides them, with a second 
      bundle, in a secret satchel.

      He hears HOOFBEATS now. A FEW DOGS BARKING...




      Kublai sits at a marble chess table in an open garden off of 
      his inner sanctum. Jingim sits across from him, freshly 
      bathed and bandaged, back in the Chinese silks of a royal.

                                  JINGIM
                    My First General advised retreat. I 
                    gave the order that we turn and 
                    fight. Like Mongols.

                    Mongols do not lose.

      He moves an  elephant  piece. Jingim watches it, an excuse to 
      lower his eyes. 

      Chabi comes out of the shadows in her night robes. In this 
      moment, the powerful First Lady is simply a concerned mother. 
      She checks on her son s wound, and he responds to the 
      affection --

                    Chabi...

      Chabi defies her husband for a moment, wants to see for 
      herself that her eldest son, Heir to the Throne, is all 
      right. Finally, she leaves...

                                  KUBLAI KHAN (CONT D)
                    How bad is the wound?

                                  JINGIM
                    A scar... that will always remind 
                    me of Wuchang. And all the men and 
                    horses that died. That s the only 
                    wound, Father.

                                  KUBLAI KHAN
                    You will ride to the old Capitol 
                    and find my brother Ariq. I want to 
                    know why he pledged his horse and 
                    bow... but then did not arrive to 
                    support my army.

      Jingim sits there for a time, listening to the peacocks in 
      the Khan s ornate aviary.

                                  JINGIM

      floor --

                                  JINGIM
                    Of course, I did. Something went

      Chabi is standing off, pretending to be watching the moon. 
      But now she turns and watches her husband and son, troubled. 
      Kublai feels her eyes.

                                  KUBLAI KHAN (CONT D)
                    Go see the Chinese healer. Have 
                    your wounds looked after...

      Jingim leaves the chess table. The Khan sits there in dark 
      rumination.




      Kokachin is in her bath, pampered by THREE FEMALE ATTENDANTS. 
      One does her feet, one treats her ears with oils, the third 
      does her hands. 

      Za Bing enters, speaking Mandarin, and the Attendants leave.  
      Alone with the girl, Za Bing hands her some folded parchment. 
      She stares at it, does not take it.

                                  KOKACHIN
                      A proposal? The Prince of Bukhara?

                                  ZA BING
                    No. Someone left it on the garden 
                    wall.

      Curious, she takes it, unfolds it. She studies the 
        calligraphy, barely dry.

                                  KOKACHIN
                    The calligraphy is terrible. I 
                    can t even read it.

      She shoves it back at him. Za Bing reads it in the light.

                                  ZA BING
                     Sublime Beauty has a truth all 
                    it s own. 

      Kokachin isn t sure how to react, but Za Bing fairly swoons. 
      He needs to open his bamboo fan and cool himself.

      Kokachin takes the parchment again and looks at it.




      A DOOR KNOCKER wakes Marco from a deep sleep. As he gets up, 
      pulls trousers on:

                                  MARCO
                    Sanga? Is it tax day?

      Marco opens the door to see THREE MONGOL GUARDS. They stare 
      daggers. Marco feels the color leave his face.




      Marco stands before the Great Khan, nervous. Again, the Khan 
      presides with a cruel silence.

                                  KUBLAI KHAN
                    How goes your horse riding?

      Marco is already imagining the fifty blows of the rod, or

                    By your will, Sire.

      Kublai nods, barely. Sends him out.




      Ariq and Jingim walk clockwise in the vast circle of the 
      great yurt, its walls lined with snow leopard pelts and 
      ornate wooden saddles. Primitive elegance.

                                  ARIQ
                    ...this one they call the Cricket 
                    Minister, he is a snake in the 
                    grass. How many soldiers did he 
                    have laying in wait at Wuchang?

                                  JINGIM
                    Not too many for a Mongol army. If 
                    only our reinforcements showed up.

                                  ARIQ
                    Jingim. You did not attack without

                    -- You almost got me killed! My 
                    General Aruka is dead!

      Jingim steadies himself, the Confucian and the Barbarian at 
      war inside him. Ariq remains composed.

                                  ARIQ
                    The spring rains cut off passage of 
                    the Blue Horde. East of Volga. I 
                    did not have enough horses to make 
                    the journey.

                                  JINGIM
                    You could have sent a messenger.

                    I did. My best rider -- Duwa. 

      As they stroll the circumference, Ariq reaches into a 
      basket... and lifts a human head; a distinctly Mongolian face 
      frozen in death. Jingim almost retches.

                                  ARIQ (CONT D)
                    He never made it. They captured him 
                    one hundred miles outside of 
                    Wuchang. Tied his head to his 
                    horse, let it run home. Right to 
                    his yurt... and his children.

      He resentfully returns the gruesome head to the basket.




      Ariq and Jingim reach the horse-hide crocks of kumis. Ariq 
      pours graciously. Looks his nephew in the eye.

      Kublai stops in the long portico. Jingim stops, too. Marco 
      hesitates, seemingly weighing what he can say and what he 
      can t.

                    than enough to take any city... 

      Jingim stares at Marco, watches the Latin make his fateful 
      decision.

                    My son Jingim just stated before 
                    you that they are ready to ride 
                    into battle.

                          (too late to retreat)
                    ...but a war closer to home.  

      Kublai digests this, deeply troubled. Jingim seethes --

                    Do you accuse my uncle, the Khan s

                    see, as I saw it. 

      Chillingly quiet. Jingim lays his hand on the hilt of his 
      sword. The Khan steadies him, says slowly --

                    I will send a night rider to verify

      A COURT EUNUCH, draped in jewels, appears in the portico.

      Kublai, distracted by dark rumination, walks off. Jingim 
      stands alone with Marco. Stares.

      Jingim turns on his heel and goes.  

      OFF Marco, pale and reeling --




      Urgently, Marco digs under his bedding, grabs two horse-hide 
      canteens. He shoves them into leather saddle bags. He 
      uncovers the stolen sword, rusted at the hilt.

      He goes to the lute-shaped window.

      Chancellor Jia Sidao enters, regards the grieving Empress. It 
      is clear that the Emperor has finally expired.

                    Emperor, Zhao Xian.

      The Chancellor looks over at the five year-old boy playing on 
      the floor. It s the same precocious child that once tried to 
      abuse his crickets.

      It takes everything the Chancellor has to dip his chin 
      slightly to the heir.

                    With sad news, Empress, there also 
                    comes good. The devil Kublai has 
                    withdrawn his troops.

      The old woman gazes up, surprised, tears in her cataracts, 
      but hopeful.

                    I fear you do count on it, Sidao.  
                    I fear you thirst for it. 

      She turns away. Sidao again bows to the child. The child 
      throws some pottery shards at the floor, fascinated by how 
      they break.




      Mei Lin sits on the edge of her bed, embracing her young 
      daughter. She sings a Chinese children s song, soothes the 
      girl softly. Together they mourn the Emperor.

      Then her door opens. THREE SONG SOLDIERS enter. Filthy, 
      sleeveless, and baring Song Dynasty tattoos. They just stand 
      there, looking Mei Lin over. The concubine gently whispers in 
      her daughter s ear. The girl grabs a doll and leaves. When 
      she s gone, a Soldier closes the door.

      The Soldiers must have heard differently from the Chancellor; 
      they smirk and begin to unfasten their sword belts, lean 
      their halberds in the corners. One of them gestures to her 
      roughly with a wing sword.

      Cornered, Mei Lin wisely considers her choices. She rises 
      slowly, elegantly. She stands before them in flickering 
      candle light... and lets her silk robe slip off one shoulder. 
      She unbelts her robe and lets it open, revealing a view that 
      excites the hungry warriors.

      Slowly she turns, playing the candle light, reaches up to 
      undo her bun.

      Across the room, dead-center into the swordsman s throat.

      Mei Lin whirls in silk, undulates, and kicks a Second Soldier 
      brutally against the wall. As she re-chambers, she toe-flips 
      a sword up from the floor into her left hand -- even as she 
      pirouettes -- and impales the Third Soldier. Effortlessly.

      The Second Soldier recovers, grabs his bladed halberd. But 
      Mei Lin side-steps and cuts his windpipe with the wing sword. 
      His eyes stare at her in utter shock...

      With all three dead, the quarters resume a hypnotic candle-
      flicker. Mei Lin belts her robe. MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/1280.

      As Marco returns to the saddle bags to help Sanga haul, he 
      notes: Sanga lays a hand on the linen payment... then covers 
      it covertly with a flap of leather. He then hands Marco a 
      bundle of paper notes to bring to the accounting table.

      Ahmad scans the ledger, reviews the deposits, then looks

                    Jurchens, at any time, pay their

                    sheets of paper worth ten bezants

                    forgot.

                                  AHMAD

      Marco destroys his quarters, turning things over. He punches 
      the mahogany wall, knocks over his calligraphy board. Then he 
      looks at his self-ransacked belongings and spots something; 
      the silver cross given to him by his father.

      He sits on his bed, picks up the cross. Closes it in a fist. 
      Mourning Sanga; praying; soul searching. The eerie drone of 
      MONGOLIAN THROAT SINGING rises up...




      The golden eagle is brought before Ariq who sits in a fur-
      draped throne. It is the same eagle that he gifted to his big 
      brother; he stares confused for a second.

      Ariq unties the small leather pouch laced into the eagle s 
      anklet. He opens it and spills out: An iron arrow head, 
      broken off from the bamboo shaft.

      Ariq studies it for a moment, then closes it in his fist. He 
      makes a guttural breath sound. Whatever it means is animal...




      Kublai and Ariq sit on the ground, facing each other. A fire 
      warms the space nearby. Kublai rattles his fist and tosses 
      several little bones to the ground. It is the traditional 
      Mongolian game of  horses  played with the ankle bones of a 
      sheep.

                                  ARIQ
                    Do you remember, Older Brother, the 
                    summer you chased a deer for six 
                    days. You were gone so long our 
                    mother thought the wolves got you.
