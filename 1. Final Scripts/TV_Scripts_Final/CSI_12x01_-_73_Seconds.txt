                                "73 Seconds" 

                                      TEASER

  FADE IN:


1EXT. LAS VEGAS SHOTS - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT1

    A PLANE LANDS at McCarran.  TOURISTS flood the Strip.


2EXT. PALERMO/MEDITERRANEAN TRAM (MOVING) - NIGHT2

  The TRAM moves across the elevated tracks running parallel
  to Las Vegas Boulevard, enters the Palermo station.


3INT. TRAM TRACKS/PLATFORM - NIGHT3

  FRONT CAR POV: The headlight pierces the darkness.  Then the
  tram moves into light as it arrives.  PASSENGERS await.


4INT. PALERMO PLATFORM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)4

  We see the PASSENGERS waiting in front of TRAM-CAR 2. 

  We'll know who they are shortly, for now it's just: A MOM
    waiting for her 6-year-old SON to catch up (the boy has a
  toy in a bag).  A tense 50-something MAN in a COWBOY HAT.  A
    beautiful ASIAN WOMAN in a distinctive red dress.  A SLICKED
    HAIRED GRIFTER-TYPE with a Mai Tai.  A tired SECURITY GUARD.  

  We CUT BACK to the SIX YEAR OLD BOY.  MOVE IN on his Secret
  Seal baseball cap, then PULL BACK to REVEAL --*

                                                                      MATCH CUT TO:


5OMITTED5


6EXT. FREMONT AVENUE - EARLIER TODAY - DAY (MONTAGE)6

  -- The BOY and MOM now on Fremont.  This is precocious EMMETT
  DRAKE and his mom NANCY DRAKE (30's, Midwestern).  Emmett*
    rushes over to a VENDOR, dressed as a showgirl selling
    everything under the sun, including baseball caps.  

                                    EMMETT DRAKE*
                        (re: one ballcap)
                  Look, Mom.  Secret Seal!*


                                                              (CONTINUED)  CSI: "73 Seconds" - 1201 - WHITE - 7/19/112.

6CONTINUED:6

                                  NANCY DRAKE*
                  Who's Secret Seal?*

                                    EMMETT DRAKE*
                  He's a seal but he knows everyone's*
                  secrets.  *

                                  NANCY DRAKE*
                How much?

  Nancy smiles, sets down her pink lemonade cup as she digs
  into her purse for money.  We MOVE OVER her cup, MOVE INTO
  the bright pink...  

                                                                      MATCH CUT TO:


7EXT. FIRING RANGE - DAY (MONTAGE)7

  ... then PULL BACK off the pink TO REVEAL we're looking at a
  pink Taurus .32 auto gun.  WIDER, we see it's in the hands
  of a tank-topped HOT YOUNG WOMAN.  

  Next over is BOB MUNDLER (40's, our man in the COWBOY HAT).*
  He blasts a 9mm Beretta.  Intense, focused and a little odd. 
    Perhaps Mundler's thinking about killing a man.  He smiles.*


8VFX SHOT - SUPER SLO-MO ON CASINGS (MONTAGE)8

    discharging from the Beretta into the air.  The last casing*
  flips end over end in a graceful arc, moving TOWARD CAMERA*
  until it fills the screen... *

                                                                      TRANSITION TO:*


9INT. CLUB - BACK ROOM - NIGHT (MONTAGE)9

  WISPS OF SMOKE rising from a small fog machine.  WIDER, we
  see our beautiful Asian woman who was in the red dress. 
  She's lying on a bed in a satin robe, posing.  POP! 
    Professional key lights flash.  

                                    PHOTOGRAPHER (V.O.)
                Are you ready for Claude?

                                  RED DRESS
                  Always.

  She smiles enigmatically.  We SNAP TO the bright light...


10OMITTED10  CSI: "73 Seconds" - 1201 - WHITE - 7/19/113.


11INT. GOLDEN NUGGET CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT (MONTAGE)11*

  ... PULL OUT of bright NEON CASINO LIGHTS.  We MOVE HIGH
  OVER the CROWDS until WE FIND our SLICK HAIRED GRIFTER. 
  He's at the blackjack table.  On his cell.

                                  SLICK
                        (into cell)
                  'Course I'm still in L.A... I'm at
                  a Dodger's game.  Chillax.  I'll
                pay him Monday...  Next Monday. 

  Slick CLICKS OFF, looks at his face-down Queen.  Ten $100
  chips stacked near it.  VETERAN DEALER MARGE (57) has a face
  up nine.  Very tense.  Marge deals.

                                  SLICK
                  I may look like a whale, Marge, but
                my heart beats guppy.  I need this.  

  Slick draws a ten, Marge a King.  Slick wins a grand!  SUPER
    SLO-MO on Slick as he raises his arms in victory, hugs the
  OTHER PLAYERS at the table, kisses a blushing 75-year-old
  WOMAN on the cheek. *

                                                                                CUT TO:*


12INT. PALERMO - VIDEO POKER AREA - NIGHT (MONTAGE)12*

  We're now with an angry, drunk, MIDDLE-AGED MAN who's just*
  lost big-time.  He starts SCREAMING at a GUY next to him. 
  The Guy shoves the Middle Aged Man.  Fists are about to fly --

  -- until A.J. GUST (27, our big security guard) steps between. 

                                  A.J. GUST
                  Don't lose twice, guys.

  The Men back away.  CLOSE ON Gust as he watches --


13INT. TRAM - PALERMO PLATFORM - NIGHT13

  -- the tram doors OPEN in front of him.  Present time now.

  From the POV INSIDE TRAM-CAR 2 (which is spotless) WE SEE
  A.J. Gust, Nancy and Emmett Drake, Bob Mundler, Red Dress*
  and Slick walk on board.

  We quickly CUT BEHIND THEM as they board (as well as ND
    PASSENGERS into TRAM-CARS 1).  The platform empties, then --

  -- a last PASSENGER hurries toward Tram-Car 2.  We only see
  his back, a Las Vegas 51 jacket.  This is TOM FINNERTY (30's). *
  Tom makes it in just as the doors shut. *  CSI: "73 Seconds" - 1201 - WHITE - 7/19/114.


14EXT. PALERMO/MEDITERRANEAN TRAM - MOVING - NIGHT14

  -- the Tram moves from the Palermo to the Mediterranean.


15INT. TRAM - MEDITERRANEAN PLATFORM - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)15

  The Tram comes to a stop.  CAMERA GLIDES ALONG Tram-Car 1
  where passengers exit - a small WEDDING PARTY, ND TOURISTS
  and Keno player ALLEN KRICK (24) whom we'll meet later. *

  We SUPER SLOW-MO as Red Dress comes into frame.  She pushes
    through the crowd.  Terrified.  BLOOD SPATTER on her face.  

  -- REGULAR SPEED, We CONTINUE MOVING ACROSS as horrified
    Tram-car 2 Passengers run like hell from something.  Slick
  takes a last look back and runs.

                                                                        SNAP ZOOM TO:


16INT. TRAM-CAR 2 - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)16

  -- FIND our security guard, A.J. Gust.  He sits in a daze on
  the floor, a .357 in his hand.  Patch of blood at his shoulder.  

  We MOVE OVER the floor, SEE: BLOOD, a trail of STICKY CLEAR
  GOOP, a spilled MAI TAI, SAND and plastic GLASS FRAGMENTS.  

  ON A VIDEO SCREEN: a VEGAS PROMO LOOP finishes.  CARROT TOP*
    smiles brightly into camera.*

                                    CARROT TOP (ON VIDEO)*
                ... so go and discover the wonders
                of the Mediterranean!

  FIND Tom Finnerty, our late arrival in the 51's jacket, lying*
  in a pool of blood.  Dead.  Above Tom, a tram safety glass*
    window is spider-webbed from a gunshot.

  SNAP PAST HIM, FIND Bob Mundler, our gun range cowboy.  Down*
  and dead.  Gaping chest wound.  His Beretta a few feet away.

                                    CARROT TOP (ON VIDEO)*
                And remember, in Vegas.  Anything
                can happen!

  We ZIP AROUND to reveal Midwestern Mom Nancy Drake. On her*
  side, she looks dead.  Cheek snug to the floor. RED ANTS
  crawl over her face.

    Finally, we find the only uninjured passenger left on the
  tram.  Emmett Drake.  He's with his Mom, shaking*
    uncontrollably in his sneakers.  

  OFF Emmett.

                                                                    WHITE FLASH TO:  CSI: "73 Seconds" - 1201 - WHITE - 7/19/115.


17INT. TRAM - MEDITERRANEAN PLATFORM - NIGHT (LATER)17

    [NOTE: WE PICK UP FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE EVENTS OF THE FINALE. *
  OUR TEAM HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE NEW CSI SUPERVISOR FOR*
  THREE WEEKS, ALL EXCEPT FOR NICK, WHO'S BEEN AWAY AT A*
    TRAINING SESSION]*

    POLICE.  PARAMEDICS.  Full-blown triage and crime scene.   
  We FOLLOW NICK into the controlled chaos.  GREG passes Nick
  as E.M.T.'s roll out an oxygen-masked Nancy Drake.  *

                                  GREG
                  Next time, I'm in Hawaii when we're
                  breaking in a new supervisor.  Toes
                in the sand, drink in my hand.  I
                  won't be looking at bugs.

    CATHERINE approaches, walks with Nick.

                                    CATHERINE
                  Aloha, stranger.  Good training
                  session?

                                  NICK
                  Three weeks of sand, surf and
                  scarabs.

                                    CATHERINE
                  Hope you got some sleep.  It's
                  looking like a serious Tower-Caper.

                                  NICK
                  Sheriff or Mayor's tower?

                                    CATHERINE
                  Both.

                                  NICK
                  Bring it on.

                                    CATHERINE
                  Shootout at the L.V. corral.  Two
                  dead.  Three injured.  

  They reach Tram-Car 2.  Nick looks inside, sees SARA taking
    pictures at the forward end.  And THREE BODIES.  Legs from
  an apparent third VIC protrude from under a row of seats.  

                                  NICK
                  Thought you said two dead?

    Catherine eyes the third body, looks back at Nick, says
    nothing.  She just smiles, walks away.  Sara approaches.

                                  NICK

                  Welcome back.

  She smirks, pats him on the shoulder, exits.  Nick looks
  back, sees Greg eyeing him.  What the hell's going on?  

  Nick moves into the tram.  Eyes focused on...

    LEGS... our third body.  As Nick rounds the row of seats...
  his eyes now land on... 

    A clearly uninjured, very alive person staring up at the
    ceiling, as if in meditation.  This is D.B. FITCH (50'S). *

                                    FITCH*
                You must be Stokes.

                                  NICK
                  You're contaminating the scene.

  Fitch swivels his head toward Nick.*

                                    FITCH*
                  I already cleared this area. 

  BRASS enters, holds an iPad.  He eyes Fitch on the floor -*
  seen this before.  Moves on.

                  Little help?

  Nick looks over.  An awkward beat, then... extends his hand*
  to help Fitch up.*

                                    FITCH*
                  Thanks.  Fitch.  New Guy. *

    Although he's a renowned expert witness and experienced former*
  crime lab director, Fitch is a man who still maintains a*
  sense of wonder about everything.  

  Fitch and Nick look at the screen, see a WIDE ANGLE*
    SURVEILLANCE STILL of the Palermo platform - happy people
  climb on board.

                                  BRASS
                  Party at the Palermo --

  Brass swipes to a Mediterranean SURVEILLANCE STILL -- scared
    shitless people disembark.

18INT. TRAM-CAR 2 - NIGHT18

  CLOSE ON a red ant, its antennae twitching.  

                                  NICK (V.O.)
                  What brings you here, buddy?

  RACK FOCUS WIDE as Nick forceps the ant into a specimen jar. 
  Fitch is next to him, gloved, shining a maglite under the*
    seats.  Beyond them DAVID PHILLIPS inspects Mundler's body.*

                                    FITCH*
                  E.M.T. said the wounded mom's face
                was covered in ants.  

  Fitch sees the cup, lifts it up, sniffs.*

                  They perform well with people
                  watching.  Perfect for --

  Fitch has found a tiny piece of snapped, cheap plastic under*
    a seat.  Holds it up.  It's molded like a barn.

                  Very little blood.  Game over in
                  seconds.  He tested positive for
                  G.S.R. on his right hand.  No ID.

                  Beretta must be the Cowboy's.

  Nick picks up the Beretta, pops the remaining bullet, clicks
  out the magazine, inspects it.

                                  NICK
                Two shots.

                One gunshot wound.  Entered his

                  Crossfire hit maybe.  Bled out.  

  Fitch sees a wallet inside Tom's front jacket pocket. *

                Can I check him?*

    Phillips nods, then Fitch grabs the wallet, flips it open.*

                New York.  No cash.  Credit cards

  Nick tweezes a piece of glass.  As he raises it, the SLIMY
  GOOP stretches with it, then slops back to the floor.

                                  NICK
                  What the hell is this?  Never seen
                so many fluids at a scene.  It's
                  like the tram puked.

  Nick looks over to Fitch who's staring at the ceiling.*

                                    FITCH*
                  Paint pattern on that duct is

                  This looks like a ricochet.

  Fitch points at a small indent in the ceiling.  *

                                  NICK
                  Maybe.

                                    FITCH*
                  Just a thought.

    A little tension between these two.  Fitch's cell RINGS.  As*
  Fitch answers, Nick spots Emmett's "SECRET SEAL" CAP under a*
  seat, grabs it.

                  I didn't hear anything.  I was in

                No.  I'd just lost my rent on Keno. 
                  I was in a daze.  Heard people died?

                He was 'van-schooled'.  It's weird. *
                The whole thing is weird.*
                        (as if to prove it)*
                  Yesterday, he put on a murder vic's
                  watch, kept asking me for the time. *
                So I'm like, "Hey Fitch, what time*
                is it?"  Then he'd just look at the
                  watch and not say anything.  Over
                and over.

                  Isn't the evidence supposed to do*

                  Dude, his evidence caught the Gig*

                  Coroner said he found a puncture

                          (looking around)
                So where's the blood?

                                  SARA
                  Could be a knife and dump.

  Sara gently pulls open the unbuttoned shirt. It falls away,
    revealing - the severely wrinkled torso of a 90-year-old
  man.  Greg and Sara are momentarily speechless.  Then --

                  Thanks for coming in.  E.R. Doc
                  looks like he's about twelve.  I
                got questions about the mom's wounds.

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                My pleasure.  Somebody alive will
                be a nice change.

  Just then, Fitch comes around a corner.  He holds an open*
  white deli bag, stares into it.  He doesn't look up.

  They watch him go, both a little puzzled.

                                  BRASS
                  Hear anything from Ray?*

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  Gloria's doing well so he's doing
                  well.  Baltimore's proven to be a
                  potent medicinal for both of them. 

                                  BRASS
                  Since when is getting railroaded by

                  Ray's back with the woman he loves. 
                  A second chance.  I think killing
                  Haskell may've saved his life. 


31INT. DESERT PALM HOSPITAL - EMMETT DRAKE'S ROOM - DAY31*

    Emmett sits on the edge of a bed, still in shock.  Nick's on
    a knee, at Emmett's eye level.  Fitch leans against a wall. *
    Deli-bag near him on the floor.  A young FEMALE COP nearby. 
  Nick hands Emmett his Secret Seal cap.*

                                  NICK
                  I think this is yours.  You can
                  show it to your mom when she wakes
                up, okay?  
                        (beat)
                  Secret Seal.  I love that show. *
                  Who's your favorite character?

  No reply or reach for the cap.  Nick sets it on the bed.

                                  NICK
                  I gotta look at your shoes for a

                  I love these things.

  Fitch pretends to remove a tennis ball, holds it in his hand. *
  He tosses it up, follows the ball with his eyes, then holds
  out the bag to catch it.  [NOTE: The bag is held with two
    fingers on the inside, thumb on the outside, so one can snap
    fingers thus creating the catch sound.]  

  The ball lands in the bag, producing a loud POPPY THWAP when
  it hits the bottom.  Or so it looks. 

  Fitch tosses the ball up again.  THWAP!  Catches it.  He*
    throws it against the floor, watches it ricochet against the
  wall, then he stretches to catch it.  THWAP!  Got it.  If
  you didn't know better, you'd swear there was a real ball. *
  It's kind of magical.  Nick eyes Fitch, WTF?*

                                    FITCH*
                See if you can bounce one by me.  

  He tosses the ball to Nick.  Nick "catches" it.  On board.*

                                  NICK
                  Piece of cake.

  Nick tosses the ball.  Fitch follows the trajectory, and*
  makes a great catch.  Emmett perks up, can't help but stare
  at the grown-ups playing phantom catch.

                                    FITCH*
                  Emmett, coming your way.

  Fitch tosses the ball to Emmett.  Like an "AWAKENINGS" patient*
    jacked on L-DOPA, Emmett suddenly reaches up and catches the
    imaginary ball.  Breakthrough. 

  Nick can't help but smile.  Emmett pretends to look at the
    tennis ball.

                                    EMMETT DRAKE*
                  Where'd you get it?

                you tell me what you saw on the
                  tram?  It's okay if you can't
                  remember anything.

  Nick eyes a pole with a cowboy hat resting on it -- a green
    string at the window tracks back to COWBOY.

                One shot's a total miss, hits the
                  window...

    Another green string shows the other bullet's path -- through
    SECURITY GUARD's shoulder, then ricocheting from window
    ledge... to roof... to floor.

                                    HODGES
                  Tyrosinase is a component of ink,
                  which an octopus secretes as a
                  defense mechanism.

  Fitch clocks the dig, more amused than insulted.  Focused,*
  he hits his maglite.  Points it at the slime path.

  down to a BLOOD DROP on the tram door.  SNAP ZOOM TO:


74CSI SHOT - BLOOD DROP74

  Not an ordinary blood drop.  It's a drop with a "GHOST RING"
    (technical term not VFX).  The drop has partially dried,
    creating an outer ring of dried blood.  While the wet interior
  has smeared horizontally out of the "ring".

  Fitch peers over Nick's shoulder, looking at the BLOOD DROP.*

                  Means that blood drop had at least*
                  thirty seconds to start drying.

                  So... two blood events, not one. 


76CSI SHOT - FORMING OF A GHOST DROP76

    A DROP OF BLOOD lands on the tram door.  In TIME LAPSE, the
    OUTSIDE EDGES start to dry.  Finally, as the door slides*
  open, passing the RUBBER SEAL of the doorjamb, the liquid*
    center of the blood drop SMEARS -- out from the center,*
    leaving a ring.  Think a comet.

                at the start of the ride.*

  They both consider this for a moment, then --

                Tom was stabbed at the door. And*
                not by Jimmy because -- by all
                  accounts -- he was on the opposite
                  side of the tram.

  BG, Unis direct PASSENGERS to the other cars.

  Nick shoots Fitch a look, then hands a ten dollar bill to*

  Fitch looks around.  Sees the rest rooms down the way.*
