A series of traveling shots. A well-dressed, pompous-looking
individual (JOHN DASHWOOD, 35) is making an urgent journey
on horseback. He looks anxious.
Silence. Norland Park, a large country house built in the
early part of the eighteenth century, lies in the moonlit
parkland.
Outside the house sits a very well-to-do carriage. Behind it
waits another open carriage upon which servants are laying
trunks and boxes.
FANNY (V.O.)
'Help them?'
JOHN and FANNY are waiting as the OSTLERS make the final
adjustments to their carriage. The LANDLORD hovers, waiting
for a tip.
JOHN
A hundred pounds a year to their
mother while she lives. Would that
be more advisable? It is better than
parting with the fifteen hundred all
at once.
He displays some coins in his hand. FANNY removes one and
nods.
FANNY
But if she should live longer than
fifteen years we would be completely
taken in. People always live forever
when there is an annuity to be paid
them.
JOHN gives the coins to the LANDLORD.
ELINOR comes to the foot of a large tree from which a small
staircase issues.
ELINOR
Margaret, are you there? Please come
down. John and Fanny will be here
soon.
A pause. ELINOR is about to leave when a disembodied and
truculent young voice stops her.
MARGARET (V.O.)
Why are they coming to live at
Norland? They already have a house
in London.
ELINOR
Because houses go from father to
son, dearest not from father to
daughter. It is the law.
Silence. ELINOR tries another tack.
ELINOR
If you come inside, we could play
with your atlas.
MARGARET (V.O.)
It's not my atlas any more. It's
their atlas.
CLOSE on ELINOR as she ponders the truth of this statement.
JOHN and FANNY's carriage approaches Norland.
FANNY (V.O.)
They will be much more able to give
you something.
A very capable HORSEMAN (EDWARD FERRARS) canters up the gravel
drive.
CLOSE on his face as he gazes up at the elegant faade.
EDWARD and ELINOR are still talking as they walk arm in arm
in the late afternoon sun.
EDWARD
All I want--all I have ever wanted
is the quiet of a private life but
my mother is determined to see me
distinguished.
ELINOR
As?
EDWARD
She hardly knows. Any fine figure
will suit a great orator, a leading
politician, even a barrister would
serve, but only on the condition
that I drive my own barouche and
dine in the first circles.
His tone is light but there is an underlying bitterness to
it.
ELINOR
And what do you wish for?
EDWARD
I always preferred the church, but
that is not smart enough for my mother
she prefers the army, but that is a
great deal too smart for me.
ELINOR
Would you stay in London?
EDWARD
I hate London. No peace. A country
living is my ideal a small parish
where I might do some good, keep
chickens and give very short sermons.
EDWARD and ELINOR are on horseback. The atmosphere is
intimate, the quality of the conversation rooted now in their
affections.
ELINOR
You talk of feeling idle and useless
imagine how that is compounded when
one has no choice and no hope
whatsoever of any occupation.
EDWARD nods and smiles at the irony of it.
EDWARD
Our circumstances are therefore
precisely the same.
ELINOR
Except that you will inherit your
fortune.
He looks at her slightly shocked but enjoying her boldness.
ELINOR
We cannot even earn ours.
EDWARD
Perhaps Margaret is right.
ELINOR
Right?
EDWARD
Piracy is our only option.
They ride on in silence for a moment.
EDWARD
What is swabbing exactly?
ELINOR has come to say goodbye to her HORSE. She strokes the
soft face sadly. Then she senses someone and turns to find
EDWARD standing nearby.
EDWARD
Cannot you take him with you?
ELINOR
We cannot possibly afford him.
EDWARD
Perhaps he could make himself useful
in the kitchen?
ELINOR tries to smile. EDWARD looks at her for a long moment
and then comes closer.
EDWARD
Miss Dashwood--Elinor. I must talk
to you.
The use of her Christian name--and in such a loving tone--
stops ELINOR's breath altogether.
EDWARD
There is something of great importance
I need... to tell you--
He comes closer still. The HORSE breathes between them. ELINOR
is on fire with anticipation but EDWARD looks troubled and
has less the air of a suitor than he might.
EDWARD
--about--about my education.
ELINOR
(after a beat)
Your education?
EDWARD
Yes. It was less... successful than
it might have been.
EDWARD laughs nervously. ELINOR is completely bewildered.
EDWARD
It was conducted in Plymouth--oddly
enough.
ELINOR
Indeed?
EDWARD
Yes. Do you know it?
ELINOR
Plymouth?
EDWARD
Yes.
ELINOR
No.
EDWARD
Oh--well--I spent four years there--
at a school run by a--a Mr Pratt--
ELINOR
Pratt?
ELINOR is beginning to feel like a parrot.
EDWARD
Precisely--Mr Pratt--and there, I--
that is to say, he has a--
As EDWARD flounders, a familiar voice cuts through this
unexpected foray into his academic past.
FANNY
Edward! Edward!
They turn to find FANNY powering down upon them, waving a
letter. EDWARD steps back, glancing almost guiltily at ELINOR,
who is as confused as we are.
FANNY
I have been all over for you! You
are needed in London this instant!
EDWARD
Fanny, I am leaving this afternoon
as it is--
FANNY
No, no, that will not do. Family
affairs are in chaos owing to your
absence. Mother is quite adamant
that you should leave at once.
FANNY is determined. She obviously has no intention of leaving
him alone with ELINOR. EDWARD turns to ELINOR, frustration
in every muscle, his jaw set tight.
EDWARD
Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.
FANNY drags EDWARD off, leaving ELINOR to gaze sadly after
them.
The carriage rolls on.
MARGARET (V.O.)
Are we there yet?
In comparison to Norland, Barton Cottage has the air of a
damp shoebox. it sits low and bleak in the grey lonely
countryside.
From one side we can see the DASHWOODS' carriage drawing up
at the gate. From the other, a much grander vehicle, from
which loud whooping can be heard, is approaching.
As the exhausted DASHWOODS alight, they converge with a ruddy-
complexioned MAN in a redingote (SIR JOHN MIDDLETON) and a
rotund, equally roseate LADY (MRS JENNINGS) who have fallen
over each other in their haste to get out of their carriage.
MRS DASHWOOD
Sir John!
SIR JOHN clasps her hands and starts to help her up the path,
followed by ELINOR, MARIANNE and MARGARET, who is clearly
fascinated by his bouncy companion.
SIR JOHN
Dear ladies, dear ladies, upon my
word, here you are, here you are,
here you are!
MRS DASHWOOD
Sir John, your extraordinary kindness--
SIR JOHN
Oh, none of that, hush, please, none
of that, but here is my dear mamma-
in-law Mrs Jennings.
MRS JENNINGS
Was the journey tolerable, you poor
souls?
SIR JOHN
Why did you not come up to the Park
first and take your ease? We saw you
pass--Like many people who live rather
lonely lives together.
SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS talk incessantly, interrupt each
other all the time and never listen.
MRS JENNINGS
--but I would not wait for you to
come to us, I made John call for the
carriage--
SIR JOHN
She would not wait, you know.
MRS JENNINGS
--as we get so little company.
They reach the front door and BETSY's smiling welcome. In
the confusion of milling people and THOMAS carrying the
lighter luggage, MARIANNE contrives to slip into the house
alone. We follow her but hear the conversation continuing in
V.O. MARIANNE looks about the parlour, where a dismal fire
is smoking. She starts up the stairs, expressionless.
MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)
But I feel as if I know you already--
delightful creatures!
SIR JOHN (V.O.)
Delightful! And you know you are to
dine at Barton Park every day.
MRS DASHWOOD (V.O.)
Oh, but dear Sir John, we cannot--
SIR JOHN (V.O.)
Oh, no no no no no no no, I shall
not brook refusals. I am quite deaf
to 'em, you know--
MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)
--deaf--
MARIANNE enters a small bedroom. She sits on the bed. Then
she goes to the window and opens it. Voices float up.
SIR JOHN (V.O.)
But I insist!
ELINOR (V.O.)
Let us only settle in for a few days,
Sir John, and thank you--
SIR JOHN (V.O.)
Oh, no thankings, no, please, can't
bear 'em, embarrassing, you know--
MARIANNE closes the window and crosses the corridor to another
bed room--similarly stark. She sighs and turns back down the
stairs.
SIR JOHN (V.O.)
We will send game and fruit as a
matter of course--
MRS JENNINGS (V.O.)
--fruit and game--
SIR JOHN (V.O.)
--and the carriage is at your beck
and call--
MARIANNE joins the group, who are now in the parlour.
MRS JENNINGS
--call--and here is Miss Marianne!
SIR JOHN
Where did you disappear to?
MRS JENNINGS
I declare you are the loveliest girl
I ever set eyes on! Cannot you get
them married, Mrs Dashwood? You must
not leave it too long!
SIR JOHN
But, alas, there are no smart young
men hereabouts to woo them--
MRS JENNINGS
--not a beau for miles!
The strain of exhibiting joy and gratitude is beginning to
tell on MRS DASHWOOD who is sagging visibly.
SIR JOHN
Come, Mother, let us leave them in
peace.
MRS JENNINGS
But there is Colonel Brandon!
SIR JOHN is dragging her down the path.
SIR JOHN
Excellent fellow! We served in the
East India Regiment together.
MRS JENNINGS
Just wait till he sees you! If we
can persuade him out to meet you!
SIR JOHN
Reclusive individual. But you are
fatigued. I can see that you are
fatigued.
Now he is pushing her into the carriage.
MRS JENNINGS
Of course she is fatigued!
SIR JOHN
Come along, Mother, we really must
leave them to themselves.
MRS JENNINGS
You must get your maidservant to
make you up some camphor--it is the
best tonic for the staggers!
SIR JOHN
Send Thomas to us for the carriage
when you are ready!
They take off, waving wildly. MARGARET goes down the path to
watch them and turns back to her slightly stunned family.
MARGARET
I like them.
MRS DASHWOOD
(weakly)
What generosity.
ELINOR
Indeed. I am surprised they did not
offer us their clothing.
BETSY is pinning out laundry.
MARGARET tries to climb an impossible tree. Her petticoats
snag and tear.
Establishing shot of SIR JOHN's house--a very comfortable-
looking country seat with fine grounds.
SIR JOHN (V.O.)
Where can Brandon be, poor fellow? I
hope he has not lamed his horse.
A soldierly MAN of about forty (COLONEL BRANDON) is
dismounting from his horse. From within we hear MARIANNE's
song begin. His head snaps up to the windows. An expression
of pained surprise comes into his melancholy, brooding eyes.
In the background, SIR JOHN, ELINOR and MRS JENNINGS pack
the remains of a picnic into a basket. MRS DASHWOOD and
MARGARET examine a foxhole. In the foreground, MARIANNE is
cutting bulrushes for basketwork. Her knife is blunt and she
saws impatiently.
COLONEL BRANDON materialises at her side and wordlessly offers
her his hunting knife. Oddly nervous, MARIANNE takes it. She
turns back to the rushes and cuts them with ease. The
COLONEL's gaze follows her movements as if held by a magnet.
BRANDON strides along in hunting gear, a gun slung under one
arm, his dog trotting behind him with a duck clamped between
its jaws. The bulrushes catch his eye and he slows, then
stops. He stands for a moment deep in thought. Then he takes
his hunting knife, cuts one and walks off contemplatively.
An outdoor luncheon is in progress. COLONEL BRANDON is talking
to MRS DASHWOOD. Occasionally he looks over towards MARIANNE,
who is playing bilboquet with SIR JOHN and MARGARET. MRS
JENNINGS nudges ELINOR hard and gestures to BRANDON.
MRS JENNINGS
(stage whisper)
Besotted! Excellent match, for he is
rich and she is handsome.
ELINOR
How long have you known the Colonel?
MRS JENNINGS
Oh, Lord bless you, as long as ever
I have been here, and I came fifteen
years back. His estate at Delaford
is but four miles hence and he and
John are very thick. He has no wife
or children of his own, for--
MRS JENNINGS lowers her voice to a stentorian whisper.
MRS JENNINGS
--he has a tragic history. He loved
a girl once--twenty years ago now--a
ward to his family, but they were
not permitted to marry...
ELINOR is intrigued.
ELINOR
On what grounds?
MRS JENNINGS
Money. Eliza was poor. When the father
discovered their amour, she was flung
out of the house and he packed off
into the army. I believe he would
have done himself a harm if not for
John...
ELINOR
What became of the lady?
MRS JENNINGS
Oh, she was passed from man to man--
disappeared from all good society.
When Brandon got back from India he
searched for heaven knows how long,
only to find her dying in a poor
house. You have seen how it has
affected him. Once I thought my
daughter Charlotte might have cheered
him up, but she is much better off
where she is.
ELINOR is silent with amazement at this unexpected history.
MRS JENNINGS
Look at him now, though. So attentive.
I shall try an experiment on him.
ELINOR
Oh no, please, dear Mrs Jennings,
leave the poor Colonel alone.
MRS JENNINGS
No, no, it is just the thing--all
suitors need a little help, my dear
MRS JENNINGS winks at ELINOR and rubs her hands as though
about to perform a magic trick.
MRS JENNINGS
(trillingly)
Colonel Brandon!
BRANDON looks up.
MRS JENNINGS
We have not heard you play for us of
late!
COLONEL BRANDON
For the simple reason that you have
a far superior musician here.
He indicates MARIANNE, who smiles absently.
MRS JENNINGS
Perhaps you did not know, Miss
Marianne, that our dear Brandon shares
your passion for music and plays the
piano forte very well.
MARIANNE looks at BRANDON in some surprise.
MRS JENNINGS
Play us a duet!
BRANDON looks at MRS JENNINGS warningly but she ignores him.
MRS JENNINGS
I'll trow you know quite as many
melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne!
Her tone is so knowing that MARIANNE frowns uncomfortably.
MRS JENNINGS
Come! Let us see you both side by
side!
MARIANNE rises impatiently.
MARIANNE
I do not know any duets. Forgive me,
Colonel.
She moves away. MRS JENNINGS chuckles.
MARIANNE walks very briskly, dragging an unwilling MARGARET
behind her.
It has started to rain. Mists are gathering around the two
figures walking against the wind.
MARIANNE
Is there any felicity in the world
superior to this?
MARGARET
I told you it would rain.
MARIANNE
Look! There is some blue sky! Let us
chase it!
MARGARET
I'm not supposed to run.
MARIANNE runs off down the hill into the heart of the mist.
MARGARET stumbles after her, grumbling. We follow MARIANNE
in her headlong descent and suddenly, dramatically, she trips
and sprawls to the ground, letting out a sharp cry of pain.
MARGARET
Marianne!
MARIANNE
Help me!
She tries to get up, but the pain in her ankle is too great.
She sinks back to the ground. MARGARET is very alarmed.
MARIANNE
Margaret, run home and fetch help.
The mists have thickened. They can no longer see where they
are. Despite her rising fear, MARGARET squares her shoulders
bravely and tries to sense the direction.
MARGARET
I think it is this way. I will run
as fast as I can, Marianne.
She dashes off. As she goes into the mist we hear the thunder
of hooves.
CU Margaret's terrified expression. They seem to be coming
from all around. She wheels and turns and then--Crash! Through
the mist breaks a huge white horse. Astride sits an Adonis
in hunting gear. MARGARET squeals. The horse rears. Its rider
controls it and slides off. He rushes to MARIANNE's side.
THE STRANGER
Are you hurt?
MARIANNE
(transfixed)
Only my ankle.
THE STRANGER
May I have your permission to--
He indicates her leg. Decorous, perhaps faintly impish.
THE STRANGER
--ascertain if there are any breaks?
MARIANNE nods speechlessly. With great delicacy, he feels
her ankle. MARGARET's eyes are out on chapel-hooks. MARIANNE
almost swoons with embarrassment and excitement mixed.
THE STRANGER
It is not broken. Now, can you put
your arm about my neck?
MARIANNE does not need any encouragement. He lifts her
effortlessly and calls to his horse: 'Bedivere!' It trots
obediently forward. The STRANGER smiles down at MARIANNE.
THE STRANGER
Allow me to escort you home.
MRS DASHWOOD calls out after him.
MRS DASHWOOD
Please tell us to whom we are so
much obliged?
The STRANGER mounts Bedivere and turns to her.
THE STRANGER
John Willoughby of Allenham--your
servant, ma'am!
And he gallops off into the mist--we almost expect Bedivere
to sprout wings. CLOSE on MRS DASHWOOD's excited expression.
The rain has cleared. SIR JOHN's horse munches grass
contentedly by the side of the road.
SIR JOHN (V.O.)
Mr Willoughby is well worth catching,
Miss Dashwood--Miss Marianne must
not expect to have all the men to
herself!
WILLOUGHBY is shaking hands with COLONEL BRANDON and SIR
JOHN.
WILLOUGHBY
How do you do, Colonel?
SIR JOHN
How does he do? How do you do, more
like. Go on in, they're waiting for
you!
BRANDON looks at WILLOUGHBY for a moment. He bows. WILLOUGHBY
bows. Then BRANDON and SIR JOHN exit.
WILLOUGHBY is leaving. He has a flower from MARIANNE's bunch
in his buttonhole and is on his horse, looking about as virile
as his horse. Everyone has come out to say goodbye, MARIANNE
supported by ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD.
WILLOUGHBY
Till tomorrow! And my pocket sonnets
are yours, Miss Marianne! A talisman
against further injury!
MARIANNE
Goodbye! Thank you!
He gallops off. They all wave. MARGARET follows him down the
road for a while.
ELINOR
Good work, Marianne! You have covered
all forms of poetry; another meeting
will ascertain his views on nature
and romantic attachments and then
you will have nothing left to talk
about and the acquaintanceship will
be over.
MARIANNE
I suppose I have erred against
decorum. I should have been dull and
spiritless and talked only of the
weather, or the state of the roads.
ELINOR
No, but Mr Willoughby can be in no
doubt of your enthusiasm for him.
MARIANNE
Why should he doubt it? Why should I
hide my regard?
ELINOR
No particular reason, Marianne, only
that we know so little of him--
MARIANNE
But time alone does not determine
intimacy. Seven years would be
insufficient to make some people
acquainted with each other and seven
days are more than enough for others.
ELINOR
Or seven hours in this case.
MARIANNE
I feel I know Mr Willoughby well
already. If I had weaker, more shallow
feelings perhaps I could conceal
them, as you do--
Then she realises what she's said.
MRS DASHWOOD
Marianne, that is not fair--
MARIANNE
I am sorry, Elinor, I did not mean
ELINOR
I know. Do not trouble yourself,
Marianne.
ELINOR turns back into the house.
MARIANNE
I do not understand her, Mamma. Why
does she never mention Edward? I
have never even seen her cry about
him, or about Norland.
MRS DASHWOOD
Nor I. But Elinor is not like you or
I, dear. She does not like to be
swayed by her emotions.
MRS JENNINGS is talking to the elderly CURATE. Other
PARISHIONERS exit the church as WILLOUGHBY's curricle (the
eighteenth-century equivalent of a sports car) goes flying
by. MARIANNE sits by his side, the picture of happiness. MRS
JENNINGS nudges the CURATE and whispers. The PARISHIONERS
stare after them and comment to each other.
MARIANNE and ELINOR are coming down the path together.
MARIANNE is dressed to go out. The argument has evidently
started indoors and is being continued here.
MARIANNE
If there was any true impropriety in
my behaviour, I should be sensible
of it, Elinor--
ELINOR
But as it has already exposed you to
some very impertinent remarks, do
you not begin to doubt your own
discretion?
MARIANNE
If the impertinent remarks of such
as Mrs Jennings are proof of
impropriety, then we are all offending
every moment of our lives--
The conversation is halted by the arrival of COLONEL BRANDON
on horseback.
COLONEL BRANDON
(dismounting)
Miss Dashwood! Miss Marianne!
ELINOR
Good morning, Colonel!
COLONEL BRANDON
I come to issue an invitation. A
picnic on my estate at Delaford--if
you would care to join us on Thursday
next. Mrs Jennings's daughter and
her husband are traveling up
especially.
ELINOR
Thank you, Colonel, we shall be
delighted.
At that moment, WILLOUGHBY's curricle hoves into view and
MARIANNE's face lights up.
COLONEL BRANDON
(to Marianne)
I will of course be including Mr
Willoughby in the party.
Even MARIANNE is a little embarrassed and recollects her
manners. She smiles kindly at BRANDON.
MARIANNE
I should be delighted to join you,
Colonel!
The COLONEL helps her into the curricle, exchanging nods
with WILLOUGHBY, who is regarding him with some suspicion.
WILLOUGHBY
Good morning, Miss Dashwood; good
morning, Colonel.
MARIANNE
The Colonel has invited us to
Delaford, Willoughby!
WILLOUGHBY
Excellent. I understand you have a
particularly fine pianoforte, Colonel.
The undercurrents of this conversation are decidedly tense.
COLONEL BRANDON
A Broadwood Grand.
MARIANNE
A Broadwood Grand! Then I shall really
be able to play for you!
WILLOUGHBY
We shall look forward to it!
MARIANNE smiles her perfect happiness at him and he whips up
the horses. They drive off, waving their farewells.
BRANDON looks after them for a silent moment, and then
collects himself and turns to ELINOR, who is less than
satisfied with their behaviour.
COLONEL BRANDON
Your sister seems very happy.
ELINOR
Yes. Marianne does not approve of
hiding her emotions. In fact, her
romantic prejudices have the
unfortunate tendency to set propriety
at naught.
COLONEL BRANDON
She is wholly unspoilt.
ELINOR
Rather too unspoilt, in my view. The
sooner she becomes acquainted with
the ways of the world, the better.
COLONEL BRANDON looks at her sharply and then speaks very
deliberately, as though controlling some powerful emotion.
COLONEL BRANDON
I knew a lady like your sister--the
same impulsive sweetness of temper--
who was forced into, as you put it,
a better acquaintance with the world.
The result was only ruination and
despair.
He stops, and briskly remounts his horse.
COLONEL BRANDON
Do not desire it, Miss Dashwood.
People and carriages fill the drive, the sun shines and the
atmosphere is pleasantly expectant. SIR JOHN is organising
the provision of blankets and parasols and COLONEL BRANDON
is busy furnishing the DRIVERS with their routes. There are
three new faces a pretty, blowsy WOMAN (CHARLOTTE PALMER), a
stony-faced MAN (MR PALMER) and an exceedingly good-looking
GIRL (LUCY STEELE), who are standing with ELINOR, MARIANNE,
MARGARET, MRS JENNINGS and MRS DASHWOOD.
MARIANNE is standing slightly apart, looking out along the
road, impatient for WILLOUGHBY.
MRS JENNINGS
Imagine my surprise, Mrs Dashwood,
when Charlotte and her lord and master
appeared with our cousin Lucy! The
last person I expected to see! 'Where
did you pop out from, Miss?' says I.
I was never so surprised to see anyone
in all my life!
LUCY STEELE smiles shyly and looks at the ground. MRS JENNINGS
continues sotto voce to MRS DASHWOOD.
MRS JENNINGS
She probably came on purpose to share
the fun, for there are no funds for
such luxuries at home, poor thing.
LUCY
I had not seen you for so long, dear
Mrs Jennings, I could not resist the
opportunity.
CHARLOTTE
Oh, you sly thing! It was the Misses
Dashwood she wanted to see, not
Delaford, Mamma! I have heard nothing
but 'Miss Dashwood this, Miss Dashwood
that' for I don't know how long! And
what do you think of them now you do
see them, Lucy? My mother has talked
of nothing else in her letters since
you came to Barton, Mrs Dashwood. Mr
Palmer--are they not the very
creatures she describes?
MR PALMER regards his wife with a less than enchanted
expression.
MR PALMER
Nothing like.
CHARLOTTE
(laughing gaily)
Why, Mr Palmer! Do you know you are
quite rude today? He is to be an MP,
you know, Mrs Dashwood, and it is
very fatiguing for him for he is
forced to make everybody like him--
he says it is quite shocking--
MRS PALMER
I never said anything so irrational.
Don't palm all your abuses of the
language upon me.
MRS JENNINGS
(to Mrs Dashwood)
Mr Palmer is so droll--he is always
out of humour.
MR PALMER does indeed have the air of a man under siege.
WILLOUGH BY suddenly appears in his curricle. MARIANNE waves
to him with a radiant smile. MRS JENNINGS nudges CHARLOTTE
and points to MARIANNE.
MRS JENNINGS
Here he is! Now you shall see,
Charlotte.
WILLOUGHBY drives up as close to MARIANNE as possible, making
her laugh.
MRS JENNINGS
How now, Mr Willoughby! You must
greet my daughter Charlotte, and Mr
Palmer--
WILLOUGHBY
How do you do?
MRS JENNINGS
And my little cousin, Miss Lucy
Steele.
WILLOUGHBY
Welcome to our party, Miss Steele!
LUCY bobs demurely. WILLOUGHBY inclines his head politely,
leaps from the curricle and hands MARIANNE in. MRS JENNINGS
coos and chuckles at them. CHARLOTTE nudges ELINOR.
CHARLOTTE
I know Mr Willoughby extremely well--
not that I ever spoke to him but I
have seen him forever in town. Your
sister is monstrous lucky to get
him. Mamma says Colonel Brandon is
in love with her as well, which is a
very great compliment for he hardly
ever falls in love with anyone.
ELINOR smiles politely. WILLOUGHBY moves the curricle out to
the front of the drive. CHARLOTTE points after them and laughs
with MRS JENNINGS. LUCY edges up beside ELINOR.
LUCY
May I beg a seat beside you, Miss
Dashwood? I have so longed to make
your better acquaintance! I have
heard nothing but the highest praise
for you.
ELINOR is relieved to change the subject.
ELINOR
I would be delighted. But Sir John
and Mrs Jennings are too excessive
in their compliments. I am sure to
disappoint.
LUCY
No, for it was from quite another
source that I heard you praised and
one not at all inclined to
exaggeration.
LUCY speaks in a knowing, confidential undertone, as though
not wanting anyone else to hear. At that moment a HORSEMAN
thunders up the drive towards them. Everyone turns to face
the new arrival.
SIR JOHN
What can this be?
It is a MESSENGER who has obviously had a long, hard ride.
He asks for COLONEL BRANDON and hands him a letter, which
BRANDON tears open. MRS JENNINGS is puce with suppressed
curiosity.
COLONEL BRANDON
My horse! Quickly!
SIR JOHN
What is the matter, Brandon?
COLONEL BRANDON
I must away to London.
SIR JOHN
No! Impossible!
Everyone gathers round BRANDON, who is, naturally, mortified.
A SERVANT brings up the COLONEL's horse.
COLONEL BRANDON
Imperative.
There is a murmur of disappointment from the party. SIR JOHN
is embarrassed and protests again.
SIR JOHN
But Brandon, we are all assembled.
We cannot picnic at Delaford without
our host! Go up to town tomorrow.
WILLOUGHBY
Or wait till we return and start
then--you would not be six hours
later.
COLONEL BRANDON
I cannot afford to lose one minute.
As he speaks, he is mounting his horse. His grave urgency
silences all protest and he gallops off, leaving everyone
stunned and, of course, deeply curious. Then they all start
to talk at once. LUCY is still next to ELINOR.
LUCY
Oh, Miss Dashwood, I cannot bear it!
Just when I was to have the
opportunity of speaking with you.
Having been denied their trip, the DASHWOODS and WILLOUGHBY
have set out an impromptu picnic. WILLOUGHBY is wandering
restlessly about.
The weather is sublime.
WILLOUGHBY
Frailty, thy name is Brandon!
MARIANNE
There are some people who cannot
bear a party of pleasure. I think he
wrote the letter himself as a trick
for getting out of it.
MRS DASHWOOD
(indulgently)
You are a very wicked pair, Colonel
Brandon will be sadly missed.
WILLOUGHBY
Why? When he is the kind of man that
everyone speaks well of and no one
wants to talk to.
MARIANNE
Exactly!
ELINOR
Nonsense.
MRS DASHWOOD
Colonel Brandon is very highly
esteemed at the Park.
WILLOUGHBY
Which is enough censure in itself.
ELINOR
(half laughing)
Really, Willoughby!
WILLOUGHBY
(imitating Mrs Jennings
perfectly)
Come, come, Mr Impudence--I know you
and your wicked ways--oh!
He gives a little shriek and waddles about the garden doing
her walk. He comes up to ELINOR and puts his head on her
shoulder.
WILLOUGHBY
Come, Miss Dashwood, reveal your
beau, reveal him, I say! Let's have
no secrets between friends! Let me
winkle them out of you!
ELINOR hits him on the nose with her teaspoon and he waddles
off to MARIANNE.
WILLOUGHBY
(as Mrs Jennings)
I declare, Miss Marianne, if I do
not have you married to the Colonel
by teatime, I shall swallow my own
bonnet.
MARIANNE laughs. WILLOUGHBY drops the parody suddenly.
WILLOUGHBY
As if you could marry such a
character.
ELINOR
Why should you dislike him?
There is indeed an edge to WILLOUGHBY's raillery. He flicks
ELINOR an almost alarmed glance and then sweeps MARIANNE to
her feet and starts to dance around the garden with her.
WILLOUGHBY
Because he has threatened me with
rain when I wanted it fine, he has
found fault with the balance of my
curricle and I cannot persuade him
to buy my brown mare. If it will be
of any satisfaction to you, however,
to be told I believe his character
to be in all other respects
irreproachable, I am ready to confess
it. And in return for an
acknowledgement that must give me
some pain.
(he is slowing down)
You cannot deny me the privilege...
(slower still)
of disliking him...
(and stopping)
as much as I adore...
He and MARIANNE are standing looking at each other. The
expression on WILLOUGHBY's face is heart-stopping. MARGARET
has stopped eating and is staring with her mouth open.
ELINOR glances at MRS DASHWOOD but she is gazing up at them
with almost as many stars in her eyes as MARIANNE.
Suddenly WILLOUGHBY breaks the mood by swinging away from
MARIANNE and gesturing to the house.
WILLOUGHBY
--this cottage!
The tension is broken. MARGARET starts to chew again.
MRS DASHWOOD
I have great plans for improvements
to it, you know, Mr Willoughby.
WILLOUGHBY
Now that I will never consent to.
Not a stone must be added to its
walls. Were I rich enough, I would
instantly pull down Combe Magna and
build it up again in the exact image
of that cottage!
ELINOR
With dark, narrow stairs, a poky
hall and a fire that smokes?
WILLOUGHBY
Especially the fire that smokes!
Then I might be as happy at Combe
Magna as I have been at Barton.
He looks at MARIANNE, who has gone to sit at her mother's
feet.
WILLOUGHBY
But this place has one claim on my
affection which no other can possibly
share.
MARIANNE is so irradiated with happiness that she looks like
an angel.
WILLOUGHBY
Promise me you will never change it.
MRS DASHWOOD
I do not have the heart.
ELINOR
Or the money.
MARIANNE is seeing WILLOUGHBY off.
WILLOUGHBY
Miss Marianne, will you--will you do
me the honour of granting me an
interview tomorrow--alone?
MARIANNE
Willoughby, we are always alone!
WILLOUGHBY
But there is something very particular
I should like to ask you.
There is something about his formal tone that makes her feel
shy.
MARIANNE
Of course. I shall ask Mamma if I
may stay behind from church.
WILLOUGHBY
Thank you. Until tomorrow then--Miss
Marianne.
He mounts Bedivere and leaves. MARIANNE looks after him, her
eyes shining. He is coming to propose.
A district of extreme poverty, populated by the LOWLIFE of
LONDON: FOOTPADS, dogs, rats and SCAVENGERS of all kinds. In
the distance a tavern belches forth drunken REVELLERS who
sway and reel into the night.
A hooded HORSEMAN pulls up his exhausted steed at the entrance
to a slum. He dismounts and looks up at one of the windows.
The rags hanging there twitch as if someone is watching for
him. He strides inside.
The DASHWOODS return from church to find THOMAS grooming
Bedivere at the garden gate. Their excitement mounts.
The DASHWOODS cluster round the door.
MARGARET
Willoughby, come back!
She is silenced by ELINOR as WILLOUGHBY seizes Bedivere's
reins from THOMAS, mounts up and rides off at a furious pace.
The rain has settled in. The cottage looks cold and bleak.
Smoke issues from every chimney in the place.
MRS DASHWOOD and MARGARET are waving MRS JENNINGS's carriage
off. MARIANNE waves back with such exuberance that she
practically falls out.
MRS JENNINGS's carriage trundles along.
Establishing shot of a handsome town house. MRS JENNINGS's
carriage comes into shot and stops in front of it.
The PALMERS, MRS JENNINGS, JOHN, FANNY, LUCY, ELINOR and
MARIANNE are walking through the arcade. Additional wealth
has evidently encouraged FANNY sartorially and she sprouts
as much fruit and feathers as a market stall. LUCY is holding
ELINOR's arm in a pinionlike grip. MRS JENNINGS is gossiping
with CHARLOTTE.
MARIANNE's good looks are heightened by her feverish
expectation of seeing WILLOUGHBY at every step, and many
young men raise their hats to her and turn as she passes.
MARIANNE
Where is dear Edward, John? We expect
to see him daily.
FANNY stiffens. LUCY's sharp eyes dart hither and thither.
MRS JENNINGS senses gossip. ELINOR steels herself.
MRS JENNINGS
And who is 'dear Edward'?
CHARLOTTE
Who indeed?
FANNY smiles glacially.
FANNY
My brother, Mrs Jennings--Edward
Ferrars.
MRS JENNINGS looks at ELINOR in sly triumph.
MRS JENNINGS
Indeed! Is that Ferrars with an F?
She and CHARLOTTE chuckle to each other. LUCY looks at ELINOR.
So many carriages have entered the crescent to deliver the
GUESTS that gridlock has occurred and people are forced to
walk to the entrance. We see MRS JENNINGS, MARIANNE, ELINOR
and LUCY alighting from their carriage and picking their way
through the mud, their skirts raised above their ankles.
ELINOR nearly trips and is obliged to grab onto LUCY in order
not to slip into the dirt.
MRS JENNINGS's carriage stands outside. A livened FOOTMAN
opens the door and LUCY steps out brandishing a new muff.
A tranquil afternoon...
We hold a long shot of the house for a moment of silence.
Then from inside comes an almost inhumanly loud shriek.
FANNY (V.O.)
Viper in my bosom!
FANNY is trying to drag LUCY out of the house. ROBERT and
JOHN are trying to reason with her. FANNY loses her grip and
falls backwards. LUCY flings herself into ROBERT's arms.
ROBERT falls over.
MRS JENNINGS is running as fast as her fat little legs will
carry her.
MRS JENNINGS pants up the front steps.
LUCY and MRS JENNINGS are on the doorstep. LUCY looks rather
lost and pathetic, with her little bundles, hastily packed.
The door opens and CHARLOTTE precedes the SERVANT, ushering
them in with shrill cries of sympathy.
COLONEL BRANDON (V.O.)
I have heard that your friend Mr
Ferrars has been entirely cast off
by his family for persevering in his
engagement to Miss Steele.
ELINOR and BRANDON walk round the quiet square.
COLONEL BRANDON
Have I been rightly informed? Is it
so?
ELINOR is greatly taken aback by this unexpected query.
ELINOR
It is indeed so. Are you acquainted
with Mr Ferrars?
COLONEL BRANDON
No, we have never met. But I know
only too well the cruelty--the
impolitic cruelty of dividing two
young people long attached to one
another. Mrs Ferrars does not know
what she may drive her son to--
He pauses, frowning in remembrance. ELINOR waits in suspense.
COLONEL BRANDON
I have a proposal to make that should
enable him to marry Miss Steele
immediately. Since the gentleman is
so close a friend to your family,
perhaps you will be good enough to
mention it to him?
ELINOR is completely taken aback. She takes a moment to reply.
ELINOR
Colonel, I am sure he would be only
too delighted to hear it from your
own lips.
COLONEL BRANDON
I think not. His behaviour has proved
him proud--in the best sense. I feel
certain this is the right course.
The PALMERS' carriage stands outside the house. COLONEL
BRANDON helps MARIANNE in beside ELINOR before mounting his
horse to ride alongside. MRS JENNINGS waves goodbye from the
steps. The carriage moves off. MRS JENNINGS blows her nose,
looks up and down the street in search of gossip and goes
back indoors with a sigh.
The carriage bowls along, with BRANDON riding next to it.
CHARLOTTE (V.O.)
I hear Miss Grey's bridal gown was
everything of the finest--made in
Paris, no less. I should have liked
to see it, although I dare say it
was a sorry affair, scalloped with
ruffles--but what do the French know
about fashion?
The carriage stands outside the PALMER residence, a
resplendent affair with a great deal of land. BRANDON is
helping MARIANNE and ELINOR out of the carriage.
CHARLOTTE (V.O.)
I am resolved never to mention Mr
Willoughby's name again, and
furthermore I shall tell everyone I
meet what a good-for nothing he is.
MR PALMER (V.O.)
Be quiet.
ELINOR and MARIANNE stand on the steps as the PALMERS debauch
from the carriage amid a welter of SERVANTS.
ELINOR
(sotto voce)
I do not think she drew breath from
the moment we left London. It is my
fault--I should have found some other
way of getting home.
MARIANNE
There was no other way you said so
yourself.
ELINOR
We shall be home soon enough. Mamma
will comfort you, dearest.
MARIANNE
I am stiff from sitting so long.
Will you tell Charlotte that I am
going for a stroll? ELINOR glances
at the sky in concern.
ELINOR
I think it is going to rain.
MARIANNE
No, no, it will not rain.
ELINOR cannot help but smile at this return of the old
MARIANNE.
ELINOR
You always say that and then it always
does.
MARIANNE
I will keep to the garden, near the
house.
MARIANNE walks off. ELINOR watches her go anxiously.
MARIANNE walks purposefully towards the garden wall, beyond
which lies a hill.
MARIANNE comes to a gate in the wall and turns the handle.
It opens. She throws a glance back to the house and passes
through. There is a low rumble of thunder.
MARIANNE, calm and determined, walks towards the top of the
hill. The wind whips and plucks at her hair and skirts.
ELINOR's POV. MARIANNE is nowhere in sight. Storm clouds
have gathered on the bill.
Rain has started to pour down. MARIANNE walks on regardless.
MARIANNE has reached the top. Soaked to the skin, she stands
with the storm raging around her, staring at the spires of
Combe Magna, the place that would have been her home. Rain
streaks her face and the wind whips her hair about her.
Through frozen lips she whispers:
MARIANNE
Love is not love Which alters when
it alteration finds Or bends with
the remover to remove: 0, no! it is
an ever-fixed mark That looks on
tempests and is never shaken...
BRANDON is looking for MARIANNE. He enters a greenhouse.
COLONEL BRANDON
Marianne!
MARIANNE stares at Combe Magna, a strange smile playing about
her lips. Then she calls to WILLOUGHBY as though he were
near. The effect is eerie, unworldly.
MARIANNE
Willoughby... Willoughby...
BRANDON runs up the hillside as though the devil were at his
heels.
ELINOR's POV of BRANDON walking up to the house with MARIANNE
cradled in his arms. It is like seeing Willoughby's ghost.
The great house sits in darkness. A sense of foreboding.
CHARLOTTE is getting into their carriage with MRS BUNTING
and BABY THOMAS. MR PALMER is on the steps with ELINOR. He
takes her hand and looks at her with real sympathy.
MR PALMER
My dear Miss Dashwood, I am more
sorry than I can say. If you would
prefer me to stay I am at your
service.
ELINOR is touched to find this warm heart beneath his frosty
exterior.
ELINOR
Mr Palmer, that is very kind. But
Colonel Brandon and Dr Harris will
look after us. Thank you for
everything you have done.
MR PALMER nods, presses her hand, and walks down the steps
to the carriage.
BRANDON mounts his horse, turns to look at the house for a
moment, and then spurs it violently forward.
The house stands in virtual darkness with only a dim light
issuing from one of the upper rooms.
BRANDON riding fast, his cape billowing out behind him.
A shimmer of light appears on the rim of the horizon.
Somewhere a lark breaks into clear untroubled song.
BRANDON helps MRS DASHWOOD, who is weak with exhaustion and
distress, out of the carriage.
The cottage nestles in the first buds of spring. A piece of
rope hangs down from the branches of a tree in the garden.
It starts to wave about wildly and we see MARGARET emerging
and climbing down. She has built herself a new tree-house.
COLONEL BRANDON (V.O.)
What though the sea with waves
continuall Doe eate the earth, it is
no more at all.
ELINOR and MARIANNE are out on a walk. They go very slowly,
MARIANNE leaning on ELINOR's arm. Their mood is loving,
companion able.
ELINOR and MARIANNE walk on. Suddenly, MARIANNE stops.
MARIANNE
There.
She indicates a spot on the ground but ELINOR can see nothing
and is momentarily alarmed. MARIANNE gazes at the ground and
breathes in deeply.
MARIANNE
There I fell, and there I first saw
Willoughby.
ELINOR
Poor Willoughby. He will always regret
you.
MARIANNE
But does it follow that, had he chosen
me, he would have been content?
ELINOR looks at MARIANNE, surprised.
MARIANNE
He would have had a wife he loved
but no money--and might soon have
learned to rank the demands of his
pocket-book far above the demands of
his heart.
ELINOR regards MARIANNE admiringly. MARIANNE smiles sadly.
MARIANNE
If his present regrets are half as
painful as mine, he will suffer
enough.
ELINOR
Do you compare your conduct with
his?
MARIANNE
No. I compare it with what it ought
to have been. I compare it with yours.
ELINOR
Our situations were very different.
MARIANNE
My illness has made me consider the
past. I saw in my own behaviour
nothing but imprudence--and worse. I
was insolent and unjust to everyone--
ELINOR tries to stem the flow but MARIANNE continues.
MARIANNE
--but you--you I wronged above all.
Only I knew your heart and its sorrows
but even then I was never a grain
more compassionate. I brought my
illness upon myself--I wanted to
destroy myself. And had I succeeded,
what misery should I have caused
you?
ELINOR embraces her. They stand with their arms round one
another in silence for a moment. Then MARIANNE breaks away
and speaks with great good humour and energy.
MARIANNE
I shall mend my ways! I shall no
longer worry others nor torture
myself. I am determined to enter on
a course of serious study---Colonel
Brandon has promised me the run of
his library and I shall read at least
six hours a day. By the end of the
year I expect to have improved my
learning a very great deal.
THOMAS is sitting on the back of a local wagon, holding a
basket of food.
He jumps off near the cottage and waves a cheery farewell to
the DRIVER.
ELINOR is standing by the gate, looking out. MRS DASHWOOD
comes down the path to join her. She links arms with ELINOR
and they stand in silence for a beat.
MRS DASHWOOD
Your father once told me not to allow
you to neglect yourself. Now I find
that it is I who have neglected you
most.
ELINOR
No, Mamma.
MRS DASHWOOD
Yes, I have. We all have. Marianne
is right.
ELINOR
I am very good at hiding.
MRS DASHWOOD
Then we must observe you more closely.
A pause.
ELINOR
Mamma?
MRS DASHWOOD
Yes, my darling?
ELINOR
There is a painful difference between
the expectation of an unpleasant
event and its final certainty.
MRS DASHWOOD squeezes ELINOR's arm tightly.
A horse and cart are jogging along. The cart contains a large
object tied down and covered with canvas. The DRIVER whistles
tunelessly.
THOMAS and the CARTER are carrying a small piano up the path.
MARGARET is up her tree. ELINOR is pulling weeds. MRS DASHWOOD
is sitting on a stool working on MARGARET's dress and
listening to the strains of the new song which MARIANNE is
singing in the cottage. All of a sudden, MRS DASHWOOD rises,
shielding her eyes with her hand. She walks down to the gate,
looking out.
MRS DASHWOOD
Here is Colonel Brandon! Marianne!
The piano stops. MARIANNE comes out and they all gather at
the gate to watch for the rider.
Their POV of a HORSEMAN in the distance.
ELINOR
I do not think it is the Colonel.
MRS DASHWOOD
It must be. He said he would arrive
today. You must play him the new
song, Marianne.
Suddenly there is a yell from MARGARET's tree.
MARGARET
Edward!
MARGARET practically throws herself out of the tree onto the
grass.
MARGARET
It is Edward!
The women look at each other in complete consternation.
MRS DASHWOOD
Calm. We must be calm.
The three DASHWOODS come into the garden, still holding hands.
MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD are stamping about in the garden
trying to keep warm. MARGARET has climbed into her tree-house.
The branches rustle.
MARGARET
He's sitting next to her!
MRS DASHWOOD/MARIANNE
Margaret, come down!/Is he?
MRS DASHWOOD
(scolding)
Margaret! Will you stop--
MARIANNE
What's happening now?
MRS DASHWOOD
Marianne!
MARGARET (V.O.)
He's kneeling down!
MRS DASHWOOD can't help herself.
MRS DASHWOOD
Oh! Is he? Oh!
She and MARIANNE look at each other joyfully.
The figures of EDWARD and ELINOR can be seen walking, in
deep conversation.
Later. The lovers walk slowly, their heads almost touching,
their words low and intimate.
ELINOR
Your mother, I suppose, will hardly
be less angry with Robert for marrying
Lucy.
EDWARD
The more so since she settled the
money upon him so irrevocably--
ELINOR
--no doubt because she had run out
of sons to disinherit.
EDWARD
Her family fluctuates at an alarming
rate. Then, in London, when you told
me of the Colonel's offer, I became
convinced that you wanted me to marry
Lucy and that--well, that you and
Colonel Brandon...
ELINOR
Me and Colonel Brandon!
EDWARD
I shall not forget attempting to
thank him for making it possible for
me to marry the woman I did not love
while convinced he had designs upon
the woman I did--do--love.
EDWARD stops walking. He looks at ELINOR and realises he can
stand it no longer.
EDWARD
Would you--can you--excuse me--
He takes her face in his hands and kisses her.
A group of VILLAGE CHILDREN run down the hillside towards
the church waving ribbons and dressed in their Sunday best.
A large wedding party is gathered outside the church. The
entire village is present--CHILDREN, FARMERS, LABOURERS,
SHOPKEEPERS, and all our PRINCIPALS. We see MRS JENNINGS in
a gigantic mauve bonnet, CHARLOTTE and MR PALMER, SIR JOHN,
MRS DASHWOOD, MARGARET, THOMAS, JOHN and FANNY, who is dressed
in a fantastically inappropriate concoction, and some MEN in
regimental uniform.
The path to the church is strewn with wild flowers and
everyone holds a bunch of their own. The church bells start
to peal, and a great cheer goes up as the door opens and
BETSY comes out holding the bridal cake aloft.
The bride and groom appear: MARIANNE, in white lawn, and
COLONEL BRANDON in full uniform. Behind them come EDWARD in
his parson's garb and, on his arm, ELINOR as matron of honour.
CLOSE on them as they watch the party moving away. MARIANNE
and BRANDON make their way forwards, everyone throws their
flowers over them, whooping and singing. An open carriage
decked with bridal wreaths comes to meet them, and BRANDON
lifts MARIANNE in. His melancholy air is all but gone and he
radiates joyful life and vigour. MARIANNE also looks extremely
happy - but there is a gravity to her joy that makes her
seem much older.
According to the custom of the time, BRANDON throws a large
handful of six pences into the crowd, and the VILLAGE CHILDREN
jump and dive for them.
The coins spin and bounce, catching the sun like jewels. One
hits FANNY in the eye. She reels and falls over backwards
into a gorse bush. CAM pulls back as the wedding procession
makes its glorious way from the church. We draw away into
the surrounding countryside.
Then we see, on the far edge of frame, very small, a MAN
sitting on a white horse, watching. It is WILLOUGHBY. As we
draw back further still, he slowly pulls the horse around
and moves off in the opposite direction.
