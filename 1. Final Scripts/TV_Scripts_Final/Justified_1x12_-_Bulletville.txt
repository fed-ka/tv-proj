      EXT. AVA S HOUSE - NIGHT11

      The house is dark.  A car drives up and out gets... BOYD 
      CROWDER.  He goes to the door and knocks.

                                  BOYD
                    Ava?  You home?

                                  AVA (O.S.)
                    Who is that?

                                  BOYD
                    Boyd.

                                  AVA (O.S.)
                    You get the hell away from here.

                                  BOYD
                      I apologize for the late hour.  I 
                    just want a word.

      From inside comes the sound of feet running downstairs, and 
      the sound of a shotgun being racked.  Boyd quickly backs away 
      from the door, back down the steps, his hands in the air.

      AVA appears at the door with the sawed-off shotgun.

                                  AVA
                    What the hell you want?

                                  BOYD
                    I am alone and my hands are empty 
                    as you can see.

                                  AVA
                    Maybe you can use them to keep the 
                    shot from ripping open your chest.

                                  BOYD
                    I can only imagine you d want to do 
                    that, given our history.

                                  AVA
                    Boyd, I gotta warn you, if I start 
                    counting down from ten, I may lose 
                    patience at five.

                                  BOYD
                    I came to say I m sorry, that s 
                    all.  I will go now and disturb you 
                    no further.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)        EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    2.

        CONTINUED:11

      Boyd starts backing to his car, hands still raised.

                                  AVA
                    Sorry about what?

                                  BOYD
                    So many things.

                                  AVA
                    You mean like world hunger?

                                  BOYD
                    So many things I have done to you.

                                  AVA
                    I wanna hear this.

      Boyd stops.

                                  BOYD
                    It s hard to know where to begin.  
                    I could start with the last time I 
                    saw you.  I kept you hostage in 
                    your own home until Raylan came and 
                      I instigated a shoot-out in your 
                    dining room.

                                  AVA
                    That didn t end so bad, far as I 
                    was concerned.

                                  BOYD
                    Before that, for years, I lusted 
                    after you and I was far from 
                    subtle.  That was wrong.  Not just 
                    because you were my brother s wife, 
                    but because it was unseemly and 
                    unwanted and I made you 
                      uncomfortable.

                                  AVA
                    If by uncomfortable you mean it 
                    made my skin crawl, then yes.

                                  BOYD
                    But by far my biggest regret 
                    concerns my brother Bowman.

                                  AVA
                    You sorry he was born?

                                  BOYD
                    Oh, I don t question the will of 
                    God, bringing a life into the 
                    world.  My regret is that I did 
                    nothing to stop or in any way 
                    curtail his atrocious behavior.  I 
                    knew how he was, but I took no 
                    action, and for that I am deeply 
                    sorry.  

                                  AVA
                    Why are you coming to me now?

                                  BOYD
                    I have embarked on a new life of 
                    service to the will of my savior.

                                  AVA
                    Your old friend thinks you re full 
                    of shit.

                                  BOYD
                    If by  old friend  you mean Raylan, 
                    he will see soon enough that I am 
                    not all talk.

                                  AVA
                    What does that mean?

                                  BOYD
                    I m afraid I can t tell you.

                                  AVA
                    Seems to me, all you re doing here 
                    is talk, saying you re sorry.

                                  BOYD
                    Ava, if there are any actions I can 
                    take to atone for what I have done, 
                    I will take them.

                                  AVA
                    Like what?  Paint my house?

                                  BOYD
                    If that s what you want.

                                  AVA
                    You think painting my house would 
                    make up for years of you standing 
                    by while Bowman beat on me?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)        EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    4.

                    Of course not.  But I can only do 
                    what I can do.

                                  AVA
                    How about this?  How about what you 
                    do for me is you leave here and 
                    never see me again.  Let s start 
                    with that.

                                  BOYD
                    All right.

      Boyd gets in his car, drives off.  Ava watches Boyd drive 
      off.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        ACT ONE

      INT. JOHNNY CROWDER S BAR - NIGHT22

      The place is closed.  JOHNNY CROWDER, edgy, smokes a 
      cigarette, while HESTLER reads a porno mag.  Two of BO S 
      THUGS (call them HECKLE and JECKLE) sit passing a joint back 
      and forth.  A third thug (call him RUFUS) practices flipping 
      a knife into a dart board.  

                                  JOHNNY
                          (finally)
                    Son of a bitch. 

                                    HESTLER
                    What s your problem?

                                  JOHNNY
                    Should a been here by now.  

      Johnny puts out his smoke, pulls on his jacket.  

                                  JOHNNY (CONT D)
                    Call Bo.

                                    HESTLER
                    Where the hell you going?

                                  JOHNNY
                    See if they got lost.  

                                    HESTLER
                    Ain t they got GPS? 

      Johnny s out the door.  Hestler shoots Bo s thugs a look. 

                                    HESTLER (CONT D)
                    He can be a real old lady 
                      sometimes, can t he?

      He takes out his cell phone, dials Bo.

      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT33

      Dark, empty road, winding through the back-country.  Johnny s 
      car comes toward us, pulls off, and brakes.

      I/E. JOHNNY S CAR - ROAD - NIGHT44

      Johnny waits, checks his mirror and wristwatch.  Boyd s hand 
      knocks on the passenger side window.  Johnny reaches across, 
      and opens the passenger door.  Boyd slides in.  




                                                                              (CONTINUED)        EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    6.

                    We did.  And we got the shipment.

      Johnny relaxes, grins:

                                  JOHNNY
                    Damn, Boyd!  We re takin  over!

                                  BOYD
                    Sent  em back where they came from.

                    Should be halfway to Tennessee by

                    They were just supposed to 
                      disappear.  Along with the truck, 
                    and the shipment.  
                          (off Boyd s silence)
                    Where is it?  Where s the shipment?

                                  BOYD
                    Johnny, it went up in a pillar of 
                    fire... 

                                  JOHNNY
                    You burned it??

                                  BOYD
                    I could not allow that poison into 
                    Harlan.

                                  JOHNNY
                    Oh, for--  We had a plan!  Shipment 
                      disappears, Bo takes the fall, and 
                    we step up.  There something about 
                    that plan you didn t understand?  

      Boyd, trying to be patient with a slow learner.

                                  BOYD
                    Johnny, you want to spend eternity 
                    writhing in hellfire?  Because 
                    that s how your plan ends.

      dust and dead leaves.  Rufus and Hestler are in the backs of 
      the trucks, holding shotguns on Boyd and his groggy followers 
      as they line up outside their tents, pulling on their pants,

                                  BO
                    Don t stop until I tell you. 

                                  JOHNNY
                    No, sir. 
                          (rolls his sleeves)
                    Hey, Boyd.

                                  BOYD
                    Johnny. 

                                  JOHNNY
                    This is gonna hurt.

      Johnny starts.  Boyd does not lift a finger to protect 
      himself, GRUNTING IN PAIN as the punches land (uttering only 
      Biblical verses about forbearance -- TK).  

      Every time Boyd goes down, he gets back to his feet,  Cool-
        Hand-Luke -style, and literally turns the other cheek.  

      The whole scene is eerily quiet, the silence broken only by 
      Boyd s grunts and the sickening MEAT-ON-MEAT sound of landed 
      punches.  

      By the fourth or fifth time, Boyd doesn t pull himself back 
      up.  Blood pours.  Hard to imagine he could take much more.  

                                  JOHNNY (CONT D)
                    Think he s had enough?  

                                  BO
                    I do not.  

                                  JOHNNY
                    You want me to kill him?  

                                  BO
                    Ain t the worst idea I ve heard 
                    today.  

      Bo crosses, squats by Boyd, close to his face.  He seems 
      genuinely saddened.  

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    I know we weren t as close as we 
                    might ve been, son.  But how d it 
                    ever come to this?  

                                  BOYD
                    Guess its just one of those things. 

                                  BO
                    I guess it is.

                    Where do you keep the weapons?

                    Don t know what you re talking 
                    about.  

      Bo just looks at Boyd.  So that s how its gonna be, huh.  Bo 
      stands, addresses Boyd s men.

                    there and watch your tin-pot 
                    messiah get beat to death, tell me 
                    where you re hiding the weapons.  

      Boyd s men look at each other.  Bo turns to Johnny.

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    Johnny.  

      Johnny grabs Boyd by the shirt, pulls him to his feet, then 
      punches him again.  Boyd hits the dirt, hard.  Suddenly, one 
      of Boyd s men speaks:

                                  BOYD'S MAN #1
                    Under the fire.

                    Then grab shovels and start 
                    digging.
                          (no movement)
                    Now!

      The men start to move, under the supervision of Bo s men.  
      Boyd gets up.

                          (to Boyd)

                    I will not.

                                  BO
                    Yes, you will.  You see, when we 
                    expose your weapons, we are going 
                    to rope your merry men to the trees 
                    and I am going to call your marshal 
                    friend Raylan and tell him to come 
                    on out.  Your flock will be sent 
                    away for numerous parole

                                  BOYD
                    And I will go with them.

      Bo pulls his pistol.  Boyd shuts his eyes.

      Boyd looks at his men, then turns and starts walking off.

      Boyd keeps walking.

      INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAYAa14Aa14

      Raylan comes up the stairs, returning from his motel, when he 
      crosses with WINONA.  

                                  WINONA
                    Hey.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Glad I ran into you.  

                                  WINONA
                          (smiles)
                    Well, I m glad you re glad.

      Raylan smiles, but:

                                  RAYLAN
                    No.  I mean yes... we need to talk 
                    about the other night.

      Before she can respond, Art approaches.  

                                  ART
                    How are you, Winona?  

                                  WINONA
                    Fine, Chief.  You?

                                  ART 
                    Never better.  Raylan, let s take a 
                    ride upstairs.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    There a problem?

                                  ART
                    Vasquez is on break.  We can brief 
                    him, make arrangements to sit him 
                    down with our C.I. 

                                  WINONA
                          (moving off)
                    Well, I was just...

                                  RAYLAN
                    Hang on, Winona.
                          (to Art)
                    Can I catch up with you? 

      Art pushes the UP button.  




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    20.

                    I ll wait.  You got  til the 
                    elevator comes. 

      Raylan turns to Winona - their conversation now coded.

                                  WINONA
                    Anytime is good.  For us to talk.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I mean just talk.   

                                  WINONA
                    Oh.  Well, I m open.  Gary s at the 
                    Athletic Club.  
                            (clarifying)
                    Living at.  Maybe we could just 
                    talk about that.

      As Raylan realizes what she s saying, the elevator doors 
      open.  Art steps inside.

                                  ART
                          (holds the door)
                    Raylan...

                                  WINONA
                    You should go.  

                                  ART 
                    Right now.  

      Raylan crosses into the elevator.  Art clocks Raylan and 
      Winona holding a look, as the doors close.  

      INT. RAYLAN S MOTEL ROOM - DAYA14A14

      Arlo s sitting on the bed, drinking Raylan s booze.  There s 
      a KNOCK on the door.  He pulls himself off the bed, shuffles 
      across the room, pulls open the door to REVEAL Bo Crowder.

                                  ARLO
                    Are you outta your mind?

                                  BO
                    You ll have to be more specific.

                    You re not supposed to know I m 
                    working with the Marshals.

                                  BO
                    So?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    21.

                                  ARLO
                    So how s it look, you knowing I m 
                    here?  What if Raylan d answered 
                    the door?

                                  BO
                    Raylan s not home.

      Long pause as Arlo considers this.

                                  ARLO
                    You ve got a shadow on me?

      Bo shrugs.  Without saying anything, he pats Arlo down for a 
      wire, doesn t find one.

                                  ARLO (CONT D)
                    How do you know there s not a mic 
                    in the ceiling?

                    What re the chances they d bug 
                    their own guy s place?

                                  ARLO
                    Fair enough.  Why re you here? 

                                  BO
                    Why re you here?  Doesn t look like 
                    you ll make our meeting at Pine 
                    Top.

                                  ARLO
                    Things have changed.  They know 
                    about Boyd blowing up your 
                    shipment; that he s not working for 
                    you.

                                  BO
                    They got that right.

                                  ARLO
                    They re gonna give me new handlers.

                                  BO
                    Who?

                                  ARLO
                    FBI, DEA.  Which is good.  I can 
                    get you even better information.

                                  ARLO

      Bo nods, apparently satisfied.

                    There is one thing you could do for

                    Given what Boyd has done I m afraid 
                    I have to bow to you on that score: 
                    mine s worse.  That shipment he 
                    blew up was very valuable, sent to 
                    me by a friend in Miami.  I have a 
                    lot to do to repair my relationship 
                    with that man and money alone won t 
                    cut it.  As it happens, my Miami 
                    friend lost a captain and a couple 
                    button men to a certain deputy 
                    marshal.

      EXT. WOODS - BOYD S CAMP - DAY1616

      Boyd, red-eyed, is tamping down a mound of dirt with a 
      shovel.  He s exhausted, covered in dried blood and dirt, 
      barely able to lift the shovel.  He finally staggers back, 
      and we reveal -

      A cluster of SIX UNMARKED GRAVES.  Boyd picks up a canteen, 
      drinks hard, then holds the canteen over his head, lets the 
      water cascade over him.    

      He tosses aside the empty canteen, picks up his tattered 
      Bible, stands facing the graves, opens the book.  After a few 
      moments reflection, he looks up.    

                                  BOYD
                    Father in Heaven, I m not gonna 
                    pretend to understand.  You showed 
                    me what You wanted done, and we did 
                    it.  How could You let it end like 
                    this?  
                            (struggling)
                    These men trusted me to lead them 
                    in the path of righteousness, for 
                    Your name s sake.  Every one of 
                    these men came to You because they 
                    believed in me.  And now they re 
                    dead.  
                          (closes the Bible)
                    I need a sign.  I need to know 
                    their sacrifice means something to 
                    you.  

      Boyd listens to the silence of the woods.  Then, he sets the 
      book aside.  There are tears in his eyes.  

                                  BOYD (CONT'D)
                          (finally)
                    Have I just been talking to myself 
                    all along?   

      Off Boyd, at the end of the road.  

      EXT. RAYLAN S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHTA17A17

      Arlo sits on the porch, waiting.  Raylan drives up, gets out 
      of his car.  They exchange a look.

                      Everything all right?  

      Arlo thought he had his poker-face on.  He covers:

                    I been cooped up here all day with 
                    nothing to do but watch TV and 
                    sleep.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    According to Helen, that s about 
                    all you do at home anyway.   

      Raylan heads inside, Arlo follows.

      INT. RAYLAN S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHTA18A18

      Raylan enters, and surveys Arlo s squatter mess, including 
      the nearly empty bottle of whiskey, on the table.  Arlo makes 
      a half-hearted attempt to straighten up, tossing his take out 
      food wrappers in the trash.  

                                  ARLO
                    Want a drink?

                    Of what s left of my own liquor?  
                    No, you go ahead and finish it off.  
                    Knowing that you will anyway.

      Arlo goes to the table, refills his empty glass.  Raylan 
      takes off his jacket, gets comfortable.  

                                  ARLO
                    You ever gonna get married again?

      Raylan shoots him a look.

                    What brought that on?

                    much aptitude for it.

      Arlo drinks, checks his watch.

                                  RAYLAN
                    What re you talking about?

                                  ARLO
                      I remember the girls always chased 
                    you, since you were twelve.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Like hell. 

                                  ARLO
                    Ava Crowder.  You gonna tell me she 
                    didn t chase you?  

                                  RAYLAN
                    She didn t have to.  

      Arlo drinks, glances out the window.  Then:

                                  ARLO
                    You remember your mama s laugh?   

                                  RAYLAN
                    She had a good one.  

                                  ARLO
                    She always hoped you and me would 
                    get closer.  Maybe things would be 
                    different now, if we had. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    Guess that wasn t our way.    

                                  ARLO
                    You should get married again.  Not 
                    living like this.

                                  RAYLAN
                    What s going on, Arlo?  You keep 
                    checking your watch.  

                                  ARLO
                    Just wondered how long I ve been a 
                    prisoner here.  

      Arlo turns again, refills his glass.  His back to Raylan, he 
      slips his hand under a jacket on the table. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    That all?  

                                  ARLO
                    We never had much in common, you 
                    and me.  But that doesn t mean I 
                    don t have regrets.  

      Arlo slips his hand out, now holding a gun.  He turns to face 
      Raylan - and to his surprise (and ours) Raylan now has his 
      gun levelled back at Arlo.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Put the gun down.  

      Arlo sets the gun down, slowly.  

                                  RAYLAN (CONT'D)
                    When are they coming?

                                  ARLO
                    They re waiting outside.  
                          (then)
                    How long you known?

      Raylan looks at him sadly.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Well, Arlo.  Truth is, I guess I ve 
                    always known.  

                                  ARLO 
                    This isn t something I wanted to 
                    do.  Bo didn t give me any choice. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    What s the plan?







                                                                              (CONTINUED)  EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    28-29.

                    wants to take you alive, turn you 
                    over to some fella down in Miami.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    He tell you why?  
                          (off Arlo s silence)
                    So they can torture me to death.  

                                  ARLO
                    He didn t give me details.

                                  RAYLAN
                    They waiting for a signal?

                                  ARLO
                    Gunshot.  Look, son...

                          (cuts him off)
                    Don t ever call me that again.  

      Then Raylan FIRES, wings Arlo s arm.  Arlo looks at his arm 
      in disbelief, as the blood starts.  

                                  RAYLAN (CONT'D)
                    Just creased you.  Better sit down.  

      Arlo slumps onto the bed.  Raylan moves to the front window.

      Alerted by the gunshot, Heckle and Jeckle get out of a car, 
      pistols at their sides, and head to Raylan s room.

      The motel room door swings open, reveals Heckle and Jeckle.

                    He went out the back.  

      Guns out, they come into the room.  The motel room door 
      suddenly swings closed, reveals Raylan behind it, his gun 
      leveled at the thugs  backs. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    30.

      Heckle and Jeckle hesitate, then spin, guns coming up.  
      Raylan shoots Jeckle.  Jeckle s shot goes sideways.  Raylan 
      shoots again, gets Heckle in the throat.  Heckle goes down. 

      Raylan crosses to the thugs, kicks their guns free - they re 
      both dead.  Without a word to Arlo, Raylan takes out his 
      phone, dials.

                    What is...

      Soon as Ava clears the door, Hestler throws a jacket over her 
      head, Rufus grabs the shotgun.  Twists it hard away from her.  
      Bo appears behind him, wearing work gloves.

                    Watch your head.

      Bo hits Ava hard with the butt of the shotgun.  She goes limp 
      under the jacket.

      Bo pulls the trigger, blows Johnny backwards across the 
      porch.

                    Yeah, it was.  See, what they re 
                    gonna find is you dead and Ava 
                    gone.  They re gonna think she shot 
                    another Crowder come to harass her, 
                    then lit out for the territories.

      Bo hangs up.

                                  BOYD
                    He has Ava?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Yes.

                                  BOYD
                    Where does he want you to go?

                                  RAYLAN
                    West toward Bulletville.

                                  BOYD
                    He has a cabin up in Brogie Holler.  
                    I ll go with you.  I know every 
                    inch of that holler.

                                  RAYLAN
                    If you want to help, stay here with 
                    Arlo and wait for the ambulance.

                                  BOYD
                    Either I go with you or I go on my 
                    own, but I am going to face my 
                    father.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I m not going to be a party to your 
                    revenge--

                                  BOYD
                    You go in alone, you die, Ava dies.  
                    You know he has no intention of 
                    letting her live.

                                  RAYLAN
                    She may already be dead.

                                  BOYD
                    I m afraid he would have far darker 
                    plans than that.

                    How many men does he have?

                                  BOYD
                    You got Heckle and Jeckle.  That 
                    leaves Hestler, Rufus and Johnny.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Any of them good with a gun?

                                  BOYD
                    Not as good as you.

      They drive in silence for a moment.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You were telling the truth -- your 
                      conversion and all.

                                  BOYD

                    I do.

                                  BOYD
                    Tell me about your God.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I think that s about the most 
                    private thing in a man s life.

      Another beat of silence.

                                  BOYD
                    I set this in motion, didn t I?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Actually, me shooting Tommy Bucks 
                    had a lot to do with it, too.

                    I ll approach them straight up 
                    front.  You make your way around 
                    back.  If you can get Ava out, do 
                    it, and don t worry about me.

                                  BOYD
                    I need a gun.  

      Raylan looks at Boyd.  Boyd looks back.  

                                  RAYLAN
                      Understand, Boyd.  You take 
                    advantage of this situation, I ll 
                    hunt you down like a dog.  If I m 
                    not dead.  And you re not dead. 

                                  BOYD
                    I d deserve no better.  

      Raylan reaches under the seat for a backup piece, tosses it 
      out the window.  

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    You afraid you give me a gun I d 
                    turn it on you?

      Raylan doesn t answer.  

      Boyd exits the car.  Raylan drives off.  Boyd lights off into 
      the woods, angling uphill. 

      EXT. CABIN - EARLY MORNING2727

      Bo stands outside with Rufus.  Raylan pulls up, steps out of 
      the car.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Bo.

                                  BO
                    Raylan.

      Raylan puts his arms out to the side while Rufus disarms him, 
      takes his primary gun out of his holster, takes the back-up 
      off his ankle.

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    Yeah -- make sure you get that back-
                    up.  Can t trust this one with a 
                    cap gun.

                    Yeah, I m sure you re all torn up 
                    inside.

                    Won t pretend I d throw myself on 
                    top of your coffin, but all this 
                       we-want-him-alive  shit -- that 
                    ain t me.

                                  RAYLAN
                    So, how do we do this?

      I/E. BEHIND CABIN/INSIDE CABIN - MORNING - SAME TIME2828

      Boyd creeps up to a window at the back, looks in.  

      Ava s tied up in the corner of a room at the front.  Hestler 
      has his back to Boyd -- he s watching Raylan, Bo and Rufus 
      out the front window.

      Boyd hears Raylan talking with Bo.

                                  BO (O.S.)
                    I d just kill you quick if I could.

      Boyd smashes the back window.  Hestler turns, fires.  Boyd 
      shoots, gets Hestler in the chest.

      Ava looks at Boyd through the shattered window.

      EXT. CABIN - FRONT - SAME TIME2929

      As Bo and Rufus turn toward the shot, Raylan grabs the gun 
      Rufus is holding, turns it into Rufus s chest and pulls the 
      trigger twice.   

      Bo turns to shoot Raylan, but Raylan kicks the gun from Bo s 
      hand, takes the gun from the dying Rufus and levels it at 
      him.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Alright, Mr. Crowder.  Hands behind 
                    your back.  

      At that moment, the cabin door opens, and Boyd steps out.   
      His gun levelled, he waves Raylan back. 





                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    39.

                                  BOYD
                    Raylan, need you to move away from 
                    my father.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    You don t want to do this, Boyd.  

                                  BOYD
                    It isn t something I want to do, my 
                    friend.  It s something I have to 
                    do.  Step back. 

      Raylan takes a step back, but aims his gun at Boyd.  

                                  BO
                    You didn t come to save my ass, did 
                    you, son?

                                  BOYD
                    No, Daddy, I did not.  

                                  BO
                    Gonna shoot me, that it?

      Boyd doesn t look like he s sure himself.  

                                  BOYD
                    Maybe.  

                                  BO
                    Don t seem right.  I had a chance 
                    to kill you, and didn t.  

                                  BOYD
                    Well, that s where you re wrong.  

                                  BO
                    Marshal, he look dead to you?

                                  BOYD
                    There s more than one way to kill a 
                    man.  You can kill his body.  Or 
                    you can kill the spirit within.  

      Bo looks at him, puzzled.  

                                  BO
                    You gonna pull the trigger?  Or you 
                    figure on talkin  me to death?  

      BANG!  A hole appears in Bo s chest.  It didn t come from 
      Boyd.  Bo falls back to the ground. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    40.

      Raylan and Boyd exchange a look.  GUNFIRE erupts from the 
      trees around the cabin.  

      Raylan grabs his guns from dead Rufus, bullets zipping by 
      him.  

      Boyd looks down at his fallen father, and in that moment of 
      hesitation, a bullet rips into his shoulder.  

      Raylan grabs Boyd s shirt, pulls him into the cabin with him 
      and slams the door.

                    Wouldn t go that far.  *

      Raylan takes up position beside the window looking out over *
      the porch.  She tends to Boyd s shoulder wound.  *

                                  BOYD*
                    If Raylan had come alone, my daddy *

                    And you couldn t let that happen.  *

      Boyd shakes his head.  A look between them.  He could still *
      be full of shit, but right now, she isn t really sure.  *
      Raylan clocks their look, then checks his cell phone.*

      Raylan takes a look.  He sees an SUV parked where the road *

      Raylan takes a quick look out the window.*

      a tree.*

      EXT. BEHIND THE SUV - SAME TIMEA31A31

      Ernesto and Pilar are behind the SUV with AKs.  Pilar motions 
      to ANOTHER GUN THUG behind a tree -- go around.  The gun thug 
      takes off running.

      INT. CABIN - DAYB31B31

      Ava wraps a strip of cloth around Boyd s wound.

      EXT. THE WOODS - SAME TIME3333

      The gun thug is running, keeping low, rifle in hand.  

      EXT. BEHIND THE CABIN - CONTINUOUS3434

      The gun thug approaches the cabin from behind, moving quickly 
      and quietly, heading for the broken window.  He hears gunfire 
      coming from the front of the cabin.

      The gun thug creeps up to the window and looks inside.

      GUN THUG POV:  The room is empty.

      INT. CABIN - BACK ROOM - SAME TIME3535

      ANGLE ON GUN THUG at the window.  BOOM DOWN to reveal Raylan, 
      hiding below the window.

      The gun thug quietly leans his rifle against the woodpile at 
      the back of the cabin, then ever-so-silently starts to lift 
      up the window.

      Raylan looks up, sees the hands sliding up the window.  
      Raylan puts his pistol up and fires twice.

      The gun thug flops back, dead.

      INT. CABIN - DAY3636

      Raylan crouch-runs back to his spot by the front window, 
      calls out.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (to Pilar and Ernesto)
                    Whoever s out there, I got your man 
                    coming around back.  That leaves 
                    three of us and two of you.

      EXT. BEHIND THE SUV - CROSSCUT3737

      Ernesto and Pilar, ready with their AKs.  They share a look.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You start walking, we ll hold our 
                    fire.

      Ernesto aims the AK over the SUV and fires wildly, shredding 
      the cabin.

      Raylan and Boyd exchange a look.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    You didn t happen to bring another 
                    rocket launcher...?

      Boyd grins ruefully, shakes his head.

                                  PILAR
                    All we want is Raylan Givens.

                                  RAYLAN

                    No, I m Raylan Givens.

      Raylan and Boyd exchange a look.

                                  PILAR
                    That supposed to be funny?

                                  RAYLAN
                    A little.

                                  PILAR
                    We get Givens, the other two can 
                    walk.

      Raylan checks his ammo -- half a clip.  

                                  RAYLAN
                          (to Ava and Boyd)
                    I need you two to get out the back 
                    and run.

                                  BOYD
                    They killed my daddy.  I ain t

                    You came here to kill him yourself.

                                  BOYD
                    That s different.

                                  RAYLAN
                    How?

                    I need to keep them here, give you 
                    a chance.  We all stay here, with 
                    night falling, we re dead.  This is 
                    the only way it works.

                                  BOYD
                    How about I stay?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Boyd, I need you to get Ava out of 
                    here.

      A look between the two old friends.  Boyd nods.  Boyd goes to 
      Ava, pulls her to the back room.

      Raylan and Ava look at each other as she goes.

      EXT. BEHIND THE CABIN - DAY3838

      Boyd helps Ava climb out the back window.  They see the dead 
      gun thug.  And his rifle leaning up against the woodpile.

      INT. CABIN - DAY3939

      Raylan loads the clip of his gun with his last six bullets.

                                  RAYLAN

                    How about this?  I ll come out 
                    unarmed and you step out unarmed 
                    and we ll talk.

                                  PILAR
                    Okay.

      Pilar turns to Ernesto.

                                  PILAR (CONT D)
                          (quiet)
                    The second he s clear, shoot him.  
                    In the gut.  Maybe we can get him 
                    to Gio before he dies.

      Ernesto nods.  Pilar leans her AK against the bumper of the 
      SUV.

      Raylan opens the cabin door and steps out, his hands empty, 
      pistol tucked down the back of his belt.

                                  RAYLAN
                    My hands are empty.

      Pilar appears, her hands up.

                                  PILAR
                    Me, too.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Where s your friend--?

      Ernesto swings into sight with his AK.  Before he can shoot -- 
      BANG! -- he s hit in the leg.  The shot came from...

      Boyd, in the woods, crouched by a tree with the gun thug s 
      rifle.  

      Ernesto spins to shoot at Boyd.

      Raylan shoots Ernesto and Ernesto falls.

      Pilar grabs her AK and fires bursts at Raylan and Boyd as she 
      gets in the SUV and drives off.

      Raylan takes a shot at the SUV, blows out the back window.  
      The SUV speeds off. 

      Boyd comes out of the woods, holding the rifle.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)

                                  BOYD
                    I ll get her.

      Raylan stops, looks at Boyd.  Boyd is now loosely aiming the 
      rifle at Raylan.

                                  RAYLAN
                    What re you gonna do after you

                    I haven t figured that out yet.
                    You gonna shoot to stop me?

      Boyd starts moving toward Raylan s car.

                                  RAYLAN
                    If I have to.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You bet your life on that?

      Boyd tosses the rifle into Raylan s car.

                                  BOYD
                    No, Raylan, I m betting my life on 
                    you being the only friend I have 
                    left in this world.

      The two men look at each other. 

      Boyd gets in Raylan s car, starts the engine, throws the car 
      into reverse and backs away.

      CLOSE ON RAYLAN.

      CLOSE ON BOYD.

      Raylan doesn t fire.

      Boyd throws the car into drive and takes off down the road.

      Raylan watches him go.  Ava comes out of the woods, joins 
      Raylan.
