    We are down low to the ground on Burt as he watches a potato
      chip pass through frame.  Jimmy watches from nearby, cutting
      a black and white cookie in half. 

                                    BURT
                    Can you imagine what it's like to be
                    an ant?  It's like you and ten of
                    your buddies pick up a potato chip
                    to bring it back to your ant family
                    so everyone can eat.  And it takes
                    you like three hours to get it from 
                          (pointing a few feet
                          away)
                    over there to over there.  And then
                    some jerk comes along and...

      Burt flicks the potato chip which sails a few feet away.

      Jimmy hands Burt the chocolate half of the cookie.

                                      JIMMY
                    Here's your half of the cookie.

                          the ants)
                    Thanks for the show, boys.

      A clean, new van pulls up nearby.  The side of the van reads
      "Green Thumb Landscaping" and has a logo of a giant green
      thumb.  Behind it arrives a Hummer with the same logo on it.      Raising Hope         1ARY05       "The Sniffles"4.

                    Oh God, look who it is. 

      GREEN THUMB, an arrogant looking man, older than Burt, dressed
    in Ed Hardy clothes and wearing a bluetooth headset, gets
      out of the Hummer.  He blows a whistle at several workers*
      who hop out of the van in matching jump suits, and begin
      taking out gear, strapping on blowers, etc.  Green Thumb
      approaches.

                    You mow the lawn here?  I thought
                    this house was abandoned.

      Burt rolls his eyes.

                                      GREEN THUMB (CONT'D)
                    Check this out.  I got a new tattoo.

      Green Thumb holds up his right thumb which is tattooed green.

                                    BURT
                    Is that really a tattoo, or has it
                    been up your nose too long?

      Burt looks at Jimmy and laughs.  Jimmy forces a laugh to
      support Burt.

                    I thought you were going to put me
                    out of business.  How long ago was
                    that, Burt?

                    Your daddy ever tell you what he

                    He said "shave it."

                                    BURT
                    I meant "shove it."

                                      GREEN THUMB
                    You know, the parks contract is up
                    for grabs again.  I noticed you don't
                    even put in a bid anymore.  I used
                    to love beating you out for those.

                                    BURT
                    I don't need any city contracts.  I
                    don't need the hassle.
                          (putting his arm around
                            Jimmy)
                    My son and I got a nice thing going
                    with our two-man crew.

      Green Thumb blows his whistle.  One of his employees runs
      over and shades him with an umbrella. 

                                      GREEN THUMB
                    Yeah, having a big crew sucks.  Gotta
                    go.

      Green Thumb and his umbrella holder head off toward his crew.

                                    BURT
                          (lamely)
                    Yeah, gotta go stick your thumb back
                    up your nose.

      Jimmy forces a laugh to support his dad when his cell phone
      rings.  He looks at the caller ID.

                    It's Hope's day care.

                    Hello?

      Jimmy sits in the same lawn where he and Burt were eating
      lunch at the beginning of the show.  He finishes his lunch
      and pulls out a black and white cookie from a pink bakery
      box.  Jimmy grabs his knife and cuts it.  He starts eating
      his half, then looks down at the other half.  After a beat,
      Jimmy starts to pack up his stuff.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      We're in a parking lot near a sign that reads "Umstead Park". 
      Jimmy gets out of his van with his bakery box and looks around
      for his dad.  He hears a mower on the other side of a
      building.  He rounds the building and discovers Burt, in a
      Green Thumb uniform, pushing a mower.  Several other Green
      Thumb workers work nearby.  One of them holds an umbrella
      over Green Thumb, as he approaches Burt.      Raising Hope         1ARY05       "The Sniffles"27.

                    This area isn't done yet?  You're 
                    too slow, Chance.  Get on the 
                    umbrella.  Let Brian show you how 
                    it's done.

      Burt switches places with Brian, the worker holding the 
      umbrella.

                                      GREEN THUMB (CONT'D)
                    No no no no.  You're not supposed to 
                    hold the umbrella over both of us.  
                    You haven't earned your shade.  

      Burt moves out from under the umbrella.  At this point, Burt
      sees Jimmy watching in frozen horror.  They stare at each
      other.  After a beat, Burt takes off running, still carrying
      the umbrella.  He goes and goes, occasionally looks back at
      Jimmy, then keeps going.  We stay on him in a wide shot as
    he gets smaller and smaller and smaller.

                                                                                FADE OUT:
