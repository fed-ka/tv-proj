                    When it came to shopping, Gabrielle 
                    Solis considered herself a 
                      professional.

                    So when the time arrived to purchase 
                    her first baby, Gabrielle felt more 
                    than up for the task.

      Mr. Beale hands Gabrielle a folder.

                                  MR. BEALE
                    ... You're going to love her. She's 
                    healthy, she's got a bubbly 
                      personality, and she's smart as a 
                    whip. Went to grad school, in fact.

                                  CARLOS
                    Terrific. Where do we sign?

      Gabrielle looks at Carlos warily.

      Back to Gabrielle, Carlos and Mr. Beale.

                                  MARY ALICE (V.O.)
                    So Gabrielle worried that when it came 
                    to buying a baby, Carlos wouldn't be 
                    any different.

      The DOORBELL RINGS.

                                  CARLOS
                    That must be her. 

      They all cross to the door. Before Carlos opens it...

                                  CARLOS (CONT'D)
                          (to Gaby)
                    Honey, this is a big moment for us. 
                    When I open this door, we're going to 
                    be looking directly at our future.

      Gabrielle smiles. Carlos opens the door to reveal DEANA, an 
      extremely unattractive pregnant woman. Gabrielle's smile 
      freezes in horror. DH217     "Could I Leave You?"    (WHITE FULL)    02/02/06       3.




      Gabrielle and Carlos sit across from Mr. Beale and Deana. 
      Gabrielle's horrified smile is still frozen in place.

                                  DEANA
                    ... and I just love your home. I know *
                    it'll be a wonderful place for my baby 
                    to grow up.

                                  CARLOS
                    Thank you. And you won't find two 
                    other people who have more love to 
                    give a child than Gaby and me. Isn't 
                    that right, honey? 

      Carlos turns to Gabrielle for a response, but at the moment 
      she's too fixated on Deana. He nudges her.

                                  CARLOS (CONT'D)

                    Great. Carlos, will you help me in the 
                    kitchen, please?

      Gabrielle and Carlos enter. Her smile has disappeared.

                    Gaby, I can feel it -- that woman is 
                    going to give us her baby! Don't you 
                    just wanna scream?!

                    Listen, Carlos... I don't think we 
                    should be hasty here.

                    Well... she's the first woman we've 
                    met. I think we should slow down, meet 
                    some other women. 

                                  CARLOS 
                    Why? What's the point?

                    Okay, there's no easy way to say this, 
                    so I'm just gonna say it. Did you 
                    happen to get a good look at her?

                                  CARLOS
                    Omigod. Are you saying you don't want 
                    Deana's baby because she happens to be 
                    a little plain looking?

                                  GABRIELLE
                    I know, I didn't mean that. It's 
                    just... someone has to be realistic 
                    here. That woman's genes are going to 
                    pass down to her child and I don't 
                    think we're prepared for that. 

                                  CARLOS 
                    You are so shallow.

                                  GABRIELLE
                    I'm just thinking about the baby.

                                  CARLOS
                    And how do you figure that?

                                  GABRIELLE

      Carlos takes this in. As much as he doesn't like to hear it, 
      he know's there's a bit of truth to what she's saying.

      LYNETTE and VERONICA KAPLAN, a buxom knockout in an expensive 
      suit, sit across from one another. There s an open box of 
      donuts on the desk. Veronica finishes a DONUT. *

                                    LYNETTE
                    I m going to be honest. We want you 
                    here. Your experience and contacts 
                    would be invaluable to us.

                                  VERONICA
                    Thank you. 

                                    LYNETTE
                    That and you d make my job infinitely *
                    easier. 

                                  VERONICA
                    It s okay that I d only be available 
                      part-time?

                                    LYNETTE
                    Actually, that works perfectly with 
                    our budget. 

                                  VERONICA
                    Then I ll be honest too. I ve talked 
                    with several firms, but I ve narrowed 
                    it down to you and Zimms.  

      Suddenly PARKER appears at the door. 

                                    PARKER*
                    Hi, Mommy.  *

                                    LYNETTE *
                    Oh, Parker, honey, I m in a meeting. *

                                  PARKER
                    But I wanna be with you. 

                                  VERONICA
                    It s okay. We re moms first, 
                      executives second. 

      Lynette motions Parker over. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)DH217     "Could I Leave You?"    (WHITE FULL)    02/02/06       10.

                    But just for a little bit, then you 
                    have to go back to the daycare room, *
                    okay?  

      Parker climbs into Lynette s lap. Veronica splits the last *
      donut and hands half to Parker. She eats the other half.*

                                  VERONICA *
                    Here you go, Sweetie.  *
                          (to Lynette)*
                    He's adorable.*

                                  LYNETTE*
                    Okay, you gotta tell me your secret. *
                    How do you eat like that and keep your *
                    figure?*

                                  VERONICA*
                    It s the breastfeeding. Burns 500 *
                    calories a pop. It s like having a *
                    treadmill strapped to your chest. *

                    How many kids do you have?*

                                  VERONICA*
                    Just one - my baby Donovan. *

      Lynette sense this might be her  in. 

                                    LYNETTE *
                    You know, Veronica, this is very much *
                      a "pro-parent  office. When I was *
                    promoted, the first thing I insisted *
                    on was quality daycare. *
                          (off of Parker)
                      I couldn t imagine not being a part of 
                    this little guy s life. That s a 
                    choice you shouldn t have to make. 

                                  VERONICA
                      I completely agree. What about 
                      breastfeeding? That was also a bit of 
                    an issue at Powers and Harris.

                                    LYNETTE
                    We re moms first, executives second, 
                    right?

      Veronica smiles. Lynette's got her.*

      They shake. 

      Off Lynette, triumphant...*


      An AA MEETING is in progress. A table with DONUTS and COFFEE 
      is set up off to the side. Amongst the circle of chairs set 
      up for the meeting is BREE. She's busying herself with 
      knitting while the man next to her, WILLIAM, finishes 
      addressing the group.

                                    WILLIAM
                    ... and when I finally woke up, I was 
                    in the back of some alley, my wallet 
                    had been stolen, and I was lying in a 
                    pool of my own vomit. It was at that 
                    moment I knew I'd hit rock bottom. And 
                    I decided to never take another drink.

      The group, all wearing name tags, claps as William takes his 
      seat. PETER MCMILLIAN, a clean cut forty-year-old in khakis 
      and a button down shirt, who appears to be the leader of this 
      group, offers...

                                  PETER
                    Who's up next? Bree?

                                  BREE
                    Oh, I couldn't possibly top that. 
                    Thank you, though.

                                  PETER 
                    Okay.
                          (then)
                    Doris, how about you?

      A woman stands. Peter looks back at Bree, who remains stoic.


      Bree is at the refreshment table, looking over the donuts 
      with disdain. Peter walks up.

                                  PETER
                    Don't be shy. Have one.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)DH217     "Could I Leave You?"    (WHITE FULL)    02/02/06       12.

                                  BREE
                    Oh... I think I'll pass. I usually 
                    make mine from scratch. The trick is 
                    to not put in too much gluten.

                                  PETER
                    I'll keep that in mind.

      Bree notices spilled coffee and sugar on the counter, grabs a 
      napkin and starts to clean. 

                                  BREE
                    My goodness, substance abusers can be 
                    a messy bunch.

                                  PETER 
                    Well, people who come here tend to 
                    have the shakes.
                          (off her look)
                    It's a joke. Haven't you heard, drunks 
                    are hilarious... when we're not 
                    swimming in a pool of our own vomit, 
                    that is.

                                  BREE 
                    Good heavens. I don't know how you can 
                    all talk about those humiliating 
                    things in public.

                                  PETER
                    It's part of the process. We've all 
                    been there. Do you have a sponsor yet?

                                  BREE
                      A sponsor?

                                  PETER
                    When you get the urge to drink, it 
                    really helps to have someone to talk 
                    to. If you like, I could be that 
                    someone.

                                  BREE
                    Thanks, but I'm good.

                                  PETER
                    The last two guys I sponsored were ex-
                    cons. One had done five years for 
                    armed robbery. The other set houses on 
                    fire. It would be nice to sponsor 
                    someone who makes homemade donuts.

                                  BREE
                    Well, aren't you sweet?

                                  PETER
                    Go ahead. Take the card. Just in case. 

      Bree, gazing into his eyes, suddenly feels guilty. She looks 
      around to make sure they can't be heard, then leans in.

                                  BREE 
                    Can you keep a secret?

                                  PETER
                    Sure.

                                  BREE
                      I shouldn't really be here.

                                  PETER
                    Really? And why is that?

                                  BREE
                    Because I'm not an alcoholic. 

                                  PETER
                    You don't say.

                                  BREE
                    It's true. I'm only here because of my 
                    son. He's trying to take me to court 
                    so he can become an emancipated minor. 
                    And he's planning on lying to the 
                    judge and saying I'm some dreadful 
                    lush. So I'm coming to these meetings 
                    to give the impression I've changed.

                                  PETER
                    Ah. So... you don't want to give up 
                    drinking?

                                  BREE
                    Well, I have. Basically. That's why I 
                    know I'm not an alcoholic. When it 
                    comes to liquor, I really can take it 
                    or leave it.
                          (then)
                    Why are you smiling?

                                  PETER
                    Nothing. It's just... for someone 
                    who's not a drunk, you sure talk like 
                    one.

                    I'm sorry, but you're going to have to 
                    trust me on this. I'm not like the 
                    rest of you. I just don't have a

      donut.

                    Mrs. Solis, I'm doing my best to meet *
                    your standards, but you have to *
                      understand -- we're working in a grey *
                    area of the law here. *

                    So? *

                                  MR. BEALE*
                    So finding a gorgeous pregnant woman *
                    willing to give her baby to a couple *
                    with a criminal record isn't exactly a *
                    walk in the park.*

                                  GABRIELLE*
                    Isn't that why we're hemorrhaging *
                    money into your bank account?*

      Suddenly Mr. Beale's INTERCOM buzzes to life.*

                                    RECEPTIONIST'S VOICE (O.S.)*
                    Sir, a Libby Collins here for you.*

                                  MR. BEALE*
                    I'll be right there.*
                          (then, to Gaby and Carlos)*
                    I took the liberty of inviting this *
                    girl down to meet you. If you don't *
                    respond, well... I'm out of ideas.*

      Mr. Beale gets up and exits. Carlos turns to Gaby.*

                                    CARLOS*
                    Stop being so picky, will you? You're *
                    gonna blow this for us!*

                                  GABRIELLE*
                    We have to look at this kid's face for *
                    the next eighteen years, Carlos. It's *
                    not the time to skimp on quality. *

                                  MR. BEALE (O.S.)*
                    Mr. and Mrs. Solis, this is Libby.*

      Gaby's POV -- starts on a sexy pair of stilettos, moves up *
      past long, toned legs barely covered in denim shorts, over a *
      very pregnant stomach and big boobs, to finally land on a *
      very pretty face -- this is 25 yr old Libby, trashy but hot.*

      Gabrielle smiles, pleased.*

                                  GABRIELLE*
                          (sotto to Carlos)*
                    Now this I can work with.*

      As Gabrielle rises to greet Libby...*

      FADE IN:


      Libby shows baby pics to a rapt Gaby and Carlos. Beale sits.*

                                  LIBBY (O.C.)*
                    ... And this is me when I was five. I *
                    thought I was a mermaid. That's why my *
                    thighs are tied together. *

                                  GABRIELLE*
                    Aw...*

                                  LIBBY *
                    Yeah. Who woulda thought I'd end up *
                    catching dollar bills in 'em?*

      Libby laughs. Gaby and Carlos look surprised. Libby turns to *
      Beale.*

                                  LIBBY (CONT'D)*
                    You didn't tell them? *

                                  MR. BEALE*
                    I guess I forgot to mention it. *
                    Libby's an exotic dancer.*

                                  LIBBY*
                    You guys don't have a problem with *
                    that, right? *

      Carlos looks unsure. Gaby quickly jumps in.  *

                                  GABRIELLE*
                    Oh, no. God, no. Good for you. So *
                    how'd you get interested in that line *
                    of work? *

                                  LIBBY*
                    Well, I always used to dance in the *
                    state fair talent show and I was *
                    awesome on the monkey bars as a kid, *
                    so all the swinging around we do on *
                    stage comes real naturally to me. But *
                    now that I got the big belly, I've *
                    been doing more behind the scenes work *
                    at the club. Like costume design, *
                    music selection, choreography...*

                    That's wonderful. *

                                  LIBBY*
                    Thank you.*

                                  GABRIELLE*
                          (to Beale, enthusiastic)*
                    She's great. We're sold.*

                                  LIBBY *
                    Then I guess we should talk about how *
                    much money I want for my baby. *

                                  MR. BEALE*
                    Whoa, whoa, whoa. Nobody's "buying" a *
                    baby here, okay? That's illegal. You *
                    will make a list of expenses which the *
                    Solises will pay. They can also buy *
                    you gifts, that's perfectly legal.*

                    Money won't be a problem. *

                                  LIBBY*
                    That's good to know. I definitely want *
                    my daughter to have every opportunity.*

      Beat. Gabrielle and Carlos exchange an emotional look.*

                                    CARLOS*
                    It's a... girl? *

                          (nods, smiles)*
                    I just found out last week. *

                                  GABRIELLE*
                    Oh, Libby. That's perfect.*

                                  LIBBY*
                    Good. Well, my lunch break is almost *
                    over. I gotta get back to the club. *

      They all stand up. Libby shakes their hand.*

                                  LIBBY (CONT'D)*
                    It was really nice to meet you, Mr. *

                                  LIBBY*
                    What kind of name is that? *

                    Huh. I figured you were Italian. *

      Libby smiles politely and exits.*

      OFF an elated Gaby and Carlos...*


      Lynette is going over files with Veronica, who's eating a pop 
      tart. 

                                    LYNETTE
                    Great work on this Esposito proposal. *
                    We may actually get out of here while *
                    it's still light out. *

      Lynette's cell phone rings. She checks the caller I.D.

                                    LYNETTE (CONT'D)
                          (re: cell)
                    Sorry. 
                          (answers phone)
                    Hey, honey! How's the big apple? The 
                    guys like our pitch?

      Veronica notices something out the window. She rises.

                                  VERONICA
                          (whispers to Lynette)
                    My nanny is here with my son. I need 
                    to go breast feed.

                                    LYNETTE
                    Sure, sure. Go. Take your time.

      As Veronica exits...

                                    LYNETTE (CONT'D)
                          (into phone)
                    Really? You need to stay a couple more *
                    days?*

                          (then)*
                    No, I just didn't think it would take *
                    this long.*

      As Lynette listens to Tom, she casually looks over to see 
      Veronica meeting up with her NANNY and her "baby" -- a five 
      year old boy, DONOVAN, who gives Veronica a big hug. 
      Lynette's looks on puzzled.  

      As the Nanny gets back on the elevator, Veronica picks up the 
      BOY and they disappear into a nearby office. Before they 
      enter WE SEE Veronica UNBUTTONING the top button of her 
      blouse. Lynette's eyes go wide.

                                    LYNETTE (CONT'D)
                    Uh... Tom? I'm gonna have to call you 
                    back.

      Lynette hangs up. In disbelief, she stealthily makes her way 
      out into the BULLPEN, and to the office where Veronica 
        disappeared. At first she can't see inside -- the blinds are 
      shut. But as she moves across the window, she finds a large 
      GAP in the blinds. 

      Lynette's POV: Veronica's blouse is open; the only thing 
      obstructing the view of her bosom is the kid standing in 
      front of her, having lunch.

      Lynette is mortified. As she looks on, PAT walks by and 
      notices Lynette peering into the office. When she looks in, 
      she reacts, surprised.

      From the other direction, Ed also walks up, curious as to 
      what they're looking at. When he looks in...

                                  ED
                    Omigod!

      With that, Veronica looks up. Lynette, Pat and Ed immediately 
      disperse in opposite directions. *

                    lately they've been getting kind of *

      He kisses her on the forehead and exits.*


      Bree motions to Gabrielle and Lynette, Karl is coming. They *
      scatter to the kitchen, Bree with her muffins in tow.*


      Karl rounds the corner to the kitchen, finds the women *

      Lynette, Ed, Veronica and a few other people are having a 
      meeting as they eat lunch. Veronica is eating a large double 
        cheeseburger and fries. 

                                    LYNETTE
                    I don t know if everyone heard, but 
                    the people at Esposito loved *
                      Veronica s proposal. 

      We hear,  Nice job.   Good work.   That s huge. 

      Donovan enters and walks over to Veronica. He tugs on her 
      skirt.

                                    DONOVAN

                    a second. 

      Lynette and Ed nod politely. Veronica and Donovan leave the 
      room. The minute they re gone, Ed shoves his food aside.

                                  ED

                    Get rid of her? But she's great. And *
                    anyway we can't fire her. She could *

                    goes in there, I can picture what s

      Bree walks down the hallway carrying a TRAY OF FOOD. She 
      stops in front of Andrew's closed door, smooths her skirt 
      with her free hand and knocks.

      A beat. Andrew answers the door with a scowl and Bree pushes 
      past him all smiles, heads for MR. BORMANIS who sits on 
      Andrew's bed, papers spread out before him. She sets down the 
      tray of finger sandwiches and fruit punch next to him.

                                  MR. BORMANIS
                    Wow. Thank you for the refreshments, 
                    Mrs. Van de Kamp. That's very kind of 
                    you under the circumstances.

                                  BREE
                    Don't mistake my politeness for 
                    approval. I'm appalled you're helping 
                    my son with this ridiculous 
                      emancipation scheme. But, you're also 
                    a guest in my home, and guests get 
                      sandwiches.

                    You could have saved yourself some 
                    work if you'd let me meet my lawyer at 
                    his office.

                                  BREE
                    You're grounded. You're lucky I'm 
                    letting you have a guest at all.

                                  ANDREW
                    Once I'm emancipated, you'll never be 
                    able to ground me again.

                                  BREE
                    And if you lose, I'll ground you 
                    forever, in which case you won't be 
                    seeing anyone for a very long time.

      Bree turns and leaves. As soon as the door is closed, Mr. 
      Bormanis reaches for one of the sandwiches.

                                  MR. BORMANIS
                    She's tough.

                    We're not going to lose, are we?

                                  MR. BORMANIS
                      I certainly hope not.

                                  ANDREW
                    If we do, she'll own me.

                                  MR. BORMANIS
                    Well unfortunately, she presents 
                    herself well. She's smart, articulate, 
                    and dresses great. The judge will love 
                    that. And since she joined AA, the 
                    drinking isn't quite the silver bullet 
                    it was. So, it's gonna be tough, but 
                    maybe something else will drop into 
                    our lap.

                                  ANDREW

                                  LYNETTE*
                    Of course. And, y'know, I hate that I *

                    Is there anyway you could breastfeed *

                    It's not the same. The act of *
                      breastfeeding nurtures an attachment *
                    that a bottle just can't provide.*

                    I know. I breastfed every one of my *

                    No! No I will not sit here and be *
                    judged. I breastfeed because it is the *
                    right to do. Breast milk boosts the *
                    immune system, it s easier to digest *
                    and it s loaded with vitamins. You *

                    I m serious! Don t come near me.

      Andrew pulls away.

                    I can t help it. My memories are

                    What memories?

                                  ANDREW
                    The things you used to do to me.

      Justin comforts Andrew.

                    Hey, man. It s okay.

      Andrew glares defiantly at his mother.

                                  ANDREW
                      I remember what I remember. And every 
                    day more details come back to me. But 
                    we can talk about it more in court

      Justin and Andrew move off. Bree notices Tish staring at her

                    Yeah.

      Tish turns and leaves, a bit too eager to get away. Bree 
      turns and walks over to the bar.

      Off her troubled face...


      It's late, the mall mobs have dwindled and Bree has just 
      finished her last glass of wine from an empty bottle on her 
      table. She sets it down forlornly, stands up drunk.

      She staggers down an aisle of the WOMEN'S SECTION, leans 
      against the RACK OF GOWNS from earlier to try and stop her 
      spinning head. 

      Then, she grabs one of the gowns and staggers towards the 
      WOMEN'S DRESSING ROOMS.

      FADE IN:


      Karl puts dessert out on a tray as Ron enters and puts dishes *
      in the sink. He runs the water. After a beat, Ron looks down *
      and reacts to WATER seeping out from under the cabinet.*

                                  DR. RON*
                    What the hell? *

      Ron opens the cabinet to reveal WATER SPRAYING from the pipe. *
      He quickly shuts the cabinet.*

                    We ve got a leak!*

      Karl grabs some towels from above the washer. *

                                  KARL*
                    I ll sop up the water. The guy across *

                    Okay. Be right back.*

      Ron hurries out just as Susan rolls into the living room. She *
      sees Ron running down the driveway.  *

                                  SUSAN*
                    Where s Ron going?*

      Susan fumbles to open the front door, navigating around her *
        wheelchair.*


      Mike gathers up his tools. Dr. Ron seems agitated.*

                                  DR. RON*
                    So... Mike. Have you known Susan long? *

                                  MIKE*
                    A year and a half. We actually dated *

                    Really. That s very interesting.*
                          (then)*
                    Can you excuse me, please?*

      Mike watches Ron hurry out, puzzled.*


      CLOSE ON Bree sleeping. She opens her eyes groggily, tries to 
      focus, then sits up straight. PULL OUT TO REVEAL a disheveled 
      Bree splayed out on a bench in a DRESSING ROOM with the gown 
      half way on. She rubs her eyes, looks around confused. Then, 
      she peeks her head out the door. It's eerily quiet.

      Bree stumbles to her feet and walks out of the dressing room. 
      Bree's POV: a dark and empty store. Off Bree, panicking. 
      She's trapped.


      Bree, still in the gown, tries to lift the gate in the front 
      of the store, but ends up falling backward. 


      Bree running through the store.


      Bree throws herself against a locked loading dock door. It 
      won't budge. 


      Bree slumps against the wall, exhausted and miserable. She 
      thinks for a moment. Who can she call? Finally, she pulls out 
      her CELL PHONE and fishes around for Peter's BUSINESS CARD. 
      She takes a deep breath, catching a glance of herself in the 
      mirror. She looks horrible, begins to strip out of the gown 
      as she dials...


      Peter is asleep in his bed when his phone RINGS. He fumbles 
      for it.

                                  PETER
                    Yeah?

                          (beat)
                    How are you?

      Peter reaches to turn on a lamp and checks his alarm clock.

                                  PETER
                    I'm sorry, but it's four in the

                    to and... you said to call anytime.

      Off Bree, struggling to fight back tears, we CUT TO --


      Bree and Peter enter the kitchen to find Andrew pouring 
      himself a bowl of cereal.

                                  ANDREW
                    Wow. Late night?

                                  BREE
                    Andrew, this is Peter, my sponsor from

                    son, Andrew.

      Andrew nods his head in acknowledgement of Peter.

                    So you sticking it to my mom or what?

      Peter gives Andrew a wry smile; unruffled by the hostility.

                    Don't worry. We drunks are all about

                    So mom, your lawyer called. I guess 
                    there's been a new development. He 
                    wants you to call him back as soon as

      on the table in front of her.*

                                  CLUB OWNER*
                    Hey, Martha Graham, they ain't paying *
                    for the footwork. *

      He leaves. Libby shoots him a dirty look, gets up and starts *
      to wipe down the tables, still watching Cecile. *

                                  CECILE
                    So I could try the Hanging Serpent but *
                    I've had that vertigo ever since my *

                    Just take off your clothes, okay?

                                  CECILE 
                    Will do, Libby.
                          (to someone behind Libby)
                    Wow. That s a kickin  dress.

      Libby turns to find -- Gabrielle, dressed to the nines. 
      Gabrielle smiles sweetly at Cecile.

                                  GABRIELLE
                    Thanks, sweetie. I clean up well for a

      Libby and Gaby sit in front of the vanity mirrors. Gaby s 
      smiling tightly, clearly trying to rein in her anger.

                    Look, it s not like I have anything 
                    against your people, I just don t want 
                    my daughter to become Mexican.

      Libby looks at the number. Her eyes widen.*

                    trumps everything.

      Gaby pulls out her checkbook.

                                  GABRIELLE (CONT D)
                    So how much is it gonna take?

      Gabrielle slams the checkbook down in frustration.

                                  GABRIELLE
                    Okay, I'm sorry -- you wanna talk *

      Lynette is walking past the daycare when she notices Donovan 
      on his way out of daycare. In the BG the Daycare worker has 
      her back turned as she helps another child.

                    Hey, Donovan. Where you off to?

      OF CHOCOLATE MILK on a table, right inside the doorway. *
      Parker, Porter and Preston are drinking chocolate milk and 
      eating graham crackers in the BG. Lynette reaches over and 
      grabs a carton of chocolate milk.

      An empty corner of the hallway. Lynette looks around, to make 
      sure no one is coming. She s got the small carton of

      to Donovan.

      Donovan rushes the counter and grabs the chocolate milk, as

                                  BETTY (CONT D)*
                    Do you understand? Nod to show me you *
                      understand.*

      Caleb does nothing.*

                                  BETTY (CONT D)*
                          (deliberate)*
                    Caleb. Nod, to show me, you *
                      understand.*

      Caleb nods, but his expression doesn t change.*

                                  BETTY (CONT D)*
                    You have to accept that your life -- *
                    and my life -- won t be the same as *
                    other people s. It s just going to be *
                    me and you, Caleb. Just the two of us, *
                    together, for the rest of our lives.*

      Betty stands, tries to smile.*

                                  BETTY (CONT D)*
                    Now, I m going to go upstairs and *
                    bring down some ice cream for you. How *
                    does that sound?*

      Silence. Betty hesitates, smile fading, then goes up the *
      stairs. We stay TIGHT on Caleb s expressionless face. As his *
      mother leaves, his expression turns to one of pent-up anger. *
      The CAMERA TILTS DOWN to show that his HANDS HAVE BEEN *
      SHACKLED. Nod all he wants, Caleb is not  accepting  of this. *
      In fact, he looks like a time bomb about to explode...*


      Lynette is working at her computer. Parker appears at her 
      door, holding a PUZZLE box. *

                                  PARKER
                    I don't wanna do this puzzle myself.

                                    LYNETTE
                    Well, why don't you find someone to 
                    put it together with you.

                                  PARKER
                    I want you to do it with me.

                    Honey, we've been over this. I've got 
                    work to do. Go play with the other 
                    kids in day care.

                                  PARKER
                    Can't I stay here with you?

      A beat while Lynette takes in her son's imploring look. 
      Finally...

                                    LYNETTE
                          (firm)
                    No. I love you, but no. Now go. 

      Parker drags his feet out of the office, disappointed. Off 
      Lynette...*

                    All relationships in life are bound by 
                    a cord and as they grow... the cord 
                    must be cut.*


      Bree is cleaning out one of the closets. *

                                  MARY ALICE (V.O.)
                    But sometimes, you're simply not ready 
                    to sever the tie that binds you...

      She finds an old CLAY MOLD OF HER HAND NEXT TO ANDREW'S BABY *
      HAND.


      Susan sits at the table with a cup of coffee.*

                                  MARY ALICE (V.O.)
                    ... because you don't want to lose the 
                      relationship you once had.

      A PLUMBER works under the sink. He pulls out to reveal a *
      MIDDLE AGED GUY who looks nothing like Mike Delfino. Susan *
      watches sadly.*


      FRANK, a dangerous-looking guy, strolls into the strip club. *
      He passes one of the strippers, smiles, and pats her 
      dangerously close to her behind. The Club Owner starts coming *
      toward him.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)DH217     "Could I Leave You?"    (WHITE FULL)    02/02/06       63.

                                  CLUB OWNER*
                    Frank. No touching the girls.   

      Frank puts his arms up.

                                  FRANK
                    I m just here to say hi to my 
                      girlfriend.

      Frank moves away from the Club Owner and heads over to one of *
      the tables. Libby approaches with a glass of SCOTCH for him. *
      She slams it down angrily.*

                                  FRANK (CONT'D)*
                    Aw, come on, baby. I'm sorry about *
                    last night.*

                                  LIBBY*
                    I waited up. How much did you lose *
                    this time? *

      Frank puts his hand on her swollen belly. 

                                  FRANK *
                    I'm gonna be better when the baby *
                    comes, Lib. I'm gonna provide. I want *
                    my little girl to have everything.*

      CLOSE ON LIBBY as her thoughts drift elsewhere.

                                  LIBBY
                      I wouldn t worry about the baby, *
                    Frank. I have a feeling she s gonna *
                    lead a charmed life.

                                  MARY ALICE (V.O.)
                    Yes, there comes a time when we all 
                    must cut the cord that binds us to one 
                      another...

      LIBBY looks down at Frank, slowly removing his hand from her *
      belly.

                                  MARY ALICE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ... for better or for worse.*
