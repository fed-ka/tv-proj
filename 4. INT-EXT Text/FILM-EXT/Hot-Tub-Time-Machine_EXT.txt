BLUE SKIES. A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY DAY.
CAMERA PANS DOWN to reveal A HOT TUB FULL OF HOT CHICKS IN
BIKINIS. They splash about playfully. Then--
A FUCKING LION JUMPS IN THE HOT TUB!
As the girls SCREAM and scramble for safety, the BEAST ROARS
and it becomes the:
MGM LOGO
DISSOLVE TO:
Adam wheels his suitcase down the front path of this modest,
well-kept suburban home, as a recovered, dressed, embarrassed
and somewhat shell-shocked Lily follows with a small bag.
They both stop 10 yards short of a RANGE ROVER, where the
black man, NICK, waits in the car, waving.
LILY
I can't wait for you to come back
and marry me. Wow, that's crazy.
Adam looks almost like it just hit him.
7.
ADAM
Yeah.
(REALIZATION)
Wow.
LILY
Tell me again I have nothing to
worry about.
ADAM
Babe, look at Nick...
In the car, Nick air drums to whatever's on the radio.
ADAM (CONT'D)
You think with him in charge, we're
gonna get into any kind of trouble?
We'll probably eat too much pizza
and I'll twist my ankle getting off
the ski lift.
LILY
OK. Have an awesome bachelor
party. Not too awesome.
(hands him bag)
I got you something.
Adam looks in the bag.
ADAM
Sandwich. Thanks.
He puts it in his BACKPACK. She looks like she was expecting
a different reaction, but she lets it go. He kisses her.
LILY
Let me see your phone.
He takes it out.
ADAM
I told you, I'll call you when--
She snatches it out of his hands. Adam looks confused, as
she pockets the phone.
LILY
Despite my anxiety, I'm not gonna
be one of those women who wants an
update every ten minutes. Even
though I do want an update every
ten minutes.
Adam smiles. Lily looks a bit trepidatious.
8.
LILY (CONT'D)
Just make sure whatever happens,
you're back for the rehearsal
dinner.
(SHOWING CONCERN)
I totally trust you.
ADAM
You should. I'm a lame-o.
LILY
Well at least you're a cute lame-o.
Lily leans in and they NUZZLE their noses together in a
disgusting display of affection. A FLASH goes off.
From the car, Nick holds up his iPhone.
NICK
I'm more than willing to forget
about earlier, but this shit's
going on Facebook.
Nick's car pulls into the lot of a rundown motel.
Adam looks confused and slightly nervous.
ADAM
This looks like a place where
people die. Mostly from murder.
A BALD, miserable-looking GUY in his late 30s (LOU) exits a
room, carrying TWO SHOPPING BAGS. He gets in the back seat.
Adam looks happy to see him.
ADAM (CONT'D)
Lou!
LOU
Yes, I'm living in a transient
motel. Let's get that purple
elephant out of the room.
ADAM
Dude, it looks nice.
LOU
Thank you. I hate your guts.
ADAM
(re: the bags)
What'd you bring?
11.
LOU
All my belongings.
NICK
So you're sorta like a bum now,
huh?
LOU
In a sense.
Nick's car pulls up across from a nice apartment building, as
a well-dressed, well-groomed, overly polished-looking YOUNG
GUY in his 20s (JACOB) comes out, carrying a MESSENGER BAG.
Nick's car transitions from the HIGHWAY to the MOUNTAINS to
the WOODS, as we track the drive.
Finally, the car passes a "Welcome to Havenhurst" sign.
NICK
Gentlemen... welcome to Havenhurst.
ADAM
Yes!
The car winds through the main thoroughfare. Rather than a
quaint ski town, this place resembles a suburban nightmare,
with STRIP MALLS and CHAIN RESTAURANTS. It's the exact
opposite of the fun town we saw in Adam's photos.
The guys look out the windows, wearing bummed expressions.
JACOB
so this is the coolest town ever?
ADAM
Oh man. The Brew Haus is a PF
Chang's.
Lou notices a TGI Friday's, with a sign advertising a "Hannah
Montana 3-D Experience!" He looks utterly disgusted.
18.
LOU
I don't even have the heart to tell
you what I just fucking saw. But
say goodbye to Papa Enzo's. This
town sucks.
NICK
What the fuck is going on?
The car climbs a twisty part of the road.
NICK (CONT'D)
Please god let it still be there...
JACOB
What?
ADAM
Pink Paradise. Best strip club
ever.
The car rounds the corner and a SIGN comes into view. The
beginning reads "Pink."
NICK
Yes! It lives!
The car continues to climb and the whole sign comes into
view: "Pinkberry."
LOU
I wanna die.
JACOB
(OBLIVIOUS)
Sweet, there's a Pinkberry here.
The car pulls into the parking lot of this RUNDOWN lodge.
On a patio outside their suite, our guys stare at a KICK-ASS
TOP OF THE LINE HOT TUB. Spacious seating, plenty of jets,
underwater lighting. It's amazing.
Adam, Nick, and Lou look energized.
LOU
Thank. God.
ADAM
At least some things never change.
JACOB
What's the big deal about a hot
tub?
ADAM
Shame on you.
NICK
There's plenty of time for tubbin'.
Let's ski.
At the top of the mountain, Adam, Nick, and Lou look
ridiculous in TIGHT, RETRO-STYLE NEON SKI JUMPSUITS. Jacob,
on a snowboard, is the only one dressed in current attire.
JACOB
(re: their outfits)
When's the last time you guys
actually went skiing?
ADAM
It's been a few years.
NICK
I think we look good.
22.
JACOB
Then you're an idiot.
NICK
All right, we race down the
mountain. Loser buys first round.
Premium shit only.
JACOB
You gonna be all right?
NICK
What does that mean?
JACOB
I dunno - do black dudes ski?
NICK
Of course black dudes ski. Aren't
I wearing skis?
JACOB
I'm just not sure you're
representative.
NICK
You're calling me an Uncle Tom?
JACOB
I don't even know what that means.
NICK
It means black dudes ski.
(pulls down goggles)
Catch ya at the bottom.
Nick takes off and... gets about 15 FEET, before he hits a
GRASSY PATCH and falls over.
LOU
Black dudes don't ski.
ADAM
(MOCK YELLING)
How's the bottom?
CUT TO:
ADAM HITS A BAD PATCH AND FALLS DOWN.
CUT TO:
23.
JACOB AND LOU COLLIDE, BOTH TRYING TO AVOID A BARE PATCH.
CUT TO:
NICK PICKS UP SPEED, BEFORE HITTING A BARE PATCH AND FALLING.
A LITTLE OLD LADY SLOWLY SKIS PAST HIM, KICKING UP POWDER.
Nick wears his "going out clothes" and walks along the main
drag talking into his PHONE. It is clear that he is being
CONSTANTLY INTERRUPTED on the other end of the conversation.
NICK (ON PHONE)
No, the black ones... without the
pleats... Because the pleats make
me look fat... No, I put it on the
Amex... Because I'm the best man...
I know, but I'm organizing... I'm
gonna get cash fr-- I'm gonna get--
I'm gonna collect cash from the
guys... Yes... Yes... Yes.
(LONG PAUSE)
I love you too.
Nick hangs up and we see that Adam, Lou, and Jacob have been
walking with him, listening to his end of the conversation.
ADAM
(SYMPATHETIC)
Dude...
NICK
(CLAPS HANDS)
OK, who's ready to sink their teeth
into a delicious dinner?
Lou, Adam, and Nick all have HUGE SMILES, as they gaze at the
tub. They each hold a TON OF BOOZE.
Jacob looks indifferent and a little turned off by it all.
Lou strips down to his underwear and CLIMBS IN.
LOU
Oh my god. The water is perfect.
27.
He POURS A VODKA and SLAMS IT BACK.
Adam climbs in with Lou, pouring his own drink.
JACOB
I really don't see the appeal.
It's like a glorified bath.
NICK
Jacob. Son. The hot tub is the
whole thing! You ski all day.
Then you hit the town, get trashed,
and lure some fine ladies back to
the lodge for some good old
fashioned tubbin'.
Nick CRACKS A BEER and pats Jacob on the back.
NICK (CONT'D)
So the town's dead? Fine, we skip
that part and go right to the tub.
Trust me. If there's fun to be
had, the tub is a good start.
Nick gets in.
NICK (CONT'D)
Yes! It's amazing.
Now it's just Jacob outside the hot tub. The other three
guys are already starting to look more energized and happy,
splashing around. After another beat of consideration...
JACOB
Fuck it.
Jacob strips down and gets in. As he submerges, he actually
starts to loosen up a bit and smiles.
LOU
Well?
JACOB
I'm not convinced this is anything
more than a bath, but it's nice.
NICK
Hit him with some bubbles.
ADAM
Coming right up.
Adam CRANKS A KNOB. As the BUBBLES comes to life, we begin a
TUBBIN' MONTAGE over Reel 2 Real's "I Like to Move It."
28.
-- In the tub, the guys DRINK like fish, pouring various
combinations of VODKA, RED BULL, MOUNTAIN DEW, BACARDI, and
anything else they can get their hands on.
-- Jacob's LAPTOP is propped on the edge of the tub, playing
BETTER OFF DEAD. Every so often, one of our guys takes a
drink, playing a game, the rules of which only they know.
-- Adam takes a big bite of the SANDWICH Lily gave him.
-- Nick uses his iPhone to take video and pictures.
More drinking games. The guys wear funny HATS and roll
dice on a PIECE OF WOOD. Adam has to drink some tub water.
-- The guys keep reaching into ADAM'S BACKPACK for MIXERS.
-- Nick, Adam, and Lou LAUGH. Then, Lou lifts up Jacob's
head, which he has been FORCIBLY HOLDING UNDER WATER. Jacob
coughs and spits out water and looks pissed. Then he smiles
and helps submerge Nick's head in the same way.
-- Slam! Another bottle of vodka killed. Crush! Another
empty Red Bull his the patio.
-- A BEAR eats some DORITOS that have been left on a PICNIC
TABLE. Yards away in the tub, the guys laugh and taunt it.
-- Lou BLEEDS from where the bear has obviously SCRATCHED HIM
across the chest. Still, he dances in the tub.
-- Just for an instant (did we see that?), the guys are 3
BLACK GUYS and ONE WHITE GUY, before changing back.
-- The guys wear their SNOWSUITS in the tub. Adam very
dangerously jumps in, attached to a SNOWBOARD.
-- The CUTS get QUICKER and QUICKER, as hands reach into the
backpack. More vodka. More Dew. More Red Bull. More
Bacardi... The cuts SPEED UP and INTENSIFY until finally in a
BRILLIANT FLASH OF LIGHT, we
EXPLODE TO:
THE SUN RISING JUST ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS.
As the light of a new day spills into Havenhurst, we find all
four of our guys PASSED OUT in the hot tub, the water calm.
A KITTEN licks Lou's face. It's adorable. Until...
29.
Lou JOLTS AWAKE and PUKES ON THE KITTEN, sending it FLYING!
This wakes up everyone and they stir to life, inspecting the
carnage, mostly hangover-related.
NICK
Oh my god, I wanna die.
JACOB
I need a vitamin water.
Adam reaches in his backpack, taking out two choices.
ADAM
Red Bull or Fresca?
Jacob takes the Fresca, as Lou inspects the CLAW MARKS.
LOU
That fucking bear got me good.
ADAM
Yeah he did.
LOU
But we showed him, didn't we?
ADAM
If by showing him, you mean we
laughed and he got bored and
wandered off into the woods with
your sneakers, then yeah, we got
him good.
LOU
Fuck yeah.
Lou picks up Adam's half-eaten sandwich and takes a BITE.
ADAM
You just puked.
LOU
That's why I'm eating your
sandwich. I'm fucking starving.
NICK
Guys, look...
Their gaze turns to the MOUNTAIN PEAK, on which is a fresh
LAYER OF POWDER. It looks like perfect skiing conditions.
ADAM
Let's do it!
30.
As the guys walk across the front of the lodge, they pass
some well preserved CARS all parked together: a 1985 Pontiac
Fiero, a 1986 VW Golf, and a 1987 Ford Mustang coupe.
JACOB
What is this, a shitty car club?
The guys COMPLETELY MISS the BILLBOARDS ACROSS THE STREET:
-- "Coming soon: the most spaced-out Mel Brooks film yet!
SPACEBALLS!"
-- A surfing MAX HEADROOM with a CAN OF COKE and the tag:
"Catch the Wave!"
-- A bull terrier named SPUDS MCKENZIE parking with some HOT
BABES and a shitload of BUD LIGHT.
In QUICK CUTS, the guys hit the slopes:
-- In his ridiculous snowsuit, Nick skis down the mountain.
With the new snowfall, he expertly glides along.
-- Jacob applies some LIP BALM and flies down the mountain on
a SNOWBOARD. People glare at him with confused expressions.
-- Adam uses the snowplow method to slowly descend. He's a
beginner skier. He takes the time to look at the
surroundings and notices a YOUNGER, HOTTER CROWD skiing
today. Lots of BLONDE SKI BUNNIES wearing PASTEL colors.
ADAM
Well this place has improved.
-- In the lift line, Lou passes a GUY wearing a BIG HEADBAND.
LOU
Really, asshole?
At the top of the mountain, Nick looks WIDE AWAKE. Adam, on
the other hand, looks COKED OUT OF HIS SKULL. He sniffs,
fidgets, clenches his jaw, and looks generally "up."
NICK
Adam, you gotta chill. You just
did one line.
ADAM
I've never ridden the horse before.
NICK
You're not riding the horse. The
horse is heroin.
Adam can't stop moving and fidgeting.
ADAM
I don't know what kind of animal
I'm riding, but it's the best
animal of all time. I feel great!
Adam uses his SKI POLES to push off the top of the mountain
and he goes FLYING DOWN THE SLOPE.
NICK
Adam! Jesus.
Adam TUCKS down, still CLENCHING HIS TEETH. He PICKS UP
SPEED as he flies down the mountain like a racer.
FURTHER UP THE MOUNTAIN
Nick has to pull up and slow down in the name of safety.
34.
ON ADAM
He zips along, never changing course or slowing. He BARELY
MISSES a few TREES. But he can't stop himself before --
HE BARRELS INTO A SMOKING HOT CHICK!
The collision knocks Adam and the girl to the ground and
finally stops Adam's hyper-speed descent.
Adam gets up and shakes the cobwebs.
ADAM
What a rush!
He notices the girl on the ground and goes to help her up.
ADAM (CONT'D)
Oh wow, are you OK?
SMOKING HOT CHICK
No thanks to you, asshole!
IN SLOW MOTION --
The girl stands up in a very hot and awesome manner, SHAKING
THE SNOW from her luxurious blonde hair. It twinkles in the
sunlight. As she turns to face Adam,
NORMAL SPEED RESUMES. And he sees who it is:
ADAM
(MIND BLOWN)
Jennie O'Keefe!
Jennie squints at Adam, trying to place him.
JENNIE
Do I know you?
He stares at her, not believing what he's seeing. He still
looks loopy from the coke.
Just then, a a too-blond, mirror-sunglass-wearing, feathered
hair, striped-jumpsuited guy (BLAINE) SKIS UP and GRABS ADAM.
BLAINE
I'm gonna serve you a knuckle
sandwich, airhead.
(TO JENNIE)
You all right, babe?
JENNIE
I think so.
35.
Blaine's TOADIES (TAD and CHAZ) ski up behind him, as Blaine
ANGRILY RIPS Adam's lift ticket from his jacket.
BLAINE
Your lift ticket's been revoked.
Blaine throws it on the ground and laughs to his friends.
ADAM
(a la Lethal Weapon 2)
Diplomatic immunity.
Blaine looks confused, as Adam RIPS Blaine's lift ticket, but
he ends up RIPPING BLAINE'S JACKET too.
ADAM (CONT'D)
Sorry, I was trying to... you can
probably patch that up.
Blaine PULLS Adam close by the collar and clenches his fist.
BLAINE
You're dead meat, scumbag.
Just then, SNOW POWDER flies in Blaine's face. Blaine lets
go of Adam, as Jacob snowboards up and stops short, coming to
his brother's side.
JACOB
There you are! My brother's had a
few too many triple Venti nonfat
lattes if you know what I mean.
(genuine, to Adam)
Are you OK?
Adam nods. Blaine looks confused. CHAZ and TAD look
enamored with Jacob.
CHAZ
Dude, they let you bring a
skateboard on the mountain?
JACOB
It's a snowboard. You know - no
wheels.
TAD
Genius! Man, not to get all fag on
you, but I'm digging your fresh
threads, bro.
Adam and Blaine look equally confused with what's going on.
Jacob takes the compliment well, like he deserves it.
36.
JACOB
Thank you. It's mostly North Face.
A little EMS.
CHAZ
Whatever it is, it works.
TAD
Totally. What are you doing with
this boner? You should be skiing
with us. Like permanently.
Blaine looks really annoyed with his friends.
BLAINE
Guys!
TAD
I mean, that's if Blaine thinks
it's cool and everything.
Blaine takes a deep breath, annoyed.
BLAINE
(TO JACOB)
Get your spaz brother out of here.
And for his sake, I don't wanna see
him back on my mountain.
CHAZ
(EAGER)
You're welcome any time though!
Adam picks up his BACKPACK, which fell off during the
collision. He stares at Jennie again and smiles.
ADAM
You look JUST like this girl. I
had the biggest crush on her--
Blaine grabs the bag out of Adam's hand and SHOVES ADAM away.
BLAINE
This is mine now.
Adam looks at Blaine angrily, but Jacob holds him back.
JACOB
Come on. Let's just go.
Jacob ushers Adam off the slope, as Blaine shoulders the bag.
37.
A SECURITY GUARD escorts our guys out of the building.
ADAM
That went well.
Lou starts walking off by himself.
NICK
(TO LOU)
Where are you going?
Lou points to his watch.
LOU
Five o'clock. Happy hour.
The guys look at him, confused.
LOU (CONT'D)
If it's '87, the PF Chang's will be
gone, which means the Brew Haus
still stands.
(THEN)
It's Saturday. They have wet T-
shirt contests on Saturdays.
42.
The guys' eyebrows raise. After a moment:
ADAM
Well, maybe one drink. Just to
confirm.
All four guys soak in the tub. They TOAST with drinks.
ADAM
Here goes nothing!
They simultaneously DOWN their drinks. Nothing happens.
Like the chimps in 2001, each of them begins FIDDLING WITH
KNOBS and PUSHING ON LIGHTS, trying to find the magic button.
After a few moments:
NICK
Well, it was worth a shot.
ANGLE WIDENS to reveal other PEOPLE in the tub. A GUY AND
GIRL make out, two STONERS pass a joint, and one TOPLESS
CHICK just chills out.
LOU
(stares at girl)
I love this place.
As Lou pours himself another, Adam starts to lose it again.
ADAM
Guys, we're running out of ideas
here!
(MORE)
48.
ADAM (CONT'D)
I mean we tried the scientist, the
tub -- what the fuck do we do next?
Lou DOWNS ANOTHER SHOT and gets a crazy look in his eye.
LOU
I know what we do next.
CUT TO:
A DELOREAN is parked in the empty lot. Adam, Nick, and Jacob
look at it, drunkenly and bleary-eyed. Adam and Nick trade
swigs from a BOTTLE OF WHISKEY.
The gull wing door opens and Lou steps out, in a foul mood.
LOU
Rental car agency fucked us!
There's no flux capacitor.
Lou pulls Jacob over and straps him in the driver's seat,
before walking around to the passenger side.
LOU (CONT'D)
(to Adam and Nick)
We'll travel to 2010. Then one of
us will come back and get one of
you. And so on and so forth.
Adam and Nick watch the car pull out of the parking lot.
ADAM
(SOBERING SLIGHTLY)
This will not end well.
49.
Jacob and Lou hit the road, picking up speed. They pass a
COP, who pulls out, turning on his LIGHTS AND SIREN.
LOU
Oh shit, they found me! I don't
know how but they found me!
(LAUGHS)
I always wanted to say that. Punch
it!
Jacob HITS THE GAS.
LOU (CONT'D)
Let's see the look on this pig's
face when we hit 88 and disappear
into thin air! Yeah!
The SPEEDOMETER hits 75, 80, 85, and then 90. And then 95.
The car SHAKES VIOLENTLY.
LOU (CONT'D)
(SURPRISED)
This thing's a piece of shit.
Up ahead, the ROAD CURVES DRASTICALLY.
JACOB
Hey Lou?
LOU
Yeah?
JACOB
(VERY CALM)
We're doing a hundred. I can't
control this car.
LOU
(NODS)
I hear ya.
The Delorean BRAKES, but doesn't make the turn. It FLIPS
OVER in a fantastic disaster and comes to a stop in a DITCH.
The COP pulls over, gets out of his car, and DRAWS HIS GUN.
50.
Adam and Nick watch the accident from a distance.
ADAM
So do you think we should run away?
The guys have a COUPLE BOXES OF KITTENS. One at a time, they
get in the tub and take turns DIPPING THE KITTENS. When
nothing happens, Lou DUMPS an entire box of kittens into the
tub. The cats get ANGRY and CLAW AT HIS FACE and body.
Eventually, the guys just shake their heads.
ADAM
This isn't working.
LOU
Maybe these aren't the right
kittens?
Adam points at him in a "now you're thinking" way.
ADAM
We'll split up. Get as many
different cats as you can. Let's
all meet back here in an hour.
LOU
You can count on me!
Nick leaves a pet store, carrying a BOX OF KITTENS. On the
street, he accidentally bumps into one of the Japanese
businessmen from the night before. He has a THICK ACCENT,
like Gedde Watanabe in "Gung Ho."
NICK
Oh, sorry man.
(NOTICES HIM)
Hey! How's that iPod working out
for you?
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
Oh, it's a very nice toy.
NICK
If you like that, I've got a phone
back at the lodge that will knock
your socks off.
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
I wish I could see it. But I am on
my way to a very important business
meeting.
75.
NICK
Oh yeah? More important than
Bluetooth?
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
My associates and I are co-
financing a... how do you say it...
supermarket business.
NICK
(SUSPICIOUS)
You're not going to Boston, by any
chance?
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
Yes! Boston! We leave tonight.
NICK
You're gonna franchise out the
Gelman's Mom and Pop!
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
Yes! How do you know this?
Nick puts his arm around the guy and walks down the street.
NICK
Walk with me a minute. Let me tell
you about some companies you should
really be looking into...
A GUY and a GIRL are using the hot tub, which is still hot
and bubbly, despite the fact that it isn't plugged in.
Nick and Lou sit at the table, as Adam approaches with CATS.
ADAM
I got regular cats. I figured
maybe the kitten was a fluke.
Nick takes the box out of his hands and puts it down.
NICK
Come here.
He leads Adam near the tub, where Lou points at something.
LOU
There!
ADAM
What am I looking at? It's some
kind of stain.
LOU
Smell it.
ADAM
I'm not smelling it.
LOU
(NODS ENCOURAGINGLY)
Smell the stain.
Adam puts his nose up against the stain and SNIFFS. He
recognizes something, but can't put his finger on it.
ADAM
What is that?
NICK
Red Bull.
GUY IN TUB
Hey, you fellas mind? I'm trying
to get a handjob here.
Jennie instructs a group of TEENAGERS on the basics of
skiing, as Adam approaches, with Nick and Lou in tow.
79.
JENNIE
(CONCERNED)
You can't be here. If Blaine sees
you, he'll snap your neck. I told
him I blew you and he's not happy.
ADAM
Why would you do that?!
Behind Adam, Nick looks at the group of TEENS and his eyes
almost BUG OUT. He elbows Lou.
NICK
(whispers, teeth clenched)
Look.
Lou looks to where Nick is looking:
YOUNG ADAM, YOUNG NICK, and YOUNG LOU wait with other kids
for Jennie to return to their lesson.
LOU
Holy shit!
Lou immediately approaches the kids, even as Nick tries to
hold him back.
NICK
(TEETH CLENCHED)
where the fuck are you going?!
Lou walks right up to his YOUNGER SELF and looks himself
square in the face.
YOUNG LOU
What the hell do you want, old man?
Lou PUNCHES his YOUNGER SELF in the face. Young Nick and
Young Adam are freaked out, as is regular Nick. Adam doesn't
notice, as he's arguing with Jennie.
YOUNG LOU (CONT'D)
What the fuck, dude?! I think you
broke my nose! My parents are
gonna sue the shit out of you!
LOU
Herschel and Evelyn aren't gonna do
a damn thing. They're losers.
YOUNG LOU
How do you know my parents?
80.
LOU
Listen to me. Start putting
minoxidil on your scalp. Tonight.
Then, when Propecia comes on the
market, start taking it. Every
day. Hair is important.
YOUNG LOU
I don't give a shit about hair.
LOU
You will!
(leans in, quietly)
Or I'll tell everyone about how you
jerked off to that issue of
Playgirl.
YOUNG LOU
(QUIETLY)
It was confusing! There were naked
people and it had "girl" in the
title!
LOU
Hey, you don't have to justify to
me, pal.
YOUNG LOU
(FREAKED OUT)
Who are you?
LOU
I'm God.
ON ADAM AND JENNIE
JENNIE
Fine. You wanna see Blaine? It's
your funeral. He's in the
warehouse at the end of Lawrence.
Good luck.
Adam walks off the mountain with Nick and Lou.
LOU
Moment of truth.
Lou takes off his hat and feels his scalp - no hair.
81.
LOU (CONT'D)
(LOOKS BACK)
That fucker!
Just then, Lou's NOSE SLIGHTLY SHIFTS, the result of being
broken and never fixed. It stays this wa for the rest of
the movie.
Lou touches his nose.
LOU (CONT'D)
Oh, that's just great.
Jacob runs up, in a friendlier disposition.
JACOB
Hey guys!
ADAM
I thought you were with douche
patrol.
JACOB
Yeah I was. But it turned out
those guys are date rapists.
ADAM
Ah.
NICK
Adam, where are we going?
Adam gets a look of determination again.
ADAM
To get my bag. We get that, we
have the Red Bull, and our ticket
home.
LOU
Yes! The race is on!
ADAM
What race?
LOU
Duh, it's 1987? We're at a ski
resort?
(SHAKES HEAD)
Disputes like these are settled
with a downhill ski race. Usually
at dawn. It's the law.
82.
ADAM
You're an idiot.
Nick, Lou, and Jacob walk behind Adam, who looks pissed.
NICK
What are we gonna do?
LOU
That chick blew you?!
ADAM
(INTENSE)
I've got a race to win.
Europe's "The Final Countdown" begins playing over a MONTAGE:
-- Skis are sharpened.
85.
-- Gear is polished.
-- In the SUITE, Adam gets dressed in his GEAR.
-- On a SMALL HILL, Jacob demonstrates some moves on skis.
Adam doesn't get it. He's keeps falling.
-- On the hill, Jacob teaches Adam how to SNOWBOARD. Adam is
having an easier time standing up on the snowboard.
-- The guys keep Adam awake and use a homemade SCALE MODEL of
the mountain to formulate a plan, a la Iron Eagle.
-- Back on the hill, Jacob and Adam snowboard next to each
other. Adam makes it by a couple of obstacles. Jacob looks
proud of him.
-- The guys play an ATARI SKI GAME, trying out a strategy.
Jacob uses a POINTER, looking disappointed.
-- On the hill, Adam easily maneuvers by a few trees on the
snowboard, kicking up snow and HIGH-FINING Jacob.
SLO-MO HERO SHOT of our four guys, as they ascend the top of
the mountain. If we didn't know any better, it would look
like Tony Scott directed a ski movie.
END MONTAGE.
A few yards away from Nick and Lou, Adam sits on the ground,
as Jacob helps him strap into the snowboard.
JACOB
Just stick to the plan and you're
gonna be fine.
Adam looks at Jacob seriously for a moment.
ADAM
Jacob, I'm sorry for not always
being the big brother I should've
been. I was away at college, Mom
gave you my Sega - there were a
whole host of issues.
Jacob nods and speaks genuinely to Adam too.
86.
JACOB
I know. I'm sorry too. I put a
few things before my family and
took my guilt out on you.
(puts it together)
I guess it was an inevitable I'd
end up part of a roofie ring.
Adam smiles and extends his hand.
ADAM
Friends?
Jacob takes Adam's hand and helps him to his feet.
JACOB
Brothers.
They EMBRACE. Lou looks disgusted.
LOU
Gay.
Blaine and his goons approach from below. Adam puts on his
game face.
ADAM
I didn't think you guys would show.
BLAINE
This was my idea.
ADAM
It's gonna make my victory taste
all the more sweeter. Like a Peach
Snapple.
BLAINE
A what?
ADAM
You'll see.
Blaine actually looks rattled, as the two men get lined up.
Adam is on a SNOWBOARD.
BLAINE
What's that?
ADAM
You're not afraid of getting beat
by a guy on a skateboard, are you?
87.
BLAINE
I've seen you in action. You're
reckless and terrible.
ADAM
Reckless and terrible's my middle
name. Because I feel the need...
(pulls on goggles)
for speed!
Chaz holds out his arm as a starting line.
ADAM (CONT'D)
Catch ya at the bottom.
CHAZ
3, 2, 1... GO!
Blaine takes off down the mountain like a professional
skiier, which he pretty much is. Adam looks toward Jacob,
who demonstrates the proper CROUCH. Adam slowly picks up
speed, starting at about one mile per hour.
Blaine looks back and can't believe how easily he's gonna
coast to victory.
ADAM
Here goes nothing.
Instead of weaving back and forth, Adam just stays in the
crouch, PICKING UP SPEED. He recklessly PASSES BLAINE,
despite the many TREES and OBSTACLES on the course.
He BEARS DOWN AND TRAVELS LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING!
Blaine finds the guts to alter his STYLE, skiing more
recklessly too. He begins catching up to Adam.
Blaine skis up next to Adam - they're both going full force.
BLAINE
You can't beat me! I was born on
this mountain!
ADAM
I was born in a hospital like a
normal baby!
Adam bends down and picks up even more speed, NARROWLY
MISSING trees and rocks. Blaine tries to keep up.
Adam has the finish line in his sights, when he rolls the
dice once too often. His SNOWBOARD GETS SNAGGED on a rock
and Adam TUMBLES TO THE GROUND.
88.
The SNOWBOARD FLIES OFF INTO THE AIR!
CUT TO:
Phil stands against a SHED, as a GUY THROWS A HATCHET at him,
just narrowly missing his arm. Phil FLEXES HIS MUSCLES, as a
HOT CHICK KISSES HIM.
Then the SNOWBOARD FLIES INTO FRAME and SLICES OFF PHIL'S
ARM, sending BLOOD SPLATTER EVERYWHERE!
PHIL
Ahhhh! My arm!!!
Lou watches with BINOCULARS and PUMPS HIS FIST.
LOU
Yes!
As Adam tumbles on the ground, Blaine smiles, thinking he has
the victory in the bag.
But instead of stopping, Adam picks up speed, as he TUMBLES
LIMB OVER LIMB, like a snowball going down the mountain.
With 50 YARDS to go, Blaine bears down and tries to catch
Adam. It's gonna be close.
At the FINISH LINE, Adam's CRUMPLED BODY passes the line
first. Blaine pulls up, pissed off to lose the race.
Adam's momentum carries him forward another 50 yards, where
he SMASHES INTO A DECK and finally comes to a stop.
CUT TO:
A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE POPS!
Adam inspects a HUGE DENT in the side of his car. As he does
so, a car drives by, SPLASHING A PUDDLE on Lily.
ADAM (V.0.)
If Lily knew where we were, I'm
sure she would've walked home. And
I wouldn't have blamed her.
In the RAIN, Adam and Lily run toward the entrance of a
little deli. Inside the doorway, a LITTLE OLD WOMAN shakes
her head no. Adam pleads with his eyes and she lets them in.
Adam walks outside, taking a bite of the SANDWICH. He finds
Jennie waiting in the TUB.
JENNIE
There you are!
ADAM
Jennie! What are you doing here?
JENNIE
Making good on a rumor.
Jennie STANDS UP in the tub and she's TOPLESS.
Adam DROPS THE SANDWICH, shocked.
ADAM
Whoa.
93.
Jennie continues talking, shamelessly exposing herself.
JENNIE
When I saw you win that race
against Blaine, everything changed
for me. I realize now that I
deserve more. I deserve a winner.
(SEDUCTIVE)
Come and get your prize.
Adam reaches next to the tub and hands her a ROBE.
ADAM
Yeah, I... can't.
She covers up, embarrassed.
JENNIE
Oh my god. I missed my
opportunity.
ADAM
No, I'm not sure there ever was an
opportunity. Jennie, you're
terrific. You've brought me so
many moments of joy, you'll never
know. But I shouldn't have given
you the wrong idea.
Jennie looks sad and vulnerable, as Adam talks.
ADAM (CONT'D)
The truth is there's a girl I need
to go see. We have plans to spend
the rest of our lives together.
And I can't wait any longer.
(listening to himself)
And I'm totally cool with it.
Adam smiles, feeling the rush of knowing he's ready. But
then he sees how sad Jennie is. He moves closer to her.
ADAM (CONT'D)
One day, you're going to find the
right guy who's willing to give up
everything and travel across time
and space for your love.
She nods and tears up a little bit, as Adam HUGS her.
JENNIE
(EMOTIONAL)
I would totally blow you right now.
94.
ADAM
I know you would.
DISSOLVE TO:
The guys stare at the tub, which continues to bubble, even
though it's not plugged in.
NICK
We don't have to go yet, Adam.
Things are just getting fun.
JACOB
And we can do whatever we want
without any real consequences.
That's a lot to give up.
ADAM
(NODS)
That's how I know I'm doing the
right thing.
Adam reaches in his backpack, but can't find the Red Bull.
He turns it inside out and shakes it -- nothing.
JACOB
Where's the Red Bull?
BLAINE (V.0.)
You looking for this?
Across the patio, a drunk, disheveled Blaine holds the CAN.
BLAINE (CONT'D)
You couldn't leave well enough
alone, could ya? You couldn't just
win the race and call it a day?
You had to have Jennie too.
ADAM
I don't want Jennie.
BLAINE
That's funny. I don't want this
soda, either.
Blaine smiles like an asshole. Adam's face goes desperate,
as Blaine OPENS THE CAN and DRINKS THE WHOLE THING.
ADAM
Nooooo!
95.
Adam runs at Blaine and tackles him to the ground. On the
ground, Adam BEATS THE LIVING HELL out of Blaine, messing up
his face. It makes the Jared Leto scene from Fight Club look
tame. Eventually, Adam's friends pull him off.
Adam crawls to the Red Bull can and it's empty.
ADAM (CONT'D)
(DESPERATE)
Why?
Lou takes Blaine's pulse.
LOU
Holy shit! You may have killed
this guy! No wait... wait... I've
got a pulse. Eh, so much for that.
Nick puts his hand on Adam's shoulder.
NICK
I'm sorry man. I'm really sorry.
ADAM
The Red Bull's gone. He fucked us.
JACOB
Not necessarily.
Everyone looks toward Jacob.
JACOB (CONT'D)
The Red Bull isn't really gone.
(points to Blaine)
It's in him.
A beat, as everyone sorta gets it.
NICK
It's worth a shot.
TIME CUT TO:
Adam, Nick, and Jacob sit in the tub. Adam crosses his
fingers.
Lou stands outside the tub, fully dressed.
ADAM
Come on, Lou.
96.
LOU
Nah, I'll take a rain check.
NICK
What are you talking about?
LOU
Listen, your lives at home sound
all beautiful and happy with your
barbecues and swimming pools and
"oh, that sandwich reminds of some
gay shit I did one time."
Adam and Nick don't look thrilled to be reduced to this.
LOU (CONT'D)
But my life back there sucks. And
in case you haven't noticed, my
life here fucking rules. So I have
a coke problem? I'll go to rehab.
I have no money? I'll stop winning
sex and start winning dollars.
Lou DRAGS BLAINE by the foot closer to the tub.
LOU (CONT'D)
Guys, I was tailor-made for 1987.
And you'll excuse me, but I value
banging young chicks way more than
all of your friendships combined.
(THEN)
No offense.
Adam, Nick, and Jacob kinda nod and understand.
ADAM
Yeah, no, I get it.
Lou goes around and gives them all hugs.
NICK
Makes perfect sense, man.
Lou squeezes Jacob's shoulder.
LOU
I don't hate you as much as I used
to.
JACOB
(a little emotional)
I hate you a little less also.
Lou LIFTS BLAINE'S LIMP BODY.
97.
ADAM
OK, whenever you're ready, Lou.
LOU
One small step for man! One giant
asshole puking in a hot tub! Here
goes nothing!
Lou does the HEIMLICH MANEUVER on Blaine. It takes ONE...
TWO... THREE THRUSTS until Blaine PUKES IN THE TUB! For a
second, it's just a BIG SPLASH of VOMIT and nothing else.
NICK
OK, well maybe if we--
A BRIGHT FLASH CONSUMES THE SCREEN! And when it dies down,
we see Adam, Nick, Jacob (and the floating puke) in the hot
tub where we left them.
Only Lou is missing.
ADAM
What happened? Did it work?
NICK
I didn't feel anything.
JACOB
(DISAPPOINTED)
Guys, look.
They see PEOPLE walking by, wearing COLORFUL FLARED-OUT SKI
ATTIRE. The place looks the same as it did two seconds ago.
NICK
Dammit. Even the deck furniture's
the same. We fucking blew it. It
didn't work.
ADAM
Where's Lou?
LOU (O.S.)
Right on schedule!
Lou walks toward them, but there's a lot that's "off" about
him, including HAIR PLUGS, JEWELRY, and a SHITLOAD OF PLASTIC
SURGERY (including a fixed NOSE) that makes him look at once
older and younger.
NICK
Ahhh!
98.
LOU
Oh, the face, eh? I was curious
how you'd react.
(DISAPPOINTED)
Didn't think you'd be scared.
ADAM
Lou?
LOU
You're damn right it's me.
ADAM
What happened?
LOU
You just traveled 23 years in three
seconds. Took me 23 years. It's
good to see you guys!
JACOB
We're back? It all looks the same.
LOU
It better! You know how much I pay
the groundspeople around here? A
lot. But that's all right, I'm
fucking loaded. Look at all this.
Everyone looks confused.
ADAM
Will you fill in some of the blanks
for me, please?
LOU
I'll give you the short version,
because time is of the essence.
First of all, to settle an old bet,
time most definitely has been
moving forward. It is exactly
three days since you've arrived
here in beautiful Havenhurst.
Jacob looks at Nick.
JACOB
Told you.
LOU
Secondly, I'm filthy rich. Made
sports bets. Sued Ace of Base. I
own most of V
ermont. (MORE)
99.
LOU (CONT'D)
I've been reimagining the state as
my own personal playground. You
could say I'm a little bit like
Michael Jackson, except I don't
fuck kids.
Two YOUNG HOTTIES walk by and wave at Lou.
LOU (CONT'D)
I do fuck them, though. Haven't
gone above 24 years old in 10 years
and even then, it was a mistake.
(REMEMBERING)
A horrible mistake.
ADAM
Wait, fuck, Lou what time is it?
LOU
Way ahead of you, Adam. You have 2
hours to get to New Jersey in time
for your rehearsal dinner.
ADAM
(DISAPPOINTED)
Great, I blew it.
LOU
Not even a little bit. I have a
helicopter waiting in the parking
lot and a private jet on my
airfield five minutes away.
The guys look stunned.
LOU (CONT'D)
I had some time to plan. God, it's
good to have you guys back!
Lou's private jet takes off from the runway.
The Japanese Businessman is on a PAY PHONE, speaking RAPIDLY
in Japanese.
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
(IN JAPANESE)
Hiro-san! Cancel the paperwork!
We have to get back to Tokyo. I
have inside information that
undermines the supermarket deal.
Nick stands next to him, nodding and SMILING WIDELY.
