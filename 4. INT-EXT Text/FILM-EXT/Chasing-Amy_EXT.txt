Alyssa and Holden walk through the park, eating hot dogs.
ALYSSA
M-TV?
HOLDEN
Twelve episodes.
ALYSSA
That's great, isn't it?
HOLDEN
Banky seems to think so.
ALYSSA
But you don't.
They come to a swing set and sit down on the swings.
HOLDEN
I don't know if that's the perception
I want people to have of our stuff.
I
know this sounds pretentious as hell,
but I like to think of us as artists.
And I'd like to get back to doing
something more personal - like our
first book.
ALYSSA
Well when are you going to do that?
HOLDEN
(beat)
As soon as we have something personal
to say.
ALYSSA
Do you know how pretty you are?
HOLDEN
What?
ALYSSA
You're a pretty man.
HOLDEN
Uh... thanks.
ALYSSA
Oh.
I get it.
I'm into girls, so I
have to find all men repulsive or
something.
HOLDEN
I didn't say anything.
ALYSSA
Aren't there some men that you find
attractive?
Granted, not enough to
sleep with, but still - just handsome
or something!
HOLDEN
Sure.
Harrison Ford.
And our mail-
man.
ALYSSA
Well it's the same thing.
I look at
you and just find you really handsome.
And you know, it has very little to do
with your look, per-se.
Your look is
fine, don't get me wrong.
But it's
more your outlook.
The things you
say, the way you see things.
It's...
I don't know... attractive,
Holden looks away, embarrassed,
ALYSSA
I weirded you our the other night
HOLDEN
Huh!
No, not really.
ALYSSA
Come on.
HOLDEN
(beat)
It's just that we've.., I mean, I've
never seen that kind of thing up close
and personal.
It just took awhile to
process, longer than usual.
ALYSSA
Do you want to talk about it!
HOLDEN
Um.
If you want to.
ALYSSA
I like you.
I haven't liked a man in
a long time.
And I'm not a man-hater
or something.
It's just been some
time since I've been exposed to a man
that didn't immediately live-into a
stereotype of some sort.
And I want
you to feel comfortable with me,
because I want us to be friends.
So
if there are things you'd like to
know, it's okay to ask me.
HOLDEN
(beat)
Why girls?
ALYSSA
(beat)
Why men?
HOLDEN
Because that's the standard
ALYSSA
If that's the only reason you're
attracted to women - because it's the
standard..
HOLDEN
It's more than that.
ALYSSA
So you've never been curious about
men?
HOLDEN
Curious about men?
Well... I always
wondered why my father watched 'Hee-
Haw'.
ALYSSA
You know what I mean.
HOLDEN
No.
ALYSSA
Why not!
HOLDEN
No interest.
ALYSSA
Because...?
HOLDEN
Girls feel right.
ALYSSA
And that's how I feel.
I've never
really been attracted to men.
I'm
more comfortable with the idea of
girls.
HOLDEN
Wait, wait, wait - you're still a
virgin?
ALYSSA
No.
HOLDEN
But you've only been with girls.
ALYSSA
You're saying a person's a virgin
until they've had intercourse with a
member of the opposite sex?
HOLDEN
Isn't that the standard definition?
ALYSSA
Again with the standards.
I think
virginity is lost when you make love
for the first time.
HOLDEN
With a member of the opposite sex.
ALYSSA
Why?
Why only then?
HOLDEN
Because that's the standard.
ALYSSA
So if a virgin is raped, then she's
still a virgin?
HOLDEN
Of course not.
ALYSSA
But rape is not the standard.
So
she's had sex, but not the standard
idea of sex.
Hence, according to
your definition, she'd still be a
virgin.
HOLDEN
Okay, I'll revise.
Virginity is lost
when the hymen is broken.
ALYSSA
Then I lost my virginity at ten,
because I fell on a fence post when I
was ten, and it broke my hymen.
Now I
have to tell people that I lost it to
a wooden post I'd known my whole young
life?
HOLDEN
Second revision - virginity is lost
through penetration.
ALYSSA
Physical penetration or emotional?
HOLDEN
Emotional?
ALYSSA
Well, I fell in love hard with Caitlin
Bree when we were in high school.
HOLDEN
Physical penetration.
ALYSSA
We had sex.
HOLDEN
Yeah, but not real sex.
ALYSSA
I move to have that remark stricken
from the record.
On account of it
makes you come off as completely naive
and infantile.
HOLDEN
Well where's the penetration in
lesbian sex.
Alyssa holds up her hand.
HOLDEN
A finger?
Come on.
I've had my
finger in my ass but I wouldn't say
I've had anal sex.
ALYSSA
Did I hold up a finger?
(waves her hand)
HOLDEN
(beat; then he gets it)
You're kidding?!?!
(she nods)
How...?!?
ALYSSA
Our bodies are built to pass a child,
for Christ's sake.
HOLDEN
But doesn't it hurt?!
ALYSSA
Sure.
But in a good way.
And it's
only a once-in-awhile thing - reserved
for really special occasions.
HOLDEN
What about not-so-special occasions?
ALYSSA
Tongue only.
HOLDEN
But how can that be enough?
I mean,
let's be real - how big can a tongue
even get?
Alyssa swallows what she's chewing and releases her
tongue, which is just huge.
Holden is transfixed.
Alyssa wraps it back up and smiles, standing.
ALYSSA
Let's go.
She exits. Holden remains in the swing.
Alyssa comes
back in.
ALYSSA
Come on.
HOLDEN
Just...uh... just give me a moment.
INT AIRPORT - DAY
Holden enters. Banky tries to balance way-too-much
luggage.
HOLDEN
Look at you.
It's a two day trip.
BANKY
I got the Sega in one bag, my clothes
in the other, and two months worth of
unread comics in this one.
HOLDEN
We're going to a convention, for the
love of God.
We'll be busy from ten
'till eight each day.
When are you possibly going to have
time for any of that shit?
In fact,
fuck it - you're leaving some of this
shit here in a locker.
Come on - give
me the two that aren't clothes.
BANKY
Hold on.
(starts rifling through one
bag)
HOLDEN
What are you doing?
BANKY
I just have to get something.
(pulls out a huge stack of
porno books)
HOLDEN
Who are you, Larry fucking Flynt?
What are you going to do with all of
those?
BANKY
Read the articles.
What do you think
I'm going to do with them?
They're
stroke books.
HOLDEN
You've got like thirty books there!
We're only there for two days!
BANKY
(leafing through mags)
Variety's the spice of life.
I like a
wide selection.
Sometimes I'm in the
mood for nasty close-ups, sometimes I
like them arty and air-brushed.
Some
times it's a spread brown-eye kind of
night, sometimes it's girl-on-girl
time.
Sometimes a steamy letter will
do it, sometimes - not often, but
sometimes - I like the idea of a chick
with a horse.
A beeping sound is heard.
Holden checks his beeper.
HOLDEN
Go check us in.
I've gotta call
Alyssa.
BANKY
His master's voice.
HOLDEN
Put that stuff away.
Holden exits.
Banky starts packing his mags up.
A
little KID enters, staring at him.
KID
What are those?
BANKY
(looks at kid then books)
Do you Like horsies?
Holden finishes dialing the phone.
Cross cut between him
and Alyssa at home.
ALYSSA
I hope for the sake of the women
you've dated that you're only this
quick in returning calls.
HOLDEN
What's up?
I'm about to get on a
plane.
ALYSSA
Ohhh.
Why!
HOLDEN
Last minute invite to the Dragon Con'.
ALYSSA
Shit.
HOLDEN
What?
ALYSSA
My sister's at my parents'.
I was
gonna go see her.
HOLDEN
The one that wrote the book?
ALYSSA
Yeah.
But I was staying all weekend,
and I wanted to hang our with you.
This sucks.
HOLDEN
You didn't get invited to the Con'?
ALYSSA
I don't do southern con's - all the
chicks have that annoying drawl.
You
know how hard it is nor to laugh when
someone moans "Fuhhk me"?
HOLDEN
Well this sucks.
(thinks)
You know - both of us don't have to
go.
ALYSSA
Really?
HOLDEN
Yeah.
Banky can go by himself.
It's
not like we're on a panel.
It was
just a signing appearance.
ALYSSA
If you come pick me up, I'll be your
best friend.
HOLDEN
(beat)
Where's your apartment?
ALYSSA
I'm not there.
I'm at a friend's - in
the Village.
Corner of Houston and
Mercer.
Number eighty six, apartment
6-D.
HOLDEN
I'll be there in half an hour.
ALYSSA
You're so easy.
They hang up.
Holden reacts to something OC and exits
quickly.
C11. Banky points to pictures in the book.
The kid looks
on.
BANKY
...And then Black Beauty couldn't take
it any longer, and he finally did some
of his own mounting.
KID
(off book)
Wow.
Holden grabs Banky's arm and drags him away.
HOLDEN
What are you doing?
BANKY
(waving to kid)
I think I want kids of my own one day.
They're fun.
HOLDEN
Listen to me - I'm not going.
You're
going to have to do this one by
yourself.
BANKY
What?
Why?
HOLDEN
Alyssa's coming down for the weekend,
so I want to hang out with her.
You
don't need me for this.
(taking his excess baggage)
Meantime,
I'll take this stuff home.
You can keep the filth.
I'll pick you
up at nine Sunday night, alright?
Don't forget to plug the Annual and
don't mention the t.v. show, okay?
Call me if you get bored.
And he's gone.
Banky stands there, open-mouthed.
A
check-in FLIGHT ATTENDANT comes up to him.
His name-tag
reads 'Frank'.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Checking in, sir!
BANKY
(still watching Holden go)
Hunhh!
(looks at F.A.)
Yeah.
But this is carry-on.
F.A.
Federal aviation security law requires
me to ask if you've been given any
strange gifts or parcels to carry-on
since arriving at the airport today.
BANKY
(thinks)
Not this trip.
But one time, when I
was using curb side check-in, this sky-
cap gave me a cock ring and a set of
anal ben-wa balls.
I always thought
that was pretty strange.
He said his
name was Frank.
(looks closely at him)
Hey!
You're name's Frank!
Banky storms away.
The Flight Attendant watches him go.
F.A.
Fucking kids.
EXT APARTMENT 6-D - DAY
Holden knocks at the door.
It opens.
A WOMAN is
standing in the doorway in her bra She looks Holden up
and down and smirks.
WOMAN
Let me guess - 'the right man'?
HOLDEN
Excuse me?
WOMAN
You've got it in your head that
Alyssa's not really into chicks - that
she just hasn't met the right man.
And you believe you're it.
You're
going to treat her right, fuck her
like a stud, and 'straight-jacket' her
back from the land of the lost.
And
the sad truth is that you'll
accomplish none of that and wind up as
either an even more bitter misogynist
or a reverse fag-hag.
Holden's at a loss.
Alyssa slips past the Woman,
carrying an overnight bag.
ALYSSA
Don't mind her.
That's just her way a
saying hello.
WOMAN
Actually, it's just my way of saying
"Give it up."
ALYSSA
(to Woman)
You're such an asshole.
WOMAN
When you file the date-rape charges,
don't say I didn't warn you.
HOLDEN
(holding out hand)
I'm Holden, by the way.
WOMAN
I'm the voice of reason that Miss
Bitch is having such a hard time
listening to.
HOLDEN
Look, we're just friends.
WOMAN
That's what every guy says before he
tries purring your hand on his dick.
HOLDEN
And how do you know men so well?
WOMAN
Because I lapdance for a living, dick-
head.
She slams the door. Holden looks to Alyssa.
ALYSSA
Ohhh - you look so cute!
She heads down the stairs.
HOLDEN
Who was that?
ALYSSA
Just an occasional friend.
HOLDEN
Why would you want to hang our with
someone bitter as that?
ALYSSA
(stops)
Remember this!
(sticks out huge tongue)
Her's is even bigger than that.
She smiles and continues on.
Holden looks back up at the
door.
He sticks his own tongue our and sizes it with his
fingers.
EXT TURNPIKE - DAY
The car sits in traffic.
INT CAR - DAY
Holden sighs.
Alyssa plays with the radio.
ALYSSA
You were raised Catholic, right?
HOLDEN
Yeah.
You?
ALYSSA
Baptist.
HOLDEN
Really?
Did you have a strict
upbringing?
ALYSSA
Please There was no time to be bad -
we were too busy saying 'Jesus'.
HOLDEN
You think your upbringing had
something to do with your lifestyle
choice?
ALYSSA
Somewhere along the line.
It's a
gradual transition to make - from
doing what the majority does to taking
a leap of faith and doing what feels
more natural.
Everything helps - from
the way you were handled as a kid, to
the way the boys acted in third grade,
to the shoes you wore at your freshman
prom.
HOLDEN
Shoes?
ALYSSA
Well they were really tight.
HANGING OUT MONTAGE BEGINS
With the requisite music, over which we hear a
conversation between Holden and Alyssa.
1) Holden and Alyssa sit in the DINER eating.
Holden's
talking.
The Waitress walks past and drops her pad.
She
bends over, to pick it up, hiking her mini-skirt up in
the process.
Alyssa stares at her ass.
Holden stops
talking and stares at her.
Alyssa looks over at him and
offers a caught smile.
2) Holden pushes a shopping cart at the FOOD STORE,
throwing various things into the basket.
Alyssa comes up
with a box of Tampons and throws them in.
Holden glances
at them, a bit flushed.
Alyssa catches him, picks up the
box, and pulls one out.
She proceeds to demonstrate
their usage, throwing one leg on the can and miming
insertion.
Holden puts up his hands in the "I know, I
know," fashion.
3) In the Studio, Holden displays some of his artwork to
Alyssa, during which she pulls out a cigarette and goes
to light it.
It's a child-proof lighter, so she's having
trouble.
Holden grows a little frustrated.
Finally, he
grabs the lighter and pulls the child proof tab out with
his teeth.
Alyssa stares at him a bit taken aback.
Holden spits the tab out, and lights Alyssa's smoke.
He
then continues with his display.
4) Holden and Alyssa at the COMIC BOOK STORE.
Steve-Dave
and the Fan-Boy eye them suspiciously.
Alyssa pays for a
comic.
Steve-Dave glowers at Holden.
He gives Alyssa
her change and they exit.
Steve-Dave goes back to his
card game with the Fan-Boy.
Suddenly, a garbage can
comes crashing through their window.
Steve-Dave rips a
check off the garbage can and punches the counter.
The
Fan-Boy rubs his back soothingly,
5) Holden and Alyssa walk through a PARKING LOT, talking.
She takes his hand and pulls his arm around her shoulder.
Holden smiles to himself.
HOLDEN V.O.
Let me ask you something - we get
along, right?
ALYSSA V.O.
Famously.
HOLDEN V.O.
We have a definite chemistry?
ALYSSA V.O.
So it would seem.
HOLDEN V.O.
But we're both into girls.
ALYSSA V.O.
I'm into women.
HOLDEN V.O.
But you weren't always gay.
ALYSSA V.O.
When I was nine I had a crush on Scott
Baio.
HOLDEN V.O.
So If we'd met a long time ago, say in
high school...
ALYSSA V.O.
...I'd still be muff-diving, yes.
HOLDEN V.O.
Thought so.
INT STUDIO - DAY
Holden and Banky play EA Sports Hockey on Sega.
There's
a knock at the door.
HOLDEN
Come in.
Alyssa enters and stands besides them, smiling at their
game.
ALYSSA
I read somewhere that guys who play
hockey are merely making up for penile
deficiencies by carrying big sticks.
BANKY
I thought you lived in the city?
This
is like the umpteenth time I've seen
you here.
Isn't that grounds enough
for the little pink mafia to throw you
out of their club?
HOLDEN
(hits Banky; to Alyssa)
I'll be ready in a second.
I just have to school this mouthy
second-stringer.
BANKY
Bitch, you're schooling no one.
They play.
Cut back and forth between the game and
Banky, Holden, and Alyssa.
HOLDEN
(off game)
What?
Do something!
BANKY
(off game)
You fucking cock-teaser.
I'll knock
your fucking teeth out and pass all
over your ass.
HOLDEN
Look at how slow you are.
Christ, you
move like a geriatric.
BANKY
(screaming at screen)
Fuck!
You Fucking cock-sucker, man!
These faggots won't do what I tell
them to!
HOLDEN
Oh. It's the controller, right?
It's
always the controller.
BANKY
No, it's these... fucking queers on
blades that can't accept a fucking
pass to save their lives!
What period
is this?
HOLDEN
Final sixty of the third.
BANKY
Fuck!
Look at your fucking guys,
they... FUCK!!!
(whips controller)
FUCKING COCK SUCKER, MAN!
I SWEAR TO
GOD!
Banky storms away.
Alyssa looks at Holden,
HOLDEN
Imagine if I'd only beaten him by one
instead of thirty.
INT SKEE-BALL ARCADE - DAY
Holden feeds a couple dollars into the change machine.
Alyssa looks on.
ALYSSA
Explain this again.
HOLDEN
How could you have grown up down the
shore and never played skee-ball?
What did you do with your youth?
They head toward the skee-ball runs.
ALYSSA
Stayed out late, smoked pot, screwed
around.
HOLDEN
Not your grade school years; your high
school years.
ALYSSA
(off skee-ball run)
This looks complicated.
HOLDEN
(Inserts coin and pulls
lever)
The premise is very basic - you roll
the ball up the ramp at varying
speeds, in an effort to pop it into
the score circles.
The higher the
score, the more prize tickets you get.
ALYSSA
What do you do with the prize tickets?
HOLDEN
Trade them in for prizes that aren't
worth nearly as much as you paid to
play the game.
ALYSSA
Then what's the point?
HOLDEN
It's fun.
ALYSSA
And you question my lifestyle.
HOLDEN
Observe.
Holden rolls the ball.
It pops into a twenty point
circle.
HOLDEN
See?
It's just that simple.
ALYSSA
Why not just walk up there and put it
in the fifty every time?
HOLDEN
Where's the skill in that?
ALYSSA
Oh, this is a skill?
I'm sorry, I had
no idea.
HOLDEN
Just toss one.
Alyssa picks up a ball, squints to aim, and whips it
overhand.
It pops off one of the circles and shoots back
at them, missing them as they duck.
An OC knock and an
"OW!" is heard.
Holden reacts as Alyssa laughs.
HOLDEN
(to OC guy)
I'm sorry, man.
She's new at this.
Holden ducks as the ball comes sailing back at his head.
He gets up.
HOLDEN
(to OC)
Thank you.
(hands Alyssa another ball)
Underhand.
Throw it underhand.
ALYSSA
This is where you take straight chicks
on dates?
HOLDEN
It's like Spanish Fly.
This'll
probably be the first time I don't
score afterwards.
ALYSSA
I don't know.
I'm starting to get a
tingle in my bottom.
(tosses a ball)
Ten.
HOLDEN
(grabs a ball)
So what'd you do last night?
(prepares to throw)
ALYSSA
Got laid
Holden whips the ball in surprise.
It ricochets off the
ceiling and through the glass of an old pinball machine.
Alyssa laughs.
Holden looks around, nervously.
ALYSSA
Some more of that skill you were
telling me about?
HOLDEN
Maybe we should just leave before
somebody gets hurt.
ALYSSA
No way.
I want a cheap prize.
(throws a ball)
So your friend's quite the homophobe.
HOLDEN
He just feels left out, I think.
ALYSSA
I'm not talking about his infantile
hang-up with me.
I'm talking about
when you two were playing that game.
Everytime he swore - when his players
messed up, he called them cocksuckers,
he referred to the players as queers,
he called you a cock-teaser...
HOLDEN
I thought he was talking to you.
ALYSSA
I know you think it means nothing, and
it may in fact be unintentional, but
it's ugly all the same.
HOLDEN
He was just pissed he was losing.
ALYSSA
So he slams the gay community?
HOLDEN
C'mon.
Don't get all p.c. on me.
ALYSSA
I'm not.
But what is that saying?
HOLDEN
It says he gets too easily frustrated.
ALYSSA
It's passive/agressive gay-bashing.
HOLDEN
How do you figure?
ALYSSA
How casually did it roll off his
tongue?
And that's how he expresses
his anger?
By calling people faggots?
HOLDEN
I think you're reading too much into
it.
ALYSSA
I think you're just so used to it that
it rolls off your back.
I've heard
the two of you play your little rank
out game where one insists the other
is gay.
(as the boys)
"You're a faggot.
No, you're a
faggot."
It's cute and all to watch
you go at it like grade-schooler, but
it's also offensive - labeling and
ducking the label of being gay as if
it were the scarlet fucking letter.
HOLDEN
You're blowing this way out of
proportion.
We live in a more
tolerant age now.
You refer to
yourself as a dyke.
Hooper calls
himself a faggot all the time...
ALYSSA
Yeah, but that's what's known as
empowerment/disempowerment.
I call
myself a dyke so it's not too
devastating when some throwback
screams it at me as I'm leaving a bar
at night.
Same for Hooper - by calling himself a
faggot, he steals the thunder away
from the mouthy jerks of this world
who'd like to beat him to it.
But the
difference between us having it and
your friend saying it is miles wide.
We say it to mask the pain - you say
it for lack of a better expression at
any given moment.
No Holden, we do
not live in a more tolerant age.
And
if you think that's the case, then
you've been in the suburbs way too
long to be resuscitated.
Holden kind of sulks.
Alyssa notices.
ALYSSA
But you know what?
(picks up his face)
I have more faith in you than that.
(rips her tickets off)
Come on - I want my cheap prize.
INT STUDIO - NIGHT
Holden enters.
Banky's still playing Sega.
Holden sits
next to him.
HOLDEN
(off screen)
How bad do you suck!
BANKY
How was your pseudo-date?
HOLDEN
Leave it alone.
BANKY
That chick bugs me.
HOLDEN
(rubs his head; in baby-talk)
Aww.
Everyone bugs you.
BANKY
Get off.
(off game)
Fucking faggot!
Did you see that?!
Your dyke courting ass just got me
scored on!
HOLDEN
(beat)
You know, you should watch that.
If
you're going to get all bent out of
shape while playing the game, so much
so that you need to curse the t.v.,
try not to gay-bash it, alright.
You're nor that kind of guy.
(gets up)
And don't call her a dyke, alright?
She's a lesbian.
Holden goes to his drawing table and takes off his coat.
Banky sits there, shocked.
He puts the controller down
and crosses to the drawing table.
BANKY
What the fuck is going on here?
HOLDEN
(pulling out pencil)
I'm starting a new page.
BANKY
(smacking pencil away)
Not with this shit!
With you.
What
the fuck is going on with you and that
girl?
HOLDEN
We're friends.
BANKY
She's programming you.
HOLDEN
I beg your pardon?
Programming?
BANKY
Yeah.
And apparently, you don't even
realize it.
What does it matter if I
refer to her as a dyke, or if I call
the Whalers a bunch of faggots in the
privacy of my own office, far from the
sensitive ears of the rest of the
world?
HOLDEN
It's passive/aggressive gay-bashing;
and I know you're not really
prejudiced at heart.
You should just
find some other way to express your
anger, is all I'm saying.
Holden starts drawing.
Banky stares at him.
Then he
grabs the pencil out of Holden's hand and shoves him to
the side.
He starts drawing something.
HOLDEN
What the fuck are you doing!
BANKY
Bear with me here.
I just want to put
you through this little exercise.
(drawing feverishly)
Okay, now see this?
This is a four
way road, okay?
Banky draws a four-way stop.
He illustrates according to
his voice-over.
BANKY V.O.
And dead in the center, is a crisp,
new, hundred dollar bill.
Now at the
end of each of the streets, are four
people, okay?
You following?
Up
here, we got a male-affectionate, easy-
to-get-along-with, no political agenda
lesbian.
Okay?
Now down here, we
have a man-hating, angry-as-fuck,
agenda-of-rage, bitter dyke.
To this
side, we got Santa Claus, right?
And
over to this side - the Easter Bunny.
Banky finishes drawing.
Holden's shaking his head
BANKY
Which one's going to get to the
hundred dollar bill first?
HOLDEN
What is this supposed to prove?
BANKY
I'm serious.
This is a serious
exercise.
It's like an S.A.T.
question.
Which one's going to get to
the hundred dollar bill first - the
male-friendly lesbian, the man-hating
dyke, Santa Claus, or the Easter
Bunny?
HOLDEN
(beat; then pissed)
The man-hating dyke.
BANKY
Good.
Why?
HOLDEN
I don't know.
BANKY
(wildly crossing out the
other three)
BECAUSE THESE OTHER THREE ARE FIGMENTS
OF YOUR FUCKING IMAGINATION!
Holden storms away.
Banky follows.
HOLDEN
I don't need this.
I'm going home.
BANKY
She's fucking with your mind, man!
She knows you've got this schoolboy
crush and she's using it to sway your
way of thinking!
HOLDEN
And why would she need to do that?
What is she Mata fucking Hari?!
What
does she gain?
BANKY
Maybe she thinks you'll get her comic
picked up by Contender.
Or maybe she
thinks you'll change the content of
our book to something more political
and message oriented.
Or, gee - I
don't know - maybe because that's just
what dykes like to do: fuck around
with straight guys' heads, just so she
can go back to her little rug-muncher
club and have a good laugh with all
her man-hating harpy cronies about how
fucking stupid and easily duped men
are!
HOLDEN
You're so out of line right now..,
BANKY
You don't even know this girl!
Big
deal, she's from Middletown and she
went to North!
All the girls at North
were bitches and sluts anyway!
And
this one's got them beat by a mile
because she's a bitch/slut/dyke!
HOLDEN
Watch your fucking mouth, is all I'm
going to tell you..
BANKY
Oh why?
Do you get my back when she
bashes me?
Because I know she does.
And do you know why she does?
Because
I won't play her fucking game!
HOLDEN
Sometimes your paranoia and suspicious
bullshit is amusing.
Sometimes it's
just fucking annoying as piss!
BANKY
What is it about this girl?
You know
you have no shot at getting her into
bed!
Why do you bother wasting time
with her?
Because you're Holden
fucking McNeil - most persistent
traveller on the road that's not the
path of least resistance!
Everything's gotta be a fucking
challenge for you, and this little
relationship with that bitch is a
prime example of your fucking
condition.
Well I don't need a
fucking magic eight ball to look into
your future; you want a forecast?
Here - will Holden ever fuck Alyssa.
(shakes and looks at
imaginary ball)
What a shock - "Not fucking likely"!
This relationship of
your's is
affecting you, our work and our
friendship, and the time's going to
come when I throw down the gauntlet
and say it's me or her!
And then
what're you going to say?!
HOLDEN
(beat)
I think you should let this one go.
BANKY
No, what would you say?
Would you
trash twenty years of friendship
because you've got some idiotic notion
that this chick would even let you
sniff her panties, let alone fuck
her?!
HOLDEN
Let it go...
BANKY
What the fuck.. WHAT THE FUCK MAKES
THIS BITCH ALL THAT IMPORTANT?!?!
Holden looks at Banky for a long beat.
HOLDEN
I'm in love with her, man.
Banky stares at him.
Holden stares back.
Banky looks
into Holden's eyes.
Suddenly, he softens a bit.
He
drops his head.
BANKY
Fuck.
Banky walks away.
Holden watches him go and exits.
INT DINER - NIGHT
Holden and Alyssa sit at a booth.
Alyssa picks through
her food.
Holden looks at the check and pulls money from
his wallet.
HOLDEN
I wish you were the one being pursued
by M-TV.
ALYSSA
Oh really?
HOLDEN
Sure.
Then you could sell our and
maybe pick up the check once in
awhile.
ALYSSA
(drops her fork and wipes her
hands)
We're leaving!
HOLDEN
Well it's not like this is a bed and
breakfast,
ALYSSA
I've got a little business to conduct.
She grabs her bag and slides out of the booth.
Holden
watches her, then follows.
A23. Alyssa slides up to the cashier's desk as does
Holden, who offers a puzzled shrug.
Alyssa offers the
'just wait' finger.
The CASHIER turns to her.
ALYSSA
Are you an authorized deal-maker in
this establishment?
Do you have the
power to negotiate.
CASHIER
You wanna haggle over the price of
your French Dip?
ALYSSA
I want to haggle over the price of
fine art.
CASHIER
What do you mean?
ALYSSA
(pointing OC)
There.
By the kitchen.
That
painting.
CASHIER
What about it?
ALYSSA
The price tag says seventy five.
CASHIER
So!
HOLDEN
(to Alyssa)
Tell me you're kidding!
ALYSSA
I'll give you fifty.
CASHIER
(to OC)
Manuel!
Bring, me the Dyksiezski off
the wall.
(to Alyssa)
All my years in the diner business,
I've waited for this day - the day
when someone wanted to buy one of the
pictures.
ALYSSA
(holds out hand)
Alyssa Jones.
Pleased to meet you.
CASHIER
You say you want to haggle, but you
don't know rule one about haggling,
which you just broke: you never give
your name.
The name is power, and to
give the opponent that piece of you is
to give away victory.
ALYSSA
I'm only trying to conduct a
transaction.
We're not opponents.
CASHIER
(accepting painting from
BUSBOY)
Oh, but we are - if you think I'm
letting this beautiful piece go for
fifty.
ALYSSA
Ah-ha!
(to Holden)
Now we're haggling.
24.
INT CAR - NIGHT									24.
It's drizzling outside.
Holden drives.
Alyssa hugs her
painting and pushes her bare feet against the windshield,
making footprints.
HOLDEN
I've always wondered what kind of
people buy those things.
I can't
believe you talked him down to twenty
five!
ALYSSA
It was looking shakey when he told me
the artist was a blind cripple with a
hump-back, but I held my ground.
There's no room for sympathy in the
buyer's market.
HOLDEN
Where are you going to hang it?
ALYSSA
I'm not.
You are.
HOLDEN
You want me to hang it for you?
You
better hope it doesn't get out to the
girl-nation that you needed a man to
help you hang a picture.
ALYSSA
You're going to hang it in your house.
I bought it for you.
HOLDEN
(laughs)
Yeah, right.
ALYSSA
(looks at him)
I'm serious.
Holden stares at her.
HOLDEN
Why?
ALYSSA
Because it's captured the moment.
It'll be a constant reminder - not
just of tonight, but of our
introduction, the building of our
friendship, everything.
Make no
mistake about it my Friend - it's a
gift to you, from me, so you'll always
remember us.
Holden stares ahead.
Then he swerves the wheel to the
right.
EXT ROADSIDE - NIGHT
The car pulls to the side of the road.
The rain is a bit
heavier now.
INT CAR - NIGHT
Holden throws the car into park
ALYSSA
Why are we stopping?
HOLDEN
Because I can't take it.
ALYSSA
Can't take what?
HOLDEN
I love you.
ALYSSA
(beat)
You love me.
HOLDEN
I love you.
And not in a friendly
way, although I think we're great
friends.
And not in a misplaced
affection, puppy-dog way, although I'm
sure that's what you'll call it.
And
it's not because you're unattainable.
I love you.
Very simple, very truly.
You're the epitome of every attribute
and quality I've ever looked for in
another person.
I know you think of
me as just a friend and crossing that
line is the furthest thing from an
option you'd ever consider.
But I
can't do this any longer.
I can't
stand next to you without wanting to
hold you.
I can't look into your eyes
without feeling that longing you only
read about in trashy romance novels.
I can't talk to you without wanting to
express my love for everything you
are.
I know this will probably queer
our friendship - no pun intended - but
I had to say it, because I've never
felt this before, and I like who I am
because of it.
And if bringing it to
light means we can't hang out anymore,
then that hurts me.
But I couldn't
allow another 	day to go by without
getting it out there, regardless of
the outcome, which by the look on your
face is to be the inevitable shoot-
down.
And I'll accept that But I know
some part of you is hesitating for a
moment, and if there is a moment of
hesitation, that means you feel
something too.
All I ask is that you
not suppress that - at least for ten
minutes - and try to dwell in it
before you dismiss it.
There isn't another soul on this
fucking planet who's ever made me the
person I am when I'm with you, and I
would risk this friendship for the
chance to take it to the next plateau.
Because it's there between you and me.
You can't deny that.
And even if we
never speak again after tonight,
please know that I'm forever changed
because of you and what you've meant
to me, which - while I do appreciate
it - I'd never need a painting of
birds bought at a diner to remind me
of.
Holden stares at Alyssa.
She stares back.
Then she gets
out of the car.
HOLDEN
Was it something I said?
EXT ROADSIDE - NIGHT
Holden gets out of the car.
It's raining pretty hard
now.
Alyssa's hitching up the road.
Holden reaches her.
HOLDEN
What are you doing?
ALYSSA
Get back in the car and get out of
here.
HOLDEN
You're going to hitch to New York?
ALYSSA
Y'ep.
HOLDEN
Aren't you at least going to comment?
ALYSSA
Here's my comment fuck you.
HOLDEN
Why?
ALYSSA
That was so unfair.
You know how
unfair that was.
HOLDEN
It's unfair that I'm in love with you?
ALYSSA
No, it's unfortunate that you're in
love with me.
It's
unfair that you
felt the fucking need to unburden your
soul about it.
Do you remember for a
fucking second who I am?
HOLDEN
So?
People change.
ALYSSA
Oh, it's that simple?
You fall in
love with me and want a romantic
relationship, nothing changes for you
with the exception of feeling hunky-
dorey all the time.
But what about-
me?
It's not that simple, is it?
I
can't just get into a relationship
with you without throwing my whole
fucking world into upheaval!
HOLDEN
But that's every relationship!
There's always going to be a period of
adjustment.
ALYSSA
Period of adjustment?!?
(hitting him)
THERE'S NO 'PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT'
HOLDEN!
I'M FUCKING GAY!
THAT'S WHO
I AM!
AND YOU ASSUME I CAN TURN THAT
AROUND JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A
CRUSH?!?
HOLDEN
If this is a crush... then I don't
know if I could take the real thing if
it ever happens.
She looks at him, rain drenching the pair.
She shakes
her head ruefully.
ALYSSA
Go home, Holden.
She walks away.
Holden stands there, at a loss.
Then he
turns and heads back to his car.
As he reaches the door and turns to look back at her,
Alyssa pounces on him, grabs his face and locks lips with
him, big time.
He drops his keys and embraces her.
And there they stand, by the side of the road, drenched
kissing.
EXT STUDIO - DAY
Banky carries a bag in one arm and pulls out his keys
with the other.
He jams them into the lock, opening the
door.
He picks up the mail on the floor.
INT STUDIO - DAY
He closes the door behind him and shuffles to the
kitchenette, passing by the blanket-covered, slumbering
forms of Holden and Alyssa, who are out cold in each
other's arms.
The place looks a mess - Like a couple of
people were engaged in some tremendous fucking.
Banky is
oblivious.
He sets the bag down on the counter and pulls
out a chocolate milk.
He opens it, sticks a straw into
the top, and begins sipping and sifting through the mail.
He comes to mail that's Holden's and tosses it onto the
couch, near Holden's head.
He looks down at the sleeping
couple, then back at the mail for a couple of beats.
Then he freezes.
He looks down again, and drops his jaw
and his carton of choco.
It hits the floor with a pop.
Holden and Alyssa shoot straight up, eyes struggling to
focus.
They look at one another, then at the
flabbergasted Banky.
Banky blinks.
Then he shuffles
toward the door again and lets himself out.
ALYSSA
(off Holden's reaction)
I take it that's not good.
HOLDEN
(getting up)
Stay here.
(he kisses her and exits)
EXT STREET - DAY
Banky sits on a curb, staring into the distance, Holden
saunters up and sits beside him.
He follows Banky's
gaze.
BANKY
Catholic school girls.
Across the street, the Catholic High School is letting
out.
Teenage girls clad in uniforms and tight sweaters
smoke, frolic, wait for their bus.
BANKY
The uniform is what does it for me.
I
wish I'd have went with more Catholic
school girls when I was a kid.
As it
stands.
I have no "...and then she
unzipped her jumper..." stories.
HOLDEN
You looked weirded out back there.
BANKY
That's my couch you were fucking on.
HOLDEN
Sorry.
BANKY
I wanted to watch some TV.
Hard to do
when your best friend's wrapped around
a naked rug-muncher on your couch.
HOLDEN
She had boxers on.
Banky shoots him a glare.
He goes back to staring at the
OC girls.
BANKY
This is all going to end badly.
HOLDEN
You don't know that.
BANKY
I know you.
You're way too
conservative for that girl.
She's
been around and seen things we've only
read about in books.
HOLDEN
But we have read about them.
So we're
prepared.
BANKY
There's no 'we' here.
You're going to
have to go through this alone.
And
it's one thing to read about shit, and
something different when you're forced
to deal with it on a regular basis.
When you guys are walking in the mall
and both your heads turn at a really
nice looking chick, it's going to eat
you up inside.
You'll spend most of
your time wondering when the other
shoe's going to drop.
Because for
you, this isn't about cool weird sex
stuff, it's about love.
HOLDEN
Maybe it is for her as well.
BANKY
Somehow I doubt it.
HOLDEN
Everyone's not out to get someone in
life.
Bank.
BANKY
Everybody has an agenda.
Everyone.
HOLDEN
Yourself?
BANKY
My agenda is to watch your back.
HOLDEN
To what end?
BANKY
To insure that all this time we've
spent together, building something,
wasn't wasted.
HOLDEN
She's not going to ruin the comic.
BANKY
I wasn't talking about the comic.
(gets up)
I'm going to gel a bagel.
Clean off
my fucking couch so I can watch TV.
Banky walks away.
Holden shakes his head.
INT ALYSSA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
An all-girl gathering. TORY. NICA, DALIA and JANE help
Alyssa finish an issue of 'Idiosyncratic Routine'.
Tory
letters a page.
Nica and Dalia lay-out the artwork.
Dalia drinks wine.
Alyssa paints the cover.
DALIA
From what I understand, when you sign
with a publisher, someone else does
all this work for you, and you just
sit back and collect.
ALYSSA
And miss these last minute cram
sessions with my nearest and dearest?
Never.
TORY
I don't know what she's bitching
about.
All she's done since we got
here is pound Merlot.
DALIA
I'm sorry weren't you the one who
misspelled 'receipt' on page eighteen?
Yeah, you're a real help.
NICA
What I'd like to know is why we're
here at all when we haven't seen
Princess funny-Book in a month.
JANE
Yeah Alyssa - who've you been shacking
up with?
ALYSSA
'Shacking up!' Please.
(stops painting; smiles wide)
I'm so in love!
Everyone aww's.
Alyssa buries her face, giggling.
ALYSSA
I know.
I know -I feel like such a
goon.
But I can't help it - we have
such a great time together.
DALIA
Who is it?
Don't even tell me it's
Ms. Thing from the C.D. place.
I'll
kill you.
ALYSSA
It's not her.
It's someone you guys
don't know.
NICA
That chick you left the restaurant
with that night?
ALYSSA
They're not.
From around here.
TORY
Don't even tell me you met her down
the shore!
JANE
Eww!
Not a bridge-and-tunnel Jersey
dyke!
TORY
With huge hair and acid-washed jeans!
They all cackle.
Alyssa tries to laugh with them.
DALIA
Come on, Alyss - Hoboken Hussy or
what?
ALYSSA
For your information, they don't have
big hair or wear acid wash.
(goes back to painting)
They're from my home town.
Dalia stares at Alyssa, suspiciously.
DALIA
Why are you playing the pronoun game?
ALYSSA
What?
What are you talking about?
I'm not even.
DALIA
You are. "I met someone."
"We have a
great time.
"They're from my home
town."
Doesn't this tube of
wonderful have a name!
ALYSSA
(beat)
Holden.
All four Girls stare at Alyssa, a bit horrified.
She
stops painting.
JANE
Oh, Alyssa - no.
Not you.
TORY
You're dating a guy?
ALYSSA
He's not like a typical man.
He's
really sweet to me, and we relate so
well.
You guys'd love him, really.
They stare at Alyssa.
Then Dalia gets up.
DALIA
I've gotta go to the store.
JANE
I'll go with.
They exit.
Alyssa looks to Tory and Nica.
TORY
(pouring wine)
Whelp - here's to both of you.
(moves the glass to her lips)
Another one bites the dust.
INT HOLDEN'S BEDROOM -NIGHT
Holden and Alyssa lie in each other's arms, moonlight
bathing them.
She smokes.
HOLDEN
Can I ask you something?
ALYSSA
Don't even tell me you want to do it
again.
HOLDEN
Why me - you know?
Why now?
ALYSSA
Because you were giving me that look,
and I got wet...
HOLDEN
You know what I'm talking about.
ALYSSA
Why not You?
HOLDEN
I'm a guy.
You're attracted to girls.
ALYSSA
I see you've been taking notes.
Historically, yes
that's true.
HOLDEN
Then why this?
ALYSSA
I've given that a lot of thought, you
know?
I mean, now that I'm being
ostracized by my friends, I've had a
lot of time to think about all of
this.
And what I've come up with is
really simple: I came to this on my
terms.
I didn't just heed what I was
taught, you
know?
Men and women
should be together, it's the natural
way - that kind of thing.
I'm not
with you because of what family,
society, life tried to instill in me
from day one.
The way the world is -
how seldom you meet that one person
who gets you... it's so rare.
My
parents didn't really have it.
There
was no example set for me in the world
of male/female relation ships.
And to
cut oneself off from finding that
person - to immediately half your
options by eliminating the possibility
of finding that one person within your
own gender... that just seemed stupid.
So I didn't.
And by leaving my
options open, I was branded 'gay',
which to me was no big deal - labels
are labels, you know?
They define
what you do, not who you are, I guess.
But 		then you come along.
You -
the one least likely; I mean, you were
a guy.
HOLDEN
Still am.
ALYSSA
And while I was falling for you, I put
a ceiling on that, because you were a
guy.
Until I remembered why I opened the
door to women in the first place - to
not limit the likelihood of finding
that one person who'd compliment me so
completely.
And so here we are, I was
thorough when I looked for you, and I
feel justified lying in your arms -
because I got here on my terms, and
have no question that there was
someplace I didn't look.
And that
makes all the difference.
HOLDEN
(beat)
Shit.
ALYSSA
What?
HOLDEN
Well, you took the luster our of it.
ALYSSA
What luster?
HOLDEN
(joking - in case you didn't
get it)
Of how I brought you back from the
other side.
How all you needed was
the right man to turn you around.
ALYSSA
You're not the right man.
(kisses him)
You're just the one.
She snuggles into him and closes her eyes.
Holden stares
at the ceiling.
HOLDEN
Can I at least cell people that all
you needed was some serious deep-
dicking?
She hits him with her pillow.
THE BIG OL' FALLING-IN-LOVE MONTAGE BEGINS
1) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves in various
directions, shaking her head accordingly.
Then she puts
up her hands to stop.
Cut to Holden, hanging the
picture.
Alyssa gave him.
It hangs at a severely crooked angle.
He looks back to
her and shakes his head 'no'.
2) Holden and Alyssa try to play a video game.
Banky
plays as well.
Holden instructs her in the ways of NHL
'96 (turning her paddle right-side-up, pointing at things
on the screen).
She presses the reset button, over and
over.
Banky gives Holden a 'What the fuck?' look.
Alyssa sticks her tongue at him.
3) At the Video Store - Holden picks up a Disney cartoon
off the shelf.
He goes to show if to Alyssa, who's
reading the back of 'Anything But Dick', an allchick
porno.
An old WOMAN stares at her.
Holden nods to the
old Woman and takes the tape out of Alyssa's hands,
putting it back on the shelf.
He ushers her away.
The
old Woman waits until they're gone and then picks up the
tape herself,
4) Holden carries Alyssa on his shoulders through the
park, her crotch against the back of his neck.
He's
talking. She taps him and he stops and looks up.
She
begins to maneuver around so her crotch is in his face.
He pulls her off and put her down.
She's laughing.
He's
flushed with embarrassment.
The same Old Woman from the
Video store passes by with her husband.
Holden shrugs.
5) In Holden's Apartment again - Alyssa again with the
waving, then putting up her hands to stop.
Cut to Holden
again, this time with the painting hung completely upside
down.
He looks at it, then offers her a bewildered gaze.
6) In the Office Banky comes to his drawing table.
There
are penciled pages on it with a note that says "Hanging
out with Alyssa today.
Holden".
Banky crumples it up
and throws it across the room.
7) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves this way, then
that way, then puts up her hands frantically to stop.
She settles back against the wall, a satisfied smile
crawling across her face, and closes her eyes.
We pull
back to reveal Holden on his knees in front of her,
eating her out (no, we don't see anything!).
INT OFFICE - DAY
Holden draws.
A book is thrown in front of him.
He
looks up.
Banky stands there.
BANKY
Check out page forty eight.
Holden looks down at that book.
It's the Nineteen Eighty
Eight yearbook from Middletown North.
He shakes his head
at Banky and flips it open.
On the page is Alyssa's Senior year photo.
Under her
name is another name in quotes that says 'Finger Cuffs'.
HOLDEN
(looking up)
So?
BANKY
Did you see the nickname?
HOLDEN
'Finger Cuffs'.
BANKY
And...?
HOLDEN
And... she had a weird nick-name.
What's your point?
BANKY
Do you know why it's 'Finger Cuffs'?
HOLDEN
I suppose you do.
BANKY
I do.
(takes a seat)
You remember Cohee Lundin?
Left
Hudson and went to North our senior
year?
HOLDEN
Yeah.
BANKY
Well, I ran into him at Food City the
other day, and we got to talking, and
I mentioned that you were dating
Alyssa, and he said..
CUT TO COHEE LUNDON.
In the PARKING LOT of FOOD CITY,
addressing the camera.
COHEE
Alyssa Jones?
Shit.
I know Alyssa
Jones.
I mean, I know Alyssa Jones,
you know what I'm saying?
Me and Rick Derris used to hang our
with her for awhile, right?
Just
hanging around her house after school,
'cuz her parents were like never home,
and shit.
And one day, Rick just
whips it out, and starts rubbing it on
her leg and shit; chasing her around
the living room - I was dying.
But
you know what the crazy bitch did?
She fucking drops to her knees, and
just starts sucking him off right in
front of me!
Like I wasn't even there
man!
I almost died!
But that's not
the fucked up part - the fucked up
part was Rick, man - right in the
middle of it, he turns to me and he's
pointing at her and he says "Cohee."
Just like that - "Cohee."
So I'm like
I'll give it a shot.
And I start
pulling her pants down all slow, 'cuz
I figure any second she's gonna turn
around and belt me in the mouth,
right?
But yo, check this shit out -
she's all into it man!
She don't try
to stop me or nothing!
She's
all wet and shit, and I just went to
work, know what I'm saying?
Me and
Rick are going to town on this crazy
bitch, and she's just loving it, all
moaning and shit!
It was fucked up!
So Rick's the one that came up with
the nickname - 'cuz that day, she had
us locked in tight from both sides -
like a pair of goddamn Chinese finger
cuffs!
BACK IN THE OFFICE - Holden stares at Banky.
HOLDEN
He's full of shit.
BANKY
Cohee's a lot of things, but an
exxagerator he's not.
The dude's
Catholic.
HOLDEN
She's never even been with a guy.
BANKY
That's what she says.
But I say her
on her hands and knees getting filled
out like an application constitutes
'being with a guy'.
HOLDEN
He's pulling your chain.
And the fact
that you even bought it for a second
makes you look like an idiot.
BANKY
I'm getting your back, asshole!
People don't forget shit like 'Finger
Cuffs'.
And if it got out that she's
queer as well, how do you think it's
going to make you look?
HOLDEN
I give a shit what people think.
BANKY
Alright, forget about that; what if
she's carrying a disease?
That was
just one story - what if there's more?
HOLDEN
(grabs his coat)
You're such a fucking asshole.
BANKY
What?
Oh, it's not possible that
she's all crudded up?
Cohee I can
vouch for as clean - the dude never
got laid in high school.
But Derris
is an arch fucking bush-man!
Name me
one chick in our senior class that
Rick Derris didn't nail, for Christ's
sake!
HOLDEN
Would you let this go?
I'm telling
you - she's never even been with a
guy, let alone those two zeroes.
BANKY
And I'm telling you, the bitch could
be a bigger fucking germ farm than
that monkey in 'Outbreak'!
Holden grabs Banky and pins him against the wall.
HOLDEN
Give it a rest!
Do you hear me?!
I'm
tired of this shit!
She's my goddamn
girlfriend, do you understand?!
Show
her a little fucking respect!
And if you ever even so much as
mention that Alyssa looks a little
peaked from now on, I'll put your
fucking teeth down your throat!
He releases Banky.
Banky brushes himself off.
BANKY
Maybe I'll put your fucking teeth down
your throat.
HOLDEN
(walking out)
Not bloody Likely.
Banky runs to the open door.
BANKY
(calling after him)
I've been working out you know!
(no response)
You better be ready to make that M-TV
deal!
The downstairs door slams.
Banky makes a muscle, then
feels it.
INT TOWER RECORDS - DAY
Holden and Hooper peruse laser discs.
HOOPER
Where's that bitch partner of your's
been?
HOLDEN
Sulking.
He's having a real problem
with this Alyssa thing.
HOOPER
I think it's more like Banky's having
a problem with all things not hetero
right about now.
And I'm just another
paradigm of said aberration.
HOLDEN
Banky does not hate gays, you know
that.
HOOPER
But I do think he is a bit homophobic.
And this latest episode between you
and Ms. Thing has tapped into that.
In his warped perception, he lost you
to the dark side - which is she.
HOLDEN
You make it sound like me and him were
dating.
HOOPER
Don't kid yourself - that boy loves
you in a way that he's not ready to
deal with.
HOLDEN
(beat)
He's been digging up dirt on Alyssa.
HOOPER
And just what has Mister Angela
Lansbury uncovered about your lady
fair?
HOLDEN
He heard some bullshit story that she
took on two guys.
HOOPER
Really?
Well then he's barking up the
wrong we if he wants to split you up,
isn't he?
He's not going to make you
see the error of your ways by pointing
out how truly gay she's not
(holds up a disc)
This one?
HOLDEN
Have it.
(beat)
Actually, it's kind of gotten to me.
HOOPER
How so?
HOLDEN
Banky's not known for believing
misinformation.
He's got a pretty
good bullshit detector.
HOOPER
So, what if it is true?
Would that
bother you?
HOLDEN
Sex with multiple partners?
Hooper lets our a faux-shock shriek.
HOLDEN
At the same time.
Again, even louder, hands slapped against his cheeks.
HOLDEN
Thanks for being so comforting.
HOOPER
So what do you care?
HOLDEN
Well that's the thing, isn't it?
I
shouldn't.. but it gets to me.
HOOPER
Kind of gal Alyssa is, you don't think
she's been in the middle of an all -
girl group-grope?
HOLDEN
You see - that doesn't bother me.
But
the thought of her and guys... Uh!
HOOPER
Oh Holden, I beg you - please don't
drop fifty stories in my opinion of
you by falling prey to that latest of
trendy beasts.
HOLDEN
Which is?
HOOPER
Lesbian chic.
It's oh-so acceptable
to be a gay girl nowadays.
People
think it's cute, because they've got
this fool picture in their heads about
lipstick lesbians - like they all
resemble Alyssa - while most of them
look more like you.
HOLDEN
Do I detect a little inter-subculture
cattiness?
HOOPER
Gay or straight - ugly's still ugly.
And most of those boys are scary.
HOLDEN
I thought fags were all supposed to be
super-supportive of one another.
HOOPER
Screw that 'all for one' shit.
I
gotta deal with being the minority in
the minority of the minority, and
nobody's supporting my ass?
While the
whole of society is fawning over girls-
on-girls, here I sit - a reviled gay
man, and to top that off,
I'm a gay
black man - notoriously the most
swishy of the bunch.
HOLDEN
Three strikes.
HOOPER
Hey, hey!
There's a line.
A young BLACK KID approaches Hooper, holding a comic
book.
KID
Are you Hooper X?
HOOPER
(in militant mode)
A-salaam Alaikum, little brother.
KID
Could you sign my comic?
HOOPER
(signing comic; nods to
Holden)
See that guy there?
He's the devil,
you understand?
Never take your eye
off the Man.
Our people took their
eyes off him one time, and he had us
in chains in two shakes of his snake's
tail.
The Kid offers Holden an angry look.
Hooper gives him
back his comic.
HOOPER
Fight the power, little 'G'.
KID
Word is bond
The Kid leaves, Hooper slips back into his real voice.
HOOPER
Look at what I have to resort to for
professional respect.
What is it
about gay men that terrifies the rest
of the world.
(shakes his head)
As for this hang-up with Alyssa's
past, maybe what's really bothering
you is that your fragile fantasy might
not be true.
HOLDEN
What do you mean?
HOOPER
Holden - don't even try to come off
like you don't know what I'm saying.
Men need to believe that they're Marco
fucking Polo when it comes to sex -
like they're the only ones who've ever
explored new territory.
And it's hard
not to let them believe it.
I let my
boys run with it for awhile - feed
them some of that "I've never done
this before..." bullshit, and let 'em
labor under the delusion that they
rockin' my world, until I can't stand
them anymore.
Then I hit 'em with the
truth.
It's a sick game.
The world
would be a better place if people
would just accept that there's nothing
new under the sun, and everything you
can do with a person has probably been
done long before you got there.
HOLDEN
I can accept that.
HOOPER
Honey, that almost sounded convincing.
Do yourself a favor - just ask her
about her past, point blank.
Get it
out of the way, before it gets too big
for both ya'll to move.
(spotting something OC)
Oooh!
'Myra Breckinridge'!
Hooper trots off, Holden glances at the disc in his
hands.
Pictured on it are two gorgeous chicks, barely
clad, making out.
The title is 'Men Suck.. and so do
Girls - All XXX Action.'
INT HOCKEY RINK - NIGHT
On the ice, two teams clash, chasing the puck up and
back, checking galore.
In the bleachers, amidst a slew of fans, Alyssa watches
the game with a large degree of enjoyment.
Sitting
beside her, Holden doesn't seem to share her enthusiasm.
ALYSSA
Since most of these people are rooting
for the home team, I'm going to cheer
for the visitors.
I'm a big visitors
fan - especially the kind that make
coffee for you in the morning before
they go.
(smiles at Holden; no
response)
That was a joke.
A little wacky
wordplay?
HOLDEN
What do you mean, 'visitors'?
ALYSSA
Was I being too obscure?
The kind
that - until recently - had no dicks
and would spend the night.
HOLDEN
So that was until recently!
ALYSSA
Oh, yeah.
(shouting; to ice)
Hey - foul!
Foul!
He was traveling
or something!
HOLDEN
So nobody bur me has stayed the night
at your place since we got together?
ALYSSA
(beat)
Something on your mind, Holden?
HOLDEN
No, I was just wondering,
ALYSSA
If I've been 'faithful' or something?
HOLDEN
Look, I was just asking.
ALYSSA
(toucher his face)
Oh, sweetie.
I only have eyes for
you.
(to ice)
CALL THAT FUCKING SHIT, REF!!
THE GUY
ON THE SKATES TOTALLY SHOVED ONE OF MY
GUYS!!
(to Holden)
I told you I was great at sporting
events.
Imagine what a bitch I could
be if I knew what was going on?
ON THE ICE - Things heat up between two opposing PLAYERS.
One snatches the puck away from the other and skates off.
The other Player gives chase.
Alyssa's very into the game.
Holden shakes his head
HOLDEN
That'd make Banky half right.
ALYSSA
About what?
HOLDEN
He said all the girls from North were
bitches and sluts.
ALYSSA
Really.
I'm sorry - you two left high
school behind how many years ago?
(grabs his face and kisses
his cheek)
Can I put some of my books in your
locker?
(goes back to watching game)
HOLDEN
(under his breath)
How about your yearbook.
ON THE ICE - The Player giving chase slashes the Player
with the puck.
Alyssa jumps to her feet.
ALYSSA
(to ice)
IF YOU DON'T START USING THAT WHISTLE
I'M GONNA JAM IT STRAIGHT UP YOUR
ASS!!
(to guy next to her)
Right?
HOLDEN
What's with 'Finger Cuffs'?
ALYSSA
(sitting back down)
'Finger Cuffs'?
HOLDEN
Yeah.
In your senior yearbook your
nickname was 'Finger Cuffs'.
What is
that?
ALYSSA
It was?
Shit, damned if I can
remember.
I'd look it up, but I threw
all that shit our years ago?
(beat)
Where'd you see a North yearbook?
HOLDEN
Do you know Rick Derris?
ON THE ICE - The Players skid into the corner where
Player One checks Player Two into the boards, hard.
Player Two scrambles to his feet and throws down his
gloves.
The crowd around Alyssa and Holden go wild.
ALYSSA
Rick?
Sure.
We used to hang out in
high school.
(to ice)
PUNCH HIM IN THE FUCKING NECK, NUMBER
TWELVE!!
HOLDEN
Did you go out with him or something?
ALYSSA
(eyes on the ice)
Date Rick Derris?
No.
We just hung
out a lot.
HOLDEN
Just... you and him?
ALYSSA
No.
Me, Rick, and... um... what was
that guy's name...?
HOLDEN
Cohee?
ALYSSA
Yeah!
Cohee Lundin.
God, I haven't
thought about that name in years.
ON THE ICE - The Players square off.
Player Two pulls
Player One's helmet off and punches him in the face.
Holden looks as if he'd Like to do the same to his
companion.
Alyssa's into the game.
ALYSSA
I remember those guys'd come over
almost everyday after school.
They'd
bug my sisters, look for porno tapes
in my dad's closet, raid our fridge.
They really took advantage of my
parents never being home.
ON THE ICE - Player Two yanks at Player One's jersey and
gut punches him.
Alyssa seems oblivious to Holden's
anger, so enthralled with the action is she.
ALYSSA
(starts laughing)
This one day... Rick pulled out his
dick and chased me around the house
with it!
Right in front of Cohee!
I
couldn't believe it!
Guys are weird -
I thought the whole size hang-up made
you all terrified to show your dicks
to each other?
ON THE ICE - Player One staggers a bit, then quickly
rights his jersey and lunges at Player Two, landing a
barrage of his own punches.
Blood sprays across the ice.
Holden's face is reeeeeaaaally sour looking.
Alyssa's
still in the game.
HOLDEN
Rick pulled his dick out?
Really?
What'd you do?
ALYSSA
(looks him dead in the eye)
I blew him while Cohee fucked me.
ON THE ICE - Player One delivers the kill shot, slamming
his fist into Player Two's nose.
The blood shoots out
like a geyser, and Two goes down hard.
Holden stares at Alyssa, flabbergasted.
The crowd around
them stares not at the fight on the ice, but the fight in
their midst, shocked.
Alyssa fumes.
HOLDEN
Excuse me!?!
ALYSSA
That's what you wanted to hear, isn't
it?
Isn't that what this little cross-
examination of your's is about?
Well
try not to be so obvious about it next
time, there are subtler ways of
badgering a witness.
(to Bystander)
Am I right?
BYSTANDER
(to Holden)
Jeez, even I knew what you were
getting at.
ALYSSA
(gathering her stuff)
If you wanted some background
information on me, all you had to do
was ask - I'd have gladly volunteered
it.
You didn't have to play Hercules
fucking Poirot!
She storms away.
Holden chases after her.
The Bystander
watches them go.
BYSTANDER
(to companion)
I told you these were good seats.
INT RINK LOBBY / EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Alyssa marches quickly, pulling on her coat.
Holden
catches up to her.
We track with them our into the
parking lot.
HOLDEN
So it's true?!
ALYSSA
Yes Holden!
In fact, everything you
heard or dug up on me was probably
true!
Yeah, I took on two guys at
once!
You want to hear some gems you
might not have unearthed - I took a
twenty six year old guy to my senior
prom, and then left halfway through to
have sex with him and Gwen Turner in
the back of a limo!
And the girl who
got caught in the shower with Miss
Moffit, the gym teacher?
That was me!
Or how about in college, when I let
Shannon Hamilton videotape us having
sex - only to find out the next day
that he broadcast it on the campus
cable station?!
They're all true -
those and so many more!
Didn't you
know?
I'm the queen of urban legend!
HOLDEN
How the hell could you do those
things?!
ALYSSA
Easily!
Some of it I did out of
stupidity, some of it I did out of
what I thought was love, but - good or
bad - they were my choices, and I'm
not making apologies for them now -
not to you or anyone!
And how dare
you try to lay a guilt trip on me
about it - in public, no less!
Who
the fuck do you think you are, you
judgemental prick?!
HOLDEN
How am I supposed to feel about all of
this?
ALYSSA
How are you supposed to feel about it?
Feel what ever the fuck you want about
it!
The only thing that really
matters is how you feel about me.
HOLDEN
I don't know how I feel about you now.
ALYSSA
Why?
Because I had some sex?
HOLDEN
Some sex?
ALYSSA
Yes, Holden - that's all it was: some
sex!
Most of it stupid high school
sex, for Christ's sake!
Like you
never had sex in high school!
HOLDEN
There's a world of fucking difference
between typical high school sex and
two guys at once!
They fucking used
you?
ALYSSA
I used them!
You don't think I
would've let it happen if I hadn't
wanted it to, do you?!
I was an
experimental girl, for Christ's sake!
Maybe you knew early on that your
track was from point 'a' to 'b' - but
unlike you I wasn't given a fucking
map at birth, so I tried it all!
That
is until we - that's you and I - got
together, and suddenly, I was sated.
Can't you take some fucking comfort in
that?
You turned out to be all I was
ever looking for - the missing piece
in the big fucking puzzle!
(tries to calm down)
Look I'm sorry I let you believe that
you were the only guy I'd ever been
with.
I should've been more honest.
But it seemed to make you feel special
in a way that me telling you over and
over again how incredible you are
would never get across.
She touches his face.
He pulls back.
She stares at him,
hurt and pissed.
ALYSSA
Do you mean to tell me that - while
you have zero problem with me sleeping
with half the women in New York City -
you have some sort of half-assed,
mealy-mouthed objection to pubescent
antics, that took place almost ten
years ago?
What the fuck is your
problem?!?
Holden's eyes are downcast.
Alyssa waits for a response.
HOLDEN
I want us to be something that we
can't.
ALYSSA
And what's that?
HOLDEN
(beat)
A normal couple.
Holden skulks off.
Alyssa stares after him, and then
starts kicking and punching a car beside her, finally
slumping to the ground.
She cries.
INT STUDIO - DUSK
Holden sits on the couch, alone in the dark.
The door
opens and Banky enters.
He stands there, sizing up
Holden's mood.
BANKY
The girl?
Holden nods.
Banky nods back.
He stands there for a
beat.
Then he sits beside Holden.
He opens his arms.
Holden shifts into his friend's embrace and begins crying
on his shoulder.
Banky pats his back.
Pull back on a
man in pain and the comfort of a friend.
INT DINER - NIGHT
Holden sits alone at a booth.
He stirs his iced tea.
OC VOICE
Yo, look at this morose mother fucker
here..
Holden looks up.
JAY and SILENT BOB stand above him.
JAY
Smells like somebody shit in his
cereal.
Holden offers a half-smile.
The pair slide into the
booth.
HOLDEN
What took you so long?
JAY
We were at the mall.
You bring the
salad?
Holden pulls an envelope out of his jacket and tosses it
to Jay.
Jay opens it and pulls out a thick wad of bills,
along with the latest issue of 'BLUNTMAN and CHRONIC.'
JAY
Man, this likeness rights shit is more
profitable than selling smoke.
HOLDEN
How'd a dirt merchant like you ever
learn about likeness rights?
JAY
(hands envelope to Silent
Bob)
We deal to a lot of lawyers.
Speaking
of which...
(pulls out a dime bag)
Little signing bonus and shit!
HOLDEN
I'll pass.
Take a look at the issue.
Silent Bob thumbs through the comic.
Jay looks over his
shoulder, as he begins rolling a joint.
JAY
Yeah.
When you gonna get some pussy
in that book, man!
Throw some super-
villain in with big fucking tits that
shoot milk or something, and I just
drink her dry, bust some moves on
her...
(demonstrates)
...and then she has to fuck me.
(Silent Bob hits him)
Fuck us.
HOLDEN
I'll see what I can do.
A WAITRESS joins them.
WAITRESS
What can I get you.
HOLDEN
Nothing, thanks.
JAY
Yo Flo - tell Mel to whip me up a
toasted bagel and cream cheese.
(to Silent Bob)
You want one too?
(Silent Bob nods)
Make that two.
And kiss my grits.
Noonch.
(the Waitress leaves; to
Holden)
D'jever watch 'Alice'?
That show's
good as hell.
(continues rolling)
So why the long face, Horse?
Banky on
the rag?
HOLDEN
When is he not?
No - I'm just having
some girl trouble.
JAY
Bitch pressing charges?
I get that a
lot.
HOLDEN
No.
I'm just at a point where I don't
know what to do.
JAY
Kick her to the curb.
Girls get to be
too much trouble, there's always the
'band of the hand'.
HOLDEN
Can't do it, g.
I'm in love.
JAY
Ah, there ain't no such thing.
You
gotta boil it all down to the
essentials.
It's like Cube says -
life ain't nothing but bitches and
money.
HOLDEN
Just what I needed - advice from the
'hood
JAY
Who is this girl?
HOLDEN
I don't think you know her.
JAY
Come on man - I'm people who know
people.
HOLDEN
You sound like Barbra Streisand.
JAY
That's 'cause I got this tubby bitch
playing her greatest hits tape in my
ear all the time.
You should see him:
she starts singing 'You Don't Bring Me
Flowers', this faggot starts crying
like a little girl with a skinned knee
and shit.
It's embarrassing.
I got
the only muscle in the world with a
weakness for ballads.
(to Silent Bob)
You big fucking softie.
(to Holden)
So what's this skirt's name!
HOLDEN
I'm telling you, you don't know her.
JAY
I ain't playing.
Tell me her name,
Mysterio.
HOLDEN
Alyssa Jones.
JAY
Finger Cuffs?
Holden rubs his eyes.
JAY
You're dating Finger Cuffs?
Wait a
minute I thought she was all gay and
shit!
HOLDEN
She is.
Or was.
I don't know.
The Waitress returns with the order.
JAY
And you go out with her?
Shit, man -
you're a lucky dog.
She bring other
chicks to bed with you, get a little
of that filet o' fish sammich going
on?
The Waitress stares wide-eyed and offended at Jay.
JAY
(off the Waitress' look)
Yeah - you know what I'm talking
about, baby.
(Waitress
leaves;
to
Holden)
So - four tits, or what?
HOLDEN
It's not like that.
JAY
Well what's it like then?
HOLDEN
Right now?
(beat)
I don't know.
I love her.
But she
has a past
JAY
I'll say.
Stuffin' two guys, eating
chicks out.
Yo - I heard one time,
she had this dog...
HOLDEN
Eat your fucking bagel already!
JAY
(to Silent Bob)
Look at this touchy mother fucker
right here.
(to Holden)
So, if you're all in love with her,
what's the problem?
HOLDEN
The problem is shit like that.
It was
one thing when it was just girls -
that was weird enough.
But now you
throw guys into the mix - two guys at
once, no less.
All that
experience...What am I supposed to
think?
JAY
You think good; because now she'll be
all true blue and shit.
The girl's
tasted life, yo.
Now she's settlin'
for your boring, funny-book-makin'
ass.
HOLDEN
Settling.
That's comforting, Jay.
Thanks.
JAY
That's what I'm here for.
HOLDEN
I'm lust having a problem with all of
it I can't get it out of my head these
visuals of her doing all this shit.
And I don't know why I can't let it
go.
Because I'm crazy about her, you
know?
I look at this girl, I see the
future.
I see kids.
I see grand-
kids.
JAY
You're scaring me.
HOLDEN
I'm scaring myself.
Because I think
so much of her,
and then I can't get
over shit like 'Finger Cuffs'.
(shakes his head)
I don't know what I'm doing.
Holden looks out the window.
Jay continues to roll his
joint.
There's silence. Then...
BOB
You're chasing Amy.
Holden's head snaps forward.
He stares, wide-eyed at
Silent Bob.
HOLDEN
What..what did you say?
BOB
You're chasing Amy.
Holden stares, shocked.
He looks to Jay, who's still
rolling his joint.
JAY
What do you look so shocked for?
He
does this all the time.
Fat bastard
thinks just because he never says
anything, that it'll have some huge
impact when he does open his fucking
mouth.
BOB
Why don't you shut up?
Jesus!
Always
yap, yap, yapping all the time.
Give
me a fucking headache.
(to Holden)
I went through something like what
you're going through.
Years ago.
Same kind of thing with a girl named
Amy.
JAY
When?
BOB
A couple of years ago.
JAY
What'd she 'Live in Canada' or
something?
Why don't I remember this?
BOB
What you don't know about me I can
just about squeeze into the Grand
fucking Canyon.
Did you know I always
wanted to be a dancer in Vegas?
Jay and Holden look at him.
Silent Bob busts a move with
his hands.
BOB
Hunhh?
Bet you didn't know that?
JAY
Just cell your fucking story so we can
get out of here and smoke this.
BOB
(to Holden)
So there's me an Amy, and we're all
inseparable, right?
Just big time in
love.
And then about four months in,
I ask about the ex-boyfriend.
Dumb
move, I know, but you know how it is -
you don't really want to know, but you
just have to... stupid guy bullshit.
Anyway she starts telling me all about
him - how they dated for years, lived
together, her mother likes me better,
blah, blah, blah - and I'm okay.
But
then she tells me that a couple times,
he brought other people to bed with
them - menage a tois, I believe it's
called.
Now this just blows my mind.
I mean, I'm not used to that sort of
thing, right?
I was raised Catholic.
JAY
Saint Shithead.
Silent Bob backhands him.
Jay raises his fist as if to
strike.
BOB
Do something.
(to Holden)
So I get weirded out, and just start
blasting her, right?
This is the only
way I can deal with it - by calling
her a slut, and telling her that she
was used - I mean, I'm out for blood I
want to hurt her - because I don't
know how to deal with what I'm
feeling.
And I'm like "What the fuck
is wrong with you?"
and she's telling
me that it was that time, in that
place, and she didn't do anything
wrong, so she's not gonna apologize.
So I tell her it's over, and I walk.
JAY
Fucking a.
BOB
No, idiot.
It was a mistake.
I
wasn't disgusted with her, I was
afraid.
At that moment, I felt small -
like I'd lacked experience, like I'd
never be on her level or never be
enough for her or something.
And what I didn't get was that she
didn't care.
She wasn't looking for
that guy anymore.
She was looking for
me.
But by the time I realized this,
it was too late, you know.
She'd
moved on, and all I had to show for it
was some foolish pride, which then
gave way to regret.
She was the girl,
I know that now.
But I pushed her
away...
Everyone's silent Silent Bob lights a cigarette.
BOB
So I've spent every day since then
chasing Amy...
(takes a drag from his smoke)
So to speak.
They sit there for a beat.
Jay pockets the rest of his
dime-bag.
JAY
Enough of this fucking melodrama.
My
advice - forget her, dude.
There's
one woman in the world.
One woman,
with many faces.
(to Silent Bob)
Get up, bitch
(to Holden)
We gotta book.
We're catching a bus
to Chi-town.
HOLDEN
What's there?
JAY
Business, yo.
How many more of those
phat envelopes do we got coming to us?
HOLDEN
I don't know.
I don't know if the
book's going to be around much longer.
JAY
Yeah?
Good.
I'll be glad as shit
when it's gone.
HOLDEN
Are you kidding me?
There's millions
of people out there that'd love to see
themselves in a comic book.
JAY
I know.
I spend every fucking waking
hour with one of them.
But it ain't
like us at all - all slapsticky and
shit - running around like dicks,
saying... What's that shit you got me
saying?
HOLDEN
Snootchie-bootchies.
JAY
'Snootchie-bootchies'.
Who talks like
that?
That's baby-talk.
(slaps his hand)
It's a big world, g - but we're bound
to run into you again.
Until then -
keep your unit on you.
HOLDEN
I'll try.
BOB
Do, or do not - there is no ay.
JAY
(slaps him)
Knock it off!
Get your fat ass moving
- we got a bus to catch.
(under his breath)
Jedi-bitch.
Exit Jay and Silent Bob.
Holden remains in the booth,
thinking.
MONTAGE - AN UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE
1) Holden sits at his drawing table, tapping his pencil
up and down.
2)Alyssa sits in a club, getting talked at by some women.
She's not present in the conversation.
3) Banky meets with Sloss at a restaurant Sloss shakes
the contracts at him, and Banky makes the "I know, I
know," face.
4) Holden stares at the picture Alyssa gave him.
5) Alyssa with her ear to the phone.
She hangs up,
angrily.
6) Holden sits in the park that he and Alyssa walked
through.
He's staring at Alyssa's yearbook picture.
He
closes the book and sighs.
Then, an idea hits him.
He
jumps up and dashes out of the park.
INT STUDIO - NIGHT
Banky and Alyssa sit on the couch.
Holden paces in front
of them.
HOLDEN
I know you're wondering why I asked
you both here tonight, at the same
time, knowing that we have shit to
settle between us, separately.
BANKY
I just figured you wanted to kill two
birds with one stone by telling her to
fuck off with me here so you didn't
have to go through the story again
later on.
ALYSSA
Fuck you.
BANKY
Not even if you let me videotape it.
HOLDEN
Enough!
(they both look at him)
I've been going through things, over
and over.
And I dissected it all, and
looked at it a thousand different
ways.
Banky - there's friction
between us for the first time in our
lives.
You hate me dating Alyssa and
you want me to sign off on this M-TV
thing.
BANKY
How perceptive.
HOLDEN
Alyssa - you and I hit a wall, because
I don't know how to deal with... your
past, I guess.
BANKY
That's a nice way of putting it.
I'd
have said the whole double-stuff
thing...
HOLDEN
(right in his face)
I'm only going to say it once: shut
up.
(back to pacing)
Now - I know I'm to blame one way or
the other on both accounts.
With you,
Alyssa - it's my fault because I feel
inadequate.
Because you've had so
much experience, had such a big life;
and my life's been pretty small in
comparison.
ALYSSA
That doesn't matter to me...
HOLDEN
Please.
I have to get through this.
(beat)
And with you Banky - I know why you're
having such a hard time with Alyssa,
and it's something that's been obvious
forever, but I guess I just didn't
acknowledge it.
(takes a deep breath)
You're in love with me.
BANKY
(makes a face; beat)
What?
HOLDEN
You're attracted to me.
Just as, in a
way, I'm attracted to you.
I mean, it
makes sense - we've been together so
long, we have so much in common...
BANKY
(getting up)
Well, I've got to get home and catch
the last few minutes of 'Babylon 5',
so I'll be...
Holden grabs him, kisses him full on the lips, and pushes
him back onto the couch Alyssa reacts.
Banky - wide-eyed
and speechless - looks away.
HOLDEN
It's something you're going to have to
deal with.
Bank.
You may very well
be gay, which explains your homophobia
and why you're so jealous of Alyssa,
and your sense of humor as well.
BANKY
Just 'cause a guy's got a predilection
coward dick jokes...
HOLDEN
Bank.
Stop.
Deal with it.
You'll
feel much better.
He grabs a chair from the side of the room.
HOLDEN
Now - at this point, you may be asking
yourself the question that I've been
going over and over in my head for the
last few days: what does one have to
do with the other?
Alyssa's face drops.
She subtly shakes her head.
ALYSSA
(under her breath)
Don't.
HOLDEN
And when I did some serious soul-
searching, it came at me from out of
nowhere, and suddenly it all made
sense - a calm came over me.
I know
what we have to do.
And then you -
Bank, you Alyssa, and I - all of us...
can finally be... alright.
ALYSSA
(again, under her breath)
Please don't say it.
HOLDEN
(sits in the chair; takes a
long beat)
We've all got to have sex together.
The room is silent.
Holden Lights a cigarette.
Banky's
eyes nearly bug.
Alyssa's
head drops.
HOLDEN
Don't you see?
That would take care
of everything.
Alyssa - I wouldn't
feel inadequate or too conservative
anymore.
I'll have done something on
par with all the experience you've
had.
And it'll be with you, which'll
make it that much more powerful.
And
Banky - you can cake that leap that
everyone else but you sees that you
should take.
And it'll be okay,
because it'll be with me - your best
friend for years.
We've been
everything to each other but
intimates.
And now, we'll have been
through that together too.
And it
won't have to be a total leap for you,
because a woman will be involved.
And
when it's over, all that aggression
you feel toward Alyssa will be gone.
Because you'll have shared in
something beautiful with the woman I
love.
It'll be cathartic.
A true
communion.
We have to do this.
For
me, for both of you... for all of our
sakes.
This will keep us together.
(beat)
What do you say?
Banky stares forward, wide-eyed.
He leans back into the
couch and lets out a huge sigh.
Then shrugs.
BANKY
Sure.
Holden smiles at his friend.
Then he looks at Alyssa.
HOLDEN
You know I need this.
You know it'll
help.
Alyssa looks at him, sadly.
ALYSSA
No.
Holden reacts, shocked Banky lets out a sigh of relief.
HOLDEN
No?
I... I thought you'd be into
this.
ALYSSA
You did?
What does that say about me?
HOLDEN
But you've... you've done... stuff...
like this.
This should be no big deal
for you.
ALYSSA
You don't want this.
(lights her cigarette)
You really don't want this.
Trust me.
HOLDEN
I need this.
This has to happen.
Why
can't you see that?
And how can you
not?
What does that say about me?
You can take it from two guys whose
names you can barely remember, but I
ask you to share an experience like it
- where it's about intimacy - and you
say no?
ALYSSA
(inhales from her cigarette,
takes a beat)
I can't.
Holden moves to her side of the couch.
HOLDEN
You can.
I'll be there.
And when
it's over, we'll be the strongest
we've ever been because we got through
some nasty shit together.
And we'll
finally be on the same level together.
And then there'll be nothing we can't
accomplish.
A tear rolls down her cheek She looks at him, sadly, and
touches his face.
ALYSSA
Oh Holden.
(trying to compose herself)
That time is over for me.
I've been
there.
I've done it.
And I didn't
find what I was looking for in any of
it.
I found that in you - in us.
Doing this won't help you forget about
the things you're hung up on.
It'll
create more.
HOLDEN
No it won't.
I thought about all of
that.
ALYSSA
No, it will.
Maybe you'll see me
differently from then on - maybe
you'll despise me for going along with
it, once you're in the moment.
Maybe
I'll moan differently and then you'll
resent Banky, and become suspicious of
us.
Or you'll alienate him because of
it, and then grow to blame and hate me
for the deterioration of your
friendship.
Or what if- I sincerely
doubt it, but what if - I saw
something in Banky that I never saw
before, and fell in love with him and
left you.
I've been down roads like
this before; many times.
I know you
feel doing this will broaden your
horizons and give you experience.
But
I've had those experiences on my own.
I can't accompany you on your's.
I'm
past that now.
(touches his face; stares to
cry)
Or maybe I just love you too much.
And I feel hurt and let down that
you'd want to share me with anyone.
Because I never wanted to share you
(holds it in; gets up)
Regardless I can't be a part of this.
(beat)
Or you.
Not anymore
(hugs him)
I love you.
I always will.
Know
that.
She releases him, then slaps him.
ALYSSA
But I'm not your fucking whore.
Alyssa storms away, stopping briefly to look Banky up and
down.
ALYSSA
He's your's again.
She walks our of the studio.
The door closes behind her.
Banky and Holden stand there, silently.
Cut to black.
INT COMIC BOOK SHOW - DAY
It's ONE YEAR later.
We're at another show, not unlike
the one from the opening.
A copy of 'Bluntman and Chronic' enters the frame.
The
cover reads 'The Death Chronic', complete with a
corresponding drawing.
BANKY V.O.
Blast from the past.
Banky sits at his own signing table.
Behind him hangs a
banner that reads 'BANKY EDWARDS - CREATOR Of BABY DAVE'.
A small line is formed in front of him.
He talks with a
FAN.
FAN
Do you know how much it's going for
these days?
One ten.
You signing it
will push that up even higher,
BANKY
If you sell it, I want a kickback
(starts signing)
FAN
I don't know if this is true, but I
heard once that there was going to be
an animated series.
BANKY
There was going to be
FAN
What happened!
BANKY
(off comic)
You're looking at it.
No Chronic - no
cartoon
FAN
That sucks man.
That would've been
awesome.
BANKY
Tell me about it
FAN
Is that what happened to you and
Holden McNeil?
You got into a fight
over the rights or something?
BANKY
It was a little more involved than
that.
FAN
Whatever happened to him?
BANKY
He quit the biz.
I guess.
FAN
You guys don't talk anymore?
BANKY
(looks OC)
No.
Not really.
Banky locks eyes with someone OC.
His expression
softens.
Holden leans against a wall on the far side of the room.
He smiles at Banky.
Banky smiles back, and sort of nods.
Holden holds up a copy of Banky's new solo comic.
He
points to it and gives a thumbs up.
OC FAN
Probably shouldn't have killed off
Chronic.
Banky smiles to OC.
BANKY
Guess not.
Some doors just shouldn't
be opened.
Banky looks in another direction, OC.
He looks at Holden
and points to it.
Holden looks in the same direction,
and then looks back at Banky and nods.
OC FAN
You don't need that guy, anyway.
You
do great stuff without him.
Banky looks at Holden for a beat.
Then he brings his
pointer fingers together,
mimicing Holden's 'shared
moment' gesture.
Holden shrugs slightly, then crosses his fingers - as if
to say 'hopefully'.
OC FAN
You were just carrying that guy,
anyway.
Banky sort of smiles at the OC Holden.
Then he offers
his own thumbs up - as to say 'good luck'.
BANKY
(to fan, still looking OC)
You're so right.
Holden smiles back, nods 'bye', and walks off.
OC FAN
Well, keep up the good work, man.
Love them dick jokes.
Love 'em.
See
ya.
The Fan Leaves, but Banky is watching Holden go.
BXVKY
Yeah.
Bye.
(shakes it off)
Okay.
Who's next?
Alyssa sits at a separate signing table, with a line in
front of her.
A WOMAN behind her.
Alyssa dashes off
signatures in the copies of her comic.
ALYSSA
(to OC departing fan)
Thanks for reading it.
The Woman stands and rubs her shoulders.
WOMAN
I'm going to get a soda.
You want
anything?
ALYSSA
I'm fine, thanks,
The Woman heads off.
Alyssa starts rummaging through her
bag.
ALYSSA
(not rooking up)
Okay, who's next!
A comic book drops on the table in front of her.
It's a
comic book called 'Chasing Amy'.
She leafs through it, not looking up.
ALYSSA
Um... This isn't one of mine.
OC HOLDEN
It's mine.
Alyssa looks up sharply.
Holden stands before her, smiling.
HOLDEN
I saved you one.
ALYSSA
Hi.
HOLDEN
Hi.
ALYSSA
(beat)
How've you been?
HOLDEN
Good.
Really good.
Yourself?
ALYSSA
Good
(beat; off her own comic)
New issue's selling like crazy, for
some reason.
HOLDEN
Because it's so good.
I really liked
it.
ALYSSA
Thank you.
(off comic)
I haven't even seen this yet.
Did it
just come out?
HOLDEN
A month ago.
I did a really small
run.
Self-financed.
Only about five
hundred issues.
ALYSSA
Will I enjoy it?
HOLDEN
You might.
It's familiar subject
matter.
Alyssa leafs through it.
Her eyes get somewhat misty.
ALYSSA
Looks Like a very personal story.
HOLDEN
I finally had something personal to
say.
They look at each other for a beat
HOLDEN
I'm going to go.
I don't want to hold
up the line.
ALYSSA
Yeah.
I mean, it can get ugly.
I
just saw this nun in line call this
small child a cunt-rag.
HOLDEN
(smiles)
Read that, when you have a minute
ALYSSA
I will.
HOLDEN
I'd like to hear your thoughts about
it.
If you get a chance, give me a
call.
ALYSSA
Okay.
They look at each other for a beat.
HOLDEN
Nice seeing you again,
ALYSSA
Really nice to see you too.
He walks away.
A few steps away, he turns and waves
again.
She waves back.
And then he starts moving
through the thrall of fan-boys.
The Woman returns with coffee.
She follows Alyssa's
gaze.
WOMAN
who was that?
ALYSSA
Hmm!
Oh.
Just some guy I knew.
She watches him go for another beat, then.
ALYSSA
(to line)
Next
(to Woman)
So what do you want to do tonight?
And as they fall into conversation, the show goes on.
