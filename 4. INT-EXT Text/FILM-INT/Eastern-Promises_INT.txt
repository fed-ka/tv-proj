The shutters are drawn. OZIM (a plump middle-aged Turk)
is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (SOYKA).
Soyka is a Chechen, well-groomed, wearing a sharp suit
beneath the barber's gown.
During the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and
star-shaped tattoos on Soyka's arms and hands.
Ozim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters.
Soyka speaks
with a Russian accent.
OZIM
Guvenilmez... daginik... bloody

Amca it's Christmas?... Christmas!
We're Islam!
SOYKA
Oi, how much are you taking off?
OZIM
Christmas! So I said to him...

Ozim brushes some hair off the customer's shoulder and
Ozim finally acknowledges Ekrem, who is shivering and wet
near to the door. Ekrem turns the `Open' sign to `Closed'.
OZIM (CONT'D)
They don't want to work do they.

EKREM

We see for the first time that Ekrem is shaking with fear

SOYKA

Soyka offers Ekrem a hand to shake and Ekrem stares at it
as if it were enchanted...
OZIM
He looks OK, yeah, but he won't do
one lousy thing for me. Here,

Ozim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair-tonic
bottles and hands it to Ekrem, who now looks mortally
terrified.
EKREM
Ozim... memnum etmek.
OZIM
We had a deal now he's backing
out.
SOYKA

Hey Ozim, leave the kid alone.
It's obviously a psychological

The CHEMIST is delivering advice in Gujurati to a CUSTOMER.
Tatiana wipes rain from her face and the Chemist and the
customer react to her ragged appearance.
TATIANA

Please... I have...

For methadone I need to see paper

The customer looks at Tatiana's feet and reacts. We see
blood trickling down her legs. Tatiana looks down, then
faints onto the floor.

We see Tatiana unconscious on a wheeled trolley bursting
through double doors into the operating ward of Trafalgar

A tiny brown handbag is being shaken empty by a nurse.
Tatiana is being prepared for an emergency Caesarean. The
theater is full of people in scrubs, including an
anesthetist. Monitors and drips are being attached at double
speed.
We notice that her arms are already dotted with festering
needle marks.
A nurse searches through the contents of the handbag and
we can hear frantic activity from the operating table....
NURSE 1
Her stats are very poor, very poor.
Baby's very distressed.
Anna approaches the nurse, who is rummaging through the
contents of the bag. We see a business card from a
restaurant called `The Trans-Siberian', a St. Christopher
necklace and a tiny battered diary. Anna grabs the diary.
JUNIOR DOCTOR
Shoulder distocia, I think.
Stuck

Cut to Anna at Tatiana's head.
Anna strokes her face and

We need to get the baby out now.
Aziz knows he can take Anna's word...
AZIZ
OK, let's go.
All hell is let loose. As the Caesarean process begins at
frantic speed, we slowly zoom in on Tatiana's unconscious
face and hear her voice in V.O... a young girl's voice
speaking with an Russian accent. The crosstalk between
nurses and doctors becomes more and more frantic.
TATIANA (V.O.)
My name is Tatiana. My father
died in the mines in my village,
so he was already buried when he
died. We were all buried there.
Buried under the soil of Russia.
That is why I left to find a better
life.
We hear... a baby cry. Anna's face appears in our framed
shot of Tatiana's face. She gently kisses Tatiana's cheek.
ANNA

You had a girl.
A sheet is pulled over Tatiana's face. A nurse weighs the
screaming baby. Anna wipes her brow with the back of her

There is a gentle knock at the door, which opens before

Anna is pouring two glasses of sherry. Helen is peeling

share a moment of stifled emotion. Helen wipes her eyes

HELEN
It's the chicken.

The smell of chicken roasting
reminds me of him.
ANNA
You should have done beef, then.
They look at each other and giggle. They both have potato
peelers in their wet hands, sleeves rolled up, two practical
unsentimental women being almost consumed by the same wave
of emotion.
HELEN
It wouldn't be Christmas without
tears in the gravy, would it.
We hear a gruff Russian voice calling out from the living

Inside the kitchen there is an inferno of activity, steam,

others in chefs' uniforms, are standing over steaming pots,
laughing, arguing. Children play and yell. You can almost
smell Christmas. Anna enters, dazzled by it all,
overwhelmed by the contrast to her own lifeless Christmas
kitchen. Semyon calls out to everyone.
SEMYON
Come, come, hurry, hurry.
They

Ok, show me this card.
Anna reaches into her pocket and produces the `Trans-

angles his head to look as he stirs.

It is the old card. From before

Two of the little girl violinists are fighting, pulling

Finally Semyon emerges from a cloud of steam with a scrap
of paper.

This is an agency that hires casual
kitchen staff. Maybe you will
have more luck there. But I think
they will be closed until New Year.
As Anna takes the address, Kirill puts his head around

deadly smile and a professional eye.

In a private room in the Special Care Baby Unit, Anna
approaches Tatiana's baby's plastic crib. The baby is
tightly bundled up, sound asleep. Through the windows of
the room, we see the darkened, quiet ward outside - another
world.
Anna stands over the baby, her face full of emotion. There
we see pain, loss, shame, emptiness, isolation. Tears begin
to roll from her eyes, and then she is sobbing soundlessly.

The Trans-Siberian restaurant is smoky with cigarettes and
cigars. The party is in full swing with two dozen guests
and family. One of the golden-haired children is playing
violin badly. The language is Russian, English and Turkish

His mobile phone rings and he wipes his hands on a towel
to answer it.
When he hears the voice, Kirill glances at his father and
moves quickly out of earshot. Semyon notices but hides
his concern. As Kirill walks, a child tugs his leg and
holds up a soft toy, asking a question in Russian.

Nikolai has the body of Soyka laid out on a surface, his
head still bound up in a bin bag, his lower portions bound
up similarly. Nikolai is de-frosting Soyka's left hand
with the hair dryer, concentrating on his ring finger which
has a gold ring on it. The parts of Soyka's shirt and
jacket which are visible are crusted with frozen blood.
Nikolai is wearing rubber gloves.
As he dries, Nikolai takes a sip of coffee. Ozim is
watching this scene with horror. Kirill has his arms
folded, mightily impressed.
Finally the hand is thawed enough for Nikolai to remove
the gold ring. He studies an inscription and then offers
it to Ozim. Ozim shakes his head as if the thing were a
contagion. Nikolai shrugs and pockets it. He then turns
the hair dryer back on and blows some hot air onto the
crisply bloody chest of Soyka. He tugs at the frozen lapel
of the jacket and blows air into the inside pocket. Within
a few moments he is able to remove Soyka's glistening,
thawing wallet which is caked in frozen blood. He opens
it (we glimpse a photo of a wife and children) and blows
hot air onto the money inside.
He tugs a wad of frozen bank notes from the wallet, all
stuck together by drops of frozen blood. He offers this
money to Ozim as well but Ozim shakes his head vigorously.
Kirill hoots with laughter. Ozim is now staring at Nikolai
as if he were a devil from hell.
Nikolai grabs a plastic bag and puts the money inside it,
then pockets the frozen wad. He tosses the rest of the
frozen wallet to Ozim, who instinctively catches it.
NIKOLAI
You'd better burn that.
Ozim, reacting to the cold of the wallet and to the horror
of it, drops the thing on the floor. Nikolai looks at
Ozim as if he were a complete amateur.

I'm too sad. Next Christmas isn't
for another hundreds and hundreds
of days.
Semyon takes her onto his knee. As he does, we see, for
the first time, an eagle tattoo on his wrist.
SEMYON
But you have had so many presents.
The girl wafts Semyon's cigar smoke.
MARIA
You shouldn't smoke, Grandpa.
SEMYON
I know.
Semyon cuddles Maria and stubs his cigar.
Anna smiles at the warm family scene, perhaps remembering
her own father.

Nikolai heaves Kirill into a chair. Semyon is back at his
novel and watches as Kirill attempts to get to his feet
and then stumbles to the floor. He slumps down, now
totally unconscious, breathing deeply. Nikolai smiles.
NIKOLAI
We went to a Kurdish place. They
don't even celebrate Christmas.
Semyon steps up to where Kirill is lying and stands over
him for a moment. Then he kicks him hard in the guts with
all his might. Nikolai is shocked, and grabs Semyon's
arm. A hand laid upon him is like deadly poison. Kirill
grunts and moans.

Semyon kicks him hard in the guts again.

Nikolai steps in between Semyon and Kirill. Semyon is
shocked that anyone should face him like this.
SEMYON
Who... the fuck... are you to tell

Nikolai's face hardens.
NIKOLAI
We're partners.
Nikolai looks down at Kirill.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
He's thunder, I'm lightning. He

SEMYON
I hired you as a driver...
Semyon bends to roughly hoist Kirill into a chair.
SEMYON (CONT'D)
...someone to stop him killing
himself.
NIKOLAI
Well, you got more than a driver.
Nikolai reaches into his pocket for a business card and
offers it to Semyon. As Semyon looks at the card in the
candle light, he also sees the TATTOO OF AN EAGLE on
Nikolai's hand.
It is obvious that the tattoo means more than the card to
Semyon, and he reacts.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

A large tent has been erected over the body of Soyka. Inside
the tent two senior police officers await the arrival of a
third man, a specialist from the Russian desk (YURI), who
is not dressed for the weather. He has obviously been
dragged out of bed. He is led to the side of the body.
One of the officers pulls up the dead man's hand and shows
him the eagle tattoo.
OFFICER
We think he might be Russian Mafia.
Yuri studies the tattoo, then borrows a torch. He crouches
to push up the wet trouser leg on the corpse's right leg.
When the knee is exposed in torch light we see a small
star tattooed on the knee cap.
YURI
He is actually a Chechen. He is
also a member of the vory v zakone.
The stars on the knees mean he
would never kneel before anyone.
Yuri opens the dead man's shirt and we see a tattoo of an
eight-pointed star on his chest.

We are in HARLESDEN, NORTH LONDON.
A large portable stereo is playing rock music.
The curtains are drawn against daylight. The living room
is decorated in seventies suburban style, but with the
wall paper peeling and the paint work fading. Kitsch
paintings still decorate the walls.
Six young East-European girls are sitting on a broken-down
sofa and on hard-backed chairs, wearing short skirts. Their
eyes are sunken and their faces vacant of expression, but
they are painted with so much make-up they almost look
like tiny, sad clowns.
They sit in silence as the music blares out. After a few
moments a young Albanian man enters and claps his hands.

All the girls apart from one immediately get to their feet

awkwardly and painfully. The Albanian approaches the one
girl who refused to stand and yanks her to her feet.
He slaps her hard and hisses at her in Albanian. She tries
to sit down again but he pulls her up and slaps her again.
Finally he shoves her into the middle of the room and she
begins to dance, sobbing as she does.

Kirill and Nikolai are swigging whisky from the bottle and
dancing with the girls. Some of the girls are drinking,

and swinging his girl around faster and faster until she
falls over.
Nikolai swigs his drink and notices the girl who refused
to stand up. She is standing in the corner, sobbing.
Nikolai doesn't care to look at her for more than a second
and he goes back to dancing.
After a moment Kirill dances his way over to Nikolai and
yells above the music.
KIRILL
OK, which one you going to fuck!?
NIKOLAI

What's it to you?
KIRILL

Nikolai is fucking the girl, who is now silent.
She is on

Kirill is leaning against the wall, drinking wine from the
bottle, watching Nikolai with burning eyes, his lust and
drunken jealousy mixing together. Nikolai grits his teeth
and comes inside the girl. Kirill whoops and whistles and
begins to applaud.
The girl is still silent, expressionless.
KIRILL
You did OK!

Nikolai glares at Kirill.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
Well if my examination is over,

Kirill grins and offers the girl an elaborate bow before
leaving. Finally alone, Nikolai gently helps the girl to
lie down. She is numb. He covers her up with a blanket
then begins to pull on his clothes. The girl is staring up
at the ceiling.
After a few moments she begins to sing a Russian folk song
softly under her breath. Nikolai speaks to her softly in
Russian.

In the half-lit private room, Anna is dancing with Christine
in her arms. She is singing a lullaby softly to her. The
door is open to the rest of the ward and all the other
babies are silent.
Finally she lays a sleeping Christine back in her crib.
She sits down on the bed where the mother should be. She
curses herself silently and gets to her feet, determined
to pull herself together.
As she starts to leave the private room to enter the ward,
she is suddenly confronted by Semyon.
He is standing in the shadows, a Bavarian trilby in his
hands. Anna gasps with shock. Semyon speaks softly...

Tatiana's V.O. slowly blends into Stepan's voice...
STEPAN
...like potato sacks. Kirill came
down after me and he hit me until
I was bleeding. Then he tried to
rape me but he couldn't do it...
He just got madder and madder and
kept hitting me. In the end his
father came down. It was the father
who raped me. He shouted at his
son...'if you don't break a horse,
it will never be tame, Kirill'.

Is Semyon too drunk to notice? There is a strange game
going on here. For now, nothing is revealed.
Semyon knocks back his vodka and Nikolai does the same.
Semyon picks up the diary and holds it into the flame of
the candle. It begins to burn and he drops it into the
ashtray. The flames flicker for a while.
SEMYON (CONT'D)
The midwife said she had an uncle.
A Russian.

The place has two dozen customers and there is a Russian

The place is winding up. Chefs and waiters are cleaning

is cutting and wrapping the birthday cake in small parcels
of golden paper. He works intensely and delicately at the

swigs a half-drunk glass of wine.
KIRILL

NIKOLAI

The cellar is half lit, the arched walls lined with crates

Nikolai walks down the steps into the gloom, he hears Kirill
singing a Russian folk song to himself as he drags a case
of brandy across the cellar floor.
Kirill has already opened a bottle of brandy and takes a
long swig as Nikolai joins him. He grins as he gestures
at the brandy...
KIRILL
My dad swapped a little Georgian

Nikolai sits down on a crate, rests his head against the

The vory behind the table greet him.
Then Nikolai takes off his jacket and removes his tie. He
then takes off his shirt, to reveal that his upper body is
decorated with elaborate tattoos (details to follow).
He carefully places his shirt over the chair then sits

pushing a candle across the table to better illuminate the

VALERY
We can see that you were in prison

NIKOLAI
My father was a government worker.
He fixed the cars of officials. I
began by selling the spare parts
when I was fifteen.
VALERY
You have no forced tattoos?
NIKOLAI
None.
GYPSY
You were not co-operative?
NIKOLAI
I spent two years in the punishment

VALERY
You went through the Crosses in
St. Petersburg?
NIKOLAI
I was in solitary confinement
fifteen times. I was called 'The
Stump' because they couldn't shift
me.
VALERY
Your father was a bitch and a weak
fucker for working with the
Government, that's right isn't it?
Nikolai flickers a little.

VALERY
That is why there is an empty place
above your heart. Where the stars
will go. And why there is an empty
place on your knees.
NIKOLAI
I am dead already. I died when I
was fifteen. Now I live in the
zone all the time.
GYPSY
You have never worked for the
government? Any government?
NIKOLAI
I have lived off Albanians and
Georgians. I steal from them within
the law.
The questions and answers are delivered with great
solemnity, making the ceremony feel almost religious.
Candles burn, the men all sip water.
Semyon is silent throughout but listens attentively.
Towards the end of the interview there is the ghost of a
smile on the Gypsy's face and this pleases Semyon.

The needle bites at Nikolai's skin as the old tattooist
wipes away the blood.
Then we see the needle working on the empty spaces above
Nikolai's heart, tattooing the star symbol.
Nikolai now has a star tattoo on each knee and two eight-

Nikolai is sweating hard, staring at the ceiling. The

can't see who has entered.
NIKOLAI
Ozim?
He sees a shape... a clothed body. He realizes immediately.
Suddenly one of the brothers is upon him and has him in a
head lock. He strokes the tattoo on Nikolai's chest as if
this were confirmation of who this is. He grunts an
instruction and his brother emerges through the steam with
an open razor.
Nikolai is naked, alone.
Suddenly he kicks the razor guy in the balls and uses a
martial arts chop to free himself from the other brother.
In the steam there are boots and bare feet and knees and
fingers flying. Nikolai manages to gouge the eye of one
brother and throw another against the wall. He obviously
has serious combat training but the brothers are strong
and angry.
Suddenly Nikolai is slashed across the arm by the razor
and blood oozes into the steam and hot water. All the men
are slipping and falling on the blood and hot water.
Another slash of the razor cuts his thigh open. All the
men are now covered in blood and Nikolai, with a final
surge of strength, manages to cripple one brother with a
blow to the throat, and the other with an elbow to the
temple.
As the Chechens slump to the floor, Nikolai fumbles in the
bloody water for the razor, finds it, kneels, and slashes
their throats. He lurches to his feet, drops the razor,
and staggers out of the steam room.

police doctor with a medical bag sitting at the next table,
waiting. The whole scene is rendered surreal by all the
balloons which bounce around them. Semyon is in full
charming old man mode.
SEMYON
(in Russian)
You'll have a drink, Yuri...
He is half on his feet.
YURI
(in Russian)
I don't drink on duty.
SEMYON
(in Russian)
Sometimes I don't believe you are
really Russian.
YURI
(in Russian)
I've told you, I am half Russian.
SEMYON
(in Russian)
Then have half a drink.
Yuri shakes his head.
Semyon goes to the optic and helps
himself to a vodka.

SEMYON (CONT'D)
So what is all this nonsense?
YURI
We just need a blood sample.
SEMYON
For what?
YURI
We can take the sample right now
voluntarily or I can get an order
from the court. It's up to you.
Semyon glances at the doctor and chuckles.
SEMYON
(in Russian)
He sits there like a vampire.
YURI
(in Russian)
What, you are afraid of needles,
Semyon?
Semyon's face hardens and he glares at Yuri.
SEMYON
I am afraid of... conspiracies.
A pause.
Yuri speaks softly.
YURI
I will return tomorrow with a court
order.
He gets to his feet.
SEMYON
Wait.
I've done nothing wrong.
Semyon begins to roll up his sleeve, revealing a long scroll
of tattoos.
Then a needle is being pushed into Semyon's arm by the
doctor. Semyon's face doesn't flicker. He stares into
Yuri's eyes.

Kirill is preparing food for the night's festivities.
Semyon enters and goes straight to the sink. He pulls off
the plaster from his arm where the blood was taken and
pours some vodka over the tiny puncture hole.
KIRILL
What did they want with you, papa?
SEMYON
To poison me.
Semyon pours more vodka on the wound then takes a swig.
SEMYON (CONT'D)
They took blood from me with a
needle. Probably the same needle
they use for all the junkies and
whores and blacks and queers.
He glares at Kirill as he rolls his sleeve down.
SEMYON (CONT'D)
Now I probably have the fucking
queer disease.
Kirill has his back turned, doesn't react.
Semyon sits
heavily. Finally...
KIRILL
Why would they want your blood,
papa?
For the first time Semyon looks vulnerable and confused as
he admits....
SEMYON
I don't know.
Kirill is surprised to see his father unsure.
He peers at
him.
SEMYON (CONT'D)
Someone is ahead of me. I don't
like people ahead of me.
Kirill is now unnerved by Semyon's quiet confusion. He
watches as Semyon grabs at the bottle of vodka to drink.
He speaks softly as he swigs.

SEMYON (CONT'D)
(softly)
What the hell did that cocksucker
want with my blood?
Kirill is reluctant to speak at first but eventually chances
his arm.
KIRILL
Maybe it's about the baby.
SEMYON
(swigging)
What baby?
A pause.
KIRILL
Some bitch was out there saying
you were the father of a baby.
Semyon turns to Kirill, his face hardening...
SEMYON
What are you talking about?
Semyon approaches and Kirill gets scared.
KIRILL
It was nothing. Just some bitch...
SEMYON
Who?
KIRILL
The woman from the hospital.
The
midwife.
Semyon stares into Kirill's eyes and Kirill mistakes his
frantic thought process for anger. Kirill backs away.
Semyon is beginning to catch up.

Anna is walking down a corridor with her crash helmet in
her hand, heading for another shift.

We are close on Kirill's face as he studies a map of the
hospital near the elevators.
Anna comes down a stairwell and spots Kirill - she
especially notices the roses - just as he gets into an
elevator. The elevator doors close. Was it really him?
Anna is not sure. She frowns.
93

A door opens and Kirill steps into striped moonlight.
Clamping the roses under his arm, he pulls a black zip-up
sports bag from under his coat. After a brief dialogue
with himself, he produces a half bottle of vodka and takes
a swig. Then he hurries on.

NIGHT
Anna walks onto the ward in her uniform. She checks a few
stats as she walks by various beds. She then glances over
at Christine's private room. She tiptoes into the room
and goes to the crib. She finds it empty - except for a
bunch of red roses. Outside the ward is now filling up
with visitors. Babies cry, people laugh.
Anna goes back out to the ward and calls to a nurse.
ANNA
Sonya! Is someone bathing
Christine?
SONYA
No.
She's in her cot.
ANNA
(calmly)
Well she's not. She's not.

Anna runs fast down the corridor towards the hospital exit.
She spots Nikolai ahead of her.
She pushes past a couple of drunks and flies at him.
ANNA
Where have they taken Christine?!
Nikolai reacts.
ANNA (CONT'D)
You bastards!! Where will he take
her?! Tell me!!
People back away as Nikolai grabs Anna's arms and holds
her still.
NIKOLAI
What are you talking about?!
Anna studies Nikolai's face and sees his genuine confusion.
She calms down a little.
ANNA
Kirill. Kirill has taken Christine.
I saw him here! I thought he was
coming to see you, but he wasn't,
was he?
Nikolai curses under his breath and thinks fast.
NIKOLAI
You brought your bike?

A summer's day. Anna, Helen and Uncle Stepan are preparing
to eat Sunday lunch. Stepan is carving. The conversation
is jovial as Anna and Helen bring dishes of food to the
table.
Then we hear a baby crying. Anna goes to a small crib and
lifts a six-month-old Christine out. She hands her to
Helen who hugs her. Over this happy scene we hear Tatiana
in V.O., a repeat of the first words we heard her say.
TATIANA (V.O.)
My name is Tatiana. My father
died in the mines in my village,
so he was already buried when he
died...
Anna takes Christine back and takes her to the window to
peer outside, staring across the park.

Nikolai is sitting at a window table, alone, sipping vodka,
staring back across the park. He peers out at ordinary
life going on in the streets outside. Tatiana's V.O.
continues...
TATIANA (V.O.)
We were all buried there. Beneath
the soil of Russia. That is why I
left to find a better life.
Nikolai finishes his drink.
