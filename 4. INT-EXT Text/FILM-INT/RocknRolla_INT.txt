WE MEET: MUMBLES(late 30s) and ONE TWO (late 30s). They are
listening to a sales pitch from two REAL ESTATE AGENTS.
We SEE all the relevant pictures of their pitch explaining a
changing city, LONDON.
SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.)
Two years ago this property cost one
million pounds.
(we SEE building)
Today, it costs five million.
The camera WHIP PANS over to another part of the building to
see the other ESTATE AGENT giving his pitch. The camera
will keep this back and forth for the duration of the scene.
OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.)
How did this happen?
(CUT TO relevant
pictures as he speaks)
Attractive tax opportunities for
foreign investment, restrictive
building consent and massive hedge
fund bonuses,...
(beat)
London, my good man, is fast becoming
the financial and cultural capital
of the world.
SLICK ESTATE AGENT
And of course the Russians have come
to town.
OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT
Makes it hard to compete with an ex-
Soviet oligarch that has six billion
dollars in his back pocket. They
don't haggle the price, they double
the price.
SLICK ESTATE AGENT
Russians come, prices rise, and it
doesn't stop. It only goes one way.
OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT
Up.
SLICK ESTATE AGENT
I can't teach you how to skin a cat,
but I can tell you a lot about the
money in bricks and mortar.

Second, with Government policy as it

Uri walks to the bar. Lenny follows trying to contain his

LENNY COLE
Oh, that's a nice picture Uri, hasn't

Uri is at the bar now. He has placed one large tumbler down

illusions of grandeur. A "gold"
packet of "king" size and with a
"regal" insignia. An attractive
implication toward glamour and wealth,
a subtle suggestion that cigarettes
are indeed your "royal" and loyal
friends. And that Pete,...is a lie.

Your other personality is trying to
draw your attention to the flip side

his way down the street. He is punch drunk with mace in his

boys freeze they are fucked, nowhere to go, but CHECHNYAN 1
is blinking profusely he can't be sure where they are. He
lets off a magazine into the manikins next to our boys who
all hit the deck. The magazine runs dry, CHECHNYAN 1 dips
into his belt to extract a fresh one. Mumbles see's his
opportunity, he grabs a golf club that is standing next to
him, runs at CHECHNYAN 1 and takes a massive swipe at his
head. CHECHNYAN 1 goes down, but he has already put in a
new magazine. Mumbles is still carrying the cases, One Two
is attached to his arm.

Shoot him Mumbles or we won't get

A baseball smashes into Mumbles face, he goes down, and he's

coming out of the headset and is now filling the room, someone

VICTOR
Uri is a man born with nothing, carved
his way up the hard way, he's smart,
young and only one thing will stop
him from reaching his goals,...women.
And this woman has become a problem.
(pause)
My job is to protect Uri and in this
department he needs protecting, I
don't like her or trust her and I
want you to follow that snake.
We reveal it's CHECHNYAN 1 our war criminal who is looking
battered from the beating the day before.
CHECHNYAN 1
Leave it with me Victor.

CUT BACK to present with the music being cut off from One
Two's head phones. He opens his eyes, on his throat lies a
very long and sharp knife. The two CHECHNYANS have entered
the room and pulled the wire out of the machine. CHECHNYAN
1 is sitting on a chair next to One Two, he's the one with
the blade. He smiles, One Two doesn't.
124

The music is very loud, it's Russian. Archy and Danny make
their way to it's source, up the stairs, to the bedroom door.
The base thumps out. Archy tries the handle, it turns, he
pushes the door open slowly. The music becomes clear as we
reveal a horrible scene. Archy is shocked, but a little
amused.
Tied to the bed, back to front with a pillow over his head
is One Two. A large blade is resting on his back, a bottle
of vodka is open on the side, One Two cries and wriggles
uselessly.

He is wearing military speedos and fuck all else apart from
his military hat. He is "having much fun." His massive
frame is still black and blue from the beating One Two
previously inflicted. The other Chechnyan (similarly
dressed), is digging into his bag of tools, extracting all
sorts of horrible looking things. Archy looks on amazed by
the show, he has a quick look at Danny who is also bemused.
He hits the "off" button, the Chechnyans spin, looking
distressed. Silence ensues.
ARCHY
Is this a bad time One Two?
ONE TWO
(unable to say anything)
Emmm, emmmmmmmmmmmm.
ARCHY
Shall we come back later?

One Two is being wrapped up in a carpet on the floor. He's
still emmmmmmmmming and wriggling. We hear Handsome Bob and

Archy pays no attention to the door yet, he is on the phone

His face has been slapped into the direction of Roman and
Mickey. Johnny keeps his head still,...
JOHNNY STORY
That, Roman and Mickey, is the famous
Archy slap. I have been magically
transported straight back to my

He speaks next in a little boys voice, he's taking the piss.
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
Don't turn Archy in, he's your friend,
he's loyal, just like the dog.
He changes to impersonate Lenny, its deep and over the top.

Shut up boy, don't stick your nose

So, it's gone now, lost in the world

There is a pause while Lenny considers just shooting him.
He changes his tone, he gets serious and slow.
LENNY COLE
Tell me, what are you boy if you are
not poison? Look what you've left
behind you. Your Dad couldn't even
bear the sight ya, no wonder he fucked

Archy leans forward to take it,
Lenny interrupts wheeling

LENNY COLE
Let me have a look first.
He takes the letters out of Handsome Bob's top pocket and
opens them up. He squints, the print is too small he can't
read what it says.
ARCHY
Here you can't read it without your
glasses, let me have a look.
Lenny looks uncomfortable, Archy almost snatches the letters
and flicks through the pages. He reads to himself, could it

into Lenny's wide open mouth.

Bob and Mumbles)

Danny, who is now in a state because Johnny has predicted
everything he's going to do, suddenly turns with his gun.
Mickey catches it, the force of the stop pulls the trigger,
and the other MANS head is drilled through. Roman joins the
wrestling match and gets the gun and wrist to aim at Danny's
head. The trigger gets squeezed and Danny's head also gets
a drilling. Silence. Johnny, who is smothered in blood,
speaks coolly.

Mickey, pass me the gun.
Mickey is out to lunch, but Johnny sounds commanding.
