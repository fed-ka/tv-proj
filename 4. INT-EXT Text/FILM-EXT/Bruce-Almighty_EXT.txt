Bruce makes it outside, sets Sam down on the grass. Sam
looks up innocently at Bruce, finished.
BRUCE
Oh, you're all done, huh?
B-e-a-utiful.
Bruce pulls up in his Ford Tauras to a cluster of cars
unloading kids. A 2003 MERCEDES SRL passes by.
GRACE
Wow, nice car, huh?
BRUCE
Yeah, if you want to rub your
success in people's faces.
Then Bruce notices a big medical van in front of the school
with a BLOOD DRIVE SIGN.
BRUCE
What's with the hubbub?
GRACE
We're having a blood drive.
BRUCE
Creepy. Needles, yech...
GRACE
Oh, that's a nice response.
9.
BRUCE
I mean, it's just s o . . .
GRACE
Helpful and life saving?
BRUCE
C'mon, that's your...blood. It's
in your body and I don't think it's
supposed to come out. Besides,
they stockpile that stuff. They
have an endless supply frozen in a
warehouse somewhere then tell
everyone there's a shortage.
GRACE
They do not. Now stop it. I'm
*
giving. I have a very rare blood
*
type, AB positive.
BRUCE
Well, I'm IB positive. IB positive
they aint touchin' me with no
needle.
Grace sighs in exasperation, starts out when...
GRACE
(suddenly remembers
something)
O. . .
h
She places a STRING OF PRAYER BEADS on the rearview mirror.
BRUCE
What's that?
GRACE
Prayer beads. The kids made 'em.
Keep you safe.
BRUCE
Well, I hope they work, cause it's
going take a miracle to get me to
work on time.
Bruce is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. He stares at the
prayer beads with a "thanks alot" look.
10.
A big accident ahead. Bruce looks at his watch, he's
screwed. A person is CARRIED BY ON A STRETCHER, Bruce is
oblivious.
BRUCE
This is just my luck.
Bruce's BEEPER sounds.
He checks it.
BRUCE.
The meeting's starting, perfect...
(thinks)
Screw it.
He looks to the right of the car in front of him, then peels
off onto the shoulder, passing tons of cars.
BRUCE
(laughs)
Catch you later, lemmings 1 It's
kill or be killed, only the strong
survive, no guts, no glory1
SFX: SIREN
Bruce pulls over, fumes.
BRUCE
(looking heavenward)
Thank you.
Bruce screeches into a space, races out of the car, bumping
over a trash can, goes back to pick it up, sees a HOMELESS
MAN who sits peacefully next to a paint bucket and sign
boards. The various "warnings" change daily. Today's SIGN
reads:
R EWE BLIND?
Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then
continues on.
Bruce is on his cell phone, while the NEWS CREW races around,
setting up for the report. The FALLS ROAR behind him and the
Mate of the Mist sightseeing boat is in the b.g.
BRUCE
Grace?
INTERCUT DAY CARE AND FALLS
DEBBIE
(cheery)
No, it's Debbie. The sister who's
life you're not wasting.
GRACE
Hey.
Grace GRABS THE PHONE.
DEBBIE
(feigns innocent)
What?
GRACE
Sorry, honey. My sister seems to
think she's my mother. Where are
you?
BRUCE
(flying high)
Oh, A little place called the
winners circle. I'm at the Falls
doing a "live" report.
GRACE
Live? That's greatI
BRUCE
Yep, it's happenin', hun. I got
sweeps and I'm live. You know what
that means?
(MORE)
20.
BRUCE (cont'd)
They're seeing if I can think on my
feet, like you might have to do in
a live news anchor situation.
GRACE
Oh, my gosh.
BRUCE
This is happening for us, Grace.
What we've always talked about.
Jack practically came out and told
me.
Grace quickly switches gears.
She experienced the premature-
celebration before.
GRACE
Wait, what do you mean practically?
BRUCE
Well, he didn't spell it out, but
this is exactly what happened to
Susan Ortega right before she was
bumped up to the desk.
GRACE
(being cautious)
I just want to make sure we're not
getting too ahead of ourselves.
BRUCE
I totally agree, but in the mean
time you should start thinking
about what coast you want to live
on.
Ally interrupts, indicating the time.
BRUCE
Oh, they're calling me, I gotta go.
GRACE
Good luck, honey. I love you.

BRUCE
*
I love you.
*
(hangs up)
*
Debbie turns to Grace.
*
DEBBIE
*
Moooo.

21.
GRACE
*
Stop it.

Ally hustles Bruce toward the bow of the boat, as he places
his ear piece.
ALLY
They want you close to the falls.
BRUCE
What for? I'll get soaked.
ALLY
That's the point.
They want you to
hold up this.
She hands Bruce a very stupid looking, blue "falls" shaped
UMBRELLA with the MAID OF THE MIST INSIGNIA.
ALLY
Part of the condition of us getting
the exclusive.
Bruce takes the umbrella.
'
'
BRUCE
Lovely.
Glad I wore my tap shoes.
ALLY
Remember, this is their 23rd
anniversary. Capacity is 59. They
cater to tourists, honeymooners. . .
BRUCE
And people who are insanely
'
*
thirsty, I get it.

ALLY
And you'll be interviewing Irene
Dansfeild...
She positions A VERY, VERY OLD WOMAN next to Bruce.
ALLY
...She rode on the maiden voyage
with her late husband. Okay, 90

seconds.
Bruce looks upward at the ridiculous umbrella. Mutters
encouragement to himself.
22,
BRUCE
90 seconds, going live. Think
anchor, think dignity,
(glances up toward
umbrella)
Ignore umbrella. Just have fun.
CUT TO:
THE LIVE FEED IN THE CAMERA TRUCK AT THE FALLS
Some of the CREW MEMBERS watch the feed.
ON TV
Pete Fineman is reporting.
PETE FINEMAN
...but because of the fast response
by our local fire fighters, the
toxic chemicals were cleaned up
without incident. Susan.
The female co-anchor, SUSAN ORTEGA:
SUSAN
Bruce Nolan is standing by at
Niagara Falls with a report on the
Maid of the Mist sightseeing boat,
but before we go live to Bruce, we
have an announcement to make. As
everyone knows, after 33 years, our
beloved Pete Fineman is retiring.
Pete smiles a proud, heart-felt smile.
SUSAN
Pete's shoes are virtually
impossible to fill, but the show
must go on. And we could think of
no one better than our very own
Evan Baxter.
ON BRUCE
Listening to the feed. His FACE GOES WHITE.
He stands in
shock.
Evan is seated next to Susan.
23.
SUSAN
Congratulations, Evan. Looks like
we'll be sitting side by side from
now on.
EVAN
Thanks, Susan. I ' m thrilled and
honored. Like you said, no one can
replace the great Pete Fineman, but
I'll do my best. I have to say I
am so proud to be a part of our
local community. Of Buffalo. I
think a great city is a lot like a
great recipe really. Put in some
hard working citizens, add some
care givers, maybe a few nuts...
The other news anchors and Evan himself chuckle at "his"
joke. Bruce listens on the feed, beyond stunned.
EVAN (CONT'D)
All sprinkled with the strength and
love of our good families, that
ultimately creates a sweet place to
live. Thank you.
SUSAN
(touched)
Wow. That was amazing. And now
let's go live to wacky Bruce Nolan
out at Niagara Falls.
Bruce stands like a deer in headlights, drenched, holding the
ridiculous umbrella. Ally sig nals Bruce he's on. He stares
into camera, numb.
Like popping out of a coma, Bruce surges in. Surprisingly,
seems very up and fine.
BRUCE
Thank you, Susan 1 Bruce Nolan here
aboard the Maid of the Mist at
Niagara falls.
BRUCE
First off, "I want to add another
congratulations to Evan Baxter.
It's good to see what someone with
real talent can accomplish when
great opportunities are given to
him instead of me.
(still smiling)
Anyway, I'm here, I believe with
Katherine Hepburn's mom. Tell me,
why did you toss the blue "heart of
the ocean" jewel over the railing
of Titanic?
The Old Woman doesn't know what to say.
BRUCE
Did you feel guilty at all letting
Leonardo Decaprio freeze, while you
were safe floating on the big door?
Do you think he would have survived
if you had taken turns, or were you
too afraid to freeze your big fat
ass off?
Bruce takes off walking, the camera follows.
BRUCE
Now, lets speak to the owner. Come
on in here, Bill.
Bill shakes his head "NO" as Bruce pulls him into frame.
BRUCE
Bill, you.'ve been running the Maid
of the Mist for 23 years. Tell me,
why do you think I didn't get the
anchor job?
BILL
Hey, man, I don't want any--
BRUCE
Do you think it's my hair?
(Bruce messes his hair
like crazy)
Maybe my teeth aren't white enough?
Or like the great falls, is the
bedrock of my life slowly erroding
underneath me.
(moving closer to camera,
to an inch away)
Erroding. Erroooding.
Errodiiiing...
Bruce is now licking the camera lens.
He steps back and
signs-off. Smooth as silk.
BRUCE
I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness
news. Back to you fuckers 1
Bruce is TOSSED OUT THE FRONT DOORS, his box of possessions
spilling on the ground. Bruce FLAILS at the building.
Bruce carries his box to his car, when he HEARS A NOISE.
A street GANG is hassling the HOMELESS SIGN GUY. Pushing him
around, breaking and painting over his signs.
Instinctively, Bruce walks over.
BRUCE
Hey, come on guys. What are you
doin'? Just leave him alone.
They turn, look at Bruce, laugh and head off.
Bruce helps
the Sign Guy up, looks after the Gang.
BRUCE
Yeah, you'd better keep walkin'.
They stop cold, turn back to Bruce and CHARGE AT HIM. Bruce
attempts to run, but they leap on him in a big dog pile,
swinging and kicking.
Bruce is left with a bloody lip, lying beside his car. We
hear the sound of smashing glass and scratching metal and the
gang running off. Bruce slowly gets up.
Reveal Bruce's car, WINDOW'S SMASHED, PAINT SCRAPED and the
word "HERO" KEY SCRATCHED ON THE DOOR.
BRUCE
B-e-a-utiful.
(looks up)
(MORE)
28.
BRUCE (cont'd)
Just what you get for trying to
help someone.
Bruce gets in, pulls out of the parking lot passing the
Homeless Man who sits beaten up holding a scrawled out sign
"LIFE IS. JUST"
BRUCE
Get a clue, buddy.
Bruce stumbles out, surveys his demolished car, then looks at
the beads in his hands. He begins to laugh maniacally.
He spots the lake, starts running toward it like a madman,
HEAVES THE PRAYER BEADS INTO THE LAKE. He looks heavenward,
challenging the Infinite.
BRUCE
Okay, if that's the way you want
it. The gloves are off, pal! Let
me see a little wrath! Smite me oh
mighty smiteri What, no pestilence
no boils? Come on, you got me on
the ropes, don't you want to finish
me off?! You're the one who should
be fired! The only one around here
not doing his job is YOU! What are
we, you're little pet project? A
hobby you tinker with now and
again? Answer me. ANSWER ME!!!
A beat of silence then Bruce's BEEPER GOES OFF. He cynically
chuckles at the timing, checks it, sees 772-5623.
BRUCE
Sorry, don't know you, wouldn't
call you if I did.
Bruce walks off toward his wrecked car, it BEEPS AGAIN.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON - AN ALARM CLOCK
The BEEPING continues. We are in. . .
Bruce runs down the stairs carrying the trickling, Sam.
Bruce sets Sam on the grass. Sam looks up, finished.
BRUCE
What's the point?
BEEP, BEEP, BEEP...
Bruce walks over to the shattered beeper. He picks up a
small piece of it containing the LED read out: 772-5623
ON BRUCE - AMAZED
CUT TO:
An old building on the outskirts of town. A faded sign
painted on the wall reads, OMNI PRESENTS.
Bruce's demolished car enters frame.
He studies the area and
building suspiciously.
Bruce cautiously moves towards the structure and then, STEPS
IN A PUDDLE. He SINKS UP TO HIS KNEE.
BRUCE
Perfect.
He gets out, shakes off his sopping leg, and heads inside.
Bruce barrels out of the building --
BRUCE
Okay, that did not happen.
He races to his car stepping in the SAME PUDDLE, but this
time his foot doesn't sink, he WALKS RIGHT ACROSS IT. He
paus es f or a bea t --
40.
BRUCE
No.
He races on.
Bruce drives, whistling the tune, catches himself,
immediately stops whistling.
BRUCE
Okay, just relax here. I did not
meet God and I do not have his
powers.
(laughs)
If that was God, then I'm Mario
Andretti.
Instantly, Bruce's car PEELS OUT, races through traffic,
dodging and passing cars right and left.
BRUCE
AAAHHHHHHHH!J!
41.
Suddenly there is a GUY IN A RED PIT CREW SUIT standing
before Bruce waving a red flag. Bruce swerves to avoid the
man and SCREECHES into a pit stop. Several other red-suited
Italian men engulf the car. Bruce watches in amazement as the
professional racing team jacks up his car, slaps on HUGE MAG
TIRES, gases him up, etc. PAUL NEWMAN leans into the
driver's window.
PAUL NEWMAN
Hey Mario, did you get that box of
dressing I sent you?
Bruce responds against his will IN PERFECT ITALIAN --
BRUCE
(in perfect Italian)
Si, dovete venire sopra per il
pranzo un certo tempo.
(SUBTITLES: Yes, you must
come over for dinner some
time.)
Bruce reacts shocked.
The crew backs off and urges him on in
Italian.
PIT CREW
Vete l Ve tel
Bruce's car peels out on it's own, he struggles to control
the wheel, finally pulling over to a curb. His car door
won't open so he has to crawl out of the driver's window.
He rushes onto the sidewalk, backing away from his normal
looking Tauras. Not knowing what to do, he slips into a
diner.
God leans down, lets the little soup covered cockroach go.
God and Bruce then walk along the lake shore.
GOD
(re: the cockroach)
Most people want to kill these
guys. I'm quite fond of em'. Very
streamlined design. Like little
armored tanks. Y'know, they can
hold their breath for forty minutes
and their cells divide only once
per molting cycle creating a
cytoskeleton with cell adhesion
that...
(catching himself)
Oh, this is a bit over your head,
isn't it?
Off Bruce's look.
44.
GOD
Okay, let me explain the rules.
BRUCE
Rules ?
GOD
Yeah, you left in such a rush I
didn't get a chance to explain.
BRUCE
Well the two extra fingers freaked
me out a little bit.
GOD
(laughs)
I figured that would get your
attention.. I did the same thing to
Ghandi, he couldn't eat for three
weeks. Now, here's the deal. You
have all my power. Use it any way
you choose. There are only two
rules. You can't tell anyone
you're God. Believe me you don't
want that kind of attention. And
you can't mess with free will.
BRUCE
Uh huh.
Can I-ask why?
GOD
(excited)
Yes you can. That's the beauty it.
Suddenly a LARGE SAILBOAT SAIL PASSES RIGHT BY THEM.
Bruce
looks to the sail, oddly, then...
WIDE ANGLE - REVEAL God and Bruce are now walking ON THE LAKE
about 100 feet from the shore. They watch the sailboat pass.
Bruce is awestruck.
BRUCE
This is amazing.
GOD
Oh, speaking of amazing...
God dips his hand in the Lake and pulls out THE PRAYER BEADS.
He pockets them as he talks.
45.
GOD
Since you're finished with these, I
think I'll hang to 'em. Might come
in handy someday.
WIDE MASTER - BUFFALO CITY-SCAPE
God and Bruce are tiny figures on the river, as God begins to
walk away.
GOD
I'll be seein' ya.
BRUCE
Where are you going?
GOD
I'm taking a vacation.
BRUCE
God can't take a vacation. Can he?
Can you?
GOD
Ever hear of the Dark Ages?
Besides, I'm covered. You can fix
everything in five minutes if you
want to, right?
ON BRUCE
BRUCE
...Right.
Left alone, Bruce begins to carefully tip toe back to shore,
progresses to a full sprint.
Bruce struts down the street the embodiment of confidence.
He turns shooting a finger at a fire hydrant, it BLASTS
WATER. KIDS run off their front steps, start playing.
A PRETTY GIRL IN A DRESS, comes' walking toward him. As she
passes he BLOWS A LITTLE AIR OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH
and turns to watch her SKIRT FLY UP.
BRUCE
And he saw that it was good.
He spots a
mannequin in a store window display, wearing a
cool, casu
al outfit. He closes his eyes. When he opens
them, HE'S
WEARING THE COOL NEW OUTFIT and the mannequin is
dressed in
his clothes. He checks his reflection. . . better.
Bruce rounds the corner, sees the SAME GANG that beat him up,
hanging out in the alley.
BRUCE
B-e-a-utifull
48.
Bruce approaches the gang.
BRUCE
Hey guys, remember me?
The gang members turn to Bruce.
HOOD #1
Oh look, it's the hero.
HOOD #2
Hungry for another can of whoop-
ass?
HOOD #3
Your stereo sounds great in my car,
man.
He and a couple other gang members laugh and high-five.
BRUCE
Look, I don't want to fight you
guys. So as soon as you apologize,
I'll be on my way.
A beat, then the Hoods BURST OUT LAUGHING.
A few circle
behind, surrounding Bruce.
HOOD #1
Oh, yeah. I'll apologize... The
day a monkey climbs out of my butt.
BRUCE
What a coincidence. That's today.
The Hood gets a PAINED LOOK, starts gyrating around, then a
MONKEY comes climbing out the back of his baggy pants.
The Big Guy looks at Hood #1.
BIG GUY
Did that come out of your butt,
man?
Hood #1 faints from shock.
BRUCE
Now I'm going to have to teach the
rest of you guys a lesson.
49.
HOOD #2
Yeah, you and whose army?
BRUCE
Just me... and me...
ANOTHER BRUCE steps out from behind a stack of crates.
BRUCE
And me, and me, and me, me, me, me,
me and me and me.
As Bruce talks, DUPLICATE BRUCE'S begin popping out from
various spots, a doorway, hanging down from a fire escape, a
dumpster pops open, six Bruce's jump out.
BRUCE
PILE ON THE RABBIT1
T HE B RUGES CONV ERGE ON TH E GA NG --
Hood #2 is instantly tackled by THREE BRUGES --
ONE BRUCE kneels down behind a hood, ANOTHER BRUCE pushes him
down over his back. The two Bruce's high-five --
A Hood climbs a fire escape. ONE BRUCE gives a hand up to
ANOTHER BRUCE, who takes pursuit. ANOTHER BRUCE leans out of
a window SMASHES a potted plant over his head --
ON THE MONKEY - SCREECHING, ENJOYING THE EXCITEMENT
Our Bruce stands in the middle of the action, happily
watching the mayhem.
HOOD #2
Let's get out of here, manl
Hood #2 takes off running, the gang members follow.
BRUCE
Okay guys, Kum Ba Yal
The Bruce's jog over, leaping and diving into Bruce's body.
BRUCE
I'll take it from here.
Bruce takes a deep breath, OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE, RELEASING A
SWARM OF LOCUSTS --
50.
The gang streams out of the alley screaming, COVERED IN
LOCUSTS.
Bruce exits the alley, the monkey at his side.
He looks down
to the monkey.
BRUCE
Back home for you, little one.
The monkey takes off back into the alley, as we see HOOD #1
stumbling to his feet.
HOOD #1
NoI
NOOOOO1
He takes off running, the monkey in hot pursuit.
ON BRUCE
He belches and one last locust flies out.
He reacts to the
unpleasant aftertaste and walks off.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON - BRUCE
We widen to an UP ANGLE of him standing on the top of
Buffalo's tallest SKYSCRAPER. Clouds swirl behind him. He
looks out over the vast city lights, opens his arms and
proclaims to the world.
BRUCE
I AM THE LORD THY BRUCE ALMIGHTY.
MY WILL BE DONE I
Bruce poses in dramatic god-like form, lightning crashes
behind him. He is an awesome god.
Bruce opens the doors, steps onto the balcony. He surveys
the cloudy sky, reaches up with his hand and ERASES THE
CLOUDS, LIKE ON A CHALKBOARD.
Still not completely satisfied he reaches up toward the moon
and makes a LASSOING MOTION, THEN BEGINS TO PULL.
CUT TO:
OUTER SPACE - BEHIND THE MOON
Earth far off in the distance - And with a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE
the MOON starts MOVING CLOSER TO EARTH.
BACK TO SCENE
Bruce adds a finishing touch by adding several stars with
points of his finger.
Grace joins Bruce on the balcony and is taken aback by the
perfectly orchestrated sky.
GRACE
Wow, it really cleared up. I've
never seen the moon that big.
Bruce puts his arms around Grace from behind.
53.
BRUCE
We shouldn't waste it.
Bruce starts kissing her neck. Grace turns, .they kiss and a
METEOR SHOWER lights the sky behind them. The kiss ends.
BRUCE
Bedroom.
GRACE
Five minutes.
Bruce heads for his severely beat-up junker car whistling
"What if God were One of Us."
Bruce turns the corner into bumper to bumper traffic. No
problem, the traffic magically opens up for him, cars
instantly swerving right and left clearing a path for Bruce.
He waves as he passes.
BRUCE
And the last shall be first.
A POLICE DOG, HANK, performs some standard TAKE DOWNS by
"attacking" a "criminal" (trainer) on the run. PHIL, a
reporter from a rival station is wrapping up his story.
PHIL
I certainly wouldn't want to be a
fugitive on the run with Hank,
Buffalo's number one police dog, on
the job. This is Phil Sidleman
reporting from The Police Canine
Training center.

And cut it. Let's go, guys.
The crew start to wrap up.
ANGLE - BRUCE
Watching the action from the side, holding his own home video
camera. Phil spots him.
PHIL
Hey, channel seven, right? You're
the guy that went crazy.
BRUCE
Yeah, I had a bad day. But things
are lookin' up.
PHIL
What are you doin' here?
BRUCE
Just lookin' for a story.
PHIL
(waving the video tape)
Well, this pond's fished out.
Pretty standard stuff anyway.
58.
BRUCE
I don't know. My instinct tells me
there's something more.
PHIL
Well, go with that. It's served
you well in the past, right?
Phil and a couple of his crew laugh, as they load the last of
their equipment into the van and shut the doors.
TRAINER (O.S.)
Hey, Hank found something1
Phil turns back, Bruce and he exchange a glance.
Hank is DIGGING FURIOUSLY, making a BIG HOLE. The Policeman
jogs over, joins the trainer. They watch as TWO DRESS SHOES
ARE UNCOVERE D IN THE DI RT. Hank BARKS.

scramble around the van.
CUT TO:
ON A TV

DAN RATHER
The body of Jimmy Hoffa was
uncovered in a field today outside
of a canine training center in
Buffalo New York. Local Buffalo
freelance field reporter Bruce
Nolan was the first on the scene...
59.
We cut to the pre-taped story. Bruce stands with Hank and
his trainer before camera, the body being exhumed from the
ground behind him.
BRUCE
Since the disapearence of Teamster
president Jimmy Hoffa in the
nineteen sixties, his whereabouts
have remained one of this country's
great unsolved mysteries. That is
until just moments ago, when during
a routine training session, a
police dog named Hank sniffed his
way right into the history books.
As you can see behind us, the body
is being carefully exhumed and will
be transported to a hospital
facility where DNA testing will
confirm the identity. That, of
course, only a formality as in a
bizarre twist, the body was found
buried with a birth certificate and
complete set of dental records.
(rubs Hank's neck)
Sort of a two-in-one for Hank
today, as moments later, he busted
a local news camera crew with four
kilo's of marijuana.
We see footage of PHIL AND HIS NEWS CREW, being cuffed on the
ground, as large stacks of marijuana plants are being pulled
from the van.
PHIL
I've never seen it before, I swear I
As Bruce pulls up in front of the building the NO PARKING
SIGN flies back into the bushes and the RED CURB TRANSFORMS
TO GREEN as though being sloppily painted with invisible
brushes.
Bruce exits the car and smooths past the Homeless Sign Guy,
who sits in his usual spot. His sign reads:
"HEAVEN IS AT HAND.
LEGGO YOUR EGGO."
Bruce is bored off his ass, interviewing some BLUE HAIRED OLD
LADIES at the Mark Twain chili cook off.
BLUE HAIRED LADY
(talks so slow you want to
kill yourself)
My secret is I let the jalapeno's
marinade in a spicy sauce for over
24 hours before I--
We see Bruce's pained face, realizing what horrible news this
is, when he gets an idea and SCHWWWWWAAAAAAM!11 AN ASTEROID
CRASHES to earth behind them.
BRUCE
Hold that thought, Hazel!
(Bruce walks back toward
the explosion)
It seems some type of meteor or
asteroid has, by chance, hit the
earth right behind the Mark Twain
Chili Cook Off. . .
Bruce is free-falling in full sky diving uniform.
BRUCE
. . . So remember, it's sky diving
season at Old Pete's airfield.
(grabs the ripcord)
This is Bruce Nolan..
(gives it a tug, doesn't
budge)
My rip cord appears to be a bit
stuck.
Bruce yanks again harder, nothing, then again and the cord
rips free from the suit.
67.
BRUCE
This is a very unfortunate turn of
events. I'm heading toward the
earth at a very precarious speed...
The cameraman pops his shoot and we see Bruce continue to
stream toward the ground below. He falls into a wooded area.
A CAMERA ON THE GROUND picks up the coverage, runs through
the brush with other BYSTANDERS to find Bruce laying on top
of a BIG, HAIRY CREATURE.
BYSTANDERS (O.S.)
He's okay...What's that?...It's
Bigfoot!...Bigfoot broke his
fall!. . .
Bruce stands groggy, points to a dazed Bigfoot.
BRUCE
Ah ha!
You are real!
Bruce is doing a report just outside the Pandas' enclosure.
BRUCE
In the past, zoo officials have
been unable to get these Panda's to
mate, but that doesn't seem to be a
problem today.
REVEAL A MALE PANDA wholeheartedly humping another PANDA.
BRUCE
And the mood seems to be catching

QUICK CUTS OF DIFFERENT NEWSCASTERS ON TV

earth. Bruce Nolan is rapidly
becoming known as. . .
A BILLBOARD being put up with a big smiling Bruce with arms

A Mob of photographers flash photos like crazy, as Bruce

crumbles.
Bruce surrounded by Hazel and other chili cook off
contestants shouts up from the bottom of the crater hole:
70.
BRUCE & CHILI CONTESTANTS
(in unison)
And that's the way the cookie
crumbles!
He BURSTS out the kitchen exit into the alley. Unclasps his
ears, but no relief. The whispers are now loud voices. We
start to make out fragments of words "Please," "Help me,"
etc.
Overwhelmed and scared, he slides down the alley wall,
covering his face, then TOTAL SILENCE --
Bruce lowers his hands and finds himself SITTING ATOP A HIGH
MOUNTAIN PEAK.
GOD (O.S.)
Really something isn't it?
God sits down next to Bruce.
BRUCE
Is this heaven?
God laughs at this one.
GOD
It's Everest. You should try
flipping on the Discovery Channel
every now and then. Well, I guess
you can't now, being dead and all.
BRUCE
I'm dead?I
God laughs.
76.
GOD
No, I'm just messing with you.
BRUCE
Those voices...
GOD
They're prayers, Bruce. You keep
ignoring them and they're going to
build up on. you like that. You
didn't think being God was going to
be all fun and games did you?
BRUCE
Prayers? Those are prayers? Why
can't I understand them?
God forms a snowball in his hands as he talks.
GOD
You aren't listening, son. Let's
see, you've had my powers for over
a week now and how many people have
you helped?
BRUCE
Okay, so maybe I've righted a
couple of the wrongs in my own
life. I was going to get around to
others. I can do both. I can help
the world.
GOD
The world? That wasn't the world,
Bruce. That was just Buffalo,
between Commonwealth and 57th.
Didn't want to start you out with
more than you can handle. Now how
you doing otherwise? Personal life
in good shape?
BRUCE
Yeah. Everything is great.
A DOORWAY OPENS like a crack in space. Grace steps out, sees
Bruce.
GRACE
Bruce? What are you doing out
here?
With that, the terrain TRANSFORMS back into the alley where
Grace has been standing all along. She can not see .God.
77,
BRUCE
Oh, ah,
(to God)
She can't...
(God shakes his head, back
to Grace)
I just, ah, needed a little fresh
air.
Bruce fakes a couple big breaths.
GRACE
Bruce, what is going on? The
second I want to talk about us you
run out on me.
GOD
(to Bruce)
Everything's great, huh?
BRUCE
I wasn't running out on you...
GRACE
You know, I actually had the crazy
idea that you were going to ask me
to marry you tonight.
GOD
Now it's heating up.
BRUCE
(to God)
You are not helping.
(back to Grace)
...me at all here, Grace.
GOD
(sarcastic)
Nice recovery.
Bruce looks to God to shut up.
GRACE
Not helping you what?
BRUCE
(to Grace)
Look hun, I want to talk about
this. This just isn't a good time.
Okay?
78.
GRACE
When is it a good time? It's never
a good time.
GOD
She's got a point.
BRUCE
(to God)
Stay out of this.
Grace looks at him like he's nuts.
*
GRACE
Who are you talking to?!
Just then, the WHISPERS start in again.
Bruce reacts.
BRUCE
Oh, not now.
Bruce puts his hands to his ears.
Grace takes this as him
not wanting to listen to her.
GOD
You're going to have to answer
those things, y'know.
GRACE
Fin e. Yo u kn ow wh at? I 'm go in g t o
go home and if by some miracle it
*
suddenly becomes a 'good time', you
*
know where to find me.
*
(starts out, then)
*
And speaking of time, you're
*
running out of it.
*
Grace heads back into the restaurant. Bruce stands
completely frustrated.
BRUCE
(to God)
Thank you.
GOD
You want some friendly advice?
BRUCE
No.
God smiles.
79.
GOD
You wanted the job, Bruce.
I
*
suggest you get to it.
*
Close on a middle-aged woman driving a car in a parking lot.
MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
Please let. me find a space.
She drives right by Bruce who smiles. . .
*
BRUCE
*
Knock, and the door shall be
*
open. . .
*
Bruce makes a KNOCKING MOTION and...
*
ANGLE - HANDICAPPED SPACES
84.
All the signs fall off their post. The painted wheelchair
symbols on the pavement animate WHEELING THEMSELVES OFF THE
SPACES. She pulls into the now open spaces.
Bruec watches a stickball game in progress. One PRISONER
chases a batted ball to the prison wall revealing a HUGE HOLE
to freedom.
PRISONER
(looks heavenward)
Thank you, God.
Construction workers stand staring down in awe as woman after
woman on the sidewalk below, STOP, RAISE THEIR TOPS AND FLASH
THEM.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
Thank you, God.
Bruce walks along head high, FULL OF HIMSELF. He audibly
hears snippets of prayers, snapping off responses.
VARIOUS PEDESTRIANS
I've got to find a better
job...Come on light, turn...God, I
wish I were thinner...
BRUCE
Promotion with 15% raise...It's
green. . . Donuts are now healthy...
Bruce pulls up, Grace, her BODY BACK TO NORMAL, walks up and
hops in, happy.
GRACE
L ook! I'm back to no rmal. It was
the wildest thing, I was worried,
so I said a prayer and the next
thing I know, I was completely
healed. It was like a miracle.
BRUCE
(fakes happy)
That's great.
GRACE
So, you're taking me to lunch?
Th is i s ra re --
(catches herself)
But wonderful.
BRUCE
Oh, I've got something better than
lunch.
Bruce pulls out. They drive off.
GRACE (O.S.)
Oh, you'll never believe it.
Debbie won the lotteryI
BRUCE (O.S.)
Really?
87.
GRACE (O.S.)
But get this, there were like 433
thousand other winners, so it only
paid out 17 dollars. Can you
believe the odds of that?
Bruce leads her out of the car.
BRUCE
Keep 'em closed...
GRACE
(laughing)
What is this?
*
Bruce leads Grace through the gates.
*
BRUCE
Okay...open your eyes.
Grace does and sees A STAGGERING MANSION.
*
GRACE
*
Wow. This is a bit overwhelming.
*
BRUCE
*
I know, it's incredible. Come on
*
in, look.
*
Bruce follows Grace outside.
BRUCE
Grace, come on.
Grace stops, opens her purse, tosses the keys to her new car
in Bruce's chest.
GRACE
Here. I do n't w ant your car. I
don't want your things. . . I don't
want you.
BRUCE
Come on, don't say that. I was
just calling y ou--
GRACE
And you thought Susan's mouth was
the phone?
BRUCE
I didn't think you were coming-- I
mean, I . . . I screwed up, okay.
Let me make it up to you.
GRACE
How about a boat, Bruce?
BRUCE
If that's what you want.
96.
GRACE
Yeah, a big boat and oh, maybe two
bags of cash, you know, the ones
with the big cartoon dollar signs
on the front. Then I'll be happy.
Because I'm just hollow inside.
Debbie's been right. All this
time. I defended you, told her
there was good in you. Another
side to you. Well, I just saw that
other side and I don't want
anything to do with it.
Debbie pulls up, Grace storms off to the car. Bruce follows,
BRUCE
Grace, come on, don't do this.
GRACE
Go back to your little co-anchor.
Or is that ho-anchor?
(tearing)
I came back here to apologize. How
stupid am I?
Grace turns and heads to the car.
BRUCE
You're the one that didn't like the
new place!
Grace gets in, slams the door.
BRUCE
You can't walk out on me! I'm the
alpha, lady! I'm the Omega!
Debbie peels out.
BRUCE
(desperate last attempt)
I could make you stay!
Bruce is left alone in the middle of the street.
BRUCE
Fine! I don't need you! I have
everything I need. Did you hear
that?!
(yelling)
I have EVERYTHING!
97.
Bruce hides behind a hedge, watches Grace jog past.
ON GRACE
notices something
CARVED IN THE TREE it reads: "GRACE +
BRUCE". Carved in
the next tree, "A COUPLE FOR THE AGES".
Carved in the next
tree, "COME ON ALREADY, GIVE HIM ANOTHER
CHANCE". She does
a double take, continues on.
Grace is talking with one of the other teachers. The kids,
playing dodgeball in the background, laugh and scream louder
and louder. Grace turns and sees...
Bruce getting pelted by multiple balls.
BRUCE
Okay, surrender, surrender.
He walks over to Grace.
BRUCE
Hi.
99.
GRACE
Hi..
BRUCE
I, ah, have my first anchor
tonight.
GRACE
That's great. I hope it goes well
for you.
He's hit in the head by a ball.
Grace can't help but smiles
Bruce leaps at the opportunity.
BRUCE
I miss you.
(off her silence)
I just took the first step, shot
myself out on the ledge, awaiting
vulnerably your response.
GRACE
. . . I don't know what to say.
BRUCE
How about you love me and you'll
take me back.
GRACE
No, Bruce.
BRUCE
Come on, what about all the signs?
GRACE
What? How do you know about that?
Did you talk to Debbie?
BRUCE
(beat)
Would it help if I told you I acted
like an ass?
Martin is standing nearby.
MARTIN
Hey, you said ass.
BRUCE
It's okay as long as you mean a
donkey. I didn't add "hole." It's
only bad when you say "ass-ho--
100.
GRACE
Alright, inside, Martin.
(to the others)
Okay everyone, inside.
The kids race in. Grace starts to follow.
BRUCE
Grace, please. None of this seems
*
right without you.
*
(off her reaction)
*
Is that a glimmer of hope I see?
*
GRACE
I have to go...
*
She starts off. . .
BRUCE
Wait.
Bruce DRAMATICALLY RAISES A HAND TOWARD GRACE, like putting a
love spell on her.
BRUCE
Now how do you feel?
She looks at him, oddly.
GRACE
...Are you out of your mind? Have
you been drinking?
BRUCE
Drin kin g? Sur e. I'm dru nk wit h
POWER.
Bruce RAISES BOTH HANDS IN FULL HEXING FASHION...
BRUCE
...LOVE ME1!!
GRACE
(a beat)
You need help.
She heads back inside. Bruce throws his hands in the air,
frustrated.
Bruce heads for his car as he sees a two guys in PRISON SUITS
(from the prison yard) drive off with it.
101.
BRUCE
Hey11
That's my car!!
