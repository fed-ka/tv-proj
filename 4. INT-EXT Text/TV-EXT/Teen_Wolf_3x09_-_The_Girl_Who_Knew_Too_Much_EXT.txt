                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      Tires burning up the pavement, Scott races his motocross bike 
      to a stop in the school s parking lot. He yanks his helmet 
      off just as Stiles s Jeep soars in beside him.

                                  STILES
                    Where is she?

                                    ALLISON (O.S.)
                    Over here!

      They spot Allison coming out of the shadows with Lydia.

                                  SCOTT
                    What happened?

                                    ALLISON
                    I don t know. I just got here.

                                  STILES
                    Lydia?

                                  LYDIA
                    It s the same thing--same as the 
                    pool. I got into my car, heading 
                    somewhere totally different, then 
                    ended up here. And you told me to 
                    call when there s a dead body.

                                  STILES

                    Not yet.

                                  STILES
                    What do you mean not yet? You re 
                    supposed to call after you find the 
                    dead body. After.

                                  LYDIA
                    Oh, no. I m not doing that again. 
                    You find the dead body from now on.

                                  STILES
                    How are we supposed to find the 
                    dead body? You re the one who s 
                    always finding the dead body.

                                  SCOTT
                    Guys... I found the dead body.

      Scott looks past them to the BEACON HILLS HIGH SCHOOL SIGN 
      atop which Deputy Graeme lies. Garrote around her neck. Blood 
      streaming down the stone and brick.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF


      Peering around a corner, Stiles watches Stilinski confer with 
      DEPUTIES and PLAINCLOTHES OFFICERS. With a last note jotted 
      down, Stilinski gives the group a nod and then notices his 
      son watching. 

      Stiles tries to slip away, but Stilinski stops him before he 
      can get too far.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Hey. Back it up. I know what you re 
                    thinking. I know you ve got all 
                    these ideas about patterns and 
                    people dying in threes--

                                  STILES
                    Murdered, Dad. Sacrificed actually.

                    Whatever you want to call it. I 
                    still don t want you worrying.

                    I ve got half the state, including 
                    FBI, coming in on this. They re not 
                    getting away with killing one of 
                    our own.

                                  STILES
                    They killed Tara, Dad. She used to 
                    help me with my math homework when 
                    I had to wait at the station for 
                    you.

      THE BELL RINGS, both of them left awkwardly searching for 
      something to say. But all Stilinski can think of is--

                                  STILINSKI
                    Get to class, okay?

      With a nod, Stiles slips into the rush of students, hardly 
      seeming to notice Scott stepping in at his side.

                                  SCOTT
                    Why s it feel like something s 
                    changing? Like all this is just 
                    getting worse?

                                  STILES
                    You mean like time s running out.

      Scott gives a worried nod.

                                  SCOTT
                    We need to figure out who s doing 
                    this.

                                  STILES
                    Lydia said she saw a slashed up 
                    face. I don t know about you but I 
                    haven t met anyone lately with 
                    massive open wounds all over their 
                    face.

                                  SCOTT
                    Yeah, but I think this thing gets 
                    in your head. Like it can make you 
                    see whatever it wants you to see.TEEN WOLF EP#309"THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH"GREEN3/22/136.

                                  STILES
                    What if it s just another kind of 
                      shape-shifter?

                                  SCOTT
                    Then it could be anyone.

      Pausing at the door to the building, Stiles throws a last 
      glance back to find his father and the Deputies leaving.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    You okay?

                                  STILES
                    No, dude, I m not. And you re 
                    right. Time s running out.

      He steps in, leaving Scott at the door, shaken by his tone.


      Hurrying into the tunnel connecting the school grounds to the 
      athletic field, Jennifer slows as a SILHOUETTE appears out of 
      the shadows. She takes a cautious step back. But then--

      Derek steps into the light. With a relieved breath, Jennifer 
      rushes to him, kissing him.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Where the hell have you been? And 
                    don t say you just needed to be 
                    alone for a while because that s 
                    the single worst excuse ever.
                          (looking in his eyes)
                    Oh God, I m sorry. You really did 
                    need to be alone, didn t you?

                    I haven t felt safe. Partially 
                    because the evil twins are walking 
                    around school like nothing 
                    happened.

                    They re not going to hurt you.

      A strong breeze whips across the ground, swirling leaves into 
      the tunnel. Shivering, Jennifer pulls closer to Derek. But 
      THE BELL RINGS for the next class, interrupting them.

                                  JENNIFER
                    I swear to God, some days I want to 
                    take a sledgehammer to that bell.

                    Why don t you just come back with 
                    me?

                                  JENNIFER
                    I can t. I ve got three classes 
                    left and I put this recital 
                    together tonight. I organized it to 
                    honor the losses at school and--and 
                    it sounds really stupid now, 
                    doesn t it?

                                  DEREK
                    No. It sounds perfect.

                                  JENNIFER
                    What are you going to do? I mean 
                    where are you going to be?

                                  DEREK
                    Waiting for you.

      She nods and kisses him again, holding her lips to his for a 
      long moment. Finally, she pulls away and Derek watches her 
      hurry back to the school. As the wind hurtles through the 
      tunnel again, however, even he can t help but shiver.TEEN WOLF EP#309"THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH"GREEN3/22/1323.



      Allison s car pulls up to the open gate of a isolated POWER 
      STATION. She and Isaac spot Argent s SUV parked close to the 
      building.

      Scott looks over the walkway to the quad below.

      Wind whipping through the trees, students and teachers hurry 
      toward the recital hall, passing by--

      Jennifer Blake. Arms hugging herself in the cold, she looks 
      about. Nervous, frightened, and most of all... vulnerable.

      FADE IN:


      Argent s SUV races into the school lot. Doors flying open, 
      he, Allison and Isaac hurry out. But while Allison and Isaac 
      race toward the recital hall, Argent pauses.

      He looks up as a powerful gust of wind blasts about them, 
      shaking the trees and tearing leaves from branches. Unnerved, 
      he turns to follow them to the recital hall.


      Rushing out to the dimly lit school grounds, Scott and Stiles 
      search the shadows.

      Turning, Scott reveals his eyes GLOWING. He sees in WOLF 
      VISION, scouring the darkened corners of the school s quad.

                    Anything?

      Scott shakes his head. Stiles checks his phone again.

                    we do? Scott?

      Breathless, Scott looks about, unable to answer.


      The SOUND pierces the night, nearly sending Scott to his 
      knees.
