      KEEP ZOOMING DOWN A STAIRCASE, into the Wonderland Underground 
      Tunnels, which comprise the first floor of the whole park.

      And finally, we find LUCY VILLAR: 16, half-Latina, pragmatic, 
        quick-witted and acerbic. Like the techies we saw behind the 
      fence, Lucy is clad in black. She has an ear-piece and holds 
      an iPad. Currently, she s stressed and on the move.

      Everything here is happening FAST FAST FAST.

                                  LUCY
                    Where the hell is my Rocky?

      Lucy passes by PERFORMERS in various stages of undress: giant 
      rabbit rubber legs on SWEATY GUYS in tank tops; PRINCESSES of 
      different ethnicities scrambling to put on wigs. All of them 
      regard Lucy with familiarity   quick high-fives,  hey Lucy , 
      etc   but no one s seen Rocky.

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    I kinda need a giant talking raccoon 
                    wearing a Stetson to appear in the 
                    next six seconds.

                                  WILL (O.S.)
                    Lucy. I can do it.

      Lucy turns to see WILL ARMSTRONG (17, mixed race black and 
      white, masculine and tough), in the costume of a Rocky Raccoon 
      in a Hawaiian shirt. He holds the giant rubber head. 

                                  LUCY
                    You re coming off 45 minutes of love 
                    and shoves and you re in Hawaiian Fun 
                    Rocky gear. You re still dripping in 
                    kid juice  

                                  WILL
                       Kid juice  is phrase no one should 
                    ever say, and I can swap out the 
                    costume in three minutes   

                                    PATRICK
                      We don t have three minutes. 
                    They re at bows, and Cowboy Rocky s 
                    up next. Lucy, he s new, you gotta 
                    hold his hand, here.

      Will s dad   and their boss   stage manager PATRICK ARMSTRONG 
      (40, white, blue-collar, tough but kind) rounds a corner.                                                                                       3.


                                  WILL
                    Dad, she s in a bind, I know the 
                      choreography  

                                    PATRICK
                      Union regulations say you need 
                      forty-five minutes between sets. Like 
                    I need grief from them if you go out 
                    again right away. 

                                  LUCY
                    Costumes said Rocky checked in. But 
                    it s his first day, maybe he s lost  

                                    PATRICK
                      Behind me on the left. You see?

      Lucy sees: a guy we ll just call ARMANI SUIT for now (21, Wall 
      Street handsome, well-bred and well-mannered). He lingers off 
      to the side, inconspicuous but watching closely.

                                    PATRICK (CONT D)
                    New guy from upstairs. Here to 
                       familiarize himself. 

      Eye-contact between Lucy and Patrick: this is serious. Lucy 
      quickly rounds a corner while speaking into her ear-piece:

                                  LUCY
                    I need all eyes on Rocky Raccoon. I 
                    repeat, all eyes on Rocky Raccoon  

      And SMACK   she runs right into:

                                  ROCKY RACCOON
                      I m assuming that s me?

      The performer playing ROCKY RACCOON   Wonderland s iconic 
      flagship character   is in full rubber-suited, cowboy getup, 
      his voice muffled but audible through the giant raccoon head.

                                  LUCY
                    I don t know who you are, but you re 
                    an idiot.

                                  ROCKY RACCOON
                    This goes without saying. Look how 
                    I m dressed.

      Annoyed, Lucy grabs Rocky s arm, pushing him down the hallway 
      as performers part like the Red Sea. Channeling Robert Downey 
      Jr. in Iron Man, this Rocky talks quickly:                                                                                      4.


                                  ROCKY RACCOON (CONT D)
                    What s your name? I m Rocky, but you 
                    probably knew that part already.

                                  LUCY
                    I know the part about you being late 
                    and almost ruining everything.

                                  ROCKY RACCOON
                    True, but you didn t quite answer my 
                    question. 
                          (off her glare)
                    If you re glaring it s wasted on me. 
                    I can barely see through this head.

      They arrive at the steps leading to the area behind the fence.   
      As Lucy talks, she gives final adjustments to his costume.

                                  LUCY
                    Okay, to review: you enter in front 
                    of the stagecoach and do your dance 
                    with the cowboys. A tech in the crowd 
                      manipulates your mask s jaw and makes 
                    the words come out. Then you have 
                    love and shoves   hug a kid, pose for 
                      a picture, sign an autograph, send 
                    them off   while I run interference 
                    on the crowd. After twenty minutes I 
                    say  Rocky has to go back to the 
                    rodeo,  and I take you inside. 
                    Remember, to these kids, you are 
                    Rocky Raccoon, so no dream-crushing 
                    or illusion-shattering on my watch. 
                    If you re in distress, the signal is 
                    you take off your cowboy hat. Got it?

                                  ROCKY RACCOON
                    ... I sign autographs for cowboys?
                          (off her silence)
                    Are you glaring again?

                                  LUCY
                    Just get the hell out there.

      But guiding him up the stairs, she smells something:

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    Hold up, is that pot? Are you stoned?

                                  ROCKY RACCOON
                    I m getting a high-strung vibe from 
                    you, so there s really not an answer 
                    to that question you re gonna like.                                                                                      5.



      Stage Manager Patrick doesn t waste a breath as he calls out:

                                    PATRICK
                    Rocky tumble!                                                                                      6.


      Five GUYS in black   Will among them   run out to the exit... 
      Patrick glances at Armani Suit. Armani Suit watches and then 
      writes something down on his iPad, ominously.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      Lucy pushes open the door to a dressing room with Rocky s 
      iconic cartoon face on it and enters THE DRESSING ROOM, where 
       Rocky  is behind a changing curtain as Lucy barrels in.

                                  LUCY
                    You must already hate this gig 
                    something fierce or you wouldn t be 
                    trying to get yourself fired so fast.

                                  ROCKY RACCOON (BEHIND CURTAIN)
                    Hey, it gets hot under that costume.

                                  LUCY
                    You got high under that costume.

                                  ROCKY RACCOON
                    Like you ve never passed out in 
                    there.

                                  LUCY
                    I m not the performing type. Kinda 
                    like you re the  unable to handle his 
                    buzz without fainting  type.

                                  ROCKY RACCOON (BEHIND CURTAIN)
                    You gonna narc on me?

                                  LUCY
                    It smells like Amanda Bynes s tour 
                    bus in here so you basically narced  

      But as she talks,  Rocky  steps from behind the curtain... And 
      for the first time, we see IAN CHANDLER. He is 16, currently 
      shirtless, dripping with sweat, and possibly the best-looking 
      male specimen in the known world. 

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    ... Narced... yourself.

      Lucy s words are mush. But doing anything besides taking in 
      the utter hotness of Ian is a fool s errand   and he knows it. 

                                  IAN
                    Sorry, what were you saying? 


                                    END OF TEASER                                                                                      8.


                                        ACT ONE


      Right back to that moment where Lucy is taking in Ian.

                                  IAN
                    If you were looking for more 
                      adjectives to go with  can t handle 
                    his pot, let s start with 
                       irresponsible,   caddish   

      Lucy may be flustered, but she s not one to change her tune at 
      the sight of a pretty face. (Not for very long, anyway.)

                                  LUCY
                         Unjustifiably self-satisfied,  
                     smug,  and of course,  douchey. 

                                  IAN
                    Oh, those are good!

      Patrick walks in. He tosses Ian a robe.

                                    PATRICK
                    Hey Magic Mike, put on some clothes.

      Ian wraps the robe around himself, a little slower than 
      necessary. Then Patrick sniffs the air. Smells the marijuana.

                                    PATRICK (CONT D)
                    What s that?

      Patrick looks at Ian   who for the first time, displays a hint 
      of nervousness. Then Patrick turns to Lucy. She shrugs. She 
      may be pissed, but she s not a narc.

                                    PATRICK (CONT D)
                    Tumble on your first day, huh?

                                  IAN
                    I was curious to see how the rescue 
                    protocols worked. Sadly, turns out I 
                    was unconscious by that time.

                                    PATRICK
                    Ha. I was a fur for ten years. You 
                    gotta make friends with the Gatorade.

      Patrick and Ian CHUCKLE. Then Patrick studies Ian s face:

                                    PATRICK (CONT D)
                    But maybe you d be better as a 
                     face.  Maybe a Prince Valor...                                                                                      9.


                                  LUCY
                    Patrick, that s a promotion. 

                                    PATRICK
                    He s the right height. Right 
                      complexion. We re short on Valors.
                          (to Ian)
                    And it s less costume, so you 
                    wouldn t be as hot. Heat is why you 
                      collapsed, right?

                                  IAN
                    ... Yeah. It was the heat.

                                    PATRICK
                    All right. We ll get you learning the 
                    part stat. For now, hydrate.

      Patrick heads out into the BACKSTAGE TUNNELS, and Lucy 
      follows. Once out of Ian s earshot, she says:

                                  LUCY
                    We have guys who ve been waiting 
                    years to play Valor. This ass-hat 
                    screwed up right out of the gate, so 
                    why would you  

                                    PATRICK
                      Lucy. I love you like a daughter, 
                    but you gotta drop it and let me do 
                    my damn job.

      Patrick walks away, leaving Lucy alone. She peeks into the 
      dressing room and sees Ian getting ready. He heard everything:

                                  IAN
                    ... Maybe add  ass-hat  to the list?

      Annoyed, she stomps off. He watches her go and smiles.


      As Lucy approaches the front door, she hears the sound of a 
      woman s FLIRTATIOUS LAUGHTER coming from inside. She sighs   
      her expression reading  here we go again    before entering:

      THE APARTMENT

      A modest home Lucy shares with her mother Gloria   the 
      princess from the opening sequence. Photos of the two of them 
      adorn the walls, along with photos of Gloria playing 
      princesses in various Wonderland shows through the years.

      Gloria entertains Italian CHEF ANTONIO MICARELLI (30, drunk, 
        stud-muffin) who barely speaks English. Gloria and Antonio 
      canoodle on the couch, but when Lucy walks in, Antonio moves 
      his arm off like a teenager caught in the act.

                                  GLORIA
                    Honey, this is Antonio. He s a chef 
                    in the World Village. Antonio, this 
                    ray of sunshine is my daughter, Lucy.

                                  CHEF ANTONIO
                          (heavy Italian accent)
                    Your... Daughter?

                                  LUCY
                    He s doing the math right now in 
                    Italian, isn t he?

                                  CHEF ANTONIO
                    It is late... I must go.                                                                                     13.


      Unsure of what to do around Lucy, he gives her an awkward 
      handshake. Gloria looks somewhere between disappointed and 
      amused as he takes off in record time.

      A slightly uncomfortable moment between mother and daughter 
      lingers in the air. So Lucy asks with mock seriousness:

                                  LUCY
                    Mom... Is Chef Antonio my real dad?

      Gloria throws a couch pillow at her head. Lucy throws it back 
      and walks to the kitchen portion of the main room.

                    Chef Antonio could be the one. You 
                    don t know.

                    I do, though. What s for dinner?

                    Whatcha making?

      Lucy opens the fridge. Practically empty.

                                  LUCY
                      Apparently, peanut butter. Crap, I 
                    should ve gone to the grocery store

                    tonight,  cause tomorrow the park is

      Gloria begins to raise the roof. Lucy sighs.

                                  LUCY
                    We talked about you raising the roof.

                    Today. Apparently someone dropped out

      Gloria pulls Lucy into a big embrace. She starts tearing up. 
      Remember, Gloria is an actress; she gets emotional.

                    leave Wonderland I m going to have to 
                    watch Gilmore Girls by myself. Oh my 
                    baby, you re gonna blow  em away...


      Lucy sits opposite Red Cross supervisor DENISE (35, serious-
      minded, polar opposite of Gloria). She is not  blowing them 
      away.  In fact, she may just be  blowing it :

                                  LUCY
                      And I think, um... All people 
                    affected by disaster across the 
                    country and around the world should 
                    receive care, shelter and hope.

                                  DENISE
                    ... That s our mission statement. 
                    Word for word. It s on our website. 

                                  LUCY
                          ( oh fuck me )
                    ... I knew it sounded familiar.

                                  DENISE
                    Well! Thanks for coming in.                                                                                    15.


      Denise smiles a professional  you re not going to get this  
      smile, and Lucy tries to keep it together as she heads to the 
      door. But just before she s out, she turns to Denise:

                                  LUCY
                    I totally bombed that, didn t I?

      Denise holds up Lucy s application file.

                                  DENISE
                    You have stellar grades. Your essays 
                    are immaculately-researched. But the 
                    reason we didn t select you before   
                    and what I was hoping to see today   
                    is why you want to work here.

      Lucy takes a deep breath. This isn t easy for her.

                                  LUCY
                    I ve lived in Wonderland my whole 
                    life. All around all you hear is 
                     dreams come true  and stuff, but I 
                    don t necessarily believe that.

      Denise is hard to read, but Lucy definitely has her attention:

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    I do believe I ve got about $14 in 
                    savings, and that affirmative action 
                    and good SAT scores won t be enough 
                    to get a full-ride to college. 

                                  DENISE
                    So this program is just about padding 
                    your college resume?

                                  LUCY
                    No... See, the world s a big place 
                    and I haven t seen it. You work in 
                      Wonderland too long, you can start 
                    thinking life will turn into a fairy 
                    tale. Like you re a character at the 
                    beginning of an animated movie 
                    waiting for a magical adventure to 
                    start. You get delusional. I ve seen 
                    it happen to my moth   to other 
                    people. The Red Cross is about 
                      reality... And I want to be part of 
                    something real.

      Denise smiles; that s what she wanted to hear.                                                                                    16.


                                  DENISE
                    ... I can t promise anything, but how 
                    about you come back for a final 
                    interview with my supervisor this 
                    week, and then we ll see what s what?


      Lucy, Ian, and Harper ride up the executive elevator. Lucy is 
      nervous, Harper drunk and wobbly, while Ian is on his phone 
      turned away from them. As he talks, Lucy and Harper WHISPER:

                                  LUCY
                    What s going on with you and Will? 

                                  HARPER
                    Ugh, Will s acting like one of those 
                      self-righteous poor people in Les 
                      Miserables. Besides... Look who we re 
                    in an elevator with...

      They glance at Ian, still on the phone. More WHISPERS:

                                  HARPER (CONT D)
                    Wait   am I box-blocking you?

                                  LUCY
                    ... Hardly. He s not my type.

                                  HARPER
                    No, he s not.

      The elevator doors open as Ian gets off the phone. 

                                  IAN
                    Sorry about that. I think my dad has 
                    a bottle of the good stuff up here...

      Ian leads them to:                                                                                    22.


      THE PRESIDENT S PENTHOUSE OFFICE

      Everything you d expect to find in the office of a Fortune 500 
      CEO. Solid oak furniture with original Rocky Raccoon animation 
      cells worth more than Gloria or her ilk make in a year. 

      Harper looks around and SQUEALS IN DELIGHT at the opulence. 
      Ian grabs a bottle of Krug Brut Vintage from his dad s bar. He 
      says to Lucy:

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    Balcony s got a ridiculous view.

      Lucy walks out onto the adjacent BALCONY over-looking the 
      whole park from floors up. You can see all the way from the 
      Brick into Dazzle. But more pressingly, from up here, the park 
      looks beautiful. Lucy whispers:

                                  LUCY
                    ... I ve never seen it from up here. 

                                  IAN
                    Kind of amazing, right?

      Lucy nods, then looks at him. His hand starts to creep towards 
      hers. Right now, he doesn t look so smug. In fact, he looks 
      downright dashing. Above the park, literal fireworks go off. 
      Time almost seems to stop... But then: 

                                  HARPER
                    Oh my God, you can totally see my 
                    house in Dazzle! Look!

      Harper has loudly joined them. Ian s hand moves away.

                                  HARPER (CONT D)
                    You are so bad. When were you going 
                    to tell everyone who you were?

      Lucy eyes her friend: Harper s tone is quite flirtatious...

                                  IAN
                    A Libra?

      Harper laughs far too loudly at the joke. 

                                  LUCY
                    This was nice and veritgo-inducing, 
                    but Harp... We should go. 

                                  IAN
                    I promise wherever you re going is 
                    less fun than this balcony.                                                                                    23.


                                  HARPER
                    Yeah, Fun Police, we just got here!

                                  LUCY
                            (deliberate)
                    Will will wonder where we are.

                                  HARPER
                    Oh, will Will?

      Drunk, Harper laughs at her own joke. 

                                  LUCY
                    Okay, I m gonna take Harper home 
                    while her embarrassing splatter to 
                    the ground is only figurative. 

      As Lucy starts to lead Harper away, Harper calls back.

                                  HARPER
                    Byeeee Ian...

      Lucy and Harper arrive at the elevator doors. As they open, 
      Lucy and Ian make eye contact as Harper whispers loudly:

                                  HARPER (CONT D)
                    Do you think he likes me?

      The doors close as Lucy and Ian exchange a little smile.


      Lucy wears her greeter uniform while making breakfast. She s 
      in a good mood. Gloria emerges from her bedroom.

      Lucy looks like she wants to apologize, but doesn t have the 
      chance as a truly hurt Gloria quickly retreats to her bedroom. 


      Lunch at a grimy Bricker Bar, located just outside Wonderland. 
      Something of a speakeasy, it has clearly unlicensed drawings 
      of Rocky and Roxy Raccoon (Rocky s equally iconic 
       girlfriend,  obviously) in revealing outfits, smoking, 
      drinking, playing pool, etc. An inside joke to park employees, 
      and an obvious subversion of Wonderland s squeaky clean image.                                                                                    25.

                    Where d you and Harper run off to 
                    last night?

      Lucy considers how fully to answer the question...

                                  LUCY
                    ... She just needed to cool off. I 
                    hear you guys had like act three of 
                      Relationship Drama Theater.

      Before Will can respond, the bar goes quiet. All eyes turn to 
      the entrance: Ian and Theodore Chandler just walked in. 

      Silence lingers. Theodore walks over to a picture of scantily-
      clad Roxy Raccoon. He addresses a blue-collar BARTENDER:

                                  THEODORE
                    Do you have license for these 
                      decorations?

                                  BARTENDER
                    Uh... We re not technically in the 
                    park. There s no sign on the door, we 
                    never get tourist business  

                                  THEODORE
                      So you don t have a license?
                          (off Bartender s silence)
                    Well... Then all I can do is buy 
                    everyone in here a round.

      Theodore LAUGHS; he was joking. The Bartender SIGHS, relieved. 
      Someone gives Theodore a backslap. As drinks are poured, Ian 
      approaches Lucy and Will, and extends his hand to Will.

                                  IAN
                    I m Ian.

                                  WILL
                          (doesn t take it)
                    I know who you are.

                                  LUCY
                    This is Will.

                                  IAN
                    Of  Harper and Will?  Plot thickens.

                                  WILL
                    What the hell s that mean?                                                                                    26.


                                  IAN
                    Means whatever you want it to, man.

                                  WILL
                          (standing up)
                    Do we have a problem?

                                  IAN
                    Ask my shrink, I got loads of them.

                                  LUCY
                          (to Will)
                    Take the testosterone down a notch  

      Having overheard their conversation and sensing the tension 
      between Will and Ian, Theodore approaches his younger brother:

                                  THEODORE
                      Ian. You don t enter a man s home 
                    and drop a deuce on his carpet. 
                          (to Will)
                    Will Armstrong   character 
                      department, right? You play Rocky, 
                    Slinks, and Professor Prune. Can I 
                    buy you a beer? 

                                  WILL
                    I m underage.

                                  THEODORE
                    Who s gonna tell?

      Will eyes Theodore with suspicion. Then he gives a slight nod.


      Lucy walks down the tunnels finishing up a greeter shift, 
      practicing her Red Cross interview under her breath as she 
      looks over some notes.

                                  LUCY
                     There s ways to help beyond giving 
                    money or blood. I mean, obviously I 
                    have so much money and even more 
                    blood...  Yeah, that ll slay  em...

      She passes some PERFORMERS who laugh. She doesn t stop moving.

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                          (to the performers)
                    Just talking to myself like a crazy 
                    person, carry on.
                          (practicing again)
                     Last year you helped 155 million 
                    people in 70 countries                                                                                       29.


      But Lucy trails off when she sees Patrick bounding around a 
      corner, nervous as hell.

                                    PATRICK
                    We got a problem. Your mom s on in 
                    ten and nobody can find her. Phone s 
                    off. What the hell s going on?

      But before Lucy can answer, Theodore rounds another corner 
      holding a chart. Lucy lingers behind, torn about what to do...

                                  THEODORE
                    Gloria Villar s scheduled to perform 
                    as Princess Sophia, yes?

                                    PATRICK
                      Something s gotta be up. She s never 
                    missed a show in fifteen years.

                                  THEODORE
                    Fifteen years is a long time for a 
                    grown woman to play a teen princess. 

                                    PATRICK
                      Wonderland is Gloria s life. 

      Lucy looks at her notes. Then at her watch. Clock s ticking...

                                  THEODORE
                      I appreciate your loyalty, but if 
                    I ve been observing for two days and 
                    she s missed one of them, we might 
                    need to reconsider our personnel  

                                  LUCY
                      My mom s not coming.

      All eyes turn to Lucy. With a straight face she says:

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    She s sick. She asked me to fill in. 
                    I just finished my last greeter shift 
                    or I would ve been here earlier.

      Will and Patrick exchange a look: obviously Lucy s story is 
      bullshit, but she smiles in the face of Theodore s gaze.

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    ... Maybe I should get into costume?


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    30.


                                      ACT THREE


      Lucy quickly walks towards the dressing room, next to Will (in 
      half Rocky costume) who s gotten wind of her stunt:

                                  WILL
                    You have that interview in an hour  

                                  LUCY
                      Maybe I can still make it. My mom 
                    can t lose this job. 
                          (quick pause)
                    And you need to go easy on Harper. 
                    She s doing her best.

      He takes her arm. For a second, they both stop:

                                  WILL
                    Maybe   Maybe Harper s not who I m 
                    supposed to be with...

      A charged moment between them. Lucy s torn.

                                  LUCY
                    ... Yes, she is. Fix it.

      Lucy enters a dressing room, beginning a short SEQUENCE.

        IN A DRESSING ROOM, Lucy struggles to fit into Gloria s 
      Princess costume with the help of some other GREETERS and 
      PERFORMERS. It doesn t fit quite right; adjustments are made. 

        IN THE TUNNELS, Lucy races down the halls with towards the 
      exit to outside her own GREETER. 

        AT THE STAIRCASE, Lucy practices the choreography. She fucks 
      it up. She grimaces, when Patrick approaches:

                                    PATRICK
                    You know the part?

                                  LUCY
                    Seen my mom do it a million times.

                                    PATRICK
                    That better be enough. You re on.

      She heads to the area OUTSIDE BEHIND THE FENCE, ready to meet 
      her  Prince Valor ... And holy shit, it s Ian.

                                  IAN
                    Even you re a princess deep down.                                                                                    31.


      Lucy fights to fend off a panic attack as she speaks rapidly:

                                  LUCY
                    I m not a performer and I ve never 
                    done this and your brother can t fire 
                    you but he can sure as hell can fire 
                    me and my mom. God, last time you 
                    performed you were high and fainted. 
                    You probably don t even know the 
                      choreography  

                                  IAN
                          (no bullshit, reassuring)
                      I know it all. And I got you.

      From outside the fence, FAIRY TALE plays as a NARRATOR speaks:

                                  NARRATOR (O.S.)
                    Once upon a time there lived a 
                    beautiful girl named Sophia  

      The fence doors swing open and Lucy walks out into:

      WONDERLAND THEME PARK. She s been here a million times, but 
      she s never had so many eyes on her. Young, hopeful eyes, 
      waiting to be whisked away to someplace magical.

                                  NARRATOR (CONT D)
                      In the kingdom of Prince Valor. 
                     Edward,  to his friends. 

      Now Ian walks out onto the street, perfectly in character. He 
      and Lucy are on different sides of the  stage. 

                                  NARRATOR (CONT D)
                    Prince Valor lived in a magnificent 
                    castle. Sophia scrubbed the floors of 
                    her wicked step-mother s inn. Prince 
                    Valor and Sophia had never met...

      Lucy begins to  scrub the ground  while Ian gazes out.

                                  NARRATOR (CONT D)
                    ... But sometimes, late at night, 
                    they dreamt of each other.

      Ian sings his part of a romantic duet. And he s perfect.

                                  IAN
                    When will I find you / I know you re 
                    out there / When will I find you / 
                    You re waiting for me somewhere.                                                                                    32.


      Now it s Lucy s turn. She steps forward, tripping on her dress 
        but Ian catches her. For a moment they lock eyes. He smiles 
      at her:  You got this.  And she does:

                                  LUCY
                    When will I find you / Come take me 
                    away / When will I find you / Oh my 
                    prince, please say today.

      She s recovered. They smile and keep SINGING.


      Still in costume, Lucy tears down the tunnels towards the 
      exit. Also in costume, Ian follows her.

                                  IAN
                    Where are you going?

                                  LUCY
                    I m ten minutes late, but maybe 
                    they ll still be there  

                                  IAN
                      Are you running over in costume?

                                  LUCY
                    You have a better idea?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      I/E. IAN S PORSCHE - DAY

      Still in his prince costume, Ian s car tears down the streets 
      of Dazzle. In the back seat, Lucy changes from her princess 
      outfit into her civvies.

                                  LUCY
                    Don t peek!

      Ian smiles to himself. He peeks.
