The eye belongs to a 27 year old Formula 1 RACING DRIVER
wearing a fireproof balaclava...
Highly intelligent, he also happens to be World Champion. His
name is painted on the side of his Ferrari. NIKI LAUDA.
NIKI (V/O)
My grandfather always said history is
cruel and reductive and no matter how
long we live, or how much we achieve -
we are remembered for very little. So
make sure it's the right things.
NIKI stares up at the clouds. His eyelids flicker. Thinking.
Agonizing. Wrestling with an all important decision...
Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? Should he be
using slicks or wets?
5
6
Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the
crazy, panicked situation as all the DRIVERS come into the
pits to change to dry tyres.
It's chaos. A traffic jam of Formula 1 cars...
The Ferrari team frantically work. Changing NIKI's tyres. Four
men with air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks. The same
Italian MECHANIC appears, `plugs in' his headset to the car..
MECHANIC
Hair visto? Ti aveto detto di usare le
slicks!
(See? I told you to go on
slicks!!)
NIKI
Bullshit. Where's Hunt?
MECHANIC
There!
NIKI looks up to see the name JAMES HUNT written on the black
helmet roar out of the pits ahead, with new tyres on...
NIKI
C'mon...!!
NIKI screams at the MECHANICS, who are struggling. The airguns
make a high-pitched noise...something's not right.
NIKI
What's GOING ON???
"Thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac, engines scream, and
NIKI exit the pits in pursuit of HUNT. But the delay has cost
him dear...

NIKI gives it everything he's got. Tearing through the gears,
trying to catch JAMES HUNT, breaking as late as he can, engine
screaming.

He flies over the take-off hump between Pflanzgarten and
Swallowtail - passes one car after another. Into 13th place
now. Pulling off outrageous manoeuvres.
NIKI's P.O.V: the world flies past in a blur. The steering
wheel shakes. The car is right on the edge. Cannot be driven
any harder.
NIKI approaches the Streckenteil Adenauer-Brucke section of
the course...turns left at the Bergwerk corner. Crazy speed.
And tight. Too tight. A mistake...
"Thump", his wheels come into contact with the kerb on the
inside. NIKI tries to counter-steer, but is travelling at 155
mph. The car jerks horribly to the right..
"Crunch", hits the embankment, then "Bang", hits the barrier,
and is thrown across the track..
Fire breaks out in the engine. NIKI's eyes widen in horror,
with another car bearing down upon him...
NIKI
No...!
The oncoming car crashes head-on into our car, "Crash", a
sickening, terrifying impact.
The car explodes. Seventy litres of burning high-octane
gasoline, with NIKI strapped inside, unable to undo his
seatbelt. Locked in a blast furnace.
NIKI screams as the flames engulf him. 800 degrees
temperature. Trapped inside his car.
Burning smoke fills his helmet, scarring his lungs...
Pandemonium: commentary in different languages as panicked TV
commentators helplessly describe what's happening..
NIKI's POV: he can just make out the barely recognizable
figures of the other DRIVERS rushing towards NIKI..
Their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully
to undo NIKI's seatbelt..
Fire extinguishers blast at the car. Dry powder extinguishers.
Covering NIKI's helmet. Blurring his vision, as he cries out
in agony, inhaling the powder..
Screaming voices. Panicked reactions. On the side of the car,
the painted name `Niki Lauda' blisters and melts.

Then sound fades. As NIKI blacks out - losing consciousness.
FADE TO BLACK:
Over this: the sound of a ringing phone...

We're in a busy hospital A&E; unit. Noise. Crowds. A regular
Saturday late afternoon. The phone continues to ring..
Finally, an attractive station NURSE in her 20's, run-off-her-
feet, breathlessly picks up the phone.
NURSE
Emergency...
She covers her ears, straining to hear, listening to what is
being said. Then her expression changes...
NURSE
Okay...standing by!
The NURSE hangs up...then calls out to her NURSE and DOCTOR
colleagues...
NURSE
That was the race-track..! There's
been an accident..! A driver's been
injured and is on his way in..!
Instantly the atmosphere changes. A hive of activity as
DOCTORS and NURSES prepare themselves for a major trauma...
All PATIENTS with minor injuries are cleared out of the way.
The NURSE rings upstairs to the operating theatres and
consultant surgeons, telling them to stand by...
CAPTION: "EIGHTY-EIGHT RACES EARLIER"
Swing doors open, and a pair of shoeless, BARE FEET walks
through and into the accident and emergency unit.
Camera tilts up a pair of long legs in white racing
overalls...to reveal a tall, good-looking driver, JAMES HUNT,
(mid 20's), tanned, athletic, surfer long blonde hair...
A man about whom a word comes to mind one would rarely use to
describe an Englishman. SEXY.
Blood trickles from his nose, there is bruising to his lip and
the formation (already) of a nasty black eye, but make no
mistake. He rocks. Drop-dead gorgeous..

JAMES
I think the racetrack telephoned ahead
that I was coming? Hunt? James Hunt..?
JAMES notices all the NURSES staring..
JAMES
What's the matter? No one seen a spot
of blood before?
NURSE
Are you all right?
JAMES
Absolutely fine.
10

The attractive NURSE is examining JAMES, opening his overalls,
checking for wounds, cuts and bruises...
NURSE
We all thought you'd been in an
accident.
JAMES
I have. If you call a friendly
disagreement with another driver an
accident.
NURSE
What did you disagree about?
JAMES
None of your business. Ouch.
NURSE
Sorry.
JAMES
His wife.
NURSE
That's going to need a couple of
stitches. It's a nasty cut.
JAMES
It was a nasty blow. Done with a
bloody spanner.
NURSE
Why? What did you do?

JAMES
Nothing! Only what she begged me to
do.
The NURSE notices bruising on JAMES's chest...
NURSE
Which was..?
She examines him, testing his ribs for fractures, his chest..
JAMES looks up. Their eyes meet..
JAMES
Be happy to show you if you like.

`Crash', the door flies open as JAMES and the NURSE stumble
through, mid-embrace, tearing at one another's clothes...
The apartment is basic. Cramped. Messy. Like that of a poor
student. Ashtrays filled with half-smoked joints. Empty beer
cans. A toaster. A kettle. A stereo. A cage containing two
budgerigars.
A mattress on the floor.
Newspapers with headlines about the Dockers Strike, England's
crumbling economy, Rolls Royce being bailed out by the
government - subtle reminders of Britain in transition,
leaving behind its strong, imperial past.
JAMES and the NURSE stand against the wall, still half-
dressed, but already passionately making love...
JAMES (V/O)
I have a theory why women like racing
drivers. It's not because they respect
what we do...driving round and round
in circles. Mostly they think that's
pathetic. And they're probably right..
(a beat)
It's our closeness to death.
JAMES and the NURSE continue noisily, tirelessly making love
in the shower...
JAMES (V/O)
The closer you are to death, the more
alive you FEEL...the more alive you
ARE. And they can see that in you.
FEEL that in you. The way you live.
Willing to risk everything.

JAMES (V/O) (contd)
With no thought for tomorrow...as if
each day is your last. It's a
wonderful way to live...and the ONLY
way to drive. The only way to get that
tenth of a second on everyone else...
The lovemaking becomes more intense...
JAMES (V/O)
To dare to be one step bolder...one
step faster...
JAMES is covered in perspiration, out on the edge...
JAMES (V/O)
Sure one step closer to death...
JAMES and the NURSE, both screaming as they approach orgasm...
JAMES (V/O)
But one step closer to victory, too...
JAMES and the NURSE both climax together...and collapse on the
bed. Exhausted.

21
NIKI is in front of a mirror, and dresses smartly in a jacket,
and open necked shirt, evidently a little nervous...
NIKI (V/O)
So when they heard I wanted to race
cars for a living, they had a few
things to say...
22
22
A large, forbidding dining room. NIKI's FATHER and terrifying
GRANDFATHER, are eating supper. GRANDFATHER shakes his head,
clearly disapproves and barks in German...(we see subtitles)
GRANDFATHER
Never! Racing is for playboys and
dilettantes. Frivolous amateurs with
nothing in their heads. The name
`Lauda' appears on the front pages,
with politicians and economists, not
on the back pages with...
(gestures in contempt)
...footballers and skiers. If you want
my money, you do as I say and follow
me into my business..
NIKI stares at his GRANDFATHER..
NIKI (V/O)
It's in moments like this that you
discover who you really are..
...and in a move that he knows will rupture the family for
ever, NIKI gets to his feet..
NIKI
Fine. Keep your money. Don't invest in
me. But when I'm World Champion, and I
have the trophy, and my name is not
just on the back pages, but on the
front too, you will regret it.
NIKI walks out, the old man's insults ringing in his ears...
GRANDFATHER
You dare sit at my table and lecture
me on what I will or won't regret? Get
out! Impertinent wretch! Consider
yourself disowned!
17
23

NIKI is in a meeting with visibly concerned BANKERS and
LAWYERS. They speak in German...
BANKER
Another loan? Herr Lauda, you still
haven't repaid the other...
BANKER 2
Three..
BANKER
Totalling millions of Schillings. Plus
your Grandfather called to inform us
he will no longer be offering
security.
NIKI
I know. There is no room for failure.
I understand that.
NIKI (V/O)
But I was still a Lauda...
24
24
NIKI is driving his car. Beside him, is the attache case on
his lap. His car passes under a motorway sign reading
"Flughafen". (Airport)...
NIKI (V/O)
...which meant I was still a
businessman above everything else.
25
26
NIKI sits with LOUIS STANLEY in an airport cafe.
Contracts are open on the table. NIKI is signing. LOUIS
STANLEY is counter-signing...

STANLEY
In return for your money you get a
car, mechanics and a place on the
team. Plus fifty per cent of starting
fees and bonuses for podium finishes.
NIKI
Who's the number one driver?
STANLEY
Clay Regazzoni and you will defer to
him at all times.
NIKI takes out his cheque book and pen. He looks up...
NIKI
Why would I defer to him if I am
paying his wages?
NIKI writes the cheque. STANLEY's smile fades..
STANLEY
Because he's a proven winner at the
highest level, a good guy, and someone
who quite frankly, could teach you a
thing or two.
NIKI ignores this, continues scrutinizing the contract...
NIKI
OK. There is one clause missing.
STANLEY
The one about mechanics' exclusivity?
Sorry. We have a cardinal rule at BRM.
All information is shared between ALL
our drivers..
NIKI
And I made it perfectly clear that my
mechanics work for me. No one else.
This is something I cannot sign.
NIKI takes back the cheque. STANLEY stares...
STANLEY
All right. I'll have the lawyers amend
it.
NIKI
While you're at it you can tell them
to amend the clause for podium
finishes. Podium is first THREE
places, not just wins.

NIKI puts the cheque in his attache case. Snaps it shut,
taking it with him..
NIKI
You'll get the money on signature, as
agreed. See you at winter testing.
NIKI gets to his feet, and leaves. STANLEY watches the attache
case disappear.
STANLEY
If that little git drives half as well
as he negotiates, we're going to be
fine.

An awards ceremony is in progress. The room is thick with
cigar and cigarette smoke. A presenter on stage, wearing black
tie...
PRESENTER
I'm delighted to say the winner of the
British Guild of Motoring Writers
award for the `Most Promising Driver
of the Year' is James Hunt...
A loud, boisterous cheer goes up at the Hesketh Racing table.
JAMES turns to a (new/different) girlfriend beside him, gives
her a lingering kiss on the lips, then gets to his feet,
shakes hands with HESKETH, and BUBBLES and skips up to the
podium...
JAMES
Thank you. My parents always wanted me
to be a doctor, or stockbroker, and
gave me a first class education...but
to no avail. My brothers are the
success stories. I get bored easily. I
have a hot head, an inability to
tolerate discipline. I fall out with
people left and right. I'm quick to
settle matters with my fists. The only
creatures I've ever loved and treated
well, are budgerigars. In any normal
area of life, I'd be...or AM...a total
liability. All I've got going for me
is I'm quick in a car.

A good-looking woman calls out..
WOMAN
That's not all!
Laughter.
JAMES
So thank you for acknowledging that.
And giving me this...
(indicating trophy)
I'm going to give it to my Dad, and
tell him to put it on the mantle-piece
and imagine it's a first class degree
in medicine.
29

Afterwards: everyone is celebrating. Thanks to JAMES, every
pretty woman in the club is around. The trophy is perched
beside bottles of champagne...
HESKETH
Well done, Superstar. One more season
in F2 then I'll move you up. To the
big time.
JAMES
You don't think I'm ready now?
HESKETH
You are! I'm not! I've got to find you
a car first. And the money. The
economics of Formula 1 are terrifying.
BUBBLES
Hurry up. You don't want him to do
what Lauda did.
`Pop', HESKETH opens a bottle of champagne...
BUBBLES (contd)
The Goosestepper. Remember him?
JAMES makes the chicken noises again..
BUBBLES
Said he no longer wanted to risk his
life with "a bunch of crazy amateurs
and losers..."
JAMES
Is that what he called us?

DOC
Charming!
HESKETH
Nothing wrong with being an amateur!
BUBBLES
Said if he was going to risk his life,
he would only do so on the big
roulette table. Formula 1. So he got
himself a drive with BRM.
JAMES
What? How? He never won a thing! Not a
single bloody race.
HESKETH
Amateurs are what made this country
great.
BUBBLES
Took out a loan, apparently. Paid for
it himself.
HESKETH
"In war, as in lovemaking, amateurs
are invariably better than
professionals." Napoleon Bonaparte.
BUBBLES
A hundred and fifty grand!
JAMES
A hundred and fifty grand?
JAMES stares. Already sick with envy.
JAMES
That's either an act of utter lunacy,
or the ballsiest thing I ever heard.

The PAUL RICARD circuit near Marseilles in the South of

AGNES
Take a seat, please. I'll get someone

AGNES
Hi. There's someone here for you?
NIKI
(prompting)
Lauda.
AGNES
(misunderstanding, speaking
louder)
SOMEONE HERE TO SEE YOU.
She hangs up. NIKI decides against pointing out her mistake.
AGNES
They'll be right here.
NIKI
Thank you.
A silence. The RECEPTIONIST continues with her work. NIKI
watches her, unsure what to say, (small-talk not his forte)...
NIKI
Worked here long?
AGNES
Excuse me?
NIKI
Just wondered if you've worked here
long?
AGNES
Almost eight years.
NIKI
That long? And they didn't promote you
yet?
AGNES
Yes, several times. I am the AGNES.
Agnes Bonnet. If you're looking for
the receptionist, she's on her lunch.
NIKI is thrown. Feels humiliated. A total jerk. He is about to
say something when the door opens, and...
Two other F1 DRIVERS walk in..

Glamorous, long-haired, tanned, fashionable - like rock stars,
they talk effortlessly and flirt confidently with AGNES.
What are you doing answering the phones? New haircut! Like it.
What have you done to the weather?
They make her laugh. And smile.
NIKI feels invisible. Embarrassed. Awkward. Inadequate. He
gets to his feet. And goes to the car that has come to collect
him.
As he goes, (unseen by NIKI), AGNES watches him. Ignoring the
other DRIVERS. Intrigued.
He's different. Interesting. Intense. Intelligent eyes.
31

NIKI is led into the workshop to see a red and white Marlboro
sponsored car, number 21, with a tall air-intake duct just

MECHANIC
There she is. The P160..
NIKI
Same as Regazzoni's?

MECHANIC
Identical in every detail.
NIKI scrutinizes the car...
NIKI
She looks heavy. How much does she
weigh?
MECHANIC
540 kilos.
NIKI
That's crazy. Why so heavy..?
MECHANIC
It's a 3 litre, V12 engine, that thing
weighs 190k alone.
NIKI
What horsepower are you getting out of
it?
MECHANIC
450.
NIKI
Not enough. Needs to be 500 and the
engine needs to be 20k lighter.
MECHANIC
We already tried...
NIKI
Did you use magnesium parts?
The MECHANICS look at one another skeptically...
33
33
Shooting from above:
The entire car has been stripped to a thousand pieces. Now
spread all over the workshop floor.
NIKI's team of mechanics reluctantly work through the night
making the adjustments which NIKI is suggesting...
NIKI
Any solid plate, strip it out...
More disbelieving, skeptical looks. The car is in pieces on
the floor. NIKI brews coffee to keep people alert. Focused.

STANLEY comes into the workshop where NIKI and his MECHANICS
are in conversation, getting changed...
STANLEY
All right. What did you do to the car?
NIKI
That's information I will share with
you under certain conditions only.
STANLEY stares, bracing himself..
STANLEY
Go on...
NIKI
A guaranteed place in the team, and a
paid contract on equal terms with
Regazzoni for two years.
STANLEY
Are you crazy? Clay's a senior figure
in Formula One...you're a rookie. The
only reason we took you ON was because
you were paying us.
NIKI
Well, as of now, if you want me to
stay, we rip up the contract. I don't
pay you a cent.
STANLEY
It's outrageous.
NIKI
Was he quicker in my car? He was,
wasn't he?

NIKI is in the showers, then getting changed for his date with
AGNES. He is about to go, when he stops, and sees...
CLAY REGAZZONI getting undressed, looking at NIKI. CLAY speaks
English with an Italian accent..
REGAZZONI
I know what you're going to say. That
it's none of my business...
NIKI
What?
REGAZZONI
If it's the Track Manager you're
taking on your date tonight?
NIKI immediately becomes defensive...
NIKI
It's none of your business.
REGAZZONI
Okay, but if you want my advice...I'd

suicidal jerk on the track, and for
going all night, and all day
afterwards...and all night again in
bed. He's an OK driver, but an
IMMORTAL fuck, apparently. I don't
know about you, but that's not an act
I'd like to follow.
(shrugs)
But if that doesn't bother you...
NIKI
What's his name? The driver?
REGAZZONI
Hunt. James Hunt.
NIKI stares. Can hardly believe it.
REGAZZONI
See? You share information, I share
information.
CLAY slaps NIKI on his back, and goes into the showers..
REGAZZONI
That's what team-mates are for.

HESKETH
Isn't she a beauty? The March 731.
Converted by the brilliant Doc..!
DOC POSTLETHWAITE takes a modest bow. JAMES shakes hands with
everyone, including his brother, (and manager), PETER..
JAMES
She is a beauty. But...haven't you
made a mistake?
HESKETH
What?
JAMES
That's not a Formula 2 car. She's F1.
HESKETH
She is, Superstar. Why? Because I got
together with the beancounters, and it

not so significantly different to the
economics of Formula 2...

HESKETH
Actually, I got the idea after what

PETER
Grow up.

Shut up, Moneyman. `Didn't ask you..

Your brother's right. You've got to

match it with a whole different mental
approach. Professionalism. Maturity.
Like Niki.

And `toy'. I can't believe what I'm
seeing.
JAMES
Why?
SUZY
It's just so small! For something that
costs so much. And so flimsy. There's
no comfort. No protection. Nothing.
JAMES
No. Just a little coffin, surrounded
by high-octane fuel, being driven
round at 170 miles per hour..

JAMES (contd)
(becoming grave)
To all intents and purposes a bomb. On
wheels.
SUZY
Why don't they make it safer?
JAMES
No one wants it to be. It's like
saying why not make bullfighting
safer? It's a blood sport. The risk of
death turns people on. Without it, I
guess, it'd be half the fun. Which is
fine for the voyeurs, fine for TV,
fine for everyone..
(a beat)
...except us drivers.
SUZY looks JAMES up and down. Sees the bare feet, the rock
star good looks...
SUZY
You're James, aren't you?
JAMES
Yes.
SUZY
Thought so. You fit the description.
(shaking hands)
Suzy. Friend of Alex's.
JAMES
I know exactly.
In the background: one of the MECHANICS shows DOC a picture of
SUZY from a tabloid newspaper. She's clearly the most famous
model in Britain, and a star in her own right...
JAMES
What was the description?
SUZY
Mostly positive in terms of
appearance. Negative only in terms of
character. I've been told to avoid
you.
JAMES
By whom?
SUZY
Alex. He says you're a bad boy.

JAMES
Was. Not any more. New me very
professional. Early to bed. Early to

SUZY
Really?
JAMES
Round-the-clock work, practise and
focus. Tedious, but apparently the
only way to vin against ze
Goosestepper..
SUZY
Is that what you were doing when you
came in?
JAMES
Visualization techniques. Memorizing
the circuit, in this case Monaco,
which is next up. Eyes closed, know
your way round in your sleep...
(a beat)
I know...I've always been a great
believer in getting there on the day,
putting the old foot down and playing
chicken with everyone else.
SUZY laughs..
JAMES
But they don't want me to do that
anymore...they want my body like a
temple. My mind like Monk.
SUZY
And your soul? Your heart?
JAMES
What does that mean?
SUZY
You can't be so disciplined in all
areas of your life, can you..?
JAMES
They want me to stop messing around,
get married and settle down with the
next nice girl I meet. They think it
would be good for me.
SUZY
What do you think?

ENZO
We are happy to welcome back to the

NIKI
I understand. It's business. I would
be the same.
REGAZZONI
But it isn't just business, is it?
What we do? It's passion. Love. Which
is why we're prepared to risk our
lives for it.
NIKI
Not me. If I thought I had more talent
and could earn better money doing
something else, I would.
REGAZZONI
But how do you know you will make
money here? You haven't yet.
NIKI
Not yet. But I will.
(smiles)
If you can, I can.
REGAZZONI shakes his head, can't help smiling...
REGAZZONI
You know, are you ever NOT an asshole?
NIKI laughs...
NIKI
Why am I an asshole? You know by now
I'm both quicker than you and better
at setting up the car. You can't deal
with that, then you're the asshole.
REGAZZONI
Screw you.
REGAZZONI pulls up outside the house...
REGAZZONI (contd)
I brought you along today because you
seem like a lonely kind of guy. I
thought if I introduce you to some
nice people, it'd be good for you.
Forget it. Make your own friends.

JAMES stops, noticing BUBBLES's expression...
JAMES
What's the matter?
Then JAMES notices what BUBBLES is doing. He's packing.
JAMES
What are you doing?
Then JAMES notices the lack of activity in the workshops. None
of the usual mechanics, or engineers..
JAMES
Where is everyone?
BUBBLES looks up. Unsure how to break it to him.

An old drawing-room. The open fire roars. But HESKETH is
uncharacteristically quiet. Defeated..
HESKETH
Do you know what the date is today?
JAMES
November 14th.
HESKETH
Do you have any idea of the
significance of that date?
JAMES
I'm assuming it refers to some animal
you are allowed or no longer allowed
to slaughter on your estate.
HESKETH
Actually it's the deadline for
securing sponsorship for the
forthcoming Formula 1 season.

Which elapsed at midnight last night.
And we didn't attract any.

JAMES
So? We aren't looking for sponsorship.
Condoms and cigarettes. Vulgar, right?
HESKETH
Right. Except we are. Or were. I've
made something of a miscalculation.
The economics. Formula 1. Reality
thereof. Turns out not like the lower
divisions at all.
JAMES
What are you saying?
HESKETH
I'm saying it's over, Superstar. The
banks have stepped in. Read me the
riot act. Started laying everyone off.
Probably have to sell this place. Fun
while it lasted, would do it all again
and all that...

I daren't tell you the actual figures.
JAMES stares at a devastated HESKETH...
JAMES

JAMES is on the phone to his brother PETER, while playing
Scale-electrix cars on a track alone, barefoot...
JAMES
I need a drive, Pete. Need you to find
me a drive.

What does that mean? "My reputation
precedes me?"
"Crash", the electric toy car crashes...
JAMES
(listens)
Really? Is that what they said?
(a beat)
Did they at least say a "Quick

Bollocks to Lotus. Find me someone

SUZY
Don't worry. Something will turn up.
JAMES opens a bottle of Scotch, pours himself a drink...
SUZY
But I doubt that will help in the

JAMES knocks back the drink...
SUZY
Why don't we go away for the week-end?
Before I leave again for New York?
JAMES carries on drinking..
SUZY
Talk to me, James. Don't make a
stranger of me.
JAMES doesn't react...
SUZY
I can't watch this.
SUZY picks up her coat, and bag..
JAMES
What were you hoping for? A well-
adjusted knight in shining armour?
SUZY
No danger of that....
JAMES
Let me give you some advice.
SUZY
I'm all ears...
JAMES
Don't go to men who are willing to
kill themselves driving in circles
looking for normality.
SUZY
Well, I certainly didn't get that...

Should have gone for one of my
brothers.

There goes that self-pity again.
How striking it is -
JAMES
What's that? Tell me..
SUZY
The gulf between appearance and
reality. Look at you, all sunshine
blonde beauty and smiles...yet the
reality is...a frightened, immature,
depressed, self-pitying child...
JAMES
At least there's SOMETHING behind the
facade.
SUZY
With a nasty temper..
JAMES
Fuck off to New York, dear. There must
be a moisturizer or eye shadow
somewhere that needs your vapid mush
to flog it.

How quickly beauty can turn ugly.

Agreed. Repellent.

A large boardroom. Team Director TEDDY MAYER (American, from
Pennsylvania, short, lawyerly, 50's - hair turning grey) sits
at the head of the table.
Next to him is Aussie Marlboro spokesman JOHN HOGAN and
McLaren Team Manager and chief mechanic ALASTAIR CALDWELL.
The atmosphere is tense, uncomfortable...
MAYER
I'll come straight to the point. Our
esteemed lead driver...
CALDWELL
Fitti-fucking-paldi..
MAYER
Has ditched us for another team at the
last minute..
CALDWELL
In November. Fucking outrageous.

MAYER
And we need a replacement. Asap.

CALDWELL
Like Jackie Ickx.
JAMES
I'm quicker than Jackie.
MAYER
But he's consistent, dependable.
Sponsor friendly. He'll dress up nice.
Say the right things.
JAMES
What do you want? A driver or a
brushes salesman?
MAYER
We want to be successful.
JAMES
So do I. But I measure that in podium
finishes and beating Niki Lauda not
being a show pony for sponsors.
MAYER
I've heard about this thing with
Lauda.
CALDWELL
(rolls eyes)
Everyone has..
MAYER
You really think you can beat him?
He's World Champion.
JAMES
I beat him in Formula 3.
CALDWELL
This season alone he's had eight
podiums, five wins, you've had what?
HOGAN
One.
JAMES
Only because I've been in the wrong
car. I beat him when the playing field
was level. I'd beat him again in a
McLaren.

The McLaren MECHANICS, supervised by Alastair Caldwell, are
making adjustments to the car to make it `legal'..
MAYER
...we have to move the wing forward.
To make it legal...
CALDWELL
But that'll have a knock-on effect on
the oil coolers..
JAMES watches - already fearing the worst - as the car is
stripped down, effectively being rebuilt...

Later: the victorious NIKI, wearing the garland, is all
smiles, giving `winner' interviews, surrounded by MARLENE and
a delighted LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO.
JAMES is also giving interviews, but in a total fury.
Vibrating with anger. Still complaining about the
disqualification. Complaining about a conspiracy. Complaining.
NIKI finishes talking to JOURNALISTS, and walks off, through
crowds, and bumps into JAMES..
NIKI
So...six races in. How's it going so
far?
JAMES
Fine! Just got a little problem with a
bad loser rat and his team of Italian
saboteurs who've destroyed my car.
NIKI
What are you talking about?
JAMES
I won that race in Spain. And you know
it.
NIKI
In an illegal car.
JAMES
The aerofoil was five eighths of an
inch too long!! Something that doesn't
have the slightest effect on car
speed. You complained. Now we've had
to totally rebuild the car and it's
become a monster.

JAMES
A car that was beating you week in
week out, so you have to resort to
this. Cheating.
NIKI
He drives in an illegal car and he
calls ME the cheat? Let me tell you:
two weeks before that race in Spain,
we put 20-inch rims on the rear
wheels. We get an extra half second
speed on each lap!! But the Old Man
tells me we can't use those rims, they
make the car too wide. Against the
rules. So we go back to 19-inch rims
making the car slower again. Rules are
rules. For all of us. You're just a
bad loser who can't accept that.
(tapping head, to MARLENE)
Komm, he's crazy. Sick in the head.
NIKI turns to MARLENE, speaks in German...
NIKI
Den Trottel lassen wir alleine..
(Let's go. Leave this jerk
alone.)
No wonder she left him...
NIKI and MARLENE go. JAMES is left staring. Not understanding.

JAMES walks into the crowded MCLAREN pits. Sees TEDDY MAYER
and ALASTAIR CALDWELL...
JAMES
Is there something I should know about
Suzy? Where is she? Wasn't she
supposed to be here today?
CALDWELL nervously indicates the Sunday newspapers...
CALDWELL
We kept it from you. Didn't want to
tell you before the race...
JAMES looks at the newspapers, then his expression changes.

Lurid headlines about SUZY HUNT in New York with RICHARD
BURTON. Pictures all over the front pages of RICHARD BURTON,
ELIZABETH TAYLOR, SUZY and JAMES. JAMES's face falls..
JAMES

A large hotel suite. There are flowers everywhere. Newspapers
are all over the table.
JAMES sits opposite SUZY. He sees an expensive gift; recently
opened. A diamond necklace..

SUZY nods. Even the uninitiated eye can tell: it's worth a
fortune.

SUZY
Why have you come here, James?
JAMES
To get you back.
SUZY
You don't want me back...you never
wanted to be married in the first
place. You did it because you hoped it
might change you...settle you down...
help with the racing. Not because you
loved me. And who knows, if it had
been just the drinking, or the dope,
or the infidelity, or the moods...it
might even have worked...but when it's
all of them?
JAMES
I know. I'm terrible.
SUZY
No, you're not terrible. You're
just...who you are...at this point in
your life. And God help anyone that
wants more.
JAMES
Will he be able to give you more? He
has quite the bad boy reputation
himself.
SUZY
What's important is how it feels to
me. And it feels like he adores me.
A flicker behind JAMES's eyes. Failure.
JAMES
Right.
SUZY
He's aware of the delicacy of the
situation, and how it looks. Having
raided your larder. Plundered your
safe. Smash and grab, and so forth. So
he's assured me he'll take care of the
financial side. And will be very
generous.
JAMES manages a brave smile.
JAMES
Fine. I'll give him a call.

JAMES notices the vast unmade bed. Where, until recently, two
people had slept.
122
JAMES sits alone in the first class section. A loser on the
track, and a loser in love, too. Being played out in the full
glare of publicity. On the front pages. Being read by everyone
on the plane.
A STEWARDESS looks over, catches his eye. Smiles.
123
JAMES and the STEWARDESS fucking. Hard.
Nothing to do with pleasure. An analgesic - a way of blocking
out the pain. JAMES catches his own reflection in the mirror.
Teeth clenched. Eyes burning with anger and self-loathing...
OVER THIS: we fade in the ROAR of car engines...

JAMES's teeth still clenched. Eyes still burning with anger.
Driving flat out. At the limit.

Make that beyond the limit. At the point of no return. The car
shaking. Weaving recklessly through other cars...
Where death has become a real option.
Because he doesn't care anymore. Because it's all he deserves
anyway...
And in that moment, in reaching his lowest point, JAMES has
unwittingly stumbled on the one thing that gives him an
advantage over everyone else...
The fact that he doesn't care. The fact that death has become
an option. The fact that there is no risk he is not prepared
to take...
So every corner is tighter, every braking point later, every
gap is an opening, no matter how tiny...

Away from the cameras. Just them. And a witness from the pub.
135
NIKI and an INSTRUCTOR are in the plane. In the cockpit. With
MARLENE, who watches...
NIKI is learning to fly.
MARLENE watches as NIKI soaks up the instruction, asking
questions, happy. It's another side to him, completely.
137
MARLENE is fast asleep. She wakes, to discover the bed is
empty beside her..
138
MARLENE walks through the house, looking for NIKI. Then finds
him on a balcony...alone..
MARLENE
Come to bed.
MARLENE notices his mood. It's different.
MARLENE
What's the matter?
NIKI
It's the enemy, you know. Happiness.
NIKI looks up at MARLENE...
NIKI
It weakens you. Puts doubt in your
mind. Because all of a sudden you have
something to lose..
MARLENE stares at him.
MARLENE
When you call happiness an enemy, then
it's too late.

Then you have lost already.
MARLENE turns, and goes..
NIKI is left alone. We can tell from his expression, he is
struggling with something for the first time. Fear.

In the pits, everyone is shaken. JAMES, REGAZZONI, and other
DRIVERS nervously talk among themselves as the Ambulance races

NIKI's face: visibly pale. More frightened than ever.
142
About sixty people, (26 DRIVERS and all the different team
REPRESENTATIVES), are assembled in the room, where a blazered
FIA OFFICIAL and a member of the DRIVERS SAFETY COMMITTEE are
sitting behind a table...
A buzz of anticipation and curiosity. What's going on? What is
all this about? NIKI gets to his feet, raises his hands
calling for silence...

NIKI
Thank you. I called this meeting
because as all drivers know the
Nurburgring is a race track from the
Stone Ages. The most stupid, barbaric,
outdated, dangerous, track in the
world. You've all seen the rain which
has been falling this morning. Those
of you with experience know the Ring
needs perfect conditions to be even
remotely acceptable in terms of risk.
As you can see today is anything BUT
perfect, so I called this meeting to
take a vote to cancel the race.
A ripple of astonished reactions among the drivers..
NIKI
There would be no change to the
situation as far as points is
concerned. The race would simply be
cancelled.
TEDDY MAYER looks over at FERRARI representatives....
MAYER
This is bullshit...
Another DRIVER (GUY EDWARDS) gets to his feet...
EDWARDS
If the race is cancelled, none of us
get our race fees...
NIKI
It's true. You leave without your fee,
but you might leave with your LIFE.
Another voice pierces the controversy...
VOICE
It also means you would effectively
win the championship.
It's JAMES HUNT, who is standing up...
JAMES
So I can see why this suits you just
fine.
NIKI
Why? There would be no points for me
either...

ARTURO MERZARIO
Ferrari's dirty tricks! We've seen it
before!
HARALD ERTL
Maybe it's just that he's frightened?
Laughter among the DRIVERS...
NIKI
Which asshole said this?
Silence. No hand goes up. No one has the courage to own up.
NIKI
Yes, I am frightened. Always a little
bit when I race. I accept every time I
get in my car there is 20% chance that
I could die. But not one per cent
more. And today, with the rain the
risk IS more. How dare you accuse me
of lack of courage? Let me remind you.
I have the track record here. I am the
only person in history to do the Ring
in under 7 minutes. So actually it's
to my ADVANTAGE to race here today.
Because I'm quicker than all of you.
A stunned silence. One voice pierces the room...
JAMES
Fine. Then let's race!
It's JAMES who stares at NIKI: a ripple of excitement and
enthusiasm among the other drivers...
JAMES
There's a hundred thousand fans out
there who would never forgive us if we
didn't.
MERZARIO
And some of us need our race fees!!

All those in favour of cancelling the

JAMES puts his hand up. Clearly the more popular, charismatic
figure among the DRIVERS, everyone else follows.
FIA OFFICIAL
Gentlemen, start your engines!!
A clear victory for JAMES. He has swung the room.
Everyone leaves the room. JAMES and TEDDY MAYER give one
another a discreet hi-five...
But we rack focus through the crowd to see NIKI staring at
JAMES accusingly...holding his gaze.
145
Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the
crazy, panicked situation as JAMES comes into the pits to
change to dry tyres.
The McLaren team frantically changes the tyres. Four men with
air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks.
ALASTAIR CALDWELL appears, talks to JAMES..
CALDWELL
See? I told you to go on slicks!! You
didn't take my advice...
JAMES
Shut up! Where's Niki?
CALDWELL
Behind you! He made the same mistake!
JAMES looks in his mirror to see NIKI's red helmet behind him
in the pits, then...
"Thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac. JAMES gets the
signal, `Clear!'
CALDWELL
Go! Go!! Go!!
JAMES's foot hits the floor. He roars out, with new tyres,
leaving NIKI behind him in the pits...
147
JAMES gives it everything he's got. Tearing through the gears,
breaking as late as he can, engine screaming.
The world flies past in a blur. The steering wheel shakes. The
car cannot be driven any harder. No thought for safety. No
thought of failure..
Failure is unimaginable. Unconscionable.
He turns into the final straight, then stops when he sees
something ahead.

Accident. Bad one.
JAMES
Who?

NIKI

We can just make out the barely recognizable figures of the
other DRIVERS rushing towards him, as their hands get burnt in
the flames as they try unsuccessfully to undo his seatbelt...
We notice it is the same DRIVERS that were critical of NIKI in
the driver's meeting. HARALD ERTL, BRETT LUNGER, ARTURO
MERZARIO, GUY EDWARDS...
Fire extinguishers blast at the car. Covering NIKI's helmet.
Filling his lungs with chemicals, along with the smoke and
fumes, blurring his vision, as he screams horribly..
The sound of panicked TV COMMENTARY in different languages.
Screaming voices. Panicked reactions.
Then sound fades. As NIKI blacks out - losing consciousness.

It's not the burns to his face that
are the danger. It's the burns to his
lungs. His blood oxygen level is
currently...
NURSE
6.8.
DOCTOR
Which is not enough to maintain
life...
NIKI slips out of consciousness again. MARLENE is distraught,
in tears.

TV news: giving the latest information on NIKI's condition.
155
JAMES sits watching the news on TV in his apartment, while
feeding his budgerigars, (the collection has grown)..
He feels terrible. He goes to his desk, pulls out paper and
pen...
JAMES tries to find the right words, tries to write, tries to
put his feelings on paper, but words in general, and letters
in particular have never been his thing...
JAMES scrunches up the pieces of paper, throws it away. The
budgerigars, sensing his distress, flutter and peep..
156
NIKI's P.O.V: feels someone touching his forehead and his
hands with oil...and the sound of a WOMAN weeping...
PRIEST
...durch diese heilige Salbung helfe
dir der Herr in seinem reichen
Erbarmen, er stehe dir bei mit der
Kraft des Heiligen Geistes...
NIKI's eyes barely crack open, barely manage to focus to see
an ELDERLY PRIEST is giving him the last rites in German..
The sound of MARLENE crying somewhere in the room.
PRIEST
Der Herr der dich von Sunden befreit,
rette dich in seiner Gnade richte er
dich auf...
NIKI strains to move. A sense of excruciating pain.
He fights to open his eyes, give an indication...ANY
indication of the fact that he is hearing this, and is alive
and able to fight for life...
But to no avail. The PRIEST continues giving last rites.
MARLENE continues to cry. The PRIEST touches NIKI's
shoulder...
NIKI (V/O)
I'm here! Can't you tell? I'm here!
(CONTINUED)

156 CONTINUED:

NIKI screams inside. Wanting to be heard. Wanting to give them
a sign. He's OK. He's still there. But it's no use.
NIKI blacks out again. The pain is too great.
FADE TO BLACK:
157
Sunrise: MARLENE has been sitting in the hospital all night
supported by members of FAMILY and several FRIENDS.
Niki's MOTHER and FATHER. CLAY REGAZZONI.
Presently: the door to the intensive care unit opens and a
DOCTOR comes out, beckoning her...
DOCTOR
Frau Lauda? Bitte kommen Sie! He's
awake! And just spoke!
MARLENE scrambles to her feet...
MARLENE
What did he say?
DOCTOR
"Tell the Priest to fuck off! I'm
still alive!!"
MARLENE covers her mouth, laughs nervously, already in tears.
She and the DOCTOR rush into the intensive care unit.
158
Shooting through the window we see MARLENE approach NIKI's
bed. She sees NIKI..
And gasps. Trying to control her expression. Not give away to
him how horrified she is.
NIKI's face: is grotesque. His head has swollen to double it's
size. The skin has burned off on his head, his eyes.
MARLENE bravely composes herself. Then, without displaying the
shock she feels - she goes over and kisses him.

The starter's flag drops. On television we see the Austrian
Grand Prix start.
NIKI watches the race on television, while beginning his rehab
in bed, in pain as bandages are changed..
ON TV: JAMES narrowly misses out on a podium, but still gains
on NIKI in his points total...

NIKI continues his rehab in the hospital, now out of bed...
ON TV: the starter's flag drops. Another Grand Prix starts.
This time at Zandvoort, in the Netherlands..
NIKI watches the race on television as DOCTORS put a vacuuum
pump into his lungs. It's AGONY. JAMES leads, driving the
perfect race...
YOUNG GERMAN DOCTOR
We need to vacuum the lungs. Without
this, they can't heal. But it will
hurt.
An unimaginably painful pump is forced down his burned lungs,
to try to hoover out the impurities..
COMMENTATORS ON TV: talk about how HUNT is catching up with
LAUDA on points. It spurs NIKI on, through gritted teeth.
NIKI
Aaarrrggghhhh...
The chequered flag. JAMES crosses the line in first position.
CAPTION: "RACE 12. HUNT WINS."
The DOCTORS tell NIKI he's had enough vacuum treatment. He's
had more than enough pain. But NIKI waves them aside...
NIKI
Again!!
The DOCTOR nods. The vacuum is turned on again.
NIKI screams in agony. Eyes bulging. MARLENE and NIKI's family
cannot bear to watch...

NIKI screams again. MARLENE, NIKI's family and the DOCTORS are
deeply distressed, cannot bring themselves to watch, as...
NIKI
Aaaaarrrrggghghhhhhh!!
We WIDEN to reveal what NIKI is doing. What has caused these
unbearable, bloodcurdling screams of agony..
NIKI
I know what you're all thinking...
Now we see. With great difficulty NIKI has put his racing
helmet on for the first time. Pressing into his open burn
wounds...
NIKI
But if you love me - all of you - you
won't say a word.
He is almost unconscious with pain. His legs are weak. But he
has done it...
167
A packed press conference. The world's media. NIKI's accident
and recovery (as a story) has reached way beyond F1 race fans.
This is front page news around the globe..
NIKI walks out onto the podium - all eyes staring at him - the
sense of a ghoulish, voyeuristic freak show....
NIKI sits on the podium, in front of microphones, flanked on
both sides by FERRARI drivers and top brass. But no one wants
to talk to them. Everyone's here to talk to NIKI..
JAPANESE JOURNALIST
How are you feeling, Niki?
NIKI
Fine.
AMERICAN JOURNALIST
Can you confirm for us exactly which
procedures you have had? And the
expectations for your recovery?
(CONTINUED)
85
167 CONTINUED:
167
NIKI
Sure. I had a skin graft operation
where they put half my right thigh in
my face. It doesn't look too good but
one unexpected advantage is it's
impossible to perspire through a skin
graft, so sweat will never run in my
eyes again - which is good for a
driver.
Laughter. At the back of the hall, JAMES HUNT creeps in,
(unseen by anyone, disguised in a hat), to listen.
BRAZILIAN JOURNALIST
When they heard about your condition,
Ferrari immediately hired another
driver, Carlos Reutemann.
NIKI
Ja. Before even my first operation.
JAPANESE JOURNALIST
Is he your replacement now?
NIKI
No. Just another team-mate. Keen to
make an impression. So let's see where
Mr. Reutemann finishes today.
Laughter.
JAPANESE JOURNALIST
James Hunt and McLaren have caught up
a lot while you were away.
NIKI
Yes.
(a beat)
Is there a question now? Or are you
just trying to piss me off?
Laughter.
JAPANESE JOURNALIST
You think you can still win?
NIKI
Of course. I have the better car. I'm
the better driver. But he's a clever
guy and has used the time well while I
was lying half-dead in hospital to win
some points..
Laughter.

BRITISH JOURNALIST
What did your wife say when she saw
your face?
NIKI
She said, "Sweetie, you don't need a
face to drive. Only a right foot."
Laughter.
BRITISH JOURNALIST
I'm being serious. Do you really think
your marriage can survive? With the
way you look now?
Silence. NIKI squints into the lights..
NIKI
And I'm being serious, too. Which
asshole said this? Jesus..
No one moves. NIKI, disgusted, rips off his microphone..
NIKI
Fuck you. Press conference over.
NIKI walks out. The Press Conference breaks up...
JAMES sees the REPORTER who asked the question, laughing with
his friends. JAMES watches as the REPORTER leaves...
168
JAMES goes after the REPORTER, and calls him..
JAMES
Hey..!
The REPORTER turns, recognizes JAMES..
JAMES
I've got something for you on that
last question...
The BRITISH JOURNALIST smiles, "Great, thanks James!" Pulls
out a tape recorder. JAMES takes him to one side, then...
"WHACK, WHACK, WHACK" - JAMES punches his lights out, then
takes the tape recorder, stuffs it into the JOURNALISTS mouth.
JAMES
Now go home to your wife and ask her
how YOU look!!

JAMES sees NIKI coming up behind him. Cannot believe his eyes.
JAMES move to block NIKI's path...
NIKI attacks fearlessly. Despite terrible pain. NIKI moves to
overtake JAMES.
Utterly intimidated by NIKI's bravery, JAMES panics, and loses
control of the car. He spins out..
COMMENTATORS cannot believe their eyes. HUNT's blown it!
LAUDA's overtaken him!
It's a miracle. It defies belief. As NIKI crosses the line....

The man was in a coma. His doctors
pronounced him dead!! Then he comes

BUBBLES HORSLEY back at home in England. At a breakfast
table..
BUBBLES (ON PHONE)
What did you expect? That Niki would
give you the championship lying down?
Of course not. He's a fighter. He's
going to come at you with everything
he's got. But you can do this. As a
driver, you're his equal - better,
maybe. And God knows you're quick and
brave enough. You just..
JAMES (ON PHONE)
What?
BUBBLES (ON PHONE)
Need to find the respect for yourself
to close out when it really matters.
You don't much like yourself, James -
that's the problem, therefore don't
believe you deserve it.
174B
A knock at JAMES's hotel room door..
JAMES
I've got to go.
JAMES hangs up, and goes to the door. He snaps it open to
reveal..
Two gorgeous-looking BOAC Stewardesses standing outside. Smart
blue blazers, short skirts, white gloves, blue caps..
STEWARDESS
Hi. We've come for the party?
JAMES
What party?
STEWARDESS
The party we were told was going on in
room 2109.
Sure enough: on JAMES's door, the number 2109.
JAMES
Who sent you here?

A man. On the phone. He didn't give

JAMES
This man. Did he speak with an accent?
STEWARDESS
Yes. German accent.
JAMES can't believe it. NIKI.
JAMES
I'm afraid it was a joke..
STEWARDESS
(liking the look of JAMES)
Awwww. Pity.
JAMES
Sorry, ladies. Any other time. Not
tonight.
JAMES closes the door. Goes back into his hotel room. Then,
after a moment...
He snaps open the door. The STEWARDESSES are about to
disappear into the elevator...
JAMES
Wait..!

NIKI wakes up and looks out of the window. Sees the heavy rain
which is falling outside...
His expression changes.

JAMES wakes up. Flinches. JAMES looks around, bleary-eyed.
Hungover.
He's in a room that looks like a bomb has hit it.

The two STEWARDESSES are still asleep in the bed beside him.
Uniforms discarded on the floor.
Memories are now flooding back. Jesus, what was he THINKING?
JAMES leaps out of bed.
178
NIKI is being massaged by WILLI DUNGL in his hotel room in
preparation for the race.
NIKI continues to stare out of the window. They speak in
German. We see sub-titles..
NIKI
Can't see the mountain.
DUNGL
So?
NIKI
The locals here believe if you can see
the mountain in the morning, it brings
good luck.
NIKI's POV: the view. Nothing but mist, dark skies and rain.

A driver's meeting has been called. All the DRIVERS are in a
small room, arguing and remonstrating with FIA OFFICIALS and
blazer-wearing POWERS THAT BE...
A Japanese official, (AKIYAMA), is trying to keep the peace...
AKIYAMA
One at a time! Gentlemen, please!
Local JAPANESE DRIVERS are complaining in Japanese, (we see
sub-titles)...
TAKAHARA
You can't send us out in that! It's a
death sentence!
HASEMI
You have to postpone the race!

JAMES, MAYER and CALDWELL arrive in a corridor outside the
meeting room...
MAYER
Niki's talking to them about
cancelling the race.
JAMES's POV: he can see NIKI, his wounds horribly visible,
remonstrating with the JAPANESE OFFICIAL about the dangerous
track conditions...
JAMES turns to TEDDY and ALASTAIR...
JAMES
I don't want any part of this. I'm not
going to be responsible for turning
the room again.
CALDWELL
But you have no option. You HAVE to
race, James. It's your only shot. If
you don't, Niki wins..
JAMES
I'm not voting against Niki
again....or forcing fellow drivers to
risk their lives. Sorry. World
Championship or not...
JAMES raises his hands and walks off. CALDWELL shouts after
him, "James, wait..!" Then MAYER reassures CALDWELL...

The JAPANESE OFFICIAL is struggling to keep order in the room.
MAYER
The drivers can vote all they like.
A round of applause in the room, as the DRIVERS vote to cancel
the race. But unseen by the DRIVERS..
The FIA OFFICIALS, TV NETWORK EXECUTIVES, and the blazered
POWERS THAT BE are in dark, conspiratorial discussion..
...making the decision that the race goes ahead.

In the pits alongside JAMES...
A series of shots of the other DRIVERS...being sent out like
lambs to the slaughter...
Visibly terrified, mouthing prayers, smoking last cigarettes,
meditating, crossing themselves, hands shaking..
Among them the JAPANESE DRIVERS. All laughter gone now.
Realizing what they've got into. Risking their lives.
Finally we come to rest on NIKI. Strangely calm.
NIKI puts on his balaclava over his still-raw wounds, wincing
with pain as he puts on his helmet..

JAMES's spray makes it impossible for NIKI to see. NIKI can't
blink his eyes...it's agony.
Half-blind, NIKI tries to overtake. Gives it everything he's
got, breaking as late as he can, tearing through the gears...
For NIKI the world flies past in a near-blind blur. The
steering wheel shakes. The car cannot be driven any harder.
But the visibility is terrible. The spray tears into his
scarred eyes. He is unable to see anything but...
MARLENE's beautiful face: staring at him. Smiling tenderly.
Kissing him tenderly.

JAMES tries to fend NIKI off. Swerves this way and that. But
his wounded car is now running at seventy per cent at best...
...and disaster!!! NIKI OVERTAKES HIM...
JAMES screams in agony and frustration. He's lost it! And has
no one to blame but himself! His own arrogance. And
stubbornness. NIKI's overtaken him!
THE CHEQUERED FLAG.
JAMES roars past. Has finished in third place. But that is no
consolation. NIKI has beaten him. As far as he's concerned..
