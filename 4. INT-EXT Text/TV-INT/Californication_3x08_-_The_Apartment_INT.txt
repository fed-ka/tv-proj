      HANK s in the living room.  Talking dirty to his laptop.

                                  HANK
                    Come on... show me something.  
                    Start small.  The hint of an 
                    aureola.  The suggestion of a 
                    nipple maybe.  See how it feels and 
                    we ll go from there.  No pressure.  
                    Unless you wanna see my schween.  
                     Cause I ll totally unfurl for ya.  
                    I m not shy.

                    Hank.  Stop it.  Your daughter 
                    could walk out at any second.  

                                  HANK
                    That s impossible.

                    Unlikely maybe, not impossible.  
                    And I highly doubt she wants to see 
                    your schween.

                                  HANK
                    Gross.  Why ya gotta talk like 
                    that?  But there s like 0.0 percent 
                    chance of that happening.  She s 
                    not even on the premises.

      Karen is immediately annoyed.  Yep, you can tell.

                    Shit, you re right.  I guess I 
                    should explore the grounds.  There 
                    could be a portal of some kind in

                    Me, it s my fault?  You were agin

                    with the Tudors.  I can t win with 
                    you, woman.

      Karen smiles.  Starts to take her top off.  Hank gets 
      excited.  Rubs his hands together.  And then she abruptly 
      signs off.  Hank is perturbed by the virtual cock-tease.

                                  HANK
                    That was not nice.  Seriously, that 
                    was mean.

      Hank slams the laptop shut.  Bored, he picks up his nearby 
      Les Paul.  Plucks a few notes.  Plays rock star for a moment.

      A KNOCK at the front door.  Guitar slung low behind him, he 
      makes his way to the door.

      Hank gradually wakes up in a bed full of naked strippers.  
      Only one of whom is awake and looking at him fondly:  Jackie.  
      The other two are still passed out.

                                  HANK
                    I know we killed that bottle of 
                    Jack, but I don t remember making 
                    the sex with Betty and Veronica.

                                  JACKIE
                    Nah, they mostly amused themselves.  
                    I m not so good with the sharing.

      Much with the kissing and the fondling.

                                  HANK
                    Hey, you never told me what you 
                    guys were out celebrating.

                                  JACKIE
                    Oh, yeah.  That.  My last dance.

                    Well, to be fair and balanced about 
                    it all, the phrase  breaking up  
                    suggests that, once upon a time, we 
                    were together.

                                  JACKIE

                    sheer amount of no holds barred sex 
                    we ve been having does not indicate 
                    a certain level of intimacy?

                    Okay, I hear that.  And I know it 
                    feels fairly momentous and all, but 
                    I think this is one of those rites

                    one.  Used to really gross me out.  
                    Now I understand.  It s like she 
                    was fucking me before she met me.

      gets out of bed.  Heads out of the room.

                      elsewhere.  In Santa Monica,

      Hank opens the door to a cheerful CHARLIE and a twitchy RICK 
        SPRINGFIELD.

                    Of course he knows who you are.  
                    You guys met at my place.  Shared a 
                    meal, in fact.  Broke some bread.

      The boys walk in just as Jackie and the other stripper have 
      the comatose one sitting up on the edge of the bed.

      But as soon as they let go, she slumps off the bed, onto the 
      floor, landing with a most unpleasant THUD.   CALIFORNICATION    EP.308   PRODUCTION DRAFT    6/2/09  9.

                    take a look at why you re shitting 
                    so much blood.

      Charlie and Rick Springfield pick up the semi-conscious 
      stripper and start carrying her toward the front door.  The 
      other stripper looks at Rick.  Makes a connection.

                    that would take very long.

      Just as they re about to throw down, there s another KNOCK at 
      the door.  Everyone stops short.

      Hank shushes everyone, goes to the door.  Looks through the 
      peephole.  It s JILL.  Aargh.  He waits a beat, hoping she ll 
      go away.

      Once they re all safely ensconced, Hank opens the door to a 
      very playful and coquettish Jill.

      Hank shoves her in Becca s room and closes the door.

      He goes to the front door and opens it to Felicia.  She 
      smiles, nervous and giddy.  Walks right in.  Hank follows her 
      into the living room area.

                    I did.  That was some very intense 
                    and powerful love-making, Hank.
                          (off his look)
                    What s wrong?

                                  HANK
                    I m just not a big fan of that 
                    phrase.  Love-making.  Making love.  
                    I prefer fucking, banging, stuffing 
                    maybe.  Perhaps.  Take your pick.

                                    FELICIA
                    Well... so much for the afterglow.

                    I told him.

                    No such luck, I m afraid.

                                  HANK
                    Why on earth would you do something 
                    like that?

                                    FELICIA
                    He knew, Hank.  He saw it on my 
                    face.  The pure joy.  The glow of a 
                    freshly fucked and properly tended-
                    to woman.  So I told him.  Came 
                    clean.  Felt so good.  It was the 
                    right thing to do.

                    anymore.  We haven t for quite some 
                    time now.  Life is short.  I want 
                    to spend the rest of my days with 
                    someone I m passionate about.  
                    Someone who gives me butterflies.  
                    For better or for worse, Hank, that 
                    someone is you.

      Felicia puts a finger to his lips, shushing him.

                                    FELICIA

      At which point Charlie saunters out of bedroom, stripped down 
      to boxers and an unbuttoned dress shirt.

      He nods at them, gives a cheerful little wave, heads right 
      for the fridge.  Hunts around for a moment.  Pulls out a

      Charlie wipes his hand on his boxers before offering it to 
      her.  They shake.  She feels something unpleasant, wipes her 
      hand on her clothes.

      Cigarette in his mouth, Rick Springfield is using the stick

      And he s pouring hot candle wax on her back.

      Charlie, meanwhile, is receiving oral from the same girl.

                    Felicia is wonderful.  A beautiful 
                    wife and mother.  I loved her the 
                    moment I set eyes on her.  I knew 
                    she was the one.  But she was 
                    always a little reserved in the 
                    sack.  The British, you know.  
                    There was never a surplus of oral.  
                    And what little there was dried up 
                    right after the wedding.  I never 
                      understood.  A man likes getting 
                    his dick sucked, ya know?

      Felicia pops up from hiding, scaring the shit out of both of 
      them...

                    Well, maybe if you took a goddamn 
                    shower once in a while.  Do you 
                    really a think a woman wants to go 
                    down on a man who s just walked in 
                    off the tennis court?  Or come from 
                    a ride?  Do you think I want to 
                    peel off those sweaty bike shorts 
                    and go to town?  Disgusting.

                                  DEAN KOONS
                    I m sorry, Felicia, but that 
                    happens to be when this man is at 
                    his horniest.  You know that.

                    Ugh.  No way.  That sounds awful.

                    It is awful.  You know how much of 
                    my life I ve wasted on that couch?  
                      Pretending we can just jabber

                    someone else.

      Ouch.  Both Hank and Dean Koons react as though punched in 
      the face.  Both for very different reasons, of course.

                    What s so ridiculous about it?  She 
                    seems to be in love with you.  Do 
                    you feel the same?  Do you love 
                    her?

      BECCA and CHELSEA enter the apartment.  Chatting and 
      laughing.  Stopping short when they see their parents.  Hank 
      is only too happy for the interruption.

      Nope.  Too late.  She walks into her bedroom.

      Hank watches the door.  No calamity from within.  He s

                    I m not mad, Dad.  Just 
                      disappointed.  But I guess I m 
                    getting used to it.

                                  HANK
                    Jesus.  Put a plastic bag over my 
                    head and get it over with already.  
                    That would be less painful.

                                  BECCA
                    How do you think I feel?  I know 
                    your heart s always in the right 
                    place -- sort of -- but I can t 
                    ever trust you to do the right 
                    thing.  Do you have any idea how 
                    scary that is for a kid?

                                  HANK
                    New York will be different.  A new 
                    chapter for all of us.  You ll see.

                                  BECCA
                    Right.  Ma ana.  The sun ll come 
                    out ma ana.
                          (then)
                    What do you want me to take away 
                    from this?  From how you treat 
                    women?  Is that all they are to 
                    you?  Walking vaginas?

                                  HANK
                    Look, there s no excuse for my 
                    behavior.  I can t defend myself if 
                    someone got hurt.  Especially 
                    you... my favorite and my best.  
                    But I need you to know that it all 
                    started with the best of 
                      intentions.
                          (then)
                    I guess I just wanted them to know 
                    that I saw it.  The thing that 
                    makes them special.  That s all 
                    anyone wants, right?  To be seen?  
                    To be recognized?  But then the 
                    lines got blurry.  And the fact 
                    that your mom and I are in such a 
                    weird place right now made 
                      everything all the more confusing.  
                    Hence the big, stinking mess.
                          (then)
                    I m sorry I let you down, sweets.   CALIFORNICATION    EP.308   PRODUCTION DRAFT    6/2/09  29.


                                  BECCA
                    I know you are.

                                  HANK
                    And I don t know how many times I 
                    can say I m sorry before it doesn t 
                    mean anything anymore.

                                  BECCA
                    I don t know either.  But I have 
                    this funny feeling we ll find out.

      They sit in silence for a moment.  The PHONE RINGS.  Hank 
      answers.

                                  HANK
                    Hello?  Oh, she s fine.  Not to 
                    worry.  Yeah, I talked to her.  
                    She...

      Becca looks at him, expecting the worst.

                                  HANK
                    ...she s at school.  All is well.  
                    I ll pick her up later.  We ll get 
                    some ice cream... go down to the 
                    beach... it ll be just like old 
                    times...

      Hank puts his arm around his daughter.  Brings her close.  
      Becca lays her head on his shoulder.

                                  HANK
                    Okay... we ll call you later.  Love 
                    you.  Bye.

      Hank hangs up.  They just sit there.  Both of them too 
      melancholy to talk.  Besides, what s left to say at this 
      point?

      And that s when the formerly semi-conscious stripper stumbles 
      out of Hank s bedroom, hair shooting out at odd angles...

      She s dazed, confused, and all kinds of naked...

                                  STRIPPER #2
                    Where s my fucking clothes...?

      A moment.  Hank looks at Becca and we...

                                                                          FADE OUT.
