      1... MISSING AGENT

      INT. SIMON KRAFT S APARTMENT - NIGHTA1A1

      CLOSE ON A HAND feverishly sketching multiple images of a 
      dragon. TILT UP to find its artist, SIMON KRAFT, looking 
      dazed, as if channeling the drawing. 

      EXT. CHINATOWN STREET - NIGHT11

      PAN OFF ANOTHER DRAGON AND FIND --

      A busy street decorated for the Chinese New Year. People 
      passing by jump as SKATER BOYS shoot past them hurling 
      firecrackers. THE SKATER BOYS roll past...

      THREE YOUNG ASIAN WOMEN (20s) meandering toward Hop Louie s 
      Silk Dragon Restaurant, looking for someone, something.

      A SILVER VAN PULLS UP NEAR THE RESTAURANT and stops. The 
      women speak Mandarin Chinese.

                                  LILY
                    Noshi wei wo men lai de ma? (You here 
                    for us?)
                          (the driver nods)
                    Cho yong goi shi hong se de ba?  
                    (Supposed to be a red van?)

      The driver indicates get in. The third woman (KIM HSAIO) 
      seems suspicious -- something about the van, the driver. 

                                  KIM
                    Bu, wo goi bian zhu yi le.  (No, I 
                    changed my mind.)

      She starts to walk off. 

      The other two women see her and hesitate. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        NUMB3RS: 513/92 - "Trouble in..." - Rev. Yellow - 12/1/08    2. 

      CONTINUED:11

      Suddenly the van door slides opens and two Asian men pull the 
      two girls into the vehicle.

      Our smart girl, Kim, sees the commotion and starts running. 
      She runs past a wall, unaware of --

      THE  MISSING WOMEN  POSTERS stuck to the bricks. (The posters 
      resemble those found around Manhattan after 9/11, hung by 
      families and friends. Except these missing are all Asian.) 

      SHE CROUCHES BEHIND A PARKED RED FORD FOCUS, takes a small 
      cell phone out of her pocket, and makes an urgent call 
      (Speaks English, American dialect).

      Bottle rockets go off in the night sky, firecrackers POP, the 
      noise covering much of what she says.

                                  KIM (cont'd)
                    Alice, you gotta get over here, this 
                    thing s going bad.

      She sees the silver van trolling the street, looking for her. 

      THE FORD FOCUS DRIVER RETURNS; he starts to pull out, 
      threatening to expose her.

      Kim scuttles behind the car next to it; a parked Explorer. As 
      the Focus pulls out, it taps the Explorer s bumper, tripping 
    its alarm system.

                                  KIM (cont'd)
                    I m in trouble here --

      THE EXPLORER S HEADLIGHTS FLASH. ITS HORN STARTS HONKING. 

                                  KIM (cont'd)
                    Sus --

      The rest of her dialogue is covered by a burst of fireworks 
      and the car alarm. 

      The Explorer gets the attention of the silver van, which 
      races at her, blocking her from our sight.

      Her muffled scream covered by a bottle-rocket as the silver 
      van with her now in it breezes right past --

      -- leaving her CELL PHONE lying, smashed, in the gutter.

      A BLACK CHARGER -- 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)        NUMB3RS: 513/92 - "Trouble in..." - Rev. Yellow - 12/1/08    3. 

      CONTINUED: (2)11

      parks in front of the Silk Dragon. 

      COLBY and DAVID step out of the car, barely noticing the 
      HONKING Explorer, it s one loud street.  They head for the 
      only open restaurant, The Silk Dragon.

                                  DAVID
                    Looks alright.  

                                  COLBY 
                    Looks open is what it looks -- I m 
                    starving.  

      A celebrant runs by waving sparklers and an Ox head banner.

                                  DAVID
                    Year of the Ox.  Chinese New Years 
                    makes ours look a little boring.

      They enter the restaurant.

      INT. THE SILK DRAGON - NIGHT22

      The place is busy, not full. As David and Colby enter, HARVEY 
      YOON (50s) approaches them with menus.

                                  COLBY
                    We re just doing takeout.

                                  HARVEY YOON
                    Same menu. 

      They grab a nearby table and look at the menu. 

                                  DAVID
                    What do you think?

                                  COLBY
                    I m kinda torn between the Cha Shui  *
                    Bao, the Kung Pao San Yan, or Ma Poo 
                    curd with Leejee. 

                                  DAVID
                    I know, man, what the hell kinda menu 
                    is this, find me an egg roll.

                                  COLBY
                          (holds up the menu)
                    A least they give you pictures, just  *
                    point out what you want.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)        NUMB3RS: 513/92 - "Trouble in..." - Rev. Yellow - 12/1/08    4. 

      CONTINUED:22

                                  DAVID
                    Flaming pig s intestine? Like I 
                    needed a picture of that.

                                  COLBY
                    Yeah, that curd s looking a whole lot 
                    better.

      TWO ASIAN MEN WALK IN, long hair, furtive looks, bad guys 
      from the look of them. 

      The older of them, JIMMY LIM (40s), angrily approaches Harvey 
      Yoon at the cash register.  

                                  JIMMY LIM
                    Wo de no ren men ne?  Huan goi wo wo 
                    de no ren men!  (Where are my girls? 
                    I want my girls back!)

                                  HARVEY YOON
                    Wo bu zhodao to men zai nor.  (I 
                    don t know about your girls.)

                                  JIMMY LIM
                    Bie goi wo nei ge!  (Don t give me 
                    that!)

      The whole room s watching, especially David and Colby.

                                  HARVEY YOON
                    Ru guo nobu zou de hua, wo hui zhoo 
                    noma fan!  (I ll give you trouble if 
                    you don t get out of here now!) 
                          (re: the stalemate)
                    Hoo, wo goi jong cha do dian hua.  
                    (Okay, I m calling the police.)

      Harvey Yoon grabs the phone. 

      JIMMY LIM looks to the YOUNGER BAD GUY. Both reach into their 
      jacket, pull out machine pistols and spray the room.

      INSTANT CHAOS: HARVEY YOON is blown away.  Waiters and 
      customers, are wounded, the spray of bullets reaching --

      DAVID AND COLBY -- pull their table over and duck behind it, 
      as a burst of bullets strafes their position... 

      ... then leap up and empty their handguns. 

      THE TWO BAD GUYS go down, dying... make that dead.        NUMB3RS: 513/92 - "Trouble in..." - Rev. Yellow - 12/1/08    5. 



      INT.  THE SILK DRAGON - LATER33

      DON enters as Colby questions a wounded Waiter.

                                  COLBY
                    What were the shooters saying?

                                  WAITER
                    I don t really speak much Chinese, 
                    but it seemed like the leader guy was 
                    yelling,  Where s my girls, I want my 
                    girls back.  

      The younger bad guy s body is bagged.  David briefs Don.

                                  DAVID
                      6 wounded, 3 dead, counting the 
                    shooters.  Guns were FN P-90 machine 
                    pistols. These guys were planning a 
                    massacre.

                                  DON
                    Weird. My dad used to bring Charlie 
                    and me here when we were kids.  Real 
                    L.A. landmark.

      A cop calls Colby over to an older man in the background. 

                                  DAVID
                    Now it ll be a stop on the Death and 
                    Scandal tour.

      Colby leads in the old man, WALTER YOON, (60s).

                                  COLBY
                    This is Walter Yoon.  Says it s his 
                    brother s restaurant

      Walter Yoon ID s the dead restaurateur; sadly zen about it.

                                  WALTER YOON
                    That s my brother, Harvey.

                                  DON
                    Any idea what might have happened 
                    here?

                                  WALTER YOON
                    It s already all over Chinatown that 
                    the Jade Boys did this.  Maybe my 
                    brother didn t pay his protection 
                    money... 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        NUMB3RS: 513/92 - "Trouble in..." - Rev. Yellow - 12/1/08    6.

                                  COLBY
                    He s not going to pay it now...

      ICE agent, ALICE CHEN, 30s flashes her badge and walks  *
      briskly over to the group.

                                  CHEN
                    Alice Chen, Immigration Control. I ve 
                    got an emergency on my hands.

                                  DON
                    You and me both.

                                  CHEN
                    I think an agent of mine was just 
                    grabbed on this street. She was 
                    working undercover when she and two 
                    other women disappeared tonight --

      She notices the shooters  bodies. She crosses to Jimmy Lim.

                                  CHEN (cont d)
                    And he s my chief suspect.  

      INT. THE EPPES HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT44

      CHARLIE and AMITA finish a late dinner.

      The doorbell RINGS. Charlie looks at his watch, it s late. 
      Amita clears the dishes. 

      Charlie opens the door and finds his old nemesis, Simon 
      Kraft, holding some mail.

                                  SIMON KRAFT
                    Hello, Professor Eppes.  Remember me?

                      Professional reasons.

                                    CHARLIE
                    My brother doesn t live here, and I 
                    won t be giving you his phone number. 
                      Professional reasons.

                    When you do see him, please tell him 
                    to call me. 

      Charlie nods, shuts the door, but Simon stops it with his 
      foot. Then hands Charlie the envelopes.

                                        ACT ONE

      INT. FBI - WAR ROOM - DAY66

      Don, Colby, and NIKKI, are seated as Chen runs the room.  She 
      shows an ICE ID photo of Agent Kim Hsaio on the big screen.

                                  CHEN
                    The agent we re looking for is named 
                    Kim Hsaio.  She transferred to us 
                    from D.O.J. because she s Chinese-
                    fluent and...
                          (tinge of emotion)
                    Because I requested her.

      She shows two mug shots, the shooters from the Silk Dragon.

                                  CHEN (cont d)
                    Last night s shooters: That s Jimmy 
                    Lim on the left. He ran the Jade Boys 
                    gang with muscle from his cousin. 

      She shows a slide of a warehouse (the sweatshop.)

                                  CHEN (cont d)
                    Kim Hsaio was working undercover in 
                    Jimmy s sweatshop on Bernard Street. 
                    Till last night anyway. 

                                  COLBY
                    That waiter said Jimmy Lim was 
                    demanding his girls back from Harvey 
                    Yoon.  Was he talking about your 
                    missing agent?

                                  CHEN
                    It s possible. 

      On different screens she moves through a series of shots 
      showing Agent Hsaio walking with the two  van victims. 

                                  CHEN (cont d)
                      Department of Transportation cameras 
                    caught her all the way to Central 
                    Plaza, the restaurant s location. 
                    That s where DOT stops.

                                  NIKKI
                    And security cameras should kick in 
                    but on that corner of the plaza the 
                    cameras are all disabled.

                                  CHEN
                    She didn t have any.
                          (off the others)
                    We clocked her off at 9:15.  Next 
                    thing, I got this call.

      From a laptop she plays a RECORDING...

                                  CHEN
                    Maybe you can do something with it. 

                                  COLBY
                      Undercover ops like this, don t your

                                  CHEN
                    She had a beacon -- and she never 
                    turned it back in, so we re hopeful 
                    that she still has it.  
                          (beat)
                    Problem is it s only good for a mile 
                    or so. 

                                  NIKKI
                    What kind of beacon s that?

                                  CHEN 
                    We bust sweatshops every day, never 
                    had to fire a shot. 
                          (rueful)
                    In retrospect, we should ve been more 
                    careful.  We had a warning flag.

      INT. SWEATSHOP - BASEMENT - DAY1010

      Chen, Colby, David and an ICE agent move stealthily down a 
      staircase, through a maze of moodily lit basement rooms 
      filled with machinery, boxes and excess bolts of cloth. 

                                  COLBY
                    Two floors of sewing machines and 
                    nobody here.  If this is a sweatshop, 
                    where s the labor?

                                  DAVID
                    Maybe they re all down here taking a

                    FN P90s. Same as the restaurant.

      CLOSE ON a pile of large cloth rolls.  Colby and David 
      pullback the fabric -- find --

      THREE BODIES, MALE ASIANS (20s) beat up and shot up.

      They HEAR the SOUND of activity coming from around a corner 
      and see a glow of flame. They rush over and find:

      An arsonist at work. COLIN PANG (20s) has one blaze going and 
      is about to light another.  David jumps him as Colby attempts 
      to smother the flames with a piece of carpet, while Chen 
      finds an ancient fire extinguisher, which miraculously still 
      works.  They douse the flames.

                    And leave the camera. Shooting s not

      Simon walks to the mirrored glass, puts his face against it, 
      as if sensing Charlie on the other side.

      INT. FBI - BULLPEN - DAY1717

      Don sits watching the tape of Simon Kraft s infamous card-
      guessing sequence (from  Mind Games ).  Charlie passes 
      through on his way out, watches with Don for a beat.

                                  DON
                    What were Simon s chances of guessing 
                      twenty-five cards wrong?

                                    CHARLIE
                    The chance of that is less than one 
                    in a million.
                          (off Don s look)

                    He guessed.  He knew I was in there 
                    when we filmed his card trick.  Don, 
                    the guy s a fraud.  He handled our

                    I ll send Colby. 

1818EXT. ACCIDENT SITE - NIGHT      

      A small stakebed truck has jumped the curb, smashed into a 
      freeway retaining wall, its colorful contents spilled onto 
      the roadbed: festive bunting, Chinese New Year floats, a 
      gaudy cloth dragon (from the Teaser) among them. 

      The dead driver flops over the steering wheel.

      Colby joins Agent Chen talking to LAPD. Then, to Colby:

                                  CHEN
                    Seems LAPD was trying to pull him 
                    over for running a red.... it turned 
                    into a high-speed pursuit

                                  COLBY
                    Driver lost control in the turn.

                                  CHEN
                    Yeah, snapped his neck. 
                          (walks over to the float)
                    Come see what the dragon ate.

      Chen opens the dragon s belly seam revealing two of the 
      silver van victims from the teaser but now  glammed-up  in 
      makeup and long red dresses.  Call-girls  maybe, corpses 
      certainly.

1919INT. FBI - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 

      David and Chen question the arsonist, Colin Pang.

                                  DAVID
                    Two more sweatshop girls dead, Colin.  
                    What do you know about that?

                                  COLIN PANG
                    Nothing, man, nothing.

                                  CHEN
                    What about the sailos... the foot -
                    soldiers?  How come you re walking 
                    around and they aren t?

                                  COLIN PANG
                    I didn t kill those guys. They were 
                    my friends -- Jimmy did that!

                                  DAVID
                    Why would the boss kill his own gang?  

                                  COLIN PANG
                    He was mad because his girls kept 
                      disappearing. 

                                  CHEN
                     His  girls?  

                                  COLIN PANG
                    He s a snake-head. Smuggles  em in 
                    from China for thirty grand, then 
                    they pay him back at fifty cents a 
                    shirt.  Good business.

                                  DAVID
                    You re the last of the Jade Boys. 
                      Everybody s dead... except you.

                                  COLIN PANG
                    The night Jimmy went crazy... three 
                    more girls escaped and Jimmy said 
                    that s the last three. He tortured 
                    all of us.  Some of the gang broke 
                    down, admitted what they done. 
                          (off David s look)
                    They were selling Jimmy s girls to

                    buying up girls?

                                  COLIN PANG
                    Harvey was selling call girls. Jimmy s 
                    girls d catch a van at the Silk Dragon, 
                    head off to Vegas, wherever. 

                                  CHEN
                    So why were you trying to burn down 
                    the sweatshop with the girls inside?

      Pang thinks; he s got no answer. 

                                  DAVID
                    We ve got you on attempted murder and 
                    trying to torch evidence -- how much

                    the bullets that killed your buddies?

                          (nervous)
                    Okay -- Jimmy made me shoot some of 
                    the guys. To prove I wasn t stealing 
                    his girls and working with Yoon. 

                                  CHEN
                    But you were working with Yoon, 
                    weren t you? That s why you had to 
                    kill the women -- they knew it all.

      Colin s guilty face says it all.

                                  DAVID
                      Double-dipping Harvey Yoon and Jimmy

                    Harvey was only one face of 
                      Chinatown.  Five Emperors Cultural 
                    Center is another.  Let me show you 
                    around.

      INT. FIVE EMPERORS CULTURAL CENTER - CONTINUOUS2323

      Inside the facility, (guarded by TWO BEEFY SECURITY GUARDS), 
      they pass rooms full of YOUNG AND OLD PEOPLE participating in 
      crafts, Mah Jong, Tai Chi. 

                                  WALTER YOON
                    While the modern world wages its 
                    culture wars, we elders try to pass 
                    ours along. Or what s left of it.    
                    Our Cultural Center offers language 
                    class --
                          (walking past an old man 
                            stretching gracefully...)
                    Tai Chi, most ancient of disciplines.
                          (....and past people 
                            playing --)
                    Mahjong. Some say the game goes back 
                    to Confucius. 

      They pause near THE MISSING WOMEN BOARD.  Each sad Asian face 
      captioned with a birthdate and a short physical description 
      and the words,  Have you seen her?  Nikki notices --

      A tragic OLDER COUPLE as they study the missing. The couple 
      look suspiciously at Nikki before they remove a poster of a 
      girl. They sorrowfully hand it to Yoon who nods with 
      understanding. The couple leave, hand in hand. 

                                  WALTER YOON (cont d)
                    They found her. 

                                  NIKKI
                    Why don t these parents go to the 
                    police?

                                  WALTER YOON
                    And be arrested?  Most are 
                      undocumented.

                    As a practical matter, we ve got two 
                    million illegal Chinese in California 
                    alone. Hard to track the missing ones 
                    when the police don t even know they 
                    exist. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 513/92 - "Trouble in..." - Rev. Yellow - 12/1/08    28.

                    And as a moral matter, many of these 
                    girls were charged $30,000 by a 
                    smuggler just to get here. They d 
                    rather be chained to a pimp or a 
                    sewing machine than be deported. My 
                    own mother was a sweatshop slave. 

      As they walk past all those missing women...

      Don drives, Colby next to him, the beacon locator between 
      them. Simon Kraft sits in the back seat like a bored child.

                    Standard FBI search procedure. I d 
                    think a psychic would know that.

                    I d think the FBI would have moved on 
                    since J. Edgar Hoover.

      Don almost rises to the insult, then backs away.

                    If we get within a mile of Hsaio we

                    What can I say, Don? I m a hugger.

      Suddenly, Simon jerks spasmodically, pressing his face

      The follow car pulls in. SWAT leaps out. 

      Simon ambles behind, watching impassively as --

      Don fishes around with his beacon locator. Suddenly the

                    We got something, guys!

      The beacon draws them to a certain spot: a new grave with a

      A hand, then an arm, then the rest of Agent Hsaio, her body 
      placed on top of the resident casket.  Colby feels her pulse.

                    She must have caught an air pocket, 
                    she s alive -- 

      They finish pulling her out and notice her facial make-up, 
      coiffed hair, and new red dress.

                                  DON
                    Get her to the hospital --

      Two SWAT guys carry Agent Hsaio away to their car.

                    The man was buried Tuesday.  We re in

                    he s Chinese.  Or was.

                    I filed a report. My security guy 
                    chased some people away from another

3131INT. CORONER S OFFICE - DAY 

      Nikki and Chen with three dead Kewpie-doll women all in a 
      row.  Two red dresses are in clear plastic evidence bags.  
      The Coroner finishes cutting off the dress from the last 
      victim.

                                    CORONER
                    How many women were found like this? 

                                  CHEN
                    Four so far.  What are you thinking?

                                    CORONER
                    Those two were injected with some 
                    form of paralyzing agent. I m good 
                    with poisons but I had to send this 
                    one out to the lab.  Resembles a 
                    shellfish toxin.  Conotoxin.

      Nikki puts on gloves, picks up an evidence bag.  The coroner 
      hands the cut dress to Nikki.

                                  NIKKI
                    Death by shellfish?

                                    CORONER
                    It s a good guess.

      CLOSE ON the eye of one victim, garishly made-up.

                                    CORONER (cont d)
                    Look at this -- the mascara was 
                    applied thick and fast. See where 
                    some got in her eye?  Normally, that 
                    would cause tearing, the mascara 
                    would run. There s no smudge here.

                                  CHEN
                    Which tells you?

                                    CORONER
                    The victims were paralyzed or dead

                    They all sum to nine. Harvey Yoon, 
                    what were you up to? Some kind of

                                  AMITA
                    My intuition tells me there s 
                    something to this graphic, I just 
                    don t know what. Maybe a hidden 
                    pattern in the squares?

                          (tries some keys)
                    Like a dragon hiding in its lair.
                    Seems Yoon had a thing for numbers 8 
                    and 9.

                                  AMITA
                    I ve tried every number, and every 
                      combination of number. 

      She humors him and hits 8 on the keyboard. Nothing happens.

                                  LARRY
                    How about  control  8? 

      As if humoring a child she hits it... nothing happens. 

                                  AMITA
                    Here s  option  8 and  command  8.

      Nothing. Larry henpecks the 8 key.

                    Gotcha.

      HE ZOOMS IN ON THE VICTIM S FACE --

      THEN ZOOMS OUT in time to see the van pull back, straighten 
      out, gather speed and drive right at him.

                    from the Missing Persons board and

                                  DON
                    So what do we think about Simon 
                    Kraft?

                                  LARRY
                    That s a life that ends in a question 
                    mark.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 513/92 - "Trouble in..." - Rev. Yellow - 12/1/08    55.

                                    CHARLIE
                    The question being why does the human 
                    condition require a Simon Kraft?  
                    Watch the news-- Bigfoot, the Loch 
                    Ness monster.  Nothing on the great 
                    apes or blue whales, real marvels.  

                                  LARRY
                    I remind us, remote viewing and 
                    psychic warfare was the brainchild of 
                    respected researchers at Stanford.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I will fall on my slide rule if 
                    anyone can give me proof of Simon s 
                      extra-sensory abilities.

                                  LARRY
                    What inner power, do you suppose, led 
                    Simon to find the killer s van 
                    precisely at the moment of kidnap?

                                    CHARLIE
                    You mean the power that failed to 
                    warn him he was going to get run over 
                    by the van? 
                          (to Don)
                    Help me out here...

                                  DON
                    Sorry... you re going to have to move 
                    me into the  undecided  column on 
                    this one.

                                  AMITA
                    I m going to read my book in peace.

      She leaves, up the stairs, as --

                                  LARRY
                    Consider -- When Magellan landed on 
                    Tierra del Fuego, an isolated island, 
                    the villagers greeted him but mostly 
                    stared at the horizon. Having no 
                    concept of a ship larger than a 
                    canoe, they somehow couldn t see five 
                    galleons anchored in plain sight. A 
                    flotilla of ships were literally 
                    invisible to their disbelieving eyes.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 513/92 - "Trouble in..." - Rev. Yellow - 12/1/08    56.

                                    CHARLIE
                    You illustrate my point. The ignorant 
                    couldn t see the plain truth in front 
                    of them. Or -- maybe an ocean fog 
                    concealed the ships. 

                                  LARRY
                    I can see the fog s rolled in 
                    alright. Good night, Charles. Don.

      Larry exits through the kitchen.

                                    CHARLIE
                          (regrets his earlier tone)
                    Good night, Lawrence. 

                                   DON
                    I m picking Dad up at the airport, 
                    want to come?

      Charlie nods, grabs his jacket.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Larry looks up at the universe and 
                    asks why. You take your doubts to the 
                    temple. 
                          (beat)
                    I don t know... maybe it s okay, 
                    living without all the answers.

                                  DON
                    I ll let you know... when I get some 
                    answers.

      The brothers go out the door together.
