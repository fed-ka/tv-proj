      Rowdy bundles up, getting dressed for the cold.  He glances 
      over at a photo on his dresser.  

      GRADY, his wife, and his two sons in happier days.  In the 
      picture, Grady is just north of 40 years old, thick around 
    the middle from a cushy corporate gig but with a face that 
    has the peculiar tightness of expensive plastic surgery.

      There s a soft knock on Rowdy s door, and ELENA EDLUND steps 
    in.  Grady s wife from the picture.

      Late 30s.Striking, but she dresses down to de-emphasize how 
      good looking she is.  Understated in every way.  She s got an 
      easy smile, but sad eyes.

                                  ROWDY
                    Your son just put me on notice.  
                    Looks like I m heading out there.

                                  ELENA
                    Storm s bad.

    He can see how scared she is.  He puts his hand on her 
      shoulder, but even that little bit of physical contact 
      between them is too much, too intimate.  He backs off, puts 
    on a forced smile.

                                  ROWDY
                    Been bad for days.  That s the 
                    problem.  Grady s got half our herd 
                    with him.  He may own this land, 
                    but he doesn t spend the time here 
                    that I do.  He s not a rider.

                                  ELENA
                    You mean he s not a rider like you?
                          (gesturesat Rowdy s leg)

                                  ROWDY
                    Your husband s late.  More than a 
                    week late.
                          (beat)
                    When we were little, me and him 
                    used to play cowboy all the time.  
                    He thinks that just cause he owns 
                    this spread, he s a real cowboy.  
                    But he ain t.  I am.  Grady s still 
                    just playin .And in these parts 
                    that llget you killed.                                                                                    4.



                                  ELENA
                    I know.  I m worried.  But part of 
                    me thinks that... GRADY!

                                  ROWDY
                    Thinks that Grady s what?

                                  ELENA
                    No... he s there!

    She points out the window.  Rowdy turns and looks and sees a 
      figure staggering across the ranch yard, moving slowly.


      Rowdy and Elena stand side-by-side in the hallway outside 
      Grady s bedroom.

      Down the hall, Derek and Tim sit at the top of the stairs, 
    far enough away that Rowdy and Elena can t hear them as they 
      speak to each other in low, hushed tones.

                                  TIM
                    Dad s okay, right?

                                  DEREK
                    Don t be stupid, stupid.Doc s 
                    been in there an hour.

    Tim tries not to cry, turns away so that Derek can t see him.  
      Derek s frustrated with his brother, but he tries to hold 
      back his temper.

                                  DEREK
                    I know you don t understand the way 
                    things are.  Ain t your fault.  But 
                    this is serious, Tim.  You gotta be 
                    ready for whatever happens.  Might 
                    not be good.

                                  TIM
                    Is he... is he gonna die?

      Derek watches as Rowdy puts his arm around Elena and pulls 
    her close so she can cry on his shoulder.  Doesn t like that 
    one little bit.

                                  DEREK
                    I don t know.

    The bedroom door opens and DOC MORGAN steps out.  Little man 
    in his 60s.Looks like he was woken up to come up here, and 
      like he can t believe what he saw.

      Derek cranes his head so he can see past Doc Morgan.

      Grady lies on his own bed.  The sheet s thrown back so Tim 
    can see most of Grady s body.  Thin enough to see his ribs  
      under the too-white skin.

    As Derek stares, Grady suddenly turns his head, so he can 
      look all the way down the hall, directly at his son.

      Derek jerks back, as if burnt, as Doc Morgan closes the door.                                                                                    6.



                                  ROWDY
                    How is he?

                                  DOC MORGAN
                    Alive.  Which seems like a small 
                    miracle, if you ask me.  How long 
                    did you say he was missing?

                                  ROWDY
                    Ten days.

                                  DOC MORGAN
                    And he s the only one who came 
                    back?

                                  ROWDY
                    Right.
                          (beat)
                    How do you suppose he survived all 
                    this time?

                                  DOC MORGAN
                    He must have found something to eat 
                    out there.  What I have no idea.

                                  ELENA
                    Doc... will he be okay?

                                  DOC MORGAN
                    I don t see why not.  As long as 
                    you keep him hydrated and let him 
                    rest.  He should come back around 
                    to his old self in no time.

      Elena seems relieved, barely able to believe the news.

                                  ELENA
                    Did he say anything?

                                  DOC MORGAN
                    Yes he did.  He said he s hungry.


      Elena finishes up the soup she s cooking.  Sets a plate, with 
      soft fresh-baked bread and butter on the side, then dishes up 
    the soup.  Puts it on a tray.

    And the whole time, she s brushing off tears.

      Rowdy walks in, pushing Derek in front of him.                                                                                    7.



                                  ROWDY
                    Here you go, Mom.  Derek would love 
                    to carry that tray up to his dad.

                                  ELENA
                    Is that so?

      Rowdy puts his hand on Derek s shoulder.  Just that pressure 
    is enough to make Derek wince.

                                  DEREK
                    Yes, mom, I d love to.

                                  ROWDY
                    Look at that.

      Derek takes the tray from his mother and heads upstairs.

      Once he s gone, Elena steps into Rowdy s embrace, buries her 
      face in his chest, and just lets go:  all the tears, all the 
      tension, everything out at once.

                                  ELENA
                    Doesn t even look like himself.  
                    His eyes.  Something s not right.  
                    It s like he s... somebody else.

                                  ROWDY
                    He s just been through a lot.  
                    That s all.

                                  ELENA
                    God, if he wasn t so fragile right 
                    now, I d go up there and I d 
                    strangle the life out of him.

                                  ROWDY
                    However mad you are, just 
                      remember... he s paying for it.  
                    And I m probably just as mad at him 
                    as you are... but until he s up and 
                    around, all that has to be back-
                    burnered.

      There s a loud THUMP and a CRASH from upstairs.

                                  DEREK
                          (upstairs)
                    Dammit!                                                                                    8.




      Elena steps into the room.  Derek kneels on the floor, trying 
    to clean up the soup his mother made, the entire tray 
      spilled.  Grady lies in bed, unmoving.

                                  ELENA
                    What did you do?

                                  DEREK
                    I didn t.  He did.

                                  ELENA
                    Your father s very sick.  You have 
                    to help with these things.  You 
                    can t just...

      Derek stands up, immediately furious.

                                  DEREK
                    He knocked the tray out of my hand!  
                    On purpose!

    He pushes past her so he can storm out.  She grabs for him, 
    but Derek sidesteps her and leaves.

    She turns back to look at Grady, who still hasn t moved.  His 
      eyes aren t even open.  In fact, until she gets closer, she 
      can t even see his chest moving, and he looks dead.

    She feels his forehead.  Feels his cheeks.  She s disturbed 
    by the texture of his skin, by his color.

    She reaches past him to adjust his pillow.

    His eyes flutter slightly, open just a bit.  Grady sniffs the 
      air, once, twice.

    She doesn t notice that his eyes are open.

    He opens his mouth, very slightly.  His awful black tongue 
      pokes out, like an independent living thing --

    -- and he licks the underside of her arm!

    She flinches away, instantly creepedout, and takes a step 
      back from the edge of the bed.

                                  ELENA
                      G-Grady?Baby, are you awake?

                                  GRADY
                    ... you...                                                                                    9.



      He s so soft that Elena instinctively steps closer again, 
      leaning in close so she can hear him.

                                  ELENA
                    What is it?  What can I get you?

                                  GRADY
                    ... taste good...

    She shudders, but Grady s eyes are already closed again.  
      He s either asleep or too worn out to keep the eyes open.


      A heavy knock on the front door.

      Derek and Tim appear at the top of the stairs.  Rowdy pushes 
      past them, checking his watch.

    He stomps down the steps, leg hurting him with each step.  He 
      pauses before he opens the door, looks back up the stairs.

                                  ROWDY
                    You two.  Go to bed.

    He waits until they duck back out of sight, then opens the 
      door.  The figure we saw in the yard stands in the doorway, 
      filling it almost completely.

      Rowdy takes a step back, and EDDIE BEAR steps in.  A huge 
      slab of a guy, older, in his 60s, but in incredible shape.


      Eddie follows Rowdy down this dark hall.

                                  ROWDY
                    If I hadn t broken my damn leg, he 
                    never would have volunteered to 
                    handle the cattle drive.  What does 
                    he know about cattle?  He may own 
                    this place, but he never actually 
                    visits.  You know how hard it can 
                    be in the mountains.  And he goes 
                    out playing cowboy like a jerk.

    At the end of the hall, Rowdy opens the door, stopping to let 
      Eddie walk past him.                                                                                    10.




      Elena sits in a chair in the furthest corner of the room from 
    her husband.  Shawl in her lap, knitting in her hands.  
      Asleep, exhausted, passed out at this point.

      Grady s wide awake.  Eyes open.  Unmoving in his bed.

      Eddie stands on the threshold of the room.  Looks in at 
      Elena.  Looks in at Grady.  Grady s eyes roll around and fix 
    on Eddie.  When he moves, Grady s eyes follow.  Locked on.

      Eddie walks across the room to where Elena is asleep, and he 
      puts one hand gently on her shoulder.

    She jerks back from Eddie s hand, then realizes where she is.

                                  EDDIE
                    How is he?

                                  ELENA
                    He won t eat.  Can you help him?

                                  EDDIE
                    Hope so.

      They both look over at Grady.  His eyes still locked on Eddie 
      Bear.  With his mouth hanging open, thick ropy drool on his 
      cheek, it almost looks like Grady s smiling.

                                  EDDIE
                    Do me a favor.  Wait downstairs.

    He doesn t offer any explanation.  Rowdy helps Elena up.  
      Eddie waits for both of them to leave, waits for the door to 
      close.  Only then does he turn to look at Grady again.

      Grady stares back at him.  Ready.

                                  EDDIE
                    What do you got t sayfor yourself?

      Grady s voice is much stronger than it was when he was trying 
    to talk to his wife.  Firm.  Surprisingly solid.

                                  GRADY
                    You re scared.

                                  EDDIE
                    Maybe.  Should I be?                                                                                    11.



    He walks closer to Grady s bed.  Grady doesn t answer.  Just 
      watches him, and now he really does seem to be smiling.  But 
      it s a flat, mirthless smile, almost a twitch.

      Eddie looks down at Grady.  He can see how every vein shows 
      through his almost translucent skin, how he seems to be 
      drying out.

                                  EDDIE
                    When I was a boy... six years old 
                    or so... my family lived on the 
                    res... and one of my uncles, he got 
                    lost in the mountains during a 
                    flash snowfall.  They sent out a 
                    search party or two, but a missing 
                    Indian wan tno big thing to the 
                    sheriff s office.  Just wrote him 
                    off.  When he did show up, it was 
                    weeks gone by.  He didn t look 
                    right.  Not at all.

                                  GRADY
                    How did he look?

                                  EDDIE
                    He looked... like you.

                                  GRADY
                    You don t look much different 
                    yourself, Eddie Bear.  At least 
                    tonight you managed to walk inside 
                    the room.  That night in 1942, you 
                    stood outside the door.  Nobody 
                    could get you to step one foot 
                    inside.  Afraid.

                                  EDDIE
                    Yeah, well... I was a kid.

                                  GRADY
                    You look just the same right now.

                                  EDDIE
                    I ain t scared of you no more.

      Grady sits up.  One motion.  His legs flung around off the 
      side of the bed, sitting inches from Eddie.  To Eddie s great 
      credit, he doesn t move.

                                  GRADY
                    You were.

      Grady pushes himself into a stand.                                                                                    12.



                                  GRADY
                    You will be.

    And now, standing, it s obvious that something s gone even 
      more wrong.  Grady s thinner.  His fingers longer.  And pale.

      Eddie reaches down to his belt, and quickly slides his knife 
    out of its sheath.

    He holds it down, by his side, so Grady can see it.  This is 
    one big-ass knife.  This is a knife you use if you feel like 
      fighting a bear.  Eddie doesn t even gesture with it.

                                  EDDIE
                    How  bout you sit yourself back 
                    down?  Two of us keep talking.  
                    Cause that s all this is right 
                    now... two of us talking.

      Grady stands there for a moment, swaying a bit.  Just long 
      enough to let Eddie know that he s thinking about it.  

      Then sits back down.

                                  EDDIE
                    Glad to see you re feeling better.

                                  GRADY
                    Oh, I ll bet you are.

                                  EDDIE
                    If you re feeling well enough to 
                    get out of bed, then you won t mind 
                    when I tell Rowdy that I quit.  
                    You ll get along fine without me.

                                  GRADY
                    You a quitter, Eddie?

                                  EDDIE
                    I m old as hell.  That ain t no 
                    accident.  I ll quit.  I ll run.  
                    I ll tuck tail.  Whatever you call 
                    it.  But if you are what I think 
                    you are... I don t want to be here.

                                  GRADY
                    Then go.  You re just a broken-down 
                    drunken no-account injun, anyway.  
                    Ain t like you re gonna be missed.

      Eddie backs away.  Finally tucks the knife back into the 
      sheath around the time he reaches the door.                                                                                    13.



                                  EDDIE
                    You re gonna have to eat.

      Grady lays back into his bed, settles in.

                                  GRADY
                    Soon.


      Rowdy and Elena sit at the table, waiting, lost in thought.

      They both look up as Eddie steps in, expectant.

                                  ROWDY
                    Can you help him?

                                  EDDIE
                    Nope.  Don t think no one can.

      Eddie heads for the door.

                                  ELENA
                    At least tell me if he ll eat.

      Eddie pauses at the door, horrified by the question.

                                  EDDIE
                    Yeah.  I d say that s a sure thing.


    The boys lay in their beds.  Awake.

      There s a sound.  Something low and distant.  Some sort of 
      baying, a separate sound being carried on the wind.

      Derek sits up, almost challenging the window, daring 
      something to happen.

      Tim, though, keeps his head under his pillow.  He s crying 
      softly.  The last few days are taking their toll.


      Rowdy lays on his bed, but the covers are still made, and 
      Rowdy s still fully dressed.

    He looks at his own window, at the night outside.  There s 
      that sound again.  And finally it becomes obvious what we re 
      hearing --

    -- cattle, crying out in pain!                                                                                    14.




      Eddie Bear stands up and crosses to his double-wide windows.  
      Wipes away what frost and condensation he can, and peers out 
      into the night.

    The cattle sounds are so loud here it s almost like they re 
      right at the door.  Just outside.  

      Eddie can t see anything, though.

    He looks again.  Catches a glimpse of someone out there, 
      backlit for a moment by the main house.

    And then it s gone.  Lost in the darkness again.

                                                                    SHOCK CUT TO:


      Rowdy stands by the window, on the phone.  He can see the 
      dead cow from here.

                                  ROWDY
                    I m tellin you somebody came on to 
                    our property and slaughtered one of 
                    our cattle.  Last night.  For no 
                    damn reason.
                          (beat)
                    I don t know who.  That s why I m 
                      callin you.  Why don t you come 
                    out here and look for yourself?  Do 
                    a little investigating?
                          (beat)
                    Maybe Thursday, huh?

      Rowdy listens, trying not to loose his temper.

                                  ROWDY
                    Uh-hu.Right.  Thanks...
                          (hangs up; sighs)
                    ... for nothing.

      Rowdy turns away from the window and finds Derek in the 
      doorway to the room, listening to his conversation.

                                  ROWDY
                    Hey, Derek... you hear anything 
                    last night?

                                  DEREK
                    Last night?  No.  But I ve heard 
                    plenty on other nights.

                                  ROWDY
                    ... what?

                                  DEREK
                    Never mind, you dumb sumbitch...

      Derek turns and storms out.  Exasperated, Rowdy follows.


      Rowdy sits across a card table from Eddie Bear.  They both 
      drink coffee, using the mugs to warm their hands.

                                  ROWDY
                    ... thinkin maybe I ll hire a few 
                    new guys for a month.  Finish up 
                    what s left of the herd.

                                  EDDIE
                          (barks a laugh)
                    You cain thire nobody right now.

                                  ROWDY
                    Well, you re quitting, and we still 
                    got livestock needs looking after.

                                  EDDIE
                    And you still got that thing 
                    sitting upstairs in your house.

                                  ROWDY
                    That thing is my brother.

                                  EDDIE
                    Yeah, well... that s debatable.

      Eddie stops what he s doing and looks over at Rowdy, and for 
    the first time, Eddie seems like an old man.  Frail.  Afraid.

                                  EDDIE
                    Where do you think everyone else 
                    is?  The cattle?  The horses?  
                    Chuck and Jasper and Billy J?You 
                    think they re all still out there? 
                    Just wanderin around?  And what 
                    about that cow in the yard?  You 
                    think it died of natural causes?

                                  ROWDY
                    I don t know what happened to that 
                    cow.  And I ain t about to jump to 
                    conclusions.

                                  EDDIE
                    Grady survived ten days in them 
                    mountains.  And he s the only one 
                    came back.  Now, how is that?                                                                                      18.



                                  ROWDY
                      Doyouhonestly expect me to 
                    believe that my brother, who almost 
                    died, and hasn tthe strength to 
                    even get out of bed,killed a cow 
                    in the middle of the night with his
                    bare hands?

                                  EDDIE
                    A cow ain t the only thing he s 
                    killed.  And he s whole lot 
                    stronger than you think.


      Elena moves around the room, cleaning up, gathering dirty 
      clothes and empty dishes.  Careful, she stays far enough away 
      from the bed so that Grady can t grab her unexpectedly.

      Grady s wrapped in more than one blanket.  Shivering through 
      them, even though he s sweating.

      Grady opens his eyes.  He seems different, though.  When he 
      speaks, his voice is a hoarse croak.

                                  GRADY
                    ... baby?

      Elena turns and looks at him, and when she sees the way he s 
      looking at her, tears spring to her eyes.

                                  ELENA
                    Grady?

    She gets closer, and now she s sure:  it s Grady.

                                  GRADY
                    Where am I?  What happened?

                                  ELENA
                    You re home.  And... I don t know 
                    what happened.  You ll have to tell 
                    us.  What s the last thing you 
                    remember before waking up here?

      Grady has to really think about it.

                                  GRADY
                    We got lost.  Turned all around.  
                    Had to hole up in a shallow cave to 
                    stay warm.  I remember...

      Grady twitches, the memory just below the surface.                                                                                    19.



                                  GRADY
                    There was more and more wind... and 
                    soon I couldn t even keep the fire 
                    lit.  I had to eat... I had to...

      Grady shakes his head, trying to clear it.

                                  GRADY
                    ... and then... I don t know.  I 
                      remember... a voice.  At my ear... 
                    and in my head... all I wanted to 
                    do is sleep, but the voice kept 
                    telling me not to.   You have to 
                    get up.  You have to keep moving.   
                    And I knew that if I went to sleep, 
                    I d die up there.   I ll save you,  
                    the voice said.   Just get up.  Let 
                    me in, and I ll help you.  I ll get 
                    you off this mountain. 

                                  ELENA
                    ...  let me in ?


                                  EDDIE
                    You ever hear of The Wendigo?

                                  ROWDY
                    Sounds familiar.

                                  EDDIE
                    The spirit of the lonely places.  A 
                    hateful thing that lives in the 
                    cold winds of the high mountains.  
                    It gets inside people when they re 
                    weak, starving.  Once it gets 
                    inside a man... that s it. 

                                  ROWDY
                    What the hell are you taking about?  

                                  EDDIE
                    I ve seen this before.  When I was 
                    a kid.  My uncle.  And the longer 
                    he stayed alive, the worse his 
                    hunger got.  Eventually, goats and 
                    sheep weren t enough for him.  
                    People went missing.  We all knew.  
                    We just pretended not to.                                                                                    20.



                                  ROWDY
                    But you don t really believe your 
                    uncle had a ghost inside of him.

                                  EDDIE
                    Not a ghost.  Not exactly.  I know 
                    there are some people who think 
                    that the Wendigo is just something 
                    the Cree made up to explain the 
                    rare but not unheard of examples of 
                      cannibalism that happened during 
                    the longer winters.

                                  ROWDY
                    But you don t think so.

                                  EDDIE
                    It s real.  And no matter how much 
                    it eats, it always wants more.  The 
                    more it eats, the stronger it gets.  
                    By the time my father and the 
                    elders tried to cast the Wendigo 
                    out, it was strong... so strong.  I 
                    didn t go into the room with them.  
                    I was too afraid.  I was just a 
                    kid.  But I could hear it.  Through 
                    the walls...
                          (shakes his head)
                    Once the Wendigo is in you, your 
                    body is no longer your own.  Your 
                    hunger can t be stopped or 
                      controlled.  Except by death.


      Elena crosses to the door, opens it.

                                  ELENA
                    Rowdy! Come up here! Grady s awake!

    She turns back --

    -- and is startled to find Grady standing, wide awake, eyes 
      fixed on her, no more than a foot away from her.

    He holds the blankets wrapped tightly around himself.

    And she knows.  Right away.  

      This.  Isn t.  Grady.                                                                                    21.




    She backs out of the room, slowly, making sure she doesn t 
      turn her back on him, down the hallway, slowly, surely.

      Grady emerges from the room, walking slowly.

                                  ELENA
                    Just lay down, honey.  I ll call 
                    Doc Morgan...

                                  GRADY
                    Don t need a doctor.  I feel fine.

      Grady pulls one arm out from under the blankets that he holds 
      around himself, and as he walks, he reaches out, drags his 
      hand along the wall.  His nails leave deep furrows in the 
      wallpaper.

                                  ELENA
                    Please, baby... go back to bed.

    He reaches out and grabs her by the throat.  His face mere 
      inches from hers, she can see that his lips are cracked, 
      rotten, like he s starting to decay.  He opens his mouth, 
      revealing an awful black tongue.

      SH-SHOOOOK!There s the unmistakable sound from behind Elena 
    of a shotgun being pumped, the shell being chambered.

    She looks behind her.  Rowdy stands at the top of the stairs, 
      shotgun in his hands.

                                  ROWDY
                    Let her go.

      Grady snaps his jaws shut.  Once.  Twice.  Testing them.

                                  GRADY
                    Or what?

      Rowdy shakes his head.  Doesn t want this to happen.

                                  ROWDY
                    Don t make me answer that question.

      Grady lets go of Elena.  She runs, gets behind Rowdy.  

                                  ROWDY
                    Please.  Go to bed, brother.                                                                                    22.



      Grady lets out a noise, part bellow, part scream.  It s not 
      human, and both Rowdy and Elena step back, bracing themselves 
    for what he might do.

      Grady turns and heads back into his room, slamming the door 
      behind him.  There s another one of those screams, the sounds 
    of furniture being thrown around the room in fury.


      Eddie Bear sits on his bed.  He can hear the sounds of 
      Grady s tantrum all the way out here.  

      After a moment, as the sounds show no sign of decreasing, 
      Eddie stands up and crosses to his footlocker.  He reaches in 
    and takes out a huge sharp work hatchet.


      Rowdy and Elena hurry down the stairs.  They back into this 
      room and get far away from the door.  Rowdy keeps the gun 
      close and ready.  Just in case.

      Elena s shaking, woozy.  She can t believe what just 
      happened.  Rowdy holds her arm to keep her from collapsing.

                                  ROWDY
                    You okay?

                                  ELENA
                    His mouth... and that sound...

                                  ROWDY
                    Answer me.  Are you okay?

                                  ELENA
                    Yes... I... I think so.

                                  ROWDY
                    Where are the boys?

      There s another crash from upstairs.  More of Grady s crazy 
      screaming.  The sound of splintering wood.

                                  ELENA
                          (dawning horror)
                    Oh, god...


                                      END ACT TWO                                                                                    23.


                                      ACT THREE


    Tim lays curled into a ball, all the way up against the wall, 
    in his bed.

    The sounds from Grady s bedroom are awful, louder here.  
      Animal and insane.

                                  TIM
                    ... makehimstoppleasemakehimstop...

      Derek tries to get Tim up, but Tim doesn t want to move.

                                  DEREK
                    Tim, we need to go.  Come on.


      Rowdy and Elena both jump as the front door SLAMS open --

    -- and Eddie Bear steps in, hatchet in hand.


      Derek s drags Tim off the bed by the back of his shirt.

    Tim has no choice but to start moving on his own, just to 
      keep the shirt from choking him.

      Derek keeps his firm hold, though, pulling Tim toward the 
      door, then kicking it open --


    -- and toward the front stairs, keeping an eye on the door at 
    the end of the hall, Grady s room, where the crazy awful 
      sounds continue unabated.

      Just before they reach the front stairs, the door to Grady s 
      room begins to open.

      Derek pours on the speed, pushing his brother ahead of him 
      toward the stairs, Tim yelling the whole way --


    -- and then down, the two of them practically losing their 
      footing as they stumble-slide down the front stairs.

      They stop when they see Rowdy and Elena together.

    And then they see Eddie Bear.  And his hatchet.                                                                                    24.



    And for a moment, no one knows what to say.

      Then Grady bellows in the upstairs hallway, much closer than 
    his room, and he still sounds furious, out of control.

                                  ROWDY
                    What s on your mind, Eddie?

      Eddie tests the weight of the hatchet in his hand, looks 
      upstairs toward the sounds of screaming.

                                  EDDIE
                    You know it s gotta be done.

    The sounds above them suddenly stop.  Completely.  There s 
      nothing from upstairs at all.  Almost like Grady s listening 
    to them.

                                  EDDIE
                    Get out of here.  All of you.

                                  ROWDY
                    We re not leaving you alone in the 
                    house with him.

                                  EDDIE
                    Yes, you are.  That s exactly what 
                    you re going to do.

      That s good enough for Elena.  She reaches out and takes Tim 
    by the hand, steers him toward the door.

                                  ELENA
                    Derek... come on...

      Derek hesitates, then relents.  Follows his mother and Tim.

      Rowdy and Eddie stand together.  Still silence from upstairs.

                                  EDDIE
                    You, too.

                                  ROWDY
                    I m not going to ask you to handle 
                    this by yourself.  He s my brother.

                                  EDDIE
                    That s why you ve gotta go.  Look, 
                    if I screw this up, you re going to 
                    have to kill him.  But that should 
                    be our last resort.                                                                                    25.



                                  ROWDY
                    I don t like this.  Any of it.

                                  EDDIE
                    Me, neither.


    The hallway s empty.  Every door stands open.

      Except for Grady s.  Closed again.

      Eddie walks directly down the hall.  Doesn t even glance in 
    the other rooms.  Goes straight for that closed door.


      Eddie pushes the door all the way open.  Grady s not in his 
      bed.  He doesn t appear to be in the room at all.

      Eddie turns to go --

    -- and Grady lunges out of the hallway from behind him!

      Grady grabs Eddie, lifts him, throws him across the room hard 
      enough to crack the paneling on the wall.

      Eddie lifts the hatchet, tries to push himself to his feet.

      Grady lashes out with enough force to whip Eddie s head 
      around, smash him into the wall.

      Eddie slams the hatchet down on Grady s foot.

    On Grady s cry of fury and pain --

                                                                    SHOCK CUT TO:


      Derek sits by the window, like he s on guard.  Watches the 
      main house.

      Elena sits on one of the beds, trying to console Tim.

      Rowdy checks his watch for what must be the thousandth time.                                                                                    26.



                                  ROWDY
                    Enough of this.  I m not sitting 
                    here waiting.  If Eddie s not back, 
                    he s not coming back.  It s been 
                    two hours.

      Rowdy walks over and holds out the shotgun for Derek.

                                  ROWDY
                    Take it.

                                  DEREK
                    I ain t gonna kill my father if 
                    that s what...

                                  ROWDY
                    You love your mom and your brother?

                                  DEREK
                    Of course.

                                  ROWDY
                    Then shut up and take it.  If I 
                    don t come back you need to protect 
                    them.  Take it.

      Derek finally reaches up and takes the weapon.

                                  ELENA
                    Rowdy, if you re going up there 
                    you ll need that gun.

                                  ROWDY
                    I ll get another out of the rack.

    Tim looks up at Rowdy, and he can see that this poor kid s 
      just barely hanging on in there.

                                  TIM
                    Don t hurt him.  Please.  He s not 
                    bad.  He s just... sick.

      Rowdy runs his hand through Tim s hair, like a father would 
    to his son, then turns and walks out.


    The front door stands open.  Just an inch.

      Rowdy pushes it the rest of the way open, steps inside.  
      Stops.  Listens.

    He crosses to a phone on a small table in the foyer, picks it 
    up, tries it.  No dial tone.  Rowdy s not surprised.  


      Rowdy walks across the room to the gun rack.  Takes his keys 
      out, unlocks the rack, and takes out a high-caliber rifle.

    He hears a sound from upstairs.  Freezes.

      Listens closer.  Hears it again.  A scratching, flopping 
      something.  Rowdy heads into the hall, upstairs, gun up --


    -- and steps off the top step into the upstairs hallway, 
      rifle up, ready to fire.

      Stops, horrified, at the sight of Eddie, on the floor in a 
      wide puddle of blood, struggling like a fish drawing its 
      dying breaths.

      Rowdy bends down next to him.  Sets the rifle aside.

    He tries to stem the flow of blood from Eddie s wounds, but 
      it s too late, and they re too deep.

      Eddie tries to say something, tries to catch his breath.  
      Rowdy leans in closer.                                                                                    28.



                                  EDDIE
                    ... shouldn t... have... tried...

    For a moment, Eddie almost seems to focus, like he can see 
      Rowdy, like the pain rolls back for a moment.

                                  EDDIE
                    ... he ll... eat... you all.

    And then, very quietly, Eddie dies.  

      Rowdy snatches up the rifle, furious now.

    He cracks the rifle to make sure it s loaded.  

                                  ROWDY
                    GRADY!

    He checks each room before he moves past it.

    The whole time, he keeps an eye on Grady s closed door.

      Once he s sure each room is clear, he steps up to Grady s 
      door.  He turns the knob, testing to see if it s locked.

    It opens easily.  He uses the barrel of the rifle to push the 
      door all the way open.


      Rowdy steps in and stops, surprised.

      Grady lies in bed, blankets piled on top of him.

      Blood on his hands.  A little at the corners of his mouth.

                                  ROWDY
                    Who do you think you re fooling?  
                    Get up out of that bed.

                                  GRADY
                    Can t.  Too sick.

                                  ROWDY
                    YOU KILLED EDDIE BEAR!

      Grady shakes his head.  He s feverish, hair plastered to his 
      scalp, eyes rolling.

                                  GRADY
                    Had to... had to do it...                                                                                    29.



      Rowdy gets a little closer.  He grabs the blankets.  Pulls 
      them off.

      This is our first real view of Grady since he s come back.  
    The first time without blankets.  The first time we can see 
    his body.

      He s painfully thin.  Skin like milk.  Each bone stands out 
    in sharp detail, practically pushing through.

    In fact, it s wrong to call him Grady at this point.

      This is THE WENDIGO.

                                  WENDIGO
                    You see?  I m still hungry.  I 
                    can t help it, Rowdy.  Help me.  
                    Please... brother...

      Rowdy shakes his head.  Doesn t want to believe his own eyes. 

    He raises the rifle, points it in the Wendigo s face.

                                  ROWDY
                    You mean that?  You really want me 
                    to help you?

      Rowdy clicks the safety off on the rifle.

                                  WENDIGO
                    Look at me.  Look at what I am.

      Rowdy puts his finger on the trigger.

                                  WENDIGO
                    Set Grady free.  Let me in, Rowdy.

                                  ROWDY
                    Never.

    The Wendigo reaches up and puts one hand around Rowdy s head.  
    Its disturbingly long fingers wrap around Rowdy s head 
      completely.

                                  WENDIGO
                    Let me in.  Grady s body can t take 
                    much more of this.  We ll leave 
                    Elena and the boys here.  I 
                    promise.  We ll go somewhere else 
                    to find food.

      Rowdy looks into the Wendigo s face.  There s still so much 
    of it that is Grady, just enough that s still human.                                                                                    30.



                                  ROWDY
                    Sorry... brother... but I just 
                    don t believe you.

      SLASH! The Wendigo lashes out and cuts Rowdy, across both his 
      arms, cutting deep into muscle and tendon.

    He drops the rifle, screams --

                                                                    SHOCK CUT TO:


      Elena and the boys sit huddled together in one bed.

      Outside, the wind rattles the building.

      They hear a cry, louder than the wind.

    The Wendigo s scream.  Somewhere close.  Then again.  Closer.

    Tim buries his face in his mother s shoulder.

                                  ELENA
                    Derek, you and your brother get out 
                    of sight.  Hide.

                                  DEREK
                    What about you?

      Elena stands, takes the gun from Derek, and walks towards the 
      bunkhouse doors, gun up.

                                  ELENA
                    I ll be fine.

                                  TIM
                    No, mom, please, don t...

                                  ELENA
                    Derek, get your brother and hide.

      Derek grabs Tim and runs to the furthest point from the door.  
      Together, they crawl under the bunk there.

      There s another cry from outside.

      Elena checks to make sure the shotgun s ready.

      She s shaky, but she stands firm, looking at the door, ready.

      BOOM! Something hits the outside of the door.  Hard.                                                                                    31.



    She jumps, stumbles back a few steps.

      BOOM! Something hits the door again.

                                  ELENA
                    GRADY, GO AWAY!

    She glances over towards the corner where the boys are 
      hiding.  She can t see them from where she is.

      They can see her, though.

    At least, most of her.  And they can see the door.

      BOOM! The third hit knocks the door loose from its hinges, 
    and for a moment, it stands there, independent of the frame --

    -- and then falls flat with a massive THUD!

      Elena tries to hold her ground, crying now.

                                  ELENA
                    Please, Grady... please go away...

    The Wendigo steps in, fills the doorway.  Wearing clothes 
      now, layers of winter clothes piled on top of each other. 

      Elena closes her eyes, finger tight on the trigger.

                                  ELENA
                    ... pleasepleaseplease...

    She pulls --

    -- and then finally releases the trigger.  She can t do it.  
      Sobbing, she lowers the gun.  The Wendigo pushes the rest of 
    the way in so she can see that it s dragging something.

      When she sees that it s Rowdy s body, she opens her mouth to 
      scream, but she s so shocked nothing comes out.

                                  WENDIGO
                    ... brought dinner...

    Now she screams.  Screams like she s never going to stop.


                                    END ACT THREE                                                                                    32.


                                        ACT FOUR


    The Wendigo drops the shotgun into the gun case and slams it 
      closed so it automatically locks.

                                                                    SHOCK CUT TO:


      WHAM!The Wendigo slams Rowdy s body down onto the huge 
      butcher s block island in the middle of the kitchen.

      Elena stands as far away from the Wendigo as she can.  Still 
      crying.  She watches as he moves around the kitchen to where 
      there s a butcher s block.

    He grabs a cleaver from it and whips it across the room at 
      her.  It sticks in the counter.  She screams, just a little.

                                  WENDIGO
                          (points at Rowdy)
                    Cook it.

    She shakes her head.  Can t imagine what it s asking.

    The Wendigo lashes out and punches the side of the steel 
      refrigerator, bashing in the entire side.

                                  WENDIGO
                    COOK IT!

    She tries to pull the cleaver free.  Has to put her whole 
      weight into it.

    She finally works it free, and she turns to look down at 
      Rowdy s body.

                                  ELENA
                    Rowdy...

    The Wendigo lashes out again.  Again.  Beating the 
      refrigerator out of shape with each blow.

                                  WENDIGO
                    IT S! JUST! MEAT! COOK IT!

    She reaches out and closes both of Rowdy s eyes.  She takes a 
      moment to gather herself, trying to regain some composure.

      Finally, she lifts the cleaver and, as she brings it down --                                                                                    33.




    -- Derek and Tim slip out from their hiding place.  Tim s 
      still crying.  Inconsolable.

                                  TIM
                    I want to wake up, Derek.  I don t 
                    wanna have this dream no more.

                                  DEREK
                    We have to help mom.

                                  TIM
                    No! I can t! I want to stay here!

                                  DEREK
                    She ll die! Do you want that?!

    Tim shakes his head.

                                  DEREK
                    He took the gun.  He s still smart 
                    enough to do that.  We ve got to 
                    get into the house and figure out a 
                    way to get mom away from him.

                                  TIM
                    Don t make me go in the house.

                                  DEREK
                    I m not going to make you do 
                    anything.  But I have to go.

      Derek walks across the room to the doorway.  Looks back at 
      Tim, who hasn t moved an inch.

                                  DEREK
                    Stay here and keep quiet.


      Elena works with a grim determination, never looking down at 
      what she s doing.  Detaches herself from the physical act.

    As a result, we shouldn t see much of it either.  All the 
      cutting and chopping is done OFF-CAMERA.

    She sets aside the work with the body for a moment to start 
      filling a large cooking pot with water.

    She steals a quick glance across the room at the Wendigo.  

      Suddenly, something occurs to the Wendigo.                                                                                    34.



                                  WENDIGO
                    Where are... my boys?

      Elena looks away, not wanting to answer.  She sets the water 
    on the stove, turns it on.

                                  ELENA
                    If this family still means anything 
                    to you... stop this.  Please.

    She looks back at him.  Past tears now.  Numb.

    The Wendigo flicks its wrist, spattering Elena with the gore 
    off its fingertips.  It practically growls a single word:

                                  WENDIGO
                    ... hunnnnnnngry....


      Derek crouches behind a couch, out of the Wendigo s line of 
      sight.  He can see the gun rack from where he is.

    He also sees Rowdy s discarded jacket on the kitchen floor.


    The Wendigo takes a step towards Elena.

    As she moves to put some distance between her and the Wendigo 
      again, she spots Derek.

      He s quietly moving out of his hiding place, across the open 
      floor.  Towards Rowdy s jacket.

    She steels herself for what she has to do.

    She starts to dump the chopped-up Rowdy into the pot of 
      water, still not looking at it.  

      Again, the body parts are all OFF-CAMERA.

    She picks up the cover for the pot and slams it on, drawing 
    the Wendigo s full attention.

      Once she knows he s looking at her, she tries to smile at 
      him.  Tries to speak with some degree of warmth.

                                  ELENA
                    Are you still in there, baby?

    She starts to move toward the Wendigo instead of away from 
    it.  She tries to look like she s not afraid.                                                                                    35.



                                  ELENA
                    You were today.  When you looked in 
                    my eyes... I could see it was you.  
                    You re not gone completely.

    As she gets closer, the Wendigo backs away, freaked out, not 
      sure what she s doing.  He snaps his jaws at her a few times.

    She glances quickly at Derek, afraid to look at him too long 
    and tip the Wendigo off.  

      He s in the kitchen now.  About five feet from the jacket.  
      Moving quietly.  Watching the Wendigo carefully.

                                  ELENA
                    I want my husband back.

    She reaches out to touch him as she gets closer.

                                  ELENA
                    ... please... Grady...

      She s only a few feet away from the Wendigo now.

      Derek reach the jacket.  Carefully, he reaches into the first 
      pocket.  The keys shift, giving a slight jingle.

                                  ELENA
                    ... you let it in.  Tell it to go.

    The Wendigo lashes out, one powerful blow to her chest.

    She cries out as she s thrown across the room, hitting the 
      cabinets so hard that one of them breaks.

    She collapses to the floor, sucking air desperately, trying 
    to catch her breath.  She puts one hand to her chest, afraid 
      something s broken or collapsed.

      Derek quietly draws Rowdy s keys from the pocket.

      Even with her eyes rolling wildly in pain, she sees Derek, 
      sees him backing off now.  Out of the room.  Then gone.

    She finds her voice.  Forces herself to speak.

                                  ELENA
                    ... can t kill me yet...

    The Wendigo bares its teeth at her, makes a bizarre clacking 
      sound, sucking at its own teeth.                                                                                    36.



                                  ELENA
                    ... not done... cooking.

    The Wendigo glances over at the stove.  Sniffs the air.

                                  WENDIGO
                    NOW!

    The Wendigo smashes both fists down on the butcher s block, 
      splintering it.


      Derek hurries over to the gun case.

      Searches the keychain.Finds the right key.

    He slides the key into the lock.  Looks over at the kitchen 
    as he turns it.

    The CLICK! itmakes seems incredibly loud.


      Loud enough to get the Wendigo to look in the direction of 
    the front room for a moment.

      Elena pushes herself to her feet, lets out a strangled growl 
    of pain as she does so.  The Wendigo watches her try to catch 
    her breath.  In pain.  She takes down a large soup bowl.  
      Finds a ladle in a drawer.

    She takes the lid off the pot and looks inside.  We don t see 
      what s cooking, but she barely holds back the bile that 
      rushes up her throat.  She gags a little, looks away for a 
      moment while she fights the urge.

      Finally, she dishes up what s in the pot. 

    She walks across the kitchen to the table and sets the soup 
      bowl down.

                                  ELENA
                    Okay.  Here it is.

    The Wendigo crosses in two quick steps and stands over the 
      table, glowering down at it.

                                  WENDIGO
                    Another.

                                  ELENA
                    You haven t even eaten that one.                                                                                    37.



                                  WENDIGO
                    For you.

                                  ELENA
                    You just asked me to cook it.  You 
                    can have it all.  Please...

                                  WENDIGO
                    ANOTHER! FOR YOU!

      Tears spring to her eyes as she backs off.

                                  ELENA
                    ... but... I m not hungry...

                                  WENDIGO
                    E A T!

    She sees there s no room to argue.  She takes down another 
      soup bowl.  And as she dishes up another helping of Rowdy, 
    she sobs openly, shaking, spilling it.


      Derek tries to open the gun case, just an inch, but the hinge 
    on it squeaks, incredibly loud.


    The noise makes her hands shake a little bit more as Elena 
      brings the bowl up to her face and inhales loudly.

                                  ELENA
                    Mmmm... smells good...

    She almost retches, but holds it back.

    She walks back to the table, making sure the Wendigo keeps 
    its eyes on her as she goes.

                                  ELENA
                    You told me to cook it.  I did.  So 
                    sit down now... and let s eat.

    She sits down at the table.  The Wendigo moves over to its 
      spot at the table, looks down at its bowl of  soup. 

                                  WENDIGO
                    Eat.

    She picks up a spoon from the table.  She considers the bowl 
    in front of her.                                                                                    38.




      Derek tries to open the case again.  The hinge squeaks again, 
      even louder.


    The Wendigo turns, sure it heard something.  

      Elena gets a big spoonful from her bowl.  

                                  ELENA
                    Look.  I m eating.

      Brings it up to her mouth.

    The Wendigo watches her closely.


      Derek uses the sound to pull the case all the way open.

    He pulls out a shotgun, cracks it.

    No shells.  Empty.

    He sighs as he pulls the keys loose and looks at the drawers 
    on the gun case.  Each of them locked as well.


      Elena can t do it.  She gags, drops the spoon.

    The Wendigo laughs at her, a hysterical sound.  It buries its 
      face in its own bowl and slurps loudly tries to get it all in 
    its mouth as quickly as possible.


      Derek works quickly.  He unlocks the first drawer, opens it, 
      doesn t worry about the sound anymore.

    He finds a box of shells, grabs it out of the drawer.  He 
      fumbles it open and drops it, shells spilling everywhere.


    The Wendigo doesn t hear anything over the sounds it s making 
    as it comes up from the bowl, mouth full of pieces of Rowdy, 
      chewing with enough force that Elena can hears the bones in 
    the meat cracking with each bite.                                                                                    39.




      Derek shoves shells into his pocket, then pushes two of them 
      into the shotgun.


    The Wendigo finishes everything in its bowl, throws it 
      against the wall where it shatters.

    She pushes the bowl away.  Can t even look at it.

                                  ELENA
                    No.  I can t.  I won t.

    The Wendigo jumps up, knocks the table out of the way.  
      Pushes its face right up in front of Elena.

    She slaps the Wendigo across the face, as hard as she can.  
    It actually shrinks back from her a little.

    She raises her arm and swings again.

      This time, the Wendigo catches her arm mid-swing.


      Elena screams as Derek snaps the shotgun closed.  He runs for 
    the kitchen, gun up --


    -- and finds the Wendigo holding his mother by the wrist so 
    she dangles a few inches off the floor, face-to-face.  

    She screams, in pain and afraid.  The Wendigo smells her, 
      then licks her underarm, the same place it licked earlier.  
    She keeps screaming.

                                  DEREK
                    HEY!

    The Wendigo and Elena turn at the same moment to look at 
      Derek.  The Wendigo just smiles.

                                  ELENA
                    Run.

                                  DEREK
                    Put my mother down, you bastard.

    The Wendigo laughs.                                                                                    40.



                                  DEREK
                    I SAID PUT HER DOWN!

      BLAM!Derek squeezes the trigger, maybe on purpose, maybe 
      accidently.  The gun barrel belches fire and the Wendigo 
      catches the blast in the shoulder.

    The Wendigo throws Elena across the room like a rag doll.  
    She bounces off the far wall with tremendous force and falls 
    the floor.

    The Wendigo takes off running out the back door, vanishing 
      into the night.

      Derek runs to Elena.  She s still alive.  Barely.

      This kid, so tough all the time, so determined, just breaks 
      like glass when he sees his mother banged up like this.

                                  DEREK
                    Mom.  Please.  Don t die.

                                  ELENA
                          (weak)
                    Protect... Tim.  Don t worry... 
                    about me.  I m... fine...

                                  DEREK
                    You re not fine, mom.  

      There s a sound.  Outside.  The cry of the Wendigo.

      Elena grabs her son by the arm firmly, pulls him close.

                                  ELENA
                    Go.

    She releases him and falls back.  Derek knows she s right and 
      runs out the way the Wendigo left.


                                    END ACT FOUR                                                                                    41.


                                        ACT FIVE


    Tim cowers under one of the beds.  Shivering.

    He hears footsteps on the steps up to the bunkhouse.

    He watches as the Wendigo walks into the bunkhouse.  He can 
    see the creature s feet and legs.

      Even worse, he can hear its diseased whisper, almost like 
      it s inside Tim s head.

                                  WENDIGO
                    Tiiiiiimmmmm... come out, boy.

    Tim pushes himself back further into shadow.

    The Wendigo starts to flip beds, toss them aside.  Tim can 
      hear it more than see it.  The Wendigo moves through the 
      bunkhouse, tossing bunks randomly.

                                  WENDIGO
                    Tiiiiiiimmmm...

    It sounds like the Wendigo s getting closer.  Tim looks 
      around, but there s nowhere for him to go.

    Tim closes his eyes.  Covers his ears.  He doesn t want to 
    see or hear this.  Can t take any more of it.

    The noises of things being smashed continue for a few 
      moments, then abruptly stop.

      After a moment, Tim cautiously removes his hands from his 
      ears.  Listens for a moment.

    The only sound is the wind outside.  Tim waits another 
      moment.  Finally has to see for himself.

    He crawls out from under the bed.  He moves up into a crouch 
    and looks around the room.  Everything appears to be clear.  
    He turns, keeps turning --

    -- and comes face-to-face with the Wendigo, perched on top of 
    the bed where Tim was hiding, waiting for him!

    Tim screams.  He jumps up and runs for the door.

    The Wendigo leaps off the bed, though, and in two quick 
      steps, he catches up to Tim.                                                                                    42.



    He reaches out and grabs the boy by the wrist, wrenching him 
      around.  Tim screams again.

    Tim fights and scratches and kicks and tries to bite, but it 
      does no good at all.  The Wendigo doesn t even seem to notice 
      Tim s efforts.

      Derek steps up into the doorway, gun up.

                                  DEREK
                    LET HIM GO!

    The Wendigo turns.  Pleased to see Derek.  It pulls Tim 
      around so he s between Derek and the Wendigo.  There s no way 
    for Derek to fire the gun.

                                  WENDIGO
                    Glad you re here.

    The Wendigo wraps its fingers around Tim s throat and slowly 
      squeezes.

                                  DEREK
                    Don t.

    The Wendigo keeps squeezing, cutting off Tim s air 
      completely.

                                  WENDIGO
                    We should be together.  All of us.  
                    Your mother, Rowdy, you and Tim... 
                    inside of me.  To make me stronger.

    The Wendigo lifts Tim off the ground by the neck.  He 
      struggles to survive, but he hasn t much fight left in him.

                                  DEREK
                    Daddy... let him go... please...

                                  WENDIGO
                          (laughs)
                    Daddy?  I m not your daddy.    

      Suddenly, Tim pulls with his last bit of strength.  The 
      Wendigo s not expecting it, either, so Tim s able to pull the 
      creature s other hand to his mouth --

    -- and Tim bites a couple of the Wendigo s fingers clean off!

      Shocked, furious, the Wendigo lets loose an unearthly howl 
    and flings Tim across the room.

    And in that moment, Derek fires!                                                                                    43.



    The shotgun blast hits the Wendigo in the chest.  Knocks it 
      back into the wall, and then it drops.  Not moving.

      Derek runs over to his brother, who lays curled in a ball, 
      sobbing. 

                                  DEREK
                    We don t have time for that right 
                    now.  Get up.  GET UP, TIM!

    He hauls Tim to his feet.

    The two of them walk over, cautious, and look down at the 
      Wendigo s prone figure.

    For the moment, the Wendigo almost looks like their father 
      again.  His face slack like this, all of the malice is gone, 
    and he just looks sick, used up.

                                  DEREK
                    Come on.  We have to go.


    The three of them huddle together in the cab, cold.

      Derek sits behind the wheel, starts the engine, lets it idle 
    for a moment.  He flips on the headlights, illuminating 
      Grady s body on the ground a few yards away.

      Elena can t take her eyes off it.
