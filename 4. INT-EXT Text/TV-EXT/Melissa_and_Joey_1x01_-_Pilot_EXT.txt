      HAILEY RUSHES ABOUT, TRYING TO GET RYDER READY FOR SCHOOL.

                                  HAILEY

                You brush your teeth, buddy?  

                                  RYDER

                Uh huh.

                                  HAILEY

                Today?

      OFF HER LOOK, RYDER TROTS BACK UPSTAIRS.  HAILEY TURNS TO 
      LENNOX, ON THE COUCH WITH HER LAPTOP AND HER PHONE.

                                  HAILEY (CONT D)

                I got meetings outside the house all 

                day but I ll be back in the afternoon.  

                What are you going to be doing with 

                  yourself?

                                  LENNOX

                If you re out all morning, sounds like 

                a good day to build that Meth Lab.

                                  HAILEY

                I m not crazy about you staying home 

                by yourself.

                                  LENNOX

                Hailey, I m fifteen.

                                  HAILEY

                That does not help.  I was fifteen.  

                When I was thirteen.                                                                                    22.


                                  LENNOX

                Ooo.  This is one of the few times I 

                want you to keep talking.

                                  HAILEY

                Go update your status.  Or download 

                  something grossly inappropriate.

      LENNOX GRABS HER CEREAL AND HEADS UPSTAIRS, PASSING RYDER AS 
      HE RETURNS.

                                  RYDER

                Morning, Psycho.

                                  LENNOX

                How s it goin , Perv.

                                  HAILEY

                Where s your backpack?

                                  RYDER

                (LAUGHS) Oh yeah.  Thanks.

      HE RETRIEVES IT AND SHE GUIDES HIM TO THE DOOR AS HER CELL 
      PHONE RINGS.

                                  HAILEY

                When the bus shows up today, get on 

                it.  Love you.

      SHE GIVES HIM A KISS, SENDS HIM OUT, AND ANSWERS HER PHONE.

                                  HAILEY (CONT D)

                Rhonda, I m still on family time.  Ten 

                minutes.  Oh, listen, I filled out the 

                nanny agency paperwork.  You gotta 

                find me time ASAP to go talk to them. 

      THE DOORBELL RINGS.  SHE OPENS THE DOOR TO REVEAL JACK LONGO, 
      STILL IN THE SAME SUIT, CITY BUDGET IN HIS HAND.                                                                                    23.


                                  JACK

                So Burke, exactly who does your 

                budgets?   Cause whoever he is, you 

                should think about the death penalty 

                for this guy.

                                  HAILEY

                You seriously came back here to talk 

                about the budget?

                                  JACK

                No, I came back here looking for Lewis 

                Scanlon.  But I was up late last night 

                reading the budget  cause I got no 

                job! (RE: BUDGET) Look at this, 

                  SpongeBob here put expenses in 

                accounts payable, but didn t accrue 

                revenue.  Accrued revenue should be 

                included as additional income in any 

                budget.  Speaking of criminal 

                  negligence, where s your scum-sucking 

                  brother-in-law?  You can tell me.  All 

                I want to do is kill him.

                                  HAILEY

                Look, I m real sorry you lost your 

                job.                                                                                    24.


                                  JACK

                Old news!  Yesterday I lost my condo.  

                Which would be okay, if I had my life 

                savings.  But that was all in company 

                stock.  Current value: dick!  Plus, 

                because of the Scanlon stink I got all 

                over me, I am unemployable anywhere in 

                the financial industry!  For the next 

                five thousand years.

                                  HAILEY

                I know.  Lewis made a real mess of 

                things.

                                  JACK

                Let me finish!  I sold all my suits -- 

                except for this swell Hugo Boss -- 

                they re about to repossess my car, and 

                here s the morning s big headline: now 

                that I got no more gold to dig, my 

                wife says she s leaving me. (SITS)  

                God, I m gonna miss that car.

                                  HAILEY

                I don t know where Lewis is.  Frankly, 

                I got a few issues with him myself.  

                Two, to be specific: one s twelve, 

                one s fifteen.                                                                                    25.


                                  JACK

                Yeah, my heart bleeds for the person 

                with the nice house and the job and 

                the Hockney on the wall. (ADMIRES THE 

                  PAINTING) You know what?  I think I ll 

                take this.  

                                  HAILEY

                Wait a minute...

                                  JACK

                Consider it a down payment from your 

                family to the much abused Jack Longo.

      HE LIFTS THE PAINTING OFF THE WALL.

                                  HAILEY

                Jack Longo... (LIGHT BULB) You ran the 

                  commodities division!  Lewis used to 

                talk about you all the time -- you 

                made millions for the company.

                                  JACK

                Did he also tell you that he dumped it 

                all into his Ponzi scheme? (RE: THE 

                HOCKNEY) You got, like, a nice Crate 

                and Barrel bag I could put this in?

                                  HAILEY

                How do I say this nicely?  I got my 

                own problems.

                                  JACK

                You re not going to help me?                                                                                    26.


                                  HAILEY

                Do you live in my district?

                                  JACK

                I m parked in your district.  And now 

                that I m living in my car -- yeah.

                                  HAILEY

                Listen, I got meetings, a trash 

                revolt, kids to deal with, and I m in 

                  desperate need of a nanny. 

      JACK HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE PAPERWORK IN FRONT OF HIM.

                                  JACK

                You re not going to find one this way.  

                The salary sucks.

                                  HAILEY

                It s live-in.  Includes a room and 

                meals.  Plus, I can negotiate higher 

                if I find a woman with experience.

                                  JACK

                It s gotta be a woman?  Only Vagino-

                  Americans need apply?

                                  HAILEY

                Personal question.  Did your hair just 

                get sick of you and leave?

                                  JACK

                (TAPS THE PAPER) Seriously, what s 

                your top number here?                                                                                     27.


                                  HAILEY

                I dunno.  Like another hundred a week.

                                  JACK

                Hundred and fifty, you got a deal.  

                But I can t start  til Monday.

                                  HAILEY

                You can t be serious.

                                  JACK

                Okay, I can start today.  I just have 

                to move a few things around.  Mostly, 

                my car.  Tuesday is street cleaning, 

                right?

                                  HAILEY

                You do know that childcare involves 

                  children?  You ever work with kids?

                                  JACK

                Are you kidding?  Right out of college 

                I ran a youth center downtown.  I was 

                in charge of fifty kids.  I made  em 

                meals, helped  em with homework.  

                Hell, it s second nature to me.  I m 

                the oldest of six kids. (OFF HER 

                  SKEPTICAL LOOK) Come on! You re not 

                going to trust me with a couple of 

                kids after your sister and her dirtbag 

                husband trusted me with half a billion 

                dollars?                                                                                    28.


                                  HAILEY

                Yes, you re perfect.  Just one small 

                detail: I don t really like you.  And 

                when people live in my house, I prefer 

                they be somewhat less... jerky.

                                  JACK

                Hey, I m not too keen on you but I m 

                willing to set that aside.  In the 

                interest of the children.

      THE FRONT DOOR OPENS.  IT S RYDER.

                                  HAILEY

                Ryder?  What are you doing back here?

                                  RYDER

                The bus never came --  cause the 

                streets are all dug up and the sewer 

                guys are tearing pipes out.

                                  HAILEY

                Oh shoot, yeah.  The new upgrade 

                starts today.  I even voted for it.  

                Crap!  Crap! (CHECKS HER WATCH)  Now 

                you re gonna be late.

                                  JACK

                No he s not.  I ll take him. (TO 

                RYDER) Call me Jack. (POINTS OUTSIDE)  

                See that Porsche?  It s mine.  For ten 

                more days.                                                                                    29.


                                  RYDER

                Sweet.

      RYDER HEADS OUT.  JACK FOLLOWS, THEN TURNS TO HAILEY.

                                  JACK

                Relax.  I got airbags and GPS.  What 

                Filipino nanny s gonna bring you that?

      HE EXITS, PASSING RHONDA, JUST COMING IN THE FRONT DOOR.

                                  RHONDA

                  (WATCHING HIM GO) Cute guy.  You re on 

                a hot streak, aren t ya?  

                                  HAILEY

                He s a homeless commodities trader.  

                He s taking care of the kids.  How 

                high do I sound right now?

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                    30.

      JACK S PORSCHE SKIDS TO A RAPID STOP RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE 
      SCHOOL BUILDING.


      OVER THE SHOT OF THE CAR, WE HEAR RYDER HURL.

                                  JACK (O.S.)

                                  ACT TWO - SCENE THREE


      RHONDA AND HAILEY WALK AWAY.

                                  HAILEY

                What am I doing right now?

                                  RHONDA

                Union guy, developers and a photo op 

                with the cat that dialed 911.

                                  HAILEY

                Wrong.  I m getting myself a real 

                nanny.

                                      END OF ACT TWO

                                  ACT THREE - SCENE ONE


      HAILEY HALF-TRIPS OVER ONE OF THE TRASH BAGS, MUMBLES A 
      CURSE, AND HEADS OFF.

                                                                            RESET TO:


      LENNOX IS SEATED IN A DECK CHAIR, LISTENING TO HER IPOD AND 
      TEXTING, AS JACK CAREFULLY CLIMBS OUT A WINDOW.

                                  JACK

                Wow.  Nice.  Is this where you come 

                for your adolescent brooding? 

                                  LENNOX

                Yep.  It s the lone Outpost of 

                Justice. (POINTS) See that house?  

                Four floors and one rich old lady.  

                Lives all by herself.  There s room 

                enough in there for three immigrant 

                families -- but they gotta live in 

                some shack.  That seem right to you?

                                  JACK

                Hey, if she owns the house, she owns 

                the house.  That s how it works.  

                (TAKES A SEAT) On the other hand, she 

                might ve had a perfectly fine husband 

                she kicked out -- for nothing he did.  

                Except for maybe losing his job.  The 

                job he worked his ass off to buy her 

                that house. (RECOVERING) Just a guess.

                                  LENNOX

                Your old lady did a number on you, 

                huh?                                                                                    41.


                                  JACK

                Life sucks much of the time.  

                  (POINTEDLY) As you well know.

                                  LENNOX

                (CLOSING DOWN) You don t know anything 

                about me, okay?

                                  JACK

                Fair enough.

      THEY BOTH STARE THOUGHTFULLY AT THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET.

                                  LENNOX

                And why should I have to go apologize 

                to that bitch of a principal?

                                  JACK

                Because.  At some point, every single 

                person who wants to get stuff done has 

                to eat a big steaming bowl of crap.  

                So get out your over-sized spoon, 

                kiddo,  cause today it s your turn. 

                (OFF HER STUNNED STARE) Oh, were you 

                looking for the little kid answer?  I 

                don t do those.

                                  LENNOX

                  (INDIGNANT) The school fired the music 

                teacher and completely got rid of the 

                band and Amy Leesin wrote an article 

                asking why -- and Lunt cuts it!  No 

                reason.  

                                  (MORE)                                                                                    42.

                                  LENNOX (CONT'D)

                And everybody s afraid to talk about 

                it.  So I did.  And she dusts me.   

                Somebody has to change the system.

                                  JACK

                And that can be done by sitting up 

                here on the roof checking e-mail? 

                (EYES HER) You really want to change 

                things? (OFF HER NOD) Go to the 

                meeting.  Say you re sorry -- you 

                don t have to mean it -- and then 

                subtly, over time, work to undermine 

                her authority.  You gain their trust, 

                then twist the knife.

                                  LENNOX

                Like my dear ole dad did to you?

                                  JACK

                Yeah.  But I m talking more about what 

                your Aunt s doing.  She was an 

                  outsider, a screw-up.  Made some, as 

                they say  bad choices .  Many of which 

                are accessible if you google  Naked 

                  Councilperson.   But she got smarter.  

                Learned how to work the system.  And 

                maybe accomplish something.  I ll say 

                this about your aunt -- if she had 

                just a thimble full of charm, she 

                would be unstoppable.                                                                                    43.


                                  LENNOX

                You got that right.

                                  JACK

                I mean, she s not bad-looking.

                                  LENNOX

                You gonna try to hit that?

                                  JACK

                What are you, a dock worker?

                                  LENNOX

                Sorry.  Withdrawn.

                                  JACK

                So what do you say?  I ll give you a 

                ride down to the school.

      LENNOX CONSIDERS, THEN FINALLY SHAKES HER HEAD.

                                  LENNOX

                Can t do it.  Can t eat that much 

                crap.

                                  JACK

                  (CONSIDERS, THEN) Okay, you forced my 

                hand.  I got one more argument.  And I 

                want you to hear me out before you say 

                  anything.

      SHE LOOKS AT HIM: TAKE YOUR SHOT.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                    44.


                                  ACT THREE - SCENE FIVE


      JACK GRABS THE NEW BAG OF TRASH AS WE HEAR AN O.S. CAR 
      ACCELERATE AWAY.  AS HAILEY APPEARS BEHIND HIM, WATCHING, HE 
      TAKE A FEW STEPS AND FLINGS THE BAG LIKE AN OLYMPIC CHAMP.                                                                                    55.


                                  JACK

                Hey, butt-face, you forgot something!!

      BANG!  WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE BAG HITTING A WINDSHIELD AND 
      BRAKES SQUEALING.  JACK LOOKS VERY PROUD.

                                  ANGRY VOICE (O.S.)

                Hey!

                                  HAILEY

                (STARES OFF, EYES WIDE) Oh my god, 

                he s gigantic, get inside!

      AS SHE YANKS JACK BACK INSIDE THE HOUSE, WE:

      FADE OUT.
