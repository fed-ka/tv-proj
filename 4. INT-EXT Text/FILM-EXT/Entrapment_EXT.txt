Lake Shore Drive.
Four o'clock in the morning.
Minimal traffic,
minimal life.
As MAIN TITLES BEGIN, we PAN UP the face of...
...Hancock Tower.
Up, up, forty floors, sixty, eighty, very dark
up here, street sounds fading fast, and as CREDITS CONTINUE we can
just make out...
...a dark FIGURE.
Like a spider.
Inching its way up the steel
surface of the 98th floor, and we CLOSE to see...
The THIEF.
All in black, nearly invisible, with a sleek visored
helmet that conceals the face.
Two long, oblong backpacks, climb-
ing ropes and harness across back and shoulders, tools at the belt.
Moving STRAIGHT UP the face of the skyscraper.
How is it possible?
CLOSER still to see...
...the piton-like BOLTS are electromagnetic, CLANKING to the steel
to support weight.
A button releases the magnetic charge when the
bolt is pulled up by cords to a higher position.
The Thief is
remarkably strong and agile, scaling the wall with fluid precision,
until...
...our summit.
A softly-lit, glass-walled PENTHOUSE on the
100th floor.
Subtle spots which bathe paintings, sculptures,
in a cavernous coldly-decorated space.
Swiftly, deftly, the Thief rigs a suction-mounted HARNESS to the
steel casing above a massive window.
Pulleys, metal caribiner
clips, yellow Kevlar ropes.
So superbly practiced, the rigging is
placed in seconds, huge SUCTION CUPS pressed to the surface of the
glass.
The Thief reaches to a metal rectangle at the top of the
rigging, touches a button, a motor WHINES, the ropes TIGHTEN and
the window...
...POPS FREE, hangs SUSPENDED by the Kevlar ropes which amazingly
sustain its awesome weight.
The huge pane shudders in the wind,
and the Thief slips...
...INTO the Penthouse.
Nearby, an ALARM BOX softly BEEPS its
60-second warning to the pulsing of a green light, and the Thief
attaches a small computerized DEVICE which runs a series of
possible CODES at dazzling speed on its display panel, until...
...the right one STOPS.
Illuminated in red.
The beeping, the
green light, go OFF.
The device is removed.
Back to the window, air rushing in, attach a similar suction-
mounted harness from the inside, all exquisitely engineered to rig
in seconds, press new suction cups to the inside of the dangling
window pane.
A small remote control clicker...
...RELEASES the outside suction cups.
The window's weight now
supported by the interior rigging.
The outside equipment pulled
INTO the apartment in a single tug.
The WHINE of a motor, and the
pane pulls UP, the Thief expertly POPPING it into place.
No trace of entry.
Rapidly folding the rigging into an astonishingly compact bundle,
the Thief SCANS...
...the profusion of priceless art.
The paintings run to Otto Dix,
Franz Marc, Marcel Duchamp.
One statue an obvious Rodin.
The soft
lighting makes walls seem invisible, everything with an infinity
perspective in mind.
An obsidian slab dining table that seems to
end at the horizon.
The Thief has packed the rigging away, taken out a large cylin-
drical TUBE bearing a label we can't read.
Knows the way, quickly
through the spectacular apartment, past oils by early German
expressionists, Russian futurists, a Rothko, a Kandinsky, a Francis
Bacon.
The Thief has no interest in these, and as CREDITS CONTINUE,
we enter...
...a powder room.
A lime-green poured concrete sink, a copper-
plated commode, and across from these...
...a single PAINTING.
Unlike the others, clearly an Old Master.
A 17th century city on the water, churches, spires, an ancient
bridge.
The Thief wastes no time, unceremoniously...
...CUTS the painting from its frame with sure, perfect strokes.
Rolls it quickly in acid-free paper.
Opens the cylindrical tube,
pulling out...
...another CANVAS which we cannot see.
Deftly unrolls this,
fitting it carefully into the stolen painting's now-empty frame.
Re-hangs it.
Stares for a beat through the opaque helmet visor.
Approves.
Slips the rolled-up stolen canvas into the empty tube.
Leaves.
Before we follow, we shift angle to see the replacement
canvas...
A cheerful acrylic portrait.
Bozo the Clown.
WITH the Thief now, moving fast, into a panelled library.
There is
a CHUTE built into the wall, a brass lid with the words U.S. MAIL.
The Thief pops the labeled tube DOWN the chute.
Gone.
Steps...
...onto a bookshelf, reaches up to punch out an overhead grating,
and...
Disappears into the vent.
Reaching back to refit the grating
seamlessly into place.
Our original exterior VIEW of the skyscraper's penthouse.
REVERSE
ANGLE now to see in far distance...
...the dense forest of silhouetted OFFICE TOWERS of downtown
Chicago against the night sky, and we ZOOM TOWARD them, covering
miles in three seconds, to CLOSE on...
...the highest floor of the SEARS TOWER, and THROUGH an unlit
window to see...
...a TELESCOPE.
A silhouetted FIGURE looking through it.
SNAP
to...
VIEW through the scope's lens.
An amazingly CLOSE detail of the
Hancock Tower Penthouse.
The scope now PANS DOWN the length of the
Tower, to...
The street.
The Thief climbing onto a battered old Lambretta.
Calm as you please.
And as the scooter glides off...
We HEAR our unseen voyeur WALK AWAY from our telescope.
A door
OPENS somewhere, and as CREDITS CONCLUDE, it...
Closes.
Softly.
Mac among the guests awaiting their cars, standing slightly apart.
From behind him...
...a feminine throat clears.
Nervously.
He closes his eyes for a
beat.
Then, turns.
GIN (softly)
How about.
If I try humility.
And presents a business card to him with both hands, Japanese-
style.
Mac looks in her eyes.
Takes the card with both hands.
Reads...
MAC
Virginia Romay...
GIN
Gin, actually, Gin Romay.
I
was named after a card game.
MAC
Or a cheap cocktail.
She blinks.
His brows raise...
MAC (softly)
As in.
I'll have a Gin Romay,
please.
With a twist.
That laser, unsmiling stare.
Beyond sexy.
She gets lost in it for
a beat.
GIN
You're supposed to be charming.
MAC
I'm supposed to be selective.
Glances back to her card.
Reads...
MAC
Art and Antiquities Acquisition
Advisor, how alliterative...
Looks up.
Still no smile.
MAC
And am I the antiquity?
GIN
In mint condition.
She sighs.
Achingly lovely.
GIN
Look, I've studied you, I know...
pretty much...everything.
Do you.
GIN
Made your first millions selling
scrap metal.
Then, gold mining
concessions, gems, art, and lately
strategic metals for new technologies
- platinum, zirconium, titanium...
MAC
You said.
Everything.
Huh?
Oh.
GIN
The cat burglar stories?
Why
would anyone...with so much to
lose...take those kinds of risks?
Guileless smile.
GIN
You'd have to be.
Stupid.
A held beat.
His glance lifts beyond her shoulder.
MAC
Excuse me.
And walks off toward a sleek custom TOURING CAR just pulling up.
She goes after him.
GIN
I didn't know Porsche made
things like this.
MAC
Well, they don't...
Tipping the valet.
Sliding in...
MAC
...as a rule.
Shutting the door.
Through the open window, she hands something
from her bag.
A plastic rectangle which OPENS into a slide viewer.
She presses the light ON.
He looks at the slide.
GIN
Recognize that?
No reaction.
GIN
My seller is in Shinjuku, we can
go there tonight.
She leans closer.
GIN
He wants 4.6 million.
I can
get it for three.
He hands it back.
Looks in her eyes.
MAC
No, you can't.
And TAKES OFF.
Her jaw drops slightly, but in one fluid motion...
She's hailed a cab.
Gin climbing out of a taxi at a scruffy section of Yokohama's Bund.
Sleazy shops, pachinko parlors, hostess bars, sidewalk noodle
counters, all built along a tall rickety PIER nearly thirty feet
above the pounding surf.
The harbor is gigantic.
Every type and
size of vessel imaginable.
Gin carries a long neoprene-covered tube with watertight seals and
a lightweight bright orange foam cover.
She looks at her slip of
paper.
Then across at the place...KENDO SOUVENIRS, a schlock
kickback parlor, with a tourist bus parked out front.
This can't be right.
Pulls out the cellular phone.
Dials.
MAC'S RECORDED VOICE (O.S.)
You have reached the voice-mail
of AMD Investments.
And, yes,
you are at the right place.
Fucking great.
GIN (into phone, pissed)
I like men with a sense of humor.
This does not qualify.
SNAPS the phone shut.
Checks the slip again.
Walks firmly across
the street, through the mobs of tourists, and into...
The tiny Jetski cruises in a quiet channel, crowded with vessels of
all sizes, tugs, fishing boats, pleasure craft, junks, sampans, all
larger than we are.
Gin clings close to Mac, although it is no
necessary.
More like romantic.
She is still flushed with
the rush.
GIN
I guess you're gonna explain
all this, huh?
But he says nothing.
Pulls out a water-tight duffle.
Hands it
back to her, without looking.
MAC
Dry clothes, you'll need them.
In five minutes.
She takes the bag, confused.
GIN
I'm supposed to change?
Here??
MAC
I won't look.
Gentleman's word
of hon...
GIN
There are a million sailors!
MAC
I've seen you naked.
Give the
boys a thrill.
He means it.
MAC
You probably won't be dating
any of them, so what the hell.
Gin looks around as they float through the maze of watercraft.
No
one seems to be paying much attention.
What the hell.
She unzips
the bag, pulling out...
GIN (astonished)
These...these are mine!
He never looks around.
MAC
Found 'em in your room.
Perhaps
the thief wasn't your size.
She stares at the back of his head.
wondering.
He is stripping
off his slickers.
A neatly-tailored SUIT beneath.
MAC
We have a business appointment.
In four minutes.
Okay.
She pulls her dress off OVER her head.
GIN
Business, huh?
She ignores some nearby WHISTLES and SHOUTS.
Begins drying herself
with a fluffy towel from the bag.
MAC (never turns)
Time has come to tell you.
What
business.
I'm actually in.
Uh-oh.
Paydirt.
GIN
Uh.
Am I gonna like th...
MAC (quietly)
I'm a thief.
She can scarcely believe he's admitting this.
MAC
And now that I've told you.
I'll have to kill you.
He chuckles a Scottish chuckle.
Cold and warm, at once.
MAC
Or...
She slips the dry dress OVER her head.
MAC
...you can spend the most
interesting three weeks of
your life.
Training.
GIN
Training for wha...
MAC
...followed by the most exciting
night of your life.
After which,
you can walk away with 20 million
untraceable dollars...
She blinks.
He means this.
MAC
...which will come in handy.
Things being what they are.
He shrugs.
MAC
From now on.
You can valet park.
She begins taking off her wet underwear, underneath the dress.
We
suspect unseen hordes crestfallen at her modesty.
GIN
And if I refuse?
MAC (very quietly)
Don't.
Please.
GIN
I mean, you won't really kill
me, I'm far too adorable.
He looks around at her.
As if deciding on that.
MAC
Last night, at Fujitsu, I did
some business.
While you thought
I was in the toilet.
Jesus.
GIN
What could you possibly steal
in 18 min...
MAC
Thirty-five super-microchips.
Each worth one million dollars.
And change.
Staring dead at her eyes.
GIN
You hate round num...
MAC
I stole your suitcase when I
left you at the bar.
I have
since sent it on to the States,
with three chips, well hidden.
Are you following?
MAC
Since you aren't there to claim
it, the bag will sit at Customs.
Safe.
Unless...
No smile.
No smile at all.
MAC
They receive.
An anonymous.
Tip.
Holy.
Fucking.
Christ.
GIN
That's entrapment.
MAC
No, entrapment is what cops do
to robbers.
We can feel her heart pounding from here.
MAC
Blackmail.
Is what robbers
do to schmucks.
And leans.
To kiss her mouth.
MAC (softly)
Even adorable ones.
They have glided up beside the gangway of a gigantic FREIGHTER.
It
is at water level, the steps they use for their tender.
He points
up to the name...
MAC
Pop quiz.
SHIKOKU MARU.
She nods, slowly.
Pulls the Ziploc bag from her
purse.
Hands it over.
He removes the sheets of paper.
Begins to
peruse them...
MAC
Admit it's a rush.
The best day
of your heretofore drab life.
GIN
Fuck you.
He glances up.
GIN
...accompanied by related foreplay.
And gives him the smile. What a gal.
He offers his hand.
She rises, hops lightly to the steps of the
gangway in her bare feet.
He pulls dry shoes from the duffle.
And
as she slips them on...
...he FLIPS a switch, and the Jetski begins to FILL with water, Mac
stepping to the gangway beside her.
They watch...
...the Jetski rapidly SINK out of sight.
No evidence.
A thorough guy.
Woods, rolling hills, a dirt path.
Mac stands by a sign at a
crossroads, names, arrows, STINSON BEACH, BOLINAS, MT. TAMALPAIS,
MILL VALLEY.
There is a phone booth nearby.
He holds a stopwatch,
looking down the path, as...
...Gin runs into view, steady stride, breathing hard, sheened with
sweat.
Approaching him, she slows to a stop.
Hands on her knees,
catching her wind. He CLICKS the watch.
MAC
Consistent.
And rather impressive.
She sends a nasty smile, thanks a bunch.
But maybe she likes the
compliment, after all.
Rustic cabin in moonlight.
Ringed by woods.
Middle of nowhere,
which is where Mac likes it.
As we approach the lit window, we
hear two oddly-matched sounds.
splashing water.
And the HISS of a
violent POWER TOOL.
We MOVE THROUGH the window, into...
CLOSE on Gin operating a small steamshovel with a loading
attachment on the front.
It is mounted with two 2 x 4's, set
close together, protruding from the loader.
She maneuvers the
wooden prongs toward a pile of big rocks.
But as she positions
to scoop one up, her vehicle SWAYS WILDLY, and we PULL BACK to
see it is...
...dangling from a CRANE, operated by Mac.
Gin stays with it,
concentrates, and on the next pass she glides her boards UNDER a
huge rock, LIFTING it awkwardly.
Ignoring the bumpy ride, she
pivots, and deposits her prize in place atop what has become...
...a WALL of stones.
GIN
What the hell are we building?
He gives this some reflection.
MAC
A chalet, I think.
Or an outhouse.
Mac and Gin paddle KAYAKS, side by side.
A full moon slams off
the rolling surface of the sea.
Light chop, enough to bob pretty
strong once they stop paddling.
His stopwatch GLOWS.
He says
only...
MAC
Forty seconds.
And she FLIPS OVER, submerging her head and torso, and we go...
...WITH her underwater, upside-down in the kayak, she STRUGGLES to
FREE a group of tools which are tethered to her wetsuit.
Fumbling
to BREAK the seal on a slender TUBE, which BURSTS, sending a GLOW
of yellow-green LIGHT in all directions.
She fits the flexible
tube around her head like a headlamp, pulling out...
...a small ELECTRIC FAN with side HANDGRIPS of black metal.
Buffeted by the current, Gin manages to flip a small switch on the
housing of the fan, and...
...nothing happens.
Again.
Nothing.
And again.
SHIT!
With a
supreme effort, she tries to ROLL herself upright, but...
...can't quite make it.
Blind PANIC now, blowing bubbles, FLAILING
at the kayak, which suddenly...
ROLLS upright, manipulated by Mac.
She sputters and tries to
THROW the tethered fan at him, but it snaps back and SLAMS her
across the shoulder.
She is furious.
GIN
Get your fucking equipment
together, man, this is a
professional operation!!
Gin in a clearing, arms at her sides, a determined look.
Mac is
somewhere just behind us.
MAC (O.S.)
This time, when you raise your
arm.
Don't breathe.
She nods, got it.
Focused.
suddenly, in the clearing before her,
a HOSTAGE SILHOUETTE TARGET pops up, the outline of a terrorist
shielding himself with a hostage, Gin's arm rising with a BLUR
and...
...BLAMM, BLAMM, BLAMM!!!
The paper terrorist is NAILED in the
head.
Two out of three.
She lets out a thin stream of air.
Proud
of herself, but too cool to gloat.
MAC
Very, very nice.
Had a tour
with the Mosad, did you?
She turns slowly.
GIN
Where does this fit in the
game plan?
His enigmatic, yet fond, smile.
MAC
Oh, it doesn't.
But one
never knows...
A quiet wink.
MAC
You might need it with me.
Mac sits alone at a table, sipping coffee, reading Barron's.
A
short-wave radio is playing BBC World Service.
Leaning against an
open laptop, is...
...Mac's stopwatch.
He glances up at it.
What he sees makes him
reach into a duffle at his feet, withdraw...
...a rectangular gun-metal gray DEVICE.
Looks like a cross between
a remote control clicker and a large cell phone.
Turns it ON.
The
power display GLOWS green.
Gin running alone.
Up the dirt path we've seen before.
Ahead, the
crossroads, the sign.
The lonely phone booth.
Mac tuning the device, which is an advance-design SCANNER.
We HEAR
overlapping CONVERSATIONS through bursts of STATIC...
OVERLAPPING VOICES (O.S.)
...told you it's not a good time
f...either, personally, I've never
liked h...Giants' pitching, once
ag...late, you want the Chronicle
or don't y...
Mac HEARS a phone RINGING over the scanner.
Punches RECORD, PLUGS
the scanner INTO his laptop.
VOICE (O.S.)
Webber Assurance.
GIN (O.S.)
This is oh-four-six-one.
Hector
Cruz, please, on a secure line.
VOICE (O.S.)
Please hold.
Mac's laptop screen in printing.
WEBBER ASSURANCE...HECTOR CRUZ...
VOICE (O.S.)
Go ahead, please.
GIN (O.S.)
Thank y...
The line goes DEAD.
So do Mac's eyes.
Click the scanner OFF.
Late night, mostly youngsters strolling the unfathomable vastness
of the square.
At what seems an immeasurable distance, the huge
illuminated portrait of Mao zedong hangs from the Gate of Heavenly
Peace.
The scale of this place is unique in all the world.
PAN to
a nearby parked...
...Mercedes.
COL. QIU of the People's Liberation Army, lounges at
the wheel in full uniform.
Talks into his cellular...
QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
...it's not over yet, it hasn't
even begun.
He listens, winces.
We can hear Gin's voice yelling at him in
Mandarin, dishing out a major piece of her mind.
QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
...after Midnight, when his meeting
ends.
In Zhongnanhai.
He doesn't like her attitude.
And there's plenty of it.
QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
The mask will be ready...
A phalanx of TROOPS march past.
The Colonel turns his face to
shadow.
Drops his voice...
QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
You fucking bring the bones.
The walled compound where the Politburo's elite work and live.
From an open gateway...
...the MINISTER OF FINANCE appears, flanked by bodyguards in the
drab green of PRC police.
They step onto the street and turn into
a narrow hutong.
Down the alleyway comes a young man walking his
bicycle through shadow.
Nearing us, he raises his right hand,
and...
...SHOOTS each bodyguard TWICE through the chest, DROPS the bike,
LURCHES at the Minister with something cylindrical and gleaming,
and...
...SPRAYS the cowering official's FACE with something that makes
him SCREAM in pain, the assassin RUNNING down the hutong for his
life, as a fallen guard...
...SHOOTS him in the back, and he goes SPRAWLING, SKIDDING, face
down.
Lifeless.
CLOSE on Gin's gloved hand, holding something we can scarcely see,
as MIST floats up between us.
It is a carabiner with a nylon rope
attached, and she CLIPS it to a thick wire.
GIN (O.S.)
I'm freezing my tender parts.
PULL BACK to see her in climbing harness, scaling a nearly-vertical
CABLE, three feet in diameter.
Enveloped in fog which reveals,
then conceals.
MAC (O.S.)
I'm relieved to hear you have some.
PULL WAY BACK to see him below her.
The two of them climbing
the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE.
They are near the top, more than 700
feet above the silvery black BAY.
A precarious, dizzying sight.
MAC
What's amazing, is that only eleven
workers died during construction of
this thing...
GIN (grim)
...thanks for sharing...
MAC
Of course, the others were saved by
a safety net.
Gin keeps her focus on the small railed PLATFORM just above her.
A
gutsy gal.
MAC (loving it)
Now, as for the suicides, they
always jump facing the city.
Avoids
that tall fence about 50 stories down,
see it, there?
She's at the platform.
GIN
I never liked you.
Unclips one last time.
This won't be easy.
Throws her rope
OVER the railing, and to her surprise, Mac braces himself with
his legs...
...lifts her from the waist with strong hands, boosting her easily
to the platform.
Grateful, she hates to confess it.
GIN
One act of fucking human kindness...
MAC
Call it a lapse.
And he swings lightly up beside her.
The fog has rolled past.
There are several million stars.
Transcendent beauty.
She slows
her breath...
GIN
And how does this fit into
the game pl...
MAC
Oh, it doesn't.
We came for
the view.
And from his contoured backpack, he pulls a bottle of Cristal.
Flutes, wrapped in velvet.
He POPS the cork in one motion, and it
SAILS to its watery doom.
She can't help but watch.
One more motion to pour both glasses.
Hands one to her.
Toasts...
MAC
To Ginger Baker.
He clicks her glass.
She stares straight in his eye.
Shows no
surprise, no fear...
GIN
I'm partial to drummers.
If they
played with Clapton and Winwood.
And takes a sip.
Cool as a goose.
Licks her lips.
GIN
The prescription bottle.
When you
stole my suitcase.
But he's not drinking.
Only staring.
The wind has picked up.
GIN
Armand Baker was my husband, May 13
to October 27, 1982, he played alto
sax, I was 17 years old.
She takes another sip.
Good wine.
GIN
He named me Ginger.
He likes
drummers, too.
MAC
And you get sentimental for him.
Every time you order drugs.
GIN
I have I.D. in that name.
I use
it for various things I don't want
traced.
When credit unions turn
their computers my way.
MAC
I could listen to you lie all night.
She toasts him.
GIN (softly)
Same here, fella.
Slowly, he reaches to an inside pocket, watching to see if she
flinches.
Her eyes do flicker.
And follow.
He withdraws not a
pistol, but a handful of...
MAC
Do you like diamonds?
Nine DIAMONDS, so large, so exquisite, she has to keep her eyes
from bugging.
Wow.
MAC
You asked.
Does the machine.
Make gold.
Holy.
Christ.
MAC
Gold is shit.
It's six thousand
dollars a pound.
Worth your weight
in gold...?
His eyes travel her body...
MAC
That would put you at seven
hundred thousand.
GIN
Would you pay it?
And he leans.
Looks in her eyes.
MAC
When the light hits you just
right.
I'd pay more.
She liked that.
Maybe a lot.
GIN
The machine.
That we are stealing.
Makes diamonds?
No answer.
GIN
Real ones?
MAC
Gem quality.
First ever.
God
save Japan.
He toasts Blessed Japan to the East.
Takes a hit.
MAC
A diamond reactor takes graphite,
runs it through a combination of
lasers, electron beams, and scanning-
tunnel mg microscopes.
He means this.
She is transfixed.
MAC
This one uses krypton-fluorine laser,
with a new isotope of krypton.
She looks down at the diamonds in his palm.
His fist CLOSES.
MAC
The atoms are rearranged.
And
the molecule of graphite becoznes
a molecule of...
He turns his fist UPSIDE-DOWN.
And LETS GO!
She GASPS as the
brilliant stones FALL toward the sea.
Watching, watching, long
after the moonlit glimmer has evaporated.
A hush.
GIN
I hate it.
When you make
a point.
Mac and Gin stroll down the gangway, to the seedy, dangerous-
looking wharf.
At the bottom of the gangway...
...a wooden board to mark the whereabouts of guests.
Each
stateroom has a peg, which can be moved to ABOARD or ASHORE.
Mac
moves the peg for 16...
...to the ABOARD position.
And off they go.
Expansive barely-lit deck under a canopy of stars.
A silver-haired
couple in immaculate evening attire stroll alone, he is humming to
barely-audible dance music from a distant lounge.
She clings to
his arm, it is romantic.
Until they reach the railing where he
turns, and says something quietly in German...
She stiffens.
Pulls her arm away from his.
She sneers coldly,
calls him a name in German, and he UNLOADS on her, a barrage of
German-language INVECTIVE that would melt a tank.
She absorbs the
abuse without flinching, turns toward the rail, HAWKS and...
...SPITS over the side.
Strides away from him.
He watches her go.
Then...
...SPITS over the side himself.
And follows her.
Half a beat.
Mac's head APPEARS above the rail.
Just where they spit.
Not a
mark on him.
Mac leads her along the empty moonlit deck to...
...the BOWSPRIT, a long, narrow platform, ringed by a flimsy rail,
it juts far out above a churning sea.
The whipping of the wind
makes it seem all the more precarious.
MAC
It only looks dangerous...
Holds out his hand.
She hesitates.
MAC
You couldn't fall off.
Unless
someone threw you over.
Gives her the smile.
She puts her hand in his, and they hop
UP to the platform.
Walk its length to the very end.
He turns
now, leans casually against the fragile railing.
They are inches
apart.
MAC
More intimate.
For a confession.
Gin looks down at the plume of wake leaping off the bow.
MAC
What business.
You are actually.
In.
She looks up.
To his eyes.
Into them.
GIN
Yeh.
I'm not an art dealer.
MAC
Of course not.
You're a cop.
And tilts his head.
Just to one side.
MAC
An insurance investigator for
Webber Assurance, your boss is
an idiot named Hector Cruz, you've
been there four years and ten
months, you're quite the rising star.
GIN (evenly)
Nope.
His head tilts.
Just a little farther.
MAC (very softly)
Nope?
GIN
I'm a thief, Mac.
Holds the look.
GIN
For five years, I've used the
database of every client Webber
has to plan my jobs.
Museums,
banks, jewelers, rich people, I
have floor plans, alarm codes,
passwords, the works.
His face absolutely neutral.
Unreadable.
GIN
I've made a fortune.
It's not
enough.
MAC
Why n...
GIN
Why wasn't it enough for you?
He falls silent.
GIN
The Vermeer that was stolen from
Hancock Tower?
That was my job.
I scaled the building with
electromagnets, and parachuted
down an air vent...
No smile at her lips.
Strictly business.
GIN
...after mailing the painting.
To
where we're going next, actua...
MAC (quietly)
We.
She looks him up and down.
GIN
Yeh, we.
You passed the audition.
Now he smiles.
First time.
MAC (a murmur)
Imagine my relief.
GIN
I need a partner.
For the biggest,
smartest, job.
Ever.
The one you
retire off of, because nothing else
could ever compare with the rush.
MAC
Ever.
Is such a long time.
GIN
This is a job that can only be done
in one place, in one split-second
in human history.
If we miss that
instant.
We lose.
MAC
And it's worth...?
GIN
Eight billion dollars.
That's
eight thousand million.
MAC
How much in shillings?
GIN
You're not a real trusting guy.
MAC
And I tried so hard to hide that.
GIN
It's two jobs.
The first steals
something priceless from the National
Palace Museum in Taipei.
We don't
keep that.
We trade it in for our
ticket to the show.
MAC
One moment in time, you s...
GIN
Midnight, July 1, 1997.
Eight
days from now.
The moment that
Hong Kong is annexed by china.
And now.
She has his interest.
She can see that.
GIN
80-20 split.
MAC
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It's
your plan, you should take at least
thirty perc...
GIN
My 80, your 20.
Asshole.
He thinks this over.
MAC
50-50.
Or you can swim to Taipei.
She is not impressed.
Or afraid.
He grins...
MAC
What are you gonna do with six
billion dollars that you can't do
with four?
GIN
Hold the record.
Alone.
This.
He likes.
So much that he leans to kiss her, with
surprising tenderness.
MAC
Your share is 50%.
And one dollar.
Her hard stare.
And then, she smiles.
Just barely.
Still in his
arms...
GIN
I like what you left.
In the hold.
MAC
You didn't even see wha...
GIN
A lump of coal.
A pair of pliers.
A note that said, 'Squeeze hard'.
This is the most taken with her that he has ever looked.
She leans
up and kisses him.
Whispers...
GIN
Squeeze hard.
Ugly section of an ugly town.
Unmarked warehouses, alleyways
teeming with food stalls.
HEAR a motorcycle approach, and see...
...Gin driving, Mac sits behind her.
Going real fast, maybe she's
showing off, we FOLLOW them DOWN a blind alley, as she smoothly
WHEELS them into...
...an open FREIGHT ELEVATOR.
She climbs off, he doesn't.
As Gin
goes to work the controls, Mac sees a cat curled in the corner,
mewing softly.
GIN
That's Madame Chiang Kaishek, she's
my bud.
An evil streak a mile wide.
The elevator JOLTS to life.
MAC
No surprise.
They CLANG upward.
Mac seems utterly relaxed.
Gin paces a little,
hugging herself.
Her features tense.
MAC (gently)
Tired?
She blinks up.
He is straddling the bike.
Smiling at her.
GIN
I have a lot on my mind.
Ah.
Well...
MAC
You look beautiful doing it.
He seems to mean that.
And it seems to melt her a little.
She
sags against the wall, closing her eyes, as...
...they JOLT to a stop.
She PULLS the heavy LEVER, and the door
SLIDES noisily open, to reveal...
...a gigantic LOFT.
She flicks on a dim light, but we see only
part of the cavernous space.
She strolls, Madame Chiang trotting
along behind.
Mac follows, looking around, then down to see...
...a pile of MAIL, cables, packages.
The unopened MAILING TUBE we
saw in the Hancock Tower penthouse.
He crouches, lifts the tube in
his hands...
GIN (O.S.)
You wanna buy a Vermeer?
MAC
Rather steal it.
GIN (O.S.)
Been there, done that.
He nods to himself.
Guess so.
He rises to see her framed against
the gaping starlit opening of a huge LOADING DOOR.
The twinkling
island lies below.
But here, Gin stares down at...
...an elaborate architectural MODEL.
Fifteen feet across, it
features an imposing yellow, pagoda-roofed BUILDING, built into
the side of a model MOUNTAIN.
Formal gardens, fountains, tiny
Kuomintang flags.
Stretching away from the building, a large
portion of the CITY, with shops and alleyways elaborately detailed.
As Mac joins her...
GIN
National Palace Museum, Taipei,
Taiwan.
Repository of four
thousand years of Chinese culture...
He bends to lift UP the detachable roof.
All the rooms are
detailed within, down to exhibit cases.
GIN
Works of gold, bronze, jade, onyx,
pots and scrolls, paintings and
porcelains and lacquer work.
Every
treasure the Kuomintang could loot
before the Reds took over.
(beat)
Ever rob the place?
MAC
No.
If memory serves.
She takes him by the hand, and leads him toward the gaping doorway,
walking straight toward it...
GIN
You need to eat something, or
are you ready for sex?
And just at the edge of it...
MAC (torn)
The options seem so limited.
They jump THROUGH the opening.
And VANISH.
Our ANGLE closes on the doorway, to see OUT now, sitting like a
jewel against the hillside...
...the NATIONAL PALACE MUSEUM, looking exactly like the model.
The
town spread out beyond.
Just as in the model.
And now we TILT
sharply DOWN to see...
...a loading PLATFORM, suspended above the island, only a few feet
below our opening.
Like a balcony without a railing.
Mac and Gin
already sinking down onto a waiting futon.
Looks like he's made his pick.
Among limited options.
AERIAL VIEW down toward the sweeping pagoda roofs of the MUSEUM,
the formal gardens, the fountains, the tree-lined driveway.
CLOSE
now, as a cab pulls up, a couple emerges...
She is first.
Chanel suit with an extremely short skirt, revealing
endless legs.
She helps him from the taxi, a white-haired geezer
who seems well past 90, fumbling with his walking stick, and making
quick, erratic, bird-like glances in every direction.
She takes his arm for support.
Murmurs in his ear...
GIN
Isn't it easier now?
Not pretending?
Gives him a full-tongue KISS in the ear, which has bystanders
noticing.
Starts to help him up the stairs, still whispering
close...
GIN
Five years, you won't need
make-up.
In answer he GRABS her ass, and she YELPS with delight, attract-
ing attention all around.
His turn to whisper, as he massages
her backside...
MAC
We agreed.
No underwear.
GIN
Overkill.
I can do it with legs.
He stops.
Gives the long legs a dubious twice-over.
MAC
I'd lose the underwear.
CLOSE on an entrance, just as Mac comes...
...FLYING THROUGH, propelled by two sizeable SECURITY GUARDS, once
again landing in pieces.
It's a long day.
As Mac clears his head,
they stand at the doorway with folded arms.
Hoping he wants some
more.
MAC
WHAT KIND OF A COUNTRY IS THIS?
IN
BRITAIN, A MAN CAN TRY ON LINGERIE
WITHOUT COMPROMISING HIS DIGNITY!
The bruisers look at each other.
No habla Espanol.
A super TUGBOAT, engines RUMBLING, ready to pull out.
A woman
paces the deck.
Every time we see her, she seems more tightly
wrapped.
At last...
...here he comes, stepping briskly from the taxi, striding up the
gangway, pulling from inside his coat...
...the red lace teddy.
He drapes it over her face, and she pulls
it away, steps into his arms...
...her kiss is urgent.
Real.
HOLD on the look in her eyes.
What
is she thinking?
He strokes her hair, gently.
Then, goes to look into the
Halliburton case, which stands by the rail.
As he crouches.
As he
looks at the Bone...
She is watching him.
An intensity to her gaze.
More feeling than
she is comfortable with, which...
...disappears completely, as he turns to her.
And when he mimes
FLINGING the case into the sea...
She laughs.
CLOSE on a British Petroleum BILLBOARD with a huge DIGITAL CLOCK,
counting down by seconds...JUNE 29, 1997, 11:32 A.M. - 1 DAY, 12
HOURS, 27 MINUTES, 48 SECONDS TO:
REUNION WITH CHINA!
PAN to an AERIAL VIEW of...
Hong Kong's bustling STATUE SQUARE, the hub of countless feeder
streets and alleyways, as we ROAM to a SERIES OF SHOTS...
...billboards everywhere.
Western businesses that announce WE'LL
STILL BE HERE FOR YOU.
Others, primarily British, sending
farewells, gratitude for past patronage.
China-sponsored
depictions of happy Hong Kong and Chinese citizens, proclaim ONE
COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS.
...moving vans, people pushing carts of belongings, shop signs
advertising blowout inventory clearance sales.
Traffic beyond
gridlock.
The human ant colony.
...incredibly long queues in front of post offices, American
Express, the imposing glass and steel skyscraper called the HONG
KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK BUILDING.
...large groups of uniformed CHINESE SOLDIERS in the streets.
More
orderly DEMONSTRATION by anti-China PROTESTERS, their signs say
MORE DEMOCRACY and FREE HONG KONG, their numbers watched by Chinese
soldiers, who in turn are watched by British soldiers.
CLOSE on the square now.
A couple at a sidewalk vendor.
Mac is
purchasing a t-shirt.
Gin dutifully lifts her arms, and Mac slips
the garment over her head.
It says CHINA GOT HONG KONG, AND ALL I
GOT WAS THIS LOUSY T-SHIRT.
He regards her thoughtfully, and she turns, modeling for him as if
wearing a Givenchy original.
He approves, lifts the Halliburton
case, and they move on, strolling, chatting until Mac...
...bumps HARD into a Chinese SOLDIER, both men REELING with the
impact.
The soldier carries an identical HALLIBURTON CASE, and the
two men set their cases down side by side, as Mac steps forward...
MAC (subtitled Mandarin)
FUCKING HELL!
WATCH WHERE
YOU'RE GOING, MAN!
No one notices, no one cares.
Gin tugs on Mac's arm, don't get
involved, dear.
Mac reluctantly steps back.
The soldier glares at
him.
Then, bends and picks up...
...Mac's case.
A parting epithet in Mandarin, and the soldier
starts off.
Watching him, Mac unobtrusively fingers a concealed...
...PISTOL, ready for action.
But keeps watching, as within a few
yards, the soldier...
...stops.
Opens the case.
Checks out the Oracle Bone, right there
in the middle of the square.
Mac and Gin watching across the
distance, with hair-trigger keenness.
At last the soldier CLOSES
the case...
...walks back to us.
SOLDIER (subtitled Mandarin)
I believe I took your case.
Handing it to Mac, he leans forward, and in low, aecented
English...
SOLDIER
21 Old Peak Road.
In 45 minutes.
Picks up his own case.
And is gone.
A vintage Aston Martin pulls up to a spectacular gated MANSION.
Sparkling white, it is a blend of Edwardian and Regency.
Gin is
driving, speaks into the voice box, and the gate swings open.
As
they pull up the crushed rock driveway...
...a BUTLER appears, as British as the architecture.
Climbing from
the car, Mac has the Halliburton case.
BUTLER
Will you please come this way?
And leads them around the side of the house.
They walk slowly, a
distance behind the butler, taking everything in.
MAC
I like this.
His voice is strong, calm.
No hint of a smile.
GIN
You like wha...
MAC
Not being told what the fuck
we're doing.
She looks equally serious.
Just more tense.
GIN
You're on a 'need to know' basis.
You'll get each step in time to
execute, I thought you agreed to
those condit...
MAC (quietly)
I like your not trusting me.
Because it frees me to do
the same.
They come upon the spacious GROUNDS behind the mansion.
A
breathtaking view down the slope of Victoria Peak to Hong Kong and
the harbor.
Kowloon across the water.
GIN
I trust you.
I only need to...
MAC
...remain in control.
They pass a towering row of perfect ROSEBUSHES.
Mac SNAPS OFF a
giant blossom.
MAC
Which is a sign of weakness.
And hands it to her.
Their eyes meet.
MAC
I like that, too.
At the edge of the garden, above the commanding view, a luncheon
TABLE has been set.
Spread with delcacies.
Two SERVANTS attend,
also British.
Only the host is seated.
He does not rise.
GIN
Colonel
Col. Qiu glances up from his meal.
Green PLA uniform, absurdly
decorated, wraparound Gautier sunglasses.
We recognize him as the
man who took Gin's call in his Mercedes in Tienanmen Square.
The
man who accompanied the poor Minister of Finance to the ophthal-
mologist.
QIU
You look lovely, Ginger.
Is
the rose for me?
GIN
Of course.
And leans prettily.
To fasten it in the buttonhole of his lapel.
GIN
Col. Qiu Lai Chuen, this is
Andrew MacDougal.
Hearing his real name, Mac cuts her a look.
GIN
Real names here, darling.
The
Colonel and I have every incentive
to keep each other's secrets.
And she sits.
Close to Qiu.
Mac looks around at the property,
the view.
QIU
Like the place, Andy?
MAC
Please.
Mr. MacDougal will do.
The Colonel smiles.
First time.
Like an alligator.
Mac notices
that the tablecloth is actually...
...a Union Jack.
He fingers the flag.
QIU
This way.
Doesn't matter if we
spill.
MAC
My sentiments exactly.
He sits.
QIU
This place was a gift.
From
its former owner.
A Brit whose
business will now happily continue
to function.
Perhaps...even expand.
MAC (spreading his napkin)
Planning to spend much time here?
QIU
Tho it has required many sacrifices.
GIN
The Colonel has divorced his
wife.
To facilitate the necessary
entertaining of Western women.
QIU
Tho some are more entertaining
than others.
And runs the back of his knuckles up the length of Gin's bare arm.
MAC
Colonel.
You are touching the woman
I love...
Which brings Qiu's eyes over.
Really?
MAC
From time to time.
And pulls up the Halliburton case.
Handing it across the table.
As Qiu takes the case in his lap, opens it...
QIU
You're a Scot.
Would you like
some 25-year-old Macallan?
MAC
Sure, I'll take a case.
Qiu glances across the lawn to the butler, who stands behind the
bar trolley.
As the drinks are prepared, the Colonel studies the
Bone.
GIN
The Colonel told his Minister
of Culture that he could mount
a surgical raid to liberate this
treasure from Taiwan.
MAC
Ah.
How much was the Minister
told the raid would cost?
QIU (not looking up)
Counting equipment, personnel,
bribes, an even fifty million
American.
All in.
MAC
Which you can now keep.
The drinks arrive.
QIU
He would have paid twice that.
But my needs are modest.
And lifts from beneath the table, a leather POUCH.
QIU
Unlike.
The woman you love.
From time to time.
Drops it into Gin's lap.
She opens the pouch to reveal...
...goggles.
Like one would wear in a tanning salon.
Only these
are flesh-colored with one small hole in the center of each lens.
Slightly larger than the size of a pupil.
She slips them on.
A bright smile.
GIN
How do I look, honey?
And Mac smiles.
In return.
MAC
Like a woman.
Of mystery.
CLOSE on the British Petroleum billboard, where the countdown CLOCK
says...JUNE 30, 1997, 11:41 P.M., 0 DAYS, 0 HOURS, 18 MINUTES, 51
SECONDS TO:
REUNION WITH CHINA!
The square is beyond BEDLAM.
Times Square looks deserted New
Year's Eve compared to this carnival CRUSH of humanity, rock and
rolling as if reunion with China was the doorway to Paradise.
Singing, chanting, screaming, dancing, music and booze everywhere,
firecrackers exploding, soldiers and civilians, tycoons and
hookers, tourists and peddlers and Party members and homeless,
going absolutely nuts.
Who knows.
Could be the last party.
Ever.
WHIP PAN to the crowded plaza in front of the towering glass-and-
steel headquarters of the HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK.
ZOOM to focus on our smashing couple in evening wear, Gin with a
large beaded shoulder bag.
Mac presents an invitation to a PLA
soldier, who admits them into...
WITH Gin in a soft brunette wig, walking briskly, light carry-all
across her shoulder.
Very early, even the busiest street in the
world is less than that at this hour.
Up ahead...
...Tsimshatsui Station, a tall man with a tourist shopping bag,
leaning casually against a pole.
Talking into a cellular.
As she approaches, Mac doesn't seem to notice, but she can now hear
his conversation...
MAC (into phone)
...if I can't have my usual
suite, I'll take my business
to the Bristol, simple as that.
He sees her now.
Smiles small.
MAC (into phone)
...why indeed should I be more
loyal to you than you've been to
me?
Think it over.
SNAPS the phone shut.
MAC
You ran your calls.
She did.
She is frankly exhilarated.
GIN
All the transactions, all the
transfers.
It's a miracle.
MAC
Why?
The CD erased the trans-
actions, all accounts seem in
order.
It looks like the thieves
were stopped in time.
She sighs.
It is a miracle.
GIN
The Colonel says police have
nothing.
A man in black-tie, a
blonde in a gown.
The elevator
guards saw faces, but no mug shots
to ID.
I think it's over.
Mac's smile.
Bittersweet affection.
MAC
Except it never is, really.
Quite.
Over.
She smiles.
It is easy, but dazzling.
Atypically soft.
GIN
Well, one hopes not.
The Bristol,
huh?
In...Paris?
Ah.
MAC
You're not going back to Mr. Cruz,
and the nine-to-five?
GIN
Not hardly.
I've arranged to be
killed in a car crash.
On Taipei.
Amazing how little it costs.
MAC
Well.
You want to watch those
pennies.
She takes a breath.
Scared, in an excited way...
GIN
I could arrange for two.
In that
crash.
His smile back.
He looks at his watch.
Takes her hand.
Leads her to the subway
steps.
MAC
You know, for a bitch.
You can
be awfully sweet.
GIN
Woman of mystery.
What do you say?
I like the Bristol, just fine.
mean, it's not the Ritz...
MAC
You know, all night I've been
wrestling with something...
GIN
Not the most flattering way to
put it.
He takes his big tourist shopping bag.
Puts it in her hand.
MAC
I've changed your travel plans.
They are descending now.
Into the vast underground train station.
GIN
Mine.
MAC
Instead of taking the subway to
the airport, you change at Jordan
Station for Kowloon Tong.
Got that?
Got that?
MAC
Jordan is only 90 seconds up the
line.
Like a wire transfer, you're
gone.
Vanished.
He holds up a silencing finger.
Listen to me.
MAC
In this bag are passports,
tickets, papers.
An amber wig, a
good one.
A dress you can slip on
in five seconds.
Her eyes moving over his face.
What is this?
MAC
You're on a tight connection to
the Trans-Siberian Express, be in
Europe in a week.
GIN
Mac, wh...
MAC
Shhh.
You always talk too much.
They're at the booth.
He pays their fare.
Through the turnstiles,
now.
MAC
Time has come to return the favor.
One last time.
Smiles at her.
As they enter a tunnel.
MAC
Tell you.
What business.
I'm
actually in.
And in an instant of blind panicked clarity.
She gets the whole
thing.
GIN (hushed)
My God.
You're a cop.
MAC (very softly)
That's my girl.
Keep walking.
People are everywhere.
But they are alone in the
world.
MAC
See, my profession was cover,
too.
A notorious thief has access
to colleagues, their plans...
He sighs.
MAC
I've turned in...well, couple
hundred.
over forty years.
Scotland Yard, Interpol, FBI...
Looking around the tunnel.
MAC
Thought I might retire.
After you.
GIN
And all the...microchips, the
diamond machine...
MAC
Well, the chips were returned.
The machine was just a box, did
you actually think it was real?
Glances at her.
GIN
I thought...everything was real.
Stupid girl.
End of the tunnel in sight now.
It leads to a massive, endless
quai.
Trains in transit.
GIN
Those were your jobs, so I could
have claimed entrapment.
You had
to wait.
For mine.
Nearly there.
He says nothing.
Looks pretty grim.
GIN
The Oracle Bone...
MAC
Well, the State Department liked
that one.
They have more fish to
fry with Beijing than Taiwan.
He sighs.
MAC
So they're taking credit for
letting it go through.
Tho I'm
afraid your Colonel may be in for
a career disappointment.
She stops walking.
She has to know...
GIN
And the 5 billion.
Ah.
That.
MAC
I haven't told them.
Gently, takes her arm.
Leads her onto the endless train platform.
Walking slower now.
MAC
I said you hadn't revealed the
job.
That it wouldn't take place
until after the changeover.
Down the platform they stroll.
As her eyes wander...
MAC
Don't look, they're there.
Her breath catches.
Her eyes go down.
GIN
And my tickets.
In the shopping bag?
MAC
Well.
Kept my options open.
If
I give you up, they don't matter,
do they?
Her heart pounding through her chest.
GIN
If.
MAC
Had lots of crazy thoughts.
One
was retirement.
With four billion
dollars.
After all, I know some
places where life could be private...
GIN
But you couldn't do that, huh?
They've stopped.
Just two travellers in a strange land.
waiting
for a train.
GIN
Otherwise.
They wouldn't be here.
He nods.
Smiling pleasantly.
MAC
Creature of habit.
I suppose.
We feel her adrenaline racing.
GIN
Lots.
Of thoughts, you s...
MAC
Keep smiling.
They won't move,
until I raise my left arm.
And so she smiles.
As prettily as she can manage.
MAC
I thought.
Well, I've got the CD.
I could contact the banks, reverse
all the transactions...
A train is COMING.
We HEAR it.
MAC
...except maybe.
Leave you with...
oh, a hundred million, say.
To
tide you over.
SEE the train.
Slowing.
Pulling in.
MAC
Then, I thought, nah.
Not my style.
With a SHRIEK of metal.
The train PULLS toward us.
MAC
I figured.
What the hell?
What the hell?
MAC
Let her keep the lot.
The train STOPS.
The doors OPEN.
People come out, people go in.
Pouring around them.
They are alone again.
The subway doors stand
open.
Two feet away.
She looks at them...
MAC
No rush.
The doors won't close for
60 seconds.
Sixty seconds.
And still smiling...
MAC
There's a pistol in the bag.
Reach
in slowly.
Take it out fast.
Point
it at my temple.
She freezes to stone.
MAC
You can do it.
If I say you can.
And she...DOES IT.
A blinding MOVE, the gun straight at his head,
Mac miming fear, raising his hands to chill the agents we...
WHIP PAN to see.
Half a dozen, everywhere, but none too close.
They REACT, pull their weapons, but it's a stand-off.
BACK TO...
Two people. Alone in the universe.
MAC
Step onto the car, keep the
pistol trained on my face.
She hesitates.
Does as he says.
Passengers are screaming,
cringing, bolting for other cars.
Our world is FROZEN.
His hands
raised...
MAC
Seems I was wrong.
Gentle smile.
MAC
Entrapment.
Is what robbers.
Do to cops, huh?
Her eyes are flooding.
The gun is trembling.
MAC
Twenty seconds.
Shoot me in the
shoulder, it'll slow them down.
Her pistol is shaking like she has palsy.
Tears are on her cheeks.
GIN
Oughta shoot you in the face.
MAC
Come on, you can do it, if I sa...
GIN
No way.
Not anymore.
She sobs.
She can't stand this.
MAC
Ten seconds, hold on.
GIN
When do I see you?
There is no answer.
There are no words.
The doors HISS SHUT.
She stares, training her pistol on him
through the glass, his hands reaching back to hold off the agents,
and the train...
PULLS away.
An instant to pick up speed, and it ROARS into a
tunnel.
Gone.
Mac stands motionless as ALL HELL breaks loose around him, AGENTS
rushing to his side, Mac shaking his head, calmly...
Still staring after the train.
MAC
Airport.
Changing at Mongkok
Station, we can cut her off.
Walkie-talkies WHIP out.
These guys are the same the world over.
We begin to CRANE UP...
MAC
She might lose the wig, be looking
brunette or blonde, navy pants suit...
AGENT
I think Yaumatei changes for the
airport, and it's closer.
Keep PULLING UP, an AERIAL VIEW now, too high to see their faces...
MAC (O.S.)
I think you're wrong, but cover it.
You got maybe four minutes.
HIGHER still, the mob below an ant colony...
MAC (O.S., calmly)
No problem.
She's trapped.
But as the crowd parts.
We can make out one lone man...
Staring after.
What has gone.
FADE TO BLACK.
ROLL END CREDITS.
