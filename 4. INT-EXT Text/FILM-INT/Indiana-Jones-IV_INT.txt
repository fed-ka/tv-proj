Indy's flashlight BEAM glazes over the castle's interior. It is a
STONE PALACE. FILLED with elaborate, antique furnishings, macabre
sculptures and oil paintings. The place is bathed in DUST. Thick
COBWEBS fill each corner. It is extremely COLD. The men's breaths are
VISIBLE. Hennesey RUBS his folded arms.
HENNESEY
It's deathly cold in 'ere. How could
a human bein' survive?...
Hearing this, the other Policemen exchange TERRIFIED glances. Indiana
shines his flashlight to a TWISTING, STONE STAIRCASE. The staircase
spirals upward along a far wall, leading to the SECOND FLOOR. A FAINT
GLIMMER of light emanates from the top of the stairs. Indiana moves
FORWARD. The Policemen FOLLOW.
Indiana ASCENDS the stairs. SLOWLY. SILENTLY. Toward the LIGHT.
MacGowan and the others are directly BEHIND Indy. As he makes his way
to the top, Indiana examines the bizarre OIL PAINTINGS that line the
wall. There are various PORTRAITS and LANDSCAPES, depicting everything
from MILITARY BATTLES to SUNDAY PICNICS. But the unsettling quality of
the pictures, is that they each feature the same white haired, ELDERLY
MAN. Indy COMMENTS to Mac.
INDIANA
This guy's got one hell of an ego.
MACGOWAN
Baron Seamus Seagrove III. Some say
'e walks the moors every midnight...
others claim e's been dead for
years...
Indy arrives at the TOP OF THE STAIRS. His hand rests on a SCULPTURE
that is part of the bannister. The sculpture is a bust of BARON
SEAGROVE. Indiana makes his way to the first doorway, where the LIGHT
emanates. The door is WIDE OPEN. A THICK COBWEB covers the entrance.
Indy WIPES away the web, and ENTERS the room. The Policemen DRAW their
pistols. They FOLLOW.
A BEDROOM. Deserted, except for a few pieces of elaborate, ancient
FURNITURE and a large CANOPY BED. Everything in the room is CAKED with
dust and cobwebs...save for the burning CANDLE. It RESTS on the
windowsill, in a sparkling, sterling silver holder. It bathes the room
in ORANGE LIGHT.
Indiana walks TOWARD the candle. Arm outstreched, he prepares to LIFT
it. The Policeman WATCH. SHIVERING. SILENT. Tightly gripping their
PISTOLS. Indy's fingers are INCHES from the candlestick. SUDDENLY...
There is a LOUD WHOOSH! The candle GOES OUT! Indiana DROPS his
flashlight. There is TOTAL DARKNESS. We hear the distant, MANICAL
LAUGH of a man. It ECHOES through the castle. Indy retrieves the
flashlight, clicking it back ON. The candle has DISAPPEARED! The laugh
has SOBSIDED.
MacGowan LOOKS at his men. A TROOBLED look covers the Inspector's
face. MacGowan's eyes DART about the room. Hennesy is GONE!
MACGOWAN
Hennesey?... Hennesey?...
GALBRAITH
(panic)
'E was standin' right 'ere! Just a
second ago... Standin' right beside
me!...
THE SOOND OF A BELL! A thick, dull RINGING! In the DISTANCE! It sends
a CHILL through the men. Indiana DARTS out of the room. FOLLOWING the
sound. The Policemen are right BEHIND HIM.
Indy and the Police HURRY down the stairs. The ringing bell CONTINUES.
MacGowan is CALLING for Hennesey. Indy DASHES to a door along the far
wall. He OPENS it. It leads into a DARK BASEMENT. The sound of the
ringing bell echoes from INSIDE. Indiana ENTERS, motioning for the
others to FOLLOW.
A decrepit, narrow, wooden STAIRWAY leads into the basement. Indy
holds tightly to his FLASHLIGHT. The Policemen are CLUSTERED behind
him, taking each step with extreme caution. The boards CREAK and GROAN
with their every move.
MacGowan LEANS to his side, calling for Hennesey. MacGowan's weight
causes the rotted bannister to SNAP IN TWO! He LOSES his footing!
FALLING off the side of the stairs! Indiana's arm SHOOTS OUT! GRABBING
HOLD of MacGowan's collar. Indy PULLS MacGowan back to SAFETY.
MacGowan CATCHES his breath. SHAKING.
MACGOWAN
Thanks for catchin' me.
INDIANA
I'd rather be catchin' trout.
They CONTINUE down the stairs, arrivifig at the bottom. It is a large,
MUSTY STONE BASEMENT. The slimy walls are covered with a GREEN MOSS.
There are several DOORS along the basement wall. The sound of the
ringing bell is much LOUDER down here.
Indiana moves to the FIRST DOOR. He REACHES for the handle. The
Policemen DRAW their pistols. Indy OPENS the door. A LARGE OBJECT
SHOOTS OUT FROM INSIDE! Rolling TOWARD the men! The policemen FIRE
their guns. SEVERAL SHOTS ring out. The object comes to a STOP. A DEEP
RED LIQUID pours out onto the floor. Indy DIPS his finger into the
liquid. He TASTES.
INDIANA
Interesting blood type...
The Policemen STARE. WIDE EYED. Indy SMILES.
INDIANA
Cabernet sauvignon. 1897.
Indy's flashlight beam shines ahead, ILLUMINATING the 'mysterious
object', a WINE BARREL. And inside the room, is a deserted WINE
CELLAR. Suddenly, a LOUD CREAK echoes through the basement. Galbraith
CRIES OUT.
GALBRAITH
(pointing OFF SCREEN)
Look!
Everyone TURNS. A large STONE DOOR, built into the wall, slowly OPENS.
Indy and the police stare in AMAZEMENT. The door STOPS. Wide OPEN. A
FLICKERING LIGHT glimmers from inside. Indiana WALKS to the opening.
He PEERS into the opening. The Police stay a FEW STEPS behind.
BEHIND THE DOOR
A FAMILY CRYPT. Stone COFFINS, with glass covered tops, line the crypt
walls. Macabre, ghastly RELIGIOUS STATUES decorate the room. Countless
DEATH MASKS cover the ceiling, all carved with that same frighteningly
familiar face... BARON SEAGROVE!
CAMERA DOLLIES to the far corner of the crypt. It STOPS on a CLOSE-UP
of the CANDLESTICK! The EXACT candle from upstairs! Still BURNING! It
rests on one of the coffin's GLASS TOPS.
A TREMBLING MacGowan steps back, away from the crypt. Be BLURTS an
order to his men.
MACGOWAN
Galbraith... You come with me! We'll
search for Hennesey... Out here!
Bottomley... You go with Doctor
Jones...
(finger shaking, points
to inside of crypt)
In there.
MacGowan and Galbraith nearly fall over each other as they SCRAMBLE
away from the crypt. The two DASH OFF into another section of the
basement. Indy SHAKES his head. He ENTERS the crypt. A reluctant and
very frightened Bottomley FOLLOWS.
Indy's flashlight beam dances across the glass COFFIN TOPS. Decayed
CORPSES smile from inside, their hands tightly clutching crucifixes.
Bottomley is HORRIFIED by the sights. Indiana continues AHEAD. He
PASSES the burning candle, moving further into the darkness of the
crypt. The shivering Bottomley stays directly BEHIND Indy. With their
every step, the bell's ringing grows LOUDER... LOUDER...
Indiana and Bottomley arrive in a circular CHAMBER, located at the far
end of the crypt. Here, the ringing bell is nearly DEAFENING. The
sound echoes from ABOVE. We are on the floor of the BELL TOWER.
Indiana SHINES his flashlight UPWARD. The beam stops on a RINGING BELL
that hangs SEVERAL FEET in the air. Inside of the bell, dangling by
his feet, is the DEAD BODY of
HENNESEY! He has REPLACED THE BELL CLAPPER! His body SWINGS back and
forth. It SLAMS into the sides of the bell. Causing the DULL RINGING.
Bottomley SCREAMS. Indiana GRABS Bottomley's arm.
INDIANA
Let's get outta' here.
Indy and Bottomley TURN to the crypt door. It begins to CLOSE! The two
men DASH FORWARD. The door CONTINUES to close. Indy and Bottomley are
only INCHES away...when the door SLAMS SHUT! They PUSH and KICK at the
door. NO GOOD. It WON'T BUDGE. A PANICKED Bottomley calls for help.
BOTTOMLEY
Inspector MacGowan! Galbraith! Open
the door!
Using his flashlight, Indy SCANS the door, looking for a CRACK,
another way OUT. Indy NUDGES Bottomley.
INDIANA
(motioning to candle)
I need more light.
Bottomley HURRIES to the candle. He REACHES OUT. There is a LOUD
WHOOSH! The candle flame GOES OUT! Followed by TOTAL DARKNESS! Indy
TURNS from the door.
INDIANA
Bottomley?...
NO answer. Indy SHINES his flashlight toward the area. The candle is
GONE. There is NO SIGN of Bottomley. Indiana takes a STEP FORWARD.
INDIANA
Bottomley?...
AGAIN, no answer. Indy SWEEPS the flashlight beam across the room. It
PASSES one of the coffins...then SHOOTS BACK! Indy is met with a
SHOCKING SIGHT!
BOTTOMLEY LIES INSIDE THE COFFIN! DEAD! His face twisted in a GHOULISH
SMILE. All of his bones BROKEN. His hands are wrapped around a
CRUCIFIX. Indy STARES in horror. There is a SOUND. FOOTSTEPS. There is
SOMEONE ELSE in here. Indy's flashlight beam DARTS around the crypt.
There is NO SIGN of anyone.
INDIANA
Who is it?... Who's there?...
The same crazed LAUGH of a man echoes through the crypt. A CHILLED
Indy TURNS BACK to the door. He is startled to find the crypt door
COVERED WITH A THICK SHEET OF ICE!
Indy REACHES OUT. He TOUCHES the sparkling, green ice. He SNAPS back
his hand. His fingers are BURNT.
MacGowan and Galbraith are OUTSIDE of the crypt door. They PULL at the
door's metal handles. Trying to OPEN IT. But the door WON'T MOVE.
MacGowan CALLS through the door.
MACGOWAN
Doctor Jones! Try to push!
Indy ANSWERS, taking a STEP BACK.
INDIANA
Can't! There's some kinda' hot ice
coverin' the...
Indiana suddenly FALLS! The floor has DISAPPEARED FROM BENEATH HIM!
Indy manages to GRAB HOLD of a stone coffin. His fingers tightly GRIP
the coffin's edge. Indiana LOOKS DOWN. Beneath him, is a SEVERAL
HUNDRED FOOT DROP INTO TOTAL DARKNESS!
Indy tries to PULL HIMSELF UP. The coffin's ancient stone begins to
CRUMBLE. Large chunks and pieces FALL from Indy's grasp. He is LOSING
HIS GRIP.
Seconds before he plummets into the abyss, Indiana REACHES inside of
the coffin. He clutches onto a CORPSE'S ARM! Using the arm, Indy
SWINGS DOWNWARD.
At the precise moment, Indiana RELEASES the dead arm. He LANDS on a
ROCKY LEDGE. Located only a few feet BELOW the open crypt floor. Indy
STANDS on the ledge. SAFE. He SMILES. RELIEVED. Suddenly, the ledge
SNAPS!
Indiana FALLS! His body DROPS hundreds of feet into the blackness. A
MOMENT passes. Then... WE HEAR A SPLASH!
BOTTOM OF THE HOLE!
A POOL OF WATER! Surrounded by rocky, cavernous WALLS. Indiana's hat
FLOATS on the water's surface. Indy POPS OUT of the water, bobbing up
beside the hat. Indy REACHES for the hat. Suddenly, a FISH flaps out
of the water. The fish GOBBLES UP one of the hat's live baits and
disappears back underwater. Indy SMIRKS.
INDIANA
NOW they bite!
Indy attempts to PULL himself out of the water. There is a LOUD SOUND.
Grinding METAL. Rattling CHAINS. Indy's eyes DART to his side.
TWO HORIZONTAL METAL GATES EJECT FROM THE CAVERN WALLS! They SHOOT
across the water! Like LIGHTNING! They're headed TOWARD each other...
and Indy's HEAD!
Indy DIVES underwater. THE GATES SNAP SHUT! Less than an INCH above
the water's surface! Indy ATTEMPTS to resurface. The closed gate STOPS
HIM. He CLUTCHES the grating, trying to MOVE the gate. It's TOO
STRONG! Indy STRUGGLES for air. NO GOOD. There isn't enough SPACE.
He's going to DROWN!
UNDERWATER
In desperation, Indy SWIMS downward. Looking for an ALTERNATE ESCAPE.
But there is NO BOTTOM in sight. Indy's eyes BULGE. His face loses
COLOR. Only a few precious SECONDS OF LIFE remain...when suddenly, he
SPOTS SOMETHING. A SMALL TUNNEL. Built into the CAVERN WALL. Indiana
hurriedly SWIMS to the tunnel. He BOLTS inside.
A WATER FOUNTAIN. A large, THREE TIERED stone structure. Instead of
the familiar carvings of angels and beautiful maidens, this fountain
is surrounded with water spewing DEMONS, GARGOYLES and hellish BEASTS.
CAMERA DOLLIES TO A LARGE METAL DRAIN, located inside of the
fountain's base. The drain cover begins to TURN. Suddenly FLIPPING
OPEN! Indiana CRAWLS out of the opening. He GULPS at the air. COLOR
returns to his face. LIFE returns to his body. Indy RISES to his feet.
He finds himself STANDING in the fountain.
INDY'S POV
He is inside of a BANQUET ROOM. The sprawling room is beautifully
DECORATED in Victorian dignity. The room is IMMACULATE. Not one SPECK
of dust. Two Medieval SUITS OF ARMOR adorn one wall. A gargantuan
crystal CHANDELIER hangs above a long, mahogany BANQUET TABLE.
At the far end of the table, sits a shriveled, white haired ELDERLY
MAN. It is BARON SEAMUS SEAGROVE III, the fellow whose likeness
appeared in every piece of artwork. Baron Seagrove is CALMLY eating
his dinner. A bloated ROASTED PIG rests on a silver platter before
him. The same candle we saw burning in the upstairs room and the
family crypt, now RESTS on the table. Directly BESIDE the Baron.
Two powerful, muscular MASTIFFS are tied to Baron Seagrove's chair.
Teeth BARED. Eyes AELAZE. The hounds FIGHT for a scrap of meat.
Indiana stares in BEWILDERMENT at the new surroundings. He STEPS OUT
of the fountain. Baron Seagrove seems UNAWARE of Indy's presense.
Indiana WALKS TOWARD the Baron.
INDIANA
Excuse me, sir...? Hello...?
Baron Seagrove DOES NOT look up from his plate. Indy moves CLOSER. He
speaks LOUDER.
INDIANA
Canyou hear me?...
CLOSE-UP: BENEATH THE TABLE
Baron seagrove's hand nonchalantly UNTIES the Mastiff's bindings.
INDIANA
still WALKS toward the table. The Baron continues to IGNORE him. Indy
is ANNOYED.
INDIANA
Listen, pal... There are two dead
Policemen upstairs and...
The Mastiffs LEAP forward. COMING at Indiana. He tries to GET AWAY.
TOO SLOW. The hounds are UPON HIM. TEARING. CLAWING. BITING. They DRAG
Indy to the floor.
Baron Seagrove continues to ENJOY his dinner, seemingly OBLIVIOUS to
the scene before him.
Indiana FIGHTS for his life. The VICIOUS dogs tear at his clothing and
skin. Indy SPOTS something. On the wall ABOVE. Hanging amidst a
display of stuffed animal heads, is a HUNTER'S TRUMPET. Indy STRUGGLES
to his knees. Trying to REACH for the horn. But the dogs are still
BITING. CLAWING. WEAKENING Indiana.
Indy's fingers are INCHES from the horn. The Mastiffs' sharp claws RIP
at his arm. But Indy manages to SNATCH the trumpet. He quickly moves
the horn to his LIPS. He BLOWS. HARD. A HIGH, PIERCING NOTE fills the
air. The dogs respond to the SOUND. They HALT. STOPPING their attack.
For a MOMENT.
Tattered and bruised, Indiana LEAPS to his feet. He DROPS the horn. He
RUNS.
The Mastiffs come to their SENSES. They DART after Indy. Mouths
FOAMING.
Baron Seagrove continues to DINE, still IGNORING the action.
Indy runs to a VELVET CURTAIN. He GRABS HOLD of a long, thick rope
that is attached to the curtain. Indiana TEARS the curtain from the
wall. A large STAINED GLASS WINDOW is behind the curtain.
The FIRST MASTIFF leaps at Indy. Indiana quickly DRAPES the curtain
OVER the hound. Indy ties a large KNOT in the open curtain end. The
dog is TRAPPED.
Indy TURNS. The SECOND MASTIFF is only a FEW FEET AWAY. BARRELLING
toward Indy. Indiana HOPS to the window ledge. He OPENS the window.
The Mastiff LEAPS UPWARD! Indiana JUMPS OUT OF THE WINDOW! The dog
FOLLOWS Indy, also JUMPING OUT OF THE WINDOW!
Baron Seagrove pours himself a glass of WINE. A very ANGRY Indiana
walks toward the Baron.
INDIANA
Chow time's over, mister. You better
start talkin'.
The Baron still IGNORES Indiana.
INDIANA
There's a lot of strange things
happening around here...
A SUIT OF ARMOR, located a few feet behind Indy, suddenly TWITCHES.
Its arm LOWERS. Its head slowly TURNS.
Indiana still walks TOWARD the Baron, who is only concerned with
spreading butter on his bread. Indy SHOUTS.
INDIANA
...and I want some answers! Do you
hear me?
(louder)
I want some answers! Now!
There is a LOUD CREAK OF METAL. A huge, sharp BATTLE AXE SHOOTS INTO
FRAME! SWINGING toward Indy's head! Indiana SPINS. The axe is only
INCHES from his face. Indy LEAPS BACK. WHOOSH! The axe SLICES through
the air. JUST MISSING Indy. The shaken Indiana is SHOCKED to see
A GLISTENING, BLACK SUIT OF ARMOR! The black knight is nearly SEVEN
FEET TALL! It has COME TO LIFE and is walking TOWARD Indy. The black
knight is WILDLY swinging the battle axe. Indiana continues to STEP
BACK... BACK... Unbeknownst to Indy, his steps are leading him toward
ANOTHER SUIT OF ARMOR! Also over seven feet tall, this armor is made
of a SILVERY, WHITE METAL! As Indy moves CLOSER, the WHITE KNIGHT
OPENS ITS ARMS! When Indy is within reach, the white knight LOCKS its
powerful arms around Indy's chest! Indiana TRIES to break free. NO
GOOD. The white knight's grip is TOO TIGHT. Indy is TRAPPED!
The black knight still COMES TOWARD Indiana. Its frenzied axe SWINGS
back and forth. Indy still STRUGGLES with the white knight's bone
crunching grip.
The black knight is only a FEW FEET from Indy. Its deadly axe blade
INCHES from Indy's face. Indiana MOVES FAST. He JERKS his body
forward. This FLIPS the white knight off its feet! OVER Indy's head.
The white knight FLIES INTO the black knight. CRASH! This sends both
knights FALLING to the floor.
Indiana SHOOTS to his feet. The two knights LEAP to their feet. They
CHASE Indy. The black knight armed with his AXE, the white knight
armed with a long, sharp SWORD!
Baron Seagrove SPOONS another helping of boiled potatoes onto his
plate.
Indy snatches a SHIELD and SWORD from a nearby wall display. Ready to
FIGHT. The knights are UPON HIM. Indiana battles BOTH knights. He
DEFENDS the bludgeoning battle axe with his shield, and SWORDFIGHTS
the other knight! THRASH! CLANG! The sound of HEAVY METAL fills the
room!
Indy's sword STRIKES the white knight's thick chest. The sword SNAPS
IN TWO. In the confusion, Indy's shield is KNOCKED from his hand by
the powerful battle axe. Indy is DEFENSLESS.
The two metal giants RAISE their weapons. HIGH. AIMING for Indy's
head. The two knights SWING! Indy DIVES to the floor! The knights
CAN'T STOP their weapons in time... CRUNCH! They deliver a HARD BLOW
to each other! The woozy knights WOBBLE and SPIN. In a momentary DAZE.
Indiana JUMPS to his feet.
The BLACK KNIGHT hisses. FURIOUS. He DASHES after Indiana. The WHITE
KNIGHT is still REELING from the blow.
Seeing the black knight in HOT PURSUIT, Indy searches for a WEAPON. He
spots the curtain's long, thick ROPE. LYING on the floor.
The black knight is nearly UPON Indy. AXE RAISED! Indiana GRABS the
rope. He SPINS. FACING the knight. Indy SNAPS HIS WRIST! A LOUD CRACK!
The rope SHOOTS FORWARD! Not unlike Indiana's familiar WHIP!
The rope WRAPS itself around the black knight's neck. Indy JERKS the
whip forward. HARD. This sends the knight FLYING THROUGH THE AIR! The
knight crashes into the stone FOONTAIN! Several of the fountain's
sculptures SHATTER into pieces. The dazed, dented black knight
ATTEMPTS to stand...but LOSES his footing. The knight FALLS backward.
Into the fountain's WIDE DRAIN OPENING! Its HEAVY ARMOR causes the
knight to SINK. DISAPPEARING into the hole. Into the POOL OF WATER.
Indy CATCHES HIS BREATH. The white knight's SWORD SWINGS INTO FRAME!
SLICING through Indiana's jacket! Indy JUMPS BACK. The vicious white
knight COMES toward him.
Indiana TURNS to run. Finding himself at the BANQUET TABLE. Face to
face with the ROASTED PIG. A few feet away, Baron Seagrove CONTINUES
to dine. The white knight raises his sword ABOVE Indy. WHOOSH! The
sword begins to swing DOWN! Indiana DUCKS and DODGES the deadly blows.
Instead of carving Indiana, the knight's sword manages to SLICE
perfect sections of the roasted pig. The satisfied Baron HELPS HIMSELF
to a freshly carved slice of pork.
Indiana LEAPS onto the table top. Trying to ESCAPE the living suit of
armor. But the white knight CLIMBS up onto the table. FOLLOWING Indy.
The sword slashing knight PURSUES Indy along the table top. Indy
GLANCES upward. To the heavy CHANDELIER. Indy SMILES. A PLAN. He
continues to STEP BACKWARD. Leading the knight DIRECTLY BELOW the
chandelier.
At the precise moment, Indy picks up a STERLING SILVER PLATE from the
table top. Indy WHISKS the plate in the air. Toward the ROPE that
holds the chandelier. The spinning plate SEVERS the rope. The
chandelier FLIES DOWNWARDl! CRASHING ON TOP of the white knight! The
knight lies BENEATH the chandelier. MOTIONLESS. The sword DROPS from
its lifeless hand. Onto the TABLE TOP.
Indy takes the knight's SWORD. Eyes on FIRE, sword OUTSTRETCHED,
Indiana WALKS across the table top. HEADED for Baron Seagrove.
The Baron prepares to take ANOTHER BITE of his food. THE SWORD SHOOTS
INTO FRAME! The tip of the blade RESTS upon Baron Seagrove's rubbery
throat. Indiana SNARLS.
INDIANA
Haven't you had enough?
Baron Seagrove finally LOOKS at Indiana. The Baron LOWERS his fork.
His face twists into an EERIE GRIN. He begins LAUGHING. It's the SAME
MANIACAL LAUGH we heard earlier. Indy responds by BLOWING OUT the
flame of the mysterious candle.
The room's door BURSTS OPEN! INSPECTOR MACGOWAN and GALBRAITH dash
inside. They HURRY to Baron Seagrove. Their PISTOLS aimed at him.
Galbraith HANDCUFFS the Baron. MacGowan looks at the BRUISED, BLOODIED
and TATTERED Indiana Jones.
MACGOWAN
Now you can get back to your
fishing, Doctor Jones.
INDIANA
No chance, Mac. My plane leaves in
the morning. Vacation's over. Gotta'
get back to school.
MACGOWAN
(shakes his head)
'Tis a shame to go home empty
handed...
(smiles, an idea)
Tell ya' what, my friend... I fancy
me'self quite the fisherman...
Tomorrow, I'll go out and catch you
a real beauty, eh?...
INDIANA
(sarcastic smirk)
Right. Send it to me airmail.
MACGOWAN
(incredulous)
Doctor Jones! A MacGowan's word is
truer than...
INDIANA
Yeah, yeah...an angel's kiss. I
know.
They EXIT the room.
Rain SPLATTERS the window of this cramped, CLUTTERED room. Crooked
stacks of dog eared TEXTBOOKS and PAPERS nearly reach the ceiling. The
spindly bookshelves are stuffed with various ARCHEOLOGICAL RELICS and
INSTRUMENTS: animal and bird skeletons, fossils, primitive statues,
etc. Sitting at a small wooden desk, amidst a mountain of TERM PAPERS,
is INDIANA JONES. Indy is WEARING a brown three piece suit and
circular, wire rimmed glasses. In one hand, he holds a STUDENT SEAT
ASSIGNMENT CARD, as he hurriedly READS through the term papers. He
furiously GRADES each paper.
To make matters worse; the office is CROWDED WITH STUDENTS, with
countless others POURING out into the hallway. All of the students are
ANXIOUS to get inside. They are BADGERING, COMPLAINING and MOANING at
Indy.
TEDDY
Doctor Jones... I took your class
instead of all the others!... I
coulda' had Professor Needles...
Professor Eisenschmidt...
Professor...
ANGELA
You promised. You said you'd have
'em graded by yesterday.
VIRGIL
My paper finished yet? Name's
"Virgil Vektor". That's VIRGIL.
(spelling it out)
Capital V... I... R...
JULIA
My parents paid good money to send
me here. You know how much they
shelled out for your class?
CHARLES
He doesn't care about us. He only
wants fame and fortune. We're just a
buncha' peons to him.
VIRGIL
VEKTOR. Capital V... E... K...
Indiana continues to grade the papers, trying to IGNORE the verbal
assault. BETSY TUFFET pushes her way to the front. Betsy is Indy's
STUDENT ASSISTANT. She is 21 YEARS OLD, with thick, luxurious black
hair, bright brown eyes and a small framed, athletic body. Betsy is a
TOUGH. BRASH. A BROOKLYN kid. She moves CLOSE to Indy, her hair
brushing his cheek. Indiana is very TENSE, continuously working on the
term papers.
BETSY
Hello, Ind --
(giggle)
Doctor Jones.
INDIANA
Not now, Betsy.
BETSY
LOOK at all of those papers!
INDIANA
Please, I...
BETSY
Want me to come by later? Help you
grade?
INDIANA
Help me grade. Yeah. Sure.
BETSY
Goodbye, Ind --
(giggles)
Doctor Jones!
She EXITS. Indy SIGHS. Again, the obnoxious student SHOUTS.
VIRGIL
Didja' get the name? VIRGIL! Capital
V... I... R...
PROFESSOR THAD PRIESTLY enters, pushing Virgil aside. Priestly is a
young, wisecracking, greasy haired AQUAINTANCE of Indy's. He SHOVES a
photograph BENEATH Indy's nose.
PRIESTLY
Moby Dick.
INDIANA
Huh?...
PRIESTLY
(points to photo)
That's what I named 'im. Captain
said it was the biggest fish he ever
saw.
Indiana GLANCES to the photo. It is a picture of Prof. Priestly
dressed in fisherman's outfit, standing on a pier, holding a GIANT
FISH. Indy STEAMS. Priestly gives him a MANLY SLAP to the back.
PRIESTLY
What about you, Jonesey? You were
over in Scotty-land for two weeks...
Didja' catch the big one?...
INDIANA
Look, Priestly... I'm real busy...
Indy is suddenly INTERRUPTED by a HARD SLAP to his face. He LOOKS UP.
A beautiful, blonde student, REBECCA, stands over his desk. She
SCREAMS. FURIOUS.
REBECCA
Two-timing bastard!
Indiana RUBS his jaw. STARTLED. Rebecca CONTINUES.
REBECCA
How could you?!?... My own
Mother?!?... In my own bed?!?...
(slaps him again)
I've had it with you! It's over!
Priestly HIDES his chuckle. Rebecca THROWS a shirt that obviously
belongs to Indiana on the desk and STORMS out of the room. Indy shakes
his head and CONTINUES working. The students are still HARASSING him.
A LOUD VOICE ECHOES through the room.
POSTMAN (O.S.)
Special Delivery! Dr. Indiana Jones!
A burly POSTMAN stands in the doorway, holding a thick, enormous BROWN
ENVELOPE. Indy MOTIONS to the postman. The Postman tries to MAKE his
way through the crowd. Indiana goes back to his grading, but is
suddenly INTERRUPTED BY A LOUD TAPPING NOISE. He LOOKS UP. DEAN CLAUDE
COVENTRY, a stately, elderly gentleman, RAPS a steel ruler on
Indiana's desk. The Dean is UPSET. Very SERIOUS.
DEAN COVENTRY
Doctor Jones, I've had complaints
from several of the students --
The Postman INTERRUPTS, dropping the heavy envelope onto Indy's desk.
The Postman SHOVES a yellow paper in front of Indy.
POSTMAN
Sign here.
Indy SIGNS. Dean Coventry continues LECTURING.
DEAN COVENTRY
They feel that you are ignoring
them, that you are distracted...
INDIANA
(gives Postman the
signed paper)
Me?... Distracted?...
POSTMAN
(staring at Indy's
signature, puzzled)
What's this? "B+"? That's how you
sign your name?
Indy GRABS the paper. He's signed a "B+" on the LINE where his name is
supposed to appear. Indy CROSSES out the grade and signs his name.
Professor Coventry still LECTURES Indiana.
DEAN COVENTRY
Marshall University is not the place
for sloppy behavior...
At that moment, Indy OPENS the envelope! A LARGE AMOUNT OF WATER POURS
OUT! SATURATING the papers on the desk! This is followed by an
ENORMOUS DEAD TROUT! It FLOPS onto Indy's desk. The students exchange
STARTLED and NAUSEOUS glances. Indiana removes a water logged NOTE
from the envelope. It reads, "A MACGOWAN'S WORD IS TRUER THAN AN
ANGEL'S KISS". Indiana uses a TISSUE to WIPE some of the water from
his desk. Dean Coventry SHAKES A FINGER at Indy.
DEAN COVENTRY
I have one final warning for you,
Doctor Jones --
THE PHONE RINGS! INTERRUPTING the Dean! Indiana quickly ANSWERS the
phone. A FUMING Dean Coventry impatiently waits to finish his threat.
Indiana SPEAKS into the receiver.
INDIANA
Yes... Oh, Hello, Marcus... Look,
can you hold on?...
(back to Dean)
You were saying, sir?
DEAN COVENTRY
Either you begin concentrating on
your --
INDIANA
(interrupted by phone)
Yes, Marcus... I'm still here...
Just hold on!
(back to Dean)
I'm very sorry, sir...
DEAN COVENTRY
(boiling)
-- concentrating on your teaching
duties or --
INDIANA
(into phone)
Damn it, Marcus! I'm standing here
with Dean... What?.. Just how
important?...
(listening, impatient)
It is, huh?... Okay. Five minutes.
Yeah. I'll be right over. But this
better be important, Marcus!
Indiana HANGS UP. He gives an EMBARASSED look to the furious, red
faced Dean.
DEAN COVENTRY
You are on probation, Jones! Ten
days! If there is no improvement,
you will be dismissed!
The Dean STORMS OUT of the room. Indiana GATHERS the wet papers. He
begins to EXIT the room, EXPLAINING to the students as he makes his
way through the crowd.
INDIANA
I promise...by tomorrow...I'll have
all of these graded...and DRIED!
Indiana continues making APOLOGIES and EXCUSES. The obnoxious student
again SHOUTS at him.
VIRGIL
VIRGIL VEKTOR! Capital V... I...
R...
INDIANA
(hands him paper)
"F"!
Virgil STARES at his paper, adorned with a large RED "F"! Indiana
EXITS the room.
The large room is filled with skeletons, fossils and statues dating
back to the DAWN OF MAN. Indiana, his arms cluttered with the soaking
term papers, hurriedly enters the museum with MARCUS BRODY. Marcus is
very ANXIOUS. EXCITED. He carries a l6MM METAL FILM CANNISTER beneath
his arm. Indiana is very IMPATIENT. His eyes dart to a full sized
skeleton of a TYRONOSAURUS REX.
INDIANA
This better be important, Marcus...
or the museum will soon be
displaying my bones. My teaching
career is in danger of extinction.
MARCUS
(smiles)
You will not be disappointed,
Indiana.
CUT TO:
CLOSE-UP: AN ANCIENT PAINTING. The watercolor features an upright,
wrinkled face SUN WU KUNG, the STONE MONKEY KING. But the monkey is
NOT made of stone. He appears to be HALF HUMAN... HALF MONKEY. His
face is WISE. His coal black eyes are PENETRATING. He wears a LION
SKIN ROBE, and holds a tall, GOLDEN HOOPED STAFF. Sun Wu Kung stands
amidst a garden of luscious, ripe PEACE TREES. He is surrounded by a
HEAVENLY GLOW, a bright ray of light that emanates from an opening in
the CLOUDS.
MARCUS (O.S.)
...Look familiar?
CAMERA PULLS BACK. We are inside of the museum BOARD ROOM. Marcus
holds the tattered painting before Indiana, who sits at a desk, still
feverishly GRADING the wet term papers. After he finishes each paper,
Indy PINS it to a nearby bulletin board for drying. He GLANCES to the
painting of Sun Wu Kung.
INDIANA
"Sun wu Kung, The Stone Monkey
King". Big deal. That was ten years
ago, Marcus.
(going back to papers,
wanting to change
subject)
Geez! This Heller kid's got the
worst grammar.
MARCUS
Ten years or fifty years. It will
always be in your blood.
INDIANA
(ignoring Marcus)
Don't believe this... He spells
"repeat" with two "E's".
MARCUS
Think back, Indiana. Remember your
desire? Your passion?
INDIANA
(still ignores Marcus)
Kid gets an "A" on content...a "D"
on form.
MARCUS
(angry, slams his fist
on the desk)
Damn it, man! You can't bury those
feelings forever!
Indiana finally LOOKS UP from the papers. He glances at Marcus, then
LOOKS at the painting. CAMERA DOLLIES INTO Indiana's face. He becomes
very SERIOUS. SOMBER. His eyes are EMPTY. Memories of FAILURE fill his
head.
INDIANA
Two years. Nearly two years of my
life...looking for the remains of
that Monkey...a piece of his
legendary Golden Hooped Rod...or
some sign of the Lost City.
(shakes his head)
Nine men perished on the journey.
Rest of us nearly died from
starvation or one of the many
horrible deseases we discovered...
(looks back to papers,
in a near whisper)
We still came back empty handed.
MARCUS
(threading the
projector)
One mustn't give up so easily,
Indiana.
INDIANA
Give up?!?... Marcus, we spent
thirteen months in China!...another
seven in India!...
MARCUS
But none in Africa.
INDIANA
(puzzled expression)
There was no proof...archeological
or anthropological...to indicate
that Sun Wu-Kung ever visited
Africa...
MARCUS
Until now.
Marcus TURNS OFF the room lights.
INDIANA
Hey... My papers...
Marcus STARTS the projector. A BLACK AND WHITE image flickers on the
far wall. We see a PYGMY, standing in what appears to be a grassy
area. The pygmy's name is TYKI. He is ADORABLE. A little Over FOUR
FEET TALL, his body is TAUT, MUSCULAR. His long black hair is SHAGGY,
his eyes are WIDE and BRIGHT. Almost CHILDLIKE. His face is CUTE.
IMPISH. Covered with a very INQUISITIVE expression. Tyki's energy is
BOUNDLESS. He cannot stop MOVING. Standing BESIDE Tyki, is
DR. CLARE CLARKE. 32 years old. A tall, strikingly BEAUTIFUL woman.
She is COMMUNICATING with Tyki in sign language.
MARCUS
The woman is Dr. Clare Clarke. The
famous zoologist. She works in
Africa, studying animals in their
natural habitat.
INDIANA
Very interesting, Marcus. Now if
you'll turn the lights back on --
MARCUS
(continuing)
Three weeks ago, Dr. Clarke
discovered that cute little
fellow... "Tyki"...a pygmy of an
unusual race...unrelated to any
known African tribe...
INDIANA
(bored)
Marcus. The lights.
MARCUS
Dr. Clarke believes that Tyki comes
from the Lost Civilization of Sun
Wu-Kung.
Indiana PAUSES. He STANDS, walking closer to the flickering image.
Suddenly INTERESTED.
INDIANA
What?... But how did Miss --
MARCUS
"Doctor".
INDIANA
"Doctor" Clake. How did she arrive
at such a preposterous hypothesis?
MARCUS
The pygmy speaks in a language that
has no African origins...but bears a
strong resemblance to Chinese.
INDIANA
Means nothing. The rivers of Africa
have been plagued by various
Oriental Pirates and Scavengers
since the 16th Century.
(turns from screen)
Not much evidence, Marcus.
MARCUS
There's more. The pygmy was found
wearing an ornamental peach stone
around his neck...believed to come
from Sun Wu-Kung's legendary Garden
Of Immortal Peaches.
INDIANA
(skeptical)
Marcus, there are countless
undiscovered African tribes...all
with various obscure beliefs and
practices...
(smirks)
One tribe may wear peach stones...
another may wear banana peels...
Indiana WALKS back to his papers. Marcus PAUSES.
MARCUS
There is one final bit of
evidence...
INDIANA
Enlighten me.
MARCUS
The pygmy is over 200 years old.
Indiana ADJUSTS his spectacles. He STARES at the black and white
image. The cute pygmy appears to be in his MID-TWENTIES. He walks to
the CAMERA, STARING into the lens. Tyki examines the camera with
CURIOSITY.
INDIANA
That's impossible.
MARCUS
Dr. Clarke has done a considerable
amount of testing on the pygmy's
clothing...his sandals...everything
was over 200 years old.
INDIANA
(skeptical)
He's probably wearing his Great
Grandfather's stuff.
CAMERA PANS BACK to the projected image. Tyki begins to UNSCREW the
camera lens. The picture goes OUT OF FOCUS. The film RUNS OUT. Marcus
TURNS OFF the projector and flips ON the overhead room lights. Indiana
gives Marcus a PUZZLED look.
INDIANA
What does all of this have to do
with me?
MARCUS
Dr. Clarke wants to mount an
expedition to find the Lost City of
Sun Wu-Kung. She is quite familiar
with your reputation...she'd like
you to come along.
INDIANA
(gathering his papers)
No chance.
MARCUS
There will be money involved... The
museum is willing to fund the
expedition...
INDIANA
Sorry, Marcus. I've burned this
bridge.
Indiana TURNS and begins to WALK out of the room. Marcus CALLS him.
MARCUS
Indiana...
Indy TURNS. He WAVES the papers at Marcus.
INDIANA
Marcus. Please. I've got to finish
these...
MARCUS
You've got to finish something much
more important. You crossed the
threshold over a decade ago...and
it's been tearing at your insides
ever since.
(passionate)
My friend, if there is even one iota
of truth in Dr. Clarke's findings...
then you can lift the veil of
mystery that has surrounded this
Chinese legend for Centuries. You
may uncover the secrets to a Lost
Civilization...and possibly, to
man's never ending search for
immortality.
Indiana STARES at the painting of Sun Wu Kung.
MARCUS
Indiana... Can you afford to pass up
the single most important adventure
of your life?
Indiana has NO ANSWER for Marcus. Indy PICKS up the painting. A
THRILLING expression slowly covers Indiana's face. His eyes GLIMMER.
Filled with a long, lost EXCITEMENT. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS!
CUT TO:
CLOSE UP: THE STACK OF TERM PAPERS
The papers are slightly CRUMPLED. Still WET. A DROP OF WATER hits the
papers. CAMERA PANS UPWARD. BETSY TUFFET, Indy's student assistant,
sits at the desk, grading the papers. She is CRYING. Her falling TEARS
soak the papers. We are INSIDE of Indiana's apartment. LATER that
evening.
INDIANA stands in the background. He is hurriedly PACKING his bags.
His familiar GUN, HAT and WHIP lie on the bed, beside the suitcase.
Indy NOTICES that Betsy is crying. He WALKS to Betsy. Indy puts his
arm on Betsy's shoulder, attempting to COMFORT her. Betsy SNAPS at
Indy.
BETSY
You can't do this to me!
INDIANA
(shaking tears off the
papers)
C'mon, Betsy. Relax. You're gettin'
'em all wet again.
BETSY
You just can't go away...I mean...
Africa is so far away, and...well...
(heartfelt)
I love you, Indy.
INDIANA
Thought we agreed this was s'posed
to be casual...
BETSY
You call what happened last night
"casual".
INDIANA
My dear...a momentary lapse into
passion does not a love affair make.
BETSY
(very upset)
Momentary lapse! So that's all I am
to you!
Betsy SHOOTS to her feet, walking OFF SCREEN.
INDIANA
Betsy... Wait...
Indiana SIGHS. His eye CATCHES one of the termpapers. He begins to
READ, making a few CORRECTIONS.
We see Betsy's HAND removes Indiana's WHIP from the bed.
Indiana continues to CORRECT the papers. Suddenly, there is a CREAKING
NOISE. Indy TURNS. His face goes WHITE. He runs OFF SCREEN.
One end of Indiana's WHIP is attached to an OVERHEAD LAMP. CAMERA PANS
DOWN the whip. The other end has been formed into a NOOSE around
Betsy's neck. Sbe stands on a wooden CHAIR. She KICKS AWAY the chair.
Suddenly GAGGING. Indiana GRABS Betsy in midair. He TAKES the noose
from her neck and PLACES Betsy on the floor.
INDIANA
(angry)
Whatsa' matter with you!... Tryin'
to ruin my whip!...
BETSY
If I can't have you... I don't want
to live.
Indiana TOSSES the whip into his suitcase. He pulls up the chair and
forces Betsy to be SEATED. He pours her a tall glass of BOURBON.
INDIANA
Drink this. You'll feel better.
Indiana WALKS to his suitcase, continuing to pack. His BACK is to
Betsy. She raises the GLASS to her lips. She PAUSES, reading a MESSAGE
on the Bourbon bottle. It reads: DANGER! CONTENTS FLAMMABLE! Betsy
BEAMS. An IDEA. She LIFTS the bottle over her head and begins to DOUSE
her body with the liquid.
Indiana is BUSY folding his clothing. Suddenly, we hear the FLICK OF A
MATCHSTICK! Indy TURNS. He sees the bourbon covered Betsy preparing to
LIGHT HER BODY ON FIRE! Indy DASHES forward. He BLOWS OUT the match,
moments before it SPARKS Betsy's clothing. Indy SHAKES Betsy by the
shoulders.
INDIANA
C'mon, Betsy... Get a hold of
yourself. You're young. There are a
lot of other guys...
BETSY
Not like you.
INDIANA
(succumbing to his ego)
That's true...
(realizing his mistake)
But that's no reason to stop living!
Besides, I'm too old for you. By the
time you're seventy five, I'll be...
(calculates, the thought
of it makes him grimace)
Yeccchhh! I'll be disgusting.
Indiana TURNS and finishes his packing. Betsy SIGHS. She notices an
enormous, STONE AFRICAN URN. The 150 POUND antique sits atop a section
of BOOKSHELVES.
Meanwhile, Indiana makes certain that his gun is PACKED. He places the
familiar HAT on his head and begins to CLOSE the suitcase.
CLOSE UP: THE AFRICAN URN. It is WOBBLING. SHAKING. Moving CLOSER and
CLOSER to the edge of the bookshelves. CAMERA PANS TO THE FLOOR. Betsy
LIES here. Directly BELOW the trembling urn. Betsy SHAKES the
bookshelves, causing the urn to TILT and SHIVER. The urn is nearly
HALFWAY OFF of the edge. If it falls...the urn will CRUSH Betsy's
head.
Indiana STRUGGLES with closing his tightly packed suitcase.
The urn FALLS! HEADED STRAIGHT for Betsy! Indiana SUDDENLY GRABS the
urn. In MIDAIR. Inches before it STRIKES Betsy. Indiana RESTS the urn
on the floor. He HELPS Betsy to her feet. Betsy WRAPS her arms tightly
around Indiana.
BETSY
Don't leave me, Indy!
Indiana PICKS UP his suitcase and tries to WALK to the door. But
Betsy's arms are still TIGHTLY WRAPPED around him. Finally, Indy
STOPS. His eyes BURN through Betsy.
INDIANA
(cruel)
Look... You're just a flighty kid.
Twenty minutes after I walk out this
door, you'll have a date with the
college Romeo. Two hours from now,
you'll be madly in love with him. By
tomorrow, you'll forget I ever
existed.
Hurt, Betsy REMOVES her arms from Indiana. He gives her a QUICK KISS
to the cheek and hurriedly EXITS. Betsy GLARES at the closed door. A
TOUGH, ANGRY expression covers her face.
BETSY
Never underestimate the
determination of a Brooklyn girl,
Doctor Jones. Never.
DISSOLVE TO:
LONG SHOT - AN OCEAN LINER
The SILHOUETTE of the ship sails across the water. A beautiful ORANGE
SKY fills the background.
INDIANA JONES
stands aboard the ship's DECK. It is a typical, 30's LUXURY Ocean
liner, filled with vacationing TOURISTS. Indiana STARES into the
sunrise. His face is a study in CONCENTRATION and INTENSITY. He
anxiously AWAITS his adventure.
DISSOLVE TO:
MAP OF THE WORLD
A MOVING RED LINE traces Indiana's journey across the ocean, toward
AFRICA. The red line comes to a stop at MOZAMBIQUE.
Gutterbuhg walks through the DIMLY LIT lobby, filled with dusty, tacky
African furnishings. He turns a corner, into a NARROW, decrepid
hallway. He STOPS at the last DOORWAY. Room 113. He OPENS the door
with a key and ENTERS.
A SMALL, MUSTY Hotel room. It is furnished with a SINGLE BED, A SOFA,
TWO CHAIRS and A FIRE PLACE. Two BIZARRE AFRICAN STATUES adorn the
fireplace mantle. Gutterbuhg carefully LOCKS the room door. He walks
to the FIREPLACE. He TILTS one of the African statues forward. There
is a mechanical, CREAKING SOUND. Suddenly, the SOFA BEGINS TO MOVE. It
SLIDES a few feet, revealing an OPENING BENEATH THE FLOOR. A STAIRCASE
leads into the opening. Gutterbuhg DESCENDS the stairs.
Gutterbuhg enters a LARGE, BRIGHTLY LIT ROOM. We are inside of A
SECRET NAZI HEADQUARTERS. The room is filled with various
COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT and RADIO TRANSMITTERS. SEVERAL NAZI SOLDIERS
are seated before the equipment, monitoring various radio signals. An
enormous GLASS PANEL covers one wall. THROUGH THE PANEL WE SEE
TWO SPEEDBOATS. LONG. SLEEK. HIGH POWERED. MAHOGANY HULLED. Both
speedboats are adorned with a SWASTIKA. They FLOAT in water, in an
UNDERGROUND, MAN-MADE CHAMBER. Directly BESIDE the speedboats, parked
on a STONE INCLINE, are
TWO AUTOMOBILES. The cars are enormous, beautiful "WOODIES". Equipped
with a RUNNING BOARD and WOOD PANELLED SIDES. The cars GLISTEN. BRAND
NEW.
Gutterbuhg turns to KLAUS, a hulking Nazi who stands in the corner.
Pointing to Klaus' FEET, Gutterbuhg SHOUTS an order to Klaus. CAMERA
PANS to Klaus' feet. The Nazi's BOOT IS UNTIED. A LONG STRING dangles
on the floor. The embarassed Klaus KNEELS and sloppily RE-TIES his
shoe.
Gutterbuhg turns to a Nazi who sits at a RADIO RECEIVER. The Nazi
wears HEADPHONES, LISTENING for a transmission. THE LONG, FRIGHTENING
SHADOW OF A MAN overcomes Gutterbuhg. He TURNS. FEAR covers
Gutterbuhg's face. The shadow RAISES its arm. HEIL HITLER! Gutterbuhg
also RAISES his right arm. But a BIZARRE, MECHANICAL SQUEAK, is caused
by the movement of his arm.
LIEUTENANT WERNER VON MEPEISTO
stands BEFORE Gutterbuhg. Mephisto is a NAZI nightmare. His face is
THICK and BULLISH. His bulging eyes are a reddish BROWN, giving him
the appearance of a DEMON from hell. He has NO FACIAL HAIR. NO
eyebrows. NO eyelashes. Completely BALD. His body is THICK. MUSCULAR.
He is over SIX FEET TALL. He GLARES down at Gutterbuhg.
MEPHISTO
(German, English
subtitles)
Were you successful?
Gutterbuhg gives a TIMID NOD. With trembling fingers, he reaches over
and TURNS UP THE VOLUME of the radio transmission. The voices of
Indiana, Betsy, Clare and Scraggy echo through a TINNY SPEAKER.
Mephisto manages a pleased GRUNT.
MEPHISTO
(German, English
subtitles)
Keep a record of everything that is
said.
Gutterbuhg NUDGES the officer before him. The officer hurriedly begins
to SCRAWL a manuscript of the radio transmission. Mephisto NODS.
MEPHISTO
(German, English
subtitles)
Ever since our battle for the Lost
Ark... The feuhrer has been very
interested in the adventures of
Indiana Jones. Very interested.
CUT TO:
Filled with hand made wooden and bamboo FURNITURE. TYKI, the adorable
PYGMY from Marcus' film, is INSIDE. Tyki is dressed only in a BELTED,
leather loin cloth and SANDALS. He is perched on the floor, working on
a large TAPESTRY. The tapestry depicts a colorful picture of CLOUDS.
The buildings of a LARGE CITY are REFLECTED on the clouds. Tyki
pleasantly SINGS as he does his work.
Upon hearing the cage door OPEN, Tyki LOOKS UP. He SEES Clare. A
JOYOUS SMILE covers his face. The pygmy RUNS to Clare, giving her a
huge HUG and a KISS. Clare INTRODUCES Tyki to the others.
CLARE
Tyki... This is Doctor Jones...
Tyki EXTENDS his right hand. He SHAKES Indiana's hand. Indiana is
CHARMED by the civilized display of friendship. Indy SMILES at Clare.
INDIANA
He's a real gentleman.
CLARE
(shrugs)
Just basic manners. What it takes
most men a lifetime to learn...
Tyki's accomplished in two weeks.
(introduces Scraggy)
This is our guide, Scraggy Brier...
and Miss Bets--
Clare pauses, noticing that Betsy is MISSING. Clare suddenly breaks
into a LAUGH! She points OFF SCREEN. Everyone TURNS.
Everyone CHUCKLES at Betsy's dillemma.
CLARE
It appears that Bonzo is attracted
to Miss Tuffet's Derfume... Eau De
Banana Peel.
Tyki has gone back to his ARTWORK. A FASCINATED Indiana looks over the
pygmy's shoulder.
INDIANA
Where did you find him?...
CLARE
About ten miles from here. We were
on a photographic expedition...in
the thick of the jungle... I heard
sounds. Whimpering. Moaning. I took
a few steps, and found Tyki. He was
lying in a shallow swamp...semi
conscious...a high fever...nearly
dead from exhaustion. He had
obviously been travelling on foot
for many days, over countless
miles... So I brought him back to
the compound...nursed him back to
health...
Indiana STARES at the pygmy. A skeptical look COVERS his face.
INDIANA
Clare, I hate to quibble with your
anthropological abilities...
CLARE
Quibble.
INDIANA
...but if this little fellow is over
200 years old... I mean... What
accounts for his youthful
appearance?...his vitality?...
Clare OPENS a door at the rear of the cage. It LEADS into another
room, directly behind the CAGE. Clare and Indiana ENTER. Scraggy STAYS
behind. He EXCHANGES a friendly smile with Tyki. Meanwhile, in the
BACKGROUND, we see BETSY and the CHIMPANZEE. They ROLL BY on the
ground. Still WRESTLING.
CLOSE UP: PEACE STONE.
A FRUIT FLY crawls along the peach pit's surface.
CLARE (O.S.)
Tyki was wearing this when I found
him.
CAMERA PULLS BACK. We are in a SMALL, STERILE ROOM. The peach stone
rests on a TABLE. Indiana and Clare STAND over the stone. Indy PICKS
UP the stone, examining it. An annoying FRUIT FLY buzzes around Indy's
head. CAMERA PANS DOWN to Indiana's trouser leg. The RADIO TRANSMITTOR
is still attached to his pants. The tiny bug's eyes BLINK. RED.
CUT TO:
SGT. GUTTERBUHG.
He stands inside of Nazi Headquarters, huddled over the RADIO. The
VOICES of Indiana and Clare echo over the speaker. Gutterbuhg
FURIOUSLY transcribes the conversation.
CLARE (O.S.)
Dr. Jones, you are obviously
familiar with the legend of Sun Wu-
King's Garden of Immortal Peaches?...
INDIANA (O.S.)
A bite from the fruit of that peach
tree would give a person eternal
life...make them forever young...
The vicious Gutterbuhg SMILES. CAMERA PANS to his notebook. Gutterbuhg
underlines the words "FOREVER YOUNG".
CUT BACK TO:
INDIANA
STUDYING the peach pit. The fruit fly continues to BUZZ around
Indiana's head.
INDIANA
There's nothing unusual about this
...nothing to indicate that it's
from Sun Wu Kung's garden...
The fruit fly LANDS on Indiana's neck. Indy SMACKS the fly! KILLING
it! A SHOCKED Clare RUNS to Indiana. She GRABS his hand and GENTLY
removes what remains of the fruit fly. She GLARES at Indiana. FURIOUS.
CLARE
This fruit fly had a normal life-
span of TWENTY FOUR HOURS.
(frustrated sigh)
As an experiment...the fly was put
in this room...alone...with only the
peach stone to sustain its
existence. The fly stayed alive for
THREE WEEKS.
(looks at dead fly)
Until now.
She FLICKS the'fly against the wall. Indy gives an EMBARASSED SHRUG.
INDIANA
Sorry.
Indiana and Clare are suddenly INTERRUPTED by the sound of Scraggy and
Tyki's LAUGHTER. This is followed by the two of them having a
DISCUSSION! In Tyki's FOREIGN TONGUE! Clare and Indy exchange a
SHOCKED GLANCE and DASH out of the room.
Scraggy and Tyki are having a CONVERSATION. Clare POINTS to Scraggy,
giving a PUZZLED LOOK to Indiana.
CLARE
He understands him?
INDIANA
(nods)
Scraggy knows hundreds of
languages... He's the best guide in
Africa.
(turns to Scraggy)
Ask Tyki where he came from.
Scraggy NODS and ASKS Tyki. Tyki ANSWERS and POINTS to the painting of
the clouds. Scraggy TRANSLATES.
SCRAGGY
He say... "I come from 'Land Of City
On Clouds'".
INDIANA
(puzzled)
Huh?... What the hell's that s'posed
to mean?
(to Scraggy)
Can he take us there?
Scraggy ASKS Tyki. Tyki ANSWERS. He and Scraggy LAUGH hysterically.
Scraggy LOOKS at Indiana.
SCRAGGY
He say if he could... He would go
back!
Tyki OFFERS some more information to Scraggy. Scraggy TRANSLATES.
SCRAGGY
He say "Pai Cho" may help you.
Indiana's eyes WIDEN. STARTLED. AMAZED. Clare LOOKS at Indy. PUZZLED.
CLARE
"Pai Cho"?
INDIANA
The Sacres Proverbs and Writings of
Sun Wu Kung.
(anxious, looking at
Scraggy)
His disciples always carry the Pai
Cho with them...
Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The pygmy NODS and REMOVES his belt. We see that
the thick belt actually unravels into a CLOTH SCROLL. Tyki KISSES the
scroll and GIVES it to Scraggy. Scraggy nervously OPENS the scroll. It
is filled with countless ANCIENT CHINESE WRITINGS and PROVERBS.
Indiana STARES over Scraggy's shoulder.
INDIANA
Can you translate it?...
Scraggy NODS. Indiana's eyes ANXIOUSLY scan the document. He is
BREATHLESS. EXCITED. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS.
Suddenly, BETSY AND THE CHIMPANZEE FALL INTO FRAME! ON TOP OF THE
SCROLL! Bonzo STRADDLES Betsy, trying to move his lips TOWARD hers!
She is SCREAMING!
BETSY
Get...him...off...of...me...!
Bonzo moves its lips to Betsy and gives her a BIG KISS! SMACK! Betsy
GRIMACES. Finally, Clare begins to make BIZARRE MONKEY HAND MOTIONS
and SOUNDS. Bonzo TURNS. He UNDERSTANDS Clare. She continues to
COMMUNICATE with the chimp, until Bonzo turns and RUNS out of the
cage! Indiana and Scraggy exchange an IMPRESSED GLANCE. Betsy WIPES
the kiss from her lips.
CUT TO:
CLOSE UP: A FLASHING NEON SIGN.
It reads: "DASHIELL'S AMERICAN BAR". It adorns the front of a stylish,
Mozambique NIGHTCLUB.
DIMLY lit. SMOKY. Filled with cloth covered TABLES and ornamental,
AFRICAN furnishings. A 9 piece JAZZ BAND plays SWING TUNES. A few
couples SWAY on the dance floor. The place is swarming with NAZIS.
Many are SEATED at the bar. Others are scattered at various TABLES
throughout the restaurant. Some stand in CORNERS. Lurking in the
SHADOWS. They are all looking in one direction, watching one man...
INDIANA JONES.
Indy sits with Scraggy, Clare and Betsy, at a table near the REAR of
the restaurant. They are eating DINNER. But Indy, Scraggy and Clare
are more interested in the Stone Monkey SCROLLS. A very NERVOUS
Scraggy TRANSLATES. Indiana, wearing his spectacles, takes pages and
pages of NOTES. Searching for a CLUE. An INTERESTED Clare reads over
Indiana's shoulder. Betsy tries to become INCLUDED in the discussion.
But everyone IGNORES her. Scraggy continues to TRANSLATE.
SCRAGGY
"Sun Wu Kung run like fire,
He journey to Many Monkey Land,
To build his final empire."
BETSY
Who's Sun Wu-Kung?
INDIANA
(ignoring Betsy, to
Scraggy)
Many Monkey Land... That's a
definite reference to Africa.
BETSY
Africa?... He journeyed to
Africa?...
CLARE
(also ignores Betsy, to
Indiana)
That confirms our suspicions that he
may have formed his Civilization
here...
BETSY
What civilization?
INDIANA
(angry, to Betsy)
Betsy. Keep your trap shut. This
doesn't concern you.
BETSY
(insulted)
Fine. Terrific. Who cares about this
stuff anyway! We're in a nightclub.
We should be havin' fun.
(grabs Indiana's hand)
C'mon, Indy. Let's dance.
INDIANA
Later.
BETSY
What a buncha' stiffs!
(condescending, to
Clare)
Bet you can't dance.
CLARE
Quite the contrary...I spent several
months studying dance.
BETSY
Oh yeah? Whattayou' know?... The
Bunny Hop?... The Jitterbug?...
CLARE
(shakes her head)
The Bondogea. The Kyebe Kyebe. The
Dungumaro.
BETSY
Huh?
CLARE
African Tribal dances.
BETSY
Never heard of 'em.
CLARE
Of course not. They're beyond the
spectrum of your microscopic world.
Insulted, Betsy GOBBLES down her glass of wine and TURNS back to
Indiana, who is still deeply CONCENTRATING on the scrolls.
UNDER THE TABLE
Betsy's FOOT reaches across the floor. It RESTS on Indy's leg. Betsy
begins to RUB against Indiana's trouser leg. The red eyed MECHANICAL
BUG is still attached to Indiana's trousers.
INDIANA
GLARES at Betsy. Clare REACHES for her cup of coffee. She NOTICES that
the coffee cup trembles SLIGHTLY. Clare GLANCES beneath the table, and
sees Betsy RUBBING Indy's leg. Clare is DISGUSTED.
ABOVE the table, Clare shoots a scowl of DISAPPROVAL at Indy. A
FLUSTERED Indy tries to explain...but is suddenly INTERRUPTED by a
hand on his shoulder. It is DASHIELL, the suave, HANDSOME owner of the
restaurant. Dashiell gives a CaARMING SMILE to everyone at the table.
DASHIELL
Enjoying your dinners?...
Everyone NODS, expressing their thanks. Dashiell LEANS close to
Indiana and WHISPERS.
DASHIELL
Watch yourself, sport. Most of the
talk here tonight is about you. And
it isn't good.
Indiana's eyes DART around the room. He sees the VARIOUS NAZIS.
WATCHING him. Indy gives a CONFIDENT SMILE. A WORRIED Dashiell
continues WHISPERING to Indiana.
DASHIELL
I don't know what you've done to the
Nazis. But they are certainly no
friends of yours.
CUT TO:
Indiana, Scraggy and Clare CONTINUE to excitedly STUDY the map. A
NEGLECTED Betsy POURS herself the last of the wine. She is very DRUNK,
singing along with the band's version of Cole Porter's "Night and
Day".
BENEATH THE TABLE
Betsy continues to RUB her FOOT against Indiana's leg.
INDIANA
tries to IGNORE Betsy's playing. Scraggy continues to TRANSLATE the
scroll.
SCRAGGY
"With his Golden Hooped Rod,
And its powerful lightning rays,
Sun Wu Kung build Water Curtain Cave,
Where he live for 500 days."
CLARE
The Golden Hooped Rod?
INDIANA
A heavenly staff with many different
powers...most notably, it had the
ability to transform itself into
hundreds of objects...
(staring)
It remains the most priceless
treasure of Sun Wu Kung's empire.
CLARE
And what is the...the Water Curtain
Cave?
INDIANA
Sun Wu Kung's legendary hideout...an
enormous secret cave, hidden behind
a running waterfall.
Clare again REACHES for her coffee. The cup and saucer are still
TREMBLING. Clare PEEKS under the table, and again SEES Betsy's foot
RUBBING Indiana's leg. Clare gives a revolted GRUMBLE. Indiana
EXCITEDLY explains Scraggy's translation.
INDIANA
This proves that the Water Curtain
Cave exists in Africa...
(to Scraggy)
Does it mention anything about Sun
Wu Kung's travels?
SCRAGGY
(reading scroll)
Only place called..."Twisted Snake
Water".
INDIANA
The Zarnbesi River! It has a
reputation for its deadly water
snakes...
CLARE
It would have been Sun Wu Kung's
logical path.
INDIANA
(confident, anxious)
It will also be our logical path.
Clare SMILES.
BENEATH THE TABLE
Betsy's foot CONTINUES to rub Indiana's leg. Finally Indy reaches
down, trying to SLAP Betsy's foot away! But Indy's hand STUMBLES upon
something else. The MECHANICAL BUG. Indy TRIES to remove the bug. But
the tiny device WON'T BUDGE.
ABOVE TABLE
Indiana's hand is buried beneath the table, STRUGGLING to remove the
bug. To Clare, it appears as if Indy is PLAYING with Betsy's foot.
Clare gives an INCREDULOUS look to Indiana.
CLARE
Please try to control that monstrous
libido of yours!
Indiana finally REMOVES the mechanical bug. He LIFTS it above the
table. EXAMINING it. Clare is about to ASK a question. Indy INDICATES
for her to "Shhhh". He COVERS the bug and WHISPERS to the others.
INDIANA
We have to get back to the compound.
Tyki may be in danger.
Indiana, Clare and Scraggy HURRY from the table. A TIPSY Betsy
Follows. Indiana passes the JAZZ BAND. He nonchalantly DROPS the
mechanical bug into the trumpet player's HORN! The trumpet player
hits a PIERCING HIGH NOTE!
CUT T0:
NAZI HEADQUARTERS
The Nazi wearing the radio HEADPHONES emits a LOUD SCREAM! His
eardrums BURSTING with the trumpet sound!
CUT TO:
Gutterbuhg, Klaus and Helmut LEAD the bound and gagged Tyki OUT OF THE
COMPOUND. They keep their LUGERS at his back. Suddenly, Klaus TRIPS
over something. A FAWN. Klaus GROWLS. He SHOUTS a German order to
Helmut, who GRABS a tight hold of the baby deer. Klaus AIMS his luger
at the fawn's head. Gutterbuhg and Helmut exchange a chilling LAUGH.
Tyki stares in HORROR. Klaus CLICKS the luger...ready to SHOOT...
There is an earth shattering CRACK! A WHIP SHOOTS INTO FRAME! The whip
WRAPS ITSELF around the luger! TEARING the gun OUT of Klaus' hand! The
fawn breaks FREE and RUNS OFF. The Nazis exchange a SHOCKED glance.
They TURN and SEE
INDIANA JONES! He stands a FEW FEET away. Holding the WHIP. Indiana
POINTS to Tyki, angrilly SHOUTING to the Nazis.
INDIANA
Get your hands off him.
Gutterbuhg LAUGES. He POINTS his finger at Indiana. Indy is PUZZLED.
The finger begins to SHOOT! RAPID MACHINE GUN FIRE! Indy DIVES for
cover.
Holding Tyki CAPTIVE, the Nazis TURN and begin to RUN out of the
compound. Indy gets to his FEET. He LIFTS his gun. Ready to SHOOT. But
the Nazis are running behind SEVERAL ROWS OF CAGES, filled with
ANIMALS. Indiana CAN'T SHOOT. He dashes back OUTSIDE.
Dashiell's speedboat BURSTS through another wall. The boat SKIDS
across the warehouse floor. SCREECHING TO A STOP! A SHAKEN Dashiell
gets out. Indy RUNS to the window.
INDIANA'S POV
The NAZI SPEEDBOAT shoots out of the docks, ESCAPING across the water.
Indiana grabs his WHIP. He KICKS OPEN the warehouse window. He SNAPS
his wrist. CRACK. The whip SHOOTS forward, ATTACHING ITSELF TO THE
REAR OF THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! Indy firmly GRIPS his end of the whip. The
whip TIGHTENS. WHOOSH! Indiana is PULLED out of the window.
Gutterbuhg exchanges a VICTORIOUS laugh with Rudolph, the speedboat
driver, thinking they have LOST Indiana. A frightened Tyki LOOKS BACK.
His eyes suddenly fill with HOPE. Gutterbuhg TURNS. His mouth DROPS
OPEN.
Indiana uses his WHIP to WATER SKI BEHIND THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! A red
faced Gutterbuhg SLAMS his fist on the dashboard. He removes a SHARP
KNIFE. He hurriedly begins to SLICE through Indy's whip. Trying to
BREAK THE CONNECTION.
Indiana AIMS his pistol at Gutterbuhg. But suddenly, a SHOT WHIZZES by
Indy's head. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. COMING from behind.
Indy TURNS. A SECOND NAZI SPEEDBOAT is in HOT PURSUIT! There are FIVE
NAZIS inside. Armed with PISTOLS and RIFLES. All FIRING SHOTS at
Indiana.
Meanwhile, Gutterbuhg's knife continues to SLICE through Indy's whip.
Only a FEW THREADS remain.
Indiana performs some EXPERT WATER SKIING. SWERVING. SPINNING.
JUMPING. All in an attempt to AVOID the flying bullets from behind.
Suddenly, Indy's whip SNAPS! Indiana FALLS UNDERWATER! Directly IN THE
PATH of the seccnd Nazi speedboat!
Tyki HIDES his eyes. Gutterbuhg LAUGHS. It appears that Indiana has
met a GRISLY DEATH.
The Nazis in the second speedboat are DELIGHTED. SHAKING each other's
hands. CAMERA PANS TO BELOW the speedboat. We move UNDERWATER. SOUND
TRACK MUSIC SOARS! We see INDIANA. Very much ALIVE. He STRADDLES THE
BOTTOM OF THE SPEEDING BOAT! HOLDING ON with all of his strength!
Indiana CLIMBS toward the side of the speedboat, BATTLING the pressure
of the rushing water.
CAMERA FOLLOWS INDIANA, OUT OF THE WATER, AS HE CLIMBS ABOARD THE
SECOND SPEEDBOAT. The four Nazis are LAUGHING. TALKING. Their backs
turned to the APPROACHING Indiana. Moving like LIGHTNING, Indy GRABS
one of the Nazis and TOSSES HIM OVERBOARD. With a SWIFT PUNCH to the
stomach and jaw, Indy sends another Nazi INTO THE WATER. The other two
Nazis TACKLE Indy. They FALL to the deck. FIGHTING.
Gutterbuhg LOOKS BACK. SHOCKED that Indy is still alive. Gutterbuhg
GROWLS. FRUSTRATED. His eyes suddenly LIGHT. He SPOTS something.
AHEAD.
TWO GARGANTUAN OCEAN LINERS
are MOVING TOWARD EACH OTHER. Coming TOGETHER. There is an OPENING
between the two ships, that continues to get SMALLER, as the ships
move CLOSER.
Gutterbuhg SMILES. An IDEA. He orders Rudolph to DRIVE THROUGH THE
OPENING.
In the second speedboat, the Nazis have OVERCOME Indiana. One Nazi
PINS Indy down. The other removes a THICK METAL CHAIN from his neck. A
RED SWASTIKA dangles from the chain. The Nazi WRAPS the chain around
Indy's neck. He begins to STRANGLE Indiana.
Gutterbuhg's speedboat MOVES TOWARD the ocean liners. The opening
between the two ships continues to SHRINK. Getting SMALLER...and
SMALLER...
The second speedboat is DIRECTLY BEHIND Gutterbuhg. The Nazis are
STRANGLING Indiana. The color begins to LEAVE Indy's face. He GASPS
for air.
The opening between the two Ocean liners continues to get SMALLER...
Less than TEN FEET WIDE. Gutterbuhg's speedboat is only a FEW FEET
AWAY.
Through his fluttering eyes, Indiana SEES Gutterbuhg's speedboat
headed for the ocean liners. Indiana is nearly UNCONSCIOUS. The
giggling Nazis TIGHTEN the chain around his neck.
With LESS THAN AN INCH to spare... Gutterbuhg's speedboat SQUEEZES
between the two Ocean Liners!
The second speedboat is only a FEW FEET from the Ocean Liners. But as
the ships move CLOSER...the opening is nearly CLOSED. The driver CAN'T
TURN AWAY. He's TOO CLOSE. He emits a SCREAM. The Nazis PAUSE from
strangling Indiana. They TURN.
Indy MOVES FAST. He DIVES overboard. INTO THE WATER.
The speedboat HITS the opening. TOO SMALL. The speedboat is CRUSHED
between the two Ocean Liners. The Nazis let out their FINAL SCREAMS.
Followed by a fiery EXPLOSION! Flaming pieces of the wreckage are
SPLATTERED through the night sky.
GOTTERBUHG turns. His grinning, sadistic face LIT by the explosion.
Tyki's eyes are filled with FEAR.
SEVERAL FEET AWAY, Indiana Jones SURFACES. ALIVE. He SWIMS to the
nearby shore and CLIMBS out of the water. He RUBS his reddened neck,
catches his breath and LOOKS into the distance. Indy SEES Gutterbuhg's
speedboat. TOO FAR to catch.
GUTTERBUHG sees the SILHOUETTE of Indy, standing on the distant shore.
Gutterbuhg orders the driver to move FASTER. The engine ROARS.
Gutterbuhg LOOKS back at Indy. The Nazi emits a MANIACAL LAUGH that
pierces the air.
Indiana watches the speedboat ESCAPE into the night. His eyes fill
with RAGE. VENGEANCE. Clare, Scraggy and a VERY DRUNK Betsy JOIN Indy
on the shore. Betsy PUTS her arms around Indiana. She RESTS her head
on his shoulder. She CLOSES her eyes and emits a DRUNKEN SIGH.
BETSY
What a romantic night!
An ANNOYED Indy pushes Betsy away. In a drunken stupor, Betsy moves to
the next person, CLARE. Thinking she's still with Indiana, Betsy puts
her arms AROUND Clare. A WORRIED Clare is TOO CONCERNED with the
departing Nazi speedboat. Clare TURNS to Inqy.
CLARE
Will they hurt Tyki?
INDIANA
(shaking his head)
They know he's important to us.
(holds up ancient
scroll)
They'll use him to bargain for this.
Eyes CLOSED, resting her head on Clare's shoulder, Betsy SIGHS.
BETSY
Indy, you smell so good! So
masculine!
Clare PUSHES Betsy away. Betsy SPINS and WRAPS HER ARMS around
Scraggy. Clare watches the Nazi Speedboat DISAPPEAR into the night.
CLARE
Will they be following us?
INDIANA
Every step of the way.
Betsy, still thinking she's SNUGGLING with Indiana, rubs her face
against Scraggy's bristly beard.
BETSY
Mmmm, Indy. I love it when you don't
shave. It's so sexy!
Scraggy PUSHES Betsy away. She SPINS, this time putting her arms
around a hanging FISHERMAN'S NET. Filled with FISH. Meanwhile, Scraggy
LOOKS at Indiana and Clare.
SCRAGGY
Pandoola, God of Purity, say...
"Always stay ten paces ahead of bad
spirit".
INDIANA
Exactly. We can't let the Nazis get
to the City first. If they do,
they'll wipe out one of the greatest
archeological finds in History!
Indiana turns and WALKS AWAY. Clare and Scraggy hurriedly FOLLOW.
There's NO TIME to lose. The drunken Betsy continues to embrace the
net of DEAD FISH. Betsy TURNS. Eyes CLOSED. She SMILES.
BETSY
How 'bout a little goodnight kiss?
Betsy KISSES the LIPS OF A DEAD FISH! She SMILES. IMPRESSED.
BETSY
Mmmmm, Indy...you really know the
way to a girl's heart!
Betsy OPENS her eyes. FACE TO FACE with the dead fish. Betsy SCREAMS
and RUNS toward the departing Indiana, Clare and Scraggy!
Betsy stands over a large SKILLET. She FRIES pancakes, LIFTING the
first pancake, Betsy places it on a PLATE that rests beside her. Betsy
TURNS to get another pancake. A HAND REACHES FROM OFF SCREEN. The hand
GRABS the pancake from the plate. Betsy TURNS back. She sees the EMPTY
PLATE. She is PUZZLED. CONFUSED. She SHRUGS, placing ANOTHER PANCAKE
on the plate. She TURNS back to the skillet. Again, a hand GRABS the
pancake. Betsy turns and again sees an EMPTY PLATE. She hears
GIGGLING. BEHIND her. She turns and SEES
AN ORIENTAL PIRATE. TALL. MUSCULAR. The Pirate TOWERS above Betsy. He
is dressed in COLORFUL, TATTERED clothes. The pirate LAUGHS. His
bloated mouth DRIBBLES with pancake crumbs. Betsy STEPS BACK.
FRIGHTENED. The Pirate removes a DAGGER from his belt. Eyes filled
with LECHERY, the Pirate moves toward Betsy. She GRABS the skillet.
THROWING HOT OIL in the Pirate's face. He SCREAMS. Betsy DASHES OUT of
the kitchen.
INDIANA
has nearly finished SHAVING. He tries to CONVINCE Clare of his
innocence. She continues to WRITE. IGNORING him.
INDIANA
You are blowing this Betsy thing all
out of proportion...
Indiana LEANS down. He RINSES his face in a large BUCKET OF WATER. A
DAGGER FLIES INTO FRAME! JUST MISSING Indiana. It STICKS into the
wall. A FEW FEET ABOVE Indy's head. Clare WITNESSES this. SHOCKED.
UNAWARE of the danger, Indiana RAISES his head out of the bucket. He
still tries to REASON with Clare.
INDIANA
It's not as if I have this sleazy
reputation...
Clare is trying to INTERRUPT Indy, trying to POINT OUT the dagger. But
before she can say a word, Indiana again LEANS into the water bucket.
ANOTHER DAGGER SHOOTS INTO FRAME! INTO the wall. This time only INCHES
above Indy's head. Indiana again RAISES his head.
INDIANA
I am a respected...honored...
admired...
Clare LEAPS FORWARD. She pushes Indy OUT OF THE WAY, moments before
another DAGGER FLIES INTO FRAME! STICKING into the wall! Indy and
Clare TURN.
THREE PIRATES stand here. DIRTY. TOOTHLESS. UGLY. SWORDS EXTENDED,
they MOVE toward Indiana and Clare. Indy's eyes DART to the water
bucket table. His WHIP and PISTOL rest here. OUT OF REACH. Indy and
Clare are TRAPPED. The Pirates move CLOSER...
Suddenly, A LOUD SCREAM. The Pirates LOOK UP. SCRAGGY swings from a
ROPE above. TOWARD the Pirates. Before the Pirates can react, Scraggy
CRASHES into them. They TUMBLE to the deck. Scraggy SHOOTS to his
feet. He tosses a spare SWORD to Indy. Scraggy and Indy begin to
SWORDFIGBT the Pirates.
Clare TURNS. DASHING around the corner. To SAFETY. A SUDDEN STOP. Her
face is buried in the hairy, bare chest of KEZURE, an enormous, bear-
like PIRATE KING. Kezure HASN'T BATHED in years. He is dressed in
SEVERAL LAYERS of tattered, colorful clothing, GOLDEN JEWELRY, and
ANIMAL SKINS. His STRINGY hair is long, tied in a PONYTAIL behind his
head. A thick, long MOUSTACHE wraps around a large mouth, filled with
crooked, GOLDEN TEETH. Clare SHRIEKS. Kezure GRABS her around the
waist. He TOSSES Clare over his shoulder.
The river boat is overcome with a mixture of ORIENTAL and BLACK
Pirates. SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS! There is a HEATED BATTLE between the
crew members and the Pirates. Fists FLYING. Swords CLASHING.
Using her Brooklyn street smarts, Betsy FIGHTS like a pro. With a
swift PUNCH and KICK, Betsy DEFEATS one Pirate. She takes his SWORD.
ANOTHER Pirate comes for Betsy. She EDGES him on.
BETSY
C'mon... You ain't so tough. You
wouldn't last ten minutes in
Brooklyn.
The Pirate ATTACKS. He and Betsy begin a HEATED SWORDFIGHT.
Indiana and Scraggy CONTINUE TO BATTLE the onslaught of sword slinging
Pirates. Suddenly, Indy is interrupted by Clare's LOUD SCREAM! He
TURNS.
A PIRATE SHIP
has APPEARED. BESIDE the river boat. The ship is ANCIENT. OMINOUS.
COUNTLESS PIRATES are aboard the ship. Armed with GUNS, BOWS AND
ARROWS and CANNONS.
Indy PULLS the arrow out of his arm. He is suddenly ATTACKED by the
Pirate Gunner. The two begin to STRUGGLE. FIGHT. CAMERA PANS TO the
rear of the cannon, moving to a CLOSE UP of the FUSE. The fuse is LIT.
BURNING.
Meanwhile, Indy and the Pirate fight DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE CANNON'S
OPEN BARREL! Every few seconds, each of their heads MOVES IN FRONT of
the opening. The fuse continues to BURN. Getting LOWER...LOWER...
Indy and the Pirate continue to FIGHT. The cannon fuse SPARKS. BURNING
toward the bottom. The Pirate pushes Indy's head INSIDE OF THE CANNON
OPENING. The FUSE will BLOW at any second. At the last moment, Indiana
OVERPOWERS the Pirate. Indy LEAPS to the floor. The Pirate FALLS
FORWARD. FACE TO FACE WITH THE CANNON OPENING! BOOM! The cannon FIRES!
Indy's shirt is SPLATTERED with blood. Indiana RUNS to a wooden
staircase, hurrying up the stairs. To the TOP DECK.
The Pirates' HIDDEN FORTRESS. An enormous, underground CAVERN.
Hndreds of BURNING TORCHES cast a devilish glow. The grey rocks of the
cavern walls stretch UPWARD. Filled with countless, tiny CAVES.
Various stone artifacts and ancient untensils are SCATTERED throughout
the cavern. There are several other PIRATES here. ARMED. Waiting for
the RETURN of the Pirate Ship.
The River Boat and Pirate Ship ENTER the cave. The rushing waterfall
THRASHES behind them. The BATTERED and BRUISED River Boat comes to a
ROUGH stop. SCREECHING along a far wall. The Pirate Ship sails to a
SMOOTH STOP in the middle of the cavern. Armed with guns, knives and
swords, the Pirates hurriedly SURROUND the intruding River Boat. They
take Betsy, Scraggy and the crew members CAPTIVE.
KEZURE leaps to the Pirate Ship's deck and quickly UNTIES Clare.
Indiana ATTEMPTS to FOLLOW. He PAUSES. Quickly GRABBING A FEW STICKS
OF DYNAMITE from the Pirate Ship deck. Kezure begins to LEAD Clare off
of the ship. His sword at her THROAT. Indiana CALLS OUT.
INDIANA
Wait...
Kezure STOPS. He TURNS. Indy WALKS toward Kezure, stopping less than
TEN FEET from the Pirate King and Clare. Indy's eyes BURN through
Kezure.
INDIANA
Free the girl...
(glances to his captive
friends)
...and my friends...
(lights a match, moves
it toward TNT fuses)
...or I blow your hideout here out
of the water!
Kezure LAUGHS. Indiana LIGHTS the dynamite fuses. Kezure STOPS
laughing...WORRIED for a moment... Then, the Pirate King breaks into a
wide, DEFIANT SMILE.
KEZURE
Good. We will all die.
A STANDOFF. Indy DIDN'T EXPECT this. He is suddenly FRIGHTENED.
PUZZLED. Betsy, Scraggy and Clare STARE at Indy. Waiting for his NEXT
MOVE...as the dynamite fuse SLOWLY BURNS. Getting CLOSER...CLOSER...to
the TNT. Kezure seems CALM. Perfectly WILLING TO DIE. Indy gets
ANOTHER IDEA. He BLURTS it out to Kezure.
INDIANA
We can take you to the Lost City of
Sun Wu Kung!
KEZURE
Hah! Better men than you have tried
to find the Lost City... They have
all failed.
(cynical laugh)
You are a fool.
INDIANA
(as the TNT fuse burns
LOWER...LOWER...)
No... You're the fool. You and your
friends are hiding out in Sun Wu
Kung's Water Curtain Cave...and you
don't even know it.
KEZURE
(puzzled, looking
around)
Huh?...
Scraggy and Betsy exchange a SHOCKED glance. Clare is also SURPRISED
by the news. The TNT fuse nears the end...ready to BLOW AT ANY
SECOND... Indiana removes the ANCIENT SCROLL from his pocket. He
EXTENDS the scroll to Kezure.
INDIANA
The Sacred Pai-Cho Scroll.
Kezure GRABS the scroll. Attempting to READ it. Indy INTERRUPTS.
INDIANA
Don't bother. Only WE can translate
it.
Kezure EXAMINES the scroll. PUZZLED by the writing. Indiana and
Scraggy exchange a HOPEFUL glanpe. Kezure PAUSES. THINKING. He MUMBLES
to himself.
KEZURE
The Lost City... Said to have
streets paved in gold...treasures
far greater than any mortal man
could imagine...
Kezure PUSHES Clare away. TOWARD Indiana. Clare EMBRACES Indy, as he
BLOWS OUT the dynamite fuse. Kezure GROWLS at Indy.
KEZURE
Your pathetic lives will be spared.
For now.
(scratching his neck)
But everything we find in the Lost
City...belongs to ME.
INDIANA
Fat chance, Sinbad. It's 50-50. Or
you've got no deal.
KEZURE
(vicious smile)
It is my way. Or you've got no head.
CUT TO:
A group of Pirates sit TOGETHER. DRUNK. They SING one of their ancient
songs. The GUITAR strumming crew member accompanies them. Indiana and
Scraggy sit around a BLAZING FIRE with Kezure and several other
Pirates. Indy, wearing his spectacles, TRANSLATES the scrolls with
Scraggy. Indiana is PUZZLED. TROUBLED. He LOOKS at Scraggy.
INDIANA
Read that last proverb again...
SCRAGGY
(reads translation)
"High tide drowns curiosity,
Low tide quenches thirst".
INDIANA
(stands, looking at the
surroundings)
There's something here...something
that could help us...
Meanwhile, Betsy and Clare work in ANOTHER SECTION of the cave. Clare
is doing some ARCHEOLOGICAL WORK, studying the various artifacts and
utensils. Betsy ASSISTS her. They are surrounded by LEERING, HUNGRY
EYED PIRATES. The drunken Pirates DON'T take their eyes off of the
girls. Betsy NOTICES. She POINTS it out to Clare.
BETSY
Look at 'em. It's like they've never
seen a woman before.
CLARE
To them... We're the ultimate women.
BETSY
Kinda' flattering, isn't it?...
Being the girl of 200 guy's dreams?
Clare and Betsy exchange a CHUCKLE.
Meanwhile, Indiana, Scraggy and Kezure WALK through the cavern. Indy
is LOOKING around. CURIOUS, he turns to Kezure.
INDIANA
Is there an area... A place where
the tide changes?...
Kezure leads Indiana and Scraggy into a DARK CORNER of the cavern. A
large, smooth WALL stretches to the ceiling. The wall is filled with
intricate CRACKS. At the base of the wall, water slowly POURS into the
cavern. Kezure POINTS to the water.
KEZURE
In a few hours...the water will be
lower...much lower...
INDIANA
And the remainder of this wall will
be visible?....
Kezure NODS. Indiana's eyes LIGHT. A REALIZATION. He excitedly TURNS
to Kezure.
INDIANA
We're gonna need light. A lot of
light. On this wall.
Kezure NODS. Indiana EXCHANGES an anxious, hopeful glance with
Scraggy.
DISSOLVE TO:
CLOSE UP - A SNORING PIRATE
CAMERA PULLS BACK. All of the Pirates SLEEP. Their slumbering bodies
LIE in various positions, throughout the cave. Indiana and Kezure are
STILL AWAKE. The flickering orange light of the TORCHES illuminates
the wall in front of them. They AWAIT the lowering tide. Scraggy,
Betsy and Clare SLEEP on the ground beside them. Kezure POURS two
glasses of whiskey from a STONE BOTTLE. He gives a GLASS to Indiana.
Kezure TOASTS.
KEZURE
To my good fortune.
Kezure GOBBLES down the whiskey. Indiana RELUCTANTLY drinks. Kezure
pours TWO more glasses. LAUGHING.
KEZURE
You know... We are very much alike,
Doctor jones.
INDIANA
I doubt that.
KEZURE
We both share a remarkable talent
for killing.
INDIANA
I've never gotten used to killing,
pal. I do it for survival.
KEZURE
I do it for pleasure.
Indiana DOWNS his whiskey. A LAUGHING Kezure does the same. Indiana
NOTICES something. ON the wall. He JUMPS to his feet. CAMERA PANS TO
THE WALL. The tide is VERY LOW. The entire wall is now VISIBLE. What
were once simple CRACKS, have become the specific LINES OF A MAP. A
group of ARROWS leads to an "X" at the BOTTOM CORNER OF THE MAP. A
FASCINATED Kezure and Indiana STUDY the wall.
INDIANA
(astounded)
This is incredible...this map was
obviously used by Sun Wu Kung's
disciples...if they were ever
lost...
KEZURE
These drawings...they are of the
surrounding jungle...
INDIANA
(points to "X")
Where is that?...
KEZURE
It is located at the most South
Eastern part of the jungle...near
the mountains... There is a village
there. The Mongooboo Tribe.
INDIANA
You know them?
KEZURE
Very well. I traded with the chief
for many years.
INDIANA
(anxious, excited)
Good. We'll leave in the morning.
CAMERA PANS FROM Indiana and Kezure, to a DARK CAVE. A FEW FEET away.
Standing inside, is the figure of the MYSTERIOUS CREW MEMBER. The
TRAITOR. His face is HIDDEN in the shadows. Again, he RADIOS back to
Nazis. He WHISPERS in German. CAMERA DOLLIES INTO A CLOSE UP of his
RADIO MICROPHONE. A RED SWASTIKA adorns the microphone.
The bizarre SOUND echoes through the taxi. Indy EXCHANGES a puzzled
look with the others.
INDIANA
That sound. Again.
SCRAGGY
(listening)
Still far away...but getting closer.
The sound STOPS. Indiana is BOTHERED. DISTURBED. Kezure LEANS forward.
He points to a CLUSTERED AREA OF JUNGLE. Nearly a MILE in the
distance.
KEZURE
The village is there. Beyond the
thick of jungle.
Scraggy NODS. He DRIVES toward the village. Suddenly, AN ARROW SHOOTS
THROUGH THE WINDOW! JUST MISSING everyone. It SHATTERS the passenger
window.
A TRIBE OF NATIVE WARRIORS appear on the terrain. There are HUNDREDS.
SCREAMING in high pitched squeals. Their bodies ADORNED with red and
On the Taxi roof, the men DIVE for cover. Arrows WHIZ by their heads.
Inside, everyone ROLLS UP the windows. The taxi is attacked with a
SHOWER OF ARROWS. Scraggy FLOORS the gas. The taxi keeps MOVING AHEAD.
SPEEDING toward the jungle. Indiana GLARES at Kezure.
INDIANA
Thought you said they knew you?...
Kezure gives a PUZZLED SHRUG.
The WARRIORS continue to CHASE the Taxi. Getting CLOSER. Firing more
ARROWS. The taxi SPINS to a stop. Directly in front of a LARGE OPENING
that leads into the jungle. Everyone POURS OUT of the Taxi. ARROWS fly
by their heads. They DASH through the opening. Into the JUNGLE. The
Warriors STOP. OUTSIDE of the opening. They DON'T ENTER. TURNING to
each other, they begin to LAUGH. VICTORIOUS.
An almost PERFECT PATH has been cleared through the thick Jungle.
Indiana and the others RUN through the path. Indy SUDDENLY PAUSES.
MOTIONING for the others to STOP. A PUZZLED LOOK covers his face.
INDIANA
Wait... Listen... They're not
following us...
One of the Pirates CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD. His foot TRIPS A THIN
STRING that stretches across the path. WHOOSH! A BOOBY TRAPPED PALM
TREE SWINGS FORWARD! It SLAMS into the Pirate! Like a giant BASEBALL
BAT! It sends the Pirate FLYING UPWARD. HIGH INTO THE AIR! His body is
THROWN several feet into the jungle.
Indiana exchanges a CAUTIOUS look with the others.
INDIANA
Be careful where you step... We've
got to move slowly...very slowly...
Indiana LEADS everyone. They CREEP through the path. Indy PAUSES.
CAMERA PANS TO HIS WAIST. A SECTION OF VINE stretches across the path.
ANOTHER booby trap. Indiana CRAWLS BENEATH THE VINE. He MOTIONS for
the others to follow. One by one, they CAREFULLY CRAWL beneath the
vine. The guitar player is LAST. He begins to CRAWL through. He NEARLY
makes it, when...the top of his guitar HITS THE VINE! The vine SNAPS.
There is a CREAKING SOUND.
A GIANT, METAL TRAP, OVER FOUR FEET HIGH, SHOOTS UP FROM THE GROUND! A
HUMAN TRAP! The GUITAR PLAYER DIVES TO SAFETY! The trap's SHARP METAL
TEETH SNAP SHUT! The guitar is SNAPPED IN TWO!
Soon, the path ERUPTS with countless ROWS OF TRAPS. They EJECT from
the ground. SNAPPING SHUT. One AFTER the other. Everyone begins to
RUN. The traps SNAP SHUT ONLY A FEW FEET BEHIND THEM! Everyone ROUNDS
A CORNER... They COME UPON...
AN ENORMOUS PIT! Over TEN FEET DEEP! Filled with countless layers of
SCORPIONS! There is NOWHERE TO TURN. NOWHERE TO RUN. The METAL TRAPS
continue to SHUT BEHIND THEM!
Indiana removes his SWORD. He slices at A BAMBOO TREE. The traps
CONTINUE TO SHUT BEHIND HIM. Getting CLOSER. CLOSER. Indiana gives A
FINAL WHACK TO THE TREE. It FALLS. STRETCHING across the pool. Only A
FEW FEET ABOVE the stinging scorpions. Indiana begins to CLIMB ACROSS.
Moving HAND OVER HAND. Everyone hurriedly FOLLOWS. The bamboo tree
CREAKS with their every movement. Their feet DANGLE only INCHES above
the scorpions. The last Pirate GRABS HOLD of the bamboo tree, just as
the FINAL METAL TRAP SHUTS! JUST MISSING HIM!
As the last Pirate makes his way ACROSS the pit, he DROPS a small bag
of GOLD COINS. The coins REST a few feet below. DIRECTLY ON TOP of the
scorpions. The Pirate PAUSES. DECIDING whether to climb to safety or
retrieve the coins. Everyone else has MADE IT across. The GREEDY
Pirate wants his money. With his left hand, he HOLDS TIGHTLY to the
bamboo tree. With the other, he REACHES for the coins. His fingers are
INCHES from the ciins. But he LOSES his grip. He FALLS. INTO THE PIT.
SURROUNDED by hundreds of scorpions. He STRUGGLES to get out.
CLIMBING. SWIMMING. But he only manages to SINK. The Pirate's SCREAMS
die, as his body is ENGULFED by the stinging scorpions.
Indiana and the others CONTINUE AHEAD. Moving SLOWLY. CAREFULLY.
Someone's foot STEPS ON A WOODEN TRIGGER. There is another CREAKING
SOUND. Behind everyone, a large BAMBOO DOOR EJECTS FROM THE GROUND. It
leads to an UNDERGROUND CAGE. The door CREAKS OPEN. THREE FEROCIOUS
LIONS LEAP OUT! TEETH BARED. GROWLING. They COME FOR the humans.
Everyone DASHES FORWARD. RUNNING. The lions are in HOT PURSUIT. FAST.
The humans don't stand a CHANCE. Suddenly, Clare STOPS. She TURNS.
FACING the charging lions. Indiana LOOKS BACK. SCREAMING.
INDIANA
Clare! What are you...?!?
The lions STOP. Inches from Clare. They SURROUND her. Ready to ATTACK.
Indiana WATCHES. PUZZLED. Clare begins to make bizarre PURRING and
COOING SOUNDS. The lions PAUSE. They RECOGNIZE the sounds. Clare
CONTINUES. The lions begin to WARM UP to her. Clare KNEELS. She PETS
the beasts. The lions SNUGGLE up to Clare. LICKING her face. Indiana
and the others COME CLOSER. PUZZLED. Clare EXPLAINS.
CLARE
I imitated the sound of a Lion
Mother calling her babies.
Betsy is IMPRESSED. Indiana SMILES. RELIEVED.
INDIANA
C'mon. Let's get outta' --
Indy TURNS...FACE TO FACE with a grotesque SHRUNKEN HEAD! He STEPS
BACK. The shrunken head is worn around the neck of a tall, muscular
TRIBAL CHIEF. Leader of the WARRIORS. Countless NATIVES stand behind
the chief. A look of ANGER...HATE...covers the Chief's face. Indiana
gives a HOPEFUL glance to Kezure.
INDIANA
Is this the Tribal Chief you told me
about?... Your friend?...
KEZURE
(points to shrunken
head)
No. That is him.
Indiana ROLLS his eyes. The warriors SURROUND everyone. ARROWS aimed.
Ready to KILL. The Warriors lead everyone OUT of the path.
EMPTY, save for an elaborate MARBLE ALTAR. A dull MIRROR rests on the
altar. The small mirror is surrounded by a crude, STONE FRAME. The
chief PICKS up the mirror and GIVES it to Scraggy. The chief EXPLAINS.
Scraggy GIVES the mirror to Indiana.
SCRAGGY
(translating)
He say this will help us. And since
we are divine messengers...we will
know how to use it!
Indiana SMIRKS. He EXAMINES the mirror. Totally CONFUSED by it.
CUT TO:
Indiana SLEEPS here. In a HAMMOCK. The vibration WAKES Indy. As he
moves to climb out of the hammock, a FIGURE LEAPS ON TOP OF HIM!
BETSY.
BETSY
Indy. I'm frightened.
INDIANA
I'm claustrophobic.
Indiana attempts to PUSH Betsy out of the hammock. She RESISTS. They
begin to WRESTLE. STRUGGLE. The hammock becomes TANGLED around their
bodies.
Clare WALKS BY the hut. She LOOKS inside. To her, it appears that Indy
and Betsy are in the middle of a PASSIONATE love scene. She emits a
SHOCKED GASP. Indiana SEES Clare. He CALLS OUT.
INDIANA
Clare!... Wait!...
But the startled Clare HURRIES AWAY. Indiana manages to ESCAPE Betsy
and the tangled hammock. He LANDS on the floor. BREATHLESS.
GUTTERBUHG is here. He views the outside action through a PERISCOPE.
TWO NAZI GUNNERS are behind him. WAITING for orders to shoot. TYKI
sits in the background. The confused pygmy is BOUND and GAGGED.
OUTSIDE
Scraggy, Clare, Betsy, Kezure and the others DASH across the plains.
RUNNING AWAY from the pursuing tank. But Indiana is NOT with them.
Scraggy, UNABLE TO SEE through the dust, calls out.
SCRAGGY
Indy?... Indy?...
Indiana is SEVERAL FEET AWAY. On the GROUND. ALONE. LOST in the thick
of DUST. Suddenly, a DARK FIGURE appears. TOWERING over Indiana. The
dust begins to CLEAR. Revealing a protruding WHITE HORN. More dust
CLEARS. We see that the figure is a large, BLACK RHINOCEROS! Indy
LEAPS to his feet. The rhino SNORTS. Indy turns to RUN. The rhino
CHASES him!
Meanwhile, with most of the dust CLEARED, the TANK CHASES INDY'S
FRIENDS ACROSS THE JUNGLE PLAINS.
Gutterbuhg LOOKS into the periscope. Indy's friends are in his SIGHTS.
Gutterbuhg SCREAMS to the gunners.
GUTTERBUHG
(German; English
subtitles)
Fire!
OUTSIDE
The tank's large barrel FIRES A SHOT at the running group. The blast
FLIES OVER THEIR HEADS. JUST MISSING everyone. It BLASTS a row of palm
trees to smithereens.
INDIANA is still running from the rampaging rhino. Indy begins to RUN
IN A CIRCLE. The angry rhino FOLLOWS him. The circle begins to
TIGHTEN... Becoming SMALLER... SMALLER... Until Indy is nearly running
ALONGSIDE of the rhino. At the exact moment, Indy GRABS HOLD of the
rhino. He LEAPS onto the beast. With a bit of careful maneuvering,
Indiana is RIDING THE RHINOCEROS!
Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others CONTINUE TO RUN. The tank
is right BEHIND THEM. MOVING FAST. In HOT PURSUIT. The tank FIRES
ANOTHER SHOT! It SPLATTERS the ground. BESIDE the group. Again, JUST
MISSING everyone. The group TURNS. RUNNING in ANOTHER DIRECTION. The
tank FOLLOWS.
Indiana continues to ride the WILD, BUCKING rhino. He has NO CONTROL
over the beast. The rhino spots SOMETHING. The TANK. From this angle,
the tank, with its large protruding gun barrel, resembles a GIANT
RHINOCEROS. Seeing this, the rhino turns and RUNS TOWARD the tank.
HEAD ON. Indy holds TIGHTLY.
Scraggy and the others PAUSE. They see the tank BEHIND THEM. They see
the rhino AHEAD of them. The group makes QUICK TURN. To the RIGHT.
They run toward a RAVINE.
The tank is headed STRAIGHT for Indy and the rhino. Both moving at
FULL SPEED.
Through the periscope, Gutterbuhg SEES Indy and the rhino.
INDIANA
continues to RIDE the uncontrollable rhino. They are within THIRTY
FEET of the oncoming tank.
Gutterbuhg SCREAMS in German, ordering the Nazi Gunner to "Fire".
Gutterbuhg LOOKS through the periscope. His view is BLOCKED by dust.
The Nazis are UNAWARE of Indy's presense on the tank. Gutterbuhg
CONTINUES to look through the periscope. The dust begins to CLEAR. He
FOCUSES his sights on Indy's friends. LOCATED several feet away. They
CLIMB into the TREE. Gutterbuhg SMILES.
The tree of Indy's friends are in Gutterbuhg's SIGHTS. A PERFECT SHOT.
Gutterbuhg SCREAMS in German, ordering the Nazi gunners to SHOOT. They
FIRE. But the barrel BACKFIRES! EXPLODING in the face of the two Nazi
gunners. It sends them FLYING against the wall. OUT COLD. The cabin
fills with SMOKE. Only Gutterbuhg and Tyki REMAIN. A FURIOUS
Gutterbuhg PICKS up the radio. He SCREAMS into the microphone.
GUTTERBUHG
(German; English
subtitles)
Send help! We need assistance!
Tyki HELPLESSLY watches in the background. Gutterbuhg LOOKS into the
periscope. He SEES Indiana. ON the tank. Gutterbuhg hits a RED BUTTON.
On the CONTROL PANEL.
Tyki SITS inside. WATCHING through the periscope. HELPLESS.
Indiana TAKES the controls. But they are completely ALIEN to him. He
hears a SQUEAL. TYKI. Behind HIM. Tyki motions to a SPECIFIC CONTROL.
Indy GRABS HOLD of it.
Indy grabs the RADIO MICROPHONE. He HOLDS it in front of Gutterbuhg.
INDIANA
Call your mommy.
Gutterbuhg GROWLS. He SPEAKS German into the microphone. The voice of
LIEUT. MEPHISTO answers. Echoing over the SPEAKERS. Indy GRABS the
microphone. INTERRUPTING.
INDIANA
This is Jones. I've got your tank.
(pause)
It's all over, pal. You lose.
CUT TO:
CLOSE-UP: LIEUT. MEPHISTO
He is ANGRY. UPSET. But he FORCES himself to CALMLY address Indiana.
MEPHISTO
Doctor Jones... You surprise me. For
a supposedly intelligent man...you
jump to childish conclusions.
Remember... You are driving our
tank. We can FOLLOW you anywhere.
(vehement)
You are far from defeating us, my
friend. The battle has only just
begun.
CAMERA PULLS BACK. Mephisto is standing beside a long ROW OF TENTS.
Housing many TROOPS. Several JEEPS are parked in the background. All
mounted with RECOILEST CANNONS. 5 CANVAS TRUCKS are also here. Filled
with more TROOPS, CANNONS and AMMUNITION. The Nazis have assembled an
ENTIRE ARMY!
INDIANA
DROPS the microphone. Suddenly WORRIED. He HURRIES out of the tank.
Gutterbuhg stays BEHIND. LAUGHING.
Indiana DRIVES. UNFAMILIAR with the controls. The tank is CROWDED with
everyone. Betsy and Clare sit BESIDE Indy. Gutterbuhg is DIRECTLY
BEHIND HIM. Kezure TEACHES a game to Scraggy. Tyki, the Pirates and
the various crew members WATCH. The game appears to be a BIZARRE
VERSION of chess. Only the tokens are DRIED INSECTS and LIZARDS.
Kezure EXPLAINS.
KEZURE
This is called "Taskipi". Only the
bravest play.
Upon hearing this, Scraggy is even MORE EXCITED TO PLAY. The game
BEGINS.
Indiana is becoming extremely FRUSTRATED by the tank controls. Betsy
gives a SERIOUS LOOK to him.
BETSY
I've been talking to Dr. Clarke
about our problem.
INDIANA
(struggling with tank)
Problem?... Hey... What're you two
doin' talkin' behind my back?...
CLARE
Betsy needed help. I obliged.
INDIANA
Since when did you become the female
Sigmund Freud?
CLARE
Since I received a Masters Degree in
Psychology.
Indy ROLLS HIS EYES. Meanwhile, Kezure has TAKEN all of Scraggy's
tokens. He's obviously WON the game. A carefree Scraggy THROWS up his
hands.
SCRAGGY
We play again?
KEZURE
(pause, serious)
The game is not yet over, my friend.
SCRAGGY
Oh?
KEZURE
You have lost. You must pay.
SCRAGGY
(going through pockets)
I don't have money...
KEZURE
No. No. money.
(deadly smile)
Rules of the game declare that I may
choose a souvenir.
(removes a knife)
A part of your body. Any part I
wish.
Scraggy GULPS. Kezure PAUSES. RUBBING his jaw. THINKING. Meanwhile,
Betsy EXPLAINS to Indians.
BETSY
Dr. Clarke says that you're not
really in love with me. You're just
trying to prove that you can still
attract younger women. You're
terrified of getting old.
INDIANA
That's crazy.
BETSY
That's what I told her. I told her
that you really did love me.
INDIANA
(fumbling)
Well...that's...ah...well...
BETSY
(worried)
You mean... She was right?...
INDIANA
No... I mean Yes... I mean...
Indy TURNS, seeing Clare GLARING at him. Indy SIGHS. PAUSES. He gives
Betsy a TENDER, HONEST look.
INDIANA
No, Betsy. I don't love you.
BETSY
(tears fill her eyes)
That's the first time you ever said
it!
Betsy begins CRYING. Into Clare's ARMS. Indiana SHAKES his head. Clare
COMFORTS Betsy.
CLARE
There. There. He's a very disturbed
man.
Indiana SIGHS. He TURNS. FACE to FACE with a GRINNING and NODDING
Gutterbuhg.
Kezure has made his DECISION. Scraggy WAITS. TERRIFIED. Kezure RAISES
his knife. TOWARD Scraggy's face.
KEZURE
Your eyes. They are a striking deep
blue.
Scraggy COVERS his face. Kezure ATTACKS him. Trying to CUT OUT
Scraggy's eyes. A FIGHT begins. The crew members VS. the Pirates.
Indiana TURNS, away from the controls. He BREAKS UP the fight.
INDIANA
(angry)
Enough. We're in this together. If
we start fighting among ourselves...
we'll never get out alive.
The men CALM DOWN. CATCHING their breath. Kezure PUTS AWAY his knife.
He GLARES at Scraggy.
KEZURE
You owe me, old man.
Clare NOTICES the tank going over the mountain. She SCREAMS.
CLARE
Doctor Jones!!!
Indy TURNS. LEAPING back to the controls. He hurriedly STEERS the tank
back onto the mountain path. Saving it at the LAST MOMENT. Everyone
CATCHES their breath. Indiana STEPS on the gas, continuing AHEAD.
CUT TO:
Indy LOOKS at the tank's control panel. A PUZZLEMENT. He LOOKS at
Gutterbuhg.
INDIANA
How do I work the big gun?
Gutterbuhg SMILES. He REFUSES to answer. Indy has NO TIME for games.
He LOOKS at Kezure.
INDIANA
Want your souvenir?
(grabs Gutterbuhg's left
arm)
Start with his good arm.
Kezure SMILES and removes his LONG KNIFE. He moves it Gutterbuhg's
NECK. The snivelling Nazi CRIES OUT.
GUTTERBUHG
W-W-Wait!... Please!...
Indy NODS to Kezure. The Pirate King moves his KNIFE. Gutterbuhg
hurriedly POINTS to two switches on the control panel.
GUTTERBUHG
There. That is what you want.
Indy NODS. He TURNS to the switches.
Indy HITS the gas.
Indiana LOOKS through the persiscope. His view BLINDED by the clouds.
Indy EASES up on the gas. The tank SLOWS. Suddenly, there is a LOUD
CRASH! The tank is HIT. RATTLING. SHAKING. Everyone is TOSSED. Save
for Indy, who STAYS at the controls. He continues to GUIDE the tank
FORWARD. There is another CRASH. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.
Indiana is TOUGH. PERSISTENT. He continues to move the jolting tank
FORWARD. As the surrounding walls CAVE IN. SHATTER. Everyone PANICS.
SCREAMING.
Indiana still attempts to move the tank FORWARD. But the engine begins
to COUGH. SPUTTER. And DIES.
WE ENTER with Indy and the others. The city is BURSTING with the
bright colors of various VEGETABLE and FRUIT GARDENS, and various
other EXOTIC PLANT LIFE. Luscious GREEN GRASS and CRYSTAL CLEAR LAKES
surround many of the homes. The earthen streets are literally PAVED
WITH GOLD. The men and women of the City are members of Tyki's RACE.
ORIENTAL PYGMIES. There is a PEACEFUL, JOYOUS quality about them. They
RUSH toward Tyki. EMBRACING him. SHOWERING him with kisses. WELCOMING
him home.
Indiana and the others are in AWE of this new world. Gutterbuhg WALKS
with them. CAMERA PANS to his HANDS. He struggles to UNTIE his
bindings.
Kezure SPOTS something. A small, SOLID GOLD GARDEN TOOL. Lying in a
VEGETABLE GARDEN. Kezure's eyes fill with GREED. He moves to STEAL the
can. Kezure GRABS the tool and begins to HIDE it. BENEATH his cloak. A
LARGE GORILLA'S HAND GRABS Kezure's arm. TOWERING over the Pirate
king, the Gorilla WAVES his finger at Kezure. A WARNING. NO STEALING.
The nervous Kezure NODS. He PLACES the garden tool back on the ground.
Meanwhile, Indy and the others are led to an elaborate PALACE. They
ascend the several GOLDEN STAIRS, toward the entrance. The palace
doors OPEN. An OLDER MAN steps outside. He is BOHBALA. The City's
RULER. A few PALACE GUARDS stand beside him. Bohbala RAISES his arms
over the crowd. Pygmies and Gorillas DROP TO THEIR KNEES. In REVERNCE.
Tyki RUNS to Bohbala. They EMBRACE. TEARS OF JOY fill their eyes.
Bohbala WIPES away his tears. He gives a WARM SMILE to Indiana and the
others. He SPEAKS. SOFTLY. In a WISE voice. Scraggy TRANSLATES for the
others.
SCRAGGY
He thank us...for returning his son.
Indiana and the others SMILE. Betsy WHIPSERS to Indy.
BETSY
If the little guy's pushin' 200
years?... How old's his Father?
Indy motions for Betsy to "Shhh". Bohbala continues to SPEAK. Scraggy
TRANSLATES.
SCRAGGY
His name "Bohbala". He is Ruler of
City, faithful servant of his Lord
and Master... Sun Wu-Kung.
(pause, smile)
He welcome us to stay. As long as we
wish.
Indiana exchanges a HOPEFUL glance with Clare. As Bohbala CONTINUES to
speak, CAMERA PANS TO GUTTERBUHG. The Nazi has successfully UNTIED his
bindings. FREE. While the others listen to Bohbala, Gutterbuhg REMOVES
ONE SPARE BULLET FROM HIS MOUTH. He slyly INSERTS the bullet into his
mechanical arm.
Indiana is TOO CONCERNED with Bohbala to notice Gutterbuhg.
INDIANA
(anxious, to Scraggy)
Ask him where we may find the burial
place...or the remains...of Sun Wu-
Kung...
Scraggy TURNS to ask Bohbala. But his question is INTERRUPTED by
Gutterbuhg's MECHANICAL ARM. It EXTENDS INTO FRAME! Its finger POINTED
AT INDIANA! Everyone STARES. SHOCKED. But the bizarre sight greatly
AMUSES Bohbala. He begins to LAUGH. He REACHES OUT and PUSHES
Gutterbuhg's finger away. But the machine gun GOES OFF! FIRING!
Bohbala is HIT! In the CHEST. He FALLS. Tyki KNEELS, cradling
Bohbala's head in his arms. Tyki CALLS his Father's name. It is
FUTILE. Bohbala is DEAD.
The crowd of villagers STARE. CONFUSED. They are unaccustomed to
VIOLENCE.
Indiana CLUTCHES Gutterbuhg by the throat.
INDIANA
Bastard...
Indiana pulls back his fist to PUNCH the Nazi. But Indy is STOPPED by
the PALACE GUARDS. They move their SWORDS to his throat. Indy is
suddenly PUZZLED. The VILLAGERS FALL TO THEIR KNEES. BOWING to
Gutterbuhg. A distraught Tyki hurriedly EXPLAINS to Scraggy, who
translates for Indy.
SCRAGGY
It is written... If ruler is
defeated by greater power...he who
possess that power...
(points to Gutterbuhg)
...shall become ruler!
Gutterbuhg's eyes fill with a sadistic THRILL. He RAISES his
MECHANICAL ARM. In a "Heil Hitler" POSE. The entire City IMITATES the
Nazi. RAISING their right arms. CHEERING. HAILING their new leader.
Indiana is HORRIFIED by the scene. Tyki is UPSET. SCREAMING. He knows
that Gutterbuhg is truly EVIL! But NONE of the villagers listen.
Indiana LOOKS to his SHOCKED friends.
INDIANA
This is turning into one helluva
nightmare.
GUTTERBUBG
(hears, smiles at Indy)
One you will never awaken from,
Doctor Jones.
Indy GLARES at Gutterbuhg. Clare and Betsy exchange a FRIGHTENED
glance.
CUT TO:
A beautiful, expansive chamber, filled with TAPESTRIES and ARTWORK.
Gutterbuhg sits in an elaborate GOLDEN THRONE. He has donned a
ghoulish NEW OUTFIT. The robes of BOHBALA, the dead ruler. Gutterbuhg
is being ATTENDED upon by several villagers, who bring him countless
PLATES OF FOOD. He is surrounded by SEVERAL WOMEN, who patiently wait
for his orders. Gutterbuhg GOBBLES down the variety of food and wine.
DROOLING. SLOBBERING.
Scraggy KNEELS before the Nazi. Gutterbuhg USES Indiana's WHIP as a
LEASH. It is TIED around Scraggy's neck and HELD by the Nazi.
Gutterbuhg PULLS the leash. HARD. Nearly STRANGLING Scraggy. His mouth
FILLED WITH FOOD, Gutterbuhg SCREAMS at Scraggy.
GUTTERBUHG
I want to see Jones!
Scraggy TRANSLATES for the guards.
DARK. MUSTY. Surrounded with moss covered STONE WALLS. Located BENEATH
the Palace. Indy and the others are LOCKED inside. Everyone is SILENT.
STARING. WAITING. Clare CONSOLES a tearful, despondent Tyki. The
dungeon gate OPENS. The two Guards ENTER. They DRAG Indiana out of the
dungeon. Betsy CALLS OUT to Indy. Trying to FOLLOW. But the guards
SLAM the wooden door in Betsy's face. She peers through the small
BARRED WINDOW. WORRIED. UPSET.
Indiana is LED into the Ruler's Chamber. Indy SEES Scraggy, tied to a
leash. An angry, VENGEFUL look covers Indy's face. He TURNS to
Gutterbuhg. The Nazi, still STUFFING his face with food, pulls TIGHTLY
on Scraggy's leash.
GUTTERBUHG
Your friend makes a wonderful
interpreter.
Indy's eyes BURN. Gutterbuhg GULPS down a glass of wine. Liquid
SPITTLES from the sides of his mouth. He LOOKS at Indy.
GUTTERBUHG
"The Nazi Party will exist for one
thousand years...and I wish to be
alive for every year!"
(pause)
That is a favorite philosophy of our
feuher.
INDIANA
Your feuher's philosphies belong on
a bathroom wall.
GUTTERBUHG
(angry, slapping Indy
across the face)
This is a very serious matter,
Doctor Jones. It could save your
life.
(pause)
I understand that somewhere in this
City...there is a Garden of...
Immortal Peaches?...
(Indy doesn't respond,
Gutterbuhg continues)
I want information about this
Garden... And I would greatly
appreciate it, if you would share
everything you know, with me.
INDIANA
I don't share anything with Nazis.
Gutterbuhg NODS. He TAKES another bite of food, shooting a GLOWERING
look to Indiana.
GUTTERBUHG
Very well. My friends will be here
soon. They will rest...enjoy the
pleasures of my newfound kingdom...
(kisses a woman, and
pushes her away)
Then we shall exterminate these
worthless people! Destroy their
City! And we will carry away all of
its riches...in pieces.
Gutterbuhg goes back to his FOOD. Scraggy exchanges a WORRIED GLANCE
with Indiana.
CUT TO:
THE NAZI ARMY
TRAVELLING along the narrow mountain path. They are more than HALFWAY
up the mountain. LIEUT. MEPHISTO rides in the FRONT JEEP. He LOOKS to
his driver, who REPORTS to Mephisto.
DRIVER
(German, English
subtitles)
Sir... We shall reach the mountain
top in less than sixty minutes.
Mephisto NODS. ANXIOUS.
CUT TO:
THE LOST CITY - COLISEUM
An enormous STONE ARENA. Located in the CENTER of the City. It
resembles the ROMAN COLISEUM in size and structure. The coliseum's top
walls are SURROUNDED by countless, large METAL BELLS. The bells are
RINGING. They are the same bells we heard earlier...but they now sound
EERIE... THREATENING. The many seats are FILLED with members of the
village. All GATHERED for a special event.
Gutterbuhg sits in the elaborate RULER'S BOX. It is covered with a
protective, GOLDEN GRATING. The box is located directly above the
earthen PLAYING FIELD. Indy's WHIP is still tied around Scraggy's
neck, who kneels at Gutterbuhg's FEET.
TWO GUARDS lead a shirtless INDIANA JONES onto the playing field. They
bring Indy to a STEEL CAGE, located directly below Gutterbuhg's box.
Inside of the cage, are TWO ENORMOUS BUFFALO. ANGRY. RESTLESS.
Betsy, Clare, Tyki, Kezure, the remaining Pirates and Crew members,
all helplessly watch from inside of a LARGE METAL CAGE. The cage is
SUSPENDED in the air... DANGLING over a deep pit. It is filled with
COUNTLESS MANEATING TIGERS.
Indy is LED into the cage. BETWEEN the two buffalo. The guards GRABS
HOLD of Indiana. They TIE one of his arms, and one of his legs, to
EACH SIDW of the buffalo. Preparing to DRAW and QUARTER Indiana.
A DELIGHTED Gutterbuhg PEERS DOWN at Indiana.
GUTTERBUHG
Doctor Jones... Those beasts are
anxious to run wild. Free.
(vicious smile)
How long will you be able to ride...
before they TEAR YOU IN TWO?
Indy LOOKS at Scraggy, who is very FRIGHTENED.
GUTTERBUHG
Goodbye, Doctor Jones.
Gutterbuhg TURNS to the guards. Ready to give them the ORDER...to OPEN
THE CAGE and SET THE BUFFALO FREE! Indy suddenly SCREAMS.
INDIANA
Heil Hitler!
Upon hearing the words, Gutterbuhg STANDS. Like a ROBOT. He RAISES his
mechanical arm in a "Heil Hitler" POSE.
GUTTERBUHG
Heil Hitler!
The FINGERS of Gutterbuhg's mechanical arm get CAUGHT IN THE METAL
GRATING ABOVE HIS HEAD! Gutterbuhg TRIES TO REMOVE his fingers. NO
GOOD. STUCK. Gutterbuhg PULLS. HARD. His mechanical arm is RIPPED FROM
ITS SOCKET! It DANGLES from the grating.
The crowd WATCHES. PUZZLED. SHOCKED.
Scraggy THINKS FAST. He LEAPS to his feet and GRABS the arm. He TEARS
IT OUT of the grating. Scraggy HOLDS the arm above his head. Now it is
HE who possesses the POWER! The crowd CHEERS Scraggy! Their NEW RULER!
Gutterbuhg STEPS BACK. Suddenly FRIGHTENED. Scraggy ORDERS the guards
to FREE Indiana. The guards hurriedly UNTIE Indy from the buffalo.
Gutterbuhg TURNS. RUNNING out of the Coliseum. Scraggy SCREAMS to the
people, motioning for them to FOLLOW Gutterbuhg. Several people LEAP
from their seats. CHASING the Nazi.
Indiana REJOINS his friends on the playing field. They have been FREED
from the cage. Scraggy gives the WHIP to Indy. Indy is IMPATIENT.
WORRIED. He LOOKS at everyone.
INDIANA
Nazis'll be be here soon. We gotta
move fast.
Scraggy gives Gutterbuhg's MECAHNICAL ARM to Tyki. The pygmy NODS. He
UNDERSTANDS. Tyki RAISES THE ARM TOWARD THE PEOPLE. They CHEER Tyki,
their rightful ruler. Tyki, PULLS BACK and THROWS the mechanical arm.
HIGH INTO THE AIR! It SOARS several feet! FLYING OVER the coliseum
walls.
Filled with several crates of DYNAMITE and SUPPLIES. Gutterbuhg DASHES
inside. Toward a SILVER, METALLIC BRIEFCASE that rests in the rear of
the truck. Gutterbuhg's greasy fingers OPEN the briefcase.
Inside, encased in black velvet, are TWO RECTANGULAR COMPARTMENTS. One
of the compartments is EMPTY. The other houses another MECHANICAL ARM.
Gutterbuhg quickly ATTACHES the arm to the stub of his shoulder and
RUNS BACK OUTSIDE.
The SOUND OF THE EXPLOSION echoes through the City. SHAKING the city
walls. The Nazis are CLOSE.
Indiana STANDS in the city square. He has ASSEMBLED everyone for the
battle. Tyki and the pygmies are armed with BOWS and ARROWS, SPEARS
and BLOW PIPES. Kezure and the Pirates hold their SWORDS. Scraggy's
men carry REVOLVERS and DAGGERS. Clare and Betsy STAND with several
Gorillas. Tyki WHISPERS to Scraggy, who TRANSLATES for Indiana.
SCRAGGY
They want you to give speech.
INDIANA
What?!?...
SCRAGGY
Before battle... General always give
speech to inspire troops.
INDIANA
General?... Who the hell do they
think I am... Custer?...
But ALL EYES are on Indiana. DEPENDING on him. Indy SIGHS. Trying to
THINK of something to say. He MUMBLES to Scraggy.
INDIANA
Geez... The only speeches I remember
are from college...when I played
ball...
Scraggy SHRUGS. Indy CLEARS his throat. He LOOKS at everyone.
FUMBLING.
INDIANA
Men...and, ah...women... I...ah...
We're about to face one of our
toughest opponents... They've got
size...hardware...and well, quite
frankly...we're the underdogs...
Indy's eyes LIGHT. A moment of INSPIRATION. The background MUSIC
SLOWLY BEGINS TO RISE. Indy's voice becomes LOUDER. TOUGHER.
INDIANA
But...well, if it wasn't for the
little guy...where would this
country be?...
(excited, louder)
I mean...I knew this little guy once
...a scrawny runt, with thick black
glasses and about 300 different
kinds of allergies... But this
little kid had a dream... He wanted
to be on the football team.
(Music rises, so does
Indy's voice)
Well, all the big guys made his life
miserable...always shoving his head
in the drinking fountain...putting
mustard in his pants...throwing me
...'er, HIM!...throwing HIM in the
shower with all his clothes on...
(louder, heartfelt)
But that little guy didn't quit. Be
worked hard. Never gave up. And in
two years...he was the Quarterback.
Star of the team. And you know why?...
(Music SOARS, as does
Indy's voice)
'Cause that little kid had somethin'
that those big guys never heard
of... He had HEART! And nothin' can
stop that! Nothin'!
(we hear the Nazis
approaching, Indy
screams)
Now let's go out there and show 'em
JUST HOW TOUGH THE LITTLE GUYS ARE!
Everyone breaks into a loud CHEER. Ready to FIGHT. The sound track
music SOARS. Indiana RAISES HIS SWORD. He TURNS and RUNS toward the
DRAWBRIDGE. The people FOLLOW, as Indy LEADS THEM INTO BATTLE!
Mephisto ATTEMPTS TO SHOOT Indiana. But Indy PUSHES AWAY the Nazi's
arm. The gun FIRES. HITTING the jeep driver, who SLUMPS over the
wheel. The speeding jeep SPINS OUT OF CONTROL. It FLIPS. Sending
Indiana and Mephisto FLYING through the air. They TUMBLE to the
ground. The jeep CRASHES into a wall.
A SHAKEN Indiana gets to his feet. Mephisto LIES A few feet away. OUT
COLD. Suddenly, a BLAST OF ELECTRICITY BURSTS INTO FRAME! SPARKING the
ground beside Indiana. Indy TURNS and sees GUTTERBUBG! The Nazi's jeep
has ENTERED the city. Gutterbuhg POINTS his mechanical arm toward
Indy. ANOTHER ELECTRICAL SHOCK ejects from his finger. Indy DIVES. The
shock TEARS A SMOLDERING HOLE through the building behind him. Only
INCHES above Indy.
Meanwhile, the Nazis begin to UNLOAD the dynamite from Gutterbubg's
jeep. They UNWRAP a long, section of FUSE from a large coil. Placing
the fuse ALONG THE GROUND.
Indiana is RUNNING for his life. Gutterbuhg is DIRECTLY BEHIND him. In
HOT PURSUIT. The Nazi continuously FIRES ELECTRICAL SHOTS at Indiana.
The thin lines of electricity WHIZ by Indy's HEAD. His ARMS. His LEGS.
JUST MISSING INDY. A CAT AND MOUSE CHASE BEGINS, as Gutterbuhg PURSUES
Indiana throughout the city.
CUT TO:
TYKI AND SEVERAL PYGMIES
They have CLIMBED to the top of the City Walls. From here, they GUARD
and DEFEND their city. Crowds of NAZI TROOPS are on foot. Running
TOWARD the city walls. The pygmies SHOWER the Nazis with ARROWS,
SPEARS and POISINOUS DARTS. The Nazis fight back with MACHINE GUNS and
RIFLES. A HEATED, BLOODY BATTLE.
CUT TO:
SCRAGGY AND THE CREW MEMBERS
They stand at the CITY GATE. PROTECTING the City entrance. They
hurriedly load a large, wooden CATAPULT with a huge BALL OF HAY. A
crew member TORCHES the hay. It BURSTS INTO FLAME. Scraggy CRIES
"Fire!" His men LAUNCH the fireball. It SAILS over the City Walls.
THE FIREBALL
LANDS directly onto a speeding NAZI JEEP. The Nazis and jeep CATCH
FIRE! The vehicle LOSES CONTROL. The flaming jeep CRASHES into the
side of a mountain wall.
CUT TO:
A NAZI TANK
ROLLS toward the city. Its GUN BARREL aimed at the city walls. CAMERA
PANS AWAY, SEVERAL FEET AHEAD OF THE TANK. CAMERA MOVES UPWARD, TO THE
MOUNTAIN TOP, ABOVE the path. CLARE is here. A GROUP OF GORILLAS are
beside her. The apes each have a TIGHT HOLD of individual sections of
HANGING VINE. They stand at the EDGE OF THE RAVINE. Clare LOOKS to the
OPPOSITE RAVINE. BETSY is here. She stands with ANOTHER GROUP OF
GORILLAS, who also securely bold lengths of vine.
On the mountain path, the Nazi tank PASSES DIRECTLY BENEATH Betsy and
Clare. The two women TURN to the Gorillas. Emitting Gorilla GRUNTS,
MOANS and MOTIONS, Betsy and Clare COMMUNICATE with the apes. The
Gorillas LISTEN. NODDING. UNDERSTANDING. When the tank is DIRECTLY
BELOW... Betsy and Clare ORDER the Gorillas to JUMP!
The apes SWING from the mountain. RIDING the vines. TOWARD the tank.
The Gorillas LAND on the tank. They CLIMB aboard. EXPLORING the tank's
surface.
FILLED with Nazis. The gunner looks into the PERISCOPE. He is met with
the reflection of a SNARLING GORILLA'S FACE. He SCREAMS and JUMPS
BACK.
There is a sound of RIPPING METAL. Suddenly, the tank's top HATCH is
TORN OPEN. COUNTLESS GORILLAS pour inside! The apes ATTACK.
OVERPOWERING the Nazis.
Filled with NAZI TROOPS. SEATED. ARMED. Waiting to FIGHT. There is a
sudden RIPPING SOUND. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. The NAZIS are
STARTLED to see the BLADES OF COUNTLESS SWORDS. PIERCING the canvas.
Through all SIDES of the truck. SEVERAL PIRATES leap through the
canvas. ATTACKING the Nazis. The Nazis FIGHT BACK with bayonets and
daggers.
Two Pirates BURST into the cabin. They STAB the Nazi driver. The
CACKLING Pirates take control of the steering wheel. They madly STEER
the truck toward the steep EDGE of the mountain path.
THE FIRST TRUCK
PLUMMETS over the eage. The second truck, ATTACHED by the metal chain,
FOLLOWS the first truck. The two canvas trucks FALL into the moat!
SPLASHING into the shark infestea waters!
CUT TO:
The Nazis have planted an enormous PILE OF DYNAMITE on the palace
stairs. Enough to DESTROY the entire city. The T.N.T. is attached to a
LONG FUSE, that stretches hundreds of feet, over VARIOUS SECTIONS of
the city. The Nazis LIGHT the fuse end. It SPARKS. IGNITES. BURNING
FAST. The Nazis TURN and RUN.
Gutterbuhg continues to CHASE Indiana. BLASTS OF ELECTRICITY SHOOT
from the Nazi's arm. Indy DUCKS... DODGES... AVOIDING the electrical
jolts. Indy SPINS around a building corner. He spots the BURNING FUSE.
It STRETCHES along the ground, moving up OVER a wooden fence. Indy
DIVES and STOMPS OUT the fuse. But Gutterbuhg, who is directly behind
Indy, RELIGHTS the fuse with a shot of electricity. Before Indy has a
chance to stop the fuse...Gutterbuhg AIMS at Indy. Indy LEAPS OVER the
fence. Gutterbuhg SHOOTS. The fence is SPLINTERED by the powerful
electrical blast.
Indiana runs into a small ALLEYWAY. The burning fuse STRETCHES up
along the alley wall, moving to the ROOFTOP. Indy begins to climb the
ancient golden bricks that PROTRUDE from the wall. TOWARD the roof.
Gutterbuhg APPEARS. He SHOOTS at Indiana, who avoids the blast by
LEAPING onto the roof. Gutterbuhg hurriedly begins to CLIMB the wall.
FOLLOWING Indiana.
Scraggy and his crew members load ANOTHER FIREBALL onto the catapult.
Scraggy cries "FIRE!" The fireball FLIES over the city walls. It lands
DIRECTLY IN FRONT of the Nazi troops who are about to attack Tyki.
Many of the soldiers CATCH FIRE. The others RUN from the flames. Tyki
is UNHURT. He REJOINS his friends in the battle.
CUT TO:
CLARE AND BETSY
BREATHLESS...FRIGHTENED...they continue to RUN through the jungle. The
Nazis are a few feet BEHIND THEM. Moving FAST. Getting CLOSER. The
women turn a corner, scramble through a section of bushes and find
themselves face to face with...ANOTHER TROOP OF NAZIS.
Clare and Betsy STOP. TRAPPED. SURROUNDED by Nazis. The soldiers MOVE
TOWARD the women. The Nazis eyes are LECHEROUS. HUNGRY. Clare WHISPERS
to a TREMBLING Betsy.
CLARE
Do exactly what I do.
Betsy NODS. The Nazis MOVE CLOSER. Clare looks to the SKY. She begins
to make BIZARRE...HIGH PITCHED...NOISES. A CONFUSED Betsy makes the
same noises. The Nazis LOOK at each other and CHUCKLE. The women
CONTINUE to make the sounds.
Suddenly, the exact sound seems to ECHO FROM THE SKY. It becomes
LOUDER... LOUDER... But it belongs to A HUNDRED VOICES. The Nazis
PAUSE. Looking UPWARD. PUZZLED.
There is a SPLATTERING OF BIRDS. They ATTACK from above. The birds'
screeching is IDENTICAL to Clare and Betsy's calls. The angry birds
ATTACK THE NAZIS. PECKING. SCRATCHING. BITING. Clare and Betsy
CONTINUE to make the sounds, which causes the birds to IGNORE THEM.
The Nazis SCREAM. DROPPING their weapons. FALLING to their knees. Each
soldier is COVERED with birds. They are being TORN TO SHREDS. Clare
and Betsy TURN and RUN. ESCAPING into the jungle. The Nazis' screaming
ECHOES behind them. As they run, Clare EXPLAINS to Betsy.
CLARE
I made the sound of a baby Swandola
bird, crying for help... The Mother
birds immediately reply to the cries
...angrily protecting their
children, and murdering the baby's
attackers.
CUT TO:
THE TWO CANVAS TRUCKS
They crookedly FLOAT along the shark infested moat waters. The
battered, bruised trucks now resemble two sinking PIRATE SHIPS. Kezure
and the Pirates BATTLE the Nazis along the truck frames. The pirates
fight in their element... WATER! With fast SWINGING SWORDS, the
Pirates are defeating the Nazis. Several Nazis fall INTO THE WATER and
are immediately ATTACKED by countless SHARKS.
At one point, Kezure FALLS INTO THE WATER. Several SHARKS come for
him. The Pirate King DISAPPEARS beneath the water surface. A few of
his men PAUSE. WORRIED. AFRAID. Suddenly, Kezure LEAPS OUT OF THE
WATER. He holds a LIVE SHARK in his hands. The crazed Kezure TAKES A
BITE from the shark. He TOSSES the fish back into the water. Kezure
CHEWS ana SWALLOWS the raw shark meat. BLOOD spills down his chin.
Kezure resumes his FIGHTING with the Nazis, as the two truck frames
continue to SINK.
CUT TO:
Several Nazis are SPRAWLED on the tank floor. UNCONSCIOUS. UNDRESSED.
CAMERA PANS UPWARD. The Gorillas have TAKEN CONTROL of the tank. They
have DRESSED THEMSELVES IN NAZI UNIFORMS!
The Nazis stare through their PERISCOPE. Puzzled by the sight of their
own tank COMING TOWARD THEM.
The Gorillas break into a VICTORIOUS CHEER. JUMPING. SCREAMING.
CUT TO:
Indiana WALKS across the coliseum floor. REVOLVER in hand. He moves
SLOWLY. CAUTIOUSLY. He is looking for a SIGN of Mephisto. But
everything is SILENT. CALM. DESERTED.
Mephisto SNEAKS along the top wall of the coliseum. HIDING behind the
row of surrounding BELLS. The Nazi UNLATCHES the chain that holds all
of the bells in place. The bells begin to FALL. THUNDERING down the
coliseum stairs.
Indy COVERS his ears. The sound of countless CLANGING BELLS is nearly
deafening. He TURNS. Seeing the enormous bells ROLLING TOWARD HIM!
Indiana begins to RUN. GIANT ROLLING BELLS CHASE HIM FROM ALL
DIRECTIONS! Indy TWISTS...TURNS...LEAPS...in an effort to avoid being
CRUSHED by the heavy bells.
Mephisto WATCHES from above. SMILING.
Indy CONTINUES to run. A giant ROLLING BELL chases him from behind.
The bell GAINS SPEED. Getting CLOSER. CLOSER. A few feet in front of
Indy...is the deadly TIGER PIT. But Indy CAN'T STOP RUNNING, or he'll
be CRUSHED by the bell. Indiana LEAPS INTO THE PIT! The bell ROLLS
DIRECTLY OVER the pit.
But Indiana is SAFE. There is a FIVE INCH DROP from the ground, to the
pit's OVERHEAD METAL BARS. Indy LIES on the bars. SAFELY above the
countless TIGERS.
The bells have all COME TO A STOP. They LIE around the coliseum
ground. STILL. Only one bell GENTLY ROCKS. It slowly TEETERS on the
coliseum stairs. It HASN'T yet rolled off.
Indiana begins to CLIMB OUT out of the pit, when suddenly... ANOTHER
GUNSHOT RINGS OUT. Indy is HIT. In the CHEST. He SLIPS. FALLS. Bis
wounded body is SPRAWLED on the bars. TEETERING. Ready to FALL into
the waiting tigers.
Mephisto's luger is SMOKING. The Nazi WALKS down the coliseum stairs.
He moves TOWARD Indiana. Seeing Mephisto heading for him... Indiana
REMOVES his gun. He AIMS at the Nazi. But Indy's vision is BLURRED.
His hand TREMBLES. Mephisto's silhouette nears... But the bullet ZIPS
PAST Mephisto and STRIKES a section of wood below the teetering bell.
This causes the bell to FALL...and slowly ROLL forward.
Mephisto ARRIVES at the edge of the Tiger Pit. He is about to shoot
Indy...then comes upon ANOTHER IDEA. Mephisto LOWERS the luger. He
gives a SWIFT KICK to Indy's ribs. Indiana FALLS THROUGH the bars. His
arm SHOOTS OUT. With his last bit of strength, Indy's hand GRABS HOLD
of a bar. CLUTCHING on for dear life. His body DANGLES over the
tigers. They SNAP at his legs. HUNGRY. GROWLING. Mephisto SMILES. He
STEPS on Indy's fingers. GRINDING them beneath his boot heel. Indy
CRIES OUT... He's going to FALL...
Mephisto PAUSES. He HEARS something behind him. A CLANGING BELL.
Getting CLOSER. LOUDER. Mephisto TURNS. He sees the GIANT BELL. COMING
at him. Only INCHES AWAY. There is NO TIME to move. The bell ROLLS
OVER MEPHISTO. KNOCKING him INTO THE PIT.
Mephisto FALLS through the bars. INSIDE the pit. INTO the middle of
the hungry tigers. Mephisto SCREAMS. The tigers are UPON HIM. The Nazi
is RIPPED TO SHREDS. Within seconds, his screams are a MEMORY.
A very WEAK Indiana still clutches the bar. He manages to BOOST
himself out of the pit. He takes a FEW STEPS. WOBBLING. BLOOD pours
from the wound in his chest. He STUMBLES. To his KNEES. His eyes ROLL
BACK. He FALLS to the ground. His body is STILL. MOTIONLESS.
CUT TO:
The Gorillas, still dressed as NAZIS, continue to DRIVE THE TANK
FORWARD.
The Gorillas are ECSTATIC. HOWLING. CHEERING.
CUT TO:
KEZURE AND THE PIRATES
They have DEFEATED all of the Nazis. One of the canvas trucks has
completely SUNK. Only a small section of the other truck JUTS OUT of
the water. The Pirates CLING to the fleeting safety of the sinking
truck frame, which is surrounded by several HUNGRY SHARKS. There are
even TOO MANY maneaters for the powerful Kezure to handle. As the
frame continues to SINK...the Pirates' feet get CLOSER...CLOSER...to
the snapping sharks...
Suddenly, a ROPE DROPS FROM OVERHEAD! Kezure LOOKS UP. SCRAGGY and his
crew members stand on the DRAWBRIDGE. They have DROPPED the line.
Kezure and the Pirates CLIMB upward. To SAFETY.
On the drawbridge, Scraggy ASSISTS Kezure. Scraggy SMILES, repeating
Kezure's earlier threat.
SCRAGGY
You owe me, old man.
Kezure LAUGHS. He EMBRACES Scraggy. They are joined by TYKI and the
OTHER PYGMIES. A sudden CALM...a sudden SILENCE...overcomes the city.
The battle has ENDED. The Nazis have been DEFEATED. The city is SAVED.
But Tyki is SOLEMN. DISTRESSED. He STARES OFF SCREEN. CAMERA PANS TO
HIS P.O.V. We see the countless BODIES OF PYGMIES. SPRAWLED on the
ground. DEAD. The price you pay for FREEDOM. Suddenly, the silence is
INTERRUPTED. Someone is CRYING. It is BETSY.
Scraggy looks OFF SCREEN, to the direction of the sounds. The color
LEAVES his face.
SCRAGGY'S P.O.V.
A group of pygmies CARRY the limp body of Indiana Jones out of the
coliseum. They GENTLY LOWER Indy's body to the ground. Clare and Betsy
KNEEL beside Indy. TEARS run down Betsy's face.
Scraggy suddenly BREAKS AWAY from the crowd. CAMERA DOLLIES WITH HIM
as he runs toward Indy. Scraggy STOPS at Indy's body. Clare, eyes
FILLED with tears NODS to Scraggy. She can BARELY utter the words...
CLARE
He's...dead...
TEARS erupt in Scraggy's eyes. He breaks down CRYING. A startled
KEZURE joins the others. CAMERA PULLS BACK to an extremely LONG SHOT.
The entire village GATHERS around Indiana's body. Everyone is SOLEMN.
SILENT.
A SLOW DISSOLVE:
CLOSE-UP: INDIANA'S BODY.
It is LYING in state. Resting on a BAMBOO STRETCHER. It is covered
with EXOTIC, COLORFUL FLOWERS. CAMERA PULLS BACK. Indy is being
carried by several, elaborately dressed PYGMIES. At the head of a long
FUNERAL PROCESSION. Betsy, Clare, Scraggy and Kezure MARCH beside
Indy's body. They also wear the ceremonial FUNERAL FLOWERS. Behind
them, the body of BOHBALA is being carried. And behind the ruler, the
bodies of all DEAD PYGMIES are being carried by the remaining
VILLAGERS and GORILLAS. It is NIGHTIME. All mourners are carrying
FLICKERING CANDLES. At the rear of the procession, a lone pygmy strums
an UNUSUAL STRING INSTRUMENT. This creates a HAUNTING melody.
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO A LONG SHOT, as we see the procession move
through the city. The hundreds of flickering candles against the dark
night sky create a BEAUTIFUL IMAGE. The procession arrives at a large
STONE WALL. It appears to be a DEAD END. Tyki WALKS to the wall.
He FALLS to his knees and begins to CHANT. Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and
Kezure WATCH. There is a SMALL RUMBLE. A hairline CRACK begins to form
in the mountain. As if it were being DRAWN by an invisible hand, the
crack forms a LARGE DOOR in the wall. The door slowly OPENS. An almost
BLINDING WHlTE LIGHT emanates from inside. Tyki ENTERS. The procession
FOLLOWS.
The procession ascends a TWISTING STONE STAIRCASE, that spirals
upward, where the light becomes BRIGHTER... BRIGHTER... At the
stairway top, there is ANOTHER DOORWAY. Tyki and the others ENTER.
Indiana's body is CARRIED through.
THE GARDEN OF IMMORTAL PEACHES!
A breathtakingly beautiful forest of never ending luscious green
trees, filled with succulent, ripe PEACHES. We have never seen COLORS
like this. So MAGICAL...so INTENSE... Bright SUNLIGHT shines from a
vivid blue sky. There is always a RAINBOW here. The procession ENTERS.
Scraggy, Clare, Betsy and Kezure stare in total WONDERMENT. Betsy is
PUZZLED by the bright sunlight.
BETSY
But... It's... It's the middle of
the night...
Tyki WHISPERS to Scraggy, who explains to Betsy.
SCRAGGY
Sun always shine in the Garden of
Immortal Peaches.
Clare NODS. Kezure is MESMERIZED by the peach trees. His mouth HANGS
OPEN. He TURNS to Scraggy.
KEZURE
These are the peaches that make one
...forever young?...
Scraggy NODS. Tyki LEADS the procession to a clearing in the garden.
Many freshly dug GRAVES are here. All of the bodies are carried to
SEPARATE GRAVES, including Indiana And Bohbala.
A few feet ahead of the graves, rests the LARGEST PEACH TREE in the
forest. It is much WIDER and TALLER than the others. There is a small,
glass encased TOMB built into the tree. Inside of the tomb, is a TINY
SKELETON. No more than FOUR FEET TALL. The skeleton is adorned with a
LION SKINNED ROBE and golden CROWN. In its hand, the skeleton clutches
the famous GOLDEN HOOPED ROD, a glorious, elaborate STAFF. An ancient
inscription is ETCHED IN STONE over the tomb. Pointing to the
inscription, Clare TURNS to Scraggy.
CLARE
What does it say?...
SCRAGGY
(translating)
"Our Lord... Our Master... Sun...
Wu... Kung"
THE SOUND TRACK MUSIC RISES. It is the tomb of the STONE MONKEY KING.
Clare exchanges an AWE INSPIRED glance with Betsy, then looks to the
still body of Indiana.
CLARE
Damn you, Jones! Why couldn't you be
here to share this with me!
The pygmies begin to LOWER the dead bodies, including Indiana and
Bohbala, into the ground. Tyki reads from ANCIENT SCRIPTURE. Scraggy
SOBS on the shoulder of Kezure, who continues to stare in ASTONISHMENT
at the peach trees.
Suddenly, there is a RUMBLING SOUND. Followed by a slight, TREMOR. The
trees begin to SWAY, as a HOWLING WIND rushes through them. The tomb
of Sun Wu Kung GLOWS with a BRIGHT LIGHT. The glass surrounding the
tomb suddenly SHATTERS. The skeleton's head TURNS. Its body RATTLES.
Beginning to MOVE. The skeleton STEPS OUT OF THE TOMB.
Everyone STARES in awe. TERRIFIED.
The skeleton takes a FEW STEPS forward, STOPS, and RAISES its arms.
HIGH in the air. The skeleton OPENS its mouth. Emitting a HIGH PITCHED
...UNEARTHLY...SCREECH! An ectoplasmic GREEN SMOKE seeps from the
skeleton's fingers, slowly TRAVELING over the heads of the humans. The
ectoplasm separates into several INDIVIDUAL LINES, that touch down
upon EACH OF THE GORILLAS. The ectoplasm ENCIRCLES each the Gorilla's
bodies. The Gorillas begin to RISE from the ground. HIGH in the air.
The ectoplasm appears to be CARRYING them toward Sun Wu Kung. As the
Gorillas TRAVEL through the air, their bodies begin to SHRINK. Growing
SMALLER. THINNER.
The humans stare into the SKY. Watching the AMAZING, MAGICAL
TRANSFORMATION.
As the Gorillas get CLOSER to Sun Wu Kung, their bodies have shrunken
to TINY, HAIR-LIKE substances. When the Gorillas ARRIVE at the
skeleton, they ATTACH themselves to his body. We see that the shrunken
Gorillas are actually individual HAIRS on the skeleton's body. As the
countless hairs CONVERGE, the skeleton begins to take SHAPE...FORM...
SUN WU KUNG COMES TO LIFE! He is UNLIKE anyone or anything we have
ever seen. HALF-HUMAN. HALF-HONKEY. His face is covered with WRINKLES.
His wide eyes are COAL BLACK. PROBING. WARM. When he smiles, it is
DEVILISH, but incredibly CHARMING. His movements are PERKY. QUICK. An
extremely ADORABLE little fellow. Instantly LOVABLE. But there is a
STRONG, POWERFUL presense about him. He is indeed, a HEAVENLY FIGURE.
Sun Wu Kung LOOKS over the congregation. Everyone FALLS to their
knees. Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and a RELUCTANT Kezure do the same.
Sun Wu Kung PACES through the clearing. He LOOKS into the many graves.
He is DISTRESSED. TROUBLED. His wrinkled face twists into FURIOUS
expression. He RAISES his golden hooped rod to the sky. He SCREAMS.
His old voice CREAKS and GROANS.
SUN WU KUNG
We cannot bury these men!... This is
a garden of life... Not of death!...
Betsy WHISPERS to Clare.
BETSY
Why's he speakin' in English?
CLARE
He is a heavenly being. According to
legend, when a heavenly being
speaks, men of all countries can
understand him. We hear him in
English...the pygmies hear him in
their language.
Betsy NODS. Sun Wu Kung CONTINUES his heartfelt scream into the
heavens.
SUN WU KUNG
Return their souls!... I demand
it!... Return their souls!
A few MOMENTS pass. Then...a thick, white cloud ECLIPSES the sun. A
small hole in the cloud, allows one RAY OF SUNLIGHT to shine through.
The ray shines down upon ONE PARTICULAR PEACH TREE. Sun Wu Kung TURNS
to that peach tree. He raises the GOLDEN HOOPED ROD toward the tree.
He begins to SING an unusual hymn. Suddenly, several peaches magically
FLY from the trees. They congregate ABOVE the golden hooped rod. The
peaches SPIN in midair. With quick movements of the rod, Sun Wu Kung
SENDS several peaches flying OFF SCREEN.
CAMERA FOLLOWS the magical peaches as they SEPARATE and FLY INTO EACH
GRAVE. Toward the BODIES OF THE DEAD PYGMIES. Each body is HIT with an
individual peach. When the peaches MAKE CONTACT with the dead bodies,
there is a small, colorful EXPLOSION. A small FIREWORKS display. The
bodies erupt with a BRIGHT GOLDEN GLOW. A few moments PASS. One of the
bodies STIRS. MOVES. The body SITS UP. Gets to its FEET. ANOTHER BODY
does the same. So does ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. Soon, the various pygmies
CLIMB out of the graves. Their wounds have DISAPPEARED. Their life has
been RESTORED.
Sun Wu Kung flings the remaining TWO PEACHES into the GRAVES of
Indiana and Bohbala. There is a small EXPLOSION...followed by the WARM
GLOW of their bodies. The wound in Indy's chest VANISHES. His eyes POP
OPEN. To the delight of his friends, Indy STANDS. ALIVE. He is
PUZZLLED by the surrounding grave. Clare, Scraggy and Betsy HELP
Indiana OUT of the grave. They SHOWER him with EMBRACES and KISSES.
But Indy remains CONFUSED. PUZZLED.
INDIANA
What the hell's goin' on?
Sun Wu Kung, looking very PLEASED with himself, stands BEHIND Indiana.
Clare SMILES at Indy.
CLARE
I think there is someone you should
meet...
Clare POINTS to behind Indy, who TURNS and sees the smiling SUN WU
KUNG. Indy is at first SHOCKED... His face breaks into a CHILDLIKE
SMILE...filled with DELIGHT. He then manages to UTTER...
INDIANA
You... You're... Sun Wu Kung?...
Sun Wu Kung STEPS FORWARD. He nods and ANSWERS.
SUN WU KUNG
You are... Indiana Jones?...
INDIANA
(taken aback)
Huh?... You know me?
SUN WU KUNG
(nods)
I have watched you for many, many
years...from the heavens. I was
fascinated by your bravery...your
passion...in searching for me.
INDIANA
Well, I... Thanks I'm very honored.
SUN WU KUNG
The honor is mine, Doctor Jones. You
and your friends have saved my city
from ruin.
(a pause)
I would like to return the favor.
Sun Wu Kung gives Indiana the GOLDEN HOOPED ROD. Indiana takes the
PRICELESS ARTIFACT. He STARES at the beautiful rod. He is very MOVED.
SPEECHLESS. Sun Wu Kung EXPLAINS. RAISES an eyebrow.
SUN WU KUNG
The Golden Hooped Rod will be a
faithful friend. It is capable of
one hundred transformations...and
will always remain by your side.
Indy manages a NOD. Sun Wu Kung SIGHS.
SUN WU KUNG
I will explore the heavens for
another. Surely, my search will be
shorter and less hazardous than
yours!
Indiana SMILES.
Meanwhile, Kezure uses the oppurtunity to SNEAK AWAY. He DISAPPEARS
into a cluster of PEACH TREES. He CLIMBS the smallest tree. The GREEDY
Pirate King begins to PICK several peaches. HIDING them in his
pockets.
Sun Wu Kung LOOKS OVER the healthy, restored community of pygmies. The
Monkey King SMILES.
SUN WU KUNG
With my city alive again...I will be
able to return to the heavens.
(warm smile to Indy and
the others)
Goodbye...my dear friends.
Sun Wu Kung again RAISES his arms. Green ECOTPLASM again emanates from
his fingers. The individual strands of HAIR fly from his body. In a
reversal of what we saw only moments ago, the strands of hair FLY
through the air. They grow LARGER...LARGER...until they resume the
shape of the GORILLAS.
Sun Wu Kung has RETURNED to his skeletal form. He TURNS and WALKS back
to his resting place. The pieces of broken glass RE-ASSEMBLE. SEALING
the tomb.
Kezure, his pockets STUFFED with peaches, hurriedly REJOINS the
others. Tyki EMBRACES Bohbala, glad to have his Father ALIVE. Bohbala,
resuming his position as Ruler, LEADS HIS PEOPLE out of the garden.
Indiana, CLUTCHING his golden hooped prize, EXITS with the others.
CUT TO:
Clare is SOUND ASLEEP in bed. CAMERA PANS TO a corner of the room. The
wooden crate holding the Golden Hooped Rod RESTS here. Suddenly, the
box's NAILS begin to TWIST. TURN. As if they were being turned by
INVISIBLE HANDS. They FALL OUT of the box. DROPPING to the floor. ONE
by ONE. The box SLOWLY OPENS. The Golden Hooped Rod SHIKMERS in the
moonlight. Suddenly, the staff begins to MOVE. TWISTING. SHRINKING. It
CHANGES SHAPE...turning into a GOLDEN EAGLE! The bird slowly FLAPS its
wings and FLIES OUT of the open window. INTO the night. Clare
continues to peacefully SLEEP.
CUT TO:
Indiana Jones is SOUND ASLEEP in his bed. The room's porthole
mysteriously SWINGS OPEN. The Golden Eagle FLIES inside. The eagle
TRANSFORMS back into the Golden Hooped Rod. The rod LEANS AGAINST the
wall. The moonlight REFLECTS the rod, SHINING into Indiana's eyes.
Indy WAKES. He SITS UP and sees the Golden Hooped Rod. At first, he is
SHOCKED. He TOUCHES the rod...then comes upon a REALIZATION. The
CREAKY VOICE of Sun Wu Kung FILLS the SOUNDTRACK.
SUN WU KUNG (V.O.)
The Golden Hooped Rod will be a
faithful friend. It is capable of
one hundred transformations...and
will always remain by your side.
Indy STANDS. He turns and LOOKS out of the porthole. A DREAMY...
SATISFIED smile covers Indy's face, as he stares at the stars ABOVE.
SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS. CAMERA PULLS BACK, TO EXTREMELY LONG SHOT of
the ship SAILING across the ocean.
