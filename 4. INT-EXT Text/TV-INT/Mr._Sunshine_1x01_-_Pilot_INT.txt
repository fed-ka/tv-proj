Ben looks around a corner for the elephant, sees the coast is 
clear and waves to Roman to follow him.  Roman struggles to 
keep up.

Ben is walking dejectedly past a security station where the 
security guard is watching an episode of National Geographic.  
ON THE MONITOR we see a wild elephant destroying everything 
in it s path.  Ben watches for a moment, then:

frantically in the other direction.


Ben sits alone, high up in the arena.  Roman approaches and 
sits down next to him, his second hand now bandaged as well.

Ben and Roman are walking in a tunnel where the circus acts 
have set up their staging areas.  Ben sees Alonzo with a 
group of inner-city kids meeting some clowns in full make-up.  
 shoes.  After a Ben notices Alonzo tying one of the kid s

then Ben sees a FIRE AXE mounted on the wall with the sign

They turn to follow Ben.


Scores of people including the Steves, circus workers and 
clowns chip away at the ice with axes, shovels and picks.  
Others begin to remove it in wheelbarrows.  In the deep 
background we see the mascot jump from some high scaffolding, 
onto the trampoline, and hurl himself into the empty seats.


The charity event is about to start.  The small audience 
includes REPORTERS, PHOTOGRAPHERS, SOCIAL DIGNITARIES and the 
CHILDREN from the youth group.  Crystal stands at the side.  
Just outside the door, Ben and Roman are about to enter, when 
Roman stops.

Ben takes in Roman: sweaty, disheveled, bandaged hands.

BEN

They enter.  Roman takes a seat as Ben heads over to Crystal.  
Alonzo approaches the podium.

Roman cocks his head confused.  Ben sees this and gives him a 
sympathetic smile and thumbs-up.  Roman lifts his hands to 
return the gesture, but his thumbs are completely covered by 
the bandages.  He then turns and notices Heather, all dolled-
up sitting next to him, and staring at him intensely.  Roman 
shows an equal mixture of titillation and horror.  Just then 
Ben sees Alice at the back of the room.  She is distracted, 
deep in thought.

 in The words resonate with Ben as he realizes that what s
front of him is Alice.  He watches her as she snaps out of 
her pensive stare, turns and exits.


Ben stands with Crystal who is being positioned in front of 
the photographers.  She is holding the TROPHY, standing 
amongst the children who hold a LARGE $50,000 CHECK.

Crystal panics.  She drops the trophy, grabs the giant check 
from the children, and hurls it at the clowns.  Missing, she 
grabs a couple kids and throws them to the floor in an effort 
to block the clowns  path.  She screams and runs in the other 
direction as photographers fire off pictures.

KIDS

Ben knocks and enters a small office off the arena floor 
where he finds Alice.

BEN

the office window, surreptitiously watches her deliver the 
big news to Alonzo.  Alonzo excitedly embraces her, lifting 
her off her feet.  Ben smiles through a bit of sadness and 
walks slowly away.


Ben walks onto the ice where the clowns, circus workers, and 
Steves are still working.  The ice is now half cleared away, 
and the circus is beginning to set up.  Ben stops and sees an 
axe laying at his feet.  Ben smiles, picks up the axe and 
brings it down onto the ice.  On the image of the ice
