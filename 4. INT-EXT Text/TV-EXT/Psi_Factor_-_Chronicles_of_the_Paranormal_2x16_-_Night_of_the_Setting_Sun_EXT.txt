      The entrance to an abandoned factory complex from the 1800s.

      FRANCO, a punk in his early twenties, wearing shiny white
      running shoes, sniffs the cold night air.  RATTLES the gate.

                                      FRANCO
                    It's locked.  It's been locked
                    forever.

      With an apologetic smile, he turns to...

      CLAUDIA VICKERS.  Vickers is in her early thirties, fit and
      well put together in a Roots-style bomber jacket.  She's too
      glamorous to be skulking around an old factory late at night.

                                      FRANCO (CONT'D)
                    Over here.

      Franco walks away from the gate and along the high brick
      wall.  Vickers follows.

                                      VICKERS
                    What about security?

      Franco tries to put her at ease.

                                      FRANCO
                    Ms Vickers, I've been in and out of
                    here four, five times.  I got you
                    covered.

      Franco piles up discarded crates to form makeshift steps
      against the brick wall.

                                      FRANCO (CONT'D)
                    That's why I was thinking, I know we
                    said six hundred.  But really it
                    should be more like seven-fifty.  To
                    be fair.

                                      VICKERS
                    Franco, let's see if you found what
                    I'm looking for.  Then we'll talk.                                    Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 2.

      Franco and Vickers clamber to the top of the wall.  They
      swing over and drop inside the complex.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Vickers and Franco skulk along.  Franco nods.  This way.

      POV THE WATCHER

      Observes, unseen, as Vickers and Franco step into...


      MOONLIGHT cuts through the clouds.  Their FOOTSTEPS ECHO.

      They look at each other.  Vickers is starting to lose her
      nerve.  But then Vickers spots something.

                                      VICKERS
                          (excited)
                    There.

                                      FRANCO
                    See.  I told you.

      Vickers unfolds a large square of light canvas from her jacket
      pocket.  Holds it in front of herself.

      POV THE QUARRY

      As Vickers' canvas covers it and blocks out the light.

                                      VICKERS (O.S.)
                    Got it.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Vickers and Franco head to the gate.  Franco carries a LIVING
      CREATURE wrapped inside the canvas.  It squirms and SCREAMS.

                                      FRANCO
                    Geez.

      POV THE WATCHER

      Something's coming at them.  Fast.                                    Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 3.

      BACK TO FRANCO AND VICKERS

      As the unseen circles them.  They run like thieves.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPLEX --

      Vickers hauls herself to the top of the wall.  Turns back. 
      Holds out her arms.

                                      VICKERS
                    Give it to me!  Now!

      With a fearful backward glance, Franco hands Vickers the
      package.  It's SQUIRMING.

                                      VICKERS (CONT'D)
                    Hurry!

      Vickers jumps down to the ground.  Turns.  Looks for Franco.

      Franco manages to get his shoulders and arms onto the top of
      the wall.  He muscles his torso up top.  He's going to make
      it.  He swings his legs around.  But...

      Something pulls him back down.

                                      FRANCO
                    Ms Vickers!  Help me!

      Franco clings to the wall's rim but he is losing the battle.

                                      VICKERS
                    C'mon!

      And Franco is gone.

                                      FRANCO (O.S.)
                          (high-pitched, shriek)
                      Noooooooo!

      And then, worse - SILENCE.  Beat.

                                      VICKERS
                    Franco!

      Something moves on the far side of the wall.  Vickers runs
      into the night carrying the squirming bundle.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                      END OF TEASER                                    Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 4.

                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      Even in the daylight, the factory complex looks forbidding. 
      Abandoned.  Untouched since the 1880's.

      MATT PRAEGER (late 30s, intense) trails after L.Q. COOPER.

      Praeger is the Case Manager, the team leader of a group of
      scientific operatives who investigate the strange and
      paranormal for the Office of Scientific Investigation and
      Research (OSIR).

      Cooper is the team cryptozoologist.  He is an odd little man
      whose eyes swim behind his thick glasses.

                                      COOPER
                          (simmering)
                    Vickers calls herself an
                      ornithologist.  But she's really
                    just an animal smuggler.

                                      PRAEGER
                    And Elsinger authorized how much?

                                      COOPER
                    We paid $74,000.

                                      PRAEGER
                          (teasing Cooper)
                    That's good money for a rat with
                    wings.
                          (off Cooper's look)
                    It's a pigeon.                                    Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 5.

                                      COOPER
                    Matt, Vickers sold us a passenger
                    pigeon.  They've been extinct since
                    1914.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Yup, In Search of...the Psi Pigeon.

      Praeger considers the factory complex.

                                      PRAEGER (CONT'D)
                    Coop, you sure this is the place?

                                      COOPER
                    Vickers found it around here.  It's
                    possible that a roost of passengers
                    survived this century in these old
                      buildings.

                                      PRAEGER
                    This is practically downtown.
                          (intrigued)
                    Why hasn't this land been developed?

                                      COOPER
                    You can ask the owner.

                                      PRAEGER
                    If he ever gets here.

                                      COOPER
                    I don't understand why he's late. 
                    Mr. Stephenson was very cooperative
                    on the phone.

      A LATE MODEL SEDAN rumbles past them to a stop, about twenty
      feet away, next to the gate.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Well, let's see a man about a pigeon.

      Cooper and Praeger approach the car.  They find...

      STEPHENSON (early twenties, ashen, expensive clothes) slumped
      in the front seat.  Praeger knocks on the window.  Stephenson
      pulls himself upright, clinging to the steering wheel.

                                      PRAEGER (CONT'D)
                    Mr. Stephenson?

      Stephenson rouses himself.

                                      STEPHENSON
                    Yeah, right.                                    Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 6.

      He emerges from the car leaving the door open.  Praeger shoots
      a glance towards Cooper and gently closes the car door for
      Stephenson.

                                      COOPER
                    I'm L.Q. Cooper.  This is Matt
                    Praeger.

      Stephenson lurches towards the front gate.

                                      STEPHENSON
                    Don't know why no one ever called
                    before.  Don't know why.  But...
                          (coughs)
                    I didn't even know about them until
                    my father died.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Who?  The pigeons?

      Stephenson flails about, distraught.  Guilt ridden.

                                      STEPHENSON
                    The workmen.  I didn't know.  But
                    you knew about them, didn't you, Mr.
                    Praeger?  The workmen?

                                      PRAEGER
                    Whoa, you're going too fast.

                                      STEPHENSON
                    That's the real reason you called. 
                    I'll show you everything.  It's the
                      responsible thing to do.  I'm a
                      responsible boy.

      He laughs until he dissolves into HACKING COUGHS.

                                      PRAEGER
                    You okay?

                                      STEPHENSON
                    Right as rain.  Here we are.

      Stephenson unlocks the front gate.  He keels over.  Crumples
      to the ground.

                                      PRAEGER
                      Stephenson!

      Cooper bends to examine him.

      As blood bubbles from Stephenson's mouth --

                                                                                  CUT TO:                                    Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 7.


      The back door of an ambulance SLAMMING SHUT.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL

      Cooper and Praeger watch the ambulance pull away.

                                      PRAEGER (V.O.)
                    Case log update.  We are attempting
                    to determine the point of origin of
                    a species of bird long thought to be
                    extinct.  Our investigation has been
                      complicated by the sudden death of
                    our contact, Neal Stephenson.

      Praeger nods to DR. CLAIRE DAVISON (35, trim, efficient) as
      she gets into her OSIR vehicle.

                                      PRAEGER (CONT'D)
                      Pathologist Claire Davison will
                    conduct the autopsy.  Praeger out.

      Cooper and Praeger are joined by PETER AXON (28, well-dressed,
      a bit of a hot shot) and DR. ANTON HENDRICKS (60, scholarly). 
      Axon carries techno-gak.

      The others follow Praeger onto...


      A cobblestone street lined with eight old factories and
      stores.  At the end of the street you can look up and see an
      elevated expressway.  Hear the cars BUZZ by.

      Cautiously, they move forward.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      A PIGEON promenades between two buildings.  Hendricks and
      Cooper watch it go.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Is that one?

                                      COOPER
                    No, Anton.  That is a common pigeon,
                    a rock dove.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    All right.  So what does a passenger
                    pigeon look like?

                                      COOPER
                    You'll know it when you see it.

      As they walk out of view:

                                      COOPER (CONT'D)
                    It has a long pointy tail.  Its eyes
                    and throat are rust.  It's a beauty.

      OFF Hendricks' amusement --

                                                                                  CUT TO:                                    Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 9.


      Axon leads with the magnetoscope.  Praeger flaps his cell
      phone closed.

                                    AXON
                    When's Donner getting here?

                                      PRAEGER
                    As soon as she finishes her background
                    checks.  Vickers has dropped out of
                    sight.  The world of exotic animal
                    sales is shadier than I thought.

                                    AXON
                    Don't get Cooper started.

                                      PRAEGER
                          (re: their search)
                    How we doing here?

                                    AXON
                    You see that?

                                      PRAEGER
                          (over Axon's shoulder)
                      A magnetic pulse.

                                    AXON
                    Yeah.  In a big way.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Let's try to track it to its source.

                                    AXON
                    There is no single source.  We're
                    standing on the mother of all magnets.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 10.

                                    AXON (CONT'D)
                          (waves his probe around)
                    Could be picking up be iron waste
                    dumped here before there were
                      environmental regs.  Or maybe
                      magnetite.

      Axon plunges a core sampler into the earth.  While he works...

      Praeger finds a WHITE RUNNING SHOE at the base of the
      perimeter wall.  He points out a discoloration on the shoe.

                                    AXON (CONT'D)
                    Paint?

                                      PRAEGER
                    Or blood.

      Praeger's cell phone BUZZES.

                                      PRAEGER (CONT'D)
                    Praeger.

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:


      Axon, Praeger and Hendricks confer.  Praeger is answering
      Hendricks' question.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Yes.  She was quite specific.  Spanish
                      Influenza.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    That's impossible.  That strain hasn't
                    been seen since 1919.

                                    AXON
                          (bit nervous)
                    Anton, you're talking about the flu
                    here.  How bad could it be?

                                      HENDRICKS
                    During the 1918 flu pandemic, millions
                    perished.  More people died from it
                    than in the trenches of World War I.

                                    AXON
                    So how did they stop it?

                                      HENDRICKS
                    They didn't.  Without explanation,
                    the strain disappeared.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Until today.  And we were exposed to
                      Stephenson.

                                    AXON
                    And we were exposed to you.  So we
                    could all have it.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Not necessarily.  In 1918 many
                    hospital workers never picked up the
                    infection at all.  Or they survived
                    thinking they'd just had a cold.

      Axon sneezes.  Everyone looks at Axon.  Axon rolls his eyes.

                                      HENDRICKS (CONT'D)
                    But its victims, predominately young
                    men, often died within forty-eight
                    hours.

                                    AXON
                      Wonderful.  What about antibiotics?                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 12.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    They won't work on a virus.  We need
                      a vaccine.  And to find the source
                    of the outbreak before it spreads.

                                    AXON
                    Maybe we should turn ourselves in
                    for quarantine.

      That gives Praeger an idea.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Maybe we should stay right here. 
                    This is pretty isolated.
                          (wry to Axon)
                    Here's your chance to get away from
                    it all.

                                    AXON
                    Great.

                                      COOPER (O.S.)
                    Guys.  Look at this!  Look at this!

      REVEAL Cooper, cradling a filthy pigeon.

      OFF Cooper's joy --

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Praeger is on his cell phone.  He walks along the side of
      the OSIR mobile lab.

                                      PRAEGER
                          (into phone)
                    Okay, Lindsay, what've you got?

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:


      Cooper, Axon, and Praeger emerge from the mobile lab.

                                      COOPER
                    I think we can find the pigeons'
                    roost before dark.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Don't leave town.

      Cooper heads off.  Axon and Praeger set off in the other
      direction.  No signs of life.  Axon admires the buildings.

                                    AXON
                      Beautiful.  You know, I think I would
                    have loved to live in the 1890s.  An
                    age of new possibilities.  Scientists
                    were like rock stars...

                                      PRAEGER
                    ...who ate pigeon meat.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 17.

      Axon listens to something in the distance.

                                    AXON
                    You hear that?

      They listen.  In the distance, faint, is the SOUND of a
      skipping rope SLAPPING against stone.  A reedy, little girl's
      voice drifts towards them:

                                    GIRL (O.S.)
                    I had a little bird...and its name
                    was Enza...

      The wind shifts and wipes away the sound.

                                      PRAEGER
                          (calls out)
                    Hello!

                                    AXON
                    Who's there?

      No response.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Praeger shudders.

                                    AXON
                    What is that -- you got a chill?

                                      PRAEGER
                    I'm fine.

                                    AXON
                    You heard what Anton said.  If you've
                    got the bug, you should head back to
                    the mobile lab.

      He moves close to Axon.  Whispers in his ear.

                                      PRAEGER
                    It's just my spidey sense going off. 
                    Someone is watching us.

      They wait, watch and listen.  In the distance, a DOOR BANGS.

      They race towards the source of the noise.  Turn a corner of
      a building to find --

      A door BANGING in the wind.  They dash through it and into...


      The sun is setting.

      Cooper rejoins Praeger and Axon.

                                      COOPER
                    You won't believe what I found.

                                    AXON
                    Easy there, Coop.

      They turn and see...

      POV OSIR TEAM

      Eight PEOPLE silhouetted against the sky.  The men wear Irish-
      style caps.  We can't make out their faces.

        A sepulchral little girl, SOPHIE, dangles a skipping rope.

      A tall man, JOSEF SCHULLMAN, steps forward.  Josef is in his
      early forties, dressed in jeans and a working man's shirt.

      Josef slides a shotgun shell into its chamber.  Points the
      shotgun at Praeger, Cooper and Axon.

                                      PRAEGER
                    This your discovery, Coop?

      OFF Praeger and Axon's concern --

      Josef steps forward.

                                      JOSEF
                    You must leave, Sirs.  Before I must
                    make you leave.

                                      COOPER
                          (quietly)
                    They must be the workmen Stephenson
                    was talking about.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Good help is so hard to find.
                          (beat)
                    We have permission to be here.  From
                    Mr Stephenson.

                                      JOSEF
                    He sent you?

                                      PRAEGER
                    Not exactly.

      A woman from the group, ELENA SCHULLMAN, 20s, attractive,
      steps forward.  She points at Axon's juice bottle.

                                      ELENA
                          (to Axon)
                    Sir.  Is that juice?

                                    AXON
                    Yes.

                                      ELENA
                    Could I please have some for my
                    sister?

      Praeger follows Elena's glance over to Sophie.

      POV PRAEGER -- of the SCHULLMANS

      They look gaunt, pale, haunted.  They haven't eaten for days.

                                      PRAEGER
                    We have supplies back in our trucks.

      Axon steps forward and offers the bottle.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 21.

                                      JOSEF
                    Stay right there!

                                      ELENA
                    You never have faith in people,
                    Cousin.  I told you Mr. Stephenson
                    would never let us down.  He will be
                    here soon enough himself.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Maybe this isn't the best time, but
                    about Mr. Stephenson...he's dead.

                                      JOSEF
                    No.

                                      PRAEGER
                    But please keep your distance.  We
                    may be sick with  influenza.  It
                    killed Mr. Stephenson.

                                      ELENA
                    We all had the grippe ages ago. 
                    Poor Mr. Stephenson.  He must have
                    caught it from us.

      Praeger catches Axon's eye.  Gives him the high sign.  Axon
      walks over to Sophie.

                                    AXON
                    My name's Peter.

                                      SOPHIE
                    I'm Sophie Schullman.  Very pleased
                    to meet you, Sir.

                                      ELENA
                    I'm Elena Schullman.  That's my
                    cousin, Josef.

      Josef lowers the shotgun.

      Axon hands Sophie the juice.

                                      SOPHIE
                    Thank you, Sir.

      She drinks thirstily.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                                    AXON
                    You know the Japanese believe that
                    magnets re-energize the iron in your
                    blood and prevent aging.  Maybe the
                    magnetic soil here is the reason for
                    your longevity.

                                      ELENA

                    Do I really look one hundred and
                    twenty years old?

                    Thank you, Sir.

      Elena's gaze is a little too intense for Axon so he steps a
      few steps away.  She links her arm through his.

                                      ELENA (CONT'D)
                    Have you been to Japan?

                                    AXON
                    Yes.  I stayed with a friend of mine. 
                    His apartment was so small, the fridge
                    was in the living room.  It was
                    emerald green.  All the refrigerators
                    there are colourful because, well,
                    they're in your living room.  A fridge
                    is like an...an ice box.

                                      ELENA
                    I am not as sheltered as you think. 
                    I see the cars go by on the roadway. 
                    I used to go to the moving picture
                    shows.  Mr. Stephenson would bring
                    me books.

                                    AXON
                    Sounds like he was sweet on you.

                                      ELENA
                    He was a boy.  He wanted to keep the
                    world away from us.  I have my own
                    ideas.

      The attraction between them grows.  Elena reaches over and
      gives him a kiss.  Axon kisses her back.

      Josef violently pulls Axon away from Elena.  Josef's eyes
      glitter with anger.  He has his shotgun.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 34.

                                      ELENA (CONT'D)
                    Josef.

                                    AXON
                    Take it easy.

                                      JOSEF
                    Sir, you don't understand.

                                    AXON
                    Oh, I think I understand fine.  But
                    I'm not getting in the middle of
                    anything here.

      Axon lunges forward, grabs the barrel.  The two men struggle.

      Axon bangs Josef against the building.  And again.  Josef
      lets go of the shotgun.  Slides down the side of the building
      to the ground.

                                    AXON (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.

      Axon walks away from him.  Hands the shotgun to Elena.  Heads
      towards Praeger who has been watching the action.

                                      ELENA
                    Peter!

                                      PRAEGER
                          (overlapping)
                    Axon!

      Josef tackles Axon from behind.  Axon goes down like a sack
      of potatoes.  They wrestle in the dirt.

      WHAP.  Axon takes one across the face.  WHAP.  Again.

      Axon breaks free.  Turns on Josef and clocks him.

                                    AXON
                          (in pain)
                    Gah!

      Axon nurses his right hand.

      Josef advances and...

      BLAM!

      Elena fires the shotgun into the air.

                                      ELENA
                    Enough!                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 35.

      The fight stops.  Josef wheels and faces his cousin.

                                      JOSEF
                    I don't like the game you are playing,
                    Cousin.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Elena, why don't I hang on to that
                    for a while?

                                      ELENA
                    As you wish.

      She hands him the shotgun.

                                      JOSEF
                    Call together everyone.  Decisions
                    must be made.

                                      ELENA
                    Josef.

                                      JOSEF
                    Now.

      Josef and Elena head into the factory building.

                                    AXON
                          (proud of himself)
                    Not bad for a physics major.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Can I see you for a moment?

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Axon and Praeger sit on the steps.

                                      PRAEGER
                    What did that accomplish?

                                    AXON
                    Matt, I was defending myself.

                                      PRAEGER
                    But Pete, you put yourself in that
                      situation.

                                    AXON
                    You're taking his side.

                                      PRAEGER
                    There are no sides here.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 36.

                                    AXON
                    They're lying to us.  I don't know
                    what they're hiding, but you're taking
                    their side.

                                      PRAEGER
                    We are guests here.

                                    AXON
                    Of Stephenson.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Of the Schullmans.  This feels like
                    their home.

                                    AXON
                    Like they've been here for a century?

                                      PRAEGER
                    We should step lightly.  There are
                    eight of them and four of us.
                          (re: shotgun)
                    And maybe Josef Schullman has another
                    noise maker.

                                    AXON
                    If you want me to roll over, I'll
                    roll over.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Just keep your mind on your work.

                                    AXON
                          (tight)
                    Noted.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Damn it, Pete.

      Before things get out of hand, Cooper pops out and...

                                      COOPER
                    There's a call for you, Matt.

                                      PRAEGER
                          (re: Axon's hand)
                    You want Anton to look at that?

                                    AXON
                    He'll just ice it down.

                                      PRAEGER
                    We'll continue this later.

      Praeger goes into the mobile lab.  Axon and Cooper.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 37.

                                      COOPER
                    I have to see Sophie.

      Cooper steps down off the gangplank and heads towards the
      tannery.  Axon follows Cooper.

                                    AXON
                    What's up?

                                      COOPER
                    I want to learn how the Schullmans
                    managed to breed the passengers in
                      captivity.  All attempts at the turn
                    of the century failed.

                                    AXON
                    Why?

                                      COOPER
                    The pigeons' migratory instincts
                    were so strong that they threw
                      themselves against aviary walls,
                    killing themselves.

                                    AXON
                    Hang on.  That fits.  Birds use the
                    earth's magnetic pole as a beacon in
                    their migrations.  Maybe the magnetic
                    pulses here countermanded the flock's
                    need to migrate.
                          (beat)
                    How's Lillian doing?

                                      COOPER
                    I just conducted the autopsy.

                                    AXON
                    Ah.  What killed her?

                                      COOPER
                    Old age.


      Axon runs through the deserted complex towards the mobile
      lab.  He thinks he HEARS SOMETHING over on his right.

      He's grabbed from his left and pulled into the shadows...

                                    AXON
                    No!

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Elena presses herself against Axon.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 45.

                                      ELENA
                    You smell good.

                                    AXON
                    There's a man in that building there. 
                    He's been hurt.

                                      ELENA
                    Josef wants us to leave, but I won't. 
                    Not without you.

                                    AXON
                    We have to get him help.

                                      ELENA
                    You can come with us.

                                    AXON
                    Are you listening to me?

                                      ELENA
                    Yes.

                                    AXON
                    I have to get a doctor.

                                      ELENA
                    Don't you worry about him.  He's
                    nothing - just a boy.

      Axon pushes her away from him.

                                      ELENA (CONT'D)
                    Come to me, Peter.  Don't push me
                    away.  Kiss me.  Please.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Elena nuzzles into Axon.

                                    RAY (O.S.)
                    Step away.

                                    AXON
                    Ray?

                                    RAY (O.S.)
                    You heard me.

                                    AXON
                    It's fine.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL

      Ray circling towards Elena and Axon, gun extended.

                                    RAY
                    Ma'am, step away from him.

                                      ELENA
                          (husky)
                    No.

      Axon steps back two or three paces.

                                    AXON
                    Put the gun down, Ray.

                                    RAY
                    Shut up.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 47.

                                      ELENA
                    Peter.

                                    RAY
                    Damn you're dense.

                                      ELENA
                    I need you!  NOW!

      With a guttural ROAR, Elena launches herself at Axon.

      She has a knife.  It glints in the moonlight.

      BAM!

      Elena is hit.  She slides from Axon's arms.

                                    AXON
                    What, what the hell did you do?

                                    RAY
                    I did you a favour.

      Ray turns Elena over and reveals to Axon that she had a 
      knife in her hand.

                                    AXON
                    We have to get her to a hospital.

                                    RAY
                    Whatever.

      Ray kicks the knife away.

      Praeger, Hendricks and Josef arrive.

                                      JOSEF
                    Elena.

      Josef cradles her in his arms.

                                    RAY
                    Matt, she was attacking Axon.

                                      JOSEF
                    I tried to warn you.

                                    RAY
                    We're getting out of here.  Where's
                    Cooper?

                                      COOPER
                    Here.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 48.

                                      JOSEF
                    Go.  I won't be able to hold my family
                    back for long.  They will hold you
                      responsible for this.

                                    AXON
                    This way.

      He picks up Elena.

                                    AXON (CONT'D)
                    Let me try to get her help.

                                      JOSEF
                    Yes, of course.
                          (bitter)
                    We must travel light.

                                      PRAEGER
                          (to Josef)
                    Where are you going?

                                      JOSEF
                    No.  Leave me!  You've done enough
                    for us already.

      Off Praeger's deep regret...

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Axon carries Elena.  Praeger and Hendricks carry Franco on
      their shoulder.  Ray's gun is out.

      They pass beside the mobile lab and see the front gate in
      front of them.  They are retreating.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Keep together.

      They hear MOANS and RUSTLES in the dark around them.

                                      HENDRICKS
                          (re: Franco)
                    I'm amazed he's still alive.

                                    RAY
                    Just keep moving.

      Hands come out of the darkness and grab at Cooper.  Ray fires
      a warning shot into the air.

      Praeger pulls Cooper away from his assailant.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 49.

      They race to the front gate and...

      Cooper turns, looks around and sees...

      A flock of pigeons take flight.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Axon is in the middle of a buzz of activity from COPS and
      OSIR TECHNICIANS.  He scuffs his feet along the ground.  His
      heart isn't in it.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 50.

                          (records again)
                    On our return to the site this
                    morning, we were unable to locate
                    any member of the Schullman family.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      A MAN watches the activity of police and OSIR technicians
      bustle around in the factory complex.

                                      PRAEGER (V.O.)
                    It is sad to think that it is
                    isolated, alone, the last of its
                    kind.  Praeger out.

      The man turns to face the camera - it is Josef.

                                                                                  CUT TO:
