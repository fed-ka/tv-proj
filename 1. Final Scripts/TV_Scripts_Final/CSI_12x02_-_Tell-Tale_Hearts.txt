                                      TEASER

  FADE IN:


1EXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT 1

    CAMERA RIPS down the Strip.  Favoring shots of LIGHTS.  The
    GLARE.  THE FLASH.  The VOLUME.  The SEXY.  We find our way
  to the flickering "WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS" SIGN.  

    CRUISE from it, across the DESERT, over RESIDENTIAL TRACTS
  and GOLF COURSES.  Then THROUGH an ADOBE WALL, into --


2EXT. FOREST GREEN SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY - NIGHT2

    A GATED COMMUNITY.  We land on a SIGN: "Forest Green
    Sustainable Community: Life. Simply Put."  Then SLIDE across
  it to FIND an old CADILLAC parked in front of a house.  


3INT. OLD CADILLAC - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)3

  Our INTRO SONG now on the CAR RADIO.  Look through the OPEN
    PASSENGER WINDOW, find ALISON (16) and MATT (16), KISSING. 
  As hot gives way to heavy, she pulls back.  A good girl.  

                                    ALISON
                  What if someone sees us? 

                                  MATT
                  Please.  This place is a ghost town.   

  It's pitch dark.  Streetlights out.  She can't argue, yet --

                                    ALISON
                  What about God?  He sees everything. 

                                  MATT
                  Well.  If he has a problem, he'll
                let us know.  He's God, right? 

  As they get back to it, they hear SPRINKLERS going off...

  The SPRINKERS SWEEP BY the open PASSENGER WINDOW.  Alison's
    getting sprayed, but she's into the moment, the romance.

  Matt starts macking on her neck.  Alison's eyes close in
    ecstasy.  What they don't see, WE DO --

  The SPRINKLERS spraying across the WINDSHIELD.  Only this
  water is PINKISH/RED and getting darker.  As Matt gets more
    amorous, moving south --

                                                              (CONTINUED)  CSI: "Tell-Tale Hearts" - 1202 - WHITE - 8/1/112.

3CONTINUED:3

  His KNEE bumps the WINDSHIELD WIPER LEVER, the WIPERS starts
    SWEEPING ACROSS the WINDSHIELD.  Streaking it with BLOOD. 
    Alison opens her eyes.  But before she can react --

  The SWEEPING SPRINKLERS pass the OPEN WINDOW again, SPRAYING
  BLOOD onto her WHITE T-SHIRT.  Her face.  The BLOOD getting
    THICKER and REDDER.  As she SCREAMS, God weighing in, we --

                                                                    WHITE FLASH TO:


4EXT. CHAMBLISS HOME - NIGHT (LATER)4

  Crime scene.  Sprinklers off, but WATERY BLOOD is puddled
    everywhere.  CATHERINE swabs poor Alison, still freaked.  

                                    ALISON
                Is it really? --

                                    CATHERINE
                  Blood? -- 

    Catherine PHENOS the swab.  It turns PINK.  

                                    CATHERINE
                -- Yeah.

    Alison glares daggers at Matt, with a UNI, as CAMERA FINDS --*

    RUSSELL.  Taking it all in.  The YARD.  The TWO CAR GARAGE.    
  The HOUSE.  Catherine approaches Russell --

                                    CATHERINE
                  Talked to Kid Casanova, says God's
                  wrath rained down.  And I think
                  'Carrie' over there's convent bound. 

                                    RUSSELL
                  Lose the blood, the crime scene
                  tape... my wife could go for a
                  community like this.  Eco-friendly.

                                    CATHERINE
                Not so friendly tonight.

    Catherine is eyeing BRASS exiting the house with UNIS.  Their
  faces say all the blood is coming from inside.

                                  BRASS
                  Chambliss family.  Quadruple.  You're
                  going to want to call for backup.
                          (tweaking Russell)
                You get many 'Stigmata' houses in
                  Seattle?  


                                                              (CONTINUED)  CSI: "Tell-Tale Hearts" - 1202 - WHITE - 8/1/113.

4CONTINUED:4

                                    RUSSELL
                No.  Saints there bleed coffee. 

  Cop and hippie definitely don't mix. 

                                  BRASS
                        (re: his notepad)
                  Owner was a pharmaceutical salesman. 
                  Laid off six months ago --

                                    RUSSELL
                        (has his own process)
                -- I got it.

  He moves past Brass -- wants the scene to brief him.  Like
    Michael Jordan stepping onto the court, he's in the zone.

                                  BRASS
                        (to Catherine)
                  Hope Moonbeam brought his booties.
                And a strong stomach.


5INT. CHAMBLISS HOME - FOYER - NIGHT (LATER)5

    Lights off.  Russell and Catherine ease into the house, their
    FLASHLIGHTS cutting the darkness.  BG, we HEAR a TV.  The
  first six feet pristine.  Then the horror show begins. 

  They SEE a WHEELCHAIR on its side.  Blood all over it.  Blood
    pooling on the rug, coming from a WHITE-HAIRED GRANDMOTHER
    (ANITA CHAMBLISS).  House coat, slippers, seventies... she
    didn't stand a chance.  Her THROAT'S SLASHED.  MULTIPLE STAB
    WOUNDS and DEFENSE WOUNDS visible on her arms and hands.  

    Russell and Catherine react.  Holy shit.  And there's more
  to come.  The metallic smell from all the blood in the house
    catches in the back of Russell's throat.  He clears it, as...

  They split off.  Russell eases ahead, carefully picking his
  way around the blood pool.  Rounding a room divider, into --    


6INT. CHAMBLISS HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)6

  Where he now finds the TV on.  It casts an EERIE GLOW
    across...

  The BODY OF CAL CHAMBLISS, thirties, splayed out on a sofa
  where he fell.  TWO GUNSHOTS TO THE CHEST.  ONE TO THE HEAD,
    stellate pattern on his forehead, back of his head gone.  

  Wall behind him is painted with blood and brain matter.  

  As Russell takes this in, overkill --  CSI: "Tell-Tale Hearts" - 1202 - WHITE - 8/1/114.


7INT. CHAMBLISS HOME - MAIN HALLWAY - NIGHT (SAME TIME)7

    Catherine moves down the hall, hugs the wall.  Passes by the
    KITCHEN, sees broken BOWLS and MEASURING CUPS on the floor. 
  And a gruesome commingled mess of spilled FLOUR and BLOOD. 
    SMEARED across the kitchen floor, trailing into the hallway.     

  She follows the trail toward the bedrooms, but it doesn't go
  that far.  It leads into an open doorway on the right.  As
    Catherine gets a good look inside, her face grows pale.


8INT. CHAMBLISS HOME - BATHROOM/HALLWAY - NIGHT8

  Think Psycho -- BLOOD SPATTERED everywhere, but instead of
  Janet Leigh, it's SUSAN CHAMBLISS (36) lying in the shower.  

    Beaten to a pulp.  Stabbed multiple times, the apparent weapon
  left on the floor -- a broken towel bar ripped from the wall,
  its jagged metal edge covered in blood and tissue. 

    Russell now appears behind Catherine.  He sees the blood 
  from the victim covering the shower pan, the last of the
  drops still circling the drain.  He puts it together --

                                    RUSSELL
                  Eco-house.  Gray water system. 
                  Recycles everything that goes down
                the drain...

                                    CATHERINE
                ... and out to the sprinklers. 
                  Explains why the house was bleeding.

  Now Russell sees a single RAINBOW MINI-MARSHMALLOW, by his
  foot, at the edge of the baseboard.  His expression shifts -- 

                                    RUSSELL
                  When's the last time you bought
                  rainbow marshmallows?

                                    CATHERINE
                  When my daughter was eight.

  They both know what this means.  They move down the hall,
    maglites finding BLOODY BOOT PRINTS.  They follow the trail...

  ANGLE ON - RUSSELL AND CATHERINE

    A long walk for a CSI.  Longer for a father.  And a mother.
  The door at the end of the hall is ajar.  They pause in front
  of it.  A beat.   

                                    RUSSELL
                          (focused)
                  Feel that?  


                                                              (CONTINUED)  CSI: "Tell-Tale Hearts" - 1202 - WHITE - 8/1/115.*

8CONTINUED:8

                                    CATHERINE
                ... Change in temperature.

    Russell puts his hand up to the crack of the door.  Feels a
  RUSH OF COLD AIR.  He pushes open the door, revealing...


9INT. CHAMBLISS HOME - FIONA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)9

  ... a LARGE BROKEN WINDOW.  Peppered glass on the floor beneath
  it.  And the basin of a BIRD BATH apparently thrown through.     

    Russell and Catherine swivel looks to... the bed... And FIONA
    CHAMBLISS (8), PINK NIGHTGOWN, holding a TEDDY BEAR, peaceful. 
    Except for a SINGLE GUNSHOT to the side of the head. 
    Catherine studies Fiona's body, as Russell searches the room --

                                    CATHERINE
                No blood on the nightgown... been
                  redressed.  Cleaned up.  Tucked in.

                                    RUSSELL
                ... By somebody who cared about her. 

  Near the broken window, Russell's light falls on a DOLLHOUSE,
  BLOOD DROPS on the roof.  Bullet in the wall above. *

                                    RUSSELL
                She was shot here.   

  His maglite travels from the BULLET up the wall -- MORE BLOOD. *
  Then, catches BLOOD ON A GLASS FRAGMENT still imbedded in
  the broken window's FRAME.  Momentarily confused --

                                    RUSSELL
                How did the blood get way up here?

  Then it hits him, as the CAMERA ROCKETS OUT THE BROKEN WINDOW --


10EXT. CHAMBLISS HOME - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)10

  -- AND DIVES into the grass, FINDING one BLOOD DROPLET, then
    ANOTHER, and ANOTHER.  WE CAREEN through the grass, leap-
    frogging from drop to drop, as the CSIs' lights find them. 

  WHIP PAN UP FROM THE GRASS TO FIND Russell, Catherine, Brass
  and UNIs charging AT CAMERA, away from the Chambliss house.


11EXT. FOREST GREEN SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY - NIGHT11

    CAMERA TRACKS FAST WITH Russell, Catherine, Brass and UNIs
  as they find drops, on the grass, in the dirt.  On the street. *
  One, then another, arriving at the end of the blood trail...*  CSI: "Tell-Tale Hearts" - 1202 - WHITE - 8/1/116.


12EXT. JOHN LEE'S HOME - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT12

  Front door ajar.  BLOOD SMEAR on the DOOR FRAME.  Russell
  and Catherine arrive a step before Brass and the UNIs.

                                  BRASS
                I got this.  Don't move 'til you
                get a Code Four.

  Brass draws his gun, enters with UNIs, as...

    Russell and Catherine wait outside.  Tense moments as they
  hear from inside the house: "Clear!  Clear!  Clear!"  Then...

    VOICES OF BRASS AND THE UNIs SHOUTING: "Show me your hands!
    I said, show me your hands!"  Russell eyes Catherine --

                                    RUSSELL
                  Sounds like a Code Four to me.

  He pushes inside, and Catherine follows.


13INT. JOHN LEE'S HOME - LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - NIGHT13*

    MOVING WITH HANDHELD JERKY POV down the Living Room and*
    hallway, ARRIVING AT... THE BEDROOM AT THE END OF THE HALL.    *

  WHIP TO FIND Russell -- Catherine a few steps behind -- as
  they enter...


14INT. JOHN LEE'S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT 14

  ... Barely in time to see JOHN LEE, late 20s, on the bed,
    shirtless, no shoes.  And clutching a LITTLE GIRL'S BLOODY
    NIGHTGOWN.  In a flash, Brass and the UNIs are on him --

      Adrenaline-pumping, they yank John Lee off the bed and throw
  him to the floor.  Knees in his back.  Smashing his face
  into the carpet.  If they could kill him, they would. John
  Lee whimpers, mumbling like a mental patient --

                                  JOHN LEE
                  I loved her... I loved her... I
                  loved...

  As they cuff John Lee... Brass looks at Russell and Catherine. 
  Case closed.  

                                                                            SMASH TO:

  FADE IN:


15EXT. ECO-FRIENDLY COMMUNITY - DAY15

  Off the grid.  Housing boom gone bust.  Roads not even
    finished.  A FENDER and TIRE ENTER FRAME, jerk to a stop -- 

                                  GPS VOICE (V.O.)
                ... You are going the wrong way.

16INT. MORGAN'S CSI DENALI - DAY16

    MORGAN BRODY lost, late and losing it.  

                                    MORGAN
                  Intersection?  There's no road.  

  She pounds the dashboard.  GPS DISPLAYS a network of roads
  where there are none, and repeats --

                                  GPS VOICE (V.O.)

                  turn at the next intersection.

    Morgan stares ahead.  Sees across several blocks of wasteland,
    BUBBLE LIGHTS and CRIME TAPE -- her destination.  Beat, then --

  She mashes the peddle to the floor, and --


17EXT. MORGAN'S DENALI - DAY (CONTINUOUS)17

  The Denali screams forward... jumping the curb... four
    wheeling it in a cloud of dust.  Across dirt, rocks, sagebrush -- 

                                  GPS VOICE (V.O.)
                You are going the wrong way.  You
                are going the wrong way.


18EXT. CHAMBLISS HOME - DAY (SAME TIME)18

  NICK unloads his gear from the back of his Denali.  In the
    distance, he squints at a curious DUST DEVIL approaching
  fast.  What is it?

  From the dust emerges MORGAN'S DENALI, careening off the
  dirt, launching over the curb and slamming onto the paved
    street... screeching to a stop a little too close to Nick.  

    A smiling Morgan hops out and approaches, as we HEAR --

  Nick smirks and heads inside, nodding a "hello sir" over to - *

    ECKLIE passing by Nick, approaching.  In a coat and tie.  He
  walks up, as Morgan loads extra EVIDENCE TENTS into her kit. 
    Ecklie takes a cursory look at the contents of her kit, notes --

                  Cigars?  I always had a few on hand.

                  So... settling in?

                                    MORGAN
                  I got stuff to do.

  Just then, a REPORTER standing at the tape, shouts --

                    Undersheriff Ecklie.  Is it true
                you have a suspect in custody? 

  As Ecklie looks at Morgan, they both have stuff to do --  CSI: "Tell-Tale Hearts" - 1202 - WHITE - 8/1/119.


19INT. P.D. - HALLWAY - DAY 19

  John Lee -- no shirt, no shoes -- is perp-walked down the*
  hall by Brass, OFFICER MITCHELL and a SECOND UNI.  [NOTE:*
  The cut on his arm has been dressed].  All eyes on him. *
  He's a pedophile, a family killer.  Every cop wants a piece
  of him.  Lee is petrified.  Exactly what Brass wanted.*

                                  BRASS
                  Having a good time? --

                  Last good time you're going to have. 

    Officer Mitchell leads Lee into the INTERROGATION ROOM --


20INT. JOHN LEE'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY20

  SARA now on scene, working up a sweat, searching for the gun
  and the knife.  Tearing stuff apart.  Flipping over cushions. 
    Hutches.  Cabinets.  Drawers.  [NOTE: All this furniture*
    should look like it belongs to old people.]  

  She stops for a beat, frustrated.  Nothing.  She exits.


21INT. JOHN LEE'S HOME - BEDROOM - DAY21

  Sara enters, her look goes from frustrated to annoyed.  REVEAL
  WHAT SHE SEES -- Russell deep in thought, and not sweating
  at all.  Not searching.  The dresser drawers are open
    revealing lots of boy toys: YO-YO'S, STUFFED RABBIT, JOLLY
    RANCHERS, CARTOON LUNCH BOX, PIGGY BANK, PINWHEEL, MR. BUBBLE.  

                                  SARA
                  Don't mean to interrupt your search. 
                  I've torn this whole house apart. 
                No gun, no knife, no nothing.

                                    RUSSELL
                        (deep in thought)
                Did you notice the decor?  

                                  SARA
                You in the market for a decorator?

                  Suspect's twenty-seven, answers phones
                at a body shop...  Furniture in this
                  place looks like it belongs to his
                  parents.  Hand me downs.  Only room
                  that's a reflection of his taste is
                  this one.  It's laid out exactly
                  like the dead girl's room.  Even got
                the same dollhouse.

  Sara appreciates Russell's focus.  And the insight.  *

                Not exactly the same.  Little girl's*

  Sara takes a knee, unclasps the hinges and opens the dollhouse*
  roof and front facade.  They open like a flower, revealing*
  on the flat interior surfaces --*

    A PHOTO TABLEAU OF FIONA   

    Dozens of PHOTOS OF FIONA.  Starting at age four.  All from
    a peeper's perspective.  SHOTS of her playing outside. 
    Playing at parks.  Riding her bike.  Going to school.  And
  even more SHOTS THROUGH THE WINDOW of her sleeping. 

    Russell and Sara stare at the tableau --

                                  SARA
                Guy lived three doors down.

                  He's been watching her for years.  

  Sara slides a look to Russell.  His focus has acquired a
    darker intensity.

24EXT. CHAMBLISS HOME - OUTSIDE BROKEN WINDOW - DAY 24

    FLASH!  FLASH!  Morgan documents the BASE OF THE BIRD BATH. 
  On its side, basin missing -- we know where it ended up.  As
    Morgan visualizes the bird bath's original position --


25CSI SHOT - BASE OF THE BIRD BATH 25

  It RISES OFF the ground, the BASIN GHOSTS back in.  Morgan
  steps toward the GHOST BIRD BATH. Takes a beat to analyze,
  then crouches down behind it, looking PAST it, TO --

    Fiona's bed.  Perfectly framed in the BROKEN WINDOW. 

    Morgan looks down. In the dirt, just behind the GHOST BIRD
  BATH, she sees OVERLAPPING BOOT PRINTS. 

  She puts her cheek to the dirt, blows on the prints.  Very
    little dirt blows away.  Means the boot prints are BAKED IN.  CSI: "Tell-Tale Hearts" - 1202 - WHITE - 8/1/1111.


26BACK TO SCENE 26

    Morgan calls to GREG, on the other side of the broken glass,
  just clicking off his cell.

                                    MORGAN
                  Hey, Sanders.  Got multiple boot
                  prints.  

  She watches through the window as... Greg cuts out a section
  of carpet just inside the room.  A bloody boot print.*

                                  GREG
                Me, too.  In the hall.  In blood.

                                    MORGAN
                  Mine have been here awhile.  I think
                  someone was hiding back here.

                                  GREG
                  Looking in.  That was Sara on the
                  phone.  Perp's a peeper.  

    CAMERA FOLLOWS Morgan's look THROUGH THE GLASS, and into --


27INT. CHAMBLISS HOME - FIONA'S BEDROOM - DAY27

  Greg resumes ALS-ing the bedding.  There's nothing, until
  the beam spills over the edge of the mattress onto the carpet. 
    Bingo.  A PALE GREEN/YELLOW GLOWING STAIN appears.  Greg
    follows it with the ALS, angling it under the bed to find -- 

    A LARGER, GLOWING STAIN.  He takes a scientific sniff.  Urine.  

                                                                    WHITE FLASH TO:

29INT. P.D. - INTERROGATION ROOM "A" - DAY (LATER)29

  John Lee sits.  Nervous.  Brass stands behind him.  Silent.
    Letting him stew.  Finally --

                                  BRASS
                Can I get you anything?  Soda? 
                  Water?  Milk?

                                  JOHN LEE
                  A Cherry Cola would be nice.

                I'm sure it would.  

                                  JOHN LEE 
                  I know what you think.

  Brass leans in with lethal venom.  Whispers in his ear --

                                  BRASS
                  I think you're lucky I'm a cop. 

  Just then, Catherine KNOCKS and enters.  She's got her kit,
    several EVIDENCE BAGS and JUMPS. 

                                    CATHERINE
                CSI Willows.  Here to process you.

  Lee doesn't know what this means, but his sphincter tightens. 
    Catherine lays a piece of butcher paper down on the floor.

                                    CATHERINE
                Get up.  Step on the paper.  Strip.

  John Lee doesn't comply.  Scared and embarrassed.

                                    CATHERINE
                  Either you do it for me, or you do
                it for him.

    Self-conscious, John Lee looks to Brass, who shrugs. 

                                  BRASS
                  Just pretend she's six years old.

  John Lee slowly rises and stands barefoot on the paper. 

                                    CATHERINE
                  Pants first.

                                  JOHN LEE
                  Could you close the blinds? 

  Brass crosses to the blinds.  He opens them all the way. 
  Then, he cranks the thermostat all the way down.

                                  BRASS
                  Better? 

  John Lee strips off his pants.  Catherine bags them.

                                    CATHERINE
                  Keep going.

    Catherine eyes Brass.  A warning.  Let's not lose this
    confession.  As the CAMERA ANGLES to John Lee's face, we
  HEAR him drop his underwear into an evidence bag --

  We see SPATTER on the tile (L-SCALE in the shot).  FLASH! 
  BLOOD DRYING AROUND THE DRAIN.  FLASH! The ripped-out end of
  the TOWEL BAR.  JAGGED.  BLOODY, with BITS OF TISSUE on it.   

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                Any reason you're holding onto Mom?

                  Cadets are out beating the bushes

    PIZZAS. But they're all packaged for kids.  

                                    RUSSELL
                One anniversary, my wife and I went
                  away for a weekend.  Left our oldest
                in charge.  Kids did the shopping. 
                  Looked just like this. 

                                  SARA
                  Popsicles.  Ice cream.  Great way
                to lure a kid.  

                                    RUSSELL
                Not a lure.  A lifestyle.  Arrested
                    development. 

  He directs her attention to the counter.  Box of INSTANT
    COCOA.  BAG OF MINI-RAINBOW MARSHMALLOWS.  LUCKY CHARMS.

                  Maybe he likes little girls because
                  he's a little boy. 

                                    RUSSELL
                  Immature.  Isolated.  Hides and
                  takes pictures through a window. *
                  Passive, not aggressive. *

  Sara eyes Russell, still trying to get a bead on him. 

                                  SARA
                  Thought you liked to play dead? 
                Get into the head of the victim?

                                    RUSSELL
                My wife says I'm a frustrated writer. 
                  When I see a crime scene, I see a
                  story.  Victim, suspect.  Whoever
                has the best tale to tell, that's
                  where I find the truth.  And this*
                  story isn't telling. *

                                  SARA*
                          (eyeing him)*
                You think the man child didn't do it?*
                        (then, citing the facts)
                He was in their house.  He was
                  holding her bloody nightgown.  He'd
                  watched that girl for years.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Exactly.  For years.  And then one
                  night he stopped watching and started
                  killing.  Why?


34INT. P.D. - INTERROGATION ROOM "A" - DAY34

  John Lee still naked and shivering.  He stares at the
    chemicals lined up in front of Catherine.  Brass watching.  

                                    CATHERINE
                  Right hand.

                                  JOHN LEE
                Is this going to hurt?

                                    CATHERINE
                  A lot less than jabbing a towel bar
                  into a woman twenty times.

                                  JOHN LEE
                  I didn't do it.  Any of it.

  She glares at him.  He timidly extends his shaking hand.  As
    Catherine swabs the inside of his right palm --

                                  JOHN LEE
                  I went by the house.  I looked in
                and I saw her.  I saw the hole in
                her head.  The blood.  I loved her. 
                  I couldn't leave her like that.

                                  BRASS
                So instead of calling the police,
                you threw a bird bath through the
                  window?

    Catherine adds a drop of SODIUM RHODIZONATE to the swab. No
    reaction.

                                    CATHERINE
                  Other hand.

  John Lee now extends his shaking left hand.  Catherine swabs
  his left palm --

                                  BRASS
                  I ran you.  No record, no complaints. 
                But here's what I think happened. 
                One night you're hanging outside
                  that window.  Someone sees you,
                  tells the Chamblisses.  So they
                  take a walk.  Dad knocks on your
                  door, then he knocks on your head. 
                And you didn't like that. 

    Catherine adds a drop to the swab, but this time it turns
    VIOLET.  Positive.  John Lee eyes the result, gets edgier.

                                    CATHERINE
                  I just tested your hands for lead
                to determine if you fired a gun. 

                                  BRASS
                  Guess what color positive is?


35CSI SHOT - LEAD TRANSFER FROM GUN TO HAND35

  John Lee's left hand grasping a gun. As he pulls away, we
  ZOOM in.  Seeing the microscopic SPHERES of LEAD, BARIUM,
  and ANTIMONY remain on his hand.  Transfer.  


36BACK TO SCENE 36

                                    CATHERINE
                You shot that little girl.  Shot
                her father.

                  Sliced and diced her grandmother. 
                And beat and stabbed her mother
                  with a towel bar.  

                                  BRASS
                  We're going to prove that, too. 
                  Tests are just starting, pal.

  John Lee shakes even more.  Not from the cold, but from fear.

                                  BRASS
                You got a choice.  Spend the rest
                of your life in general pop with
                  some very bad guys who've got kids
                  they love and can't see, and are
                  going to take that all out on you... 
                Or you can tell us what you did and
                buy yourself a private cell.

  John Lee, shaking almost uncontrollably now.  Looks up --

                                  JOHN LEE
                  I did it.  I'm the one who killed
                the Chambliss family.


37EXT. CHAMBLISS HOME - DAY37

    Morgan has moved to the front house and is TENTING some of*
  the BLOOD TRAIL.  Within earshot, Ecklie.  On his cell.*

                  CSI's not through processing the
                  scene.  I think we should hold off
                on the press conference, ma'am.  
                          (listening)
                  Supervisor Russell has some concerns
                  about the suspect --
                          (listening, then)
                    I understand the pressure.  I just
                  don't want to have another press
                  conference with egg on my face... 
                  Yes, ma'am.  I know it's my face.

    Morgan watches as her father CLICKS off.  Being a suit sucks.
  She feels bad for him as Undersheriff, if not as father.

    FOLLOW ECKLIE as he heads for the MEDIA FRENZY.  Vans and
    mobile set-ups. CAMERAS FLASH.  Ecklie ducks under the tape
  and approaches the REPORTERS and CAMERAS.

                  custody.  Who has confessed to the
                  murders of the Chambliss family.

                  take a message.

    Catherine is just passing by, overhears.

    Leslie Gitig's face FILLS THE SCREEN, freshening her lipstick. 
    Preening in the mirror, like she's getting ready for a date. 
  But this is no mirror.  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS --

    Ecklie, nose-to-nose with Leslie, observes.  On his phone. 

                                    ECKLIE
                No, ma'am.  No record.  Works as a
                  Legal Secretary.  Lives in Henderson. 
                  I imagine she saw the news.  
                          (eyeing her preening)
                  Seems like the type to... crave

                  Yes, ma'am, I know Captain Brass
                can be aggressive, but smart money's
                  still on the perv. 

    Ecklie sees Brass enter to talk with Leslie.  He realizes he*
    should be in there with him.  He finishes the call.  Quickly.  *

                                    ECKLIE
                Of course.  I understand.  I'm on
                it.  Personally.  Yes, ma'am. 

  He gets up, and wants to throw the fucking phone.  He looks
  to Leslie.  Crazy lady.  Screwing things up.  Then --

                for gas.  

                                  BRASS
                So, last night you actually got out

                                    LESLIE GITIG
                  I rang the doorbell.  Cal's mother,
                  Anita , answered.  
                        (then)
                  I told her I was there to see Cal. 
                She wouldn't let me in, so I killed
                  her.  Then, I killed Cal.  And Susan.
                And Fiona.

                You mean like, Anita's throat was

  QUICK SHOTS of Leslie killing them all.  Anita Chambliss'
    throat slashed by Leslie, with a KNIFE.    CSI: "Tell-Tale Hearts" - 1202 - WHITE - 8/1/1122.


A44INT. CHAMBLISS HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (VERSION)A44*

    Leslie pulls a GUN, and shoots CAL.  ONCE.  TWICE.  Then,
  walks right up to him and shoots him in the head.  

                                    LESLIE GITIG (V.O.)
                ... Cal was shot twice in the chest,
                  once between the eyes.  


B44INT. CHAMBLISS HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT (VERSION)B44*

    Leslie attacks Susan with the KNIFE.  Knocking over all the*
  BOWLS and cups.  Dragging her across the floor. *

                ... And little Fiona --

                                    LESLIE GITIG
                -- was shot in the head.

  How's that for specific?  Ecklie takes a beat.  She's right
  about all that, but one thing doesn't fit -- our working*
    theory is the point of entry was the broken window. *

                                    ECKLIE
                You said you entered the house

                                    LESLIE GITIG
                If you want to videotape this, I
                can start again from the beginning.

  Or maybe Ecklie was right -- she's just craving attention.


45INT. CORONER'S OFFICE - AUTOPSY ROOM "A" - DAY45*

  All FOUR BODIES on tables, POST-Y.  Catherine staring at

                  I heard about the second confession.

                                  DR. ROBBINS

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  Massive head trauma.  Exsanguination. 
                  Twenty-four sharp force injuries
                  consistent with the jagged ends of
                the towel bar.  Fifteen accompanying
                  blunt force injuries, consistent
                  with its rounded sides.  

                                    CATHERINE
                  Beaten and stabbed to death.  Thirty-
                  nine blows.  Towel bar ripped out
                of the wall.  Rage.  

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                  Dad's a different story.  

  Dr. Robbins crosses to Cal Chambliss' body, POST-Y.  

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                Two gunshot wounds to the chest. 
                And a Coup de Grace.  

  He holds up a BINDLE with THREE BLUE FIBERS inside.

                  David found blue fibers on the Dad's

                  Contact wound.  Right through the
                  frontal bone.  Execution style.  

                                    CATHERINE
                  Clean.  Quick.

  Now, he hands her two coin envelopes.*

                  Sexual assault?  Not sure I even
                  want to hear this.

                                  DR. ROBBINS
                Not sure you do either. 
                        (off her look)
                  There was nothing.  No physical
                  findings of any sexual abuse. 

    Catherine didn't see this coming.

                He escalates to murder, but leaves
                the object of his perversion
                  untouched?  Then... kills her?  

                                  DR. ROBBINS

    Morgan PRINTS the front door (closed).  Russell approaches.

    Russell heads inside.  Morgan cranes a look.  Huh?


47INT. CHAMBLISS HOME - MAIN HALLWAY - DAY47

    Russell walks down the hall, sidestepping evidence tents.

                  Family meeting.  Everybody.  Follow
                me.  

  He passes Nick, who pokes his head out of the bathroom, sees
    Russell headed for Fiona's room.  Eyes Morgan as she passes.

48INT. CHAMBLISS HOME - FIONA'S BEDROOM - DAY48

    Greg's been printing, his face streaked with powder.  FOUR
    EVIDENCE GROCERY BAGS on the floor.  FINGERPRINT POWDER all
  over the walls and window.  Shattered glass now collected. 
  Bed linens stripped.  Russell, Nick and Morgan crowd in.  

                                    RUSSELL
                        (to Greg)
                  Looks good.  

  He turns to address his team.  Greg sidesteps into the group,
  like he's getting into a family photo.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Here's how I like to run a family
                  meeting.  First, clarify the problem. *
                In this case, two competing stories. *
                Who thinks the target of this attack*
                was the little girl?  Hands. 

    Nobody raises their hands.  Says a word.  Too weirded out.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Just like my kids.  Point of entry? 
                The window?

    Morgan raises her hand.  Then, Greg's hand goes up slowly.  
  Nick is having none of it.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Smash!
                        (they all startle)
                  Greg.  What does the little girl do?

                                  GREG
                  Found a puddle of urine under the
                  bed.  She hid there.

                                    RUSSELL
                You processed Dad, Nick.  Think he
                  heard any of this?

                                  NICK
                  Evidence says no.  He barely got
                off the sofa before he got shot.
                  TV's on.  Maybe he was asleep.
                  Grandma had a hearing aid, she didn't

                  Still, if someone broke into my
                  daughter's room, she'd scream bloody
                  hell.  And not hide, but run to me.

                                    MORGAN
                  Little girl's behavior is off.  

                                    RUSSELL
                  Everyone's behavior's off.  Catherine
                  says John Lee never touched the girl. 
                So, I'm glad none of you raised your
                  hands when I asked if she was the
                  focus of this whole thing.

                                  GREG
                I'd like to retract my hand on point
                of entry.  Girl's behavior is more
                  consistent with point of entry at
                the front door.  She ran and hid.

                                    MORGAN
                  There's no forced entry at the front
                  door.  If Dad's on the sofa, and
                  Mom's in the kitchen, Grandma let
                  them in.  

                                  NICK
                          (getting on board)
                  Grandma first.  Dad second.  Mom
                  next.  Hit on the head, dragged
                  into the bathroom.  

                                    RUSSELL
                  Girl was last.  

                                    MORGAN
                So why did John Lee not touch her?

                                  GREG
                Why did he kill her?

                                    RUSSELL
                  Maybe he didn't. Maybe he's telling
                the truth.  He came after the
                  killings.  Broke in, threw the bird
                  bath through the window.  He said 
                he couldn't leave Fiona like that.

                                    MORGAN 
                  Would explain why we haven't found

  Greg INKS the soles, making a TRANSPARENT REFERENCE SHEET. 
    Meanwhile, Morgan is overlaying one of the transparencies on

                Got him at the window.

  She moves to the CARPET CUT-OUTS.  Overlays the TRANSPARENCY
  on a BLOODY BOOT PRINT.  Reacts to the obvious discrepancy.

                                    MORGAN
                Not in the house.  He gained two

  she empties one of the AUTOPSY BULLETS from its envelope
    marked: CAL CHAMBLISS #1, and places it into the other stage.

  -- As she looks into the scope, we see on the attached MONITOR*
  that the AUTOPSY BULLET does NOT MATCH the TEST FIRE BULLET.*

55INT. P.D. - INTERROGATION ROOM "A" - NIGHT55

    Leslie is just looking at the camera, waiting for the "red
    light" to come on.  Russell enters, with a report.

                  Where are the other gentlemen? 

    Russell just stares at the report, giving her nothing.

                                    LESLIE GITIG
                If you're going to ask me the
                  questions now --
                          (pointing)
                -- That red light isn't on.

    Russell sits down, ignoring her.  Then --

                                    RUSSELL
                You know what a ballistics match is?

                                    LESLIE GITIG
                  Yes.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Well, that gun you had us fish out
                at the Country Club wasn't the murder
                  weapon.  Same caliber.  But the
                  rifling wasn't even close.  

                                    LESLIE GITIG
                As I understand it, any number of
                  things can change a gun's rifling
                    characteristics.

    Russell studies her.

                                    LESLIE GITIG
                Are you going back to the lake? 
                  Obviously, you found the wrong gun.  

                                    RUSSELL
                          (staring through her)
                I'm sure you're an excellent legal
                  secretary.  You know criminal
                  procedure, the lingo.  I bet you
                  have contacts at PD, the Coroner's
                  Office, even the Crime Lab.

  She gets his drift.  Goes from being zero-affect to icy.

                                    LESLIE GITIG
                  I killed that family.  Because that
                  bitch got in the way of me and Cal. 
                  Just like she did when I sunk that
                  knife into her twenty-four times.

    Russell eyes her, bothered.  He knows it wasn't a knife. 
  But she's right about a lot of things.  And definitely off.

    Russell exits Interrogation, Catherine and Brass waiting.

    Catherine pulls phone records from a file --

                                    CATHERINE
                  I ran her phone logs.  She's been
                  making calls to law enforcement all
                  over the county.  

                                  BRASS
                  Loose lips sink cases.   

    Russell is processing all of this.  Quiet on the surface,
  but something is still bothering him.  Stuck in his teeth.

                You seem a little off your Zen,

                  Woman gets a look at our evidence. 
                She may be crazy, but she figured
                out point-of-entry before we did.

                                    CATHERINE
                  Maybe we should keep that to ourselves.

  John Lee, in jumps, sits across from Russell and Catherine.  
    Looking at her.  What's she going to do to him now? 

                                    RUSSELL
                We know you were in the house that
                  night, John.  In Fiona's room.  You
                  said she was already dead, let's
                say we believe you.  You were still
                  there.

                                    CATHERINE
                Did you see anything?

                                  JOHN LEE
                No.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Okay.  Maybe not the night of the
                  murders.  But you've been watching
                  that family for years.     

                                  JOHN LEE
                You trying to trick me?  

                                    CATHERINE
                You loved Fiona.  Something bad
                  happened to her.  She'd want you to
                  help us.

  Beat.  They're getting through to him.  Catherine slides a
  DMV PHOTO of Leslie Gitig across the table. 

                                    CATHERINE
                  Have you ever seen this woman?

                  down the street and just sit there. *
                  She's an awful woman.

                                    CATHERINE
                How do you know?

  John Lee reacts, edgy.

                                  JOHN LEE
                You can just tell sometimes.

    Russell measures John Lee, senses more there.

  He shakes his head, no.  As Russell measures him, Catherine

                You ever see any other 'awful people'
                go inside? 

  John Lee really starts to sweat now.  Getting nervous.

                                  JOHN LEE
                Can I have that cherry cola now?

  OFF Russell and Catherine, they're getting close.  But it
  may take some time.


60INT. CSI - EVIDENCE LOCKER - NIGHT60

  Sara and Morgan log in their piles of evidence.  Sara, doing
    paperwork, staples receipts to each bag.  Morgan seals her

                                  SARA
                  Explain this to me.  Some perv stalks
                  your daughter, peeks in her window, 
                  takes photos.  For years.  Mother
                  doesn't work, father's laid off...
                  I mean, they were around.  

                                    MORGAN
                  Can't tell me they didn't know.  I
                  found dozens of footprints outside*

                                  SARA
                So why didn't they call the police?

    A beat, as they consider this.  Then, an idea forming --

                                    MORGAN
                  Maybe they couldn't.

                  Where's it coming from?

  Under this, Greg enters.  He's carrying a box filled with
    evidence.  As Morgan continues --

                                    MORGAN
                In L.A., at least seventy percent
                of all murders involve drugs.

                                  GREG
                  Might explain what I recovered from
                the kitchen.  Finally got a chance*
                to process everything.  I don't*
                  think Mom was just baking cakes. *

  Greg digs in his evidence box, pulls out a KITCHEN SCALE and
    a COSTCO-SIZED SLEEVE OF BAKING SODA BOXES.

                                  SARA
                  That is a lot of baking soda --

  Greg drops the baking soda boxes onto the scale.  It records*
  the weight, down to the hundredth gram.

                And one seriously accurate kitchen*

                                    MORGAN
                  Either mom was seriously OCD, or*
                she was cutting powder.  Cocaine. *
                  Maybe Meth.*

                We didn't find any drugs in that

                  That's because we weren't looking.

A63INT. CHAMBLISS HOUSE - FOYER/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (MONTAGE)A63

  -- Sara pries MIRROR TILES off a wall in the Foyer, looking
  for a hiding place.  Nothing.

  -- Morgan sees a LOOSE CARPET EDGE in the Living Room.   
  She pulls it back, looking for a floor safe or false floor. 
    Nothing.

  -- Greg pops the covers off the RECESSED CEILING LIGHTS,
    searching the void.  Nothing.  END MONTAGE, as...  


63INT. CHAMBLISS HOME - FIONA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT63

  Greg and Morgan, exhausted, walk into Fiona's room.  Sara is
    standing there, taking in the Children's Cartoon poster,*
  which hangs well above eye level.

                                  SARA
                  Poster look right to you?

  Sara crosses to the poster, pulls it down.  Behind it, she
  finds an ELECTRICAL PANEL.

                                  GREG
                  Electrical panel's in the garage.

  Sara pulls a screwdriver from her vest, pries at the edge of
  the PANEL.  It comes away from the wall (a fake), leaving --

  THEIR POV:  A hole in the wall.  A hiding place.  FILLED
  with BAGS OF COCAINE, and STACKS of CASH.

  ANGLE OFF a PILE OF COCAINE, to PILES OF CASH.  Sara spraying
    NINHYDRIN on the money.  

  Next to her, Morgan pulls the empty PLASTIC BAGS out of the
  SUPER GLUE TANK.  Sets the first bag down, dusts it.  A PRINT
    appears.  She grabs a LOUPE, takes a closer look.

  The CAMERA PUSHES IN and MAGNIFIES the RIDGE DETAIL --*

    Morgan takes a photo of it.  FLASH! *

                You saw something happen in that
                  house, didn't you?  Saw someone
                  arguing with Fiona's dad?  Who?

  John Lee hesitates again, afraid, as...  Russell's CELL
    VIBRATES.  He checks it, shows Catherine, then holds the
    display out to John Lee.  The same MUG SHOT of LONNY GALLOWS. 

                                    RUSSELL

67EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CEO HOUSE - DAY67

  Nick, with a UNI, spots LONNY GALLOWS with a another Worker
    loading SHEETS OF INSTALLATION onto a GALLOWS CONSTRUCTION
    TRUCK.  As Lonny turns to pick up a stack, he spots our guys --

  Lonny takes off.  RUNNING like the wind.  He gets to his*
  truck and flings the door open, just as --*

    Officer Mitchell grabs him, and tosses him like a rag-doll*
  onto the hood.  Securing him with most perfect form. *

  Nick circles around to check out the construction truck. *
  He'll notice a DAMAGED RIGHT SIDE.  Red paint in the scrapes.  *

                                  LONNY GALLOWS
                Yo.  I didn't do nothing! 

    Mitchell pats Lonny's pockets, finds several BAGGIES of*
    COCAINE.  And some CASH.  Intent to distribute. *

                                    OFFICER MITCHELL
                Now this looks bad --

    Nick's looking in the open truck, staring at a pair of BLOOD
    STAINED WORK GLOVES on the seat.

  As Officer Mitchell slaps the cuffs on Lonny --

                                    OFFICER MITCHELL
                  Lonny Gallows. You're under arrest
                for possession of a controlled

                  Really?  I got your file.  

  Brass holds up the file -- it's just a file folder, empty.

                                  BRASS
                Mr. Gallows, you've never done
                  anything wrong in your life.  Family
                  man.  Own a business.  Doing well.
                  You're the only guy in construction
                  I know who's making money.  And you

                  a wheelchair?  A little girl? 

    Maurice doesn't flinch.  Nick notes this.

                                    MAURICE GALLOWS

                  when he committed these crimes.  We

                is the one person who hasn't
                  confessed to the crime. 

  Brass eyes Russell, nose in his file.  Was he even listening? 
  Just when they could use an idea out of left field.

                  I did everything I could to get
                  Lonny clean.  It was finally working. 
                  Then he met Cal.  And I was losing
                him again.

                She swore it was just going to be

                  Cal's expecting me.  It'll only
                  take a minute...

  As Maurice enters behind Leslie now, Leslie pulls a knife,
    pounces on Anita and cuts her throat.  Maurice's look says
  this is not what he expected.  

                                    MAURICE GALLOWS (V.O.)
                -- She lied.

    Leslie looks back at Maurice --

                                    LESLIE GITIG
                  What are you waiting for?

    Maurice, in deep already, moves past Leslie, as Leslie sinks
  the knife into Anita again and again.

86INT. CHAMBLISS HOME - HALLWAY/BATHROOM - NIGHT (VERSION)86

    RESUME MAURICE passing the bathroom where he sees Leslie

  STEPS IN THE BLOOD.  Leaves bloody BOOT-PRINTS. *

    Maurice watches John Lee entering Fiona's bedroom.  Guilt of
    a father on his face, he starts toward the bedroom, tracking
  blood with his boots just into the bedroom.  OFF Maurice,*
    everything spinning out of control. 

                                                                    WHITE FLASH TO:


87BACK TO SCENE 87

    Maurice, that same guilt washing over him.

                                    MAURICE GALLOWS
                You know what it's like to lose
                  your kid to drugs, to wish the world
                for them only to see that world
                  come crashing down. 

                                  BRASS
                  I do, actually.  

    Brass's reaction registers with Russell.

                                  BRASS
                  I do, but it doesn't justify killing
                  a whole family. 

    Maurice is out of words.  No defense for his actions.  


88INT. CSI - RUSSELL'S OFFICE - DAY88

    Russell at his desk, doing paperwork.  He looks up as
    Catherine steps into the doorway.

                                    CATHERINE
                I'm heading out.  Need anything?

                                    RUSSELL
                No, I'm good.  See you tomorrow.

  He looks back down, feels her still there.  Looks up.

                                    CATHERINE
                  Cock Robin?  Really?
                        (off his look)
                  What journal did you get that out
                of?

                                    RUSSELL
                My parents were singers.  It was a
                  favorite around our... van.  Always
                go with what you know.

                                    CATHERINE
                  Worked pretty well.  

                                    RUSSELL
                  It's just about finding your way to
                the right answer.  

                                    CATHERINE
                  That's the job.

  He looks at her, sensing inner turmoil.

                                    RUSSELL
                  That's life.

  His CELL RINGS.  He checks the display.  It keeps RINGING. 

                                    CATHERINE
                You going to get that?

                                    RUSSELL
                  I don't want to be rude.

                                    CATHERINE
                Be rude.

    A shared smile.  He answers his cell --

                                    RUSSELL
                  Hey, doll... 

  ON CATHERINE

  As she turns and walks TOWARD CAMERA, listening as she goes.  

                                    RUSSELL (O.S.)
                ... That's okay.  Don't worry about
                it.  I'll pick up something for us
                on the way home.
                        (then)
                So, how'd Charlie do in practice?

    A hint of sadness in Catherine's eyes, as she catches just a
  hint of a life she doesn't have, but hopes for.  Someday.

                                                                            FADE OUT.
