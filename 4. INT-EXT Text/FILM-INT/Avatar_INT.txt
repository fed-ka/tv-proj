The room is a tiny CUBICLE, prison cell meets 747 bathroom.
Narrow cot, wall-screen droning away in the B.G. --
PERKY NEWSCASTER
The Bengal tiger, extinct for over a
century, is making a comeback. These
cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo
are...

Jake laboriously pulls his pants off -- rocking to one side,
pushing the fabric down past his hip, then rocking to the
other, and so on.
His legs are white and atrophied. Utterly useless. But his
arms are tattooed and powerfully muscled. A "Born Loser"
tattoo prominent on his shoulder.
JAKE (V.O.)
I became a Marine for the hardship. To
be hammered on the anvil of life. I told
myself I could pass any test a man can
pass.
Jake struggles with his pants a long time.
CUT TO:
Not the kind of place you'd bring your mom.
We find Jake near the pool table, BALANCING his chair, front
wheels off the ground, while holding a tequila shot on his
forehead. ONLOOKERS, including some other disabled vets,
CLAP and WHOOP.
Jake grabs the glass, SLAMS down the shot as they cheer.
A WALL-SIZED SCREEN filled with the World Cup game -- men
RUNNING on antelope legs.
CU JAKE, watching what he can't have.
Expression stony.
JAKE (V.O.)
Let's get it straight up front. I don't
want your pity. I know the world's a
cold-ass bitch.
Jake's eyes shift
-- HIS POV, seeing the bar through gaps in
the crowd. A MAN
on a barstool SLAPS the WOMAN he's with.
Hard. She cowers
but he's got her arm, shouting, raising his
fist. An eternal
tableau. People look away.
CU JAKE -- not looking away.
JAKE (V.O.)
You want a fair deal, you're on the wrong
planet. The strong prey on the weak.
TIGHT ON JAKE'S HAND as he starts pushing the wheel of his
chair.
TRACKING WITH HIM as he rolls forward.
3.
JAKE (V.O.)
It's just the way things are.
And nobody
does a damn thing.
Jake stops, unnoticed, next to the bullying man. He leans
down and grabs one leg of the man's barstool -- and YANKS.
The chair flips.
The guy goes down HARD and --
JAKE hurls himself from the wheelchair, toppling on the guy,
getting a grip on him like a pit bull and PUNCHING the crap
out of him, right there on the floor.
THE BOUNCER jumps in, trying to drag him off and it goes into
SLOW MOTION, everybody yelling and pulling...
JAKE (V.O.)
All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life
was a single thing worth fighting for.
CUT TO:
DOWN-ANGLE on a large rectangular cardboard box. HANDS ENTER
FRAME, pulling open the top to reveal a DEAD MAN'S FACE. He
looks EXACTLY like a clean-shaven version of Jake. His
IDENTICAL TWIN -- TOMMY.
JAKE (V.O.)
The strong prey on the weak. A guy with
a knife took all Tommy would ever be, for
the paper in his wallet.
WIDER, showing Jake and the two agents in a high tech
CREMATORIUM -- a row of stainless steel furnaces. Jake
stares down at his own face.
JAKE
Jesus, Tommy.
JAKE (V.O.)
The Suits' concern was touching.
AGENT 1
Your brother represented a significant
investment. We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.
The ATTENDANT closes the box and seals it with a tape
dispenser, like it's a package for shipping. The cardboard
coffin is rolled into the furnace.
JAKE (V.O.)
The egghead and the jarhead.
Tommy was
the scientist, not me. He was the one
who wanted to get shot light years out
into space to find the answers.
5.
PUSHING IN ON JAKE as he watches, bathed in orange light.
JAKE (V.O.)
Me -- I was just another dumb grunt
gettin' sent someplace I was gonna
regret.
INSIDE THE FURNACE the burners quickly eat away the
cardboard; TOMMY'S FACE is, for a moment, wreathed in flame
but not touched by it, as we --
DISSOLVE TO:
JAKE'S FACE, in icy darkness. CLOSE ON his eyes -- they OPEN
suddenly, and he takes a sharp breath.
JAKE'S POV -- the inside of a metal coffin. A SERVO WHINE
and we are moving, emerging into a large chamber --
JAKE'S POV -- A TECH in medical scrubs FLOATS WEIGHTLESSLY
toward us. Wherever we are, we're not on Earth.
Jake squints as the lights flicker on, revealing --
WIDE SHOT -- the multi-tiered CRYO VAULT. Hundreds of CRYO-
CAPSULES are opening like morgue drawers, as med techs pull
themselves about in ZERO-G, tending to their patients.
JAKE
(a hoarse whisper)
Are we there?
MED TECH
We're there, Sunshine.
TIME CUT -- SCORES OF PEOPLE emerge from their cryo-capsules
in ZERO-G. Pale spirits of the dead rising from rows of open
coffins.
The MED TECH floats among them, using his announcement voice.
MED TECH
People, you have been in cryo for five
years, nine months and twenty two days.
You will be hungry, you will be weak. If
you feel nausea, please use the sacks
provided for your convenience. The staff
thanks you in advance.
6.
FOLLOWING JAKE as he pushes away from his capsule, gliding to
the LOCKERS across the aisle, his paralyzed legs not an
impediment in weightlessness.
CUT TO:
The CREW CHIEF stomps down the aisle yelling --
CREW CHIEF
Exopacks on!
Passengers don their EXO-PACK breathing gear with practiced
moves. Everybody except JAKE, who's turning his this way and
that trying to figure out the straps.
CREW CHIEF
Remember people, you lose your mask
you're unconscious in 20 seconds and
you're dead in four minutes. Let's nobody
be dead today, it looks bad on my report.
The crew chief stops by Jake long enough to bark --
CREW CHIEF
Exopack on, let's go!
BENEATH THE SHUTTLE air blasts outward for a hundred meter
radius as it settles onto its landing gear.
INSIDE everybody is queued up in the aisles, with duffles
ready. Rows of tense, expectant faces in breathing masks --
and we DIP DOWN to find Jake, wheelchair putting him at the
level of everyone else's WAISTS.
8.
THE CARGO RAMP OPENS with a hydraulic whine.
CREW CHIEF
Go directly into the base! Do not stop!
Go straight inside!
HAND-HELD, running with the arriving colonists who double
time down the ramp. They jog across the exposed apron toward
a walkway covered in CHAINLINK which leads to the complex.
Inside the chain-link tunnel are a couple of SEC-OPS
TROOPERS, CORPORAL LYLE WAINFLEET and PRIVATE FIKE. Sec-Ops
is the colony's private security force. These guys are laid
back, hardened, and haggard.
WAINFLEET
Look at all that new meat.
THEIR POV -- Jake rolls down the ramp.
FIKE
Check it out, man.
Meals on wheels.
WAINFLEET
That is just wrong.
Jake, pumping his chair, looks around as --
A huge TRACTOR, taller than a house, ROARS past on muddy
wheels. He notices something sticking in the tires --
ARROWS. The neolithic weapons are jarring amid all the
advanced technology.
Beyond the tractor, two VTOL vehicles take off. Armored and
heavily armed, they are AT-99 "SCORPION" GUNSHIPS.
MITSUBISHI MK-6 AMPSUITS -- human operated walking machines 4
meters tall -- patrol the perimeter. They are heavily
armored, and armed with a huge rotary cannon called a GAU-90.
Beyond the outer fence stands a black wall of forest hundreds
of feet high.
A SENTRY GUN OPENS FIRE from a tower. TRACERS
light up the twilight. A shadowy SHAPE SHRIEKS and drops off
the fence. It is an armed camp in a state of siege.
WAINFLEET and Fike give Jake and his chair the hairy eyeball
as he approaches.
JAKE
What're you two limpdicks starin' at?
As Jake rolls past, SOMETHING SWOOPS down behind him and --
9.
K-KRASH! SMASHES against the chain-link right next to his
head.
A vicious AERIAL PREDATOR a meter across gnashes glass fangs
against the steel. It STABS at him through the chain link
with a tail ending in a glistening stiletto. A STINGBAT.
WAINFLEET casually BLASTS IT with his PISTOL.
It drops off
the fence, tail still lashing.
WAINFLEET
Seen a lotta guys leave this place in a
wheelchair. Never seen anybody show up
in one.
Jake stares at the gnashing fangs of the dying alien.
ON A WALKWAY of the OPS CENTER, seen from above, a UNIFORMED
FIGURE grips the railing, watching Jake pump his chair
through the tunnel below.
The hair is clipped short. The scalp is etched by long
parallel SCARS where some Pandoran denizen's claws raked
across it. The bare arms, below tightly rolled sleeves, seem
hewn out of some hard tropical wood. Criss-crossed by scars.
The MAN raises his masked face to look at the sky.
He eyes
are an icy steel gray.
HIS POV -- the mighty POLYPHEMUS seems to fill the sky,
beyond the clouds.
MAN (V.O.)
You are not in Kansas any more...
CUT TO:
THE MAN from the balcony -- COLONEL MILES QUARITCH -- is the
HEAD OF SECURITY for the Hell's Gate colony. A hundred new
arrivals watch raptly as he paces like a panther across the
front of the large cafeteria. He stops, stance wide.
Without his mask, we see that Quaritch's features are rugged
and handsome, except for the SCAR, which runs from scalp to
jaw down one side of his face. On one hip he carries a very
large PISTOL.
QUARITCH
... You are on Pandora, ladies and
gentlemen. Respect that fact every second
of every day.
10.
JAKE ROLLS IN, watching from the back.
COLONEL QUARITCH raises his hand and points out the window,
toward the dark treeline.
QUARITCH
Out beyond that fence every living thing
that crawls, flies or squats in the mud
wants to kill you and eat your eyes for
jujubees.
The room gets very quiet.
QUARITCH
We have an indigenous population of
humanoids here called the Na'vi. They're
fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin
which can stop your heart in one minute.
We operate -- we live -- at a constant
threat condition yellow.
PAN ACROSS the solid faces of miners, Cat-machine drivers,
engineers, geologists, as they take that in.
QUARITCH
As head of security, it's my job to keep
you alive.
I will not succeed --
(pausing for effect)
-- not with all of you. If you wish to
survive, you need a strong mental
attitude, you need to follow procedure...
PUSH IN ON JAKE, watching as the briefing continues.
JAKE (V.O.)
Nothing like an old-school safety brief
to put your mind at ease.
CUT TO:
People are roaming in both directions, looking for rooms,
lugging duffels and cases.
An eager young XENOANTHROPOLOGIST, staggering under an
overpacked duffel, runs to catch up to Jake.
NORM
Hey, you're Jake right? Tom's brother?
You look just like him.
(off Jake's wary look)
Sorry, I'm Norm Spellman, I went through
avatar training with him.
11.
Norm offers his hand and Jake shakes it.
NORM
He was a great guy -- funny.
It was a
big shock to all of us.
JAKE
Yeah.
Jake pumps the wheels of his chair, rolling on.
Norm walks
with him.
NORM
And duh! -- obviously you look like him.
I mean, if you weren't genetically
identical, you wouldn't be taking over
his avatar.
JAKE
That's why I'm here.
NORM
So -- you want to go check it out?
CUT TO:
JAKE AND NORM enter the BIO-LAB -- a large lab complex with
many adjoining rooms.
MAX
Me and Norm were out here to drive these
remotely controlled bodies called
avatars. They're grown from human DNA
mixed with DNA from the natives here.
A scientist, DOCTOR MAX CULLIMORE, is supervising the
uncrating of two SHIPPING CONTAINERS. The nearer has the
sides removed, revealing -- a ceiling-height acrylic TANK.
Norm stops to stare, and Jake rolls past him as if drawn by
some unseen force, toward --
THE AMNIO TANK. There is a FIGURE floating lanquidly inside,
which looks like a man. A very large, very blue, man.
Blood circulates through a synthetic UMBILICAL in the
abdomen. As the figure turns in the amniotic fluid, we see
that it has a lemur-like TAIL. The skin is cyan-blue. Long
black hair drifts, graceful as seaweed.
JAKE
Damn.
They got big.
12.
NORM
Yeah, they mature on the trip out.
(to Max)
So the proprioceptive sims worked pretty
well.
MAX
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone. Give
us a few hours, you guys can take them
for a spin.
THE FIGURE'S sleeping face turns toward us, and the features
are -- despite feline ears and a long feral snout --
definitely JAKE'S.
JAKE
It looks like him.
NORM
No, it looks like you.
This is your
avatar now, Jake.
ON JAKE, mesmerized as he stares into the tank.
JAKE (V.O.)
The idea is -- every driver is matched to
his own avatar --
STEREOCAM VIDEO SHOT OF JAKE -- facing the camera, talking
directly to the lens. JAKE'S VOICE-OVER up until now has
been part of this VIDEOLOG.
JAKE
-- so their nervous systems are in tune.
Or something. Which is why they offered
me this gig, because I can link with
Tommy's avatar, which was insanely
expensive.
(looking off camera)
Is this right? I just say whatever in
these videologs?
WIDER, showing Norm working nearby with Max.
NORM
Yeah. You just need to get in the habit
of documenting everything -- what you
see, what you feel -- it's all part of
the science. Good science starts with
good observation.
13.
JAKE
Right.
(to camera)
So, whatever. Here I am. Doing science.
(looks around)
Never been in a lab before.
MAX
Log off. It's time to meet your boss for
the next five years.
He leads Jake and Norm through the short corridor to the --
CUT TO:
The LINK ROOM contains a dozen PSIONIC LINK UNITS, which look
like coffins crossed with MRI scanners.
NORM
Grace Augustine is a legend. She's the
head of the Avatar Program, and she wrote
the book -- I mean literally wrote the
book -- on Pandoran botany.
MAX
(low, over his shoulder)
That's because she likes plants better
than people.
DR. GRACE AUGUSTINE sits up in her link, stretching and
cracking her neck after a long session. She's fifty, with a
strong face and fiercely intelligent eyes.
GRACE
(YELLING)
Who's got my goddamn cigarette?!
A TECH scurries to bring it to her, already lit.
Around here
they jump when Grace barks.
Grace stands, scowling, as Jake, Norm and Max approach.
MAX
And here she is, Cinderella back from the
ball. Grace, I'd like you to meet Norm
Spellman and Ja --
GRACE
Norm. I hear good things about you.
How's your Na'vi?
14.
NORM
(Na'vi, subtitled)
May the All Mother smile upon our first
meeting.
Grace nods approvingly, taking a drag on her cigarette.
GRACE
(SUBTITLED)
Not bad. You sound a little formal.
NORM
(SUBTITLED)
There is still much to learn.
Jake waits while they ignore him, chattering in fluent Na'vi.
MAX
Uh, Grace, this is Jake S----
GRACE
(turning to Jake)
Yeah, yeah, I know who you are, and I
don't need you. I need your brother.
(to Max)
You know -- the PhD who trained three
years for this mission.
JAKE
He's dead. I know it's a big
inconvenience to everyone.
GRACE
How much lab training have you had?
Ever
run a gas chromatograph?
JAKE
No.
GRACE
Any actual lab work at all?
JAKE
High school chemistry.
But I ditched.
Grace wheels on Max.
GRACE
You see? You see? They're pissing on us
without even the courtesy of calling it
rain.
(turning away)
I'm going to Selfridge.
15.
She shoves past Jake.
MAX
Grace, that's not a good idea.
But she's already out the door and clomping down the
corridor. Max turns to Jake with a pained look.
MAX
Here, tomorrow, oh eight hundred.
Try to
use big words.
CUT TO:
It looks like an air-traffic control tower, with lots of
screens and bay windows showing the whole complex.
ADMINISTRATOR PARKER SELFRIDGE takes a ball from a newly
opened case of TITLEISTS and sets it on the floor. Selfridge
is young, charismatic, focused. Some would say ruthless.
He assumes the stance and lines up his putt, toward a
practice cup across the control room floor. He glances up as
Grace strides toward him.
GRACE
Parker, I used to think it was benign
neglect, but now I see you're
intentionally screwing us.
SELFRIDGE
Grace.
You know I enjoy our little
talks.
GRACE
I need a research assistant, not some
jarhead dropout.
Selfridge looks down and hits the ball.
Grace kicks the practice cup aside, and the ball rolls past.
Selfridge looks at her with a sigh.
SELFRIDGE
Actually, we got lucky with him.
GRACE
Lucky?
How is this in any way lucky?
As Selfridge saunters over to retrieve the ball --
16.
SELFRIDGE
Well -- lucky your guy had a twin
brother, and lucky the brother wasn't an
oral hygienist or something. A Marine we
can use. I'm assigning him to your team
as security escort.
GRACE
The last thing I need is another trigger
happy asshole out there!
SELFRIDGE
Look, you're supposed to be winning the
hearts and minds of the natives. Isn't
that the whole point of your little
puppet show? If you look like them, if
you talk like them, they'll trust you?
Selfridge crosses to his office, behind a glass wall nearby.
Grace follows.
SELFRIDGE
But after -- how many years? -- relations
with the indigenous are only getting
worse.
GRACE
That tends to happen when you use machine
guns on them.
On Selfridge's desk is a magnetic base, and hovering in mid-
air, in the invisible field, is a lump of METALLIC ROCK.
Pure UNOBTANIUM. He grabs it and holds it up between thumb
and forefinger, in front of Grace's eyes.
SELFRIDGE
This is why we're here. Unobtanium.
Because this little gray rock sells for
twenty million a kilo. No other reason.
This is what pays for the party. And
it's what pays for your science.
Comprendo?
He places it back in the magnetic field.
SELFRIDGE
Those savages are threatening our whole
operation. We're on the brink of war and
you're supposed to be finding a
diplomatic solution. So use what you've
got and get me some results.
CUT TO:
17.
NEXT MORNING, GRACE, NORM and JAKE approach their link units.
Jake glances through a PRESSURE WINDOW. In an adjoining
chamber (the AMBIENT ROOM) JAKE'S AVATAR lies on a gurney,
breathing slowly in PANDORAN AIR. NORM'S AVATAR is on a
second gurney. Both are attended by med techs in exo-masks.
Norm slips into his LINK CHAIR, expertly donning biometric
sensors.
GRACE
How much link time have you logged?
NORM
Five hundred and twenty hours.
Grace looks pointedly at Jake.
JAKE
Like -- an hour.
GRACE
Tell me you're joking.
Grace opens the hood of Jake's link unit. Jake starts
hauling himself across from his wheelchair. She reaches to
help him but --
JAKE
Don't!
I got this.
Grace steps back, hands raised.
He drags himself into the
unit.
GRACE
So you just figured you'd come out here
to the most hostile environment known to
man, with no training of any kind, and
see how it went? What was going through
your head?
He meets her eyes with a defiant glare.
JAKE
Maybe I was just tired of doctors telling
me what I couldn't do.
Grace watches him laboriously pull his inert legs into the
link chair by hand.
18.
Jake settles into the warm fluid gel packs lining the unit.
It seems to enfold him. Grace adjusts his biometric sensors,
then lowers the UPPER CLAMSHELL --
GRACE
Relax and let your mind go blank.
That
shouldn't be hard for you.
JAKE
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white --
But the SLAMMING HOOD muffles the rest.
MAX
Initiate link.
The LINK TECH touches some controls.
ON A LARGE MONITOR a 3D SCAN of Jake's brain appears.
Regions of activity flow with complex shifting colors.
MAX
That's a gorgeous brain.
Nice activity.
GRACE
Go figure.
(walking away)
Alright, I'm going in.
TECH
Phase-lock at forty percent.
He's in
transition.
Max watches a display showing the avatar's nervous system
aligning with Jake's -- two ghostly networks of light
merging.
MAX
That's it.
Find your way home.
ECU JAKE, inside the link unit. His eyes move under the
lids, like a dreamer in REM sleep as --
INSIDE JAKE'S MIND -- radiant streamers coalesce into a
pulsing TUNNEL OF LIGHT and --
THE SCREEN FLARES WHITE -- ZZZWHAP! -- resolving into an
overexposed, out-of-focus image -- two BLURRY FACES wearing
masks, looking down.
ECU JAKE'S AVATAR -- two very intense eyes FILL FRAME, the
pupils contracting. Golden irises pulse with life.
19.
MAX
He's in.
TECH
Phase-lock ninety nine percent. The link
is stable.
Blinking, Jake slowly sits up on the gurney. He looks down
at his AVATAR BODY, touching his chest with one hand.
MAX
Take it slow, Jake. We need to check
your motor control. Try touching your
fingertips together --
But Jake isn't listening. He's staring at his legs.
He
eases them off the gurney and --
HIS BLUE FEET touch the concrete floor, taking his weight.
JAKE STANDS, feeling the strength in his legs.
His
expression is child-like with wonder.
HIS POV -- looking down at the med techs, who seem the size
of children next to his 9' tall frame.
He sees something like a blue tentacle curl across his arm
and he JERKS AROUND in alarm. HIS TAIL.
As he turns to see it, the tail sweeps instruments off a
table with a crash. Jake laughs and grins at Max.
MED TECH
Easy, Jake, I need you to sit down --
But Jake takes a step, then another. The wires to the bio-
monitors pull taut, and he yanks them off his chest.
MAX
Jake! Wait, we have to run some tests --
But Jake pushes past the protesting med techs, toward the
door and --
Jake sits on a wooden bed in a long hut of tropical-style
construction -- beamed ceiling, open sides covered by screen.
Around him the other avatars are bedding down for the night,
pulling insect netting around their cots. In one hand, Jake
holds the end of his long braided QUEUE of hair.
CLOSE ON the queue -- the ends of the hair writhe slowly with
their own life, like tendrils of a sea creature.
JAKE
That's kinda freaky.
GRACE switches off the overheads.
GRACE
Lights out amigos.
See ya' at dinner.
Jake sits in the twilight, listening to the SCREECHES and
HOOTS from the forest. Finally he lies down, CLOSING HIS
EYES and --
ECU HUMAN JAKE -- his eyes OPEN.
Jake blinks, disoriented, as Max opens the upper clamshell of
his link unit.
In the next chair Grace sits up, yawning and cracking her
neck as the scared tech runs to her with a lit cigarette.
GRACE
(looking down)
Damn. Same old sack a' bones.
JAKE struggles with the dead weight of his legs as he hauls
himself out of the unit.
CUT TO
23.
JAKE sits with GRACE, NORM and the other avatar "drivers",
while around them miners, troopers and other base personnel
wolf their breakfasts. Grace is engaged in a heated
conversation with another SCIENTIST.
Jake, isolated from the conversations around him, notices --
PILOT TRUDY CHACON approaching, dressed in her flight suit.
She's a rock-hard former Marine with thousands of flight
hours out in the badlands.
TRUDY
Sully -- Colonel wants to see you in the
Armor Bay.
Jake gives Norm a puzzled glance and pivots from the table.
He wheels away, led by Trudy.
TIGHT ON GRACE, scowling as she watches him go.
CUT TO:
JAKE AND TRUDY enter the ARMOR BAY, passing TILT-ROTORS under
repair. There are the heavily armed SCORPIONS as well as
several SA-2 SAMSON work-horses outfitted with door guns and
rocket pods.
JAKE
You guys're packing some heavy ordinance.
TRUDY
Yeah, `cause we're not the only thing
flyin' around out there. Or the biggest.
I'm gonna need you on a door gun, I'm a
man short.
JAKE
Yeah, no problem.
She extends her fist and he taps it with his.
TRUDY
See ya on the flight-line, zero nine.
(she points)
He's down there.
Jake rolls his chair along the central gallery of the Armor
Bay, passing rows of AMPSUITS standing in service racks.
Techs clamber over the `suits, loading ordinance with cranes
and lifts.
24.
At the end of the row is a makeshift GYM area.
QUARITCH is
bench-pressing massive plates.
QUARITCH
This low gravity makes you soft.
(pushing the last rep)
You get soft, Pandora will shit you out
dead with zero warning.
Quaritch racks the bar and sits up, sweating but not winded.
QUARITCH
I pulled your record, Corporal. Venezuela
-- that was some mean bush. Nothing like
this here, though. You got heart kid,
coming out here.
JAKE
I figured -- just another hellhole.
Quaritch chuckles appreciatively, claps him on the shoulder.
The CHIEF MECHANIC yells from the nearest AMPSUIT --
MECHANIC
That servo's in, Colonel, if you want to
try it.
Quaritch crosses to the `suit, with Jake following.
QUARITCH
I was in First Recon a few years ahead of
you. More than a few. Two tours in
Nigeria, not a scratch. I come out here
and --
He points to his scarred face.
QUARITCH
They could fix this if I rotated back.
But you know what? I kinda like it.
Reminds me every day what's out there.
Besides, I can't leave --
He looks out, as if he can see through the wall to the tree-
line.
QUARITCH
This is my war, here.
Quaritch climbs the `suit and reaches into the cockpit,
throwing some switches. The `suit's gas-turbine spools up
with a rising WHINE.
25.
QUARITCH
The avatar program is a joke -- buncha
limpdick scientists. But we have a
unique opportunity here, you and I. A
recon Marine in an avatar body could get
me the intel I need, on the ground, right
in the hostiles' camp.
The WHINE is now a roaring WHOOSH as the `suit trembles with
power. The air boils above the exhaust vents.
Quaritch reaches in and operates the controls, flexing one
huge hand. He nods to the waiting mechanic --
QUARITCH
Looks good.
(to Jake)
I need you to learn about these savages,
gain their trust. Find out how I can
force their cooperation, or hit `em hard
if they don't. Maybe you can keep some
of my boys from going home like you. Or
bagged-and-tagged.
JAKE
(NODDING)
That sounds real good, Colonel.
So -- am
I still with Augustine?
QUARITCH
On paper. You walk like one of her
science pukes, you quack like one, but
you report to me. Can you do that for
me?
Jake nods. Quaritch brings the `suit to life. He steps
forward and pivots smoothly.
He balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping
the arms in strong, graceful arcs. Jake realizes he is doing
a WU-SHOO KATA. A flawless display of strength and control.
He's impressive, and Jake is impressed. Quaritch is the kind
of man he respects -- focused, hard. Determined.
QUARITCH
Look, son -- I take care of my own. Get
me what I need, I'll see you get your
legs back when you rotate home. Your real
legs.
He raises the `suit's hand, and slams the canopy shut like
the visor of a helmet. Jake watches Quaritch walk past, huge
feet CLANGING -- KUNG! KUNG! KUNG!
26.
GRACE is on the move, gulping coffee, in a hurry to get their
FIRST SORTIE started. She hands a clipboard to MAX.
GRACE
Start calibrating. We're on the flight
line in ten minutes.
Max nods and jogs ahead toward the LINK ROOM. JAKE and NORM
fall in with Grace as they enter the CONNECTING CORRIDOR.
GRACE
What did Atilla want?
JAKE
Just Marines comparin' tattoos.
GRACE
(not buying it)
Yeah. Well, listen to me, Marine --
She stops, turning to drill him with a look.
GRACE
-- you're driving an avatar, now.
That
means you're in my world, got it?
JAKE
Got it.
She turns and enters the LINK ROOM.
Grace crosses to the controls of Jake's LINK UNIT. As the
others catch up --
GRACE
That son of a bitch has screwed up this
program enough. All this --
(indicating link room)
-- exists so we can go out there and
build a bridge of trust to these people,
who could teach us so much. But thanks
to Quaritch and his thugs the Na'vi won't
even talk to us anymore.
JAKE
Then how's this supposed to work?
27.
GRACE
We have a new face.
(turning to Norm)
You're fluent, you've studied the
culture. You're non-threatening. The
ones we know best -- the Omaticaya clan --
may give you a chance. Maybe you can get
them back to the table before things go
tits-up for good.
NORM
This is failing as a pep talk.
Jake hauls himself across from wheelchair to link.
JAKE
How do we contact them?
GRACE
We don't. They contact us. If they see
us taking our samples, treating the
forest with respect --
(pointedly to Jake)
Not trampling everything in sight --
they may reach out to us.
JAKE
Or they may skin us and make a drum.
Jake lies back, lowering the sensor array over his body.
GRACE
Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do
the talking.
She closes his clamshell, HARD, and we --
CUT TO:
TRACKING WITH JAKE'S BOOTS as he steps among dried leaves and
a few moldering CHILDREN'S BOOKS. Floorboards CREAK.
GRACE (O.S.)
The kids were so bright, so eager to
learn... they picked up English faster
than I could teach it to them.
WIDER as Jake explores the room. Grace and Norm are selecting
INSTRUMENTS from storage cases on a wooden table.
GRACE
Bring the soil probe -- right there,
yellow case.
Jake looks up at a RUSTLING among the dark rafters. Roosting
STINGBATS eye him warily, fluttering their wings.
Grace picks up a moldering copy of "The Lorax" by Dr. Seuss
from the floor and puts it back on a shelf.
GRACE
(WISTFULLY)
The stingbats knock them off. I guess I
always hope somebody will come back and
read them.
NORM
Why don't they come back?
GRACE
(GRIMLY)
The Na'vi learned as much about us as
they needed to know.
Jake sees something, and approaches the blackboard -- reaches
out to touch a pattern of holes blasted into the slate.
Unmistakably BULLET HOLES.
31.
JAKE
(turning to her)
What happened here?
GRACE
(SHARPLY)
Are you going to help with this gear?
We've got a lot to do.
She turns away.
Jake watches her as he jams equipment into
his pack.
CUT TO:
GRACE and NORM peer down into the shadowed forest as TRUDY
banks in a search pattern.
TRUDY (INTERCOM)
I'm going to have to call it, guys. We're
not allowed to run night ops. Colonel's
orders.
36.
Grace looks to the west.
The sun setting behind alien trees.
GRACE
Shit.
TRUDY
Sorry, Doc. He's just gonna have to hang
on `till morning.
GRACE
He's not going to make it till morning.
Grace stares into the dark forest as the Samson banks hard,
thundering away toward the setting sun.
CUT TO:
An open CENTRAL AREA. The villagers gather to see the
arriving hunt party. We see the people of the tribe --
mothers with babies, old women, young hunters.
They gawk at the alien, expressions ranging from curiosity to
outright hostility. The huge eyes of the children follow
him.
Jake is amazed at the size of HOMETREE inside. By the light
of the COOK-FIRES he can see up into a vast cylindrical
gallery -- a living cathedral.
Clear membranes -- sturmbeest bladders -- filled with
fluttering bio-luminescent insects, act as area lighting.
The central space is dominated by the SKULL of some enormous
creature, mounted with much embellishment on a TOTEM.
Standing in front of this, awaiting their approach, is --
EYTUKAN (AY-too-kahn), the Clan Leader. Eytukan has deeply
chiselled features and a long chest mantle of THANATOR CLAWS.
His normally stern features are clouded further by anger.
EYTUKAN
(SUBTITLED)
Why do you bring this creature here?
Neytiri addresses Eytukan in Na'vi.
NEYTIRI
(SUBTITLED)
I was going to kill him, but there was a
sign from Eywa.
He glowers at her as he responds, pointing at Jake.
EYTUKAN
(SUBTITLED)
I have said no dreamwalker will come
here, to offend our home! His alien
smell fills my nose
Neytiri stands her ground, answering in a respectful but not
submissive tone.
46.
NEYTIRI
(SUBTITLED)
Father, many atokirina came to this
alien.
JAKE
What's going on?
NEYTIRI
My father is deciding whether to kill
you.
JAKE
Your father!?
(to Eytukan)
Uh, good to meet you, sir.
Jake steps forward, offering his hand, and the hunters JUMP
to restrain him, shouting. But they all FREEZE as --
A commanding FEMALE VOICE echoes through the chamber.
MO'AT
(NA'VI)
Step back!
Everybody looks up.
MO'AT (MOH-aht) stands on the second level, looking down.
She is a severe woman in her 50's. Her bearing is haughty,
her expression friendly as a hanging-judge. Her outfit is
elaborate, denoting her rank as CLAN MATRIARCH.
MO'AT
(SUBTITLED)
I will look at this alien.
There is an expectant hush as Mo'at descends the helical core
of Hometree, a kind of natural spiral staircase.
NEYTIRI
That is Mother. She is Tsahik -- the one
who interprets the will of Eywa.
JAKE
Who's Eywa?
Neytiri kneels before her like an acolyte as Mo'at passes.
The villagers stare silently as the Matriarch circles slowly
around Jake, examining his tail and the end of his queue.
47.
MO'AT
(thick accent)
What are you called?
JAKE
Jake Sully.
She produces a long THORN between her fingertips. With a
flourish she strikes his chest.
Jake flinches. RED BLOOD wells up and Mo'at rubs some
between her fingertips. She tastes it.
MO'AT
Why did you come to us?
JAKE
I came to learn.
MO'AT
We have tried to teach other Sky People.
It is hard to fill a cup which is already
full.
JAKE
My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask
Doctor Augustine. I'm no scientist.
MO'AT
What are you?
JAKE
I don't know. I was a Marine -- uh, a
warrior. Of the Jarhead clan.
TSU'TEY
(SUBTITLED)
A warrior! I could kill him easily!
EYTUKAN
(SUBTITLED)
No! This is the first warrior
dreamwalker we have seen. We need to
learn more about him.
JAKE
What's going on?
What are they saying?
MO'AT
(to Neytiri, subtitled)
Daughter. You will teach him our way, to
speak and walk as we do.
48.
NEYTIRI looks shocked, then angry.
NEYTIRI
(SUBTITLED)
Why me? That's not fair!
I only--
MO'AT
(SUBTITLED)
It is decided!
Neytiri subsides, turning to glare at Jake.
MO'AT
(to Jake)
My daughter will teach you our ways.
Learn well, Jakesully. We will see if
your insanity can be cured.
She turns to Neytiri, her expression stern --
MO'AT
(SUBTITLED)
He is your responsibility.
Neytiri nods, accepting, but she's not a happy camper.
She
grabs Jake's arm and pulls him roughly away.
JAKE
So it's all good, right?
You and me --
NEYTIRI
Do not speak.
CUT TO:
LATER, Neytiri leads Jake up the spiral to the SECOND LEVEL.
He now wears only a ratty LOINCLOTH. His wounds are bound
with plant-fiber bandages.
THE ENTIRE CLAN is squatting at dinner in a huge circle. They
stop talking and turn to gaze at Jake as he enters the
circle.
JAKE
Don't get up.
Neytiri crosses the circle to the cook pit and returns with
several large leaves heaped with food. She kneels next to
Jake, placing the food in front of him almost DEFIANTLY.
JAKE
You never told me your name.
49.
NEYTIRI
Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.
JAKE
Okay, again, a whole lot slower.
NEYTIRI
(exaggerated slowness)
Neytiri. Nay-TEE-ree.
Jake knows she's baiting him.
He smiles in response.
JAKE
Nay-TEE-ree. That's nice. Nay-TEE-ree.
ACROSS THE CIRCLE, Tsu'tey, Mo'at and Eytukan sit together,
glancing up occasionally from their food to the stranger.
TSU'TEY
(SUBTITLED)
These aliens try to look like people, but
they can't.
MO'AT
(SUBTITLED)
He seems dim to me.
And his eyes are too
small.
NEYTIRI motions for Jake to take portions from the serving
leaves onto his own leaf.
JAKE
Your mom likes me.
I can tell.
MO'AT, watching Jake and Neytiri, leans over to Eytukan.
MO'AT
(SUBTITLED)
Neytiri will test this "warrior." Hey may
learn nothing -- but we will learn much.
EYTUKAN
You speak truth. We must understand
these Sky People if we are to drive them
out.
Jake munches on a white shrimp-like thing.
JAKE
These rock. What are they?
NEYTIRI
Teylu. You call beetle larvae.
50.
Jake blanches. She heaps some more onto his leaf -- a
CHALLENGE -- and Jake meets her eyes, takes a handful, and
starts munching enthusiastically.
JAKE
That's some damn fine teylu. That's like
grandma's teylu.
CU TSU'TEY, warily eyeing Jake --
TSU'TEY
(SUBTITLED)
I say she will kill him.
CUT TO:
The sleeping level -- families nesting in groups on woven
hammocks the size of trampolines. The hunters sleep along
SPOKES joining the inner trunk to the tree's outer shell.
Jake lies awake in a hammock, people rustling in the darkness
around him. Neytiri is nearby, curled up like a little girl.
She stares at him for a moment, then closes her eyes.
Jake watches the glowing bugs fluttering inside a night-
light, a pulse of life energy. A strange peace spreads
through him. He closes his eyes and --
CUT TO:
GRACE is over JAKE in the Link, SLAPPING him, as Max and NORM
hover.
GRACE
Come on back, kid, that's it.
JAKE
Wha --? Oh.
He looks around, blinking.
Reality crashing in.
GRACE
Damn, you were dug in like a tick.
(she helps him sit up)
Is the avatar safe?
JAKE
(huge grin)
Yeah, Doc -- and you are not going to
believe where I am.
CUT TO:
51.
BREAKFAST the next day. The other drivers lean forward,
hanging on Grace's re-telling of the tale.
GRACE
-- so the kid's out there one night and
he's got the Queen Bitch herself offering
him the spare room and the car keys.
Unbelievable.
JAKE
It's not something you can teach.
Some of the other scientists clap Jake on the shoulders in
congratulation.
MAX
That's awesome, Jake.
NORM chomps his bacon, fuming.
GRACE
(to Jake, getting serious)
For reasons I cannot fathom, the
Omaticaya have chosen you. God help us
all.
CUT TO:
JAKE has reported to SELFRIDGE and QUARITCH. Quaritch turns
from gazing out at the wall of forest, displaying a feral
grin.
QUARITCH
Jarhead clan?
(he laughs)
And that worked?
JAKE
(GRINNING)
Yeah. They want to study me.
See if I
can learn to be one of them.
QUARITCH
That's how you seize the initiative. I
wish I had ten more like you.
SELFRIDGE
Look, Sully -- find out what these blue
monkeys want.
(MORE)
52.
SELFRIDGE (cont'd)
We try to give them medicine and
education. Roads! But no -- they like
mud. I wouldn't care except --
Selfridge turns to a large 3D GRAPHIC DISPLAY, pointing. A
road runs from Hell's Gate to a proposed new mine miles away.
SELFRIDGE
Their damn village is sitting right over
the richest unobtanium deposit for a
hundred klicks in any direction. Which
sucks -- for them -- because they need to
relocate.
JAKE
(taking that in)
Does Augustine know about this?
SELFRIDGE
Yeah, she does, and she's on the next
ship back if she tries to cock-block me
on it.
JAKE
So -- who talks them into moving?
QUARITCH
(TURNING)
Guess.
JAKE
What if they won't go?
QUARITCH
(ICY)
I'm betting they will.
SELFRIDGE
Killing the indigenous looks bad, but
there's one thing shareholders hate more
than bad press -- and that's a bad
quarterly statement. Find me a carrot to
get them to move, or it's going to have
to be all stick.
Jake is shaken by the enormity of this new responsibility.
QUARITCH
You got three months.
That's when the
dozers get there.
JAKE
I'm on it.
CUT TO:
53.
JAKE pumps his chair across the lab, flanked by GRACE and
NORM. Grace holds STEREO STILL PICTURES in front of him, one
at a time -- images of clan members she has shot over the
years -- a kind of flash card drill.
JAKE
Tsu'tey.
(next photo)
Mo'at.
(next photo)
Eytukan.
GRACE
He's the clan leader --
(indicating Mo'at)
-- but she's the spiritual leader.
Like
a shaman.
The dialogue is continuous as they enter.
JAKE
Got it. So who's this Eywa?
NORM
Who's Eywa? Oh, only their deity. The
Great Mother. The goddess made up of all
living things. You'd know that if you
had any training whatsoever.
He hauls himself from wheelchair to Link.
JAKE
Who's got a date with the chief's
daughter?
GRACE
Knock it off. Jesus, it's like
kindergarten around here.
As Jake settles into the soft embrace of the link, Grace
inputs commands at the control station.
GRACE
Neytiri was my best student. She and her
sister Silwanin. Just amazing girls.
JAKE
I didn't meet the sister.
54.
GRACE
(QUIETLY)
No, she's dead.
(turning to him)
Okay, let's go -- village life starts
early.
MAX
Link is ready.
Grace lowers the bio-sensor array over Jake's chest.
GRACE
Don't do anything unusually stupid.
She closes the clamshell and we --
CU JAKE'S AVATAR, blinking awake, staring up at --
HOMETREE, like a gothic cathedral overhead.
Sunlight streams
down through gaps in the towering vault.
CUT TO:
JAKE walks among the villagers, who go about their daily
tasks.
-- young girls sit together, weaving and SINGING.
They look
up as he passes, then go back to work.
--two men clean the fish they've caught.
-- a young mother pounds seeds into meal, while nursing an
infant.
--children chase each other and climb like monkeys. One bold
LITTLE GIRL runs up to Jake, stops -- staring -- then shrieks
with laughter as she runs back to her playmates.
GRINNING, Jake turns to see NEYTIRI cantering toward him on a
DIREHORSE. She leads a second horse, an old sway-backed
MARE. His grin drops.
JAKE, GRACE and NORM are packing science gear and supplies.
GRACE
I'm not about to let Quaritch and
Selfridge micro-manage this thing.
(she looks pointedly at Jake)
We're going up into the mountains.
(MORE)
57.
GRACE (cont'd)
There's a mobile link up at Site 26 that
we can work out of.
NORM
The Hallelujah Mountains?
GRACE
That's right.
NORM
Yesssss!
(off Jake's look)
The legendary Floating Mountains of
Pandora? Heard of them?
CUT TO:
NORM and TRUDY assist JAKE with his chair as they cycle in
through the AIRLOCK. GRACE is already inside, starting the
GENNY. She turns on the lights and equipment.
There are 4 bunks, a clutter of science gear, and -- through
a short connecting corridor -- THREE LINK UNITS in the second
module.
As Grace powers up the Link equipment, Jake stops to look at
STEREO STILL PICTURES which are taped and tacked up around
her workstation.
CLOSE ON PICTURES -- Grace posing at the school with various
grinning children. There is one of her with two lanky girls,
a younger Neytiri and an older girl who looks much like her.
GRACE
Jake, take number two, it's the least
glitchy. Norm, I need you to operate
Jake's link.
Norm glares at Jake as he passes.
JAKE
Hey. You got a problem?
Norm turns to Grace, his frustration boiling over.
NORM
I trained three years for this mission.
I speak the language fluently.
(he points at Jake)
He falls off the frickin' turnip truck
and all of a sudden he's cultural
ambassador!?
GRACE
It's not our choice, Norm.
He glowers at Jake.
NORM
Yeah, well I didn't come out here to wash
the dishes while you're on some
interspecies booty call.
He stalks off.
GRACE
He can't go far.
60.
She points to Jake's link.
GRACE
Let's get you in.
CUT TO:
LOOKING DOWN the central shaft of Hometree, 80 meters to the
ground. Villagers are ant-like.
Jake tries to keep up with Neytiri as she leaps up the core
trunk like a lemur. He climbs the last section, arriving out
of breath beside her. She leads him OUTSIDE, onto --
A large branch. Through gaps in the foliage Jake can see
other Great Trees scattered across the landscape, like
enormous umbrellas above the rainforest.
NEYTIRI strides out across the branch toward some kind of
STRUCTURE -- a WEB made of thick woven fiber. DARK SHAPES
clinging to it stir with a leathery RUSTLING SOUND.
Neytiri makes a series of TRILLS and CLICKS. One of the
shapes MOVES toward them, emerging into a shaft of sunlight.
A huge MOUNTAIN BANSHEE. Much larger than the forest
banshees, this thing is taller than a Na'vi with a 10 meter
wingspan. A leathery FWHOOP, like the crack of sails, as it
alights on the branch right in front of her.
JAKE
Holy shit.
NEYTIRI
Do not look in her eye.
Neytiri feeds it a large scrap of meat, which it SNATCHES and
gulps down. She murmurs to it and strokes its NECK.
It lets out a signature SHRIEK, and some of the others in the
shadows nearby answer.
Neytiri flip-catches her queue and gently connects it to the
Banshee's ANTENNA. It shivers and stretches its wings as the
neural connection is made.
NEYTIRI
Ikran is not horse. Once shahaylu is
made, ikran will fly with only one Hunter
in the whole life.
She climbs smoothly onto the animal's back.
61.
NEYTIRI
To become taronyu -- Hunter -- you must
choose your own ikran. And he must choose
you.
JAKE
When?
NEYTIRI
When you are ready.
The BANSHEE shivers with anticipation.
NEYTIRI
Heeyaaahh!
Jake ducks as the great wings EXPLODE OPEN and the banshee
DROPS off the branch. It swoops down across the forest
canopy, banks hard, lets out a CRY and beats its wings in a
power climb.
Completing the bank, Neytiri directs the banshee into a close
SWOOPING FLYBY, and Jake instinctively ducks.
ON NEYTIRI -- flying in perfect fusion with her winged mount,
the rainforest rolling beneath her.
CUT TO:
STEREO VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- Jake has just switched on the
camera. He looks tired.
JAKE
Do I have to do this?
I need some rack.
GRACE, behind him, looks up from her MICROSCOPE, scowling.
GRACE
No -- now, when it's fresh.
JAKE
Yeah, yeah.
(to camera)
The days are starting to blur together.
The language is a bitch, but I figure
it's like field-stripping a weapon.
Repetition.
THIS THROWS US INTO A TEACHING MONTAGE:
JAKE AND NEYTIRI kneel together inside Hometree. Neytiri
touches her lips with her fingertips.
62.
JAKE
Seyri.
She touches her nose, her ears, her eyes in quick sequence.
JAKE
Ontu, mikyun, nari.
NEYTIRI stands next to him, correcting his position as he
draws a longbow.
BARKING commands, she SMACKS him on the shoulder, then the
elbow, repositioning him roughly.
JAKE (V.O.)
Neytiri thinks I'm some kind of retard.
HUMAN JAKE emerges from the LINK to see --
TRUDY and NORM caught IN THE ACT on Norm's bunk. Norm blushes
and Trudy waves, pulling the blanket over their heads.
JAKE (V.O.)
Norm's attitude has improved lately.
NORM works with JAKE at the small table in the SHACK kitchen.
NORM
Thank you?
JAKE
Ireiyo.
Norm comically exaggerates the pronunciation.
NORM
Irrrreiyo. Irrrreiyo.
You've gotta roll
the R, r-r-r-oll it.
Norm makes Jake repeat the word, getting more frustrated.
JAKE (V.O.)
It's good he's back on board, but he
thinks I'm a retard too.
TRACKING WITH JAKE'S FEET as he runs over rocks, leaping onto
a thick root, running on across the rough bark.
JAKE (V.O.)
My feet are getting tougher.
I can run
farther every day.
63.
Neytiri leads him along a massive root, and soon they are
running 30 meters above the ground.
He sprints with her through the trees, trying to keep up.
She CLIMBS and LEAPS with the ease of a spider monkey.
JAKE (V.O.)
I have to trust my body to know what to
do. With Neytiri it's learn fast or die.
Neytiri LEAPS off into space, falling, falling until --
She catches an enormous palm leaf and, gripping it, allows
its DROOP to slow her fall. She lets go, plummeting, and
catches another.
JAKE FOLLOWS in a leap of faith. THE CAMERA PLUNGES with
him, from leaf to leaf, down and down in a dizzying kinetic
rush.
He drops down from the last leaf, landing next to her on a
game trail. He is exhilarated to still be alive.
Neytiri is surprised -- that he followed.
That he lived.
TIGHT ON HUMAN JAKE, in the shack. Thinking as he looks at
the pictures of Grace with the laughing kids at the school.
IN THE COMMONS -- AVATAR NORM formally greets MO'AT. The
Matriarch looks on as GRACE kneels to hug children she knows.
Grace's eyes sparkle as she chats with them in Na'vi.
JAKE (V.O.)
I sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and
Grace a hall pass. Now Grace even makes
me coffee before link every morning.
Grace looks up to see Neytiri approaching. It is an awkward
moment between them. Grace makes the formal gesture of
greeting.
GRACE
(Na'vi, subtitled)
I See you, Neytiri Mo'at'ite.
NEYTIRI
I See you, Doctor Grace Augustine.
ANOTHER DAY -- NEYTIRI kneels on a game trail, pointing out
the tracks in the mud to Jake. She touches the edges of the
plants around her, and sniffs the air.
64.
JAKE (V.O.)
I'm learning to read the trails, the
tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest
scents and sounds.
JAKE AND NEYTIRI watch through a screen of leaves as --
A HERD of huge, armored STURMBEEST walks through the shallows
of a lake. In the middle of the herd, the babies are
sheltered from predators among their parents' legs.
One of the BULLS trumpets, and a flock of TETRAPTERONS takes
flight, an explosion of purple wings.
Jake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau.
ANOTHER PLACE -- NEYTIRI STANDS utterly still, except for her
ears, which move with a life of their own. Her eyes are
closed. She speaks very softly to Jake --
NEYTIRI
When you hear nothing, you will hear
everything. When you see nothing, you
will See everything.
JAKE (V.O.)
Sometimes I have no idea what she's
talking about.
Jake and Neytiri creep quietly, stalking a large male
HEXAPEDE -- a six legged deer-like creature.
Jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as Neytiri
watches. He takes a bead on the hexapede -- tracks it for a
beat with the drawn bow, then RELAXES his arm. Zen archery.
JAKE (V.O.)
It's been a month and I'm still not
allowed to make a kill. She says the
forest hasn't given permission.
OMIITED
NEYTIRI and JAKE crawl through the undergrowth.
She points
and he parts some leaves to see --
A MOTHER VIPERWOLF bringing meat to her cubs, which frisk
around her legs. She licks their faces.
JAKE (V.O.)
There's a lot of crap like that. She's
always going on about the flow of energy--
the spirits of the animals and what not --
65.
VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- HUMAN JAKE talks into the lens.
He's
changing -- un-shaven, cheeks hollow. Pale.
JAKE
(SMIRKING)
I just hope this treehugger shit isn't on
the final.
Visible behind him, Grace is hunched over her samples.
GRACE
(without looking up)
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there. You need to
listen to what she says. Try to see the
forest through their eyes.
JAKE
Excuse me -- this is my video-log here,
okay?
NEYTIRI AND JAKE move through the NIGHT FOREST, surrounded by
galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence. They move
gracefully, soundlessly -- two forest spirits.
CU JAKE -- the pupils of his cat eyes dilated. The night
forest floods his brain with its million bio-sources.
NIGHT SHOT, from overhead -- Jake and Neytiri bow-fishing
from a dugout canoe over huge glowing ANEMONES at the bottom
of a pool.
A large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow.
ZAP!
Jake drills it. He holds up the fish, triumphantly.
ANOTHER DAY -- Neytiri stands close behind Jake, adjusting
his position as he draws his bow. Only now her hands are
GENTLE as they move on his arms, his shoulders.
Aware of her touch, Jake's focus is broken.
Their eyes meet,
and she pulls away quickly.
NIGHT -- they enter a CLEARING filled with chest-high ferns.
Neytiri signals him to move slowly. They approach a creature
on one of the ferns. An ugly, stick-like LIZARD-THING
perched on a frond. As he approaches --
SNAP! A long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a
bioluminescent membrane -- a disk a meter across, opening
like a Chinese fan. It FLIES OFF, a living Frisbee.
THE FAN LIZARD FLOATS across the clearing.
66.
Neytiri plunges among the ferns with a SHARP CRY. An
EXPLOSION OF COLOR as dozens of FAN LIZARDS take flight.
Grinning widely, she hops around like a little girl, until
they are all flying. And for the first time, she is
unguarded and joyful, totally herself with him.
INSIDE THE LINK -- Jake's eyes open in the darkness. He
doesn't know where he is. He weakly pushes open the lid,
blinking at the light.
JAKE (V.O.)
Everything is backwards now. Like out
there is the true world, and in here is
the dream.
TIGHT ON AVATAR JAKE silently drawing his bow, his eyes
focused in intense concentration. A beat -- the arrow flies.
JAKE PULLS the arrow from the twitching body of a hexapede.
He dispatches it with his knife.
He speaks haltingly, but with feeling, in Na'vi.
JAKE
(NA'VI)
I See you Brother, and thank you. Your
spirit goes with Eywa, your body stays
behind to become part of the People.
NEYTIRI watches with approval.
NEYTIRI
A clean kill. You are ready.
CUT TO:
Lying in the link, Jake looks exhausted, pale, thin.
Norm
helps Grace get him to his chair.
GRACE
You're still losing weight.
Here --
She hands him a microwaved burrito. He looks at the now alien
food. Bites into it without enthusiasm.
JAKE
I made a kill today. We ate it.
I know
where that meal came from.
67.
GRACE
Other body. You need to take care of
this body.
JAKE
Yeah yeah.
GRACE
Jake, I'm serious -- you look like crap.
You're burning too hard.
Jake takes the cigarette out of her mouth and stubs it out.
JAKE
Get rid of this shit, then you can
lecture me.
GRACE
I'm telling you, as your boss and someone
who might even consider being a friend
someday, to take some down time.
JAKE
Not now. Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya.
GRACE walks past Jake, starts making herself coffee.
GRACE
Yeah -- you're gonna go ride a banshee.
Or die trying.
JAKE
That's right, Grace. This is what I've
been working for.
GRACE
And this is your check up from the neck
up, Marine. You're getting in way too
deep.
(she turns away)
Trust me, I learned the hard way.
Jake scans the pictures tacked up around Grace's workstation.
JAKE
What did happen at the school?
GRACE looks up from making coffee.
Her eyes track across the
pictures of the laughing children.
Finally --
68.
GRACE
Neytiri's sister -- Sylwanin -- stopped
coming to school. She was angry about
the clear-cutting.
GRACE sips her coffee, grimaces at the taste.
GRACE
One day, she and a couple of other young
hunters came running in, all painted up --
they'd set a bulldozer on fire -- I guess
they thought I could protect them.
GRACE'S voice stays oddly CALM as he tells this terrible
story, while getting MILK out of the refrigerator.
GRACE
The troopers pursued them to the
schoolhouse.
MACRO as she pours the milk -- her hand is SHAKING.
GRACE
They killed Sylwanin in the doorway.
Right in front of Neytiri. Then shot the
others.
(MILDLY)
I got most of the kids out, before they
shot me.
JAKE
Jesus.
GRACE
Yeah.
Jake realizes that Grace is on the verge of tears and
desperately trying to hide it.
GRACE
A scientist stays objective -- we can not
be ruled by emotion. But I poured ten
years of my life into that school. They
called me sa'atenuk. Mother.
(turning to him)
That kind of pain reaches back through
the link.
GRACE sits down at the table, looks intently at Jake.
GRACE
It's a job. Learn what you can -- but
don't get attached.
69.
GRACE looks at him with real PAIN in her eyes.
GRACE
It's not our world, Jake.
And we can't
stop what's coming.
CUT TO:
FLIGHT MONTAGE:
NEYTIRI squats with Jake, using her hands to explain flight
principles like one fighter pilot to another.
LOOKING DOWN a sheer cliff. SWOOOSH! Jake and Neytiri dive
their mounts STRAIGHT DOWN PAST CAMERA, pulling out and
soaring into a series of aerobatic turns.
JAKE (V.O.)
I may not be much of a horse guy.
But I
was born to do this.
74.
THEY FLY in close formation with TSU'TEY and the young
HUNTERS, 5 banshees flashing through scarves of mist.
ANOTHER DAY. Jake dives, playing hide and seek with Neytiri
among the clouds. They are wild and free in a wild world.
She grins and banks hard, diving -- catch me if you can. He
DIVES after her.
IN THE GROTTO, by firelight, JAKE'S BANSHEE snaps at a piece
of meat which he playfully pulls back. He's teaching it to
take the food more slowly. He strokes its long head.
TSU'TEY is nearby with the young hunters.
He eyes Jake with
frustrated hostility.
ANOTHER DAY -- Jake and Neytiri fly abreast, soaring easily.
She points and Jake sees --
A BIZARRE GEOLOGICAL FORMATION. Arches of magnetic rock form
rainbows of stone above a deep CALDERA. In the center of the
caldera is a single, enormous WILLOW TREE, gnarled and
ancient. This, we will be told, is THE WELL OF SOULS.
CUT TO:
Jake ponders images Grace has called up at her workstation--
science graphics of the Leonopteryx. Trudy and Norm are
crowded around as well.
GRACE
The Great Leonopteryx is the apex aerial
predator. Not only rare, but the
sightings tend not to get reported.
Trudy makes a clicking motion with her thumb.
TRUDY
There usually isn't time to key the mike.
JAKE
The People call it Toruk.
NORM
(TRANSLATING)
Last Shadow.
JAKE
Last one you ever see.
TRUDY
I saw one take out a gunship once --
WHAM! Total frickin' yard sale. Ate the
crew like peanuts.
TIME CUT -- Grace is scanning through images and Jake stops
her on one -- a 3D aerial shot of the strange arched
formation.
JAKE
That's it.
GRACE
Vitraya Ramunong -- The Well of Souls.
It's their most sacred place.
She moves the virtual camera, and we seem to fly around the
Well of Souls, catching only a glimpse of the interior.
76.
GRACE
Something big is going on in there,
biologically. I'd die to get samples, but
outsiders are strictly forbidden.
TIME CUT -- Jake looks through the pressure window at HUMAN
GRACE and NORM outside. Wearing masks, they are taking
readings from some time-series experiments Grace has set up.
As TRUDY watches, JAKE works fast to download Grace's images
of the Well of Souls onto a memory chip.
TRUDY
They're coming back.
Jake pulls the chip, then hesitates. Torn by what he is
doing.
TRUDY
If you don't give him something, he's
gonna shut us down.
He hands her the chip and she slips it into a pocket of her
flight-suit just as Grace and Norm enter from the airlock.
JAKE
Hey, guys.
CUT TO:
JAKE STARES up at the TOTEM SKULL, which we now recognize as
that of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX. NEYTIRI watches as he reaches
up to touch the tall indigo crest.
NEYTIRI
My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk
Macto -- Rider of Last Shadow. Toruk
chose him. It has only happened five
times since the time of the First Songs.
JAKE
That's a long time.
Neytiri takes his hand, because that's what the Na'vi do when
they're telling you something important.
NEYTIRI
Toruk Macto was mighty -- he brought the
clans together in a time of great sorrow.
All Na'vi people know this story.
77.
PUSH IN SLOWLY on the skull totem, then --
CUT TO:
The central space is lit by a BONFIRE, around which the HUNT
FESTIVAL is in full swing. Wild dancing. People gnawing on
massive sturmbeest ribs. A bowl of some kava-like intoxicant
is passed around.
NEYTIRI dances in a flowing costume as the BANSHEE SPIRIT.
NORM is dancing seductively with his own tail.
JAKE, surrounded by young hunters, acts out the leonopteryx
attack with his hands. The leaping fire-light plays across
the eye sockets of the TORUK SKULL, bringing it to life. It
seems to watch Jake.
TSU'TEY squats next to Jake, the usual scowl on his face.
Jake braces himself -- and Tsu'tey holds up the KAVA BOWL,
offering it to him. A challenge or an olive branch?
Jake takes a long, hearty drink as some of the young hunters
hoot and clap hands in a fast rhythm.
78.
GRACE
Watch that stuff.
It'll knock you into
next week.
Jake offers the bowl back to Tsu'tey.
They lock eyes.
Tsu'tey drinks.
LATER -- AN EMPTY BOWL drops, landing on a pile of empty
bowls near the fire.
WIDER ON JAKE and TSU'TEY, sitting amid the rowdy hunters.
Tsu'tey looks a little blearily at Jake. Finally, he GRINS.
TSU'TEY
I thought -- enough drink -- you would
not be so ugly.
JAKE
Sorry.
Tsu'tey looks deep into the fire.
TSU'TEY
Your warriors -- hide inside machines --
fight from far away.
(he looks at Jake)
I did not think a sky person could be
brave.
Before Jake can answer, NEYTIRI'S lithe shape runs through
the circle of silhouetted dancers toward them. She takes
Jake by the hand and pulls him up --
NEYTIRI
You must dance! It is the way.
TSU'TEY watches as she leads him away, his face darkening --
the moment of connection to Jake lost to anger.
The hunters WHOOP and CHEER as Jake joins the circle of
dancers.
Jake takes Grace's hand and pulls her up, protesting.
JAKE lets the DRUMS and CHANTING flow through him. He lets
himself go, dancing from the inside, channeling the primal
energy.
GRACE is rocking out, grinning. We see the young girl, so
repressed, who lives within her.
Jake and Neytiri flow amongst the dancers, but they are
looking only at each other.
79.
A couple of the young girls watching from outside the circle
are giggling and talking about them. Mo'at and EYTUKAN
follow their look, seeing the obvious connection.
MO'AT
(SUBTITLED)
We cannot let this seed grow. Her path is
with Tsu'tey.
ON JAKE, dancing with abandon to the primal beat, eyes locked
with Neytiri.
CUT TO:
A break table, under a harsh overhead light. Quaritch pulls
up a chair, turns it around, and sits astride it facing Jake.
He studies Jake's pale, sunken face. The scraggly beard.
QUARITCH
You're not gettin' lost in the woods, are
you son?
Jake can't meet his eyes.
QUARITCH
Your last report was two weeks ago. I'm
starting to doubt your resolve. From what
I see, it's time to terminate this
mission.
Jake eyes flare with alarm.
JAKE
No.
I can do this.
QUARITCH
Look, you've given me plenty of usable
intel. Like this "Well of Souls" place --
I've got them by the balls with that,
when it turns into a shit-fight. Which it
will.
Jake feels hollow inside, knowing what he's done.
82.
QUARITCH
So you'll get your legs back, like I
promised.
(puts his hand on Jake's
SHOULDER)
It's time to come in.
Jake ponders this. Isn't this what he was doing all this for?
JAKE
I've gotta finish this thing. There's
one more test -- the Dream Hunt. It's the
final stage of becoming a man. Then I'm
one of them. They'll trust what I say...
It's hard for him to even form these words --
JAKE
... and I can negotiate the terms of
their relocation.
QUARITCH
Then you need to get it done, Corporal.
CUT TO:
Jake is gulping black coffee like a tequila shot, looking
pretty STRUNG OUT. GRACE is smoking furiously.
GRACE
Jake, I can't allow this.
You're just
not strong enough.
JAKE
It's the last door -- I'm going through
it. You can help me or get out of the
way.
Jake pushes past her toward the corridor --
GRACE
(grabbing him)
Will you listen to me? Sometimes the
Na'vi themselves die in these vision
quests. The venom takes you to the edge
of death.
(MORE)
83.
GRACE (cont'd)
And the psychoactive alkaloid in the worm-
- we have no idea what that'll do in an
avatar brain.
Jake breaks free and wheels away, down the corridor.
GRACE follows JAKE as he crosses to the Link. A sheet of
LIGHTNING flashes across the sky outside.
Norm is initializing the Link.
NORM
Calibrating. Thirty seconds.
She puts her hands on his shoulders.
GRACE
No matter what you prove out there-- you
are still in here.
(shaking him)
Right here.
JAKE
I have to go all the way -- become one of
THEM--
GRACE
(FURIOUSLY)
Goddammit, Jake, you can never be one of
them!
Norm looks up, startled at the VEHEMENCE in GRACE' voice.
GRACE
Our life out there takes millions of
dollars of machinery to sustain. You
visit -- and you leave.
During this, Jake pulls himself from his wheelchair, levering
himself into the Link, hauling his useless legs inside.
GRACE
(SOFTENING)
You can never truly be with her.
Jake stops, pinioned by the truth.
He seems suddenly very
lost.
JAKE
You know why I'm here? Because Quaritch
sent me.
NORM
What?
84.
JAKE
That's right -- to embed with the
Omaticaya. To find out how to screw them
out of their home. By deceit or by
force, he didn't care. And if it turned
out to be force, then how best to do it.
Norm is in shock.
But Grace is eerily calm.
GRACE
And what about now, Jake?
JAKE
I'm not that guy any more.
Grace nods.
She's been on his journey every step of the way.
GRACE
I know.
JAKE
But if I tell Quaritch the truth, he
yanks me out -- I never see her again.
And if I tell her the truth, the clan
throws me out -- that's if they don't cut
my heart out and show it to me.
Jake looks hopelessly at the two of them.
In his own perfect
Hell.
NORM
They won't understand what you've done.
JAKE
They don't even have a word for "lie" --
they had to learn it from us.
Grace sees he is on the verge of tears.
Lost and alone,
between worlds.
GRACE
I know. I taught it to them.
JAKE
(PLEADING)
Grace. I've gotta go.
They're waiting.
NORM
Link is ready.
Grace stops him as he tries to close the lid.
85.
GRACE
Jake. You can't carry this burden much
longer.
JAKE
(smiling wanly)
It's okay. Mo'at says an alien mind
probably can't survive the Dream Hunt
anyway.
Grace closes the lid. It feels like closing a coffin. She
watches his psionic patterns aligning to his avatar,
somewhere out in the night.
GRACE
(to Norm)
Prep my link. I'm going in.
CUT TO:
JAKE SITS, eyes closed, as Neytiri and another young hunter
paint his face and body in preparation for uniltaron -- the
Dream Hunt.
NEYTIRI
When your Spirit Animal comes, you will
know.
Their eyes meet with emotion neither can conceal any longer.
TIME CUT. GRACE stands with the crowd at the ramp to
HOMETREE'S LOWEST LEVEL. Jake barely sees her as he goes down
the spiral. She tries to follow, but is barred by a hunter.
BELOW, seemingly in the womb of the earth, Jake walks slowly
into the center of a tight circle of seated elders and
hunters. An ELDER is slowly rapping a large WATER DRUM.
TIME CUT -- MO'AT purifies him with smoke from burning herbs,
CHANTING in a low monotone. Jake, squatting, washes the
smoke over himself with his palms.
MACRO - MO'AT'S FINGERS unwrap a piece of wood riddled with
holes. She catches the end of a glowing purple WORM, and
draws it out of the wood.
MO'AT
(SUBTITLED)
Oh wise worm, eater of the Sacred Tree --
bless this worthy Hunter with a true
vision.
86.
MO'AT places the worm on Jake's out-stretched TONGUE. It
twists on itself, lighting his mouth before he closes it. She
indicates he should chew. He does.
MACRO -- AN EARTHEN JAR is opened. EYTUKAN removes a
writhing black ARACHNOID, the Pandoran equivalent of a
scorpion.
He places it against the back of Jake's neck and presses. The
insect drives its stinger into Jake's skin and --
Jake grimaces. Mo'at and Eytukan step back, leaving Jake
alone in the circle.
Neytiri watches intently, joining in the low chant.
SLOW DOLLY IN on Jake. His eyes OPEN. He looks around at the
faces -- they seem to TRANSFORM, becoming threatening.
Jake looks down at the palms of his hands.
JAKE'S POV -- his hands recede, his whole body, the ground
and --
INSTANTLY the circle of Na'vi recedes, as if to a distant
horizon, leaving vast ground in between. SPACE is utterly
distorted, and SOUND as well -- echoing, THUNDEROUS.
ECU JAKE -- pupils DILATED black. He looks around and --
The onlookers are gone, replaced by a ring of glowing trees,
which seem miles high. The whole image is bathed in spectral
radiance. Jake looks down --
JAKE'S POV -- his body and hands transforming -- fingers
stretching into tendrils, legs becoming roots which spread
outward across the ground, a thousand glowing dendrites which
connect to the roots of the trees and --
CUT TO REALITY -- Jake is on his hands and knees, PUKING in
the dirt. He contorts, crying out in agony as the venom
contracts his muscles but --
IN HIS VISION Jake stands serene on a FLOATING MOUNTAIN
CLIFF. A GREAT BLACK SHADOW covers him, the unmistakable X
silhouette of a diving LEONOPTERYX. The LAST SHADOW.
CAMERA SCREAMS down on him as the shadow grows larger -- WE
RUSH into his face, into the blackness of his pupil which
FILLS THE UNIVERSE and --
87.
REAL JAKE writhes in the dirt, his back arched as his muscles
seize. He foams and thrashes, his eyes rolled back in his
head, while inside --
TIME ITSELF HAS ACCELERATED -- clouds scream around the
mountain tops, mist boils through the forest. He feels the
wind of time blowing through him as --
REAL JAKE claws the ground, moaning, staring blindly while --
INSIDE, IN POV he FLIES over the landscape of Pandora --
--but the forest is BLASTED. Fires flicker among trees that
are BURNED black and lifeless in a smoky twilight.
A great WINGED SHADOW is cast below, rippling over the
devastated ground. AVATAR JAKE looks down at the shadow.
Realizes HE is casting it, and we RUSH IN to his PUPIL and --
PULL BACK from the eye of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX, flying lordly
and terrible over the land. It lets out an almighty SHRIEK
which seems to echo to eternity and --
SLAM CUT to Jake, on his back, GASPING -- back in his body.
He weakly rolls up to one elbow and looks around the room.
MO'AT
It is finished.
Neytiri's face is flooded with relief.
The faces of the clan
elders look at Jake expectantly.
EYTUKAN
(SUBTITLED)
Did your Spirit Animal come?
Jake looks from Eytukan to Mo'at, Tsu'tey and the elders. How
can he tell them what he has seen?
Mo'at puts her splayed fingers against his face, seeming to
peer into his troubled soul.
MO'AT
(to Jake)
Something has come.
(to the others, subtitled)
It will take time for the meaning to be
clear.
She steps back, and Eytukan motions for Jake to stand. He
gets up, weakly.
88.
OUTSIDE THE ENCLOSURE -- Eytukan emerges with Jake and the
others. The entire clan is gathered, waiting to hear what
has happened. Jake looks up at the Leonopteryx Skull Totem,
which seems to stare down at him.
GRACE watches, her eyes brimming. Proud. Relieved. Amazed.
Eytukan places both hands on Jake's chest and holds them
there.
EYTUKAN
(SUBTITLED)
You are now a son of the Omaticaya.
You
are part of the People.
All the members of the clan press forward, crowding around
and putting their hands on Jake's shoulders, back, chest --
hands upon hands, until he is connected to everyone.
DISSOLVE TO:
Jake's eyes open in the darkness. He just lies there,
thinking. In his coffin. In another world.
CUT TO:
HUMAN JAKE is in a hurry to get back to the link. GRACE,
still groggy, chases him with coffee and microwaved eggs.
GRACE
Here -- eat this. I'd hate to have to
force-feed a cripple.
She slams the lid shut before he can enter and sticks the
plate under his nose.
GRACE
(GRINNING)
She's not going anywhere.
He sighs heavily and starts wolfing the eggs.
Jake adjusts himself in the link chair. He hands Grace the
empty plate.
GRACE
And when was the last time you took a
shower? Jesus, Marine.
Jake pushes her hands away and pulls the lid down.
CLOSE ON MONITOR -- Jake shouts but there's no sound feed.
WIDER as the TRACTOR OPERATOR sees him and pulls back on the
remote throttles. He yells to his SUPERVISOR.
OPERATOR
Hey, I got one of the natives blockin' my
blade here.
This attracts the attention of Selfridge, who comes over to
the workstation.
ON THE SCREEN -- Jake, in his Omaticaya loincloth and
ceremonial body paint, is unrecognizable.
SUPERVISOR
(to Selfridge)
What do we do?
SELFRIDGE
Roll on. He'll move. These people have
to learn that we don't stop.
TIGHT ON THROTTLES as the operator pushes them forward.
ON THE SCREEN Jake stumbles back, tripping, disappears below
the blade for a second -- reappears, running to the side.
CLOSE ON MONITOR -- as Jake's demonic face is replaced by
noise.
OPERATOR
I'm blind.
He pulls back on the throttles.
94.
MINUTES LATER, the operator is playing back the CAMERA'S FEED
for Quaritch and the others.
QUARITCH
Freeze it, right -- there.
ON MONITOR -- the image expands, until Jake's face is clear,
frozen in an animal snarl.
SELFRIDGE
Son of a bitch!
PUSH IN ON QUARITCH as his jaw clenches in cold fury.
He turns and strides toward the door, shouting to his WATCH
COMMANDER as he passes.
QUARITCH
Get me a pilot!
CUT TO:
A RAIDING PARTY of hunters, their bodies painted, raise
weapons overhead. AVATAR GRACE watches with growing alarm.
95.
EYTUKAN
(SUBTITLED)
Tsu'tey will lead the war party!
Tsu'tey steps forward, face full of hate, raising a war cry
among the hunters.
GRACE
(SUBTITLED)
Please -- this will only make it worse --
TSU'TEY
You do not speak here!
JAKE and NEYTIRI cross the commons toward them. Jake feels
all eyes turn toward him. He takes her arm, stopping her.
JAKE
(to Neytiri, low)
Okay, listen. There's something I have to
tell you. It's gonna be hard. I just
need you to --
He sees TSU'TEY striding toward them, his face a mask of
fury.
TSU'TEY
You!
Tsu'tey walks right up and SLAMS Jake in the chest with both
hands. It is so unexpected, that Jake topples on his ass.
TSU'TEY
You mated with this woman?!
GRACE
Oh shit.
Jake stands. He reaches out for Neytiri.
She goes to him,
clutching his hand.
MO'AT
Is this true?
NEYTIRI
(SUBTITLED)
We are mated before Eywa. It is done.
Tsu'tey turns to Mo'at and Eytukan, his face anguished.
96.
TSU'TEY
(SUBTITLED)
Neytiri was promised to me! Everything is
changing. Everything is being destroyed!
Tsu'tey points at Jake, his pain shifting to rage.
TSU'TEY
(SUBTITLED)
These aliens kill everything they touch,
like poison.
MO'AT
Neytiri! If you choose this path, you can
never be Tsahik. Your life will be
wasted.
Neytiri looks at her mother -- sees the grief in her eyes.
NEYTIRI
I have chosen.
Tsu'tey draws his knife and --
TSU'TEY
Yeeeeeaaa!
LUNGES AT JAKE, who's ready this time -- he sidesteps,
blocking the knife, and elbows Tsu'tey HARD in the face.
Tsu'tey reels back, nose bleeding. He starts forward on a
second attack but --
Eytukan grabs his arm and spins him around.
EYTUKAN
(SUBTITLED)
Stop! This is not a proper challenge.
Tsu'tey glares at Jake while sheathing his knife.
TSU'TEY
I challenge you.
GRACE
Jake, don't --
JAKE
I accept.
CUT TO:
97.
QUARITCH rides left seat as Trudy pilots through the
mountains. She glances at him, then toggles the aircom.
TRUDY
Loveshack this is Samson One Six inbound
hot to your pos. I have Colonel Quaritch
with me and --
But Quaritch SLAMS the switch, cutting her off.
QUARITCH
Did I tell you to announce us?
TRUDY
Sorry sir, it's procedure.
Norm punches buttons on the comms console.
NORM
Samson One Six?
Trudy?
(no answer)
Crap.
He looks helplessly at Jake and Grace's link units -- no way
to warn them.
TSU'TEY AND JAKE square off. Each holds a long, solid staff.
The entire clan crowds around them in a circle.
GRACE
What the hell are you doing?
JAKE
It's the only way to get him to goddamn
listen.
TSU'TEY LEAPS at Jake with a sharp cry and Jake parries with
his staff. The staves CLACK off each other as the two
combatants LEAP, DUCK and STRIKE furiously.
Tsu'tey sweeps Jake off his feet with a roundhouse hit to the
ankles, but --
Jake ROLLS out of it and catches Tsu'tey in the belly with
the blunt end.
98.
TSU'TEY wades in with a series of short, sharp blows. Jake
swings with equal fury. Both fighting from the heart.
The staves whistle through the air, and CLACK together like
gunshots. Jake presses hard, and Tsu'tey staggers back,
stumbling as --
Jake lands a SOLID HIT, dropping him to his knees, just as --
THE INNER DOOR bangs open and QUARITCH stomps toward Grace's
Link controls.
NORM
Hey, hang on, you can't interrupt a link
in progress, it's dangerous -- wait!
Quaritch shoves him aside and SMACKS his fist down on the
POWER switch. Grace's unit goes dead and --
AVATAR GRACE'S eyes roll back and she keels over.
NEYTIRI
barely catches her before she hits the ground.
JAKE parries as Tsu'tey swings but then --
Jake's eyes go blank just as -- K-RACK! Tsu'tey puts one
alongside his head. Jake sprawls, completely inert. Tsu'tey
pokes him with his staff, then raises it and lets out a
piercing VICTORY CRY.
JAKE SLAMS OPEN the Link, amped from the fight, furious --
JAKE
Are you out of your goddamn mind?!
QUARITCH
You crossed a line.
Quaritch PUNCHES HIM HARD. Jake flops back, dazed. The
troopers yank him out and ZIP-TIE his wrists.
99.
TSU'TEY draws his KNIFE, and bends down, grabbing Jake by the
hair.
TSU'TEY
(SUBTITLED)
This is a demon in a false body. It
should not live.
He puts his knife to Jake's throat but --
NEYTIRI BLIND-SIDES him at full tilt. Tsu'tey sprawls, rolls,
comes up to see --
Neytiri crouched like a lioness over Jake, her KNIFE and
teeth bared, her ears flattened. She SNARLS with primal
fury.
Tsu'tey stands panting. He pushes through the crowd and walks
away, calling for his hunters.
CUT TO:
TIGHT ON MONITOR -- showing JAKE'S AVATAR FACE on the dozer
camera, as he pounds a rock into the lens. The shot FREEZES
on Jake's ANIMAL SNARL.
WIDER -- HUMAN JAKE sits, bruised and bleeding, watching
himself on the monitor. GRACE and NORM stand nearby, rubbing
their wrists where the zip-ties bit in. SELFRIDGE and
QUARITCH watch with disdain.
QUARITCH
You let me down, son. You got a little
local pussy and completely forgot what
team you play for.
Jake meets his gaze with a defiant glare.
GRACE
Parker, listen, there may still be time
to --
QUARITCH
Shut your fucking hole!
Grace is momentarily stunned by Quaritch's fury. But she
meets it with her own intensity, not backing down an inch.
100.
GRACE
Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot
me?
(to Selfridge)
You need to muzzle your dog!
SELFRIDGE
Can we just take this down a couple
notches, please.
JAKE
(to Quaritch)
You say you want to keep your people
alive. Start by listening to her.
Jake nods to Grace to continue.
GRACE
(to Selfridge)
This is bad, Parker. Those trees were
sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you
can't imagine.
SELFRIDGE
You know what? You throw a stick in the
air around here it falls on some sacred
fern.
GRACE
I'm not talking about pagan voodoo here --
I'm talking about something real and
measurable in the biology of the forest.
SELFRIDGE
(FRUSTRATED)
Which is what exactly?
Grace's nerve fails. A rush of conflicting emotions -- the
need to act, to do something, colliding with her scientific
rigor.
GRACE
(to Jake)
I can't do this. How am I supposed to
reduce years of work to a sound bite for
the illiterate?
JAKE
Just tell him what you know in your
heart.
She turns to Parker, steeling herself.
101.
GRACE
Alright, look -- I don't have the answers
yet, I'm just now starting to even frame
the questions. What we think we know --
is that there's some kind of
electrochemical communication between the
roots of the trees. Like the synapses
between neurons. Each tree has ten to the
fourth connections to the trees around
it, and there are ten to the twelfth
trees on Pandora --
SELFRIDGE
That's a lot I'm guessing.
GRACE
That's more connections than the human
brain. You get it? It's a network -- a
global network. And the Na'vi can access
it -- they can upload and download data --
memories -- at sites like the one you
destroyed.
SELFRIDGE
What the hell have you people been
smoking out there? They're just.
Goddamn. Trees.
GRACE
You need to wake up, Parker. The wealth
of this world isn't in the ground -- it's
all around us. The Na'vi know that, and
they're fighting to defend it. If you
want to share this world with them, you
need to understand them.
QUARITCH
We understand them just fine.
Thanks to
Jake here.
Jake shares a look of alarm with Grace as Quaritch selects a
NEW CLIP on the main monitor --
TIGHT ON MONITOR -- VIDEO-LOG IMAGE of Jake, looking haggard
and borderline deranged, rambling in a late-night monologue.
JAKE (RECORDED)
They're not going to give up their home --
they're not gonna make a deal. For what?
Lite beer and shopping channel? There's
nothing we have that they want. We're a
horror to them. We're the monsters from
space.
102.
JAKE watches with a growing dread as his words condemn the
people he has grown to love.
JAKE (RECORDED)
They're never going to leave Hometree.
Quaritch FREEZES the recording.
QUARITCH
Since a deal can't be made -- it gets
real simple.
(to Jake, icily)
So thanks. I'm getting all emotional.
I
might just give you a big wet kiss.
GRACE
Parker, we have to talk, like rational
people.
SELFRIDGE
Well, I'd cherish that, but unfortunately
you're out of here on the next shuttle.
All of you. I'm shutting down the Avatar
Program, effective now.
ON JAKE, GRACE AND NORM, speechless.
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
A WALL OF FIRE. Silhouettes of direhorse riders cross in SLOW
MOTION, spears and bows held high.
MONITOR SCREEN IMAGE -- WAINFLEET pans a camera across the
smoldering hulks of BURNED DOZERS. The toppled remains of a
charred ampsuit. Dead troopers bristling with arrows.
WAINFLEET
They hit with banshees first. Set the
ampsuit on fire. Driver's toast.
Quaritch and Selfridge look on grimly.
QUARITCH
The rest of the squad?
WAINFLEET
Six bodies -- that's all of `em. And the
equipment is totalled.
SELFRIDGE
Christ.
103.
Selfridge is stares soberly as Quaritch outlines the plan.
QUARITCH
I can do it with minimal casualties to
the indigenous. We'll clear them out
with gas first. It'll be humane. More or
less.
Selfridge sighs and rubs his face.
QUARITCH
Hey, don't go limp on me now. This is
exactly the incident we needed.
SELFRIDGE
Alright, let's pull the trigger.
CUT TO:
MAX and the lab staff are glumly packing files and equipment,
under the watchful eye of armed SEC-OPS TROOPERS. JAKE,
GRACE, NORM stare bleakly at each other.
GRACE
They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose,
to trigger a response. They're
fabricating this war to get what they
want.
NORM
I can't believe that.
JAKE
Yup. That's how it's done. When people
are sitting on shit you want, you make
them your enemy. Then you're justified in
taking it.
TRUDY RUNS into the lab, breathless. She's wearing full
flight gear and carrying her helmet.
TRUDY
Sec-ops is rolling the gunships.
They're
gonna hit Hometree!
JAKE
When?
TRUDY
Now.
We're spooling up now! I gotta go.
104.
GRACE
My God.
Jake pumps furiously toward the door, Grace following.
SELFRIDGE surveys the airfield, where crews swarm over the
gunships, loading ordnance. He turns as JAKE and GRACE
charge toward him.
GRACE
Parker, wait. Stop! These are people
you're about to --
SELFRIDGE
They're fly-bitten savages who live in a
tree! Look around -- I don't know about
you but I see a lot of trees. They can
move.
GRACE
For God's sake, there are children in
there. Babies!
JAKE
Look Selfridge, you don't want this kind
of blood on your hands. Let me try to
talk them out. They trust me.
ON SELFRIDGE, considering this.
CUT TO:
SELFRIDGE and an escort of armed TROOPERS accompany Jake and
Grace to the links. The two enter their units, as NORM and
MAX prep the system.
SELFRIDGE
You've got one hour. Unless you want
your girlfriend in there when the axe
comes down, you get them to evacuate. One
hour.
Jake lowers the upper clamshell. Norm starts the sequence.
CUT TO:
The entire clan is gathered, with Eytukan and Mo'at
presiding. Jake looks around, feeling the gaze of the People
upon him. He steels himself, and speaks in clear Na'vi --
105.
JAKE
(SUBTITLED)
Eytukan, I have something to say, to
everyone.
EYTUKAN
(SUBTITLED)
Speak, Jakesully.
JAKE
(SUBTITLED)
A great evil is upon us. The Sky People
are coming to destroy Hometree. They
will be here soon.
A murmur of fear and anger goes through the crowd.
JAKE
(SUBTITLED)
You have to leave, or you will die.
MO'AT
Are you certain of this?
JAKE
They sent me here to learn your ways. So
one day I could bring this message, and
you would believe it.
NEYTIRI
What are you saying, Jake? You knew this
would happen?
He is unable to meet her eyes.
JAKE
Yes.
(ANGUISHED)
At first it was just orders. Then
everything changed. I fell in love--
with the forest, with the Omaticaya
People --
(he looks at her)
-- with you. And by then, how could I
tell you?
Neytiri can barely breathe. She is shaking with the enormity
of it, her voice cracking with rage and pain --
NEYTIRI
I trusted you, Jake!
106.
JAKE
Neytiri. Please, I only wanted to --
NEYTIRI
You will never be one of the People!
NEVER!
TSU'TEY yells to his HUNTERS --
TSUTEY
(SUBTITLED)
Bind them.
They grab Jake, who doesn't resist. Others seize Grace.
Both are driven to their knees, and their arms bound.
CUT TO:
SELFRIDGE watches a video feed of the destruction on one of
the monitors. Max and NORM stare in shock.
SELFRIDGE
Pull the plug.
A TROOPER crosses to the console and grabs the handle of the
MASTER BREAKER --
BLACKNESS. Then the top clamshell of Jake's unit is yanked
upward, and troopers grab him, zip-tie his wrists as we --
CUT TO:
Jake, Grace, and Norm are in a common holding cell. They
sit, staring in silence. Too wired to sleep, too emotionally
drained to move.
GRACE
They never wanted us to succeed.
AT THE DESK OUTSIDE, the lone TROOPER looks up as --
TRUDY approaches along the corridor, pushing a stainless
steel trolley.
TRUDY
Personally I think steak's too good for
these traitors.
GUARD
They get steak?
That's bullshit. Let me
see that --
The guard bends to look into the hot cart and
--
THE MUZZLE of Trudy's pistol presses behind his ear.
112.
TRUDY
Oops.
(shoving him down)
All the way down, pendejo.
She WHISTLES and MAX trots around the corner.
Trudy binds the guard with one of his own zip-ties as Max
grabs his KEY CARD and runs to the cell. Swipes the card.
The door is rolling open when --
ANOTHER TROOPER rounds the corner. Trudy takes him down with
a sharp BLOW to the windpipe and a THAI KNEE to the ribs.
Meanwhile the first TROOPER is getting up, but Max CLOCKS him
heartily with a coffee urn. He goes down and stays down.
MAX
That was unexpectedly satisfying.
Trudy plants a kiss on Norm as he runs out of the cell.
NORM
Baby, you rock.
Jake wheels out, grabbing the sidearm from the fallen trooper
as Trudy binds his wrists.
JAKE
(to Max and Trudy)
Thanks.
Jake faces his motley group, chambering a round.
JAKE
So what do you say?
Time for a
revolution?
GRACE
I'm free.
Trudy grins and taps his fist.
JAKE
Come on.
CUT TO:
In the utility corridor under the base, Jake pumps the chair
furiously, as the others jog. They reach an AIRLOCK and start
donning EXOPACKS.
113.
JAKE
(to Trudy)
Get your ship fired up.
Trudy nods. She grabs Norm and enters the airlock.
Jake
turns to Max.
JAKE
Stay here. I need somebody on the inside
I can trust.
Max nods.
Jake grips his hand tightly.
CUT TO:
QUARITCH, watching a monitor, sees what's happening down at
the airfield. He slams his palm down on an ALARM BUTTON.
He draws his PISTOL.
Strides toward the EMERGENCY DOOR. He
undogs it.
Outside the windows, clouds and cliffs pass by, lit by
Polyphemus.
Jake is yanking stuff out of the Samson's trauma bag, while
Grace lies curled across two back seats, hugging her blood-
soaked abdomen. She is pale and shocky.
Trudy is flying on visual only, by the light of Polyphemus.
Her instruments are showing gibberish.
TRUDY
Well, at least they won't be able to
track us up here. Not this deep in the
vortex.
JAKE
It's strongest at the Well of Souls,
right?
TRUDY
Yeah.
JAKE
Good, `cause that's where we're going.
TRUDY
Copy.
He gives Grace an ampule of morphine for the pain.
JAKE
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.
GRACE
Forget it, it doesn't matter.
Jake grabs her shoulders.
JAKE
No!
The People can help you. I know it.
CUT TO:
Grace lies, comatose, in her open link. Trudy gives Jake a
look that says "not much time." Jake feels Grace's cold
forehead, then crosses to his own link.
As Trudy helps him in, Norm rapidly preps the system.
NORM
(LOW)
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyctan now. He's not
going to let you get near that place.
JAKE
I've gotta try, Norm.
117.
Jake pulls the clamshell down and we --
CUT TO:
It's standing room only as all base personnel are crowded
into the dining hall. A portable 3D GRAPHICS PROJECTOR has
been set up, and the lights are down. QUARITCH stands in
front of the display image -- a classic pre-mission briefing.
QUARITCH
People, you are fighting for survival.
There's an aboriginal horde out there
massing for an attack. First slide.
124.
The display shows an overhead image of the Well of Souls.
It
looks like Woodstock in the jungle.
QUARITCH
These orbital images show the hostiles'
numbers have gone from a couple of
hundred to over two thousand in one day,
and more are pouring in. By next week it
could be twenty thousand. Then they'll be
overrunning our perimeter here. We can't
wait. Our only security lies in pre-
emptive attack. We will fight terror
with terror.
TRACKING ACROSS the grim faces of the miners and troopers.
Fear transforming to hatred in their eyes.
QUARITCH
Next slide. This mountain stronghold is
supposedly protected by their deity.
When we destroy it, we will blast a
crater in their racial memory so deep
they won't come within a thousand klicks
of this place.
CUT TO:
TROOPERS issue automatic weapons and magazines to a long line
of mine workers. The miners lock and load like the red-
blooded redneck NRA supporters they are.
BLASTING TECHS are setting radio-detonated primer charges
into two-ton stacks of EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND. The stacks are
band-strapped together on pallets.
TRACKING WITH SELFRIDGE, staring around him in growing dismay
as he walks through the full-scale mobilization.
He approaches Quaritch, who is barking orders amid a hive of
activity around the ampsuits.
SELFRIDGE
This thing is completely out of control!
Quaritch ignores him, turning away to focus on ordnance
loading.
SELFRIDGE
Listen to me! I am not authorizing you to
turn the mine-workers local into a
freakin' militia!
125.
QUARITCH
I declared threat condition red. That
puts all on-world assets under my
command.
SELFRIDGE
You think you can pull this palace coup
shit on me?! I can have your ass with
one call --
Quaritch grabs him and PINS him against the side of an
ampsuit.
QUARITCH
You're a long way from Earth.
Selfridge is paralyzed. Physical force -- against him?
Quaritch releases him and walks away.
QUARITCH
(to his men)
Get him out of here.
Several troopers converge on Selfridge.
SELFRIDGE
You touch me you're so fired.
He pushes through them and they escort him toward the door.
CUT TO:
HUMAN JAKE, NORM and TRUDY are gathered around the comms
monitor, talking to MAX.
MAX
I don't know how secure this channel is.
JAKE
Talk fast.
MAX
It's crazy here, Jake. It's full
mobilization. They're rigging the
shuttles as bombers. They've made up
these big pallets of mine explosives.
It's for some kind of shock and awe
campaign.
TRUDY
Frickin' daisycutters.
126.
NORM
Holy shit.
JAKE
(to Max)
Can you talk to Selfridge? Maybe we can
cut some kinda deal before this thing
goes all the way.
MAX
No, Quaritch has taken over. He's
rolling and there's no stopping him.
JAKE
When?
MAX
Oh six hundred tomorrow.
Jake takes that in.
JAKE
Thanks.
Max signs off.
NORM
We're screwed.
TRUDY
You know he's gonna commit those bombers
straight to the Well of Souls.
JAKE
That's right. Because I gave it to him
on a plate.
TRUDY
We both did.
NORM
If he takes out the Well of Souls -- it's
over. It's their main line to Eywa, to
their ancestors -- it'll destroy them.
JAKE
Then I guess we better stop him.
Jake looks like he's about to collapse.
He's gaunt, eyes
deeply shadowed, hands shaking.
TRUDY
You need to get some rack.
127.
He grabs a packet of freeze-dried crystals and pours them
directly into his mouth, chewing them up.
JAKE
Gonna have to settle for coffee.
CUT TO:
The top of Norm's LINK bangs open. He reels out, collapsing
onto the floor, clutching himself as if he can still feel the
pain of death.
He sits, huddled, shivering -- crazed.
Max runs down the hall, leading the other scientists.
He's
yelling into an AIRCOM HANDSET --
139.
MAX
Rogue One, Rogue One, this is Max.
Tell
Jake we are in motion.
(to the scientists)
Get in there. Barricade the door!
The door is hurled open and the SCIENTISTS charge in.
Science geeks barricade the door as AVATAR-DRIVERS scramble
into their link units, pulling the clamshells down.
Max checks the door is secure from his side then runs down a
connecting corridor.
CUT TO:
Techs and troopers crowd around consoles, listening to all
the yelling and confusion as they try to plot the
disintegrating battle.
SELFRIDGE
(in growing alarm)
What the hell is going on out there?
CUT TO:
The pilot listens to comms from Hell's Gate.
PILOT
Sir, all ground units are falling back to
the LZ.
Quaritch's jaw clenches.
QUARITCH
Stay on target.
Quaritch sets the target cursor on the MOTHER TREE and what
we recognize is the ghostly figure of Mo'at.
QUARITCH
Switch missiles. Arm all pods.
142.
PILOT
Arming.
QUARITCH
Let's see what these blue bastards do
when I bitch-slap their goddess.
ON THE PLOTTING DISPLAY as Quaritch's TRANSPONDER ICON
disappears.
TROOPER
Dragon is down. It's off the board.
SELFRIDGE
What do you mean, off the board?!
Selfridge is stunned.
Suddenly the ROAR of an ENGINE makes
them all look up.
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW, MAX sits in the cab of an enormous SLASH-
CUTTER. Max flips Selfridge the bird and pushes a lever
forward --
SELFRIDGE
Oh shit.
Selfridge DIVES as --
K-RASHHHHH! The SPINNING TEETH of the SLASH-CUTTER tear
through the window in a blast of glass and lethal air. Alarms
go off. The technicians dive for cover in a blizzard of
glass and shredded debris.
The slash-cutter head pulls back, and AVATARS SCRAMBLE
through the gaping hole into the Ops Center --
The TROOPERS look up to see blue giants aiming weapons down
at them. The battle is over in seconds. The avatars are
holding the Ops Center.
Selfridge lies there gasping, in his emergency mask.
In
shock. How could this be happening?
CUT TO:
HUMAN JAKE EXPLODES out of the Link, slamming to the floor
where he gags for breath. With his last strength, he claws
toward an emergency breathing mask -- across the room.
He scrambles toward it, on the edge of unconsciousness.
NEYTIRI VAULTS through the shattered window, landing in the
debris like a cat. She GRABS the mask and flashes to Jake's
side -- puts the mask over his face and --
148.
JAKE drags in breath after breath. He looks up at Neytiri,
studying him as she holds him -- seeing his human body for
the first time.
Jake touches her face, his pale human hand against the blue
of her skin. There eyes meet across the glass of the mask --
together, separate. Worldless.
CUT TO:
VIDEO IMAGE -- Jake sits in a chair, talking straight TO
CAMERA. He is thin, pale. He looks around the high tech room.
JAKE
The science guys will keep the lights on,
here. But I won't miss this place.
