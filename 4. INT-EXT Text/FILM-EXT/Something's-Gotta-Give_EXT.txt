MIDTOWN. A Brunette Beauty crosses in front of a stack of
cabs, her sheer dress clinging to her remarkable body.
A Club in THE MEATPACKING DISTRICT. A long line waits to get
in. A couple of Gorgeous Girls show up at the velvet rope and
are promptly" let inside.
SOHO. A Crowd spills out of a Bar and onto the sidewalk. A
Confident Knock Out in jeans and a tank top laughs, drinking
a beer out of the bottle.
HARRY (V.O.)
Ahhhh... The sweet, uncomplicated
satisfaction of The Younger Woman. That
fleeting age when everything just falls
right into place. It's magic time and it
can render any man, anywhere --
absolutely helpless. Some say I'm an
expert on The Younger Woman. Guess that's
'cause I've been dating them for over
forty years...
INTO AN EMPTY FRAME COMES HARRY LANGER
What is it about him? Could be his eyes, the turn of his
mouth...something about this guy is just so damn appealing.
Maybe it's just the way he wears the Young Slinky Girl on his
arm. He's confident, cool, enviable. We're in:
A CHIC EATERY - DOWNTOWN
The place is full. Everybody is somebody here.
HARRY
(to Hostess)
Langer. ..
The Maitre'd snaps to attention at the sight of him.
MAITRE'D
Mr. Langer, got your table waiting.
As Harry and his Girl wend their way around tables, we pass Other
Couples. Young Couples. Middle-aged couples. Not talking Couples.
HARRY (V.O.)
So what does a life of bucking the system
all add up to?
2.
HARRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
To never settle down with the right woman
for a life of leftovers and Christmas
mornings. No his and her IRA accounts, no
mini van parked in the garage. I think
it's made me what I am today.
(Harry smiles to someone
across the room)
The luckiest son of a bitch on earth.
Look at me. I'm positively debonair. I
should be illegal I'm lookin' so good.
Harry passes a table where a BEATEN SIXTY YEAR OLD dines with
his AGE APPROPRIATE, WELL-FED WIFE. IN SLOW MOTION, Harry and
The Beaten Man catch each other's glance.
HARRY (V.O.)
It isn't as if I haven't wondered what my
life would be like if I was a Regular Joe
and came in here once a month with a dame
my age' for a porterhouse and a side of
I
spinach. I've wondered...
NT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION
Harry ENTERS all over again. This time he looks older,
something in his walk and the boxy cut of his jacket. With
him is a regular looking, nothing-to-write-home-about WOMAN
IN HER FIFTIES.
HARRY (V.O.)
No, come on, let's be honest. ..a dame
really my age. . .
Harry is wheeled out in a wheelchair, Marin and a Nurse on
either side. In the parking lot is a Town Car with Lowell and
the Girls standing next to it. Next to them is Erica, waiting
by her car. She's on her cell phone. Harry spots them and
tries to get out of the wheel chair before it stops.
NURSE
Hold on Tarzan, we're still movin' ...
(she stops)
Okay, now slow-ly.
To prove her wrong, Harry rises quickly. Everyone stands by,
ready to help.
HARRY
Look at these faces. Will you tell them
I'm fine.
As soon as Harry spots Erica, he starts to wobble.
ERICA
Whoa! Whoa! WHOA!
Everyone grabs for Harry as he FALLS OUT OF FRAME AND THE
SCREEN GOES BLACK.
CLOSE ON JULIAN
taking Harry's pulse as Harry lies on the ASPHALT OF THE
HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. Lowell, the Two Assistants and Marin
huddle around. Erica steps back a bit.
JULIAN
Harry, I'm sorry, but I think we jumped the
gun.. .can't let you travel quite yet.
HARRY
I ain't goin' back in there.
JULIAN
You don't have to but I can't put you in
a car right now and I can't leave you in
the parking lot. I'd like you to stay
nearby for a few days and let me keep an
eye on you 'til you get your strength
back.
37.
HARRY
Doc, I'm out in the middle of the
Hamptons. Where do you want me to go?
Marin turns to Erica who very clearly mouths, "FORGET IT!"
The Town Car sits in the driveway, Lexi leans on the hood,
talking on her cell. A Market Delivery Van pulls away as a
Drugstore Delivery Van pulls in. A Flower Delivery KID
holding a large bouquet, knocks at the front door.
I
NT. THE GUEST BEDROOM - SAME TIME
Harry sits up in bed wearing silk pajamas, holding an unlit
cigar, and is on the phone.
Zoe enters, placing the new bouquet on the already flower
filled dresser. Lowell lifts a LUNCH TRAY off the bed as Kim
stands nearby on the cell phone. Marin packs her bag.
HARRY
(into phone)
Just promise me you won't make a decision until
we talk. Thinking about it ain't promising me.
Okay, man, I'm seein' you Friday...
(hangs up, then to Lowell)
Lowell, what was that?
LOWELL
(looking down at the Tray)
Your lunch.
HARRY
Somebody tell you to starve me to death?
Kim hands Harry the cell phone.
KIM
Russell.
HARRY
(into phone)
Rush? No, man, you're livin' the shit.
I just got a clean bill of health.
Kim hands Harry a NOTE that says:
YOU HAVE TWO DINNER DATES THIS WEEK,
SHOULD I CANCEL AND SEND FLOWERS?
38.
Harry steals a look at Marin, then nods to Kim.
No cars are out front. Quiet and peaceful. On the Soundtrack
we hear the French tune, I wish You Love sung in French.
WIDE SHOT - ALMOST NIGHT
Erica and Harry sit not so close together at a long table,
under a purple sky. Another French Tune plays. If this wasn't
them, this would look romantic.
N
othing is said. Just two people eating. Harry lifts the salt
shaker, about to add salt to his chicken.
43.
ERICA
Should I just call the ambulance now?
Harry shoots her a look and places the salt shaker back on the
table.
A starry sky gives the house a storybook setting. We HEAR THE
PHONE RING.
A very wide MIDDLE AGED NURSE gruffly crosses thru the room
toward the Front Door. Just as she opens the door, Erica
ENTERS in hat, sunglasses, turtleneck, long skirt. Pretty
much no skin is showing whatsoever. She carries a few
packages.
NURSE
Good bye Mrs. Barry.
47.
ERICA
Good bye? You're leaving? That's
not good.
NURSE
Been fired.
ERICA
Fired?
You just started.
HARRY
Not fired darlin'. Just not needed.
Erica hardly looks at You Know Who who appears to be fresh
out of the shower, wet hair, silk robe, bare chest and legs.
ERICA
What do you mean, not needed? Of
course we need her. She's gonna
take care of you and feed you and...
HARRY
-- No, no, I'm actually feeling
pretty perky today. Making quite a
recovery. . .
(opening the screen door)
Sorry for the trouble Mrs.
Gimble... Take care, dear.
Harry hands her a wad of bills like she's a Maitre'd. Mrs.
Gimble gives Erica a look of pity as she exits. Erica, now
alone with Harry, self-consciously adjusts her sunglasses.
Harry, on the other hand, slips his hand onto his bare chest,
pats it.
HARRY
Listen, about last night.
ERICA
Yeah. How 'bout we never talk about that?
(hands him some pills)
I was at the drugstore. Your
prescriptions were ready. They said take
these two with food and this one without.
HARRY
Honestly, you were in silhouette.
ERICA
I think that's talkin' about it.
HARRY
I really didn't see all that much.
48.
ERICA
(heading toward her room)
Yip. There you go.
HARRY
Okay. Won't mention it again but...
ERICA
(almost out of the room)
Goin' to work, Harry.
HARRY
(yells)
You saw my ass, you don't see me
acting nuts, wearing hats and
glasses and weird get ups...
The Sound of a DOOR SLAM. - Harry flinches.
Erica and Harry walk by the water's edge. They are the only
two people on the beach.
HARRY
-- Did you know there are over eight
thousand websites that mention you?
ERICA
That can't be possible.
HARRY
No, it's true. I know everything
about you now. And not because of
last night, but...
E
RICA
Yeah, I understood. I actually
looked you up too. You grew up in
L.A., which I thought nobody did.
54.
ERICA (CONT'D)
You were the road manager for a group I
sorta never heard of, started your own
record label at 29, sold it at 45, then
started buying and selling boutique
companies then invested in a small record
company which you turned into the 2nd
largest Hip Hop label in the world.
HARRY
It's exhausting just hearing about it.
ERICA
I know, but the truth is, it goes
fast doesn't it?
HARRY
Like the blink of an eye.
Erica bends down and picks up A FLAT WHITE STONE, then
another and another...
HARRY
I noticed you have bowls of those
all over your house.
ERICA
I know, I'm crazy, I just think
they're so beautiful...
HARRY
But why do you only pick up the white
ones?
ERICA
I don't only pick up the white ones.
HARRY
Oh, so you really are crazy.
ERICA
I pick up only the white ones?
(looks in her hand)
Oh, God, what does that mean? I'm
controlling, unadventurous, what?
HARRY
So you're as hard on yourself as
you are on everyone else.
Erica is stunned that he caught on to that. Harry bends down,
picks up a BROWN stone, places it in her palm among the white
stones.
HARRY
Something to remember me by.
55.
Erica realizes she can't sum this guy up so easily or at all.
ERICA
So can I ask you something Harry? What's
with all the young girls? I mean, what's
the story there, really?
HARRY
I just like to travel light.
ERICA
You just like to travel light? Oh,
please, what the hell does that mean?
HARRY
Now see a thirty year old gets that.
ERICA
You mean falls for that.
HARRY
I mean, accepts it.
ERICA
If that's what you want... a non
threatening woman, who won't get your
number, you get to run the show...
HARRY
I think our relationship is growing
by the way. Have you noticed?
There he goes again. She can't believe he's cute like this.
HARRY
I'm serious. Maybe we just needed to get
out of the house. Now, you may notice,
interestingly, we're walking back toward
the house and its getting a little rocky
again.
ERICA
Of course it's getting a little
rocky, we're talking about you.
HARRY
See, I'll accept that slight
hostility because I'm enjoying your
company so much.
T
hey're reached the bottom of the beach stairs. Harry looks
up, daunted.
ERICA
You okay?
56.
HARRY
Yeah, but I think I'11 stay down here and
watch the sunset. You interested?
Erica checks her watch.
HARRY
Big dinner date?
ERICA
Well, yeah, as a matter of fact.
With your doctor.
HARRY
Ohhhhh, my doctor, 'cause he's not
too young for you, huh?
ERICA
No, he's totally too young for me.
But we're just having dinner. It's
not a date.
HARRY
Does he know that?
ERICA
Well, I'll tell him, but I doubt
that he thinks of it that way.
HARRY
I doubt that you doubt that. Anyway, you
may like it. Think of it this way -- he's
not threatening, won't get your number,
you get to run the show. You might have a
hell of a time.
Over, we HEAR, DING DONG.
THAT NIGHT - THE FRONT DOOR - SWINGS OPEN
And we find Julian. Looking just as any girl would hope.
Dream Date.
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR
is Harry, in his robe and PJ's.
JULIAN
Hey, look who's answering the door.
HARRY
And look who's at the door.
JULIAN
Brought you something.
57.
Julian hands him a take-out food box.
JULIAN
A heart healthy dinner from our
cafeteria.
ERICA (O.S.)
Hello...
Both guys turn at once. She looks beautiful, wearing a dress,
probably the sexiest one she owns. No turtleneck tonight.
Julian walks to her, kisses her on the cheek.
JULIAN
You look beautiful.
ERICA
Thank you.
Behind Julian's back Harry gives Erica the 'OK' sign.
ERICA
(thrown)
We ready..?
JULIAN
Let me just see how Harry's doing.
It'll take two seconds. Har, have a
seat. .
ANGLE - HARRY
sitting, self-conscious in his new role - The Sick One.
Julian takes his wrist, feels his pulse. Harry looks straight
ahead.
WHAT HE SEES - ERICA'S LEGS
as she sits right in front of him. She crosses her legs and
her dress hikes up a little, exposing her thigh.
JULIAN furrows his brow.
HARRY
What? That's not the face you want
to see your doctor making.
JULIAN
Your pulse is a little fast but
maybe you're just excited about
something.
Harry LOOKS AT ERICA'S LEGS again.
58.
HARRY
(quickly)
I don't think so. I'm not excited
about anything.
Erica shifts, the hem of her skirt RISING even higher.
JULIAN
There it goes again. Racing.
HARRY
Doc... Impossible!
Erica rises, leaving Harry's eye-line.
JULIAN
Oh, there we go, now I feel better.
Back to normal.
Harry winces then rises, looks to Erica as she throws a
pashmina over her shoulders in SLOW MOTION. Harry rushes them
OUT THE DOOR.
HARRY
Okay, all right, good, have fun, don't
rush back for me and don't do anything I
wouldn't do.
ERICA
Well that wouldn't leave us too
many options would it?
HARRY
And do we wonder how she writes
that snappy repartee.
(whispers to Erica)
Let him pick up the check. It'll
make him feel older.
On Erica's shocked expression, the DOOR SLAMS.
The rain is coming down in torrents.
INSIDE
We are CLOSE ON ERICA'S FACE - UPSIDE DOWN, hanging off the
side of the bed. She's sweaty, flushed, overwhelmed...
75.
ERICA
Oh my God, I do like sex.
CAMERA TWIRLS AROUND and we FIND HARRY, sprawled nearby,
catching his breath, satisfied, stunned, scared.
HARRY
You certainly do.
Erica arrives next to him, also out of breath.
ERICA
Wow. So this is what you're supposed to
do on a rainy afternoon...
Harry smiles. He's trying to be his debonair self but
something's off. He's very aware of himself. They lie there
quietly for a second when Erica begins to tear up. Harry
slowly, nervously turns to her.
ERICA
I really thought I was sorta closed for
business. Just never expected this.
HARRY
(nods)
Nothin's ever surprised me more...
Flattered, Erica snuggles up close. Harry puts his arm around
her. Then, with no warning, his eyes fill with tears.
HARRY
This is crazy. I can't remember the last
time I cried. I think I'm overwhelmed.
ERICA
(crying with him)
Me too. That's the perfect word.
HARRY
Baby, I had sex three days after a heart
attack and I didn't die!
Erica pauses. Oh. That kind of overwhelmed.
HARRY
That's gotta be some kind of record.
Good sport Erica gives him a double thumbs up.
ERICA
(wiping her tears)
Let's not brag about this to our
doctor, okay?
76.
HARRY
Honey I may not be many things but one -
thing I am is a gentleman.
Harry holds her close.
HARRY
Erica, Erica, Erica.
(she turns to him)
You know I'm not good at being
monogamous, right?
ERICA
Monogamous? Please, I hardly know
you.
He looks at her wondering if she's for real. She smiles as
she wipes a small tear from the corner of her eye. Then he
kisses her.
LATER - THEY'RE HUDDLED UNDER THE COVERS
C
ozy. Candles light the room. It's still raining.
HARRY
-- So there I was at nineteen, in New
York, by myself, and I'd never seen snow
before and I didn't have enough money for
the bus, so I had to walk. Had no idea
how far it was and I'm talking blizzard
and I'm in sneakers.
ERICA
Awwwww,. . .
LATER - THEY'RE LYING ON A CHAISE
in Erica's room, making out. A Cell Phone RINGS. They both
look around for it. Erica reaches for it on her desk.
ERICA
(disoriented)
Hello? I mean...Hello.
(turns phone upside down)
Hello.
INTERCUT WITH MARIN IN A TAXI IN THE CITY - IT'S POURING
MARIN
Mom, you guys okay out there?
ERICA
We're fine. Why? What's going on?
77.
MARIN
What do you mean, it's like a
hurricane. The news said the winds
are like a zillion miles an hour.
ERICA
Oh, that. Oh, no, we're fine...
MARIN
Are you having sex? Tell the truth.
You are, aren't you.
ERICA
Absolutely not. No. That is not
going on now.
MARIN
Oh my God, you already did it. Was
it amazing?
ERICA
I have to go.
MARIN
Just tell me, was it amazing?
ERICA
Yes and thank you for the wonderful
opportunity.
Marin SCREAMMMMMMMMMMMS. Erica flips the phone shut, looks to
Harry, embarassed.
ERICA
(to Harry)
Am I interested in buying aluminum
siding. . .
HARRY
Really? Marin's selling aluminum siding?
Erica buries her face in his chest.
LATER
Harry and Erica SIT ON STOOLS AT THE KITCHEN ISLAND, drinking
wine and eating scrambled eggs right out of the pan. Candles
light the room.
HARRY
--But why Paris?
ERICA
I just always wanted to write a play that
ended there.
78.
ERICA (CONT'D)
People need romance like that. And if
someone like me doesn't write it, where
they gonna get it? Real life?
HARRY
(slightly insulted)
Excuse me. What do you call this? Eating
eggs by candlelight in our robes after...
She kisses him, starts to say, "I'm sorry" when he pulls her
back, kisses her again, then looks at her hard, perplexed.
CLIMBING BACK UNDER THE COVERS
HARRY
So where do you like to eat in
Paris?
E
RICA
Oh, I love this place called Le Balzar,
it's just a little bistro on the Left
Bank, best roast chicken in the universe.
HARRY
You'd be fun to go to Paris with.
ERICA
It's a great city to stay up all
night in.
(then)
When's your birthday?
HARRY
February.
ERICA
Mine's in January. So, how 'bout if we
still know each other by then we go to
Paris for our birthdays.
HARRY
(a beat, then)
Maybe. . .
ERICA
Oh. Sorry. You just...
(sees the look on his
face) .
I have no idea how to do this...be
intimate but not...The color is draining
from your face. Okay, look, I'm gonna
pee,take one of your blood pressure pills
then when I get back, let's not talk
anymore.
79.
She gets out of bed.
HARRY
You're the funniest girl I ever had
sex with.
She has no idea how to take that. Decides to accept it.
ERICA
That's somethin'...
HARRY
Honey... ?
She turns, sees he's getting out of bed, approaching her.
HARRY
I think I'm gonna go back to my
room...let you sleep.
ERICA
Let me sleep? Oh, right...you usually
send the girls home. . .but I am home...
so...okay.
HARRY
I'm an old dog, you' know.
ERICA
Hey, it's perfectly. .. whatever.
Good night. This was..This was a
great night. For me...
HARRY
Me too. At one point I even thought
soul mates, you know...
Erica nods. She knows.
HARRY FLOPS ONTO HIS BED
stares straight up at the ceiling.
The place is a mess, the aftermath of the storm.
HNT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - THE SAME TIME
arry spoons with Erica on her side of 'the bed, his arms
snuggly around her. The ELECTRICITY POPS BAGK ON and the room
is suddenly lit up and one of Erica's French CDs comes on
full blast.
Harry opens his eyes. He's surprised to see he has his arm
around her. Erica awakens just as surprised. In the light of
day, a definite hint of embarrassment ...
HARRY
(grabs his watch, blinks)
Can you see this?
ERICA
Not really but it looks like it
says eleven.
HARRY
(slips on his glasses)
It is eleven...
ERICA
It can't be, that would mean we
slept eight hours.
HARRY
Impossible.
They turn and finally look at each other. Both look wrinkled,
messy haired, a little wiped.
HARRY
How ya doin' Ace?
(she ,elts as he lies
right back down)
Whoa Nelly...little dizzy.
ERICA
Okay, just stay still, here's the
clicker. You know you have a
doctor's appointmQnt in an hour.
(getting out of bed)
(MORE )
81.
ERICA (CONT'D)
I'll make us some coffee, get you your
pills, whip us up some french toast, I
have ,the best maple syrup ever. '
HARRY
Erica...
(she turns)
You are a woman to love.
Erica smiles, then walks away with the achey walk of a woman
who hasn't had sex in many a year but has more than made up
for it in the last 12 hours. She holds onto the wall as she
exits the room, a little bow-legged, like she's just gotten
off a horse. Alone in the hallway, she stops.
ERICA
You are woman to love. What the
hell does that mean?
AN EKG MACHINE
Spits out a long tape. TILT UP to Julian at the end of the
tape. Harry sits on an examining table in JULIAN'S OFFICE,
buttoning up his shirt.
JULIAN
Okay, buddy, I'm sending you home. These
past few days have done wonders for you.
HARRY
Yeah, I've been working on that stair
thing. I can do it by the way.
J
ULIAN
Do what?
HARRY
(quickly)
Climb a flight of stairs. Several times
actually.
Harry stands, tucks in his shirt, smiling proudly to himself.
JULIAN
Way to go. How's Erica?
HARRY
(caught)
Erica?
JULIAN
I know you must know her name by
now.
82.
HARRY
Yes, I do. Erica, as it turns out
is an amazing woman. Does whatever
she can to make me happy. Really.
Turns out she's very giving.
Julian, suddenly riveted to these words.
HARRY
Very giving.
JULIAN
(looking away)
Yeah, well that's wonderful. I
think she's wonderful.
A real moment between them. Julian decides to take the high
road.
HARRY
I think she's wonderful too.
JULIAN
(gathering his things)
Give her my best...
HARRY
Julian. Thanks for everything.
Julian shakes Harry's hand. Harry's eyes TEAR UP.
JULIAN
You're gonna be okay.
HARRY
(touching his tears)
What the...? This is the second
time I've done this now. I get
overcome or something. . .
JULIAN
It's very common to become emotional
after having an episode like you've had.
Everything takes on a new meaning.
HARRY
(wiping his tears)
So it's not crazy for a man to do
something entirely out of character
after having a heart attack?
JULIAN
(handing him Kleenex)
Like crying?
83.
HARRY
Yeah and totally changing their
tastes. Like suddenly really liking
something they never thought they
could like...ever...and I'm talking
really liking it. It's...unnerving.
JULIAN
I think you can expect just about
anything right now. People have done some
wild things after having a heart
attack...selling businesses, getting
divorced, moving... Some people say it
saved their lives.
HARRY
But most people go back to being
themselves, right? I'll go back to
being me, won't I?
J
ULIAN
We'll see.
ERICA - TYPING - HER PHONE RINGS
She wears a blouse with more buttons unbuttoned than ever in
her life. She picks up the phone.
HARRY DRIVES ERICA'S CAR, TOP DOWN.
HARRY
(on his cell)
Hi.
ERICA
Hey.
What'd he say?
HARRY
He said you're wonderful.
ERICA
No, really, what'd he say...How are you?
HARRY
He said I'm good..that I can go.
. ERICA
(obviously conflicted)
Oh. So... Congratulations. That's really.
. . great.
HARRY
Yeah, he said... by tomorrow for absolute
sure. You think you can deal with me for
one more night?
84.
A CROWDED CLUB - SOUTHAMPTON - THAT NIGHT
Packed with Young People. In the middle of this twentysomething
sun burnt beach crowd, we find, Erica and Harry, the two coolest
people in the room, dancing with each other.
A LITTLE 'LATER - THE KARAOKE ROOM
Harry leads Erica through a crowd listening to a Girl singing
Britney Spears' Oops, I Did It Again. When she finishes the
crowd enthusiastically applauds.
HARRY
(big breath)
Okay, here goes...
ERICA
Here goes what?
HARRY
Here goes me singing to you...
(pulling a DISC out of his
pocket)
Bought my own music.
ERICA
You knew they had karaoke?
HARRY
Baby, it's why we're here. .
Harry makes his way TO THE STAGE, hands them his disc. He's
handed a microphone. He looks right at Erica.
HARRY
This is for you, Ace...
(then, under his breath)
wish me luck.
The Music begins and it is an instrumental version of one of
Erica's French Songs, "I Wish You Love".
HARRY
(sings)
I wish you bluebirds in the spring... To
Give your heart a song to sing... And
then a kiss, but more than this... I wish
H
you love...
arry takes out a sheet of paper and his glasses.
HARRY
Don't want to blow this part...
Now Harry sings the rest of the song IN FRENCH. . .
85.
-.
HARRY
(sings)
Et en juillet une limonade...Pour
vous refroidir dans quelque lefy
glade...
And so on... Erica watches knowing something in her life has
just that second, forever changed. And as Harry continues
singing, we:
CUT TO:
LOWELL - THE NEXT DAY
Packing the Trunk of the Town Car in front of Erica's house.
Camera quickly TRACKS Erica down the front path and to her
car. She's on her cell.
88.
ERICA
Hold on, I'm losing you. Okay,
so you'll
let Harry know I'll be. in the
city
tonight and he can reach me on
my
cell...if he wants... Okay? Aw
shit.
Hello?
A Crowd files in for tonight's auction.
Erica rushes out. She's a little high and her heart is
pounding. She heads down the street.
ERICA
Oh, God, I'm so stupid...
She picks up her pace, starts running. Her cell phone RINGS.
ERICA
Hello?
Intercut Harry and Erica on their cells, a block apart.
HARRY
(walking quickly)
Slow down. You want to kill me?
She considers it.
ERICA
Harry, I gotta go...
HARRY
Erica, she's just a friend.
ERICA
Yeah, she looks like a buddy kind
of a girl.
Erica reaches a corner, can't get across, turns the corner.
Harry ARRIVES NEXT TO HER.
HARRY
Come on, it's just a dinner...
ERICA
Look, Harry, here's the problem. I
really like you.
HARRY
I really like you.
ERICA
Yeah, but I love you like you.
(that stops him)
I do. I love you.
Harry swoons and not in a good way.
HARRY
I think maybe you should consider
that you're in love with the idea
of being in love.
95.
ERICA
D
o you? Okay. Oh, God...
(stomps her feet)
I'm like the dumb girl who doesn't get it.
(tries not to cry in front
of him)
I've never been the dumb girl
before. It ain't so great.
HARRY
Let's just calm down. This was just
a a meal with a friend.
ERICA
-- Did you know I called you seven
hours ago?
HARRY
I was gonna call you. I've been jamming
all day, it's my first day back.
ERICA
Uh-huh. . .
HARRY
I had these plans before I met you. But I
do like seeing you. I do. I'm always
surprised by it.
ERICA
What was I thinking?
HARRY
Maybe you weren't thinking for once and
look what a good time we had. Let's not
ruin something great.
ERICA
Harry, I won't be good at this.
HARRY
At what?
ERICA
Acting like I don't care.
HARRY
I have never lied to you. I have always
told you some version of the truth.
ERICA
(freaking on that one)
The truth doesn't have versions.
96.
HARRY
Can you cut me a little slack? My
life's been turned upside down.
ERICA
Yeah. Mine too.
HARRY
Then let's each get our bearings.
ERICA
I don't want my bearings. I've had my
bearings my whole fucking life. I felt
something with you that... Oh, you don't
want to-
HARRY
Yes I do.
(she won't open up)
Tell me.
ERICA
I felt something with you, I didn't know
really existed. You know what that's like
after a twenty year marriage? To feel
something for another person that's so
off the charts, that -
(Harry looks down)
Okay, not your problem. This is why
I'm not good in relationships. You
know writers are like teachers,
those who can - do, those who can't
- write romantic comedies where
THIS does not happen in the third
act...and it certainly does not
happen to a 55 year old woman. In
the play I'll be 36 so it won't be
as pathetic. I'm just too old to
feel crushed.I've written this
feeling but I never really got it.
(realizes)
You know what this is?
(pointing to herself)
This is heart broken. How's that
for impervious?
HARRY
You're killin' me.
ERICA
I just wish it had lasted more than a
week.
HARRY
Me too.
97.
ERICA
That's a horrible thing to say.
(walks off, comes back)
The life I had before I met you. I
knew how to do that, could do that
forever. Now look at me...what do I
do with all this?
HARRY
Can we talk tomorrow?
ERICA
What for? I saw your friend you were
having dinner with, if that's what you
want, it's never going to work with me.
Look at me. I'm a middle aged woman,
don't let this brown hair fool you, I
don't have a real brown hair on my head,
I'm almost all grey...that would freak
you out, wouldn't it? And I have. high
cholesterol and my back hurts every
morning and I'm post menopausal and I
have osteoperosis and I'm sure arthritis
is just around the corner and I know
you've seen my vericose veins. Let's face
it man, that's not quite the buzz you're
lookin' for.
A TAXI pulls up.
ERICA
And you know what? Everyday, I'm
gettin' older. ..just like you.
Erica opens the back door of the Taxi.
HARRY
Wait.
Erica turns.
This is his chance.
HARRY
I just... the truth is... I don't
know how to be a boyfriend.
ERICA
That's what you have to say after all
this? You don't know how to be a
boyfriend.
HARRY
That's not a small thing.
They're both out of words.
98.
ERICA
Are we done?
HARRY
I don't know.
She nods. He doesn't give. She ducks into the CAB and it
PULLS AWAY. Harry stands on the street, watching her go.
HARRY
(winces)
Ouch.
He grabs his heart.
HARRY
Oh, God...
HARRY - ON A GURNEY
wheeled through the Emergency Room of Beth Israel Hospital.
This is not the Hamptons. This place is crawling with
patients. Harry's delivered to a Latina Doctor in her
thirties, DR. MARTINEZ. As he's taken off the gurney, he's
immediately hooked up to a heart monitor, given oxygen and an
IV.
NURSE
Came in by cab, 15 minutes of chest
pain, no nauseau, some shortness of
breath, was hospitalized a week ago
with a coronary thrombosis.
DR. MARTINEZ
Hang a nitro drip.
HARRY
You can't. I took Viagra.
DR. MARTIINEZ
You have been through this before.
Give him 5 mgs of Metoprolol. You
h~ving chest pain right now?
H
ARRY
No, and the pain I was having was
sharp, not like before.
. DR. MARTINEZ
That's good. Not like before is we
like to hear.
(reads EKG)
Give him aspirin.
99.
DR. MARTINEZ (CONT'D)
Based
on what I see so far, your
heart
is not in distress but I'm
gonna
do a rapid enzyme test to be
sure.
What were you doing at the
onset
of the pain?
HARRY
Having a fight with someone. A woman. Can
a woman give you chest pain?
DR. MARTINEZ
Are you kidding? Love hurts, haven't you
heard?
HARRY
Yeah, but so far, I've only given pain, I
never got any.
DR. MARTINEZ
(confused at how literal
he is)
All right, well you're battin' a thousand
here. Your enzymes look perfect, your
EKG is normal and the pain doesn't sound
like the kind of pain we worry about. I
think what you experienced was normal
chest pain associated with stress.
HARRY
Stress?
DR. MARTINEZ
And incase you haven't heard, that can
give you a heart attack. Mr. Langer, I
donlt know what you're up to gallivanting
out and about at this hour, but if you
were my Dad, I'd make sure you were home,
in bed, recuperating.
Erica and Zoe are taking a walk. Erica, still crying, picks
up a brown stone, explains its meaning to Zoe. Zoe holds the
stone, makes an `awwww' face.Erica nods, then Zoe tosses the
stone in the ocean, fed up with hearing about him already.
Then, Zoe stops Erica, points to something.
MARIN AND HER NEW BOYFRIEND
frolicking on the beach. He's a YOUNG HUNK in a tank top,
shorts, highlighted hair. Erica rolls her eyes.
Marin rushes down the stairs. Erica sits near the bottom of
the stairs, watching the sunset.
MARIN
Mom, we're going into town...
Erica turns, wiping tears.
104.
MARIN
Are you crying?
(joining her)
I didn't know you did that.
ERICA
Yeah, it's my new thing. I've
gotten abnormally great at it.
MARIN
(sitting on the step with
her)
Is it Harry?
ERICA
Seems I gotta learn how to do that
love 'em and leave 'em stuff.
MARIN
Fucking men. You don't care when I
say fuck, do you?
ERICA
Not really. Sometimes. Not right
now.
MARIN
So now you get my theory about
love? You gotta self protect. It's
too dangerous.
ERICA
Marin, that theory... how can I put
this so your feelings won't get
hurt. It's just so crazy, it makes
me want to SCREAMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!
MARIN
And how would you put it if you
wanted to hurt my feelings?
ERICA
Listen to me... you cannot hide
from love for the rest of your life
because maybe it won't work out and
maybe you'll become unglued. That's
not a way to live.
MARIN
So you're telling me you're happy
right now? This is good what
happened to you?
105.
ERICA
No. This was bad. But for the three days
it was good, it was electrifying.
Marin's eyes fill up.
ERICA
I think you must consider the possibility
that we are more alike than you realize.
I let someone in and I had the time of my
life.
MARIN
(tearful)
I've never had the time of my life.
ERICA
I know. And bubbee, I say this from
the deepest part of my heart. . ...
what the fuck are you waiting "for?
Zoe is picking corn, when she notices Julian across the way.
He glances up, looks right past her, obviously doesn't
remember her, keeps on shopping. Zoe thinks for a see,
wondering how she can get his attention when he looks right
back at her, his face full of hope.
Harry FLIES OUT the Stage Door, right into the street, is
almost hit by a motorcycle, doesn't seem to care.
Harry walks briskly through the park, still pissed, his pace
starting to get to him. He spots a bench with a WOMAN JOGGER
at one end. He parks himself at the other end of the bench,
out of breath. Tries H reason with himself.
to
ARRY
God is a woman, I know that now. No
man would punish me like this.
WOMAN JOGGER
You never change, do you?
Surprised, Harry turns, glances over at the Woman. She drinks
from a water bottle then offers him an easy warm smile. She's
adorable, mid-sixties, short grey hair.
HARRY
Do you know me or are you just talking to
me as "man" in general, the beast women
love to hate.
WOMAN JOGGER
No, no, I know you Harry.
HARRY
Oh. Don't tell me. I dated your daughter.
(the Woman laughs)
Right? I broke her heart then she married
some hard working Joe on the rebound, has
three great kids. What is so funny?
113.
WOMAN JOGGER
You dated me and you broke my heart but
after you I met the right guy. I've been
married thirty-seven years, have four
kids, eight grandkids and a ninth on the
way.
Harry now fully turns in her direction, totally clueless.
HARRY
I dated you. .?
(the Woman nods)
Did we. ever...?
WOMAN JOGGER
No...we did not.
He looks at her hard but still doesn't remember her.
HARRY
Can you give me hint? A year? A
decade?
WOMAN JOGGER
The sixties.
(Harry squints at her)
You took me to Shea Stadium.
HARRY
To a Mets game?
I must've really
liked you.
WOMAN JOGGER
You took me to see The Beatles.
HARRY
Oh, God, I really liked you. You're
Sandra. ..Cook. We did. We saw The
Beatles together. How the hell have
you been? What happened to you?
SANDRA
Well, let's see, after we stopped
going out, I went back to school,
got my doctorate in marine biology,
went around the world a few times,
met the man of my dreams at Oxford,
married him, we lived in London for
25 years. I wrote and taught, we
raised 3 sons and a daughter. I've
just finished my ninth book and now
I'm training for my first marathon.
Now, I must confess, I actually
remember the very last thing you
ever said to me.
114.
SANDRA(cont'd)
You walked me to my door, I was
tearful and you looked at me with
those puppy dog eyes and said,
"Honey, I just don't know how to be
a boyfriend." Now, tell me, what
have you been up to since 1964?
OVER Harry's face, we HEAR the SOUND of a SIREN BLARING.
Harry lies on a chaise under a palm tree, drink in hand, Hawaiian
shirt, shades. A steel drum plays in the distance.
121.
,
HARRY (V.O.
I was there about ,six hours, when it
occurred to me that wasting away on an
island in the Caribbean wasn't going to
remotely cure what was ailing me.
Harry sits straight up into CAMERA.
BLACK SCREEN
A LIGHT POPS ON and we realize we are in HARRY'S CLOSET.
HARRY (V.O.)
So I decided to take another kind of
pilgrimage...into my past.
Harry ENTERS THE CLOSET, reaches onto a top shelf ,and starts
pulling down dozens of what used be called, "Little Black Books".
HARRY (V.O.)
My thought was -- if I retraced my steps
and visited all the women I've dated...
He blows dust off of the books.
BACK IN PARIS
HARRY
-- maybe I could figure out how I
got so screwed up.
FLASHBACK - HARRY'S PILGRIMAGE
Harry STANDS at one FRONT DOOR after the NEXT, EACH ONE
SLAMMING IN HIS FACE.
HARRY (V.O.)
A lot of the women wouldn't see me.
Then, we see WOMEN of various ages SLAP HIM ACROSS THE FACE.
HARRY (V.O.)
Or speak to me.
Harry reels backwards from one Hefty Mama.
HARRY (V.O.)
But I was on a mission to save my
soul.
,
A Woman In Her Fifties, purposively walks down a SMALL TOWN
MAIN STREET carrying groceries.
122.
Harry, at her side, keeps talking at her, even though she
picks up her pace and ignores him.
HARRY (V.O.)
My losing streak finally ended when
I got one to open up to me.
In a HOSPITAL ROOM, an Older Woman on life support, scrawls
out a note and shows it to Harry who sits in a chair by
herside. A Priest stands in the background. The note says,
"As I remember it, you were wildly insensitive". Harry lowers
his head in shame. She places another note in front of him.
It says, "I forgive you." Relieved, he smiles. Then, one last
note: "Now, scram."
HARRY (V.O.)
Hearing what they had to say was no
picnic.
In an Upper West Side COFFEE SHOP, Harry pas coffee
with a Woman in her Mid Forties. She talks his ear off.
Harry can' t deal with it. He looks away ~ The woman
places her hand on his chin and pulls him right back to
her and keeps talking at him.
H
ARRY (V .O.)
But I stuck it out and I listened.
Then I listened harder.
Harry WALKS down THE STREET with a ANOTHER WOMAN in her
Thirties, who carries a cello.
She never shuts up.
HARRY (V. O. )
And one of the things I realized
was, I was actually giving closure
to generations of women.
At the corner, the Woman hugs Harry goodbye.
HARRY (V. O. )
Although I admit, some refused to
give, no matter what I did. . .
CLOSE - DIANE SAWYER
On the set of GOOD MORNING AMERICA. She glances out the
STUDIO WINDOW and sees Harry ON THE STREET among the folks
holding signs. He HOLDS A SIGN that says, "DIANE, YOU WERE
RIGHT.
I WAS ENTIRELY WRONG.
I`M SORRY."
She looks him
straight in the eye and gives 'him the finger.
123.
HARRY - FULLY DRESSED - LYING ON HIS BED - TOP SHOT
HARRY (V. O. )
When you hear the same story about
yourself over and over, your life
begins to make sense and the future
becomes your only salvation.
Harry, with his collar turned up against the cold, walks past
the glass pyramid in front of The Louvre.
Harry walks over the bridge, the beauty surrounding him just
making it all worse. He stops, looks out at the Seine. He
hears a classic French song in the distance, then sees a
small barge, playing the music, pass beneath him. Without
warning, a tear falls from his eye.
HARRY
(laughs at himself)
At the end of the day, I'm nothin'
but a sap, a stupid old sap,
standing on a bridge in Paris,
crying my eyes out.
He stops, looks at the mighty city surrounding him. Beauty's
not supposed to hurt. Another tear.
HARRY
(almost amused)
Look who gets to be the girl.
He wipes his eyes on his coat sleeve as SNOW begins to fall.
HARRY
(looking toward heaven)
Anything else... .
ERICA'S VOICE
Harry?
Harry turns and sees Erica standing by a Cab with its motor
running, snow falling on her hair and coat.
HARRY
Where's Julian?
ERICA
He went back to the hotel.
HARRY
How come?
128.
ERICA
(walking to him)
He said when he saw me with you, he
knew I was still in love with you.
What do you have to say about that?
HARRY
If it's true, my life just got
made.
ERICA
Why'd you come here, Harry?
HARRY
Because I realized what I was feeling for
you, have always felt for you, was
something I didn't understand, like a
language I didn't speak...
(she listens...)
It scared me so I did what I do. I snuck
away. Turns out the heart attack was easy
to get over. You were somethin' else.
(she's starting to melt)
And when I went to see all those women, I
found out I was never really present for
any of them. And something inside me at
some point, had just...shut off. That's
when I think my heart gave out and you
saved me. I finally get what it's all
about. I'm 63 years old and I am in love
for the first time in my life. And that's
what I came here to say.
ERICA
Okay, this is the best birthday ever.
HARRY
I know I'm no spring chicken, I figure I
only got another 30-40 years in me. Tops.
But how 'bout we figure out a way to make
this work.
ERICA
Okay.
HARRY
Okay? Okay! I'll take it.
The Barge drifts back under the bridge, La Vie En Rose piping
out of it's tinny speakers.
HARRY
Honey, they're playing our song.
129.
She comes close and he pulls her in, kissing her great. And
as they separate, he smiles, relieved.
FADE OUT:
FADE IN:
