      OVERLAP: Fergie's "Glamorous"

      DEB'S PAINTED FINGERNAILS (all red but the one blue pinky),
      SPLAYED OUT TO DRY as she drives.  The Fergie CD blares. 
      She sips her bottled water.  Her cell rings.  She answers --

                                    DEB
                    You got Deb.

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:*


      HARP MUSIC PLAYS, FOG WAFTS, EVERYTHING IS WHITE.  CAMERA
      PANS FROM ROWS of COMPUTER TERMINALS TO an ELEVATOR BANK. 
      An ELEVATOR OPENS and OUT WALKS DEB, in a white robe.  She's
      confused, out-of-sorts.

      FRED, 20's, in a white oxford and slacks, approaches.  He's
      nerdy-cute with attitude.  Think Adam Brody meets Woody Allen.

                                    FRED
                    Ms. Dobkins, I'm Fred, your Gate
                    Keeper.  Apologies for your sudden
                    demise.  Follow me.

        A bewildered Deb follows Fred past several terminals, staffed
      with other gate keepers assisting the "dead," to his station.*

                                    FRED (CONT'D)
                    Have a seat. 

      Fred rounds his desk and turns his attention to the computer. 
      Deb composes herself, then, still standing --

                                    DEB*
                          (flirty)*
                    Look, Fred, I've got an audition for*
                    "The Price Is Right."*

                    My hair's camera ready, and I've*
                    been "fat flushing" for a week.  So*
                    do me a solid and "beam me back."*
                          (then, sotto)*
                    It's so dry up here -- is my*
                      foundation cakey?*

                                      FRED*
                    No one ever says "no" to you, do*
                    they?

                                    DEB*
                            (considers)*
                    I tried to French kiss Ed Wallus in*
                    sixth grade.  He said no, but he's a*
                    hair dresser now, so do the math --*

                                      FRED*
                    Stop talking.*

                                    DEB*
                    Right.  We're wasting time.  I need*
                    to get back.  Now.*
                          (pouting)*
                    Come on, Fred, you seem like a sweet*
                    guy.  Help me out --*

      Deb deliberately opens her robe, revealing a hint of cleavage.*

                                    FRED
                    Pouting may work on Earth, but up
                    here it's white noise. 
                          (re: cleavage)
                    And you may want to cover-up, there's
                    a draft.  Now, sit.

      Deb complies, but she's furious.  Fred types on his keyboard.

                                    DEB
                    What are you doing?

                                    FRED
                    Reviewing your life.

                                    DEB
                    Why?

                                    FRED
                          (like it's obvious)
                    Heaven or hell. 

                                    DEB
                    Sweetie, I'll save you the time.  If
                    I'm going anywhere, it's heaven.                                                                                      10.

                                    FRED
                    This isn't Les Deux.  You can't talk*
                    your way in -- 
                          (re: monitor)
                    Whoa, hold up.  I've never seen this
                    before.
                          (into a loud speaker)
                    I need a Supervisor at terminal 12. 
                    I've got a... zero-zero. 

                                    DEB
                    I hope you're talking about my dress
                    size.

                                    FRED
                    My records indicate you haven't done
                    a single good deed or bad act your*
                    entire life.  My first adult "zero,*
                    zero."*

                                    DEB
                          (offended)
                    I'm a good person.  Lots of deeds.

                                    FRED
                    I'm listening.

                                    DEB
                          (a beat, then)
                    I buy Girl Scout cookies every year. 
                    And I don't even eat white flour
                    carbs.

                                    FRED
                    You buy them for your sister so she'll
                    look fatter than you on the family
                    Christmas card....

                                    DEB
                    I give spare change to the homeless.

                                    FRED
                    Because coins looks lumpy in your
                    skinny jeans.
                          (then)
                    Ms. Dobkins, I see a lot of bad people
                    and you're not one of them.  But
                    you're not one of the good ones,
                    either.  Given our brief time*
                    together, I would conclude you're*
                    simply... shallow.*

                                    DEB
                      SHALLOW???  Who do you think you are
                    in that Dress-For-Less oxford shirt
                    and those pleated polyesterday slacks.

                                    DEB (CONT'D)
                    You're rude, and I won't just sit
                    here and take it.*

      Under this, Deb eyes a list of RULES printed on Fred's desk. 
      Her eyes fall on RULE #10: THE RETURN BUTTON SHALL NOT BE
      PRESSED WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION.

                                    FRED
                    What're you going to do about it?

                                    DEB
                    Let's find out.

      Deb eyes Fred's keyboard and sees the RETURN button.  Before*
      he can stop her, she reaches across his desk and presses it. *
      A clap of thunder and Deb is engulfed in WHITE LIGHT.  As*
      she disappears, a SUPERVISOR races over to Fred --*

                                      SUPERVISOR
                    What the hell is going on?

                                    FRED
                    My client, she pressed return.

                                      SUPERVISOR
                    Clients do not touch the computers.

                                    FRED
                    The woman had no boundaries.*

      Supervisor regards the data on Fred's computer --*

                                      SUPERVISOR
                    Her body is in a million pieces. 
                    She can't return to it.

                                    FRED
                    So what happens?

                                      SUPERVISOR
                    Her soul gets rerouted to the nearest*
                    available body.

      Supervisor eyes a WOMAN, in a white robe, sitting at another
      station.  IT'S JANE!  PUSH IN TIGHT and MATCH CUT TO:


      Jane enters through a window.  She takes in the room.  She
      spots Grayson's UCLA LAW t-shirt (from the Teaser) on the*
      bed.  She touches it.  Smells it.  Tears well up.  She crosses
      to her closet, organized by season, and selects a skirt.*

      She takes off the hospital gown and steps into the skirt. 
      RIP!  She grabs another.  Repeats.  RIP!  She starts to shake. 

      Out of options, she puts on Grayson's robe.  Then, she opens
      another closet to reveal hundreds of pairs of high-end women's
      shoes, which bring momentary comfort.  She grabs a pair of
      Gucci heels, hugs them tightly, and slips them on.  The phone
      RINGS.  She starts to grab it, but realizes she can't.  The
      machine answers.

                                      ANSWERING MACHINE
                    Hey, it's Deb... and Grayson, leave
                    your message at the -- BEEP.

                                      WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Grayson, it's Angie, Deb's sister. 
                    Calling to let you know...
                          (voice cracking)
                    The funeral is tomorrow at noon. 
                    The family's meeting at my place.  I
                    hope you'll join us.                                                                                      17.

      Jane hears the front door handle turn.  Quickly, she hides
      behind the bedroom door.  Through the crack, she watches --

      JANE'S POV -- Grayson enters.  He collapses on the sofa,
      cradling his head in his hands.  Devastated.  Only yards
      apart, but she can't reach out to him.  A tear rolls down
      her cheek.  Under the above, Jane has leaned on the back of
      a chair.  Suddenly, the chair CRACKS under her weight.  As
      Jane HITS the floor, the CRASH alerts Grayson.  Jane races
      for the window.  Wearing Grayson's robe and Guccis, she flees.

      Grayson enters to find the broken chair.  The window is open. 
      Off his confusion --


      Jane's behind the wheel of a Carrera convertible, top down. 
      She eyes herself in the rear view mirror and reacts -- her
        reflection's still jarring.  She pivots the mirror so she
      can't see herself.

      Car phone RINGS!  GPS SCREEN READS: TERI.  Jane's not sure
      how to answer.  She mistakenly turns on the stereo, Pavarotti
      blares.  AGH!  Seeing the phone icon, she presses it. 

                                    JANE
                          (shouts)
                    Hello, Teri!

      Jane dumps the personal effects into her Porsche.  WE CRANE*

                                          ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      We recognize this house from the Teaser.  It's Stacy's. 
      Jane, armed with the cat, knocks on the door.  The PEEK-A-
      BOO slot flies open so that Jane and Stacy are face to face.

                                      STACY
                    If you're selling Girl Scout cookies,
                    you're too old.  If you're selling
                    Avon, you forgot your face.  If you're
                    selling God, bless me and go.

      Stacy slams the slot closed.  Jane knocks again. 

                                    JANE
                    Stacy, it's me.  Deb.

      The peek-a-boo opens again.

                                      STACY
                    My best friend was a "Deb" and she*
                    died this morning.
                          (showing vulnerability)
                    So just leave me alone, okay?

                                    JANE
                    Stace, it's me.  I swear.  Please,
                    let me explain --

                                      STACY
                    Pork Chop, I'm calling the cops.

      As Stacy starts to close the slot, Jane thinks fast --

                                    JANE
                    I can prove it.  Senior year, John
                    Wahl gave you crabs.  Who else knows
                    that?

                                      STACY
                    He gave them to every cheerleader
                    and two guys on the wrestling team.

                                    JANE
                          (tries again)
                    When you were in your binge purge
                    phase, you ate your brother's 
                    birthday cake and blamed the dog.

                                      STACY
                    I told that to my shrink -- Dr. Loose
                    Lips.  Nice try.                                                                                      33.

      Stacy slams the slot.  Jane screams to her, rattling off --

                                    JANE
                    In tenth grade you got a nose job
                    but told everyone you were in France. 
                    You put Crazy Glue in Sue Bundy's
                    underwear for giving your boyfriend
                    a hand job during "Erin Brockovich." *
                    You were too nervous to buy yourself
                      a vibrator so I bought you "Boris*
                      Pecker"...*

      The slot opens again.  Jane is winning her over --

                                      STACY
                    Deb?

                                    JANE
                    You bleach your chin hairs because
                    plucking gives you hiccups.

      Stacy flings open the door.  She hugs Jane -- although she
      can't quite get her arms all they way around.  Off Stacy's
      expression, we HARD CUT TO:


      Parker works at his computer.  Jane enters wearing a black
      Lane Bryant skirt suit.

                                    JANE
                    Teri said you wanted to see me.

                                      PARKER
                    You're four hours late.                                                                                      36.

                                    JANE
                    I slept in.
                          (off Parker's surprise)
                    What do you need?

                                      PARKER
                    I spoke with Mr. Wellner's counsel. 
                    He's agreed to pay five hundred grand*
                    to his wife.  We have a deal.

                                    JANE
                    I told Vicky I'd get her half.

                                      PARKER
                    They know she won't testify.  Unless
                    she's changed her mind, take it.

                                    JANE
                    Can I go?

                                      PARKER
                          (shifts gears)
                    Kim says Marcus Newsom insists you*
                    take first chair.  But I'm concerned. *
                    I heard about your amnesia and you*
                    seem a little off. *

      Before Jane can respond, Parker gets buzzed by his assistant.

                                      PARKER'S ASSISTANT (V.O.)
                    Charles Campbell on line one.

                                      PARKER
                    I've got to take this.  Jane, if
                    you're suffering from post-traumatic
                        whatever-you-call-it, get some help. 

      Parker picks up the phone, turns away from Jane.

                                      PARKER (CONT'D)
                    Chuck, how's St. Bart...?

      With his hand, Parker dismisses Jane.  Jane exits.


      Grayson, tears in his eyes, delivers a eulogy to Deb's family
      and friends, including Stacy.  He stands beside an easel
      with a large PHOTO OF DEB, looking angelic while sitting on
      a swing.  Jane stands in the back row, behind TWO MODELS,
      AMY and BETH.

                                      GRAYSON
                    ... People say there are five stages*
                    of grief -- denial, anger, bargaining,
                      depression, and acceptance.  Well, I
                    can't get past my anger.  Deb was so
                    young, so full of life and love... 
                    Standing here today, I can't help
                    but remember Deb's first words to
                    me, "Are you seriously trying to
                    pull off acid wash jeans?" 
                          (muted chuckles)
                      Seriously, she changed my life.  She
                    gave me something to look forward to
                    at the end of each day.  Someone to
                    laugh with.  Someone to laugh at. 
                    Next week, we were going to celebrate
                    our one year anniversary of living
                    together.  I was planning to propose.

      Jane reacts.  Grayson begins to break down.  He tries to
      compose himself, swallows hard and takes a deep breath.

                                      GRAYSON (CONT'D)
                    Deb taught me to listen to my heart. 
                    And right now, Deb, my heart hurts.

      As Grayson continues, we RACK FOCUS to Amy and Beth.  Jane
      overhears them -

                                    BETH
                    Deb taught me patterned leggings
                    make my legs look fat.  You?

                                    AMY
                    Never mix two seasons in one outfit.

                                    BETH
                    The world is a sadder place.

      Jane's cell rings, the Jeopardy Jingle.  All heads turn. 
      Stacy, the only attendee not in black, sees Jane and excitedly
      waves.  Embarrassed, Jane answers quietly.  It's Teri.                                                                                      40.

                                    JANE
                          (sotto)
                    What?

                                    TERI (O.S.)
                    Where are you?

                                    JANE
                    Hold on.

      Jane returns her attention to Grayson, who continues  --

                                      GRAYSON
                    ... A lot of people just saw Deb as*
                    one of God's beautiful creatures...

                                    TERI (O.S.)
                    You're due in court in five minutes.

                                    JANE
                    I'm not going.

                                    TERI (O.S.)
                    What's with you?  You can't do this*
                    to Mr. Newsom. 

      Jane focuses on Grayson. 

                                      GRAYSON
                    But she was so much more.  She was
                    kind and sweet and unselfish...

      Amy takes issue with "unselfish."  Jane overhears --

                                    AMY
                    I loved her like a sorority sister,
                    but did he just say "unselfish"?

                                    BETH
                    She did give me a ride when I had my*
                    boobs done.*

                                    AMY
                    That's only 'cause she had the hots*
                    for your doctor.*

      CAMERA PUSHES IN ON JANE.  She's hurt by Deb's friends, seeing*
      her old self through their eyes is not pretty.  A beat --*

                                    JANE
                    Teri... Am I selfish?*

                                    TERI (O.S.)*
                    You volunteer for Meals-on-Wheels,    *
                    you do more pro bono than anyone at*
                    the firm, and thanks to your Christmas*
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      41.*

                                    TERI (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    bonus, I send my boy to private*
                    school.  Jane, what's going on?*

      Jane smiles.  Surprisingly, it feels good to be a good person. *
      Eyeing Beth and Amy, under her breath ---*

                                      JANE*
                    I'm so not selfish.*

                                      TERI*
                    What?*

                                      JANE*
                    Teri, I'm on my way to court.*

      As Jane heads back to her Porsche, we RACK FOCUS to Grayson,*
      who curiously watches Jane depart.


      Jane is at her desk, hunt-and-peck typing on her computer. 
      Fred enters, sees the now boarded up window.

                                    FRED
                    Wow, what happened?

      Jane glances at the window and shrugs.

                                    JANE
                    I hadn't noticed.

                                    FRED
                    How's your closing?  You gonna sock
                    it to the drug company?

                                    JANE
                          (with attitude)
                    Why do you care?

                                    FRED
                    What's going on here, Jane?  I thought
                    you were gonna quit?

                                    JANE
                    I changed my mind, for now. 
                          (then)
                    Look, Fred, I'm kind of busy.  Court's
                    in less than an hour and I've got
                    zip.  I can't focus, 'cuz I can't
                    stop thinking about Grayson.  Was it
                    some sort of cosmic joke having us
                    work together? 

                                    FRED
                    We don't have that kind of control.

                                    JANE
                          (a beat, then)
                    It's so unfair.  Grayson can grieve
                    for Deb, but I can't grieve for him.

                                    FRED
                    Sweetie, I think you just found your
                    closing argument.

      Off Jane, not sure what he's talking about.

                                                                          HARD CUT TO:                                                                                      63.


      Grayson and Deb, in bathing suits, sip cocktails.  They're
      laughing.  They kiss.  Then, they SMILE for a CAMERA and a
      PHOTO is SNAPPED.  THIS IS THE PHOTO WE SAW IN DEB'S HOUSE.

                                    JANE
                    She was everything to him.

      We FLASH TO ANOTHER MEMORY:


      Deb is on a swing.  Grayson is playfully pushing her, by her
      feet.  They're laughing.  Grayson SNAPS a PHOTO.  THIS IS
      THE PHOTO OF DEB, ON THE EASEL, AT THE FUNERAL.

      Then, Jane echoes Grayson's eulogy from Deb's funeral.  As
      she continues, she looks Grayson in the eye.                                                                                      64.

                                    JANE
                    People say there are five stages of
                    grief -- denial, anger, bargaining,
                      depression, and acceptance.  Today,
                    Marcus Newsom can't get past his
                    anger.  He's angry at Upland
                      Pharmaceuticals because they ignored
                    evidence that Zolpidem can cause
                      hallucinations with deadly
                      consequences.
                          (to the jury)
                    While relying on outdated clinical
                    trials, Upland ignored testimonials
                    from its own customers.  Why?  Upland
                    knows if they tell the truth, people
                    might think twice before popping
                    their pills.  Help Marcus Newsom get
                    past his anger.  Assess blame where
                    it belongs.  Only then, can my client
                    continue to grieve.

      She ends with strength; Grayson's in awe.  WE DISSOLVE TO:

      TIGHT on a CINNAMON ROLL.  CAMERA PIVOTS to the RIGHT -- TO
        A GRAPEFRUIT HALF.  THEN BACK TO the CINNAMON ROLL.  Then TO
      the GRAPEFRUIT.  FINALLY, PULL BACK INTO --
