TRICYCLE MAN drives into parking lot and parks next to GREEN'S
old Chevy. TRICYCLE MAM: locks his machine and walks toward
coffee shop. GREEN gets out of his car, locks it, starts in the
same direction. NORMAN parks the limo, goes into main building.
Barbara Jean's plane taxis to a halt.
GLENN has just deposited a postcard in a mailbox and approaches a
gathering cluster of people. NORMAN and TRICYCLE MAN are nearby.
Everybody is waiting for BARBARA JEAN to appear. GLENN steps
close to NORMAN.
GLENN
Am I late?
NORMAN
Late!
Oh, Jesus!
He runs off.
16	ANOTHER ANGLE
As NORMAN runs toward passenger loading, we see HAVEN'S jeep
arrive with HAVEN, BUD and PEARL. It parks and all climb out.
REESE and TRIPLETTE approach the 'Barbara Jean' plane. BARNETT
is already on the runway, making arrangements. HAVEN'S group all
shake hands.
HAVEN
Delbert, how are you?
REESE
I'm fine. This here is John
Triplette. Triplette, like you to
meet the Honorary Mayor, Haven
Hamilton.
HAVEN
Good to meet you.
(turns to BUD)
Bud, have them move the horses.
TRIPLETTE
Pleasure
REESE
Where is she?
HAVEN
Still inside the plane posing for
pictures and signing autographs.
She's got a new album cut again.
She'll be down in a minute. But
she'll be late for the Opera if she
doesn't hurry. Bud, get the plane on
the walkie-talkie.
BUD fumbles on his walkie-talkie telephone, but can't seem to get
anything.
BUD
They don't seem to be answering.
The ambulance boys are here, though.
Barnett always expects them to get
there like a shot. That thing only
goes a hundred fall bore with the
sirens going.
HAVEN
Thank you, Bud.
BUD nods like he has been complimented.
17	ANGLE TOWARD PLANE
A wave of noise begins from the fans. The band and majorettes
and horses and ropers go into a rendition of one of her hit tunes
as BARBARA JEAN appears. Everyone is breaking their neck to see,
especially GLENN. HAVEN and REESE give her the first round of
applause, then go back to talking. TRIPLETTE has never been
exposed to anything quite like this before and stands a little in
awe of the situation.
When the twirling and tricking and music stop, BARBARA JEAN
descends the stairs.
HAVEN
Bud, tell them to move the horses.
Promised this strip would be spic
and span.
He smiles and winks.
REESE
Listen, we'll go get the car and
come back. This'l1 be going on for
a while.
HAVEN
You bet. She's probably talking to
somebody about their sick child. You
know how she is.
They wave goodbye and head in the direction of the loading zone.
Behind them, the horse people disperse and get into their cars
and horse trailers, preparing to return to Nashville.
18	ANOTHER ANGLE
BARNETT comes over to REESE, TRIPLETTE, HAVEN, BUD and PEARL
while BARBARA JEAN continues to greet fans.
While the BARBARA JEAN arrival takes place on the runway NORMAN
finds BILL and MARY. NORMAN speaks softly and out of breath,
trying to pretend he's on time.
NORMAN
Hi.
BILL slaps him on the back and engulfs him.
BILL
Hi, Norman.
NORMAN looks relieved. BILL and MARY have been arguing.
NORMAN
Sure is nice to see you all again.
I never thought I'd see you again
after the last time.
BILL
Oh, Norman, you worry too much.
MARY takes NORMAN'S hand.
MARY
Norman, how are you?
She kisses him and he blushes. BILL and MARY are glad to talk to
someone else.
NORMAN
Fine. Just fine.
As they walk to the limo, we see a car with loudspeakers on top
of it and clearly written door signs that read: "Replacement
Party" in red, white and blue. REESE and TILIPLETTE are walking
toward it, shaking hands with several people.
NORMAN
Sure have missed you all, though.
Oh, where's Tom?
Isn't he with you?
BILL
Don't worry about old Tom.
20	ANOTHER ANGLE
TOM and the stews walk to a VW with a sun roof.
Nearby REESE and TRIPLETTE get into their Cadillac, behind it the
Replacement Party car. Coming from the loudspeakers a tape-
recorded VOICE:
VOICE
Have you thought about your future
and what America needs to examine...
Behind the Replacement Party car is an airport bus with "Connie
White" posters on the side. GLENN is one or the passengers. He
cranes his neck to continue watching the runway and BARBARA JEAN.
NORMAN'S limo, with BILL and MARY, follows traffic as the
TRICYCLE MAN fires up his machine. WADE'S car with SUELEEN also
joins the procession.
22	ANGLE TOWARD RUNWAY
The orange ambulance has moved into the area near the plane and
there seems to be a great deal at activity.
REESE and TRIPLETTE'S car stops, and they rush out and run into
HAVEN, who is shouting for people to get the hell out of the way.
23	NEW ANGLE
Two ambulance ATTENDANTS cut through the crowd. HAVEN, TRIPLETTE
and REESE rush near. BARNETT is on his knees over BARBARA JEAN,
who has collapsed. The ATTENDANTS lean over her with ammonia.
They test her reflexes, etc..
ATTENDANT
How long was she out?
BARNETT
Not too long. But she keeps
passing out.
She comes to and looks at them all.
BARBARA JEAN
(oblivious)
Just give your manna that vitamin
E. Makes a world of difference.
HAVEN
Here she is again.
She resists the ammonia, looks around and passes out again.
ATTENDANT
Okay, let's get her to the wagon.
A stretcher is brought in and she is placed under oxygen. BARNETT
climbs into the ambulance with BARBARA JEAN, slamming the door on
DELBERT and TRIPLETTE. HAVEN stands there, yelling at people.
DELBERT and TRIPLETTE rush back to their car as the ambulance
speeds off, siren wailing.
CUT TO:
25	TRICYCLE MAN
leads the procession.
STAR
You got the money?
ALBUQUERQUE
Right here.
STAR
Well, don't lose it. Last time I
gave you twenty-five dollars, you
lost it.
ALBUQUERQUE
Well, that just happened that time.
STAR
Well, it better not happen again.
ALBUQUERQUE turns and looks out the window. They ride in
resentful silence.
STAR
You lost twenty-five dollars once
before that, too, near Christmas
time -- I remember that real well
now. December 9th, to be exact.
ALBUQUERQUE
You got a real good memory, Star.
STAR
I remember when I just saw you.
Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were
skinny.
ALBUQUERQUE
(ignoring him)
What do you have to buy?
STAR
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get
something for the kids.
ALBUQUERQUE
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see
that Opryland.
STAR
What?
ALBUQUERQUE
Grand Old Opera --
STAR
I hate that music.
ALBUQUERQUE
I know that, Star.
CUT TO:
Near a bridge, a huge diesel truck almost collides with the
Replacement car, which has just made a greedy move.
To avoid collision, the diesel jackknifes, blocking all traffic
behind it, except for one narrow lane.
The ambulance passes all the vehicles, including the horse rigs.
As he passes NORMAN'S limo:
MARY
Don't worry, Norman. There's no
blood. Nobody's hurt.
She climbs out of the car and moves to the freeway rail and yells
for some workmen below to call the police.
44	ANGLE AT DIESEL
The driver is hurt badly. TRICYCLE MAN and STAR are there. STAR
looks up, relieved an ambulance is coming. His face drops as the
ambulance speeds past and toward the city.
45	ANGLE FURTHER BACK IN TRAFFIC
ALBUQUERQUE is walking with KENNY. She sees STAR returning to
his truck. She ducks into the ivy.
ALBUQUERQUE
Hurt my foot...
STAR approaches his truck, sees ALBUQUERQUE is gone and spots
KSNNY.
STAR
Have you seen a woman about so
high?
KENNY
No.
STAR
She had on high heels?
KENNY
No.
STAR
Need a ride?
KENNY nods "yes" and climbs in the pickup.
46	ANGLE AT BRIDGE
People are helping the injured driver. TRICYCLE MAN climbs on
his machine and leaves, heading toward Nashville.
CUT TO:
TRICYCLE MAN parks in front. He enters.
STAR hits the pavement, but there is no sign or ALBUQUERQUE. He
stands there as BUD and L.A. JOAN enter.
MARY mothers NORMAN. BILL, MARY and NORMAN enter the limo,
leaving KENNY behind. STAR drives up. He recognizes KENNY from
the freeway
STAR
Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
KENNY
No.
STAR
You got a place to stay?
KENNY
No. Probably stay at a motel
tonight.
STAR
(looking at
violin case)
You in music?
KENNY
No.
STAR
Get in.
KENNY climbs in.
CUT TO:
TRICYCLE MAN drives L.A. JOAN to the hospital. She climbs off
his machine.
L.A. JOAN
I hope he's still here. I don't
know where he lives.
GREEN comes out of the hospital and walks over. He is hurt
GREEN
You should have stayed. Ester's
been wanting to see you.
They walk off to GREEN'S car. TRICYCLE MAN drives oft.
GLENN is in the middle of the rose garden gathering a bouquet of
flowers. When he finishes, he enters the building.
KENNY stands on the front porch or one of the many rooming houses
near Music Row. GREEN opens the front door. He is with his dog.
We HEAR L.A. JOAN SINGING from another room.
GREEN
Yes, air.
KENNY
Yes, sir.
GREEN
Can I help you?
KENNY
Yes, sir. I need a room
GREEN
I think we can do that. Come in.
STAR drives past, looking for ALBUQUERQUE as GREEN'S car parks
and he and JOAN enter the hospital.
NORMAN drives up and enters.
OPAL is driven up to the house by the TRICYCLE MAN.
TRICYCLE MAN arrives. So do REESE and OPAL. She records
everything he says, more for him than her. He talks about being
counsel for all the Western stars and WALKER, too -
TRICYCLE MAN is the first to leave. He's with L.A. JOAN. After
they drive away, there is an exodus.
TRICYCLE MAN drives past the different churches.
DELBERT enters with his two kids. ALBUQUERQUE watches.
- MORNING
TRICYCLE MAN drives by as TOMMY BROWN enters.
LINNEA has come to join DELBERT and the kids. They enter an ante
room where coffee and snacks are served.
OPAL (0.S.)
Just living and then after that
making the total documentary that
will encompass everything.
We SEE them pass KENNY'S Nash. KEMNY and L.A. JOAN are there.
135	ANGLE AT NASH
All the door handles have been stolen from the car. So has the
radio and the steering wheel. There is a raw egg and a note that
says, "ha-ha."
KENNY is dumbfounded.
KENNY
What the hell?
He opens the trunk. There are several political posters and
politically motivated materials for WALKER.
JOAN
What's this?
KENNY
Replacement party.
JOAN
Who's that?
KENNY
A guy named Walker. Amazing
person. He's developed a huge
following.
JOAN
How do you know?
KENNY
Well I've been following him around
Just listening to him --He says he
can really win -- I bet he can too -
-
JOAN
You must really like him.
KENNY
Well, he's really amazing.
JOAN
I haven't gotten into politics yet.
I'm still into music --except for
you. You're into politics.
KENNY looks at her for a minute.
136	ANGLE ON HIGHWAY - SUNSET
The TRICYCLE MAN passes by the car.
END OF SUNDAY.
CUT TO:
137	TNT. GREEN'S BOARDING HOUSE - MORNING
KENNY is on the hall phone. Outside we HEAR the tricycle. KENNY
has a stack of dimes and in calling wrecking yard people,
MAN (V.0.)
Wrecks.
KENNY
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth
Fraser... And I'm here from Terre
Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ...
somebody stole my handles.
MAN (V.0.)
We don't mess with accessories.
KENNY
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe
you know where...
The MAN has hung up. KENNY draws a line through his name and
dials again.
As LINNEA hurries off, we SEE STAR sitting in his pickup truck,
watching and waiting for ALBUQUERQUE.
END OF MONDAY.
CUT TO:
The TRICYCLE MAN is helping KENNY fix the car, changing tires,
etc. KENNY is under the hood. When he comes out, KENNY tells
the TRICYCLE MAN how grateful he is and that he wouldn't know
what to do if he hadn't shown up. The TRICYCLE MAN just finishes
the job.
CUT TO:
178	EXT SHOPPING CENTER PARKING LOT - DAY
A platform has been erected in the center of the parking lot.
BARBARA JEAN'S bus is parked nearby. There is a large crowd, and
several people gathered around the platform. GLENN is among them
so is TRIPLETTE, REESE and OPAL. Radio station personnel and
musicians prepare for the show. Finally, the bus door opens and
BARNETT leads BARBARA JEAN to the platform. The musicians start
and she sings. The sound comes from many huge speakers and
people come from stores and shops to hear.
BARBARA JEAN segues from one song to another.
179	NEW ANGLE
BARNETT stands to the side, talking to various people TRIPLETTE
pulls his sleeve.
BARNETT
Well, for heaven's sake. You're
just about everywhere, aren't you?
THIPLETTE
I came out to see how you all were doing.
BARNETT
I think I should tell you I know
why you're here. The answer is no
... we don't get involved in
politics.
TRIPLETTE
(laughs good-
naturedly)
Well, that's not entirely true,
Barnett. At least not according to
Haven.
BARNETT
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing
poker together since we were
fourteen.
TRIPLETTE
I guess that's why he thought you
right want to help out.
BARNETT
He knows better.
TRIPLETTE
Well, it's probably because it
would help him.
BARNETT
How is that?
TRIPLETTE
Everybody likes to be as good as
their word.
BARNETT
Whose word?
TRIPLETTE
His Word.
BARNETT
His word? Are you telling me Haven
promised you something?
TRIPLETTE
That's pretty close. He's going to
be on the bill. Why not put Barbara
Jean on with him?
TRIPLETTE'S last sentence is caught in silence as BARBARA JEAN
has stopped singing in the middle of a phrase.
180	NEW ANGLE
She holds the mike and looks at Barnett.
BARBARA JEAN
Barnett..
She faints. There in a moment of confusion, then GLENN is on the
stage protectively as the musicians clear the people out
181	NEW ANGLE
BARNETT vaults through the crowd pushing TRIPLETTE aside.
BARNETT
Get her feet up.
He pulls himself on the stage. She is coming to and sees GLENN'S
face looking at her and rubbing her hands.
BARNETT
Okay, honey.
He carries her to the bus. TRIPLETTE is forced to watch from a
distance.
BARNETT sends the nurses inside. GLENN has pushed to front of
the crowd. BARHETT grabs a hand mike.
BARNETT
She's fine now, folks. Just too
soon after the hospital, I guess.
(he pauses)
She won't be able to continue and
she's in the bus crying her eyes
out, because she doesn't want to
disappoint the people who love her
the most.
There is a group groan. BARNETT looks for some under-standing
but there is none. There are several catcalls and GLENN, who in
near BARNETT, becomes so enraged, he tries to find the caller.
There is almost a fight, but TRIPLETTE intervenes. He glances to
GLENN.
TRIPLETTE
Come on, come on. You don't want
to waste your energy on that fool.
184	NEW ANGLE
Catcalls continue from other parts of the audience. TRIPLETTE
shouts against GLENN, who has turned his intensity to the crowd
GLENN
She's frail. You never saw anybody
so frail. I've seen her breathe hard
just standing still, dammit. You're
selfish. Worst selfish I've ever
heard. What if she died?
Would you
like that?
You'd probably say she
faked it so they could make money.
Well, you're just dumb.
185	NEW ANGLE
TRIPLETTE
We could invite them to the park.
BARNETT
What?
TRIPLETTE
They can come to the concert in the
park.
BARNETT
I said 'no!'
BARNETT studies the angry crowd then TRIPLETTE, who is holding
back GLENN against them. The crowd is even more angry
BARNETT
(to crowd)
We're very Sorry... Please... If
you'll listen.
(he makes the
decision)
You can see her tomorrow at Percy
Warner Park...
GLENN has disengaged from TRIPLETTE'S hold and pushed his way to
the back.
BARNETT
Triplette, I want to talk to you.
Moves closer.
BARNETT
I got trapped and you know it, so
let's have some rules.
TRIPLETTE
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I
understand your position.
BARNETT
No, you don't, so don't say you do.
Bunch of damn liars. What do you
get out or this?
TRIPLETTE
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
BARNETT
Your job, huh.
He removes a pen and paper and writes down the following as he
speaks.
BARNETT
She will not appear on the stage or
support that Walker guy and you
can't have any of his signs up while
she sings. She'll be on first and
out of the park before he shows up.
There will be no pictures, no
questions, no answers or tying her
name up with his now or in the
future to come. Any money she makes
will go to the President of the
United States.
He calls over his secretary and makes TRIPLETTE sign the
statement. Then the secretary signs.
BARNETT
We'll see you tomorrow. I'll send
her three songs over this afternoon.
She'll be done about ten minutes
after she starts and Walker better
not show up till she's through. Now,
get out of here.
TRIPLETTE extends his hand expecting friendship. BARRETT ignores
it. As TRIPLETTE leaves, a MAN who has been after BARNETT'S
attention steps up. BARNETT turns to his secretary.
MAN
Barnett?
BARNETT
(sharply)
What?
MAN
Well, Barnett, I have this terrific
song I've been working on. It would
be a natural for Barbara Jean. Like
you to take a look at it.
BARNETT looks at him suspiciously.
BARNETT
I'm very busy right now.
(to secretary)
Get me Haven.
MAN
It'll just take a minute. Here,
I'll even hold it for you.
BABNETT sighs and skims over the paper. Song stealing is the
same as horse stealing to BARNETT. He becomes enraged.
BARNETT
I don't know where you got this,
but something tells me you stole it
and I hate thieves.
The MAN takes the paper back and tries to walk away from him --
BARNETT yells after him.
BARNETT
Aren't you an engineer...?
I know
you -- Don't you work at one of
those cut a record places...?
Twenty-five bucks a shot, isn't it?
Usually their last twenty-five...
The MAN backs up and BARNETT follows him. They have entered the
crowd. The MAB starts to run. BARNETT runs after him. When the
MAN gets into the car. BARNETT picks up a rock, throws it and
hits the windshield with it. The car MISFIRES but finally
starts.. As the MAN drives off, BARNETT stands watching until
he's out of sight.
CUT TO:
((THE FOLLOWING Is INTERCUT WITH THE SHOPPING CENTER)
We SEE a fairground, then a roller rink, and a wrestling ring,
and finally a small portable stage in the center of a circular
track. The grandstands are partially ruled and stock cars roar
from another part or the field;
Around the stage -we SEE a sign that says, "Talent Show Tonight"
and we see the contestants and the MC, and NORMAN doing a routine
with an accordion player. After NORMAN finishes, the NC takes
the mike.
MC
Thank you, Mr. Berguan. And now we
bring you, 'Albuquerque.'
187	NEW ANGLE
ALBUQUERQUE walks to the mike.
ALBUQUERQUE
Hello, everybody. My name is
Albuquerque.
There are-a few nasty remarks.
ALBUQUERQUE
I'm going to sing a wonderful tune.
She starts to sing, "You're an Old Smoothie," and as she does the
stock cars leave the pit and drive to the entrance of the track.
ALEBUQUERQUE, disturbed at first, sings louder. The cars are
waiting for the talent show to set off the track.
188	NEW ANGLE
Albuquerque starts to take off her clothes. The MC hasn't
noticed, but the grandstand has. People shout, "Take it off..."
ALBUQUERQUE loves it. Before ALBUQUERQUE can remove the last two
garments, the MC rushes over and grabs the mike.
MC
We'd 1ike~to announce the winner of
tonight's contest. Albuquerque, How
about some applause for a darling
little lady
ALBUQUERQUE
Oh, I'm not through.
MC
That's all, folks.
The stands are calling to have her take it all off and her fellow
contestants are furious. RAVEN, BUD and PEARL are there and they
discuss her act.
MC
Here is the twenty dollars first
prize money and a seat in the
grandstands and now let's turn the
show over to Al Allen in the race
stand.
He shuts oft the mike.
189	NEW ANGLE - TRACK
The stock cars start around the track and stop in front or the
race announcer.
AL
Congratulations to Albuquerque and
welcome, everyone, to the Memorial
Race for Billy Apple, who died a
week ago in a wreck at this very
track, and we want you to know his
last words were, 'Are the other
fellows all right?'
A wave of applause and we SEE the talent show make its way across
the rack. The platform is already torn down and the MC is
helping ALBUQUERQUE dress. As she passes the drivers, they cheer
and she blows them a kiss and loses her first garment as she
does. More cheers.
190	NEW ANGLE
The cars are dented. On the side of one car it says, "Haven
Hamilton," and now we see him, BUD and PEARL in the stands. On
the side of another car it says, "Connie White."
AL
Want you all to save a dime every day and next Saturday we'll
take up a collection and give it all to Billy Apple's wife.
Share. Their four kids will sure miss their daddy. Want to
announce Bob Trilltree is out of the hospital now. Hope you'll
be back with us soon. All right, would you stand, please?
The people stand to a scratchy record of the National Anthem. A
'74 Pontiac circles the track with a man holding a medium-sized
American flag which flaps as the convertible drive.. At the end
of the song the Pontiac drives off the track.
AL
This is for Billy Apple. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's pick
ourselves a winner.
191	NEW ANGLE
The drivers get into their cars and start up. The track man
waves a flag which starts them around the track in pairs. We
notice the TRICYCLE MAN, who has been there all the time. The
race starts and the SOUND is deafening. ALBUQUERQUE is thrilled
to death. Suddenly, STAR sneaks up on her as she whistles with
her fingers in her mouth.
STAR
Winifred.
ALBUQUERQUE
Hi! Star.
STAR
Winifred, the kids want you home
and so do I.
ALBUQUERQUE
I won first prize.
STAR
Come on.
She has no choice but to follow him out. Several people
compliment her as she leaves the grandstand. She buys a bag of
peanuts on the way out.
Outside, LINNEA hangs the slip on the doorknob and leaves.
CUT TO:
A small, empty last rite for MRS. GREEN. KENNY and GREEN are at
the grave. In the distance, the TRICYCLE MAN watches.
GREEN
I guess she's not coming...
CUT TO:
Preparation for the big televised rally.
CUT TO:
Outside the Parthenon, KENNY, with his violin case, waits for
some food at the barbecue. ALBUQUERQUE'S who has fled STAR
again, waits near him. BARNETT is talking to REESE.
200	ANOTHER ANGLE
TRIPLETTE is at the stairs. GLENN is trying to get past a guard
and finally TRIPLETTE recognizing him from the shopping center,
helps him in. They enter the stair area, near all the TV cables
and equipment.
201	NEW ANGLE
They approach BARBARA JEAN, who is talking to musicians. BILL and
MARY are there with NORMAN, and LINNEA is singing on stage with
the black choir. TOMMY now steps up to talk to BARBARA JEAN.
202	NEW ANGLE
GLENN is lost in BARBARA JEAN'S magic. She smiles at him, but in
talking to HAVEN, BUD and PEARL and looking for BARNETT.
TRIPLETTE walks by GLENN.
GLENN
Listen, could you give her this for
me?
TRIPLETTE takes a note from GLENN.
TRIPLETTE
Sure thing.
GLENN
Thanks.
TRIPLETTE
TRIPLETTE hands her the note as BARRETT angrily steps up.
Someone calls
"places."
BARNETT
They screwed up. You go on after
the choir.
TOMMY BROWN joins LINNEA and the choir on stage. We SEE TOM
wandering and avoiding BILL, but catching MARY'S eye. OPAL is
near as is LA JOAN. BARBARA JEAN reads GLENN'S note: "If I die
tomorrow, I lived today."
203	NEW ANGLE
The applause builds.
ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Barbara
Jean...
The audience is swept away.
204	NEW ANGLE
In the audience we see KENNY and the TRICYCLE MAN and WADE.
SUELEEN is there, too.
205	ANOTHER ANGLE -- STAGE AREA
As BARBARA JEAN sings, GLENN stands next to BARNETT. She finishes
the song and looks in GLENN'S direction.
206	ANGLE - BARBARA JEAN
She is leaning on a stool.
BARBARA JEAN
I want to thank you for all your
good wishes. You are so important
to Barnett and me. Now I want to
sing a special song for all our
soldier boys.
The orchestra starts. She calls for HAVEN to come out. The
applause swells and, they start a song together.
A long black limo is parked near two ambulances, the attendants
sitting on the ambulance fenders and joking.
208	ANGLE - STAGE
BARBARA JEAN and HAVEN have finished the soldier song. The choir
comes out to back her now. The audience picks up the song they
sing. After the song everyone claps loudly, and a large bouquet
of flowers gets handed up to BARBARA JEAN. They hug as someone
begins to unfurl a "HAL PHILIP WALKER" banner behind them.
Photographers crowd in. Suddenly there is a sharp jolt in
HAVEN'S body and BARBARA JEAN is down. There is brief confusion,
but the choir continues to sing and everyone thinks BARBARA JEAN
has fainted again.
209	NEW ANGLE
The confusion mounts as both HAVEN and BARBARA JEAN are down and
there are flowers lying all over the place
HAVEN
Barnett!
My God, Barnett
I'm
shot!
TRIPLETTE runs up the stairs and the choir continues. BARNETT
yells for them to stop. He and BARNETT are over BARRARA JEAN,
while guards and BUD attend to HAVEN.
TRIPLETTE
She's... oh, my God... there's
blood here...
(taking mike)
Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know
what to say.
210	ANGLE - AUDIENCE
There is a VOICE among the noise that shouts:
I could have got that Walker bastard before. I've been closer,
closer than this, but my Nash broke down and somebody kept
stealing my things. I wanted to get him the day before, then Mr.
Green's wire died, so this was the right time. I love the
President of the United States. I love him.
Guards grab the speaker, KENNY, in an instant. He shoots a
policeman's foot by accident. Men swallow him up. Someone
yells, "sing."
211	ANGLE - STAGE
The choir has no direction to go in. ALRUQUERQUE suddenly is
with microphone.. She starts to do "It Don't Worry Me."
The rest
of the singers join in.
BARNETT leads the stretcher to one or the ambulances. He doesn't
allow HAVEN to enter.
BARNETT
Have your friend Triplette take you
to the hospital.
A man walks up from the limo. It is WALKER. TRIPLETTE is near.
WALKER
What'd she do, faint again?
I'm getting tired of waiting in the
car.
TRIPLETTE turns and belts him.
CUT TO:
The TRICYCLE MAN follows the ambulance, then heads off onto the
highway to Memphis. We SEE STAR'S truck going toward the
Parthenon.
We SEE STAR'S truck arrive and park. He gets out, as the music
and chaos swell.
