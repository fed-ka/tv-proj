               Cartman is lying in his bed.

                                     CARTMAN(V.O.)
                         ...When all of a sudden this bright 
                         blue light filled the room.

               A bright light fills the room.

                                     CARTMAN
                         And slowly my bedroom door began to 
                         open... And then the next thing I 
                         remember, I was being drug through a 
                         hallway!


               Cartman is being dragged by his ankles down a dark, organic 
               corridor like the one seen in 'Fire In The Sky'.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Then I was lying on a table, and 
                         these scary aliens wanted to operate 
                         on me!  And they had big heads... 
                         And big black eyes-


               The kids walk past their mean old bus driver, MS. CRABTREE.

                                     STAN
                         Good morning, Ms. Crabtree.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Sit down! We're running late!

               Stan and Kyle walk to the back of the bus and take their 
               seats. Cartman and Kenny sit up a few rows. Kyle looks out 
               the back window to see Ike still standing at the bus stop.

                                     KYLE
                         Dammit, he's still there!

                                     STAN
                         Oh, don't worry about him.

                                     KYLE
                         No, dude, if something happens to 
                         him my parents are gonna blame me!

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         SIT DOWN BACK THERE!! AAHHHH!!!

                                     STAN
                         Yeah, whatever you fat bitch.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

                                     STAN
                         I said I have a bad itch.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Oh.

               Stan and Kyle sit down and the school bus moves on. Kyle 
               turns around one last time to look at his brother.

                                     KYLE
                         OH MY GOD!!!!

                         VISITORS!

               Scared, Kenny pulls his hood shut.

                                     KENNY

                         STOP THE BUS!

               Kyle runs to the front of the bus.

                                     KYLE
                         Ms. Crabtree, you have to stop this 
                         bus!

                                     KYLE
                         But I....

                                     MS. CRABTREE

                         AAHHHH!!!!!

               Kyle runs to the back of the bus and hopelessly looks out 
               the back window again just in time to see the spaceship take 
               off.

                                     STAN
                         Cartman, are those the same Visitors 
                         you saw?!

               Cartman isn't looking. He still thinks this is all a big 
               joke.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Shut up, you guys, it's not working.

                                     KYLE
                         We have to do something!

                                     STAN
                         Well, we can't do anything for now.  
                         That fat bitch won't let us.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

                                     STAN
                         I-I said that rabbits eat lettuce.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Oh...
                              (Pause)
                         Well, yes, they certainly do.

               Ms. Crabtree turns the schoolbus violently and the children 
               go flying everywhere screaming.

                                     KYLE
                         What am I going to do? My little 
                         brother’s been abducted by aliens.

               Stan farts.

                                     KYLE
                         You farted!

               The kids laugh.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Somebody's baking brownies.

               We see the alien space ship leave the planet.


                                     MR. GARRISON
                         And now children, our friend Mr. Hat 
                         is going to tell us about Christopher 
                         Columbus.

               Mr. Garrison has a ridiculous little puppet on his right 
               hand that wears a striped hat.

                                     MR. HAT
                         That's right Mr. Garrison.  
                         Christopher Columbus discovered 
                         America, and was the Indians best 
                         friend. He helped the Indians win 
                         their war against Frederick Douglas, 
                         and, and freed the Hebrews from 
                         Napoleon, and discovered France.

                         I'll come home without him and my 
                         dad will start yelling - "Where's 
                         your brother, Kyle!" "You weren't 
                         looking out for your little brother

                         has that finger been, Kyle?!"

                         Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Oh really, Kyle? What is it this 
                         time?  Another prostate tumor?

                                     KYLE
                         No, my little brother has been 
                         abducted by aliens.

               Mr. Garrison stares blankly at Kyle.

                                     KYLE
                         It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave 
                         him an anal probe!  

               Cartman looks around at the other children, extremely 
               embarrassed, and finally forces a little laugh as if to say 
               it's all a little joke.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Uhh.. Huh, huh... That's a little 
                         joke.

               Kyle steps to the front of class.

                                     KYLE
                         Mr. Garrison, seriously, I HAVE to 
                         go!  Can I PLEASE be excused from 
                         class?

                         I don't know, Kyle. Did you ask Mr.  
                         Hat?

               Kyle looks down at the stupid puppet on Garrison's hand.

                                     KYLE
                         I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm

                         Oh, I think you should ask Mr. Hat.

                         from class?...

               Mr. Garrison shoves his puppeted hand violently in Kyle's 
               face, and changes his voice.

                                     MR.HAT
                         Well Kyle, NO! You hear me? You go

                         seat, Kyle.

                         Ha, ha! Mr. Hat yelled at you!

               Just then, Cartman farts a HUGE fireball.

                                     CARTMAN

               He farts another fire ball.

                              (pointing to Cartman)
                         It's the alien anal probe! It's 
                         shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         No, that was just a dream!

               Cartman farts another flame.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Eric, do you need to sit in the corner 
                         until your flaming gas is under 
                         control?

                         No, Mr. Garrison. I'm fine.

               Cartman farts a HUG fireball which burns PIP, a little english 
               boy.

                                     PIP
                         OWWWW!!!!!

               The class watches as their classmate runs out in flames.

               The kids are all in line for lunch. Cartman farts a huge 
               fireball.

                                     CARTMAN

                         immature.

                         Where?

               Adorable little WENDY TESTABURGER steps into the lunch line. 
               ZOOM in on Stan who is absolutely in love. Little Hearts 
               form all around his head - and Tchaikovsky's 'Romeo and

               The other boys see Stan's reaction and laugh.

                         her!

                                     CARTMAN
                         I'm not fat - And you obviously like 
                         her, because you throw up every time 
                         she talks to you!

                         I do not!

               Wendy walks up to the boys.

                                     WENDY
                         Hi guys.

                                     KYLE AND CARTMAN
                         Hi Wendy.

                         Here Stan, this is for you.

               Wendy hands Stan a note.  Stan VOMITS VIOLENTLY all over 
               himself.

                                     WENDY
                         Ew!

                         Bye Wendy.

               Wendy walks away.

                                     KYLE
                         Dude, what does the note say?!

               Stan opens the note and reads it.

                                     STAN
                         Holy crap!  It says she wants to 
                         meet ME at Starks Pond after school.

                                     KYLE
                         Whoa, maybe you can kiss her.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Or slip her the tongue.

                         What? How do you know she has a cat?

               After a painfully long pause, the boys all laugh.

                                     CARTMAN
                         I get it.

                         can get my little brother back!

               The boys make it to the front of the line, where Chef is 
               handing lunch trays to the boys and girls.

               The music stops.

                         WHAT?!

               Chef runs around the counter and kneels down by the kids.

                                     CHEF
                              (Whispering)
                         Well what the hell are you doing in 
                         school, eating Salisbury steak?! Go 
                         find him, dammit!

                         Mr. Garrison won't let us out of 
                         school. He thinks we're making it 
                         up.

                                     CARTMAN
                         You ARE making it up!

               Just then, Cartman farts another fireball. But this time, a 
               long, metal object emerges from his ass. It opens like a 
               robotic eye and looks around.

                                     STAN

                         What?

               The eye looks around, blinks, then closes itself and zips 
               back into Cartman's ass.

                                     KYLE
                         That was cool!

               Chef spins Cartman around and looks at his ass.

                         It's some kind of sembiodic 
                         metamorphosis device. This could 
                         mean the visitors want to communicate 
                         with us!

                         in on the little joke, huh?

                                     CHEF

                         back from the aliens, my parents are 
                         gonna disown me.

               Chef thinks for a second.

                                     CHEF
                         Ah, hold on now... You got to help

                         to try to scare me. I WANT MY 
                         SALISBURY STEAK!!!

               Chef pulls the fire alarm.

               Cartman walks into his house and is greeted by his overly 
               pleasant MOTHER.

                         What? Well that does sound pretty 
                         good.

               Cartman sits down at the couch and turns on the T.V.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Uh, Mom?

                         If anybody calls or comes over - I'm 
                         not here, okay?

                                     MRS. CARTMAN
                         Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs

                         Yea I want Cheesy Poofs!


               Cartman is still busy eating and watching T.V.

               ANGLE - TELEVISION

               A TV REPORTER stands out in a random wheat field.

                                     TV REPORTER
                         As the reports of UFO sightings 
                         increase, more mysterious crop-circle 
                         patterns are appearing in fields all 
                         around South Park. These crop circles, 
                         when viewed from above, form strange 
                         patterns...

               ZOOM OUT to show a huge crop-circle that looks EXACTLY like 
               Cartman.

               RESUME - CARTMAN ON COUCH

                         Could it be that aliens are trying 
                         to make contact with us here on Earth?

               Just then, Cartman's cute little kitty, KITTY, walks up and 
               looks at him innocently. The kitty MEOWs.

                                     CARTMAN
                         No Kitty... This is MY pot-pie.

               The cat meows again.

                         No kitty! Bad Kitty!!  No Kitty, 
                         this is MY pot pie!!! MOMM!!! Kitty's 
                         being a dildo!!  

               Cartman's mother appears from the kitchen.

                                     CARTMAN'S MOM
                         Well then I know a certain kitty 
                         kitty who's sleeping with mommy 
                         tonight.

                                     CARTMAN
                         What?


                                     CARTMAN
                         No Kitty!! You can't have any!!

               The cat puts its paw up and meows cutely.

                                     CARTMAN
                         NO KITTY! THIS IS MY POT-PIE! BAD 
                         KITTY!!

               Cartman farts a fireball onto his cat. The cat runs away, on 
               fire, making horrible sounds.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh, excuse me, kitty.

               Cartman's mother opens the door to reveal Stan, Kyle and 
               Wendy.

                                     MRS. CARTMAN
                         Eric, look who's here!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Dude, WEAK mom!

                                     KYLE
                         Come on, Eric, we're going to go 
                         play at the bus stop.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Can't- My mom says-

                                     MRS. CARTMAN
                         That's okay, Eric. I think you need 
                         to spend time with your little 
                         friends.

                                     CARTMAN
                         But mom, I don't want to spend time 
                         with my little friends.

                                     MRS. CARTMAN
                         Don't be difficult, Eric. Now you go 
                         out and play in the fun snow.

                                     CARTMAN
                         God Dammit!

               The burning kitty races through frame.
