We FADE IN on the block of stores (Quick Stop/RST), from
sometime ago, In fact, RST isn't RST; it's THE RECORD RACK --
a 45's store with head shop paraphernalia in the window. A
white-trash MOTHER (maybe seventeen) wearing a baseball cap
comes into frame carrying a chubby BABY. The Baby wears an
oversized t-shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe,
and messily eats a CHOCOLATE BAR. There are food stamps in
the Mother's hands.
MOTHER
Bobby-Boy stay here while mommy picks
up the free cheese, 'kay?
She looks up at the bright sun, shielding her eyes slightly,
then looks back at the baby on the ground. She takes off her
baseball cap and places it on the baby.
MOTHER
This'll keep the sun out of your
eyes. You be good now.
She walks away, leaving the baby sitting against the wall.
With the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his
mouth forming something that resembles a beard, the kid looks
kind of familiar.
Then, another MOTHER (also very young) decked out in a KISS
concert shirt from years gone by and huge, feathered hair
enters, with a black skullcap wearing BABY slung at her hip.
She sees the first Baby, sitting against the wall and sets
her Baby down beside him.
MOTHER
Don't fucking move, you little shit-
machine. Mommy's gonna try to score.
A PASSERBY enters, heading toward the convenience store. He
takes note of the Babies and the Mother heading into the
record store, and then stops and addresses her, disgusted.
PASSERBY
Excuse me--who's watching these
babies?
MOTHER
The fat one's watching the little
one.
PASSERBY
Oh, nice parenting.
(walking away)
Leave'em out here like that and see
what happens.
The Passerby walks away. The Mother flips him the bird.
MOTHER
FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING SQUARE!
PASSERBY
(waving her off)
Ah, keep on truckin'.
MOTHER
(to baby)
D'jou hear the crazy fuck tellin' me
how to fuckin' raise you?
Motherfucker, man! Who's he fucking
think he is? What's the worse fuckin'
thing could happen to you sitting
outside the fuckin' stores? Fuck!
The door closes, and the Babies sit there quietly for a beat.
Then, they look at each other. The larger one says nothing.
The smaller one says--
BABY
Fuck, fuck, fuck...
DISSOLVE TO:
THE PRESENT
JAY and SILENT BOB stand where the Babies sat. The Record
Rack is now RST VIDEO.
Jay is mid-chant.
JAY
(as a chant)
--fuck, fuck, fuck, mother-mother
fuck, mother-mother fuck-fuck! Mother-
fuck-, mother-fuck, mother-fuck,
noinch, noinch, noinch, smoking weed,
smoking weed, doing coke, drinking
beers!
Drinking beers, beers, beers,
rolling fatties, smoking blunts! Who
smokes the blunts? We smoke the
blunts!
A pair of TEENS approach them.
TEEN 1
Lemme get a nickel bag.
JAY
Fifteen bucks, little man. Put the
money in my hand. If the money does
not show, then you owe-me-owe-me-
owe.
(changing up to Morris
Day)
My Jungle Love! Yes, Oh-we-oh-we-oh!
I think I want to know ya', know ya'--
TEEN 1
(digging in pockets)
What the hell are you singing?
JAY
You don't know "Jungle Love"? That
shit is the mad notes. Written by
God Herself and handed down to the
world's greatest band--the
motherfucking Time.
TEEN 2
The guys in that Prince movie?
TEEN 1
Purple Rain.
TEEN 2
Man, that shit was so gay--fucking
eighties style.
Jay suddenly grabs the kid by the throat, throwing him against
the wall.
JAY
Bitch, don't you NEVER say an unkind
word about The Time! Me and Silent
Bob modeled our whole fucking lives
after Morris Day and Jerome! I'm a
smooth pimp who loves the pussy, and
Tubby here's my black manservant!
Just then, RANDAL exits the video store, locking the door
behind him.
RANDAL
What'd I tell you two about dealing
in front of the store? Drop the kid
and peddle your wares someplace else,
burn-boy.
(walking away)
And for the record, The Time sucked
ass.
He exits. Jay, Silent Bob, and the Teens watch him go. After
a beat--
JAY
Yo-youse guys wanna hear something
fucked up about him and the Quick
Stop guy?
Jay and Silent Bob are thrown against the wall outside by a
COP, who frisks them.
JAY
What the Fuck, Serpico? What'd we
do?
COP
We got a report that two guys were
hanging around outside the stores,
selling pot?
JAY
We don't smoke pot, yo.
Teen 1 enters and hands Jay rolling papers.
TEEN 1
Here're the rolling papers you wanted
for your pot. And your change. Thanks.
(getting in Jay's
face)
And The Time sucks ass!
Teen 1 races off. Jay and Bob move to follow, but the Cop
stops them, grabbing the rolling papers out of Jay's hand.
He eyeballs the pair.
COP
No pot, hunh? What do you need this
for?
JAY
What?
I got a wiping problem. I
stick these little pieces of paper
over my brown-eye, and bam--no shit
stains in my undies.
(unbuttoning pants)
You don't believe me? Lemme show
you.
Jay drops his pants and leans against the wall, looking back
over his shoulder.
JAY
Just spread my cheeks a little and
you can see the fucking stink nuggets--
COP
Pull up your pants up sir, Now!
Jay bends down to pull up his pants and FARTS. Silent Bob
cracks up. The Cop grabs them both, leading them toward the
car.
COP
Let's take a ride down to the station.
JAY
What? It's suddenly a crime to fart,
motherfucker?!
An ESTABLISHING SHOT of Brodie's store in the heart of Red
Bank.
BRODIE (O.S.)
No fucking way!
WE GO TIGHT on the huge, cartoon sign of BRODIE outside to--
Jay and Silent Bob mosey past the front door of the building
and knock.
Jay and Silent Bob approach a bus that's labeled "Los
Angeles." They nod at each other and then climb aboard. After
a beat, they re-emerge.
JAY
Tickets? Since when did they start
charging for the bus?
They head toward the depot.
JAY
Didn't we used to ride that shit to
school every day for free?
The bus roars past a sign that read: Leaving New Jersey.
The bus pulls over by the side of the road.
As the bus pulls away, Jay and Silent Bob are revealed, left
behind.
JAY
The whole fucking world's against
us, dude. I swear to God.
Silent Bob nods. Jay sticks out his thumb and starts hitching.
Jay and Bob are walking backwards, hitching still.
JAY
This sucks balls, man. How come we
ain't getting no rides?
VOICE
'Cause you're doing it all wrong.
Jay and Bob look behind them. There's a GUY hitching as well.
GUY
You gotta induce the drivers a little.
JAY
Like how?
GUY
Like this.
The GUY holds out his sign to them. It reads: Will Give Head
For Ride.
JAY
Yeah, but what happens when you get
in the car, and you don't make with
the head? Don't they kick your ass
to the curb?
GUY
Sure--if you don't make with the
head.
Jay and Bob look at him for a long beat. Then--
JAY
Eww! You eat the cock?!?
GUY
Yeah. If it'll get me a few hundred
miles across country. I'll take a
shot in the mouth.
JAY
Yeah, but we ain't gay.
GUY
Well, neither am I. But have you
seen the price of bus tickets lately?
Shit--I don't wanna cough up two
hundred bucks just to get to Chicago.
JAY
Well, I don't wanna cough up some
dude's sperm!
GUY
Don't be so suburban--this is the
new millennium. Gay, straight--it's
all the same now. There're no more
lines.
Jay draws a line on the ground with his foot.
JAY
There's one. On this side of it, we
ain't gay.
GUY
All hitchers do this. Why do you
think people pick us up? If you get
a ride, it's expected--I don't care
who the driver is. It's the first
rule in the Book.
JAY
What book?
GUY
The unwritten Book of the Road.
A TRUCK starts to pull over to the side of the road. The Guy
points to it, as if to say "See?" The passenger-side door
opens. The Guy climbs into the truck and closes the door. He
looks out the window at Jay and Bob.
GUY
Follow the rules of the Book, and
you'll get where you're going in no
time.
Excuse me.
Through the windshield, Jay and Silent Bob see the Guy go
face-first into the TRUCK DRIVER'S lap. The Truck Drivers
smiles, and the truck takes off, roaring down the road.
Jay and Silent Bob watch the truck disappear. Then, a CAR
pulls up. The NUN driving rolls down the passenger side window
and leans toward them.
NUN
You two boys need a ride?
The Nun's car screeched to the side of the road. Jay gets
kicked our of the front seat by the screaming Nun. Silent
Bob rushes out too, and the car races off. Jay's wipes his
mouth. He pulls a long curly hair from between his teeth.
JAY
Dude--she had seventies bush.
Jay and Bob continue hitching.
JAY
I can't believe this shit. Five hours
and not a single ride. Every day,
millions of people hitch to Hollywood
and stop studios from making movies
about 'em. But when you and me try
it, it's like we're trapped in a
fucking cartoon!
A familiar-looking VAN pulls up in the other side of the
raid, The horn beeps.
Jay and Bob look at each other, shrug,
and race across the street, get in. The van pulls off.
Jay wakes up suddenly, screaming. He startles Bob awake as
well, as he clutched at this back lifting his shirt to see
the scar. It's not there.
JAY
Holy shit, I had a horrible dream.
(looks around)
Yo, I'm hungry. Where can we get
some breakfast?
Bob looks around, and then locks on something O.C. He points,
and Jay looks, smiles widely, and nods.
An ESTABLISHING SHOT of the fast food eatery, as Jay and Bob
enter.
The van drives down the road. We hear singing from inside.
The side door of the van slides open and Brent gets hurled
out of the moving vehicle. Jay throws his guitar at him as
well, yelling and flipping the bird as the van drives off.
JAY
YA DIRTY SHEEP FUCKER!!!
The van drives down the road.
The van pulls up and all pile out, stretching. The Girls
head toward the store.
Justice calls over to Jay and Silent
Bob.
JUSTICE
You guys want anything from inside?
JAY
No, we're cool, thanks hon.
Justice smiles and heads inside. Jay and Silent Bob study
the front of the foreign convenience store. They look for a
place to lean, try a few spots out, then settle into one.
After a beat--
JAY
It just ain't the same, is it? This
place licks balls compared to Quick
Stop.
Silent Bob shakes his head "Yeah."
JAY
And speaking of licking balls--how
'bout that Justice chick? She is too
fine.
And she smells so fucking
pretty. She's got a nice voice, too.
And that body?
Smoking. You know,
she never once said "fuck off," when
I was talking to her, or pulled out
the pepper spray, or nothing. I tell
ya, Lunchbox--she could be the one.
A GIRL walks past Jay and Bob, heading out of the store.
JAY
(to exited Girl)
YO, BABY! YOU EVER HAVE YOUR ASSHOLE
LICKED BY A FAT MAN IN AN OVERCOAT?!
(to Bob)
Yeah.
Jay's dancing still, but now we hear what he's SINGING to
Silent Bob.
JAY
I'm gonna finger-fuck her tight little
asshole! Finger-bang and tea-bang my
balls--in her mouth! Where? Where?
In her mouth--balls-a-plenty in her
mouth!
Balls, balls, sweaty balls--
The Van rolls up across the street from the Provasik Labs,
parking in front of another large building.
Jay and Silent bob tuck-and-roll across the front lawn,
stopping at the building. Silent Bob pulls a GRAPPLING GUN
out of his coat. He fires it into the air as Jay quickly
gives the "metal" sign, and the pair are lifted out-of-frame.
The quartet piles out of the van, and we get our first look
at them: sexily geared up for action, wearing all black.
They head for a SEPARATE BUILDING.
Stopping at the front
door.
Sissy gestures elaborately to Missy, and Missy gestures
elaborately back, racing away into the night. Justice offers
Sissy a look.
JUSTICE
You are so gay.
Chrissy sticks a box on the door and presses a button. On a
digital readout, numbers roll until they stop on four
different digits. The door lock CLICKS open.
SISSY
Once we're inside, I want complete
silence.
(holding up high-tech
device)
Missy whipped this up. It counts our
decibel level. If it goes into the
red--alarm, we're dead. So not even
the slightest noise, got it?
Justice blows her off. Sissy enters the building, followed
closely by Chrissy.
Justice lingers at the door, taking one
last look back at the Provasik Building, fretting for Jay
and Bob.
SISSY
(pokes her head back
out)
Justice! Move your ass!
Justice heads inside. We PAN up to reveal a sign that reads:
BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE.
The Girls emerge from the Diamond Exchange, just as Missy
pulls up in a CONVERTIBLE.
CHRISSY
Boom Box!
Missy tosses a metal box to Chrissy, who catches it and races
toward the van, while Sissy and Justice pile into the
convertible.
SISSY
I can't believe it. Months of planning
and it's all blown by a fucking fart.
JUSTICE
We can't just leave them like this!
That alarm's gonna bring the cops
here any minute!
SISSY
That was always the plan, Justice!
They take the heat off of is long
enough until we can get out of town!
Chrissy attaches the metal box to the side of the van.
CHRISSY
Kaboom, you little stoner fucks.
The girls pull up in the convertible and Chrissy jumps into
the car with them.
CHRISSY
It's set. Let's roll.
The convertible screeches away, leaving the can sitting there.
The metal has magnetically attached to the side is counting
down from two minutes.
The front doors burst open, spilling out Jay, Silent Bob
(carrying their bag), and HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS--cats, dogs,
birds, rabbits. All race off into the night.
Jay and Bob race toward the van. Jay screams at it.
JUSTICE
JUSTICE! OPEN THE DOORS!
Suddenly, Jay and Bob stop dead in their tracks.
JAY
Oh shit--
Three COP CARS screech up, the van between them and Jay and
Bob. The COPS leap out of their cruisers, guns drawn. Jay
looks to Bob, pissed
COP
DROP THE BAG! BEFORE THIS THING TURNS
EXPLOSIVE!
The counter on the device attached to the van hits "0," and
the van BLOWS UP.
Jay and Bob get thrown backwards in one
direction, the Cops in the other.
On all fours, Jay looks
at the burning shell of the van, a tear forming in his eye.
JAY
Justice--
We crane up from him as he bellows--
JAY
JUUUSSSTTTTIIIICCCCEEEE!!!!!!
Silent Bob grabs Jay and drags him out of frame, still
carrying the bag.
We start on a sign on the door that reads: Federal Wildlife
Marshal, Colorado Field Office, then pull back to see a DEPUTY
opening the door and heading inside.
There are FIRE TRUCKS all over the place now. The burned out
van is being poured over by Cops. Just then, Willenholly
pulls up on a MOPED. He parks it and surveys the wreckage.
WILLENHOLLY
My, oh my, oh my. Who let the cats
out?
(thinks)
Wait--is that right?
COP 1 (O.S.)
Excuse me--who the hell are you?
Willenholly rips down the Velcro patch on his jacket,
revealing a badge.
WILLENHOLLY
Federal Wildlife Marshal. This
investigation is now under my
jurisdiction.
COP 1
Oh really? And why is that?
WILLENHOLLY
Because someone let a whole mess of
animals out of their cages, sir.
COP 1
Well, we believe that was just a
diversionary tactic used to call
attention away from the real heist
over here at the Diamond Exchange.
WILLENHOLLY
Yeah, right. That's a believable
scenario. It sounds more like
something out of a bad movie.
Willenholly and the Cop look at the camera. Then, another
COP joins them.
COP 2
Sir, the Provasik people say they've
rounded all their animals up, except
for one: an orangutan.
WILLENHOLLY
Listen up, ladies and gentlemen! Our
fugitive has been on the run for 6
hours!
Average simian foot speed
over uneven ground--barring injuries
or preoccupation with tire tubes,
mites or bananas--is four miles an
hour. That gives us a radius of twenty
miles.
COP 3
(calling out from
crowd)
Twenty-four, sir!
WILLENHOLLY
What?
COP 3
Six hours times four miles an hour
is twenty-four.
WILLENHOLLY
(doing the math in
his head)
Yes. Yes, you're right. My bad. Twenty-
four miles. Now what I want out of
all of you is a hard target search.
COP 4
Excuse me, sir?
WILLENHOLLY
Yeah?
COP 4
What does that mean, exactly--a "hard
target search"? What's a "hard
target"?
WILLENHOLLY
Well. It's--a target--that's--hard.
Anyway--
COP 4
So are you referring to the search's
level of difficulty? Or is the hard
target the monkey?
COP 3
Or the people who stole the monkey?
The COPS now chatter amongst themselves, to the effect of
"Yeah--It could mean that too--He's got a point--,"etc.
Willenholly rubs his temples.
WILLENHOLLY
Okay, how about this? What I want
out of all of you is a thorough search
of every gas station, residence,
warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse,
outhouse, and doghouse in that area!
Checkpoints go up at fifteen miles!
COP 1
Wouldn't it make sense to put them
up at every twenty-four miles--seeing
as that's how far they'd have gotten
in the last six hours?
They begin chattering amongst themselves again. Willenholly
looks at them all, defeated. He starts to cry.
WILLENHOLLY
This is so frustrating. It's just so
hard sometimes--
(yelling)
YOUR FUGITIVE'S NAME IS SUZANNE! GO
FIND HER!
Another COP joins Willenholly, carrying a large, fat envelope.
COP 5
Sir, this was just delivered to the
station.
WILLENHOLLY
What is it?
COP 5
It's a tape from the terrorists who're
claiming credit for the break-in.
WILLENHOLLY
Is it VHS or Beta? You know what--
never mind. Do you have a VCR?
Jay and Silent Bob sit close to each other, staring at--
SUZANNE (the ORANGUTAN)--who sits on a log across from them,
staring back.
JAY
This is Jussy's monkey
(to Suzanne, angrily)
JUSTICE DIED FOR YOU, YOU MONKEY
FUCK!
Suzanne covers her eyes with her hands suddenly. Jay and
Silent Bob, startle, with Jay leaping behind Silent Bob and
pulling back as if he's going to strike.
JAY
(to Silent Bob)
Do something. Tons of Fun!
Silent Bob offers the ape a weak wave. Suzanne drops her
hands from her face and waves back. Jay cranes his neck to
see over silent Bob.
JAY
Is that fucking thing waving at us?
Suzanne nods. Jay steps out from behind Bob. They state at
the ape.
JAY
Holy shit? That monkey understood
us! Maybe it's some sort of super-
monkey!
Suzanne offer them a "raspberry." Spitting as if the comment
was ridiculous. Jay and Silent Bob react with surprise at
this.
JAY
What the fuck was that for? It's not
a stupid idea! I seen it in Congo?
Suzanne holds her nose, as if to say, "Congo stunk." Silent
Bob smiles in agreement and amusement. Jay looks at him,
stung.
JAY
You're my bitch. You get my back.
Don't go joining this chimp's side.
Jay looks around the woods, formulating a thought. Silent
Bob moves toward the ape, extending his hand to shake hers.
JAY
Yo--what if there's more super monkeys
up in the lab? Maybe they're making
an army of 'em up there! Holy shit!
Maybe it's a conspiracy--like on the
X-Files Roswell--style!
JAY'S DELUSION: We enter into JAY'S HEAD and see--
A monkey dressed like Mussolini addresses a huge crowd of
apes, who wave fists in the air.
JAY (V.O.)
Then all it'll take is one little
monkey in a spiffy suit to whip the
dumber chimps into a frenzy, until
they go all ape-shit and start
demanding more bananas, better pay,
and human flesh!
Randal leads a pack of humans racing through a cornfield,
and is shot in the neck. He collapses, revealing a GORILLA
on horseback holding a rifle. Two other Gorillas throw a net
over him.
JAY (V.O.)
You'll have to be faster than Walt
Flanagan's Dog to outrun the warrior
gorillas, who hunt humans for sport,
profit, and the occasional inter-
species blow-job. And if you don't
wind up with a monkey hog in your
mouth, you'll be captured, killed or
worse...
The Quick Stop is overrun by vines in a jungle like
atmosphere. Monkeys exit the store carrying bunches of
bananas. The sign now reads: Ape Stop
JAY (V.O.)
Then these monkey fucks'll start
wearing our clothes and rebuilding
the world in their image.
We start on a FULL SHOT of Jay on the beach, looking up,
then SNAP ZOOM OUT to REVEAL Jay kneeling before the beach
buried Statue of Liberty, screaming, his arms raised.
JAY (V.O.)
And only those who outwit those damn
dirty apes'll ever remember that it
was MAN who once ruled the earth!
JAY
(at statue)
YOU MANIACS! DAMN YOUSE!!! GODDAMN
YOUSE ALL TO HELL!!!
WE DISSOLVE FROM THIS IMAGE TO:
Another close-up of Jay's painted face. Behind him, Suzanne
and Silent Bob are playing patty-cake. Jay eyes Suzanne
angrily.
JAY
Not on my watch, motherfucker!
Jay turns and rushes Suzanne, ferociously.
JAY
DIE, YOU SUPER-MONKEY FUCK! DIE!!!
Jay trips on a root poking out of the ground and hits the
dirt. Suzanne then goes over to Jay, pulls his face to hers,
and kisses him on the lips.
JAY
Alright--you can live. For now.
Silent Bob helps Jay to his feet.
JAY
You see that? Bitches love me.
(heading off)
Besides--we're in the fucking clear,
yo. It's not like anyone knows we
stole the monkey.
On the second-floor terrace of a run-down, roadside motel,
Sissy, Missy and Chrissy dance in their undies and drink
champagne. On the first floor terrace below, Justice leans
against the open sliding glass door, watching the news report
on a TV inside the room with the volume turned way up.
ANCHORMAN
(on TV)
Is that your cell phone?
WILLENHOLLY
(on TV)
Yes, Excuse me.
(on TV, into cell
phone)
Federal Wildlife Marshal. I'm on my
way!
(shuts phone; to
anchorman)
We got 'em. They're in Utah.
(to camera)
Citizens of Utah--steer clear of the
C.L.I.T. Stimulation of the C.L.I.T.
is not recommended.
Justice turns the TV off and yells up to Sissy.
JUSTICE
Your tape worked. The news is all
about Jay and Silent Bob's Provasik
break-in, with almost no mention of
the Diamond heist.
SISSY
(yelling down to
Justice)
I told you those two were the perfect
patsies. Now we lay low for awhile--
just in case--and start planning the
next job.
JUSTICE
Don't you feel any regret? Jay and
Bob don't deserve this. They were
really sweet.
CHRISSY
The only thing I regret is not gutting
that little trout-mouthed prick like
a fish and playing Twister with his
vitals.
MISSY
You are so nasty.
CHRISSY
I'll show you nasty, you little slut.
SISSY
Would you two get a room?
CHRISSY
Fine--we'll take yours.
(getting up in Sissy's
face)
I am gonna stain your sheets, bi-
otch.
Chrissy dances away with Missy, heading inside. Sissy rolls
her eyes.
SISSY
Sarah Lawrence girls. Go figure.
JUSTICE
They're your gang.
SISSY
Oh and not yours? You know, I don't
get you, Justice. You used to be all
about the girl stuff: stealing,
boning, blowing shit up. Now you're
like this little priss with a
conscience. It's really a fucking
drag.
JUSTICE
We all gotta grow up some time.
SISSY
If moping around over some little
boy you're crushing on is being grown-
up, then pass me my Wonder Woman
underoos.
JUSTICE
Don't you feel the least bit of guilt
for what we did to those guys?
SISSY
Awww. Does Jussy-wussy feel all dirty
about setting up her boyfriend? Then
how about taking a shower?
Sissy dumps the bag of diamonds over the side of the terrace.
They rain down on Justice below. Just then a PIZZA DELIVERY
GUY approaches the lower terrace, carrying a stack of pizzas.
PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
You the gals that ordered the pizzas?
SISSY
This dopey bitch ordered the large
plain, but I could go for some hot,
thick, Sicilian.
PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
No charge, lady.
He rushes into the
motel, Justice sighs, looking up at
the stars.
JUSTICE
(quietly)
I'm sorry, Jay.
There's a few COP CARS outside, and the SHERIFF is yelling
at the diner through his bullhorn. Beside him are the other
COPS.
SHERIFF
YOU HAVE SIXTY SECONDS TO COMPLY.
(to other COPS)
Fuck it, Let's give 'em thirty.
Suddenly Willenholly rushes up, dramatically ducking behind
the car, gun drawn.
SHERIFF
The ape.
WILLENHOLLY
What?
SHERIFF
An orangutan's a member of the great
ape family. It's not a monkey.
WILLENHOLLY
Look, who's the Federal Wildlife
Marshal here?
(into bullhorn)
JAY AND SILENT BOB, THIS IS FEDERAL
WILDLIFE MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY! YOUR
C.L.I.T.
DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE.
SURRENDER THE MONKEY IMMEDIATELY,
AND YOU WON'T GET SHOT!
Willenholly's on the bullhorn, yelling at the diner. The
Sheriff looks on.
WILLENHOLLY
ANYONE NOT HARBORING A FUGITIVE MONKEY
BETTER HIT THE DECK!
WE'RE GOING TO
OPEN FIRE!
(to cops)
Everyone has bullets in their guns,
right?
Jay and Silent Bob emerge from the diner, with Suzanne between
them (they're holding her raised hands). She's now dressed
up in the sweatshirt and jeans the kid was wearing in the
diner, with the baseball cap pulled down over her face.
It's a pretty piss-poor disguise.
JAY
Don't shoot! We're just trying to
take our son out of this hostile
environment!
From behind the cop car, the Sheriff looks to Willenholly.
SHERIFF
Their "son"?
WILLENHOLLY
Maybe they're one of those gay
couples?
Jay seizes on the idea. Silent Bob nods fervently.
JAY
Yeah! We're gay! And this is our
adopted love child! We're not from
around here!
Don't make us go back
to our liberal city home with a tales
of prejudice and bigotry in the heart
of Utah!
(whispers to Bob)
You see the shit I gotta put up with
for you! Now I got this guy thinking
I'm gay!
WILLENHOLLY
Oh God, this is the last thing I
need--a bunch of uppity homosexuals
shooting their mouth off in the
liberal press that the Federal
Wildlife Marshal's Office persecutes
gays.
SHERIFF
ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY! THOSE TWO MAY
BE GAY, BUT THAT AIN'T THEIR SON!
THAT'S THE APE!
WILLENHOLLY
You see this badge?
I think I'd
recognize an ape if I saw one. And
the only thing I do recognize here
is a political fiasco I'm, going to
avoid by letting this butt-fucking
Brady Bunch go!
Jay is whispering to Silent Bob, still vexed by--
JAY
And I'll tell you another thing:
what if that guy shows up around the
stores one day and starts telling
everybody you and me are poo-gilists?
How are we gonna get any pussy then,
hunh?
WILLENHOLLY (V.O.)
YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE, SIRS!
Jay and Silent Bob look at each other, shocked. They look
back out at Willenholly, who's yards away. Jay points at
himself, as if to say, "Me?"
WILLENHOLLY
(via bullhorn)
YES, YOU, SIRS.
JAY
(calling over)
So we can just go?
WILLENHOLLY
(via bullhorn)
Yes, sir--or ma'am. Please accept my
apologies for detaining you and your
unorthodox-but-constitutionally-
protected-family unit.
SHERIFF
(amazed)
Un-fucking believable.
JAY
I'd like to offer a big gay thank-
you, sir. We'll tell all our gay
friends that Utah is Gay friendly
country for gays who are gay.
WILLENHOLLY
I'm sure Utah appreciates that. You
might also want to make it clear
that the Federal Wildlife Marshal's
Office is also pro-'mo as well.
(winks at the sheriff)
And might I add, that's one fine-
looking boy you're raising.
JAY
Well, that's 'cuz he's from my sperm.
See, I knocked up a hot woman friend
of ours who I also fuck on the side.
So as not to be all-the-way-gay. But
my tubby husband here is one hundred
percent queer. He loves the cock.
WILLENHOLLY
He certainly looks insatiable.
JAY
'Bye
WILLENHOLLY
'Bye
Jay, silent Bob and Suzanne head off down the road.
Willenholly and all watch them go. The Sheriff is livid.
WILLENHOLLY
Well, it's not my way--but damned if
there doesn't go one happy family.
(balloon two)
Now, we just shoot some tear gas
into that diner, and when the two
guys run out with the monkey, we'll--
Willenholly suddenly freezes, thinking. He looks to the
Sheriff.
WILLENHOLLY
That was the them, wasn't it?
Jay, Silent Bob and Suzanne are laughing.
JAY
I said you "love the cock"! I gotta
be the craftiest motherfucker alive!
GUNSHOTS RING OUT, and bullets whiz by the trio, who are now
in full panic mode.
Willenholly and the Cops race after them, firing.
Jay, Bob and Suzanne race away, ducking bullets.
JAY
FLEE, FAT-ASS, FLEE!!!
The trio race across what looks like a bridge (but isn't),
shots still ringing out. Jay spots a manhole. He points at
it, screaming.
JAY
HEAD FOR THE SEWERS!
Silent Bob pops the cover off, With bullets ricocheting all
around them, Jay leaps into the manhole.
Bullets hitting the pavement around him, Silent bob dives
into the sewer grate as well, but--
CLOSER on the running Willenholly and Sheriff.
WILLENHOLLY
Fire a warning shot into that bulbous
ass!
SHERIFF
One rectal breach, coming up!
TIGHT on the Sheriff, as he squints to aim.
SHERIFF
Open up and say "ahhhhh," you stoner
sumbitch--
The Sheriff's gun fires.
The bullet ricochets off the curb, as Silent Bob's feet slip
through.
Willenholly and the Sheriff arrive at the manhole.
WILLENHOLLY
Wow! That was an incredibly daring
escape!
(to Sheriff)
You must see that a lot, hunh?
SHERIFF
Shut up!
WILLENHOLLY
Sire, you're very taciturn.
Willenholly starts rolling up his sleeves as the sheriff
looks on.
WILLENHOLLY
You and your men stay up here. When
I corner them, I'll call you for
back-up.
SHERIFF
What're you doing? They're trapped.
The only way they can get out of
there is right here.
WILLENHOLLY
A Federal Wildlife Marshal doesn't
wait for his prey to come to him. He
comes to it. Or goes to it. Is it
"comes to it" or "goes to it"?
(shakes it off)
I'm going in there. I'm counting on
you Sheriff.
Willenholly embraces the Sheriff.
WILLENHOLLY
You've taught me so much.
Willenholly then climbs into the sewer, disappearing. The
Cops look at the Sheriff for a beat, who heads O.C. saying--
SHERIFF
Fuck this asshole. Let's go back to
the station and get some donuts.
Suzanne leaps from the mouth of the tunnel, dragging Jay and
Bob with her.
JAY AND BOB
AAAAIIIGGGGGHHHHH!!!
As Willenholly plummets, he passes Suzanne hanging by her
feet off a pipe that pokes out from beneath the mouth of the
tunnel. She's hanging upside down, holding Jay and Silent
Bob's hands.
JAY
HEY LAW-DOG! SEE YOU IN HELL, COCK--
SMOKER!!!
Willenholly plummets toward the water below and ker-splashes
into the drink.
Suzanne has pulled Jay and Silent Bob back into the mouth of
the tunnel.
JAY
You see that shit? Damn--remind me
not to get on the monkey's bad side.
Yo--boost her up. So we can talk, so
we can get the fuck out of here.
Silent Bob lifts Suzanne over the tunnel onto the--
--pavement near the manhole. She sits there, looking down.
Silent Bob lifts Jay over the top of the tunnel toward the
road,
Suzanne sits by the side of the road. A car pulls into the
shot.
Jay and Silent Bob climb over the cliff onto the highway
just in time to see--
The passenger door slamming on a TRUCK with Los Angeles plates
and a sign that reads CRITTERS OF HOLLYWOOD. Suzanne is
looking out the back window waving.
Jay and Bob leap to
their feet, chasing after the truck.
JAY
HEY! GET THE FUCK OFF HER, MAN! THAT'S
MY EX-GIRLFRIEND'S MONKEY?!
The truck speeds away in the distance. Jay and Silent Bob
stand there, panting.
JAY
Man! Who the fuck just steals a
monkey?!
Silent Bob indicates themselves.
JAY
Oh yeah.
(pissed)
Well this fucking blows! We got one
more day to stop those fucks from
making that movie, and someone goes
and takes the only thing I had left
from the one woman I ever loved enough
NOT to try to stick my hand down her
pants!
Silent Bob mimes that they should go after Suzanne.
JAY
Go after the monkey? How the fuck
are we supposed to know where that
thing's going?
Silent Bob mimes in the direction the car went. Jay stares
at him.
JAY
What? What is that supposed to mean?!
Don't just fucking point like--
(imitates him)
You ain't the broad in the Children
of a Lesser God. Use you fucking
mouth for more than eating, ya tubby
bitch!
Bob starts an elaborate pantomime. Jay tries to guess what
he's saying.
JAY
You gotta take a shit? No--you gotta
take a salad? Take a salad? What the
fuck are you trying to say?
Bob's on the verge of tears, trying to mime out his message.
JAY
JUST FUCKING SAY IT ALREADY?!?
Silent Bob grabs Jay and screams into his face.
SILENT BOB
THE SIGN ON THE BACK OF THE CAR SAID
CRITTERS OF HOLLYWOOD, YOU DUMB
FUCK!!!
Bob releases Jay, breathing heavily and storms off in the
direction of the car went. Jay watched him go for a beat,
then follows, muttering under his breath--
JAY
Say it, don't spray it, bitch.
AN ESTABLISHING SHOT.
SHERIFF (O.S.)
"And might I add, that's one fine-
looking boy you're raising."
We take a quick visual tour of the city, including the sign,
the line of front of Krispy Kreme, the line in front of Coffee
Bean and Tea Leaf, the Simpson star in the Walk- of- Fame,
the Rocky and Bullwinkle statue, the Beverly Center, Jerry's
Famous Deli, the Hollywood and Vine sign, Mann's Chinese
Theatre, the Star Wars footprints outside of Mann's, the
Chateau Marmont, people on cell phones, Trashy Lingerie.
HOOKERS propositioning a potential JOHN, and finally--
We start on the street sign, and PAN DOWN to a JEEP WRANGLER
that pulls up. A gorgeous woman in sunglasses drives, with
Silent Bob sitting in the back seat.
After a beat, Jay pops
up from under the dash, wiping his mouth, looking around.
The Woman sighs, and zips up her pants. Jay and Bob hop out
and wave to the Woman as the car pulls away. Bob offers Jay
a look.
JAY
What? It's not like it's cheating.
Justice blew up.
Two HOOKERS approach them.
HOOKER 1
Hey, little man. You want some of
this?
HOOKER 2
How about you, Big Boy?
HOOKER 1
If you've got fifty bucks we can get
nasty.
JAY
Oh yeah? How nasty?
HOOKER 2
As nasty as you wanna be, poppie.
JAY
Alright--first, I'll want to tongue
your bung while you juggle my balls
in one hand and play with my asshole
with the other. But don't stick you
finger in.
Then. I'll wanna pinky
you and put it in your friend's brown,
while Silent Bob spanks into a Dixie
cup. After that, I'll wanna smell
your titties, for a while, and you
can pull my nutsack up over my dick,
so it looks like a Bullfrog. Then I
want you to flick at my nuts while
your friend spanks me into the same
Dixie cup Silent Bob jizzed in. Then
we throw the Dixie cup out.
The Hookers look at him, dumbfounded, Then--
HOOKER 1
Oh, that's it honey. I quit.
(walking away)
This job just passed the point of no
return.
HOOKER 2
(to Jay)
You one fucked up puppy, poppie.
JAY
(watching them go)
What?! You said 'nasty'?
(shakes his head; to
Bob)
Man, chicks in Hollywood are so stuck
up.
Jay and Silent Bob walk.
JAY
Alright, here's the plan: first, we
find out where they're shooting that
movie at. After we shut that shit
down, we can start looking for the
monkey. But before we do any of that
shit, we gotta find a motherfucker
in the know. Someone who's like, the
mayor of Hollywood.
They pass a DEALER leaning against a wall, trying to make a
sale.
DEALER
(subtly)
Crack? You want some crack? Sweet-
ass rock. Get you high.
JAY
No man, but you want some weed?
DEALER
(beat)
You on the job?
JAY
(pulling out a card)
Yeah, boy. Jersey Local 408.
CLOSE ON THE CARD.
It reads: UNITED JERSEY BROTHERHOOD OF
DEALERS, LOCAL 408.
There's a graphic of a stoner beside it.
DEALER
I'm Los Angeles Local 305!
They shake hands, slapping each other on the back like Union
brothers.
DEALER
You guys got medical in Jersey yet?
JAY
Shit, no, we might have to strike in
September.
DEALER
Norma Rae like a motherfucker. You
gots to get your benefits, you know
what I'm saying?
JAY
I hear that. Yo--maybe you can help
us out. You know where they're
shooting a movie around here.
DEALER
You in this town and you gonna ask
that question? Be a little more
specific.
JAY
It's a Miramax flick. We gotta bust
it up so people stop calling us names
on the Internet, even though they're
not really talking about us but these
characters based on us, and at the
same time, find my ex-girlfriend-who-
got-killed-in-a-car-explosion's
monkey.
Jay exhales. The Dealer stares at him for a beat.
DEALER
I don't know that the fuck you just
said, little kid. But you touched a
brother's heart, so I'm gonna help
you out with some directions to the
studio.
JAY
You know where Miramax is at?
DEALER
Fuck, yes. Miramax accounts for
seventy-eight percent of my business.
The convertible skids out, taking off.
The E! NEWS CREW packs up. Jay and Silent Bob study the main
gate. They watch the SECURITY GUARD approach a car that's
just pulled up. The Guard checks the driver's pass, then
lifts the gate to let the car through. Jay looks to Bob.
JAY
We gotta play this right.
Bob nods, After a beat, the pair tear-ass past the guard
booth. The GUARD leaps out of the booth, blowing a whistle
and giving chase.
Jay and Bob race around the building toward what looks like
an open alley then smash into it, falling down. The open
alley is a background painting that's being moved by some
SCENICS. Jay and Bob get up, shaking off the impact.
JAY
I hate how fake Hollywood is.
The SECURITY GUARD catches up to them now, grabbing them by
their shoulders, spinning them around.
SECURITY GUARD
Where do you think you're going?
JAY
GET OFFA ME! RAAAAAPE!!!
SECURITY GUARD
This is L.A., sir. We don't rape our
suspects in custody. We just beat
them.
(into walkie-talkie)
Echo Base, I've got a ten-o-seven
here: two unauthorizeds on the lot.
Request back-up.
VOICE
(from walkie-talkie)
I thought that was a ten-eighty-two.
SECURITY GUARD
No, sir--a ten-eight-two is the code
for vanishing a dead hooker from Ben
Affleck's trailer.
VOICE
(from walkie-talkie)
Oh, that Affleck. Backup on the way.
JAY
Hey! I make you a deal: this guy'll
suck your dick off if you let us go!
SECURITY GUARD
Contrary to what you believe, not
everyone in the movie business is
gay.
JAY
Well, how about this deal: he sucks
my dick while you watch and jerk
off.
The Security Guard stops, looks around, then releases them,
reaching into his pants.
SECURITY GUARD
Alright. But make is fast. And sexy.
Silent Bob looks at Jay, wide-eyed and scared.
JAY
Dude, it's either this or jail. And
you know what they make you do in
jail.
Silent Bob wells up with tears, slowly dropping to his knees,
reaching for Jay's pants. The Security guard bends down low
to watch at crotch-level. Suddenly, Jay hammers his two fists
into the Security Guard's neck, knocking him out.
Silent
Bob falls into a sitting position on the ground, relieved.
Jay looks at him.
JAY
Well what are you waiting for, bitch?
Start sucking. Bunnggg!
(looking around)
Alright--where they shooting this
movie at?
Silent Bob points behind Jay, at the SOUNDSTAGE they're in
front of. There's a LINE OF PEOPLE waiting at the door.
JAY
Worth a shot. Like a shot in the
mouth, you gay bitch. Eww, dude--you
were really gonna suck my dick.
Silent Bob shakes his head "no," wide-eyed as Jay heads off.
When Jay's out of frame, Silent bob shrugs like, "Yeah--I
guess I was."
Jay and Bob approach the line, as an A.D. calls out to the
crowd.
A.D.
Alright--bar extras. Follow me.
The A.D. starts leading the crowd in. Jay and Bob blend in
and follow inside.
An official-looking car tears down the road.
The Red Light FLASHES outside the soundstage.
Jay and Bob rush out, pulling a bench in front of the door,
blocking it. They race ten feet to another soundstage across
from them and head inside a door.
Jay and Bob race through the lot, with Bob carrying Suzanne.
On a fake New York city street, another movie is shooting.
The trio, bob and weave through the shoot, until--
At the end of the alley, a set GOLF CART pulls up, and four
Security Guards pile out, forming a human wall, blocking
their path. Jay and Bob stop dead, looking back to see the
other Security Guards gaining.
JAY
What the fuck are we gonna do?
Just then, a P.A. on a bike pulls up nearby. He ditches the
bike and grabs papers from the large hanging basket in front.
Jay and Bob look at each other, race over to the bike, and
jump on, putting Suzanne in the basket. They start pedaling
away furiously, closely followed by the Security Guard posse.
Silent Bob peddles like mad, racing toward the Golf Cart.
JAY
PUNCH IT!!!
Bob pops a wheelie and the Bike races up the front of the
vehicle, taking flight,
Below, the Security Guards stare in awe as--
Jay and Silent Bob atop the bike--with Suzanne in the front
basket--go past a moon (on a billboard, on the side of a
soundstage) a la E.T.
Jay and Bob look down, then at each other. They smile. Then
they look ahead and let out a scream.
The bike crashes through a window in the side of a Soundstage
Building.
The Security Guards stand outside a door marked James.
SECURITY GUARD
Great work, sirs! If you let us in,
we'll take over--
JAY (O.S.)
(through door)
NO! Me and Jason Biggs are naked in
here! Together!
The Security guard look at one another.
SECURITY GUARD
Uh--okay. We'll just be--outside the
door, sirs.
The Security Guards stifle a laugh, as one makes a blow job
face to the rest.
The Security Guards push a cuffed Jason and James into a
waiting Cop Car. The pair are still dressed like Jay and
Silent Bob.
JAMES
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUYS!
JASON
HEY! DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?! I'M
THE PIE-FUCKER.
SECURITY GUARD
(to Cops)
He'll be the pie--in prison.
Willenholly's car screeches up, and Willenholly jumps with a
shotgun. He slides across the hood of the car and lands beside
the flashing red light.
WILLENHOLLY
(looking around)
So, this is Hollywood?
(suddenly full of
purpose)
Lights, camera, action, Jay and Silent
Bob.
Willenholly cocks his shotgun and heads for the door.
Justice and Jay are still kissing, until Willenholly pulls
her away and loads her into the waiting Cop Car.
WILLENHOLLY
Sorry, Justice. We've gotta go.
(to Jay: friendly)
Hey--stop stealing monkeys.
JAY
Fuck you.
WILLENHOLLY
Fair enough.
Willenholly closes the door behind Justice and gets in the
car.
JUSTICE
(to Jay)
Wait for me.
JAY
What--here?
Jay looks at Justice, confused, as the Cruiser pulls away,
leaving Jay, Bob, Suzanne, and Banky. They start walking
down the lot.
BANKY
Well, boys--you're rich in love--
(indicating Jay)
Well, you're in love. And to top
that off, you've got your own monkey.
What more could two guys from Jersey
possibly want?
JAY
All those fucks to stop talking shit
about us on the Internet, for
starters.
BANKY
What do I keep telling you? There's
not much you can do to stop that.
Well, short of showing up at all
their houses and beating the shit
out of them, I guess.
Jay and Bob suddenly freeze. They look at each other and
smile.
JAY
(to Bob)
You know--with all that money we're
gonna make we can buy a lotta plane
tickets.
START THE JAY AND BOB KICKASS MONTAGE
A passenger JET flies through the sky.
Jay and Bob stand across the street from a house. They check
the address on the big ream of paper they're carrying, nod
at each other, and cross the street.
The passenger jet flies again, this time in the opposite
direction.
Jay and Bob knocking at another door. Another MOTHER answers.
They speak, she heads inside, and another KID comes to the
door.
JAY
On Movie Poop Shoot.com. did you say
Jay and Silent Bob--
(reading off paper)
"--are fucking clown shoes. If they
were real, I'd beat the shit out of
them for being so stupid."
KID
(chuckling)
Yeah.
JAY
Really--
Again, Jay and Bob pull the Kid outside and beat the shit
out of him.
Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a WOMAN.
Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a PRIEST.
The marquee reads: JASON BIGGS AND JAMES VAN DER BEEK ARE
BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC!
WORLD PREMIERE!
The front doors open and the CROWD lets out. First we see
DANTE and RANDAL.
RANDAL
Now that was worse then Clash of the
Titans.
DANTE
I still can't believe Judy Dench
played me.
RANDAL
Hey--remind me to renew that
restraining order.
DANTE
Why?
RANDAL
Because I'm gonna blast the flick on
the Internet tonight.
STEVE-DAVE and WALT exit.
STEVE-DAVE
Why can't Hollywood ever make a decent
comic book movie?
WALT
Tell'em Steve-Dave!
STEVE-DAVE
Would you stop saying that?
ALYSSA and TRISH come out.
TRISH
Well, that was just another paean to
male adolescence and its refusal to
grow up.
ALYSSA
Yeah, sis--but it was better than
Mallrats. At least Holden had the
good sense to keep his name off of
it.
TRISH
Why wouldn't Miramax option his other
comic instead? You know--the one he
drew about you and him and your
relationship?
ALYSSA
You mean Chasing Amy? That would
never work as a movie.
BANKY and HOOPER exit.
BANKY
I'm so fucking embarrassed--
HOOPER
Honey, you should be. They took your
characters and reduced them to one
ninety-minute-long-gay joke. It was
like watching Batman and Robin again.
BANKY
Thanks. That means a lot coming from
the guy who pretends to be Shaft as
opposed to the guy who takes shaft.
HOOPER
I don't hear you complaining nightly.
In fact, the only thing I do hear
you say is "Yes, Hooper! Cradle the
balls and work the shaft!"
BANKY
(looking around)
Hey! Hey! What'd we say? Not in
public!
A guy behind them calls out to Banks.
GUY
Nice movie, you fucking Tracer!
BANKY
(recognizing him)
You--!
GUY
That's right, you sonovabitch! I'm
back for round two!
Banky grabs the guy by the throat and starts choking him,
while Hooper tries to break them up.
WILLENHOLLY exits with Justice in hand-and leg cuffs and a
prison uniform.
They're flanked by two ARMED PRISON GUARDS.
WILLENHOLLY
You know, I don't get out to the
movies much. But I'd have to say
Bluntman and Chronic was Blunt-tastic!
JUSTICE
Are these leg cuffs really necessary?
WILLENHOLLY
Don't make me shoot you, Justice.
And finally, Jay and Silent Bob come out.
JAY
YO! THE PARTY'S ACROSS THE STREET,
FEATURING THE GREATEST BAND IN THE
WORLD: MORRIS DAY AND THE TIME!!!
WHIP PAN to Morris day and The Time on stage, performing
"The Bird." During the song, Morris points to--
Jay and Bob, who are dancing with Suzanne and Justice (who's
still in cuffs, flanked by the Guards). Jay looks to Bob,
they nod at each other and--
Jay and Silent Bob, join Morris Day and the TIME onstage,
and dance us out to the coda, which reads--
CODA
Bluntman and Chronic Strike Back went on to make a mere 2.3
million at the box office. It was the biggest commercial
failure in the history of Miramax films.
The film was roundly
drubbed as a bad idea by the denizens of the Internet chat
boards, and over the course of the next year, while they
waited for the Quick Stop restraining order to expire, Jay
and Silent Bob tracked them all down and beat the shit out
of them.
CREDITS. THEN--
