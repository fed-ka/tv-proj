    (MADDIE, CLIENT, ASSISTANT, CASEY)

  WE ARE IN MADDIE'S FANCY CORPORATE OFFICE.  SHE IS
    USHERING A CLIENT OUT THE DOOR.

                                    MADDIE

                  It's complicated but I think this

                may be the best will I've ever drawn

                up.  I think you'll be very happy

                  when you drop dead.

  THE CLIENT EXITS.  MADDIE'S ASSISTANT POPS HER HEAD IN.

                                      ASSISTANT

                  Your sister is on the phone.

                  (PICKS UP PHONE)  Hello?

                                                                            INTERCUT WITH:

  (BEN, CASEY)

  BEN AND CASEY ARE IN A BOOTH.  

                                    BEN

                  Alright, we don't have a lot of

                  time.  I've got a thing at 9:45. 

                                    CASEY

                  (AMAZED)  You got two people to

                  meet you this early?  

  BEN PRODUCES A PURPLE INDEX CARD FROM HIS JACKET POCKET.

                                    BEN

                  I have a list of the things you

                  need to know about the Putneys.   

                  It's gleaned from screw-ups I've

                  made and a lot of the tragic errors

                  that I've watched Mia's boyfriends

                  make over the years.  (HANDS HIM

                THE CARD)  Many good men have died

                to bring you this information.

                                    CASEY

                  (SOMBER)  I understand.  (LOOKS AT

                  CARD)  Wow, this is a lot of stuff.    "Pilot..."  28.

                                    BEN

                  Well, I own a hotel.  And it's

                  successful because I'm good at

                  picking up on people's wants and

                  needs.  I treat Maddie's parents

                  like a couple of clients.  You should

                do the same.  Like, what do you do?

                                    CASEY

                  I play in an avant garde metal band

                  that has a performance art component. 

                                    BEN

                  (TRYING)  So pretend you own a hotel. 

                  (OFF CARD)  Let's see... their dad

                is a huge grammar snob.  Try not to

                end a sentence on a preposition. 

                Do you ever say "comprise" when you

                  mean "compose"?

                                    CASEY

                  Those aren't really the kind of

                  words I use.  (THEN)  Hey, does

                  your hotel ever have events where

                  they need a band?

                                    BEN

                No.  Never.  (THEN)  Oh, and do

                  yourself a favor.  Don't give Mrs.

                  Putney your email address.  
                                    (MORE)    "Pilot..."  29.

                                    BEN (cont'd)

                  That woman has never met a cutesy

                  email she hasn't forwarded.  What

                  else?  They'll say you can call

                  them by their first names but they

                  don't mean it.  Compliment her

                  scarves -- she considers them her

                  signature accessory.  Don't bring

                up cruises -- they had a bad buffet

                  experience once.

  BEN'S BLACKBERRY DINGS.  HE CHECKS IT.

                                    BEN (cont'd)

                And it's another email from Mrs.

                  Putney.  This one is dogs and kids

                  napping together.  (CAN'T HELP IT, 

                  SMILES)  It's actually pretty cute.  

  HE PUTS THE BLACKBERRY AWAY AND RETURNS TO HIS LECTURE.

                                    BEN (cont'd)

                  Safe topics are wine, theater and

                the Yankees.  Topics to avoid include

                the Supreme Court and any movie

                  made after 1960.

                                    CASEY

                  Wow.  This sounds like a lot of

                  work.

                                    BEN

                  (PLEASED SOMEONE NOTICED)  It is!      "Pilot..."  30.

                                    CASEY

                  (HANDS INDEX CARD BACK)  I think

                  I'll just be myself and hopefully

                  they will like me and if not...

                                    BEN

                If not, what?  What's the end of

                  that sentence?

  CASEY SHRUGS, "WHAT CAN YOU DO?"

                                    BEN (cont'd)

                  (FASCINATED)  You really don't care

                if they like you?

                                    CASEY

                  I mean I hope that's not the case

                but what can you do?  It doesn't

                  really affect my life.  Mia is the

                one I am marrying.

                                    BEN

                So you just go through life not

                  worried about what people think,

                not scared of saying the wrong thing? 

                How do you do that?

                                    CASEY

                  (SHRUGS)  Dunno.  Just do.

                                    BEN

                If you ever figure it out could you

                put it on an index card?

  AND WE...

                                                                          CUT TO:    "Pilot..."  31.
