A man in a puffy foam-rubber rhinoceros costume dancing
under the bright friendly lights of a television studio.
Another rhino and various foam-rubber animals dance
behind him to the happy MUSIC. The rhino finishes his
number and takes a bow. A bleacher full of kids bursts
into wild applause.
Bundles of the morning editions are tossed onto the curb
from passing trucks.
The various headlines blare:
"RAINBOW RANDOLPH BUSTED ACCEPTING BRIBE"
"FCC PROBES KID SHOW BIZ"
"CORRUPTION IN KRINKLELAND"
The lighted Ferris wheel spins CENTER FRAME. We CRANE
DOWN and eventually LAND ON a side street with the
amusement park looming in the b.g. We're in FRONT of a
small building. The half-lit neon sign reads: CONEY
ISLAND METHADONE CENTER. We DRIFT THROUGH the double
doors THROUGH the reception area where random junkies
loiter and fill out paperwork. We CONTINUE DOWN a
narrow hallway as the faint sound of someone SINGING and
playing the GUITAR INCREASES. We finally burst THROUGH
another set of doors marked "Treatment Room." The
singing now fills our ears as we PUSH IN ON the
"performer" -- a big, puffy, orange rhinoceros. Smoochy.
Or to be more specific, SHELDON MOPES.

Smoochy sits on a stool with his guitar and sings to the
patients as they stand in line before a sliding glass
window, where a nurse hands each person a little cup of
methadone which they immediately drink.
The Smoochy costume is a mass of misshapen orange foam
rubber that exposes Sheldon's painted face in the front.
A multi-colored horn protrudes from his forehead.
SMOOCHY (SHELDON)
(singing to the tune
of 'She'll be Comin'
round the Mountain')
'We'll get that monkey off your
back,
Yes we will, yes we will
We'll get that monkey off your
back,
Yes we will...'
'We'll get that monkey off your
back
And get your life right back on
track
If you'll just give up the smack
Yes you will, yes you will!!'
The song ends.
A few baffled junkies applaud.
SMOOCHY
Thanks, fellas. I'm rooting for
you!
We PAN AWAY FROM Sheldon TO the exit.
Standing there in
her coat, looking mortified, is Nora.
WHILE LATER
Sheldon and Nora stand at the crowded counter at
Nathan's. Sheldon ravenously eats his sloppily-
garnished, oddly colored hot dog. Nora winces as
she watches him.

SHELDON
(with full mouth)
Soy dogs... never thought I'd
live to see the day. Organic,
rich in natural protein, and
nobody gets killed. Although I
do feel bad for the beans. Just
kidding. Sure you don't want one?
NORA
Believe it or not, no.
He takes another bite.
SHELDON
So anyway, like I was saying,
people always tell me, 'You gotta
network, Sheldon... you gotta sell
yourself... or you'll be playing
the drug clinics and shopping
centers the rest of your life.'
And you know what I tell 'em?
NORA
I haven't the foggiest.
SHELDON
I tell 'em, it's not about the old
handshake and back slap game.
It's not about adding fuel to the
shlock machine. It's about doing
good work. Having integrity.
Making people happy and delivering
a positive message. Foundations
are built with concrete, not
plaster of Paris!
He pulls the stained, misshapen Smoochy head from the
shopping bag.
SHELDON
This is concrete!
This is
integrity!
NORA
(calmly)
I can see that.
Sheldon realizes his voice was getting too loud.
SHELDON
Sorry. As you can imagine, living
by your convictions can be a
little stressful at times.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
NORA
We all have our cross to bear.
SHELDON
See, I was raised by my
grandfather, and Grandpop paved
driveways for a living...
NORA
Are we going into a story?
SHELDON
Thing is, he didn't really pave
them. Just covered them with
black paint. Of course, once the
first rain came along, people
realized they'd been swindled. I
vowed to myself back then that I'd
never make a living through
deception. Never. Whadda ya
think of them apples?
Nora looks glassy-eyed.
She takes a deep breath.
NORA
The reason I'm here today, Mr.
Mopes, as fate would have it,
Kidnet is currently looking for a
performer with... convictions.
And integrity. Someone like...
She almost chokes on the word.
NORA
... yourself.
Sheldon laughs.
SHELDON
Yeah, right. Got any more jokes?
NORA
I don't think I could top that
one.
SHELDON
Hold the phone. You're telling me
that Kidnet is finally ready to do
a show of Smoochy quality? Of
Smoochy caliber?
(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:
NORA
(dryly)
Yes... I believe we're ready to
push ourselves to that level.
SHELDON
I knew this day
would come!
After all these
years I finally
meet someone in
the business who
gets what I do.
Who gets what I'm
all about. You
get me, don't you,
Nora?
NORA
I'm afraid so.
SHELDON
Well, Miss V.P. of Development...
let's go make history!
CUT TO:
PREP MONTAGE
KIDNET STUDIO WARDROBE ROOM. A team of designers and
seamstresses cut, sew and shape endless sheets of orange
foam rubber. Sheldon stands on a wooden box as he's
measured from head to toe. On the wall is a blueprint
labeled "Smoochy the Rhino -- REDESIGN."
A costume designer walks over with the new Smoochy head
and places it on Sheldon.
As seamstresses fit him with the new Smoochy costume,
various signs and billboards FLOAT THROUGH the FRAME,
trumpeting copy like: "IT'S ALMOST SMOOCHY TIME!"
"GET READY TO BE SMOOCHED, AMERICA!" "ONLY TWO MORE
WEEKS TILL SMOOCHY!"
KIDNET STUDIO -C.
Sets, props, and camera equipment are rolled into the
studio. Through a SERIES of DISSOLVES we see the
Smoochyland Magic Jungle take shape.
KIDNET STUDIO -C - LATER
A choreographer maps out a number for Smoochy and the
"Rhinettes." (The Rhinettes are the former Krinkle Kid
little people with horns strapped to their foreheads.)

CONTINUED:
Nora and Stokes watch from the wings with a mixture of
uncertainty and disgust.
DISSOLVE BACK TO:
WARDROBE ROOM
A seamstress zips up the back of the finished, redesigned
Smoochy costume. Sheldon stands proudly before the
design team. Smoochy is now television ready: smoothed
out, more colorful, less lumpy and exuding sunshiny
happiness.
DISSOLVE TO:
STUDIO -C - BACKSTAGE
Smoochy is about to enter with the Rhinettes.
ANGELO, a
former Krinkle Kid, stands beside him.
SMOOCHY
Angelo, you were always my favorite
Krinkle Kid. The way you'd click
your heels during the 'Jellybean
Jam.' Real artistry. I'm honored
to have you as a Rhinette.
ANGELO
A job's a job.
STUDIO -C - PRACTICE TAPING
Suddenly lights up in all its multi-colored Smoochyland
glory. The bleachers are full of children.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
Hey, kids! Who's your favorite
rhino?
The kids in the bleachers all scream in unison.
KIDS
Smoochy!
Smoochy bounds out on stage followed by the Rhinettes who
form a dancing circle around him.
SMOOCHY
Hiya, kids!
(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED:
KIDS
Hi, Smoochy!
SMOOCHY
It's gonna be a fantabulous day in
Smoochyland!!
The kids cheer as Smoochy and the Rhinettes featuring Angelo
Pike, go into their "It's a Fantabulous Day in Smoochyland"
number -- a catchy, bouncy song and dance routine that plays out
in the sugar-coated jungle of Smoochyland.
SMOOCHY
(singing)
'Ohhhh... it's a fantabulous day
in Smoochy-land/Let's have a great
big cheer for the Smoochy-land
band/We'll dance with our jungle
pals, won't that be grand/Oh, it's
a fantabulous day in Smoochy-
land!'
Smoochy dances right UP TO the CAMERA, FILLING the FRAME
with his friendly, puffy face.
END of prep MONTAGE.
A disheveled Randolph paces on a deserted dock. The
Brooklyn Bridge looms in the b.g. A car pulls up in the
b.g. Stokes gets out. Randolph moves under an awning.
RANDOLPH
I was starting to think that maybe
you weren't coming.
STOKES
I agreed to meet you, didn't I?
I
had a dinner engagement.
Randolph takes a swig from a flask.
RANDOLPH
Really? You know, I used to have
dinner engagements. Sometimes
four, five a night. Dinner...
drinks... I was the toast of the
fucking town.
STOKES
Don't start, Randolph.
Please.

RANDOLPH
(voice rising)
Cars, boats, whores and horses, I
had 'em all. When I walked into a
restaurant, ten guys reached for
my hat. When I stood up to take a
piss, they cleared the rest room.
I'd walk down the street and
traffic stopped, mouths gaped.
You know why? You know why,
Frank?
(now shouting)
I was Rainbow fucking Randolph!
That's why!
STOKES
Are you through?
RANDOLPH
What? You're in a hurry? You
don't have time for me? The guy
who earned for you? The guy who
put those fucking suits on your
back and the pheasant au vin in
your Brooklyn mouth?
STOKES
I think it's fair to say we helped
each other.
Randolph suddenly breaks down.
RANDOLPH
(pleading)
You gotta fix it, Frank. You
gotta get me my slot back.
He now clings to Stokes' lapels.
RANDOLPH
How can I sit around while that
rhinoceros... that horned
carpetbagger gets a free ride on
my dime? You and I have history,
Frank! Please!
Stokes pries Randolph's hands from his overcoat.
STOKES
There's nothing I can do for you.
Nothing. You're a pariah. I
can't even be seen with you.
(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED:
RANDOLPH
Don't do this to me, Frank. I'm in
deep, deep shit. They kicked me out
of the corporate penthouse... I got
bookies breathing down my neck.
I'm homeless! Don't you hear what
I'm saying? I'm not gonna make it!
The clock's ticking! Put yourself
in my shoes, for Christ's sake!
STOKES
The ugly truth is, your shoes have
become my shoes. As long as the
rhino's on the air, everything's
by the book. No skim, no
percentage. Nothing. The network
wanted squeaky clean and they got
it. And believe me, Mopes is
sparkling.
He looks Randolph squarely in the eye.
STOKES
You're totally broke? You don't
have a dime left to your name?
RANDOLPH
Yes! Exactly! That's what I'm
trying to tell you!
Randolph looks at him hopefully as Stokes straightens his
tie.
STOKE
Don't contact me again, Randy.
Ever.
Stokes walks off.
Randolph watches him disappear through
the mist.
RANDOLPH
You'll get yours, Frank! The rhino
too! Do you hear me?! The wheels
are turning!
Stokes is gone. Randolph takes a swig from his flask and
wipes his chin with his sleeve. He stares out at the
river.
RANDOLPH

himself)
Sooner or later, even a guy who's
squeaky clean falls into mud.
THUNDER CLAP.

FADE OUT.
FADE IN:
Nora emerges from the revolving door of the Kidnet
building which is located in the heart of Times Square
and heads down Broadway. Sheldon emerges from the
building.
SHELDON
Hey, Nora, wait up.
She keeps walking. Sheldon catches up and walks
alongside her, occasionally getting jostled by passersby.

19.
CONTINUED:
SHELDON
Good meeting today. I thought we
tackled some hot issues.
Although, I'll be honest, there
were a few times that I felt my
voice wasn't being heard.
NORA
I think that's a conservative
estimate.
SHELDON
I just want the show to have some
weight, you know? Some substance.
Silly songs, sure -- but with a
message. Pop quiz: How many
original compositions are in the
Smoochy songbook?
NORA
Do you sense my complete lack of
interest?
SHELDON
Try two thousand. Covering every
topic from how yummy vegetables
are to the importance of donating
plasma. Don't you get it, Nora?
I'm a valuable resource. Use me.
Nora stops.
She looks Sheldon in the eye for the first
time.
NORA
Can I make this real easy for you?
SHELDON
Sure.
NORA
The only reason you're on TV right
now is because Rainbow Randolph is
a degenerate scumbag. I didn't
discover you, I delivered you.
Like a bag of groceries. I have a
bigger emotional investment in my
nail polish. So don't peddle your
sap to me, rhino. Your job is
just to smile and nod your head.
She walks off.
20.
Randolph peers through the restaurant's front window. He
shivers from the cold as he watches Sheldon and Burke
shake hands. Burke heads for the exit. Randolph quickly
ducks into the shadows. A moment later, Burke exits the
club and walks down the street. Randolph pops out.
RANDOLPH
I saw you! I saw you in there...
at my table... talking to him.
BURKE
Yeah, so what do you want?
A
parade?
RANDOLPH
You're my agent! Or did you
forget that?

BURKE
Not anymore, pal. You're a
cigarette butt. Go lay in the
gutter.
Burke walks off.
In the litter-strewn alley, we PAN ACROSS several grocery
bags, broken egg shells, flour bags, butter wrappers,
mixing bowls and other baking ingredients. The PAN ENDS
ON Randolph, who stands over a barrel fire, holding a
spatula. A cookie sheet rests on the barrel. Randolph
removes the cookie sheet and gazes at it gleefully. We
now see that the cookies are phallic-shaped.
RANDOLPH
Ah! They're beautiful! A perfect
batch of cock cookies for a very
special rhino.
He sets the tray aside.
RANDOLPH
Oh yes, you're going to learn
about shame, my dear Smoochy.
And
I'm your professor.
He laughs.
We are ON the smiling goofy face of Sheldon, whose
picture graces the front page of Variety under the
headline, "MOPES TO EXECUTIVE PRODUCE SMOOCHY SHOW." The
subhead reads, "TENURE TO BEGIN TODAY." A dollar bill is
slapped down over the picture.
We WIDEN OUT to see Sheldon buying the magazine at the
newsstand in front of the Kidnet Building. He turns and
walks toward the Kidnet entrance. He stops and looks up
at the building. Smiling, he takes a deep breath and
enters.
Sheldon exits the Kidnet building and walks to the curb
to hail a cab. A friendly-looking man in a suit and bow
tie approaches him. This is MERV GREEN.
MERV
Hi there.
SHELDON
Hi.
A limo pulls up in front of them.
Merv opens the back
door.
MERV
Get in.
SHELDON
Thanks anyway, but I'm going
uptown.

Merv pulls his jacket back to reveal a revolver tucked in
his waistband.
MERV
Humor me, rhino.
A black Lincoln Town Car travels across the bridge toward
Staten Island.
SHELDON (V.O.)
Thanks for picking me up, Mr.
Kunklepeck. It's very nice of
you.
The Town Car is parked behind an old warehouse in the
middle of nowhere. Sheldon is now in costume. Randolph
rushes out of the door, very excited.
RANDOLPH
Okay, they're ready for you!
SHELDON
I gotta say, this is a first -- I
never performed in a tractor parts
warehouse before.
RANDOLPH
Well, we like to do these things
no-frills. It's all about the
kids.
SHELDON
Amen to that.
Randolph opens the door a crack and listens.
We hear an
O.S. VOICE from inside.
VOICE (O.S.)
It gives me great pleasure to
introduce our very special
guest... a supporter of the cause
and a friend to the brotherhood.
Please welcome, the one, the
only... Smoochy the Rhino!
We hear APPLAUSE.
Randolph quickly opens the rusty door.
RANDOLPH
Knock 'em dead, kid!
He shoves Sheldon inside.
Sheldon is led from the warehouse in handcuffs and is
barraged with questions from waiting REPORTERS.
Flashbulbs go off as they shout out questions.

How does it feel to be a hate-

Sheldon is shoved into the back seat of a squad car.

The squad car drives through Times Square. The headlines

During Rhino's Performance... Aryan Brotherhood Declares
Smoochy 'One of us.'... President Condemns 'Smoochy the
Fascist'..."
The Kidnet CEO stands before a cluster of reporters and
network cameras. We can see the Times Square zipper
marquee THROUGH the glass doors behind him.
Headlines read: "Congressional Committee Probes Nazi
Ties to Kid Biz"... "Smoochy Photos Removed From City
Elementary Schools"... "Jewish Groups Plan 'Day of
Outrage'"... "Rhino in Bronx Zoo Pelted With Eggs"...

Here at Kidnet, Smoochy the Rhino

Randolph dances down the street like Gene Kelly. He
whistles a happy tune and tips his hat to everyone who
walks by. As he dances along, he pets a dog...
RANDOLPH
Hi there, poochy!
Coos at a baby in a stroller...
RANDOLPH
Well, aren't you the cutest little
boo-boo in the world!
And grabs a rose from a flower vendor before handing it
to an old lady...
RANDOLPH
For you, my dear!
May you live to
be a hundred!
He continues to dance onward, waving back at everyone.
Unfortunately, he doesn't realize he's heading straight
for a light pole and slams into it with a sickening
smack.
RANDOLPH
Fuck!
Nora exits the revolving door of the Kidnet building and
heads down Broadway. Sheldon pops out from a store
front. He's wearing a knit cap and sunglasses to
disguise himself.
SHELDON

Nora keeps walking.

at that rally.
SHELDON
Perform?
I barely sang one song.
NORA
Well maybe next time you'll do
a longer set.
SHELDON
Nora, I had no idea that was a
Nazi function. None whatsoever!
NORA
Funny, you'd think the fifty-foot
swastika you were standing in
front of might've given you a
hint.
SHELDON
The papers are blowing that out of
proportion. It was nowhere near
that big.
Nora stops and looks Sheldon in the eye.
NORA
Look, the fact of the matter is, I
don't know you, okay? Not really.
So don't expect me to go out on an
emotional limb here.
Sheldon looks crushed.
SHELDON
But what about the balcony? What
about the Klunky-Wunky dance?
NORA
I was drunk.
Don't read too much
into it.
She looks at him for a moment and then walks off.
61.
A disheveled and unshaven Sheldon wanders the streets,
looking dazed. He's stuffing a cupcake into his mouth
and swigging from a bottle of root beer. He passes a
construction site and notices some graffiti on a wall --
a crudely-drawn goose-stepping Smoochy in a Nazi uniform
and Hitler moustache. Sheldon keeps walking. He
descends the subway stairs at 42nd Street.
Sheldon comes up from the subway.
We see the Cyclone
from Astroland in the b.g.
Sheldon stands in front of the methadone clinic he used
to perform at. It's boarded up. He just stares at it.
An OLD VAGRANT walks up to him.
OLD VAGRANT
If you're lookin' to get a cup of
juice, the well's dried up, son.
City shut her down. Bastards'll

Statue of Liberty, but they won't

The Vagrant shakes his head sadly.
OLD VAGRANT
Just once I wish I had a little
clout. You know? I'd set things
straight in this town, believe me.

Randolph, bruised and battered, emerges from the police
station with his LAWYER. REPORTERS and photographers
rush forward.

He pushes a sullen Randolph through the cluster of
people.
A down-and-out Randolph shuffles along in ratty bedroom
slippers. He passes a MAN who sits behind a small table
on the sidewalk. The table has a huge photograph of a
rhinoceros taped in front of it. Literature and
pamphlets depicting the black rhino are spread out on the
table.
MAN
Save the rhino! Before it's too
late! Make a donation! Save the
rhino!
(to Randolph)
Hey, mister, ya wanna help save
the rhino?
Randolph just looks at him for a moment. He looks at all
the rhino-related imagery. He starts shaking and
suddenly jumps over the table and attacks the Man.
RANDOLPH
I'm the one who needs to be saved!
Me. I'm broke! I lost my lawyer!
My only friend kicked me out! I'm
a fucking peanut shell in the

Someone call a cop!
Randolph grabs the collection can and runs off.

It's a chilly, grey afternoon. Stokes and Burke walk along

STOKES
Your client is suffocating me. To
make matters worse, he's caused me
to veer into a hazardous situation.
A situation that otherwise could
have a very happy ending.
BURKE
Tell me more about the Asians.
STOKES
They're ruthless. Unwavering.
Unprincipled. And best of all,
they know how the game is played.
They respect our delicate
ecosystem of mutual benefit.
Stokes stops walking and grabs Burke's arm.
STOKES
I'd bring you in on this, Burke.
You'd be my partner on the Takashi
deal. Split down the middle. We
have an opportunity to get back on
track here. Back to the way it
was.
BURKE

STOKES

MERV
This is what happens to guys who

The thug punches him in the stomach again.
JOHNNY
No!

Merv nods to one of the thugs who releases Peter Pan.
He
slumps to the ground. Merv kneels down and lifts his
head from the pavement.

BURKE
Look, I'm chokin' on the same bone

MERV
If you're trying to aggravate me,
you're doing a hell of a job.
BURKE
I'm not here to aggravate, just
educate. I think Mopes might be

MERV
That's an ugly string of words.
BURKE
He's got it in his head that he's

RANDOLPH
Attention, New Yorkers! You are

WIDER
Randolph stands on the table directly in front of the
Kidnet Building.
RANDOLPH
I urge you to listen! It has a

A crowd starts to form on the sidewalk.
RANDOLPH
It's the story of a venomous rhino
and his aggressive campaign to
slander, vilify, defame, denigrate
and villainize my good name! But
one thing he can't do, is take my
life from me. No, friends, only I
have the power to do that!
He reaches down and picks up a can of gasoline.
RANDOLPH
This is what Smoochy has done to

can no longer live in a world
where the innocent suffer and
the wicked thrive!
Randolph raises the can over his head and pauses
dramatically.
RANDOLPH
Where is God??!!
(CONTINUED)
81.
CONTINUED:
He drenches himself with gasoline. The crowd grows
larger. He holds up a pack of matches.
RANDOLPH
I'm sorry to do this, people.
Don't try to talk me out of it.
The crowd starts to applaud.
Randolph looks baffled.
MAN IN CROWD
Do it!
Light it!
RANDOLPH
Our guest of honor will be here
any moment! This is for his eyes!
For his conscience. He'll have to
live with this imagine for the
rest of his miserable life!
Randolph sees the Kidnet limo approaching.
(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED:
RANDOLPH
This is it, folks! It's showtime!
I'm sorry to do this, but he's
left me no choice!
Randolph tries to light another match, but it's wet from
the gasoline. The crowd laughs and starts taunting him.
RANDOLPH
Shut up, you hillbilly assholes!
You're borough trash! Go back to
your huts across the river!
Randolph keeps trying to light the match. Finally, after
several attempts, it lights. He holds it up. The crowd
burst into applause.
RANDOLPH
Fuck you! Fuck all you people! I
was the last of the Mohicans!
You'll never see another Rainbow
Randolph in this lifetime! You
had me and you blew it! All of
you!
He turns and faces the approaching limousine.
RANDOLPH
This if for you, Smoochy!
Remember this! As long as you
live, remember this image! You
did this to me!
He brings the match closer to his gasoline-soaked body.
The limo continues to approach. The crowd taunts him to
do it. He tries to bring the match closer, but his hand
is shaking. Suddenly, a LITTLE GIRL pushes through the
crowd. Everyone quiets down as she looks up at
Randolph.
LITTLE GIRL
Whatcha doin', Rainbow Randolph?
Randolph freezes as he looks down at the Little Girl. A
slight look of hope comes over his face. She smiles
sweetly at him, walks over, and blows out the match.
Randolph is overcome with emotion. Just then, Sheldon's
LIMO WHOOSHES past him. The crowd cheers.
CROWD
Smoochy!!!
(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:
They all run away from Randolph and over to Sheldon's
limo as it pulls in front of the Kidnet Building.
Randolph stares at them blankly. He looks down. The
Little Girl is gone. Sheldon gets out of the limo.
The crowd cheers him as he waves to them before going
inside.
A look of utter frustration now comes over Randolph.
OVERHEAD SHOT
Randolph drops to his knees on the table, looks skyward,
and screams.
RANDOLPH
What does it all mean??!!
The CAMERA RISES ABOVE him as he lets out an anguished
howl that REVERBERATES through the skyscrapers.
In the same frame, detectives and uniformed cops are now
at the scene gathering evidence. Where Spinner once lay,
there is now a bright yellow chalk outline in the shape
of a rhinoceros.
FULL FRAME ON a TELEVISION screen.
A local news anchor
is reading the top story.
ANCHOR (V.O.)
Former heavyweight contender and
restaurateur Lawrence 'Spinner'
Dunn was found shot to death in a
rhinoceros outfit early this
morning in Chinatown. Dunn, a
frequent performer on 'Smoochy's
Magic Jungle,' was pronounced dead
at the scene. Police are
searching for --
A hand ENTERS FRAME and violently slaps the TV OFF.
WIDE
An enraged Merv Green glares at his henchmen, Henry and
MITCH.
MERV
How could you hit the wrong
rhino?!
(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED:
HENRY
Who knew Smoochy had a cousin
Moochy? They look fucking
identical.
MERV
Smoochy is bright orange, Moochy
is burnt rust! Read the papers!
Do I gotta take you back to
fucking kindergarten?
MITCH
All you said was 'hit the rhino.'
You never specified the color.
I'm not taking the blame for this
one.
Merv's anger builds. He turns to a picture of Smoochy
which is tacked to a bulletin board along with other kid
show personalities that the foundation extorts. Merv
picks up a letter opener and violently thrusts it into
the picture.
MERV
I'm not through with you yet,
rhino! Your time will fucking
come!
The news zipper in Times Square glides through the night
air: "MANHUNT UNDERWAY FOR RAINBOW RANDOLPH... SUSPECTED
IN BOXER'S MURDER... SEEN OUTSIDE BUILDING SHORTLY BEFORE
SHOOTING, DRENCHED IN GASOLINE AND ACTING PECULIAR..."
We CRANE DOWN FROM the zipper ONTO the sidewalk.
Randolph is talking on a pay phone. We hear Angelo on
the other end.
RANDOLPH
I didn't do it! I know you're
still mad at me, but you gotta
believe me.
(CONTINUED)
92.
CONTINUED:
ANGELO (V.O.)
The papers say you were the
mastermind.
RANDOLPH
Mastermind? I can barely figure
out how to unzip my pants these
days. Just taking a piss is a
logistical nightmare.
ANGELO (V.O.)
I believe you, Randy. But you
can't come back to my place.
They'll find you. You gotta go
underground.
We are outside the long-abandoned Liberty Biscuit and
Flour factory. The Liberty sign with its Statue of
Liberty logo is eroded and partially missing.
"SMOOCH ON ICE -- SOLD OUT!" flashes on the electronic
marquee.
ACTION
Men, women and children flood in through the turnstiles.
Randolph emerges from a cab and runs through the crowd
outside the Garden. A few people recognize him.
MAN
It's Rainbow Randolph!
Someone
stop him!
Randolph finds a side exit and slips into the arena.
Burke makes a run for it down 33rd Street. A moment
later, Sheldon emerges from the building. He sees Burke
in the distance and takes off after him. He's still in
his skates and wearing the partially-blown-off Smoochy
head.
117.
FURTHER DOWN STREET
Burke looks behind and sees the nightmarish image of a
disfigured Smoochy chasing after him. He quickly rounds
the corner.
A few moments later Sheldon rounds the corner. He looks
down the street and sees no sign of Burke. He notices an
alley by an abandoned building.
Sheldon walks slowly into the alley, gun drawn.
Suddenly, Burke jumps out from behind some boxes. He
whacks Sheldon's head with a garbage can lid. The gun
goes flying. Burke goes for it, but Sheldon is quickly
on his feet and pounces on him. The two men fight it
out. Burke manages to get on top of Sheldon and starts
to strangle him.
BURKE
You fucking point a gun at me? A
gun I gave you as a gift?! Where's
your fucking etiquette?
Just as Sheldon begins to lose consciousness, we hear a
GUNSHOT. Burke looks up. Nora stands there, pointing
Sheldon's gun directly at him.
NORA
Let him go.
Burke just looks at her.
NORA
Now. Before I pump one in that
Grecian Formula scalp of yours.
Burke smirks as he releases Sheldon. Sheldon jumps up
and takes the gun from Nora. He shakily points it at
Burke.
BURKE
You know something, kid? You've
turned out to be an incredible
pain in the ass.
Burke slowly stands up, brushing off his suit.
SHELDON
You were behind the Spinner hit,
weren't you?
(CONTINUED)
118.
CONTINUED:
BURKE
That was a tragic mistake.
(shakes head sadly)
If only one could turn back time...
(beat)
But what the hell, it's just one
less mick in the world.
He laughs.
NORA
You son-of-a-bitch.
Sheldon cocks the gun.
BURKE
Oh my. What are you gonna do?
Kill me? That wouldn't be very
Smoochy-like behavior.
SHELDON
You're right. There's just one
thing...
Sheldon tears off the remains of his tattered costume and
steps out of it.
SHELDON
I'm not Smoochy.
Sheldon is shaking as he extends the gun to Burke's head.
SHELDON
I finally realized we're living in
a different jungle.
Burke suddenly looks fearful, as does Nora.
NORA
No, Sheldon.
Sheldon closes his eyes as he tries to summon up the
courage to pull the trigger.
NORA
Sheldon!
Suddenly, there's a voice from behind.
VOICE (O.S.)
Don't do it, Shel.
Sheldon turns around.
It's Tommy and her boys.
(CONTINUED)
119.
CONTINUED:
SHELDON
(sternly)
Stay out of it, Tommy.
This is my
business.
Tommy walks closer to Sheldon.
TOMMY
No more killin', Shel. Enough's
enough. Don't destroy who you are
for this piece of shit. You mean
something to the kids. Don't take
Smoochy away from the kids.
Tommy extends her hand for the gun. Sheldon looks down
at the gun. He can't believe he's even holding it. He
hands it to Tommy.
SHELDON
I don't know how I got pushed this
far.
TOMMY
You're only human, Shel. The
important thing is... you never
went over the cliff. You're a
good boy. For some of us... it's
too late.
Tommy pats Sheldon's shoulder affectionately.
TOMMY
We'll take it from here, kid, you
run along with your girl. Get on
with your life.
Sheldon looks over at Burke, who's petrified.
SHELDON
Tommy, you're not going to --
TOMMY
Don't worry. Sometimes even a
rat deserves a little mercy.
Sheldon and Nora take a final look at Burke before
walking out of the alley. Burke is wide-eyed with fear
as Tommy's boys advance on him. Just as they round the
corner there is the sound of TWO GUNSHOTS. Sheldon looks
at Nora.
NORA
Bus backfire.
She pats him on the back.
120.
Stokes finally makes it out of the arena. He runs toward
his waiting limo and hops in the back seat. He barks to
his driver through the glass partition.
STOKES
Get out of here!
The car doesn't move.
Stokes pounds on the partition.
STOKES
Move this thing!
No response. Stokes frantically pushes the button that
lowers the partition. It slides down.
STOKES
Are you deaf?! I said --
The driver turns around. Stokes recoils in horror. It's
Takashi. He smiles as the back doors open and the
Japanese thugs -- Chick, Sambo and Tobi -- pile in with
Stokes. They slam the doors shut.
CHICK
I wish I could tell you it'll be
quick and painless, Frank, but you
know how these things go...
Stokes lets out a small whimper. Chick nods to Takashi
who steps on the gas as he sings "Anything Goes" in
Japanese.
The car heads into the night, passing Sheldon and Nora,
who have exited the alley. This will be Frank Stokes'
final limo ride.
Sheldon and Nora pause on the street.
Sheldon looks
around him.
SHELDON
You know, a little grime here and
there doesn't change the fact...
it's still a beautiful city.
He looks at Nora.
(CONTINUED)
121.
CONTINUED:
NORA
Let's go home, Smoochy.
Show's
over.
Sheldon gazes back at her.
SHELDON
No it's not. It's just beginning.
They kiss passionately as MUSIC SWELLS and the CAMERA
CRANES HIGH ABOVE the rink.
FADE OUT.
FADE UP ON:
