      A vast Escheresque cavern, teeming with life. STYLISH 
      HOODLUMS, RAUCOUS TEENAGE GANGSTERS, GARISH HOOKERS, and 
      RAVING LUNATICS are pushed and prodded and wrestled through 
      the system by a beleaguered cohort of COPS. Gordon and 
      Bullock take the Biker to the booking desk SARGEANT...

                                    BULLOCK
                    Next time soldier, don t mess 
                    around. Just drill the sonofabitch. 

                                  GORDON
                    I thought about that. But I figured 
                    I could avoid bloodshed.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Dumb rookie mistake. He could have 
                    killed you. You re a homicide 
                      detective, not a goddamn hero.

                                  GORDON
                    I don t think that--

                                    BULLOCK
                    --You been on the job two weeks. 
                    You don t get to think yet.  Yo, 
                    Sarge, process this creep wouldya. 
                    A and B, resisting.

                                  SARGEANT
                    Oh hey Bullock, good timing. You re 
                    up. Double homicide in the Theater 
                    District.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Gimme a break. Shift s nearly over.                                                                                      5.

                                  SARGEANT
                    Yeah, nearly.  You re up. 

      Bullock curses under his breath. Gordon is good to go...


      Bullock and Gordon enter the near empty diner. The WAITRESS 
      sees Bullock coming and has a cup of coffee poured by the 
      time he and Gordon sit at the counter.   

      Simmering, Bullock drinks coffee and Maalox and a flask of 
      whiskey alternately.  

                                  GORDON
                    Shouldn t we be there when they 
                    move the victims? 

                                  BULLOCK
                    Why? Listen to me hot-shot, in  
                    future, don t start talking to 
                    witnesses until I say so.                                                                                       9.

                                  GORDON
                    But I thought --

                                    BULLOCK
                    -- There you go again. You think 
                    you re a real detective already, 
                    but you re not. You got a badge, 
                    that s all.  And you just caught us 
                      a gigantic flaming ball of crap.   

                                  GORDON
                    How so?

                                    BULLOCK
                    You never heard of Thomas and 
                    Martha Wayne?  

                                  GORDON
                    Sure. The Wayne Foundation.

                                    BULLOCK
                    They re two of the richest, most 
                    powerful people in Gotham. Wayne 
                      Industries runs half the city. 
                    They own the whole Arkham 
                      development zone. They re 
                      kingmakers at City Hall. These 
                    murders are going to turn the city 
                    upside down. You can t even begin 
                    to imagine the pressure if we don t 
                    close this case quick.  

                                  GORDON
                    So let s close it quick.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Yeah right. This is a random street 
                    robbery Holmes. Perp could be 
                    anyone of ten thousand mopes.

      Gordon is a little surprised by Bullock s defeatism. He has a 
      soldier s way of getting to the bottom line.

                                  GORDON
                    So it s a tough case, but we took 
                    the call. It s our case.  

                                    BULLOCK
                    It is now.  Ah crap.

      This last in reaction to RENEE MONTOYA (30s, latina, tightly 
      wound) and CRISPUS ALLEN (30s, African-American, suave, calm 
      and cool) entering the diner. 

                                    BULLOCK (CONT D)
                    Up late, girls?                                                                                     10.

                                  ALLEN
                    Hi, Harvey. 

                                    BULLOCK
                          (to Gordon)
                    Montoya and Allen.  Major Crimes 
                    Unit. My new partner, Jim Gordon.

                                  GORDON
                    Good to meet you.  

      Allen nods. Montoya just studies him coldly. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    You re on the Waynes huh. 
                    Terrible thing.  Any leads?

                                    BULLOCK
                    We just got started.

                                    MONTOYA
                    Tough case.

      Awkward beat.

                                  ALLEN
                    I ll be straight.  You want us to 
                    take it off your hands?

      Gordon is shocked...

                                  GORDON
                    What?  No way--

                                    BULLOCK
                    -- Hold on, rook. 
                          (to Allen)
                    Why d you want it?  You got a lead?

                                  ALLEN
                    Naw.  You know we need the press 
                    action.  MCU s new guy on the 
                    block.  We got to get our name out 
                    there.  This case is just the 
                    ticket.

      Gordon wants to speak, but Bullock holds up a finger to 
      shoosh him. He feigns reluctance...

                                    BULLOCK
                    I don t know...

                                    MONTOYA
                    Come on, Bullock. You don t want 
                    this case. Do the right thing. 

      The words touch a nerve in Bullock and he changes his mind.                                                                                     11.

                                    BULLOCK
                    The right thing? The hell you get 
                    the nerve to say that to me?  The 
                    right thing. I do the right thing 
                    every damn day. Kiss my ass. 

                                  ALLEN
                    Don t be that way, brother. We re 
                    trying to be collegial here.  
                    We can help each other out.

      Bullock s anger overrides his better judgment... 

                                    BULLOCK 
                          (to Montoya, mostly)
                    For a moment there, I almost gave 
                    it to you. But you can t help it 
                    uh? You got to be disrespectful. 
                    I ll give this case to Satan before 
                    I give it to you jackasses. 

      Allen raises his hands in amiable surrender.

                                  ALLEN
                    Oh-kay Harvey. Stay cool. 
                    Good luck.

      Montoya gives both men a cold stare as she and Allen exit. 
      Gordon is puzzled by the heavy tension. Off his sidelong 
      glance to Bullock...


      Gordon driving, Bullock alongside, still seething.          

                                  GORDON
                    Why all the friction with the Major 
                    Crimes Unit?  We re on the same 
                    side.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Exactly. We re rivals. 
                    And they re a buncha self righteous 
                    do gooding skell huggers. 
                      Badmouthing us all the time, we 
                    bend the law, we re cowboys, blah 
                    blah blah. 

                                  GORDON
                    Why do they say that?

                                    BULLOCK
                    Because they want a piece of our 
                    pie, of course. Like they re such 
                    freaking angels? Please.
                          (yells at another driver)
                    What are you blind!? Move!                                                                                     12.

      Off Gordon, not quite satisfied with that reply.


      CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN 

      MAYOR AUBREY JAMES(50 s, charismatic, sincere), is teary-eyed 
      with emotion. 

                                  MAYOR AUBREY JAMES
                    Today we have lost two of Gotham s 
                    finest people. I grieve not just as 
                    Mayor of this great city of ours. 
                    I have lost two close personal 
                    friends. Make no doubt, our Police 
                      Department will catch the punk that 
                    did this. But at moments like this 
                    it can seem like we re losing the 
                    war on crime. My fellow citizens, 
                    we can t and we won t let the 
                    killers and the robbers and the 
                    rapists and the thugs win. Not On 
                    My Watch. I swear to you---

      CAPTAIN SARAH ESSEN(30s, female; sleek, brisk, lawyerly) 
      switches OFF the TV, turns to Bullock and Gordon.

                                    CAPTAIN ESSEN
                    Poor bastard. First a crime wave, 
                    and now this.  At city hall, the  
                    Waynes were like mom and dad, they 
                    kept a fractious family together. 
                    Now they re gone the children are 
                    gonna start squabbling.  It s bad 
                    news for Gotham. Bad news for us. 
                    Everybody in town is going to be on 
                    us like wet paint until we close 
                    this thing. Drop everything else. 
                    Take all the people and resources 
                    you need. Just close. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Yes, boss.
                          (to Gordon)
                    I ll be right with you, Jim.

      Gordon takes the hint, and exits. 

      Gordon s POV from outside the glass walls of the Captain s 
      office: Bullock gestures vehemently, baldly pointing to 
      Gordon and shaking his head. Gordon knows what he s saying... 

      WE GO BACK INSIDE her office...

                                    CAPTAIN ESSEN
                    The answer is no.  Give him a 
                    chance.  It s only been two weeks.                                                                                    13.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Come on, Cap.  Give me anyone, give 
                    me Thumbs Osgood even. This kid  
                    knows nothing. 

                                    CAPTAIN ESSEN
                    That s why they call em rookies. 
                    He was fast tracked for good 
                    reasons. He s smart as hell, his 
                    father was a revered District 
                    Attorney. He s a College football 
                    star, war hero, exemplary beat 
                    cop... 

                                    BULLOCK
                    -- For two years. In the suburbs.  
                    I don t care who his daddy was,    
                    I don t care he s a war hero.
                    I do not need an ignorant fearless 
                    gung ho boy scout in my life. Have 
                    a heart, Cap.

                                    CAPTAIN ESSEN
                          (with a smile)
                    You know I have no heart.  He s a 
                    good man, and he s here to stay.  
                    He just needs to learn from your 
                      experience.  Go do your job please.

      Bullock takes a beat, shrugs, exits...


      And his eyes meet Gordon s, seated at his desk.  Bullock has 
      the grace to look and feel just a tad guilty.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Okay kid, let s go roust some 
                    muggers.

      As they walk out together...

                                  GORDON
                    She said you got to keep me, huh?

      Bullock looks at the kid sideways. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Yeah.  She did. Do me a favor, you 
                    got juice, ask for a transfer.

                                  GORDON
                    No can do. I promised the kid. 
                    I have to stay on this case.

      Bullock thinks this is greenhorn behavior of the worst kind.                                                                                    14.

                                    BULLOCK
                    You promised... Ooof. No offense, 
                    you re a good guy Jimmy.  But this 
                    is not a job for good guys. This is 
                    not a city for good guys. You 
                      understand?

                                  GORDON
                    Not really. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    There s your problem right there.

                                  GORDON
                    I m sorry you re not happy with me. 
                    But I need this job. I like this 
                    job. I want to learn from the best. 
                    And you re the best detective on 
                    this squad. By reputation anyhow. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    What s that anyhow?

                                  GORDON
                    Oh you re way more lackadaisical 
                    than I expected. You wouldn t last 
                    ten minutes in the military.

      Bullock laughs.

                                    BULLOCK
                      Lackadaisical. That s a good word. 
                    You got stones Jimmy boy, I ll give 
                    you that. 



      A RAPID MONTAGE: Forty-eight hours pass as Gordon and Bullock 
      work the streets, alleys, and tenements of Gotham in all it s 
      seedy glory.  Walking, running, driving, knocking on doors, 
      questioning A GALLERY OF GOTHAM LOW-LIFE.  Everyone shakes 
      their head. Nope. Nope. Nope.     

      END MONTAGE:


      EDWARD NYGMA, the resident FORENSICS EXPERT (late 20 s, 
      pleasantly geeky in a white coat, and crossword puzzle tie. 
      Later to become THE RIDDLER. The name tag on his coat say - 
      E. NYGMA) holds a shiny BULLET between his fingers, showing 
      it to Gordon and Bullock, weary frustrated and frowsty.  

                                  NYGMA
                    Guess what this is?                                                                                    15.

                                    BULLOCK
                          (impatiently)
                    Just tell us Ed. I want riddles, 
                    I ll read the funny pages.

                                  NYGMA 
                    45 Caliber three hundred grain 
                      cupronickel wadcutter. Came out of 
                    Thomas Wayne s chest.     

                                  GORDON
                    That s a six dollar bullet. 

                                  NYGMA
                    Yuh huh.  What kind...

      Nygma is about to ask another riddle and struggles with 
      himself to state the facts, as a stutterer might struggle to 
      speak.

                                  NYGMA (CONT D)
                    Wh- It s from a big revolver that 
                    is not in our database. No prints 
                    either.

                                    BULLOCK
                    What else you got?

                                  NYGMA
                    What s nowhere but everywhere 
                    except where something is? 

      Bullock rolls his eyes.

                                  GORDON
                    Nothing?

                                  NYGMA
                    You re quick.

                                    BULLOCK
                    And you re a pain in the ass Nygma.
                          (to Gordon)
                    Let s go.

      Bullock and Gordon head for the street. Nygma looks miffed.

                                  GORDON
                    I m thinking, maybe we do have 
                      something.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Thinking again huh?                                                                                    16.

                                  GORDON
                    Our man wears shiny shoes and uses 
                    high end ammo and nobody on the 
                    street knows who he is. 
                    So maybe he s not from the street. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Oh, like, a debonair playboy 
                    robber?  Does it for kicks?

                                  GORDON
                    Who would pretend to be a street 
                    robber? Either a professional 
                    contract killer or someone with a 
                    personal grudge against the Waynes.   

                                    BULLOCK
                    How did this professional killer 
                    know the Waynes would come down 
                    that alley? 

                                  GORDON
                    Good question.  I don t know.

                                    BULLOCK
                    This is the big city, rook.  Shiny 
                    shoes and fancy bullets don t mean 
                    diddly.

                                  GORDON
                    Where are we going?

                                    BULLOCK
                    Captain Essen told me, we don t get 
                    a break in the first 48, it s time 
                    go see Fish Mooney.

                                  GORDON
                    Fish Mooney? The Gangster?  Works 
                    for Carmine Falcone?

                                    BULLOCK
                    Her. Theater district s her turf.  
                    Anything happens there, she hears 
                    about it. 


        A restaurant night club with a 1920 s High Society theme. 
      Empty except for a PAIR OF DANCERS sexlessly rehearsing a 
      sexy number on stage.  Gordon and Bullock show their badges 
      to a WAITER, who nods respectfully and glides away... 

      As the Waiter exits through a back door, we hear O.S THE 
      SOUND OF A MAN YELLING IN FEAR AND PAIN.  The SOUND CUTS OFF 
      as the door closes.  Gordon looks to Bullock, who shrugs.


      Mooney enters glowing, as if she s just finished a game of 
      tennis.  While the door s open, the SOUND of Raoul HOWLING 
      can again be heard.  Bullock pays no mind. Gordon is curious. 

      Mooney and Bullock embrace like old friends. 

                                  MOONEY
                    Harvey, you bad man.  Where have you 
                    been so long?  Who s your friend?

                                  GORDON
                    Detective James Gordon, Ma am.    

                                    BULLOCK
                    New boy.

                                  MOONEY
                    James.  Aren t you a cool glass of 
                    milk.                                                                                     19.

                                  GORDON
                    Ma am, was that screaming we heard 
                    back there?

                                  MOONEY
                    Yes. My boys are watching a scary 
                    movie.

                                  GORDON
                    Really.

                                  MOONEY
                    No, I m messing with you.  One of 
                    my staff has been stealing from me.
                    We re beating his punk ass. 

                                  GORDON 
                          (surprised by her candor)
                    Oh. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Relax junior.  Fish gets some 
                    leeway.  Her staff are rough 
                      characters, need firm handling.

      Gordon frowns, doesn t like the notion of leeway.

                                  MOONEY
                    So this isn t a social visit then.

                                    BULLOCK
                    The brass told me to come talk to 
                    you. About the Wayne murders.   

                                  MOONEY
                    Hmmm. Terrible thing.

                                    BULLOCK
                    We need your help.  We need a name. 

                                  MOONEY
                    I can ask around.

      Gordon is still gazing anxiously at the door. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Tell you what, Jim.  If you re 
                    worried, go on back there and see 
                    if anybody wants to press charges. 
                    That okay with you, Fish?

                                  MOONEY
                    Sure.  Knock yourself out kid.

      Gordon shrugs, okay.  He heads to the back of the club.  
      Bullock and Mooney continue talking, but WE FOLLOW Gordon as 
      he exits through the service door.                                                                                    20.


      Gordon follows the SOUND of a BEATING...


      Gordon returns to the table where Bullock and Mooney are deep 
      in quiet conversation. They stop talking and smile at Gordon 
      as he approaches.

                                    BULLOCK
                    All good?

      Gordon just nods. Bullock stands up to leave.

                                    BULLOCK (CONT D)
                    It was good to see you Fish. Hope 
                    to hear from you soon.

                                  MOONEY
                    You never know.

      They kiss goodbye on the mouth.  


      A SPECTACULAR VIEW OF GOTHAM through wall to wall picture 
      windows. A symphony of stone, steel and glass.

      We find Gordon looking out at this view, deep in thought. 

      BARBARA KEAN (late 20 s, sunny, sophisticated) enters from 
      her bedroom looking gorgeous in a cocktail dress, and greets 
      Gordon with a kiss and a radiant smile. She has the gift and 
      burden of luminous grace. All her life, she s been coveted, 
      pursued. For her, Gordon is a protector - honest and strong. 

                                  GORDON
                    Wow.

                                    BARBARA
                    And look at you in your excellent 
                    suit.  I am so happy you don t have 
                    to wear that silly uniform anymore.

                                  GORDON
                    You told me it looked good.

                                    BARBARA
                    I lied, baby.  Drink before we go?  

                                  GORDON
                    Barbara, I m beat.  Do we really 
                    have to go to this thing?

                                    BARBARA
                    No, of course not. What bliss.     
                    You know I looove bailing. 

      She kicks off her heels. Gordon slumps onto a sofa. Barbara 
      looks at him with fond concern. 

      Barbara curls up with him on the sofa.

                                    BARBARA (CONT D)
                    Talk to me.

                                  GORDON
                    We re getting nowhere on the Wayne 
                    case. I made a promise to Bruce 
                    Wayne and I can t deliver on it. 
                    Now I feel like a fraud.

                                    BARBARA
                    But you re not.                                                                                    23.

                                  GORDON
                    I was nine when we left Gotham 
                    after my dad died and I really 
                    didn t want to go. I was a city 
                    boy. But my mom needed to be near 
                    her parents upstate, so you know... 
                    The country was okay. But Gotham, 
                    in my mind, it became this magical 
                    scary mysterious place where my 
                    family was happy and my father did 
                    heroic things. I always knew I d 
                    come back here and work for the 
                    law, like my father did. I know 
                    this is my place.  But now I m 
                    here, I feel like I m playing a 
                    game with rules that everyone knows 
                    but me. I m out of my depth. 

      Familiar with Gordon s hardness on himself, she gives him a 
      consoling kiss.

                                    BARBARA 
                          (blithely)
                    Jim, you are the cleverest, 
                    bravest, goodest man in Gotham. 
                    I very much doubt you are out of 
                    your depth. Even if you are, you 
                    know how to swim don t you? 

                                  GORDON 
                          (smiles)
                    Yes I do.

                                    BARBARA
                    So alright then. You don t have to 
                    rid the city of crime on your own 
                    all at once today. You can swim 
                    around a little first and get your 
                    bearings. And I bet you catch 
                    someone for the Wayne murders soon. 
                    I can feel it.
                    Are you hungry?

      Gordon nods, cheering up. Barbara could make a stone smile.


      Barbara cooks an Italian dinner and James helps. 

                                    BARBARA
                    Pass the radicchio, would you?

                                  GORDON
                    The who?

      Barbara gets it herself.                                                                                    24.

                                    BARBARA
                    When I m Mrs. Gordon I m going to 
                    teach you how to cook.

                                  GORDON
                    I know how to cook. 

                                    BARBARA
                    Applying heat to things until 
                    they re soft is not cooking.

                                  GORDON
                    That s most of it. You figured we 
                    would live here? 

                                    BARBARA
                    Why not? It s free. Dad-- My father 
                      practically said it s mine, really.  

                                  GORDON
                    Yeah, but it s his. I figured we d 
                    live somewhere we can afford on the 
                    wages of a cop and an ER doctor.

                                    BARBARA
                    But that ll be somewhere pokey and 
                    sad, won t it? Why not stay here 
                    where it s nice?  Isn t it nice 
                    here?

                                  GORDON
                    Yes it is...

                                    BARBARA
                    Well then...

      They kiss, and after a while, start to undress each other.  
      The food on the stove is left to cook away unattended. 


      Chinese food on the coffee table.  Gordon and Barbara 
      entwined asleep on the sofa. Gordon s PHONE BUZZES.  He 
      wakes, finds the phone. 

      INTERCUT WITH:


      A dark underground dive. In a booth, flanked by HOOKERS and a 
      DRUG DEALER, Bullock is on his mobile phone. 

                                    BULLOCK 
                    Got a lead.  Meet me at Fourth and 
                    Grundy.                                                                                     25.

                                  GORDON
                    On my way.

      Bullock drains a glass of whiskey, slams it down.

      Gordon tiptoes out, leaving Barbara sleeping peacefully. 


      Gordon and Bullock climb the decrepit dimly lit stairs, and 
      take up positions on either side of an apartment door. 

                                    BULLOCK (V.O.)
                    ...Career street thug.  Long sheet 
                    for robbery, assault, rape, drug 
                    dealing, extortion.

      Gordon KNOCKS firmly.  No reply.  KNOCKS again.                                                                                     26.

      The door cracks open, and a little girl -- IVY -- (10, red 
      headed, feral, skinny) appears.  A chain bolt holds the door.

                                  GORDON
                    Hi.  What s your name?

                                  IVY
                    Ivy.

                                  GORDON
                    Ivy, is there a grown-up home that 
                    we can talk to?

                                  IVY
                    Momma s asleep.

                                  GORDON
                    Just Momma?  Is Daddy home?

                                  IVY
                    Yeah.  But you don t want to talk 
                    to Daddy.

                                  GORDON
                    Why s that, Ivy?

                                  IVY 
                          (whispers)
                    He s mean.

      Just then, thumping FOOTSTEPS... Ivy scampers away and the 
      door is off the chain and opened wide, revealing MARIO PEPPER 
      as advertised, big and scarey.  He knows cops instantly. 

                                  GORDON
                    Mister Pepper?  We need to talk.

                                  MARIO PEPPER
                    I ve done nothing. 

                                  GORDON
                    Then it ll be a pleasant 
                      conversation.  


      The spartan front room is brightened by an array of thriving 
      POTTED PLANTS of various colorful kinds.

      At a plain table, Pepper sits next to his wife ALICE, (30 s, 
      haggard).  She s jittery, and she has a black eye.  Gordon 
      and Bullock sit opposite.

                                  GORDON
                    Mario, where were you last Saturday 
                    night at around nine-thirty?                                                                                     27.

                                  MARIO PEPPER
                    I was here at home with my family.

                                  ALICE PEPPER
                    Th-that s that s right.  He was here. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Why are you so nervous, Alice?

                                  ALICE PEPPER
                    Because you re hassling us in the 
                    middle of the night. 

                                  MARIO PEPPER
                    What s this about?

                                    BULLOCK
                    It s about a pearl necklace.  Four 
                    strands.  Gold fittings.  Does that 
                    sound familiar?

                                  MARIO PEPPER
                    No. 

                                    BULLOCK 
                    So you won t mind if we take a look 
                    around the place?

      Both Peppers look worried at that. 

                                  MARIO PEPPER
                    You need a warrant.

                                  GORDON
                    You re a felon on parole.  We just 
                    need reasonable cause.

                                  MARIO PEPPER
                    You got no reasonable cause.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Sure we do.

                                  MARIO PEPPER
                    I m just trying to do the right 
                    thing. I m just trying to feed my 
                    family. Why are you picking on me?

      With that, Pepper throws the table over on top of the two 
      detectives and dashes from the room.  Alice flings herself 
      flailing and screaming at Gordon and Bullock, delaying them 
      as they scramble up. Gordon extricates himself first and 
      follows Pepper.

      BACK BEDROOM -- Gordon enters as Pepper disappears up the 
      fire escape.  Gordon follows.                                                                                    28.

      FRONT ROOM -- Bullock has to use violence to subdue and cuff 
      Alice.  Then Ivy comes charging in and attacks him with a 
      KITCHEN KNIFE.  


      VARIOUS SHOTS -- A careful search by a team of SPECIALIST 
      COPS in gloves and protective clothing. 

    IN THE BEDROOM -- a SPECTACLED COP pulls a gym bag from under 
    the bed.  Opens it to find a jiffy bag of white powder.  
      Holding it up for a better look, the Cop sees there s 
      something else in the bag.  He opens the bag and pulls out    
      Martha Wayne s FOUR STRAND PEARL NECKLACE.  

                                  SPECTACLED COP
                    Yo, Sarge! 


      Gordon and Bullock enter to CHEERS and an irreverent standing 
      ovation from their colleagues. Gordon can t help smiling.


      Essen smiles broadly at Gordon and Bullock...

                                  ESSEN
                    Well done guys. We needed this one.

                                  GORDON
                    I wish we could have taken him alive.                                                                                     30.

                                  ESSEN
                    Stuff happens.  But when you speak 
                    to the media, that s a great angle 
                    to play.  You wish you could have 
                    taken him alive.  


      CLOSE ON A STACK OF NEWSPAPERS hitting the floor of a 
      newsstand.  The screaming HEADLINE -- HERO COPS DROP WAYNE 
      KILLER!  Beneath the headline are Weegee-style PHOTOS of 
      Pepper s corpse and the two GCPD Detectives. Gordon looks 
      proud and happy. 

      THIS BEGINS A MONTAGE OF PRESS PHOTOS: 

      Heroes of the hour - Gordon and Bullock speaking at a press 
      conference. Shaking hands with Mayor James. Bullock pointing 
      out Pepper s death site.  Gordon smiling into the camera 
      alongside Barbara at a charity ball. The last image is a 
      PHOTO of Bruce Wayne. The caption states - WAYNE FUNERAL ON 
      SUNDAY.


      Crispus Allen of the MCU is behind the wheel, Renee Montoya 
      alongside.  Not expecting much from this meeting...

                                  OSWALD
                    What a great pleasure to see you 
                    again, Mr. Allen, mizz Montoya.  

                                    MONTOYA
                    Whatcha got?

                                  OSWALD
                    As you know, I am a close associate 
                    of Fish Mooney.

                                    MONTOYA
                    No disrespect, aren t you more of a 
                    dogsbody?

                                  OSWALD
                    I beg to differ. Be that as it may.  
                    You may trust me when I tell you 
                    that Mario Pepper was framed by 
                    Fish Mooney and the cops.                                                                                     31.

                                  ALLEN
                    You got our attention. 

                                  OSWALD
                    I saw miss Mooney with Martha 
                    Wayne s pearl necklace. She was 
                      discussing how to get it into 
                    Pepper s home, inside a bag of 
                    drugs.  This was shortly after she 
                    met with Detectives Bullock and 
                    Gordon from the homicide squad. 

                                  ALLEN
                    She had the necklace huh?  Mooney 
                    works for Carmine Falcone. Are you 
                    saying Falcone had the Waynes 
                    killed? 

                                  OSWALD
                    That I cannot tell. I don t know 
                    how Mooney acquired the necklace.
                    I am conveying only what I can 
                    vouch for honestly.  

                                    MONTOYA
                    Why snitch on your own boss?

                                  OSWALD
                    Public spirit, sir.  That poor 
                    orphan boy pricked my conscience.

                                  ALLEN
                    You want Fish pushed out huh?  
                    You think Butch Gilzean would make 
                    a better boss for you?  

      Oswald scowls. Allen is right. He hates it when ordinary 
      mortals guess his intentions.

                                  OSWALD
                    Miss Mooney has been rude and 
                      disrespectful to me, but that is 
                    beside the point. I am doing my 
                    civic duty.  Good day to you both. 

      Oswald gets out of the car and waddles away.

                                  ALLEN
                    Looks just exactly like a penguin 
                    doesn t he? 

                                    MONTOYA
                    Yes he does.

                                  ALLEN
                    But I think he s telling the truth.                                                                                    32.

      Off Oswald Cobblepot...


      Barbara in scrubs, tying off a bandage on a LITTLE KID s leg.

                                    BARBARA
                    There you go, Joey.

      She claps the little kid on the back, sends him on his way.  
      She sees Renee Montoya walk in.  Barbara s not thrilled to 
      see her, but puts on a decent show of pleasure.  They hug. 

                                    BARBARA (CONT D)
                    Renee, long time. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    Yeah.  How you been?

                                    BARBARA
                    Good, great. And you?

                                    MONTOYA
                    All good. 

                                    BARBARA
                    I m engaged. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    I heard.  James Gordon.  That s 
                    kinda why I m here. Can we talk 
                    someplace private?


      Barbara gazes out at the city, still in her funeral clothes, 
      CRYING. Gordon comes out on the terrace.

                                  GORDON
                    Barbara, what s wrong?  Barbara?

      Long beat. She looks at him imploringly.

                                    BARBARA
                    Did you frame Mario Pepper?                                                                                    36.

                                  GORDON
                    What?!  No.  What? 

                                    BARBARA
                    I knew it. I knew you couldn t lie 
                    to that poor boy.

                                  GORDON
                    Who told you Pepper was framed?

                                    BARBARA
                    It doesn t matter.  As long as it s 
                    not true. 

                                  GORDON
                    It s not. Who told you it was?  

                                    BARBARA
                    Just gossip in the ER. We get a lot 
                    of street criminals. 

                                  GORDON
                    But that s not where you heard it.

                                    BARBARA
                    That s where I heard it.

                                  GORDON
                    Bee, I can tell when you re lying.

                                    BARBARA
                    Stop being a detective.

                                  GORDON 
                      A detective is what I am. Tell me. 

                                    BARBARA
                    I ran into an old friend from City 
                    College.  Renee Montoya.


      Gordon and Bullock have desks that face each other. 
      Bullock looks quizzically at Gordon, who is nervously rolling 
      a miniature desk football in his hands.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Framed?  How you figure that?  You 
                    were there.  We framed him?

                                  GORDON
                    No.  But somebody could have 
                    planted the necklace on Pepper for 
                    us to find.  Fish Mooney could have 
                    set the whole thing up.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Why?

                                  GORDON
                    To cover up for the real killer.  
                    Mooney works for Falcone. Maybe 
                    Falcone wanted the Waynes dead. 
                    Maybe there was a conspir-

                                    BULLOCK
                    --For chrissakes, why would such a 
                    nutty idea even enter your head? 

                                  GORDON
                    Montoya from the MCU told me that -- 

                                    BULLOCK
                          (erupting in anger)
                    -- That drunk-ass pillhead dike 
                      loonybird? Shit.  Why the hell are 
                    you listening to her? 

                                  GORDON
                    Of course I m listening.  Am I 
                    supposed to ignore her when she 
                    tells me the MCU has proof of a 
                    frame up?  I promised Bruce Wayne 
                    that I would find the truth--- 

                                    BULLOCK
                    --Never mind Bruce Wayne. 
                    What s Montoya s proof?

                                  GORDON
                    Wouldn t tell me. Didn t trust me.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Bah, they ve got nothing.  If they 
                    did, they d use it.                                                                                     39.

                                  GORDON
                    You don t think we should take a 
                    second look?  We could talk to the 
                    fence that gave Mooney the tip.

                                    BULLOCK
                      Supposing, just supposing Pepper 
                    was innocent. I killed him.  

                                  GORDON
                    We killed him.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Yeah. We killed him. And we d have 
                    to pay. We d lose our jobs at the 
                    very least. The case is closed. 
                    Forget about it. You hear me? 
                    Forget about it.

      Off Gordon, unhappy...


      Gordon and Barbara in bed, both reading books distractedly. 

                                    BARBARA
                    Did you speak to Renee Montoya?

                                  GORDON
                    Yes, I did.

                                    BARBARA
                          (sidelong glance)
                    And?  How did it go?

                                  GORDON
                    She said sorry.  They were 
                    mistaken.  Once they looked into 
                    things.

      Barbara s relieved that Montoya apparently revealed nothing 
      of their old love affair.

                                    BARBARA
                    Oh good, that s great, right?

                                  GORDON
                    Yes.

      Off Gordon, filled with guilt and confusion.


      Not open yet, the place is deserted.  Oswald is working on 
      account books at one of the tables.

                                  GORDON
                    Oswald, right?

                                  OSWALD
                    How nice to see you again Detective 
                    Gordon.  Can I help you?

                                  GORDON
                    I need to speak with Mooney.

                                  OSWALD
                    Regarding what shall I say?

                                  GORDON
                    Mario Pepper.

                                  OSWALD
                          (twitching)
                    I don t wish to be impertinent, but 
                      um...Um... May I ask why?

                                  GORDON
                    No.  

                                  OSWALD 
                    Yes, no. Ha ha. None of my business 
                    is it?  Um....  

                                  GORDON
                    Go tell Miss Mooney I m here.   

      Oswald abruptly switches demeanor, to hissing menace...   

                                  OSWALD
                    Get out of here you fool!  Scram!

                                  GORDON
                    Whoa. Why are you so upset?

      Before Oswald can reply, Mooney emerges from a back room with 
      two HENCHMEN. She sees the tension between Gordon and Oswald.

                                  MOONEY
                    Well well, Gordon, was it?  You 
                    seem a little wired. Something 
                    wrong?

                                  GORDON
                    I m not sure yet. I have some 
                    questions I need to ask you.

      Mooney throws a sharp glance to Oswald.                                                                                     41.

                                  MOONEY
                      Intriguing.  I have a couple 
                    minutes.  Come ask me questions. 

      A MOMENT LATER IN A CORNER BOOTH...  

                                  MOONEY (CONT D)
                    So. 

                                  GORDON
                    What s the name of the fence who 
                    gave you Mario Pepper?

                                  MOONEY 
                    Why do you ask?

                                  GORDON
                    I m looking into allegations that  
                    Pepper was framed. 

                                  MOONEY
                          (genuinely puzzled)
                    Framed.  Is this a gag? 

                                  GORDON
                    No. 

      Mooney takes a beat. WTF is this guy s game?

                                  MOONEY
                    Who told you there was a frame?

                                  GORDON
                    Was there a frame?

                                  MOONEY
                    Why would anyone frame Pepper? 

                                  GORDON
                    As part of a cover up. The Waynes 
                    had alot of power in this city. 
                    Maybe somebody had the Waynes 
                    killed so that they could take that 
                    power for themselves.   

                                  MOONEY
                    Huh. And if they did?

                                  GORDON
                    I ll follow the evidence wherever 
                    it leads. 

                                  MOONEY
                    A regular little tornado of 
                    justice, huh.  Harvey doesn t know 
                    you re here, does he?                                                                                    42.

                                  GORDON
                    No.  Why do you ask? 

                                  MOONEY
                    James, James, you got so much going 
                    for you.  You re a likeable fella.   
                    You talk well.  You look good.     
                    A war hero for chrissakes. It s a 
                    damn shame you re so dumb.

      Mooney picks up the table lamp and smashes it over Gordon s 
      head, then jumps on him, taking off her shoes to use as 
      weapons. Gordon tries to defend himself, but Mooney s 
      Henchmen join in and he s beaten unconscious.


      Barbara appears in the doorway.  She s never been here before 
      and looks around lost, until she finds Bullock. 

                                    BARBARA
                    Detective Bullock.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Mizz Kean.

                                    BARBARA
                    I can t get a hold of James.  Not 
                    since this morning.  Have you heard 
                    from him?  

                                    BULLOCK
                    No. I thought he was with you.

                                    BARBARA
                    No. I m worried about him. 

      Bullock s now worried himself, but doesn t want to worry her.

                                    BULLOCK 
                    Oh, wait, I remember now. He s on a 
                    stake out. His phone probably ran 
                    out of juice. 

                                    BARBARA
                    Oh. Well, that s a relief. I feel 
                    silly now for worrying. Thank you. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    No problemo.

      Barbara leaves. Bullock looks deeply torn. He picks up 
      Gordon s desk football, squeezes it. 

                                    BULLOCK (CONT D)
                    You dumbass boy scout sonofabitch.  
                    You didn t listen to me did you?                                                                                    43.

      Bullock takes a beat. He decides to do the right thing... 

                                    BULLOCK (CONT D)
                    Damn.

      He exits, hurling the football at an unsuspecting cop. 


      Gordon wakes in the trunk of a moving car.  His face is 
      battered and bloody, hands tied behind his back.

      Gordon wriggles around until he can get the right angle and 
      starts kicking the trunk lid as hard as he can.    


      Gordon listens intently.

                                  HENCHMAN (O.S.)
                    You want us to wet him down?

                                  GILZEAN (O.S.)
                    No, wait.  But be ready.

    The SOUND of the CAR DOORS OPENING and men getting out.


      Fish Mooney at a table, eating a sandwich and listening to a 
      COMEDIAN (20 s, skinny, ginger, big smile) audition on the 
      little stage.  Oswald is hovering nearby.  

                                  COMEDIAN
                    ...I m in the park.  There s this 
                    lady with a cute dog.  I ask her, 
                    does your dog bite?  She says no, 
                    so I pat the dog and it bites me.

                    I say to the lady, you said your 
                    dog doesn t bite. She says, that s 
                    not my dog. 

      Mooney laughs.  Her PHONE BUZZES.  She answers.

      SPLIT SCREEN WITH:


      Mooney smiles wanly at Oswald as he hands her a water glass.

                                  MOONEY 
                    Bless your heart.

      She gulps down a handful of pills, and feels better.   

                                  MOONEY (CONT D)
                    Be a treasure and rub my neck. 

                                  OSWALD
                    Of course, boss.

      Mooney waves at the Comedian... 

                                  MOONEY
                    Give me a moment, kid.  I haven t 
                    forgotten you. I like you.  You re 
                    funny.

      Oswald rubs her neck.  She groans in relief. 

                                  MOONEY (CONT D)
                    Ah that s good.  Right there. 
                          (beat, casual)
                    Let me ask you a question. 
                    What d you think s gonna happen now 
                    that the Waynes are dead?

                                  OSWALD
                    Well, I don t know.

                                  MOONEY
                    Ah you re being modest. You re a 
                    smart guy. You know with the Waynes 
                    gone, this city is up for grabs.  
                    Falcone can t live forever. I play 
                    my cards right I can run this town. 

                                  OSWALD
                    Yes yes, I see.                                                                                    48.

                                  MOONEY
                    Course you do. You re smart.
                          (beat)
                    You re like a son to me, you know 
                    that Oswald?

                                  OSWALD
                    You ve been like a mother to me.   

                                  MOONEY
                    I have.  I have been like a mother 
                    to you. Which is what I don t 
                      understand. After all I ve done for 
                    you, and just when I m on the verge 
                    of great things, you betray me? 
                    What kind of low-life scum betrays 
                    their own mother? 

      Oswald stops rubbing her neck.

                                  OSWALD
                    I I I don t know what you mean. 

                                  MOONEY
                    You snitched to the MCU.  It was 
                    you.  You saw me with the pearls.  
                    Nobody else did. 

      He backs up.  She stalks him across the room.  

                                  OSWALD
                    Gilzean saw you too!  It was 
                    Gilzean!  He s the snitch. 

                                  MOONEY
                    No. Gilzean is loyal.

                                  OSWALD
                    So am I.  I would die for you,      
                    I swear.  I d open a vein right 
                    here and now if you asked me to.

      Mooney has backed Oswald into a corner of the room. She picks 
      up a STEAK KNIFE from a dining table, offers it to Oswald. 

                                  MOONEY
                    Go on then.  Open one.

                                  OSWALD
                    I, I was speaking poetically. 

                                  MOONEY 
                          (taunting)
                    Prove it for me penguin. Prove your 
                    loyalty.                                                                                    49.

      Piqued by the hated name, Oswald pretends to cringe, and 
      takes the knife reluctantly...

                                  OSWALD
                    Please Miss Mooney, pleaase don t-- 

      And he lunges at Mooney with the knife.  But Mooney s waiting 
      for him. She avoids the lunge, picks up a chair and batters 
      Oswald to the floor.  

                                  OSWALD (CONT D)
                            (semi-conscious)
                    Please don t call me that...

      Mooney smiles at the Comedian, frozen in terror onstage. 

                                  MOONEY
                    So sorry.  Go on.
                          (beat)
                    Go on!

                                  COMEDIAN
                    Um..... You re a wonderful  
                    audience.  Not like last night. 
                    My God, the abuse, it was terrible. 
                    I m like Mom, Dad, please. Gimme a 
                    break, I m working here. 

      Mooney laughs.


      A big dank barn, lined on one side with livestock pens.     
      On the other side, big rolling motorised doors.  

      In one pen, there are several angry half starved PIGS. In the 
      next pen, separated by a double bolted gate, Gordon and 
      Bullock are HANGING UPSIDE DOWN FROM CHAINS attached to a 
      winch. Bullock is coming round as we join them. He focuses 
      blearily on Gordon. Both men are revolving slowly.   

                                    BULLOCK
                    How you doing?

                                  GORDON
                    Been better. 

      Bullock sees the pigs.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Oh Jesus Christ. 

                                  GORDON
                    Yeah. I m going to try and swing 
                    over to you. Maybe I can untie you.                                                                                    50.

                                    BULLOCK
                    You do that. Jesus Christ. 

      Gordon starts trying to swing...

                                  GORDON
                    Thanks for trying to help. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Wish I hadn t now.

                                  GORDON
                    Don t blame you. I wish you d told 
                    me the truth.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Shut up and swing wouldya please.

      Gordon is swinging well now, closer and closer to Bullock.       
      He reaches out and manages to grab Bullock s arms and then 
      tries to haul himself up to Bullock s roped ankles...

      CLANG - a bank of overhead lights come on. Gilzean and two 
      Henchmen enter. One of them - SERGIO - is carrying a camera 
      on a tripod, which he sets up by the pen. 

                                    BULLOCK (CONT D)
                    Butch, listen to me--- 

                                    GILZEAN
                    ---Yeah, sorry, no. If it was up to 
                    me, you d get a bullet in the head, 
                    and a decent funeral. But Fish has 
                    her ways. 

      Gilzean starts unbolting the gate that separates the pigs 
      from Gordon and Bullock. The animals squeal and snort in 
        anticipation...

                                    GILZEAN (CONT'D)
                    You ready?  

                                  SERGIO
                    One sec.

                                    GILZEAN
                      Christsake.

                                  SERGIO
                    It s a new camera.  Okay.  Ready.

      Gordon keeps methodically trying to get free, although he 
      knows it s useless.  Bullock squirms in helpless anger...

                                    BULLOCK
                    I hope you die of cancer you 
                    miserable piece of crap!                                                                                     51.

      Gilzean tries to open the last bolt on the gate. But it s 
      rusty and stiff... 

      Right then, the large rolling doors of the slaughterhouse 
      start sliding open; revealing a gleaming BLACK LIMO, lights 
      blazing, motor running.  The limo doors open. THREE MAFIA 
      HARD MEN and CARMINE FALCONE get out and enter the 
        slaughterhouse.  

      Gilzean is shocked and a little scared.

                                    GILZEAN
                    Don Falcone.  I m honored to uh...

      He falls silent.  Falcone looks him over mildly.

                                    FALCONE 
                    Forgive me young man, I forget what 
                    your name is. Or perhaps I never 
                    knew it.  Please release these men 
                    and give them water.   


      Barbara opens the door to her apartment and finds Gordon 
      there, swaying on his feet, looking like bloody hell.

                                    BARBARA
                    Oh my God.  
                          (embraces him)
                    I ve been so worried.  What 
                    happened to you? 
                          (no reply)
                    James? 

      He holds her tighter. Tears welling in his eyes.  She asks no 
      more and just holds him, stroking his hair. 


      Gordon sits opposite Bruce. Alfred sits a few feet behind his 
      young master. Gordon is taken aback by the dark fire in the 
      boy s eyes. 

                                  GORDON
                    It s good to see you.

                                  BRUCE
                    And you.

                                  GORDON
                    Why were you up on the roof?

                                  ALFRED 
                    He wants me in the loony bin, 
                    that s why.  

      Bruce gives Alfred a look - remember who s boss here .

                                  BRUCE
                    I m learning to conquer fear.

                                  GORDON
                      I understand.  But fear tells you 
                    where the edge is. Fear is a good 
                    thing. It doesn t need conquering.

                                  ALFRED
                    Think I haven t told him that?

                                  BRUCE
                      I disagree. You came here for a 
                    reason, I imagine.

                                  GORDON
                    Yes. I did. I uh... I ve discovered 
                    some things that I need to tell 
                    you. Mario Pepper didn t kill your 
                    parents.  He was framed.  By the 
                    police department and the mob.  
                    Working together.  

      Bruce Wayne nods calmly and glances at Alfred, like that s a 
      possibility they discussed.

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    Carmine Falcone told me Pepper was 
                    framed only so that the public 
                    would feel safe.  He said there was 
                    no conspiracy to kill your parents. 
                    But I m not sure if I believe him. 

                                  BRUCE
                    Why not?                                                                                    59.

                                  GORDON
                    I m not sure of anything anymore, 
                    except that Gotham is headed for 
                    hard times, and I want to help.
                    So I m going to leave my next step 
                    up to you. 

      Gordon takes out his Detective s badge and hands it to Bruce.

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    I can resign from the police force 
                    today and go public with the whole 
                    story. Or I can stay on the force 
                    and fight for change from the 
                    inside. I don t know which path is 
                    best.  So I ll let you decide. 
                    Either way, I ll do my best to find 
                    out who really killed your parents. 
                    Like I promised.  

      A long beat as Bruce considers...

                                  BRUCE
                    Thanks for being honest with me. 
                    Gotham needs honest men. I think 
                    you should stay on the force and 
                    fight.

      He hands the badge back to Gordon.
