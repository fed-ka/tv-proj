  Other CUSTOMERS notice he s losing it and back up.  The

  Blood covers the floor.  Another CUSTOMER gets Call in a choke 
  hold, but he STABS him too.  They re slipping in blood as the 
  fight grows.  It s five against one and that one is winning.

  The Bank Guard finds the mess.  He pulls out his gun.  He and 
  another customer PULL Call away from the others, but Call GRABS 
  the GUN and in the struggle, SHOOTS both men.  The gun shots are 
    deafening.  A bullet HITS the Pharmacist s computer.  She ducks, 
  others scatter. Call, gun in hand, backs away.  He assesses what 
  he s done and RUNS down an aisle and out the front door.

                Stay still. 

  Hotch hits the alarm.  It beeps three times and blinks red.

                Ready?

  Hotch grabs his go-bag.  Prentiss hangs back. Hotch holds the 
  door open for her.  As they head out --

  Hotch sees Reid s leg propped up.  He teases --

                Call s proving hard to track. He 
                never had a driver s license, so 
                he s probably still on foot.

                He s not gonna get on a bus.  His

                What s the stressor?   

                                GARCIA (V.O.)
                He just lost his job.  Worked in a 
                factory since 1990.  He made 
                  appliances forever. Not a single

                                GARCIA (V.O.)
                  Actually, he s more like a hermit.  
                Far as I can tell he s got no one.  
                No wife, no children, no parents.  *

                                MORGAN 
                Nothing to live for. 

  Hotch kind of snaps, but it s a legitimate question:  

                              HOTCH
                Then why didn t he kill himself? 

  Prentiss and Rossi share a look. Hotch stares at Morgan.

                              REID
                Because he s not finished yet. 

  This gets Hotch s attention.  He focuses on Reid. 

                              REID (cont'd)
                He s obviously got displaced anger

  JJ pins up CSPs on the cork board next to maps of Louisville and 
  Jefferson County, Kentucky.  

  An OFFICER studies the SECURITY FOOTAGE as it s played and re-
  played on a television.  

  There s a lot of energy in here, mostly due to the fired-up 
    LIEUTENANT KEVIN MITCHELL.  He and Reid stand in front of a 
  circled map of Louisville and TWO DOZEN law enforcement 
  personnel from the city, county and state.  

                              MITCHELL
                I ve got check points at the state 
                line, on I-65, and within a twenty 
                mile radius of downtown.  We think 
                he s still on foot.  

                              REID
                It s been just under three hours 
                with a walking foot speed of two 
                point five miles per hour which 
                rounds up to an eight mile radius.  

  Mitchell refers to the map and it s circled eight mile radius.

                We ve concentrated here. The first

                search of businesses and residences 
                within that eight miles. You re

  Mitchell refers to an evidence board dedicated to Darrin Call s

  The console television BLARES a baseball game.  Young Call comes 
  in the front door.  Young Jarvis is drunk in his chair.

  BILL JARVIS, now 65, sits in the same chair in front of another 
  baseball game.  Call and the boy stand there.  Jarvis turns, 
  exposing the nasty scar his son gave him years ago.

                I knew you d come home.

  FADE IN:


  The TV s off.  It s quiet.  Call holds the gun on Jarvis.  He 
  puts Ryan s hands on the gun too.  

                              CALL
                We can both do it.  

  Hotch walks inside.  Call trains his gun on Hotch.

  Call moves to the boy.  The gun a constant threat.

  Hotch moves between Call and the boy.

                We re gonna get him back for what

  The boy s scared.

                You should let Tommy go.  He *
                doesn t need to see this.  

  Call points the gun at Bill again. 

                              CALL 
                He should die.  

                              HOTCH
                He should. 

  Call cocks the gun. 

                              HOTCH (cont'd)
                But you shoot him, you ve got 
                nothing. No answers. I thought you 
                wanted the truth.  

  Call turns the gun on Hotch again.  

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Call s gun still aimed at Hotch.  The boy sits still.  

                              HOTCH
                Go ahead.  Ask him.  

                              CALL
                Why did you hurt those kids?  

                              BILL JARVIS
                What kids?  

  Call loses it.  

                              CALL 
                The ones we buried.  

                              BILL JARVIS
                You re confused.  

  Call hits his head with one hand.  The gun still in the other. 
  Hotch tries to calm him by focussing on Bill instead.  

                              HOTCH
                Why didn t you move?  

                              BILL JARVIS
                It s my home.

                Go ahead.  Look.   

  Hotch goes to the window and pulls the sheer curtain.  Call 
  walks to the window, looking past the troops to the SCHOOL YARD 
  beyond.  Kids are being escorted inside, away from danger.  *

                                                                              CUT TO:      CRIMINAL MINDS        "Haunted"        PINK     7/29/09 58.



  Hotch and Call still near the window.  Hotch keeps Call 
  distracted.  It s all coming back to Call.  

                              HOTCH
                You sit on that porch and watch 
                those kids everyday, don t you?    

  Hotch nods for the boy to leave.  He slowly moves to the door.  

                              HOTCH (cont d)
                You can t help yourself.*

                              HOTCH
                You made your own son sit up front 
                so the boys would think it s safe. 

                              CALL
                He kept them in cages. I burned 
                their clothes.  

                              HOTCH
                When you were finished, you d bury 
                them.  You made him help.   

  Hotch sees the boy is gone.  He gets in Bill s face.

                Stand up.  Pretend you re a man.

  Bill stands.

                Women never did it for you.  You

                They couldn t be too small, that

  Mitchell, Rossi, Prentiss and Morgan find Hotch cuffing Call.  
  Bill and the gun are on the ground.  Mitchell takes over.  Call 
  stares at Bill, catatonic.  Mitchell shoves him out the door.

                Guess he ll never get over that.  

                              PRENTISS

                              PRENTISS 
                He has Tommy.  He s not alone.  

  Prentiss heads out the door.  

                              PRENTISS (cont'd)
                Get some sleep.  

  Hotch shuts the door.  And for the first time all day, he 
  exhales.  A small victory.  And we --
