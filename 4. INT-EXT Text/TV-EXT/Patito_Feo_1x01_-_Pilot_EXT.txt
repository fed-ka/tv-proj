Callie carries an ENORMOUS BOX up the stairs.  The exterior 
of their new building is just as aesthetically unappealing as 
the inside.

A teenaged boy named BEN WALKER (16), average looking, comes 
out of an apartment and locks the door behind him.

BEN

CALLIE
Actually.  I would love some help.

Ben.  Welcome to the building.

Callie looks concerned.


Andrea Praeger steps out of her very expensive SUV, dressed 
to the nines.  She wears an artificial smile.

 HENDRICKS (17) - her tough-as-nails, but super ALEXIS  LEXY 
 - is  2 sexy tomboy African-American best friend/ number
waiting for her, perched on the hood of her car.  She hops 
off and approaches.5.

She waves at a few more of her friends, the plastic smile 
masking her true aggravation.

LEXY

probably know it before you do what

But that sentence is interrupted by MATT ABBOTT (18) - super 
hot... literally the hottest guy you ve ever seen - obviously 
athletic and with a perfect smile.  He sees her expression 
and contemplates going the other direction.

MATT
(Awkwardly)
Hey.

He goes to kiss Andrea, but she pulls away.

She notices BRIDGET ELLIS (16) - gawky, unattractive and two 
garments away from being carted off to style jail - 
eavesdropping.

ANDREA

What are you looking at, blood 
clot?

Embarrassed, Bridget quickly hurries inside the school.  Past

Callie turns around and looks at the front doors to the 
school.  She stops a RUNNING STUDENT --

CALLIE
Excuse me.  Sorry.  Can you tell me 
how to get to Room 302?

RUNNING STUDENT

No hablo Espanol.

The kid runs off, laughing snarkily.  Callie is taken aback

Callie stands before the palatial house that Andrea lives in.  
She nervously rings the doorbell.

Andrea answers the door with a big smile.  Callie winces at 
the glare off her teeth.

ANDREA
Bienvenidos to my house!  Come on 
in!
(Beat.)
But wipe your feet first.

She waits while Callie does so.  When Andrea feels she s done 
it enough, she gestures for Callie to come inside.


Matt and Derek play basketball.

DEREK
(Mildly amused)

MATT
(Stopping; upset)
Dude.  Why would you tell me that?20.


DEREK
Look.  She s my sister.  I love her 
by default.  But she s also a 
spoiled little bitch.  So, any time 
she gets knocked down a peg, I have 
to revel in it a little bit.

JOSIE (O.S.)

They see that Josie has found them.

JOSIE (CONT D)
I think dumping Andrea Praeger is 
 BY FAR the smartest thing you ve
ever done.  Sorry, Derek, I know

wretched.  
(To Matt)
You re better off without her.

MATT
(Playing serious)
The reason I broke up with Andrea -- 
God, this is hard.  Um.  It s

Derek.  Hold me.

He playfully goes to embrace Derek.

DEREK
Get off me, fag.

He runs away.  Matt chases him, his arms outstretched.

MATT
(Loudly)
 gay for Derek!  And I Josie, I m
 care who knows it!don t

Matt continues to chase Derek around the driveway.  Josie 
laughs.


 in there, touching Josie comes into the bathroom.  Andrea s
up her make-up.  Awkward.

JOSIE
 really sorry Hey.  Listen.  I m
about you and my brother.  If 
 anything --there s21.


ANDREA
Drop the act, Josie.  I know how 
you really feel about me.  Which is 
 not with your brother fine.  I m
 have to anymore, so we don t
pretend to friends.  Now, run 
along.  And watch your back.

JOSIE
 really You know what, Andrea?  I m
not afraid of you.  Yes.  I am 
jumping for joy that my brother 
dumped you.  So, yeah.  Do what you 
 want.  Cause, frankly - I don t
give a flying -

A toilet flushes, drowning out that last word.  Andrea 
watches with a venomous smile as Josie leaves the bathroom.

Bridget comes out of a stall.  REALLY awkward.  She goes over 
to the sink and washes her hands.  Bridget sees the moment 
and seizes it.

BRIDGET
 not my place to say, I know it s
but she was just really mean to 
you.

ANDREA
Bridget, right?

Bridget nods, bracing herself for the usual ridicule.  But 
 instead - Andrea throws her arms around Bridget - who can t

ANDREA (CONT D)
Thank you.  She can be so cruel.  
 just as bad as that Callie She s
girl.
(Beat)
Why have we never hung out before?

BRIDGET
In sixth grade, I was at Sally 
Markwordt s slumber party.  And you 
were there too, but I left early, 
because - well, never mind.

ANDREA
No.  Why?22.


BRIDGET
You told me that if I didn t leave, 
you were going to tell everyone 
that I humped her dog.

ANDREA
(Tearing up)
I am so sorry.

BRIDGET

ANDREA
We should hang out.  I m gonna call 
you, kay?

Bridget gives her a hug, before running off - ecstatic.  
Andrea smiles a cryptic smile.  To herself --

ANDREA (CONT D)
Red rover, red rover.

Off her indecipherable smile --


Callie, horrified, stands before Josie and Ben, who are 
grinning ear to ear.

CALLIE
(Flustered)
You told people I do WHAT?!  That s 
disgusting and I m not even exactly 
sure I know what it IS!

BEN

But before he can finish the sentence, Josie smacks him on 
the chest.

CALLIE

that?

Josie lifts her phone to Callie s face.  The BANG LIST app is 
pulled up on her phone:26.
