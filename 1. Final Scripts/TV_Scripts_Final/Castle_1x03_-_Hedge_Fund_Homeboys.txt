      We open on a pristine LAKE in a lovely country setting. The 
      glassy surface of the lake is broken by the prow of a ROWBOAT 
      gliding by. A YOUNG MAN S ARM dangles lazily off the side, 
      his fingers trailing through the water. Peaceful.

      But as the CAMERA rises, it tells a different story. We see a 
      dozen CROWS crowded around. Suddenly, the crows scatter. 
        Revealing...

      The LIFELESS BODY of a TEENAGE BOY, his shirt soaked in 
      blood. And off this, we PAN UP revealing that we are...

      EXT. MANHATTAN, CENTRAL PARK - MORNING22

      We see city buildings rising like sentries behind the trees. 

      INT. CASTLE LOFT, KITCHEN - MORNING33

      Breakfast. ALEXIS, dressed for school, sits on a stool eating 
      cereal, reading the paper. CASTLE enters, pours coffee.

                                  CASTLE
                    Reading the paper? You re gonna 
                    blow all your wired-teen-hyper-
                      texting-nano-gizmo street cred.

                                  ALEXIS
                    I m a rebel. I kick it old school.

      He kisses her, spies what she s reading.

                                  CASTLE
                    Ah, Style Section. Anything I 
                    should know?

                                  ALEXIS
                    The 70s are back.

                                  CASTLE
                    They re like the Highlander. They 
                    just won t die.
                          (off her shrug)
                    Makes you wonder what came back in 
                    the 70s.

                                  ALEXIS
                          (does the math)
                    Maybe the 40s?

                                  CASTLE
                    I don t remember any top hats.  Castle - Ep 104 "Hedge Fund Homeboys" White Draft 11-24-08  2.

      MARTHA enters.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    Good morning, Mother.

                                  MARTHA
                    What are you so happy about?

                                  CASTLE
                    Top hats.

      Martha gives a little look but decides not to pursue it.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    You re dressed early.

                                  MARTHA
                    I have class.

                                  CASTLE
                    I believe that s a matter of some 
                    debate.

                                  MARTHA
                    At the New School, funny man.
                          (off his look)
                    Look, it s not that I don t 
                      appreciate all you ve done, 
                    insisting I move in after Bernie 
                    ran off with my bank accounts, but 
                    a girl s got to stand on her own 
                    two feet.

                                  CASTLE
                    What kind of class?

                                  MARTHA
                      Introduction to Life Coaching. It 
                    was always my desire to make a 
                      difference. On the stage or off. 
                    Look, I had cards made.

      She presents him with her card. Castle reads it.

                                  CASTLE
                    It says I m your client.

                                  MARTHA
                    Of course it does. Haven t I been 
                    telling you what to do your whole 
                    life?

      She breezes out of the room. Castle is too dumbstruck to 
      respond.   Castle - Ep 104 "Hedge Fund Homeboys" White Draft 11-24-08  3.

                                  ALEXIS
                    Oh, Dad, Julie Schmidt s father s 
                    back in rehab, so a spot opened up 
                    to chaperone the DC trip.

                                  CASTLE
                    How do you know he s in rehab?

                                  ALEXIS
                    Must be a wired-teen-hyper-nano 
                    thing. So what do you say?

                                  CASTLE
                    Love to, kiddo, but with you away, 
                    my chaperoning needs reside here.
                    Or did you forget about the last 
                    time we left her alone?

                                  ALEXIS
                    So she had a little party.

                                  CASTLE
                    There were lime shards embedded in 
                    the walls.

      Martha re-enters the kitchen.

                                  MARTHA
                    It was Cinco de Mayo.

      Castle s cell RINGS (Dragnet theme).

                                  CASTLE
                          (excited)
                    I hear dead people!
                          (picks up)
                    Who died and was it gruesome?

                                  MARTHA
                          (to Alexis)
                    He stopped maturing at twelve. 
                    Which sadly means he s better than 
                    most men.

                                  CASTLE
                          (folds cell)
                    I m off to protect our fair city. 
                    Love you.

      He kisses Alexis and Martha and bolts.

                                  ALEXIS
                          (calling after him)
                    Book  em, Daddo!  Castle - Ep 104 "Hedge Fund Homeboys" White Draft 11-24-08  4.

      EXT. CENTRAL PARK, FIFTH AVE - MORNING44

      A crisp, sunny day. Castle hops out of a taxi just as BECKETT 
      emerges from her car. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Hey, look at this. We re in sync.

                                    BECKETT
                    We are not in sync.

                                  CASTLE
                    What? Not a Timberlake fan?

      Castle hustles after Beckett into the park together.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    C mon, admit it. You re beginning 
                    to appreciate my mad crime-solving 
                    skills.

                                    BECKETT
                    You re giddy this morning.

                                  CASTLE
                    The park. Gets me every time. The 
                    birds and the bees. Nature taking 
                    its course. Young lovers doing what 
                    young lovers do. Murders needing to 
                    be solved. Life is good.

      Beckett looks at him, is about to respond, then just gives 
      up. They duck under police tape to --

      EXT. CENTRAL PARK, THE LAKE AT THE BOATHOUSE - CONTINUOUS55

      It s an active crime scene with UNIFORMS at the perimeter.  
      ESPOSITO and RYAN approach.

                                  RYAN
                    Nice day, huh? We gotta get out 
                    here more.  And not just when 
                    someone gets whacked.

                                    BECKETT
                    Why s everyone so back to nature 
                    this morning?

                                  RYAN
                    We all go back to nature 
                      eventually, Detective.

                                    BECKETT
                    Yeah, about that...  Castle - Ep 104 "Hedge Fund Homeboys" White Draft 11-24-08  5.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    One victim. Donald Kendall, 18.  He 
                    was a senior at Redding Prep. 

      They approach the ROWBOAT containing the BODY, which has been 
      pulled to shore. LANIE, in wading boots, attends to the body 
      from the side of the row boat.

                                  RYAN
                    Someone s gonna miss prom night.  

                                    BECKETT
                    Redding Prep? 

                                  CASTLE
                          (disturbed by dead teen, 
                            thinking of Alexis)
                    Private school... on Park Avenue. 

                                  ESPOSITO
                    No trust fund baby left behind.

                                    BECKETT
                    What s he doing in a boat?

                                  ESPOSITO
                    No idea.

                                    BECKETT
                    How are you, Dr. Parish?

                                  LANIE
                    My feet are cold.  

                                    BECKETT
                    What do you got for me, so far?

                                  LANIE
                    Single GSW to the chest.  Fairly 
                    large caliber... And from the lack 
                    of blood inside the boat, I d say 
                    he wasn t killed at sea.

                                    BECKETT
                    Someone moved him.

      Lanie indicates dirt and grass on the victim s shoes.

                                  LANIE
                    There s dirt and grass on his 
                    Chucky T s... Other than the 
                      postmortem voyage, looks like a pop 
                    and drop.  I m guessing sometime 
                    late last night.  Castle - Ep 104 "Hedge Fund Homeboys" White Draft 11-24-08  6.

      Beckett then notices several rowboats tied up nearby.

                                    BECKETT
                          (to Esposito and Ryan)
                    If he was dragged here, it couldn t 
                    have been far.  Get some Uniforms 
                    to do a perimeter walk from those 
                    boats there out to Fifth.  Tell 
                    them, they re looking for a blood 
                    pool, maybe a shell casing.

                                  RYAN
                    Roger that.

      Esposito and Ryan get on it, Beckett steps toward the lake s 
      edge, takes it in. Castle joins her.

                                    BECKETT 
                    So why the burial at sea?

                                  CASTLE
                    Vikings believed that in order to 
                    reach Valhalla, you needed a 
                    vessel.  

                                    BECKETT
                      Gun-toting Viking? That your 
                    theory?

                                  CASTLE
                    No. Vikings launched their dead 
                    with a sacrificial woman. 

      Beckett turns and gives Castle a sharp look,

      CASTLE TITLE CARD

      INT. KENDALL APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY66

      It s a modest sized room that is a bit too cluttered with 
      furniture. Beckett and Castle sit with MR. KENDALL, victim s 
      father, 50, gaunt, full of regret and MRS. KENDALL, victim s 
      mother, mid 40s, still in shock. Castle is staring at a 
      modern sculpture that takes up a sizeable part of the room.

                                  MRS. KENDALL
                    No.

                                    BECKETT
                    When was the last time you saw him?

                                  MRS. KENDALL
                      Yesterday, when he left for school.

                                    BECKETT
                    Do you know where he might have 
                    gone after?

                                  MRS. KENDALL
                    He was usually with his friends.

                                    BECKETT
                    He didn t come home for dinner?

                                  MRS. KENDALL 
                    Most nights Donny ate out or at 
                    someone else s house. 

                                  MR. KENDALL 
                    He hung out with a pretty tight 
                    crowd at Redding. They ve all been 
                    together since grammar school. 

                                  MRS. KENDALL
                    We used to have them over all the 
                    time...

                                  CASTLE

                    Only you ve moved recently. 

                                  MRS. KENDALL
                    Yes, um, a few months ago.

                                  MR. KENDALL
                    I was a partner at Lehman. When it 
                    went under, well, we took a big 
                    hit.

                                  MRS. KENDALL
                    It was hard on Donny.  You get used 
                    to a certain way of living...
                          (taking husband s hand)
                    But it was no one s fault.

                                  CASTLE
                    Do you think he was depressed?

      Mr. and Mrs. Kendall look to each other, unsure.  Castle - Ep 104 "Hedge Fund Homeboys" White Draft 11-24-08  8.

                                  MR. KENDALL
                    You don't know what it's like. 
                    Donny was strong but to lose 
                      everything you have... We were just 
                    getting by.

                                    BECKETT
                          (beat)
                    I m very sorry for your loss.

      INT. OUTSIDE KENDALL APARTMENT, HALLWAY - DAY77

      Beckett and Castle head toward the elevator.

                                    BECKETT
                    How d you know they moved?

                                  CASTLE
                    Either the Kendalls really like art 
                    or that sculpture was bought for a 
                    much bigger place. I wonder how 
                    they could still afford Redding.

      An austere stone building. 

      INT. REDDING PREP, CORRIDOR - DAY99

      Castle and Beckett walk with CHRIS MARKUM, the school 
      HEADMASTER.

                                  MARKUM
                    When the Kendalls said they 
                    couldn t afford tuition, we put 
                    Donny on scholarship. The family 
                    had been very generous in the past 
                    and Donny was one of our brightest.  
                    We thought he d do great things. 
                    Ivy League for sure.

                                    BECKETT
                    Did you notice anything different 
                    about him recently?

                                  MARKUM
                    He d always been a charismatic kid, 
                    people were drawn to him. Some of 
                    that spark was gone.

                                  CASTLE
                    Any idea why he would ve gone to 
                    Central Park at night?  Castle - Ep 104 "Hedge Fund Homeboys" White Draft 11-24-08  9.

      Markum pauses as they enter --

      EXT. REDDING PREP, COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS1010

      STUDENTS hang out, eating lunch, texting, playing PSPs, etc.

                                  MARKUM
                    None at all. But the truth is, all 
                    these kids are icebergs. We only 
                    see the tip. If you want to know 
                    the rest, you should probably ask 
                    his friends.

      Markum points out a cluster of FIVE KIDS, all around 18 years 
      of age, gathered around a table.

                    Max.

                                    BECKETT
                    How are they doing?

      Markum gives a sympathetic shrug.

                                  MARKUM
                    They were very close. Called 
                      themselves the six pack. It s 
                    strange seeing them without him....

      Beckett nods. She and Castle cross toward the kids.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. REDDING PREP, COURTYARD - DAY1212

      Pulling back from the phone, we see the five kids with 
      Beckett and Castle. BRANDON, 19, quiet, thoughtful, smiles 
      and shakes his head as he closes the app on his phone.

                                    BRANDON
                    That was before they moved and 
                      everything....

      MAX, 18, a little geeky, looks down, emotional. ROMY, 18, 
      Asian, wipes the mist from her eyes.

                                  ROMY
                    You hear about this kinda stuff 
                    happening to other people, but...

                                    BECKETT 
                    Were any of you with Donny last 
                    night?

      They shake their heads. SPENCER, 18, explains.

                                    SPENCER
                    We hung for a bit after school, but 
                    we all headed home around five.

                                    BECKETT
                    Can you think of any reason he 
                    might ve been in the park?

      Silence. The kids look at each other a beat. Castle senses 
      they know something.

                                  CASTLE
                    We just want to find who did this. 
                    We need your help... 

      Finally, AMANDA, the edgy one of the group, multiple ear 
      piercings, and a small tat peeking out from under her 
      starched white shirt at her shoulder, speaks up...

                                  AMANDA
                    We loved Donny. We totally just 
                    wanted to help.

                    His family lost everything.

                                  ROMY
                    We like always offered to cover 
                    him, but he couldn t deal with it.

                                    SPENCER
                    Yeah. I mean, he just kinda fell 
                    apart.

                                    BECKETT
                    Fell apart how?

      They all look at each other.

                                  CASTLE
                    It s okay, he can t get in trouble.

                                  AMANDA
                    He kind of... got into drugs.

                                    BECKETT
                    Drugs?

                                    BRANDON
                    He was just really hurting. 

                                  CASTLE
                    If he had money problems, how d he 
                    afford a habit?

      A long beat. Amanda looks to the ground.

                                  AMANDA
                    He started dealing... In the park.

      EXT. REDDING PREP - DAY1313

      Castle and Beckett exit, talking. Head to their car.

                    Of course bad things happen. 
                    Otherwise it wouldn t be a tragedy. 
                    Did you know that in the original 
                    Greek, the word  tragedy  literally 
                    means  goat-song?  

      Beckett shoots Castle a look - What are you talking about?Castle - Ep 104 "Hedge Fund Homeboys" White Draft 11-24-08  12.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    Yeah. It makes no sense to me 
                    either, but whatever that first 
                    story was, I can t help but think 
                    bad things must ve happened to that 
                    goat.

      Beckett turns and puts her finger in Castle s face. She wants 
      to say something, but she doesn t know what. Her CELL RINGS. 
      She bites her lip and shakes her head at Castle as she 
      answers. 

                                    BECKETT
                          (into cell)
                    Beckett.

      Castle leans in close to hear the call, their heads almost 
      touching, intimate. Still on the phone, Beckett reaches with 
      her free hand and grabs Castle s ear, pulling his head away 
      from her.

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    Where?

                                  CASTLE

                    On my way.

      Beckett releases him and takes off. Castle hustles after her:

      EXT. CENTRAL PARK, PATHWAY - DAY1414

      At another CRIME SCENE, on some grass behind a PARK BENCH, 
      which sits along a paved pathway. Ryan walks toward a bench 
      with Beckett and Castle. RED CONES mark a trail to the 
      pathway.

                    I m figuring he was probably 
                    sitting on the top of the bench, 
                    takes one to the chest, falls over 
                    backward here.

      Ryan comes around to CONES marking the divots in the grass.

                    Then he s dragged toward the lake.  

                                    BECKETT
                    So, what s he doing sitting on top 
                    of a bench at night in the park?

                                  RYAN
                    Back in my narc days this area was 
                    pretty much an open bazaar, 
                       specially at night.

                    You were arrested with money and

                    It s not about putting him on his

      Romy, her MOTHER behind her, stands with Beckett in front of 
    a one-way window with the shade down.  Castle s off to the 
      side, with Montgomery.  Romy s scared.

                                    BECKETT
                    So this dealer asked Donny for the 
                    couple hundred he owed, right?

                                  ROMY
                    Yeah.

                                    BECKETT
                    And Donny said he didn t have it?

                    Right.

      Castle and Beckett are struck by this. They look at each

                                    BECKETT
                    Whoever staged Max s suicide wants 
                    us to believe that he killed 
                    himself out of guilt over shooting 
                    Donny. Which makes me think that 
                    Max may not have killed Donny after 
                    all.

                    Romy s dad, Mr Lee? He s like this 
                    big IT guy. He hooked us up with a 
                    file share over bluetooth, so we d 
                    all have the files. Amanda took 
                    this that night.

                                    BECKETT
                    What is it?

                                    BRANDON
                    A video. Of Donny getting shot.
                    We promised to erase it. 
                          (scrolls around his phone)
                    But I knew if the truth came out, 
                    we d all be screwed. And after what 
                    happened to those kids in that Duke 
                    case? I just didn t wanna end up 
                    like them. 

      He hits play and hands it to Beckett. We PUSH IN tight over 
      Beckett and Castle and INTERCUT between PHONE VIDEO and 
      Castle and Beckett reacting, cutting around kids taking drags 
      on joint as needed:

      The  camera-work  is jerky. It s the same pathway where we 
      saw the blood pool earlier. We re TIGHT on BRANDON as he 
      raises a joint to his lips.

      Spencer snags the joint from Brandon. The camera catches his 
      eye.

                    Blast me, Max-oh. Take me out!

      The others crack up. Spencer passes the joint to Romy, but 
      before she can take a drag, Max, already holding the gun, 
      snags it from her.

                                  ROMY
                    Hey! You pulled my mom s Harry

                    Cue the violins.

      Max holds the gun straight out at Donny s chest.

      We cut away from the video back to...

      Beckett and Castle s faces as... BANG! The gun goes off.  We 
      watch their reactions as Donny gets shot. We hear the scrape 
      and bustle of RUNNING, the kids SHRIEKING. Cries of  Oh my 
      God.   Donny.   No!  And it ends.

                                  CASTLE
                    I was just thinking about Donny s 
                    parents. What they ll go through 
                    when they watch that video...
                          (off her empathetic look)
                    Guess it s not too often you get a 
                    murder caught on tape.

                                    BECKETT
                    He was smart to keep it.  Without 
                    it, they all might be looking at a 
                      Manslaughter charge.

      Which gets Castle thinking...

                                  CASTLE
                    That was pretty smart when you 
                    think about it, wasn t it?

                                    BECKETT

                    was so special about that night?

                    Is because you know what s going to

                    I figured my turn was coming and I 
                    better be ready. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Only now we know it was you. Your  
                    three friends all have solid alibis 
                    for the night Max was killed.

      Brandon sits back, cool, unfazed.

                                    BRANDON
                    You say killed. I say suicide.

                                    BECKETT
                    Where were you that night?

                                    BRANDON
                    I took a walk. I knew you wouldn t 
                    believe me so I asked Spencer to 
                    cover for me.

                                  CASTLE
                    And that s what you guys do, right? 
                    Cover for each other?

                                    BRANDON
                    Exactly.  Look, Detective, you re hot 
                    and everything, but if you had any 
                    actual evidence, you d have already 
                    arrested me. Me? I have a video that 
                    proves Max killed Donny. You think a 
                    jury s gonna believe he didn t get 
                    drunk and off himself?

                                    BECKETT
                    This is just another game to you. 
                    Like selling drugs in the park.

                                    BRANDON
                    If it were, looks like I d be 
                    winning. But, hey, if you think I 
                    did it, let s see you prove it.

      Brandon casually walks away. Off Beckett and Castle --

      Castle closes a file-

                    You know it s really tedious

                    Welcome to my world. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Brandon had this all planned.  He 
                    gets Max to shoot Donny, then gets 
                    Max drunk and kills him.

                    Okay, so we canvassed every store, 
                    stand, and homeless guy from the 
                    park entrance at 72nd to the scene.

                    No one remembers seeing Max or 
                    Brandon last night.

                    Guess we weren t lucky enough to 
                    have Max take a video of Brandon 
                    killing him.

                                  CASTLE
                    The irony is, if he did, Brandon 
                    would ve known. It would ve popped 
                    up in Brandon s shared folder when 
                    their phones...

      Beckett snatches the phone from Castle. 

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    If they were together when Max was 
                    murdered, their phones would ve 
                      automatically synced. There d be a 
                    record.

      Beckett scrolls deep into the phone s menu system and pulls 
      up a sync history with dates, times and cell numbers. Beckett 
      stops cold.

      Brandon sits alone at the table. Castle and Beckett enter.

                                    BECKETT
                    You have the right to have your 
                    lawyer present, Brandon. If you 
                    can t afford a lawyer, one will be 
                    appointed for you.

                                  CASTLE
                    C mon, he can afford like a million  
                    lawyers.

                                    BRANDON
                    She still has to advise me of my 
                    rights, right?   

                                    BECKETT
                    Right.

                    Anyway, that s cool. I don t want a 
                    lawyer. This is way more fun.Castle - Ep 104 "Hedge Fund Homeboys" White Draft 11-24-08  51.

      Beckett puts a piece of paper and pen in front of him.

                                    BECKETT
                    Maybe you just want to sign a 
                      confession then?

                                    BRANDON
                    Sure.

                    There.  Now I feel so much better.

                    You sure you don t wanna call your

                    You know, I made a phone call to my 
                    bookie a little while ago.

                    It was while I was waiting for my 
                    car outside Nobu.

                                    BRANDON
                    Yeah? I love that place.

                    Black squid pasta s awesome.  
                    Anyway, I was standing on the 
                    sidewalk talking, when the valet 
                    pulled up with my car.  All of a 
                    sudden my call cut off.  That s 
                    when I realized that the bluetooth 
                    in my car had automatically picked 
                    up my call. You know,  cause it 
                    linked.

      Off Brandon, hearing something he HADN T thought of.

                                    BECKETT
                    You told us all your phones auto-

                    link, right?Castle - Ep 104 "Hedge Fund Homeboys" White Draft 11-24-08  52.

                                    BRANDON
                    So?

                                  CASTLE
                    So your phone  coupled  with Max s 
                    phone the night he was killed. 

                                    BECKETT
                    It s a digital fingerprint that 
                    puts you within twenty feet of Max 
                    at the time of his murder. 

      Brandon is ruffled.

                                  CASTLE
                    You did say if she had actual 
                    evidence, she should arrest you.  

                                    BECKETT
                    You took advantage of Max s guilt 
                    over Donny and got him black-out 
                    drunk, then you put the gun in his 
                    hand, pressed it to his head and 
                    pulled the trigger.

                                    BRANDON
                    And why would I do that?

                                    BRANDON
                    Why would I kill Donny?

                                  CASTLE
                    Amanda.

                                    BRANDON
                    Amanda was with me, not Donny.

                                  CASTLE
                    Right, but only after Donny lost 
                    all his money.

                                    BECKETT
                     Cause he d gotten way more than 
                    under her blouse, right?

      Brandon starts to brood, not laughing them off anymore.

                                    BRANDON
                    I still have that video that shows 
                    Max shot Donny, not me.

                                  CASTLE
                    Yeah, arranging that was pretty 
                      impressive.
                          (off Brandon)
                    I mean fooling Spencer, Romy and 
                    Amanda wasn t that hard because 
                    they didn t handle the gun. But Max 
                    was a different story.  He d 
                    actually pulled the trigger, and he 
                    just couldn t let it go, could he?  
                    And then he remembered you gave him 
                    the gun.  So he called you and 
                    asked you to meet him. 

                                    BECKETT
                    We have a record of the call.

                                  CASTLE
                    You could tell something was up, so 
                    you brought the gun and, what, 
                    Vodka? Or is Max a Scotch man?
                          (drawing Brandon in)
                    He knew all about you and Donny and 
                    Amanda. And he had to wonder:  Did 
                    you set me up to kill my best 
                    friend?   And when he realized you 
                    had, he wasn t gonna keep quiet, 
                    was he?  Even with you telling him 
                    that you d all go to jail. 
                          (beat)
                    If only Max had been strong enough 
                    to just man up... If only Donny had 
                      understood that he didn t belong 
                    with you guys anymore, that it was 
                    over between him and Amanda, none 
                    of this would have been necessary.  
                    But weak people don t always get 
                    it, do they, Brandon?  Sometimes 
                    they have to be led to the truth.

      Castle then immediately snaps out of the act, and Brandon 
      realizes his mistake.

                    Did you just hear him say, 
                       Exactly.   Cause I just heard him 
                    say,  Exactly. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Yup. I heard him, too.

                                    BRANDON
                    He tricked me.

                                    BECKETT
                    Whatever.  It s still called 
                       admission against interest. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Which is just a fancy term for a 
                      confession.

      Beckett gathers her things.

                                    BECKETT
                    Pretty sweet, huh? 

      CUE MUSIC. Brandon stares blankly, his bravado extinguished.

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    Oh, and the funny thing? You 
                    probably thought it was really 
                    clever to go back and move Donny s 
                    body, right? But if you hadn t, we 
                    never would ve figured it out.

                                  CASTLE
                    She never would have figured it 
                    out.  

                                    BECKETT
                    Like you would have figured it out.

                                  CASTLE
                      I definitely would have....

      Brandon s eyes widen slightly. He ll have plenty of time to 
      think about that. Beckett and Castle exit.

      INT. PRECINCT, OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS4646

      We see Brandon through the window, then PAN to REVEAL Amanda, 
      Romy and Spencer, shell-shocked, being processed... Castle - Ep 104 "Hedge Fund Homeboys" White Draft 11-24-08  55.

      Off Castle, watching them, moved --

      INT. CASTLE LOFT, ALEXIS S ROOM - DAY4747

      Alexis is finishing packing a duffle bag for her trip. Castle 
      enters carrying a packed leather bag.

                                  CASTLE
                    Power up. I don t want to be late.

                                  ALEXIS
                    You re coming?

                                  CASTLE
                    Yes, ma am. I m the official 
                      replacement chaperone.

                                  ALEXIS
                          (hugging him)
                    Yay. That s awesome.

      They exit her room to --

      INT. CASTLE LOFT, STAIRS TO LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS4848

      Castle and Alexis walk and talk down stairs.

                                  CASTLE
                      I realized I need to take care of a 
                    little business in DC anyway.

                                  ALEXIS
                    Really?

                                  CASTLE
                    Yeah, I want to pick the spot for 
                    my monument. Just in case.

                                  ALEXIS
                    I think Washington and Lincoln 
                    already have the good ones.

                                  CASTLE
                    Maybe they can move Jefferson.

      They head to the front door. Martha joins them and kisses 
      Alexis on the forehead. 

                                  MARTHA
                    You two kids hurry off now. Don t 
                    want to miss any of the fun. Castle - Ep 104 "Hedge Fund Homeboys" White Draft 11-24-08  56.

      Suddenly the DOORBELL rings. Castle gives Martha a look. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Any of your fun, you mean. 

                                  MARTHA
                    It s not what you think-

      Castle opens the door and a STREAM OF PEOPLE enter the loft. 

                                  CASTLE
                    No, it s exactly what I thought.

                                  MARTHA
                    Does this look like a wild party? 

      Castle looks at the very buttoned-up, conservative group. 

                                  MARTHA (CONT D)
                    For your information, I m hosting a  
                    seminar for my life coaching class. 
                     Be the Change You Wish To See.   

                                  CASTLE
                    How very Zen of you. 

                                  ALEXIS
                    Dad, be supportive. She s trying to 
                    help people- 

                                  CASTLE
                    To my liquor cabinet.

                                  MARTHA
                    It s going to be a completely 
                    civilized affair. You have my word. 

      Castle gives her a look - Alexis drags him out of the loft.  
      When the door shuts, Martha turns to her guests with a smile.  

                                  MARTHA (CONT D)
                    Okay. So who wants a drink?

      Martha takes off her jacket to reveal a sexy top. She pulls 
      out a bottle of champagne from behind a potted plant- 

      INT. OUTSIDE CASTLE LOFT, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS4949

      Castle and Alexis hear the POP of a champagne bottle and the 
      sound of CHEERING. Castle and Alexis trade looks, and share a 
      smile. They just keep walking.
