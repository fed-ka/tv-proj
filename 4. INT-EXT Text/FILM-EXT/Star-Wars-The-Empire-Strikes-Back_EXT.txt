A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots
from its underside.
One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice-
covered surface.
An explosion marks the point of
impact.
A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind.
A
strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the
smoke-shrouded crater.
The ominous mechanical probe floats across the
snow plain and disappears into the distance.
A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.
The bundled
rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun.
Curving
plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged
beast.
The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop.
Pulling
off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the
sky.
He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and
through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed.
The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink
transmitter.
His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.
LUKE
(into comlink)
Echo Three to Echo Seven.
Han,
old buddy, do you read me?
After a little static a familiar voice is heard.
HAN
(over comlink)
Loud and clear, kid.
What's up?
LUKE
(into comlink)
Well, I finished my circle.
I
don't pick up any life readings.
HAN
(over comlink)
There isn't enough life on this
ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
The sensors are placed, I'm going
back.
LUKE
(into comlink)
Right.
I'll see you shortly.
There's a meteorite that hit the
ground near here.
I want to check
it out.
It won't take long.
Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard.
He pats the beast on the head to calm it.
LUKE
Hey, steady girl.
What's the
matter?
You smell something?
Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when
suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind.
He hears a
monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over
him.
It is a Wampa Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously.
LUKE
Aaargh!
Luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white
claw.
He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified
screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck
being broken.
The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away
across the frozen plain.
A stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance of an enormous
ice cave.
The jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of
a Hoth day.
Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy
stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor.
One
side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood.
He opens
his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the
gorge walls.
Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and
futilely tries to unfasten the throngs.
Exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position.
As he hangs there,
he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about
three feet out of reach.
He focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he
squeezes his eyes tight in concentration.
Just as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into
Luke's hand.
The young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts
himself loose from the ice.
He flops to the snow in a heap.
The
startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking.
Luke
scrambles to his feet.
He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams
in pain.
Luke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy twilight.
Weak
and exhausted, he stumbles down a snow bank.
A small, lone figure riding a Tauntaun races through the hostile
vastness of snow and cold.
As it runs, the Tauntaun's legs kick up
large clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air.
Artoo stands in the falling snow, beeping worriedly.
Threepio moves
stiffly over to him.
THREEPIO
You must come along now, Artoo.
There's really nothing more we can
do.
And my joints are freezing up.
Artoo beeps, long and low.
THREEPIO
Don't say thing like that!
Of
course we'll see Master Luke again.
He'll be quite all right, you'll see.
(to himself)
Stupid little short-circuit.
He'll
be quite all right.
Threepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as Artoo mournfully
keeps his vigil.
The wind is blowing quite strong now.
Luke struggles to stay upright,
but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over.
He struggles to get up,
but he can't.
The young warrior from Tatooine drags himself a couple
of feet and then collapses.
Luke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious.
Slowly he looks
up and sees Ben Kenobi, barely visible through the blowing snow.
It is
hard to tell if Kenobi is real or a hallucination.
BEN
Luke... Luke.
LUKE
(weakly)
Ben?
BEN
You will go to the Dagobah system.
LUKE
Dagobah system?
BEN
There you will learn from Yoda,
the Jedi Master who instructed me.
The image of Ben fades, revealing a lone Tauntaun rider approaching
from the windswept horizon.
LUKE
(groaning faintly)
Ben... Ben.
Luke drops into unconsciousness.
Han pulls up and leaps off his mount.
He hurries to his snow-covered
friend, cradling him in his arms.
Han's Tauntaun lets out a low,
pitiful bellow.
But Han's concern is with Luke, and he shakes him
urgently.
HAN
Luke!
Luke!
Don't do this, Luke.
Come on, give me a sign here.
Luke doesn't respond.
Han begins frantically rubbing and slapping
Luke's unconscious face.
As he starts to lift the youth, Han hears a
rasping sound behind him.
He turns, just in time to see his Tauntaun
stagger and then fall over into the snow.
Han carries Luke to the moaning beast.
Then, with a final groan, the
Tauntaun expires.
HAN
Not much time.
He pushes Luke's inert form against the belly of the dead beast.
LUKE
(moaning)
Ben... Ben...
HAN
Hang on, kid.
LUKE
Dagobah system...
Han ignites Luke's saber and cuts the beast from head to toe.
He
quickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow, then lifts Luke's
inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass.
HAN
(reeling from the
odor)
Whew...
LUKE
Dagobah...
HAN
This may smell bad, kid...
LUKE
(moaning)
Yoda...
HAN
...but it will keep you warm...
til I get the shelter built.
(struggling to get
Luke inside the
carcass)
Ooh... I thought they smelled bad
on the outside!
The wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move.
Han
removes a pack from the dead creature's back, taking out a shelter
container.
He begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection
against a bitter Hoth night.
Four snub-nosed armored snowspeeders race across the white landscape.
The small craft banks and makes a slow arc, then races off in a new
direction.
The small shelter Han set up is covered with snow on the windward side.
A makeshift antenna rests gingerly on top the snowdrift.
Han spots
Zev's snowspeeder approaching in the distance, and begins waving his
arms frantically at the tiny craft.
The dark probe robot moves past the smoldering ruins of station three-
eight and down a ridge toward the Rebel base.
It raises a large
antenna from the top of its head and begins to send out a piercing
signal.
The probe droid has spotted Chewbacca who, not thirty feet away, has
popped his head over a snow bank.
Instantly, the probe robot swings
around, its deadly ray ready to fire.
But before it can get a shot
off, it is hit from behind by a laser bolt, and explodes in a million
pieces.
Han Solo replaces his blaster in its holster and peers intently at the
smoldering remains of the Imperial probe.
Darth Vader's Star Destroyer, larger and more awesome than the five
Imperial Star Destroyers that surround it, sits in the vastness of
space.
The six huge ships are surrounded by a convoy of smaller
spacecraft.
TIE fighters dart to and fro.
Rebel troops carry heavy bazooka-type weapons and position them along
the snow trench.
Men hurriedly respond to their officers' yelled
orders and brace themselves against the rhythmic gusts of bitter-cold
wind.
Other troops load power packs into a gun turret and swing its guns into
position.
Near the base power generators, troops rush to set up their heavy
battle equipment.
Buzzing loudly, the generators send along, sparking
fingers of energy into the bitter Hoth wind.
The Rebel transport and two escort fighters begin their departure from
the ice planet.
A huge Imperial Star Destroyer rest against a sea of stars, far above
the white surface of the planet Hoth.
The giant ball-shaped ion cannon rotates into position and blasts two
red energy beams skyward.
The Rebel transport and its escort race away from the white planet,
closely followed by the two red energy beams.
As the Rebel transport races toward the waiting Imperial Star
Destroyer, it is overtaken by the two scarlet energy bolts.
The
Imperial Star Destroyer is hit in the conning tower by the powerful
bolts, which set up fiery explosions on its metal hull.
The big Star Destroyer veers, then spins wildly out of control.
As the
Imperial ship careers into deep space, the Rebel transport races away
to safety.
A thin horizon line cuts across the bleak landscape.
Small dot-size
objects begin to appear on the horizon, moving in the direction of the
Rebel base.
A Rebel officer lifts a pair of electrobinoculars to his eyes.
Through
the lens he sees a very close view of a giant Imperial snow walker.
He
adjusts the view which then zooms back to reveal three more of the
ominous battle machines.
Small flashes of yellow fire billow from the
guns of the lumbering snow walkers.
The officer lowers his binoculars as the regular rhythmic pounding
begins to make the ground vibrate.
The pounding grows louder and is
accompanied by a high-pitched, metallic rattling.
The officer speaks
into his comlink.
TRENCH OFFICER
Echo Station Three-T-Eight.
The Rebel troops aim their weapons at the horizon as explosions erupt
all around them.
They are nervous and their grip on their weapons
tightens from the cold and from fear.
Behind the troops a dozen snowspeeders race through the sky.
The fleet of snowspeeders races above the ice field at full throttle.
They accelerate away from the base and head toward the distant walkers.
The cannons mounted on the walker head fire at the speeders.
Other
walkers loom in the background.
Two speeders race away past two of the
enormous walkers and bank to the right.
Two speeders race directly at the head of a walker, then split and fly
past it.
Three other walkers march onward, firing all cannons.
Rebel troops fire on the approaching walkers, as the snow and ice
explode all around them.
A speeder banks through and away from the legs of a walker.
Two other
speeders pass the first speeder from the opposite direction.
Other
Rebel craft race just above the icy plain.
A giant walker head swivels and fires, striking a snowspeeder and
sending it crashing in a ball of flames.
Rogue Leader and another snowspeeder fly in tight formation toward the
walker as explosions burst all around them.
Rebel troops fire the dishlike ray gun while explosions erupt around
them.
Two walkers lumber toward the Rebel base as a speeder between them
explodes in a ball of flames.
The dislike ray gun is hit by a laser bolt and instantly explodes.
Wedge's speeder races through the legs of one of the monstrous walkers.
The harpoon hurtles toward the walker, In an instant it is embedded in
one of the walker's legs.
The speeder Rogue Three races around one of the giant walker's feet,
trailing the cable behind it.
Continuing around the back foot, Rogue
Three then circles the walker around the tail end.
The speeder sweeps left to right in front of the giant legs, towing the
cable behind it.
The cable release on the back of the speeder snaps loose and the cable
drops away.
The speeder zooms away into the distance.
The tangled legs of the
enormous war machine attempt a step, but as they do the giant Imperial
walker begins to topple.
It teeters for a moment, and then crashes
onto the icy ground, sending snow and metal pieces flying.
The troops in the trenches cheer at the sight of the crashing walker.
An officer gives a signal to his men and Rebel troops charge the fallen
war machine.
TRENCH OFFICER
Come on!
The troops run toward the downed walker, followed by two Rebel speeders
flying overhead.
Just as they reach the walker, it explodes, the
impact throwing some of the men onto the frozen ground.
The fierce battle on the vast snow plains of Hoth rages on.
The
Imperial walkers continue their slow, steady assault on the Rebel base,
firing lasers as they lumber ever onward.
In the snow trench, Rebel
troops fire large bazookalike guns and dishlike ray guns as explosions
erupt around them.
A gun tower is hit by a laser bolt and instantly
explodes.
Another blast destroys a ray gun.
Luke's speeder and Rogue Two fly in formation, banking from right to
left and flying above the erupting battlefield.
Flak bursts all around
them.
The two speeders race across the horizon toward the giant walkers.
Luke's speeder moves in formation with Rogue Two, when suddenly Zev's
speeder is hit by a laser bolt.
His ship bucks violently under the
impact and the cockpit explodes in a ball of flame.
Spewing smoke, the speeder hurtles toward a looming walker.
Before
they collide.
Rogue Two explodes in a million flaming pieces.
Rebel troops retreat under the awesome Imperial onslaught.
OFFICER
Begin retreat!
SECOND OFFICER
Fall back!
Troops flee from the battle, the ground exploding around them.
Three of the giant walkers, firing lasers, advance toward the Rebel
headquarters.
Continuing their retreat, the Rebels see the walkers looming ever
nearer.
On the battlefield, Luke watches as a walker foot rises and moves over
him.
He looks up at the underbelly of the huge walker, passing
overhead.
Running beneath the monstrous machine, Luke fires his harpoon gun at
the walker's underside.
A thin cable follows the projectile from the
gun.
The magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull.
Still running under the walker, Luke attaches the cable drum to his
belt buckle.
Soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling
underneath the walker.
The walker's giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen
snow.
Stray laser bolts whistle by Luke as he climbs up the cable to
the walker's hull, reaching a small hatch.
Hanging precariously, Luke
cuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword.
He takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the
Imperial machine.
Quickly, Luke starts down the cable and crashes onto
the icy ground far below.
He lies unconscious as a giant rear leg
passes by - and just misses him.
The giant walker stops in mid-step.
A muffled explosion comes from
within - and then the walker's mechanical insides
are spewed out every
conceivable opening.
The machine sits dead in its tracks, smoking like
a locomotive on stilts.
Veers's walker continues to advance toward the Rebel base.
The
smoldering walker that Luke exploded stands smoking just to the right
of Veers's path.
The Rebel troops continue their desperate retreat, pushed back by the
relentless Imperial assault.
A laser gun appears on the Falcon and swings around to aim at the
Imperial troops.
The stormtroopers, preparing to fire their bazooka cannon, are hit by
the Falcon's fire and are thrown about in all directions.
Luke and two other pilots look up as the Millennium Falcon races above
them, flying very close to the ground.
The three pilots turn then, and trudge onward toward their X-wing
fighters, each going to his own ship.
Luke waves farewell, then heads
toward his own fighter.
Artoo, seated on his cubbyhole, chirps an excited greeting as Luke
climbs aboard the spacecraft.
LUKE
Artoo!
Get her ready for takeoff.
From his ship, Luke sees Wedge in his own X-wing, preparing for
takeoff.
WEDGE
Good luck, Luke.
See you at
the rendezvous.
Luke smiles and nods at Wedge, then lowers himself into the cockpit of
his X-wing while Artoo waits in the cubbyhole, beeping impatiently.
LUKE
Don't worry, Artoo.
We're going,
we're going.
The canopy over the X-wing lowers and snaps shut.
LUKE'S X-WING
Luke's fighter, its wings closed, speeds away from the icy planet.
Soon it disappears into the stars.
The Millennium Falcon speeds away from Hoth, closely followed by one
huge Star Destroyer and four tiny TIE fighters.
As it is pursued, the Falcon races toward two very bright star-sized
objects.
The Millennium Falcon races toward one of the huge oncoming Star
Destroyers.
Suddenly, the Falcon starts into a deep dive straight
down, closely followed by four TIE fighters.
The underside of the Star
Destroyer continues on a collision course with two oncoming Star
Destroyers.
Slowly, it starts to veer to the left.
The Millennium Falcon races away from the colliding Star Destroyers,
still followed by four TIE fighters.
Laser bolts spark the pitch-black
skies.
The Falcon races into the starry vastness, followed by the four
Imperial TIE fighters and an Imperial Star Destroyer.
The Falcon turns into the asteroid storm and as the ship completes its
turn, asteroids start coming straight at the cockpit windows.
A large asteroid tumbles away from the Falcon's path at top speed.
Several smaller asteroids crash into the big one, creating small
explosions on its surface.
Other asteroids of all sizes pass by in
every direction, some colliding and exploding.
The tiny Millennium
Falcon veers around the big asteroid and races past it through the rain
of rocks, followed by four TIE fighters, which bob and weave around the
asteroids.
One of the pursuing TIE fighters connects with an asteroid and
explodes.
The other fighters are pelted with a steady stream of
smaller explosions.
Two huge asteroids tumble toward the Millennium Falcon, which quickly
banks around both of them.
The three TIE fighters follow in hot
pursuit until one of the fighters scrapes an asteroid and tumbles out
of control into deep space.
The massive Star Destroyer blasts oncoming asteroids as it follows the
Falcon.
Smaller asteroids explode across its vast surface.
The Falcon twists on its side as it races around an oncoming asteroid.
Two TIE fighters follow in the distance, coming from either side.
The Millennium Falcon dives toward the surface of one of the moon-sized
asteroids.
There is a continued display of explosions against the
starry void as smaller asteroids collide with larger chunks of rock.
The two remaining TIE fighters follow the Falcon to the large asteroid.
The Falcon skims the surface of the giant asteroid as, all the while,
small asteroids explode on the surface of the ship.
The TIE fighters approach the Falcon, but a giant asteroid hurtles
directly into their path.
As the asteroid continues on its way, it
leaves remains of the two exploded TIE fighters to tumble into deep
space.
The Millennium Falcon dives into the huge crater and disappears.
LUKE'S X-WING
The tiny X-wing speeds toward the cloud cover of Dagobah.
Artoo,
riding on the back of the fighter, turns his head back and forth with
some anxiety.
LUKE'S X-WING
The X-wing continues its flight through the twilight above the cloud-
covered planet.
The mist-shrouded X-wing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog.
Luke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as Artoo pops out
of his cubbyhole on the back.
The young warrior surveys the fog, which
is barely pierced by the ship's landing lights.
About all he can make
out are some giant, twisted trees nearby.
Artoo whistles anxiously.
LUKE
No, Artoo, you stay put.
I'll
have a look around.
Artoo lets out a short beep.
As Luke moves along the nose, Artoo loses
his balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake.
LUKE
Artoo?
Luke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo, but the water
is still and reveals no sign of the little droid.
LUKE
Artoo!
Where are you?
A small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is
heard.
The periscope starts to move to shore.
Relieved, Luke starts
running along the nose of the fighter to its tip.
LUKE
Artoo!
You be more careful.
The outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away.
Luke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the shore, and
turns to look for Artoo.
The periscope still steadily moves toward
shore.
LUKE
Artoo - that way!
Suddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving
toward the little droid.
The dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the
swampy water, making a loud clunk against Artoo's metal hull.
The
droid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream.
Holding his ignited lightsaber before him, Luke wades a few feet into
the murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend.
LUKE
Artoo!
The black surface is still as death itself... until a few bubbles begin
to appear.
Then, phheewaat!! The runt-size robot is spit out of the
water, makes a graceful arc, and comes crashing down into a patch of
soft gray moss.
LUKE
Oh, no!
Are you all right?
Come
on.
You're lucky you don't taste
very good.
Anything broken?
Luke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from
his round metal body.
Artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps.
LUKE
If you're saying coming here was
a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree
with you.
Oh, Artoo, what are we
doing here?
It's like... something
out of a dream, or, I don't know.
Maybe I'm just going crazy.
As Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him,
Artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports.
Admiral Piett hesitates in the entryway to Vader's private cubicle.
After a moment, he steps into the room and pauses at the surprising
sight before him.
Darth Vader, his back turned, is silhouetted in the gloom on the far
side of the chamber.
A black, insectlike droid attends him.
Among the
various apparatuses surrounding them, a respirator tube now retracts
from Vader's uncovered head.
The head is bald with a mass of ugly scar
tissue covering it.
The black droid then lowers the mask and helmet
onto Vader's head.
When it is in place, the Dark Lord turns to face
Piett.
VADER
Yes, Admiral?
PIETT
Our ships have sighted the
Millennium Falcon, lord.
But...
it has entered an asteroid field
and we cannot risk...
VADER
(interrupting)
Asteroids do not concern me,
Admiral.
I want that ship and
not excuses.
PIETT
Yes, lord.
The pirate starship rests in a dark, dripping asteroid cave.
It is so
dark that the cave's exact dimensions are impossible to determine.
The mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking
swamp.
Luke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing.
He ignites
a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it.
Taking a power
cable, he plugs it into Artoo's noselike socket.
LUKE
Ready for some power?
Okay.
Let's see now.
Put that in
there.
There you go.
The droid whistles his appreciation.
Luke then opens a container of
processed food and sits before the thermal heater.
LUKE
(sighs)
Now all I have to do is find this
Yoda... if he even exists.
Nervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle.
LUKE
Still... there's something familiar
about this place.
I feel like...
I don't know...
STRANGE VOICE
Feel like what?
Luke jumps out of his skin.
Artoo screeches in terror.
The young
warrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around, looking for the
speaker.
Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange,
bluish creature, not more than two feet tall.
The wizened little thing
is dressed in rags.
It motions toward Luke's sword.
LUKE
(looking at the
creature)
Like we're being watched!
CREATURE
Away with your weapon!
I mean
you no harm.
After some hesitation, Luke puts away his weapon, although he really
doesn't understand why.
Artoo watches with interest.
CREATURE
I am wondering, why are you here?
LUKE
I'm looking for someone.
CREATURE
Looking?
Found someone, you have,
I would say, hmmm?
The little creature laughs.
LUKE
(Trying to keep from
smiling)
Right.
CREATURE
Help you I can.
Yes, mmmm.
LUKE
I don't think so.
I'm looking
for a great warrior.
CREATURE
Ahhh!
A great warrior.
(laughs and shakes
his head)
Wars not make one great.
With the aid of a walking stick, the tiny stranger moves over to one of
the cases of supplies.
He begins to rummage around.
Artoo moves to the edge of the case - standing almost eye level to the
creature who is carelessly handling the supplies - and squeaks his
disapproval.
Their tiny visitor pick up the container of food Luke was eating from
and takes a bite.
LUKE
Put that down.
Hey!
That's my
dinner!
The creature spits out the bite he has taken.
He makes a face.
CREATURE
How you get so big, eating food
of this kind?
He flips the container in Luke's direction and reaches into one of
Luke's supply cases.
LUKE
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to
land in that puddle, and if we
could get our ship out, we would,
but we can't, so why don't you just...
CREATURE
(teasing)
Aww, cannot get your ship out?
The creature spots something of interest in Luke's case.
Luke loses
patience and grabs the case away.
The creature retains his prize - a
tiny power lamp - and examines it with delight.
LUKE
Hey, you could have broken this.
Don't do that.
Ohhh... you're
making a mess.
Hey, give me that!
CREATURE
(retreating with
the lamp)
Mine!
Or I will help you not.
Clutching its treasure, the creature backs away from Luke, drawing
closer to Artoo.
As Luke and the creature argue, one of Artoo's little
arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by
the creature.
LUKE
I don't want your help.
I want
my lamp back.
I'll need it to
get out of this slimy mudhole.
CREATURE
Mudhole?
Slimy?
My home this is.
Artoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately
engaged in a tug-of-war over it.
Artoo beeps a few angry, "Give me thats."
CREATURE
Ah, ah, ah!
LUKE
Oh, Artoo, let him have it!
CREATURE
Mine!
Mine!
LUKE
Artoo!
CREATURE
Mine!
The creature lets go with one hand and pokes Artoo lightly with one
finger.
Artoo reacts with a startled squeal, and lets go.
CREATURE
Mine!
LUKE
(fed up)
Now will you move along, little
fella?
We're got a lot of work
to do.
CREATURE
No!
No, no!
Stay and help you,
I will.
(laughs)
Find your friend, hmm?
LUKE
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
CREATURE
Oohhh.
Jedi Master.
Yoda.
You
seek Yoda.
LUKE
You know him?
CREATURE
Mmm.
Take you to him, I will.
(laughs)
Yes, yes.
But now, we must eat.
Come.
Good food.
Come.
With that, the creature scurries out of the clearing, laughing merrily.
Luke stares after him.
All he sees is the faint light from the small
power lamp moving through the fog.
Luke makes his decision and starts
after the creature.
CREATURE
(in the distance)
Come, come.
Artoo, very upset, whistles a blue streak of protest.
LUKE
Stay here and watch after the
camp, Artoo.
Artoo beeps even more frantically.
But as Luke disappears from view,
the worried little droid grows quieter, and utters a soft electronic
sigh.
The Imperial fleet moves through the asteroid-filled void, intently
seeking its prey.
Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves against the vast sea of stars
away from the rest of the fleet.
A heavy downpour of rain pounds through the gnarled trees.
A strange
baroque mud house sits on a moss-covered knoll on the edge of a small
lagoon.
The small, gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its
thick glass windows.
As rain tap-dances a merry tune on Artoo's head,
the stubby little droid rises up on his tip-toes to peek into one of
the glowing portals.
The Imperial fleet around Vader's ship is surrounded by the asteroid
storm.
Asteroids big and small pelt the vast exteriors of the menacing
ships.
One of the smaller Imperial vessels is hit by a huge asteroid
and explodes in a brilliant flash of light.
It is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave, too dark to see what is
attacking the ship.
Leia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave.
LEIA
This ground sure feels strange.
It doesn't feel like rock at all.
Han kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to study the outline
of the cave.
HAN
There's an awful lot of moisture
in here.
LEIA
I don't know.
I have a bad feeling
about this.
HAN
Yeah.
Chewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the ship's
cockpit.
A five-foot-long shape can be seen moving across the top of
the Falcon.
The leathery creature lets out a screech as Han blasts it
with a laser bolt.
HAN
(to Leia)
Watch out!
The black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front
of the princess.
Han bends down to investigate the dead creature.
HAN
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Mynock.
Chewie, check the rest
of the ship, make sure there
aren't any more attached.
They're
chewing on the power cables.
LEIA
Mynocks?
HAN
Go on inside.
We'll clean them
off if there are any more.
Just then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air.
Leia
puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the
ship.
Chewie shoos another Mynock away with his blaster.
Several of
the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit
window of the Falcon.
Inside, Threepio shudders at their presence.
THREEPIO
Ohhh!
Go away!
Go away!
Beastly
little thing.
Shoo!
Shoo!
Han looks around the strange, dripping cave.
HAN
Wait a minute...
He unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave.
The cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle.
Chewie barks and moves for the ship, followed closely by Leia and Han.
The large wings of the Mynocks flap past them as they protect their
faces and run up the platform.
The enormous space slug moves its head out of the cave as the Falcon
flies out of its mouth.
The monster tilts its head, watching the
starship fly away.
The Falcon races out of the asteroid crater and into the deadly rain of
the asteroid storm.
With Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of the many thick
vines that grow in the swamp.
Panting heavily, he continues his course
- climbing, flipping through the air, jumping over roots, and racing in
and out of the heavy ground fog.
YODA
Run!
Yes.
A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.
But beware
of the dark side.
Anger... fear...
aggression.
The dark side of
the Force are they.
Easily they flow, quick to join
you in a fight.
If once you
start down the dark path, forever
will it dominate your destiny,
consume you it will, as it did
Obi-Wan's apprentice.
LUKE
Vader.
Is the dark side stronger?
YODA
No... no... no.
Quicker, easier,
more seductive.
LUKE
But how am I to know the good side
from the bad?
YODA
You will know.
When you are calm,
at peace.
Passive.
A Jedi uses
the Force for knowledge and
defense, never for attack.
LUKE
But tell me why I can't...
YODA
(interrupting)
No, no, there is no why.
Nothing
more will I teach you today.
Clear your mind of questions.
Mmm.
Mmmmmmmm.
Artoo beeps in the distance as Luke lets Yoda down to the ground.
Breathing heavily, he takes his shirt from a nearby tree branch and
pulls it on.
He turns to see a huge, dead, black tree, its base surrounded by a few
feet of water.
Giant, twisted roots form a dark and sinister cave on
one side.
Luke stares at the tree, trembling.
LUKE
There's something not right here.
Yoda sits on a large root, poking his Gimer Stick into the dirt.
LUKE
I feel cold, death.
YODA
That place... is strong with the
dark side of the Force.
A domain
of evil it is.
In you must go.
LUKE
What's in there?
YODA
Only what you take with you.
Luke looks warily between the tree and Yoda.
He starts to strap on his
weapon belt.
YODA
Your weapons... you will not
need them.
Luke gives the tree a long look, than shakes his head "no."
Yoda
shrugs.
Luke reaches up to brush aside some hanging vines and enters
the tree.
Meanwhile, Yoda sits on the root, calmly leaning on his Gimer Stick.
Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves through space, guarded by its
convoy of TIE fighters.
The Millennium Falcon speeds through deep space, closely followed by a
firing Imperial Star Destroyer.
A large asteroid about the same size
as the Falcon tumbles rapidly toward the starship.
The tiny Falcon
banks to avoid the giant asteroid as smaller rocks pelt its surface.
Then the small craft roars under the asteroid which explodes harmlessly
on the hull of the vast Star Destroyer.
The Falcon is hit hard by another bolt from the Star Destroyer which
creates a huge explosion near the cockpit of the smaller ship.
The
Falcon tilts steeply, then rights itself.
The Falcon banks, makes a steep, twisting turn.
In the next moment it
is racing toward the Star Destroyer, looking very small against the
massive surface of the Imperial ship.
As it moves across the surface
of the Star Destroyer, the Falcon bobs and weaves to avoid the numerous
flak bursts.
Luke's face is upside-down and showing enormous strain.
He stands on
his hands, with Yoda perched on his feet.
Opposite Luke and Yoda are
two rocks the size of bowling balls.
Luke stares at the rocks and
concentrates.
One of the rocks lifts from the ground and floats up to
rest on the other.
YODA
Use the Force.
Yes...
Yoda taps Luke's leg.
Quickly, Luke lifts one hand from the ground.
His body wavers, but he maintains his balance.
Artoo, standing nearby,
is whistling and beeping frantically.
YODA
Now... the stone.
Feel it.
Luke concentrates on trying to lift the top rock.
It rises a few feet,
shaking under the strain.
But, distracted by Artoo's frantic beeping,
Luke loses his balance and finally collapses.
Yoda jumps clear.
YODA
Concentrate!
Annoyed at the disturbance, Luke looks over at Artoo, who is rocking
urgently back and forth in front of him.
Artoo waddles closer to Luke, chirping wildly, then scoots over the
edge of the swamp.
Catching on, Luke rushes to the water's edge.
The
X-wing fighter has sunk, and only the tip of its nose shows above the
lake's surface.
LUKE
Oh, no.
We'll never get it out
now.
Yoda stamps his foot in irritation.
YODA
So certain are you.
Always with
you it cannot be done.
Hear you
nothing that I say?
Luke looks uncertainly out at the ship.
LUKE
Master, moving stones around is
one thing.
This is totally
different.
YODA
No!
No different!
Only different
in your mind.
You must unlearn
what you have learned.
LUKE
(focusing, quietly)
All right, I'll give it a try.
YODA
No!
Try not.
Do.
Or do not.
There is no try.
Luke closes his eyes and concentrates on thinking the ship out.
Slowly, the X-wing's nose begins to rise above the water.
It hovers
for a moment and then slides back, disappearing once again.
LUKE
(panting heavily)
I can't.
It's too big.
YODA
Size matters not.
Look at me.
Judge me by my size, do you?
Hm?
Mmmm.
Luke shakes his head.
YODA
And well you should not.
For my
ally in the Force.
And a powerful
ally it is.
Life creates it, makes
it grow.
Its energy surrounds us
and binds us.
Luminous beings
are we...
(Yoda pinches
Luke's shoulder)
... not this crude matter.
(a sweeping gesture)
You must feel the Force around you.
(gesturing)
Here, between you... me... the
tree... the rock... everywhere!
Yes, even between this land and
that ship!
LUKE
(discouraged)
You want the impossible.
Quietly Yoda turns toward the X-wing fighter.
With his eyes closed and
his head bowed, he raises his arm and points at the ship.
Soon, the fighter rises above the water and moves forward as Artoo
beeps in terror and scoots away.
The entire X-wing moves majestically, surely, toward the shore.
Yoda
stands on a tree root and guides the fighter carefully down toward the
beach.
Luke stares in astonishment as the fighter settles down onto the shore.
He walks toward Yoda.
LUKE
I don't... I don't believe it.
YODA
That is why you fail.
Luke shakes his head, bewildered.
The fleet around Vader's Star Destroyer now includes Needa's Star
Destroyer, the Avenger.
Vader's ship moves away, flanked by its fleet of smaller ships.
the
Avenger glides off into space in the opposite direction.
No one on
that ship or on Vader's is aware that, clinging to the side of the
Avenger, is the pirateship, the Millennium Falcon.
As the Avenger Star Destroyer moves slowly into space, the hatch on its
underbelly opens, sending a trail of junk behind it.
Hidden among the
refuse, the Falcon tumbles away.
In the next moment, the Avenger roars
off into hyperspace.
The Falcon's engines are ignited, and it races
off into the distance.
Amidst the slowly drifting junk, Boba Fett's
ship appears and moves after the Falcon.
In the clearing behind Yoda's house, Luke again stands upside-down, but
his face shows less strain and more concentration than before.
Yoda
sits on the ground below the young warrior.
On the other side of the
clearing, two equipment cases slowly rise into the air.
Nearby Artoo
watches, humming to himself, when suddenly he, too, rises into the air.
His little legs kick desperately and his head turns frantically,
looking for help.
YODA
Concentrate... feel the Force
flow.
Yes.
Good.
Calm, yes.
Through the Force, things you
will see.
Other places.
The
future... the past.
Old friends
long gone.
Luke suddenly becomes distressed.
LUKE
Han!
Leia!
The two packing boxes and Artoo fall to the ground with a crash, then
Luke himself tumbles over.
YODA
(shaking his head)
Hmm.
Control, control.
You must
learn control.
LUKE
I saw... I saw a city in the
clouds.
YODA
Mmm.
Friends you have there.
LUKE
They were in pain.
YODA
It is the future you see.
LUKE
Future?
Will they die?
Yoda closes his eyes and lowers his head.
YODA
Difficult to see.
Always in
motion is the future.
LUKE
I've got to go to them.
YODA
Decide you must how to serve
them best.
If you leave now,
help them you could.
But you
would destroy all for which they
have fought and suffered.
Luke is stopped cold by Yoda's words.
Gloom shrouds him as he nods his
head sadly.
The powerful pirate starship blasts through space as it heads toward
the soft pink planet of Bespin.
It is down on the gaseous planet.
Huge billowing clouds form a canyon
as the ship banks around them, heading toward the system's Cloud City.
Suddenly, two twin-pod cloud cars appear and move toward the Falcon.
The cloud cars draw up alongside the starship.
The clouds part to reveal a full view of the city as it bobs in and out
of the cloud surface.
The cloud cars and the Falcon head for the
gleaming white metropolis.
With the cloud cars still guarding it, the Falcon lands on one of the
Cloud City's platforms.
Han and Leia stand at the open door, armed.
Behind them, Chewie, also
armed, surveys the scene warily.
THREEPIO
Oh.
No one to meet us.
LEIA
I don't like this.
HAN
Well, what would you like?
THREEPIO
Well, they did let us land.
HAN
Look, don't worry.
Everything's
going to be fine.
Trust me.
HAN
See?
My friend.
(to Chewie)
Keep your eyes open, okay?
Chewie growls as Han walks down the ramp.
Lando and his men head
across the bridge to meet the space pirate.
Lando stops ten feet from Han.
The two men eye each other carefully.
Lando shakes his head.
LANDO
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler!
You've got a
lot of guts coming here, after
what you pulled.
Han points to himself innocently, mouthing, "Me?"
Lando moves threateningly toward Han.
Suddenly, he throws his arms
around his startled, long-lost friend and embraces him.
LANDO
(laughs)
How you doing, you old pirate?
So good to see you!
I never thought
I'd catch up with you again.
Where
you been?
The two old friends embrace, laughing and chuckling.
THREEPIO
Well, he seems very friendly.
LEIA
(wary)
Yes... very friendly.
LANDO
What are you doing here?
HAN
(gestures toward
the Falcon)
Ahh... repairs.
I thought you
could help me out.
LANDO
(in mock panic)
What have you done to my ship?
HAN
Your ship?
Hey, remember, you
lost her to me fair and square.
Chewie growls a reserved greeting.
Lando suddenly notices the princess
and smiles.
LANDO
Hello.
What have we here?
Welcome.
I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this
facility.
And who might you be?
LEIA
Leia.
LANDO
Welcome, Leia.
Lando bows before Leia and kisses her hand.
HAN
All right, all right, you old
smoothie.
Han takes Leia by the hand and steers her away from Lando.
THREEPIO
Hello, sir.
I am See-Threepio,
human-cyborg relations.
My
facilities are at your...
Before Threepio can finish his self-introduction, Lando has turned to
follow Han and Leia, who are walking toward the city.
THREEPIO
Well, really!
Lando, his aide, Lobot, and Han lead the way across the bridge,
followed by Threepio, Chewie and Leia.
LANDO
What's wrong with the Falcon?
HAN
Hyperdrive.
LANDO
I'll get my people to work on it.
HAN
Good.
Lando turns to Leia.
LANDO
You know, that ship saved my life
quite a few times.
She's the
fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.
In the bright lights of the fighter, Luke loads a heavy case into the
belly of the ship.
Artoo sits on top of the X-wing, settling down into
his cubbyhole.
Yoda stands nearby on a log.
YODA
Luke!
You must complete the
training.
LUKE
I can't keep the vision out of my
head.
They're my friends.
I've
got to help them.
YODA
You must not go!
LUKE
But Han and Leia will die if I
don't.
BEN'S VOICE
You don't know that.
Luke looks toward the voice in amazement.
Ben has materialized as a
real, slightly shimmering image near Yoda.
The power of his presence
stops Luke.
BEN
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
LUKE
But I can help them!
I feel
the Force!
BEN
But you cannot control it.
This
is a dangerous time for you,
when you will be tempted by the
dark side of the Force.
YODA
Yes, yes.
To Obi-Wan you listen.
The cave.
Remember your failure
at the cave!
LUKE
But I've learned so much since
then.
Master Yoda, I promise to
return and finish what I've begun.
You have my word.
BEN
It is you and your abilities the
Emperor wants.
that is why your
friends are made to suffer.
LUKE
And that is why I have to go.
BEN
Luke, I don't want to lose you to
the Emperor the way I lost Vader.
LUKE
You won't.
YODA
Stopped they must be.
On this
all depends.
Only a fully trained
Jedi Knight with the Force as his
ally will conquer Vader and his
Emperor.
If you end your training
now, if you choose the quick and
easy path, as Vader did, you will
become an agent of evil.
BEN
Patience.
LUKE
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
YODA
If you honor what they fight for
... yes!
Luke is in great anguish.
He struggles with the dilemma, a battle
raging in his mind.
BEN
If you choose to face Vader, you
will do it alone.
I cannot
interfere.
LUKE
I understand.
(he moves to his
X-wing)
Artoo, fire up the converters.
Artoo whistles a happy reply.
BEN
Luke, don't give in to hate -
that leads to the dark side.
Luke nods and climbs into his ship.
YODA
Strong is Vader.
Mind what you
have learned.
Save you it can.
LUKE
I will.
And I'll return.
I promise.
Artoo closes the cockpit.
Ben and Yoda stand watching as the roar of
the engines and the wind engulf them.
YODA
(sighs)
Told you, I did.
Reckless is
he.
Now matters are worse.
BEN
That boy is our last hope.
YODA
(looks up)
No.
There is another.
Luke's tiny X-wing rockets away from the green planet of Dagobah and
off into space.
LUKE'S X-WING - BESPIN SYSTEM
Luke's X-wing races through thick clouds toward Cloud City.
LUKE'S X-WING
Luke's X-wing moves through the clouds as it nears the city.
The two guards slide Han's encased body into an opening in the side of
the bounty hunter's ship.
Boba Fett climb aboard on a ladder next to
the cargo hold.
BOBA FETT
Put Captain Solo in the cargo
hold.
And with that, the door slams shut.
An elevator door slides open and Lando, Leia, and Chewbacca race for a
large bay overlooking the East Landing Platform.
Just as they arrive, Boba Fett's ship takes off against a cloudy sunset
sky.
In wild anguish, Chewie howls and starts firing at the ship.
THREEPIO
Oh, no!
Chewie, they're behind
you!
A laser bolt explodes near the princess.
Everyone turns to see what
Threepio has already spotted coming from the other direction; a squad
of stormtroopers running toward them.
Artoo peeks out from the
elevator.
Leia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando makes a break
for the elevator.
Laser bolts continue to explode around the princess
and the Wookiee, but they refuse to budge.
Lando sticks his head out
of the elevator and motions for the pair to run, but they barely
notice.
They seem possessed, transported, as all the frustration of
captivity and anger of loss pour through their death-dealing weapons.
But after a few moments, they begin to move through the rain of laser
fire toward the elevator.
Once they are inside, the door slams shut
and the stormtroopers race forward.
They race for the Millennium Falcon as a battalion of stormtroopers
reaches the main door.
Lando and Leia hold off the troops as the
droids get on board with Chewie.
As Chewie bounds to the ship the
Threepio on his back, Threepio hits his head on the top of the ramp.
THREEPIO
Ouch!
Oh!
Ah!
That hurt.
Bend
down, you thoughtless... Ow!
Chewie starts up the ship.
The giant engines begin to whine as Lando
and Leia race up the ramp under a hail of laser fire.
LANDO
Leia!
Go!
The Millennium Falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight sky and roars
away from the city.
Troops fire after it and TIE fighters take off in
pursuit.
Unable to hang onto the pipe, Luke tumbles out, emerging at the
undermost part of Cloud City.
Reaching out desperately, he manages to
grab onto on electronic weather vane.
LUKE
Ben... Ben, please!
Luke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips back down.
He hooks one of his legs around the fragile instruments.
All the
while, a powerful current of air rushes out at him from the exhaust
pipe.
LUKE
Ben.
Leia!
There is an ominous cracking sound from the base of the
weather vane and a piece breaks off, falling into the clouds far below.
LUKE
Hear me!
Leia!
The Falcon makes a graceful banking turn back toward Cloud City.
Vader enters the landing platform and watches as the speck that is the
Falcon disappears.
The wind blows at his cape.
He turns to two aides who are standing near the entrance to the landing
platform.
VADER
Bring my shuttle.
Nearly unconscious, Luke hangs upside-down on the weather vane as his
body shifts in the wind.
The Falcon dives to the underside of the floating city.
Three TIE
fighter close in on the starship.
Luke hangs by one arm from the crossbar of the weather vane.
He slips
from the bar and grabs onto the pole of the vane as the Falcon banks
toward him.
The Falcon positions itself under Luke as Lando moves up
through the opening of the hatch.
Luke begins to slide and finally
falls from the vane into space.
Three TIE fighters race toward the Falcon, firing away.
The Falcon races away.
It is closely followed by three TIE fighters,
all of which keep up a heavy laser assault on the fleeing starship.
The Falcon, still followed by the three TIE fighters, races away from
the cloud-covered city.
In the distance the TIE fighters continue their chase, still shooting
lasers.
Vader's Star Destroyer moves behind them, determinedly
following the Falcon.
The Falcon races through space followed very closely by the TIE
fighters and the huge Imperial Star Destroyer.
The Falcon soars into infinity and away from the huge Star Destroyer
which seems, by contrast, to stand still.
The Millennium Falcon is attached to a huge Rebel cruiser by a docking
tube.
Rebel fighters move about the giant cruiser, and a Rebel
transport ship hovers near the fleet.
While Luke, Leia, and the droids stand, looking out the window of the
star cruiser, two escort fighters join the large ship.
Slowly, the
cruiser turns and moves away into space.
