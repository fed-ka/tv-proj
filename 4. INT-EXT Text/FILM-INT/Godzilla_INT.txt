We TRACK across the complicated computerized
navigational console that is actually steering the
immense ship. In the b.g. we HEAR a Japanese t.v.
program playing.
At the end of the console is the ship's SKIPPER, an
overweight Japanese seaman sleepily watches a snowy
satellite broadcast of a Sumo wrestling match.
Suddenly the SONAR blares out a warning ALARM. Startled,
the Skipper awakes and stumbles out of his chair over to
the console.
The SONAR displays an enormous MASS heading quickly
toward the ship. The Skipper's eyes go wide. He hits a
KLAXON alarm, awaking the entire ship. He presses the
radio/intercom.
SKIPPER
(in Japanese)
Captain. This is the bridge. We have
an emergency.
4
4
Alarms BLARING. The crew rushes out of their quarters
and into the hall. Quickly they race for the upper
decks.

5
The ship's elderly COOK pokes his head out of the
kitchen and yells at some of the crew as they pass by.
COOK
(in Japanese)
What's going on? What's happening?
Before anyone can answer, the ship is ROCKED by an
enormous THUD as something hits the side of the immense
ship. The crew TUMBLES as the ship SWAYS VIOLENTLY.
The old Cook is thrown to the floor. He looks up
nervously.
6
6
The CAPTAIN enters quickly, joining the Skipper at the
console.
CAPTAIN
(in Japanese)
What was that!?
SKIPPER
(in Japanese)
I can't tell...
Again, the ship is HIT. An enormous CRASHING SOUND is
HEARD as the ship ROCKS to one side, tossing the Captain
and Skipper to the floor.
Suddenly we HEAR the tell-tale, famous SCREAMING WAIL of
our creature from somewhere outside. Terror shines in
the Captain's eyes at the sound.
7
7
The crew, getting back on their feet, reacts to the
horrible WAILING SOUND.
Suddenly the ship is HIT AGAIN. This time something
enormous RIPS THROUGH THE HULL, crushing one of the crew
members as it TEARS THROUGH THE WALLS.
Water RUSHES THROUGH the large gaping hole, quickly
filling the hallway. The Cook and what's left of the
crew scurry for the stairs, as the water level chases
them.
8
8
The ship's computers are WHIRLING with warning lights
and alarms. As the Skipper tries to adjust the controls
in vain, the Captain grabs the ship's p.a. system.
CAPTAIN
(in Japanese)
Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Man the
lifeboats...
But before he can say anything more, something WHIPS
across the bridge's enormous windshield, SHATTERING THE
GLASS. Was it a tail? No way, far too big.

The utility van races through this small Russian town
right past a roadblock marked with the international
signs for "no trespass" and "nuclear radiation."
NICK
..."What a glorious feeling. I'm happy
again..."
As the van disappears down the road, we CRANE UP
revealing a city sign reading: CHERNOBYL, RUSSIA.

Raymond leads the official looking group down the hall.
A BRIEFING OFFICER rushes over. (The following dialog is
entirely in French with subtitles)
BRIEFING OFFICER
The Japanese consulate has been
calling and we've been getting
pressure from the Americans.
RAYMOND
What did you tell them?
BRIEFING OFFICER
Nothing yet.
RAYMOND
Are there any other survivors?
BRIEFING OFFICER
Only one, Sir. He was very lucky.
The group arrives at a door at the end of the hall. The
Briefing Officer opens the door.
RAYMOND'S P.O.V. - THROUGH OPEN DOOR
In the corner of the large room we see the old Cook from
the tanker curled up in the fetal position. The doctors
and a few nurses are attending to him.
RAYMOND
Get them out of there.
Two of the Officials move in and escort the Doctors and
Nurses out of the room. Raymond nods to two other
Officials who begin to unpack some recording equipment,
including a video camera.
15
15
Raymond enters and moves close to the old Cook, kneeling
down in front of him, inspecting his distant glare. The
old Cook seems to be in a world of his own, rocking back
and forth. Raymond nods to another Official who comes
forward.
RAYMOND
(in French)
Ask him what happened.
The Second Official ask him in Japanese, but the old
Cook does not respond. He asks again but the old Cook
seems to be in a world of his own.
BRIEFING OFFICER
(in English)
It's no use. He's been like this since
we fished him out of the ocean.
Whatever happened to that tanker put
him in a complete state of shock.
Raymond takes out his lighter and ignites it on high.
The old Cook's eyes slowly come back to life, transfixed
by the fire. Slowly he brings the flame close to the old
Cook's face.
RAYMOND
(in English)
What did you see, old man?
Drawn out of himself by the flame...
OLD COOK
(weakly)
Gojira...Gojira...
Raymond shoots a look at the Second Official for an
explanation.
SECOND OFFICIAL
(in English)
I have no idea what he is saying.
OLD COOK
(stronger)
...Gojira!...Gojira!...GOJIRA!!

As we WIDEN we see this is one of several wall mounted
monitors all showing channel WNEW. Through the glass
doorway nearby we see CHARLES CAIMAN, 40's, handsome,
entering the office.
AUDREY (O.S.)
Murray wants these copied to each
field producer...
ANGLE - SECRETARY DESK
Standing in front of the desk is AUDREY TIMMONDS, early
thirties, attractive, small town girl who still hasn't
toughened in the big city and talking with her
co-worker, LUCY, sitting.
AUDREY
And I'm supposed to remind you to call
him on all of Caiman's expense
p.o.'s.
LUCY
Speak of the devil.
Just then Caiman passes behind them.
AUDREY
(nervous)
Think I should ask him? I'm going to
ask him. You think I should? I will.
Audrey makes the decision and bolts after Caiman. Lucy
rolls her eyes.
LUCY
Oh girl...
ANGLE - CAIMAN
As he walks towards his office Audrey races up to him.
Seeing her, he walks faster hoping to avoid her. He
can't.
AUDREY
Did you talk with Humphries?
CAIMAN
This is not the place...
AUDREY
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
CAIMAN
He said he'd consider it. It's between
you and Rodriguez.
AUDREY
Are you serious? He's going to
consider me for he job? What else did
he say?
They arrive at his office. An enormous standee of
himself with the ACTION NEWS CREW is there.
CAIMAN
Why don't I tell you over dinner
tonight? Your place.
He stops at his door. Audrey is startled.
AUDREY
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
CAIMAN
And you're beautiful...
AUDREY
Mr. Caiman...
CAIMAN
Call me Charlie.
AUDREY
(stubbornly)
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra
research for you after hours and
weekends for nearly a year. And I've
never asked for anything but this job
is really important to me. I'm too old
to be an assistant anymore. I need to
know this job is going someplace.
CAIMAN
So have dinner with me tonight.
AUDREY
I can't.
CAIMAN
It's your choice.
Caiman shuts the door on her. She turns and is face to
face with the standee of Caiman. She takes out her
chewing gum and plasters it on his nose.

Elsie, Nick and Clive are cramped together along with
Nick's equipment in the back of the jeep. Nick looks
very uncomfortable. Elsie looks at Nick...lasciviously.
ELSIE
Three years digging up worms in
Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos
handle it?
NICK
Oh, I'm not married.
ELSIE
Really? A girlfriend then?
NICK
No. Perhaps I work too much.
ELSIE
(filtered)
You mean to tell me that there is no
one who holds a special place in your
heart?
Nick seems to get lost in thought.
NICK
Not for a long time, now.
ELSIE
Well, I think you're cute.
NICK
(awkward)
Oh, thank you.
(whispered to Clive)
Is she always like this?
CLIVE
(conspiratorially)
I had to beat her off with a stick.
The sound of a HELICOPTER ZOOMS overhead.
AERIAL SHOT - HELICOPTER - SAME - DAY
A helicopter ZOOMS past our convoy. As we FOLLOW the
helicopter we REVEAL...
JAMAICAN BEACH WITH A BEACHED CARGO SHIP - DAY
Taking up nearly the entire beach, an enormous cargo
ship lays on its side in the sand. Two gigantic holes,
ripped into its hull.
MILITARY JEEPS
Nick hops out and joins Major Hicks et al as they push
past the gathered crowd of onlookers. The group gives a
collective gasp as they see the ship for the first
time.
Three men (who we'll recognize from the Tahiti hospital)
take measurements of the holes in the ship.
MAJOR HICKS
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those
people away from there.
RAYMOND
(French accent)
They are with me!
Everyone in the group turns to find Mr. Phillip
Raymond.
MAJOR HICKS
And who are you?
Raymond hands him, as well as anyone who wants one, his
business card.
RAYMOND
CHARGEURES, property and casualty
insurance. We are preparing a report.
MAJOR HICKS
You're fast.
RAYMOND
That is our job.
MAJOR HICKS
Well your people are getting in the
way of my job.
RAYMOND
Major, what do you think could have
done this?
MAJOR HICKS
Get your people out of there or I
will.
The Major walks away. Raymond studies him as he does.
ANGLE - SHIP
Nick can't take his eyes off the enormous holes in the
hull. He steps closer and turns to Peters, who's taking
radiation counts of the ship.
NICK
Mind if I borrow this?
Peter hands him his Geiger counter and walks into the
cracked hull of the ship.
22
22
Inside is eerily dark and creepy. The guts of the ship
are tangled inside. Holding a Geiger counter, he gets
readings from all over the area. One particular spot,
above him, seems slightly stronger.
Nick SEES something there. He opens his knapsack and
puts on some rubber gloves, removing a glass jar (like
the ones from Chernobyl)
Carefully he climbs the debris until he reaches a sharp
shard of metal. Clinging to it he finds a MEATY CHUNK OF
REPTILE FLESH.
He tries remove it but he only gets half. He places it
into his jar. Just as he reaches for the other half,
SOMETHING GIVES WAY.
With a JOLT, the section above him collapses. A rush of
water falls and a HUMAN BODY swings down, just in front
of him.
Nick tumbles backwards, his heart pounding. The body
swings lifelessly as it hangs from above.
The others rush to his side, checking to see if he's all
right.
PETERS
You okay, Nick?
NICK
Yeah, I'm...wait...I lost...
Nick looks around frantically when the glass sample jar
is suddenly handed to him.
RAYMOND
Are you looking for this?
NICK
Thanks.
Raymond studies Nick as he joins the rest outside.
DISSOLVE TO:
UNDERWATER - NETS - MOVING P.O.V.
We are moving very quickly underwater. Ahead of us are
some large FISHING NETS with a catch of fish carried in
the bunt. Quickly we are heading for a collision.
23
28
Nick sits on the floor surrounded by his sloppily
unpacked equipment as he places the slide under his
microscope, examining his specimen.
Quickly stepping over him a young SOLDIER rushes over to
Major Hicks, seated with the rest of the team on the
plane's opposing benches. The Solider interrupts their
discussion.
SOLDIER
Major, we just got a report of a
fishing trawler going down. Exact
position, forty seven degrees
latitude, 67 longitude.
MAJOR HICKS
What makes you think it's related?
SOLDIER
The trawler was pulled under.
The team exchanges worried glances. Hicks moves over to
a map where the other incidents have been marked. He
traces his finger up the 67th longitude until he hits
the 47th parallel. Just off the East Coast.
MAJOR HICKS
Jesus Christ! It's only two hundred
miles off the American Eastern
seaboard and we don't even know what
it is.
ELSIE
Theropoda Allosaurus. Some type of
enormous reptile the likes of which we
haven't seen since the age of
prehistoric dinosaurs.
CLIVE
(sarcastic)
So where's been hiding the last sixty
million years?
ELSIE
The depth and breath of the ocean
floor has barely been explored. His
kind could have survived there
completely undetected.
NICK (O.S.)
What about the traces of radiation?
Everyone turns to discover Nick has walked over holding
his loosely scribbled notes in his hand.
NICK
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's
the clue. This creature is far too
unique on every level to be some lost
dinosaur.
MAJOR HICKS
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me
what the hell it is.
NICK
What do we know? It was first sighted
off the French Polynesian Pacific. An
area that has been exposed to dozens
of nuclear tests over the last thirty
years.
ELSIE
Hence the radiation.
NICK
More than that. I believe this is a
mutated aberration, a hybrid from the
fall out in that region.
CLIVE
(sarcastic)
Like your earthworms?
NICK
Yes! We're looking at a completely
incipient creature. The dawn of a new
species. The first of its kind.
CUT TO:
OCEAN WATER
Racing close to the ocean waters below, something DARK
and ENORMOUS moves swiftly below the surface. We TILT UP

Dripping wet, Audrey enters from the rain, removing her
raincoat. She walks to a booth where Lucy and ANIMAL, a
slovenly, Italian video cameraman is his mid-thirties,
are taking their lunch break. Animal has two plates of
food he cobbles down.
AUDREY
(sitting)
My life sucks.
LUCY
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck.
His life sucks.
ANIMAL
(between chews)
That's cuz I'm married to you.
LUCY
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
ANIMAL
Big bites.
AUDREY
I can't believe he put the moves on
me. After everything I've done for
him.
LUCY
He's scum! As far as he's concerned
you're just a pair of breasts that
talk.
ANIMAL
I like that image.
AUDREY
You know how I spent last weekend?
Walking his damned dog.
LUCY
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a
douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap,
puke chunks...
ANIMAL
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
LUCY
Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's
your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in
this town. You gotta be a killer to
get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't
got what it takes.
AUDREY
Animal, you don't think that's true,
do you?
ANIMAL
Nice guys finish last. First rule of
the jungle.
AUDREY
Well, I can be tough if I want.
ANIMAL & LUCY
Yeah, sure.
AUDREY
(seeing something)
Oh my God!
Everything turns to see what Audrey is looking at.
Audrey gets up and rushes over to a television above the
counter.
AUDREY
(excitedly)
Turn that up, turn it up.
The waitress does. On the t.v. plays the same news story
we saw from before from Panama. This time we SEE Nick
and Major Hicks walking on the beach.
AUDREY
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know
him!
LUCY
(unimpressed)
Who is he?
AUDREY
He was my college sweetie! Look at
him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What
the hell is he doing in Panama.

DAY
Through the swinging windshield wipers of the bus we see
the JFK highway in front of us. Suddenly we see...
AN ENORMOUS FOOT
Comes crashing down atop JFK highway, crushing it. The
TRANSIT BUS tumbles off the demolished highway.
The man in the MARKET TRUCK is TOSSED and ENORMOUS TEETH
puncture the top and bottom of his truck as it's LIFTED
IN THE AIR. The man LEAPS from the open back of the
truck.
He lands, HARD, down in front of one of the fish market
stores as hundreds of fish RAIN DOWN from above. With a
loud CRASH, the demolished truck SLAMS to the ground
nearby.
33
34
Caiman's on the phone as his SECRETARY enters with some
files. Rain and thunder continue outside.
CAIMAN
(into phone)
I don't give a crap about some war in
a country I can't pronounce. That's
not a lead story. Find me a damned
story, will ya!
Just then his Secretary notices a desk lamp, the shade
SHAKING and the light FLICKERING. She hears the THUMPING
approaching. She turns and SEES...
GIGANTIC TEETH
The enormous head of GODZILLA growls as it passes by
Caiman's office window.
SECRETARY
Mr. Caiman. I think your story just
walked by the window.
Caiman turns but there's nothing there. He's confused,
she's dazed.
CAIMAN
What?
Just then the TAIL WHIRLS past with a THUNDERS whip.
35
35
Animal, Lucy and Audrey are at the cashier paying.
LUCY
Did Romeo have a name?
AUDREY
Nick Tatopoulos.
ANIMAL
That why you dumped him?
AUDREY
No! I just couldn't see myself with
some boring egg head who spends his
summer picking apart cockroaches. I
wanted to have some adventure, some
fun...
LUCY
And now you live the glamorous life of
Caiman's assistant. Life's a bitch,
ain't it?
In the distance we can HEAR the THUMPING approaching.
ANIMAL
How long where you and dis guy goin'
steady?
AUDREY
Nearly four years...
LUCY
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he
didn't ask you to marry him.
AUDREY
That's the problem. He did.
Suddenly the THUMPING gets LOUDER very quickly. Everyone
in the diner reacts.
LUCY
Tell me that's not another goddamned
parade.
The next THUMP RATTLES the entire diner. Things begin to
fall. Through the window we see people RUNNING in
PANIC.
ANIMAL
That's ain't no parade...
Before anyone can speak the entire building is SHAKING.
Through the front window we SEE...
GODZILLA'S FOOT
Smashing down directly outside the window. Cars are
SMASHED. One car SAILS directly INTO THE WINDOW,
shattering it.
Animal uses his size to COVER the girls from the falling
debris. As the danger passes, Animal charges for the
door.
LUCY
Victor, wait!
36
39
Just as they arrive at a military roadblock. Crowds have
gathered as the military try to keep them at bay.
40
41
Still in construction. The team enters.
MAJOR HICKS
Status report?
SERGEANT
We've lost sight of it, Sir.
MAJOR HICKS
You want to run that by me again?
SERGEANT
(nervous)
After the initial attack he
just...disappeared.
OFFICER
(interrupting)
Major, Secretary of Defense Burk on
the line.
This takes Major Hicks off guard. The last person he
wants to talk to. Nick walks over to the Sergeant.
NICK
I don't understand. How can something
that large just disappear?
SERGEANT
We're not sure. We're scanning the
area now.
ELSIE
He probably returned to the river.
Just like everywhere else we've been,
we're always one step behind.
Nick turns and notices the back of the tent is open
revealing a beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline.
Several soldiers enter, setting up telescopes.
NICK
I don't think so.
Over Manhattan we see several dark plumes of smoke from
the destruction. Military helicopters scan the city.
Staring out at the skyline, Nick is mesmerized.
NICK
I mean, look at it. It's perfect. An
island, water on all sides. But like
no other island in the world, this is
a place where he can easily hide.
(beat)
He's in there someplace.
A SOLDIER comes rushing in.
SOLDIER
Channel eight caught it on film!
He rushes over to a bank of monitors, turns one on. On
the screen we SEE the shaky video Animal took of the
creature just as it was about to step on him.
CAIMAN
(filtered)
...WNEW's exclusive images of the
creature were taken less than a half
hour ago.
Nick and Elsie's jaws nearly hit the floor at the sight
of the immense creature.
CAIMAN
Cameraman Victor "Animal" Palotti
barely survived this vicious attack to
provide us with this footage.
The sounds of applause lead us to...
42
42
Everyone is applauding as Animal, carrying crates of
equipment, passes the t.v. playing the same news story.
Embarrassed, Animal smiles awkwardly.
CO-WORKERS
Way to go Animal! That's my man!
Animal passes Audrey and Lucy who are packing up some
files.
AUDREY
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you
scared?
ANIMAL
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna
kill me.
LUCY
Damned right, you crazy Wop!
We SEE the room is in disarray from packing up cartons
of boxes and equipment. The workers have taken a break
from the packing as they watch the t.v. broadcast. The
station manager, MURRAY enters anxiously.
MURRAY
People! We have to be completely
relocated to the New Jersey station
before our 5:30 broadcast.
(reading from list)
Okay, Caiman, Devoe and Animal, you're
on the helicopter. Everyone else we'll
see you in Jersey.
ANIMAL
Gotta go, honey. You guys gonna be all
right?
LUCY
Audrey's going to stay with us
tonight.
ANIMAL
Great. See ya then.
Animal hurries out after him. Audrey and Lucy go back to
packing. Audrey looks up at the t.v. just as they replay
the footage of Nick and Elsie being led into the command
tent.
FIELD REPORTER
(filtered)
...military and government health
officials set up a command post on the
New Jersey coast this afternoon...
Surprised at first, Audrey suddenly becomes very
excited. She SEES Caiman exiting the studio at the end
of the hall. She rushes over to him.
AUDREY
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
CAIMAN
What?
AUDREY
I've got something on this. I know a
guy on the inside with the
military...
CAIMAN
Not now. You got my bag?
Audrey holds up his bag as they walk towards the
elevator.
AUDREY
You don't understand, I can get us
information...
CAIMAN
Listen, this is the time when the big
boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
With that, Caiman walks into the elevator. Pissed,
Audrey just stares at him.
CAIMAN
The bag?
Audrey THROWS the bag at him, knocking him backwards as
the elevator doors close. Lucy walks over.
LUCY
Come on, Girl, we've gotta go!
43
45
Caiman stares earnestly at his video camera.
CAIMAN
...Police and the National Guard have
quarantined off over twenty square
city blocks...
46
47
Quick cuts of people who where interviewed earlier.
WOMAN
I don't understand why we have to
leave our homes. It's over already,
isn't it?
MAN
What are we running from? A big
lizard? I've got cockroaches in my
building that could kick the crap out
of it.
48
51
Way beyond capacity, the flooded subway platform bursts
with people pushing and shoving to get into the trains.
Caught in the craziness we find Audrey and Lucy trying
desperately to get on board.
P.A.
Please don't push. People are getting
shoved down onto the tracks and the
trains can't leave...
The last to fit inside, Lucy and Audrey cram in just as
the doors shut behind them. People left behind BANG on
the closed doors as the subway pulls out.
52
53
With his close aides in tow, the Mayor stares at the
melee below.
MAYOR
If we're wrong on this evacuation
they'll string me up from the Liberty
torch.
54
55
Just as the helicopter is landing, the crowd moves
toward the chopper.
MAYOR
Who the hell are they?
AIDE
It's a contingent of building owners
and community business
representatives.
MAYOR
I don't have time for this nonsense.
AIDE
Most of them are campaign
contributors.
Well that's a different story.
56
57
Smashed together like sardines, Audrey plays with
Caiman's press pass, trying to put her photo over his.
LUCY
What the hell are you doing?
AUDREY
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
LUCY
Your old sweetheart?
AUDREY
Yeah, well he just turned up in New
Jersey at the military command post.
Somehow all this is related to what
happened down in Panama. There's a
story here. I know it. You got any
tape or glue?
LUCY
I left my forgery kit back at the
office.
Audrey looks over at a young ten year old boy holding
his backpack, a RULER sticking out of the back.
AUDREY
Hey, do you have any glue in your
bag?
KID
What's it to you?
AUDREY
Can I use some?
KID
What do I get?
AUDREY
The warm feeling of helping your
fellow man.
KID
Five bucks.
AUDREY
You're kidding, right?
The Kid simply puts his hand out.
58
59
Filled with high tech monitoring equipment, Raymond and
his men are listening in to a conversation. The man with
junk food hands it to Raymond.
RAYMOND
Merci.
He opens the bag and takes out a croissant. He bites
into it and grimaces. To wash away the taste, he drinks
from the coffee. It's worse than the croissant.
RAYMOND
You call this coffee?
MAN
(French accent)
I call this America.
The man takes a seat near Raymond as Raymond turns up
the volume on his headset.
MAYOR (O.S.)
(mid argument)
You're telling me that in an election
month I've evacuated the entire city
for nothing?
60
60
From behind the Mayor's head we SEE the monitoring
device attracted to his collar. As he speaks we WIDEN TO
REVEAL...
MAYOR
Do you realize what this evacuation
will cost the people of this city!?
Representatives of all branches of the military,
National Guard and the Mayor's office are here. The room
overflows with people. Nick, Elsie and the scientist
stand near the back of the tent.
ADMIRAL PHELPS
We're been monitoring the waters
around the island. As far as we can
tell it hasn't left the area.
MAYOR
But you don't know for sure.
MAJOR HICKS
We think there's a strong reason to
believe it may be hiding inside one of
the buildings within the sequestered
area.
MAYOR
But you don't know for sure!
Just then Sergeant O'Neal enters hurriedly. He wants to
speak but waits for the opportunity.
MAJOR
(controlling his temper)
Mr. Mayor, if he's not in one of those
buildings then we give the all clear.
But not until we've checked each
building!
SERGEANT O'NEAL
Sir, that may be more difficult than
we originally projected.
MAJOR
More good news?!
SERGEANT O'NEAL
We've run into a problem.
CUT TO:
A SIGN READING: SUBWAY STATION: 23RD STREET - SUNSET
We CRANE DOWN to reveal several military sedans pulling
up into FLAT IRON SQUARE (where Broadway meets 5th).
Sergeant O'Neal leads the team out of the cars and down
a subway entrance.
61
61
Marching down the stairs, the team enters into the very
large subway station. For all we see it seems like a
normal subway station except for the fact that every one
of the team members look ASTONISHED.
SERGEANT O'NEAL
Lt. Anderson and his men found this
late this afternoon.
The camera makes a hundred and eighty degree turn as we
suddenly SEE what the team is staring at...
AN ENORMOUS HOLE
The four normal subway tunnels have been CARVED OUT
making one GIGANTIC TUNNEL. Debris and crumbled brick
are everywhere. Several SOLDIERS with flashlights
approach the hole.
Lt. Anderson moves over to the astonished group. Some of
the scientists fan out, examining the area.
LT. ANDERSON
We were checking the office building
above when we discovered the floor was
gone.
LOW ANGLE - REVEALING THE HOLE IN THE CEILING
We SEE that not only is the ceiling gone but the
building above is hollowed and torn to shreds. Another
hole in the building leads to the street.
LT. ANDERSON
When we learned he could burrow his
way through the tunnels we realized he
could be out of the quarantined zone.
MAJOR HICKS
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the
island?
LT. ANDERSON
Only five, Sir. We've checked them
all. He hasn't used any of them.
MAJOR HICKS
Have them sealed off.
LT. ANDERSON
And how should we do that, Sir?
MAJOR HICKS
Fill them with cement, brick them up,
put land mines in them, bombs, I don't
know, just make sure that goddamned
thing doesn't leave the island!
ANGLE - INSIDE DARKENED TUNNEL
As the SOLDIERS slowly move down deeper into the
tunnels, their flashlight beams scan the area. Could
they stumble onto something dangerous?
ANGLE - NICK
as he approaches Major Hicks and Sergeant O'Neal.
NICK
You know, he's not an enemy trying to
evade you. He's just an animal.
MAJOR HICKS
What are you suggesting?
NICK
When I needed to catch earthworms, I
knew the best way to catch them was
not to chase them. I had to draw them
out.
ANGLE - SOLDIERS - DARKNESS
Still moving deeper into the tunnel we get the feeling
these soldiers may just waken a sleeping giant.
BACK TO TEAM
Nick moves to the edge of the platform, looking off into
the dark tunnel.
NICK
All we need to do is find out what it
wants, what it needs, and he'll come
to us.
ANGLE - SOLDIERS - DARKNESS
The lead Soldier SEES something. Cautiously he moves
forward thinking he's onto something. We HEAR something
MOVING in the darkness.
We FOLLOW his beam as the noise grows clearer. The beam
falls onto something on the floor...
A FISH
Flopping on the ground is a large FISH. As the beam
moves farther along we see two, no, three fish ahead.

Major Hicks sits by a bank of communications
technicians.
MAJOR HICKS
Where are they now?
RADIO TECHNICIAN
Delta niner, what is convoy position?
65
67
A buzz of activity. Military Officials and personnel.
The Mayor enters and joins his aides in the back of the
room.
MAYOR
(whispering to Aide)
They find anything yet?
The Aide shakes his head. Monitors come to life with a
live video feed-from several cameras we saw mounted.
A CABLE REPAIRMAN - MAGIC HOUR
In blue overalls, the REPAIRMAN walks up to a large
satellite dish. We WIDEN to REVEAL the dish is parked
next to the Command Tent. He kneels down next to some
cables leading away from the dish toward the Command
Tent.
68

Suddenly all the screens FUZZ OUT. Just as quickly the
monitors return to normal. No one seems to notice.
69
70
We SEE Raymond and his men have turned this dingy Motel
room into a command central of their own. Raymond is
putting sugar into his coffee when a bank of monitors
turn on. They are seeing THE SAME VIDEO FEED as the
Mayor. Pleased, he takes a sip. It's awful.
RAYMOND
You said this was French Roast!
His aid turns, holding a package labeled FRENCH ROAST.
RAYMOND
(defeated)
More cream.
His associate hands him some milk. He adds it to the
coffee. No use, it still sucks. On the monitors we SEE
the DUMP TRUCKS entering Flat Iron Square.
71
72
On the monitors they watch in astonishment as the fish
get dumped into a large pile in the center of Flat Iron
Square.
AIDE
Tres bizarre.
RAYMOND
No.
(leaning forward)
Very clever.

With a loud WHINE we HEAR the vents shutting down. The
large whirling FAN BLADES slow to a stop.

Major Hicks watches the monitors as Godzilla approaches
the fish.
MAJOR HICKS
Commence phase one. Let's gas it!
80
81
On the monitors we SEE the melee.
MAJOR HICKS
Fire at will!
82

We SEE the Flat Iron Building crumbling on one of the
monitors near Major Hicks. In the rear of the room the
Mayor looks sick.
86

The monitors only show static or devastation.
MAJOR HICKS

O'Neal, what the hell is going on
there!?

The Mayor stands over a Radio technician.
HELICOPTER PILOT (O.S.)

MAJOR HICKS
Then FIRE damn it!

The static increases over the radio.
HELICOPTER PILOT

That is a negative impact.
The Mayor, in the back of the room stands, furious.
MAYOR
Negative impact!?! It's the goddamned
Chrysler building, that's what it is!
His aides try to calm him.
MAJOR HICKS
(into radio)
You said he was locked on!
96

Major Hicks is on his feet, steaming mad.
MAJOR HICKS

Echo four, where is he!?
99

The Major's aide try to hold him back as the Mayor is
charging at Major Hicks.
MAYOR
What the hell is the matter with you
people?! You caused more damage than
that thing did!
101
103
A network news ANCHOR speaks directly at us as a video
of the Chrysler building getting destroyed plays behind
him.
ANCHOR
While it may have looked like Beirut,
it was in fact, Manhattan where man
and nature have collided with brute
force.
The video switches to the White House where we SEE the
President signing a bill.
ANCHOR
The President today declared a state
of emergency and has issued disaster
relief funds to New York City.
WIDEN TO
REVEAL:
104

We SEE that we've been watching the video on one of MANY
video monitors showing all the news broadcasts. As an
assistant moves away from the monitors we FOLLOW him out
of the truck.
105
106
Nick observes the chaos. Through the crowd he SEES a
Pharmacy, a neon sign reading: Never Closes. He looks
back down at the blood sample he holds in his lap and
gets an idea.
NICK
(to the driver)
It's okay, I'll get out here.
He opens the car door and pushes his way through the
crowds who are less interested in him as they are the
military officials.
NICK'S P.O.V. - MEDIA CIRCUS - CROWDS - NIGHT
Pushing his way through, Nick SEES what a circus this
has become; t.v. news camera crews, journalists,
concerned citizens, worried mothers, and of course,
merchandising...
STREET STANDS
Nick passes several vendors selling dinosaur toys,
copies of Animal's now famous news video clip and, of
course, tee shirts with still images from that same
clip.
ANGLE - AUDREY
Through the dense crowd, Audrey SEES Nick in the
distance. Excited she starts to push her way through.
107
107
Ringing the night bell, Nick calls for the PHARMACIST
who enters, weary eyed.
PHARMACIST
Can I help you, young man?
NICK
Do you have any home pregnancy tests?
Especially ones that test for
catastrophic hormones or clomiphene
citrate.
PHARMACIST
This is all we've got.
The Pharmacist puts onto the counter six different off
the shelf home pregnancy tests.
NICK
I'll take them all.
AUDREY (O.S.)
You must have quite some harem.
Nick spins to find Audrey standing right behind him.
Embarrassed, Nick awkwardly pays for the tests.
NICK
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You
look, wow, uh, how've you been?
AUDREY
It's good to see you, Nick.
The Pharmacist puts out Nick's change. He scoops it out
and we FOLLOW them as they exit together.
NICK
So you made it.
AUDREY
What?
He points to her fake press ID she's still wearing.
NICK
You're a reporter. That's what you
always wanted to be, right? I'm happy
for you. Really, I am.
AUDREY
Yeah, well...
108
109
Nick has set up a mini-lab in his private, small, tent.
The home pregnancy tests have been ripped apart. Nick
mixes some of the contents together.
AUDREY
I still can't believe it. How does a
guy go from an anti-nuke activists to
working for the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission?
NICK
When you and I use to attend rallies
in college, we helped to create
awareness. But from the inside now I
can actually effect change.
(pointedly)
I never lost my idealism.
AUDREY
And exactly what changes are you
trying to effect?
NICK
I have this theory that we're
inadvertently creating new species as
a direct result of what we've done to
nature.
AUDREY
And you think this creature is one of
them?
NICK
Yes. The first of its kind. I found
this blood sample earlier this
evening...
AUDREY
Blood sample? How close did you get to
that thing?
NICK
I got pretty close.
AUDREY
What else do you know about it?
Nick finishes his concoction, adding the blood sample
into it He takes the piece of litmus paper from one of
the home test boxes and dips it in.
NICK
Well, we know he eats fish, he's of
reptile genus, he's a burrower, he's
amphibious and...
Nick points out the litmus paper. It turns RED.
NICK
...he's pregnant.
AUDREY
Are you sure?
Nick gets up and starts to gather his materials.
NICK
(thrilled)
Well, obviously these tests weren't
designed for this but fundamentally
they're looking for the same hormonal
patterns that would indicate
pregnancy.
AUDREY
I don't get it. If it's the first of
its kind, how can it be pregnant?
Excitedly Nick begins to pace.
NICK
The ultimate expression of evolution,
it reproduces asexually. Think about
it, all kinds of creatures have been
known to travel great distances for
reproduction. That's why he came to
New York. Like every species of
insufficient progenitors, he's
nesting!
AUDREY
Nesting?
NICK
Yes. Do you realize that a creature
like this could lay as many as a dozen
eggs at a time!
Nick moves to the front exit of the tent.
NICK
Forgive me but I've got to get this
into the lab, to confirm all this.
I'll be right back.
Nick rushes from the tent. Alone, Audrey can't help but
poke around a bit. She opens one of his CASES. Taped to
the roof of the case she SEES...
INSERT PHOTOS - NICK AND AUDREY
Happy times long ago. They're both young and in love.
Audrey is surprised Nick still keeps them. She's
touched.
Feeling guilty she quickly closes the case and sits back
down. As she does she notices a video tape labeled
FIRST SIGHTING. Unable to resist, she puts it in and
turns on the t.v. The shot of the Japanese Cook
appears.
COOK
(filtered through t.v.)
...Gojira...Gojira...
She hits the fast forward tape and SEES, the enormous
footprints in Panama. She fast forwards again and sees
the beached cargo ship in Jamaica.
Audrey is torn. She makes a decision, pops the tape back
out, puts in her purse and takes off out the back of the
tent. Moments later, Nick returns from the front.
NICK
Audrey? Audrey?
A flash of lighting and thunder accents Nick's
confusion.

We pull back to reveal Audrey, Animal and an editor,
ED, watching the piece.
ED
That's it. You owe me a breakfast.
AUDREY
(turning to Animal)
So, what do you think?
ANIMAL
It's good. It's a real good piece. But
how'd you get a hold of this
material?
Audrey covers her own mixed emotions.
AUDREY
Like you said, "Good guys finish
last."
She snatches the tape and she takes off running.
Concerned and worried, Animal watches her leave.

One of Raymond's men observes with binoculars from the
window. Tucking his napkin into his lapel, Raymond eats

Raymond.
JEAN-CLAUDE
Taisez-Vous.
He turns on the room speaker.

Nick is moving to take his seat next to Elise at this
very crowded conference. The big wigs are here and the
room is packed. Major Hicks walks to a large map of
Manhattan.
MAJOR HICKS
General Anderson, the problem was the
terrain. If we lure him out into a
more open area such as this portion of
Central Park...
(points to the map)
We should be able to take him down.
MAYOR
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
MAJOR HICKS
That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I
mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
All eyes turn towards Nick who's still arranging his
papers. Nervously Nick addresses the crowd.
NICK
Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was
injured and bled.
MAJOR HICKS
You see, all we need to do is get a
better shot at it with weapons that
don't rely on heat seeking...
NICK
Um, excuse me, sir, but the
situation's more complicated than
that. The blood I recovered revealed
that the creature is either about to
lay eggs or already has.
GOVERNOR
Are you trying to tell us there's
another one of those things out
there?
NICK
I don't believe so.
MAYOR
Then how can it be pregnant? What is
this, the "virgin lizard?"
There's a smattering of laughter in the room.
NICK
No, it reproduces asexually. That's
why we must find the nest. If we
don't, dozens will be born, each one
capable of laying eggs of its own.
Very quickly we could be looking at an
enormous population.
MAJOR HICKS
So after we kill the creature we'll
begin a search for the nest.
NICK
It may be too late by then. These eggs
will hatch very quickly.
CLIVE
How could you possible know that?
NICK
The fish. The fish we found down in
the subway. He's not gathering all
that food for himself. He's preparing
to feed his young.
114

Raymond listens intently. He grabs a folder off the desk
and opens it. We SEE photos and documents of every
member of the team. He finds the photo of Nick and
examines it.
115

Audrey shakes off the rain and moves over to join Ed and
Animal at a booth.
ANIMAL
They just promo-ed your spot. It's
coming on right after this.
116

An AIDE comes in and whispers something into the
Governor's ear, who nods approval.
MAJOR HICKS
If Dr. Tatopoulos is right, we must
act quickly before this problem
escalates.
GENERAL ANDERSON
You want to divide our efforts based
solely on a wild theory?
MAJOR HICKS
He's come through for us before and if
he feels strongly...
GENERAL ANDERSON
Come through for you!? Major, your
campaign's a disaster. You weren't
even able to to prevent this thing
from coming to Manhattan.
GOVERNOR
Excuse me Gentlemen, but I think we
should see this.
The Aide moves over to a television and turns it on.
Just as the t.v. comes to life we SEE the old Japanese
Cook.
GENERAL ANDERSON
How the hell did this get out?
The image of the Cook saying, "Gojira" FREEZES and cuts
back to reveal Caiman doing his "stand-up."
CAIMAN

From an old Japanese sailor's song
called GODZILLA, a mythological sea
dragon who attacked sailors, to our
own modern day terror. Today in my
special report, who is this Godzilla,

GENERAL ANDERSON
You went to the press with this?
NICK
No, I didn't...I didn't talk with
anyone.
The military men are furious at the breach of security.
All eyes turn toward Nick.
GENERAL ANDERSON
They mentioned you by name!
NICK
Yes...but I...
MAJOR HICKS
You gave them the tape?
NICK
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh
my God, she took it.
Pissed, GENERAL ANDERSON walks up to Nick.
GENERAL ANDERSON
Pack your stuff. You're officially off
this project as of now.

NICK
Me too.
Nick hoists his bag and moves to leave.
NICK
Make sure they find that nest before

AUDREY'S P.O.V. - THROUGH GLASS - NICK
Lugging his bags out into the rain, Nick moves over to a
waiting cab.

Long waiting lines for people trying to leave town.
People sleeping on the floors. Chaos. One group gathered
around a television set.
T.V. NEWS BROADCAST - VIDEO

...every shelter in the tri-state area

over.
WAITER
Can I get you something?
Before Nick can answer...
RAYMOND
Pernot, no ice.
Taking a seat directly across from Nick, Raymond sits
down, sizing him up. Nick is confused.
NICK
Do I know you?
RAYMOND
We've met before.
NICK

Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
Raymond pulls out his badge and lays it on the table in
front of Nick.
RAYMOND

Agent Phillip Raymond.
NICK
Sounds like a big company.
RAYMOND
It's the French Secret Service.
NICK
Oh.
RAYMOND
We have learned that your American
friends have decided not to look for
the creature's nest.
NICK
(alarmed)
Are you sure? How do you know?
RAYMOND
We know.
NICK
Why are you telling this to me?
RAYMOND
I need you to trust me.
NICK
Why do you need that?
RAYMOND
I need your trust if you're to help me
find the nest.
NICK
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
RAYMOND
We, have already taken care of them.
Nick realizes Raymond is serious. The waiter hands
Raymond his drink. Raymond toasts Nick.

Raymond enters with Nick. The room is filled with

vehicles. We notice that more of Raymond's support team
are here.
NICK
How did you get all of this stuff into
the country?
RAYMOND
This is America. There is nothing you
can not buy.
Raymond gives Nick a tour.
NICK
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you
guys working with the US military?
RAYMOND
I am not permitted to speak of such
things.
Nick stops and confronts Raymond.
NICK
You said you wanted my trust, then I
need yours.
Raymond considers this. Finally...
RAYMOND
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can
you understand that?
NICK
Sure.
RAYMOND
It is my job to protect my country.
Sometimes I must even protect it from
itself. From mistakes we have made.
Mistakes that we do not want the world
to know about.
NICK
Your talking about the nuclear testing
in the Pacific.
RAYMOND
Yes. This testing done by my country
left a terrible mess. We are here to
clean it up.
129

Nick walks past the myriad of warfare tools. Jean-Claude
turns from the radios.
JEAN-CLAUDE
They will set the trap at thirty
minutes to ten.
RAYMOND
That is when we will go in.
Raymond leads Nick over to a large map.
RAYMOND
We know how to get into the city. We
just do not know where to start
looking.
Nick moves closer to the map, putting his finger on the
Flat Iron square subway station.
NICK
Here. 23rd street subway station.
Where we first found the fish. With a
little luck, this will lead us right
to it.
RAYMOND

Filled with people, Lucy is serving coffee. She smiles
at Animal as he enters.
ANIMAL
Who the hell are all these people?
LUCY
What? I just couldn't just let them

ANIMAL
Where's Audrey?
LUCY
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out

ANIMAL
What?
LUCY
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff
you filled her head with.
ANIMAL

LUCY
Go in there. Talk to her.
Lucy pushes Animal towards the back bedroom.

Audrey has been crying. Crumpled Kleenex wads piled up
all around her. A television plays a news broadcast,
boasting the headline: THEY CALL HIM GODZILLA! On the
t.v. we SEE a news conference with General Anderson
addressing some reporters.
REPORTERS
(simultaneously)
Can you comment on the nest? How many
more of these things will there be?
GENERAL ANDERSON
(filtered)
That's why I'm holding this
conference. To try and avoid a
needless panic.
Animal enters and watches from the back of the room.
GENERAL ANDERSON
Contrary to some frivolous reports, we
have no information to lead us to
believe that there are any eggs of the
creature in the city.
AUDREY
Stupid idiots!
ANIMAL
You okay?
AUDREY
It's all my fault. What have I done,
Animal? What have I become? Look at
me. This isn't me. I don't do things
like this.
ANIMAL
You made a mistake.
Suddenly someone exits the bathroom and crosses out of
the room. Animal looks at the stranger as he leaves.
AUDREY
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only
man who ever really cared about me.
ANIMAL
Didn't you tell me he left for the
airport?
AUDREY
Yeah. Why are you asking?
ANIMAL
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of
guys who want to sneak into the city
tonight.
Audrey tries to make sense of this. Suddenly she
realizes.
AUDREY
My God. He's going after the nest.
ANIMAL
Perfect! You wanted a story, well,
baby, you got one.
Excitedly Animal goes to the closet and retrieves a big
overcoat.
AUDREY
Animal, I can't.
ANIMAL
Look, you want to make it up to your
friend? Well if he's right, this is
your chance.
He starts going through his drawers, taking out battery
packs, tapes, etc, and putting it in his pockets.
AUDREY
(misgivings)
I don't know. I've already made such a
mess of things...
Animal walks up to the door, ready to exit.
ANIMAL
(smiling)
Audrey, I'm going after them. You can
come with me or not.
Conflicted, Audrey is not sure what to do. Animal opens
the bedroom window and begins to climb out.
AUDREY
What are you doing?
ANIMAL
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.

Nick marches out of a changing room dressed in a
military uniform. As he moves into the room we SEE all
of Raymond's men dressed similarly.
As they climb into their vehicles, Raymond hands each a
stick of chewing gum. Nick gets in the passenger seat of
one of the vehicles, Raymond climbs in behind the
wheel.
NICK
What's with the chewing gum?
RAYMOND
Makes us look more American.
Nick looks over at the faux Americans. It's a tough
sell, gum or not.
NICK
Just let me do all the talking.
With that the vehicles pull out of the warehouse and out
into the rainy night.

The door creeps open. Animal leans out to find the
tunnel deserted. He and Audrey step out and into the
tunnel. We FOLLOW them as they are headed for the exit
of the tunnel into Manhattan.

Raymond and Nick drive through Central Park. We can SEE
dozens of military people and vehicles in a large
meadow.
139

The crisscrossing beams from the assault team's
flashlights nearly blind us as Nick leads the team
cautiously into the depth of this tunnel. Periodic fish
are found along the way. Suddenly the faint HUMMING
sound in the tunnel STOPS.
Everyone freezes as the wind shifts direction. A
familiar SMELL passes over them as they sniff the air.
NICK
They've turned off the ventilation
system. They're calling him to
dinner.
RAYMOND
Let's hope we are not the hors
d'oeuvres.
Nervously they continue onward.

Audrey and Animal, camera in hand shooting everything,
climb down into the station. Animal rushes to the end of
the platform and searches down into the tunnels.
VIDEO P.O.V. - DARK TUNNEL - DISTANT LIGHTS
Through the camera we SEE the lights in the distance of

They're down there. Let's go.
Animal jumps off the platform, down onto what's left of
the tracks. Audrey squeamishly follows.
143

Nick kneels down to inspect some debris. An old
SCREECHING SOUND is heard in the distance. Suddenly the
ground begins to quake. Dust falling. The SCREECHING
gets louder and louder.
Raymond moves up to Nick and points ahead. Nick nods in
nervous agreement. Just as they move towards the sounds
the ENTIRE WALL OF THE TUNNEL COLLAPSES next to them.
Bursting through the tunnel wall GODZILLA appears. His
enormous claws burrowing, he makes his way through and
into the tunnel. Quickly he moves past the team.
The team DIVES into a cross tunnel just as the colossal
beast BLASTS past them, barely missing them.
144
144
Audrey and Animal have just gotten into the tunnel
entrance. The entire place is shaking. Audrey is in a
panic.
AUDREY
Animal, let's get out of here.
But Animal hoists his camera and starts filming as
SOMETHING is moving TOWARDS them. Audrey is tugging at
him as the shaking gets more violent. With all her
strength, she finally gets Animal to start moving
backwards.
Just as they're out of the tunnel, the CREATURE BLASTS
outward. Audrey and Animal DIVE into the maintenance
ducks along side the tracks to avoid collision.
ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL
Animal is shielding Audrey with his body. She looks up
just in time to SEE Godzilla CRAWLING UP and out through
the ceiling. An amazing site.
AUDREY
Shoot! Shoot it!
Animal grabs his camera and gets the last moment of it
disappearing from view. Once gone, they both break into
enormous sighs of relief and nervous laughter.
145

Recovering, Raymond and the team walk back into the main
tunnel. They near the hole Godzilla just created,
examining it. Nick climbs into the hole.
NICK
I guess we go this way.
Raymond and his men follow.

SERGEANT O'NEAL
(into radio)
Any sign of it?

150
Major Hicks stands near a computerized schematic of
Manhattan. A large RED FLASHING BLIP nears Central
Park.
151
152
Nick leads the team through the cross town tunnel
created by Godzilla. Climbing over the debris, they make
their way to another opening. We FOLLOW them as they
clamber through the hole and into...
153
153
The largest subway/rail station in New York. Godzilla
has torn it to shreds. We get the feeling this is where
Godzilla has spent most of his time. Scattered fish
abound.
High above, there is a immense black hole in the tall
ceiling. Wherever it leads to is very dark. Nick and
Raymond stare at the hole together.
RAYMOND
What is up there?
154
156
The RED BLIP suddenly begins to move away from the
park.
MAJOR HICKS
(into radio)
Damn it! Fire! Shoot it before it gets
away!
157
158
Furious, Major Hicks throws his headset against the
console violently. ADMIRAL JOHNSTON leans down into
frame.
ADMIRAL JOHNSTON
Don't worry. The Navy has a little
something there waiting for him.
THREE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES
In the murky waters of the Hudson river.
159
159
The alarm KLAXONS are RINGING OUT as everyone rushes to
battle stations. The CAPTAIN moves over to a sonar
screen; a large MASS nearby blips on the screen.
CAPTAIN
(into radio)
We've got him on sonar. Arizona
closing in.
160
160
Different monitors have put up a three dimensional
schematic of the Hudson river. We SEE outlines of the
three nuclear subs approaching their target.
RADIO VOICES
(filtered)
...Indiana, closing in...Calvin
Coolidge, closing in...

161
The doors are pried open. It's very dark in here, only
the assault team's flashlights illuminate. As they enter
the lobby, the team splits up into different search
groups.
Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude move down the large front
lobby and turn down one of the many hallways surrounding
the main auditorium.
ANGLE - HALLWAY - ENTRY LEVEL - CONTINUOUS
Cautiously they move towards us. In the distance we see
the rest of the team moving the other direction. Raymond
and Nick arrive at a door leading to the main
auditorium. Nick is about to push the door open when
Raymond stops him.
RAYMOND
Jean-Claude.
On command, Jean-Claude snaps together his automatic
rifle as Raymond pulls out his semi-automatic pistol. He
nods "okay" to Nick who slowly opens the door.
As the door opens a small pile of FISH tumbles down over
their feet. They step over the fish and enter.
162
162
Total darkness. Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude cautiously
step over the fish inside. Only their flashlight beams
can be seen.
NICK'S P.O.V. - TRASHED AUDITORIUM
His beam cruises over the area nearby. It's been gutted.
Fish lay strewed on the floor everywhere. Suddenly Nick
spots a strange cluster of OBJECTS. He moves closer.
Raymond follows. With their combined light we can
SEE...
THREE ENORMOUS EGGS
A pile of reptile eggs nearly twice as tall as they are.
Raymond walks behind the egg, illuminating it from the
other side, making it partially translucent. We can SEE
THE EMBRYO inside the egg and IT'S MOVING!
NICK
Three eggs. I thought there would be
more.
RAYMOND
You were right.
Slowly Nick turns and SEES what Jean-Claude is staring
at open jawed...
DOZENS OF EGGS
Together their beams of light scan across the main
auditorium floor surrounding the gaping hole to discover
DOZENS OF EGGS piled in clumps everywhere.
NICK
That can't be. That's got to be over
twenty eggs.
163
163
Another of Raymond's men (R-MAN #2) has found a
switchboard, he examines the switches.
164
164
Animal and Audrey are wandering through the debris.
AUDREY
Okay, where'd they go from here?
165
165
R-MAN #2 locates the switch he's looking for and hits
it.
166
166
Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude are stunned as the work
lights suddenly TURN ON illuminating the room,
revealing...
HUNDREDS OF EGGS
All over the main auditorium floor. A stunning tableau.
Nick is speechless. Raymond turns to him.
RAYMOND
Start counting.
167
167
The light filters down from the gaping hole in the
ceiling.
ANIMAL
They must have climbed all the way up
into there.
Together they notice some large metal piping that has
fallen from the auditorium. They move over to it and
begin to climb.
168
169
We follow a runner who hands a report to the Admiral who
is conferring with the General and Major Hicks by the
schematic. The Admiral reads the report.
ADMIRAL JOHNSTON
They've surrounded the target just at
the mouth of the Hudson river.
170
171
The lights dim as they prepare for battle.
CAPTAIN
Are we locked on?
ENSIGN
Locked on, Captain.
CAPTAIN
Fire.
172
173
The Calvin's CAPTAIN rushes over to the sonar screens.
ENSIGN #2
He's shifted course. He's heading
right at us!
CALVIN'S CAPTAIN
Full stern!
174
176
The computerized representation of the Calvin Coolidge
VANISHES off the monitor.
RADIO OPERATOR
We've lost the Coolidge, Sir.
The Admiral burns.
177
177
The BLIP representing Godzilla turns.
ENSIGN
He's shifted course, Sir. He's heading
back towards Manhattan.
CAPTAIN
Full ahead. Close in and lock on.
178
179
ENSIGN
Locked on, Sir.
CAPTAIN
Fire!
180
181
The Captain and his Ensign are at the Sonar. We TRACK
two torpedoes approaching target (Godzilla).
ENSIGN
Impact in eight seconds, seven,
six...
182

Huddled around the schematic and radio, they hear...
ENSIGN (O.S.)

...five, four, three...
183
185
The ENSIGN checks the SONAR.
ENSIGN
Direct hit!
The crew erupts in cheers.
186
186
They hear the cheering from the sub over the radio.
SOLDIER
They got 'em!
The Generals congratulate each other and Major Hicks.
187
188
Raymond and his men are laying out the plastic
explosives around the room by the clumps of eggs.
Jean-Claude walks up to Raymond.
JEAN-CLAUDE
We do not have enough explosives.
Raymond turns and sees Nick, across the room studying a
group of eggs. Raymond goes towards him.
ANGLE - AUDITORIUM FLOOR - HOLE - SAME
Crawling out from the hole in the center of the floor,
Animal and Audrey appear. They're stunned at what they
see. Quickly Animal hoists his camera and begins to film
as an amazed Audrey walks through.
ANGLE - NICK AND EGGS - MID-LEVEL DECK
Kneeling down along side the eggs, Nick examines them.
Raymond approaches.
RAYMOND
Nick, we have a problem.
Nick silences him with a gesture as he moves in to
listen to the egg. He leans his ear against the shell.
Suddenly we HEAR a loud CRACK. Nick jumps backwards.
The shell RUPTURES and an large FISSURE opens up across
the egg. As we hear other CRACKS O.S., Nick turns and
SEES more eggs beginning to open all around them.
ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL
Hidden in this forest of tall eggs, Animal leans in
close to one getting video footage of it cracking.
Audrey nervously watches. What she doesn't see, however,
is a BABYZILLA, fish hanging from its jaw, as it
approaches from behind.
ANGLE - NICK AND RAYMOND
Stunned, they can only stare as the BABYZILLA BREAKS
FREE of his shell and gives a mini version of the famous
WAIL.
RAYMOND
I think we should leave now.
NICK
Good idea.
The BABYZILLA kneels down and immediately starts
GOBBLING UP the dead fish laying nearby. Cautiously Nick
and Raymond slowly back away until they are a far enough
distance, they they break into a run and head for the
exit.
ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL
The Babyzilla continues to chomp on its fish as it nears
Audrey. Animal continues to shoot the cracking egg.
ANIMAL
(whispered)
One more second. This is fantastic.
Just then Animal turns to SEE the Babyzilla right behind
Audrey.
AUDREY
Don't you think we have enough?
ANIMAL
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Audrey turns to see what Animal is staring at. Her eyes
go WIDE as she backs up into Animal. Another BABYZILLA
appear on the other side of them.
ANIMAL
Just be calm. Don't startle them.
Animal leads Audrey backwards as they make their way
towards the large "team" entrance at the end of the
floor. The two Babyzillas swallow their fish and begin
to SNIFF the air.
Audrey moves up the isle. An egg CRACKS and an ARM
breaks out through a shell, GRABBING HER LEG. Audrey
FREAKS and frantically she KICKS herself free. They both
suddenly take off running.
189
189
Nick and Raymond race to the stairwell. Raymond pulls
out his radio.
RAYMOND
(into radio)
Everyone, outside! Now!
ANGLE - JEAN-CLAUDE - MID-LEVEL DECKS - ACROSS THE ROOM
Laying down the plastic explosives. Hearing the radio,
he drops what they're doing just as several eggs near
them begin to CRACK. Quickly he and his partner take off
running.
190
190
Two other men are still laying cables for the
explosives. One of them is kneeling in a pile of FISH
near the eggs.
R-MAN #2
Come on, let's go.
R-MAN #3
One moment. I've almost got this.
Just then a BABYZILLA pops up behind the eggs, a fish in
his mouth. He SWALLOWS the fish and begins SNIFFING THE
AIR. He turns and stares directly at the slowly
retreating R-MAN #3.
He smells his own hands and realizes he smells like
fish, quickly he turns and RUNS.
But Babyzilla is faster. He runs up from behind and
LEAPS onto R-MAN #3's back. R-MAN #2 begins to FIRE at
Babyzilla just as another one TACKLES HIM from the
side.
In moments, they are both devoured.
191
191
Audrey and Animal reach the entrance and race inside.
The main exit doors are locked from the outside. They
turn back just as...
THREE BABYZILLAS
appear in the team entrance doorway SNIFFING THE AIR.
Audrey SEES something, grabs Animal's wrist and pulls
him to one of the Locker room doors. It's open.
192
192
Through the door we SEE the Babyzilla approaching as
Audrey and Animal leap inside, slamming the door behind
them. There is a sudden THUD against the door.
Animal rushes over to a large LOCKER CABINET and, with
all his strength, PUSHES it over, blocking the door.
AUDREY
Great. Now what do we do?
193
193
Nick and Raymond run up to another open doorway and look
inside.
NICK'S P.O.V. - AUDITORIUM
Dozens and dozens of eggs HATCHING. BABYZILLAS
everywhere begin to awaken and immediately begin to
devour all the fish. A Babyzilla appears only feet away
and turns and stares directly at us.
Quickly Raymond slams the doors shut as they both
retreat back into the hallway. Raymond SMASHES the glass
covering of a nearby FIRE HOSE and raps it around the
door handles, locking it closed.
Suddenly a loud THUD as something begins to BANG against
the locked doorway.
RAYMOND
We've got to lock them inside while we
can.
Raymond tosses his cellular phone to Nick.
RAYMOND
Contact the military and get them to
send a bomber to blow up this building
before these things escape.
NICK
How do I do that?
RAYMOND
555-7600. Tell them it's a code
dragonfly. They should get you
through.
Amazed by Raymond, Nick just stares at him.
RAYMOND
What are you waiting for?
Nick snaps out of it and dials.
OPERATOR
(filtered)
...all circuits are busy right now.
Please hang up and try again...
194
195
The Mayor marches over to Major Hicks who is consulting
with the Generals.
MAYOR
Do you have any idea what's going on
out there? The phones are ringing off
the hook with people screaming to be
let back into the city.
MAJOR HICKS
We're sending divers into the river
now to retrieve the body.
MAYOR
That thing's dead. What the hell are
we waiting for?
Just then Elise rushes over to the Major.
ELSIE
Major, if Nick is right, this could be
our last chance to do something about
it. We have to search for the nest,
now.
Major Hicks is torn. Finally he nods in agreement,
turning to another officer.
MAJOR HICKS
Organize a search party. I want a
complete sweep of the entire city and
subway system.
MAYOR
You don't have the authority to do
that.
The Major turns and cooly approaches the Mayor.
MAJOR HICKS
Try and stop me.
Major Hicks smiles at the Mayor who exits, petulantly.
196
196
NIGHT
We SEE dozens and dozens of Babyzillas fighting with
each other over the last of the fish. Suddenly this
image is SLAMMED SHUT as doors are closed and a FIRE
HOSE is rapped around door handles. We widen to
reveal...
Raymond fastening the hose around the door. Secured,
Raymond takes off running.
197
197
Nick is on the pay phone frantically dialing as Raymond
comes up. We hear a BUSY signal from the phone. Nick
dials again.
RAYMOND
What'd they say?
NICK
I can't get through. I don't know
what's wrong.
OPERATOR
(filtered)
...all circuits are busy right now...
Jean-Clude and his partner arrive.
JEAN-CLAUDE
We've secured the doors on both
levels.
RAYMOND
Where's Luc and Pierre?
JEAN-CLAUDE
They didn't make it.
RAYMOND
(quickly recovering)
Nick, my men and I will hold them
here. You will have to go and get
help!
Nick nods in agreement and takes off down stairs. The
rest of the team SNAP TOGETHER their automatic rifles
and prepare for a fight.
198
198
Animal and Audrey are checking out every corner of the
room.
ANIMAL
There's got to be another way out of
here.
Audrey climbs up onto a table and yanks out a grate
covering the air vent.
AUDREY
Think we can fit up in there?
ANIMAL
Only one way to find out.
He rushes over to her and helps her climb up inside.
199
199
Jean-Claude sends Luc up ahead as they guard the
doorways. A loud THUMP is heard on the door they are
guarding. Each turns their weapon towards the doors.
Suddenly a portion of WALL BETWEEN THEM COLLAPSES.
A DOZEN BABYZILLAS leaping through the plaster. As they
spill out into the hall, Jean-Claude attempts to open
FIRE. One of the Babyzilla's is HIT.
His brothers ATTACK. Luc from the other side tries to
lay down cover fire but he's overrun by the herd.
200
200
Nick comes racing down the stairs and into the hallway.
Just then, he passes a locked door, BANGING on the other
side.
Just up ahead he can SEE the main lobby. But before he
can get there, a LOUD CRASH is heard as the locked door
in front of him SMASHES TO BITS as...
DOZENS OF BABYZILLAS
Flood into the main lobby only a few yards ahead. Nick
slams on the breaks and quietly tries to back away. He
turns to run the other directions when...
MORE BABYZILLA
Come BURSTING THROUGH the locked door behind him. Pinned
down with no way out. Nick SEES the elevator nearby and
races over, slamming his hand against the button.
NICK
Come on, come on.
The Babyzillas by the front door spot Nick. A couple of
them start to SNIFF THE AIR and start to move towards
him. Behind, the Babyzilla also catch the scent and
turn.
NICK
This is not good.
Just then the elevator doors open, Nick LEAPS inside.
201
201
Nick frantically pushes the CLOSE DOOR button but it's
painfully slow to react.
NICK
I hate these things!
Just then the Babyzillas appear. They're just about to
move in when the doors finally CLOSE. Nick breaths a
sigh of relief just as a loud THUD is heard as one of
them SLAMS against the door. It's too late, the elevator
begins to rise.
202
202
Climbing upward, Animal reaches a plateau and crawls
into cross vent. He reaches back and grabs his camera.
Putting it down he turns back and helps Audrey up and
in.
ANIMAL
You okay?
Out of breath, she nods. Animal takes the lead again,
pushing his camera in front of him. He reaches another
vent that looks down. He's about to pull it free when
something catches his eye.
ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - THROUGH VENT - RAYMOND
Standing guard, automatic rife in hand, Raymond appears
with his back toward us. Animal lifts his camera to
shoot.
AUDREY
(whispered)
What? What is it?
Animal doesn't answer, he just shoots.
203
203
The elevator doors open and Raymond SWERVES his gun
around ready to shoot. Frightened, Nick throws his hands
in the air.
NICK
Hey, it's me!
204
204
Audrey has pushed her way up alongside of Animal to peer
down through the grating.
RAYMOND
What happened?
205
205
Nick keeps dialing the cell phone, still busy.
NICK
They're loose. They're allover the
main lobby. I couldn't get out.
Just then the vents above COLLAPSES and Animal and
Audrey come tumbling down. In a flash, Raymond has his
weapon trained on their heads.
RAYMOND
Who the hell are you?
NICK
It's okay. I know her.
Raymond turns his gun towards the fallen video camera
and FIRES, ripping the camera apart.
ANIMAL
Hey! What gives?
RAYMOND
No cameras.
Nick moves to Audrey's side, helping her up.
NICK
What are you doing here?
AUDREY
I thought you said there'd only be a
dozen eggs.
NICK
I was wrong.
Just then a LOUD THUMP is heard against the near locked
door. The THUMPING gets louder and heavier.
RAYMOND
Do you have a radio, a walkie-talkie?
Anything we can use to contact the
outside.
AUDREY
What about the phones?
NICK
Circuits are overloaded.
AUDREY
(gets an idea)
I know a way. I know how you can get
a message out of here.
The door BURSTS OPEN and TWENTY BABYZILLAS stampede into
the hallway. Audrey is fast on her feet.
AUDREY
This way.
She takes off running and they follow. The Babyzillas
give chase. Animal, hangs back and runs over to the
destroyed video camera and PULLS OUT THE TAPE. Just as
he does, the Babyzillas are nearly on top of him. He
dashes off.
ANGLE - END OF HALL - BACK DOOR
Audrey gets there first and opens the small doorway that
leads to a back stairwell, she ushers the rest inside.
She slams the door behind her as the Babyzillas appear
and begin to SNIFF the doorway.
206
206
They spill out into the hall and rush past all the
luxury boxes overlooking the auditorium.
AUDREY
Come on, the broadcast booth is right
over here.
NICK
How do you know?
AUDREY
Our network covers the Ranger games.
207
207
The Babyzillas are gathered by the doorway SNIFFING. One
of the more aggressive ones starts to CLAW at the door,
RIPPING into it. Another charges it, THUD.
208
208
They rush up to a door marked BROADCAST BOOTH. Audrey
tries the door, it's locked. Animal charges his shoulder
into it, but it doesn't give.
Raymond gently moves Animal out of the way and SHOOTS
the lock to pieces. He opens the door for everyone to
enter.
209
209
They rush into the empty broadcast booth. Animal turns
on the lights as Audrey goes over and boots the computer
terminal. Raymond moves some equipment against the door,
securing it closed.
AUDREY
The network is on an intranet. It's a
direct feed into our computer system.
NICK
Your station won't have any easier
time contacting the military than I
did.
That stumps her. Animal gets an idea.
ANIMAL
When you worked with them, did they
monitor the news broadcasts?
NICK
(getting the idea)
Yes, they did.
ANIMAL
We'll go live! We'll broadcast from
here. Hopefully they'll see it.
210
210
More of the creatures have gathered by the door. Two
more CHARGE and the door collapses. The Babyzillas rush
up the stairs.
211
211
Ed is watching the news feed. Caiman is on.
CAIMAN
(filtered)
...Yes, the threat is over but the
pain continues...
Suddenly Ed's computer begins to BEEP. Ed slides his
chair over and looks at his monitor. It reads NEW MAIL:
URGENT! He double clicks it and a letter pops up that
reads. Ed pick up transponder CFX 1 and watch the feed.
ED
(to himself)
There's no Ranger game on tonight.
Ed makes a couple of adjustments on his controls and
turns on a blank monitor. He SEES...
C.U. MONITOR - AUDREY
Racing in front of the camera we SEE Audrey in the
control booth.
AUDREY
...If you're seeing this, Ed, please
put us on Live! This is urgent! I know
this sounds crazy Ed but you have to
do it. Please, trust me.
ED
(incredulous)
I'm not putting you on live!
212
212
Nick turns on a small television and we still SEE Caiman
doing the news. Audrey turns to Animal.
AUDREY
He's not going to do it.
ANIMAL
Oh yes he will.
Animal turns the camera and points out the window at the
BABYZILLA'S below.
213
213
Ed's eyes nearly pop out of his head.
AUDREY
(filtered)
Ed, you see that? They'll be all over
the city if we don't stop them!
Ed rushes over to the console and goes to work.
214
214
The mode is festive.
The Generals are preparing to leave
as is Major Hicks. Sergeant O'Neal and some of his men
are watching the t.v. news.
CAIMAN
(filtered)
...as our fears have been allayed
thanks to the dedicated work of our
boys in uniform...
Everyone in the room begins to cheer. Suddenly Caiman's
image goes fuzzy. In a moment it's replaced by Audrey.
AUDREY
(filtered)
Are we on? Are we live?
215
215
Nick SEES Audrey on the t.v. and gives her the thumbs
up.
AUDREY
We're live from inside Madison Square
Garden where Dr. Niko Tatopoulos has
discovered the beasts lair. Doctor,
tell us what is happening here.
Animal swerves the camera over to Nick. Raymond stays
back behind the camera, watching.
NICK
We've discovered over two hundred eggs
which began hatching only moments ago.
216
216
The creatures come bursting out of the stairwell and
flood into the hall. Sniffing around they pick up the
scent and take off.
217
217
A Soldier tugs on Major Hicks shoulder, try to get his
attention.
MAJOR HICKS
What is it?
SOLDIER
You better see this.
The Major turns around just in time to SEE Nick on the
t.v.
NICK
If the military are listening, they
must immediately destroy this building
before they can escape.
AUDREY (O.S.)
Oh my God! They're coming!
The camera SWERVES to SEE through the luxury booths
across from them, the dozens of Babyzillas approaching.
218
218
The bedroom is packed with Lucy's "guests" as they watch
the t.v., SEEING the Babyzillas.
LUCY
Oh my God!
On the screen the image turns to Nick.
NICK
(filtered)
If those creatures escape and
multiply, in a very short time a new
species will emerge. One that could
replace us as the dominant species of
this planet.
219
219
Major Hicks is on the phone.
MAJOR HICKS
(into phone)
That's correct, I want you to blow up
Madison Square Garden. No I'm not
drunk.
(to O'Neal)
Contact the news station. Tell them
we're on the way.
220
220
Raymond spots a large spool of co-axle cable. Quickly he
ties it to the support beam.
AUDREY
Reporting live from Madison Square
Garden, this is Audrey Timmonds,
WNEW.
221
221
Everyone is breathless watching the news. Lucy beams.
LUCY
That's my girl.
222
222
Animal lowers the camera and everyone is silent.
NICK
Thanks, Audrey.
The computer beeps, Animal reads the message.
ANIMAL
The good news is they got the message.
The bad news is we've got five and a
half minutes to get out of the
building.
Suddenly the room ROCKS as the Babyzillas begin crashing
against the blocked door. Raymond jumps to his feet.
RAYMOND
Okay, party's over. Time to leave.
With that he SPRAYS bullets into the front glass window
SHATTERING IT. Glass rains down below. Raymond tosses
the spool of cable out the broken window.
RAYMOND
Anyone care to join me?
Animal dislodges one of the video cameras, hoists it on
his shoulder and moves over to join Raymond.
223
224
Repelling down from the broken window of the broadcast
booth, Animal and Raymond land on the upper-level
balcony. Raymond signals to the others to follow.
225
225
Audrey and Nick are nervous as they stare at the long
drop down. The door is begging to give way from the
repeated THUMPING. Suddenly Audrey leans over and kisses
Nick.
AUDREY
In case I can't later.
With that she JUMPS out, repelling downward. Nick is
stunned by the unexpected kiss. Suddenly the door GIVES
and the Babyzilla FLOOD into the room. Nick jumps.
226
226
Audrey hits the ground followed by Nick. Raymond leads
as they make their way out.
On the other end of the room some Babyzilla appear in a
doorway and watch our friends scurry away. The
Babyzillas take off in hot pursuit.
227
227
The F-18's fly in formation. Their leader carrying the
same bomb we saw loaded earlier.
228
228
Raymond, guns in each hand, comes rushing into the
hallway. He SEES a small group of Babyzillas down the
hall and gestures for the group to go the other way.
Raymond backs away, guns trained on the Babyzillas who
SNIFF the air and decide to pursue. Raymond turns and
runs.
ANGLE - FARTHER DOWN HALLWAY - AROUND THE CORNER - SAME
As they tear forward they nearly run smack into a heard
of several dozen Babyzillas who are tearing the
concession stands to ribbons looking for food.
Spotted, the Babyzillas LEAP forward after the team.
Raymond spots the escalators across the hall.
RAYMOND
The escalators, hurry!
229
230
The team races into the corridor. Animal reaches down
and hits the POWER button near the moving stairs. The
escalator comes to life.
The team runs down the "down" escalators as the
Babyzillas flood into the corridor. Some try to go down
the "up" escalator and fall all over themselves. Others
are spooked by the moving down escalator. Finally, the
brave ones begin to LEAP down the "down" escalator.
231
231
Racing out of the escalator corridor the team moves into
the main lobby and FREEZES. They are surrounded on all
sides by Babyzillas!
Like the scene in Hitcock's "The Birds" it is eerily
still as everyone freezes.
232
233
Through the windshield's Heads-Up-Display (HUD) we SEE a
target LOCKING ON, flashing.
PILOT
I'm locking on now.
234
234
As several SNIFF THE AIR, they begin to CLOSE IN. The
Babyzillas from the escalator corridor finally get to
the ground level and rush over from behind.
Raymond spots the large hanging CHANDELIERS in the front
lobby. He FIRES a short BURST, SLICING the cable
supporting the chandelier.
The chandelier DROPS and SHATTERS in the center of the
main lobby. The Babyzillas scatter, opening a pathway to
the front door.
RAYMOND
Go! Now!
Raymond PUSHES the team forward as he takes the rear
through the pathway which begins to close up as they
pass through.
The Babyzillas recover and begin to charge. As Raymond
passes some CANDY MACHINES, he grabs one and SMASHES IT
to the ground.
THOUSANDS OF GUM BALLS
Scatter all over the floor. As the Babyzillas run, they
begin to stumble allover each other, tripping on the
gum balls.
Animal is the first to reach the main door, he opens it
and Audrey and Nick are the first to exit. Raymond,
FIRING MADLY behind as he rushes for the door.
235
235
The locked FLASHES RED.
PILOT
Stallion 15, Fox 6.
236
240
In one deft move, Raymond draws a screwdriver out of his
belt, pops the ignition device off the steering column
and hot wires the car in under 15 seconds. It's
amazing.
As he does this the others pile into the car. Not even
completely all in, Raymond takes off as soon as the
engine turns over. Animal nearly falls out.
241
244
The rear window SHATTERS as falling bricks and debris
HIT THE CAR. Again, the Cab darts down a small side
street.
245
246
Animal fumbles with his camera trying to get it to power
up. The light goes ON and Animal quickly holsters it and
begins filming out the shattered back window.
AUDREY
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut
up Broadway.
ANIMAL
You're crazy, go to the east side and
take the park avenue to the JFK.
AUDREY
The JFK? In the rain!?
247
248
ANIMAL
What are you talking about? The east
side is always faster.
AUDREY
But we can get to the west side
faster.
Through the rear window we SEE Godzilla SNAPPING down
trying to take a bite. The cab, again, SWERVES wildly,
darting down a side street.
RAYMOND
Somebody make up your mind!
AUDREY & ANIMAL
Take central park!
249
251
Animal clears away the broken glass and leans out the
back window.
ANIMAL'S P.O.V. THROUGH WINDOW - GODZILLA
Gaining on them GODZILLA is in hot pursuit.
ANIMAL
Better step on it Frenchie!
252
253
Major Hicks moves over towards the radios.
MAJOR HICKS
Captain Rogers, do we still have those
F-18's in the air?
RODGERS
They're heading back to base now,
sir.
MAJOR HICKS
Turn 'em around.
254
255
Animal pulls himself back into his seat.
ANIMAL
I think we lost him.
256
259
Everyone is looking around for the creature.
RAYMOND
Anyone see him.
Suddenly from behind, Animal spots the creature several
blocks behind. Again, he lifts the camera.
ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - GODZILLA
Running full boar directly at them.
260
261
Raymond looks up, spots something.
RAYMOND'S P.O.V. - SIGN
Up ahead is a sign for the exit for the George
Washington Bridge. Raymond decides to take it.
262
263
Everyone ducks as the enormous JAWS OF THE CREATURE
CLAMP DOWN OVER THE CAB.
264
265
The sign supports will not hold much longer as it
crumbles just above the cab. The torn electric cables
DANGLING dangerous close to the cab.
Godzilla PUSHES his TONGUE towards the back of the car,
trying to draw it into his throat!
266
266
They're freaking out as the jaws are closing in on
them.
AUDREY
Gun it! Gun it!
RAYMOND
I'm trying!
C.U. CAB'S WHEELS
Spinning in vain against the gigantic tongue that pushes
against it, LIFTING the REAR of the vehicle.
267
268
From the cab we SEE the horizon LIFT as the road begins
to give way. The sign above CRUMBLING FURTHER.
Nick turns and SEES...
ELECTRIC CABLES - SPARKS
Sparking as they hit against the supports of the sign,
Nicks sees the cables dangling close to the cab. He
takes off his jacket, wraps it around his hand and opens
the cab door.
Grabbing the cable with his wrapped hand, he JAMS THE
CABLE DOWN into Godzilla's TONGUE. SPARKS FLY! Nick
leans back inside, slamming the door shut.
269
273
The HUD begins to FLASH, LOCKED ON!
PILOT #2
We are red and free. Stallion 10, Fox
2.
274
275
PILOT #3
Stallion 12, Fox 2.
ANGLE - F-18 SQUADRON
All at once they FIRE. Missiles heading right at
camera.
GODZILLA
opens his mighty jaw about to CLAMP DOWN on them.
The missiles CONNECT, SLAMMING INTO HIS CHEST,
EXPLODING. His torso, rips apart. He SCREAMS OUT. His
WAIL a painful death cry.
His foot STOMPS DOWN as he tries to retain balance. The
impact of the stomp acts like a shockwave that KNOCKS
the Cab into a SPIN.
SLAMMING into the guard rail, the cab bounces back into
the road and keeps going.
The injured Godzilla bites the bullet and continues
pursuing, his gait slowing. The cab is able to make some
distance.
ANGLE - F-18 SQUADRON
Again they FIRE. A group of missiles darting out.
GODZILLA
The missiles HIT, ripping into him. Again GODZILLA
SCREAMS out, his forward motion stopped.
276
278
The room is going berserk, everyone slapping hands. Lucy
turns and gives a "high-five" to everyone around her.
279
281
We FLOAT through the demolished station almost as though
we were a moving point of view. We travel thorough the
debris of the station into one of the tunnels.
We travel deeper and deeper into the distance. A shaft
of light up ahead. We move closer to it.
As we get nearer we realize it's one of Godzilla's
gigantic EGGS. WE move closer and closer to the solitary
egg. Just as we are about to collide with it. CRACK. IT
OPENS.
FADE OUT:
THE END
