CARNIVAL
NIGHT
We are staring down the midway of a deserted carnival. On either
side, stalls and rides beckon to pleasures that their locked
doors and tarpaulin-draped entrances deny. A light rain is
falling.
A huge wooden cut-out of a grinning clown dominates one stall
while the sign beneath him seems to state the ethos of the whole
place; LOTS 'O' FUN.
Another has a banner proclaiming FREAK SHOW, with the subheading
YOU'LL GASP AT THE GEEK!
On the horizon in the distance, almost denying the reality of
what we are seeing, tower vast cranes of unimaginable height
while beyond them impossibly huge oil-drums squat against the
moon-bright but cloudy sky.
Into shot, and running down the midway, comes a girl, TIFFANY.
TIFFANY is a girl in her early teens but looks younger
then her years due to her boyish figure and her slightly over-
delicate features.
For the last months, TIFFANY has been finding ways out of the
institute and making her way here, where she has one special
obsession, which we will soon see.
Following her into shot, but many yards behind, come two INTERNS
from the Institute. They contrast each other almost comically,
one being tall and plump while the other is smaller and thinner.
They're not quite the Stan and Ollie of the medical world but
with some serious rehearsal they could get there.
1st INTERN
Oh, Jesus -she's gonna make it.
Even as the first INTERN says this, we see TIFFANY make a sharp
left turn into a stall entrance.

HALL OF MIRRORS
ENTRANCE
NIGHT
A front view of the stall into which TIFFANY has run. The large
sign above it proclaims 'HALL OF MIRRORS' and a smaller sign
perched above a distorting mirror to one side of the entrance
says 'YOU'LL BE AMAZED'.
The two INTERNS enter at a run.

THE INSTITUTE
DAY
Basically an establishing shot to show it is the next morning but
it also serves to show MALAHIDE walking briskly to work. His suit
is tasteful and simple, but discreetly expensive-looking. He
walks with purpose and looks straight ahead, acknowledging only
with polite nods the respectful greetings of various JUNIOR
DOCTORS and NURSES he passes on his way. He enters the institute.
We should also see several patients being walked, or wheeled,
around by STAFF during this shot.
MALAHIDE
(off-camera)
And how are we feeling today...?

MALAHIDE's HOUSE
TWILIGHT
We TRACK in slowly towards a modern house that we will learn is
MALAHIDE'S, up the drive, towards the front door.

MALAHIDE'S HOUSE
NIGHT
MALAHIDE leaves through his front door and walks toward the
hospital.

MALAHIDE'S HOUSE
DAY
A simple shot tells us it is the next morning.
55
MALAHIDE'S HOUSE
DAY
MALAHIDE emerges from his front door. He is still in his black
suit and looks every inch the respectable professional. He looks
neither left nor right but moves straight off, a busy man with
things to do.
A few seconds after he has gone off-camera, KYLE and KIRSTY
emerge from around the corner of the house.
KYLE gestures to KIRSTY to follow him and leads her around to the
window he broke in through on the previous night.
64
HOSPITAL MAIN ENTRANCE
DAY
KIRSTY is kissing TIFFANY on the cheek. TIFFANY is dressed in
smart clothes and has a small traveling bag in her hand.
KIRSTY
So. What're you going to do?
Open up a games-shop somewhere?
Sell jigsaw puzzles?
TIFFANY gives a smile.
TIFFANY
Oh, yeah.
There is a slightly awkward pause.
KIRSTY
Well ... G'bye.
TIFFANY
It's been Hell.
They share a rueful knowing smile, like the smile of soldiers
back from a war who say goodbye on a dockside and know they will
never meet again.
TIFFANY turns and walks down the long path to the hospital gates.
KIRSTY watches her for a few moments and then turns and re-enters
the institute.
The camera TRACKS back to the window of the RECOVERY ROOM and we
watch through the window as KIRSTY enters the room. She bends to
kiss her father's cheek. LARRY slips an arm around her shoulders
and they embrace. The camera moves away again.
