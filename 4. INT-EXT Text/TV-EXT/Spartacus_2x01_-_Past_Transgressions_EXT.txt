  Not the spectacular arena from Season 1. No grand 
    appointments, no fluttering awnings to shield spectators 
  from the blazing sun. Much smaller and in disrepair.

  THE MOTLEY CROWD ROARS

  as two GLADIATORS trade deadly blows on the sand. It's a 
  dirty, brutal fight, lacking in refinement.

  REVEAL BATIATUS,

  frowning sourly, jammed in with the common dregs in the 
  stands. He's slightly younger at this point in time, his 
  hair not yet troubled by encroaching gray. With him are his 
  body slave ACCO (large brute), LUCRETIA (slightly younger, 
  natural hair), her body slave MELITTA (30-ish, curvy red- 
  haired beauty -- has a tattoo on the back of her shoulder 
  like Naevia did in season 1), and several ATTENDING SLAVES.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

  LUCRETIA

  jumps at a bone-jarring blow, laughs.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The fights are particularly 
                        entertaining this morning.

  A DIRTY FAN too close at hand erupts, spilling wine.

                                        DIRTY FAN
                        Fucking kill him!

                                        BATIATUS
                                (frowning, to 
                                  Lucretia)
                        I would find it more so viewed from 
                        the pulvinus.

  He glances up to the "pulvinus," which is little more than a 
  roped off area set up and apart from the unwashed masses. 
  VETTIUS, a holier-than-thou young lanista (early 20s) from 
  Nola, holds court with upper crust Romans. Two seats next to 
  him are conspicuously empty. Vettius spots Batiatus, tosses 
  him a smug grin. Batiatus smiles politely.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                                  through the smile)(
                        Fucking shit eater.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Let Vettius preen like a woman. You 
                        will school him in the ways of men, 
                        when Gannicus takes to the sands.

  Batiatus eyes the empty seats in the pulvinus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Absent Tullius and the Magistrate 
                      to bear witness, what's the fucking 
                        purpose? One man in today's games. 
                        One only, and the seats needing to 
                        impress stand empty as Vettius' 
                        head.

  SOLONIUS appears, pushing his way through the throngs with a 
  frown of distaste. Batiatus greets him warmly. At this point 
  in time they are as brothers.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Solonius! What news do you bring?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Tullius and the Magistrate were 
                        delayed with pressing business, but 
                        arrive shortly. As long as the 
                        current match --

  The crowd ROARS as one of the Gladiators goes down in a 
  spray of blood. Batiatus leaps to his feet.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Get up! Get up, you fucking...

  The Gladiator coughs a gout of blood, goes still. Batiatus 
  throws his hands up in frustration as the body is dragged 
  off. Vettius waves down for the next match to begin.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      He begins the match? Without proper 
                          introduction?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Proper? Vettius and the word are of 
                        distant relation.

  A grungy MURMILLO gladiator takes his position in the arena. 
  Helmet, heavy shield, sword.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I for one am grateful to be spared 
                        his oratory. The man's voice causes 
                        skull to ache.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gannicus takes position!

  GANNICUS appears -- and he is a golden fucking god. Late 
  20s, tall and muscular, with a perpetual twinkle in his eye 
  and a grin on his lips. Han Solo by way of Achilles. Two 
  swords, no helmet. A leather necklace graces his throat (the 
  exact same one Crixus wears in Season 1). Batiatus cheers.

                                        BATIATUS
                                to the crowd)(
                        Now there is a fucking gladiator!

  Gannicus takes his position opposite the Murmillo. He 
  assesses the man from head to toe. And laughs. Really? This 
  is who he's fighting? He glances up to the pulvinus, 
  awaiting the signal.

                                          VETTIUS
                        Begin!


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    7.
  CONTINUED:

  The Murmillo attacks. Gannicus counters -- and he ain't your 
  daddy's gladiator. He's a showboater, laughing and playing 
  to the crowd as he trades blows with the deadly serious 
  Murmillo. Solonius sighs in disapproval.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      Is your man ever of a serious note?

                                        BATIATUS
                      He can strip naked and fight with 
                        his cock, as long as he wins.

  A SEXY WOMAN in the crowd exposes herself for Gannicus. He 
  grins at her, laughing in approval. The Murmillo strikes, 
  slicing open Gannicus' arm while he's distracted.

                                        MELITTA,
                        Lucretia's body slave, reacts to 
                        the injury. Worry clouds her eyes. 
                        Batiatus shares her concern.

  GANNICUS

  glances at the blood dripping down his arm, locks eyes with 
  the Murmillo. The Murmillo tenses, waiting for Gannicus to 
  retaliate. But instead Gannicus stabs his swords into the 
  ground, disarming himself.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        What is he doing? Quintus --

  Gannicus throws his arms out, mocking the Murmillo, daring 
  him to attack. Murmillo hesitates, then surges forward, 
  hacking and slashing. Gannicus deftly avoids each blow -- 
  and kicks the man in the ass for good measure.

  THE CROWD HOWLS

  in approval. Vettius frowns from the pulvinus, whispers 
  something disapproving to the man next to him. Batiatus eyes 
  the empty seats in the pulvinus, turns back to whisper 
  pleading instruction to Gannicus.

                                        BATIATUS
                      Do not kill him yet... Do not --

  Gannicus retrieves his swords and lands half a dozen 
  lightning fast blows. Batiatus sags. The Murmillo sinks to 
  his knees, keels over dead. Gannicus throws his arms up. The 
  crowd LAUGHS and CHEERS.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    8.

  PULVINUS

  TULLIUS and MAGISTRATE SEXTUS (ep 113, Season 1) finally 
  arrive. Tullius is a dark, handsome man in his mid 40s, 
  flanked by his huge, deadly bodyguard THERON. Vettius leaps 
  up to greet them.

  THE STANDS

  Batiatus glowers at the sight.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Now they arrive.

                        Won in dewy morn. The important 
                        matches do not even begin until 
                        after the midday sun has passed.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Consider yourself fortunate to have 
                        a man in the games at all. Good 
                        Solonius stands with empty hands.

  Batiatus laughs, realizing the truth in that. He clasps his 
  friend on the back.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Come then. Let us see them filled

                                        BATIATUS
                        Vettius  men command the prominent 
                        matches. He has more than enough 
                        eyes to watch him stroke his cock. 
                        I would not add ours to the fucking 
                        sight.

  Batiatus rises, WIPING US TO --                                                                                    9.



  ARM DOWN into the bustling streets of Capua. MERCHANTS hawk 
  their wares. Questionable meats perfume the air. PROSTITUTES 
  display their charms.

  BATIATUS

  strolls through the chaos with Solonius and Lucretia. They 
  are closely followed by Melitta, Acco, and Attending Slaves.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Did you catch the manner of his 
                        eye, as he gazed down from the 
                        pulvinus? Fucking Vettius. Barely 
                        free of his mother's tit, yet 
                        carries himself above lanistas of 
                        more deserving years.

  Batiatus drinks from a wine skin, passes it to Solonius.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Youth often imagines itself swollen

                        Time is what he holds in abundance. 
                        The new arena will be finished in 
                        but a handful of months. If we are 
                        excluded from the opening games...

                        Magistrate favor a boy from Nola 
                        over Capua's own sons?

                        first distinguish ourselves against 
                        Vettius' men. Yet Vettius' men only 
                        fight later in the day.

                        Lucretia?!

  Lucretia turns, shocked to see GAIA launching out of the 
  crowd. Gaia is a stunning beauty dripping with sexuality and 
  mischief, a few years younger than Lucretia (early 30s). 
  She s dressed in the finest appointments, jewels, and an 
  expensive BRACELET adding to the image. Currently blonde, 
  she wears the wigs that we will see Lucretia in during 
  Season 1.

                        Gaia!

  They both shriek like schoolgirls, throwing their arms 
  around each other. Solonius forces a smile, eyeing the crowd 
  to make sure no one of note has witnessed the break in 
  decorum.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)

                        What man dares stand between women 
                        and gossip?

  Lucretia kisses Batiatus and heads off with Gaia. Melitta 
  and a few Attending Slaves follow in their wake.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You must tell me everything. Secret 
                      no detail.

                        Removed from the ears of men, my 
                        lips willingly part...

  She gives Batiatus and Solonius a smile as she heads off. 
  Solonius admires Gaia as she goes.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Gaia returns unencumbered. And in 
                        enticing form.

                        unsuspecting man to his ruin.

  He clasps Solonius on the back, leading him away. Acco and 
  Attending Slaves follow.

  A SIDE STREET

  In the distance the new Capua arena looms, now 80 percent 
  complete. WORKER SLAVES haul stones and equipment past 
  Batiatus and Solonius, heading for the construction site. 
  Batiatus takes in the splendor of it.

                      We will be the ones shamed, if 
                        grand ceremony passes absent our 
                        gladiators. We must force 
                        advantage, before opportunity slips 
                        from grasp.

                                        SOLONIUS

                        and caution.

                        rose above his humble station. Fuck

  Batiatus tosses a coin to a MERCHANT, takes an apple.

                        the heavens. His hands shaped 
                        events resulting in the erection of 
                        the new arena. He supplies slaves

                      Is that all? Well, a simple task

                                        BATIATUS
                        Between us, we have the greatest 
                        gladiators in Capua. Gannicus, 
                        Barca, Arkadios, Decabalis -- Men 
                        forged into something beyond their 
                        worth. Beyond anything that smug 
                        little piss Vettius could ever hope 
                      to offer --

  A commotion interrupts. One of Tullius' Worker Slaves has 
  abandoned his stones in favor of beating the shit out of 
  another. Brutal and ugly. Citizens shout in surprise, 
  scampering out of the way.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Perhaps Tullius should not have 
                        strayed so far abroad in acquiring 
                        his slaves.

  Worker Slave #1 gets his opponent down, fists hammering his 
  face into pulp. APPIUS, a large, bearded slaver, rushes in 
  with two GUARDS. They smash Worker Slave #1 off -- revealing 
  a younger CRIXUS. Hair wild, chin stubbled with beard, face 
  not yet scarred from years in the arena.

                                        APPIUS
                        Crixus! You know of the rules.

  He raises a spiked club to bash Crixus' brains in, but 
  Batiatus intervenes.

                        slaves?

  Appius eyes Batiatus suspiciously.

  Appius raises his club again.

                        The man is barely worth ten. Why 
                        would you pay such a sum for a shit

                        his eyes? The spark smoldering 
                        within his breast? I would give it 
                        tender, to ignite in the arena!

  Appius hesitates, tempted.

                        own purse.

  Appius licks his lips, nods. Batiatus grins, counts out his 
  coins. Realizes he's a few denarii short. He whispers to 
  Solonius.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)

  Batiatus hands the coins over. Appius snorts.

  Batiatus takes Crixus in, musing on that.

  OENOMAUS WIELDS A SWORD,

  the golden rays of the setting sun bathing his marbled flesh 
  as he spars with BARCA (training as a Hoplomachus, with 
  spear and shield). Oenomaus is still a gladiator at this 
  point, although the scars marring his chest, back, and face 
  indicate that his fight with Theokoles is in the past.

  AUCTUS,

    a well-muscled tank of a man (and Barca s lover), spars with 
  GNAEUS nearby. Auctus is also a Hoplomachus, but Gnaeus 
  trains as a Thraex, not the Retiarius he will later become.

  NEW RECRUITS,

  the Mark of the Brotherhood yet to be earned, train in the 
  background. Among them are ASHUR (heavily muscled, face 
  clean shaven), DAGAN, a hulking Syrian, and INDUS, a svelte, 
  athletic youth.

  GANNICUS' CELL DOOR OPENS

  across the square. The Slave Girls spill out, exhausted and 
  glowing. Melitta is waiting with a GUARD to escort them back 
  up to the villa.

                      so much to offer.

  Gannicus grins, taking a swig of wine. The two have an 
  easygoing friendship, filled with good-natured barbs.

                        And so few interested in sharing 
                        it.

  Melitta catches Oenomaus' eye across the square, graces him 
  with a loaded smile. Oenomaus returns it.

  Doctore laughs, signals him permission.

  MESS HALL GATE

  The Guard opens the gate leading up to the villa. Melitta 
  shoos the Slave Girls in.

  Gannicus breaks into a toothy grin, clasping forearms with

                        Well earned. The men all speak of 
                        your triumph.

  Melitta catches the longing in Oenomaus' eyes.

                      As they will of yours, when you

                        geysers, drenching the gods 
                        gathered to witness Oenomaus once 
                        more upon the sands!

  Oenomaus forces a smile, uncertain the day will ever come.

                        I would have words with my wife.

                      It will be missed.

  He drinks, heading off to the baths in all his naked glory. 
  Oenomaus turns to Melitta, anxious.

                        Almost a year has past since I 
                        faced Theokoles. Perhaps Dominus

                        against the Shadow of Death and 
                        live. Batiatus would be a fool to 
                        keep you from the arena.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      Or I am the fool, for dreaming of 
                        such a thing.

                        You are many things. Foolish is not 
                        among them. Batiatus waits but for 
                        the perfect moment for his champion 
                      to retake glory.

  She pulls him into a passionate kiss.

                        Now see your ass back to training, 
                        and be well prepared for the day.

  She disappears with a grin up the stairs. Oenomaus watches 
  her go with a warm smile, her love and confidence 
  infectious. He moves back to the square, WIPING US TO --                                                                                    20.



  The moon blazes in the night sky, illuminating Batiatus and 
  Lucretia. Batiatus drinks as he paces, agitated.

                        Was it? Word surly has reached 
                        Tullius  ear, yet none of gratitude 
                        return. Fifty denarii! Solonius was 
                        right. I should temper patience, as 
                      my father would.

  Lucretia kisses him gently, whispering support.

  Batiatus grins, gaining her meaning.

  He enters her, their faces seized by pleasure and love. 
  REVEAL Gaia watching from the shadows inside the villa. Her 
  hand drops below frame to pleasure herself as she takes in 
  the show. As she bites her lip in mounting ecstasy, the 
  SCREEN IS CONSUMED IN LIGHT, transitioning us to the BLAZING 
  SUN --



  The sun beats down, scorching Gladiators and Recruits as 
  they train under the crack of Doctore's whip. Oenomaus again 
  spars with Barca. Auctus trades blows with Gnaeus.

  CRIXUS

  spars with Ashur. Ashur pivots, smacking Crixus across the 
  face with his practice sword. Dagan chuckles.

                                          DOCTORE

                        brains upon the sand.

                      It was well struck. I will not 
                        repeat the mistake.

  Ashur laughs, attacks. Crixus counters, then raises his 
  shield just in time to deflect Ashur's blow.

                                        ASHUR
                        Good! Again!

  Crixus attacks. Gannicus steps out of his cell across the 
  square, squints in hang-over discomfort at the searing 
  light.

                        the shade.

  Doctore frowns, motions approval. Gannicus takes a practice 
  sword and heads for a palus in the shade. Crixus eyes him 
  curiously as he passes.

                                        ASHUR

                      of deadly skill. He is often 
                        rewarded for his victories with 
                        wine and cunt. Gain Dominus' favor, 
                        and such delights could be yours.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Drink and women are not my concern.

                                        ASHUR
                        More for me, then.

  Ashur attacks. Barca chuckles as he spars with Oenomaus.

                                        BARCA
                        Fucking recruits. Smaller and 
                        smaller each year.

  Oenomaus ignores him, his attention drawn to Batiatus as he 
  appears from the villa. He heads for the main gate, Acco and 
  Attending Slaves in tow. Oenomaus sees a chance to gain 
  notice.

  WHAM! Oenomaus attacks, driving Barca back. Batiatus pauses 
  at the gate, glancing over. Barca counters. They trade bone- 
  shattering blows, but Barca is outmatched. CRACK! Oenomaus 
  sends Barca to the ground, dazed and bleeding. Auctus rushes 
  over to help him.

  Oenomaus barely hides his disappointment.

  Batiatus exits. Crixus hustles over.

                        Gratitude. Your instruction is much 
                        appreciated --

  CRACK! Oenomaus smashes Crixus to the ground with a single 
  blow. He glares down at him, the sting of being assigned to 
  train a raw recruit flaring in his eyes.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Lesson one: never drop your fucking

  Crixus spits blood and painfully rises, WIPING US TO --



  Batiatus anxiously weaves through the crowd with Solonius. 
  Acco and Attending Slaves follow.

  Theron stares down at Batiatus, says nothing. Batiatus licks

                        I wish to express gratitude for 
                        allowing me to purchase his slave 
                        Crixus. The Gaul shows great 
                        promise towards the arena. Perhaps 
                        you could pass word of my 
                        presence...

  Batiatus presses a few coins into Theron's hand. Theron 
  stares at them. Batiatus frowns, adds a few more. Theron 
  disappears inside without a word.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        You owe me a few of those, if you 
                        recall.

  Batiatus hands over the borrowed coins from yesterday.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A costly enterprise.

  His grin falters as he spots Vettius also exiting.

                      In mocking tone.

  Tullius greets Batiatus with a warm smile.

                        Good Batiatus. I hoped for occasion 
                      to give gratitude for relieving me 
                      of that troublesome Gaul.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Think nothing of it. A gesture of 
                        respect, for a man deserving of it.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Received with all intentions. Yet I 
                        fear you have overpaid.

                        A common mistake, for those with no 
                        head towards business.

  Tullius presses a small purse of coins into Batiatus' hands.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Fifty denarii, minus the ten of the 
                        Gaul's actual worth.

  Batiatus is stunned, struggles to regain advantage.

                                        BATIATUS
                        This is -- I do not ask for its 
                        return. Fair bargain was struck.

  Solonius takes Batiatus  arm. Batiatus shakes it off, 
  getting in Vettius' face.

                        Magistrate would not approve such 
                        disruption.

                                          VETTIUS
                        Good Tullius has his ear.

  Vettius looks to Tullius. Tullius considers it, nods.

                                          TULLIUS
                        The Magistrate could be swayed to 
                        allow it... if that is what you 
                        wish?

                        well settled.

  Tullius moves off with Vettius and Theron. Solonius frets.

                        You press beyond advantage.

  A Guard escorts Melitta and Oenomaus to the pantry gate, 
  unlocks it. She embraces her husband.

  He kisses her, their lips lingering, neither wanting to 
  part. She finally disengages, touching his face with a smile 
  before following the Guard up into the villa. A great 
  sadness creeps into Oenomaus' eyes. He turns to go, freezes 
  in concern as he spots

  GANNICUS

   tightrope walking  along the cliff s edge, wine jug in 
  hand, singing a little song to himself.

                                        GANNICUS

                        rages on...

  Oenomaus draws close, hissing to him.

                        well plied with wine to keep nose 
                        from fucking business.

  He takes a swig from his jug.

                        the morning sun may greet you with 
                        your last fucking day.

  A cloud threatens to darken the perpetual twinkle in his eye 
  as he takes another swig. A loose stone gives way under his 
  foot. He tumbles to the sand with a thud, almost going over

  Oenomaus registers that, nods in thanks. Gannicus laughs, 
  returning to his old self as he sings himself to his cell.

  Oenomaus takes a deep drink from the wine jug, turns to head 
  back to his own cell for the night, WIPING US TO --



  A crush of CITIZENS crowd the marketplace. The air is 
  electric as they push and laugh, eyes shining with 
  excitement. Acco parts the crowd, clearing a path as

  BATIATUS

  wears a cloak, the hood up. Lucretia, Gaia (in the classic 
  Lucretia red wig), Solonius, Melitta, and other Attending 
  Slaves follow. Batiatus mock-searches the crowd with a grin.

                        remain within warm safety of his 
                        bed?

  The crowd LAUGHS. Batiatus spots Vettius at the other end of 
  the marketplace, standing with Tullius and Magistrate 
  Sextus. Vettius' gladiator Otho looms close by, as does 
  Tullius' bodyguard Theron.

                        space!

  The crowd complies, creating a ring for the gladiators to 
  fight. Gaia smiles appreciatively at Tullius as she moves.

                        And his purse.

  Lucretia gives Gaia a loaded smile, knowing exactly what 
  she's thinking. Gaia laughs, not denying it.

                        the honor in such a thing?

                        The event turns larger than 
                        expected. Your mad schemes may yet 
                        bear fruit.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Enough for both of us to feast 
                        upon.

  Tullius raises his hands. The din of the crowd dies down.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Gratitude to Magistrate Sextus for

                                to the crowd)(
                      In honor of the Magistrate, 
                        esteemed Tullius, and the people of 
                        Capua... I give you the most 
                        fearsome Gaul ever to take up arms 
                      in the arena! Conqueror of giants! 
                        Slayer of beasts! Behold Gannicus! 
                        Champion of the House of Batiatus!

  Melitta tightens at the title as Gannicus throws off his 
  cloak and steps forward. He is truly a golden god, bound 
  only in a subligaria. A rousing cheer ripples through the 
  crowd. Batiatus beams. Gannicus takes twin swords from 
  Doctore, eyes Otho with a searing grin.

                                          TULLIUS
                        A fine choice. Vettius. Present 
                        your man.

                                          VETTIUS
                        I have no tongue for overripe 
                          embellishment. Nor is it required. 
                        Otho! Stand forth!

  Otho, also in a subligaria, takes his position. The crowd 
  explodes in a deafening ROAR. Lucretia frowns to Batiatus.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        They favor Vettius  offering.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Only until he falls.

  The worry lurking in Batiatus' eyes contradicts the 
  assurance of his words. Otho takes a sword and a shield from 
  VETTIUS' DOCTORE, grins at Gannicus.

                                        OTHO
                        Your day finally comes.

                        Now, let us judge who stands the 
                        better house!

  Tullius nods to the Magistrate. Otho and Gannicus tense as 
  Magistrate Sextus raises his fist and --

                                          VETTIUS
                        Apologies, Magistrate. There 
                        appears to be something missing.
                                (calling to 
                                  Batiatus)
                        Where is your man's blindfold?

  Batiatus sputters in shock. The crowd WHISPERS. Vettius 
  grins, his trap sprung.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Blindfold? What --

                        That was your boast, was it not? 
                        That your gladiator could best any 
                      of my men absent sight...?

  Vettius holds out a ragged piece of cloth, offering it as 
  the blindfold. Batiatus turns to Tullius for help. Tullius 
  reluctantly can give none..

                                          TULLIUS
                        You did voice such challenge.

  Lucretia stiffens. Gannicus tenses. The crowd MURMURS 
  excitedly. Batiatus attempts to dismiss the matter.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A simple figure of speech, not 
                        meant to -- Good Tullius --

                                          VETTIUS
                      If Batiatus does not wish to honor 
                        terms, he should remove himself. 
                        With tail between legs.

  The crowd CHUCKLES. Batiatus looks to Gannicus, trapped. A 
  tense beat. Gannicus turns from Otho, holding his swords out 
  for Doctore to take.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Doctore.

  CONTINUED:

  Otho grins. The crowd chuckles. Batiatus deflates. Doctore 
  takes the swords -- but Gannicus doesn't retreat. Instead 
  hecrosses to Vettius and takes the blindfold. The crowd 
  titters. Gannicus ties the blindfold around his head, just 
  above his eyes.

                                          DOCTORE

                        What are you doing?

  Gannicus retrieves his swords.

                                        GANNICUS
                                (loudly, for the 
                                  crowd)
                        The task should not be that 
                        difficult. I need only direct my 
                        blades towards the smell of shit.

  The crowd ROARS as Gannicus pulls the blindfold down over 
  his eyes. Doctore glowers.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Ever the fool.

                        The choice is removed from my 
                        hands.

  Gannicus raises his swords, readying himself. The Magistrate 
  raises his fist and brings it down.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                        Begin!

  Otho GRUNTS and attacks with sword and shield [Note: Otho 
  grunts loudly before each attack]. Gannicus narrowly 
  counters. Melitta's heart leaps into her throat.

                                        GAIA
                        How thrilling. I have never seen 
                        such a thing.

                        For good reason.

  He shoots Batiatus a worried look. Batiatus ignores it, 
  focusing a glare at Vettius. Vettius grins.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

  THE CROWD REACTS

  as Otho draws blood. Melitta tenses. Gannicus shakes it off. 
  Otho grunts, attacks. Gannicus counters and miraculously 
  lands a blow of his own, drawing blood. The crowd ROARS. 
  Batiatus brightens.

  OTHO GRUNTS,

  attacking. Gannicus counters, but Otho clocks Gannicus in 
  the face with his shield. Blood flies. Otho redoubles his 
  attack, pummeling and hacking at Gannicus. Gannicus 
  staggers, bleeding and bruised. Otho circles Gannicus, 
  playing for the crowd. Batiatus sags.

                                          SOLONIUS(cont'd)

                      To be remembered only in its 
                        failing.

  Gannicus desperately tries to keep a fix on where Otho is, 
  but the sounds of the crowd are disorienting. Otho gets 
  behind him. He grunts, going in for the kill. Gannicus spins 
  at the last second, narrowly avoiding Otho's sword. TIME 
  SLOWS as the blade just barely SLICES THROUGH GANNICUS' 
  BLINDFOLD, restoring his vision.

  GANNICUS SURGES,

  attacking with a series of lightning fast blows, ending by 
  SLAMMING HIS SWORD through the big man's face and out the 
  back of his head. The crowd goes silent. Batiatus gawks, not 
  believing his eyes.

  OTHO

  takes a few shaky steps with the sword lodged in his skull, 
  then collapses, dead before he hits the ground. The crowd 
  EXPLODES.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Yes! Have you ever seen such a 
                        fucking thing?!

  Gannicus, more dead than alive, grins at Melitta. Melitta 
  returns it, greatly relieved for her friend.

                        man less prone to death against the 
                        mighty Gannicus!

  Vettius glowers, his hatred for Batiatus multiplied.

  The Magistrate moves off.

                        position in the games.

                        Nestor's shop after the market has 
                        closed, and we shall discuss your 
                        man at length.

  He smiles warmly at Gaia as he exits, Vettius in tow. 
  Batiatus basks in his triumph, signaling his approval to 
  Gannicus. The crowd mobs him, anxious to soak rags and the 
  tip of robes in his blood. They press in, WIPING US TO --



  Batiatus crashes out of Nestor's shop. He takes off through 
  the mostly deserted street, fleeing for his life. Theron, 
  Vettius, and his brutes chase after him. Music swells, 
    TRANSITIONING US TO --                                                                                    53.



  Batiatus gets cut off by Theron. He turns to run the other 
  way, but Vettius and his men are there. Batiatus tries to 
  fight, but he's quickly overpowered. Vettius and his men 
  beat the living shit out of him.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:



  Batiatus gasps on the ground, his face bloodied and raw. He 
  spits blood, barely conscious. Tullius appears, looming over 
  him.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I make fair offer. And you produce

                        what that feels like, Batiatus?

  Tullius reaches down OUT OF FRAME and parts his robes. 
  Batiatus sputters as Tullius pisses on him. A show of power. 
  He finishes, closes his robes.

                                          TULLIUS(cont'd)
                        Reconsider your answer. Or be 
                        excluded from the games forever.

  CONTINUED:

  Tullius exits. Vettius spits on Batiatus, laughing as he 
  follows with the men. Batiatus' eyes flutter shut as he 
  loses consciousness. ANGLE UP to reveal the PARTIALLY 
  COMPLETED ARENA looming in the distance.


  FADE OUT.
