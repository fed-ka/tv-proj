                                JACK
                We have to get rid of the bodies.

    WIDEN to see him conferring with Kate and Sayid as he dresses 
    Charlie s wound.

                                CHARLIE
                  What, bury them?  There s a whole 
                  bunch in there--

                                SAYID
                  More than twenty.  Digging will be 
                  difficult without shovels or--

                                JACK
                  Not bury.  We have to burn them.

    The other three react, taken aback by that.  Jack notices --

                                JACK (CONT D)
                  What?

                      KATEJACK
    They re people.-- I know they re people, 
                                                Kate...

                                SAYID
                  Burning the remains... They deserve 
                  better than--





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST   "Walkabout"         (BLUE)         7/20/04     6.



                                JACK
                  Than what?  Getting eaten by wild 
                  animals?   Cause that s what s 
                  gonna happen.  Any bodies we bury 
                  won t stay buried for long.  Look, 
                I know it seems harsh.  But that 
                  fuselage, in the sun, it s not 
                  about what they deserve...
                        (softening)
                  They re gone.  And we re not.

    Sayid looks at the ground, shaking his head.

                                SAYID
                  What you say may be true.
                        (looks back up to Jack)
                  But it s not right.  For us to 
                  decide how these people are laid to 
                  rest, with no regard to their own 
                  wishes -- their religions-

                                JACK
                We don t have time to sort out 
                  everybody s God.

                                CHARLIE
                  Really?  Last I heard, we re 
                  positively made of time.

                      KATECHARLIE
    Charlie...-- What?  I m just saying...

                                JACK
                  Hey, I m not happy about it either.  
                  But the plane crashed a thousand 
                  miles off-course.  They re looking 
                  for us in the wrong place.  If 
                  they re even still looking.
                        (then)
                  It s been four days.  Nobody s 
                  coming.

    The remainder of this registers on Sayid s face.

                                JACK (CONT D)
                In the morning, we need everybody 
                to start collecting wood... Dried 
                  brush... We re going in turn that 
                  fuselage into a furnace.

                                KATE
                  Crematorium, you mean.

    Jack looks at her.  And nods.  Starts to exit, STOPS --

                  We ll wait until the sun goes down *
                  tomorrow night to set the fire.*

    Kate nods as Jack goes.  As the others start to disperse, 
    Charlie looks at Kate...

                                CHARLIE
                If he s so eager to get this done,  *
                  why re we waiting  til...*

                                KATE
                  He s hoping somebody ll see it.

    She crosses off as Charlie takes that in...


    CLOSE UP ON LOCKE, in crisp white shirt and tie, jotting 
    something down in an open file.  Suddenly his phone TRILLS.  
    Locke picks it up:

                  Locke!

    Locke looks up from his call and we reveal...*

    RANDY, an office supervisor, standing at the entrance to 
    Locke s cubicle.

    That s right, Locke s a mid-level management cubicle jockey.

                                RANDY (CONT D)
                I told you.  I need those TPS

                  Not twelve-thirty.  Not twelve-
                  fifteen.  Noon!

    Locke, evenly, though clearly peeved:

                                LOCKE
                I heard you the first time, Randy.

  As Randy starts to leave, he adds:

                                RANDY
                  And no personal calls during office 
                  hours.  Colonel.

    Randy moves off, barely suppressing a snicker and we re... *

    CLOSE ON WARREN, forty-ish, short-sleeve shirt and tie.

                                WARREN
                  You ve got to move, Colonel... Your

    REVERSE ON LOCKE, sitting across from him, unperturbed.

                                LOCKE
                  Patience -- a quality you lack, GL-

                                RANDY (O.S.)
                  Really...?*

    CUT OUT to reveal they re seated at a table in a small office 
    BREAKROOM -- VENDING MACHINES line one wall.  On the table is  *
  a GAME BOARD - A flat map of the world, with color-*
    differentiated army figures grouped in different areas. *

    Locke s boss RANDY stands over them, holding a clipboard -- *

                                RANDY (CONT D)
                  Hallmark, huh?  Tell me more about *
                  being a leader, Locke.*

    Locke looks at him with muted annoyance, then takes a large  *
    bite from his sandwich as Randy pulls up a chair and sits -- *

                                RANDY (CONT D)*
                  And while you re at it, explain the  *
                  deal with this  Colonel  thing?  *
                  Perused your file in Human *

                  Shut up, Goldberg.*
                        (back on Locke)*
                So where d you serve, Colonel?*

    Locke doesn t like this guy, but has to take it --*

                                LOCKE*
                  I m just playing a game, Randy.  *
                  This is my lunch hour and I can...*

                                RANDY
                  What s a  Walkabout? *

    Locke STIFFENS as Randy produces a COLOR BROCHURE from his  *
    clipboard and reads:*

                  the Aborigines as you tour the *
                  fabled Australian outback...*

    Locke reaches over, SNATCHES the brochure from Randy s hands. *

    You ve no right taking that *

                                LOCKE
                  Not that you d understand... but a  *
                  Walkabout is a journey of spiritual  *
                  renewal... where one derives *

                I have vacation days, Randy.  I m *
                  going.  Already made a reservation. *

    Warren is SURPRISED by this --*

                                WARREN*
                  Wow, John, you re really doing it,  *
                  huh?  You tell Helen yet?*

    Locke shoots a glance at Warren as --*

                                RANDY*
                  Helen?  What s this?  Locke, you  *
                  actually got a woman in your life?*

                                LOCKE*
                  That s none of your business.*

                                RANDY*
                  What is it with you, Locke?  Why do  *
                  you torture yourself, imagining 
                  you re some globe-trotting spy or *
                  hunter...  Collecting your 
                  brochures for wilderness trips, 
                  rafting down the Amazon... and *
                  Walkabouts?  Wake up -- You can t *

                  Norman Croucher.  He s a double *

                to the top of Mount Everest.  Why?   *
                It was his destiny.*






                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"         (BLUE)         7/20/04     29.



    Randy knocks over a few of the army pieces, KNOWING he s 
    ruining the game and Locke is powerless to stop him...

                                RANDY
                  That what you think, old man?  You  *
                  have a destiny?*

                                LOCKE
                  Everyone has a destiny, Randy.  
                  Mine just hasn t been revealed to 
                me yet.  While yours is to grow 
                  soft and fat, working in this 
                  office, pushing your papers and 
                  reports... Always clamoring for 
                  promotions that ll never come.

    This stings.  Randy leans into him, pissed.

                                RANDY
                  Watch yourself, Locke.  Unless you 
                  wanna find yourself out of a job.

    And with that, Randy pushes away from the table.  As he huffs 
    out, he shakes his head, SCOFFS --

                                RANDY (CONT D)
                  Destiny.

    CLOSE ON LOCKE, relenting, his eyes drift down.  Subordinated 
  by this fucking WANKER.  Softly.  Almost PITIFULLY --

                                LOCKE
                  Just... Don t tell me what I can t 
                  do.


  ON LOCKE, reaching the bottom, then moving with purpose, 
    tracking the boar... 

                                LOCKE (PRE-LAP)
                  I ve never felt so alive...


  We HEAR Locke s voice speaking to someone as we

    PAN ACROSS a moderately low-rent apartment, littered with 
    books; travel magazines and, inexplicably, some kind of 
    Electronic Muscle Stimulator (EMS) Unit with several wires 
    emanating from it.  A HAND adjusts the controls on it.

                                LOCKE (INTO PHONE)
                  Getting to finally tell Randy off --  *
                It was... life-changing.*

    Continuing the PAN, we find the hand belongs to          
    LOCKE sitting on his Murphy bed, talking on the phone.  The 
    wires from the EMS dip just below frame.

                                LOCKE (INTO PHONE) (CONT D)
                I mean it -- Now I m free to do all *
                  the things I ve ever wanted to do.  
                  Things I know I was destined to do.  
                  Like we talked about, Helen...

  We hear the filtered voice of a woman on the line.

                                HELEN (V.O.)
                  It s... wonderful, John.  I m happy 
                  for you.  Really.

                                LOCKE (INTO PHONE)
                I haven t even told you the best *
                  part.  Remember that Authentic 
                  Aboriginal Walkabout --

                                HELEN (V.O.)
                  Sure.  It s all you ve talked about 
                  for weeks.

                                LOCKE (INTO PHONE)
                  Yeah, well... I m really going to 
                do it.  I m flying to Australia at 
                  the end of the week.
                        (shifting nervously)
                I bought... two tickets.

  He waits, but there s just silence on the other line.

      LOCKE (INTO PHONE) (CONT D)HELEN (V.O.)
    Helen...?-- John, we talked about 
  -- I know, but--this.  I like you.  And I ve 
                                                enjoyed talking with you 
  -- So have I --these past few months --

                                LOCKE (INTO PHONE) (CONT D)
                -- Eight months.

                                HELEN (V.O.)
                  I m not allowed to meet customers.

                                LOCKE (INTO PHONE)
                  Customer?  Is that what I am to--

                                HELEN (V.O.)
                  This isn t really normal... I mean, 
                it isn t what I do.  Maybe you 
                  should find a... I dunno... 
                  therapist.

                                LOCKE (INTO PHONE)
                        (starting to fume)
                I have a therapist.

                                HELEN (V.O.)
                  John--

                                LOCKE (INTO PHONE)
                I thought you understood, Helen.  
                  You know me better than anyone.

                                HELEN (V.O.)
                  John, if we talk any longer I m 
                  gonna have to charge you for 
                  another hour.  That s another 
                  $89.95.  You can t afford that any--

                                LOCKE (INTO PHONE)
                I don t care about money!  I just--

                                HELEN (V.O.)
                  I m sorry, John.  I gotta go.

    There is a click as she hangs up.

                                LOCKE (INTO PHONE)
                  Helen?!  HELEN!!

    PUSH IN ON LOCKE, abandoned, furious -- He SLAMS down the

    CLOSE ON an Aussie TRAVEL AGENT, sitting at his desk inside 
    the storefront operation.

                -- The Walkabouts we arrange aren t 
                  just some stroll through the

                  treacherous waters -- climbing -- *

    CLOSE ON LOCKE, sitting across from him, dressed in a khaki 
    vest, cap and dark sunglasses.  A small, bitter smile masking  *
    his contempt.

                                LOCKE
                  You ve got no idea who you re 
                  talking to.  Believe me.  I m well 
                  aware of what s involved...

                                TRAVEL AGENT
                        (cutting him off)
                In any case, it s a trying ordeal 
                  for someone in peak physical 
                  condition, let alone --

                  Look -- I booked this tour a month 
                  ago.  You ve already got my money.  *
                  Now I demand a place on that bus--

                TRAVEL AGENT*LOCKE*
    You misrepresented yourself.*
                                              -- I never lied. *

                                TRAVEL AGENT
                By omission, Mr. Locke!  You 
                  neglected to tell us about your 
                  condition --

                                LOCKE
                        (snapping)
                My condition -- is not an issue!  
                  I ve lived with it for four years 
                  and it s never kept me--

                                TRAVEL AGENT
                  Yes, well, unfortunately, it s an 
                  issue to our insurance company.*

    Seeing this going nowhere, the Travel Agent stands and 
    crosses past Locke, who doesn t get up.

                                TRAVEL AGENT (CONT D)*
                  I m sorry.  I can t keep the bus 
                  waiting any longer.  It isn t fair 
                to the other people--

                                LOCKE
                  Don t talk to me about fair! --

                                TRAVEL AGENT
                -- We can put you on a plane back 
                to Sydney on our dime.  It s the 
                  best we can do--

  We see through a large window, a tour bus waiting to leave,  *
    its doors open, the guide on the steps looking at his watch. *







                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  53.



                                LOCKE
                I don t want to go back to Sydney!  
                  I ve spent years preparing for 
                  this. -- You put me on that bus 
                  right now!  I can do this!

                                TRAVEL AGENT
                      (at the doorway)
                  No.  You can t.

  He exits to confer with the guide as Locke yells after him. *

                                LOCKE
                  Don t you walk away from me!

  He suddenly swivels around...

                                LOCKE (CONT D)
                  You don t know who you re dealing 
                  with. -- Don t ever tell me what I 
                  can t do!  Ever!...*

  As he rolls himself toward the window, PULL OUT to REVEAL...

    LOCKE IS IN A WHEELCHAIR.  And has been throughout the entire 
    flashbacks.  Shot to hide it, but dropping subtle clues:  The 
    unscuffed shoes, the waist-high shelving, the EMS unit, etc. *

    THE BUS doors close and it pulls away.  The Travel Agent 
    looks back at Locke, shakes his head and walks away.  Just 
    doesn t want to deal with the guy...

                                LOCKE (CONT D)*
                  This is destiny!  This is my  *
                  destiny!  I m supposed to do this, *
                  dammit!!!*

    PULL UP HIGH and WIDE, Locke looking small and impotent...

                                LOCKE (CONT D)
                  DON T TELL ME WHAT I CAN T--
