Celeste and Jesse stand in the driveway of Celeste's house.
There is a bit of a linger.
CELESTE
Well, I'm exhausted.
JESSE
Me too.
Celeste walks to her front door with her key and Jesse heads
towards the side gate with his key. It is now obvious that he
is living in her guest house.
CELESTE
Hey, it's kinda chilly tonight,
how's the heat in there?
JESSE
Oh, it's fine. I'm fine.
He keeps walking. He turns again to Celeste.
12.
JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
Sorry I'm still living here. Times
are tough and money's tight so you
know...
CELESTE
Jesse, please, you can stay here as
long as you like. It's your
studio. It's actually really nice
to have you here.
JESSE
For me too.
CELESTE
Oh, don't forget, the contractor
needs to get in there for
measurements in the morning. So
make sure your thingys, your
sculptures, whatever...are out of
the way.
JESSE
Got it.
CELESTE
Night.
JESSE
Night. Love you.
CELESTE
Love you too.
Jesse and SKILLZ, 32, another man-boy, in hip-hop gear, wait
in a very, very long line of very, very hip people at LA's
trendiest new yogurt place.
SKILLZ
The economic climate is real bad,
man. And I think my business is
taking the hardest hit of all. It's
brutal. And no one's talking about
it.
JESSE
You sell pot.
SKILLZ
Not for long, dude. Have you been
to those weed pharmacies? They're
killing me. I gotta branch out.
Maybe start working in
methamphetamines? Or maybe teach
pre-school. I always wanted to do
that. I love kids.
Skillz is distracted by something.
SKILLZ (CONT'D) (CONTD)
Sorry, I know this is serious talky
time but would you look at the
fucking seat on that girl?
18.
We see a girl's apple bottom butt stuffed into blue jeans.
SKILLZ (CONT'D) (CONTD)
THAT is a party.
Jesse does not laugh. He looks like he is in pain.
JESSE
I don't think it's over.
SKILLZ
What? Her butt? No, it will never
be over. It goes on forever. It's
like space. So great.
JESSE
No, Celeste and I. I think she's
just confused and overwhelmed right
now about everything. But she'll
come around. She always does.
SKILLZ
Uh oh. It's been a while now. I
think it's over, bro. It may be
time to accept that and move on.
Call that dime Veronica.
Jesse looks uncomfortable.
JESSE
That was a one time thing, a couple
months after Celeste and I broke
up. Celeste does not know about
that. And we will keep it that
way.
SKILLZ
Didn't know that was a hit and run.
Sounded like you liked her.
JESSE
Well, she's not Celeste. It's
always been Celeste. I'm not ready
to give up.
SKILLZ
Okay, but remember, you can't re-
heat a souffle.
JESSE
Huh?
19.
SKILLZ
Also, there's Bettys everywhere.
It's LA. Maybe it's good to remind
Celeste that you can pull wool.
Make her sweat a little bit.
JESSE
It definitely wouldn't hurt to...go
out with somebody.
They reach the front of the line.
YOGURT GIRL
Do you know what you want?
JESSE
Yeah, I want to not be a quitter. I
don't want to start all over again.
I want everything that I believed
to have been true to be true. I
also want a goji berry/green tea
swirl with yogurt chips and Fruity
Pebbles. Please.
SKILLZ
(to Yogurt Girl) Hey, you should go
out on a date with my friend here.
YOGURT GIRL
Um, wait, where's your wife? You
guys are here like everyday
together.
JESSE
Well...we're separated.
YOGURT GIRL
Oh. Cool. I mean, bummer. But okay.
I'll go.
The studio is beautifully, magically chaotic. There are
large canvasses everywhere, paint rags, spray cans, common
household items turned into sculptures (buttons, clothespin,
hangers) and mobiles. Celeste walks in. Jesse is on a
mattress on the floor, he's clearly been sitting there for a
while. He is fist-deep in a huge bag of Cheetos and he's
watching the 2008 Beijing Olympics on Tivo. He is watching a
short feature about Olympian Matthias Steiner, a gold
medalist in weight lifting.
CELESTE
Hey...you're not working? Are you
watching the Olympics? Again? And
crying? Again?
Jesse blows his nose.
JESSE
Yeah.
CELESTE
God, you really love that, don't
you?
JESSE
Matthias' wife died in a car
accident last year.
CELESTE
Well, three years ago now but...
JESSE
And he dedicated his gold medal to
her. The human spirit
is...unbreakable.
Jesse is choked up, can barely speak.
CELESTE
Uh huh. Hey, did you finish that
artwork for the Pop Form website?
JESSE
Huh? Oh yeah, I'm almost done. I'm
working on it. I think you'll
really like it.
CELESTE
I'll like it more when I have it
because I needed it yesterday,
so...
23.
Jesse turns off the television, takes a deep breath, wipes
his eyes and recovers.
JESSE
Celeste, can you sit down for a
minute? I have something really
important to tell you.
CELESTE
Oh. Okay. Does it have something to
do with the work you owe me?
Celeste sits. Jesse sits next to her. Again, he has tears in
his eyes.
JESSE
I don't know how to tell you this
but...I have a date tonight. I'm
gonna start dating. People.
CELESTE
A date? Really? That is so great.
JESSE
It is? You don't...
CELESTE
Yeah! Don't cry. Good for you,
Jess.
JESSE
That doesn't bother you? Wow, okay.
Well, it's actually the Yogurt
Girl. From Yoga Yurt?
CELESTE
Really? Yogurt Girl, huh. She's
cute! But so young, right?
JESSE
Super young. Her body is all-time.
CELESTE
Okay, no need for that. But this is
good! You gotta crawl before you
walk. I mean she's definitely not
gonna be wifey number two, right?
Ha.
JESSE
Well, it's just a date.
She hugs him in an unconsciously patronizing way.
24.
CELESTE
Big move. I'm proud of you.
Jesse looks confused and slightly hurt.
JESSE
Thanks?
CELESTE
Can I get up now?
JESSE
Huh? Yeah, sure.
Celeste gets up and is immediately fixated by his hair.
JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
Yeah, Skillz kinda made me do it
and from the get go, she was way
into...what are you looking at?
CELESTE
No, nothing. Are you gonna wear
your hair like that?
JESSE
What? Oh. I don't know, is it
weird?
CELESTE
Not weird, just different from how
it looks best.
She walks over and starts messing with his hair as he
continues.
JESSE
Anyway, this is what we're doing
right? We're getting divorced and
we're friends and we're also dating
people? That's what we're doing?
She is satisfied with her work. She steps back.
CELESTE
There. Better. You'll be great. You
don't even need to be great. Just
be you. Take her somewhere nice.
JESSE
Okay mom.
CELESTE
Call me after?
25.
Again, with the morning symphony. Celeste drinks coffee, eats
breakfast, surfs the internet and flips through magazines.
This time, she's also listening to a song from Riley Banks'
new album. It's exactly what she thought it would be.
Overproduced, auto-tuned and meaningless. She nods her head,
"yeah, I get it." She turns it off.
Celeste can't stop herself from constantly looking over at
the studio to see if Yogurt Girl is still in there. Finally,
a sleeping Jesse stirs for a minute and changes position. He
is alone. Phew.
Jesse and Skillz are exiting a Bizmarkie concert, surrounded
by older hip-hop fans and young hipsters who weren't alive
when the Biz dropped his first album. They are trashed.
SKILLZ
Oh baby youuuuuuuu, you got what I
neeeeeed...
JESSE
And you say he's just a friend, and
you say he's just a friend....
JESSE SKILLZ
Oh baby youuuuu.... Oh baby youuuuu....
Jesse's iPhone rings. A very flirty picture of Celeste comes
up.
SKILLZ
No, no, no. Ignore for sure.
29.
JESSE
Uh, I just need to...(picks up)
Hey.
SKILLZ
(whispering) Nooooo!
JESSE
(talking to Celeste) Uh huh. Okay.
Okay. No, I'm not busy. (hangs up)
Uh, I'm gonna go home.
SKILLS
Come on, after the show it's the
after party.
JESSE
There's an Ikea dresser that she
needs me to "build."
Skillz takes this in. He is impressed.
SKILLZ
Huh. Really, cowboy? Are you
guys...
JESSE
I told you pal, I know what I'm
know I'm doing. She just needed
time.
Celeste and Jesse are in bed. Celeste is asleep. Jesse wakes
up and gently kisses Celeste all over her face. This wakes
her up. She is hungover and confused.
CELESTE
Hey. What are you doing?
JESSE
I love you.
Celeste does not respond. She pops up out of bed.
CELESTE
Okay...
JESSE
We should talk about this.
CELESTE
Yeah. Whoa, we were drunk. What a
bad idea. I'm sorry.
JESSE
Don't be sorry. It was nice. And I
love you.
CELESTE
Oh Jess, I don't...come on, we were
drunk, and the dresser and I
thought...you're dating other
people!
JESSE
Only to...god, I'm so stupid.
He realizes how pathetic it sounds.
CELESTE
Oh no, I thought...
JESSE
You thought what?
32.
CELESTE
Well, clearly I wasn't thinking. Or
I wouldn't have let it happen. Come
on Jess, we're not getting back
together, you didn't think...
Celeste realizes he did think...Jesse is crushed. He gets up
and leaves. He turns.
JESSE
You know, there's a guy that you
can call, from Ikea, that will
build you're dresser. You should
call him. Hell, he'll probably fuck
you too. I'm a fucking idiot.
CELESTE
Jess! No, I didn't..Jess!
Celeste collapses back in the bed.
Celeste enters through her side gate. She has some Chinese
takeout in her hand. She heads for the studio. She sees that
Jesse is not there. Neither is any of his shit. It's
completely empty and sterile now. He's gone.
Celeste is about to go on the road for work. She is on the
phone.
CELESTE
No, just make sure the San Fran
focus group has a little more
diversity than last time. It was
like a rave. Without drugs. Okay.
She hangs up and pauses. Then dials again.
35.
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
Hey, Jess, it's me. I'm getting on
a plane but I'd really like to talk
to you. I don't know what happened
last night. Hope you're okay. Call
me.
CUT TO:
Jesse is walking.
JESSE
(on the phone) Hey. You're back. I
want to talk to you.
JESSE
Really? Like subtitles or dubbed?
Wait, actually, I'm really close to
your house right now. Can I come
by for a minute? It's....important.
CUT TO:
Celeste and Max wait for their cars at the valet stand. Max's
car arrives. He pays the valet.
CELESTE
This was great! I'm free next
Wednesday? Sushi?
MAX
Um, I don't think we should.
CELESTE
Oh, because of mercury poisoning? I
think that's a myth. I go to this
acupuncturist that...
45.
MAX
No, I think you may need some time.
To get over, you know, your
divorce. It took me a long time to
start dating after mine.
CELESTE
Thank you for your concern but I'm
just fine. I guess you're just not
a match for me.
MAX
Well, have a good night. Good luck.
Max gets in his car and is gone. Celeste stands there,
confused and alone. She shakes him off.
CELESTE
(sotto) Whatever.
Celeste is running...hard. It is a cacophony of street sounds
around her: traffic, honking, speeding, Celeste listens to
the Dirty Projectors "Stillness is the Move" on her iPod and
joyfully runs across the street.
Celeste arrives to meet Beth. She is in full marathon gear.
She waves at Beth and enters, panting.
CELESTE
Hi honey!
BETH
Hi, wow, you are really out of
breath. Did you fucking run here??
From West Hollywood??
CELESTE
Yeah I ran. Just started. It's
really fun.
BETH
You're soaking wet. Isn't that like
12 miles??
CELESTE
13.5 actually. I was just clearing
my head, you know, keeping the
endorphins up.
46.
Celeste pants like she's about to collapse. She doubles over
with her hands on her knees. She's in pain.
BETH
Do you...want to sit down?
CELESTE
Oh, okay! Wow, is this it? It's so
nice.
Celeste flops on the couch full prostrate. A saleswoman
approaches.
SALESWOMAN
I'm so sorry but that's a one-of-a-
kind piece that was handwoven by a
tribe of Afghani women. So if you
could maybe just sit over there?
The saleswoman points to a metal industrial, uncomfortable
looking chair.
CELESTE
Right. Sorry. Totally.
BETH
Wow, you are a sweat tsunami.
CELESTE
You should get it. It's really
pretty.
Celeste gets up and there is an outline of Celeste's entire
body in sunblock and sweat. They look at the wreckage.
BETH
Uh boy.
CELESTE
Don't worry. I know people who can
get that out. Easily.
BETH
Okay. I guess I'm getting it.
RUPERT BATES, 22, very handsome, British, wearing a leather
jacket, sporting tousled actor hair is playing a hideously
earnest original song on the guitar. He sings with passion.
He looks up at Celeste and winks.
CUT TO:
Celeste,on the couch, looking slightly mortified. She smiles
tepidly at him.
50.
Rupert finishes the song, closes his eyes and hangs his head.
A beat of silence. Celeste musters up a short and slow round
of applause.
CELESTE
That was so...good.
RUPERT
I wrote that for my mum.
CELESTE
Lucky lady. So how do you know
Skillz?
RUPERT
He provides me with the happy smoky
green treats.
CELESTE
(sotto) Ew.
Celeste cringes. What a dork. Rupert slides next to Celeste
and is all of a sudden right in her face. He touches her
hair. He kisses her, deeply. He pulls away and takes her in.
RUPERT
Hello, Special One.
CELESTE
Oh...hi. Oh god. (whispers) Oh no,
no, no I gotta go.
People file out of the conference room. Celeste walks down
the hall quickly to the bathroom.
Celeste sits on the balcony with Nick Moran. He has Indy
rocker hair and a Los Feliz beard. He's hip and smart in an
effortless way. Celeste is feeling him. They drink wine and
laugh.
CELESTE
So you pissed in your pants?
NICK
I waited seven hours. Three of them
soaking in my own pee. But I
finally got the shot of
Ahmadinejad.
He hands her a photograph.
CELESTE
Wow. That is incredible. I think
he's smiling, maybe.
NICK
He is. I think the piss stain
running down my jeans made him
laugh.
CELESTE
Well, the world will think you're
brilliant. No one will ever know
but me.
54.
NICK
I was nominated for a Pulitzer. I
didn't win.
CELESTE
Well, the guy who won shit his
pants, so...
They laugh. They are connecting.
NICK
(looking at his watch) Oh my god,
we missed our reservation. It was
at 8:30. Should I call down and see
if they can still take us?
CELESTE
How about room service?
NICK
Perfect.
Celeste runs really hard, listening to her Sunny Levine's
"Glass Jaw" on her iPhone. She stops suddenly. She sees
Jesse's number, she hits "Ignore." She starts running again
with purpose.
Celeste drives and listen to her phone on bluetooth.
JESSE V.O.
Hey, so, I'm glad you can meet up.
4pm is good. There's this little
place by me, Vegan Vittles on
Elysian Way, kinda hard to find,
call me if you get lost.
56.
CELESTE
Vegan Vittles.
CUT TO:
Celeste and Beth enter and survey the scene. Beth is dressed
like a little boy with a short brown wig, sunglasses and
sneakers. Celeste is in a white trash bag with a belt.
CELESTE
Jesse's a fucking vegan??
BETH
A vegan who's soon to have his work
shown. At the Gagosian.
CELESTE
The Gagosian?? You're kidding.
What, the fucking clothespin thing?
When??
(MORE)
61.
CELESTE (CONTD)
Don't tell me actually...how did
anybody even know about his art, he
doesn't...I don't actually want to
know...god, he's on fire right now.
Breaking up with me was the best
thing that ever happened to Jesse.
I should break up with me.
BETH
Now, now. Someone else's success
is not your demise, C.
CELESTE
Shut up. Unless it's Jesse's. Who
are dressed as again?
BETH
Beiber.
CELESTE
Ooh, he just got a buzzcut.
BETH
Really? Fuck. When??
CELESTE
A couple hours ago. It was on
Perez.
BETH
That's so sad. His hair was
everything.
CELESTE
I need to fucking drink.
Two large dudes, one dressed as Peter Pan, the other as Snow
White walk by.
PETER PAN
We're doing Car Bombs in the
kitchen. Wanna come?
BETH
Noooo.
CELESTE
YES.
CUT TO:
62.
Celeste and Paul sit away from the party, smoking cigarettes.
PAUL
(Playful) Sorry about that day at
the gym. I feel really open after
yoga...
CELESTE
Shhhh. Don't say open. Your
costume's great. Don't ruin it.
PAUL
I'm kidding. I only go to yoga to
meet girls. Speaking of, what's the
deal with you and me? Is this
happening? Or...
64.
CELESTE
My husband of six years wants a
divorce so he can marry the woman
who's carrying his child. That's
the deal with you and me.
PAUL
I'm sorry, that sounds tough.
CELESTE
He's having a baby with a girl he
barely knows. He's so lost. He's
just going about it all...wrong.
PAUL
And you're right. Now what?
CELESTE
What do you mean?
PAUL
Well do you want to be right or do
you want to be happy?
CELESTE
Listen, Yoga, I don't WANT to be
right, I AM right. People will let
you down. I've accepted that fact,
but unfortunately, most of the
time, knowing that does keep you
from being happy. But at least
it's real.
PAUL
No one has ever given a more self-
righteous monologue wearing only a
trash bag. Except for maybe the
homeless guy outside my dry
cleaners.
Beth and Tucker approach Celeste and Paul.
BETH
Time to go, drunky.
They head off.
PAUL
(yells to Celeste) Call me!
65.
Celeste carries a box of Jesse's stuff to his front door.
She doesn't knock. She leaves the box by the door. But she
decides to keep the one journal with the sweet passages for
herself; she deserves it and he'll never know. She starts to
walk away when she notices, it's trash day.
CUT TO:
Three trash cans-green, brown, and blue-are lined up in the
driveway. A huge box is protruding from the blue can.
Celeste considers. So much to be learned from the trash. She
slowly walks over. She peeks in at the box; it has a big
picture of a fancy stroller on the side of it. Crushing.
CELESTE
At least they recycle.
Celeste is still digging in the trash. She looks further
down.
67.
CELESTE
Guitar Hero?? That's quite an
extravagant purchase for a
freelance writer and his "elegant"
Belgian bride.
All of a sudden, her diamond bracelet slips off her wrist and
plunks to the bottom.
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
Shit. Shit shit shit.
She drops Jesse's journal to the concrete and crawls into the
trash can, still reaching for the bottom, not quite getting
there. The trash can falls over with her in it. Just then,
Jesse's car pulls up and headlights shine on Celeste half-way
in the trash can. She fumbles and then:
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
Ow!!! Shit!
A piece of glass from the can has sliced her face. She
immediately wiggles out of the trash can, stands it back up
again. She looks for a place to run. It's too late. She picks
up the journal and hides behind the trash cans but Jesse and
Veronica have been watching her whole opera from the car.
Jesse approaches a crouching Celeste.
JESSE
Celeste?
Celeste stands up slowly as if nothing is wrong. She is also
holding Jesse's journal close to her chest.
CELESTE
Hey!
JESSE
What...are you doing?
CELESTE
I just...
She looks around to make an excuse.
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
Um...came over to drop off some of
your stuff.
JESSE
But why were you in the trash can?
CELESTE
I lost something.
68.
JESSE
In the trash can?
CELESTE
My bracelet. It was a whole thing.
It's over now.
Jesse and Veronica just stare at Celeste for a long beat.
JESSE
You've met Veronica, right?
CELESTE
Yes! Hi! Wow, you're so pregnant,
right! I love your sweater.
VERONICA
Oh. Thanks! (beat) Are you
bleeding?
CELESTE
What? Oh (she touches her cheek),
yeah, I guess I am.
VERONICA
Let me get you something for that.
CELESTE
NO. No, don't. It's fine, just a
little cut.
VERONICA
Are you sure? I'm so sorry about
this.
CELESTE
No, I'm sorry. So sorry. Well, I'm
late for things. Have a good
afternight.
VERONICA
You sure you don't want to come in
for a drink?
CELESTE
Nooooo, no. That's very nice but
no. Great to see you guys! Okay.
She starts to walk away with the journal.
JESSE
Is that mine?
69.
CELESTE
Waht? Oh, yeah, that's weird. I
don't know how...here you go.
She laughs nervously and hands him his journal. Celeste
walks to her car.
Celeste listen to her work messages on speakerphone as she
Instant Messenger's with Beth. Celeste writes "I went through
Jesse's trash last night. Oh no." Beth writes back, "I'm
coming to your office right now."
PAUL (V.O.)
Hey. Celeste. It's Paul. The cereal
killer? There's this yoga retreat
in Tulum that I just got an e-mail
about...uh, that's not why I'm
really calling. I just like you.
Call me back if you want to drink
some cold beer with me. 310 864-
2120.
Celeste and Beth eat lunch in the zen garden outside the Pop
Form building. Celeste is picking at the end of her sandwich,
recounting the waking nightmare of last night. The cut on her
face is neatly bandaged.
BETH
You told her you liked her sweater?
What are you, twelve?
CELESTE
It was a disaster. But you should
have seen the sweater. So great.
Beth, am I losing my mind?
BETH
Maybe. No. Please no more trash-
diving. Let's focus on you now.
CELESTE
This guys Paul keeps calling me but
I don't know...
BETH
C, you never know. Just go out with
him. It doesn't have to be
perfect...
70.
CELESTE
I met him at the gym. I'm not
meeting my husband at the gym.
BETH
Just go. Nothing to lose.
CUT TO:
Celeste and Paul exit. He has a huge smile on his face. She
looks like she's in pain.
CELESTE
Why would you take me to a place
where Asian people beat you up?
That was absolute torture.
PAUL
But how do you feel?
Celeste takes a beat to see how she feels.
CELESTE
I feel great, actually.
PAUL
So shut up then.
CELESTE
Where are we going now?
PAUL
Don't try to control me. You need
to let go. In yoga, we call it
vairyaga.
He strikes a reverse triangle yoga pose in the parking lot.
72.
CELESTE
Oh my god, don't, with the yoga.
CUT TO:
Jesse, Skillz and Tucker are taking in a high school
cheerleading practice, drinking tall boys and smoking cigs.
Despite their ragtag appearance, do not be fooled...They are
very loyal and knowledgable supporters.
SKILLZ
Oooh...toe touch basket toss coming
up...degree of difficulty 9.
Gnarly.......nailed it! Way to go,
Becky!!!
Jesse is look at his iPhone. He is looking at "Veronica and
Jesse Baby Registry"
JESSE
What the fuck is a Baby Bjorn?
SKILLZ
It's a very, very tiny Swedish man.
TUCKER
It's a baby carrier that allows
your child to benefit from parental
intimacy without the confinement of
a stroller. Duh.
JESSE
Why do you know that.
TUCKER
Beth. We go to a lot of baby
showers.
SKILLZ
I put a lot of babies in the
ladies.
A parent of a cheerleader looks at trio with disgust. Jesse
is still going through the registry list.
74.
JESSE
Birthing towels, breast pump,
Diaper genie? Fuck, I'm definitely
having a baby. (beat) How's
Celeste?
SKILLZ
She's...oh-kay. I'm fine-tuning her
cannibus levels right now, just
trying to find the right balance.
JESSE
Celeste doesn't smoke pot.
SKILLZ
She does now. She loves it.
Jesse takes this in. Tucker changes the subject.
TUCKER
How's Veronica? She's so sweet.
JESSE
Yeah, less sweet pregnant but it's
probably just hormones.
TUCKER
But are you into it?
JESSE
Yeah, I really like her. She seems
great. For someone that I don't
really know that's having my baby.
"California Love" by Tupac (or whatever song we clear) comes
on and the cheerleaders start a routine.
SKILLZ
MY JAM!
Skillz stands up and starts breaking it down. He's not that
good. Committed though. Jesse and Tucker continue to talk.
TUCKER
Are you scared?
JESSE
A little. Yes.
TUCKER
That's great. You should be. Just
keep saying "yes." I'm really proud
of you.
75.
Skillz looks at his cell phone. He shows Jesse a text from
Celeste that reads, "I need green. Now."
SKILLZ
She's like my top client now.
Pop Form employees file out of a Riley Banks meeting. Riley
approaches Celeste.
RILEY
I really like the logo.
CELESTE
Oh, thank you. Yeah, I think it's
perfect.
RILEY
The I.M. Pei influence is pretty
cool.
CELESTE
Wow, yeah, there is a little of
that happening. I.M. Pei. Huh.
RILEY
Are you mocking me?
CELESTE
No, I'm just impressed that you
know anything about architecture.
RILEY
Why, because I'm a pop star? You
know what your thing is? Contempt
prior to investigation.
CELESTE
I'm sorry?
RILEY
You're convinced you're smarter
than everyone and THAT is your
dark little prison.
77.
CELESTE
Are you...?? How dare you...
Riley smiles at Celeste, turns and leaves.
Celeste cautiously walks up to her front door. Before she can
speak, Jesse does.
JESSE
I started smoking again.
CELESTE
I can see that. That must go well
with your pilates.
Jesse looks sad and confused.
JESSE
I don't know what the rules are and
I'm sure I'm breaking them
but...god, I really miss you.
Celeste tries to digest this.
CELESTE
You want to come in?
CUT TO:
The phone rings. It's early. Celeste, still in her clothes
from the night before, wakes up. Jesse is gone. She fumbles
for the phone.
CELESTE
Yeah.
79.
SCOTT
We have a massive problem on our
hands. I need you in the office.
Now.
Bon Iver's "Skinny Love" plays as Celeste walks slowly
amongst the celebrity impersonators, tourists and drunks on
the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
81.
It is intercut with a montage of Super 8 footage of Celeste
and Jesse in the past: At a seaside house, Jesse is
reluctantly cutting a head off a fish to cook it, Celeste is
repulsed but laughing. Celeste and Jesse cuddle in a sleeping
bag, fighting off the cold. Celeste and Jesse take cover in a
torrential New York City rain. They stand under an awning and
she smiles as she runs her hand through his wet hair. Celeste
is abruptly shaken out of her memories by a giant Chewbacca
hugging her before she has a chance to stop him.
CELESTE
No...okay.
Jesse walks out of the bar. He takes a deep breath and starts
walking. A beat later, Celeste tears out of the bar, walking
quickly after Jesse.
CELESTE
Hey!
Jesse pauses for a moment. He turns.
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
Why did you come to my house last
night?
JESSE
I don't know.
CELESTE
Oh no, I think you do.
JESSE
I made a mistake.
CELESTE
And?
JESSE
I shouldn't have come.
CELESTE
You're a fucking coward.
JESSE
I'm just trying to do the right
thing with Veronica. I'm trying to
change.
CELESTE
Well, you never changed for me.
Jesse pauses.
JESSE
To be honest, you didn't really let
me.
83.
CELESTE
Wow. All I did was wait for you to
grow up! I rooted for you, I
fucking paid for everything, I did
everything for you!
JESSE
Yeah, and I was never your equal.
And you know what? I think you
preferred it that way.
CELESTE
Right. Well, I know my success was
never easy for you.
JESSE
And how do you define success,
Celeste? Because you don't look
very successful right now.
CELESTE
And you are? Pretending to be a
father? Pretending to be an adult?
JESSE
What do you want?
CELESTE
I just want you to admit that
you're wrong!
JESSE
Wrong? Wrong about what? What did
you want me to do? Wait for you to
meet someone first? Is that how you
saw it happening?
Celeste doesn't respond.
JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
I didn't expect to meet someone so
fast, but I did. And I think we
have a chance to be happy together.
I don't want to blow that.
CELESTE
You know what, Jesse? You
definitely will blow it.
Jesse takes a beat. It stings.
JESSE
I feel really sorry for you. You
might be alone forever.
84.
He starts to walk away. Celeste call after him.
CELESTE
Don't ever call me.
JESSE
Don't worry about it.
Jesse walks away.
Skillz and Celeste sit in her backyard and watch the last
scene from "Dirty Dancing." The image is being projected onto
her garden wall. There is no sound. Instead, Bob Marley's
"Kaya" plays over the speakers. Celeste is ripping an
enormous bowl from a four-foot bong. Skillz is on his knees,
bracing the bong, looking at Celeste with admiration. Celeste
watches the movie.
CELESTE
She's so sad.
SKILLZ
Is she? I don't think so.
CELESTE
No, she's sad. I can tell. I went
to dance camp.
We see Jennifer Grey elevated above Patrick Swayze, looking
elated. Celeste exhales a huge billow of smoke.
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
That's the first good thing that's
happened to me in months.
SKILLZ
Shit'll get better.
CELESTE
Will it? You don't know that.
Celeste grabs a handful of Cheetos from an economy-sized bag.
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
How could he do this to me?
SKILLZ
J-Thunder? He's not doing anything
to you. You wanted a divorce.
85.
CELESTE
But I didn't want it like this.
SKILLZ
When we are no longer able to
change a situation, we are
challenged to change ourselves.
CELESTE
Huh?
SKILLZ
Oh. It's Victor Frankl.
CELESTE
Huh.
Skillz gets up.
SKILLZ
I gotta go before Petco closes.
CELESTE
You have a pet?
SKILLZ
No, but I gotta get a toy for this
girl's cat, you know, so she'll
give up the kitty.
CELESTE
Can I come?
SKILLZ
No.
CELESTE
Will you bring me some Panda
Express?
SKILLZ
No.
CELESTE
Do you think the Obamas are really
in love?
SKILLZ
Yes. Enough questions. I'll pick
you up at noon.
CELESTE
Noon?
86.
SKILLZ
Beth and Tucker's pre-wedding BBQ?
CELESTE
Right, right.
SKILLZ
Hey, easy on the herb until then.
That shit is powerful.
CUT TO:
Celeste is sitting alone, wearing sunglasses, and
uncharacteristically colorful clothes that don't match. Like
a crazy lady jumpsuit. She is going to town on a HUGE plate
of food: chicken wings, fries, burger, hot dog, coleslaw, egg
salad and a beer. She attacks it like it's her last meal
ever. She's also trashed. Celeste gets up and heads towards a
group of people talking including, Beth's mom, Beth and a
couple of her girlfriends.
BETH
Hi honey, you remember Eileen
from...
CELESTE
Do you have any more of that ranch
dressing? It's the fucking
booooooomb.
Beth is embarrassed. Celeste gives Beth's mom, CAROL, 60,
very large, a big sloppy hug.
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
Hi Carol! Beth's getting married! I
was married, remember? These guys
are in for a fucking dogfight,
right?
Beth pulls Celeste away.
BETH
Let's get you a soda.
They get to the bar.
CELESTE
Do you guys have any tequila?
BARTENDER
We only have Mimosas and Shandys.
87.
CELESTE
I'll have both please.
Beth pulls Celeste away from the bar and brings her into the
house and plops her down on the couch.
BETH
I'm going to recommend some quiet
time for you right now.
CELESTE
Can I smoke?
BETH
No.
Celeste starts weeping.
CELESTE
I don't want to be alone forever.
BETH
Not forever, honey. Just until you
sober up. You'll be fine.
CELESTE
Okay then, I'll just go to the
other side of the pool. I promise I
won't make you look bad.
CUT TO:
Jesse and Veronica are talking to Beth. In the foreground,
Celeste slowly floats into frame on a raft in the pool,
passed out, face down, sunglasses half off, fully clothed.
Skillz approaches Beth.
BETH
At least she's quiet now.
SKILLZ
I'm gonna get her out of here.
Beth has tons of Barneys New York bags and is trying on
clothes for her rehearsal dinner. Celeste is in the fetal
position, hungover on Beth's bed.
88.
CELESTE
(on the phone) Hey Riley, it's
Celeste. I just want to talk to
you about this "error" in your
logo. I'm so, so sorry, I will fix
this...call me.
BETH
I just think it's corny to wear
white two nights in a row. I want
to rock a pattern, or maybe
something in pastel...
She turns to Celeste in a dress.
BETH (CONT'D) (CONTD)
How's this? C! Wake up! I'm
leaving in an hour and I have to
make a decision now. You owe me.
You humped my grandmother
yesterday.
Celeste is comatose.
BETH (CONT'D) (CONTD)
Oh no, are you okay?
CELESTE
What the fuck does Riley Banks
know.
BETH
Um...nothing. She's a tart.
CELESTE
Yeah dude! She's fucking moderately
talented, blessed with a good face
and has maybe 5 more years left of
stardom. Who is she to tell ME
what...
Celeste looks at her blackberry and realizes she never hung
up on Riley. Oh shit. She hangs up quick and throws the
blackberry across the bed.
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
I never hung up, I never hung up!
Fuck! Do you think she...
Her blackberry rings. It's Riley. She takes a deep breath.
She picks, all casual.
89.
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
Hey Riley, what's up?
RILEY
I need to talk to you. Come to my
house. Now.
CELESTE
Oh boy.
CUT TO:
Celeste is holding a small plate of food. Jesse sidles up to
her.
JESSE
I know this may not the best time
to talk about this...but...at some
point, we will have to talk about
Tucker's dance moves.
INSERT of Tucker dancing on the dance floor. It's
unexplainable. It's shocking how terrible it is.
CELESTE
He is so special. Not as special as
that poem. That those girls did?
JESSE CELESTE
Wow. Wow.
95.
He takes a beat.
JESSE
Your speech was really...beautiful.
Thank you.
CELESTE
I meant it.
JESSE
I know.
CELESTE
You know what else is beautiful?
Celeste picks up a baby gerkin from her plate and starts to
jerk it off, as she and Jesse did earlier and as they have
done many times.
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
Oh god, tug it.
Jesse starts to participate. He dips his finger in the creme
fraiche and puts it on the top of the gerkin.
JESSE
Aw yeah! Fuck!
Jesse and Celeste are in hysterics. Just then, Veronica
arrives.
VERONICA
Jesse?
JESSE
Hey.
Celeste and Jesse stop like two children who just got caught.
VERONICA
What are you doing?
JESSE
What? Nothing. We're just...
He looks at Celeste for cover. She is giddy, wasted and happy
to explain.
CELESTE
Oh, Jesse and I do this thing where
we find the littlest thing that
resembles a penis and we just, you
know...
96.
Celeste and Jesse demonstrate for Veronica. Celeste looks up
and realizes how dumb this must seem.
VERONICA
I don't get it.
Celeste and Jesse stop.
CELESTE
It's stupid.
Veronica is looking at Celete's food.
VERONICA
Oh, the foods out. (to Celeste) See
you on the dance floor? Watch out
for Tucker though.
They leave Celeste, standing alone, smiling. She bites into
the carrot.
Celeste is hiking alone on the phone, energized.
CELESTE
Tweens don't want her anymore. But
the gays do! Ten percent of
Americans are gay, Scott. You're
gay, start thinking gay. Gay Izod.
She could be Lady Gaga by the end
of the year. Huge market.
SCOTT
Wow, you might have just turned the
cock in the butt around.
CELESTE
We WILL make the cock in the butt
work for us. The cock in the butt
will be huge!
Just then, a mom and two small children walk by her, overhear
her dirty mouth and glare at her. She waves at them self-
consciously.

C98 SHOT OF CELESTE, RILEY AND SCOTT AT A T-SHIRT SIGNING AT C98
"A FRIEND OF DOROTHY'S," A GAY STORE IN WEST HOLLYWOOD.
A LITTLE LATER
Celeste and Jesse walk out of the building.
JESSE
So...we're divorced!
They high five. What are you supposed to do when you get
divorced.
CELESTE
We did it.
JESSE
You wanna walk for a couple
minutes?
CELESTE
Sure.
CUT TO:
Celeste and Jesse are now approaching the front of "Urban
Light," the installation from the beginning of the movie.
The street lamps are now illuminated. She takes a seat on a
step. Jesse sits next to her. She refers to the lamps:
CELESTE
These are beautiful.
JESSE
I thought you hated them.
CELESTE
Yeah, well, I've never seen them at
night.
Jesse looks at the lamps and takes them in. He looks pretty
sad.
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
What's up with you? I know we just
got divorced but no one died,
right?
108.
JESSE
I'm just feeling like maybe you
were right. I am a fuck up. I
don't know what I'm doing. My
girlfriend left.
There is a long pause.
CELESTE
What? Veronica? Left where?
JESSE
Left me. She wanted me to tell her
everything was gonna be okay and I
couldn't. I don't know why but I
just...couldn't. She wants to go
back to Brussels.
Another monumental pause. Jesse's eyes start tearing up.
JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
Okay, you can say it now. You were
right, I blew it. Just say it.
CELESTE
Hey...don't do that.
JESSE
Do what?
CELESTE
You are not a loser. You never
were. You took a chance. I admire
that and I believe in you.
JESSE
You do?
CELESTE
I do. And I want to thank you.
JESSE
For what?
CELESTE
For never being the person I wanted
you to be.
JESSE
Oh, you're welcome.
CELESTE
Go get her.
109.
JESSE
But I don't know if everything is
gonna be all right.
CELESTE
Well, who does? Do you love her?
Jesse looks at Celeste.
JESSE
I do.
CELESTE
Then it's worth fighting for.
JESSE
Okay. Okay.
Celeste smiles with tears in her eyes.
CELESTE
God, I finally understand why you
fucking cry all the time. Shit is
emotional.
They share a laugh. Then, they sit in silence for a beat.
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
You deserve to be happy. And I wish
that for you, always.
JESSE
Me too.
CELESTE
So...I guess we were right.
JESSE
Huh?
Celeste makes the "C and J" hand gesture from the high school
photo in the opening montage. Jesse makes it back. They
smile.
JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
I love you.
He kisses her on the lips. For the last time. And then, he's
gone.
CELESTE
I love you too.
110.
Celeste sits awhile and looks up at the sky.
Celeste drives and dials a number on her bluetooth.
CELESTE
Hey. So, you're probably giving
your card to some girl in yoga
right now. But if that doesn't work
out for you...I think I may be
ready. To beat you in Scrabble.
Celeste runs in to pay for gas. She is on her Blackberry.
