Silence.
Gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes
audible.
A LOW ANGLE bounded on one side by a chain-link
fence and on the other by the one-story public school build-
ings.
Spray-can hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha-
dows.
This is a Los Angeles public school in a blue collar
neighborhood.
ANGLE BETWEEN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, where a trash dumpster looms
in a LOW ANGLE, part of the clutter behind the gymnasium.
A CAT enters FRAME.
CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, prowling with
him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows.
CLOSE ON CAT, which freezes, alert, sensing something just
beyond human perception.
A sourceless wind rises, and with it a keening WHINE.
Papers blow across the pavement.
The cat YOWLS and hides under the dumpster.
Windows rattle in their frames.
The WHINE intensifies, accompanied now by a wash of frigid
PURPLE LIGHT.
A CONCUSSION like a thunderclap right over-
head blows in all the windows facing the yard.
C.U. - CAT, its eyes are wide as the glare dies.

SLOW PAN as the sound of stray electrical CRACKLING subsides.
FRAME comes to rest on the figure of a NAKED MAN kneeling,
faced away, in the previously empty yard.
He stands, slowly.
The man is in his late thirties, tall and powerfully built,
moving with graceful precision.
C.U. - MAN, his facial features reiterate the power of his
body and are dominated by the eyes, which are intense, blue
and depthless.
His hair is military short.
This man is the TERMINATOR.
He glances down, taking calm inventory of himself, and
notices that a fine white ash covers his skin.
He brushes
at it unconcernedly as he walks toward the fence, scanning
his surroundings.

CAMERA MOVES UP as Terminator approaches the schoolyard fence
beyond which is an embankment rolling down in darkness to the
cityscape below.
The school is perched at the edge of a pro-
montory offering a respectable view of the urban sprawl teem-

The night clouds are
shot through with occasional flashes of LIGHTNING, presaging
a thunderstorm.
Terminator stands, hands on hips in prefect symmetry, gazing

A beer bottle SMASHES on the ground.

its ex-owner and his two compatriots, YOUTH GANG MEMBERS,
lounging on the jungle gym of a deserted playground.
They

pants, combat boots or high-top sneakers, leather jackets.
The leader notices something and sits up.
LEADER

Hey, hey...what's wrong with
this picture?
ANGLE - REVERSE, seen past the lounging toughs, Terminator
walks naked into a pool of streetlight, striding purpose-
fully toward them.
ANGLE - OVER TERMINATOR'S SHOULDER, as he approaches them.
They slide from their perches and drop easily to the ground
liquid shadows.
LEADER
Nice night for a walk, eh?
Terminator stops right in front of them.
TERMINATOR
(without inflec-

Nice night for a walk.
They surround him, all swagger and malign good humor.
SECOND PUNK

Nothing

Terminator eyes them without expression, unhurried.
Reptilian.
TERMINATOR
Nothing clean.
Right.
LEADER
This guy's a couple bricks

Terminator turn to the second punk, ignoring the
others.
TERMINATOR
Your clothes.
Give them to me.
The punks exchange glances, dismayed.
TERMINATOR
(coldly)
Now.
SECOND PUNK
(bracing)
Fuck you, asshole.
Without warning Terminator hammer-punches him in the temple
with blinding speed.
The blow flings him with a CLANG into
the jungle gym.
He drops to the ground in a still heap,
eyes open, twitching.
The leader whips out his SWITCHBLADE and slashes in one
motion.
Terminator ducks back and catches the knife-
wielder's wrist in an inhuman grip.
Then he punches the
leader with piledriver force just below the breastbone.
ANGLE - PAVEMENT, as the knife clatters down.
The punk's
combat boots are on tiptoe, barely touching the ground.
ANGLE - TWO SHOT, Terminator and the leader are close
together as if dancing, but motionless.
Their bodies are in
total shadow.
The punk's eyes are wide, his veins distended
with an agonizing pressure.
Terminator jerks his fist back
with a WET SOUND and the other drops OUT OF FRAME.
The last tough is stumbling away, gaping with terror.
He
backs into a chainlink fence, turns to run along it, finds
he is in a corner.
Terminator takes a step toward him, his gaze ominous.
The punk begins shakily stripping off his clothes.
Thunder peals overhead.

A light RAIN begins to fall.
Terminator emerges onto the street from the playground,

Another part of the city.
Seedy apartments and storefronts.
The streets glisten, hissing with sporadic late night traffic.
SLOW PAN AND DOLLY into the mouth of a narrow alley lined
with trash containers and fire escapes.
From a recessed
doorway, two filthy legs sprawl out onto the wet pavement.
An angry, inarticulate DRUNKARD'S MONOLOGUE rises occasionally
above the rain sounds.
ANGLE - DOORWAY,
The derelict rouses from his bitter stupor
as a brilliant purple glare lights up the wet brickwork
around him.
A shockwave hurls trash into the air.
Painted over windows shatter.
Rat scurry, blinded.
A FIGURE drops INTO FRAME as if out of the sky and smacks
the pavement with a muddy splash.
C.U. - DERELICT, as he blinks at the fading glare, amazed.
A NAKED MAN, compact and muscular, rises in a defensive
crouch.
KYLE REESE is 22, but his face has been aged by
ordeal, the mouth hard, eyes grim.
A crinkled burn scar
traverses one side of his face from chin to forehead.
Other
scars, from burns and bullets, mar his hard-muscled body.
The rain washes a fine coating of white ash from his skin
as electrical ARCS lace back and forth between the fire
escapes behind him, HISSING and SPUTTERING.
The sound
fades, then stops altogether, to be replaced by a rising
scream of animal agony.
Reese lurches to his feet and sprints across the alley.

CAMERA MOVES WITH REESE as he leaps to the fire escape and
clambers up to the first landing to crouch beside another
NAKED MAN who appears to be entangled in the ironwork.
The
man is contorted with pain as his screams die to a shivering
gasp.
CLOSER ANGLE reveals that he has been skewered through
the abdomen by the horizontal iron slats and through the
shoulder by a railing.
He has materialized in the same
space occupied by the fire escape structure.
The figure
slumps, motionless.
Reese quickly checks for signs of life.
The man is dead.
Reese descend to the alley floor and crosses to the drunk
huddled in the doorway.
A pair of flamboyantly dressed women, obviously working
girls, passes by the alley mouth.
They do a double take
when they see Reese, but walk on without breaking stride,
completely jaded.
He's certainly not a potential customer.
Reese crouches down as if to speak to the drunk.
DERELICT
Say, buddy...did you see a

A brilliant white glare stabs into the alley mouth as an
LAPD cruiser glides slowly by on the street.
The search-

sprawled drunk, just pulling on the other's trousers.
The cruiser chirps to a stop.
The doors fly open and two
cops leap out.
FIRST COP
Hold it, right there!
Reese hitches his pants and bolt like a shot.
The cops
draw their guns and race into the alley after him.

Another unit arrives out front and Reese melts back into
the alley, only to see a cop round the corner behind him.

electronic WHINE.
Incredibly bright searchlights play over
the ground.
PANNING with the moving treads through twisted
wreckage, F.G.
The screen WHITES OUT with a BLAST, very close.
As the
debris clatters down, a helmetted head snaps up into FRAME,

The visor of the HIGH-TECH HELMET is shattered, presumably
by the explosion.
The wearer rips it off, revealing a
younger Reese, minus his burn scar.
His face is bathed in sweat, lit by the glow from a CRT
SCOPE-SIGHT on a strange-looking rifle.
The sound of SCREAMS and HOARSE SHOUTS not far off, and a
continuous low murmuring of RADIO CHATTER, grid coordinates,
casualties, unit placements, medic requests.
Reese looks over his shoulder at his teammate, a GIRL
of about sixteen, gaunt, dirty, heavily armed like himself.
DOLLYING as they start to belly crawl through the bones

Reese looks up.
Through spires of a collapsed building a terrifying
SPHINX-LIKE SHAPE moves against the sky...obscured by dust
and blinding sweeps of its searchlights.
Though we see little, this is an H-K,Hunter-Killer
mobile ground-unit.
Reese crawls, pacing the H-K, under and through, on elbows
and knees, past mounds of charred skulls.
They
pass the BODY OF A CHILD, a boy of about 10, center-
punched with a smoking hole.
The boy clutches a rifle.
More bodies.
Some in rags, some in uniforms like theirs.
WOMEN. OLD MEN. CHILDREN.
They're all dirty and gaunt,
scabrous.
And still bleeding.
Reese scrabbles past a
dark rat-hole and there are human rats in it.
Some of them
are sobbing, or screaming.
Another EXPLOSION.
The GLARE lights the huddled few.
Human vermin with mud-caked weapons that haven't been
invented yet.
Soldiers in a nightmare war.
Reese and his teammate stop behind a blasted wall, having
outflanked the massive H-K.
Its flashing blue lights flick
across the walls, its searchlights sear through the
debris.

Sarah plasters herself tightly into the seat as the
fingers grasp her blouse and pull.
Reese cranks the wheel hard.

The sedan skids, slewing sideways into a parked car.
Terminator rolls down off onto the pavement.
Reese's car shoots forward.
PANNING WITH SEDAN as it roars past Vukovich, the gathering
minions of the burning building, an arriving fire
truck...shoots through a red light and continues to accel-
erate.
Terminator gets to a kneeling position, then slowly stands.
He pats out his smoldering clothing as he watches his quarry
escape.

LOW WIDE ANGLE on the empty street, which is narrow and
tightly lines with parked cars.
The ROAR of an engine builds.
The sedan, like a night-demon, hurtles out of the shadows
with its lights off, doing ninety plus.
CUT TO:
112
113
WIDE ANGLE, CLOSE TO SEDAN, and following it as it hurtles
around a corner in an expertly controlled slide.
Then a high speed sprint down the cross-street.
Reese squirrels the vehicle between a slow-moving car
ahead and oncoming traffic.
A dive into another dark side street.
CUT TO:
114
115
The walls of a narrow alley, inky black, frame a police
cruiser parked on the street beyond.
Firelight from the
back of Stoker's lights the street garishly.
A young cop
stands beside the car talking via radio with
the mike cord pulled through the side window.
He speaks
with a distinctive twang--a displaced southerner.
COP
...I don't know, it looks
like it might spread to this
furniture warehouse across
the alley, the paint on the
wall's starting to blister
up...
The sweeping headlights of a turning car momentarily illuminate
the face of Terminator, motionless in the dark right in
front of us.
Eyes open.
Listening.
COP
(continuing)
Better get another truck
round to this side.
Terminator's silhouette emerges from the blackness and
strides purposefully toward the cop, CAMERA following.
The officer whirls and reaches for his gun but Terminator
flings him brutally into the side of the car, steps over
him and opens the door.
Before getting in he notes the unit number on the roof: 143.
Then he slides behind the wheel, slips the squad car into
gear, and pulls out.
CAMERA PRECEDING CAR, HIDE WIDE ANGLE, as it accelerates
rapidly, until the lines across the street are flashing
under it in a staccato rhythm.

Reese has the hammer down.
He handles the

Below, Reese's sedan snakes along at 110 plus.
The

The helicopter is right above the, its spotlight burning
on Reese.
The cruiser flanks them, closing.
Reese peels
off to the right, inches in front of a tractor-trailer rig,
brakes hard and slides into a four-wheel drift through a
curving off-ramp.
The helicopter banks, following.
The cruiser swaps ends trying to maneuver and slams broad-
side into the guardrail.
Out of action.

The sedan roars across the street without slowing
and vanishes down a tree-lined side street.

It hovers indecisively, then banks off.
PILOT (V.O.)

LOW ANGLE DOLLY, MOVING WITH REESE AND SARAH as they crawl
behind a row of parked cars.
He has firm hold of her arm but she seems to be cooperating.
In the B.G., the chopper hovers, on the far side of the lot.
Reese approaches the door of a late model brown Buick which
has been left with its window partway down.
He unlocks it and they slip inside.

Reese uses the butt of the shotgun to smash loose the
ignition assembly.
He begins working on the wires.
A
police cruiser appears, moving slowly between the rows of
cars.
Reese grabs Sarah and pulls her down to huddle below dash
level.
A moment later a spotlight flashes across the seats
above them.
They hear the helicopter circling closer.
SARAH
Reese...why me?
Why does
it want me?
They are lying very close, a forced intimacy.
Reese's voice
is an urgent whisper, almost in her ear.
A cruiser passes
so close they can hear its radio clearly.
REESE
There's so much...
SARAH
Tell me.
Just start at the
beginning.
Reese musters his thoughts.
And starts.
REESE
There was a war.
A few years
from now.
Nuclear war.
The
whole thing.
All this--
His gesture includes the car, the city, the world.
REESE
(continuing)
--everythingis gone.
Just
gone.
There were survivors.
Here.
There.
Nobody knew who
started it.
(pause)
It was the machines.
SARAH
I don't understand...
REESE
Defense network computer. New.
Powerful.
Hooked into everything.
Trusted to run it all.
They say it
got smart...a new order of intelli-
gence.
Then it saw all people as
a threat, not just the ones on the
other side.
Decided out fate in a
microsecond...extermination.
Reese pauses, and when he continues it's less like a military
briefing, quieter.
REESE
(continuing)
Didn't see the war.
I was born
after, in the ruins.
Grew up
there.
Starving.
Hiding from
the H-K's.
SARAH
The what?
REESE
Hunter Killers.
Patrol machines.
Build in automated factories.
Most of us were rounded up, put in
camps...for orderly disposal.
He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket and shows
her a ten digit number etches on the skin of his forearm.
Beneath the numbers is a pattern of lines like the auto-
matic-pricing marks on product packages.
REESE
(continuing)
Burned in by laser scan.
(pause)
Some of us were kept alive...
to work.
Loading bodies.
The
disposal units ran night and day.
We were that close to going out
forever...
The helicopter moves overhead.
Its searchlight illum-
inates the car interior, moves on.
Before the rotor
sound fads, Reese starts the car.
CUT TO:
135

Several black-and-whites are moving among the parked
cars, slowly.
ANGLE ON TERMINATOR'S CRUISER rolling along just above
idle.
He peers into the row of cars, listening and
seeing on level we can't.

The brown Buick is F.G. as the nose of Terminator's cruiser
appears behind it, moving slowly.
C.U. - TERMINATOR, scanning.
LOW ANGLE, past the back of the Buick, as Terminator
cruises by.
The tailpipe, F.G., puffs quietly.
Terminator's head snaps around.
His eyes lock on Reese's car.
He reaches for his shotgun.

Reese's car launches forward from its space, tires
spinning as Terminator fires from the window of the
cruiser.
CUT TO:
140
141
Reese and Terminator race along opposite sides of a
row of cars, approaching the exit.
The cruiser pulls ahead and closes diagonally as they
clear the last car.
Reese sees the other's shotgun leveled.
He ducks, steering blind, keeps it floored.
The windshield and side window EXPLODES INWARD.
The Buick slams into the black-and-white, spinning it into
a parked truck.
TIRES SCREAM as the two cars slew around
heading for the exit.
SEVERAL ANGLES, as the police react.
The chopper banks tight and dives across the tops of
the parked cars.
Cruisers race to converge.

LOW WIDE ANGLE, PRECEDING REESE'S BUICK as it hits the
street, accelerating.
Terminator's cruiser slides out
behind it, fishtails, races forward.
Engines roar as the cars go flat out.
Buildings lining
the street become a blur.
The chopper arcs in behind them.
Legitimate police, lights blazing, enter the pursuit
one by one.
LOW ANGLE, MOVING WITH TERMINATOR'S CAR as Reese dodges
across all lanes ahead of it.
Terminator gaining.
They run an intersection at a hundred plus.
CUT TO:

MOVING WITH THE BUICK, looking back, as Reese aims the
shotgun, buffeted by the windstream.
Terminator's car, B.G., overtakes rapidly.
SARAH

Past Terminator, F.G., his shotgun aimed as he comes along
side...at Reese.
They are staring down each other's barrels.
CUT TO:

MOVING WITH BOTH CARS as the Buick skids with rear tires
locked.
Reese and Terminator FIRE simultaneously.
TIGHT ON REESE as the doorpost next to his shoulder is
torn out by the other's blast.
ON TERMINATOR, leaning to see around his shattered wind-
shield.
Too late.
He hurtles into the intersection, past the skidding Buick.
Clips the back of the semi.
Spins radically.
Vaults the curb in a screeching front-end roll.
WHIP-PANNING WITH THE CRUISER as it crashes upside-down
through the counter area of an A & W.
LOW ANGLE as Reese and Sarah slide to a stop in a cloud
of tire smoke.
Transmission fluid pours out of the car like blood.
An instant later they are surrounded by an assortment of
LAPD, SHERIFF'S DEPT., and CHP CARS.
The helicopter hovers overhead.
MEDIUM ON SARAH AND REESE, he raises his hands, through
the side window, in plain sight. A phalanx of cops, guns
drawn, approaches the car warily.
Sarah looks at Reese.
Then at the cops.
She opens the door
and runs, staggering, toward them.
Vukovich steps forward
and pulls her away to safety.
C.U. - REESE watching her go as a cop eases his door open.
CUT TO:
150

Two cops approach the overturned squad car jammed into the
wreckage of the small building.
They shine their flashlights inside.
It is empty.
The cyborg has VANISHED.
A sign which reads 'DRIVE IN' detaches from an awning and
crashed down across the crushed auto.
CUT TO:
151
179
FAST PANAGLIDE PRECEDING TERMINATOR as he runs through
the smoky rooms.
A fire is burning, lighting everything
a flickering orange.
He emerges onto a landing through a side entrance.
PAN
to follow his line of sight as he snaps the AR-180 to
his shoulder.
B.G. a BLUE VOLKSWAGEN RABBIT is roaring
away across the parking lot.
TIGHT ON TERMINATOR aiming carefully.
He pulls the trigger.
It clicks...empty.
Slowly he lowers the scope-sight from
his eye and watches them go.
Terminator limps down the steps from the landing and walks
away as the fire spreads behind the windows of Division
Headquarters.
CUT TO:
180
181
The Rabbit is stopped on the shoulder of a two lane
secondary road winding through the hills north of L.A.
Reese is fishing objects out of the car's trunk and
handing them to Sarah, who holds a flashlight.
He hands her a blanket, some road flares, and a first
aid kit.
Then he slams the trunk.
Reaching through the
side window, he turns the wheel and pushes the car off
the shoulder, over the embankment.
DOWN ANGLE INTO RAVINE, past Sarah and Reese, as the car
trundles down crashing through the underbrush to dis-
appear among the trees.
Reese looks out across the valley and the lights of L.A.
A helicopter circles in the distance, searchlight on.
REESE
Let's get off the road.
CUT TO:
182
182
ANGLE LOOKING OUT from the mouth of an enclosed concrete
storm drain that passes under the road.
Reese, followed
by Sarah, trudges down the slope and ducks inside.
The floor is wet but he doesn't seem to mind.
They both hunker down with their backs to the concrete,
facing each other.
They look beaten, grimy, exhausted.
She huddles under the blanket, waif-like.
REESE
You cold?
SARAH
Freezing.
REESE
Come here.
She sits beside him and they wrap their arms around each
other with the blanket covering both of them.
SARAH
Reese...you got a first name?
REESE
Kyle.
SARAH
Kyle, what's it like when you
go through time?
REESE
White light.
Pain.
Like
being ripped inside out...
slowly.
Like being born,
maybe.
Sarah scowls and draws her hand out from under his jacket.
SARAH
You're wet.
Oh my god.
In the beam of the flashlight her hand is glistening
with blood.
REESE
I caught one, back there.
SARAH
(incredulous)
Caught one?
You mean you
got shot?
Reese shrugs.
REESE
It's not bad.
Sarah sits up and turns toward him.
SARAH
We gotta get you to a doctor.
REESE
It's okay.
Forget it.
SARAH
Forget it?
Are you crazy?
Let me see it.
Sarah opens his jacket and the flashlight beam shows his
shirt bloodsoaked at the shoulder.
SARAH
(continuing)
Jeez.
You idiot.
Take
this off.
She cradles the flashlight between her knees and opens
the first aid kit as he removes his jacket.
REESE
(looking at the
wound)
See.
Missed everything.
Passed through the meat.
Sarah starts swabbing the flesh wound.
SARAH
This is gonna make me puke.
Talk about something.
REESE
What?
SARAH
Just talk.
Tell me about
my son.
Is he tall?
She places a gauze pad in place and starts to wrap it.
REESE
About my height.
He
has your--
(winces)
...damn...he has your
eyes.
Sarah glances at his face for a second and then goes back
to work.
SARAH
What's he like?
REESE
(thoughtful)
You trust him.
He's got that
strength.
You'd die in a
second for John.
SARAH
Well, at least I know what
to name him.
I don't suppose
you'd know who the father is?
So I don't tell him to get
lost when I meet him.
REESE
John never said much about
him.
He dies.
Even before
the war...
SARAH
(interrupting)
Stop!
I don't want to know.
Hold still.
So...it was John
that ordered you here?
REESE
I volunteered.
SARAH
You volunteered?
REESE
It was an honor.
A chance
to meet the legend.
Sarah
Connor.
Who taught her son
to fight...organize, prepare.
From when he was a kid.
When
you were in hiding, before
the war.
She stops taping.
She seems lost, her bravado dissipated.
SARAH
You talk about things I haven't
done yet in the past tense.
It's
making me crazy.
I can't think.
(pause)
Are you sure you've got the
right person?
Reese appraises her coldly.
REESE
I'm sure.
SARAH
Come on, me? The mother
of the future?
Am I tough?
Organized?
I can't even balance
my checkbook.
I cry when I see
a cat that's been run over...
and I don't even like cats.
She pulls the bandage tight with a knot.
REESE
Ow!
No, it's okay.
It's
better tight.
SARAH
And anyway, what do I know
about guerrilla warfare?
REESE
You'll learn.
SARAH
(angry)
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for
this honor and I don't want it.
Any of it.
REESE
John gave me a message for
you.
Made me memorize it.
'Sarah"...this is the message...
'Sarah, thank you.
For your
courage through the dark years.
I can't help you with what you
must soon face, except to tell
you that the future is not set...
there is no such thing as Fate,
but what we make for ourselves
by our own will.
You must be
stronger than you imagine you
can be.
You must survive, or I
will never exist.'
That's all.
Sarah stares at him as the enormity of it all becomes real
to her.
Reese moves his arm, testing the bandage.
REESE
(continuing)
Good field-dressing.
SARAH
(brightening)
You like it?
It's my first.
He rebuttons his shirt and they return to the warmth-
conserving embrace.
Sarah gazes out the entrance, into
the night.
REESE
Sleep.
It'll be light soon.
SARAH
(closing her
eyes)
Okay.
Talk some more.
REESE
About what?
SARAH
(murmuring)
About where you're from.
Kyle watches the helicopter circling far in the distance.
REESE
Alright.
(pause)
You stay down by day, but at
night you can move around.
The H-K's use infra-red so you
still have to watch out.
But they're not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them
them.
That's when the infiltra-
tors started to appear.
The
Terminators were the newest,
the worst...
During his monologue we have PANNED into the darkness outside
and to the helicopter, which flies OUT OF FRAME, leaving
black.
A ROTOR ROAR fades up.
CUT IN BLACK TO:
183/FX
183/FX
Black sky.
Stars.
With a roar an AERIAL PATROL CRAFT enters close overhead.
It has flashing red and blue lights and powerful search-
lights which stab down.
TILT DOWN
to a vista of moonlit devastation.
White ash blows in drifts among fire-gutted ruins.
Blackened bones lie everywhere in heaps.
Searchlights sweep the night.
Another aerial unit hovers several blocks away, firing
tracers into the ruins.
CUT TO:
184/FX
184/FX
LOW ANGLE
as a gleaming chrome H-K grinds through the debris of the
shattered street on its tank-like tracks, crushing burnt
skulls.
Its head turns slowly, playing high-intensity lights over the
buildings.
Its hydraulic arms are folded, mantis-like, against its
'torso'.
After it passes a number of human figures dart
from shadow to shadow, B.G.
CUT TO:

Sarah catches up to him just as he is about to try and
stop an approaching car.
She pulls his gun hand down with
both of hers.
SARAH
Put that away.
I'll get one.
She hold out her thumb to passing traffic.
Reese watches this incomprehensible ceremony skeptically.
SARAH
(continuing)
This works...really.
CUT TO:
189A
189A
Reese and Sarah are crammed into the cab of a beat-to-hell
PICKUP TRUCK with the DRIVER, obviously a surfer.
Laid-
back, long-haired and well-tanned.
Reese glowers and watches the scenery through slitted eyes.
DRIVER
...and when it breaks right
off the point they get some
pretty rad tubes up there.
Not awesome, but I mean, worth
the drive, if you're hardcore
like me.
REESE
(to Sarah)
Rad tubes?
SARAH
(to Reese)
He's a surfer.
DRIVER
You from back East of
something?
SARAH
No, he's from the future.
DRIVER
Whoah.
I hear that.
(pause)
Listen, I had a rough
night.
I gotta stop and
bag some Z's.
They pull off the highway toward a gas station/rest area.
CUT TO:
190
190
The gas station is like an oasis of clutter in a rolling
stretch of meadows and woods.
It consists of a bunker-
like building with restrooms and a flanking PICNIC AREA,
beyond which are WOODS.
People sit under the trees, enjoying the beautiful day
while children tear around after the forced inactivity of
a long trip.
The three of them get out on unsteady legs.
DRIVER
You can still ride if
you wanna hang out for a
couple hours.
SARAH
Thanks.
REESE
Bag some Z's?
SARAH
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
She heads for the WOMEN'S RESTROOM and Kyle follows her
inside.
REESE
(pushing him out)
Yours is over there.
Instead of following her directions to the Men's Room,
Kyle wanders toward the drinking fountain.
A bunch of
kids are running around and throwing water at each other
with paper cups.
Reese shambles through them like a zombie.
He stands among the children, an alien in this land without
fear.
He watches people at picnic tables laughing and
listening to portable music.
Kids squeal.
Dogs bark.
LITTLE GIRL (V.O.)
Can you get my balloon?
DOWN ANGLE on an achingly beautiful LITTLE GIRL of about
four.
She points above his head.
Reese looks up to see a helium-filled mylar balloon stuck in
the foliage of a tree just above him.
He pulls it down by
the string and holds it, turning it over dully.
He crouches down to her eye-level.
She smiles.
REESE
Aren't you afraid to be out in
the open like this?
LITTLE GIRL
Huh?
Reese whirls reflexively at a SCREAM behind him.
The
mylar balloon bursts in his tense hands.
A teenage girl
is being doused with water by the boys with plastic jugs.
The little girl looks at the broken balloon, then glares
at Reese.
She punches him soundly on the shoulder and
storms off.
At this moment she is bowled over by an IRISH SETTER that
licks her face while she shrieks with laughter.
Reese seems about to smile but doesn't quite know how to
go about it.
CUT TO:
191

Sarah is talking on an open pay phone.
SARAH
...I know, Mom.
This is the
soonest I could...I know.
Mom...Mom, I can't talk long.
No, I'm okay.
(pause)
I was on TV?
Really?
(pause)
Oh no, I hate that picture...
why didn't you give them my
graduation picture?
(pause)
I'm okay, really.
Listen, I
want you to pack some stuff
and go up to the cabin for a
few days.
Just don't...no,
don't ask any questions.
Just do it.
I gotta get
going...gotta go.
Bye, bye.
Sarah has been idly leafing through the DIRECTORY.
On
a whim she looks up something.
She freezes for a moment when she finds the listing.
Then with a triumphant expression she rips the page out
of the book.
CUT TO:
192
192
Sarah is sitting at a table under a tree, lettering
something with a lipstick on a cardboard box-flap.
E.C.U. - SIGN, as the last letters are finished.
It reads:
SILICON VALLEY
FULL ON SARAH as she retracts the lipstick and leans
across to hand it to a girl at the next table.
SARAH
Thanks a lot.
REESE (V.O.)
What's that?
Sarah looks up, startled to see him standing beside her.
SARAH
That's where we're going.
REESE
Why?
Sarah point to the directory page lying on the table.
MACRO - PAGE
Sarah's finger points to a listing which reads:
CYBER DYNAMICS CORPORATION
18144 El Camino Real, S'Vale
ANGLE ON SARAH AND REESE
She looks smug.
SARAH
Look.
I found it.
Isn't
that it?
Cyber Dynamics
Corporation?
REESE
What about it?
SARAH
Didn't you say that they're
going to develop this
revolutionary new thing...
REESE
Molecular-memory.
SARAH
Whatever...they become the
hotshot computer guys so they
get the job to build El Computer
Grande...Skynet...for the
government.
Right?
REESE
(uneasy)
That's the way it was told
to me.
Sarah's fear has been replaced by excitement.
SARAH
Well, we're gonna uninvent the
bastard.
Eighty-six it.
We'll
blow up the place...burn it
down.
Something.
REESE
(very cold)
Tactically dangerous.
We
lay low.
SARAH
Reese.
Think it through.
We can prevent the war.
Nobody else is gonna do it.
If we go to anybody official
we wind up back in jail and
then that walking cuisinart
has got us again.
We have to
so it ourselves.
REESE
That's not my mission.
SARAH
(upset, mocking
his manner)
Listen.
Understand.
I'm
not a military objective,
Reese.
I'm a person...
You don't own me.
Reese takes her arm and pulls her to her feet.
REESE
Let's go.
Time to move out.
SARAH
Fuck you!
Let go of me!
She jerks her arm free.
He reaches for her again but
she outdistances him, running.
REESE
(warning tone)
Sarah!
She dashes down a footpath among the trees, clutching her
sign.
Reese follows her into the woods.
CUT TO:

Only a few yards from the picnic area, the woods take over
completely.
PANNING WITH SARAH
as she runs down the path.
Reese tackles her from behind and they fall together in
the long spring grass.
She struggles violently to get away.
SARAH
Let...go...bastard...
She gets one arm free and whacks him hard in the face.
Reese reacts instinctively, leaping back in a defensive
crouch.
Sarah freezes when she sees the .357 in his
hand.
SARAH
(continuing,
scared, but
angry)
Oh, that's real smart.
Go on, shoot me. That's
brilliant.
Reese is trembling as he lowers the gun.
Sarah too is shaking with emotion.
Tears roll down her
cheeks and her voice cracks.
SARAH
(continuing)
Jesus Christ, Reese.
Can't
you see I'm scared?
He straightens up and his arms go limp at his sides.
He turns away.
SARAH
(continuing)
I can't spend my life waiting
for that thing to catch up
with me...always looking over
my shoulder, wondering if I
left some tiny clue behind...
Reese doesn't respond.
The gun slips from his fingers.
His will seems to drain from him and he sags to his knees.
The moment stretches.
There is only the sunlight moving in shafts through the
leaves, the sound of a small stream nearby, birds chirping.
SARAH
Reese?
She crawls over to him.

in profile, with Sarah in B.G.
His eyes are closed.
A tear meanders down his cheek.
SARAH
(continuing,
quietly)
Kyle?
REESE
(a whisper)
I'm wrong here.
I wasn't
meant to see this...
He gestures at their surroundings.
REESE
(continuing)
It's...like some dream.
This...this...
He touches the grass, the trunk of a tree.
REESE
(continuing)
...and you...all so...beauti-
ful.
It hurts, Sarah.
More
than death.
He looks are her beseechingly.
REESE
(continuing)
Don't you understand...it's
all gone!
Sarah puts her arm around him.
She sniffs and wipes at her nose with the back of her hand.
SARAH
We can change it, Kyle.
We
have to try.
She takes his shoulder in her hands.
SARAH
(continuing)
There's no fate but what we
make for ourselves. Right?
Come on.
Let's go, kiddo.
Whaddya say?
He picks up her sign and they look at each other for a
second, then get up.

M.C.U. - TERMINATOR, the last flakes of flesh are falling
from him like burning leaves.
His gleaming structure is
revealed in all its intricacy.
No longer a 'He', but an 'It'.
It looks like Death rendered in steel.
A CHROME SKELETON with HYDRAULIC MUSCLES and TENDONS OF
FLEXIBLE CABLE.
In the sockets of the metal skull, the
eyeball swivels with a WHIR of tiny servos, both glowing
red now.
It turns slowly and fixes its gaze directly INTO CAMERA.

MACRO ON CASSETTE RECORDER, the center capstans of a
tape turning.
SARAH (V.O.)
...and the hardest thing is
deciding what I should tell
you and what not to.
Well,
anyway, I've got a while yet
before you're old enough to
understand the tapes.
They're
more for me at this point...
to help get it all straight.
COVER SHOT reveals Sarah as the wheel of a dusty landrover
parked at the pump island of a tiny gas station.
All of
its signs are in hand-lettered Spanish.
Beyond lies an
expanse of scrub desert.
The sky scowls with an impending
storm.
Sarah speaks quietly into a hand microphone as a dark-
complected attendant laconically fills her tank.
She
cradles the cassette recorder in her lap, in the lee of
her SWOLLEN BELLY.
She looks to be about SIX MONTHS ALONG.
Under her down vest she wears a leather shoulder holster
and the butt of a .357 REVOLVER presses against her
breast.
She tugs the vest closed as the attendant glances
her way.
A German Shepherd sits in the back among taped
boxes and suitcases.
SARAH
(continuing)
Should I tell you about your
father?
That's a tough one.
Will it change your decision
to send him here...knowing?
But if you don't send Kyle,
you could never be.
God,
you can go crazy thinking
about all this...I suppose
I'll tell you...I owe him that.
And maybe it'll be enough if
you know that in the few hours
we had together we loved a
lifetime's worth...
CLICK.
WHIR.
Sarah jumps at a sound nearby, breaking
her reverie.
A small MEXICAN BOY has snapped her picture
with a beat-up Polaroid camera.
He holds it out to her,
speaking rapid Spanish.
ATTENDANT
He says you are very beautiful,
Senora, and he is ashamed to ask
five American dollars for this
picture, but if he does not,
his father will beat him.
SARAH
That's a pretty good hustle,
kid.
Four.
Quatro.
The boy takes her four dollars and she watches the
snapshot develop.
It is a good photograph of her,
the wind lightly ruffling her hair, expression thought-
ful, slightly sad.
We recognize it as the one Reese carried in 2029.
She slips it into her short pocket.
ATTENDANT
Mil trescientos...fifteen dollars
American.
As she pays him, distant thunder rolls.
The boy yells something in Spanish as he runs off.
SARAH
What did he say?
ATTENDANT
(accented)
There is a storm coming in.
Sarah gazes at the thunderheads building up out over the
desert.
Heat lightning pulses in their depths.
SARAH
(quietly)
I know.
CAMERA CRANES UP as she pulls away, driving across the
flat desert on a ribbon of highway.
A brilliant flash
crescendos from horizon to horizon out at the rim of the
world.
