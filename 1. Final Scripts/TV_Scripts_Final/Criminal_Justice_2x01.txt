          CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     1.


      1INT. ROSE HOUSE. BEDROOM - DAY 1 (14.21H)1/11/1

      JULIET MILLER sitting on a single bed, legs over the side, 
      feet on the floor. Her shoes are off and her cardigan and a 
      jacket are on the back of a chair. The bed has a sheet and no 
      other bed covers. She rubs her eyebrow with her finger. A 
      part of her eyebrow has been worn away.   

      INT. CROWN COURT. COURT - DAY 1 (14.22H)1/21/2

    JOE MILLER in the closing moments of a jury speech. He is 
      forty years old and right at the top of his game; good 
      looking in a manly Gregory Peck kind of a way. A hero in a 
      wig. 

                                  JOE
                    What kind of a murder is this? What 
                    is the character of this killing? 
                    Vicious; brutal; frenzied - the 
                    victim fought hard to save himself 
                    and it took nineteen separate stab 
                    wounds to extinguish his life...
                    But none of these things are what 
                    make this murder so shocking. For 
                    that we have to look at motive. 

    He looks down at the floor, gathering himself.

                                  JOE (CONT D)
                    Why did this man die?
                    Because of the colourof his skin.  

    JOE struggling to control his emotions. A long pause. 

                                  JOE (CONT D)
                    We're not supposed to bring the 
                    personal into court. That's why we 
                    wear these.

    He takes his wig off and stares at it. The Judge, HHJWANDA  
      BLACKSTONE, wants to intervene here but doesn't.

                                  JOE (CONT D)
                    Wigs make all us barristers alike - 
                    anonymous and impartial before the 
                    law. It's just that sometimes it's 
                    really very difficult to be 
                      dispassionate.  

    He puts his wig back on. 









                                                                            (CONTINUED)          CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     2.
        CONTINUED:1/21/2

                                  JOE (CONT D)
                    But. We would all of us be failing 
                    in our duty to uphold the values 
                    that this horrific crime seeks to 
                    undermine, if we allow prejudice 
                    and emotion to get in the way of 
                    good, clear analysis of the facts. 
                    So go back to your jury room, put 
                    aside your feelings and examine the 
                    evidence. And when you do I know 
                    you'll bring back the only possible 
                    verdict: 

    JOE turns from the jury and looks directly at PAUL CULLEN, 
    the defendant in the dock. It's a brilliant gesture which 
      says: I've got your measure, I'm not frightened of you and I 
      know you did this. 

                                  JOE (CONT D)
                    Guilty as charged.

    JOE sits. The JURY are very moved by what he has said.

      INT. ROSE HOUSE. BEDROOM - DAY 1 (14.24H)1/31/3

      JULIET sitting on the bed. A door in the house closes. She 
      stands up quickly. She puts her shoes on. She fumbles with 
    her cardigan - the sleeve of her cardigan gets caught on her 
      watch strap and she can't get it unhooked so she takes off 
    the watch and then works it free from the sleeve. She looks 
    at the time. Now she is more panicked. She stuffs her watch 
      into the pocket of her jacket and rushes out of the room.

      INT. CROWN COURT. ROBING ROOM - DAY 1 (14.25H)1/41/4

    JOE sitting and turning his wig in his hands. The agonizing 
      wait for a verdict. JOE has his gown still on. Across the 
      room, DEFENCE COUNSEL and two other JUNIOR BARRISTERS are 
      relaxed, chatting and reading newspapers. JOE is too caught 
    up with thinking about the pending verdict to be a part of 
      this. He stands and goes to the window. 

      INT. ROSE HOUSE. HALLWAY - DAY 1 (14.26H)1/51/5

      JULIET comes downstairs and hurries down the hall towards the 
      front door. A door into the sitting room is open. DOMINIC 
      ROSE in a chair. He's been waiting for her to come down. This 
    is his house. He stands up when JULIET pauses at the open 
      door. 

                                  DOMINIC
                    Juliet...

    He takes a step towards her. She lowers her head.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)          CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     3.
        CONTINUED:1/51/5

                                  JULIET
                    No. Please.

      EXT./INT. STREET. CAR - DAY 1 (14.29H)1/61/6

      JULIET shuts the car door. She looks about her. She looks in 
    the rearview mirror. Furtive. She doesn't want to be seen 
      here. She turns the key in the ignition. Toscaon the stereo 
    big and loud. It makes her jump. She turns the volume down. 
    She drives a little way down the street and then remembers 
      something. She parks the car badly. 

      INT. CROWN COURT. ROBING ROOM - DAY 1 (14.30H)1/71/7

    JOE drumming his fingers against the side of his head.

                                  TANNOY
                    Will all parties in Cullen please 
                    return to court one. 

    JOE blows out his cheeks and stands up.

    NO SCENE 81/81/8

    NO SCENE 91/91/9

      EXT. ROSE HOUSE - DAY 1 (14.31H)1/101/10

      JULIET rings the doorbell. Then, immediately, she rings it 
      again. She glances over her shoulder. The door opens. DOMINIC 
    is there holding the scarf she left behind. He gives her a 
      hug. She wants this and she doesn't want this. She fights 
      back tears. She pulls away from him and looks about her. 

      INT. CROWN COURT. COURT ROOM - DAY 1 (14.32H)1/111/11

    JOE rolling a pencil between thumb and finger and watching 
    the JURY file in, trying to work out which way it's gone. 

                                  COURT CLERK
                    Will the foreman please stand.

      FOREMAN stands. JOE looks down at his hands twiddling the 
      pencil under the bench.

                                  COURT CLERK (CONT'D)
                    Have you reached a verdict upon 
                    which all of you are agreed?

                                  FOREMAN
                    Yes.

    JOE stops rolling the pencil. He is very still.






                                                                            (CONTINUED)          CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     4.
      CONTINUED:1/111/11

                                  COURT CLERK
                    On count one do you find the 
                    defendant guilty or not guilty of 
                    murder?

                                  FOREMAN
                    Guilty.

    JOE puts the pencil down very carefully on the bench in front 
    of him and breathes out. He tries and fails to disguise how 
      pleased he is. PAUL CULLEN in the dock, a face full of hate, 
      yells at JOE.

                                  CULLEN
                    I'm coming for you, youbastard.

      INT. CROWN COURT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE COURT - DAY 1 (14.40H)1/141/14

    JOE being congratulated by CPS LAWYERS and POLICE OFFICERS. 
    The MOTHER of the victim, a woman slowed down by grief, 
      approaches. People make space for her. She takes hold of both 
      Joe's hands. She looks into his eyes and keeps a hold of his 
      hands and through her tears we know that she is very 
      grateful. 

      INT. CROWN COURT. CORRIDOR - DAY 1 (14.41H)1/151/15

    JOE walking with his mobile to his ear. There is no answer to 
    the call he is making. 

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY 1 (14.42H)1/161/16

    The phone ringing. From the top of the house, the sound of 
      Ella Fitzgerald singing Every Time We Say Goodbye. 

      INT. CROWN COURT. CORRIDOR - DAY 1 (14.43H)1/171/17

    JOE slows his walk. He wants this call answered. The answer 
      machine kicks in. His own voice. "This is the Miller house. 
      Sorry we're not here to..." He ends the call. A flicker of 
      worry.   

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY 1 (14.44H)1/181/18

    The empty kitchen. Ella Fitzgerald singing upstairs.

    NO SCENE 191/191/19

      INT. CROWN COURT. ROBING ROOM - DAY 1 (15.02H)1/201/20

    JOE in front of a long bench with a long horizontal mirror 
      above it. A busy robing room. BARRISTERS getting changed. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     5.
      CONTINUED:1/201/20

    JOE pulls off his gown, rolls it up and puts it into his blue 
      velvet bag. The blue bag has a name and chambers address 
      label sewn onto the inside near the top. JOE takes his wig 
    off and shakes some talcum powder into it before putting it 
      into its wig box. He takes a satsuma from an old leather 
      briefcase and peels it. He takes his shoes off. He puts the 
      satsuma peel inside the shoes.

    JOE pulls his shirt off and straps a heart monitor across his 
      chest. He takes his trousers off. He is wearing running 
      shorts underneath. He takes a pot of vaselinefrom his bag 
    and applies a dollop to each nipple and to his groin area. He 
      puts on running shoes and running top and packs his suit and 
      shoes into his old briefcase. He is good at this - the 
      folding, the packing. He goes, carrying bags and his brief. 

      INT. CROWN COURT. OUTSIDE LIFTS - DAY 1 (15.04H)1/211/21

    JOE puts his bags and brief down and dials home again.

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. BEDROOM - DAY 1 (15.05H)1/221/22

    The phone by the double bed ringing. The camera moves out of 
    the bedroom and onto the landing outside where there is a  
      door to an enclosed staircase leading up to the loft. The 
      singing again. Every Time We Say Goodbye. And then the sound 
    of two girls voices singing along with Ella Fitzgerald.  

      INT. CROWN COURT. OUTSIDE LIFT - DAY 1 (15.06H)1/231/23

    JOE on his phone. He is pacing. Anxious now.

      EXT. MILLER HOUSE - DAY 1 (15.07H)1/241/24

      JULIET coming up the path. She can hear the phone ringing. 
    She fiddles with her door keys. She badly wants to get the 
      call. Her keys are in a muddle. She finds the right key. 

      INT. CROWN COURT. OUTSIDE LIFT - DAY 1 (15.08H)1/251/25

    JOE on the phone. The answer machine kicks in. Worried now. 
    The lift arrives. 

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY 1 (15.09H)1/261/26

      JULIET rushes in and grabs the phone.

                                    JULIET
                    Hello?

      Gone. She's missed it. She looks almost frightened. 

      INT. CROWN COURT - DAY 1 (15.10H)1/271/27

      ANNA KLEIN, in her late thirties, walks along towards the 
      lift, carrying bag. JOE joins her and walks with her.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     6.

                    Hey, Joe.

                                  JOE
                    Anna. 

                                  JOE (CONT'D)
                    What are you here for?

                                  ANNA
                    Just been convicted of feeling up a 
                    fourteen year old on a bus. It's my 
                    first time, completely out the 
                    blue, I'm forty two years old and 
                    I've lost my family and my job. 
                    What do you think?

                                  JOE
                    Who's your judge?

                                  ANNA
                    Felix Crane.

    JOE smiles. 

                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                    What? 

    JOE shrugs.

                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                    What's funny?

                                  JOE
                    He hates sex. 

                                  ANNA
                    So what do you think?

                                  JOE 
                    Three. 

                                  ANNA

                                  JOE
                    On a fight... maybe four. 

    JOE heads down the stairs. 

      EXT. CROWN COURT - DAY 1 (15.12H)1/281/28

    JOE comes out. JOHN, Joe's junior clerk, waiting for him with 
      a porter's trolley. JOE piles his papers and bags onto the 
      trolley. JOE hands JOHN his mobile phone.          CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     7.


      INT. MILLER HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY 1 (15.17H)1/291/29

      JULIET staring at the phone, trying to think. She makes a 
      decision and dials. 

      EXT. BACK OF CROWN COURT - DAY 1 (15.18H)1/301/30

    JOE starts the stopwatch on his running watch and runs off. 
      JOHN watches him go. JOE's mobile rings. JOHN answers it. 

                                  JOHN
                    Hello, MrsM. No, you just missed 
                    him. Yeah. Bye. 

    He ends the call and pops the phone into Joe's briefcase.

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. STAIRS - DAY 1 (15.19H)1/311/31

      JULIET rushes upstairs. A scream from the loft. Then a laugh. 
    Two female voices. JULIET pauses for a moment. Then goes on. 

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. UTILITY ROOM - DAY 1 (15.20H)1/321/32

      JULIET takes her clothes off and stuffs them into the washing 
      machine. She takes a dressing gown out of the dirty laundry 
      basket and puts it on. The cord is missing. She tries to use 
      a dispenser to put washing powder into the machine but she is 
    too anxious and panicked and she has to tip powder straight 
      from the packet into the drum. Her open dressing gown flaps 
      around her and she can't keep it from flapping and getting in 
    the way and some of the powder spills on the floor. She gets 
      down on her hands and knees to pick up the powder. She picks 
    up every last bit and puts it into the washing machine drum. 
    She turns the washing machine on. She sits down on the floor 
    and brings her knees up to her chin. She watches the washing 
      machine drum spin. She makes small rocking motions back and 
      forward as though somehow this might make the washing cycle 
      speed up. Another scream from the loft. 

      EXT. EMBANKMENT - DAY 1 (15.33H)1/331/33

    JOE running. He looks at his watch and ups the speed. This is 
    an interval training session - thirty seconds hard, thirty 
      seconds recovery, repeated. 

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. UTILITY ROOM - DAY 1 (15.40H)1/341/34

      JULIET rocking faster now as she watches the drum spin. 

      EXT. EMBANKMENT - DAY 1 (15.41H)1/351/35

    JOE running. Another RUNNER goes past him. This is a 
      fortysomething television scriptwriter. JOE doesn't like 
      being overtaken by scriptwriter types and he ups his speed 
      even more and passes the RUNNER.           CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     8.


    NO SCENE 361/361/36

      EXT. CANAL TOWPATH - DAY 1 (15.47H)1/371/37

      A narrow path alongside the canal. A wall on one side, the 
      canal on the other. JOE looks at his watch and starts a 
      thirty second interval sprint. EDDIE AGAR, a big scary 
      looking hooded man standing with his back to the wall dealing 
      drugs to two runty looking JUNKIES. They block the path. JOE 
      approaching. He can see that he won't get by. He has to slow 
      down. AGAR and the junky runts know they are blocking the 
      path. JOE looks angry. AGAR sees this. 

                                  AGAR
                    Is there a problem?

                                  JOE
                    Are you dealing?

                                  AGAR
                    Who are you?

                                  JOE
                    What is it? Crack? 

      AGAR takes a step towards JOE.

                                  AGAR
                    You looking for a slap?*

                                  JOE
                    I'm running the London marathon

      AGAR stares at him trying to fathom what the hell this man 
      wants. A silence.

                    In seven weeks time. 

      AGAR stares. Who is this? Why is he saying this?

                                  JOE (CONT'D)
                    So sponsor me.

      A slow smile from AGAR and then the smile broadens and then 
      he's laughing. JOE smiles. 

                                  AGAR
                    Sponsor you?

                                  JOE
                    It is your money, isn't it? Or are 
                    you just a soldier?

    The question works. AGAR needs to prove his status. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     9.

                                  AGAR
                    How big are your balls, man? 

    He hands him a twenty. JOE folds the note very carefully and 
      puts it in the small zip pocket in the back of his shorts. He 
      runs off and up some steps onto road level and past a parked 
    car with two MEN sitting in it. JOE doesn't see that the 
      FIRST MAN is talking to the SECOND MAN who is making notes in 
      a notebook down on his lap. 

      EXT. MIDDLE TEMPLE LANE - DAY 1 (15.57H)1/381/38

    JOE sprinting up Middle Temple Lane past Barristers and 
      TEMPLE PORTERS in bowler hats. He reaches the entrance to 
      chambers. He stops his running watch. Up close with his 
      breathing. He leans against the wall to recover.   

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. UTILITY ROOM - DAY 1 (16.03H)1/391/39

      JULIET transferring her clothes into the drier. Then she 
      picks up a phone and dials.

    NO SCENE 4O1/401/40

      INT. CHAMBERS. CLERKS ROOM - DAY 1 (16.04H)1/411/41

      Incredibly busy, lots of coming and going. Joe's briefcase is 
      next to JOHN at his desk. JOHN on the phone. He hears the 
      mobile ringing in Joe's bag. He ignores it. 

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. UTILITY ROOM - DAY 1 (16.05H)1/421/42

      JULIET on the phone. No answer. She ends the call. She rubs 
    her eyebrow.  

      INT. CHAMBERS. CLERKS ROOM - DAY 1 (16.06H)1/431/43

    JOE comes in and goes to the pigeon holes. JOHN, still on the 
      phone, puts his hand over the mouthpiece. 

                                  JOHN
                    Spoke to your wife, sir.

    JOE going through his pigeon hole. SAUL, the senior clerk 
      hears what John says and they exchange a look, which tells us 
      that John is entering tricky territory here. JOE doesn't look 
    up from going through his pigeon hole. 

                                  JOE
                    Did she leave a message?

                                  JOHN
                    No. 

    JOE glances over at SAUL, who looks away and gets on with his 
      phone call. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     10.

                          (On phone)
                    I could give you Joe Miller. No, 
                    his trial finished today 

    Did he win? What kind of a question is that?

      SAUL mouths the question to JOE.

                                  SAUL (CONT'D)
                          (Mouthed)
                    Did you win?

    JOE nods.

                          (On phone)
                    Of course he won. 

                                  JOE
                    What is it?

      SAUL puts his hand over the mouthpiece.

                                  SAUL
                    Nice rape for tomorrow, sir. 

      SAUL goes back to his call. JOHN has finished his. JOE goes 
    to John's desk to collect his bags.  

                                  JOE
                    When did she call?

                                  JOHN
                    You'd just started running. Sorry 
                    about that, sir.

    JOE nods and goes. All the clerks watch him as he goes. 

      INT. TOILETS. JOE'S CHAMBERS - DAY 1 (16.10H)1/441/44

    JOE looking in the mirror. SAUL comes in.

                                  SAUL
                    My son, aged five and a half, goes 
                    to school in the morning one hand 
                    in his mouth the other holding onto 
                    his willy.In the evening he comes 
                    home one hand in his mouth the 
                    other holding onto his willy.What 
                    do I know from this? I know that 
                    all is well in his world. 

    JOE registers the implication here that all is not well with 
    his world as Saul sees it.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)        CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     11.

                                  SAUL 
                    I know what's happening at home. I 
                    know it's hard. 

    JOE pulls on a t-shirt.

                                  JOE
                    You're clerking my life now as well

                                  SAUL
                    Always. 

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. BATHROOM - DAY 1 (16.24H)1/451/45

      JULIET puts the phone on the toilet seat and gets into the 
      shower. She repeatedly leans back out of the water stream so 
    as to hear if the phone is ringing. She soaps up a flannel 
    and washes. All done in a frantic rush.

      INT. CHAMBERS. ROOM - DAY 1 (16.26H)1/461/46

    JOE removes the Agar twenty from the zip pocket of his 
      running shorts and puts it in his trouser pocket. He takes a 
      green notebook out of his bag, looks at his running watch and 
      records the story of his run in the green notebook. One more 
      entry on a page full of running records. 

      9.3.09. Court/Canal. 6 miles 6x30reps 39.22. 

      SAUL comes in. JOE packing up during the rest of the scene. 

                                  SAUL
                    The rape. He broke in to her ground 
                    floor flat, tied her up, did his 
                    thing, had a fuckingcigarette... 
                    and left. She picked him out on an 
                    ID parade; prints all over the 
                    flat, his DNA all over her.

                                  JOE

    JOE doesn't like this. 

                                  JOE
                    I don't want to be away from home.

                                  SAUL
                    I've said yes.

                    London.

                                  SAUL*
                    It's a commute. Less than two hours *
                    from StPancras. *

                                    SAUL(CONT'D)*
                    He's got form, Joe. Same thing ten 
                    years ago. He'd been out a week.

    JOE is swayed by this. He nods. SAUL smiles. JOE dialling his 
      home number.

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. BATHROOM - DAY 1 (16.28H)1/471/47

    The phone ringing. JULIET hears it and gets out the shower 
      quickly. She is dripping wet. She picks up the phone but then 
      thinks again and turns off the shower before answering so 
      that Joe won't hear the shower. 

                                  JULIET
                    Hello. No. I was just upstairs.  

    It sounds like she's lying.

      INT. CHAMBERS. JOE'S ROOM - DAY 1 (16.29H)1/481/48

    JOE on the phone. SAUL makes a drinking gesture to indicate 
      that he wants to go for a drink with Joe and goes. 

                                  JOE
                          (On phone)
                    No. I'm in chambers.
                    Yeah. Okay. I love you. 

    He looks at his watch.

                                  JOE (CONT D)
                    About half five, probably. 

    JOE finishes the call. He looks at his watch again, thinking.

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. BATHROOM - DAY 1 (16.31H)1/491/49

      JULIET dries the phone with a towel and then wraps the towel 
      around herself. She uses the bath mat to dry the bathtub. She 
      stops. Where is her watch? She looks in the pockets of her 
      dressing gown. She rushes out of the bathroom.

    He gives JOE another couple of twenties. 

                                  SAUL (CONT'D)
                    There's my gift aid. 

    JOE takes the Agar twenty out of his pocket and puts it with

      JULIET rifling through her handbag and then pulling all the 
      contents out, including a box of pills. These are anti-
      depressants. She can't find her watch. Has she left it at 
      Dominic's house? She calls him using the house phone.

                                  JULIET
                    I can't find my watch. Did I leave 
                    it at your house? 

    She waits. He's gone to look. She empties the pills out on 
    the surface. She takes two and puts them in the rubbish bin. 
      They sit on top of other rubbish and so are visible. She puts 
    her hand into the bin to push the pills down and out of 
      sight. We can hear DOMINIC on the phone.

    JOE walks away. DRIVER calls after him. 

                                  DRIVER
                    Okay then. So what about when you 
                    have to prosecute someone you know 
                    is NOT guilty?

                                  JOE

    JOE walks towards the house.

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY 1 (17.01H)1/651/65

      JULIET in an armchair, sitting forward, laptop on knee. She 
      looks up from the screen and checks her watch. Five o'clock. 
    She looks back at the screen. Unseen and unheard by Juliet, 
    JOE comes through the door and stands at the top of the 
      steps. From his vantage point he can see her on the laptop. 
    He watches her for a moment. JULIET senses he is there. She 
      closes the site, clears the history on the laptop and closes 
    the lid as JOE approaches. She stands up and puts the laptop 
      down. 

                                  JOE
                    Hello, lovely.

    She smiles. He smiles. He gives her the flowers.

    JOE reaches the top of the enclosed stairway into the loft 
      space and bursts in. His POVof his thirteen year old 
      daughter, ELLA and her best friend KATE. KATE is lying on the 
      floor with her bare legs stretched out in front of her. ELLA

                    What's wrong with hairy legs?

      ELLA amused and mortified at the same time.

                    Dad.

      They reach the bottom of the stairs. JULIET looks on from the 
      threshold of the kitchen. She feels somehow semi-detached.

                                  ELLA (CONT'D)
                    Can Kate stay for supper?

      JOE's reply is instantaneous.

                    Just e-mails.

      JULIET leaves the kitchen and goes into the downstairs loo. 
    JOE pulls the cork out.

      JULIET sitting on the toilet, the seat down. She is taking 
      deep breaths and rubbing her eyebrow. She is trying to regain 
    her equilibrium. She leans forward and runs the cold tap. Now 
    she can let go a little and not be heard. She takes deeper, 
      bigger, gulping breaths. 

      INT. KITCHEN. MILLER HOUSE - DAY 1 (17.17H)1/721/72

    The sound of the running water from the loo. JOE looks at the 
      computer. He keys in Juliet's e-mail address and signs in 
      using her password. The top messages are unopened. E-mails 
      from Ella's school and the like, nothing personal. 

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. DOWNSTAIRS LOO - DAY 1 (17.18H)1/731/73

      JULIET feels nauseous. She turns round and gags and then is 
      sick into the toilet.

    JOE counting the pills in the box of pills in the handbag

                    What?

                    No. Not really. 

    JOE pours and whacks back a glass of wine. JULIET rubs her 
      eyebrow.

                    Did you ask me to get some?*

                    ...and then you said how much you 
                    used to love the powdered stuff. 
                    Remember?

    She doesn't. He smiles in a caring, gentle, pitying kind of a 
      way. A smile that says: poor Juliet. 

                                  JOE (CONT'D)
                    It was on the list.

    JOE pulls open the drier and sees the clothes Juliet was 
      wearing earlier. He looks in the laundry basket - lots of 
      dirty clothing. He pulls out the four items from the drier. 
    He folds them carefully. The folding feels like an expression 
    of pain. ELLA and KATE are in the garden.

                                  KATE

                    And you had a shower.

                    My fault. 

    He winks at ELLA. ELLA understands it's not his fault. She 
      knows he's protecting Juliet. This is what happens. Ella and 
    Joe share this looking after Mum business. JOE grabs his old 
    bag and takes a plastic bag from the work surface. JULIET 
      rubs her eyebrow as she watches JOE go.

      Father and daughter exchange a look which speaks of their 
      togetherness in having to deal with the troubled Juliet.

    JOE getting into the car. He reaches inside the plastic bag 
    and pulls out a supermarket receipt. He looks at the time on 
    it. 11.30 am. He circles it with the pencil he keeps inside 
    his little green book which he takes from his old bag. He 
      starts the engine and checks the mileage. He turns to another 
      page in his little green book. A long column of mileage 
      numbers. He looks at the last recorded number and looks again 
    at the current mileage. He calculates the difference between 
    the two and writes it down in pencil.

    JOE pulls into the driveway and stops the car. He writes down 
    the real mileage to and from the supermarket. The journey he 
    has just done. 3.4. Then he writes down the gap between this 
      distance and the recorded distance (4.2) of the last journey 
      made in the car - by his wife. 0.8. He puts his face in his

                                  JOE
                    That's what the custard's for... 

      JULIET looks bewildered. KATE looks embarrassed. ELLA 
      embarrassed that Kate is embarrassed.

                                  ELLA
                    We're going upstairs.

      ELLA clears her own plate and goes. KATE does the same. 

                                  JOE 
                    I called you.

                                  JULIET
                    What time?

                                  JOE
                    I don't know... around three.

                                  JULIET
                    I was at the supermarket. 

      JULIET starts clearing the table. JOE pours some more wine. 
    He runs his finger around the rim of the glass. He gets up 
    and goes. 

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. BEDROOM - NIGHT 1 (19.08H)1/851/85

    JOE standing looking at the supermarket receipt. The circled 
      time on the receipt. 11.30am.He knows he is being lied to. 

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. KITCHEN - NIGHT 1 (19.09H)1/861/86

      JULIET stares at the oven. She opens the door. She sees a 
      serving dish with nothing on it. Did she put it there? Why is 
      there nothing in it? She gets a tea towel and takes the empty 
      serving dish out of the oven. The dish is not oven proof and 
    it cracks and breaks when its temperature reduces. JULIET 
      isn't thinking and she picks up a piece of broken dish and 
      burns her hand. She's a mess. 

                                  JULIET
                    Joe.

                                  JOE
                    Good. 

    He holds her hand there.

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. UTILITY ROOM - NIGHT 1 (19.13H)1/881/88

    JOE sits down on the floor next to a phone. He picks up the 
      phone. This is painful for him. He hits a button and the last 
      number dialled comes up on the screen. 0207 946 0088. JOE 
      doesn't recognize this number.  

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. HALLWAY - NIGHT 1 (19.15H)1/891/89

      KATE getting ready to go. JULIET sitting on the stairs and 
    not saying anything. KATE conscious of this slightly odd 
      behaviourand the tensions in the house. JOE comes from the 
      kitchen.  

                                  JOE

                                  KATE
                    I can walk home. 

                                  JOE
                    It's fine. 

                                  JULIET
                    Haven't you had too much to drink?

    JOE stares at her. He lets the silence lengthen. She doesn't 
      want him to take Kate home.

                                  JULIET (CONT'D)
                    I mean, you shouldn't drive... if 
                    you're...

                    What do you mean? "Ended up"? 

                                  KATE
                    We were going to my house but Dad 
                    said could we come to yours. 

                                  JOE

                                  KATE
                    He didn't say.

      sees this.

    JOE lingers a moment on the doorstep. 

                                  DOMINIC
                    So. Not long to go.

                                  JOE
                    No.

      DOMINIC a little uneasy here. It's not obvious why Joe is 
      lingering.

                                  DOMINIC
                    I hear you're up to eighty miles a 
                    week.

                                  JOE
                    Where did you hear that?

                                  DOMINIC
                    I can't remember. Someone...

                                  DOMINIC
                    I ran it five years ago. Did I tell 
                    you? I did the last five miles 
                    alongside Gordon Ramsay.

                                  JOE
                    Pretty slow, then.

      A beat. Then JOE smiles and this tells DOMINIC that the above 
    is a joke and now JOE drops the cross examining tone he has 
      adopted and is suddenly more friendly. DOMINIC is relieved. 

                                  JOE (CONT'D)
                    We should play squash maybe? 
                    I'll... I don't think we've got 
                    your new number, have we?

    JOE pulls up. He looks at the mileage. 0.8. He takes out his 
      green notebook and looks at the note he made after returning 
      from the supermarket. 0.8. Now he knows where Juliet has 
      been. He sits in the car for a moment. The pain of betrayal.

    JOE is holding on to this conversation about homework as a 
    way of trying to keep his equilibrium. ELLA has sensed this.

    the drawer. She opens it. She takes a kitchen knife out. Then 
      another knife. Then one more knife. She lines them up. She 
      looks at them. She picks up one of the knives. It's difficult 
    to grip because of the burn on her fingers, so she holds it *
      loosely in her fingers.

      JULIET coming up the stairs holding the knife in one hand and 
    the vaselinein the other. She stops outside the bedroom. She 
      listens. She looks up the stairs to the loft. She listens 
      some more.  

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. BEDROOM. NIGHT 1 (22.04H)1/1051/105

    JOE in bed, his back to the door. He appears to have fallen 
      asleep. JULIET by the door. Her hands behind her back. Is he 
      asleep? She's not sure. She is incredibly still. She never 
      takes her eyes off JOE. His breathing is the only sound. 

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. LOFT BEDROOM. NIGHT 1 (22.05H)1/1061/106

      ELLA in bed. Asleep now. The story tape still playing.

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. BEDROOM. NIGHT 1 (22.06H)1/1071/107

      JULIET sits in an armchair, eyes fixed on Joe in bed. He's 
      asleep, isn't he? She's cold. She puts the knife and the 
      vaselinedown very carefully. The knife makes a small sound 
    on the wooden floor as she puts it down. She freezes. He 
      stirs. He shifts position in the bed a little and then 
      resettles. She takes a cardigan from the back of the chair 
    and starts very, veryslowly and carefully to put it on. 

                                  JOE
                    Are you coming to bed? 

      JULIET freezes. JOE still has his back to her.

                                  JOE (CONT'D)
                    Come here. 

    She discards the cardigan. A pause. She looks at the vaseline
    and the knife. 

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. LOFT BEDROOM. NIGHT 1 (22.07H)1/1081/108

      ELLA's story tape finishes. The silence wakes her.         CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     31.


      INT. MILLER HOUSE. LOFT STAIRS. NIGHT 1 (22.08H)1/1091/109

      ELLA coming downstairs. She sees her parents bedroom door 
      open. She looks in. It's dark. All from Ella's POV.There's a 
      flurried confusion of movement and sound coming from the bed.

    JOE gasps. A kind of protracted whimper from JULIET. JOE 
      moans. Then a sort of strangled sound from JOE. What is this? 
    Are her parents having sex? ELLA backs out of the room. She 
    is frightened. She is not sure what she's seen.

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. BEDROOM. NIGHT 1 (22.09H)1/1101/110

      JULIET standing by the bed, breathing fast. There is blood 
      everywhere. Blood on the back of her nightie. She backs away. 
    She sees the discarded cardigan. She puts it on. She sees the 
      vaselinepot. She puts it in her pocket. She dials 999. 

                                  JULIET

      JULIET goes to the coat cupboard and pulls on the only pair 
    of shoes in there - a pair of Converse belonging to Ella. She 
      ties the laces, her hands working fast. She hears Ella 
      calling her from upstairs. 

                                  ELLA

      JULIET takes a coat. Another coat falls to the ground. She 
      picks it up and puts it back on the hook before heading for 
    the door. She takes her handbag from the banister. She leaves 
    the front door open when she goes.        CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     32.

                    Dad?

    Now she sees. He has a knife in his abdomen sticking up and 
      under his rib cage. He manages to turn his head slightly to 
      look at her. It is just about possible to see in his eyes 
      that he is pleading for help.

                    There's a knife in him... He's

    She puts the phone on the ground. She crawls over to JOE. He 
      opens his eyes and looks at her.

                    Hello? Hello?

      ELLA's hands shaking. She tries to stop her right hand 
      shaking by taking a hold of the wrist with the other hand. 
      Slowly she moves her hand towards the knife, still gripping 
    her own wrist. She pulls the knife out.

                    Is there a towel or something 
                    nearby?

      ELLA looks around her. She crawls to the bed and picks up a 
      pillow.  

                                  ELLA
                    A pillow.

      ELLA presses the pillow down on her father's stomach and 
      holds it there.

                    Please. I'm sorry. Please, Dad. 

    She presses down on the pillow and sobs into it at the same 
      time. The blood seeps into the pillow. ELLA is hysterical 
      now. She is covered in blood. JOE keeps wanting to go to 
      sleep. He's fighting it. He knows what going to sleep means. 
      Blue lights flashing outside. The sound of TWO AMBULANCE MEN 
      coming fast up the stairs. ELLA's face. Who is this in the 
      house? She grabs the knife. She turns around. AMBULANCE MEN 
    at the door. Their POV.She is covered in blood and holding 
    the knife. They stare at her. She is shaking and shivering 
    and incapable of speech or voluntary movement.

      holds eye contact at all times.

1/1441/144INT. POLICE STATION. CUSTODY RECEPTION AREA. NIGHT 1 
      (23.45H)

      FABER looking at JULIET as she's brought into the holding 
      area. A skinny, lippyDRUNK is being booked in by CROSS. 

                                  FABER
                    Let's get her in. 















                                                                            (CONTINUED)        CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     45.

                                  CROSS
                    Give me a minute, Boss.

      CROSS counting out coins belonging to the lippyDRUNK.

                                  CROSS (CONT'D)
                    One pound twenty three in coins.

                                  DRUNK
                    I had way more than that. You've 
                    had my money. 

      FABER looks at him and back at JULIET.

                                  FABER
                    What is this?

                                  CROSS
                    Obstruct Police... 

                                  FABER
                    Get him out of here.

                                  CROSS
                    Just processing him now, boss. 

                                  DRUNK
                    I want to make a complaint.

      FABER speaks quietly but with such intensity and authority 
      that everyone hears. He is not looking at LIPPYDRUNK.

                                  FABER
                    No you don't. You really, really 
                    don't. 

      FABER stares hard at DRUNK.

                                  CROSS
                    Would you like to make that 
                    complaint, young man? 

      DRUNK shakes his head and is led away to the cells.

                    I want a woman officer doing the

                    then, don't touch her and don't let 
                    her touch anything. She's a scene.

      INT. POLICE STATION. CELL - NIGHT 1 (23.49H)1/1471/147

    We hold on JULIET who is standing in the middle of the cell. 

                                  BRAWN
                    Where the hell is Flo?

    She is starting to look distressed. 

                                  BRAWN (CONT'D)
                    I'm going for a dump. I may be some 
                    time. 

      BRAWN goes. JULIET is getting agitated now. She keeps 
      reaching under her coat and taking a hold of the bottom of 
    her nightie and twisting the nightie so she can see the blood 
    on the back of the nightie. Seeing the blood distresses her. 

                                  JULIET
                    Please. Can I...?

      TRUSSLER doesn't know what to say or do.

                                  JULIET (CONT'D)
                    Please? 

                                  TRUSSLER
                    Just relax.

                                  JULIET
                    I want to take it off. Please. 

                                  TRUSSLER
                    What?

                                  JULIET
                    My nightie. Please.

      TRUSSLER looks for BRAWN coming back. JULIET more agitated. 
    She starts to take her clothes off.  

                                  TRUSSLER
                    Shit.Shit.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)        CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     47.
      CONTINUED:1/1471/147

      JULIET's hands are shaking. Then she can't take it anymore  
    and she rips at her clothes. 

                                  TRUSSLER (CONT'D)
                          (Shouts)
                    Sarge.

      BOND and CROSS rush in. BRAWN returns. BOND and CROSS take 
      hold of a wrist each and BRAWN goes in low and holds JULIET 
    by the ankles. FLO appears at the door. 

                                  FLO
                    Hello. We ready here? 

    FLO starts doing the search. BRAWN, BOND and CROSS still 
      holding JULIET's wrists and ankles to prevent her moving or 
      kicking up. JULIET is shaking.

                                  FLO (CONT D)
                    Are you going to stay still for me? 

      JULIET calms down. CROSS is able to retreat. 

                                  FLO (CONT'D)
                    What was all the fuss about?

      SEXTON appears and hears what Juliet says next.

                                  JULIET
                    My nightie. 

                                  FLO
                    What about it?

                                  JULIET
                    It's... It's the wrong way round. 

                                  FLO
                    Oh dear. 

    The male officers exchange raised eyebrow glances. SEXTON 
      looks at CROSS, who makes a note. FLO nods at the male 
      officers and they back out of the room. Now FLO is stripping 
    the clothes off Juliet and bagging them. The male officers 
      lurk just outside, backs to the stripping of Juliet in a 
      slightly absurd show of decorum. 

    NO SCENE 1481/1481/148

      INT. POLICE STATION. CUSTODY AREA - NIGHT 1 (23.52H)1/1491/149

    FLO comes out of the cell. BRAWN holds up a blue paper suit 
    and TRUSSLER a second much bigger blue paper suit.

                                  BRAWN
                    This one's about the right size?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     48.

    FLO nods and goes to speak to BOND who is behind the desk.

                                  BRAWN (CONT'D)
                          (Sotto)
                    So let's give her this one.

      BRAWN takes the bigger blue paper suit from TRUSSLER and 
      hands it to FLO as she leaves the desk and heads back to 
      Juliet in the cell. 

                                  BRAWN (CONT'D)
                    Make sure it's the right way round.

      INT. POLICE STATION. CUSTODY AREA - NIGHT 1 (23.57H)1/1501/150

      JULIET presented at the desk by FLO.

                                  CROSS
                    Do you have a solicitor? 

                                  JULIET
                    There was one who... He did our

                                  CROSS

                                  JULIET
                    I don't know. My husband...

      SEXTON intercedes.

                                  SEXTON
                    He might not be the right kind of 
                    solicitor for this.

      CROSS trying to gesture to Sexton to tell him not to go down 
      this line. 

                                  SEXTON (CONT'D)
                    Who's the duty?

      CROSS shakes his head at SEXTON and BOND pulls a face. 
      JACQUELINE WOOLF, the duty solicitor walks in. Everyone calls 
    her JACK. Sexton doesn't like her.  

                                  JACK
                    Hello, boys.  

      INT. POLICE STATION. CELL - NIGHT 1 (00.06H)1/1511/151

      JACK opens a bag full of loo rolls and hands one to JULIET. 

                                  JACK
                    You're cold.

    She takes off her jumper and gives it to Juliet. 

                                  JULIET
                    Am I allowed to...?

                                  JACK
                    You're cold. Put the jumper on. 

                                  JULIET
                    How is he? 

                                  JACK
                    Not very well.

                                  JULIET
                    I couldn't do without him.

                                  JACK
                    I know.  

    She takes away a nasty loo roll from the loo roll holder and 
      puts a soft, long and strong one in its place. She sits down 
      next to JULIET.     

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    My name is Jacqueline. Everybody 
                    calls me Jack. 

      JULIET rubs her eyebrow. 

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    You are going to have to talk about 
                    what happened. But in your own 
                    time. And you'll talk to me first, 
                    not them. So no comment to 
                    everything they ask. Have you got 
                    that?

      JACK goes to the door. She looks back at JULIET who is 
      rubbing her eyebrow hard. She isn't taking anything in.

                    I don't want her interviewed. She's 
                    so traumatized she can barely

                    How long have you been doing this 
                    job? Twenty years? Have you ever in

                    badly screwed up, found unfit for

      INT. POLICE STATION. CELL - NIGHT 1 (00.12H)1/1531/153

      JULIET looks up as the cell door opens. CLIVE PRIDE, the FME 
      comes in with JACK. He doesn't once look at JULIET.

                                  PRIDE
                    Excellent. Your solicitor has 
                    explained what's happening. So just 
                    a few questions. Have you had 
                    anything to drink tonight?

      JULIET doesn't answer. She glances at JACK. PRIDE looks at 
    the wall waiting to hear if there's going to be an answer. No 
      response. So he presses on.

                                  PRIDE (CONT'D)
                    Are you currently taking any 
                      medication?

      JULIET looks at JACK again and then finds the courage to 
      answer.

                                  JULIET
                    No comment. 

      PRIDE laughs and then remembers himself.

                                  PRIDE
                    Sorry. This is not an interview. 
                    I'm a doctor, not a police officer.        CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     51.


      INT. POLICE STATION. CUSTODY AREA - NIGHT 1 (00.15H)1/1541/154

      PRIDE comes in. SEXTON there. JACK follows him in. 

                                  PRIDE
                    She's fine.

      PRIDE goes to talk to CROSS.

                                  JACK
                    I want her examined for rape.  

                                  SEXTON
                    Why? 

                                  JACK
                    What my client says to me is 
                      confidential. As you well know.

                                  SEXTON
                    Then I've got no basis for doing a 
                    rape exam have I? Anyway, what's 
                    rape got to do with it? They're 
                    husband and wife. 

                                  JACK
                    You only do it for me.

                                  SEXTON
                    What's that?

                                  JACK
                    The rest of the time you're an 
                      enlightened human being.  

      SEXTON deadpan.

                                  SEXTON
                    It's what I think. 

                                  JACK
                    Yeah, right.

      SEXTON deadpan. When Jack betrays in her expression, just a 
      little, that she thinks maybe he might actually mean this, he 
      knows he's won and there's a twinkle in his eye.

                                  FABER
                    Sick people get smaller, don't 
                    they? They sort of wither.

                    He should make it. If that's what 
                    you want to know.

                                  FABER
                    One question. Angle of entry.

                                  ARMITAGE
                    The knife went in under the rib 
                    cage heading upwards.

                                  FABER
                    Her standing; him lying down. That 
                    doesn't work, does it?

                                  ARMITAGE
                    You're the police officer.

      ARMITAGE goes. FABER dials number on his phone.

                                  FABER 
                    Flo? Bill. 

      INT. POLICE STATION. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT 1 (00.19H)1/1561/156

      JULIET and JACK waiting. JULIET rubbing her eyebrow. SECOND 
      FEMALE OFFICER across the table. They sit in silence. FLO 
      comes in as she finishes her phone call with Faber. 

                                  FLO
                    It's a rare and wonderful thing.

                                  JACK
                    What's that?

                                  FLO
                    Four women in a room in a police 
                    station.  

    FLO smiles at JULIET. 

                                  FLO (CONT'D)
                    I like your jumper.

                                  JACK
                    Shall we start?

      INT. POLICE STATION. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT 1 (00.32H)1/1571/157

      Tape running. We are mid interview.

                                  FLO
                    What did you mean when you said 
                    "I'm sorry, Joe" at the hospital?

      JULIET glances at JACK. She needs her support. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     53.

                    Sorry for what, Juliet?

      JACK encourages JULIET with half a nod.

                                  JULIET
                    No comment.

                                  FLO
                    The same thing you said sorry for 
                    on the 999 call?

      A short silence. JULIET's head down. 

                                  FLO (CONT'D)
                    Can I just... This is a bit of a 
                    tangent really... Have you always 
                    had the same bed? I mean, since you 
                    were first married? 

      JULIET looks at her.

                                  FLO (CONT'D)
                    What is that? Fifteen years? Ella 
                    would have been in there with you 
                    when she was a baby, I suppose? 

    The mention of Ella is upsetting for Juliet. 

                                  FLO (CONT'D)
                    I don't know. I was just wondering.  
                    What would it take? To put a knife 
                    in the man you've shared the same 
                    bed with when it has all that... 
                    what's the phrase I'm looking for? 
                    Family history, I suppose. 

      JULIET is close to talking here. FLO has got to her. JACK 
      glances at JULIET and steps in.

                                  JACK 
                    That's not a proper question.

    FLO looking at JULIET. JULIET looking back.

                                  FLO 
                    Juliet?

      JULIET just manages to hold it together enough to respond.  

                                  JULIET
                    No comment.

                    You did really well. Get some sleep 
                    if you can. 

      JULIET starts to take the jumper off to return it. 

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    No, no. Keep it. 

      JACK goes. Jack's kindness here makes it hard for JULIET. 

      INT. POLICE STATION. CUSTODY AREA. NIGHT 1 (00.52H)1/1591/159

      JACK leaving the police station. SEXTON watching her go. He 
      runs the two things he says to her together, both of them 
      throw away so the second thing doesn't feel in tone any 
      different from the first. 

                                  SEXTON
                    'Night Jack. Nice tits. 

      JACK smiles. She knows not to rise to the bait. SEXTON 
      smiles. CROSS is at one end of the reception area, BOND at 
    the other end dealing with a PRISONER. SEXTON has a quiet 
      word with CROSS. 

                                  SEXTON (CONT'D)
                    Let's have another go at getting 
                    samples from the daughter.

      SEXTON moves to other end of reception area as BOND finishes 
      dealing with a PRISONER. 

                                  SEXTON (CONT D)
                    Might be a good moment to get 
                    samples from Mum. 

      INT. POLICE STATION. CORRIDOR. NIGHT 1 (00.58H)1/1601/160

      JULIET being led down a corridor by BRAWN. ELLA coming from 
    the other direction led by SECOND FEMALE OFFICER. JULIET sees 
      ELLA. Then ELLA sees JULIET. ELLA recoils. This is a terrible 
      moment for JULIET. Her daughter is frightened of her.  

                                  JULIET
                    No, no. 

      ELLA backing away.

                    Ella. Ella?

      From the end of the corridor SEXTON watches Ella backing away 
      from her mother. A small smile.

                                  SEXTON
                    That would be against all the 
                    rules. One suspect talking to 
                    another. 

                                  JULIET

    FLO walking one way. SEXTON heading towards Juliet's cell. 
    FLO looking at her watch. She looks up and sees SEXTON.

      FABER standing very still, taking it all in. An ipodattached 
    to his white paper suit. The knives, the broken serving dish. 
    The items from the rubbish bin laid out on a plastic sheet. 
    The two anti-depressant pills. FABER bends down to look at

      FABER taking it all in. He looks at the bed and the blood. He 
      alters the position of his feet so that he is side on to the 
      bed. He adjusts his feet a little moreand brings his arm up 
    and slices downward towards the bed, miming a stabbing 
      action. Then he changes the position of his upper body so 
      that although he is still standing, the angle of the stabbing 
      action he now makes is closer to the horizontal.

                    Sorry.

    The moment in which Juliet might have asked for the return of 
      Jack has gone. FLO smiles at JULIET. JULIET is very matter of 
      fact when she starts to speak.

                                  JULIET
                    I was upstairs in the bedroom with 
                    Joe. Then I went downstairs. I took 
                    a knife from the kitchen drawer. I 
                    came back upstairs with it. 

                                  FLO
                    What did you intend to do with the

                                  JULIET
                    Use it.

    Her whole tone here is disarmingly flat, very matter of fact.

                                  JULIET
                    He looked like he was asleep. So I 
                    sat down... for quite a long time. 
                    Then he woke up. He wanted me to 
                    come to bed. 

      INT. MILLER HOUSE. BEDROOM - DAY 2 (07.04H)1/1741/174

      FABER positions the top half of his body so that it is 
      horizontal with the bed, the equivalent of being in the bed. 
      Then he mimes a stabbing action, only this time the imagined 
      knife is driven upwards into the imagined victim.

      INT. POLICE STATION. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY 2 (07.05H)1/1751/175

      INT. POLICE STATION. CORRIDOR - DAY 2 (07.10H)1/1771/177

      SEXTON's POVas FLO and SECOND FEMALE OFFICER come out of the 
      Interview Room. FLO looks at him and nods. They've got what 
      they wanted. JULIET comes out. SEXTON turns away. 

      INT. POLICE STATION. FABER'S OFFICE. DAY 2 (07.11H)1/1781/178

      ELLA asleep on the sofa being watched by FLO at the door. FLO 
      tries to wake her gently. She won't wake at first. When she 
      does, she remembers where she is and what has happened and we 
    see all of this in her face. 

      INT. POLICE STATION. CELL - DAY 2 (07.12H)1/1791/179

      SEXTON outside the cell with the door flap open. 

                                  SEXTON
                    I don't know what you're talking 
                    about.

                                  JULIET
                    You said I could see her.

                                  SEXTON
                    I've been upstairs in the canteen 
                    for the last hour, love. I think 
                    you're imagining things. Anyway, 
                    your daughter's not here anymore.

                                  JULIET
                    Where is she? Where have you taken 
                    her?

                                  SEXTON
                    I'm not sure it's a good idea for 
                    you to know that. 

      SEXTON goes. JULIET banging on the cell door.

      EXT. FOSTER HOUSE - DAY 2 (07.42H)1/1801/180

      ELLA and NORMA walking towards the house.

                                    NORMA
                    They're going to look after you for 
                    twenty four hours while we sort 
                    things out.

                                  ELLA
                    But you're staying with me... 

      NORMA's face. She's not staying with her, of course. ELLA's 
      face. A desperate and failing effort to be brave.         CRIMINAL JUSTICE II, EPISODE 1 - SHOOTING SCRIPT     60.


      INT. HOSPITAL. CRITICAL CARE - DAY 2 (07.43H)1/1811/181

      Close up on JOE. Lots of infusions and drains and a catheter 
    in the bladder. An endotracheal tube in his mouth connected 
    to ventilator. This is a sick man. But his eyes flicker open. 

      INT. POLICE STATION. CELL - DAY 2 (07.44H)1/1821/182

      JULIET in her cell. She wanders around. She sits. She lies 
      down. She stands up. 

      INT. POLICE STATION. CUSTODY AREA - DAY 2 (07.45H)1/1831/183

      SEXTON and FLO at the desk with CROSS. FABER comes in. 

                                  SEXTON
                    Nailed her, sir. The ice queen 
                    coughed.

                                  FABER
                    Did she talk about why? 

                                  SEXTON
                    What?

                                  FABER
                    Did anybody ask her why she did it? 

      INT. POLICE STATION. CELL - DAY 2 (07.46H)1/1841/184

      JULIET pushes her body tight into the corner. She rubs her 
      eyebrow. Close up on her face.
