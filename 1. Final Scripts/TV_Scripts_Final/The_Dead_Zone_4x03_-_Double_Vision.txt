                                              TEASER

          FADE IN:

  11TIGHT ON A "TO DO LIST"  (INT. JOHNNY'S CAR / EXT. BANGOR
          STREET - DAY)

          Milk, laundry, lightbulbs, etc.  Somebody's having a big
          day.  The VIEW WIDENS TO REVEAL:


          JOHNNY

          crossing items off his to-do list, his scrap of paper
          braced against the steering wheel as he drives.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I need... light bulbs... razor
                          blades... stamps...

          Johnny rolls to a stop at the light.


          AT THE LIGHT

          A hot little car pulls up alongside at the light.  The
          WOMAN behind the wheel makes brief eye contact with Johnny. 
            Striking, late twenties, there's something about her. 
          Johnny smiles politely.  She smiles back.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to himself)
                          I definitely need one of those.

          Just when Johnny thinks he might have a little thing going
          here, her expression changes as she reacts to something
          beyond Johnny, a flash of concern crossing her face. 

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something I said?!

          The light changes and he starts forward into the
            intersection, when suddenly...


          BAM! A PEDESTRIAN

          Comes flying out of nowhere, running against the light,
            careening off Johnny's right front bumper.  The guy hits
          hard, a heavy gym bag absorbing the impact.  Johnny hops
          out to check on the guy, but he's already hurrying away.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - TEASER - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  2.


    1CONTINUED:1

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey!  You okay?!  WAIT!

          The woman guns it, cutting Johnny off as she blows through
          the intersection.  We don't know it yet, but she's
            following that guy.

          Johnny watches both of them vanish into traffic, wondering
          if the whole world's gone mad. 


  22EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY - LATER

          Johnny pulls into a space and gets out.  He walks around
          his car to inspect the area the pedestrian bounced off
          of, discovering a small crease in the fender.  Curious,
          he reaches out and touches the dent, triggering:


  33VISION: RIFLE SCOPE POV - FROM INT. ABANDONED BUILDING -
          DAY

          Crosshairs pan off a distinctive billboard, then begin
          floating from window to window of an office building before
          settling on a VICTIM, a MAN in a coat and brimmed hat.

          As the targeted man snaps open the window blinds, the
          gunman fires twice, hitting the intended victim, killing
          him instantly.

          The VISION PERSPECTIVE SHIFTS, pulling back through the
          scope to reveal the gunman, wearing the jacket, cap, and
          gloves of the PEDESTRIAN.  But when the gunman looks up
          from the scope and turns to reveal his face, IT'S JOHNNY,
          having a first-person vision.


  44EXT. OFFICE BUILDING FROM VISION - STREET LEVEL - DAY

            A multistory office building surrounded by other tall
          buildings.  Johnny stands in front, turning in a slow
          circle, trying to determine where the gunman might be as
          he talks to Walt on the phone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm standing out in front of the
                          building as we speak.  It's a
                        little creepy.


  55INTERCUT: INT. WALT'S OFFICE - DAY - WALT

          Talking to Johnny on the phone as he heads for the door.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - TEASER - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  3.


    5CONTINUED:5

                                        WALT
                        Can you tell where the shots come
                        from?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't be sure.  Wait!

          Johnny sees THE MAN WITH THE BRIMMED HAT stride into the
          main entrance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt, I see him.

                                        WALT
                        The shooter?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The victim.  I gotta go...

          Johnny heads into the building after the intended Victim.

                                        WALT
                        Johnny?  Hello?
                                  (frustrated)
                        I'm gonna have to stop takin'
                        these calls.

          He grabs his jacket and takes off.


  66INT. OFFICE BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

          Johnny ducks into the lobby just in time to see the Victim
          slip into a crowded elevator as the doors shut. 


  77INT. OFFICE BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DAY - MOVING

          As Johnny races up the stairwell.


  88INT. OFFICE BUILDING - SEVENTH FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

          DING.  The elevator doors open, revealing the oblivious
          Victim with the distinctive hat.  He heads down the hall
          toward a large formal entry for "P.T.S. INSURANCE".

          Just as the Victim exits frame, a winded Johnny blows
          through the fire escape door.  He catches a glimpse of
          the entry door swinging shut.  He rushes for the door...          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - TEASER - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  4.


  99INT. INSURANCE OFFICE - OUTER LOBBY - DAY

          Upscale corporate waiting room, large enough for a
            RECEPTIONIST and a GUARD.  The receptionist buzzes Victim
          through the door to the inner offices.  Just as the door
          shuts behind him, Johnny enters through the outer door --
          and is stopped cold by the Guard.

                                        GUARD
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Can I help
                        you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did a guy go by here wearing a
                        hat?

                                        GUARD
                        Do you have an appointment?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, there's something very bad
                        about to happen.  A man is going
                        to be shot.

          The Guard exchanges a concerned look with the receptionist,
          then subtly draws a canister of pepper spray.

                                        GUARD
                        I'm going to ask you to step
                          outside.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You don't understand, there's
                        going to be a shooting...

                                        GUARD
                                (re: pepper spray)
                        I will use this...

          Johnny makes a bold decision.  He grabs a clipboard off
          the counter and holds it up as he reaches over and buzzes
          himself in.  The Guard blasts the pepper spray, which
          Johnny deflects with the clipboard as he rushes through
          the inner-office door.  The Guard coughs after catching
          some of the spray deflected back off the clipboard.


  1010INT. INSURANCE OFFICES - DAY - MOVING WITH JOHNNY

          As he rushes down the corridor checking each office,
          bumping into startled secretaries and office workers as
          he goes --




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - TEASER - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  5.


    10CONTINUED:10

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry.  Excuse me.  Look out!

          Then Johnny spots the Victim crossing the hallway at the
          far end of the corridor.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mister!  You!  Wait!

          Before Johnny can move, he's pushed from behind and knocked
          down as SOMEONE rushes past him.

                                        WOMAN
                        Comin' through!

          Without stopping, she casts a curious glance back at
          Johnny, as he gets up off the floor --

                                        WOMAN
                        Sorry.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (taken aback)
                        You?

          It's the WOMAN from the car earlier.  She keeps moving.


  1111SNIPER POV (FROM INT. ABANDONED BLDG. ACROSS THE STREET) -
          DAY

          As he zeros in on the MAN IN THE HAT, the intended Victim
          is suddenly knocked out of harm's way.


  1212EXTREME ON THE GUNMAN'S EYE (INT. ABANDONED BLDG. - DAY)

          Looking up from the scope, a single eye betraying surprise.


  1313JOHNNY AND THE GUARD (INT. INSURANCE OFFICES - DAY)

          Rush into the office as the intended Victim and his rescuer
          untangle themselves.  (We'll learn later her name is ALEX.)

                                        ALEX
                        You all right?

                                        VICTIM
                        What the hell is your problem?

          She attempts to straighten his crushed hat.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - TEASER - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  6.

                                        ALEX
                        Your hat kind'a took a hit.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Everybody stay away from the
                          windows.  The gunman might still
                        be out there.

                                        VICTIM
                        Gunman?  Would somebody please
                        tell me what's going on?

                                        ALEX
                                (to Johnny)
                        You saw him, too?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who are you?

          The Guard hurries into the room.

                                        GUARD
                          Alright, both of you outside!

          The Guard hustles them both out into the corridor full of
          CURIOUS OFFICE WORKERS.  Alex scans the hallway ahead.

                                        GUARD

                        have a previous engagement.
                                (to Johnny)
                        See you later.

          She smiles, then bolts away up the corridor.  The Guard
          is too old and too slow to give chase.

                                        GUARD
                        I know what you look like, young
                        lady!

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't suppose you'd consider
                        writing this off as a failed
                          security drill?

          The Guard slaps a handcuff on his wrist.

    1414GUNMAN'S POV (FROM INT. ABANDONED BUILDING) - DAY

          Looking down into the window of the insurance agency, the
          room now empty, police tape visible across the door.  The
            viewpoint SNAPS BACK WIDE TO REVEAL:


  1515INT. ABANDONED OFFICE - DAY

          Johnny and Walt stand at the window in an empty floor of
          a building overlooking the insurance building.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is the same view from my
                        vision.  The shooter was here.

          REVEAL the BUILDING MANAGER, standing a few feet behind
          them.

                        Why?

                        The floor was locked up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You always keep empty offices
                          secured?

                                        MANAGER
                        We had an intruder this morning.

          He kneels down and runs his hand along the edge of the
            window...


1616A HONEY BEE - (INT. ABANDONED BLDG. - DAY) - VISION

          Crawling on the back of Johnny's hand.  He swats the bee
          off his hand, but it's just a vision, the scope of which
          widens to REVEAL:


          SAME ROOM - EARLIER

          Johnny is startled to find ALEX suddenly next to him,
          looking off through the window toward the insurance office. 
          Her look shifts, eyes fixed on the edge of the roof. 
          Still in the vision, Johnny follows her look, and sees:


          THE GUNMAN

          From his vision.  As the two of them watch (sharing a
          vision).  The gunman fires at the insurance building,
          killing the Insurance Executive.


          ALEX

          recoils in horror, looking away from the shooting as she
          turns toward Johnny.  SHE LOOKS STRAIGHT AT JOHNNY,
          reacting as if she sees him.

                                        ALEX
                        Who are you? 

          A voice distracts her.

                                        MANAGER
                        Hey!  You can't be in here!

          It's the manager, finding her earlier that day.  As she
          spins to look at him, THE VISION ENDS.


  1717RESUME - INT. ABANDONED OFFICE - DAY - PRESENT TIME

          Johnny finds himself back with Walt and the Manager,
            wondering what the hell that was.

                        In my vision he did.  Something
                          changed. 

          Off their stumped looks.


  17A17AINT. HALLWAY/ABANDONED OFFICE ENTRY DOOR - DAY

          Johnny and Walt step out of the empty office, pausing as
          the Manager locks the door behind them.

                                        WALT
                                (to the manager)
                        Thanks for your time.

          He shakes the manager's hand.

                                        MANAGER
                        No problem.  And it was a pleasure
                        meeting you, Mr. Smith.

          He reaches out to shake Johnny's hand.  Johnny reluctantly
          shakes, triggering:


    17B17BVISION - SAME ENTRY DOORWAY - EARLIER

          The Manager escorts Alex out of the building earlier that
          day, as VISION JOHNNY watches.

                                        MANAGER

                        I was looking for someone.  A man
                        with a black gym bag?

                                        MANAGER
                          I haven't seen him.  Now, if you'll
                        just come this way.

          The Manager takes Alex by the arm and starts walking away
          as THE VISION FREEZES.  Vision Johnny walks around the
          frozen Alex, studying her.  The Manager was right.  She
          is unbelievably hot.

          Then something beyond her catches Johnny's attention.


    17C17CJOHNNY'S POV - STILL IN VISION

          His view crashes in on the distant fire escape door, where
          The Gunman, also frozen in the vision, watches Alex and
          the Manager through the crack of the open door.  Vision
          Ends.


    17D17DRESUME JOHNNY AND WALT - PRESENT REALITY

          Johnny comes out of the vision looking toward the door.

                        He was here.  The gunman.

          Walt and the Manager follow Johnny over to the fire escape
          door, now shut.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He was watching the whole time...
                        he touched this door.

          Johnny reaches out, touching the door where he saw the
            shooter's hand holding the door open, triggering:


    17E17EVISION - BRIEF FLASH - SNIPER'S POV THROUGH SCOPE

            A chaotic POV through a rifle scope settles on a new
          victim, A DOCTOR.  It's too quick to make out any
          identifying details about the location.  We just have
          time to make out the fuzzy bear on his stethoscope before
          the gunman fires two quick shots, killing the doctor.          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT ONE - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  11.


    17F17FRESUME JOHNNY AND WALT - PRESENT REALITY

          Johnny comes out of the vision, turning to Walt.

                        There's going to be another

                        I don't know.  He's got a fuzzy
                        bear on his stethoscope.

                                        WALT
                        Fuzzy bear?

                        This sounds crazy, but it's going
                        to happen... I know it.

                        I'll start the ball rolling, see
                        if I can find a connection between
                        the Insurance agent and this
                        mystery doctor.  I'll call you
                        later.

          A BEE is buzzing Johnny.  He swats at it absentmindedly.

          Walt drives off.

          Surprised, she ducks back out of sight.  Johnny starts to
          walk in her direction.

          SHORT FOOT CHASE

          Alex crosses a busy street.

          Johnny exits the structure behind her.

          Alex heads for a city bus.

          Johnny crosses the same busy street.

          Alex passes the bus, then hooking the bus stop sign pole
          swings herself into the bus just as the doors are closing.

          Johnny runs to catch the bus, but it pulls away.

          Alex, watches him back, giving him a playful smile.  He's
          frustrated for a beat, then gets an idea, crossing the
          street to the bus stop.  He touches the bus stop pole she
          touched.  We hear a small WHOOSH.  A smile crosses Johnny's
          face.

                        go nowhere, Marcel's your man!

          He drives off as Alex scans the area for any sign of
          Johnny, then heads toward the parking garage.

          Johnny looks inside her car, finding generic clutter. 
          CANDY BAR WRAPPERS, CD'S, ETC.  Something tucked under
          the windshield wiper catches his eye, a parking stub for
          a HOTEL SOLEIL VALET.  He takes the stub, touching the
          car, triggering:

          Johnny hears bounding footsteps approaching from inside
          the stairwell door.  He straightens himself briefly, then
          sits back against her car, waiting for --


          ALEX

          Who bursts out of the exit door and runs smack into a
          waiting Johnny, to her shock and dismay.

          Comes out of the vision, back at the instant he touched
          the car, Alex yet to arrive.  He steps over to the
            stairwell door, but as he's about to touch it, he HEARS
          her approaching footsteps.  Stepping back, he straightens
          himself just like in the vision, then sits back against
          her car to wait for her to come through the door.

          As she bounds down the stairs, oblivious to Johnny waiting

          her hand for the door, but when she touches it, she stops
          cold.

            presence?

          A silent beat passes.  Johnny starts to get worried when
          she doesn't come through the door like he saw.  He steps
          up to the door, carefully touching it.  In the split screen
          we see them on both sides of the door, frozen, "listening".

          Pouring out from under the door.  Without warning, a swarm
          rises up around him, and the vision MATCH MOVE MORPHS TO:

          Where the bees rise away from him, regrouping into a dense
          swarm before moving off away from Johnny.

          Johnny follows the swarm across the field, watching in
          horror as it descends on a NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL.  She runs,
          but the bees overtake her, suffocating her like some kind
          of formless dark spirit.

                        It's... good.  Very good.

          Alex smiles as they both enjoy this fleeting moment of
          calm --


  4040EXT. HOTEL - DAY - LATER

          Johnny and Alex walk along the sidewalk.

                                        ALEX
                        Thanks for picking up the check.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's the least I could do,
                          considering you made reservations.

          Johnny notices a bee in front of him and swipes at it.

                                        ALEX
                        What's wrong?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bees.

                                (calm, but...)
                        Where?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's alright, it's gone now. 
                                (noticing)
                        You look like you're going to
                          hyperventilate.

                                        ALEX
                        I have a thing about...  Bees.

                                        JOHNNY
                        In the parking garage.  I had a
                        vision of a little girl... she
                        was attacked by a swarm of bees... 
                                (realizes)
                        That was you.

                        I was seven.  Stung over ninety
                        percent of my body.  I went into
                          anaphylactic shock.  Since then
                        I'm hyper-allergic.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's pretty serious.

                                        ALEX
                        Not if you carry this...

          She pulls an epi pen out of her coat pocket.

                                        ALEX
                        When I first went into shock, my
                        heart stopped, before they revived
                        me. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's when you started seeing
                        things differently?

                                        ALEX
                        Is this where you warn me this
                        town isn't big enough for two
                          psychics?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It does beg the question.  Why
                        Maine?

                        Seemed like a nice place to visit. 
                        It was on my list of things to do
                        before I...

          He's seen into her now and she isn't so easy with it.  A
          HOMELESS MAN approaches them.

                                        HOMELESS MAN

          Alex pulls a few dollars and gently puts them in his hand.

                        There's a shelter two blocks from
                        here.  Hot food and blankets.

          He shuffles away, stealing one last curious glance back. 
          Johnny studies her for a beat.  She's beautiful.

                                        JOHNNY

                        sees everything.  That was you I

                        the same moment in time from
                          different perspectives -- you saw

                        I was coming out of a store when
                          I bumped into this man.  When I
                        turned around, there was this boy
                          standing there, crying, saying
                          something about how his Daddy
                        needed help.  I waited with him
                        until the man returned, but when
                        I asked about it, he looked at me
                        like I was crazy, and when I turned
                        around again, the boy was gone.

                        Wait...

          She hands him the epi-pen.

                                        ALEX
                        When I was a kid, my big sister,
                        Anne, used to tell me if you die
                        in a dream, you'd die in real
                        life.  Just in case.

          Johnny takes the epi-pen in one hand, reaching out to her
          with the other.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ready?

          She nods yes.

          Johnny reaches out and gently grips her arm... but to no
          effect.  She touches his face.

                                        ALEX
                        I've got an idea.

                        Why does that terrify me?

          She composes herself, looking deep into his eyes.  She's
          going to kiss him.

                                        ALEX

          She kisses him passionately, as the connection triggers:


  4444VISION - UNDER A BLUE SKY - DAY

          Alex breaks the kiss and steps back from Johnny, both of
          them finding themselves under a deep blue sky full of
          spectacular white clouds.  (The sky goes from horizon to
          horizon, the ground beneath them dark and shadowy.)

          A sound draws Johnny's attention, and he looks over to
          see...


          VISION ALEX

          Looking up at the blue sky, oblivious to Johnny.  Feeling
            something wet, she raises her hand and sees that it's
            bleeding.  She wheels around, looking right through Johnny. 
          Her breathing becomes labored, her hand going up to her
          throat, tearing at her collar as she tries to get more
          air, coughing and choking with shock induced asthma.

          Johnny's first thought is the epi-pen, and he looks down
          to the hand he's holding it in, but it's gone.  In a
          reflex, he pats himself down wondering where it went,
          then realizes this is a vision -- and there's nothing he
          can do but watch as Alex begins turning blue from lack of
          oxygen.

          She struggles to stay standing but can't, falling to her
          knees, then the ground, her body wracked by spasms as she
          desperately tries to draw a last breath, the anaphylactic
          shock sealing her throat shut.

          Johnny kneels at her side, unable to help her, but still
          wanting to stay close.  He watches as she dies, her body
          convulsing, then growing still, her eyes lifeless.

          Hearing something he looks up and sees:


          ALEX

          Watching from a distance as Johnny kneels over her dead
            vision-self.  Horrified she turns to run, Johnny calling
          after her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Alex!  Wait! 

          But his voice is drowned out by the sound of BUZZING. 
          Johnny looks down toward the sound coming from vision-
          Alex, just in time to see a SWARM OF BEES burst out of
          her mouth, engulfing Johnny, ENDING THE VISION.

          With the Little Boy still leading the way,  Alex passes a
          sign near the elevator -- Pediatric Neurology Ward.

          As Alex and the Boy walk along, she begins to hear
          whispering and muffled laughter.  CHILDREN begin to appear,
          stepping into the hallway, dressed in hospital pajamas --
          at first in ones and twos, but soon a small PARADE of
          sick kids begin to follow her, surrounding her and tugging
          at her, vying for her attention, laughing.  (It's strange,
          not like a scene from a horror movie).  She tries to shush

                        you'll wake up the others...

          The Boy continues pulling Alex along through the growing
          crowd.   As she passes each open door we see the real
          patients in their respective beds.


          THE DOCTOR WITH THE FUZZY BEAR

          on his stethoscope, from Johnny's vision, steps out of a

          That's strange.

                        What's wrong?

                                        ALEX
                        It's him.  It's the boy from my
                        vision.

          Johnny looks down and sees the Little Boy lying peacefully
          in the bed.

          FADE IN:

  6767INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

          Some mother's little boy, now a tangled mess of horrific
          tubes and wires, lies motionless, more dead than alive.

                                        DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        His name is Charlie Munroe. 

          The VIEW WIDENS TO REVEAL the Doctor, Johnny, Alex, and
          Walt, standing vigil outside Charlie's hospital room.

                                        DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        He was playing with some friends
                        on a pond when he fell through
                        the ice.  He was under for nearly
                        20 minutes.  We were able to save
                        his life, but his brain didn't
                          survive.

                                        ALEX
                        He looks so... peaceful.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is he in a coma?

                                        DOCTOR
                        Not exactly.  The ventilator keeps
                        his body alive, but there's no
                        higher cognitive function.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There must be some chance for
                          recovery?

                                        DOCTOR
                        I'm sorry.  The best we can do is
                        not prolong his suffering.

                                        ALEX
                          Wouldn't a person have to be alive
                        to suffer?

          The Doctor is thrown a bit by the question.

                                        DOCTOR
                        His mother signed the papers to
                        have him removed from life support.

                                        WALT
                        And the father?

                                        DOCTOR
                        He refused.

                                        WALT
                        Have you ever had a run in with
                        him?

                                        DOCTOR
                          Several.

          Walt and Johnny share a knowing look...

                                        WALT
                        We have reason to believe he might
                        be planning to kill you.

                                        DOCTOR
                        What?  How do you know?

          Alex touches the boy's hand.

                                        ALEX
                        Charlie told us.

                                        WALT
                        I'm going to need a name and
                        address for the father.

                                        DOCTOR
                        I can put you in contact with the
                        mother, they're recently divorced.

          The doctor and Walt exit, leaving Johnny and Alex behind.

                                        ALEX
                        Maybe you can see something?

          Johnny considers her frustration, then gently reaches out
          and touches Charlie's head, the way only a father imagining
          his own son would.  He shakes his head.


  6868EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - WALT'S PATROL CAR - SUNRISE

          Alex leans up against the outside of Walt's patrol car,
          her eyes shut, exhausted.  She wakes up as Johnny
          approaches, pulling two cups from a paper bag.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We're heading over to the mother's
                        house.

                                        ALEX
                        That's not going to be fun.

          A look passes between them.  It's not often they meet
          somebody who knows what this is like.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why did you take off?  It was me,
                        wasn't it?

                                        ALEX
                        The vision of my death, I've seen
                        it nearly every day since I was a
                        little girl.
                              (a beat)
                        In the vision, there's always
                          somebody trying to help me,
                          somebody I could never quite see...
                        until today.

                        under that particular blue sky.

  6969EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

          Walt's patrol car is parked in front of the Munroe house.

                        We know this is hard for you,

  7070INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - LATER

          Mrs. Munroe sits at the kitchen table.  Alex sits at the
          table with her, comforting her while Johnny and Walt stand.

                                        MRS. MUNROE
                        We were a family once.  Happy, I

                        It was thrown out of court.  Our
                        last hope was arbitration, but we
                        lost.  That's when Frank snapped.

          Mrs. Munroe seems surprised by the question.  So do Walt
          and Johnny.  She's uneasy, but...

                        and found it like this. 

          Johnny steps into the room, touching the debris,
          triggering:


  7272VISION - A QUICK FLASH (INT. BEDROOM - MORNING)

          The father (our gunman), berserk with grief, nearly
          finished destroying his son's room.  He drops to the floor,
          drunk, angry, spent and ultimately weeping.  It's tragic

          Johnny begins working his way around the room, passing
          his hand over the debris, looking for visions.


  7474ALEX - CONTINUOUS - VISIONS MIXED WITH REALITY

            Something catches her eye, distracting her.  A small
          crucifix on the floor.  She picks it up, gently setting
          it on a table.  Turning her attention back to the room
            something new catches her attention --  another crucifix,
          up on the wall.  She reacts, "Was that there before?" 
          Now she notices a statue of the Virgin Mary.  And another
            crucifix.  The room seems suddenly full of icons.

          visible is the crucifix Alex set on the table.  Alex looks

                        to be worshiped.

          She shows them a photograph on the refrigerator.


          TIGHT ON THE PHOTO

          A first Communion picture of Charlie and his parents posing
          with a smiling priest, FATHER ANDREW.

                        This was taken at Charlie's first
                        Communion.  After the accident,
                        Frank begged Father Andrew for a

          A small group of PARISHIONERS pray as a PRIEST approaches
          the alter to begin services.  The VIEW CONTINUES on,
          finding FRANK MUNROE sitting in the back row of the church,
            kneeling, seemingly in prayer.  He makes a final sign of
          the cross, then stands, picking up the gym bag as he walks
          unseen to the staircase that leads to the balcony.

          Walt looks, but of course nothing is there.  Alex begins
          walking toward the back door.  Johnny stops her.

          Alex looks to the back door, where little Charlie beckons
          her with his sad eyes, then turns, disappearing into the
          church.

                        know where Frank might be.

          Moved by his concern, Alex turns to Johnny and touches
          his face reassuringly.

          Walt, Johnny, and Alex slip through a side door at the
          back of the church, moving very carefully as they keep an
          eye out for Munroe.

          All three are startled when the back door opens behind
          them, another half-dozen Parishioners arriving for mass.

          Alex sees the Little Boy at the top of a nearby staircase. 
            Oblivious to everything else, she follows the Boy up the
          stairs, drawn by the power of her vision.

  8282JOHNNY AND WALT - INT. CHURCH - DAY

          As they struggle to deflect a growing number of PEOPLE
          from entering the church without making a scene.  Johnny
          turns back to check on Alex, just in time to see her turn
          the corner at the first landing, disappearing around the
          bend as she continues upward.

    8383FOLLOWING ALEX (INT. CHURCH - DAY)

          Up the stairs, moving cautiously as she reaches the doorway
          to the balcony.  She looks out across the balcony, finding
          it empty.  Then she sees,


  8484CHARLIE (INT. CHURCH - DAY) - ALEX VISION

          Peeking at her from inside a sanctuary off to the side of
          the main balcony.  As soon as she sees him, he turns and
            continues on, disappearing deeper into the sanctuary.


  8585RESUME ALEX (INT. CHURCH - DAY)

            Following Charlie, compelled by the vision.  Unafraid,
          she enters the sanctuary.


  8686INT. CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY

          Alex finds herself in a small windowless room, lit entirely
          by a large display featuring hundreds of devotional
          candles, each one representing a prayer for the dead.

          She looks around the small room, but Charlie is nowhere
          to be seen.

    86CONTINUED:86

          Behind her, a shadow moves, darting out of the sanctuary --
          Frank Munroe.  Suddenly, the door slams shut, locking her
          inside.  She tries the door.  It's locked.  As she turns
          back to face the candles and size up her situation, we
          can see the panic growing in her face as it becomes harder
          and harder to breathe.  She realizes she's having a
          reaction to something.  Something big.


  8787JOHNNY - CONTINUING UP THE STAIRS (INT. CHURCH - DAY)

          Reaching the balcony door.  He pushes the door open and
          sees...

          Munroe kneeling at the edge of the balcony, his gun resting
          on the railing as he FIRES three quick shots.  Turning
          away from the carnage below, he sees Johnny, and raising
          his gun FIRES -- ending what we now know is a VISION.

          He comes out of the vision, taking a beat to regain his
          composure.  A noise draws his attention toward the
            sanctuary door where he sees...


          FRANK MUNROE

          Hunkered down on the floor, beginning to assemble his
          gun.  Behind him, the door knob to the sanctuary RATTLES.


          JOHNNY

          Ducks back out of sight to think, considering his lack of
          options.


  9090INT. CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          As the candles continue to burn brightly around her, Alex
          tries the lock again, driven by a desperate need to
          breathe.  In a burst of panic and frustration, she shakes
          the door violently, clawing at the lock, cutting herself
          in the process.

          She looks down at the gash in her hand, and for a moment,
          forgets about breathing when she realizes the cut in her
          hand is just like the one in her recurring vision.

          As she looks up from her hand, the asthma-like attack
          comes back with a vengeance.  She knows she doesn't have
          long before she passes out, dropping to her knees, knocking
          over some of the candles as she goes down.  The room spins
          and she finds herself on the floor, looking up at the
          ceiling, reacting with awe at what she sees.


          ALEX'S POV - A DARK BLUE SKY WITH WHITE CLOUDS

          The blue sky from her vision turns out to be a fresco
          painted on the domed ceiling of the sanctuary.


          ALEX

          Lips turning blue from lack of oxygen, she sees:


          A CANDLE ON THE FLOOR

          with an unmistakable honeycomb pattern in the wax.  The
          label on the bottom of the candle reads: "100% real
          beeswax" above a honey bee logo.


          ALEX

          Looks at the cut on her hand, the ceiling, the candles --
          and somehow has the presence of mind to shake her head at
          the irony, even cracking a smile through her agony.  If
          she could draw a breath, she'd laugh.  Fortunately, now
          that she knows what the problem is, she has a solution,
          reaching into her pocket for her epi-pen.

          But it's not there.  She checks and re-checks her pocket,
          the smile gone from her face as she thinks back...

    9393MEANWHILE - INT. CHURCH BALCONY - DAY

          Johnny peeks through the balcony door, watching as Munroe
          calmly finishes assembling his rifle.  Munroe sits on the
          floor with his back against the sanctuary door.

          From where he is, Johnny can see the Mass down below as
          well.  He notices Walt below, pulling people quietly out
          of harm's way.

          Johnny looks back at Munroe who finishes loading his rifle,
          gets up and starts to cross the balcony.  Johnny can see
          that Munroe will get there before everyone is safe below.

          Thinking fast, Johnny fishes into his pocket, coming up
          with a handful of change.  Just as Munroe is about to
          discover Walt speaking to Father Andrew at the alter,
          Johnny throws his handful of coins off into the shadows
          at the back of the balcony.  The loud noise distracts
          Munroe, turning him around.


          JOHNNY

          Reaches into his pocket and comes up with another handful
          of coins, and something else, the epi-pen, triggering:

          then follows her gaze up past him to the ceiling, seeing
          the blue sky as the VISION ENDS.

          Still looking in the direction of the noise, satisfies
          himself that nobody is there, then finishes his walk to

                        He's just a kid.  Insurance company
                        turned him out.  Doctors want to
                        pull the plug... even God looked
                        away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But she didn't.  She saw him
                        exactly like he was.

                                        MUNROE
                        Who?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The woman behind that door.  She's
                        a psychic, Frank.

                                        MUNROE
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know it sounds strange, but
                        it's true.  She sees people in
                        pain, people in the darkest times
                        of their lives.  She saw Charlie. 
                        He led us here... to you.

          Munroe wrestles internally.

                                        MUNROE
                        Why should I believe you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Open that door.  You're going to
                        find my friend on the floor. 
                        Dying.

                                        MUNROE
                        How?

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's having an allergic reaction
                        and she needs this medicine.

          He holds up the epi-pen.

                                        MUNROE
                        Why should I listen to you?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Because, if she dies, she'll never
                        be able to tell you why Charlie
                        sent her.

          Munroe considers things, his eyes filling with tears...

                                        MUNROE
                        He was such a good kid.  It
                          shouldn't have happen to him, it
                        should have happened to me.

          Slowly lowers his gun, just slightly, keeping it trained
          on Johnny as he opens the door behind him.

          Inside, just like Johnny said, he finds Alex on the floor,
          barely hanging on as she looks up at him.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT FOUR - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  53.

                                        MUNROE
                        Can you hear me?

          Munroe searches her desperate eyes, thinking a beat before
          turning back to Johnny.

                                        MUNROE
                        All right.  Give it to her.
                                (then louder)
                        But you try anything, I'll kill
                        you both.

          WALT

          Stealthily approaching from the other side of the balcony,
          cocks his gun, inching forward for a clean shot.


    100100JOHNNY - INT. CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY

          Rushes to Alex's side.  He pulls the cap off the epi-pen
          with his teeth and jabs it in her thigh.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, I bet you thought I forgot
                        about you?  It's okay... just
                        relax and let it do its job.


          ALEX

          Goes rigid, every muscle in her body contracting as the
          epinephrine courses through her veins, purging her blood
          of the bee allergen.  Almost instantly, she sucks in a
          huge breath as her throat begins to open.


          MUNROE

          Watches Alex come back to life, his gun still pointed at
          Johnny.

                                        MUNROE
                        She okay?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think so... thank you, Frank.

          Alex nods yes, then looks to Munroe, grabbing his leg. 
          She works hard to speak between gulps of air.

                                        MUNROE
                        What's she saying?

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT FOUR - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  54.


    100CONTINUED:100

          He eases down close to listen, as Alex fights to speak.

                                        ALEX
                        Charlie... wanted to tell you...
                        don't be sad... he's okay... will
                        see him again someday...

          Munroe considers this for a beat, then raises his gun
          angrily.

                                        MUNROE
                        You think I'm somekind'a fool?

          Walt appears behind Munroe, but Johnny raises his hand to
          keep him away.

                                        ALEX
                                (still fighting for
                                air)
                        He said he's sorry...  about your
                          camera...

          Stunned, Munroe can't seem to move.

                                        MUNROE
                        My camera?...  How could you...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Camera?

                                        MUNROE
                        I got it for my birthday.  Charlie
                        took it without asking.  He had
                        it around his neck when he fell
                        through the ice. 

          Munroe finally breaks down.

                                        MUNROE
                        I just want him back, that's all. 
                        I just want my little boy.

                                        ALEX
                        He knows that.  He knows how much
                        you love him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Give me the gun, Frank.  Let's
                        end this before somebody get's
                        hurt.

          Frank slowly offers the gun to Johnny.  Walt deftly arrests
          Frank, who offers no resistance.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT FOUR - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  55.

          Johnny kneels down next to Alex, who looks up.  Above
          them, a beautiful blue sky full of white clouds, frozen
          in time, their power over her gone.

                                        ALEX
                        I've never seen a more beautiful
                        sky.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, it's one of kind alright.


  101101INT. CHARLIE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

          Charlie remains suspended between life and death, his
          mother sitting at his side, rubbing his hand lovingly.

          The VIEW WIDENS to reveal Johnny and Alex, standing across
          the bed from her.

                                        MRS. MUNROE
                        I want to thank you for what you
                        did for Frank.  He's not a bad
                        man...

                                        ALEX
                        I know.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What about Charlie?

                                        MRS. MUNROE
                        I've decided I'm not going to
                        sign those papers.  Not after
                        everything that's happened.  I
                        just don't know how I'm going to
                        get up every day and face this.

          She heads for the door...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mrs. Munroe?

          She stops and turns.  Johnny steps to her and gives her a
          hug, taking a moment to whisper something in her ear.

          Alex wipes tears from her eyes as Mrs. Munroe looks up at
          Johnny, smiling and patting his hand.

                                        MRS. MUNROE
                        Thank you.

          She walks away.  As Johnny glances back at Alex.


  102102EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY - LATER

          Johnny and Alex walk out of the Emergency Room exit and
          head for her car, Alex almost fully recovered by now.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sure you're going to be okay?

                                        ALEX
                        The sun is shining, the birds are
                        singing...

          She notices a parking ticket on the windshield of her car
          and picks it up.

                                        ALEX
                        And I got a parking ticket.  What
                        more could a girl ask for?

          They share a smile.  It's awkward.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I wish you'd reconsider and stick
                        around for a few days.

                                        ALEX
                        I would... but a funny thing
                          happened on the way to my death. 
                          Somebody gave me back the rest of
                        my life.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I guess you'll just have to go
                        live it then.

                                        ALEX
                        Yea, I guess so.

          Another awkward BEAT, then...

                                        ALEX
                        Look, I'm not very comfortable at
                        good-byes.  Usually, I just take
                        off before things get too deep.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that what this is... too deep?

          They lean in like they're going to kiss, but both hesitate --
          apparently wary of touching again.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT FOUR - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  57.

          They retreat back into their own personal space, then at
          the same time they grab each other and kiss.  When they
          finally break, they seem to each take an individual
            inventory of themselves...

                          Absolutely.  How could two people
                        that can see everything about
                        each other ever hope to keep a

                        There would be no surprises.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No anticipation.

                        Nobody could make that work.

          There's another lull, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It might be fun trying, though.

          Alex's expression says it all.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT FOUR - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  58.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're right.  We've both got
                        work to do.

          She gets in her car.

                                        ALEX
                        Can I ask you something?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something you don't already know?

                                        ALEX
                        What did you say to her?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who?

                                        ALEX
                          Charlie's mother.  You whispered
                          something to her.  What was it?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (beat)
                        I told her it was time for her to
                        rest... I told her she'd done
                        everything she could do and the
                        rest was up to God.

          She smiles in agreement, studying Johnny one last time.

                                        ALEX
                        You aren't what I expected.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Back at ya.

          And off she drives.  The SHOT PULLS HIGH AND WIDE as Johnny
          walks off alone, his fate and those of countless others
          still resting firmly on his shoulders.
