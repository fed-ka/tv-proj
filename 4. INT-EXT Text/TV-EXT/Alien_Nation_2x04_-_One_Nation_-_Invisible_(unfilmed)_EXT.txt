      Police tape surrounds the shooting site, keeping out 
      spectators. A coroner's truck and several police units are 
      already on the scene as Sikes and George pull up and get 
      out of the car.

                    Y'see? It's exactly the reason I don't have 
                    cards.

                    The reason you don't have cards Matthew, is 
                    that you are irresponsible. For you, credit 
                    cards are dangerous. I, on the other hand, 
                    have been meticulous in my payments.

      ... Around Union Station, with its darkened warehouses, 
      streets void of light's or traffic, and a sleeping derelict 
      in, an abandoned portal. A VAN is parked alone on the 
      street. A tire and Jack lay alongside. A man leans against 
      the van, smoking a cigarette, waiting. REVEAL it's RIDER. 
      He's cool, patient. The SOUND of FOOTSTEPS can be heard. 
      From a distance a figure comes out of the shadows. It's

      Rider shrugs, leads his over to the van, begins to unlock 
      the back door. As they wait, a MUTT approaches and begins 
      to sniff Sikes. Rider opens the door, reaches into a box       and looks back at the dog whining and jumping on Sikes.

                                  GEORGE
                    A name. Any name. Anybody you can think 
                    of--

                                  DIRECTOR'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Lance Masters...!

                                  BARNEY
                    Look, the director's gonna got really 
                    mad... I can't help you. I'm sorry, really 
                    sorry.

      The actor hurries of off. As George watches him leave                                  GEORGE
                    So there is no Barney Rutherford, Chairman 
                    of the Board...

                                  SUSAN
                    Lance personifies the family image everyone 
                    seems to want.

                                  GEORGE
                    You're perpetuating a myth, Susan.

                                  SUSAN
                    It's what we call a pneumonic device. Like 
                    the mermaid on the tuna.

                                  GEORGE
                    The mermaid hasn't declared me dead.

      He walks off.


      waiting. Suddenly a limousine pulls up in front of him. A 
      door opens.

                                  RIDER
                            (inside car)
                    In.

                                  SIKES
                    What's this? I thought you said--

                                  RIDER
                    I said got in.

      Sikes complies, getting in. Door closes behind him and the 
      limo speeds off.

      ANGLE ON SURVEILLANCE VAN

      as, it pulls out from its hiding place, and blends in with 
      the traffic flow.


      as limo makes a left turn into an alley, and van continues       on Limo doesn't complete the turn. Instead it makes a U 
      turn an drives off in the opposite direction.

      NEW ANGLE - VAN - CONTINUOUS

      as it turns in another street, doubles back and approaches 
      the alley where they last saw the limo. Van approaches 
      slowly.


      An impressive, intimidating mass of steel and glass.


      Over sign reading "Latimer Casket Co". we HEAR:

                              (whispering)
                    This is a wild goose chase, George. We're 
                    wasting - George?


      Sikes and Cathy are snuggled close together, looking at the 
      movie section of the paper.

                                  CATHY
                    Here's a good one. Starts in a half hour.

                    You really want to go out?

                    Not really.

                    still there?

                      Fortunately for us, it's on the fritz. And 
                    even if it weren't, it would've dissolved 
                    by now.

                                  CATHY
                    In that case, maybe we should stay in... 
                    rent another movie...
