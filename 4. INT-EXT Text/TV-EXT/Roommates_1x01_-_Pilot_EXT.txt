    THOM AND MARK ARE WAITING ON A TRAIN PLATFORM, STANDING 
    BESIDE ONE OF THOSE SMALL COFFEE BOOTHS. 

                                MARK

                She s with this guy called Ben at 

                present but, reading between the 

                lines, I reckon that s rocky. All I 

                have to do is wait. 

                                THOM

                Wait? Let me say something here, Mark. 

                Women respect a powerful man. That's 

                why I took up archery. Women respect a 

                man with imagination. That's why I 

                read fantasy fiction. Women do not, 

                however, respect a man who has been 

                building up to making his move for six 

                and a half years.

                That's why I didn't do that and I 

                never would. 

                                MARK

                But at least if I get into the house, 

              I can&                                 ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              13.



                                THOM
                      (nodding)

                Live on the same territory, establish 

              a day to day rapport - sure. But then 

                surprise her with some subtle token of 

                your affection. Something classy. 

    PAUSE. THOM THINKS.

                                THOM (CONT D)

                Remember that film we saw where the 

                guy makes up to his wife by wrapping 

                flowers around his genitals?

                                MARK

                Yes.

                                THOM

                Would she like that?

                                MARK

                Katie?

                                THOM

                Sure.

                                MARK

                No.

                                THOM

                Not the flowers kind, eh? Tricky. 

                Tricky.                                 ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              14.



                                MARK

              I was thinking more, you know. We'd be 

                watching TV one night, and gradually 

                her head would rest onto my shoulder, 

                and she'd nuzzle my neck and start to 

                kiss me. And then she'd take my hand 

                and lead me to her room. And then...

                                THOM
                      (captivated by the story)

                And then what..?

                                MARK

                And then we'd have sex.

                                THOM

                Great! I did not see that coming. 

    THE COFFEE WAITRESS BEHIND THE COUNTER IS A 22 YEAR OLD, WHO 
    LOOKS LIKE SHE WOULD BE VERY GLAMOROUS ON HER DAYS OFF. SHE 
    IS WELL GROOMED AND HARD EDGED. 

    SHE LEANS FORWARD AND PLONKS A COFFEE IN FRONT OF MARK. MARK 
    LOOKS AT THE CUP OF COFFEE. 

                                MARK

                Umm& sorry. I think I ordered a cup of 

                tea. 

    THE WAITRESS LOOKS BLANKLY BACK AT HIM. 

                                MARK (CONT D)

                This is coffee. 

                                  WAITRESS
                    (as if Mark is being 
                        staggeringly petty)

                It's a hot drink.                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              15.



                                MARK

                Well, may I have a cup of tea instead 

                please?

    THE WAITRESS SHAKES HER HEAD, AND GROANS IN PROTEST LIKE AN 
      ADOLESCENT. SHE GOES TO THE BACK OF THE COFFEE BOOTH AND 
    STARTS TO PREPARE ANOTHER DRINK.  

    MARK STANDS AGOG FOR A WHILE.

                                THOM

                This is all part of the same thing, 

                Mark. You let women walk all over you. 

                Stop being so nice. As soon as that 

                bitch comes back I want you to give 

                her hell!

                                  WAITRESS

                There's your tea, sir. 

    SHE HANDS OVER THE ACCOMPANYING PAPER NAPKIN. 

                                  WAITRESS (CONT D)

                And there's your prize for being this 

                week's most anal customer. 

                                MARK

                Thank you. Thanks, very much.

    THE WAITRESS TUTS AND PROCEEDS BACK. 

    MARK TURNS TO SEE THOM SHAKE HIS HEAD.  

    MARK RAPS HIS HAND ON THE COUNTER.

                                MARK (CONT D)

                Erm&excuse me.

                                  WAITRESS

                What?                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              16.



                                MARK

                Excuse me& I'm sorry. I don't like 

                your attitude.

                                  WAITRESS

                What's wrong with my attitude?

                                MARK
                      (warming up)

                It's bad. It's a bad attitude. 

                                  WAITRESS

                So?

                                MARK

                So, I think we need to talk&

                                                                            FADE TO:

                                MARK (CONT D)
                      (relaxed)

                You probably don't think this is 

                really your job, do you? You're not 

                really just a coffee-vendor. You're 

                waiting for your break in television, 

              or advertising, somewhere where you 

                can be pretty and bright for a living. 

                Well, I think you should know: you're 

                not that pretty, and my guess is 

                you're not that bright&

                                                                            FADE TO:

                                MARK (CONT D)
                      (animated)

                You, you're going nowhere fast. 

                                  (MORE)                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              17.

                                  MARK(CONT D)

                You'll be here till promotion takes 

                you to the giddy heights of sandwich 

                manager, or Keith from corporate puts 

                you in charge of the latte machine.

                                                                            FADE TO:

                                MARK (CONT D)
                      (absolutely masterful)

                So, until that day you should try and 

                remember I am customer; you are coffee 

                attendant. Please, learn to 

                distinguish between the only two hot 

                drinks you have to serve. By the way, 

                that's tea, that's coffee.

                                THOM
                      (pointing at his drink)

                And that's hot chocolate.

                                MARK
                      (ignoring Thom)

              So for pity's sake, keep your 

                sarcastic comments to yourself in 

                future. Because you piss me off. Good 

                day.

    MARK WALKS AWAY. 

    THE CAMERA CLOCKS THE COFFEE ATTENDANT. A SINGLE TEAR 
      TRICKLES DOWN HER CHEEK. 

                                THOM

                That was totally amazing.                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              18.
