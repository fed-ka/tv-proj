We open on a GUARD sitting in front of a sentry post. He is
wearing a heavy fur hat that covers his ears and a military-
jacket. Behind him is a list of instructions (in Russian).
He 'sucks in a cigarette as though he's a drowning man lookin
for oxygen. A CAR comes to a stop by the sentry post, the,
guard looks, asks a couple of questions and is given an
-envelope which he quickly examines, he then attempts to stick
his head in the car. A gun barrel is promptly stuck in his
face and a couple of angry words emanate from the back, the
guard jumps back and quickly raises the barrier.
This next section will be intercut with the credit sequence.

...And the whip pan shot takes us into this boxing ring.
Meet TURKISH, he is Tommy's partner. Turkish is older and
wiser than Tommy, they are both watching Gorgeous go through
his paces. Gorgeous George is head butting a heavy punch
bag. The sound that emanates is disturbing, and Tommy is
distracted.
TOMMY
Is he allowed to do that?
Turkish is drinking milk from a bottle
TURKISH
It's an unlicensed boxing match Tommy,
not a tickling competition. These
lads are out to hurt each other.
GORGEOUS GEORGE
Oi Turkish, can I have a drink?
Turkish looks over his shoulder and then points to himself

What do I look like to you George, a
fuckin water boy?
Turkish looks at the WATER BOY.
TURKISH (CONT'D)
Oi son, look lively.
He turns .back to Tommy.
TURKISH (CONT'D)
Look at it.
He turns to see the remnants of a caravan where they keep
the training gear and administration for the fights
TURKISH (CONT'D)
How am I supposed to run this thing
from that? We gonna need a proper
office.
He looks at the caravan again and sighs, it is quite pitiful
TURKISH (CONT'D)
I want a new one Tommy and you 're
going to buy it for me.
TOMMY
What's wrong with this one?
Turning back to Tommy and ascending the steps in to his "I
have seen better days" caravan, TURKISH'S foot goes through
one of the stairs and the.door comes off at the hinges as he
tries to open it.
TURKISH
Oh nothing Tommy, it's tip top, it's
just I am not sure about the colour.
He passes him a piece of paper
TURKISH (CONT'D)
Here it's all arranged. You just
gotta pick it up. Here's an address.
Tommy looks at the address and frowns.
TOMMY
I t ' s that campsite.
TURKISH
That's right, you're buying a caravan,
caravans live in campsites.

TOMMY
They aren't pikey are they?
TURKISH
I don't know what they are, all I
know is they have a caravan, and we
want a Caravan.
TOMMY
I hope they're not pikies.
I hate
fucking pikies.
TURKISH
You're a sensitive boy, ain't you
Tommy? You got ten grand and I want
to see change.
He is distracted by the bulge in Tommy's trouser front.
TURKISH (CONT'D)
Fuck me, hold tight, what's that?
TOMMY
It's my Gucci belt, Turkish.
Pointing quite clearly at the gun.
TURKISH
No Tommy, there's a gun in your
trousers. What is a gun doing in
your trousers?
TOMMY
It's for protection.
TURKISH
Protection from what, the Germans?
The war ended fifty years ago. Err
what's to stop it blowing your balls
off every time you sit down? Where
did you get it?
Looking down onto his gun.
TOMMY
Boris the Blade.
TURKISH
You mean Boris the sneaky fucking
Russian.
Turkish pulls the gun out of Tommy's front.

CUT TO: CU OF GUN CHAMBER
We cut to an enormous and frightening looking dog sniffing
the half eaten prawn sandwich, before he is yanked away by
his master. The dog is a lively young thing. We raise the
camera to see the man that is walking it. Meet VINNY. Vinny
is a very large black man - the size is due to dumplings not
dumbbells. He .stops outside a shop. We see it clearly.
I t ' s a pawnbrokers.

Gorgeous George fastens the caravan to the back of their
Land Rover and pulls away. They wave at Micky and he
reciprocates.
MICKY
He's a good dog. He'll get a little
homesick for a while but he'11 get
over it.
Tommy has a dog that looks distressed about leaving Micky
sitting next to him.
17
They are looking at the damage.
Of course i t ' s completely
useless now.
. GORGEOUS GEORGE
I don't think it's supposed to have
done that.

The dog is behind Micky's legs happy to be back.
MICKY
The deal was you bought it how you
saw it.
Tommy goes to interrupt but he doesn't get a chance
MICKY (CONT'D)
Look, I have helped ya as much as I
am gonna help ya. You still got a
car and I suggest you use it before
you're not welcome anymore.
There is a silence for a while. The atmosphere has gone
more than frosty and a few more gypsies are hanging around.
GORGEOUS GEORGE
Hey...
Interrupted
MICKY
It was only a question of time before
you got some attention. Nobody brings
a fella the size of you unless they
are trying to say something without
talking.
TOMMY
Just give us my money and you can
keep your caravan.

going? You want to settle this with
a fight?
MUM
You'll do no such thing Michael.
You'll...
MICKY
Alright Mum, we shan't, we'll settle
it some other way, now don't get
upset.
MUM
I won't have you fighting, Micky.
Micky's Mum is getting upset and it's consequently upsetting
Micky.
MICKY
Okay mum okay. You need to sit down.
Micky calls to one of the lads standing by.
MICKY (CONT'D)
Darren look after Mum. Get her
sitting down.
We see Mum being led out by Darren; Micky looks genuinely
concerned for his mum. Pause as Micky waits for her to be
well gone.
MICKY (CONT'D)
I ' l l fight you for it.
Tommy looks at Gorgeous George.
Gorgeous George raises his
eyebrows.

SOL
I am not happy about that dog Vin,
you can't bring a dog on a job.
VINNY
You can't leave him on his own, not
to begin with, he gets homesick.
SOL
Homesick, for fucks sake.
VINNY
He does. If he gets the chance he
runs back to the gypsies' campsite.
SOL
Ohh shut up, how can he find it?
VINNY
I don't know Sol, I am not a dog.
Ask him. It' s like he's got a fuckin
homing beacon. Give him the chance
and he's off.
SOL
You're going soft Vin? Here pass me
a sandwich.
Vin throws a sandwich to Sol but the dog catches it whilst
i t ' s in flight and swallows it in one gulp.
SOL (CONT'D)
Jessssus, he didn't even chew it.
The car has stopped.
VINNY
What have you stopped here for?
What's wrong with that space?
TYRONE
It's too tight.
VINNY
What are you talking about, tight?
You could land a jumbo fuckin jet in
there.
SOL
Leave him alone, he's a natural.
Tyrone gets a little over-excited with the accelerator and
reverses with a crashing sound into the rear of the van behin
them (ie it:s parked back to back with them).

A natural fuckin idiot.
Tyrone,
what have you done?
TYRONE

Tyrone makes to move the van forward again.
VINNY
Well don't move it now, otherwise
people will see the damage. What
did you do that for?
^
TYRONE
I didn't see it there.
VINNY
Eh? It's a four ton truck. It' s
not as though i t ' s a ferret fuckin a
flea is it?
TYRONE
It was at a funny angle.
Vin is confused as to this last statement.
VINNY
Funny angle? It was behind you
Tyrone, whenever you reverse things
come from behind you. I am not happy
Sol.
- The dog starts whining.
VINNY (CONT'D)
Give him something to shut him up.
Sol throws a plastic squeaky dog ball that was in the front.
The dog grabs in and swallows it in one gulp. The brothers
look on in shock.
SOL
He can't swallow a whole ball.
TYRONE
He swallowed it.
The dog looks up having completed the task. Vin who looks
quite alarmed holds the dog by the ribs and squeezes, there
is a squeak.

Doug and Alex are waiting to pick- up Hands.
DOUG
Did you get Hands that car?
ALEX
I got him one like it.
Doug is in shock.
DOUG
What do you mean one like it?
ALEX
I got him the Volante.
DOUG
What did I say? What exactly did I
say?
ALEX
You said get him the Vantage.
DOUG
That's right, I clearly said get him
the Vantage. So why did you get the
Volante?
;
ALEX
Because they look the same.
DOUG
The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
the Hebrew word for "young woman" in
to the Greek word for "virgin",
because they thought they looked the
same, coming up with the prophecy
"behold a virgin shall conceive and
bear a son". But there is a world
of difference between a virgin and a
young woman like there is between a
Volante and a fuckin Vantage.
'.Pause: she thinks about this.
ALEX
Are you saying that the fact that
your cousin Hands is driving a Valiant
instead of a Vantage is a profound a
mistake as a whole religion?
DOUG
Yes I fuckin am!

DOUG (CONT'D)
Cars are his religion. He can drive
a Valiant in the States but I can't
drive a Vantage because they won't
tolerate the emissions. Well, it's
too late now, that's Concorde.
SHOT OF CONCORDE'S WHEELS TOUCHING DOWN
30
Hands and his sidekick Rosebud are coming out of the sliding
glass doors towards Doug who's now standing by the car with
his arms crossed. Hands is quite clearly looking for a car.
DOUG
How about a hug for your old cousin
Doug?
He stops looking for his car and focuses on Doug.
 HANDS
Fuck off you fat bald bastard - and
where's my car?
31
The black guys are sitting in the car still.
The occasional
squeak comes from the dog.
VINNY
How am I going to get it out?
SOL
He'll probably cough it up.
VINNY
Do you think he'll be alright?
Sol shrugs.
SOL
Hope not.
TYRONE
What are we waiting for?
SOL
We are waiting for a man carrying a
case.
(
TYRONE
Why?

SOL
Because the deal is that we give the
Russian the case and we keep the
money.
He rubs his fingers symbolically together
TYRONE
What's in the case?
Sol turns round to talk to Tyrone.
SOL
Fuckin 'ell Tyrone you ask a lot of
questions. You concentrate on the
driving okay?
He turns back just as a MAN is stepping into the bookies: he
is carrying a case.
SOL (CONT'D)
Shit, was that him?
.'
VINNY
Don't ask me, you're the one supposed
to keep an eye on it. How many
fingers did he have?
SOL
Are you serious? I am sorry but I
couldn't get the binoculars out in
time.
VINNY
Well let's not stand on ceremony,
let's start the show.
They get out of the van and go up to the bookies, leaving
Tyrone in the van. There's a double set of glass doors.
Sol pushes them open, and Vinny walks in first, while Sol
hangs back with the shotgun.
32
We see Tyrone grimace at the sound of the shotgun.
34
The Aston Martin comes to a screeching halt outside. Doug
is quite pale from the ride. Hands looks almost satisfied
with the car.
HANDS
...-.!
gotta say it's not bad.
He then looks at the sign of the rundown venue, his eyes
squint incredulously.
HANDS (CONT'D)
Caesar's Palace?
36
(NB: the first half of this scene happens about midway scene
28 - as Tyrone parks the van )
We cut back to Frankie Four Fingers getting out of his van.
He takes a quick look around and enters the back of his van.
There he raises the spare tire and picks up his gun, he
examines it and places it in his trouser front. He then
turns to exit. At which point there is a loud smash and
Franky is knocked backwards (as Tyrone hits his van).
WE CUT TO BLACK.
'
WE FADE UP
(Time-wise, we're now at the end of scene 34)
Frankie wakes up. He has a trickle of blood dripping down
the back of his neck, he looks at his watch and panics. He
kicks the doors a couple of times - nothing happens, but on
the third kick the doors spring open. Franky brushes himself
off and makes his way to the bookies.
39
We cut to Tyrone. Tyrone clocks the case attached to Franky'
wrist. Gets out and slams the end of the gun across Franky
Four Fingers' head. He falls to the ground. Tyrone tries
to take the case off him but i t ' s handcuffed to his wrist.
So he has little choice but to pick him up and throw him in
to the back of the car with the other two.
40
Boris is admiring the outside of the shop.
He walks in.

Turkish pulls up outside his arcade and has a look around:
all seems to be clear.
TURKISH
I ain't going in the front.
TOMMY
I don't think it's a good idea you
going in at all.
The car surges off round the back.
TURKISH
Unless you are going to
transcendentally extract the passports
and cash from out of a steel safe, I
can't see any other way of getting
them. Keep your eyes peeled.
Turkish has another look around the back
TURKISH (CONT'D)
Well I can't see anyone. After I
have got in go round the front and
call me if you see anything.

Turkish adapts to his new circumstances.

Brick Top exits with Errol and John and grimaces with.the

BRICK TOP
He's been a busy little bastard that
Turkish.
ERROL
I think you have let him get away
with enough all ready gov.
Brick Top looks round with some concern.
BRICK TOP
It can get you into a lot of trouble
thinking Errol, I shouldn't do so
much of it.

The film stock is 1970s, and things seem more dated. This
is confirmed by the dress of our man TONY. Tony is standing
outside a scrap metal yard and he is kicking the door of a
portacabin.

TONY
Open up Charlie.
CHARLIE
Fuck off. The only thing I'11 open
up is you.
TONY

lads, and then think how much trouble
you' d be in.
CHARLIE
You come through that door and you'll
be going out prostrate.
TONY
It doesn't belong to you Charlie.
He kicks open the door. CHARLIE is standing behind his desk
holding a pistol directly at Tony. On the table is a bag of
what we must believe is coke, it's open, and Charlie has it
all over his nose.
.
TONY (CONT'D)
You silly fucker, you can't go running
off with other people's gear. How
much you put up your nose?
Charlie opens up, he fires four shots straight into Tony who
buckles and falls to the floor. Tony seems only shaken and
he holds his hands out to inspect them, he's bleeding.
TONY (CONT'D)
Oh you silly cunt.
Tony stands and walks towards Charlie. Charlie is
understandably shocked and fires another. It goes straight
through Tony and we see the blood hit the wall behind.
CHARLIE
Go down-boy, go down.
(CONTINUED)
47
CONTINUED:
Tony keeps going for him. Charlie raises the gun and points
it at Tony's face and fires the last shot. The bullet goes
straight into his mouth but it went in at an angle and it
exits his cheek. Tony is standing there with six. bullet
holes in him and bleeding all over the carpet. As he talks
blood courses its way down his front and a strong lisp is
frustrating the words.
TONY
Ohh you'f in twouble nowf.
Tony slowly extracts a short sword from behind him. Fear
has set into Charlie's face and has rendered him useless.

his eyes, squints and seems to focus on something.
ERROL (CONT'D)
Cheers pal.
Errol puts on the gas a little-, the car surges forward and
slows at the feet of Mullet - seedy looking character with
big ears and a moody haircut, who smokes fat cheap cigars
and wears his top shirt button fastened.
MULLET

I lose I'l l do the fight for free.
Turkish considers this, uneasily.
He looks at the dogs they

Brick Top is waiting there. Brick Top asks questions. We

The dogs are moving in.

The hare gets caught and a pile of fur comes up

The hare escapes the jaws of the dogs and is off.

his wallet. BTT takes out some notes and proffers them to
Mullet, Mullet nervously reaches forward. As quick as you
like Btt has Mullet by the collar and pulls Mullet into the
car. He then raises the electric window on Mullet's throat
until it has fastened Mullet to the roof of the vehicle.
BTT (CONT'D)

Mullet has already gone pink.

Micky is looking at his caravan; it's in flames, real proper
roaring flames. People are desperately trying to put the
flames out. Micky is covered in dirt from his futile efforts.
One of the other pikies who's involved in trying to extinguish
the fire turns round and sees Micky standing there motionless.
He can see he's upset.
PATRICK
What's wrong with Micky?
DAREN
His mam was in there Patrick.
They
burnt his mam.
All real sound recedes and we drift in to music. The camera
slowly tracks in on Micky. It's hard to read how devastated
he is. The camera reaches Micky's face, the reflections of
the flames can be seen in his water swollen eyes, but his
cheeks remain dry.

BTT's car pulls up outside Boris1 house. BTT and Rosebud
pull Boris up in the boot. Tyrone who is hanging about nearb
keeping watch, witnesses this. Rosebud places a blade at
the Russian's neck.

ROSE BUD
I think you have got something to
tell us.
HANDS
Take it easy Rosy, take it easy.
BTT looks at the blood that's already starting to pierce the
skin from where the blade is pressed against the Russian's
neck. BTT then looks at Hands with concern.
BTT
You want him to be able to talk or
not?

TYRONE

He's not on his own.

Tommy and Turkish are looking on to the burned out caravan. .
They are in shock. There is a whole gathering of dodgy,
angry looking pikies standing around, giving Turkish and
Tommy some bad looks.
TURKISH
Jesus I am sorry Micky. I am really
sorry. He's a mad bastard.
Darren decides to interject.
DAREN
Who are these the boys Micky?
Darren's eyes are full of poison.
Tommy and Turkish suddenly
feel very uncomfortable.
MICKY
Back off Darren. What kind of cunt
would turn up here if they knew what
had happened? Leave my business to
me boy.
Darren spins on his heel
MICKY (CONT'D)
I got a message that he wanted me to
fuck you two off, that's why I wanted
you back. I' l l do the fight before
he causes any more carnage, but I ' l l
only do it if you're there.
TURKISH
Why?
MICKY
Because I know he fuckin hates ya. .

Hands, Tony and Rosebud walk out.

The black guys pile out of the car and follow BTT and Hands
at a safe distance.

Tommy and Turkish pull up outside Boris' house.
TURKISH

TOMMY
I shouldn't think that's a good idea.
Shall we have a look?
TURKISH
I don't want to go in there, he's a
dangerous bastard, taken too many
disco biscuits in the heat of Russian
disputations, he's got as many of
these nuts as those nuts.
He grabs his groin and circles his finger and his temple
TOMMY
I don't care if he's got fuckin hazel
nuts, I want a gun that works.
TURKISH
Well come on then before the Germans
get here.

The black guys have followed BTT and Hands and are waiting
outside, readying themselves for action.

SOL
'
.
. Now Tyrone you go... Tyrone, oi
Tyrone.
Tyrone can't hear a thing.
VINNY
I'11 never forgive you Sol.
Sol taps Tyrone on the shoulder.
SOL
When we get in you wait by the door
I am number one, Vin number two and
you are number three.

Darren picks up the phone.
DAREN
.
If you would you like to speak to
your friends, you'll have to speak a
little -louder.

We pull back to see four slumped heads in the car and blood
staining the windscreen. Brick Top calmly puts the phone
down.
BRICK TOP
Right lets get outta here.
Brick Top is looking every which way and trying to get out
of there, accompanied by Ken.
BRICK TOP (CONT.'D)
Where's the car Ken?
KEN
I t ' s coming now.
BRICK TOP
We are outta here.
They come out of a side entrance, their car pulls round the
corner and screeches to a halt. Brick Top opens the door as
he is about to get in, he's eyes widen to the size of saucers
as FOUR MEN (who we recognize from the wake) are sitting in
the place of his driver. They both have sawed-off shotguns
and empty four barrels into the chest of Brick Top and Ken.
The car spins away, leaving their twitching bodies on the
dirt.

The pikies have moved overnight.
SOL

HANDS
Well they aren't fuckin here now are
they? And I can't see a dog can
you?
VINNY
They can't be far.
125
Vinny, Sol, BTT and Hands descend the steps, they look like
children with their toys taken away.
HANDS
You better find me that dog, skinny
Vinny.
One of Micky's kids is on the bottom of the caravan steps as
the brothers walk by.
. KID 1
I looked after your car for ya.
HANDS
So?
KID 1
So aren't you gonna pay me?
BTT
Yeah bollocks.
KID 1
Bollocks to you, you tight git.
VINNY
Watch your mouth you cheeky shite.
KID 1
Yeah fuck ya.
The kid turns away and goes back to squeezing a toy.
All
four of the chaps stop in their tracks.
Cut to shot of squeaky toy. We have seen this toy before.
Cut to freeze frame of Sol, Vin, BTT and Hands stopped dead
in their .tracks. They haven't turned to look over their
shoulders yet, but their eyes are turning to look.
THE END.
