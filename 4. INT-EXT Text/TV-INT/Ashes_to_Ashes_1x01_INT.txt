                    I m on your side Arthur. Those 
                    officers were itching for a

                    I used to be somebody.

                    Who did you call? What could my 
                    parents have to do with this? 
                    They ve been dead a long time.

                    I had an empire going, back in the 
                    day. Dealers on every corner. 
                    Coppers in my back pocket.

                                  ALEX
                    So things went wrong. Do you want 
                    to talk about that? You feel 
                    trapped. I understand. Let me help 
                    you.

      LAYTON smiles. Cruel turn of the mouth. Sounds of water 
      slapping incessantly against the hull.

      Phone rings. LAYTON snaps it open. Listens. His smile falls - 
      this is bad news.

                                  LAYTON
                    Okay .. That s a pity ... hmmmm.. 
                    Right.

      ALEX watches his gun hand drop limply. She senses a 
      resolution. Moves forward.

                                  ALEX

                    Fine ...

    AND HE LIFTS HIS GUN AND SHOOTS HER IN THE HEAD.

    She sees it! Sees the BULLET COMING TOWARDS HER. Has that 
      moment to comprehend her fate. A micro-second before the 
      bullet hits her -

                                                                        SMASH CUT:        Ashes to Ashes - Episode 1 - Shooting Script: PEACH - 31/08/07           8A.



    The painted CLOWN from Bowie s  Ashes To Ashes  video. Peaked

      A SCREAM slices the air. 

                                                                        SMASH CUT:


      ALEX jolts awake. Wearing a short red skirt, white blouse 
      with puff sleeves and with her hair lacquered to within an 
      inch of its life. 

      Panicky, she feels her face - is she bleeding?

      Around her, New Romantic music fills the boat which is now 
      decked in red and white satin. End of an all-nighter.
      Ultravox bounces off the walls. Garish HOOKERS dance with 
      YOUNG MEN in silvery suits. The whole atmosphere is one of 
      decadence and youthful abandon. Even the HOOKERS look like 
      they might be having a good time. 

      ALEX staggers to her feet. A GUY in a pastel shirt tries to 
      grope her and she shoves him away.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      ALEX crashes through the doors on her own two feet. Formica 
    and desk lamps. Electric typewriters. Sheena Easton jostling 
    for wall-space with Kevin Keeganand Trevor Francis. HOOKERS 
    and PUNTERS being processed by smoking DCswho drink her in 
      like beer. ALEX marches into GENE soffice which bears the *
      legend on the door - The MancLion. 

                                                                            CUT TO:        Ashes to Ashes - Episode 1 - Shooting Script: PEACH - 31/08/07           15.



      Film posters on the wall -  Outlaw JoseyWales  and  Every 
      Which Way But Loose.  Plus a commemorative calendar for the 
      engagement of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer.

      A cumbersome Acorn computer beeps on his desk. GENE follows 
      ALEX whilst RAY and CHRIS peer through the window after them. 
      ALEX studies the LED display on the computer.

    Her fingers fly across the computer keyboard.

      SHAZ knocks and enters. A WPCwho mostly handles clerical. 
      Early 20 s, razor-sharp fringe a la Jo Catherallfrom Human

                    statement. Now!

    He wrests the phone from her hand. They tussle. Until ALEX *
      spots something on the desk. She gasps and sinks to her 
      knees. To RAY and CHRIS it looks like she is going down on 
    the Guv.VIV chuckles.

                                  CHRIS
                    God, I love toms.

      ALEX stares at the little plaque on the desk - DIDrake.

      ALEX crawls back against the far wall. She clutches her head 
    and fights the rising tide of sheer panic. They watch her. 
      GENE drags her to her feet.

                                  GENE
                    Come on ...

      A warrant card falls from her coat. He picks it up. Studies 
    it without reacting. Passes it back to her.

      ALEX faces the department, stoic and shocked. The room is 
      awash in sweaty testosterone, fag smoke and menace.

    RAY opposite MARKHAM and his BRIEF. ALEX stands by the door 
      looking dazed. She clutches a set of files which she has been 
      handed - fingers through them distractedly.

      GENE enters with ERIC, a scrawny, twisted young man with 
      hollow eyes.

                                  GENE
                    I assume you two know each other. 
                    Of course you do. This is Eric 
                    Phelps. He s one of your clients, 
                    Mr Markham. What? Don t say you ve 
                    never met. Then again, you are at 
                    opposite ends of the chain.

                                  MARKHAM

                    Eric had a trial for the Hammers, 
                    didn t you Eric. But the old drugs 
                    took their toll and he lost his 
                    place in the squad. He used to 
                    dream of playing for West Ham. Now 
                    he drops his pants and takes it up 
                    the Bakerloofor a day s worth of

      Before GENE can answer, she bolts from the room.

      ALEX inspects the Betamaxmachines and issues a laugh. CHRIS 
      hits eject. The Betamaxwhirrsand whirrs.

      ALEX pulls down a radio, tries to talk into it.

      Finally, FINALLY the Betamaxtop-loader pops up, ready.

      CHRIS nudges SHAZ - well done. Then it dawns him he hasn t

                    Where does this leave me?

    She steps back from the board. Each line of writing is under 
    the previous line. And thus the capital letters of each 
      sentence spell - D - E - A - D. 

      ALEX begins to perspire. Her breathing jags. She can t take 
    her eyes off those four letters. She picks up the Betamax
      casette labelled LAYTON.

                    in court.  You re staying here

                    We put crime squad onto Markham

                    boxes in the City district. All

                    He then picked up a message from 
                    some railway arches near Tower

                    You re lying on the wet ground. 
                    Don t fight to wake up. It ll hurt 
                    too much.

    On TV - a birthday cake. MOLLY stares at the cake.

                                  ASHES CLOWN (CONT'D)
                    You ll never make it to her party.

                                  ALEX
                    Oh Molly ... I m so sorry ....

                                  ASHES CLOWN (TV) 
                    All those memories ...

    On TV - the Ford escort explodes in a fire-ball.

                                  ALEX
                    Mummy ... Dad ....

    On TV - back to the ASHES CLOWN.

                                  ASHES CLOWN
                    But it doesn t have to hurt.

    She crawls towards the CLOWN. Towards the TV. As she does, 
    the room around her begins to dim. Her breathing slows. Her 
      eyes lose their lustre.

      Then suddenly ALEX gets a grip of herself - she reaches out 
    and pulls the plug. The TV dies. She grabs her newly acquired  
      dictaphoneand paces with angry determination.

                                  ALEX 
                          (records)
                    My name is Alex Drake. I ve just 
                    been shot and that bullet has sent 
                    me to 1981. I may be one second 
                    away from life ...

      FLASH - MOLLY S smiling face.

                                  ALEX (CONT'D)
                    Or one second away from death.

      FLASH - the ASHES CLOWN.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    They say that as you die you see 
                    your life flash before you. All 
                    those mistakes and regrets that 
                    form us.

                                                                        SMASH CUT:        Ashes to Ashes - Episode 1 - Shooting Script: PEACH - 31/08/07           61.



      ALEX winces at the terrible memory.

                                  ALEX
                          (records)
                    Well bring them on. My life can 
                    flash away as much as it likes. I 
                    am not going to die. I m going to 
                    come back to you Molly.

    She blows a kiss into the air.

      Music wafting up from the trattoria below - John Lennon - 
       Imagine .

       Imagine there s no Heaven. It s easy if you try. No Hell 
      below us. Above us only sky. Imagine all the people, living 
    for today ... 

                                                                            MIX TO:


       Imagine  continues. ALEX comes downstairs.

    RAY is chatting up a BIRD. Other CID drinking and eating 
      spaghetti. LUIGI (knackered) cups his chin in his palms. 

    We pick out CHRIS and SHAZ sharing a quiet drink. Finding the 
      courage to look into each other s eyes.

       Imagine there s no countries. It isn t hard to do. Nothing 
    to kill or die for. And no religion too. Imagine all the 
      people, living life in peace ... 

                                                                            MIX TO:


      GENE - a lonely figure under a solitary lamp. Gun, holster, 
      tie, Kourosand ciggies splayed across the desk before him. 
    He looks at the picture of Sam on his bulletin board. Then 
      grabs his jacket.

       You may say I m a dreamer. But I m not the only one ...

                                                                            MIX TO:


      ALEX bows her head. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)        Ashes to Ashes - Episode 1 - Shooting Script: PEACH - 31/08/07           62.

      A wine glass is plonked before her and filled to the very 
      brim.

     I hope some day you will join us and the world will be as 
    one ... 

    She raises her head. GENE carries the bottle to another 
      table. Doesn t look back but she appreciates the gesture.

      FADE OUT.
