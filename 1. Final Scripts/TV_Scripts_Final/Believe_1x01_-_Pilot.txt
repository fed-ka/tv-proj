      IN BLACKNESS:

      we hear the beautiful voice of a GIRL (10).  She s singing 
       1234  by FEIST.  Soft, unstudied, passing the time...

                                  GIRL (O.S.)
                          (singing)
                    One two three four tell me that you 
                    love me more / Sleepless long 
                    nights / that was what my youth was 
                    for...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CAR - CALIFORNIA COAST - TRAVELING - NIGHT

      Raining.  

      The girl is BO.  In the back seat of a car, shadows of rain 
      painting her, a face as pure as her voice.  We PULL BACK TO 
      REVEAL she s in a soccer uniform for her team, THE ASTROS.

                                  BO
                          (singing)
                    Oh you re changing your heart / oh 
                    you know who you are...

      She sings as if lost in it.  Like she s connected to another 
      sort of reality.  Her body swaying slightly, playing with a 
      STUFFED TURTLE, feet dangling, as the car hugs the winding 
      road.  

      UP FRONT: a COUPLE (GEORGE and MAGGIE, 40s).  George drives, 
      Maggie next to him.  He negotiates the slick, curving road 
      with care.  She checks email on her phone, attending to the 
      banal.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Tracy just emailed me.  She says 
                    the new couch came in.

      She s looking at pictures.  George looks at Bo in the rear-
      view, smiling.  Everything is okay--

      Then he spots a pair of HEADLIGHTS in the mirror.  Getting 
      closer.  He slows slightly, negotiating a bend, giving the 
      other driver the chance to pass them.  

      We see the lights disappear from the mirror and reappear as 
      the front of the other car moves alongside.                                                                                      2.


                                  MAGGIE (CONT D)
                    It s a little greener than I 
                    thought.

                                  GEORGE
                    Maybe it s the picture--

      Suddenly the car RAMS them from the side!    

                                  MAGGIE
                    Oh my God--

                                  GEORGE
                    Whoa whoa whoa--

      George struggles to control the car, manages to keep them on 
      the road when WHAM!  They re hit again!  The rear passenger 
      window EXPLODES in shattered glass--

                                  MAGGIE
                    Bo!

      She s belted in, covering her head--

                                  GEORGE
                    It s them--

      George tries to speed up but the road keeps curving, Maggie 
      frantically tries to dial her phone as the lights move 
      closer, and closer-- 

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    I got it I got it--

                                  MAGGIE
                          (to Bo)
                    It s gonna be okay--

      Bo is afraid, she looks at Maggie as they re HIT a third time 
      and the camera BOUNCES from the rear of the car to the front, 
      the car screams against the METAL RAILING with sparks flying 
      as the passengers SCREAM--

      And the car breaks through the railing and flies over a SMALL 
      DITCH, falling onto its side heavily enough to SMASH the 
      windshield, airbags EXPLODE and the passengers are jerked 
      forward into them, momentum still carrying the vehicle--

      When it finally comes to rest upside down, quiet and still.

      THROUGH THE UPSIDE-DOWN CRACKED WINDSHIELD

      we see the lights of the SUV that hit them on the hillside 
      above.  Windshield wipers moving.                                                                                       3.


      CLOSER: George and Maggie in the front seats.  Hurt.  Some 
      blood.

                                  GEORGE
                          (to Maggie)
                    Take her, take her--

      THROUGH TO THE BACK: Bo.  Belted in.  Upside down.  Eyes 
      closed but seemingly intact.

      PAN BACK TO THE FRONT: someone is getting out of the SUV. 

      Maggie sees this, she struggles with her seatbelt, she 
      finally clicks free and crawls towards the backseat, 
      collecting Bo, looks back as-- 

      The rain falls, it s hard to see, but the person from the SUV 
      is visible in the headlights-- and making their way down the 
      hillside towards the crash site.  

      The person gets closer-- it s a WOMAN (MOORE, 30s).

      Maggie crawls out of the wreckage with Bo, looks back at 
      George bleeding and trapped, badly injured--

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Call Channing... they found her...

      Camera PANS as Maggie carries Bo towards some nearby BUSHES, 
      she s limping and hurt, it s the only place to hide, PAN BACK 
      as she sees Moore approaching the car, Moore crouches and 
      leans in to George:

                                  MOORE
                    Are you hurt?

      For a split-second George relaxes, maybe it was an accident 
      after all--

                                  GEORGE
                    Call an ambulance...

      Moore tenderly touches his forehead. 

                                  MOORE
                    Maybe this will help you.

      Her hands slide down to his neck and she SNAPS IT in one 
      motion.  She stands up, sees George s blood on her hands, 
      looks at her palms with detachment.  She cups them and lets 
      the rain pool and then wash the blood away.                                                                                        4.


      Then we FOLLOW HER as she walks to the bushes, pulls a few 
      branches to reveal Maggie kneeling, tightly holding the 
      unconscious Bo...

                                  MAGGIE
                    Please... she s just a little 
                    girl...

      Moore kneels and smiles, seems touched, sizes up them both--

                                  MOORE
                    I don t care.

      Moore SNAPS Maggie s neck, lowering her to the ground. Then 
      she puts her arm around Bo, starting to carefully carry her--

                                  MAN (O.S.)
                    Put her down!  

      Moore stops and turns.  A MAN is hurrying down. 

                                  MAN (CONT D)
                    Don t touch her!  I m a doctor! 

      She puts Bo down.  Then considers-- should she kill this man 
      as well?  But then A MINIBUS has stopped on the road above, 
      more people coming, another CAR stops, the man arrives--

                                  MAN (CONT D)
                    An ambulance is coming!

                                  MOORE
                    Thank God.

      She channels a look of breathless concern... but the second 
      the man races past her towards Maggie and Bo the facade drops 
      and she s angry that she couldn t get the girl.

      She walks TOWARDS US back to the hill, away from the crash 
      site, more and more PEOPLE hurrying past her to help...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. STATE PRISON - TEXAS - NIGHT

      A VOLVO STATION WAGON arrives at the prison gate.  

      INT. STATE PRISON - SECURITY CHECKPOINT - NIGHT

      We follow as a PRIEST (70s), dressed in black and wearing a 
      fedora, approaches the metal detector.  His name is WINTER.  
      A FEMALE GUARD (40s) looks at him curiously.                                                                                      5.


                                  FEMALE GUARD
                    Where s Father Conover?

                                  WINTER
                    He s got an exorcism at 1030.  
                    Those things can run long.

      She s surprised... but then Winter smiles, a kindly figure.  
      She laughs heartily.

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    He s under the weather.  I hope 
                    that s all right.

                                  FEMALE GUARD
                    Sure-- you had me going, Father.

      As Winter passes through a metal detector, the machine BEEPS.  
      He points to a small AMPLIFIER in his ear.

                                  WINTER
                    Ah-- my hearing aid.  Would you 
                    like me to take it out? 

                                  FEMALE GUARD
                    No it s fine.

                                  WINTER
                    Thank you.

      He grabs her arm and leans in:

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    God speaks directly to your 
                    heart... but sometimes I m not so 
                    lucky with the television.

      She laughs.  Another officer (SPARKS, male 40) clears his 
      throat, all business.

                                  FEMALE GUARD
                    Officer Sparks will take you.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      A small row of cells but they appear empty.  We follow Winter 
      and Officer Sparks from behind as they approach the last one, 
      Sparks rattling his nightstick against the bars.                                                                                      6.


                                    OFFICER SPARKS
                    Wake up, Caveman.
                          (to Winter)
                    Just a little game we have.

      There s no answer from the cell.

                                    OFFICER SPARKS (CONT D)
                    Hey!  I m talking to you!

      He opens the cell door with a ring of keys, Winter cautiously 
      steps inside--

      INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT

      Winter turns back to the guard and nods in thanks.

                                    OFFICER SPARKS
                    You gonna be okay in here?  

                                  WINTER
                    Fine.  Thank you.

      Officer Sparks leaves them alone.  It s just Winter... and 
      WILLIAM TATE (30s).  Ragged beard, prison strong, intelligent 
      eyes narrowed in suspicion.  There s a depth to him, but he 
      keeps the world at arm s length.

                                  TATE
                    I didn t ask for a priest.

                                  WINTER
                    You re being executed for two 
                    counts of felony murder in 30 
                    minutes.  You have nothing to 
                    confess?  

                                  TATE
                    I m innocent.  I was set up.

                                  WINTER
                    And nobody seems to believe you, do 
                    they?  No one ever did.  No friends 
                    or family have come to be with you 
                    today.  Or during the seven years 
                    you ve been here.  Must be 
                    difficult to maintain hope.  And 
                    remember who you once were.

                                  TATE
                    I don t need a confession.

                                  WINTER
                    Well thank God for that.                                                                                      7.


      Tate is surprised by Winter s curious response.  Suspicious.  
      Winter sits down on the edge of his bed, strangely informal.

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                      Confessions are so boring.  I mean 
                    it s so easy now.  Reality 
                      television, instant messages... we 
                    live in a world where everyone 
                    wants forgiveness but no one asks 
                      permission.  

      Tate has grown impatient.  He doesn t want a friend.

                                  TATE
                    What do you want?

      Winter smiles and turns to face him.

                                  WINTER
                    I work for an international 
                    security organization.  I m here to 
                    help you escape. 

      Tate smiles.  

                                  TATE
                    I guess today s my lucky day.

                                  WINTER
                    I m serious.

      Tate is unimpressed.

                                  TATE
                    So I guess you re not really a 
                    priest.

                                  WINTER
                    Maybe not.  But we ve all made 
                      mistakes... maybe there s more than 
                    one road to salvation... 

      Is Winter talking about Tate... or himself?  Before Tate can 
      respond, Officer Sparks returns with a final tray of food.  
      As he brings it in, Tate looks at Winter but neither man says 
      anything with the guard present...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      BO S FACE

      with her eyes closed, the only sounds the HISSING and STEADY 
      BEEPS of medical machines.  Protective blanket up to her 
      neck, electrodes attached to her forehead and neck.                                                                                         8.


                                  LAB TECH (O.S.)
                    Mostly cuts and bruises, right?

      We are in:

      INT. LA HOSPITAL - CT SCAN ROOM - NIGHT

      The LAB TECH (20s, M) is speaking with DOCTOR JULIO CORTEZ 
      (boyish 30).  Cortez has a lot on his mind-- eventually we ll 
      learn why. 

                                  CORTEZ
                    Yeah.  But she s still sedated.  We 
                    need to make sure there s no 
                    internal injuries.

      A SENIOR DOCTOR (50s) dips his head in the doorway:

                                  SENIOR DOCTOR
                          (to Cortez)
                    Hey.  I hear you re not applying 
                    for the position.  What happened?

      Cortez stammers and doesn t answer.  It s an awkward moment  
      for him.  Senior Doctor just shakes his head and moves on.

                                  LAB TECH
                    You re turning it down?

                                  CORTEZ
                    I m turning everything down.

      Cortez doesn t elaborate further.  Lab Tech nods and presses 
      a button.  Bo starts slowly rolling into the machine... 

      INT. TATE S CELL - NIGHT

      A plastic fork and knife dig into the tray of food... and we 
      reveal it s WINTER who is eating it.  Or at least pushing it 
      around.

                                  WINTER
                    Salisbury steak, corn on the cob... 
                    quite nostalgic for a comfort you 
                    never had, aren t you?

      Tate just looks at him, a little annoyed.

                                  TATE
                    When I m outside... then what?                                                                                      9.


                                  WINTER
                    I m not just freeing you, if that s 
                    what you re asking.  I m hiring 
                    you.

      Tate seems disappointed.  Maybe there were brief visions of 
      revenge... he sits back.

                                  TATE
                    I m not a killer.

                                  WINTER
                    Killing?  No.  Quite the opposite.  

      Winter pushes the tray of food aside.

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    At 7:27 PM last night there was a 
                    single car accident on Highway 1 
                    near Point Mugu, California.  A man 
                    and a woman died in the crash. 
                    They were the foster parents of a 
                    girl named Bo, who was also in the 
                    vehicle at the time.  What looked 
                    like an accident was actually a 
                    targeted assassination in an effort 
                    to kidnap the girl.

                                  TATE
                    What does this have to do with me?

      Winter calmly continues the story.

                                  WINTER
                    Help arrived and she ll be fine.  
                    She s at LA Hospital so we need to 
                    get there before they do.

                                  TATE
                    I m not a kidnapper.

                                  WINTER
                    You re not kidnapping her, you re 
                    saving her.  And she s important.

                                  TATE
                    The hell are you talking about?  
                    You think this is funny?  What kind 
                    of sick game are you playing?  I m 
                    about to be executed!

      He stands menacingly over Winter, but Winter rises as well so 
      they re face to face, speaking in urgent loud whispers:                                                                                    10.


                                  WINTER
                    Are you thick, or just being 
                    stubborn?  I m offering you a way 
                    out!  

      Winter is passionate, and Tate decides to consider his offer 
      more seriously.

      RATTLING and footfalls from the end of the hall.  Sparks and 
      a Second Guard enter the corridor.  Approach.

                                  GUARD #2
                    Tate.  It s time.

      They move to cuff him but he still speaks directly to Winter.

                                  TATE
                    Why would I trust you?  You know 
                    what happens when you believe in 
                    people?  Your so-called friends?  
                    Why do you think I m here?

      CLICK they cuff him and we:

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. LA HOSPITAL - CT SCAN ROOM - NIGHT

      Lab Tech joins Cortez.  The Scanner starts up.  Lights flash 
      and there are rolling, grinding waves of INDUSTRIAL SOUND.  

      Bo lies on her back, perfectly still.  She wakes up slowly, 
      getting her bearings, unhappy in the machine...

                                  BO
                          (softly)
                    Stop...

      The LOUD SOUNDS continue.  She s growing anxious.  Meanwhile 
      the first images and lines of data begin to appear on the 
      screens.

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    Please stop...  

      Lab Tech can hear her but he s used to this, he watches the 
      displays, Cortez steps up next to him.  He bites nervously at 
      his fingernails.  Confused.

                                  CORTEZ
                    Is that right?  That can t be 
                    right.

      Lab Tech checks the machine.                                                                                    11.


                                  LAB TECH
                    The system s functioning.

                                  CORTEZ
                    Check it again.

                                  BO
                    Stop this!  

      Lab Tech rechecks the machine--

                                  LAB TECH
                    No we re good here... but this is 
                    weird, right? 

                                  CORTEZ
                    Get Schram in Neurology down here.

      Cortez is perplexed by the data, almost mesmerized by it--

                                  CORTEZ (CONT D)
                    What the hell--

                                  BO
                    Stop it!!!

      There s a ZAP and a LOW RUMBLE that doesn t match the rhythm, 
      Lab Tech frowns, suddenly alarmed--

                                  LAB TECH
                      Something s wrong--

                                  CORTEZ
                    Get her out--

      Bo thrashes a bit in the machine like she s having a 
      nightmare as lights start blinking faster, dials REDLINE, 
      readings going haywire, Tech frantically types and slaps a 
      few buttons but nothing helps, noises LOUDER, pulses FASTER--

                                  BO
                    GET ME OUT!

      Cortez races towards the door but just as he reaches it 
      sparks FLY FROM the immense machinery and the Lab Tech s 
      keyboard ZAPS with electricity and shorts out, the scanner 
      POWERS DOWN suddenly, the displays flicker and go dark.  The 
      room is quiet.  

      Lab Tech and Cortez look at each other, completely freaked 
      out.  Bo slowly rolls from the machine.  She turns her head 
      and smiles sweetly at them:                                                                                    12.


                                  BO (CONT D)
                    Thank you.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      One guard in front, Tate and Winter walking next to each 
      other, Officer Sparks behind.  Winter looks down at his 
      Bible, reading softly:

                                  WINTER
                    Though I walk through the valley of 
                    the shadow of death I shall fear no 
                    evil...
                          (to Tate)
                    You have one minute.

      But Tate is still rambling, worked up--

                                  TATE
                    --they told me it was just breaking 
                    and entering!  Then they pinned 
                    those bodies on me!

      They re heading towards a door at the end of the corridor.

                                  WINTER
                    45 seconds.

      Tate looks all around -- Front Guard -- eyes darting -- Bible 
      -- heart thumping -- overhead light -- he s caged, marching 
      towards the inevitable... when a SMALL BUTTERFLY passes 
      through his field of vision.  

      He calms slightly, sounds drop out, he tracks the butterfly, 
      it gives him focus and a sense of peace.  Or an answer?

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    30 seconds.

      Tate turns to Winter--

                                  TATE
                    Why me?

                                  WINTER
                    Because I believe in you.

      Tate nods slightly.  Maybe it s the first time anyone has 
      ever said it to him.

                                  TATE
                    Okay.                                                                                    13.


      Winter smiles slightly, places a fingertip to his  hearing 
      aid  and raises his  cufflink  which we now learn is a MIC: 

                                  WINTER
                          (into cuff)
                      Hallelujah--

      THE LIGHTS CUT OFF.  And things happen quickly--  

      CLUNK someone falls.  A flashlight comes ON revealing--  
      Front Guard knocked out on the floor, Officer Sparks holding 
      the flashlight, tossing a KEY to Winter who opens a SIDE DOOR 
      halfway down the hallway--

      ALARMS blaring, Officer Sparks shines the light towards Tate--

                                    OFFICER SPARKS
                    Your hands, your hands!

      Tate holds out his hands, Winter unlocks the handcuffs while 
      Officer Sparks opens a floor-level SEWER GRATE then turns 
      back and points to his own face--

                                    OFFICER SPARKS (CONT D)
                    Hit me.  Come on hit me!

      Tate hesitates--

                                  WINTER
                    Hit him!

      Tate punches him lightly.  Officer Sparks is disappointed.

                                    OFFICER SPARKS
                    Make it real.

      Tate smiles a little, relishing it, then rears back and 
      CLOCKS him.

                                    OFFICER SPARKS (CONT D)
                    Son of a bitch...

      Winter pulls Tate towards the open sewer grate.

                                  WINTER
                    Now go, go!  Down and to the left!

      Tate starts scrambling down and inside, Winter hands him the  
      flashlight and pulls the sewer grate closed, EMERGENCY LIGHTS 
      come on as Officer Sparks sprawls on top of the grate, acting 
      woozy as he recovers from Tate s punch--

      MORE GUARDS rush in, Winter points to the door halfway down 
      the corridor:                                                                                    14.


                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    Over there!  He went over there!

      As they rush over:

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                          (into mic)
                    Amen--

      BOOM an EXPLOSION somewhere beyond that door!  The Guards 
      recoil back, but they know he s that way, they head that way--

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. SEWER - SAME

      Tate lands in water up to his knees, the opening about the 
      size of his body.  It s hard to see except the skittering 
      greyish silhouettes of what must be RATS... he starts walking 
      forward... the filthy water reaching higher, his waist, his 
      neck, he has to keep his arm up to keep the flashlight dry...

      The water is higher, to his chin.... he reaches a GRATE 
      blocking the tunnel, he reaches down UNDERWATER and feels 
      where there s a small opening he can wriggle through... 

                                  TATE
                      Wonderful.

      He holds his breath and dips into the sewage, sliding through 
      the opening and coming out the other side, completely covered 
      in gunk now, but the water less deep as he moves forward, 
      reaching a FINAL GRATE with moonlight flowing through it...

      He reaches it and pushes tentatively, the grate has been left 
      open, he reaches

      OUTSIDE

      and it s raining now, Tate is a free man, he feels the rain 
      falling on his face, he stands there and closes his eyes and 
      bathes in it...

      Then suddenly a HOOD goes over his head and before he can 
      react someone quickly SLAPS another set of handcuffs on him.  
      It s CHANNING: 30s, female, all business. 

                                  CHANNING
                    Come on, Shawshank.  

      Her associates GIBBS (40s, intense) and SANTOS (20s) quickly 
      push him into a VAN, the van screeches off:

                                      END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    15.


                                            ACT TWO

      INT. BO S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

      Bo stirs from sleep, clutching the stuffed turtle in the bed 
      with her.  Hears a COMMOTION in the hallway and is drawn to 
      it... she gets up out of her bed and walks from the room.  

      INT. ANOTHER HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME

      A PATIENT (50s, M) is in CARDIAC ARREST.  As NURSES surround 
      him, Cortez tries to resuscitate the man with a 
      DEFIBRILLATOR.

                                  CORTEZ
                    Clear!

      He THUMPS his chest with paddles but it s still a flatline.

                                  NURSE
                    Six minutes--

                                  CORTEZ
                    Go to thirty-five.  Come on... 
                    clear!

      He uses the paddles again.  Nothing.  Bo watches all of 
      this... not focusing on the patient.  She s watching Cortez.

                                  NURSE
                    Doctor?  Are you calling it?

      Cortez just looks at her, unsure what to do.  He looks around 
      at the others, waiting for him to do something.  Finally he 
      acts.

                                  CORTEZ
                          (looks at watch)
                    Two eleven.

      Cortez stares down at the man as the nurses clean up. 
      Suddenly a HALLWAY NURSE spots Bo there.

                                    HALLWAY NURSE
                    There you are.  Let s go back to 
                    your room sweetie, okay?

      Bo lets the woman guide her from the room, taking one last 
      look back at Cortez.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    16.


      EXT. ISOLATED AIRSTRIP - SUNRISE

      Dimly lit.  The Van cruises up to a HERCULES CARGO PLANE, 
      propellers already whirring, the back door open.  

      The van doors open and Santos pulls Tate out.  Still wearing 
      the hood, he stands there-- when suddenly a HIGH PRESSURE 
      HOSE starts dousing him with water, almost knocking him down.

                                  TATE
                    Whoa!  Stop!

      Reveal Channing is the one doing the hosing.  Gibbs and 
      Santos get him up and take the hood off.  He and Channing 
      exchange a look: it s the first time he s seen her.

                                  TATE (CONT D)
                    Nice to meet you too.

      The Volvo also arrives and Winter gets out.  He s upbeat, 
      removing his priest collar as he walks.  He smiles at Tate.

                                  WINTER
                    We re gonna fly for a couple of 
                    hours and we ll talk.  Some real 
                    clothes, some real food.  How s 
                    that for a plan?

      Tate agrees and they walk forward.  Winter notices his 
      handcuffs.  He turns to Channing.

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    I didn t ask for those.

                                  TATE
                    She s a little exuberant.

                                  CHANNING
                    You don t know me at all.

                                  WINTER
                          (to Channing)
                    Take them off.

      She reluctantly removes Tate s cuffs.  Tate boards the plane 
      with Santos.  Winter follows, but Channing grabs his arm and 
      pulls him back.  She s respectful... but insistent.

                                  CHANNING
                    Sir.  He s a death row inmate.

                                  WINTER
                    He claims he didn t do it.                                                                                    17.


                                  CHANNING
                    They all say that!  Why him?  Why 
                    take the chance?  

      Her emotions slightly get the better of her.  She seems more 
      hurt than angry... did Winter pass her over?  He s sensitive.

                                  WINTER
                    You ve been loyal.  I appreciate 
                    that.  But it s the right call.  
                    Some day you ll understand why.

      No more time to discuss-- they ve got to go.  Winter boards 
      the plane and Channing, dissatisfied, follows.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. BO S HOSPITAL ROOM - (LATER THAT) DAY

      Bo sits up in her hospital bed.  A mostly eaten tray of 
      hospital food in front of her.  Cortez enters, grabbing her 
      chart from the foot of the bed, the incident with the CT scan 
      still fresh in his mind.

                                  CORTEZ
                    You re Bo, right?  I m Doctor 
                    Cortez.  I m a resident here.

      Cortez sees the stuffed turtle on her bed.

                                  CORTEZ (CONT D)
                    That s a cute turtle.

                                  BO
                    His name s Stanley.  My mom gave it 
                    to me.  My real mom.  But I don t 
                    remember her.

      He smiles, but it s all very polite.

                                  CORTEZ
                    You re going to need a few more 
                    tests, but you re gonna be okay.  
                    But there s some other things--

                                  BO
                    The nurse didn t want to tell me.

                                  CORTEZ
                    Yes--

                                  BO
                    Maggie and George.                                                                                    18.


                                  CORTEZ
                    It was a very bad crash--  

                                  BO
                    They re dead.

      Bo starts to cry.  It s hard to watch, and Cortez isn t 
      really sure how to react.

                                  CORTEZ
                    I m, uh, very sorry.

                                  BO
                    They were my parents for only two 
                    weeks.  But they were so nice.  We 
                    were gonna get a puppy.  We were 
                    gonna paint my room yellow.

      He nods, not sure what to say.  He chews on a fingernail 
      again and makes a note in her chart.

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    It s not your fault.  

                                  CORTEZ
                    Pardon me?

                                  BO
                    That man in the other room.  You 
                    tried to save him.  

      He smiles at her politely, unconvinced.  

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    You re a good doctor.

      Cortez is somewhat thrown by this-- the authority with which 
      she says it.  

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    You saved  Senga. 

                                  CORTEZ
                    Who is  Senga?    

                                  BO
                    Come on.  You took care of him. 

      Bo smiles, but he really doesn t know what she s talking 
      about.

                                  CORTEZ
                    You re tired, Bo.  I ll check in on 
                    you a little later, okay?                                                                                    19.


                                  BO
                    How is Senga doing?

                                  CORTEZ
                    I m sorry.  I don t know anyone 
                    named Senga.  Now get some rest.

      Cortez exits, leaving Bo there still trying to figure it out.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - BOUTIQUE GIFT SHOP - DAY

      Moore (the hitwoman) looks at display cases of scarves and 
      jewelry.  A female SALES CLERK (60s) approaches.

                                  MOORE
                    I m looking for a gift.

                                  SALES CLERK
                    For someone in particular?

      An impatient BUSINESSMAN (40s) barges in--

                                    BUSINESSMAN
                    Excuse me--

                                  SALES CLERK
                    Just a minute sir--

                                  MOORE
                    What do you get for the woman who 
                    brought you into this world and has 
                    driven you crazy ever since?

      Sales clerk chuckles at this.  

                                  SALES CLERK
                    Mothers.  Can t live with them, 
                    can t kill them.

                                  MOORE
                    You can t?

                                    BUSINESSMAN
                    Look sweetheart I m in a hurry!

      Moore is annoyed by this guy -- the arrogance, the 
      disrespect, the lack of cool -- three strikes as far as she s 
      concerned.  But her phone RINGS and she lets the Sales Clerk 
      deal with him.  She sees the name on the call and reacts.                                                                                    20.


                                  MOORE
                          (into phone)
                    Yes?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. SKYSCRAPER COMPLEX - DUBAI, UAE - NIGHT 

      A large party is underway for a glittering new high rise.  On 
      the phone: THEO SKOURAS (50s).  Black tie, tanned, athletic, 
        charismatic.  It s hard to say no to him, and you wouldn t 
      want to, either.

                                    SKOURAS
                    The girl is in LA Hospital.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. GIFT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

      Moore and Skouras, intercut.

                                  MOORE
                    I know.  I ll be back tomorrow.

                                    SKOURAS
                    Tomorrow will be too late.  You 
                    can t leave.

      Moore flinches slightly at this: a change in the plan, 
      another man ordering her around.  Meanwhile she watches as 
      the Businessman berates the nice Sales Clerk, angrily waving 
      his credit card around:

                                    BUSINESSMAN
                    Declined?  Swipe it again!  Are you 
                    an idiot?  Etc.

      Moore continues to watch him but responds to Skouras:

                                  MOORE
                    I was very clear.  Tonight I have 
                    to be out of pocket.  It s my 
                    mother s birthday.  

                                    SKOURAS
                    I don t care about your mommy 
                    issues.

                                  MOORE
                    She ll make my life hell.                                                                                    21.


                                    SKOURAS
                    This is not a conversation.  Bo is 
                    at LA Hospital on the fourth floor.  
                    Call me when you have her.

      Skouras hangs up.  Moore tries to maintain her composure.  
      CRASH! as the businessman angrily knocks over a display as he 
      leaves.  But Moore s in a bad mood too.  She follows...

      INT. AIRPORT - OUTSIDE BATHROOMS - DAY

      The businessman enters the MEN S ROOM.  Moore watches and 
      notes that the WOMEN S ROOM has a  cleaning  sign blocking 
      it.  She moves the sign to the men s side and goes in.

      INT. MEN S ROOM - DAY

      The businessman is about to take a piss when he sees Moore 
      walking up to him.  

                                    BUSINESSMAN
                    Hey!  This is the men s room!

                                  MOORE
                    Then why are you in here?

      Moore punches him in the stomach.  The businessman doubles 
      over, Moore calmly looks around to make sure no one else is 
      there, then she grabs him by the collar and BANGS him against 
      the wall.  Then she punches him in the face.  Then she brings 
      him up, grabs his hair, and runs his face into the mirror, 
      SMASHING it--

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Establishing.

      INT. CARGO PLANE - DAY

      A SERIES OF SHOTS as Tate s hair is cut, his beard trimmed 
      and then lathered up for a shave: 

      REVEAL Tate leaning back in a chair and trying to stay still 
      as a WOMAN slaps at his chest with a towel, knocking stray 
      hairs to the ground.  He looks over and sees Winter talking 
      to the PILOT, then heading back towards him.

                                  WINTER
                    You got something to eat?

                                  TATE
                    Yeah.                                                                                    22.


                                  WINTER
                    Good.  

                                  TATE
                    This girl you keep talking about.  
                    What s the big deal?

                                  WINTER
                    She s special.

                                  TATE
                    Aren t they all?

                                  WINTER
                    I want to show you something.

      He grabs a LAPTOP off a nearby table.  

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    Imagine the cavemen.  In the dark, 
                    in the cold, rubbing two sticks and 
                    feeling their warmth and then 
                      suddenly-- a spark.  Flames.  Fire.  
                    We take it for granted now, but at 
                    one time there was a planet without 
                    it.  Can you even imagine?

      Winter s eyes widen in delight, but Tate is less enthused.

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    And that man who controlled fire... 
                    he controlled everything.  He 
                    changed everything.  And this 
                    girl... 

      Calls up a YOUTUBE VIDEO and shows it to Tate.

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    This girl is fire.

      The grainy, shaky video rolls: A TWO YEAR OLD sleeping, 
      unaware as she levitates slightly in her crib.  But Tate 
      isn t buying.

                                  TATE
                    Come on.

                                  WINTER
                    I was skeptical too.  
                          (laughs)
                    I m not a zealot.  But it s real. 

      Channing approaches with a more recent photo of Bo.  Older.                                                                                    23.


                                  TATE
                    So she can float.  Big deal.

                                  WINTER
                    We have no idea what she s capable 
                    of.  And she doesn t know yet, 
                    either.  She is starting to become 
                    the person she is going to be.  And 
                    we were fortunate.  We were able to 
                    hide her for a long time.  We had 
                    friends who served as foster 
                    parents, people aware of her gifts.  
                    But obviously we ve failed.

      Winter shakes it off, but clearly feels this personally.

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    The people who tried to kidnap her 
                    work for some very powerful and 
                    dangerous people.  And they re not 
                    going to stop until they control 
                    her.

      Winter hands Tate a mirror.  Tate barely recognizes himself 
      and it shows on his (new) face. 

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    From the caterpillar emerges a 
                      butterfly.

                                  TATE
                    I liked the caterpillar better.  
                    Why me?  

                                  WINTER
                    We need someone we can trust.

      CLICK!  Tate looks down as Channing LOCKS an electronic 
        SURVEILLANCE BRACELET on his ankle.  It is TITANIUM and sort 
      of sleek.  Tate is surprised.

                                  TATE
                    Just can t keep your hands off me, 
                    can you?

                                  CHANNING
                          (ignoring him)
                    State of the art GPS tracking 
                    device.  We ll know where you are 
                    plus or minus two feet.  

                                  TATE
                    So much for  trust.                                                                                     24.


                                  WINTER
                    After all this time in prison, it 
                    would be natural for you to want to 
                    settle old scores.  This will make 
                    sure you fulfill your end of the 
                    bargain.

                                  CHANNING
                    And if you want to remove it, 
                    you ll have to chop off your leg.

                                  TATE
                    Thanks for the tip.

      Santos approaches with a small sponge, reaching for Tate s 
      cheek-- Tate grabs his wrist and pulls him roughly around.

                                  TATE (CONT D)
                    What the hell are you doing?

                                  WINTER
                    Relax-- it s makeup.  So we can 
                    take you in through the ER.
                          (to Santos)
                    Go ahead, Jorge.

      Tate relaxes slightly.  Santos begins working on the bruises.

                                  GIBBS
                    Cleared to land in five minutes.

      Gibbs is now dressed as a PARAMEDIC-- he and Channing start 
      preparing a STRETCHER.  Tate turns to Winter:

                                  TATE
                    You re gonna give me a gun, right?

                                  WINTER
                    We don t do guns, Mr. Tate.  We re 
                    the good guys.

      Tate is exasperated.  This is a deathwish.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. ANOTHER TARMAC - CALIFORNIA - DAY

      The cargo plane LANDS.  As the doors of the plane open, an 
      AMBULANCE is waiting.  

      Channing and Santos push the stretcher (carrying Tate) out of 
      the plane towards the back of the ambulance with Gibbs now 
      behind the wheel-- all three in EMT UNIFORMS now.                                                                                     25.


      Tate tries to lean up and see, and we note that his face and 
      arms are covered with fake bruises and blood.  Channing puts 
      an oxygen mask on his face and pushes him back down.   

      As they get to the ambulance and are about to load, Winter is 
      there.  He looks down at Tate.

                                  WINTER
                    This may be the most important day 
                    of your life.  Exciting, isn t it?

                                  TATE
                          (wearing the mask)
                    [garbled]

      Based on his tone, he probably wasn t saying  yes it s 
      exciting.   Winter smiles and touches him on the shoulder.

                                  WINTER
                    Good luck.

      The stretcher goes up into the ambulance and Winter walks to 
      a car as the ambulance pulls away, all wailing sirens and 
      flashing gumballs.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. NURSE S STATION - DAY

      Cortez sits at a desk and types into a terminal, searching 
      the patient database...

      He types in the name  Senga  but it says NO PATIENTS FOUND.  
      He s stumped.

      INT. HALLWAY/MEDICATION SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

      Cortez looks both ways down the hall-- it s empty.  He uses a 
      key to secretly enter the medication supply room.  

      INT. MEDICATION SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

      Cortez quickly slides several vials of MORPHINE into his lab 
      coat pocket.  Then he shuts off the light and exits as 
      quickly as he entered...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. LA HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - DAY

      Moore is on the phone, walking in small circles in the 
      parking lot:                                                                                    26.


                                  MOORE
                          (into phone)
                    What do you mean I m trying to kill 
                    you?  
                          (listens)
                    It s just one day, Mom!  You can t 
                    get sick from a day old sheet cake!  
                          (listens)
                    I know it has custard in it--

      She looks and sees DOCTOR TRACY ELLIOT (40s, black) nod 
      goodbye to a few EMPLOYEES then heads towards her car.  

      We FOLLOW HER as she pulls off her white lab coat, she s 
      exhausted, BEEPS her keys to unlock her fancy ride as Moore 
      hurries to catch up with her, still on the phone--  

                                  MOORE (CONT D)
                    Excuse me, Doctor?  Do you have a 
                    second?
                          (into phone)
                    Look I ll call you back--

      The Doctor turns, not thrilled, we STAY on her--

                                  DOCTOR ELLIOT
                    Yes?

                                  MOORE
                    I have a question.  I have this--
                          (into phone)
                    Mom go.  Go watch Bravo.  Go.  I 
                    don t know.  Two something.  Use 
                    the guide.

      Moore hanging up as we still hear the CHIRPING.

                                  MOORE (CONT D)
                    Argh!!  Sorry.  My mother.  The 
                    guilt, you know?  What s that thing 
                    that comes out in the shower? 

                                  DOCTOR ELLIOT
                          (baffled)
                    Mold?

                                  MOORE
                    Right.  It s like mold.

      Doctor Elliot is a little rattled... by Moore being rattled.

                                  DOCTOR ELLIOT
                    Look, uh, I m really exhausted, I m 
                    sure someone inside can help you--                                                                                     27.


                                  MOORE
                    Right.  Sorry to bother you.  

      Doctor Elliot nods politely, relieved the exchange is over... 
      she turns towards her car and Moore DARTS towards her--

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. AMBULANCE - TRAVELING - DAY

      Traffic slows as the ambulance exits the freeway and heads 
      into the maze of streets in DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES.

      INT. AMBULANCE - TRAVELING

      Gibbs drives, Santos and Channing look back at Tate from the 
      passenger seat.

                                  CHANNING
                    Our last report is that she s in 
                    ICU on the fourth floor, but that 
                    may have changed.  We ll go in 
                    through the ER.  We ll bring her 
                    back and meet Santos there.  

                                  TATE
                    So I ll get you the girl and I m 
                    out of here.  I have business.

                                  CHANNING
                    No.  Then we meet Winter at the 
                      rendezvous point.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT

      Doctor Elliot is bound and gagged and making muffly noises.  
      Moore wears her hospital coat and looks down at her in the 
      open trunk.

                                  MOORE
                    I just want to say that I think 
                    athletes aren t the real American 
                    heroes.  Doctors are.

      Then she SLAMS the trunk on her and walks away.

      INT. AMBULANCE - TRAVELING - DAY

      We see through the windshield that we are arriving at LA 
      Hospital.  The camera TURNS 180 to the back of the 
        ambulance...                                                                                     28.


                                  GIBBS
                    This is it.

                                  CHANNING
                    Get down.

      Tate back on the gurney as the ambulance stops, the doors 
      open, the camera follows

      OUTSIDE

      up the ramp and through the automatic doors of the intake 
      area and into the chaos of the 

      EMERGENCY ROOM

      where there are GUNSHOT VICTIMS, a woman in LABOR, a child 
      CRYING... Gibbs and Channing are greeted by a HARRIED DOCTOR.

                                  CHANNING (CONT D)
                      Electrical accident.  Second degree 
                    burns on the face and arms.  But 
                    he s stable.

                                    HARRIED DOCTOR
                    Then park him.  We ve got a bus 
                    accident two minutes out.

      She hesitates, looks down at Tate.

                                    HARRIED DOCTOR (CONT D)
                    Come on you two!  Come with me!

      Channing is helpless and unable to help Tate with his search.  
      As she and Santos head away, she mouths to Tate:

                                  CHANNING
                    Go...  

      They re gone, he s left alone.  He gets up from the gurney.  
      He starts walking, hesitantly at first, but then with more 
      confidence just as BOOM-- he bumps into a DOCTOR.  

                                  TATE
                    Oh.  Excuse me.

                                  DOCTOR
                    Sorry.

      It s MOORE.  They look at each other, then both disappear 
      deeper into the hospital, walking away from us as they enter 
      a corridor, Tate makes a right while Moore heads left...

                                      END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    29.

      INT. ICU (FOURTH) FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY

      The floors are big.  Tate walks down the hall, peering in 
      rooms, not seeing Bo, he peers in one

      EMPTY ROOM

      where the patient is gone but the room hasn t been cleaned 
      yet.  He grabs a pair of stray scrubs flopped over a chair. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. ANOTHER FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

      Moore walks with confidence.  She knows where Bo is.  She 
      gets to the room and looks inside-- but Bo is no longer 
      there.  She turns to a NURSE in the hall:

                                  MOORE
                    Where s the girl that was here?

                                  NURSE
                    She s stable.  They moved her.
                    Check at the nurses  station.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      TATE

      as he checks more rooms, wearing the scrubs now, sees SOMEONE 
      getting revived...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. NURSE S STATION - DAY

      A NURSE checks her computer screen as Moore waits.

                                  NURSE #2
                    She s in 112.  Recovery Wing.

                                  MOORE
                    You re an angel.

      Moore heads to the elevator and presses the button.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    30.


      TATE

      exiting out a stairwell onto a NEW FLOOR, more frustrated and 
      frantic in his searching...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR

      as Moore approaches ROOM 112, she looks in, she sees Bo 
      sleeping, she s about to enter--

                                    FRANTIC NURSE
                          (from behind)
                    156!  He can t breathe!  

      This means nothing to Moore.  A SECOND NURSE also arrives, 
      equally desperate--

                                  MOORE
                    Look I--

                                  SECOND NURSE 
                    Doctor, please!

      She s physically grabbing Moore and pulling her, and Moore 
      realizes there s no excuse for her to be saying no.  And the 
      faster she deals with this, the faster she s back.

      Moore follows Frantic Nurse... and Tate walks past them in 
      the opposite direction.  Moore sees him looking in rooms, 
      then attention forward again as she approaches

      ROOM 156

      where a SECOND NURSE tries to hold down the MALE PATIENT 
      (60s) as he FRANTICALLY GASPS FOR BREATH.  Cortez stands 
      there, paralyzed with indecision--

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. HALLWAY - SAME

      Tate is about to pass another room when he stops, as if 
      pulled by an unseen force.  He turns towards an open doorway, 
      then takes a step or two inside...

      INT. BO S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      A BUTTERFLY floats back and forth across the frame.  

      We DOLLY IN on Tate as the sound seems to fade.  The low huff 
      of exhalation.  The buzz of a flickering light.  The steady 
      solemn BEEPS of machines designed to keep a person alive.                                                                                    31.


      TATE S POV as we DOLLY into a girl who is sleeping, her chest 
      rising and falling with her breath... as the butterfly lands 
      on the lip of a glass of water next to her bed.

      Tate watches the butterfly, wings moving slowly in and out as 
      it rests, then he walks towards Bo s bed.  He sits on the 
      edge of the bed, looking at her curiously.  There is 
      something almost luminous about her face, and Tate looks at 
      her as if hypnotized.

      Tears start to form around his eyes.  One starts to slide 
      down his face and he touches his fingertips to his cheek in 
      surprise, and looks at his damp hand as if it s something 
      completely foreign.  

                                  BO (O.S.)
                    You stink.

      Tate is still coming out of his reverie as he looks down at 
      Bo.  She s awake now.

                                  TATE
                    I fell in a sewer.  But they washed 
                    me off. 

                                  BO
                    You still stink.

                                  TATE
                    I don t.

                                  BO
                    You do.  What s your name?

                                  TATE
                    Tate.

      She notices the bruises on his face and arm.

                                  BO
                    You were crying.

                                  TATE
                    No I wasn t.

                                  BO
                    Yes you were.

                                  TATE
                    I hit my head.  

                                  BO
                          (re bruises)
                    Those are fake.                                                                                      32.


                                  TATE
                    How do you know?

                                  BO
                    Because you re not feeling any 
                    pain.

      This throws Tate a little.

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    Can I touch it?

      Tate is irritated, impatient.

                                  TATE
                    No.

      She touches it anyway.

                                  TATE (CONT D)
                    Ow.  You see?  It hurts a lot.  We 
                    have to go.  

                                  BO
                    Are you my new foster Dad?

                                  TATE
                    No.

                                  BO
                    Good because you stink.

                                  TATE
                    We ve established that.

                                  BO
                    I m not going with you.

                                  TATE
                    Yes you are.  Winter says you have 
                    to come with me.

                                  BO
                    Milton?

                                  TATE
                    Winter.

                                  BO
                    Milton Winter.  Where is he?

      Bo quickly climbs out of bed, expecting to see him.                                                                                    33.


                                  TATE
                    I m taking you to him.

                                  BO
                    Okay.

      She sees her soccer clothes folded on a chair.  She takes 
      them and heads towards the bathroom.  Then she turns back.

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    You know why you were crying?

                                  TATE
                    I told you.  It hurts.

                                  BO
                    No.  You remembered you were good 
                    once.

      She goes into the bathroom and closes the door.  Tate is 
      there alone, trying to get his head around this young girl... 
      he starts rubbing at the wound makeup trying to wipe it off.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. ROOM 156 - SAME

      The patient is still having convulsions.  Moore seems 
      remarkably composed.  She s holding the chart, calmly and 
      confidently taking him through a list of questions.

                                  MOORE
                          (to resident)
                    Cortez, right?  What happened?

                                  CORTEZ
                    He needs an emergency tracheotomy.

      Moore impatiently looks out into the hallway.

                                  MOORE
                    So do it then.

      Cortez stands over the man with a small scalpel.  He s 
      frozen.  Moore can t wait anymore.

                                  MOORE (CONT D)
                    Let me help you. 

      Moore takes the scalpel from Cortez.  With cool precision, 
      she makes a narrow horizontal incision on the patient s 
      throat, opens it slightly, then inserts a SHORT TUBE.  
      There s a small SUCKING NOISE as the patient breathes through 
      it.  Stable now.  Moore hands the scalpel back to Cortez.                                                                                    34.


                                  MOORE (CONT D)
                    Grow a pair.

      She exits the room, leaving Cortez humiliated.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. BO S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

      Tate is almost finished rubbing the makeup off his fake 
      wound.  Bo comes out of the bathroom in her soccer uniform.  
      She grabs her stuffed turtle.

                                  BO
                    There s soap in there.

                                  TATE
                          (ignoring her)
                    Put this on, let s go.

      He hands Bo her ROBE and she puts it on over her clothes.   
      They turn to leave-- and Moore is in the doorway.  

                                  MOORE
                    Where are you going?

                                  TATE
                    Uh-- I m taking her to Radiology.

                                  MOORE
                    Of course.  I ll walk with you.
                          (to Bo)
                    Can you get in the chair, sweetie?

      Bo looks to Tate.  He doesn t see much choice-- so he plays 
      it cool and nods.  He grabs a wheelchair from the corner of 
      the room and Bo gets in.

      INT. HALLWAY - DAY

      Tate slowly pushes the wheelchair down the corridor.  Moore 
      looks down at Bo.

                                  MOORE
                    How are you feeling?  

                                  BO
                    Good.

      Moore tries to grab the wheelchair from Tate.  He resists.

                                  MOORE
                    Don t worry.  I ll take her.                                                                                    35.


                                  TATE
                    I have to do it.  Hospital policy.

                                  MOORE
                    You know what?  I m gonna take the 
                    girl.

                                  TATE
                    I could lose my job.  Doctor-- 

      He looks down at her ID clipped to her coat pocket... and the 
      photo of a BLACK WOMAN.

                                  TATE (CONT D)
                    --Elliot.

      Tate looks at Moore.  She looks back, defiant.  

                                  TATE (CONT D)
                    Are you all right?  You look a 
                    little pale.

      Moore looks around the corridor, sees it is empty-- WHACK!  
      She elbows Tate in the gut, he bends and falls to the floor, 
      Bo scrambles away, Moore moves to kick him but he blocks it 
      with his hand, then another kick and block, he gets to his 
      feet, she s ready to hit him again--

                                  TATE (CONT D)
                    Please.  I don t want to have to 
                    hit you back.

                                  MOORE
                    Not a problem.  

      Bo looks all around, she sees a recently vacated ROOM nearby 
      with some equipment still laying around.  And Moore is about 
      to punch Tate again--

                                  MOORE (CONT D)
                    Ow!

      She turns-- Bo has jammed a SYRINGE in Moore s butt.  Moore 
      looks down at her.  

                                  MOORE (CONT D)
                    Not cool.

      Moore throws another punch that Tate dodges.  Then another-- 
      but this one s way wide, whatever was in that syringe is 
      kicking in, Tate avoids it easily and collects Bo--

                                  TATE
                    Let s go.                                                                                    36.


      They hurry down the hallway as Moore reaches inside her coat 
      for a SILENCER, she shoots as they duck around the corner, 
      the bullet SMASHES into plaster on the wall--

      ANOTHER HALLWAY

      now as Tate and Bo run towards us, Moore appears at the far 
      end, levels the gun and shoots, bullet WHIZZING by--

      She stops, staggering a little and holding onto the wall, 
      leaning and druggy, tries to keep going.  Tate and Bo have 
      the advantage and disappear around another corner to a 

      THIRD HALLWAY

      where Tate keeps running but then stops-- he looks to the end 
      of the corridor, Bo looks that way as well and sees--

                                  BO
                    Cortez!

      And she starts to hurry towards him, he s got paperwork to 
      fill out at the counter but he s just staring into space--

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    I need to go help him.

      Tate grabs her and pulls her back before she gets too far--

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    I need to talk to him!

                                  TATE
                    You ll get us killed!

      Tate pushes her towards an open doorway, and as Moore hobbles 
      her way around the corner they duck into a ROOM--

      Moore reaches the doorway that Tate and Bo entered, she s 
      barely able to stand, sees only a sleeping FEMALE PATIENT 
      (30s), Moore staggers inside the

      HOSPITAL ROOM

      Where Tate and Bo hide under the bed, REVERSE and show their 
      POV of Moore s druggy lurching feet shuffling past them as--

      Moore approaches a medicine cabinet but it s locked, she 
      breaks the glass, barely standing now, shoving vials away 
      until she finds what she wants--

      Tate looks at the window and gets an idea--                                                                                     37.


      Female Patient starts to stir from sleep as Moore grabs a 
      syringe and yanks it open with her mouth--

      BEHIND MOORE: Tate and Bo crouch and sneak towards the 
      windows, Female Patient sees them but groggily isn t sure 
      what she sees, Tate pushing the window open as Moore INJECTS 
      HERSELF--

      Her head is lolling forward but then it SNAPS UP and her eyes 
      are focused again as Tate disappears through the window with 
      Bo right before Moore turns and looks in that direction.

      Moore looks under the bed, she s almost manically focused 
      now, Female Patient grabs her arm--

                                  FEMALE PATIENT
                    Doctor, it hurts--

                                  MOORE
                    Don t touch me.

      Moore quickly exits the room, we follow her to the door but 
      then move back towards the window and move close to see 

      OUTSIDE

      as Tate and Bo run towards a city street, a CITY BUS is 
      starting to move but as Tate CALLS OUT and WAVES HIS ARMS we 
      see the bus brake lights go bright... 

      Tate and Bo disappear around the side of the bus and when it 
      pulls away-- they re on it and gone.

                                      END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    38.


                                          ACT FOUR

      INT. BUS - (MOMENTS) LATER

      We re with the DRIVER, then we PAN back through the half-
      empty bus to where Bo and Tate are sitting.  Tate is anxious.

                                  BO
                    Do you think she s going to be 
                    okay?

                                  TATE
                    Who?

                                  BO
                    That lady.  I stabbed her hard.  In 
                    the butt.

                                  TATE
                    She ll be fine.  Who cares?

                                  BO
                    Where are we going?

                                  TATE
                    I don t know.

                                  BO
                    Where s Milton? 

                                  TATE
                    I don t know.  Can you stop talking 
                    for a second?  

      She s quiet... Bo looks out the window and sees some KIDS 
      playing SOCCER in a ragged city PLAYGROUND.  It may look like 
      nothing to most people, but Bo isn t most people...

                                  BO
                    I know who Senga is.

                                  TATE
                    What?

                                  BO
                    Senga.  He wasn t an old patient.  
                    We have to find Cortez.

      But he s not listening to her, he s fidgeting with the 
      bracelet.  She sees it.

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    That s pretty.  Do you wear it all 
                    the time?                                                                                    39.


                                  TATE
                      Apparently.

                                  BO
                    I have Stanley with me all the 
                    time.  He s a turtle.

      The bus is passing through a busy commercial area with SMALL 
      SHOPS-- and Tate spots a LOCAL BAR.  He pulls the cord and 
      the bus slows to a stop.  He gets up. 

                                  TATE
                    We re getting off.

      He heads off the bus.  Bo follows.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    You didn t tell me they were

                    Fine.  Call them.

      She hangs up.  Gets in her car.

      INT. LOCAL BAR - DAY

      Dark, better days, a smattering of DISSOLUTE CUSTOMERS.  Tate 
      ushers Bo to a barstool and sort of plops her on it.

                                  TATE
                    Don t move.

                                  BO
                    But--

                                  TATE
                    Just do what I say!

      It s rough and Bo shrinks a little, but Tate is unapologetic.  
      He turns to the BARTENDER (M, 50s)  

                                  TATE (CONT D)
                    Give her some milk.

                                  BARTENDER
                    We don t have milk.

                                  TATE
                    Fine.  Some club soda then.  And 
                    I ll take a double bourbon.  Neat.

      Tate moves past the bar to a payphone-- the reason he came in 
      here.  Digs in his pocket, puts in the coin, and dials a 
      number from heart.  Waits-- 

                                  TATE (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    Hey, remember me?  Let me give you 
                    a hint-- I m the guy you set up 
                    eight years ago.
                          (listens)
                    That s right.  And tell your 
                    friends I m coming for every single 
                    one of you.

      He SLAMS down the phone.  Satisfied-- for the moment.  When 
      Tate turns back to Bo there s a GUY (30s) on Tate s stool, 
      next to her.  Tate comes over, grabs Bo s glass of juice and 
      pulls it to the other end of the bar, away from that guy.

                                  TATE (CONT D)
                    Let s move down here.

      He reaches for his own drink but the guy grabs his wrist.

                                  GUY
                    You think I m stealing your 
                      girlfriend?                                                                                    41.


                                  TATE
                    Let go.

                                  GUY
                    Or what?

                                  TATE
                    I d let go if I were you.

      The guy stands up-- and he s actually taller and bigger than 
      Tate.  The guy swings heavily and Tate dodges it, using the 
      guy s own momentum to turn him around onto the bar, and Tate 
      punches him in the kidney.

                                  BO
                    No!  Stop!

                                  TATE
                    Stay out of it!

      Tate punches him again--

                                  BARTENDER
                    Hey!  Knock it off!

      Tate is a little out of control, still punching the guy--

                                  TATE
                    You got a problem with me?

                                  BARTENDER
                    Hey!  

      Tate finally stops for a second.

                                  BARTENDER (CONT D)
                    Your daughter-- she s gone.

      Tate realizes he was focused on the guy and lost track of Bo, 
      she must have just raced out--

                                  TATE
                    She s not my daughter...

      He downs his whiskey and runs out of the bar.

      EXT. LOCAL BAR - DAY

      Tate looks both directions.  She s gone.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    42.

                    her.

      Corey grabs a pencil and small pad.  Moore is annoyed.

      Moore hangs up.  Corey turns to everyone--

                    LA Hospital, a man and a little

                    What are you doing?

      But Bo is angry, too.  She doesn t look up.

                                  BO
                    You were mean.

                    stupid.  You need to learn how to 
                    resolve your conflicts.

      It s like something she heard on television.  Bo walks out.  
      Tate follows.

      EXT. STREET - DAY

      Bo walks away from the store.  Still irritated.

                                  BO

      Suddenly a CAR SCREECHES to a stop in front of them.  Santos

      Cortez sits down in the kitchen, exhausted.  On the table in

      shot of them getting on the bus.

                                  COREY
                    At 11:41 they got on the 117 bus.  
                    That was the last sighting.  

                                  MOORE
                    Keep looking.

      Moore hangs up.  Corey is all business.  He calls out:

                                  COREY
                    Okay people!  Check CCTV and ATMs 
                    on the routes as well.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. INDUSTRIAL STREET - DAY

      An area of the city with warehouses, empty lots, etc.  An OLD 
      WOODEN GATE rises and Channing s car disappears into the 
      garage of an INDUSTRIAL BUILDING.

      INT. INDUSTRIAL BUILDING - DAY

      They exit the car and into a freight elevator.  Santos and 
      Gibbs stay behind, guarding the entrance.  Channing presses a 
      button, it clatters closed and slowly rises, arriving on the

      SECOND FLOOR

      which is a large and airy unconstructed space with a row of 
      empty offices along one long wall.  Winter is on his phone in 
      the empty center.  Bo sees him--                                                                                    46.


                                  BO
                    Milton!

      She races out of the elevator and hugs Winter.  He tries to 
      lift her and makes a show of it:  

                                  WINTER
                    Argh!  You re getting bigger!

                                  BO
                    No I m not!  I saw you two weeks 
                    ago!

      He puts her back down.  Tate and Channing approach.  Tate 
      looks up at the room s naked RAFTERS: dozens of PIGEONS seem 
      to be nesting there.

                                  WINTER
                    Well done, Mr. Tate.
                          (to Channing)
                    What did I tell you?

      Channing frowns at this.

                                  TATE
                    So if one of you could remove my 
                    piece of jewelry now...

                                  WINTER
                          (to Channing)
                    Go and show Bo her new clothes.

      Channing and Bo head off to another corner of the room where 
      there are some boxes and small suitcases.

                                  TATE
                    The bracelet.  I want it off.

                                  WINTER
                    It s not that simple.  

                                  TATE
                    We had a deal.

                                  WINTER
                    I said you d come work for me.

                                  TATE
                    And I did your work.

                                  WINTER
                    Your work has just started.  I m 
                    sure you noticed that Bo s a 
                    special girl.                                                                                    47.


      Tate doesn t answer.  We see that Bo is listening to music on 
      an iPod, singing along.

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    And your job is to keep her safe.  
                    To protect her--  

                                  TATE
                    From that woman?

                                  WINTER
                    Yes.  And the people she works for. 

      Bo hears this.

                                  BO
                    Is he gonna be my foster daddy?

                                  WINTER
                          (to Bo)
                    In a minute, sweetheart.
                          (to Tate)
                    You ll be moving from town to town.  
                    We ll be helping you.  There are 
                    people after the girl, but soon the 
                    FBI and others will be after you 
                    too.

                                  BO
                    He s mean and he stinks!

                                  TATE
                          (snaps at Bo)
                    I fell in a sewer, I told you!
                          (to Winter)
                    You see!  She doesn t want to be 
                    with me either!

      Winter presses on.

                                  WINTER
                    In some towns you ll be aided by 
                    our associates.  Sometimes you ll 
                    be on your own.  And the ultimate 
                      responsibility for her well-being -- 
                    her health and education -- that 
                    belongs to you.

                                  TATE
                    Look, I m not Mr. Mary Poppins--

                                  BO
                    Milton, I want to stay with you!                                                                                    48.


                                  WINTER
                    We talked about that, remember?

                                  TATE
                    If I say yes, how many weeks is 
                    this  job  supposed to last?

                                  WINTER
                    Seven years.  

      Tate chokes on this.  

                                  TATE
                    Seven years?!?

                                  WINTER
                    And they ll be the best years of 
                    your life.

      Winter offers an encouraging smile.  But Tate isn t buying.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. MOORE S CAR - DRIVING

      Moore driving frantically.

                                  MOORE
                    Where are they now?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Intercut.

                                  COREY
                    Well, we were able to access the 
                    city s traffic signaling system--

                                  MOORE
                    I don t care.  Where are they now?

                                  COREY
                    433 Mission Avenue.  It looks like 
                      a warehouse.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. INDUSTRIAL BUILDING - DAY

      Bo comes out from one of the small rooms in some of the new 
      clothes.  Channing smiles at her.                                                                                    49.


                                  CHANNING
                    Look at you!  Nice shoes!  Do you 
                    like them?

      Bo nods and smiles.  They share a girly moment.

                                  CHANNING (CONT D)
                    Go look in the other bag.

      Channing returns to Tate and Winter, who continue to discuss 
      his mission.

                                  WINTER
                    Our adversary is resourceful.  We 
                    have to keep use of cell phones or 
                    other electronics to a minimum.  
                    Lovely Channing will be monitoring 
                    your whereabouts and progress.

                                  TATE
                    You realize I haven t agreed to any 
                    of this yet.

                                  WINTER
                    Oh but you have.  The FBI is 
                      undoubtedly on to you by now.

                                  TATE
                    Maybe I ll take my chances.

                                  CHANNING
                    You won t last ten minutes out 
                    there.  They ll shoot you on sight.

                                  WINTER
                    But that won t happen... with our 
                    help.  We re not superheroes, Mr. 
                    Tate.  Far from it.  But we re 
                      hardworking, dedicated people.  And 
                    we can protect you.

                                  TATE
                    You still haven t answered my 
                    question.  Why me?

      Channing leans in, wondering also.  Winter smiles.

                                  WINTER
                    Do you think we would have gone to 
                    all that trouble without a reason?
                    I can t tell you now.  But you ll 
                    figure it out.

      Gibbs brings over a duffel bag and hands it to Winter.                                                                                      50.


                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    This is for you.

      He unzips it-- it s filled with THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.  Tate s 
      eyes goes wide.  Winter has his attention now.

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    We want you to take good care of 
                    her.  Educate her.  Good organic 
                    food.  Comfortable accommodations.  
                    You re going to be raising her now.

                                  TATE
                    I need a gun.

                                  WINTER
                    We talked about that already.

      Tate stares at the money.  It s not clear if he s listening.

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    Mr. Tate?

      Tate finally looks up.

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    The first time you saw her.  You 
                    felt something, didn t you? 

                                  TATE
                    What do you mean?

                                  WINTER
                    What did you feel?

      Sound DROPS OUT as Tate looks at Bo-- bouncing a ball, she 
      turns to him, they look at each other, expressions enigmatic--

                                  WINTER (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Mr. Tate?

                                  TATE
                    I don t know.  I don t like kids.

      Bo s ball ROLLS along the floor, hitting the low wall beneath 
      a LONG WINDOW.  Bo chases it and catches up on the back 
      bounce, but then she looks out and sees Moore s car speeding 
      towards the building, she turns back to camera and faces us--

                                      END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    51.


                                          ACT FIVE

      INT. INDUSTRIAL BUILDING - DAY

      Moore s car SMASHES through the wooden gate of the garage and 
      the second car follows, we WHIP to a startled Gibbs and 
      Santos next to the entrance door, they race towards the door 
      heading further inside--

      UPSTAIRS

      Winter and the others hear the commotion--

                                  WINTER
                          (to Channing)
                    Take the girl!

      Channing rushes to collect Bo at the front window as

      DOWNSTAIRS

      Moore hops out of the car and Santos reaches the interior 
      door to safety, but Gibbs is trailing-- Moore FIRES TWICE and 
      hits Gibbs in the back.  He goes down.  Moore moves quickly 
      to the 

      CORRIDOR

      where Santos is at the far end, he turns a corner towards the 

      FREIGHT ELEVATOR

      and ducks inside dodging bullets, he slaps the button to send 
      it upward, the doors start to close as 

      MOORE 

      takes the corner and begins walking directly towards him and

      THE ELEVATOR DOORS 

      start to grind slowly towards each other--

                                  SANTOS
                    Come on, come on--

      But it s not fast enough, he s trapped himself, he tries to 
      tuck himself in the corner but she can still make the angle 
      and BANG BANG BANG empties the rest of her clip into him.

      Then she sticks her hand in the closing doors, they lurch 
      back open, she steps inside, Santos is in the corner gasping 
      and spitting blood, she looks down at him pleasantly:                                                                                    52.


                                  MOORE
                    Which floor?

      She presses the button for the second floor as 

      UPSTAIRS

      they ve heard the SHOTS and now hear the elevator s 
      inevitable rise: Winter, Channing, and Bo hurry towards the 
      adjacent stairwell, across from the row of offices--

                                  CHANNING
                          (to Bo)
                    Come on!  We have to go!

      Channing scoots Bo forward a little, they head off, Tate is 
      left standing there, he looks down at his feet-- the DUFFEL 
      OF MONEY.  He looks at Channing, she looks back--

      And he picks up the bag and heads in the opposite direction, 
      away from them and deeper into the building. 

                                  CHANNING (CONT D)
                    Bastard.

                                  WINTER
                    Tate!

      The elevator CLUNKS as it arrives.  The doors SCREECH as they 
      OPEN.  Moore appears.  It s quiet.  Apparently empty.  She 
      assesses the room, gun in front of her, totally professional.

      WE SEE TATE.  Clutching the bag, hiding behind a far pillar.  

      PAN AS TATE SEES: the window across from him, a tantalizing 
      FIRE ESCAPE just beyond its dusty pane.

      WE SEE WINTER/CHANNING/BO.  Hiding behind a near pillar. 

      Channing treads gingerly-- a slight CREAK.  They can t move.

      PAN to Bo, PAN AS BO SEES: a few steps in front of Moore: her 
      stuffed TURTLE.  Bo dropped it.

      As Moore walks beyond their hiding space, Bo breaks free from 
      Channing.  Winter and Channing are desperate to restrain her 
      or cry out but they can t, they can only watch helplessly as 
      Bo steps forward cautiously...

      At the same time Tate steps quietly towards the window, 
      sliding it open so he can reach the fire escape...                                                                                    53.


      As Moore turns towards one of the side rooms, Bo advances 
      slightly... Moore takes a step then Bo takes one, a tiptoeing 
      mimic getting closer to the object she left behind...

      Moore dips into an OFFICE and Bo makes her move, she s got 
      it!  She smiles and turns and heads back to the stairwell but 
      Moore is instantly on her, grabbing her roughly by the 
      shoulder and spinning her around--

                                  MOORE
                    Not so fast.

      Winter and Channing can t take it, they leap up--

                                  WINTER
                    Let her go!

      And Moore turns and SHOOTS Winter in the arm, he collapses, 
      Channing pulls him back--

                                  BO
                    Milton!

      Bo tries to get to him but Moore holds her back.  

      Tate has one leg outside the window, looks down at his escape 
      route but sees Moore holding Bo, the girl starting to cry, a 
      moment of decision for him--

      Channing cradles Milton, looks up at Moore with disgust--

                                  CHANNING
                    You bitch.

                                  MOORE
                    The next one s in your head for 
                    that.

      And she levels the gun at Channing when a hand comes from 
      nowhere and SWATS the gun away!  Moore turns-- it s Tate.  
      She smiles at him.

                                  MOORE (CONT D)
                    I thought you didn t hit women.

                                  TATE
                    I ll make an exception.

      Moore swings her fist with amazing speed but Tate is quick 
      and blocks it, a second punch comes and a third, Tate is 
      blocking them but she s pushing him back--                                                                                    54.


      Then he finds the space and swings back, and now it s Moore 
      blocking the punches, a close contact battle emerges-- rapid 
      blows, punches and kicks back and forth, each of them 
      blocking the strikes of the other.

      Moore s technique is impeccable and precise, while Tate s 
      roughness is complemented by his street instincts and 
      impressive strength.

                                  TATE (CONT D)
                    Go!

      Channing pulls Bo back to the stairs, Bo struggles against 
      her, not wanting to leave Tate behind--

      Tate is beginning to get the better of Moore, but she finds 
      an opening and KICKS Tate in the face.  He falls to the 
      floor, struggles to his knees, and she KICKS him again.  Now 
      he s really down.

      Moore retrieves her gun, panting for breath, wiping her 
      bloody lip, composing herself.  

      And Bo has stopped on the stairs, Winter leans on Channing 
      but urges her--

                                  WINTER
                    Bo come on...

      But Bo doesn t respond or turn, she simply watches in horror 
      as Moore turns towards Tate, levels the gun towards him--

      And Bo opens her mouth to SCREAM.  

      But the sound that comes out is not what we expect, it isn t 
      a girlish shriek-- it s more of a vibration, an otherworldly 
      echo on the verge of the supernatural, emanating from her 
      like some sort of shockwave.

      It gives everyone pause but the PIGEONS in the rafters 
      respond to it on some primal level, like a clarion call or 
      communal alarm, they instantly TAKE FLIGHT from their perches 
      and descend from above--

      But it s not with a sense of fear or flight, the birds seem 
      to be moving in unison, with a sense of purpose, they SWOOP 
      DOWN like a ribbon unfurling directly towards Moore.

      They fly around her in dizzying, synchronized circles, a 
      surging current of gray and white: enveloping her, obscuring 
      her, neutralizing her.

      Winter and Channing watch in amazement: a sense of wonder, 
      excitement... and maybe a little fear.                                                                                    55.


      Tate is also momentarily mesmerized by it, then he climbs to 
      his feet, moving towards the stairwell in careful steps--

                                  BO
                    Come on!  Come on!

      And he moves faster now, one last look at Moore and the 
      birds, and one last look at the duffel bag he s left behind 
      on the far side of the floor.  

      Then he hurries down the stairwell with the rest of them.  
      They re gone.

      Back to Moore.  The birds seem to slow.  There are moments 
      where her face and body within them become clearly visible.  
      And then, as quickly as they arrived, one takes the lead and 
      guides them in a flurry of directed movement through the 
      room, a comet SMASHING THROUGH a window and disappearing up 
      into the sky.

      Moore takes a breath.  Feathers and particulates float in the 
      air around her.  Scratches on her face, a feather stuck to 
      the blood on her forehead.  There s a second to process, and 
      her reaction is less of surprise... and maybe more of 
      something like admiration.

      She walks quickly but calmly towards the stairs.

      INT. GARAGE - DAY

      They re hurrying to get in Channing s car.  Moore enters the 
      garage and FIRES at them.  Tate jumps in the car and there s 
      a SCREECH of tires as Channing s car pulls out.  

      INT. CHANNING S CAR - SAME

      Channing driving, they re hurrying-- 

                                  BO
                    What happened, I don t understand--

      Winter tries to reassure her, while not knowing the answers 
      himself.

                                  WINTER
                    It s okay... it s like the other 
                    spookies, it s just... a little 
                    bigger...

      Channing looks in the REAR VIEW MIRROR to see Moore in her 
      car following them--                                                                                     56.


      INT. MOORE S CAR - DRIVING

      Moore driving like a maniac, on her phone--

                                  MOORE
                          (into phone)
                    Skouras.  There s something you 
                    haven t told me about the girl.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CHANNING S CAR - SAME

      Winter is grimacing, rummaging in his pockets, it s all VERY 
      FAST here--

                                  WINTER
                    We ll lead her away...

      Channing goes hard around the corner and slams on the brakes.  
      Winter hands Tate a crumpled wad of CASH.  

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    Take this, Bo knows where to go... 

                                  BO
                    Milton...

                                  WINTER
                          (sharply to her)
                    You have to go!  Now!

      Bo is startled, but she gets it.  Tate pulls her from the car 
      and they re dumped

      ON THE STREET

      and they watch as the car speeds off, Tate grabs Bo and pulls 
      her into an ALLEY and down behind a dumpster, he covers her, 
      we GO WIDER to see Moore s car speed by-- 

      She s gone.  It s quiet.  They stand up.  Tate touches his 
      right side above his hips-- his fingertips come back moist 
      with blood.  Bo looks at it--  

                                      END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                    57.


                                            ACT SIX

      EXT. STREET - DAY

      Residential area of SMALL HOUSES.  Tate and Bo walking-- he s 
      favoring his side.  He pulls out the money Winter gave him-- 
      wet with blood. 

                                  TATE
                    120 bucks for the next seven years.  
                    That ll work.  
                          (to Bo)
                    Winter told you where to go, right?

                                  BO
                    Right.  

      They walk.

                                  TATE
                    That thing back there.  How did you 
                    do that?

                                  BO
                    What do you mean?

                                  TATE
                    That thing with the birds.  What 
                    was that?  Does it happen a lot?

                                  BO
                    I don t want to talk about it.  

      She stops-- they ve arrived outside Cortez s house.  She 
      approaches the door and RINGS the bell.  Tate follows.

                                  TATE
                    Will they give us more dough here?

                                  BO
                    You mean for cookies?

                                  TATE
                    What?

      Cortez answers the door.  Bo smiles.

                                  BO
                    Cortez!

                                  TATE
                          (realizing)
                    Oh come on Bo let s go...                                                                                     58.


                                  CORTEZ
                          (to Bo)
                    What are you doing here?

                                  BO
                    I need to talk to you about Senga.  
                    And my friend needs help.  

      Bo lifts up his shirt to show the wound.  Cortez looks a 
      little intimidated by Tate, but his medical instincts kick in 
      and he begins to inspect it.

                                  CORTEZ
                    Whoa.  What happened there?

                                  BO
                    A mean woman shot him.

                                  CORTEZ
                    You were shot?

                                  TATE
                    It s nothing, I m fine.

                                  BO
                          (to Tate)
                    He s a doctor.  A really good 
                    doctor.

      Bo looks at Cortez, who appreciates the words but hesitates.

                                  CORTEZ
                    If you ve been shot, we have to 
                    report it to the police.

                                  TATE
                    Can you stop the bleeding first?  
                    I d appreciate that.

      Cortez nods and helps him inside.

      INT. CORTEZ HOUSE - KITCHEN DAY

      Cortez walks Tate towards the table.  

                                  CORTEZ
                    Lay down on the table.

      Tate lies down and Cortez grabs supplies from a cabinet.  Bo 
      takes a step or two into the                                                                                    59.


      LIVING ROOM

      where a VERY SICK OLD MAN (80s) is in a home hospital bed and 
      attached to an IV DRIP, a few more morphine vials stacked 
      next to it.  This is a hospice situation. 

      The man is near death, his breaths ragged.  Bo takes his 
      hand.  He sees Bo and manages a smile.  She smiles back.  Bo 
      turns to Cortez and Tate in the kitchen, never letting the 
      old man s hand go.  Cortez is stitching up Tate.

                                  BO
                    He s your father?

      Cortez nods.

                                  CORTEZ
                    He s barely conscious.  He only has 
                    a week left, at most.

      Cortez fills a syringe and gives Tate an injection.

                                  CORTEZ (CONT D)
                    These are antibiotics.

                                  BO
                    He s proud of you.

      Cortez doesn t look up.  Maybe a slight smile.

                                  CORTEZ
                    No he isn t.  He said he wouldn t 
                    come to me if I were the last 
                    doctor on earth.  He thinks I m 
                    weak.  Maybe I am.

                                  BO
                    You re not.  You can t quit.

      Cortez keeps working in silence.  Tate flinches a little.

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    What about Senga?

                                  CORTEZ
                    I told you.  I don t know who that 
                    is.  I never had a patient with 
                    that name.

                                  BO
                    I know.  I thought you knew Senga.  
                    Sometimes I get things wrong.  You 
                    don t know him yet.  But you will.                                                                                    60.


      She moves towards Cortez.

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    Senga lives in Congo.  He plays 
                    soccer like I do.  But one day 
                    they re gonna kick the ball too far 
                    and he ll have to run into the 
                    bushes to get it.  And he ll step 
                    on something.  And it will blow up 
                    and hurt him really bad.  He ll be 
                    scared and he ll be crying.  But 
                    he s lucky.  You ll save Senga.  

      Tate and Cortez both listen to Bo.  There s something 
      powerful about her words for both of them. 

                                  BO (CONT D)
                     The same way you re fixing him.  

      She points to Tate-- and Cortez realizes he s treated Tate 
      and didn t freeze for a second.  

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    Your father thinks you re a very 
                    good doctor.  He knows he was wrong 
                    and he s sorry.  He believes in 
                    you.

      The old man nods, very weakly.  Cortez swallows hard.  Then 
      he turns to Tate:

                                  CORTEZ
                    The bullet went in clean.  Keep it 
                    dry.  Try not to carry things.

                                  TATE
                    The police--

      He just puts up his hands-- doesn t want to know.

                                  CORTEZ
                    It s fine.
                          (beat)
                    I was thinking about applying to 
                    Doctors Without Borders.  But I 
                    didn t follow through with it.  How 
                    does she know that?

                                  TATE
                    I don t know.  She s a pain in the 
                    ass.

      Tate looks down at the stitchwork.                                                                                    61.


                                  TATE (CONT D)
                    That s a good job.

                                  CORTEZ
                    Of course.  I m a good doctor.

      Bo turns to him and smiles.

      EXT. CORTEZ HOUSE - DUSK

      Tate wears Cortez s hoodie as they stand there.  Tate looks 
      both ways on the street as the sun sets.

                                  TATE
                    Okay now where do we really go?

                                  BO
                    Bus station.  Flat Dune, Nevada.

      Tate nods.  He sees Bo is still looking up at the house.

                                  TATE
                    Look that was very touching.  But 
                    if this is going to work when we go 
                    to a new town, we re going to need 
                    some rules, okay?

                                  BO
                    Okay.

                                  TATE
                    Number one.  That doctor guy wasn t 
                    your business.  You re nosy.

                                  BO
                    But he fixed you.

                                  TATE
                    Yeah that was fine and all, but 
                    when we get somewhere you need to 
                    mind your own business.

      Bo looks at Tate skeptically.

                                  BO
                    What if a girl falls into a river?

                                  TATE
                    I don t care.  Now promise.

      They start walking as our song from the opening -- FEIST S 
      1234 -- starts up in a FULLY ARRANGED VERSION we:

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    62.


      INT. MOORE S CAR - DRIVING (MOS)

      She s speeding and finally reaching Channing s car.  

                                  BO (O.S.)
                    What if a man is walking on the 
                    side of the road and it s really 
                    hot and he drops a penny and it 
                    gets stuck in the melting road and 
                    then his hand gets stuck and then a 
                    truck is coming?

      Moore slams on the brakes.

      EXT. CHANNING S CAR - DUSK (MOS)

      Moore approaches.  The car is empty.  REVERSE POV to VERY FAR 
      AWAY-- as Channing and Winter watch her from a bluffside.

      BACK TO MOORE: looking up, and around... she gets it. 

      INT. OPERATIONS - LATER (MOS)

      They ve lost Tate and they re scrambling to find him-- 
      there s different surveillance cameras, satellite images, 
      facial recognition, the team still hard at work.  

                                  TATE (O.S.)
                    That s never happening.

                                  BO (O.S.)
                    But what if it did?

                                  TATE (O.S.)
                    You know it isn t.  Now promise.

      But Corey is focused on a monitor near his desk that shows a 
      NEWS CHANNEL-- a PHOTOGENIC SENATOR named ANNABELLE JACKSON 
      (40s) holds a press conference, CHYRONS on the bottom:

          SENATOR PLEADS FOR RETURN OF MISSING GIRL
                      SOURCES SAY FBI NOW INVOLVED

      Corey watches this, Senator Jackson speaks and he studies 
      her, somehow troubled by it, perhaps soon we ll learn why...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. DINER - NIGHT

      Closed for the night, the NEWS CHANNEL on here too-- Channing 
      looks up at the TV over Winter s shoulder as a TRUSTED DOCTOR 
      (40s, casual) sits next to him in the booth, stitching his 
      hand.  With his free hand Winter dials his phone...                                                                                    63.


      INT. SKOURAS  HOUSE - LIBRARY - NIGHT (MOS)

      Skouras in his lavish library.  He answers his ringing phone.

                                    SKOURAS
                    Hello?

                                  WINTER (O.S.)
                    She s protected again.  You lost 
                    your chance.

      Skouras doesn t seem entirely surprised to hear from him.

                                    SKOURAS
                    Protected by Tate?  I have to 
                    admit, that was pretty unexpected.  
                    But it s gonna blow up in your 
                    face.  

      Skouras hangs up and gets up from his desk, nursing his 
      scotch as he walks across his office... and we pass a series 
      of FRAMED PHOTOS, friends and VIPS:

      There s a recent one of him with SENATOR JACKSON-- they re 
      obviously friends.  And then another, less recent, maybe ten 
      years old, two men in suits celebrating something... a 
      younger Skouras with his arm around... WINTER.

                                  BO (O.S.)
                    What if a piece of the moon crashes 
                    into a house and they keep spiders 
                    in a cage but the cage breaks, and 
                    the person who lives next to them 
                    has a gorilla that is allergic to 
                    spiders? 

                                  TATE (O.S.)
                    I don t even know where to start 
                    with that one.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. CITY BUS STATION - NIGHT (MOS)

      The song KEEPS ON PLAYING and we follow FROM BEHIND as Tate 
      and Bo approach the bus station...

                                  BO
                    What s rule number two?

                                  TATE
                    Always do what I say.

      Bo thinks about it.                                                                                    64.


                                  BO
                    Okay.  But what if we re in an 
                    igloo and you have a cold and can t 
                    smell anything, and you tell me to 
                    light a candle but I smell gas?

      INT. DIRT FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY (MOS)

      A soccer game-- in AFRICA.  Two teams of BOYS play.  The game 
      heads downfield, the boys run... but one stops.  All alone, 
      we can probably guess his name, as his gaze turns towards the 
      sky... and follows the path of a small BUTTERFLY.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. BUS - NIGHT

      The song ends as Tate and Bo board the bus together. 

      INT. BUS - NIGHT

      Bo sits and Tate sits next to her, wincing.  Yesterday he was 
      on death row, but today is the first day of a life he doesn t 
      yet totally understand.  He looks all around, anxious to be 
      on the move.  Enemies could be anywhere.  

      Bo takes his hand, surprising him.  He looks at her.  She 
      looks in his eyes.

                                  BO
                    It s going to be fine.

      Tate lacks her belief, but he s aware that he s about to 
      embark on an extraordinary journey. 

      The bus begins to move, he keeps looking at her--

                                                                          TO BLACK.
