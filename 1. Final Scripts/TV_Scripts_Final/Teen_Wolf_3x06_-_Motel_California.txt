                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. MOTEL - DAY11

      Under a twilight sky, a PICKUP TRUCK surges into the lot of 
      an isolated and iconic 1950 s motel. The sign above the 
      office reads: Glen Capri.

      Stepping out of the truck, a dark figure of a MAN quickly 
      pulls a heavy BAG from the inside and slams the door shut. 
      With a noticeable limp, he hurries to the motel office.

      As the door clatters shut, a NEWSPAPER lying under the murky 
      glass of its dispenser reveals the date: March 5th 1977.

      EXT. MOTEL/2ND FLOOR BALCONY - DAY22

      The KEY for ROOM 217 shakily approaches the door. Knuckles 
      bruised and speckled with DRIED BLOOD, the Man steadies his 
      hand and unlocks the room.

      INT. MOTEL/ROOM 217/BATHROOM - NIGHT33

      Standing in front of the bathroom mirror, the Man holds an 
      unblinking stare on his own reflection, almost as if waiting 
      for something to happen.  

      Slowly, he unbuttons and removes his shirt to reveal a 
      bruised and slashed body. But then he twists around to reveal 
      a far more alarming wound at his lower back, just above his 
      hip--

      The unmistakable BITE of an ALPHA WEREWOLF.

      INT. MOTEL/ROOM 217 - NIGHT44

      Reaching up, the Man swiftly yanks open the blinds. A FULL 
      MOON rises behind the clouds in the night sky.

      Moving quickly, the Man kneels at his bag and pulls out a 
      sawed-off shotgun. With mounting panic, he rifles through his 
      pockets and dumps the contents to the floor--wallet, keys, 
      lighter, SHOTGUN SHELLS.

      He grabs the shells, fumbling them into the chamber of the 
      gun. Raising the weapon, he cocks it and swings the barrel 
      under his chin.        TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/132.

        CONTINUED:44

      Behind him, the MOON rises. Its pale light spills in through 
      the window, creeping over his shoulder.

      A BEAD of sweat trickles down his brow as a YELLOW GLOW 
      begins to fill his IRISES. Finger tightening around the 
      trigger, he whispers his last words...

                                  MAN
                    Nous chassons ceux qui nous 
                    chassent.

      EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT55

      A SHOTGUN BLAST tears through the night as the window of ROOM 
      217 lights with a FLASH and then turns red. 

      INT. MOTEL/ROOM 217 - NIGHT66

      BLOOD slips down the glass, over the chipped paint of the 
      radiator and down to where the dead man lies. 

      Seeping into the carpet, the blood pools under the still-
      smoking barrel of the shotgun, widens past the bag and 
      finally reaches the open WALLET. 

      His DRIVER S LICENSE visible, the name underneath the picture 
      of the handsome man reads--

       Alexander Argent. 

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT77

      The view of the Glen Capri changes, exterior updating as 
      modern cars whip past while buildings rise up to surround the 
      still iconic but no longer isolated motel.

      A SCHOOL BUS rumbles into the lot, doors swinging open. Coach 
      and his Cross Country team disembark. An exhausted Scott and 
      Stiles step out, followed by Allison and Lydia.

                                  SCOTT
                    I ve seen worse.

                                  STILES
                    Where have you seen worse?

      A WHISTLE BLOWS and Coach holds up a handful of ROOM KEYS in 
      front of the gathering students.        TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/133.

        CONTINUED:77

                                  COACH
                    Listen up. The Meet s been pushed 
                    to tomorrow morning. This is the 
                    closest motel with the most 
                    vacancies and least amount of good 
                    judgment in accepting a group of 
                      degenerates like yourselves. You ll 
                    be pairing up. Choose wisely.

      He begins handing the keys.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    You and you, fine. Scott, Stiles. 
                    Ethan, Danny--behave yourselves. 
                    Allison, Lydia... Allison, Lydia?

                                    ALLISON
                    Thanks Coach.

      Allison grabs a key as a confused Coach looks after them. But 
      then gets back to addressing his team.

                                  COACH
                    And I ll have no sexual perversions 
                      perpetrated by you deviants. Got 
                    that? Keep your dirty little hands 
                    to your dirty little selves.

      Keys taken, the team heads for their rooms while the bus 
      moves on to park. But one person remains, still gazing up at 
      the motel with concern--

                                    ALLISON
                    Lydia?

                                  LYDIA
                    I don t like this place.

                                    ALLISON
                    I don t think the people who own 
                    this place like this place. It s 
                    just for a night.

                                  LYDIA
                    A lot can happen in a night.

        Reluctantly, she follows Allison to the motel.

      EXT. MOTEL/2ND FLOOR BALCONY - NIGHT88

      While the other team members hurry past, Allison pauses to 
      glance at Scott down the balcony corridor. He gives her a 
      reassuring smile and disappears inside his room with Stiles.        TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/134.

        CONTINUED:88

      Stepping into her own room, Allison drops her bag. But then 
      notices Lydia still at the threshold, unwilling to enter.

                                    ALLISON
                    You re really freaked out, aren t 
                    you?

                                  LYDIA
                    I just have this feeling like 
                    coming here wasn t an accident.

                                    ALLISON
                    What do you mean? Like we were 
                    supposed to come here? Like fate?

                                  LYDIA
                    I don t know. Something.

      Allison takes her by the hand, drawing her inside.

                                    ALLISON
                    I don t believe in fate.

                                  LYDIA
                    Well, maybe you should start.

      As Allison draws her inside, the door slowly closes behind 
      them to reveal the room number: 217.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF

      INT. MOTEL/SCOTT AND STILES S ROOM - NIGHT99

      Exhausted, Scott falls back onto the bed, staring up at the 
      slowly spinning ceiling fan. Stiles falls in next to him.

                                  STILES
                    I have four.

                                  SCOTT
                    Four? How could you have four 
                    suspects?

                                  STILES
                    It was originally ten. Although, I 
                    might have listed Derek twice.

                                  SCOTT

                                  STILES
                    Just because he s missing doesn t 
                    mean he s dead.

                                  SCOTT
                    So if he s not dead, our chemistry 
                    teacher is out secretly committing 
                    human sacrifices?

      Scott and Stiles slowly turn to share a look.

                                  STILES
                    Yeah, made more sense in my head.

      Stiles hops off the bed, pacing nervously.

                                  SCOTT
                    What if it s someone else in the 
                    school? We never thought it was 
                    Matt killing people.

                                  STILES
                    Excuse me, I called that from day 
                    one.

                                  SCOTT
                    Yeah, but we never seriously 
                    thought it was Matt.

                                  STILES
                    I was serious. Quite serious. 
                    Deadly serious. No one listened.

                                  SCOTT
                    Who are your other three?

                                  STILES
                    Derek s sister, Cora. Nobody knows 
                    anything about her. And she s 
                    Derek s sister. Next, your boss.

                    Obi-Wan completely lied about Vader

                    I swear I ll watch it if we make it 
                    back alive. Who s the last one?

      Stiles sits down again and softly speaks the name of his 
      final suspect.

                                  STILES
                    Lydia.

      Scott glances to him, surprised.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    She was totally controlled by 
                    Peter. And she had no idea.

      Falling back on the bed again, Stiles s worried eyes drift to 
      the ceiling and the slowly spinning fan.

      INT. DEREK S LOFT - NIGHT1010

      Images blur past--brick and stone, the sliding door--all from 
      the POV of someone barely holding onto consciousness.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Derek--

      Jennifer appears, her face coming in and out of focus.

                                  JENNIFER (CONT D)
                    Oh God--this is a bad, very bad 
                    idea. I should be taking you to a 
                      hospital--

                                  DEREK
                    No... no hospital...

      Slipping out of his peripheral vision, she struggles to carry 
      him inside. DARK BOOTS move into Derek s sight. His own feet, 
      gingerly stepping into the safety of his loft.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Derek, I m losing you. I can t hold 
                      you--Derek.

      The world turns upside down as he collapses to the floor and 
      a wave of darkness surges in.

      EXT. MOTEL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT1111

      Boyd s reflection appears over the plexiglass of a vending 
      machine. He gazes over the selections of chips and candy bars 
      with an oddly vacant expression.        TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/137.

      CONTINUED:1111

      Stiles arrives behind him, smoothing out a dollar bill. He 
      watches Boyd slowly and methodically depress each button, 
      choosing the candy bar under number 201.

                                  STILES
                    Same thing I was going to get.

      The coils unwind to release the candy bar, but at the last 
      moment, it sticks.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Oh, don t worry, dude. I got a 
                    patented method for this.

      Stiles reaches up for the top of the vending machine to swing 
      it forward. But then he snaps his hands back when Boyd 
      PUNCHES a fist RIGHT THROUGH THE PLEXIGLASS. 

      Shards falling aside, Boyd calmly plucks the candy bar from 
      the steel coils. Then he turns and walks away, leaving a 
      shocked Stiles watching after him.

      INT. MOTEL/ROOM 217/BATHROOM - NIGHT1212

      Steam fills the bathroom, the shower running. Beneath the 
      spray, Allison pushes the water out of her hair and calls out 
      to the partially open door.

                                    ALLISON
                    Lydia, did you get new towels?

      She pulls the shower curtain aside to look out.

      Her voice catches in her throat when she sees Scott standing 
      in the doorway.

                    Looking for you.

      His demeanor is oddly calm. Tone of voice disconcertingly 
      monotone.

                                    ALLISON

                    So? I ve seen you naked.

      He steps past the door and into the bathroom. Allison pulls 
      the shower curtain closer.

                                    ALLISON
                    Okay, but you remember we re kind *

                    We re still friends, right? We *
                    could just be closer friends.

      He slowly approaches, not even seeming to blink.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    How do you know this wouldn t make 
                    things better? Maybe it could even 
                    fix things between us.

      He reaches up, fingers gliding over the plastic of the shower 
      curtain s edge. But Allison grabs him by the wrist.

                                    ALLISON
                    Scott.

      He blinks, pulling his hand back. Then looks at her in 
      confusion. He steps back, glancing about.

                    Are you okay?

                    Scott--

      But he s already rushing through the door, leaving a very 
      confused Allison standing there gripping the shower curtain 
      to her body.

      INT. MOTEL/FRONT DESK - NIGHT1313

      Dropping a stack of TOWELS onto the front desk, Lydia leans 
      across the counter to the DESK CLERK, an older woman turned 
      toward a TV.        TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/139.

                    Excuse me, but the card on the 
                    dresser says we have a non-smoking 
                    room. Yet somehow every one of our 
                    towels reeks of nicotine.

      The Desk Clerk turns around revealing a permanent 
        TRACHEOSTOMY TUBE in her throat.

                                  DESK CLERK
                    Sorry about that, sweetheart.

      Now trying to look at anything but the Desk Clerk s throat as 
      she grabs the towels, Lydia s eyes dart to the walls, 
      noticing something odd.

                                  LYDIA
                    What s that? That number.

      A FRAME hanging above the desk features the number  198  and 
      nothing else. Just the number.

                                  DESK CLERK
                    Oh, that s kind of an inside thing 
                    for the motel. My husband insists 
                    on keeping it up.

                                  LYDIA
                    What does it mean?

                                  DESK CLERK
                    It s a little morbid to be honest.

      THE RED DIGITAL NUMBERS on an old cable box sitting atop a 
      cheap TV blaring STATIC click to 199. Then to 200 and then 
      201. Both channels showing nothing but STATIC.

      Remote in his hand, Isaac sits on the bed, back to the 
      headboard. Eyes focused on the TV, he wears a strangely 
      glazed expression while his thumb mechanically presses from 
      one channel of static to the next.

      Isaac barely blinks as he continues clicking through

      Trembling hands tear at Derek s blood-stained shirt, ripping 
      it open. Jennifer blinks in shock not only at the severity of 
      the wounds but at the VISCOUS BLACK BLOOD seeping from them.

                    are you? Please don t die. Derek.

      She turns her ear to him, listening to his faint heartbeat 
      and shallow breathing. Finally, she takes a breath of her own 
      and lets her head fall to his bare chest.

      get closer.

      pauses, however, noticing the tiny cubes as they tumble in to 
      fill the recess. 

      Leaning closer, he notices a DARK SHAPE underneath the ice.

      Boyd lightly brushes the cubes aside with the tips of his

      he turns to run. THE ICE BUCKET drops from his hand, cubes 
      bouncing about the pavement as--

      INT. MOTEL/BOYD AND ISAAC S ROOM - NIGHT2020

      Isaac sits up in bed, glancing about the darkness.

                    Boyd?      TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/1316.

      But he s alone in the room. Easing back down, he closes his 
      eyes again, trying to fall back to sleep.

      A THUMPING comes from above. Peering up to the ceiling, Isaac 
      listens to HEAVY FOOTSTEPS. Someone moving hurriedly in the 
      second floor room just above.

      Isaac holds still as he hears a frighteningly familiar 
      voice...

                                  LAHEY (V.O.)
                    Hand me the seven sixteenths 
                    wrench.

      Isaac listens to the light CLATTER of steel tools. Until the 
      SHEERING of metal brings a shout of rage from Lahey.

                                  LAHEY (V.O.)
                    What the hell? That was the nine 
                      sixteenths, you moron.

                                  YOUNG ISAAC (V.O.)
                    But I thought--I didn t--

                                  LAHEY (V.O.)
                    You know what the difference 
                    between a seven and a nine is, 
                    dumbass? A stripped bolt.

                                  YOUNG ISAAC (V.O.)
                    Sorry, I didn t--I thought it was 
                    right. What do you want me to do?

                                  LAHEY (V.O.)
                    I want you to shut up. God, you re 
                    useless. I can t fix this now. I m 
                    not even going to be able to keep 
                    it closed. Grab the chains.

      Breath tightening in his throat, Isaac listens to the soft 
      footsteps. The rattle and clink of chains.

                                  LAHEY (V.O.)
                    Now get in.

                                  YOUNG ISAAC (V.O.)
                    What?

                                  LAHEY (V.O.)
                    Get in.

                    damn freezer.

                    GET IN.

      Isaac turns to get off the bed, but stops when he finds 
      himself facing the INSIDE WALL of an industrial FREEZER. He 
      turns to the other side to face the freezer s opposite wall.

      Gasping, he looks up as--THE FREEZER LID SLAMS SHUT.

      INT. MOTEL/ROOM 217 - NIGHT2121

      Allison watches Lydia quickly pack up her bag.

                    to leave.

                                    ALLISON
                    But they were suicides. Not 
                    murders. And it s not like the 
                    place is haunted, right?

                                  LYDIA
                    Maybe it is. I bet that couple did 
                    their suicide pact right in that 
                    exact room. Maybe that s why 
                    they re renovating it. Maybe 
                    they ve been scraping brain matter 
                    off the wood paneling.

                                    ALLISON
                    Maybe we should find out.

      INT. MOTEL/FRONT DESK - NIGHT2222

      A SIGN on the front desk reads  BACK AT 6AM . Lydia turns to 
      Allison with a defeated shrug.

                    Lydia, didn t you say the number 
                    was one ninety-eight?

      She glances up to the number on the wall. It now reads 201.*

                                  LYDIA
                    It was one ninety-eight. I swear to

      FADE IN:

      INT. ABANDONED MALL - NIGHT2323

      A GLOVED HAND reaches across the broken pieces of a tiled 
      wall inside the abandoned mall. Lowering his hand, Argent 
      takes a step back, carefully placing his feet into position, 
      arms reaching out as if to yank an unseen person--

      FLASHBACK - Ennis SLAMS into the wall, dust and debris 
      bursting up behind him.

      Argent pivots, then kneels, finding the exact place where--

      FLASHBACK - Boyd tumbles back to the floor, slashed in the 
      chest, blood flying.

      Argent focuses on the now dried blood spatter across the 
      pavement. He carefully retreats back, finding BOOT PRINTS in 
      the dust and dried blood. Placing himself in position of the 
      boots, he glances up to the BURN MARKS on the wall.

      Argent holds still, eyeing the dark burns on the concrete.

      FLASHBACK - Arrows soar past Derek, FLASHBOLTS EXPLODING into 
      brilliant whorls of light--

      INT. MOTEL/SCOTT AND STILES S ROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT2424

      The bathroom light FLICKERS above Scott as he stares at his 
      reflection in the mirror. He leans in, studying his eyes. 
      Closer and closer until he can see the tiny striations of 
      color within the iris.

      A GLIMMER OF RED ripples within the brown. Scott jerks back 
      from the mirror and--

      His phone RINGS. Shaking off the strange moment, Scott steps 
      out of the bathroom and picks up his cell from the night 
      table.

                                  SCOTT
                    Hey Mom, what s up?

      The only reply is a subtle yet disturbing STATIC.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Mom?

      Hearing the tremor in her voice, Scott presses the phone 
      tighter to his ear.

                    Mom, what s wrong? Mom?

                    I m sorry--he just came into the 
                    house. I tried to stop him. I m 
                    sorry--

                                    MELISSA (V.O.)
                    Outside. Look outside.

      Scott pulls the window blinds up. His mother, Melissa, stands 
      in the parking lot, holding the phone to her ear. Deucalion 
      stands next to her, CLAWED HAND wrapped around the back of 
      her neck, like he was grabbing a dog by its scruff.

                    want?

                                  DEUCALION
                    Isn t it obvious? You re an Alpha 
                    now, Scott.

                                  SCOTT
                    No, no I m not. Derek could still 
                    be alive. He could be--

                    He s dead. You know he is. So now 
                    I m coming for you. You and 
                    everyone you love. I m coming for 
                    all of them.

      EYES GLOWING RED, Deucalion rips his hand back, sending 
      DROPLETS OF BLOOD flying into the air as Melissa s knees 
      buckle--

                                  STILES
                    Scott?

      He spins to find Stiles in the doorway of the bathroom, a 
      toothbrush in his mouth. Scott turns back to the view of the 
      parking lot, but there s no one there.      TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/1321.

      Scott nods, still focused on the window. A VIBRATING makes 
      him jump. Stiles pulls out his cell phone.

      A MESSAGE from Lydia appears: Need to talk. Just you.

      Stiles slowly glances up from the odd request, noticing Scott 
      still at the window, still staring out.

      INT. MOTEL/ETHAN AND DANNY S ROOM - NIGHT2525

      Two pairs of BARE FEET slip across the bed spread, one 
        accidentally kicking a backpack to the floor. Making use of 
      only one of the beds, Ethan and Danny look up.

                                  ETHAN
                    Sorry.

                                  DANNY
                    Hell no.

      Smiling, Ethan pulls Danny s shirt off. They kiss, bodies 
      pressing close as Ethan s hands move from Danny s shoulder s 
      to his torso where his fingers brush against a small scar.

                                  ETHAN

      He pushes up, twisting his body to show a matching scar on 
      the other side.

                    It was surgery to correct misshapen 
                    cartilage I was born with. I had a 
                    metal bar put in when I was 
                    fourteen. It stayed there for two 
                    years to support my sternum so my 
                    lungs and heart wouldn t be

                    I don t really want them to. I like 
                    them. They make me feel like a 
                    survivor.

      Ethan nods, looking into his eyes with genuine affection.

                                  ETHAN
                    I hope you are.

      Danny peers back at him quizzically. But then Ethan kisses 
      him again, pulling him closer, hands moving up his back, 
      turning him turn over on the bed. 

      As Danny s fingers wrap around his neck, the VERTEBRAE in 
      Ethan s back RIPPLES up, splitting into TWO SEPARATE SPINES 
      beneath the skin.

      Ethan pulls back, a gasp in this throat.

                    Nothing.

      He looks at his hands, fingers trembling. Danny watches him, 
      confused, as he steps off the bed.

      Ethan shuts the door of the bathroom, locking it. Breathing 
      hard, he turns to the mirror, twisting around to view his 
      back when--

      SOMETHING PRESSES against the skin of his chest.

      Ethan sucks in a pained gasp, looking down at his rib cage 
      which begins to distend impossibly. And then he sees 
      something more horrifying--

      The face of his brother, Aiden, pushing through the skin. His 
      mouth opening as if screaming his way out of Ethan s body.      TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/1323.

      arms around his torso. He quickly grabs his shirt and pulls 
      it on, moving for the door.

      He slams through the door and--

      EXT. MOTEL/1ST FLOOR - NIGHT2828

      Out past the first floor rooms, Ethan hurries with his arms 
      wrapped tightly around him. When he sees a group of STUDENTS, 
      he diverts past them to the stairs, heading up to the second 
      floor.

                    Exactly. So can we get the hell out 
                    of here now?

      Stiles doesn t respond, eyes caught by the Bible.

      Without another word, the three of them go for the door.

      With Allison and Lydia behind him, Stiles twists the knob on 
      Room 216 but the door won t budge.

                    Isaac and Boyd and get them out of 
                    here.

      Stiles nods, starting away. Lydia, however, holds still when 
      she hears a surge of ELECTRICITY and the odd sound of BUZZING 
      coming from behind the door.

      The door bursts open, its flimsy lock snapping apart. Stiles 
      stumbles in and looks up to find Ethan raising the buzzing 
      HAND SAW to his abdomen.

      the fastest. She grabs the power cord and yanks it from the 
      wall.       TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/1326.

      Stiles seizes Ethan by the arms and manages to wrestle the 
      still spinning saw out of his hands. Slamming to the floor, 
      however, Stiles comes face-to-face with the blade, mere 
      millimeters from its razor sharp teeth as it jerks to a stop.

      Undeterred, Ethan opens his hands, CLAWS unsheathed. But 
      Allison latches onto one hand while Stiles grabs the other, 
      both trying to keep Ethan from literally gutting himself.

      The twin yanks them back, all three tumbling to the floor. 
      Ethan SLAMS into the WALL HEATER and instantly SNAPS his 
      hands away as if touching a burning pot. He whirls on Stiles.

                    What the hell? What are you doing?  

      Stiles, Allison and Lydia, all breathless and frightened, 
      look back at him, noticing the immediate change in his 
      demeanor.

      Bruised and blood-crusted hands pushing against his bed, 
      Derek struggles to rise. But Jennifer hurries over to ease 
      him back.

                    Not like this.

      She doesn t retreat from his stare, however. Instead, she 
      comes closer. Timid--even a little frightened--she softly and 
      cautiously presses her lips to his. 

      Derek barely responds at first. As if he doesn t even 
      remember how to kiss someone. But then--despite his injuries, 
      the bruises, the cuts on his body--he pulls Jennifer to him 
      and begins to kiss her back.

      INT. MOTEL/BOYD AND ISAAC S ROOM - NIGHT3333

      Room key gripped in his hand, Boyd sits on the edge of the 
      bed, a strangely far off look in his eyes. 

      THE CLOCK RADIO CLICKS ON and he snaps his head around to it. 
      Light STATIC surges from the small speaker. Boyd presses the 
      power button, turning it off.

      It clicks back on by itself. No static this time. Just an 
      airy silence. Boyd reaches to turn it off again--

      trembling hand away from the clock radio, it TURNS BACK ON.

      Boyd grabs the clock radio and yanks it up. The cord snaps 
      away from the wall. Even unplugged, it turns back on yet 
      again with an electric CRACKLE.

                                  YOUNG BOYD (V.O.)
                    Is she dead? Is it my fault? Is she 
                    dead--

      Boyd SLAMS the radio to the floor, SMASHING IT to pieces.

      Ethan hurries down the stairs to the first floor with Stiles,

                    Lydia, I didn t mean you re trying

      INT. MOTEL/BOYD AND ISAAC S ROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT3838

      Water plunges from the faucet of an almost full bathtub. 
      Boyd s reflection comes into view. He reaches down, twisting 
      the knob to stop the flow.

      Bare feet stepping into the water, Boyd calmly lifts the 
      motel safe up, carrying it into the tub with him. Carefully, 
      he lies back, letting the weight of the safe push down on his 
      chest.

      Lips and nose sinking beneath the surface, Boyd stares 
      blankly up at the ceiling. And begins to drown...

      INT. MOTEL/BOYD AND ISAAC S ROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT4040

      Through the open bathroom, Stiles and Lydia can be seen 
      rushing into the motel room, racing to Boyd s rescue.

      The safe half covers his body, keeping him completely 
      submerged. Stiles dives his hand into the water, searching 
      about for the drain.

                                  STILES
                    He blocked it--he blocked the drain

      Unable to even budge the safe an inch, they let go. Stiles 
      steps back and his hand hits the hot radiator behind him. He 
      yanks it away and then does a doubletake.

      EXT. MOTEL/2ND FLOOR PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT4141

      Allison hurries around a corner, nearly running into TWO 
      STUDENTS.

      Stiles runs to the bus in the lot. Yanking open the rear

      She quiets, hand coming to her mouth to cover the sound of 
      her own breathing. Hearing SOMEONE ELSE BREATHING.

        Ever-so-slowly, Lydia kneels to look under the bed and GASPS 
      when she sees--

      ISAAC. Curled up in a fetal position, he stares right back at 
      her with wide terror-stricken eyes.

      Lydia staggers back to her feet and spins around just as 
      Stiles hurtles into the room.

      Charging into the bathroom, he yanks the cap off and--nothing

                    lights it!

      Stiles twists the flare around and sees the coarse burgundy 
      surface of the cap is indeed just like a match. He rubs it 
      against the end of the flare, trying to light it.

      The flare IGNITES and Stiles shoves it into the bathtub, 
      BURNING BOYD.

      THE SAFE TILTS UP as Boyd lurches out of the water, gasping 
      for air. Eyes darting about as if just now realizing where he 
      is, he grabs hold of the safe and lifts it up.

      With a METALLIC THUD, the safe drops back onto the floor of 
      the bathroom in front of Lydia and Stiles. Breathless, they 
      look up from the safe to Boyd now standing in the bathtub, 
      dripping wet and pulling in deep breaths.

      His back gently presses to the tile wall behind him and he 
      slumps down.

      In the main room, underneath the bed, a terrified Isaac 
      watches Stiles kneel down to peer in at him.

                    Hey, Isaac. Got something here for

      toward him.

      Just as he s starting off, however, they all hear the 
        unmistakable SPARKING of an already LIT FLARE.

      All eyes turn to find Scott standing just past the parked 
      cars and holding the flare in one hand. Strangely, he s 
      dripping wet. Literally soaked all over. But the trail of 
      liquid leading to a tell-tale ORANGE CONTAINER nearby tells

      across his chest while the wounds over his body complete 
      their healing.

      EXT. MOTEL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT5151

      One careful but deliberate step at a time, Stiles approaches 
      Scott. He reaches out. Scott s fingers tighten around the 
      flare. But Stiles gently grasps it and slowly pulls it from 
      his hand. 

      As the others breathe in relief, Stiles tosses the sparking 
      flare aside.

      Lydia watches it tumble across the pavement. Until a strange 
      GUST OF WIND sends it rolling back, right toward the pool of 
      gasoline.

                                  LYDIA
                    NO!

      Darting forward, she pushes Scott and Stiles to the ground as 
      a FIREBALL ERUPTS behind them.

      Flames flickering toward the sky, Lydia spots something 
      within the black smoke. Something appearing out of the 
      darkness, almost right out of hell--

      A FACE with severe lacerations scarring the ashen skin, as if 
      it had been slashed over and over by claws. Its round eyes 
      focused on Lydia, the creature bares rotted teeth at her with 
      a hate-filled SHRIEK.

      And then VANISHES into the shadows.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      INT. BUS - DAY5252

      With the bright sunlight streaming in through its windows, 
      the door of the bus yanks open and Coach steps inside 
      followed by the Cross Country Team.

      Everyone pauses, however, to notice something odd...       TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/1341.

      CONTINUED:5252

      Scott, Stiles, Lydia, Allison, Isaac and Boyd, all begin to 
      wake up in the seats, clearly having spent the rest of the 
      night on the bus.

                                  COACH
                    I don t want to know. I really 
                    don t. But, in case you missed the 
                      announcement, the Meet s canceled. 
                    We re headed home. Pack it in.

      While the team quickly fills the bus, Scott looks up to see 
      Ethan approach.

                                  ETHAN
                    I don t know what happened last 
                    night, but I know you probably 
                    saved my life.

                                  STILES
                    Actually, I saved your life. But 
                    doesn t matter really. Minor 
                    detail.

                                  ETHAN
                    So, I m going to give you 
                      something... We re pretty sure 
                    Derek s still alive.

      Scott and Stiles share a look of surprise.

                                  ETHAN (CONT D)
                    But he killed one of ours. That 
                    means one of two things can happen. 
                    Either he joins our pack--

                                  SCOTT
                    And kills his own.

                                  ETHAN
                    Or Kali goes after him. And we kill 
                    him. That s the way it works.

                                  STILES
                    Your little code of ethics is kind 
                    of barbaric FYI.

      Ethan gives a final nod and steps past Allison and Lydia s 
      seat. Noticing something, Lydia stands. 

                                  LYDIA
                    Coach, can I see your whistle for a 
                    second?      TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/1342.

      Before he can respond, Lydia reaches for the whistle just 
      below his neck. When she lifts it a stain of PURPLE DUST is 
      revealed on his shirt.

                                  COACH
                    I want that back.

      As he turns, Lydia puts her hand over the whistle s air vent 
      and gives it a short breath. With Stiles and the others 
      watching, she turns her palm up to show a bit of PURPLE DUST.

                                  STILES
                    Every time Coach blew the whistle 
                    in the bus--Scott, Isaac, Boyd--

                                  LYDIA
                    And Ethan.

                                  SCOTT
                    We all inhaled it.

                                    ALLISON
                    You were all poisoned by it.

                                  STILES
                    That s how the Darach got into 
                    their heads. That s how he did it.

      Grabbing the whistle out of Lydia s hand, he tosses it right 
      out the open window. Then turns back to see Coach glaring at 
      him.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    I ll buy you a new one.

      INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY5353

      The door to a patient room clicks open and Argent cautiously 
      steps inside. A silhouetted figure sits in a wheelchair by 
      the sunlit window.      TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/1343.

                    Twice in a month. Should I be 
                      flattered?

      Argent turns the wheelchair around to reveal his father, 
      Gerard. Not dead. But the mountain ash combined with the 
      Alpha bite has left him strangely disabled, a constant stream 
      of black blood dripping from his nose which he periodically 
      dabs at with a handkerchief.

                                  ARGENT
                    In 1977, my uncle, Alexander 
                    Argent, checked into the Glen Capri 
                    Motel for a one night stay. In room 
                    217, he used a shotgun to blow out 
                    the back of his skull. The autopsy 
                    report noted an unusual looking 
                    animal bite in his side.

                                  GERARD
                    If you ve already got all the 
                      information, what do you want from 
                    me?

                                  ARGENT
                    I want to know the Alpha that bit 
                    him. I want his name.

      Gerard looks up, black blood seeping through his teeth.
