Day breaks. Hassan (50) arrives at a solitary house made of
adobe, in the southern deserts of Morocco, carrying a satchel
and a large bundle wrapped in cloth.
He walks past a corral made out of branches, where several
goats bleat, and knocks on the front door.
2
Abdullah (40), opens.
HASSAN
(In Arabic)
Good morning Abdullah... I brought
you this...
He holds up the bundle.
3
Hassan and Abdullah's family are behind the house. Hassan
stands with the rifle in front of a rock some twenty yards
away and he turns toward Abdullah.
HASSAN
With this rifle, your sons will be
able to kill plenty of jackals.
He aims at the rock and pulls the trigger without holding
the rifle properly. It is clear that he doesn't know how to
fire a weapon, and the shot cracks loudly. The rifle kicks
and hits him roughly in the shoulder. The bullet flies far
wide of the rock. The women laugh nervously.
Rubbing his shoulder, Hassan turns to Abdullah.
HASSAN (CONT'D)
Let one of your sons shoot.
Abdullah looks at his boys and points at the younger one.
ABDULLAH
Let Yussef shoot.
When Hassan is about to hand Yussef the rifle, Ahmed cuts
him off, upset.
AHMED
I want to shoot first.
Father and son exchange an angry glance. Hassan, without
realizing it, turns and gives the rifle to Ahmed. The boy
grabs the gun: it is heavier than he thought.
HASSAN
Look, load it like this.
Hassan opens the chamber, inserts the bullet and then closes
it. Once it is loaded, he points at the safety.
HASSAN (CONT'D)
This is the safety. Push it in when
you're ready.
Ahmed nods. Unsure of himself, he raises the rifle and,
almost without aiming, fires. The shot kicks up dust far
from the rock. His sisters laugh.
3.
HASSAN (CONT'D)
If he doesn't hit the jackals, at
least he'll scare the shit out of
them.
Ahmed lowers the rifle. His father grabs it and gives it to
Yussef enthusiastically.
ABDULLAH
Your turn.
Yussef grabs the rifle and loads it confidently. He lifts
the rifle with ease and takes his time aiming. He seems
innately skilled at the maneuver. He shoots and the bullet
hits just below the rock.
Abdullah celebrates the shot and mockingly turns to Hassan.
ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
Now this kid shoots a hell of a lot
better than you.
5
Yussef takes one of the goats out, ties and ropes it and
gives it to Hassan. Abdullah supervises. Yasira approaches
and gives Abdullah a bag.
YASIRA
Your lunch.
Abdullah takes it and turns to his sons.
ABDULLAH
You better kill at least three
jackals.
HASSAN
And make sure no one sees you with
the rifle, hide it if you see someone
approach you.
Ahmed nods.
Abdullah and Hassan go on their way.
6
Yasira and Yamil are far from the house, cleaning some
goatskins stretched out on some branches.
Ahmed, with the rifle in his hands, opens the corral gate
and enters to herd them out. He calls his brother.
AHMED
Yussef, Yussef...
4.
7
Yussef is squatting on the other side of the house, spying
through a crack, breathing excitedly.
8
Yussef is still spying.
Ahmed approaches.
AHMED
What are you doing?
Yussef turns around and signals for him to lower his voice.
AHMED (CONT'D)
I told you not to spy on her again.
Yussef pays no attention and keeps spying. Ahmed pulls him
by the shoulder and makes him lose his balance. Yussef falls
on his ass.
AHMED (CONT'D)
I said don't spy on her.
Yussef gets up and dusts himself off.
YUSSEF
What the hell do you care?
AHMED
Come on, let's go.
He turns around and leaves.
10
The goats graze. Yussef and Ahmed watch them sitting on the
side of a hill. They look hot and bored. They both throw
stones at a small rusty can. Yussef throws one and misses.
Ahmed throws his and does. He draws a line in the ground.
AHMED
Five to two.
A jackal is stalking the goats.
Yussef spots it.
5.
YUSSEF
There's a jackal over there.
Ahmed raises his head but cannot see it. Yussef points at
it, but Ahmed still cannot locate it. Yussef despairs.
YUSSEF (CONT'D)
Over there.
Ahmed finally spots it. He loads the rifle, but when he is
about to aim, the rifle fires. The shot hits amidst the
goats, lifting up a small cloud of dust.
YUSSEF (CONT'D)
What are you doing, you idiot?
The jackal flees, terrified, while the goats scamper in
different directions.
11
Both brothers are sitting under a tree, eating bread and
drinking water from a goatskin canteen.
YUSSEF
Zora doesn't mind.
Ahmed keeps eating without turning to look at his brother.
AHMED
She doesn't, but I do.
YUSSEF
This is between her and me.
AHMED
You're both pigs. Next time I'm
going to tell my dad.
YUSSEF
Stay out of this.
AHMED
If you want me to stay out of it,
don't do it.
Yussef gets annoyed, stand up and leaves.
12
The brothers are sitting apart from each other.
Ahmed guards
the goats with the rifle on his lap.
After a while, Yussef goes to sit behind a large rock. He
makes sure his brother isn't watching and he pulls his pants
down to start masturbating.
6.
When he is at his most concentrated, a shot rings out and
startles him. He quickly pulls his pants up and another
shot rings out. Yussef gets up to see what his brother is
doing.
Ahmed is aiming the rifle at a rock some two hundred yards
away. He fires a third time.
Yussef runs up to him.
YUSSEF
What are you doing?
Ahmed doesn't pay attention, and focuses on the rock in the
distance.
AHMED
Hassan said that it could hit things
three kilometers away, but it can't
even reach that rock over there.
YUSSEF
That's because you don't know how to
shoot. Give me the rifle.
Ahmed looks at his brother defiantly, then hands the rifle
over. Yussef aims and fires. The shot echoes through the
vast desert; the frightened goats scamper a few yards away.
AHMED
See, it can't reach it.
YUSSEF
Give me another bullet.
Yussef aims and fires. The bullet hits the rock and kicks
up a lot of whitish dust.
YUSSEF (CONT'D)
See.
AHMED
Yeah, but that's not three kilometers.
Ahmed remains pensive and suddenly starts climbing to the
top of the hill. Once at the top, he looks around for a
moment and then calls his brother.
AHMED (CONT'D)
Yussef, come here.
Yussef climbs the slope. Ahmed signals a road that in the
distance cuts across the great desert plain, and points out
a traffic sign that indicates a curve ahead.
7.
AHMED (CONT'D)
I bet you the bullet can't hit that
far away.
Ahmed loads the rifle and aims at the sign.
He fires and
nothing.
AHMED (CONT'D)
These fucking bullets aren't any
good.
YUSSEF
You're not aiming right.
Yussef points at a yellow car driving along the road.
YUSSEF (CONT'D)
What'll you give me if I hit that
car?
AHMED
I'll shoot.
Ahmed reloads. The empty cartridge falls to the ground. He
fires again - the car keeps going. Yussef asks for the rifle.
AHMED (CONT'D)
You see?
Nothing happens.
YUSSEF
Let me shoot.
He also drops the used cartridge on the ground, reloads and
shoots the traffic sign. He fires and nothing.
AHMED
I told you.
Hassan's a liar.
A bus approaches.
Ahmed points at it.
AHMED (CONT'D)
Shoot at that one...
Yussef loads the rifle parsimoniously, shuts the chamber,
raises the weapon, aims and fires.
The bus drives on.
Ahmed turns to his brother.
AHMED (CONT'D)
See: nothing.
The bus drives on another three hundred yards and suddenly
stops in the middle of the road.
8.
13
Amelia and the kids walk down a street in Santa Monica.
20
Amelia and the kids are standing in front of a house, talking
with Lucia (22), who is dressed in a black and white uniform.
LUCIA
(Both in Spanish)
I can't Amelia.
AMELIA
Please, it's my son's wedding. I
helped you out with that thing with
your boyfriend.
LUCIA
I really can't.
AMELIA
Just for the day, Lucia.
I'll be
back for them tonight.
LUCIA
And what do I tell Mrs. Black?
AMELIA
Tell her they're your nephews.
Lucia looks down at the blonde-haired, blue-eyed children.
LUCIA
Yeah right, they look just like
me...with this gringa look I have.
21
A run-down '88 Ford Pinto parks in front of the house and
honks its horn. The front door opens and Amelia walks out,
carrying the small suitcase, with the two kids.
Santiago (24), a young Mexican with light eyes.
SANTIAGO
(Both in Spanish)
Good morning Aunt Amelia.
AMELIA
Good morning.
Santiago, surprised, looks at the children.
SANTIAGO
Are they coming?
AMELIA
I couldn't find anyone to leave them
with. Their parents aren't coming
back today.
SANTIAGO
Why bring them, they're just going
to make trouble.
AMELIA
They're good kids.
SANTIAGO
I know a woman who can take care of
them.
AMELIA
Santiago, I have to take them. I
can't leave them with just anybody.
SANTIAGO
What if you lose your job?
AMELIA
Come on, don't tempt the fates.
Amelia opens the door for the children to get in.
23
Richard (45), tall, thin, weathered, and Susan (38), good-
looking, with an athletic body, visit the impressive Casbah
with a group of American, French and English tourists. Most
of them are old, with a few couples in their forties or
fifties.
15.
Anwar (30), a man with a kind face, is the tour guide showing
them around.
ANWAR
(In English, with an
Arabic accent)
The Berbers built these kasbahs.
They made them like forts and here
they would reside after finishing
their caravans.
Richard listens attentively.
Susan looks hot.
RICHARD
This place is beautiful, don't you
think?
SUSAN
(not very
enthusiastically)
Yeah, yeah it's very pretty...
Anwar walks toward one end of the aisles and calls the group.
ANWAR
Now, I'd like to show you the
materials that were used to build
the walls...
The herd moves docile toward Anwar's voice.
24
The group of tourists spread about a small eatery with open
air tables on a dusty terrace. A bus is parked behind them.
At a table, on one end of the terrace with views to a cluster
of mountains, Richard and Susan look through some menus.
Richard seems at ease in this place. Susan appears to be
bothered by the dust and otherness.
A waiter brings a plate and some cutlery.
WAITER
(in broken English)
You want to order?
RICHARD
I'll have a chicken cous-cous and a
Coke, please.
SUSAN
What do you have that doesn't have
fat in it?
WAITER
Everything is delicious.
16.
Susan reads the menu again.
SUSAN
I'll have the fried eggplant and a
diet Coke.
WAITER
We don't have diet Coke.
SUSAN
Then a regular Coke.
The waiter smiles and goes to place the order. Susan takes
out a small bottle with antibacterial gel, cleans her hands
and then starts wiping the plate and the cutlery thoroughly.
Richard looks at the mountain range through a pair of
binoculars. He spots a hawk flying over the plains.
RICHARD
Look, look: a hawk.
Richard follows the hawk with his binoculars for a few seconds
and then puts them down.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
This country is incredible.
Susan remains silent and then turns to look at him.
SUSAN
Richard, why did we come here?
RICHARD
What d'you mean why? I thought you
would like it.
SUSAN
Really: why are we here?
Richard knows that Susan's answer implies something else.
RICHARD
To forget everything, to be alone.
Susan, sardonically gestures toward the other tourists with
her chin.
SUSAN
Alone?
Richard sighs in disappointment. The waiter arrives with
the Cokes and the food, which does not look particularly
appetizing. He leaves everything on the table and goes.
Richard is about to pour his drink when Susan stops him.
17.
SUSAN (CONT'D)
Throw out the ice.
RICHARD
The Coke is warm.
SUSAN
Yeah, but you don't know what kind
of water is in there.
She grabs Richard's glass and tosses out the ice. Then she
does the same thing with hers. They are quiet for a moment.
RICHARD
Why can't you ever relax.
You're
always stressed.
SUSAN
You're the one stressing me out.
You're why I can't relax.
RICHARD
You could if you tried.
SUSAN
Tried? Don't you think I tried?
RICHARD
You're never going to forgive me,
are you?
SUSAN
Do you even know what I'm talking
about?
RICHARD
Susan, please; we didn't come all
this way just to argue.
Susan gets angry and faces him.
SUSAN
Oh, we didn't? Then when are we
supposed to "argue"? Or are you
planning on running away again?
Richard sighs, defeated. They stop speaking and sit looking
at the mountains.
25
The tourists crowd around to board the bus. Some boys in
rags approach to sell them trinkets.
BOYS
Stilo...stilo...
18.
Some of the tourists buy them. They come to Susan, who
becomes instantly uncomfortable. She gestures with her hand
to say they have no money, but the kids insist.
BOYS (CONT'D)
Stilo...stilo...
SUSAN
I don't have any money... I don't
have any...
Richard takes off his binoculars and gives them to the
youngest of the boys (7), who receives them with wide eyes.
RICHARD
Here.
SUSAN
What are you doing?
Richard just gets in the bus. Susan stares at the boy with
the binoculars for a moment and then gets in.
26
The bus drives down a straight road that divides the desert.
28
Yasujiro parks his car and Chieko gets out.
YASUJIRO
(in sign language)
Don't forget you have the dentist at
four.
Chieko looks annoyed, and blows her father a kiss goodbye.
As she is about to get out of the car, Yasujiro grabs her
arm. She turns to look at him.
22.
YASUJIRO (CONT'D)
(In sign language)
I love you very much.
They exchange a glance.
She nods, closes the door and leaves.
33
Ahmed and Yussef run full speed, herding their goats as they
go. Some of them get left behind and Yussef hurries back to
them. As they climb a hill, he slips and falls, rolls
downhill and drops the rifle, which slides a few meters away.
Ahmed runs to help him. Yussef gets up, covered in dust and
with a scratch on his forehead. Ahmed picks up the rifle.
AHMED
Hurry up, man, hurry...
25.
Ahmed runs off, hands flailing, to herd the straggling sheep.
Yussef follows him, limping.
38
The brothers make it back home. Agitated, they put the goats
back into their corral. Zora walks out and approaches them.
ZORA
What's wrong?
Yussef, busy closing the corral gate, pays no attention.
Ahmed, breathing agitatedly, doesn't answer.
ZORA (CONT'D)
I asked you what's wrong.
Ahmed, full of adrenaline, glances angrily at her.
AHMED
What do you care, whore?
Yussef gets in the way.
YUSSEF
Don't talk to her like that.
Yussef steps up to defend her, but Ahmed spins around and
goes into the house. Yussef turns to Zora.
YUSSEF (CONT'D)
Something we ate make us sick so we
came back.
Without another word, Yussef also goes into the house.
39
The brothers are hanging the strips of meat on ropes to dry
them in the sun.
An old Valiant packed with seven men parks in front of the
house and Abdullah gets out. He raises his hand to say
goodbye.
ABDULLAH
Thank you, I'll see you tomorrow.
The driver also raises his hand and then drives off.
Abdullah
turns to Yussef.
ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
Tell your mother to prepare dinner.
Abdullah turns towards the house. Yussef comes out running
towards a little field below the house. Yasira is plowing
with a manual plow.
YUSSEF
Mother, mother, father says he wants
to have dinner now.
42
Santiago's car crosses the border between San Diego and
Tijuana. They drive through a green light at the crossing,
easily entering Mexico without being stopped by three Mexican
customs officials.
29.
45
They drive through Tijuana.
47
The children eat their popsicles as they walk through the
endless aisles of stalls, past the vendors and their incessant
banter.
30.
MIKE
What's this flavor called?
Santiago answers before Amelia.
SANTIAGO
(In Spanish)
Cajeta... it's called cajeta.
MIKE
(Mispronouncing)
Cayeto...
Santiago laughs.
SANTIAGO
No, cajeta... cajeta...
MIKE
Cajeto, cajeta... It's the best thing
I've ever tasted in my life.
(A beat)
Can I buy some for my mom? She's
gonna love them.
Amelia smiles and nods.
49
The car drives out of the city and gets on a highway.
The
desert rises in all its magnitude and severity.
50
Santiago parks the car next to a junkyard.
Amelia and Debbie
run out and hide behind a fence.
Debbie pulls her underpants down to pee.
Troubled, she looks
at the mound of destroyed cars.
DEBBIE
Are they crashed cars?
AMELIA
Yes...
DEBBIE
Did lots of people die?
AMELIA
I guess so...
DEBBIE
I don't like Mexico.
31.
51
They drive down the highway and then turn onto a path. They
drive down the path at high speed, lifting up clouds of dust.
52
They arrive at a dusty hamlet in the middle of the desert; a
few houses, no more than twenty, some adorned with
multicolored paper.
Several crates of soda are stacked up against a makeshift
shed built out of yucca fronds. A group of musicians who
play Nortea music are setting up their instruments.
There are various pickup trucks and smuggled cars parked
around the hamlet. The guests are wearing their best: fresh
shirts, big buckles, almost new boots.
Santiago parks. Amelia gets out first.
A group of people
sees her and comes over to greet her.
COMADRE 1
(All in Spanish)
Hey, so you finally made it.
Amelia smiles.
Her friends notices Mike and Debbie.
COMADRE 1 (CONT'D)
You brought them?
Amelia nods. Luis (24), Amelia's son, a typical Norteo
cowboy with long sideburns and moustache, his face tanned
from days under the sun, wearing a pistachio-colored tuxedo
with a cloth flower in the lapel, greets Amelia with a kiss.
LUIS
Hi mom, how're you doing?
She looks him up and down.
AMELIA
Son, you look like Pedro Infante.
COMADRE 1
More like Luis Miguel.
AMELIA
Where's the bride?
LUIS
She's not here yet.
AMELIA
What d'you mean she's not here yet?
32.
LUIS
Well, she ain't here.
Mike and Debbie, struck dumb by the language and the
strangers, hide behind Amelia, who introduces them to Luis.
AMELIA
Look son, these are Mike and Debbie,
the kids I take care of.
Luis holds his hand out ceremoniously.
LUIS
Pleased to meet you Mike.
Santiago calls out to some kids who are running around.
SANTIAGO
Psst.
Lucio, come here.
Lucio (10), the oldest of the gang, approaches.
Santiago
gestures toward the two American kids.
SANTIAGO (CONT'D)
These are Mike and Debbie. Keep an
eye on them for me.
Lucio gives them a scornful glance and calls them over half-
heartedly.
LUCIO
Come with me.
With her hand, Amelia signals to the kids that it's ok to go
with him. Shyly, Debbie and Mike follow.
53
The bus is in the middle of the road.
Several of the tourists are hiding under their seats,
frightened. The driver, still ducking, looks toward the
mountains to try to piece together what happened.
Richard holds Susan against his shoulder, blood gushing from
her neck. Her eyes are open and staring at a fading world.
Richard takes Susan from under her armpits and carefully
lays her down on the aisle. Anwar runs over to help.
RICHARD
Take it easy honey, take it easy.
Anwar takes his shirt off - left only in his undershirt -
and puts it under Susan's neck.
SUSAN
(mumbling senselessly)
I'm ok... I'm ok...
Susan breathes in, and every time she does, blood flows from
her wound. Richard turns toward the other passengers.
RICHARD
Is anybody a doctor?
Nobody answers.
Richard starts to lose his cool.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
Please: a doctor.
The pensioners don't answer; they are too scared. Richard
opens Susan's purse and sees a cell phone. He turns it on
and tries to call, but there is no signal. He turns to Anwar.
34.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
Where's the nearest hospital?
ANWAR
It's far away, about four hours.
(a beat)
There's a clinic that's a little
closer, about an hour and a half to
the south. By bus it'll take us about
two hours and a half though.
RICHARD
Does that takes away from Marrakesh?
ANWAR
Yes, but it's the closest thing we've
got.
Richard runs down the aisle and gets out of the bus.
55
No cars drive by. The road is almost deserted. In the
distance, a run-down Renault approaches. Richard stands in
the road to stop it.
The car brakes and Richard runs toward the driver: an old
peasant traveling with his eight year-old grandson.
RICHARD
I need your help. We were attacked.
OLD MAN
(In Arabic)
I don't understand...
Richard grows desperate.
RICHARD
Help... hospital...
OLD MAN
(In Arabic)
I don't understand you sir.
Richard sees that Anwar and the bus driver have gotten out
of the bus and he starts shouting at them for help.
RICHARD
Tell him we need his help.
With the distraction, the old man drives off. Richard watches
helplessly as they drive away and he grabs Anwar by the arm.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
Let's take her to the clinic.
35.
56
The bus makes a U-turn and drives away at full speed.
57
The bus bounces its way down the straight highway.
59
The bus leaves the main road and turns into a dirt road.
61
The bus pulls into a small group of houses. Several children
run beside the bus, chasing it. Some gaunt dogs get out of
the way to let the bus by.
63
The bus pulls up in front of a modest house.
64
Richard carries her into the house through a crowd of curious
children.
66
They walk through a dusty patio and Anwar points at some
stairs. Richard climbs them with difficulty and Anwar opens
the door to a room.
ANWAR
Here... here...
68
The bus is still parked in front of the house. As soon as
Richard walks out, the pensioners approach him.
DOUGLAS
How is your wife?
RICHARD
Bad. Very bad.
Tom (51), a fat English passenger, faces him.
TOM
Get her outta there and let's go.
RICHARD
And where should I take her?
TOM
In Egypt, in a town like this, they
slit thirty German tourists' throats.
They might do the same to us.
39.
Anwar listens and intervenes.
ANWAR
No, not here.
TOM
(Aggressively)
What do you know? We have to get
out of here as soon as possible.
Lilly (79), an old woman, approaches.
LILLY
It's very hot, sir, and the driver
turned off the air conditioning.
I'm feeling sick.
RICHARD
You can't leave us here.
James (82), Lilly's husband, steps forward.
JAMES
What's the use in staying?
RICHARD
In case I need the bus.
JAMES
They can go drop us off and then
come back for you.
Douglas (75), a tall old man with good posture, interjects.
DOUGLAS
I'll stay with you if you need me.
Elyse (73), his wife, scolds him.
ELYSE
And why would you stay?
RICHARD
Please wait.
Let me try to deal
with this.
TOM
We're not going to risk our lives,
so hurry.
Douglas looks defiantly at Tom.
DOUGLAS
You do what you have to do, we'll
wait.
40.
70
Richard and Anwar walk down the streets of the small hamlet
before the people's inquisitive gaze. They arrive at a
general store with all sorts of roots and grains displayed
outside. Anwar walks over to the owner.
ANWAR
(in Arabic)
We need your phone.
I'll pay for
the call.
71
Anwar goes out to the patio and fetches a metal basin full
of soil. He goes to a well, scoops out some water with a
gourd and washes out the basin.
Anwar is walking back when he is stopped by Mohammed, his
brother, a fat man (32) with curly hair and a tanned face.
MOHAMMED
(the entire dialogue
in Arabic)
Why did you bring them here?
43.
Anwar doesn't pay attention to him and keeps walking toward
the room. His brother catches up to him.
MOHAMMED (CONT'D)
You should have consulted with us.
Anwar stops and looks at him fixedly.
ANWAR
She's hurt, we had to take care of
her.
MOHAMMED
In town they're saying she was shot
by terrorists. Do you know what
they're going to do to us when they
find out she's here?
ANWAR
Don't be paranoid and go help find
the doctor.
Anwar pays no more attention to him and carries the basin
into the room.
75
Two old men walk through the streets.
77
The two men walk past the tourists and head inside without
knocking or asking for permission.
79
Richard and Anwar have walked out into the patio to wait for
them. The sheik approaches.
SHEIK
(In Arabic)
Allah be with you.
ANWAR
(In Arabic)
Allah be with you.
He turns to Richard and speaks to him in very bad French.
SHEIK
(In bad French)
I am Atallah the sheik and this is
Walid, the moukadem. I'm very sorry
about your wife.
RICHARD
I don't understand French.
ANWAR
He says he is very sorry about your
wife.
Richard thanks him with a nod.
SHEIK
(To Anwar, in Arabic)
Tell him that I want to ask him some
questions.
ANWAR
(To Richard)
Can he ask you some questions?
Richard nods.
The sheik continues in Arabic.
46.
SHEIK
(In Arabic)
Do you have any enemies in this
country?
ANWAR
He asks if you have any enemies in
this country.
Richard shakes his head.
RICHARD
Of course not.
SHEIK
(In Arabic)
Then why were you shot at?
ANWAR
Why did you come to Morocco?
RICHARD
Vacation.
ANWAR
(In Arabic)
He has no idea.
SHEIK
(In Arabic)
What does he do for a living?
ANWAR
What do you do for a living?
RICHARD
I'm a magazine editor.
ANWAR
(In Arabic)
He edits magazines.
SHEIK
(In Arabic)
Anti-muslim magazines?
ANWAR
Anti-muslim magazines?
RICHARD
No, magazine magazines.
ANWAR
(In Arabic)
No, normal magazines.
47.
RICHARD
Tell him we need to get my wife out
of here. Ask him if the ambulance is
on its way.
ANWAR
(In Arabic)
He wants to get his wife out of here.
He wants to know if the ambulance is
on its way.
SHEIK
(In Arabic)
Tell him the federal police are in
charge of this, that they are going
to send the ambulance.
ANWAR
He says the federal police are already
in charge, that they are going to
send the ambulance.
The sheik looks at the house.
SHEIK
(In Arabic)
Hey, did your cousin finally end up
getting married?
ANWAR
(In Arabic)
Yep, she's married, she doesn't live
here anymore.
Richard, anxious, questions Anwar.
RICHARD
What did he say?
ANWAR
He gives you his blessing.
RICHARD
Thank you.
The sheik and the moukadem turn and exit the house.
80
Chieko walks down crowded Tokyo streets.
She walks with a
lost gaze, unsettled.
83
Chieko arrives at an upper class apartment complex. The
architecture is cutting edge, but impersonal and cold.
84
Dawn. The desert is a rose plain softly lit by the sun's
first rays. Yussef and Ahmed are digging a hole with their
bare hands. Once they're finished, they clean up around the
hole and mark it with three stones.
89
Alarid (40), a federal cop, tall, in an impeccable uniform
with numerous rank badges, stands on the highway examining
the site of the shot with the old man who was driving.
52.
In the distance we can see a police checkpoint stopping some
cars and, after checking them, letting them go.
ALARID
(To the old man, the
entire dialogue in
Arabic)
Are you sure it was here?
OLD MAN
Sure. I drive down this road every
day. The American tried to stop me
right here.
He stands more or less where Richard tried to stop him.
OLD MAN (CONT'D)
I was scared. He was covered in
blood and I was coming from picking
up my grandson from his work.
ALARID
Where was the bus?
The old man points some twenty yards behind him.
OLD MAN
Over there.
Alarid walks toward where the old man said and looks out at
the mountains. Some of his men are visible at the tops.
Alarid talks to them by radio.
ALARID
Look further to the right.
We can see some men exploring the terrain.
ALARID (CONT'D)
(To the old man)
Why did you wait so long to contact
the police?
OLD MAN
I had to drive my grandson home.
The radio crackles.
POLICEMAN VOICE
Captain Alarid, Captain Alarid... We
found the cartridges.
90
Alarid squats, scrutinizing the four empty cartridges lying
on the earth. One of his men approaches and Alarid signals
with his hand for him to stop immediately.
53.
ALARID
Stop right there...
The man remains motionless. Alarid follows the prints that
lead away from the cartridges. He reaches the mess of goat
hoof-prints. He picks up a ball of shit and feels it.
ALARID (CONT'D)
They're from around here. Find out
who has a .270 caliber rifle.
91
Yussef and Ahmed walk back home, lost in their own thoughts.
Suddenly a jackal trots out and stares at them. Yussef picks
up a rock and throws it. The jackal runs off.
92
Hassan and his wife are listening to the radio and playing
cards at a table placed outside the house. As they play,
Hassan whittles a stake with a small knife.
Hassan's wife lowers her hand and Hassan follows.
HASSAN
I won...
His wife pushes two chips from her pile toward him. In the
distance, several trucks approach, kicking up a dust cloud.
Hassan's wife gets up to better see them.
WIFE
Are you expecting anyone?
Hassan stands up and watches the vehicles come closer.
HASSAN
No.
Five trucks pull up in a semicircle around the house. A
dozen police officers get out armed and aim at Hassan and
his wife.
Alarid gets out and stands next to his car door.
ALARID
Hassan Ibrahim?
Hassan paralyzed by fear, answers in a broken voice.
HASSAN
Yes.
One of the police officers approaches him aiming directly at
his head, while another one aims at his wife.
54.
POLICE OFFICER
Drop your weapon.
Hassan lifts up his knife and shows it to them.
HASSAN
It's not a weapon, it's my knife.
POLICE OFFICER
Drop it, now...
Hassan drops the knife in the dust.
POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)
Get down on the floor... face down...
Hassan and his wife look at each other before they obey.
HASSAN
What did we do?
The cop readies himself to fire, and Hassan drops to the
ground. His wife follows and also lies on her stomach.
93
Abdullah takes two goats out of the corral, ties a rope to
their neck and drags them over to a rock. The goats bleat
desperately trying to break free.
Abdullah turns to look at his children.
ABDULLAH
Hold them.
Yussef and Ahmed hold their legs.
Abdullah pulls out a knife
and slits the goat's throat.
94
Hassan lies on the floor, cuffed, with a broken mouth,
surrounded by cops. Alarid is carrying out the interrogation,
squatting next to Hassan's face.
ALARID
Why did you shoot at the bus?
HASSAN
I didn't shoot at anyone.
ALARID
Then who, you idiot?
Hassan remains silent and turns to look at his wife who is
sitting on a chair, cuffed, a few yards away.
55.
HASSAN
It wasn't me.
Alarid punches him in the face.
ALARID
That was your rifle.
HASSAN
No, not anymore, I sold it today.
ALARID
Oh yeah?
To who?
95
Abdullah gives Yussef and Ahmed some goat skins.
ABDULLAH
Take these goat skins to Naguib and
see if he wants to buy them.
The two brothers bundle up the skins, tie them up with some
cord and they leave down the path away from the house.
96
As they climb a hill, they encounter a convoy of Moroccan
police trucks. They are terrified. The vehicles screech to
a dramatic halt before them, lifting up much dust.
Alarid opens the passenger window.
ALARID
Hey, do you know where Abdullah Adboum
lives?
Ahmed and Yussef exchange a glance.
Yussef nods.
YUSSEF
Yes.
Ahmed gets very nervous.
Yussef points the wrong way with
an air of certainty.
YUSSEF (CONT'D)
Over there, you have to cross those
mountains.
ALARID
They told us he lived around here.
YUSSEF
No, we just live here with our mother.
Abdullah lives over there.
Alarid scrutinizes the brothers' faces.
56.
ALARID
If you're lying to me I'm going to
come back and cut your balls off.
Ahmed breathes nervously.
Yussef continues in cold blood.
YUSSEF
You can come back whenever you like.
Alarid smiles and gestures at the driver with his head that
they should go on. The police vehicles drive off in the
direction Yussef pointed them in.
97
Ahmed and Yussef run home. Their mother and sisters are
milking some goats into a tin bucket. When they fill, Abdullah
empties the milk out into a barrel.
AHMED
Papa... papa...
Abdullah puts the bucket down on the floor and turns to look
at his kids, who stop before him, panting, exhilarated.
ABDULLAH
What happened?
Ahmed can barely control his gasping.
AHMED
The police... they're looking for
you...
ABDULLAH
Me?
Why?
YUSSEF
No, they're not looking for you...
they're looking for us...
ABDULLAH
You?
Why?
YUSSEF
Because of what happened to the
tourist...
Yasira and her two daughters stop milking and approach.
Abdullah can't seem to understand what their talking about.
ABDULLAH
What tourist?
AHMED
The American... Yussef killed her...
57.
YUSSEF
That's not true, we both did.
YASIRA
What are you saying?
Ahmed fires his words out.
AHMED
Yussef started shooting at the cars
because Hassan said that the bullet
could go really far...
YUSSEF
That's a lie, you started shooting
at the cars.
AHMED
Yes, but you killed her.
Abdullah loses his patience and grabs Ahmed by the shoulders.
ABDULLAH
What the hell are you talking about?
Ahmed looks at his father straight in the eyes.
AHMED
Yussef killed the American and he
spies on Zora naked and Zora lets
him watch her...
Abdullah turns toward Zora.
In his mind, everything is
confusion.
ABDULLAH
What is your brother talking about?
ZORA
That's bullshit.
AHMED
It's not bullshit; she's a whore and
my brother spies on her...
As soon as the words leave Ahmed's mouth, Yussef decks him
and leaves him sprawled on the dust.
Ahmed shoots right back up and runs at Yussef kicking, until
they're both entangled in the fight and end up rolling on
the ground. Abdullah tries to get between them.
98
Debbie and Mike are almost like spectators at a soccer match
between the other kids, as they play in the dirt with an
orange plastic ball.
58.
Nobody passes to them.
Mike just runs from side to side
without saying a word.
Frustrated, Debbie just watches.
99
Luis is standing under a shack drinking beer with some
friends. Amelia, worried, approaches him.
AMELIA
(Both in Spanish)
Luis, the priest is here and Patricia
hasn't arrived. Where is she?
LUIS
No idea.
59.
AMELIA
Fifteen minutes left before the
wedding and you have no idea?
LUIS
What if she doesn't want to get
married? Shut up and come help me
look for her.
101
Santiago arrives at where the children are playing.
He calls
out to them.
SANTIAGO
(In Spanish)
Who wants to help me with the
chickens?
Everyone raises their hand and go toward him. Mike and Debbie
stand still without knowing what to do. Santiago calls them.
SANTIAGO (CONT'D)
Mike and Debbie. Come with me.
102
The chickens walk around a rustic chicken coop made with
wire mesh and mesquite posts. Santiago opens the door to
the coop and lets the kids in, Mike and Debbie among them.
Once inside, Santiago tells them to catch the chickens.
SANTIAGO
(In Spanish)
I'll give ten pesos to the first one
of you who catches a chicken.
The kids start chasing the chickens, which scamper as soon
as they feel hands trying to grab them.
At first, Mike and Debbie don't know what to do, but they
are soon amused and run to catch them. After a while, Debbie
catches one and holds it up.
Santiago applauds her.
SANTIAGO (CONT'D)
Debbie is the winner. Now we need
another five.
The kids get back to their game of catching chickens.
103
Santiago's car drives down the road, with a terrible sun
beating down on it.
60.
104
Santiago has several chickens tied up. One of the kids
catches the last one and hands it to Santiago.
SANTIAGO
(In Spanish)
Ready. Now who's going to help me?
Several children raise their hands. Mike and Debbie raise
theirs as well, excited. Santiago picks Mike.
SANTIAGO (CONT'D)
Let's see, Mike, you can help me.
Proud, Mike walks toward Santiago and stands next to him.
Santiago unties a chicken and gives it to Mike.
SANTIAGO (CONT'D)
Hold it tight, like this.
He shows him how to hold it. Mike grabs it and holds it
between his arms, smiling, oblivious to what will happen.
Santiago grabs the chicken by the head and pulls it off.
The chicken starts to shake, spurting blood everywhere.
Mike, stunned, lets the animal fall to the ground and the
chicken starts its mad race.
The Mexican kids start screaming excitedly, chasing the
headless chicken. Nobody notices that Debbie and Mike,
completely shocked, are about to cry.
106
They arrive at the bride's house. A car adorned with ribbons
is parked outside. There is no one to be seen.
61.
107
As Amelia gets out, Patricia's mother appears, upset.
AMELIA
What's the matter?
MOTHER
Patricia's not feeling well.
109
Santiago and the other kids are plucking the chicken's
feathers. Mike and Debbie stare, horrified.
SANTIAGO
(In Spanish)
Aren't you going to help?
Mike and Debbie shake their heads.
SANTIAGO (CONT'D)
Why?
MIKE
It's not good to kill animals.
Santiago smiles to himself.
SANTIAGO
(In English)
Have you ever been to Kentucky Fried
Chicken?
They both nod.
SANTIAGO (CONT'D)
What? Did you think that Colonel
Sanders kept them as pets?
He hands Mike a headless chicken, and he slowly starts to
pluck it.
110
A bearded man (50) on an old bicycle rides down the hamlet's
narrow streets. He is carrying a briefcase on the bike.
He is escorted by dozens of children.
112
The doctor walks across the patio, through the tumult of
children and before the scrutiny of two police officers.
114
Mohammed sits outside with three friends drinking coffee.
From where they are we see the bus and the American tourists.
A battery powered radio plays Moroccan music and commercials
in the background.
MOHAMMED
I don't understand why Anwar brought
them here.
FRIEND 1
Well he spends all his time with
them, what do you expect.
FRIEND 2
The woman is hurt, he had to help
her.
MOHAMMED
Yeah?
And when have they helped us?
FRIEND 1
I liked one of those tourists.
FRIEND 2
Really?
They're all skin and bones.
Suddenly Mohammed focuses on the radio.
MOHAMMED
Shh... sh... listen.
The friends are quiet.
NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
Today, near Tazarine, there was an
incident where an American was shot...
One of the friends interrupts.
FRIEND 3
Hey look, it's the story.
FRIEND 2
They said Tazarine, did you hear?
We were on the radio...
MOHAMMED
Shh, shut up.
67.
NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
Although authorities say it could
have been a foiled robbery, the
American government claims they are
certain it was a terrorist attack.
Minister Hassef Hazal has said that
in our country, terrorist cells have
been eradicated, that Morocco is a
peaceful country and that one act of
vulgar banditry followed by
superficial evaluations such as the
U.S. intends to place upon it cannot
ruin the image, the economy and the
pacifist reputation of our country.
American Ambassador Ken Jones,
however, insists that it was a
terrorist attack on American citizens,
that it merits a full investigation,
and that the guilty should be
punished. So far, the attack has not
been attributed to any known terrorist
organizations...
Mohammed shouts.
MOHAMMED
I fucking told Anwar, I told him he
was only going to get us in trouble...
he never comes and when he does he
always brings trouble...god damn
it...
FRIEND 1
Are the Americans going to invade
our country?
MOHAMMED
I don't know.
116
The bus is still parked outside Anwar's house. Some of the
passengers sit leaning against the wall, scrutinized by some
of the town's children and women who have offered them tea
and dates.
118
Tom resolutely walks up the stairs followed by James.
120
Tom, James and others are gathered by the door.
TOM
We're leaving.
RICHARD
You can't leave us like this.
TOM
There are old people here and the
heat is getting to them.
RICHARD
At least wait until an ambulance
comes.
TOM
One man almost fainted in the bus
and there's a woman who needs to get
back in time to take her medication.
Richard turns to Anwar.
RICHARD
Is there anyone around here who can
take them in?
TOM
It's not about that.
LILLY
Sir, we can't wait anymore.
Walter an English man, one of the older men,
defends him.
WALTER
We can't leave him here alone.
TOM
Well let him come, then.
71.
DOUGLAS
His wife is in no condition to ride
a bus.
TOM
And lots of other people aren't in
any condition to keep waiting, can't
you see?
RICHARD
Just wait, the ambulance should be
here any minute now.
TOM
We're giving you an hour... one
hour...
Richard breathes, relieved.
122
Chieko walks down the street with Mitsu. They are good-
looking and attract attention. They know this and look back
out of the corners of their eyes.
123
They arrive at a park with a playground: swings, see-saws,
slides. Several of their deaf-mute volleyball friends are
there.
With them are two young men with hair dyed blond. One of
them, Takeshi (18), has an earring, and the other, Haruki
(19), has several tattoos.
Mitsu and Chieko greet them in sign language.
Chieko asks
the slightly chubby Kumiko who they are.
KUMIKO
They're my cousins.
Chieko turns to look at them, curious. Haruki, the guy with
tattoos, exchanges a look with her. Chieko suddenly feels
intimidated and looks down.
CHIEKO
Is he deaf-mute like us?
KUMIKO
No, but he understands some.
Haruki seems to understand what they're saying and leans in
to whisper something to Takeshi, his brother. They both
laugh.
Haruki approaches Chieko and talks to her face to face so
she can read his lips.
72.
HARUKI
What's your name?
Chieko and her friend smile.
Chieko takes out her notebook
and pen and writes her name.
Haruki reads it out loud.
HARUKI (CONT'D)
Chieko?
Chieko nods.
HARUKI (CONT'D)
My name's Haruki.
Chieko nods, trying to show she's understood. Haruki takes
out a flask and holds it out to her. Chieko opens it and
smells it. Haruki stands in front of her.
HARUKI (CONT'D)
It's whisky.
Chieko smiles and gives a long swig.
Mitsu asks for some
and also gives it a long drink.
HARUKI (CONT'D)
Do the cops come around here?
MITSU
(Gutturally)
Sometimes.
Haruki takes out some ecstasy and gives it to them. Mitsu
and Chieko look at each other and down the pills with a gulp
of whisky.
124
Half-drunk and rushing from the pills, Chieko, her friends,
and Haruki and Takeshi, play on the swings and see-saw.
They laugh at almost anything. Haruki and Chieko are on the
see-saw and every time Chieko rises, Haruki looks at her
bush. Chieko knows this sometimes opens her legs even more
so he can look to his heart's content. Hormones float in
the air.
Mitsu also takes advantage of the occasion. She flirts with
Haruki whenever she can. Haruki looks happy to be the object
of their attention.
Takeshi, who has started to make out with one of Chieko's
friends, turns to the group and speaks slowly.
TAKESHI
Why- don't- we- go- to- Montana?
73.
125
The taxi parks outside the Montana. Chieko, Mitsu and Haruki
get out of the car and meet with the others at the door.
127
Yussef and Ahmed are sitting against the wall of the house.
Yussef's lip is split. Ahmed's nose is bleeding.
Abdullah paces desperately, while his wife and daughters
watch the scene, silent. Abdullah stops to look at Yussef.
ABDULLAH
Why did you do this?
They don't answer.
Abdullah leans over and slaps Ahmed.
ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
Answer me, god damn it!
Ahmed won't answer and he turns to Yussef again.
YUSSEF
We were testing the rifle.
Abdullah turns and gives Yussef a powerful slap, which he
endures with silent dignity.
ABDULLAH
Are you idiots? You killed a woman,
(He turns to Zora)
And you, you got naked so your brother
would see you?
AHMED
Yes, she got naked lots of times.
I
saw how Yussef spied on her.
75.
ZORA
That's not true.
Abdullah turns to Yussef.
ABDULLAH
Is it true or not?
Yussef is silent. Abdullah walks two steps forward and slaps
Zora. He looks furious, scared, indignant.
ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
Why did you do this to us?
He can barely hold in his tears. Zora brings her hand to
her face tearily. Abdullah turns to Ahmed.
ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
Where's the rifle?
130
A cop interrogates Hassan. His face is badly bruised and
his hands are cuffed behind his back.
COP
What organization gave you the weapon?
HASSAN
I've told you it wasn't an
organization; I got it from a hunter.
COP
What hunter?
HASSAN
A Japanese hunter gave it to me many
years ago. I've got a picture inside.
She can get it.
He turns to look at his wife. She has also been beaten and
is guarded by two cops. The interrogating cop authorizes
her. She walks in and comes out with a photograph of Hassan
with Yasujiro, posing with the scimitar-horned oryx. He hands
it over and the cop examines it.
HASSAN (CONT'D)
He's holding the rifle he gave me.
131
Yussef and Ahmed dig up the rifle and the bullets in front
of their parents and sisters.
Abdullah grabs the rifle, dusts it off and puts the bullets
in his bag. He turns to Yasira.
76.
ABDULLAH
We're going to hide out at Naguib's
house. If the cops come, tell them
we went south.
With the rifle in hand, Abdullah runs off, followed by Yussef
and Ahmed. The women watch them get lost on the horizon.
132
Alarid's truck parks in front of Hassan's house again. Hassan
is still cuffed and being interrogated. Furious, Alarid gets
out of the truck and goes toward him.
ALARID
This Abdullah doesn't live where you
said he did.
He walks over to kick him. The wife intervenes from where
she is, some ten yards away.
WIFE
They live where he said they do.
Alarid turns to her.
ALARID
You're going to take us.
With a gesture, he orders his subordinates to put her in the
truck. She obeys, docile.
ALARID (CONT'D)
And if they're not there, I'll cut
your tongue out and I'll kill your
husband.
133
The Moroccan police trucks drive down the dusty roads.
The
landscape is harsh and barren.
134
Alarid quickly gets out.
ALARID
There they are.
All the cops get out with their high powered rifles.
137
Abdullah and his sons run full speed.
Yussef sees the trucks
in the distance.
YUSSEF
The police, the police...
They run up a hill to try to lose them, but shots start to
ring out.
YUSSEF (CONT'D)
They're shooting at us.
Abdullah stands before his sons and lifts up the rifle as a
sign of surrender. The shots cease for a few seconds, but
they suddenly start again.
ABDULLAH
Get down.
Run.
The three shepherds run, huddling as low as they can. More
shots. They desperately climb between the rocks. Bullets
whiz past everywhere.
Abdullah makes one last attempt at surrender. He lifts up
the rifle again, sets it on the ground and backs away. But
the gesture is in vain, as the bullets still rush past.
They begin to run again when Ahmed is hit in one of his
calves. He collapses and rolls downhill. Abdullah hurries
to rescue him and drags him behind a rock.
Ahmed won't stop screaming from the pain.
AHMED
They shot me, they shot me...
78.
Yussef dives on his belly and snakes his way through the
rocks. He gets the rifle, loads it and aims at the trucks.
He shoots without hitting anything.
Abdullah turns to him.
ABDULLAH
Don't shoot, don't shoot!
Yussef doesn't pay attention.
He loads again and aims.
138
P.O.V. RIFLE SIGHTS -- DAY
Yussef aims carefully. He picks out one of the cops who has
been shooting barely protected by one of the trucks' fenders.
Yussef shoots and the policeman collapses.
139
The religious ceremony has ended and everyone throws rice at
the bride and groom. Debbie and Mike enjoy doing it.
Several cowboys, among them Santiago, have gone to their
trucks and are loudly honking their horns.
Music begins to blare.
140
The band plays various Norteo songs. Everyone waits for
the music to start. After a while a couple starts to timidly
dance. Then another, and another, until the dance floor
becomes a sway of heads moving to the same rhythm.
Amelia dances with Mike and Debbie with Santiago; both Amelia
and Santiago show them a few steps.
SANTIAGO
(To Debbie, in Spanish)
Like this, look...
He kicks his heel back, then forward. Debbie watches,
entertained. Jacinto (55), overweight and with a good-natured
face, moves closer to Amelia and watches her dance for a
while, she notices and stops, embarrassed.
JACINTO
(Both in Spanish)
Amelia, will you let me dance with
you?
Amelia remains unperturbed, without answering him.
JACINTO (CONT'D)
I've been asking you for a dance for
30 years. Does it really cost you
that much?
79.
Amelia stares at him.
AMELIA
I don't think your wife would have
liked that.
JACINTO
C'mon Amelia, she's been dead for 10
years.
Amelia looks around and then turns to him.
AMELIA
Okay, just one.
Jacinto chivalrously takes her by the waist and they begin
to dance. Santiago watches them, amused, and continues to
dance with Mike and Debbie.
Jacinto draws Amelia closer and they kiss gently.
141
Beer starts to flow and some of the guests get overbearing.
There is a small scuffle at the edge of the dance floor, but
order is soon restored.
The guitarist in the band stops the music.
GUITAR PLAYER
(All in Spanish)
Now, Luis and Patricia, come forward.
Everyone makes way for the bride and groom.
GUITAR PLAYER (CONT'D)
We-want-cake, we-want-cake...
The audience and the band sing the little cake song. A giant,
tacky wedding cake, covered in cream, arrives. The bride
grabs the knife and gets ready to cut it.
GUITAR PLAYER (CONT'D)
Take- a- bite, take- a- bite...
The bride gives into the ritual. She tries to take a bite
out of the cake without using her hands and someone pushes
her face into the cream. Debbie and Mike laugh.
A cowboy pulls out a gun and, festively, fires.
Debbie is
frightened and goes to hide behind Amelia.
AMELIA
Don't worry, it's ok.
The man puts the gun away and walks back onto the dance floor
as if nothing had happened.
80.
Luis asks the band to stop the music for a little bit and he
takes the microphone.
LUIS
Good evening everyone... Hey... I
want to say something. Love came
today, it came here all pretty...
(he taps his heart)
It's kind of like a little mouse is
crawling inside of me. Because that's
what love is, it's like your insides
get all twisted into knots... and
that, baby, is what you've taught
me. And because you've shown me, I
want to tell everyone that hopefully
love will get inside them
too...because it feels so good,
really...Thanks a lot and keep havin'
a good time...
Everybody applauds and Luis steps down from the dais, proud
of his speech. He goes to Amelia and gives her a very long
and loving hug.
142
Night has fallen. The music plays full blast. Everyone
dances, people start to make out, the drunk collapse.
Patricia breathes regularly with her hands on her belly.
Luis drinks beer beside her while he watches the guests dance.
Debbie falls asleep on Amelia's lap while Mike watches the
party, overwhelmed.
MIKE
When are my parents getting back?
The question catches Amelia off guard.
AMELIA
Pronto...muy pronto...
MIKE
They told me they were coming back
today.
AMELIA
Se quedaron ms rato.
The answer seem to makes Mike anxious.
MIKE
My dad's coming back with my mom.
AMELIA
Yes. Yes he is.
81.
MIKE
I don't want him to leave again.
AMELIA
He won't.
He starts crying.
MIKE
I miss Pat.
Amelia embraces him and kisses his head.
AMELIA
Yo tambin hijito, yo tambin.
The boy, tired and sleepy, leans his head on Amelia.
143
Santiago, a little bit drunk, and Amelia, carrying Debbie
who has passed out, say goodbye to Luis and Patricia. Sleepy,
Mike leans on the hood of the car.
LUIS
(All in Spanish)
Stay the night.
AMELIA
I can't. I have to take these kids
home and it's almost dawn.
LUIS
But Santiago's pretty drunk.
SANTIAGO
Drunk my ass. I'm fine. I'll go
and come back in an hour.
PATRICIA
Stay for another while, the party's
just getting started.
AMELIA
I wish, but these kids have to go to
school.
Santiago opens the door for Amelia, who carefully sets Debbie
on the back seat. Mike gets in and as soon as he does he
nestles in to go to sleep.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
See you soon, son.
Luis and Amelia hug each other.
Then Amelia hugs her daughter-
in-law.
82.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Congratulations, dear.
(She points at her
belly)
Take care of my grandson 'cause I'm
dying to be a grandmother.
She gives her a kiss and gets in the car.
Luis turns to
Santiago.
LUIS
You sure you're not too drunk?
SANTIAGO
Drunk my ass. I'm fine.
I'll be
back soon.
Santiago stumbles to the driver's side and opens the door.
144
The night spreads over the highway that cuts across the
desert. Santiago's car drives along, illuminating the cacti.
145
Santiago decides to cross through Mesa de Otay. Since it's
nighttime, there are very few cars. They drive across the
bridge and stop before the immigration officer.
147
The officer walks up to the window.
OFFICER
Your papers...
Santiago and Amelia take out their passports and their Green
cards. The officer compares the documents to their faces
again and again.
OFFICER (CONT'D)
Where you comin' from?
83.
SANTIAGO
(In bad English)
From a wedding.
The officer looks through the window and sees Debbie and
Mike sleeping in the back.
OFFICER
Who are they?
Santiago rushes to answer.
SANTIAGO
They're her nephews.
Amelia freezes at Santiago's answer.
The officer won't stop
looking at the children.
OFFICER
They don't look like you.
AMELIA
(bewildered)
I'm in charge of them.
OFFICER
Do you have their passports?
Amelia takes out their American passports and shows them to
the cop. He looks them over very carefully. Santiago starts
to get nervous.
SANTIAGO
Is there a problem?
The officer turns to look at them suspiciously.
He obviously
smells the alcohol.
OFFICER
Should there be one?
Santiago shakes his head.
Debbie wakes up and looks at the
officer sleepily.
DEBBIE
Hi.
OFFICER
Hey there, sweetie.
Debbie rubs her eyes.
OFFICER (CONT'D)
Tell me, is this lady your aunty?
Debbie innocently shakes her head.
84.
DEBBIE
No, she's not my aunty.
The officer stares at them harshly. He says something
incomprehensible over his radio and asks Santiago.
OFFICER
Are you drunk?
SANTIAGO
Me, sir?
No.
OFFICER
Get out of the car.
SANTIAGO
Why, officer?
OFFICER
I'm countin' to three...
He brings his hand to his gun.
148
The immigration officers take out their guns and run to stop
him. Santiago sees that the road ahead is clear and he drives
away full speed, barely swerving around some customs officers
who are searching another vehicle.
The officer shouts urgently.
OFFICER
They've kidnapped some kids...
He starts a police chase.
150
Santiago's car drives full speed down the highway.
He
sometimes looks as if he is going to lose control.
151
The car drives quickly down the path, raising up a cloud of
dust. The patrol cars are no longer visible.
The car drives on for a mile and then stops.
153
Amelia gets out and opens the door for the kids.
AMELIA
(In English)
Come with me, dears.
The kids get out and Amelia holds their hand.
Santiago closes
the doors and drives off in a cloud of dust.
They start to walk through the darkness. Amelia leads the
way, avoiding cacti and thorny branches. The go on like
this for a long stretch. The children are quiet and scared.
Amelia goes toward the highway and realizes the patrol cars
have turned into the path. She runs into the desert with
the kids. She can barely see with the light of the early
dawn. The three frequently trip on thorny plants.
DEBBIE
I want to go home now.
MIKE
Me too.
Both of them, scared, start to cry.
AMELIA
(In English)
Don't cry. We're going home now.
She looks back worried at where the patrol cars were; they
are approaching quickly. Then she turns to where Santiago
ran. The headlights are soon lost on the horizon.
Amelia holds them by the hand and pulls them as she runs.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
(In Spanish)
Let's go.
87.
She leads them further and further away from the path, snaking
through the brush. The patrol cars come even closer. Amelia
ducks and hides behind one of the bushes.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Get down.
The children hide with her. The patrol cars tear past her,
some five hundred yards away, chasing after Santiago.
We suddenly hear sirens. Then, the sound of doors slamming
and unintelligible voices over a loudspeaker.
POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
Do not get out of the car...don't
get out...wait...stop...stop...don't
run...
After a few seconds, we hear distant gunshots, three, four.
Amelia listens, frozen.
155
An old, run-down Peugeot driven by a policeman pulls up in
front of the house. The policeman gets out. The tourists,
leaning on the wall, get up to see what's happening.
Mohammed comes out to talk to him.
89.
MOHAMMED
(in Arabic)
What happened?
POLICEMAN
(In Arabic)
I need to talk to the American.
Tom interrogates Mohammed.
TOM
What did he say?
MOHAMMED
No English...
158
The policeman, Anwar and Richard are chatting in the patio.
RICHARD
(To Anwar)
When did he find out?
ANWAR
(In Arabic)
When did you know?
POLICEMAN
(In Arabic)
A while ago... they said the ambulance
isn't coming anymore.
ANWAR
A while ago... he says the ambulance
broke down.
RICHARD
What? Tell him to call another one.
He has to get another one.
ANWAR
(In Arabic, to the
Policeman)
He wants you to call another
ambulance.
POLICEMAN
(In Arabic)
You know there isn't another one.
ANWAR
(To Richard)
There isn't another ambulance.
90.
RICHARD
What the hell do you mean there isn't
another ambulance? You've got to get
her out of here...
He faces the police officer.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
She can't stay here or she'll die.
Call another fucking ambulance...
The policeman cannot understand and remains expressionless.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
Come on, move... call another
ambulance...
ANWAR
(In Arabic)
He asks how we're going to get the
woman out of here.
POLICEMAN
(In Arabic)
Tell him that they told me that his
embassy is going to deal with it.
ANWAR
He says your embassy will deal with
the matter.
Richard now shouts at Anwar.
RICHARD
How the fuck are they going to deal
with it? It's your shitty fucking
country's responsibility.
POLICEMAN
(In Arabic)
The Americans want to send one of
their helicopters but I think there
are some problems.
Anwar mulls over his answer.
He seems to want to lie again.
ANWAR
They're going to try to send a
helicopter.
RICHARD
(incredulous)
A helicopter?... Let's get out of
here...
He starts walking. Anwar catches up to him.
91.
ANWAR
Where?
Richard turns to him, desperate.
RICHARD
I need to make a phone call.
They turn towards the exit leaving the cop behind, who doesn't
seem to understand. Tom and James take advantage of the
situation to go talk to Richard.
TOM
We can't stay here any longer. It's
going to get dark soon. Lots of
people aren't feeling well and its
dangerous to stay here.
Richard explodes and pushes Tom.
RICHARD
Stop fucking with me.
TOM
Don't you dare push me.
RICHARD
Oh no?
He pushes him again, angrily.
TOM
What are you doing, you stupid fuck?
RICHARD
Leave asshole.
Tom shoves him.
TOM
Fuck you.
Richard becomes furious and loses it, hitting him over and
over again. Some of the tourists get involved. James manages
to grab him with Anwar.
JAMES
Hey, take it easy.
RICHARD
I'm fed up with that asshole.
James pulls him away while other tourists pull Tom away.
JAMES
Try to calm down.
92.
RICHARD
Calm down? My wife is dying up there.
JAMES
Come with us.
RICHARD
Where the fuck do you want me to
take her?
JAMES
Try to understand, many of them can't
go on. Tell me, honestly, is there
any point in us staying?
Richard threatens him.
RICHARD
You leave and I'll kill you...
James is going to say something, but Richard turns around
and walks away as he is about to say something. Anwar follows.
159
Richard runs after the bus as it drives away down the side
streets.
RICHARD
Stop... Stop... Stop you mother-
fuckers stop...
The bus vanishes into the distance. Richard picks up a stone
and hurls it impotently.
161
She opens the door to the balcony and points at the void:
it's over twelve floors. Kenji looks over; the distance is
dizzying. Chieko writes in her notebook and shows him the
piece of paper.
KENJI
You saw her jump?
She nods and writes again.
She looks perturbed.
KENJI (CONT'D)
You've already told the other
officers?
She nods again.
Kenji holds her by her arms.
KENJI (CONT'D)
I don't know what you're talking
about.
Chieko remains motionless for a few seconds. She scrawls in
her notebook "Then why do you want to talk to my father?"
Kenji reads and then turns to her.
KENJI (CONT'D)
It's about a hunting rifle in his
name.
The red bulb on the gadget starts to blink. Chieko spots it
from the balcony and signals to Kenji that she has to go to
the kitchen. She runs off.
164
Abdullah, afraid, watches his son shoot. The police have
stopped firing and run for cover. Yussef loads the rifle
again and aims carefully. He shoots and, in the distance,
we can see one of the headlights on a police truck shatter.
Abdullah shouts at Yussef desperately.
ABDULLAH
Yussef, stop shooting!
Furious, Yussef loads the rifle again and starts shooting at
the cops. Ahmed won't stop screaming from the pain. Confused,
Abdullah doesn't know if he should console his wounded son
or stop the enraged Yussef.
In the distance, the cops reorganize.
We hear the faraway
shots of Alarid giving orders.
ALARID
Move that truck... god damn it...
One of the cops gets onto a truck and uses it as a parapet.
Yussef aims again, but this time the policemen are well
covered. Abdullah drags himself all the way to Yussef.
98.
ABDULLAH
Give me that rifle...
Yussef turns to his father.
YUSSEF
They're going to kill us.
ABDULLAH
Give me that rifle.
He tries to wrest it away, but Yussef resists. The struggle
and Abdullah finally pulls it away. When Yussef tries to
snatch it back, the police fire a round of shots and the two
barely have time to hide.
The air is thick with gunshots. Yussef and Abdullah,
terrified, stick to the stones. The bullets strike very
close to them, and they can't even raise their heads.
Ahmed won't stop complaining.
Abdullah shouts at him.
ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
Ahmed, don't move.
The gunshots rain down for over a minute. When they stop,
Abdullah turns to look at Ahmed, who is lying motionless on
the rocks with bullet in his back.
ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
Ahmed!
Ahmed!
Oblivious of the police, he gets up and runs toward him.
Motionless, Ahmed just moans. With every breath, his shirt
grows bloodier.
ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
Ahmed!
Ahmed!
He rolls Ahmed over and lays his head on his lap. Abdullah
cannot stop crying. Yussef, ducking, runs toward his brother.
Abdullah laments nervously.
ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
Don't die, don't die.
Yussef is shocked upon seeing his dead brother. He stands
up and, without caring whether anyone fires at him or not,
he raises the rifle up in the air for the police to see that
he is not aiming, and starts to break it against the rocks.
When he's finished breaking it he opens his arms and walks
toward the police. One of them policemen looks at him through
a pair of binoculars. Alarid interrogates him.
ALARID
What's happening?
99.
POLICE OFFICER
A boy is walking this way.
ALARID
Is he armed?
The officer takes a careful look.
POLICE OFFICER
It doesn't look like it.
ALARID
What are the others doing?
The officer watches Abdullah carrying his wounded son.
POLICE OFFICER
A man is holding somebody injured.
ALARID
Is the other one still walking this
way?
POLICE OFFICER
Yes.
Alarid turns to the other officers.
ALARID
Aim.
The police aim and hold Yussef in their sights. He keeps
walking resolutely toward his aggressors. He is crying
softly, keeping his arms open.
Yussef walks until his is 10 meters away from the police and
he kneels with his arms open.
YUSSEF
I killed the American, I was the
only one who shot at you...
Cautious, the police still aim at his chest. Yussef proceeds
with his confession, babbling it through his nerves, his
pain and his attempt to control his sobbing.
YUSSEF (CONT'D)
They did nothing... nothing...
He turns to his father and his brother and points at them.
YUSSEF (CONT'D)
Kill me, but save my brother, he did
nothing... nothing...
Alarid moves in, aiming at him with a rifle.
Behind him are
five other cops, also ready to shoot.
100.
ALARID
On the ground...
Yussef does not obey.
YUSSEF
Save my brother...
ALARID
On the ground...
Yussef turns his face toward Alarid looks him in the eye.
YUSSEF
Save my brother... please...
He lies on the floor, crying. Alarid puts his gun down and
looks at him: his enemy is a disconsolate child. Then he
looks up at Abdullah who is screaming his lamentations. He
turns to one of his subordinates.
ALARID
Go help them.
One of the officers goes to help Abdullah and Ahmed.
Yussef
lies on the floor, crying.
166
The sun rises.
Amelia and the children keep walking.
They
sweat.
MIKE
I can't walk anymore.
AMELIA
We have to keep walking.
MIKE
Why is the air so hot?
Amelia stops and tries to distract them.
AMELIA
(the entire dialogue
in English)
Because coyotes and snakes and quails
have already breathed that air.
Mike remains pensive.
MIKE
We're breathing the same air animals
breathe?
AMELIA
Yes.
101.
MIKE
And it doesn't rot?
AMELIA
No, it doesn't rot.
We all breathe
this air.
167
Dawn. The three walk through the desert.
Debbie walks
mechanically, tired and exhausted.
DEBBIE
I can't anymore. I'm thirsty.
MIKE
So am I.
Amelia looks around her: no sign of civilization.
AMELIA
(In Spanish)
Just a little further and we'll go
look for water.
168
Amelia lumbers heavily, carrying Debbie asleep on her arm.
Mike drags his feet a few yards behind.
They walk for a long stretch through the thorny brush until
they reach a small mound where a leafy mesquite grows.
Amelia lays a limp Debbie down on the ground and sits on the
mound of earth.
AMELIA
(In Spanish)
We're going to rest here for a while.
MIKE
What if there are snakes?
AMELIA
No, there aren't any.
Come, lie
down.
The boy, exhausted and docile, obeys and lies on her chest.
Amelia leans against the trunk with Debbie on her legs. The
children sleep while Amelia, nodding off, tries to keep watch.
169
It is well into the morning. Amelia and the children sleep
deeply. There is a noise and Amelia opens her eyes. She
sees a border patrol truck driving around near them.
102.
Looking through the branches, she spies on the truck and
watches another one join it. Mike awakes and sits up.
MIKE
What happening?
Amelia ducks and lays Mike face down.
The two trucks slowly
approach.
AMELIA
(To Mike, in a low
voice, in Spanish)
Stay still.
A truck drives by about eighty yards away and then passes.
The other one cuts diagonally across its path and then gets
lost in the desert.
Amelia gets up and shakes off the dust. She looks out of
place, wearing her best clothes torn by the bramble. She
makes sure the trucks are leaving.
MIKE
Why are we hiding if we didn't do
anything wrong?
AMELIA
(In English)
Because they think we did something
wrong.
MIKE
That's not true: you're bad.
Amelia freezes upon hearing the boy's words.
AMELIA
No, sweetie, I'm not bad.
I just
did something stupid.
She pulls him toward her and hugs him tenderly.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
(In Spanish)
I love you very much, sweetie.
Amelia turns and tries to wake Debbie.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
(In English)
Debbie, we've got to go.
The girl opens her eyes, but doesn't answer.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Debbie, sweetheart, wake up.
103.
She closes her eyes again. Amelia notices her lips are dry
and her breath is irregular: she is visibly dehydrated.
Upon seeing that she doesn't react, Amelia looks for the
trucks: they're far away.
170
Amelia carries Debbie in her arms under the burning sun,
following a cattle trail. Mike walk behind, pale, sweaty.
Amelia looks to the horizon: there is no sign of the trucks.
171
They are still walking. Amelia can barely go on. She stops
to rest. She is sweating copiously. Mike also looks weak.
172
The heat is strong and Amelia is beaten. She looks for the
shade of a cluster of mesquites and lays Debbie down. Then
she turns to Mike.
AMELIA
Sweetie, I'm going to go look for
help. Stay here and don't move.
MIKE
I'm not staying here alone.
AMELIA
Honey, you have to take care of
Debbie.
MIKE
I'm going with you.
Mike looks at her with imploring eyes.
Amelia caresses him.
AMELIA
I won't be long. I promise.
173
Amelia desperately looks through the desert.
She also looks
dehydrated. She drifts.
174
Amelia drags her feet as she walks.
She can go no further.
175
Amelia sees a small hillock and climbs it with difficulty.
She surveys the environs from the top. In the distance she
sees a Border Patrol truck driving down a path.
104.
With great effort, Amelia runs down the hill.
AMELIA
(In Spanish)
Stop, stop...
The truck doesn't stop. Amelia keeps running, flailing her
arms and screaming wildly.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Sir... sir... stop...
The truck stops and backs up.
Amelia keeps going, tripping
over stones.
John (29), a thoroughly Mexican officer, gets out and she
runs up, panting, to him.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Please help me.
John stares at her suspiciously.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
I have to go get two kids I left
behind in the desert.
John looks at her suspiciously.
JOHN
(In Spanish, with a
terrible accent)
Are they illegal immigrants?
AMELIA
No, they're American.
JOHN
When did you cross?
AMELIA
(In English)
I didn't cross, I live here.
Please,
help me find these kids.
John keeps staring at her.
He points to a mesquite.
JOHN
Stand there and don't move.
Amelia obeys. John goes back to the vehicle, opens the door
and sits down and grabs the radio.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Attention base, I have a 4533...I
have the suspect.
105.
Amelia doesn't manage to hear what the radio says. She looks
attentively at what the agent is doing. John stops and runs
back to her.
JOHN (CONT'D)
You're under arrest. Turn around
and put your hands behind your head.
Amelia despairs.
AMELIA
I left those kids in the desert, I
swear.
John pushes her forcefully against the truck.
JOHN
Turn around, now.
She turns around with her hands over her head.
John handcuffs
her and leads her to the vehicle.
176
The truck parks and they both get out.
JOHN
Where are they?
Amelia explores the landscape, anguished.
AMELIA
They must be around here.
Another border patrol truck arrives and pulls up next to
them. Eliseo (34), looks out the window.
ELISEO
What happened?
JOHN
This lady said they were here, but
there's nobody.
106.
ELISEO
(In Spanish)
Ma'am, you're not lying to us, are
you?
AMELIA
(In Spanish)
I swear they're around here somewhere.
She sees another cluster of mesquites and points toward them.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
They must be over that way.
178
They arrive at the cluster. The two trucks park and the
three get out. She is still cuffed. A helicopter hovers
above them.
They walk around: nothing.
JOHN
There's nobody here.
AMELIA
(To Eliseo, in Spanish)
I left them about a kilometer in
from the road.
ELISEO
(In Spanish)
Which road?
She doesn't know what to say.
John grabs her by the arm and
drags her toward the vehicle.
JOHN
I don't believe you.
Amelia looks at him desperately.
AMELIA
(In English)
I swear they're around here.
John is not affected.
He keeps pulling her.
ELISEO
(In English)
John, wait, maybe she's telling the
truth.
JOHN
Maybe she's not, let's go.
107.
AMELIA
Please sir, believe me.
John pays no attention.
She turns to Eliseo.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
(In Spanish)
I swear, they're lost, they're going
to die. I have to find them.
John keeps pulling her. He puts her in the truck and closes
the door before Eliseo's passive gaze.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
(In English)
Please no... please...
179
He walks out onto the stairs and calls Anwar.
RICHARD
Anwar...Anwar...
Anwar runs into the room.
ANWAR
What happened?
RICHARD
We've got to get her out of here.
Where's the clinic?
ANWAR
In Alnif, an hour and a half away
from here.
110.
RICHARD
Can you get us a car we can take her
in?
Anwar remains pensive for a moment and then nods.
181
Richard and the vet carry Susan out on a wheelbarrow. It is
very difficult to move her. She is clearly in pain and groans
quietly.
Outside the house is the policeman with his Peugeot. Anwar
is talking to him.
Richard and the vet carry Susan all the way to the car.
Richard stands before the policeman he humiliated earlier.
RICHARD
Thank you for lending us the car.
Anwar translates.
ANWAR
(In Arabic)
He thanks you for lending us the
car.
The policeman nods kindly.
Dozens of girls and boys and a few adults stare at the scene.
Gingerly, Richard, Anwar and the vet lift her into the car
and softly lay her on the back seat.
111.
Even so, she screams in pain.
SUSAN
Ahhh... Ahhh...
Richard holds her hand and squeezes it.
RICHARD
Sweetie, you've got to hold on.
Richard gets into the car, and as they're about to drive
off, the shopkeeper runs up to them.
TENDERO
(In Arabic)
Stop... Stop...
The shopkeeper catches up to them.
TENDERO (CONT'D)
(In Arabic)
They're calling from the American
Embassy.
183
A bus parks in front of the border. Several border patrol
agents have formed a wall for the illegal immigrants to pass
directly through.
The illegal immigrants get out and walk toward Mexico.
As
Amelia crosses, she keeps looking back.
186
The illegal immigrants cross into Mexico, where they disband
into small groups. Amelia walks alone. Before she walks
away she turns to one of the other deported Mexicans.
AMELIA
(In Spanish)
Do you have a cigarette?
He acquiesces. He rummages through his pant pockets and
pulls out a pack of cigarettes. He offers one to Amelia, who
takes it. He also pulls out some matches and lights one.
115.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Thank you.
187
Amelia smokes, drifting. After a while she sits on a sidewalk
and leans on a post. She looks into the street at the people
passing by and starts crying softly.
A dusty and battered pick up truck arrives. Inside are her
son and her comadre. Her son steps down and hugs her in
silence as she cries. Her comadre observes them from a
distance.
188
The truck is parked in front of Anwar's house. Richard and
Susan wait in the back while the boy, Anwar and the vet lean
on the hood.
Suddenly a helicopter with American insignia flies over them
and goes to land in an empty lot.
Anwar looks up and watches the helicopter descend. The
helicopter kicks up a cloud of dust before the stunned gaze
of dozens of children. Some camels are frightened. Some
starving dogs bark at it.
189
They carry Susan to the helicopter in a stretcher. They
load her in carefully. Richard follows her through the wind
generated by the helicopter. Anwar catches up to them to say
goodbye.
ANWAR
Good luck, mister...
RICHARD
Thank you for everything.
Richard gives Anwar a hug which he responds to affectionately.
Richard takes out his wallet and holds out three hundred-
dollar bills, which Anwar rejects.
ANWAR
No sir, no... Allah be with you.
They look each other in the eye and then Richard gets into
the chopper. It takes off.
190
The helicopter silently flies over the Moroccan desert.
116.
191
The hospital's perimeter is guarded by dozens of soldiers.
The security is impressive. A group of doctors and nurses
with a stretcher wait in the parking lot. Several journalists
and cameras observe.
Ken and his entourage await the helicopter's landing. The
helicopter approaches. The cameramen hurry to position
themselves for a better shot.
A reporter speaks to the camera.
REPORTER
In this helicopter is Susan Jones,
an American mother of two who was
seriously injured in a terrorist
attack. It appears fundamentalist
organizations planned the attack...
The helicopter settles softly in the parking lot. It is
immediately surrounded by several Moroccan soldiers. The
doctors on the ground prepare the stretcher.
Ken walks hurriedly toward the chopper, guarding himself
from the wind.
Susan is immediately placed on the stretcher and quickly
taken to the emergency room. Richard follows close behind
until his is intercepted by Ken.
KEN
Mr. Jones, I'm Ken Clifford,
Ambassador to the United States.
Richard keeps running behind the stretcher.
Ken stops him.
KEN (CONT'D)
A first rate medical team is going
to tend to her, but if you want we
can take her to a hospital in Italy
as soon as she's stable...
RICHARD
Thank you...
KEN
There are lots of reporters waiting.
Is there anything you want to say to
the press? A statement against
terrorism?
Richard looks at him as if he doesn't know what he's talking
about.
117.
RICHARD
The last thing I'm worried about
right now is the fucking press.
He pulls away from Ken and follows Susan toward the E.R.
192
Kenji walks down the streets immersed in his thoughts.
199
From the balcony, naked, Chieko observes the city stretching
before her.
Yasujiro walks in and encounters his daughter completely
naked. There are still traces of Chieko's tears in her eyes.
Yasujiro is affected when he sees his daughter like this,
but says nothing. He slowly walks toward her. Chieko looks
hurt, but whole.
Yasujiro stands beside her. They look at each other. Chieko
holds out her hand and takes his. Chieko squeezes. She looks
at the city and then looks at her father's eyes.
He strokes her hair and they both stand on the balcony, with
the massive city sprawling under them.
