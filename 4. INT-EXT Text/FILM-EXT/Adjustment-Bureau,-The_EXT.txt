The crowd, many of them in their twenties, roars with
approval as David walks out to the lectern on the steps of
the Admin Building.
DAVID
Hi there. I'm David Norris. And
I'm running for the US Senate.
2/12/09 2.
The crowd goes wild.
MONTAGE -- SENATE CAMPAIGN
--David finishes a speech at the FDNY Academy's graduation.
The cadets jump to their feet and give him a standing
ovation.
--David shakes the hands of workers entering a .Con Edison
plant in Buffalo. He's a natural at this. Unlike most
politicians he actually seems to enjoy campaigning.
--Flashbulbs go off as he plays a game of pick-up basketball
with a group of Bronx teenagers. Charlie is nearby.
--David takes a ceremonial shovel full of dirt to begin
redevelopment of an old military base upstate.
--He gives a speech at a Harlem church. Audiences watch
David the way they watched JFK, the way they watch Obama
today. He inspires, makes them believe, makes them want to
follow him. Especially young people.
--David walks through a suburban mall happily shaking hands
as cameras follow him and citizens snap pictures with their
camera-phones. People crush around him. He:doesn't seem to
mind at all. He welcomes it. He feeds off it.
--He pops a cherry lozenge in his mouth and climbs up onto a
tractor to speak to a gathering of upstate farmers, speaking
into a bullhorn to compensate for his hoarse voice. Charlie
stands nearby watching him speak:.
A light snow falls. Four MEN IN CONSERVATIVE SUITS,
overcoats, and fedoras walk across the roof of a forty-story
building. Their clothing is more timeless than old-
fashioned. And somehow so is their demeanor.
The men get to the edge and look down over the city, almost-
as if it's their domain.
2/12/09 5.
The four men in dark suits.. The boss's name is RICHARDSON,
early 40s. His top aide is.AHARRY, 50s.
RICHARDSON
This is a.bignight, gentleman.
(TOHARRY)
Is ever ything set?
Harry nods. Richardson notices his eyes:
RICHARDSON
You look tired. You should take a
vacation when we finish with this.
You'll have earned it.
HARRY
I'm not sure the kind of tired I
feel would be fixed by a vacation.
2/12/09 7.
RICHARDSON
Sure it would. Everybody needs a
vacation. Even us.
CUT TO:
The sky is just beginning to turn from black to deep blue.
The park is still and silent.
A black Mercedes pulls up on Madison Ave. Mr. Richardson,
again in a dark suit, gets out and enters the park.
2/12/09 14.
Harry sits on one of the benches -- a fedora in his lap to
complement a gray flannel suit. Richardson arrives.
RICHARDSON
He spills his coffee when he steps
out of Starbucks. The moment he
comes through the door.
HARRY
Got it.
RICHARDSON
Our models indicate between 7:00
and 7:05 am.
Harry nods but he seems distant Richardson sees this.
RICHARD SON
You planned that vacation, right?
HARRY
Two weeks.
Richardson claps him din-the shoulder and leaves. Harry
watches him go.
Through the window we see David getting his morning coffee.
He exits and LEAVES FRAME. HOLD on the door of Starbucks.
Harry is snoring on his bench. David walks past.
David arrives at Fifth just in time to catch the "M1 Limited-
Stop" bus arriving`at the stop.
Sunlightpeeks:.through a gap in the buildings and falls on
Harry's left eye, waking him. He bolts upright. Checks his
watch, Shit! He looks around quickly. Spots David about to
get o n the bus. Harry leaps : up--
INT MORNING
.As David pays, he notices Harry sprinting for the bus.
DAVID
Sir, there's someone--
BUS DRIVER
There's another M1 right behind me.
The bus pulls out. Harry keeps running after it.
2/12/09 17.
HARRY
No...
Harry runs down Broadway looking east on 19th to try to spot
the bus on Park.
Harry spots the bus passing on Park. He jams his fedora on
his head and stretches his arm out--
HARRY
Now.
Harry's face.
HARRY
Shit!
He's looking at a leather portfolio. We catch a glimpse
inside: a complicated circuit diagram. Harry shuts the
book, look's up to get a bead on" the the bus, then takes off down
Broadway, again, hoping to cut it off at Union Square.
Elise exits.. the bus. David stands at the bus door watching
her. She turns back to look at him.
DAVID
The morning after .I lost I woke up
thinking about you .
That melts her. Instantly. All her bravado drops.
Harry runs through Union Square bee-lining for David's bus.
2/12/09 23.
Spotting David through the bus window, Harry thrusts his
Fedora back onto his head and points at the bus--
HARRY
Dammit!
Harry sprints out onto lark Avenue now, right behind the bus--
HONK! Harry turns just in time to see a.taxi skid into him.
TRUNK! He rolls up onto the hood--
A dazed Harry lies in the road... The taxi driver who hit
him jumps out of his car to see if Harry is okay...
2/12/09 24.
Harry sits up... He's bruised but okay. He looks around for
something. Spots his crushed hat under the taxi's front
tire.
The taxi driver is with Harry now.
TAXI DRIVER
Are you okay?
Harry is sitting now, wincing, but still searching intently
for something.
HARRY
I'm fine-- Will you hand me that?
Harry points at his leather portfolio on the pavement a few
feet away. We'll come to know it as a "PLANBOOK."
2/12/09 25.
TAXI DRIVER (CONT'D)
Are you sure you're okay?
The driver hands it to him. Harry flips to a bookmarked
page and we get our first good look at that circuit diagram:
Thousands of interconnected lines. Dozens of geometric
symbols at intersection points. And written notations in a
language as complex as Sanskrit crossed with Chinese.
And, maybe it's just a trick of the light but several of the
lines appear to re-arrange themselves on the page.
HARRY
Oh...shit...
David's still grinning as he reaches his downtown office
tower. He enters through the revolving door--
David exits through a steel door., it clangs shut behind him.
He stands there unable to proceed for a long beat then starts
walking to the corner to orient himself.
Down one street he spots the Manhattan Bridge, down the other
the Brooklyn Bridge. He's in DUMBO.
A thousand-yard stare on his face, David walks toward
downtown Manhattan amid dozens of--pedestrian commuters.
David sits on a bench looking at the water. The wind picks
up and he puts his hands in his,coatpockets to keep them
warm. His right hand feels something. He pulls out a
ticket for the 4 pm Circle..Line tourist boat cruise.
The boat pulls away front=the dock. It's misting rain so
there's only asmattering of tourists on-board. David stands
looking back at Manhattan. Harry is next to him.
HARRY
A lot of people just collapse when
they see what you've s'een. Their
personal choices suddenly seem
meaningless to them. Life starts
to feel pointless.
DAVID
I was` raised to believe there's
something behind the curtain. I
just never pictured it quite like
this.
HARRY
Most people don't.
Harry looks over his shoulder, scans for any signs of his
colleagues. He's far from relaxed.
HARRY
How are you feeling?
DAVID
You should know. You can read my
mind, right?
2/12/09 38.
Harry hesitates...as if he's not sure how much to tell David,
how far to go with this. Finally:
HARRY
Richardson was just trying to scare
you.
DAVID
He knew what color I was thinking.
HARRY
Because he set it up as a choice.
"Choose a color. Choose a number"
DAVID
So?
Harry looks away. He's crossing a line. He's really putting
himself out there:
HARRY
We can't read your mind or hear
your thoughts. But before you make
a choice your brain weighs options,
and we percpite that. We know if
you're going to go off Plan "or not
because, as long as we're close
enough, we cansense it when it's
about to happen.
DAVID
it-;' s like a sixth sense for you?
HARRY
Seventh, actually.
DAVID
What did they do too Charlie?
HARRY
Made some small change in the way
he assesses risk.
DAVID
What type of risk?
HARRY
(this is beside the point)
I don't know. Something arcane.
Something to do with mortgage-
backed securities.
DAVID
That's all?
2/12/09 39
HARRY
Yes.
DAVID
What would your colleagues do to
you if they knew what you were
telling me?
This is precisely what Harry has been worried about.
HARRY
That's why we're meeting out here.
DAVID
They're not following me?
HARRY
We don't have the manpower to
follow everybody all the time.
They're checking in on you. Just
not here. Not right now.
ON David's face considering this.
Moments later. They stand out of earshot of the few
tourists up here.
DAVID
Why are you helping me?
HARRY
I have my reasons.
David studies him. Ha=rry's' clearly not ready to go into
THEM:
DAVID
Why do they care if I'm with Elise?
HARRY
Your entire reality gets shattered
this morning and you want to know
about a woman?
DAVID
Why do they care?
Harry looks back at him. Taken aback a bit by how much David
seems to care.
HARRY
I don't know.
2/12/09 40.
DAVID
You have no idea?
HARRY
All I know is, given the amount of
resources they've used, keeping you
from her is pretty important to
them.
(off David's silence)
You're going to look for her aren't
you?
Again, David is silent.
HARRY (CONT'D)
There are twelve million people in
this city. On a slow day. You're
not going to find her, you do
realize that, don't yore-?
(BEAT)
Even if a hypnotist pulled her
number out of the recesses of your
brain, no matter how many times you
called it, you,'d never get
through...
DAVID
(his face hardening)
They send you here to tell me that?
HARRY (CONT'D)
You want my advice? Forget about
her. Accept that you'`>ll never see
her again. Move on with your life.
ON David as Harry's words sink in.
FADE TO:
Huge shafts of morning sunlight cut across the park outside
David's apartment. The trees are blooming. It's Spring now.
David exits Starbucks with a coffee. He walks across the
park toward the same Fifth Avenue bus stop he did three years
ado.` Even his posture and,-gait are different.
The bus stops. David jumps out on Broadway. FOLLOW him as
he takes off across the street and runs down 12th. He
catches up to her at University Place.
DAVID
Elise!
The woman turns around.
And it's her...
ELISE
David?
DAVID
Hi.
ELISE
Wow... How areyou.
Reeling from the adrenaline; David takes a moment, then:
DAVID
(from the heart)
I rode the Ml to work every day for
the last three years hoping one day
I'd run into you again.
She's amused, rather than moved, because she doesn't buy it.
ELISE
Calling would have been easier.
DAVID
I couldn't.
ELISE
Girlfriend wouldn't let you?
2/12/09 43.
DAVID
No girlfriend.
She looks at him with continued skepticism. But his
expression is dead serious.
DAVID (CONT'D)
Can we go somewhere and talk?
She hesitates. It hurt when he didn't call. She's angry at
herself for that, but it's the truth.
ELISE
(re: his suit)
Don't you have to get to work?
DAVID
I just got sick.
ELISE
"I haven't seen you in three years -
- You make me sick" is not an
ideal come-on. For the record.
David smiles. She's softening. A little. His phone
vibrates. He pulls it out of his pocket.
DAVID
One second.
(PICKING UP)
CharlieT can't make breakfast.
CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
Why not?
DAVID
And...I might have to push the
speech.
CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
What? Are you crazy?!
DAVID
I just ran into Elise.
He hangs up.
ELISE
You just hung up on your best
friend.
DAVID
We've known each other since we
were kids. We have a shorthand.
2/12/09 44.
He's not being flip or clever or smooth. He's being matter-
of-fact. Serious.
ELISE
What speech?
DAVID
Doesn't matter. Let's take a walk.
His focus on her is absolute. But she's wary of getting
reeled in again.
ELISE
Where?
DAVID
Somewhere far. We have a lot to
talk about.
ELISE
I don't think you should cancel
your speech. What if I don't like
you at the end of our walk?
DAVID
I'll take my chances.
ELISE
Seri6us1y, my number hasn't
changed:. Just call me like you
didn't last time.
DAVID
My-speech will always be there, you
might not be.
ELISE
(AMUSED/INDIGNANT)
I was there, David. You didn't
callrie!
DAVID
Walk with me and I'll explain that.
She's still dubious. His phone vibrates. This time he turns
it off .
DAVID (CONT'D)
(a statement of fact)
I'm not losing you again. I'm not
letting you out of my sight.
ELISE
Stalker.
2/12/09 45.
DAVID
Can we walk?
The moment she finally relents, CUT TO:
FOLLOWING SHOT
Polished black shoes running down a corridor on an impossibly
shiny black floor with inlaid decorative silver borders.
David and Elise walk north.
ELISE
It's been years, David. How do
you know I don't have a boyfriend?
Oh, shit. He hasn't even had time to think about that.
DAVID
you have a boyfriend?
EL ;E
Would it-Matter?
DAVID
(TRAPPED)
Uh...yeah...
ELISE
So all the stuff about me being in
your mind constantly for the last
three years was just talk... The
truth is you don't have any real
conviction.
DAVID
It wouldn't matter.
ELISE
So you don't care about being a
home-wrecker?
2/12/09 46.
DAVID
Okay... if you were married it would
matter.
ELISE
Now you're just trying to say what
you think I want to hear.
A beat. She lets David twist in the wind...
ELISE
I'm single.
ON David's face: relief...
ELISE
Now let's hear your bullshit excuse
for never calling me.
DAVID
I didn't have your number.
ELISE
What?
DAVID
It was taken from me. I was
mugged.
ELISE
Oh, come on.
DAVID
Your number was in my Wallet and
they ,:took it.
ELISE
Come on..
DAVID
I'm serious. What else could
possibly-explain my fawning all
over you on that bus three years
ago...and again today and not
calling you in between?
ELISE
(DUH)
Um, you had a girlfriend and you
felt guilty. I have a thing about
being lied to, David.
DAVID
I swear to God I didn't have your
number. I swear on my parents'
graves.
2/12/09 47.
DAVID (CONT'D)
I didn't even have a last name to
try to track you down. Do you know
how many pages come back when you
type "Elise" into Google?
(BEAT)
And none of them were you.
ELISE
(after a beat)
You really are smooth.
DAVID
That's not fair.
ELISE
It's okay. I like it. I probably
shouldn't, but I do.
(BEAT)
It's Sellas. Elise Sellas.
Richardson and McCrady Step out of a small outdoor bar
structure. They, SpotDavid and Elise walking in the side
door of the restaurant.',.,
Somehow Richardson and' McCrady have travelled from downtown
Manhattan to the middle of Central Park in the time it took
David and Elise to' walk 100 feet...
Richardson surreptitiously watches David and Elise while
McCrady consults his Planbook. A RICHARDSON AIDE steps out
of the same door Richardson and McCrady came through.
RICHARDSON AIDE
Morris is on the artistic director.
Melton is on Charlie Traynor.
RICHARDSON
This whole thing will be over in an
hour.
MCCRADY
(disturbed by something he
sees in his Planbook)
We may not have that long.
RICHARDSON
What?
MCCRADY
Her decision tree is diverging from
our models.
RICHARDSON
(CONFIDENT)
36 hours without contact and she'll
never speak to him again. I've
studied her file. Her deepest fear
in life is--
2/12/09 51.
MCCRADY
No, something is wrong. I'm
already seeing inflection points.
Off Richardson's surprised look--
McCrady examines his Planbook diagram. With each new update
of the diagram red "inflection points" move across the pages
toward a heavy black "present time" line on the right side of
the right :page
Richardson points at the red point closest to the present
tithe ` hrie .
RICHARDSON
What's that?
MCCRADY
If they kiss...
RICHARDSON
(DISBELIEVING)
A kiss, that's all it takes?
MCCRADY
A real kiss. But once they do that
every possible adjustment that's
strong enough to break them up will
cause ripples over your limit.
2/12/09 52.
RICHARDSON
If Melton and Morris do their jobs
right we'll be okay.
But Richardson is clearly worried.
Richardson and his team watch as David, convinced now he's
still undiscovered, stands up and heads to the door with
Charlie and Elise.
MCCRADY
The "four blocks" thing was a
brilliant move, boss.
RICHARDSON
(putting his hat on)
We're not out of the woods yet.
He looks down at the inflection points in McCrady's Planbook.
Richardson makes a gesture at the TV by the bar. The picture
changes (though we can't see to what).
He then moves a water glass on'their table. The sun hits the
glass and reflects into the bar area where--
A horrified look from Richardson--
Richardson and his colleagues all breathe a large sigh of
relief.. .as they watch David leave.
MCCRADY
We're okay...
RICHARDSON
That was way too close. What the
hell is going on with this case?
David pulls up outside. Hundreds of his supporters and the
press are waiting for him. He gets out of the car to cheers.
The audience applauds energetically. David nods "thank you"
and steps away from the lectern they set up. He shakes two
or three people's hands but then heads inside the building.
David looks at thepiece of..paper. An.address on West
Broadway for "Nyman Studios " He's standing at the locked
front door. No one inside. Richardson is on to him.
The surprise on his face turns to anger.. .then resolve.
He dials Elise's number on his cell. Gets voicemail.
DAVID
Elise ...I doubt you'll ever get
this message but--
JUMP CUT
David dials 411.
DAVID
Can I have the number for the
Manhattan Modern Ballet...
2/12/09 62.
He looks down to see his phone has zero bars...
Through the window we see he saleswoman dial a number ... then
look at the phone and shrug. It's dead. She and David go
to her computer. She looks at it, puzzled. It's dead too.
PULL BACK to REVEAL Richardson and McCrady.
MCCRADY
He's going to go next door:.
Just then David exits the furniture store and goes next door
to a clothing store--
MCCRADY
You can't keep.-thephones and
internet down on the whole block,
for too much. longer without running
into ripple problems...
David exits the office to find Richardson on the sidewalk.
With McCrady nearby.
RICHARDSON
There is an entire world of women
out there. I thought I made it
clear this one was off limits.
David takes off walking.
DAVID
I must have forgotten. It's been a
while.
RICHARDSON
Doesn't change the fact.
David looks around, trying to figure out his next move.
DAVID
Why are you so.determined to keep
us apart?
RICHARDSON
You know: why.
DAVID
The Plan? If there is a Pi ri you
misread it.
RICHARDSON
There's no misreading what the Plan
says about you and Elise. It's
unequivocal.
DAVID
Then your Plan's wrong.
RICHARDSON
Do you realize who wrote this Plan?
DAVID
I don't care.
Richardson grabs him and pushes him against a brick wall.
RICHARDSON
Well you should. You need to learn
a little more respect.
David shoves him off. Looks like he might take a swing at
Richardson. Then his eye catches the complex diagram that
McCrady is looking at in his Planbook.
2/12/09 64.
DAVID
Why are you keeping us apart?
RICHARDSON
Because the Plan calls for it.
BECAUSE--
DAVID
(FLARING)
You put us together three times--
RICHARDSON
That was chance. That wasn't us.
DAVID
Three times? Bullshit! If I'm not
supposed to be with her then why do
I feel like this?
RICHARDSON
It doesn't matter what you feel.
It matters what's in black and
white.
David's ready to explode: at him when he sees something in
Richardson's eyes. David stops.. .then his whole expression
changes...
DAVID
You don't know, do you? You don't
know why they're keeping us
apart...
RICHARDSON
(COVERING)
'It's not something your mind could
:comprehend.
DAVID
You're in a nice suit but the
reality is you're just a minion
aren't you?
David pushes past Richardson and walks into a busy
restaurant. McCrady quickly consults his Planbook.
MCCRADY
He's deciding how to--
(REALIZING)
Uh..oh--
From outside, Richardson and McCrady watch.
RICHARDSON
Son of a bitch.
MCCRADY
He's smart. He's very smart.
David exits the restaurant from another door. He hurries
toward West Broadway.
Not a taxi in sight. David looks for one in vain. Suddenly
Richardson emerges from a storefront and, goes to David.
RICHARDSON
Maybe you should try the subway.
David holds him in a steely gaze.
DAVID'
Don't all those cab drivers you're
diverting have Plans too? What
about all the other people looking
for cabs in this part of the city
right n6t? What about their Plans?
The ripples must be endless...
Richardson is taken aback that David has figuredthis out.
DAVID
I don't care what you put in my
way, I'm not going to give up.
David walks off, leaving Richardson standing there.
2/12/09 66.
MINUTES LATER -- DAY
Richardson and McCrady watch David looking for a taxi at a
very busy intersection.
MCCRADY
You've got two more minutes keeping
taxis off West Broadway before--
RICHARDSON
(FRUSTRATED)
I need something that's going to
keep him in place longer--
On foot, David heads West towards Hudson St. Several taxis
pass with their roof lights off;. Suddenly, down the street,
he sees one with his roof light on. He runs for. it when--
CRASH -- twenty feet in front of him two cars collide. Metal
crunches and glass breaks. This is no fender bender--
DAVID
Jesus:.,
(looks for Richardson)
Is this how far you people will
go?!
He rushes toward the accident--
ARE
An hour later. Four police cars and an ambulance. They
treating one of the accident"s victims for minor scrapes
]avid is getting intervie,ved by a police officer.
POLICE OFFICER
Unfortunately you're the only
witness, Congressman.
DAVID
How much longer?
POLICE OFFICER
A few more minutes. I'm sorry. I
know you have to meet somebody.
DAVID
I didn't say I had to meet anyone.
POLICE OFFICER
Well ...I just assumed--
2/12/09 67.
Richardson is watching David get interviewed--
RICHARDSON
Amateur! That's an amateur's
mistake!
DAVID
You're not a real cop, are you?
You're one of them. Somebody could
have been killed in that crash!
Doesn't that make you--
"POLICE OFFICER"
Sir, calm down.
But David's already walking away.
DAVID
Sergeant!
He goes to the highest ranking guy on the. scene.
DAVID
I know you heed a statement from
me, but do I have to stay here to
give it to you or--
SERGEANT
No, sir, we know ow to get in
touch with you.
DAVS,D
Thank you. '.Is this man under your
command?
David turns to see that the "Police Officer" who was
interviewing him is gone.
David gets into a taxi.
2/12/09 68.
David's taxi is hitting all the lights iiow.
Richardson and McCrady move swiftly down the block.
Richardson heads up the stairs of a brownstone. Opens the
door to see a street in Chinatown. He slams the door shut.
RI.CEARDSON
Wrong one.
(thinks)..
Two doors down. God, I hate
downtown!
David's taxi heads down 17th from 8th Avenue.
Richardson and McCrady step out of the service door of a
l ilding on the corner of 10th Avenue and 17th.
They can see a taxi, pulling up in front of the Manhattan
Modern Ballet buildig down the block. They run towards it.
MCCRADY
(RE: PLANBOOK)
I've got inflection points. All
they have to do is catch sight of
each other this time--
RICHARDSON
What?
2/12/09 70.
David opens the door to Elise's dance company, oblivious to
Richardson's pursuit.
Richardson dons his fedora as he races toward the studio.
RICHARDSON
Can 'I block the front door?
NCCRADY
He's already through Pit.
RICHARDS6N
The next one!
Richardson and McCrady down the street.
MCCRADY
(re: diagram, confused)
There are several next ones--
2/12/09 71.
RICHARDSON
(EXASPERATED)
I'm blocking them all--
His hand stretches out (as Harry did early on in film)
MCCRADY
Wait, he's--
Richardson grabs the front door and pulls. It's sealed shut.
It won't budge.
WHAT THE-
MCCRADY
Hat! Hat!
McCrady is behind him He points. at Richardson's fedora,
which is on the sidewalk. Fell off when he ran. Richardson
sprints to grab it--
Richardson dashes back to the door--
MCCRADY
(CONSULTING FOLIO)
Forget it! He's already there...
Richardson charges into the lobby to see David staring
through the partially open door to the rehearsal room...
2/12/09 72.
RICHARDSON
Dammit !
McCrady's phone buzzes. He pulls it out and looks at the
caller ID.
MCCRADY
(DREAD)
It's Mr. Donaldson.
Richardson pulls the fedora off his head and crushes it in
his hands.
David turns just in time to see this. At the same time
David realizes the door is no longer "stuck."
RICHARDSON
Celebrate while you can. They'll
just kick it upstairs now You
have no idea what you're up
against.
David just looks at him. He'll deal with that when it
comes...
MCCRADY
Sir?
Richardson grabs the phone and answers --.going outside to
talk.
David turns back to the dance studio. He opens the door to
get an unobstructed view of Elisee,. She spins, arches, dips.
David can't take his eyes off hey`
When the artistic director pauses the routine to give notes,
Elise gives David a. little wave. Then they start again.
David looks back out at Richardson on the street, but he's
gone..
TNT. ADJUSTMENT BUREAU HEADQUARTERS -- DUSK
A defeated Richardson trudges up a long flight of stairs.
ELISE
We moved around a lot then. Dance
was kind of my stability.
DAVID
Sure... it was the only constant in
your life, aside from your
parents...
2/12/09 74.
ELISE
Really more the dance.
She doesn't make a big deal of it but we get it.
DAVID
Oh...
David's phone buzzes. Caller ID shows it's Charlie.
ELISE
I take it this is an unauthorized
social break.
DAVID
I'm a candidate for the US-:Serrate.
I don't have to punch out''when I
leave.
David sends the call to voice.mai
ELISE
Charlie?
DAVID
Couple houtrs while I'm out of touch
won't:ill him.
ELISE
Couple hour, huh? Well, we better
make them,,-,--'count.
A taxi pulls tpa stop.- bavid 'leans over Elise to look out
thew n4ow as he waits fot change from the driver.
What's this-P-
ELISE
What's it look like?
We see the reflection of a dance club in the window.
DAVID
I'm a terrible dancer. I don't
dance.
Elise climbs out. David follows.
ELISE
You don't now. By the end of the
night, you will.
2/12/09 75.
They walk towards "Plan B", a hip joint with zebra wallpaper
and fake palm trees. Salsa music pulses from inside.
DAVID
You're going to teach me to dance
in one night? Not happening.
ELISE
Are you doubting me?
DAVID
Yes.
She spins and shoves him against the wall. Forcefully kisses
him. Then pulls free.
ELISE
Don't.
She turns and walks into the club. David stands there.
DAVID
Holy shit...
David and Elise walk from the waterfront to the street.
ELISE
Next stop, the best 80s club in the
city. You ready?
DAVID
To make an ass of myself for the
third time in one night? 4`r, 6'.
ELISE
(POINTS)
Race me to that light. You lose,
you dance, I watch. You win, I
dance, you watch
DAVID'
What are'the rules of the race---
ELISE
No rules.
DAVID
Hmmm, could get ugly...
He looks down an alley as if he's noticed something. When
she looks, he takes off like a bat out of hell--
ELISE
You bastard!
He's got a good lead, so he flips around and runs backwards.
2/12/09 79.
DAVID
Quit complaining and run.
She catches up. He spins and digs it out. He can't dance,
but he sure can run. He pulls away and wins.
DAVID
Yes!!!!
He pumps his arms in a victory dance.
ELISE
(PISSED SMILE)
That was good. That was very good.
DAVID
You said "no rules".
She punches him in the stomach. Hard. He crumples,
completely unprepared for it.
DAVID
(IT HURTS)
Sweet Jesus! Christ on a crutch!
ELISE
(GIGGLING)
You said you had trouble feeling.
DAVID
You're insane.
ELISE
We. need a cab.
He'laughing through the'pain.
DAVID
I'm serious. You're a maniac. You
should come with a warning label.
ELISE
I do. You just can't see it with
my clothes on.
OFF David biting his lip... and PRE-LAPPING the music--
David and Elise walk into the synthesizer prelude to "I Can't
Wait" by Nu Shooz.
2/12/09 80.
DAVID
Doesn't this song make you feel
like you're at your high school
prom?
ELISE
I was six when it came out. So,
not really.
Brutal. David just shakes his head and smiles as, she pulls
him to the dance floor.
MUSIC
Baby...1-I-I can't wait--
STROBE LIGHTS
As the song kicks in and David and Elise start dancing... A
couple of kids next to them notice David and start pointing
and signaling their approval-
The kids who first spotted David have alerted a few others.
More people in the crowd cheer him on.
David and Elise stand on the pier outside the dance club.
ELISE
You grew up over there?
She indicatesa residential area just behind the docks.
DAVID
(POINTING)
I spent any, entire childhood three
blocks up Carroll Street. We
didn'.t move-` around a lot.
ELISE
What were you like as a. kid?
DAVID
Before sixth grade I spent about
half my time in the principal's
office.
ELISE
You? Really?
DAVID
The only person who spent as much
time down there as me was a girl I
had a huge crush on so I didn't
mind too much.
2/12/09 82.
A smile spreads on Elise's face.
ELISE
(re: the docks)
Did your dad work here?
DAVID
No... My dad filled vending
machines.
ELISE
And you're going to be a
senator...
DAVID
After my brother died my Dad wanted
to get me out of town for a while.
We went to Washington and the day
we arrived he took meto the.
Capitol. We ended up sitting in
the Senate gallery;,all day.
(re: Financial' District
across the river)
We could see that from the end of
my block, but-be never once
encouraged me to go to Wall Street.
His idol was JFK. He thought
business guys were selfish.
ELISE
So...areyou doing all this-:f.or
him?
DAVID
I want to matter. I don't think
that's just forrhim.
Elise,. tucks her head into his shoulder.
ELISE
I don't want tonight to mess
anything..up for you, for the
campaign.
DAVID
Just make sure I make it to Diane
Sawyer on time and I'll be fine.
Elise looks at him for a long beat.
ELISE
You're different... somehow you make
me believe...
DAVID
Believe what?
2/12/09 83.
ELISE
Just... believe, period.
PUSH IN on the window of an apartment.
Thompson .exits through the frt door. Three aides are
waiting for him.
THO Mft N'S AIDE
What do you aiat to do?
THOM BON
Let it happen again.
7 Thompson's aides seem surprised by the answer.
David jumps into a taxi.
David carries her from the taxi into the emergency room...
David sits alone on a bench. Thompson arrives.
THOMPSON
You're an educated man. You've
read the Greek tragedies`. In the
end Fate always wins...
David looks back at him in steely silence.
THOMPSON
It a sprain.
DAVID
Really?
THOMPSON
This time.
(BEAT')
Do you really want to watch her
lose the only thing she's ever
cared about? You just got the
tiniest taste of what that looks
like...
The thought makes David ill.
THOMPSON
Walk away. If you truly love her,
walk away. She'll hate you for
it...but that way she'll be able to
let you go quickly. You can give
her that at least.
2/12/09 100.
David exits the building. Thompson is waiting by the door.
THOMPSON
You're doing the right thing,
David. Not just for her, and the
world. . .but for yourself.
David looks at him for a beat, then turns and walks away into
the night.
FADE TO BLACK.
David shakes hands with people in the aftermath of his
speech. They really do love him.
It's pouring rain. David walks down Carroll Street. Most of
the row houses display "Norris for Senate" signs.
Most of the housing here is run-down but this block is
clearly in the early'stages of gentrification.
David pays particular attention to one row house as he passes
by. Was this his house?
There's a "Norris for Senate" sign prominently displayed in
the window. David enters this classic dive bar and goes to
the bartender.
DAVID
Do you still serve neighborhood
guys here or just the tourists?
The bartender smiles big. A couple people at the bar notice
him. Then others notice and they start whooping it up for
him. He doesn't know any of them-but they sure know him.
David sits under the huge aluminum roof on one of the piers,
holding a bottle of beer in a soaked paper bag.
2/12/09 104.
There are no walls to this structure so rainwater pours off
the roof on all four sides forming virtual walls.
A figure in a suit approaches David from behind. He turns
to see the man.
DAVID
Why are you here?
REVERSE to REVEAL Harry, in a suit and raincoat.
HARRY
I would have come earlier but I had
to wait for the rain.
(off David's confusion)
Water interferes with their ability
to sense your decision tree.
That's why we met on a boat last
time.
(BEAT)
I guess I'm here to set the record
straight.
DAVID
About what?
HARRY-
Thompson was lying when he said
they couldn't let you be with 8lise
because :it would bring out your
reckless side.
DAVID
Why, then? Why do they care so
much?
HARRY
8ecause.,..she's enough, David. If
you have =her r tau rtt .ght not need to
fill the d side you with votes
and ataplause'and dreams of one day
becoming p sident...
if Harry has:looked straight into David's soul.
HARRY
I've watched you a long time.
They're right to want you in the
White House. It would be good for
the world. That's important but it
can't be the only thing that
matters.
DAVID
Why are you so different than they
are?
2/12/09 105.
A long beat, then:
HARRY
You know, your Dad was a smart man.
He could have been a lot more --
and he wanted to be. So did your
brother. But the Plan didn't call
for that.
This hits David hard.
HARRY
In my job, you implement the
Plan...
(EMOTIONAL)
And most of the time.. .you don't
even know why...
(BEAT)
I'm sorry...
DAVID
My mom?
HARRY
That wasn't me... that wasn't us at
all.
David takes all this in. After a;long be t he takes a drink.
Then he offers the bottle to Harry, who h a esitates, then takes
a drink as well.
DAVID
When Thompson told methe choice
as Elise or the White House I
barely hesitated.
D1 ID
But the trt t i `is after making that
choice I went into a free-fall...
Don't get=me wrong, it killed me to
see Thompson hurt her...but I used
it as an excuse. I think I left
her more to save my career than
hers.
(STRUGGLING)
Thompson wasn't lying. The press is
already talking about me as a
future president. I'm phoning in
my speeches and I'm still sixteen
points up in the polls.
HARRY
The public loves you.
2/12/09 106.
DAVID
Before I met Elise that was all
that mattered. Now I hardly
notice. She's all I think about.
(BEAT)
Do you know where she's getting
married?
HARRY
Front of a judge. Tomorrow
morning.
DAVID
Is she happy with him? Tell me she
is and I'll walk away.
HARRY
Thompson won't let you get near
that courthouse.
DAVID
Harry... is she happy?
HARRY
No.
A beat.
DW-ID
I have to get her back..
Harry knows how unlikely that is.
DAVID
Will you help me: Just help me
get to her...
HARDY
They'll sense )tOu coming a mile
away.'
DAVID
What if Icould move as fast as you
can?
HARRY
What do you mean?
DAVID
Teach me about the doors.
HARRY
How do you know about that?
2/12/09 107.
DAVID
The first day, after they caught
me, they carried me through one.I
thought it was a hallucination at
first. Eventually I realized it's
how you move around so fast.
(off Harry's reluctance)
If you don't want to help me
because of what they'll do to
you...okay, that's your choice.
But if this is about protecting me
then shouldn't the choice be mine?
HARRY
Do you have any idea how
complicated it is to navigate
through those doors... how many
thousands of permutations there are
in even a simple several block
journey?
DAVID
You know, when I do town hall
meetings I usually get introduced
to forty or fifty people between
when I walk, through' the door and
when I start speaking. But when
I'm done with the speech I can call
on each one of them by `game.
A beat...
HARRY
I've seen you do that
(taking tl leap )
The rain is supposed to stop in the
nexthou'r. We're going to need all
night to do this. And we're going
to need aplace surrounded by water
to do it.
MOMENTS LATER
Harry and David stand outside a door to a dock office at the
end of the pier. Harry dons his hat.
HARRY
Put your hand on my shoulder. And
don't let go until we've crossed
the threshold.
2/12/09 108.
David complies. Harry opens the door.
DAVID
Are they ever locked?
HARRY
Maybe if you have a defective hat.
They step through the door and onto--
Harry notices as the rain slows to a drizzle.
HARRY
Hurry.
Harry runs David to the front dooraf a brownstone. Opens
the door. They move through i into--
-
Elise enters, smiles at the receptionist.
ELISE
Floor open?
RECEPTIONIST
(seeing Elise's red eyes)
You okay, sweetie?
ELISE
I just feel like being on the
floor.
RECEPTIONIST
Everything still on for tomorrow?
Elise nods, trying to cover her ambivalence.
2/12/09 109.
Elise exits to the street, pulls a scarf around her neck..
The early morning sun slices through the urban canyons.
David blows through a drab utility door into an alley. He
careens around a corner onto Greenwich Street and starts an
all out sprint--
David runs through a puddle as he races down Greenwich St.
through the pouring rain.
David can see the blue door. He races toward it.
Thompson rushes out the front..door of a perfect Ar-t Deco
tower and jumps into his black Mercedes.
THOMPSON
(to his assistant)
Where is heribw?!
THOMPSON'S AIDE
GREENWICH STREET-
They jump in and the car peels out, followed by two others.
id'hits theblue-_..door. Bang. He's through it like
liihtning and comes 'out--
He comes out of a building directly across from the
courthouse from Harry's photos.
Thompson's three Mercedes skid to a stop outside.
David and Elise exit through a door. Her jaw drops.
REVERSE TO REVEAL Central Park's Sheep Meadow spread before
them. (They've exited from the building on its north edge).
Elise steps out onto the grass, touches it, falls to her
knees in the rain, completely overwhelmed...
2/12/09 123.
Eliselooks at David
DAVID
The rain slows them down but they
can track us. We have two orthree
minutes. Maybe less.
Elise is still speechless. He takes her hand.
DAVID
The ten year-old in me always mixed
up winning elections with being
loved. Then I met` you;,..
(BEAT)
The thing is, if they'd let me be
with you I wouldn'tk have left
politipe. t, just would have beef
in it, or. all the right reasons.
David pauses for a moment. He can see this' so clearly in his
head. How can it notbe right?
DAVID
Now you know. Youknota everything.
And you have to leave mitie.
ELI
BAVA)
They'll take` dance from you. You
saw what they-'did before.
'fihe foundations of her world have just collapsed... but
somehow she pulls herself together to say this:
ELISE
No.
DAVID
You're not safe with me. If you
DON'T LEAVE--
She puts her finger to his lip. Shhhh...
2/12/09 124.
ELISE
It doesn't make any sense but,
right now I feel safer than I've
ever felt before.
(BEAT)
I'm staying...
Tiey`look for another door.
ELISE
Every door?
tavid nods...as they walk into another...
Thompson and a dozen other men with hats step out into the
rain, scan the horizon for any sign of their quarry.
David and Elise head towards a door across the street from
the Banana Republic.
They emerge through a door on the 125th Street Metro-North
platform. Run down the stairs to street level.
David and Elise head toward a storefront church.
Thompson and his men pour out onto the street flashing NYPD
badges and asking questions. /
David and Elise enter the church and--
EXT STONE FACADE -- DAY
-- exit from a metal door in a stone facade. PULL BACK to
REVEAL that they are standing at the base of the Statue of
Liberty...
Elise looks out at the harbor and the city. Rain pelts her
face. And she smiles. Exhilarated. Like a prisoner who has
just broken her chains...
Rain bounces off the dozen long black raincoats worn by
Thompson and his men. A black Suburban with under-grill
police lights pulls up fast.
2/12/09 126.
DRIVER OF SUBURBAN
The Intervention Team has
pinpointed an interception point.
Thompson circles his finger in the air to tell his men to
saddle up, they're moving out--
Elise isstill smiling.
DAVID
Let's go.
ELISE
We can't keep running forever,.
David.
DAVID
If they find us ...they'll take you
from me.
ELISE
I won't let..them.
DAVID
They'll take you from here.
David touches his head'.
ELISE
No, I won't let them.
She leans,-.over and kisses hi's forehead.
INT T. ?RE 'WAR APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY
David and Elise exit into a hallway with eight doors on it.
DAVID
Perfect.
David picks a door. It's locked. He tries another. It's
ONE --
locked too. He tries a third. Locked. Elise tries
shakes her head.
DAVID
They're not supposed to be locked!
David hears sounds coming from the building's central
staircase. He looks down it to see four men in silver suits
climbing up the stairs.
2/12/09 127.
DING. The elevator door down the hall opens. More men in
silver suits.
ELISE
This one's open!
Elise is standing at the door to the roof. David runs to her
and they go up the stairs together to--
David pushes the roof door shut, barricades it with some
concrete blocks sitting on the roof. Rain pours down on
them.
They rush to the edge of the roof. ,Three Con Edison vans are
parked haphazardly on the street below. And a dozen
civilians on the sidewalk are frozen..11: ;
David grabs Elise and they go to the side of the roof, the
roof of the building next door is ten feet below them. They
hang their legs over the edge and jump.
They sprint across the roof of the building next door --
except somehow they find themselves running across the same
roof they were just on.
David sees the concrete blocks he placed against the door a
moment ago. The door bangs against theme being shoved open
from inside.
David and Elise run back in the c5,pposite direction. At the
building's edge they climb over again and... run...
Only to find that theyare still on the first roof they were
on. It's like they're in an.Escher painting.
They stop, and look at each other. David takes her hand as
Adjustment Team trsapers appear all around them from adjacent
roofs. They're completely surrounded.
ELISE
Kiss me.
Tears well in her eyes. And his.
ELISE
Close your eyes and kiss me.
He does. And they kiss in the rain...
ELISE
I love you, David Norris.
2/12/09 128.
They hold each other for a long beat ... . and then, finally,
open their eyes.. .ready to accept their fate--
They see an empty roof. The Silver Suits are gone. And the
rain has stopped. A strange silence envelopes them...
They spin the other direction to see The Chairman, standing
there, alone.
THE CHAIRMAN
Hello, David... Good morning,
Elise.
His voice is gentle, paternal.
DAVID
Who are you?
THE CHAIRMAN
I think you know.
David and Elise stand in awe'-'as they realize.
DAVID
You can't oti{rn Fate...
Tft , CHAIRMAN
It's .more- complicated t,}an that,
Fate am Free Will coexist
They're;in tension with each other.
And pure chance.
A beat. David looks back at him...
DAVID
TH2;.>HAT, RMAN
I could control 'everything. You'd
be ha` 3 ou' d be puppets. I
try to .keep things from getting too
out of control. But that has a
cost. Most people go through life
like pinballs, reacting predictably
to the stimuli I apply. They
accept the path they find
themselves on. And perform
accordingly. But every once in a
while someone comes along who
refuses to be bound by his fate,
someone who understands that Free
Will is a gift most people are too
afraid to use.
(BEAT)
Which, you see, is partly the point
of all this.
2/12/09 129.
THE CHAIRMAN (cont'd)
Or maybe you don't see it. Maybe
you just feel it. And that's even
better. Because that's the other
part.
David and Elise take it in...
DAVID
And all the misery, all the pain...
THE CHAIRMAN
I sit up there and I watch it and
it hurts me... . but if you could see
the incredible courage people show,
the random acts of kindness, the
love... If you could see huitan
beings choosing every moment
every day to be better thAn'' I made
them, you would know it's all
worthwhile.
(BEAT)
Good luck, David. And good luck to
you, Elise. You're a-beautiful
dancer. And so much more...
The Chairman turns to his aide, who we didn't know was there.
THE CHAIRMAN
Their case isclosed.
AIDE TO THE CHAIRRMAN
But, Sir,isn't this a majtr.
deviation from The Plan?
The Chairmen turns to another aide who is holding a folio
open and signs- a document on -ery heavy paper.
THE CHAIRMAN
Not anymc3e .
David and Elise watc]i The Chairman walk away, still awed by
what=they've just experienced. As He disappears around a
corner, the sun comes out from behind the clouds ...
After a long beat, Elise turns back to David, as if to say
"what do we do now?"
DAVID
Maybe we should go dancing.
A smile slowly spreads across her face ...
