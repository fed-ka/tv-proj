      INT. JURY ROOM - NIGHT11

    An empty room.  12 chairs, 12 pads of paper, 12 pencils.  
      Neat as an altar.  The sound of people approaching.  A door 
      opens.  Twelve jurors enter.   

                                  GEO
                    So we can talk now, right?  The 
                    trial s over so we can talk? 

    GEO (36).  African-American.  Good-humored.  Works at an 
      amusement park, fixing roller-coasters.  Likes everyone.  

                                  MITCH
                    We can talk.  We can swear.  We can 
                    do whatever we want.   

      MITCH (52).  Wealthy market analyst.  Likes to think he 
      communes with the  common people.    

                                  DR. MINER
                    Okay, so let s do bathroom breaks first, 
                    then we ll get down to it.  Okay?

    DR. MINER (35) announces to the room.  Physics professor.  
    The fun prof.  An evergreen smile.  The leader in any room.  
    Geo leans in toward Mitch:

                                  GEO
                    So what do you think?  Guilty, 
                    right?  She did it.

                                  SARAH
                    Actually, I think we should wait.  
                    For everybody.

      SARAH (27).  Young law school student.  Type A.  Loves the 
      process.  Geo rolls his eyes: sure.  As...

                                  LENA
                    Did you see her-- at the defense table? 

      Joining the table, mid-conversation is LENA (75).  Old but 
      spry in a beret. A Beat poet from Ferlinghetti days.  With...

                                  MARISOL
                    Whichher?  The one with the 
                      televangelist?

      MARISOL (30s).  Latina.  Mother of four.  Sticks up for 
      herself.  Works in airport security.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #117     "Doubt"     GREEN COLLATED     2/23/10      2.

                                  LENA
                    No, no.  The one who sucked the toes.  
                    What was his name?  The prostitute.  

      Suddenly excitement at the table: gossip:

                                  MITCH
                    Oh, are you talking about the defense 
                    attorney?  She s the wife, right?

                                  GEO
                    Right!  I thought I recognized her.  
                    At the defense table...

      INT. CRIMINAL COURT - COURTROOM #304 - DAY22

      ALICIA.  Second chair.  Attentive to WILL S opening statement:

                                  WILL
                    Reasonable doubt.  Now what do we 
                    mean by  reasonable doubt ?  

      INT. JURY ROOM - NIGHT33

    The twelve jurors gather around the table, gossiping:  

                                  GEO
                    I thought her husband got out-- 
                    didn t he get out?  

                                  MITCH
                    Talk about using her: putting her 
                    at the defense table like that.  

      Cross-talk.  A mess of voices.  Dr. Miner interrupts, calling 
    to everybody...

                                  DR. MINER
                    Okay, okay, is everybody ready?  

                                  SARAH
                    Do we want to vote first?  

                                  DR. MINER
                    Right. Good idea. Everybody take a pad.  

      INT. CRIMINAL COURT - COURTROOM #304 - DAY44

      Will s opening statement:





                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #117     "Doubt"     GREEN COLLATED     2/23/10      3.

      CONTINUED:44


                                  WILL
                    So when you take that vote, you 
                    have to ask yourself... Is this  
                    young woman...

    And Will places his hand on the shoulder of... BIANCA PRICE 
      (24).  Beautiful.  Sports Illustrated model-- with a dose of 
      farm girl innocence.  No make-up.  Sitting next to Alicia...

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    ...capable of murder?  Could Bianca 
                    Price pick up a gun and shoot her 
                    sorority mate in the chest?

      INT. JURY ROOM - NIGHT55

      A pile of little slips with  guilty s  and  not guilty s  on 
      them.  Dr. Miner finishes reading:   

                                  DR. MINER
                    Not guilty... guilty... guilty.
                          (looks up, done)
                    Okay.  Six guilty, six not guilty.

                                  MITCH
                    Of course.  

                                  LENA
                    Which is odd-- given we have six 
                    men and six women.

      Hmmm.  The jurors look up and down the table.  She s right.

                                  MITCH
                    So what reyou saying: this is a-- 
                    sexist thing?

                                  MARISOL
                    Of course not.  This could never be 
                    about her looks.  

      INT. CRIMINAL COURT - COURTROOM #304 - DAY66

      Bianca.  At the defense table.  Beautiful.   

      INT. JURY ROOM - NIGHT77

      A lot of cross-talk.  Argument.  Loud...

                                  MARISOL
                    That s because men can t imagine a 
                    pretty woman killing somebody. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #117     "Doubt"     GREEN COLLATED     2/23/10      4.

      CONTINUED:77


      Laughter.  And cross-talk.  Mitch calling over it:

                                  MITCH
                    Come on!  It s because the 
                      prosecution didn t do their job.
                          (many women laugh)
                    Sure, I voted  not guilty  and 
                    that s not because of her looks--

                                  GEO
                    Why isn t it just as likely that 
                    women are jealousof her looks--?

      Laughter from the women at the table.  And wild cross-talk.

                                  MITCH
                    He s right.  Every woman looks at 
                    that girl, and sees homewrecker--

                                  LENA
                     Girl?   She s a grown woman--

                                  SARAH
                    And every man sees poor little 
                    Jessica Biel-- 

      Laughter.  It s an argument, but everybody s having fun.  

                                  MITCH
                    But look, Saint what s her name--

                                  SARAH
                    --Alicia--

                                  MITCH
                    Right, Alicia Florrick.  She was 
                    sitting right next to her, supporting 
                    her--

      INT. CRIMINAL COURT - COURTROOM #304 - DAYA8A8

      Alicia leans over, pats Bianca s shoulder comfortingly.

      INT. JURY ROOM - NIGHTB8B8

                                  LENA
                    And defense attorneys could never 
                    be pulling tricks--?

      That gets everybody talking.  Arguing.  Until--

                    hands please.  One at a time.

                    Okay, take the cop-- the detective.  
                    Back on the first day of testimony.  
                    He looked right at us and said--

      INT. CRIMINAL COURT - COURTROOM #304 - DAY88

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    The accused was covered with blood.  
                    And she was the only one inthe 
                    room with the victim.  

      DETECTIVE BURTON on the stand.  The confident and handsome 
      detective who flirted with Kalinda (in 113).  MATAN questions:

                                  MATAN
                    And the murder weapon?

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    9 mm auto 6-round.  It was the 
                    defendant s, registered in her 
                    name.  Given to her by her mother 
                    for protection.  

      Burton pauses, seeing KALINDA enter at the back of the court.  
    She smiles.  He smiles right back.

                                  MATAN
                    And the weapon was found on the 
                    ground by her feet?

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    Yes.  With her fingerprints on the 
                    trigger.

                    Who was the girl who entered in the 
                    middle of his testimony?

    The jury room-- gossip.  Cross-talk in the background:

                                  MARISOL
                    Oh, right, he smiled at her.  But I 
                    thought she was with the defense-- THE GOOD WIFE #117     "Doubt"     GREEN COLLATED     2/23/10      6.



      INT. CRIMINAL COURT - COURTROOM #304 - DAY1010

    And we re right back in the moment, Burton continuing...  

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    There was a party downstairs-- for 
                    spring break.  Thirty individuals.

                                  MATAN
                    And they heard the shot?

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    Yes, sir.  Within thirty seconds, 
                    they burst into the sorority room 
                    and found the accused, Bianca 
                    Price, standing over the body.

      Matan goes to a Powerpoint computer, clicks a key, and a 
      photo appears on a large screen: a dead woman s body in a 
      sorority room, blood, a lot of students rushing in, and 
      Bianca clearly standing over the body.

                                  MATAN
                    How long after the murder was this 
                    photo taken?

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                      Approximately thirty seconds.  The 
                    good news about murders at colleges 
                    these days, everybody has a 
                    cellphone camera, so it s hard to 
                    get away with murder--

                    That wasn t a question, Mr. 
                    Gardner, but I would warn the 
                    witness to avoid editorializing.

    We see it s our good friend, JUDGE CUESTA on the bench.  
      Burton nods, smiles, eyes Kalinda as he answers...

                    My apologies, your honor.

      Kalinda smiles back, pauses, looks again at the photo on the 
      large screen: something about it.  Kalinda leans toward CARY 
      sitting behind the defense table, whispers:

                    Why?

    She shoots him a look.  Okay, he finds a file, hands it to 
      her.  She opens it, intently studies the same cellphone photo-- 
      something bothering her about it-- as...

                    So, Detective Burton, you were the 
                    first officer on the scene?

      Will cross-examining now...

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    Yes, Mr. Gardner.  

                                  WILL
                    And where was your partner?

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    He was out sick.

                          (for the jury)
                    So you were there unobserved?

      Burton smiles-- used to defense tricks-- shoots a look toward 
      Kalinda who just smiles back: we re all pros here.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    Yes, I was unobserved-- except for the 
                    two dozen college students in the room.

      Kalinda hands a file to Cary who hands it to Will.

                                  WILL
                    And you ve never tampered with

                    is going on here: that Detective

                    Thank you.

      Meanwhile, Alicia joins Will at the gallery bar conferring 
      with Bianca s mother.  MRS. PRICE (44).  An ex-model, but 
      life has been hard on her.  It s softened her features.

                                  MRS. PRICE
                    How did it go, did you think?

                                  WILL
                    It s a good start.  Sorry, we re

                    lawyers did no investigation, and 
                    Cuesta isn t allowing a delay, so

                    money on a better ballistics 
                    expert.  Are you alright with that?

                                  MRS. PRICE
                    Whatever it takes.  She s my only 
                    child.  The thought of her in prison. 

      Alicia nods, looks toward Bianca and Cary as the guards start 
    to escort her away.

                    I ll see you, Mom.

      Mrs. Price follows her along the rail, leaving Will and 
      Alicia standing alone for a second.  Neither knows what to 
      say.  A personal whisper:

      Will finds this strange, but, what the hell, continues:

                                  WILL
                    The problem is the mom fired her

                    Jim Crosby as a ballistics expert...

      McVeigh nods, clearly unimpressed, but being polite...

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Well, I agreed to meet with you.

                    I can suggest some names of people 
                    who will say differently.  But I 
                    wouldn t go with Crosby.  He s not

                    Given the evidence, yes.  If I were

    And McVeigh goes.  Diane and Will trade a look.

                                  WILL
                    The jury has to be told a story.  

      A strategy session.  Will with the troops.  Alicia, Kalinda, 
      Cary, a dozen associates.  

                                  WILL (CONT'D)
                    The prosecution s story is simple: 
                    Bianca shot her best friend out of 
                    jealousy after a threesome.  Our 
                    story has to be just as simple.  

      Kalinda meanwhile types in an address on a laptop, popping to 
    the Albany Park University Student Profile Page of  Jenny 
      Bauer.   A cute Reese Witherspoon sorority type.  Smiling, 
      making suburban gang signs.  Kalinda scrolls down it to a 
      small photo at the bottom.  Under it printed:  My snap helped 
      cops solve MURDER!  

      Kalinda clicks on the photo.  It pops up.  The same crime 
      scene photo from court.  Kalinda places the printed photo 
      next to it.  Nothing unusual; they look identical.  

      Alicia looks over: what reyou doing?  Kalinda whispers:

                                  KALINDA
                    See any difference?

                                  ALICIA
                    No.  Why?

      Kalinda looks closer.  Bottom corner of both frames.  
      Someone s silhouetted foot.  While, Will continues... 

                                  WILL
                    Regarding witness prep, Alicia, 
                    Cary, we re gonna have to delay on

                                  CARY
                    Why?

                                  WILL
                    We lost him.  We re shopping.  

      Kalinda trades a look with Alicia and Cary: that s not good.

                    court in an hour so let s go.

                    police. 

      What?  Will looks at her, studies the screen.  Alicia leans 
    in too.  Looks between the crime scene and Jenny Bauer s Page   
      photos.

                    There s only a split-second between 
                    these two shots.

      Will looks up, realizes...

                    It was a video?

                    Yeah.  And she was always kind of 
                    freaking out about women, so I was 
                    surprised she agreed to go with us.

                    went downstairs for a brew.  And 
                    that s when we heard the shot.  And 
                    I raced upstairs, and I found 
                    Heather on the floor, you know,

                    It s just-- I d never done it 
                    before.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Done what?

    The video on Jenny s computer.  It shows a drunken Jenny in 
    the sorority house starting to unbutton her top...

                                  JENNY (ON VIDEO)
                    Okay, Tim, I do this for you.  You 
                    do it for me.

      Giggles all around on the video.  Jenny horrified, watching:

                                  JENNY (CONT D)
                    I was drunk.  We were just sexting.  
                    If my parents saw this--

                                  KALINDA
                    It s okay.  We don t need-- 

    But Kalinda pauses, seeing Josh in shirt sleeves on the video 
      passing in the background, starting upstairs.  To herself:  

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    That s before the shot.

                                  JENNY
                    What?

                                  KALINDA
                    Josh went upstairs before the 
                    gunshot, not after.

      BOOOOOM!  A loud gunshot from the video.  The camera suddenly 
      rushes upstairs, jiggled around, past shouts--  What 
      happened?/What is it? -- all very Cloverfield.  Finally... 

      ...the cellphone camera turns the corner, barges into 
      Bianca s room, finding a crying Bianca kneeling over a dead 
      Heather.  Gun on the floor.   And--

      --tap-- Kalinda freezes the frame as the wildly panning 
      cellphone catches Josh starting away.  In a brown leather 
      jacket, conferring with another man.  Hispanic.  Intent eyes.  
      Linebacker large.  

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    Who s that?

                                  JENNY
                    I don t know. 

                                  KALINDA
                    Have you seen him before?

                                  JENNY
                    I--  Yeah, at the gym.  I think 
                    he s on the coaching staff or 
                    something.  You re not going to 
                    show this to anyone, are you?

      EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - QUAD - DAY3636

      Kalinda starts out the door, crossing the quad when...

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    What do you got?

      Kalinda smiles, turns to find Burton leaning against a wall.

                                  KALINDA
                    Detective Burton.  Funny to see you 
                    here.  

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    Comical.  Whaddayou got, Kalinda?

      Kalinda smiles, starts off.  Burton falls in behind her.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON (CONT D)
                    So this is what I hear.  Tell me if 
                    I m hot or cold.  You use cops, 
                    suck them dry of intel, then toss 
                    them aside.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Pretty much.  And you, let s see, 
                    how was it put to me?  You have an 
                      exquisitely complicated 
                      acquaintanceship with the truth.  
                          (off Burton s look)
                    You ve burned too many women not to 
                    have them talk.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #117     "Doubt"     GREEN COLLATED     2/23/10      29.

                    And that scares you?

      Kalinda laughs.  Are you fuckin  kidding?   

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON (CONT D)
                    You ve met your match, K.  You just 
                    don t know it yet.

      Kalinda stops.  Leans in toward Burton.  

                                  KALINDA
                    What are you looking for, 
                    detective?  You want to go steady 
                    or something?  

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    Chocolate malt with two straws. 

      Kalinda smiles.  Starts to say something.  Stops.  Then... 

                                  KALINDA
                    Good-bye, detective.  

    And she starts off.  Burton watches her go.

                    This guy.  Who is he?

      A framed photo of the man who conferred with Josh on the 
      cellphone video.  It s on the wall of the athletic office.   

                                  LAWTON
                    Ernie Suarez.  Assistant to the 
                    Athletic Director.  How do you know 
                    Josh again?

      A nerdy Assistant Coach, LAWTON (28), chatting with Kalinda. 

                                  KALINDA
                    I don t.  I m investigating a

                    Yeah, a coach locker.  He hasn t 
                    cleared it out yet.  There.

      A key lock attached to a large locker.  

                                  KALINDA
                    You got the keys?

                                  LAWTON
                    Don t you need a warrant or 
                    something?

                                  KALINDA
                    Yeah, if I were a cop.  I can get 
                    some bolt-cutters in here, but it d 
                    be easier if you just opened it.

      Lawton stares at her, how authoritative she says it.  And-- 

      --LATER-- ka-lick--Lawton unlocks the key lock.  Pauses, 
      stares at Kalinda suspiciously.

                                  LAWTON
                    So you re not a cop?  

                                  KALINDA
                    Nope.

                    And you re not with the campus 
                    police? 
                          (Kalinda shakes her head)
                    So who are you?

                    Kalinda.

      Lawton stares at her.  Okay.  Opens the door.  Finds a dozen 
      laptops in the locker.  

                                  LAWTON
                    Whoa.

                    Yep.  Someone s been busy.  

      Kalinda reaches in, finds a gun in a zippered bag.  Looks up 
    at Lawton, smiles.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY3838

      Kalinda and Alicia follow Will toward his office...

                                  KALINDA
                    Campus police checked the serial 
                    numbers on the computers.  They re 
                    from a series of 30 campus 
                    burglaries over the last year--

                                  WILL
                    Good, so the narrative is this: Josh 
                    killed Heather after she discovered 
                    him burglarizing her room?

                                  KALINDA
                          (nods)

                    when they check Josh s room for

                                  WILL
                    Good.

                                  KALINDA
                    So is that our ballistics expert?

      A short Wallace Shawn-type PROFESSOR DUNN in Will s office.

                                  WILL
                    We ll see.  I m interviewing him 
                    now.  

    And at that second, DUNN fumbles a framed photo he was 
      inspecting, knocking over a glass of water, spilling it 
      everywhere.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    God help us.

                    witness, Josh Mundy, firing the

      A laser pointer.  He takes it out of his pocket nervously.  
    His hand shaking like a leaf.  Judge Cuesta eyes him, 
      unnerved by his nervousness...

                    Sorry.  Um--

    He tries to brace it with his other hand, but-- klack--he 
      drops the laser pointer.

                                  MATAN
                    The defense expert testified that it 
                    could ve been shot by Josh Mundy.

                                  DR. MANN
                    If Mr. Mundy crouched on his knees, maybe.

                    Well, that s unlikely.  Now the defense 
                    ballistic expert when, he finally got 
                    his laser pointer working--

                    gunshot residue found on Bianca 
                    Price s hands could ve come from 
                    her contact with the victim.  Does 
                    that sound likely to you?

                    No.

      Alicia and Will slump inside.  Disastrous for them.  And...

                    I don t know.  Two experts say the 
                    exact opposite thing, and say they re 
                    100% certain.  What do we do with that?

                    from one person to another.  They

      INT. JOSH S DORM ROOM - DAY4343

      A door bangs open.  Campus police enter followed by Kalinda.  
    She looks around, sees DVD players.  Computer components.  
      Speakers.  All looking hot.  As the campus cops search... 

      ...Kalinda notices a photo on the desk.  Looks again.  It s 
      Josh with Heather.  Kalinda takes out her phone, snaps a 
      picture.  Starts into the bedroom.

    She looks around.  Opens the closet door.  Peers in.  Starts 
    to turn away when she turns back.  Sees...

      ...a jacket bundled up on the floor.  Leather.  Brown.  In 
    the back of the closet.  She pulls a hamper out of the way, 
      peers in at it.  She reaches into her pocket.  Takes out...

      ...the folded screen shot of the crime scene cellphone video.  
      There s Josh in the brown leather jacket.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    Anything?  

      Kalinda turns, sees Burton leaning in the door.

                                  KALINDA
                    So is your plan just to follow me?  

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON

                          (shrugs: what the hell)
                    Josh finishes his threesome, goes 
                    downstairs to get a beer in his 
                    shirt sleeves--

    She unfolds the screen capture of Josh in shirt sleeves 
      passing a sexting Jenny.

                    He heads back upstairs.  There s a 
                    gunshot.  Everybody runs up.  And, 
                    seconds later, as if by magic...

                    It s cowboys.  Who knew I loved 
                    cowboys.  Maybe it s in our DNA.  
                    Part of being American.  We all, 
                    salmon-like, head back toward the

                    I doneed to talk like that because 
                    that s how I talk.  There s a 
                      selfishness to the silence of the

      INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT4747

      Kalinda whispers into her cell, waiting outside the 
      interrogation room...

                                  KALINDA
                      Potentially good.  There s gunshot 
                    residue on Josh s jacket.

                                  WILL
                    His--  Where are you?  

      Kalinda stares through the interrogation room window.  The 
      blinds are closed, but a wind keeps them scissoring open, 
      closed, open, closed.

                                  KALINDA
                    Police station.  Something else on 
                    it too.  Heather s blood.

      INTERCUT with: Will stopping in the hall, thanking the ceiling.  

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    The police are interrogating Josh 
                    now.

                                  WILL
                    Good.  I ll have to get a continuance.

                                  KALINDA
                    You may not have to.  The cops are 
                    all over this.  I m outside the 
                      interrogation room.

    She sees through the thwappingblinds glimpses of Burton 
      questioning a pale Josh Mundy.

                                  WILL
                    Okay, phone me when you got something.  
                    I ll get the troops together, we ll 
                    line up the next witness.

                                  KALINDA
                      A different ballistics expert.

                                  WILL
                    Ahead of you. 

      Kalinda hangs up, watches the interrogation, Burton doing a 
      good job, pacing, breaking him down, when... a uniformed COP 
      enters the room, whispers in Burton s ear.  Whispers more. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #117     "Doubt"     GREEN COLLATED     2/23/10      42.

      Burton pauses, looks up at Kalinda through the scissoring 
      blinds.  Uh-oh.  Kalinda sees something s wrong on his face.  
      What?  Burton nods to the cop, goes to the door, exits.

                                  KALINDA
                    What?

      Burton crosses past her, goes to his desk, takes out a bag of 
      candy, pops one, offers it to Kalinda:

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    Malt balls?

                                  KALINDA
                    What s up, Burton?  

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    Well, he did burglarize those dorm 
                    rooms.  He was actually in league 
                    with Heather.  They were planning 
                    to rob your client.

                                  KALINDA
                    Okay, that makes sense.  He kills 
                    his cohort in crime.  

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    And the lab confirms: that isG.S.R. 
                    on his jacket.  And Heather s blood. 

                                  KALINDA
                    Okay.  I m not seeing how this is 
                    bad yet.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    Well, it s not.  For me.  The blood 
                    and G.S.R. are on the inside lining 
                    of the jacket. 

                                  KALINDA
                    Okay, so he had it wrapped around 
                    his shooting hand.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    Josh said the jacket was on the floor 
                    of the bedroom.  When he heard the 
                    shot, he got into the room, grabbed 
                    his jacket from between Bianca and 
                    Heather, put it on, wore it home.

                                  KALINDA 
                    Because he was guilty.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    Yes, of robbery.  
                          (eyes Kalinda)
                    Look, I m not an advocate here.  I 
                    don t lie to make it better for a 
                    client.  I just look at the facts.  
                    And the facts are against you.  

      Kalinda eyes him.  She reaches out, takes a malt ball, pops 
    it in her mouth, as...

        ...bleet-bleet--a cellphone rings quietly beside Alicia 
      asleep on her couch, a quilt over her, red wine, files, only 
    one light on in the background.  She jolts awake, grabs it...

                    We ve just run into a problem with 
                    the narrative.  I think we may need 
                    to put Bianca on the stand.

      Will in his office, sitting with files, a bottle of beer.

                                  ALICIA
                    Oh, I thought Kalinda had something.

                                  WILL
                    It didn t pan out.  You ll be able 
                    to handle the questioning?  

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.

      Will nods.  Silence.  The two in silence.  

                                  WILL
                    I... I know we re in a weird place.

                    It s okay.

                                  WILL
                    No. I don t like being in a weird place.  

      Alicia stands, walks toward the kitchen, checks toward the 
      pantry.  Peter s door closed.  Quietly...  

                                  ALICIA
                    I know.  Me neither.

                    I look at you during the day and I

                    Yeah?

                                  ALICIA
                    If it happened differently, at 
                    Georgetown-- if it was us, not 
                    Peter, we would ve lasted a week.

                    No, we wouldn t have.

                    We would ve.  It s romantic because 
                    it didn t happen.  If it did 
                    happen, it d just be... life. 

      Silence.  Will considers it.  Nods.  And as the two continue to 
      whisper, we move away from Alicia, around the corner to find...

      ...Grace outside her room, in pyjamas, sitting in the dark

      EXT. MCVEIGH S FARM - DAY5050

      Blue crisp skies.  Snow on the ground.  And a distant 
      smothered boom.  It s... 

      INT. MCVEIGH S FARM - BALLISTICS LAB - DAY5151

      ...a gunshot in McVeigh s ballistics lab.  BOOOOOM!  A second 
      shot.  Two people with him.  Will and Diane.

                                  WILL
                    I don t understand.

      McVeigh takes off his ear-protection, shows him the gun he 
      fired...

                                  MCVEIGH
                    9 mm auto 6-shot.Same model as 
                    the murder weapon.  They don t make 
                    them anymore because they have a 
                    hair trigger.  Slightest pressure 
                    fires the mechanism.

      Will trades a look with Diane.

                                  WILL
                    An accidental firing?  

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Yes, but not the one you expect.  
                    The prosecution was correct.  The 
                    shot came from three feet away.  
                    The weapon was in the bottom drawer 
                    of your client s bureau.

      McVeigh has a test drawer on the floor, places the weapon in it.  

                                  MCVEIGH (CONT D)
                    The victim was a thief, checking 
                    drawers for valuables, money.

                    She checked the drawer with the 
                    weapon, reached down to take it, and--

      McVeigh places a dummy bent over the drawer.  He kneels 
      beside it, and-- BOOOM! 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #117     "Doubt"     GREEN COLLATED     2/23/10      46.

      Fires the gun up into the dummy s chest.  The dummy falls 
      backward onto the floor.  The gun falls at the dummy s feet.

                                  WILL
                    You re kidding.

                                  MCVEIGH
                    The weapon was fired from three 
                    feet away, but vertically not 
                      horizontally.  And it was 
                    accidentally fired by the victim.

      Will grabs his cellphone, dials.  Diane shakes her head...

                                  DIANE
                    No service in here.

                                  MCVEIGH
                    The problem was there was no blood 
                    or gunshot residue below the impact-- 
                    that s why I didn t see it.

                                  WILL
                    He took his jacket?

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Mr. Mundy took his leather jacket 
                    from the floor.  That had the blood 
                    and G.S.R. on it.

                                  WILL

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Of course.  The usual fee.

      Diane smiles at McVeigh as he nods back.  But Will steps 
      away, concern on his face.  And...

                    The problem is it s not a good 
                    story.  It s just a freak accident.

                    truth.  There s a villain: Bianca.  
                    There s a motive: jealousy.  This

      Will, Cary, Alicia.  Alicia studies Bianca, her doll s eyes.  
    She seems to be not connecting.

                                  MRS. PRICE
                    So, I don t know-- do we put this 
                    new evidence on the stand or not-- 
                    which is smarter?

                                  WILL
                    Well, that s up for discussion.

      Cary turns to Bianca, tells her directly...



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #117     "Doubt"     GREEN COLLATED     2/23/10      48.

      CONTINUED:5353


                                  CARY
                    Our worry is we tried one defense 
                    with the jury, and now if we try 
                    another, we ll do two things: 
                    undercut our credibility, and hurt 
                    our chances if the jury was believing 
                    our first defense: that Josh did it. 

      Alicia eyes Cary: he really is good at this.  Bianca nods, 
      warming to him as she listens.  Mrs. Price turns to Cary.  

                                  MRS. PRICE
                    We have no idea what the jury is 
                    thinking?

                                  CARY
                    No, it s one of the problems with a 
                    jury.  It s guesswork.  

                                  BIANCA
                    So what should I do?

      Bianca.   She asks Cary, only Cary.

                                  CARY
                    Go with the truth.

      Will and Alicia trade a look.  Appreciative.  Not bad from Cary.

                                  CARY (CONT D)
                    The truth has the advantage of 
                    being... true.  On some level, the 
                    truth is always more believable.

      Bianca smiles, looks up at her mom.

                                  BIANCA
                    Then that s it.  The truth.

      INT. CRIMINAL COURT - COURTROOM #304 - DAY5454

      McVeigh on the stand.  Alicia questioning...

                                  ALICIA
                    And so you believe the gunshot was 
                    self-inflicted?

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Well, I don t believe.  The science 
                    points there.  The gunshot was 
                    accidentally self-inflicted.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #117     "Doubt"     GREEN COLLATED     2/23/10      49.

      CONTINUED:5454


                                  ALICIA
                    Thank you, Mr. McVeigh.

                                  MCVEIGH
                    No problem.

      Alicia sits.  And we see Diane in the gallery, smiling.  He s 
      good.  In fact, the whole courtroom clearly impressed.  Judge 
      Cuesta studies McVeigh with respect.  Matan considers it, 
      stands...

                                  MATAN
                    So, as you say, Mr. McVeigh, you 
                    originally didn t want to testify 
                    in this case?

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Yes.  I thought Miss Price was guilty.

                                  MATAN
                    Right.  And then two days ago you 
                    had an epiphany?

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Well, if by epiphany you mean: a 
                    new piece of evidence-- this jacket 
                    with bloodstain and G.S.R.-- then, 
                    yes, I did have that.

                                  MATAN
                    A change of heart?

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Not my words, but I won t object to them.

                                  MATAN
                    You are staying at the Westin 
                    Chicago River North Hotel while you 
                    testify in another case?

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Yes.

                                  MATAN
                    This is a hotel where many 
                      prosecutors house their witnesses?

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Yes, I believe that s true.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #117     "Doubt"     GREEN COLLATED     2/23/10      50.

                                  MATAN
                    It s a hotel where several 
                      prosecutors observed you meeting 
                    with another lawyer.

      Diane tenses.  Oh shit.  McVeigh just stares at Matan.

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Is that a question?

                                  MATAN
                    No.  Here s the question.  Two nights 
                    ago before you magically changed your 
                    mind about this case, did you have 
                    dinner with a partner from the law 
                    firm, Stern, Lockhart, and Gardner?

      Will pauses, turns back toward the gallery, sees an appalled 
      Diane.  Shit, shit, shit!

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Yes.

                                  WILL
                    Objection!

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    The question s been answered, Mr. 
                    Gardner.

                                  WILL
                    Yes, I m sorry, your honor, it was 
                    answered too quickly.

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    Well let me overrule just as quickly.

      Will sits, appalled, as McVeigh just stares at Matan.

                                  MATAN
                    And after this dinner, the partner 
                    in question, Diane Lockhart, joined 
                    you in your hotel room?

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Yes.

      Diane s face turns red as Will grits his teeth.

                                  MATAN
                    And did you have sexual relations?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #117     "Doubt"     GREEN COLLATED     2/23/10      51.

                                  WILL
                    Objection, your honor!  How is this 
                    relevant?

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    I imagine Mr. Brody would say the 
                    witness s testimony was bought with 
                    these alleged sexual relations, 
                    isn t that correct, Mr. Brody?

                                  MATAN
                    It is, your honor.

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    Well, Mr. Brody, I will sustain Mr. 
                    Gardner s objections.  But I don t 
                    think you ll mind much-- because you 
                    just threw a stink bomb into the lap 
                    of the jury, and now you re running 
                    for cover. 

                                  MATAN
                    Your honor--

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    And, Mr. Gardner, yes, I see the 
                    outrage on your face-- which I 
                    would be more moved by if you 
                    hadn t done the exact same thing 
                    with Detective Burton s testimony.

      Both Matan and Will interrupt:  Your honor! 

                                  JUDGE CUESTA (CONT D)
                    No, no, no.This one we re calling 
                    a draw, gentlemen.  You ve both 
                    been playing fast and loose with 
                      implications, not facts, and so 
                    we re going to try to let justice 
                    take care of itself.  Do you have 
                    any more questions, Mr. Brody?

                    a limiting instruction.

                                  LENA
                    It s almost medieval.  They toss us

                    evidence, and they ask us to come

                                  SARAH
                    They re the defense.  The whole point 
                    is to poke holes in the prosecution s--

                                  GEO
                    But even this ballistics expert 
                    said: two days ago he thought one 
                    thing, now he s thinking another--

                                  MITCH
                    Right!  So what if in three more 
                    days he thinks something else.

    And they stop arguing.  Lena looks toward Dr. Miner.

                                  LENA
                    You look depleted.

                                  DR. MINER
                    I guess I am.  I sit here listening 
                    to everyone talk, and I feel like: 
                    we weren t given enough information.

                                  LENA
                    That sounds about right.

                                  DR. MINER
                    So what do we do?

                                  LENA
                    Do you have reasonable doubt?

                                  DR. MINER
                    I don t know.  I just have...
                          (looks for the right word)
                      ...reasonable ignorance.

      Lena smiles.  The whole table looking toward them as if they 
      were the last two adults in the world.

                                  LENA
                    Well, no one else is going to help 
                    us.  So what do you think? 

    Dr. Miner considers it.  Nods.

                                  DR. MINER
                    I think I m ready to vote.

      Kalinda looks up to see a worried Alicia approaching.  She 
      gets up, goes to her.

      INT. JURY ROOM - NIGHT6161

    Dr. Miner reads the last of the slips.  Looks up.

                                  DR. MINER
                    Okay.  We re unanimous.  Finally. 

    The jurors exhale, exhausted.

                                  DR. MINER (CONT D)
                    Good job.  Democracy in action.

                    So what do we do now?

                    Call the judge.  Tell them we re done.  

    Dr. Miner goes to the door, exits.

                    I bet a lot of jurors trade numbers 
                    and say they ll stay in touch.  But 
                    I bet nobody does.

                                  MITCH
                    So let s just save time and not 
                    trade numbers.

    The door opens again.  Dr. Miner enters followed by Judge 
      Cuesta.  The jurors trade looks.  Surprised.

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    Hello.  Hi.  I thought I d just 
                    join you in here and thank you for 
                    your service.

    He nods.  Smiles.  

                                  JUDGE CUESTA (CONT D)
                      Unfortunately, I now need to excuse 
                    you and thank you for your service.

                                  MARISOL
                    I--  What dwe do?  

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    Nothing.  You did your job well.  
                    This happens sometimes, and there s 
                    no way to prepare for it.  The 
                      prosecution and defense have agreed 
                    to a plea bargain.  Just seconds 
                    ago.

                                  LENA
                    You re kidding?

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    I m sorry I m not.  This happens 
                    sometimes when one side or the other 
                    worries about the outcome.  So again, 
                    thank you.  I hope this doesn t 
                    diminish your enthusiasm for the 
                    court system, because in another year 
                    you re going to get another summons.

      Cuesta chuckles.  No chuckles come from the jurors.  He 
      clears his throat, starts out.

                                  MITCH
                    So what happened?  What was the 
                    plea bargain? 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #117     "Doubt"     GREEN COLLATED     2/23/10      59.

                    Oh.  Miss Price agreed to a charge 
                    of second degree murder.  Ten 
                    years.  Thanks again.

    And Cuesta leaves.  The jurors sit there.  Stunned.  Slowly, 
      they start to get up to leave.  In silence.  The silence of a 
      church.  Geo reaches for the scraps of paper-- their votes.  
    He looks at them and dumps them in...

      ...the trash.  And we look down at the scraps.  They re all 
       Not Guilty.
