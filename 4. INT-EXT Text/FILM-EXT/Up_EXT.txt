Young Carl "flies" his blue balloon ("The Spirit of
Adventure" hand-written on it) as he runs along the sidewalk.
He still wears helmet and goggles.

UP
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Yes, as Muntz himself says:
"Adventure is--"
GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
"Adventure is out there!"
Carl stops.
Who said that?
The voice comes from a dilapidated HOUSE, windows boarded up
and lawn overgrown with weeds.
The weather vane atop the house turns, pulled by ropes.
GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
Look out! Mount Rushmore! Hard to
starboard. Must get the Spirit of
Adventure over Mount Rushmore...
5.
Carl walks toward the voice.
GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
Hold together old girl. How're my
dogs doing? Ruff ruff!
Ambulance.
SIREN blaring.
One lone light on upstairs.
Carl carries her past a "SOLD" sign.
It's the same house
where they met as kids.
Still in their wedding clothes: She saws as he hammers.
Ellie finishes painting "Carl & Ellie" on their MAILBOX.
Carl leans in to admire her work but leaves a messy paint
handprint on the mailbox! Oh well; Ellie adds her handprint
as well. They smile.
Their house now matches Ellie's colorful CLUB HOUSE DRAWING
from her childhood Adventure Book.
11.
They run up a hillside together.
They lie side by side on a picnic blanket. She describes the
clouds. He watches as a cloud transforms into a turtle.
Carl closes his eyes and smiles.
He's lucky to be with her.
Ellie emerges from the South America House, dressed in her
Zookeeper's uniform.
Carl shows off his new BALLOON CART and uniform. Behind him
the balloons lift his cart off the ground. Carl jumps to
catch it. She giggles.
Again at their picnic spot, they watch clouds. Ellie sees an
elephant with wings. Carl gives it a try and points out a
BABY. Ellie lights up, excited. She sees ALL the clouds as
babies! Carl is stunned... but smiles.
Carl looks out the window.
Ellie sits alone under a tree,
the wind in her hair.
12.
Carl joins Ellie.
He hands her the Adventure Book. She smiles.
Carl in his 60's. They still work happily side by side at
the zoo. Carl's cart lifts off the ground. He casually
leans an elbow on it.
Carl buys two tickets to South America.
Carl hurries excitedly up picnic hill.
He hides the airline
tickets in his basket.
Behind him, Ellie falters and falls.
She tries to get up but
falls again. Something is wrong.
He runs to her.
14.
Carl walks into the house, holding a single blue balloon.
FADE TO BLACK.
Many LOCKS are heard unlocking from inside.
The door opens, but bangs against the safety chain.
Carl
GRUMBLES in frustration.
Carl opens the door, walks out onto his porch, pulls the door
shut, and looks as if he's about to go somewhere.
He sits in his porch chair.
Carl's house is the lone surviving square on the block not
under construction. Machinery and workers circle busily.
High rise buildings are being erected all around.
Carl looks at the activity around him.
CARL
Quite a sight, huh Ellie?
(noticing mailbox)
Uhp, mail's here.
Carl walks to the mailbox.
He touches Ellie's faded
HANDPRINT and smiles.
He looks through the mail.
He sees a SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE pamphlet full of
images of happy old people. Carl scoffs.
16.
CARL
Shady Oaks Retirement.
Oh brother.
Carl notices DUST on his mailbox.
CARL
Hm.
He pulls up a LEAF BLOWER.
He revs it and blasts off the dust.
TOM, the CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN, notices.
CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
Hey! `Morning, Mr. Fredricksen!
Need any help there?
CARL
No. Yes. Tell your boss over there
that you boys are ruining our house.
He points across the lot to a business man in a suit talking
on a cell phone - the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER.
CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
Well just to let you know, my boss
would be happy to take this old
place off your hands, and for
double his last offer. Whaddya say
to that?
The leaf blower blasts off his hat.
CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
Uh, I take that as a no, then.
CARL
I believe I made my position to
your boss quite clear.
CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
You poured prune juice in his gas tank.
CARL
Oh yeah, that was good. Here, let
me talk to him.
Tom hands Carl his MEGAPHONE.
CARL
(in megaphone)
You in the suit. Yes, you.
Take a
bath, hippy!
Tom grabs the megaphone.
17.
CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
(to Boss, re Carl)
I am not with him!
(to Carl)
This is serious. He's out to get
your house!
Carl walks to his front door.
CARL
Tell your boss he can have our house.
CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
Really?
CARL
When I'm dead!
Carl SLAMS the door.
CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
I'll take that as a maybe!
The door opens.
A Wilderness Explorer stands, reading from a Wilderness
Explorer Manual. He is in uniform, complete with sash,
neckerchief, hat, and an enormous backpack stuffed with every
piece of equipment there is. This is RUSSELL, age 8.
Russell, nose buried in his MANUAL, reads to Carl.
RUSSELL
"Good afternoon. My name is
Russell. And I am a Wilderness
Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge
12. Are you in need of any
assistance today, sir?"
As he finishes the script, Russell smiles up at Carl.
CARL
No.
18.
RUSSELL
I could help you cross the street.
CARL
No.
RUSSELL
I could help you cross your yard.
CARL
No.
RUSSELL
I could help you cross your... porch?
CARL
No.
RUSSELL
Well, I gotta help you cross
something.
CARL
Uh, no.
I'm doing fine.
Carl closes the door in Russell's face.
A Police Officer drops Carl at his front gate.
OFFICER EDITH
Sorry Mr. Fredricksen. You don't
seem like a public menace to me.
Take this.
She hands him a pamphlet for SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE.
OFFICER EDITH
The guys from Shady Oaks will be by
to pick you up in the morning, okay?
The officer drives off, leaving Carl alone.
Carl faces the house.
He touches Ellie's dented mailbox.
CARL
What do I do now, Ellie?
Lights are on inside the house.
MATCH DISSOLVE
TO:
A SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE van pulls up.
Nurses GEORGE and A.J. walk to Carl's door and KNOCK.
Carl answers, holding a suitcase.
CARL
Morning gentlemen.
NURSE GEORGE
Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.
You
ready to go?
CARL
Ready as I'll ever be. Would you
do me a favor and take this?
Carl hands over his suitcase.
CARL
I'll meet you at the van in just a
minute. I... want to say one last
goodbye to the old place.
NURSE GEORGE
Sure.
Take all the time you need, sir.
Carl closes the door.
Rather sharply.
The nurses head back
to the van.
24.
NURSE A.J.
Typical. He's probably going to the
bathroom for the eightieth time.
Empty helium tanks are strewn on the front lawn.
NURSE GEORGE
You'd think he'd take better care
of his house.
A SHADOW falls over the nurses.
They turn to look.
A giant tarp rises behind Carl's house.
It unfolds to reveal
THOUSANDS OF BALLOONS.
The balloons rise up like some massive multi-colored cumulus
cloud forming a thunderhead above the house.
Strings tug at the chimney. The house strains.
Pipes bend,
then break. Electrical wires spark and snap.
The house rips away from its foundation.
The nurses duck and YELL as the house soars over them.
Carl
looks out the window and LAUGHS.
CARL
So long boys! I'll send you a
postcard from Paradise Falls!
The shadow of the house drifts through an intersection.
A family watches the house float down the street.
Carl waves at a high-rise window washer, who tentatively
waves back.
The house crests the top of a building, drifting over and away
from the city. Carl looks out his window. Good riddance.
25.
Sails made from stitched-together curtains emerge from the
windows and billow in the wind. Carl steers using ropes
attached to the weather vane.
The house turns.
Carl looks out the window, satisfied.
He checks the balloons.
The house drifts through the clouds.
Nothing. He looks left.
Nothing.
He looks right.
Russell.
He looks... Russell?!!
RUSSELL
Hi, Mr. Fredricksen.
It's me,
Russell.
CARL
What are you doing out here, kid?
Russell is plastered up against the wall, terrified and
holding on for dear life.
RUSSELL
I found the snipe and I followed it
under your porch, but this snipe
had a long tail and looked more
like a large mouse.
The flag on Russell's backpack blows off and falls through
the clouds.
RUSSELL
Please let me in?
CARL
No.
Carl slams the door, leaving Russell alone.
Beat. The door opens again.
CARL
Oh, alright, you can come...
Russell runs into the house past Carl.
CARL
...in.
27.
Russell and Carl arrive at the window.
RUSSELL
That building's so close I could
almost touch it.
That gives Carl an idea.
CUT TO:
Carl lowers Russell on a rope below the floating house.
RUSSELL
Wow! This is great! You should try
this, Mr. Fredricksen! Look, there's
a bus that could take me home two
blocks away!
(looking up)
Hey, I can see your house from here!
CARL
(struggling to hold on)
Don't jerk around so much, kid!
The rope slips through Carl's hands.
Russell FALLS.
CUT TO:
Carl stands beside Russell at the window.
Russell's fall had
been a daydream.
CARL
Well, that's not gonna work.
Carl leaves Russell at the window.
RUSSELL
I know that cloud, it's a Cumulo
Nimbus. Did you know that the
Cumulo Nimbus...
Carl joins Russell at the window.
RUSSELL
See?
Cumulo Nimbus.
The storm rages.
The house is tossed into the storm clouds.
All goes black.
Carl opens the window and looks out.
CARL
Huh?
The house floats motionless above an ocean of clouds.
CARL
Can't tell where we are.
Carl and Russell watch the tiny GPS unit descend into the
clouds.
RUSSELL
Oops.
32.
A small cluster of balloons fly up and away from the house.
The house lowers into the fog.
RUSSELL (O.S.)
Whoah, that's gonna be like a
billion transfers to get back to my
house.
Carl and Russell stand on the porch as the house moves down
into and through the thick, dark clouds.
RUSSELL
Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?
CARL
Well, we're up pretty high.
Could
take hours to get down.
Something flashes by them in the fog.
Carl leans forward.
33.
CARL
(MUMBLING)
...that thing was...building or
something.
Another dark object whooshes past them.
Carl ducks.
RUSSELL
What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?
CARL
We can't be close to the ground yet.
A brief view of rocks directly below them.
Carl GASPS.
BAM!!!
The house CRASHES into the ground.
Russell and Carl fly off the porch and onto the ground.
They
land hard.
Carl's house is floating away!
Carl runs after the GARDEN HOSE dragging across the ground.
CARL
Wait, wait! No don't, don't, don't!
Carl grabs the hose and is PULLED UP in the air.
CARL
Whoah!
Hey, hey!
Russell JUMPS onto Carl's leg and the extra weight pulls them
to the ground.
CARL
Russell, hang on!
Carl and Russell slide toward the edge of a CLIFF EDGE.
RUSSELL
Whoah!
They slide toward the edge... and stop.
The drop is
thousands of feet. Carl is TERRIFIED.
CARL
Walk back!
Walk back!
34.
RUSSELL
Okay!
Russell PULLS Carl by the leg away from the cliff edge.
Carl, still hanging from the hose, looks around.
Fog blankets the mysterious landscape, revealing only
scattered rocks.
CARL
(out of breath)
Where... where are we?
RUSSELL
This doesn't look like the city or
the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.
The wind picks up and they STRUGGLE against it.
CARL
(to house)
Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.
The wind clears the fog, slowly revealing a crescent shaped,
flat-topped mountain on which they stand.
Across it, some ten miles away, is PARADISE FALLS.
Carl stares.
He can't believe it.
CARL
There it is. Ellie, it's so
beautiful.
The landscape is stunning.
Carl shows Russell the engraving with the Ellie drawing of
the house atop the falls.
CARL
We made it. We made it! Russell,
we could float right over there.
Climb up. Climb up!
RUSSELL
You mean assist you?
CARL
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
RUSSELL
Okay, I'll climb up!
Russell CLIMBS Carl, stepping on his leg, arms, and face.
35.
CARL
Watch it.
RUSSELL
Sorry.
The hose jiggles as Russell CLIMBS out of frame.
CARL
Now, when you get up there, go
ahead and hoist me up! Got it?!
Russell continues to grunt and strain off screen.
CARL
You on the porch yet?!
Russell is just inches above Carl, still STRUGGLING to climb.
He slides down onto Carl's head, exhausted.
CARL
What? That's it?! I came all this
way just to get stuck at the wrong
end of this rock pile? Aw, great!
Carl paces.
RUSSELL
Hey, if I could assist you over
there, would you sign off on my
badge?
CARL
What are you talking about?
RUSSELL
We could walk your house to the
falls!
CARL
Walk it?
RUSSELL
Yeah, after all, we weigh it down.
We could walk it right over there.
Like a parade balloon.
Carl considers this.
36.
The house floats against the sky. The hose descends from the
house and "Y"s to tie to both Carl and Russell. They wear
the hose like a harness, pulling the house as they walk.
CARL
Now, we're gonna walk to the falls
quickly and quietly, with no rap
music or flash-dancing.
Russell inspects his surroundings.
RUSSELL
(DISTRACTED)
Uh-huh.
CARL
We have three days, at best, before
the helium leaks out of those
balloons. And if we're not at the
falls when that happens...
RUSSELL
Sand!
CARL
...we're not getting to the falls!
RUSSELL
I found sand!
Carl ROLLS HIS EYES.
He looks up at the house.
CARL
Don't you worry, Ellie.
We'll get
our house over there.
Russell looks up at the house.
Who's Carl talking to?
RUSSELL
Huh.
(shrugs it off)
This is fun already, isn't it? By
the time we get there, you're gonna
feel so assisted... Oh, Mr.
Fredricksen, if we happen to get
separated, use the Wilderness
Explorer call. Caw caw, raaar!!
The WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL sets off Carl's hearing aid.
37.
RUSSELL
Wait. Why are we going to Paradise
Falls again?
CARL
Hey, let's play a game. It's
called: "See who can be quiet the
longest."
RUSSELL
Cool!
My mom loves that game!
They head toward Paradise Falls, some 10 miles away.
DISSOLVE TO:
Mist hangs ominously over a rocky landscape.
Something tall blasts through a maze of rocks.
Two dark shapes are chasing the prey.
Each has a light.
Hunters.
The prey dodges various TRAPS, one after another. A metal
cage slams shut, a hidden net, darts on a trip wire.
The prey runs into a clearing surrounded by rocks: a dead end.
The hunters surround the prey, stepping out into the light: a
sinister Doberman Pinscher, a Rottweiler, and a bulldog, each
wearing large, HIGH-TECH COLLARS.
They surround the prey.
Escape looks impossible.
WOOSH! The bird moves impossibly fast, jumping over the
three dogs and escaping in a flash.
The dogs head off in pursuit.
A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL stops the dogs short, their ears
wincing in pain. They whimper and run off.
38.
Carl steps out from behind a shrub.
The SQUEALING is in fact
his HEARING AID.
CARL
Darn thing.
(calling back)
C'mon, Russell, would you hurry it up?
Russell plods forward, dragging his feet.
RUSSELL
I'm tiiiired. And my knee hurts.
CARL
Which knee?
RUSSELL
My elbow hurts and I have to go to
the bathroom.
CARL
I asked you about that five minutes
ago!
RUSSELL
Well, I didn't have to go then!
Russell goes limp and lies face down in the dirt.
RUSSELL
I don't want to walk anymore.
Can
we stop?
CARL
Russell! If you don't hurry up,
the tigers will eat you.
RUSSELL
There's no tigers in South America.
Russell rolls over to show Carl a badge.
RUSSELL
Zoology.
CARL
Oh, for the love of Pete. Go on into
the bushes and do your business.
RUSSELL
Okay!
Here, hold my stuff.
39.
Somehow energized, Russell jams his pack into Carl's hands,
secures his rope to a tree and tromps off into the shrubs.
He goes into the woods carrying a small shovel in one hand
and a pile of leaves in another.
RUSSELL
I've always wanted to try this!
Carl waits, standing by the tree his house is tied to.
RUSSELL (O.S.)
Mr. Fredricksen? Am I supposed to
dig the hole before or after?
CARL
Eugh!
None of my concern!
Beat.
RUSSELL (O.S.)
Oh.
It's before!
Carl covers his ears.
Russell pats down a mound and SIGHS in satisfaction.
He is about to return to Carl when he spots some TRACKS.
RUSSELL
Huh?
Tracks?!
(REALIZING)
Snipe!
Russell follows the tracks into the dark jungle, clapping.
RUSSELL
Here, snipe... Come on out, snipe.
Snipe!
The footprints continue for a time, then stop.
RUSSELL
Huh.
Russell munches on a chocolate bar.
Something RUSTLES in the bushes behind him.
He turns to look.
Behind him, A BEAK takes a nibble of the chocolate and zips
out.
40.
Russell turns.
Nothing there.
Another nibble!
Zip!
RUSSELL
Ha! Gotcha!
Russell peers into the shrub.
RUSSELL
Don't be afraid, little snipe. I
am a Wilderness Explorer so I am a
friend to all of nature. Want some
more?
Russell holds out the chocolate.
The beak pokes out and
nibbles.
RUSSELL
Hi boy.
Don't eat it all.
Come on
out.
The beak zips back into the bushes.
RUSSELL
Come on. Don't be afraid little
snipe. Nice snipe. Good little
snipe. Nice...
A massive shadowy creature rises up over Russell.
RUSSELL
...giant snipe!
Carl checks the knot on his hose harness.
Russell and the
massive creature step up behind him.
RUSSELL
I found the snipe!
CARL
(humoring him)
Oh, did you?
RUSSELL
Are they tall?
CARL
Oh yes, they're very tall.
41.
RUSSELL
Do they have a lot of colors?
CARL
They do indeed.
RUSSELL
Do they like chocolate?
CARL
Oh ye-
Chocolate?
Carl turns to look.
Next to Russell stands a 13 foot tall, multicolored BIRD.
Carl SCREAMS.
CARL
What is that thing?!
RUSSELL
It's a snipe!
CARL
There's no such thing as a snipe!
RUSSELL
But you said snipes eat--
Carl grabs Russell, pulling him away from the bird.
The bird HISSES at Carl and grabs Russell back.
It cradles
Russell like a baby.
RUSSELL
Whoah!
Russell GIGGLES.
Carl pokes at the bird with his cane, trying to scare it off.
CARL
Go on, get out of here. Go on!
Shoo!
The bird HISSES.
It takes Russell up into a tree, swinging him around
playfully. It looks scary and fun.
RUSSELL
(LAUGHING)
Whoah! Whoah!
42.
CARL
Careful, Russell!
RUSSELL
(LAUGHING)
Hey, look Mr. Fredricksen, it likes
me!
CARL
Russell!
The bird grooms Russell.
RUSSELL
(LAUGHING)
No stop, that tickles!
Carl pokes the bird with his cane.
CARL
Get out of here.
Go on, git!
The bird sets Russell down.
It stalks Carl, HISSING and
ruffling its feathers.
CARL
Aaaah!
RUSSELL
Uh-oh! No no no no no Kevin, it's
okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice!
Russell pats Carl on the head.
CARL
"Kevin"?
RUSSELL
Yeah, that's his name I just gave
him.
The bird pats Carl on the head with its beak.
CARL
Hey. Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!
Carl waves his cane.
The bird eats it.
CARL
Hey!
That's mine!
The bird chokes and the cane comes back up.
43.
CARL
Aaah!
Shoo, shoo! Get out of here.
Carl shoos the bird away.
The bird mimics him.
CARL
Go on, beat it.
GRUMBLING, Carl gives up and throws his hands in the air.
The bird mimics this as well.
RUSSELL
Can we keep him? Please?? I'll
get the food for him, I'll walk
him, I'll change his newspapers...
CARL
No.
RUSSELL
(RECITING)
"An Explorer is a friend to all, be
it plants or fish or tiny mole."
CARL
That doesn't even rhyme.
RUSSELL
Yeah it does.
Russell points up to the roof of Carl's house.
RUSSELL
Hey, look!
Kevin!
CARL
What? Get down! You're not
allowed up there!
The bird is on Carl's roof. It swallows a balloon. It POPS.
The bird coughs up the deflated balloon. Russell GIGGLES.
CARL
You come down here right now!
The bird jumps down and hides behind Russell.
CARL
Sheesh!
Can you believe this, Ellie?
RUSSELL
Ellie?
(gets idea)
(MORE)
44.
RUSSELL (cont'd)
Uh, hey Ellie, could I keep the
bird? Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
(to Carl)
She said for you to let me.
CARL
(to Ellie)
But I told him no --
(catches himself)
I told you no! N-O.
The bird HISSES at Carl.
Carl and Russell pull the house through the mist.
Russell discreetly drops chocolate pieces along their trail.
The bird follows, eating.
CARL
I see you back there!
It "hides" behind a rock, still totally visible.
CARL
Go on, get out of here. Shoo! Go
annoy someone else for a while.
VOICE (O.S.)
Hey, are you okay over there?
The bird dashes away.
CARL
Uh, hello?
Carl and Russell look around. In the midst, some 100 feet
away, they see the FIGURE OF A MAN.
CARL
Oh!
Hello sir!
Thank goodness.
Carl walks toward the man.
CARL
It's nice to know someone else is
up here!
VOICE
I can smell you.
45.
Carl stops.
CARL
What?
You can smell us?
VOICE
I can smell you.
As they get closer, they realize the man is in fact a ROCK.
CARL
Hey.
Russell GIGGLES.
RUSSELL
You were talking to a rock.
Russell points to another rock shape.
RUSSELL
Hey, that one looks like a turtle!
Sure enough.
RUSSELL
Look at that one!
That one looks
like a dog!
The "rock" walks forward.
RUSSELL
It is a dog!
CARL
What?
RUSSELL
Uh, we're not allowed to have dogs
in my apartment.
The dog nuzzles Russell, who nervously pets it.
RUSSELL
Hey, I like dogs!
CARL
(calls out)
We have your dog!
(to self)
Wonder who he belongs to?
RUSSELL
Sit boy.
46.
The dog sits.
RUSSELL
Hey look, he's trained!
Shake!
The dog raises his paw and Russell shakes it.
RUSSELL
Uh-huh.
Speak.
DUG
Hi there.
Carl and Russell freeze.
CARL
Did that dog just say "Hi there?"
DUG
Oh yes.
Carl JUMPS back.
DUG
My name is Dug. I have just met
you and I love you.
Dug jumps up on to Carl.
CARL
Uh..wha?
Dug wears a high-tech collar. The dog's thoughts come out of
it as words through a speaker. It can talk. Unfortunately,
it talks non-stop.
DUG
My master made me this collar. He
is a good and smart master and he
made me this collar so that I may
talk -- SQUIRREL!!
Dug stares transfixed at a tree.
False alarm.
DUG
My master is good and smart.
CARL
It's not possible.
DUG
Oh it is, because my master is
smart.
47.
RUSSELL
Cool! What do these do, boy?
He inspects the collar and twists a dial.
DUG
Hey would you-
(CLICK)
-cuerdo con tigo-
(CLICK)
I use that collar-
(CLICK)
-watashi wa hanashi ma-
(CLICK)
-to talk with, I would be happy if
you stopped.
CARL
Russell, don't touch that. It could
be radioactive or something.
Dug sniffs the ground around Carl and Russell.
DUG
I am a great tracker. My pack sent
me on a special mission all by
myself. Have you seen a bird? I
want to find one and I have been on
the scent. I am a great tracker,
did I mention that?
BAM!
The bird tackles Dug and HISSES.
DUG
Hey, that is the bird! I have
never seen one up close but this is
the bird.
(to Carl)
May I take your bird back to camp
as my prisoner?
CARL
Yes! Take it! And on the way,
learn how to bark like a real dog!
DUG
Oh I can bark!
Dug BARKS.
DUG
And here's howling!
Dug HOWLS.
The bird HISSES at Dug.
48.
RUSSELL
Can we keep him? Please please
please?
CARL
No.
Russell falls to his knees, pleading.
RUSSELL
But it's a talking dog!
CARL
It's just a weird trick or
something. Let's get to the falls.
Carl grabs Russell.
The bird follows, as does Dug.
DUG
Please be my prisoner. Oh please oh
please be my prisoner.
Footprints.
A dog's nose follows the tracks.
This is GAMMA,
a bulldog.
GAMMA
Oh, here it is.
I picked up the
bird's scent!
A second dog: BETA, a Rottweiler.
BETA
Wait a minute, wait a minute! What
is this? Chocolate. I smell
chocolate.
GAMMA
I'm getting prunes and denture
cream! Who are they?
BETA
Ah man, Master will not be pleased.
We'd better tell him someone took
the bird, right Alpha?
ALPHA, a Doberman pinscher, sits with his back to them.
ALPHA
(high-pitched voice)
No. Soon enough the bird will be
ours yet again.
49.
Alpha's voice is high and squeaky, as if he's breathed in
helium.
ALPHA (CONT'D)
Find the scent, my compadres and
you two shall have much rewardings
from Master for the toil factor you
wage.
Beta and Gamma look at each other.
BETA
Hey Alpha, I think there's
something wrong with your collar.
You must have bumped it.
GAMMA
Yeah, your voice sounds funny!
Beta and Gamma LAUGH.
Alpha turns.
They stop laughing.
ALPHA
Beta. Gamma. Mayhaps you desire
to -- SQUIRREL!
All three dogs look for the squirrel.
False alarm.
ALPHA (CONT'D)
Mayhaps you desire to challenge the
ranking that I have been assigned
by my strength and cunning?
BETA
No no. But maybe Dug would.
You
might want to ask him.
Beta and Gamma SNICKER derisively.
GAMMA
Yeah, I wonder if he's found the
bird on his very special mission.
ALPHA
Do not mention Dug to me at this
time. His fool's errand will keep
him most occupied, most occupied
indeed. Ha ha ha. Do you not
agree with that which I am saying
to you now?
BETA
Sure, but the second Master finds
out you sent Dug out by himself,
none of us will get a treat.
50.
ALPHA
You are wise, my trusted
Lieutenant.
Alpha powers up a video screen on Beta's collar.
ALPHA (CONT'D)
This is Alpha calling Dug.
Come
in, Dug.
The screen shows ground moving past: the view from Dug's
collar.
DUG
Hi Alpha.
Hey, your voice sounds
funny.
ALPHA
I know, I know!
Have you seen the
bird?
DUG
Why yes, the bird is my prisoner
now.
GAMMA
Yeah, right.
The screen view adjusts to see the bird.
It hisses.
ALPHA
Impossible! Where are you?!
DUG
I am here with the bird and I will
bring it back and then you will
like me. Oh, gotta go.
On the collar screen, the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a
boy's face. It's Russell.
RUSSELL
(on video screen)
Hey Dug! Who you talking to?
The video screen goes blank.
The dogs BARK excitedly.
BETA
What's Dug doing?
GAMMA
Why's he with that small mailman?
51.
BETA
Where are they?
Alpha pushes a button on Beta's collar.
A TRACKING DEVICE
locates Dug.
ALPHA
There he is. Come on!
The dogs sprint off into the jungle.
The bird drags Dug, still clamped onto it's leg.
DUG
Oh please oh please oh PLEASE be my
prisoner!
RUSSELL
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!
DUG
That man there says I can take the
bird and I love that man there like
he is my master.
The bird HISSES.
CARL
I am not your master!
The bird tries to shake Dug off its leg.
Dug jumps up on it.
DUG
I am warning you, once again, bird!
RUSSELL
Hey!
Quit it!
DUG
I am jumping on you now, bird.
Russell tries to separate them, which pulls on Carl's tether.
CARL
Russell! At this rate we'll never
get to the falls!
Carl pulls on the tether, knocking Russell over.
Carl falls,
pulling the house into a tall rock. SMASH!
Carl GASPS.
He turns his anger to the group.
52.
CARL
I am nobody's master, got it?
(points to bird)
I don't want you here,
(points to Dug)
...and I don't want you here.
(points to Russell)
I'm stuck with you. And if you two
don't clear out of here by the time
I count to three-
Dug sees the tennis balls on Carl's cane.
DUG
A ball!
Oh boy oh boy!
A ball!
CARL
Ball?
Carl pops off one of the tennis balls.
CARL
You want it boy?
Huh?
Huh?
Yeah?
DUG
Oh oh oh! Yes, I do.
I do ever so
want the ball!
CARL
Go get it!!
Carl throws the ball far away.
Dug chases after it.
DUG
Oh boy, oh boy! I will get it and
then bring it back!
CARL
(WHISPERS)
Quick Russell, give me some chocolate.
RUSSELL
Why?
CARL
Just give it to me!
Carl grabs some chocolate and waves it at the bird.
CARL
Bird.
Bird!
Carl THROWS the chocolate.
The bird runs after it.
53.
Carl grabs Russell and runs.
CARL
C'mon Russell!
RUSSELL
Wait.
Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.
Carl pulls them down a slope.
He slips.
Above the tree line, the house SMASHES into a tree.
CARL
Daah!
Carl and Russell crossing the river balance on rocks.
Carl
slips and his foot goes into the water.
CARL
Aaahh...
RUSSELL
What are we doing?
Carl pushes through thick jungle leaves.
BUGS buzz around him.
Carl climbs up the hill.
He FALLS over a dead branch.
RUSSELL
Hey, uh, we're pretty far now.
Kevin's gonna miss me.
They climb over a ridge.
Dug and the bird are nowhere in sight.
Carl sits down on a rock, BREATHING HARD.
54.
CARL
I think that did the trick.
He turns.
Dug.
With the ball in his mouth.
DUG
Hi, Master.
CARL
Afternoon.
Carl turns the other way.
The bird.
It HONKS at him.
Dug drops the slobbery ball on Carl's lap.
A clap of thunder. Lightning flashes reveal rain pouring
down on the house. Beneath it, Carl and Russell are kept
dry, sitting around a pathetic flickering campfire.
Carl looks at Dug, asleep, wrapped around the bird's leg.
He
rolls his eyes and looks up at the house.
CARL
Well, thanks for keeping us dry
anyway, Ellie.
RUSSELL (O.S.)
Which one's the front?
Russell struggles to set up the tent.
He reads his manual.
RUSSELL
Is this step three, or step five?
Carl ROLLS HIS EYES at Russell's ineptness.
RUSSELL
There!
Russell struggles with a tent pole, trying to winch it into
place.
Carl can't watch.
An off screen SMACK!
Russell walks to Carl.
Miraculously,
he looks unscathed.
RUSSELL
All done.
Russell turns, revealing a large RED WELT on his face.
55.
RUSSELL
(pointing to tent)
That's for you!
The tent pole springs loose, catapulting the tent over the
cliff.
RUSSELL
Awh.
Tents are hard.
CARL
Wait, aren't you "Super Wilderness
Guy?" With the GPM's and the badges?
RUSSELL
Yeah, but... can I tell you a
secret?
CARL
No.
RUSSELL
Alright, here goes. I never
actually built a tent before.
There. I said it.
CARL
You've been camping before, haven't
you?
RUSSELL
Well, never outside.
CARL
Well, why didn't you ask your Dad
how to build a tent?
RUSSELL
I don't think he wants to talk
about this stuff.
CARL
Why don't you try him sometime?
Maybe he'll surprise you.
RUSSELL
Well, he's away a lot.
I don't see
him much.
CARL
He's got to be home sometime.
56.
RUSSELL
Well, I called, but Phyllis told me
I bug him too much.
CARL
Phyllis? You call your own mother
by her first name?
RUSSELL
Phyllis isn't my mom.
Carl realizes he put his foot in it.
CARL
Oh.
The two sit silently together, watching the fire.
RUSSELL
But he promised he'd come to my
Explorer ceremony to pin on my
Assisting the Elderly badge, so he
can show me about tents then,
right?
Carl studies Russell's sad optimism.
He looks at the missing
badge on Russell's sash.
CARL
Hey, uh, why don't you get some
sleep. Don't want to wake up the
traveling flea circus.
Dug nuzzles around the sleeping bird's leg.
RUSSELL
Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants
to take Kevin prisoner. We have to
protect him!
Russell YAWNS and lies down on the rock next to Carl.
RUSSELL
Can Kevin go with us?
CARL
Alright.
He can come.
RUSSELL
Promise you won't leave him?
CARL
Yeah.
57.
RUSSELL
Cross your heart?
Carl looks down at Russell.
CARL
Cross my heart.
Carl sits at the campfire, the others asleep.
He shakes his
head and looks up at the house.
CARL
What have I got myself into, Ellie?
DISSOLVE TO:
A frog sits next to Carl's glasses. It CROAKS. Carl's hand
smacks it like an alarm clock. The frog hops away.
Carl rises, looking up at the house.
CARL
Morning Sweetheart.
The balloons on the house are wilting.
CARL
We better get moving.
He scans the camp.
The bird is gone.
CARL
Huh. Bird's gone. Maybe Russell
won't notice.
(calls out)
Alright, everybody up!
Russell sits up with a SNORT.
RUSSELL
Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!
Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!
Dug crazily searches and sniffs, looking for the bird.
DUG
Find the bird.
Find the bird...
POINT!
Dug goes rigid like a pointer dog and "points" to the left.
58.
RUSSELL
Oh, look! There he is.
Russell points to the right.
The bird is on top of Carl's
house.
Dug turns around.
DUG
POINT!
The bird has gathered a pile of food on Carl's roof.
CARL
Hey, that's my food!
Get off my
roof!
DUG
Yeah, get off of his <>!
In the distance, BABY BIRDS call out.
The bird CALLS back.
CARL
What is it doing?
DUG
The bird is calling to her babies.
RUSSELL
Her babies! Kevin's a girl?
The bird gobbles the food and jumps off the roof.
DUG
Her house is over there in those
twisty rocks.
Miles off is a huge grouping of rocks; the LABYRINTH.
The
baby birds call from somewhere inside.
DUG
She has been gathering food for her
babies and must get back to them.
The bird "hugs" Russell goodbye and pats Carl on the head
with her beak. She HISSES at Dug.
RUSSELL
Wait, Kevin's just leaving? But
you promised to protect her!
RUSSELL
Her babies need her, we gotta make
sure they're together.
59.
The bird hurries off toward the labyrinth.
Carl gathers up
the hose tether.
CARL
Sorry Russell. We've lost enough
time already.
RUSSELL
Yeah...
The bird rounds a corner and hears rustling in the bushes
ahead. She scampers back toward the house.
Russell chews on some chocolate.
RUSSELL
This was her favorite chocolate.
Because you sent her away, there's
more for you.
Carl rolls his eyes and SIGHS.
They hear rustling from the bushes behind them.
CARL
Huh?
RUSSELL
Kevin?
Beta and Gamma, run toward Carl and Russell, viciously
barking and growling. Carl protects Russell with his cane.
Dug is conflicted.
Alpha walks forward and stares menacingly at Carl.
He turns toward Dug.
ALPHA
(high-pitched voice)
Where's the bird? You said you had
the bird.
DUG
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Since I have
said that, I can see how you would
think that.
60.
ALPHA
Where is it?
DUG
Uh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow
and then I will again have the
bird. Yes.
Alpha BARKS angrily.
ALPHA
You lost it. Why do I not have a
surprised feeling? Well, at least
you now have lead us to the small
mailman and The One Who Smells of
Prunes.
Carl and Russell look at Dug.
He turned on them!
Dug
shamefully lowers his head.
ALPHA
Master will be most pleased we have
found them, and will ask of them
many questions.
(commanding, to Carl)
Come!
CARL
Wait, we're not going with you.
We're going to the falls!
Gamma and Beta BARK fiercely at Carl.
CARL
Get away from me! Get down!
The dogs lead Carl and Russell like prisoners.
Dug follows.
The house is pulled after them, and on the roof: THE BIRD.
Alpha leads Carl and Russell through a canyon.
Dogs patrol the tops of the canyon walls.
Four more large dogs join the group.
Carl and Russell watch
warily and continue their march.
They round a bend.
Before them is a MASSIVE CAVE OPENING.
61.
The house and balloon canopy are dwarfed as the group
approaches the huge cave opening.
DOZENS OF DOGS step out of the cave. Carl and Russell stop.
More dogs approach from the side. Every way Carl turns there
are more dogs!
Growling and snarling, the dogs surround Carl and Russell.
Closer... closer...
From the darkness a voice:
VOICE (O.S.)
Stay!
The dogs stop. A figure peers out from the darkness.
It
examines Carl, Russell, and the floating house.
VOICE
You came here in that?
CARL
Uh... yeah.
VOICE
In a house? A floating house?
The man laughs.
Carl and Russell laugh along nervously.
VOICE
That is the darndest thing I've
ever seen! You're not after my
bird, are you? But if you need to
borrow a cup of sugar, I'd be happy
to oblige!
The dogs LAUGH uproariously at the man's joke.
VOICE
Well, this is all a misunderstanding.
My dogs made a mistake.
The figure walks out toward Carl into the light.
Carl
recognizes him!
CARL
Wait, are you Charles Muntz?!
MUNTZ
Well... Yes.
62.
CARL
The Charles Muntz?
Muntz gives him the "thumbs up."
MUNTZ
"Adventure is out there!"
Carl GIGGLES with glee.
CARL
It's really him!
(to Russell)
That's Charles Muntz!
RUSSELL
(EXCITED)
It is?!?
(CONSIDERS)
Who's Charles Muntz?
CARL
Him!
DOG WALLA
Yes!
It is him! He is!
CARL
I'm Carl Fredricksen. My wife and
I, we were your biggest fans!
Carl rushes to shake Muntz's hand.
Muntz is charmed.
MUNTZ
Well, you're a man of good taste!
Muntz LAUGHS at his joke.
Carl joins in.
MUNTZ
You must be tired.
Hungry?
RUSSELL
Uh-huh.
MUNTZ
(to dogs)
Attention everyone! These people
are no longer intruders. They are
our guests.
The dogs CHEER.
63.
DOG WALLA
Follow me! I like you temporarily.
You do smell like prunes. I will
not bite you.
Muntz walks into the cave. Carl and Russell excitedly follow.
Alpha, Gamma and Beta walk into the dirigible.
Dug sits
forlornly with a PLASTIC CONE around his neck.
DUG
I do not like the Cone of Shame.
The dogs close in on Russell. Alpha bites at his heels.
Carl fends off Alpha with his cane.
CARL
Get back!!
Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains
down! The dogs stop short.
Carl looks back as the bird keeps running.
Dug is up on the
canyon wall. He caused the avalanche!
DUG
Go on Master!
I will stop the
dogs!
Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs.
72.
DUG
Stop you dogs!!
The dogs run around Dug.
Alpha bites Dug by the neck and throws him out of the path.
The bird carries Carl, Russell dragging along behind.
She
rounds a corner. Russell SWINGS OUT over the abyss.
The bird jumps from rock spire to spire.
Russell swings back
and forth wildly in the air.
RUSSELL
Help! Help!
Russell does the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL.
CARL
Gimme your hand!
Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl
PULLS him back onto the bird.
Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time
to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE.
A river winds
100 feet below.
Carl looks above to see the house's momentum pulling forward.
RUSSELL
Hang on to Kevin!
Carl grabs onto Kevin and picks Dug up by the collar.
Just as the dogs reach our gang, the house's momentum carries
them across the chasm. Alpha bites the bird on the leg but
is kicked loose and falls into the river below.
Carl LANDS HARD but safely across the river chasm.
The dogs
are stuck on the other side.
Carl painfully gets up.
He looks up at his house.
It's
still intact.
He breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF.
RUSSELL (O.S.)
Kevin!
The bird tries to stand but SQUAWKS pitifully and falls back
to the ground. Russell rushes to her side.
73.
The bird's leg has been injured badly by the dog bite.
She
can't stand.
Russell applies a bandage.
From the distant labyrinth of rocks, the BIRD BABIES call.
Kevin CALLS back to them. She tries to stand, but can't.
Russell runs to her side.
RUSSELL
No no no! Kevin! Stay down.
(to Carl)
She's hurt real bad. Can't we help
her get home?
Carl looks at the bird's wounds.
He looks to the rock maze,
then to his house.
He knows the right thing to do.
And he hates himself for it.
CARL
Alright.
But we've got to hurry.
DUG'S COLLAR SCREEN powers on, and a signal zeroes in on
Dug's location.
74.
Dug, oblivious, looks out over the landscape, sniffing.
Carl and Russell peek out from behind a tree.
CARL
See anything?
DUG
No, my pack is not following us!
Boy they are dumb.
Dug scampers back to Carl and Russell, who pull the house
from behind a tree canopy.
CARL
This is crazy. I finally meet my
childhood hero and he's trying to
kill us! What a joke.
DUG
Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel
walks up to a tree and says I
forgot to store acorns for winter
and now I am dead. Ha! It is funny
because the squirrel gets dead.
They pull the house, keeping it hidden behind the trees.
CARL
Careful Russell.
The house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured BIRD on the
porch.
RUSSELL
You okay, Kevin?
Kevin goes back to sleep.
Russell looks at her BANDAGED LEG.
RUSSELL
You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?
The wilderness isn't quite what I
expected.
CARL
Yeah?
How so?
RUSSELL
It's kinda... wild. I mean, it's
not how they made it sound in my
book.
CARL
Hmm, get used to that, kid.
75.
RUSSELL
My dad made it sound so easy. He's
really good at camping, and how to
make fire from rocks and stuff. He
used to come to all my Sweatlodge
meetings.
Russell smiles at the thought.
RUSSELL
And afterwards we'd go get ice
cream at Fentons. I always get
chocolate and he gets butter-
brickle. Then we'd sit on this one
curb, right outside, and I'll count
all the blue cars and he counts all
the red ones, and whoever gets the
most, wins. I like that curb.
He looks up at Carl.
RUSSELL
That might sound boring, but I
think the boring stuff is the stuff
I remember the most.
They walk in silence.
Carl understands.
The bird babies CALL OUT in the distance.
Kevin CALLS BACK.
RUSSELL
Look, there it is!
Russell spots the labyrinth, now close by.
He tries to run
but is pulled back by his tether.
LAUGHING, Carl unclips Russell's tether.
CARL
Hold on Russell, stand still!
Carl ties the hose harnesses to a tree, securing the house.
Russell helps Kevin off the porch and the group run toward
the labyrinth entrance.
Kevin is reenergized by the sound of her babies.
She runs
off ahead. Carl and Russell LAUGH.
CARL
Look at that bird go!
CARL
Wait up, you overgrown chicken!
76.
RUSSELL
That's it, go Kevin!
Go find your
babies!
Just as they approach the entrance to the labyrinth, a fierce
spotlight hits them. MUNTZ'S DIRIGIBLE lowers overhead.
RUSSELL
Run Kevin! Run!
A net shoots out and binds her. She falls and CALLS OUT.
RUSSELL
Oh no!
The net catches on a rock. Carl and Russell run to her aid.
CARL
Russell, give me your knife!
Carl saws frantically at the net.
MUNTZ (O.S.)
Get away from my bird!
Muntz and his dogs descend from the dirigible.
Beside them,
a group of dogs drag forward CARL'S HOUSE.
Muntz hurls a lit lantern.
Flames burst up beneath the house.
Heat waves ripple up.
Balloons POP.
Carl's house LOWERS
into the fire.
CARL
No!
Carl panics.
He rushes toward the house, dropping the knife.
Muntz motions to the dogs. They swarm past Russell, knocking
him down and grabbing the bird in the net.
RUSSELL
No!
Carl pulls his house away from the flames.
77.
The bird CALLS OUT plaintively as the dogs drag her into the
dirigible.
Muntz follows the bird up the ramp of the dirigible.
MUNTZ
Careful. We want her in good shape
for my return.
RUSSELL
Let her go! Stop!
Russell runs after the dogs, but the gangplank closes.
The dirigible flies off.
RUSSELL
Kevin!
Carl beats out the flames with his jacket.
He extinguishes
the flames.
Carl collapses on the side of his house.
RUSSELL
You gave away Kevin.
You just gave
her away.
CARL
This is none of my concern.
I
didn't ask for any of this!
DUG
Master.
It's alright.
CARL
I am not your master! And if you
hadn't a shown up, none of this
would have happened! Bad dog! Bad
dog!
Dug slinks off, tail between his legs.
Carl angrily puts on the harness.
CARL
Now, whether you assist me or not,
I am going to Paradise Falls if it
kills me.
He walks off.
Russell falls in behind.
An angry dawn breaks.
78.
Now barely aloft, Carl pulls the house across the rocky
landscape.
Russell's harness drags along side, empty.
Russell walks behind.
With the last of his energy, Carl drags the house into place.
The house groans as it comes to rest.
Carl drops the hose harness and walks to the edge of a cliff.
He looks over. He's finally made it: Paradise Falls.
Torrents of water careen over the massive cliff edge.
Carl takes out Ellie's childhood drawing.
Next to him stands
the real house, just like Ellie wanted.
RUSSELL (O.S.)
Here.
Behind him, Russell throws his sash on the ground.
RUSSELL
I don't want this anymore.
Russell walks away.
He sits on a rock, alone.
Carl picks up the sash.
He walks up the steps of his house.
Carl walks from the house and calls from the porch.
CARL
Russell?
80.
But Russell is nowhere to be seen.
A shadow crosses Carl. He looks up to see Russell floating
off, hanging from a BUNCH OF BALLOONS.
CARL
Russell!
RUSSELL
I'm gonna help Kevin even if you
won't!
Russell fires up a LEAF BLOWER and steers himself off into
the sky.
CARL
No, Russell! No!
Carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift
it. He struggles, but the house doesn't budge. The balloons
have lost too much helium.
Furious, he THROWS a chair off his porch.
It lands atop the
mountain rocks with a thud.
This gives him an idea.
CUT TO:
The GRAMOPHONE smashes onto the rocky ground. Chairs,
dressers, tables; Carl throws them all out of the house.
Slowly, one corner of the house lifts.
Then another.
Carl struggles to push a refrigerator from the porch.
It
teeters... and falls. The house lifts off!
CARL
Wahhoo!
The house floats off into the sky, leaving a huge pile of
things. Beside it sits Carl and Ellie's chairs, side by side
atop Paradise Falls.
The house soars into the air, sails billowing.
The house flies off into the sky.
CARL (O.S.)
Good boy, Dug. You're a good boy!
Russell steers through the clouds toward the DIRIGIBLE.
Russell steers wobbly toward an open dirigible window.
He
smashes into the wall.
82.
RUSSELL
Ooph!
He tries again and TUMBLES through the window.
The dirigible turns, revealing Carl's house sneaking up
behind.
Carl flings the hose, HOOKING it to the ramp railing. Using
his cane as a zip line, Carl slides to Russell, catching him
just as Russell slides off the ramp edge. They land safely
together.
RUSSELL
Mr. Fredricksen!
CARL
Dug!
Bring `er over!
Dug winches in the hose caddy, pulling the house closer to
the dirigible ramp.
Carl carries Russell into the house.
Russell STRUGGLES to break free of the chair.
RUSSELL
I want to help!
He manages to get his arms free.
RUSSELL
Ha ha!
Except that all his struggling causes the chair to hop out on
the porch and fall off.
Russell SCREAMS as he falls.
The hose unspools.
Russell reaches the end of the hose. Russell grabs onto it
and the chair jostles free, falling thousands of feet down.
The house drifts away from the dirigible.
Russell clings to the end of the hose, swaying in the wind.
What's that noise?
From beneath the dirigible emerges...
From beneath the dirigible, three spitfire airplanes emerge.
As they get closer, it is clear they are being flown by DOGS.
BETA
(into radio)
Grey leader, checking in.
GAMMA
Grey 2, checking in.
OMEGA
Grey 3, checking in.
The planes fall into formation and fly toward the house.
BETA
Target sighted.
The Dog Squadron Leader bites down on a squeaky bone chew toy
that fires poison darts.
The biplanes fire and strafe Carl's house with darts.
Russell SCREAMS, swaying beneath it on the hose.
The entire dirigible rocks wildly to the side.
Carl climbs the work ladder up the side of the dirigible.
He
pushes the bird along as he goes.
Muntz follows up.
Russell TRIES TO CLIMB the hose.
His hands are about to give
out.
The biplanes head straight at Russell.
RUSSELL
(out of breath)
I can't do it!
Behind him, Carl is climbing the side of the dirigible for
dear life, Muntz closing in.
CARL
(far in the distance)
Russell!
RUSSELL
Huh?
Carl calls for help: the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL.
RUSSELL
You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!
Russell CLIMBS!
He's more machine than boy now. Biplanes shooting the whole
way, he climbs up onto the porch.
The biplanes close in.
Russell yells to them.
RUSSELL
Hey!
(pointing down)
Squirrel!
All the dog pilots snap to attention.
GAMMA
Squirrel?
OMEGA
Where's the squirrel?!
93.
The planes dive, crash into each other.
The dog pilots
parachute out.
GAMMA
I hate squirrels.
Carl climbs. Muntz grabs Carl's foot. Carl defends himself
with his cane, knocking Muntz off the ladder. Muntz catches
on to a rung of the ladder.
He watches Carl and the bird climb.
Muntz descends the ladder.
Carl and the bird make it to the top of the dirigible.
Suddenly, a trap door opens. Carl GASPS... but it's Dug!
CARL
Dug!
Dug jumps up on Carl, licking his face.
DUG
Master!
The house bears down on them.
They run to meet it.
CARL
Russell!! Over here!!
Let's go!
Russell steers the house toward Carl.
RUSSELL
Mr. Fredricksen!
The house slows and lowers atop the airship.
Carl HOISTS the
bird up onto the porch.
CARL
Come on, Kevin!
Carl helps Dug onto the porch.
He climbs up himself...
BLAM!
Muntz appears on top of the dirigible with a rifle!
A bullet blasts through Carl's balloon strings. A third of
them break or shoot skyward. The house plummets, crashing
onto the dirigible.
94.
Carl is THROWN from the house onto the airship.
The house slides toward the edge, Russell, Dug and Kevin
still inside.
CARL
No!
Carl SCRAMBLES to grab the hose trailing from the sliding
house. The house slides on to the dirigible's tail fin.
Holding the hose, Carl digs in his heels and is just able to
stop it.
The house teeters on the very edge of the tail fin.
CARL
Russell!
Get out of there!
Russell, Dug and Kevin run toward the front porch.
BLAM!
A bullet smashes the door jam next to them.
Muntz storms toward the house.
Carl holds desperately to the
hose.
CARL
No!
Leave them alone!
Russell and others duck inside and slam the door.
The house tilts, threatening to tip off at any second.
Carl
holds on for his life.
Muntz POUNDS on the door with the butt of the rifle.
The house slides farther over the edge.
Carl struggles to hold on. The hose caddy is ripping free
from the house! The bolts pop from the wooden siding... it's
about to go!
Muntz KICKS the door.
Suddenly, Carl has an idea.
CARL
Russell! Hang on to Kevin! Don't
let go of her!
CARL
Kevin!
Chocolate!
Carl holds aloft a bar of chocolate.
The hose caddy breaks free.
Kevin leaps through the window, Russell and Dug hanging from
her side.
Muntz leaps after them.
But balloon strings tangle around his leg and pull him back.
Muntz hangs for a moment... It's thousands of feet from the
ground....
He falls.
96.
PANTING, Carl is left holding the hose.
He PULLS himself
toward the edge.
The hose curves beneath the tail fin.
Finally it swings
out...
RUSSELL
That was cool!
Russell and Dug dangle from it, sitting on Kevin.
The bird
holds on to the hose with her beak.
Carl LAUGHS, relieved.
CARL
Don't jerk around so much, kid!
Russell climbs up, followed by the bird and Dug.
DUG
Oh I am ready to not be up high.
Carl LAUGHS heartily as Dug jumps on him and licks his face.
Carl looks into the distance. His house, now empty, floats
softly down into the clouds, and disappears.
RUSSELL
Sorry about your house, Mr.
Fredricksen.
Carl smiles.
He puts his arm around Russell.
CARL
You know, it's just a house.
Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin stand on the tail of the airship
floating off over the clouds.
DISSOLVE TO:
Carl and Russell hold and cuddle the baby birds.
The babies
peck at Carl's head. Carl and Russell LAUGH.
CARL
Ow! Ow! Ow!
RUSSELL
Look at you. You're so soft.
97.
Kevin CALLS OUT, waiting for the babies at the gate to the
LABYRINTH. Time to go.
CARL/RUSSELL
(DISAPPOINTED)
Awwww!
RUSSELL
I wish I could keep one.
The babies run to the bird.
One stops to HISS at Dug.
Carl has misplaced something.
CARL
Huh, where's my cane?
I just had
it here...
Kevin starts HACKING.
She COUGHS up the cane.
Babies start HACKING too.
They COUGH up tennis balls.
CARL
You know what? Keep `em.
A little
gift from me to you.
The bird family enters the labyrinth.
Carl and Russell wave.
RUSSELL
Bye Kevin!
The bird looks back toward Carl and Russell and CALLS OUT one
last time before disappearing into the mist.
Muntz's dirigible ascends into the sky. Dug and all of
MUNTZ'S DOGS stick their heads out the dirigible windows,
barking as they fly into the sunset.
DISSOLVE TO:
Carl and Russell sit on a curb licking ice cream cones.
Russell has chocolate and Carl has butter-brickle.
Cars pass by.
RUSSELL
Blue one.
CARL
Red one.
DUG
Grey one.
CARL
Red one.
100.
Russell GIGGLES.
RUSSELL
That's a bike!
CARL
It's red, isn't it?
RUSSELL
Mr. Fredricksen, you're cheating.
CARL
No, I'm not. Red one.
RUSSELL
That's a fire hydrant.
They LAUGH.
CARL
Maybe I need new glasses.
Overhead, MUNTZ'S DIRIGIBLE is parked, its ladder in the
handicapped parking spot.
DISSOLVE TO:
On top of Paradise Falls sits Carl's house, just as Ellie
imagined it.
