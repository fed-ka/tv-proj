      A hellish sight: Fiona -- ten years earlier, with long hair -- 
      beaten up and bloodied, crying, crawls over and cradles a 
      body lying in the ground. She turns the head to face her: 

      It s Adam -- savagely mauled. He looks dead. She caresses 
      him.

                                  FIONA
                    I m sorry. I m so sorry...

                    I like what you ve done for the 
                    Saudis. If you can do the same for 
                    us...  


      Fiona s alone on the roof, staring away into nothing. Jo 
      joins her.

                                  JO
                    Is it something you can talk about?

      A beat. Fiona doesn t answer.

                                  JO (cont d)
                    If we re going to do this together, 
                    I need to know what s going on.
                          (beat)
                    You ve been there, haven t you?

      Fiona takes a beat, then nods.

                                  FIONA
                    I lived there.
                          (beat)
                    I was married to a Syrian 
                      intelligence officer.

                                  JO
                    Whoa. 

                                  FIONA
                    Yeah. 

      A beat, as it sinks in with Jo.

                                  JO
                    How did that happen?

                                  FIONA
                    I was young. And stupid. 
                          (beat)
                    I was going around the Middle East 
                    in my gap year. Thought it was the 
                    cool thing to do. I studied Arab 
                      literature at college. I ended up 
                    living in Beirut, working in a 
                    hotel. It was great.
                          (beat)
                    I met him in a nightclub there. 


      Fiona and Jo.

                                  FIONA
                    I had no idea about what I was 
                    getting myself into.

                                  JO
                    I m guessing it wasn t an amicable 
                    divorce.

                                  FIONA
                    I never got that chance.
                          (beat)
                    We got married six months after we 
                    met. He wanted me to convert to 
                    Islam, which I did. I changed my 
                    name from Amelia -- my real name -- 
                    to  Amal . 
                          (beat)
                    It means hope.

                                  JO
                    It s pretty.

      Fiona smiles a bittersweet smile.

                                  JO (cont d)
                    So why did it all go pear shaped?

                                  FIONA
                    He wanted kids. A question of 
                    manhood.

                                  JO
                    And you didn t?

                                  FIONA
                    No, I wanted children. But I 
                    couldn t get pregnant -- not with 
                    him, anyway. And after a year of 
                    trying, he lost patience. I was 
                      defective, damaged goods. He moved 
                    on.                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   20.




      Jo and Fiona --

                                  FIONA
                    I thought my life was over. There 
                    was no way out. A divorce was out 
                    of the question for Farook. 
                          (beat)
                    And then I met Adam. 

                                  JO
                    Your knight in shining armour.

                                  FIONA
                    Not exactly.
                          (beat)
                    He was shadowing my husband, hoping 
                    to turn him. He thought I d be his 
                    way in. 


      Fiona, hiding under a headscarf, darts nervous glances behind 
      her before nipping into the shop --                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   21.




      Fiona and Jo.

                                  FIONA
                    ...he gave me a reason to live. 
                          (beat)
                    Until Farook found out. 


      Fiona and Jo. Fiona cringes at the memory. 

                                  FIONA
                    He almost died because of my 
                      stupidity. It s a miracle he 
                    survived. But he did. 
                          (beat)
                    And he decided to get even.


      Fiona and Jo.

                                  FIONA
                    Made it look like Farook was 
                    working for the Israelis.

                                  JO
                    How did the Syrians take it?

                                  FIONA
                    They hanged him.

      She looks at her. And walks away.


      Dusk. The cabin door of a private jet pops open as its 
      engines WHINE down. Two ARABS in white robes, Kuwaiti-style, 
      climb out. One s younger, let s call him KAREEM. The other s 
      more senior: early 50s, clean shaven, sunglasses; slick. He 
      stays back a step as a lone IMMIGRATION OFFICER is there to 
      meet them.

                                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
                    Good evening, gentlemen. Welcome to 
                    the United Kingdom. 

      Kareem hands him the three passports. The officer glances at 
      them.

      CLOSE ON THE PASSPORTS: they re KUWAITI. 

      The officer matches the pictures with the faces, not 
        particularly watchful -- these are allies. 

                                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER (cont d)
                    How long do you intend to stay in 
                    the UK?

                                  KAREEM
                    One week. Maybe a few days more.

      The officer nods, and takes out a small rubber stand from his 
      kit and stamps the first passport.

                                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
                    That shouldn t be a problem.

      As the officer stamps them, the OLDER KUWAITI looks beyond 
      him.

      HIS POV: Shalhoob s there, waiting for them by the hangar, 
      smoking. Shalhoob discretely nods his recognition.


      Fiona and Jo watch from the sidewalk as Barzali is wheeled 
      into an ambulance. 

      Ali tries to climb into the ambulance. The PARAMEDIC shakes 
      his head, moving to block him --

                                  PARAMEDIC
                    I m sorry, you can t --

      But Ali just shoves past him, climbing into the hold.

                                  ALI
                    I have diplomatic status. Don t 
                    tell me what I can or can t do. 

      The doors are shut and the ambulance TEARS off --

      Fiona and Jo watch it go, then hail a taxi and climb in, 
      unperturbed at being watched by --


      Early evening. Fiona emerges from her office block and stands 
      by the curb, looking for a taxi. Watched by --

      ACROSS THE STREET, a few cars down: Kareem and the driver, 
      watching. 

      THEIR POV: Fiona, standing there. Waiting for a cab.

      They start their engine.

      ON THE CURB

      Fiona waits. 

      CLOSE ON HER EAR -- and a tiny earplug, through which we 
      hear:

                                  ZAF (O.S.)
                    Our taxi s coming in from your 
                    left. 

      Fiona turns to face that way, and the lit taxi appears. 

      She flags it down. It pulls over, she climbs in. It drives 
      off.

      WATCHED by the Arabs.

      As it drives off, the tailing car moves to pull out from its 
      spot --


      Adam, getting back into the Obbo Van.

                                  ADAM
                    I think they ve seen enough. You 
                    know what to do.                                   SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   33.




      The Arab car is pulling out of its parking spot when ANOTHER 
      CAR rushes past, swerving to avoid it at the last minute 
      while HONKING its horn. There s a small contact -- bumpers or 
      side mirrors swiped. It s Zaf. 

      Zaf s car stops, effectively blocking the Arab s way. He 
      climbs out of his car, infuriated.

                                  ZAF
                    Oy! What s wrong with you?

      The Arab driver gets out, shouting back in Arabic, 
      gesticulating angrily, as does Kareem --

                                  KAREEM
                    YALLA! 

      -- who looks at the taxi which disappears around the corner.

      Zaf milks it a big longer --

                                  ZAF
                    You bloody idiot. I just had it 
                    resprayed last week.


      Very early. Juliet and Harry. A private conversation.

                                  HARRY
                    We re talking about sanctioning the 
                      assassination of a foreign 
                      government official. 

                                  JULIET
                    It s hardly a legitimate 
                      government. Besides, you ve seen 
                    his file. The man s psychotic. And 
                    that s just the stuff we know 
                    about. 

                                  HARRY
                    It s a slippery slope...

                                  JULIET
                    I don t like it any more than you 
                    do, Harry. But if doing this helps 
                    turn them into a democracy without 
                    having to go through a mess like 
                    Iraq...

                                  HARRY
                    We re more likely to just end up 
                    with another dictator. It s been 
                    their M.O. for fifty years.

                                  JULIET
                    If that happens, he d be a dictator 
                    we have a hold on. The odds are 
                    he ll be discovered and quartered 
                    within the week, but on the off 
                    chance he manages to stay alive...

                                  HARRY
                    How does six feel about it?

                                  JULIET
                    They ll do it if we ask them to.

                                  HARRY
                    And we re going to ask them to.

                                  JULIET
                    Not in so many words.

                                  HARRY
                    I see. The beast of deniability 
                    rears its ugly head yet again.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   41.

                                  JULIET
                    And you used to be such a charmer.
                          (beat)
                    We re all hiding under the same 
                    cloak, Harry.

                                  HARRY
                    So we re going ahead with it.

                                  JULIET
                    Subject to clearing it upstairs, 
                    yes. But with a small caveat.
                          (beat)
                    We need him to do something for us. 
                    As a gesture of good will.

                                  HARRY
                    And a bit of leverage -- just in 
                    case.

      She looks at him. They re on the same wavelength on this.


      Dusk. An old world hotel somewhere in Mayfair. Barzali walks 
      in, past the porter --                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   43.




      Late afternoon. Fiona s holding a leather briefcase for her 
      presentation. As she and Jo head towards the porter, she 
      flicks a discrete glance at --

      FIONA S POV: TWO MI5 AGENTS discretely parked around the 
      corder.

      ON FIONA -- she s on edge, uncomfortable. Sensing it.


      The MI5 team RUSH into the hotel as --

      The Syrians  car slips out of the hotel s underground 
      carpark, away from the MI5 WATCHERS --


      The car comes to a SCREECHING stop in a run down garage. 
      Kareem and Ali rush out, pop the boot open, and lift Fiona 
      out. They untie her and untape her mouth. She cringes with 
      pain. One of them throws a pair of sweats and some trainers 
      at her feet.

                                  ALI
                    Change into these. Now.

      She just stands there, defiant. He reaches for his gun and 
      chambers a round, holds it up to her face.

                                  ALI (cont d)
                    You can do it yourself. Or we can 
                    do it for you.

      She knows she doesn t have a choice. She starts to take off 
      her shirt.

                                  ALI (cont d)
                      Everything.


      Adam s car streaks past --


      Fiona s pulling on the trainers she s been given. Not exactly 
      rushing. 


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   53.

                                  ALI
                    Faster.

      She does it, and straightens up. She arranges her hair -- 

      CLOSE ON HER NECK: her fingers feel for the tracker -- only 
      its tape has peeled off. It s barely hanging from one end.

      Fiona controls her panic.


      Adam s car charges in, stops by the first car, TWO POLICE 
      CARS close behind. They all bolt out, the cops with guns 
      raised --

      Only there s no one there.

      Adam and Zaf fan out, check out the abandoned car, looking 
      around. 

                                  ADAM
                    They re gone.

      Zaf finds Fiona s clothes, thrown in a corner.

                                  ZAF
                    Adam.

      But Adam s spotted something himself. He kneels down to pick 
      it up.

      CLOSE ON HIS HAND: the discarded tape and the tracker.

      He looks up. This is not good.


      The Arabs  new car glides along, unnoticed and unchallenged.


      Adam, mind racing, on the phone, Zaf watching.

                                  ADAM
                    Ruth, find me Shalhoob. 


      Night falls as the Arabs  car drives along anonymously --


      Adam s car arrives just as Shalhoob, in an embassy car, is 
      leaving the gate --


      Adam pulls over in front of the car, blocking him --

      Adam leaps out of the car and pulls Shalhoob out of the car 
      as Zaf intercepts the driver --


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   56.

                                  SHALHOOB
                    Hey -- HEY!!!

      Adam punches Shalhoob to the ground, grabs him and KICKS DOWN 
      on his knee, SHATTERING IT backwards. Shalhoob YELLS --

                                  ADAM
                    Where is she? WHERE S MY WIFE?


      Zaf HEARS some POLICE CAR SIRENS approaching.

                                  ZAF
                    Adam...?

      Adam grabs Shalhoob and takes him in a hold --

                                  ADAM
                    I ll snap your neck right here, so 
                    help me. Where is she?

      Shalhoob looks at him, defiant --



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   57.

                                  SHALHOOB
                    You re too late.

      Adam s oblivious -- he SNAPS Shalhoob s shoulder backwards -- 
      the man SCREAMS out in huge pain as Adam pulls it again --

                                  ADAM
                    WHERE IS SHE?

                                  SHALHOOB
                      Farnborough. 

      A POLICE CAR appears and pulls over, two OFFICERS rushing 
      over to the scene of two men assaulting a diplomat --

      ZAF looks at them, back at Adam --

                                  ZAF
                    Go. I ll hold them back.

      Adam nods, darts into the car as Zaf heads towards the cops. 


      In the background, Zaf arguing with cops while Shalhoob, 
      bloodied, is on his phone.

                                  SHALHOOB
                          (Arabic, in subtitles)
                    They re married. He s her husband. 
                    He was just here.
                          (beat, scared/ashamed)
                    I had to tell him where you are.


      The car drives past a sign for  FARNBOROUGH AIRPORT  -- 


      The car drives up to the waiting jet, its engines SCREAMING --


      Adam, driving like a maniac, SIREN wailing, rushing --

                                  RUTH (O.S.)
                    Adam, GCHQ just got a hit on the 
                    voice Shalhoob was talking to.
                          (beat)
                    You re not going to like it.


      Adam s car ZIPS past the same sign announcing the airport --


      Adam s car RUSHES past the airport sign --                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   60.




      Adam gets out of the car, livid, staring up angrily at the 
      night sky. 

                                  HARRY (O.S.)
                    They couldn t shut the airport down 
                    in time. We re trying to get a 
                    couple of jets out to Brize Norton 
                    to --

                                  HARRY (O.S.)

                    I m going after her, Harry. Get me 
                    a goddam plane.


      The jet streaks into the clouds.


      Adam s rushing across the tarmac, heading for some parked 
      jets --

                                  ADAM
                    I don t care, I m doing this --                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   65.




      Adam, running --

                                  RUTH (O.S.)
                    Adam, it s Fiona. She s on the 
                    radio. I m patching her through.

      Adam stops in his tracks, hears the CLICKS --

                                  FIONA (O.S.)
                          (weak)
                    Adam?

                                  ADAM
                    Are you alright?

      INTERCUT WITH FIONA IN COCKPIT

                                  FIONA
                    No.

                    Farook s dead. So s the pilot. I m

                          (beat)
                    I m sorry...

      Adam shuts his eyes in pain.

                                  FIONA
                    I baited him, Adam. I wanted him to 
                    find me. But I couldn t tell you. 
                          (beat)
                    I didn t want to spend the rest of 
                    my life looking over my shoulder. 
                    And I didn t want us to have to re-
                    invent our lives again.
                          (beat)
                    I just wanted a normal life.

                                  ADAM
                    Why couldn t you just let it go?

                                  FIONA
                    After we left Damascus... He came 
                    looking for me... He took it out on 
                    my friends... 
                          (beat)
                    It had to be him. I knew he was 
                    still alive. And one day, he would 
                    have found us. 

                                  ADAM
                    I would have found him first.

                                  FIONA
                    That s why I couldn t tell you. He 
                    almost killed you once, because of 
                    me. I couldn t risk it again.

                                  ADAM
                    You should have told me...

                                  FIONA

                                  ADAM
                      I promise.


      ADAM s phone line goes into a dead HISS. 

      CLOSE ON HIS HAUNTED FACE

      And we FREEZE FRAME and go to white.
