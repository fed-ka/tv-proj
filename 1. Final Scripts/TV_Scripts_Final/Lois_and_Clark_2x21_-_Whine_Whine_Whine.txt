if this is sent to you in .txt, originally underlined words will 
look like   _this_

I don't know what the (X) or the * (this on "Cast" [maybe it means

Notes: 

Cover:  "Whine, Whine, Whine" Written by Kathy McCormick & John
McNamara [and] Directed by Michael Watkins are all in large bolt
print. WARNER BROTHERS TELEVISION is in an Ariel-type font. The
remainder of the text is in Courier 10 (10 characters per inch)

Notes: 
Page 11.-12, the "-12." is typed in a different font, a very last-
minute change?

Typos noted:
Page 37, first full line, at the end, "she" should be
     capitalized, isn't in original

Page 55, near bottom, descriptive phrase:  "She stops.  So 
     does she."  I suspect this should have been 
     "So does he."

   1  EXT. STREET - DAY #1                                            1   

      We're on the street outside the Daily Planet.  The street's 
      been closed off to vehicular traffic because there's a 
      street fair going on.  It's a Daily Planet-sponsored charity 
      fund raiser.  We find LOIS and CLARK at a cotton candy 
      stand.  Clark pays for two cotton candies, hands one to 
      Lois, who looks at it askance.

                                     LOIS
                     My parents wouldn't let me have
                     these.

                                     CLARK
                     Ever?  You've never had cotton
                     candy?

      They're moving now, walking slowly along the line of booths 
      and attractions.  Beyond them is a bandstand.  No musicians 
      yet; workmen are setting up the amps and the large
      instruments.

                                     LOIS
                          (quoting her father)
                     'The girl's hyperactive enough,
                     Ellen.  Don't feed her dyed                       (X)
                     sugar.'

                     get.                                              (X)

      They come into range of JIMMY.

                                     JIMMY
                     Step right up, folks.  One dollar,
                     one measly dollar to learn your
                     future.  Madame Blavatsky knows
                     all, sees all, tells all.

                                     LOIS
                          (ragging him)
                     How much of my dollar goes to
                     charity?

      From inside the tent:

                                     PERRY (O.S.)
                     Olsen!

                                     JIMMY
                     -- her voice.

                                     PERRY (O.S.)
                     Is that Lois I hear?

      PERRY, aka Madame Blavatsky, sticks his head out of the tent
      opening.  Makeup, diaphanous scarves.  He holds up one 
      hand, from which garishly colored fake fingernails dangle. 

                                     PERRY (CONT'D)
                          (to Lois)
                     How do you keep these things from 
                     falling off?  Why in thunder do you 
                     women do this to yourselves?

      He disappears back into the tent.  Lois hands her cotton 
      candy to Clark.

                                     LOIS
                     You'll be here when I come back 
                     out, right?  You're not having a 
                     sudden urge to return a video or 
                     put money in the meter or buy new 
                     shoelaces, are you?

                                     PERRY (O.S.)
                     Lois!  Get in here!

      Lois disappears into the tent to deal with the peevish 
      Madame Blavatsky's fingernails.  Clark and Jimmy gaze 
      silently at the closed tent flap, then Jimmy grabs Clark's 
      arm and gets intense:

                                     JIMMY
                          (softly)
                     This is your idea of a date?  You 
                     think Scardino takes her to silly 
                     street fairs and buys her cotton 
                     candy?

                                     CLARK
                     I don't care what Scardino does.

      DAN SCARDINO has come up behind them.

                                     DAN
                     Hi, guys.

                                     DAN (CONT'D)
                     Lois around?

      He and Clark square off.

                          (to Dan)
                     She's with me.

      Clark looks kind of silly standing there holding two cotton 
      candies.  Dan smiles.  He _likes_ competition.

                                     DAN
                     Yeah?

                                     CLARK
                     Yeah.

      They're sort of nose to nose.  At this moment Lois emerges 
      from the tent, stops on seeing them.  She looks from one to 
      the other of them.

                                     DAN
                     Like a date?

                                     CLARK
                     Yeah.  Like a date.  Where she and 
                     I are together for a certain amount 
                     of time doing stuff with each other 
                     as a couple.  Where she's with me
                     and I'm with her.

      At this unfortunate moment, we HEAR:

                                     VOICE
                          (panicky)
                     Look out!  Oh, my God!  Look out!

      They all look in the direction of:


   2  THE BANDSTAND                                                   2   

      where a huge amp, elevated above the platform, is teetering,
      about to fall to the stage below.  Directly beneath it is
      CALVIN DREGG, guitarist, a legend in his own mind.  He has
      on earphones, which are connected to his electric guitar,
      which he's tuning.  He's oblivious.


   3  WITH LOIS, CLARK AND DAN                                        3   

      Lois and Dan are looking toward-the shouting. Clark slips
      away.

      SUPERMAN whisks Calvin Dregg out of harm's way just as the
      amp crashes to the stage, right where Calvin was standing.


   5  BEHIND THE BANDSTAND                                            5   

      Superman floats down to the ground, sets Calvin down.
      Calvin seems dazed. Superman looks him over.

                                     SUPERMAN
                     I'm glad I was nearby.

      He's eager to leave, but now a woman, ELISE CARR, comes
      running up to them.  She's clearly distraught, near tears.
      Superman can't leave just yet.

                                     ELISE
                     Oh, thank you, Superman.  Oh,
                     Calvin, Calvin!  Thank God!  Are
                     you okay?

                                     SUPERMAN
                     He's a little dazed, miss, but
                     he'll be fine.

      Superman starts to leave again, but:

                                     CALVIN
                          (to Superman)
                     Fine?  Fine?!
                          (to Elise)
                     He broke my hand, Elise!  Just when
                     I get my big break in show
                     business, this baboon busts my
                     hand!
                          (to Superman)
                     Take me to the hospital right now,
                     I mean it!

      Superman blinks.  Try to be nice, what does it get you?


   6  WITH LOIS AND DAN                                               6   

      Lois and Dan are standing where we left them.  Presumably
      they've been watching the drama at the bandstand.  Now they
      turn back toward the booth.  Lois registers that Clark's not
      there.

                                     LOIS
                     Clark?

      Lois may not be pleased, but Dan is.

      Lois and Dan are sitting at a sidewalk table with the 
      remains of a fast-food meal.  They are not having fun.

                                     LOIS
                     He probably had a good reason.

                     I'm sorry, Lois, the guy just 
                     brings it out in me.  I don't 
                     understand what you see in him.

                                     LOIS
                     He's... nice.  He's kind.  He's
                     patient...

                                     DAN
                     I thought you were mad at him.

                     I'm mad at both of you.

                                     LOIS
                     Because you deliberately horned in 
                     on my date with Clark.  Because you 
                     tried to make him look bad.

                                     LOIS
                     Because you think sending gifts 
                     solves everything.  Because you 
                     won't talk to me about your work.

                                     DAN
                     Whoa, Lois, you know that's not
                     personal.

      He turns it back on Clark:

                     I want to be with you whenever I
                     can.  Can you say that about Clark
                     Kent?  I mean, he's the one you had
                     a date with.  Where is he?


   8  EXT. HOSPITAL - DUSK                                            8   

      Superman, Calvin and Elise exit the hospital.  Calvin's
      wearing a cast on his hand.  He's upset, and he's hogging
      the conversation:

                                     CALVIN
                          (at Superman)
                     I'm a musician, I'm an artist, I
                     need both my hands, what would Jimi
                     Hendrix have been with one hand?
                     I'll tell you what:  He'd have been
                     nobody, held have been nothing,
                     he'd have been --

                                     ELISE
                     Alive.  You're alive, Calvin, and
                     you're going to be fine.

      Calvin turns his whining invective on Elise.

                                     CALVIN
                     You don't understand anything!
                     You're a waitress, for God's sake!
                     You serve slabs of dead cows to fat
                     businessmen.  You wouldn't know                   (X)
                     art if it jumped up and bit your                  (X)
                     kneecap!                                          (X)

      Though Elise probably hears this crap seventeen times a day,
      it still has the power to wound.  She looks like she might
      cry.  Superman intervenes:

                                     SUPERMAN
                     People who love each other should
                     be kind to each other.

                                     CALVIN
                     What are you, a greeting card on                  (X)
                     steroids?  You fly around putting                 (X)
                     your nose into other people's                     (X)
                     business.  Who asked you?                         (X)

                                     SUPERMAN
                     I've never been sorry I saved
                     anyone's life, Mr. Dregg.  I'd hate
                     to start now.

                     I'll be okay.  Really.  And thank

  11  INT. DR. FRISKIN'S OFFICE - DAY #2                             11(X)

      The hyperactive Lois Lane is pacing back and forth in DR. 
      FRISKIN's office.

                                     LOIS
                     I want one man.  One whole man.  Is 
                     that so much to ask?  And what do I 
                     have to choose from?  There's one 
                     guy who could be really wonderful 
                     only he disappears every time I try 
                     to talk to him, and one guy who's 
                     exciting to be with only he won't 
                     talk to me about his work and what 
                     do people talk about if they can't 
                     talk about what they did all day, 
                     and one guy who's out of this 
                     world... literally.

                                     DR. FRISKIN
                     I thought you'd given up the 
                     Superman fantasy.

                                     LOIS
                     My head wants to.  My heart is, um,
                     conflicted.

                                     DR. FRISKIN
                     So it would seem.

      Lois sits.

                                     LOIS
                     Can we go over my options?

                                     DR. FRISKIN
                     Well, your current options are one 
                     wonderful guy who's apparently 
                     afraid of commitment, one exciting 
                     guy who apparently wants to control 
                     the conversation, and one superhero 
                     who's apparently unattainable.  Or 
                     it could be that none of them is 
                     right for you.

      There's silence, then:

                     habit of giving me back what I just 
                     said.

      Dr. Friskin smiles.

                                     DR. FRISKIN
                     Sometimes we can't really hear what 
                     we're saying unless someone 
                     reflects it back.

      Lois is at her desk.  She's copying some names and numbers 
      from her Rolodex when Clark comes up with two cups of 
      coffee.  He holds one out to her.  She ignores it and 
      ignores him.

      Jimmy's walking by.

                          (to Jimmy)
                     Did you hear something, Jimmy?

                     It sounded a little like my name.
                     You didn't say 'Lois,' did you?

      Uh-oh.

                                     JIMMY
                     I didn't.  Clark did.

      Jimmy looks from Lois to Clark and back again.  Nope, this 
      is not worth it.  He moves off in a hurry.

                     What?  No, don't say a word, allow 
                     me: 'Lois, I can explain, I 
                     suddenly remembered that my 
                     mother's sister's poodle needed a

                     am I doing so far, Clark?

      Without waiting for an answer, she turns her back on him and 
      dials a phone number.  From a distance, Perry watches as 
      Clark goes to his desk and sits.

      Actually, it's not Calvin's house, since Calvin has no way
      to pay rent, since Calvin is too artistically pure to take a
      job for mere money.  It's Elise's house.  Calvin is sitting
      in a chair by the window, watching TV.  He's suffering, and
      not in silence, as he scratches the itch underneath his cast
      with a long skinny stick.

      Elise comes out the front door, dressed in a waitress
      uniform.

                     majestically in the warm sun of the

                     I am, but I _have_ to go to work.

      She scurries out.  Calvin is alone with his sour expression
      and his shriveled soul.  From the TV he HEARS:

                                     BARRY BARKER (V.O.)

                     I don't see any duck here, Lois.  I
                     wanted duck.

      INTERCUT AS NEEDED.

                                     LOIS
                     I tried, Bobby.  You have to order
                     duck in advance.

      Bobby opens a carton, reacts.

                                     BOBBY
                     Ooooh, Hunan beef, I love Hunan
                     beef!

      He pops the piece into his mouth, chews ecstatically.

                     It's a figure of speech, Lois.
                     According to what I'm hearing, he's 
                     not DEA, he's FDA.

                     He's one of the people who says 
                     'yes' or 'no' to companies that 
                     want to market new drugs.

                                     LOIS
                     No. You must have the wrong
                     Scardino.

                                     BOBBY
                     If you say so.

      Lois ponders it for a moment, then:

                     It's me, Dan.

      Lois opens the door.  Dan's there, with a clipboard in one 
      hand, pencil in the other.

                                     DAN
                     Hello.  I'm doing a survey of women 
                     who resent having gifts sent to 
                     them.  Please answer 'true' or 
                     'false':  Wrapping paper offends 
                     me... I am psychologically unable 
                     to accept gifts... Gifts are okay, 
                     I just don't like the guy who sent 
                     then...

      He's being very charming, but Lois has her own agenda:

                                     LOIS
                     It's not about gifts, Dan. It's
                     about trust.

      Dan was really hoping the charm would work, but he can see
      it's a forlorn hope. He sighs.

  27  INT. LOIS'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  27   

      A few minutes later.  The TV is still on, but the sound is 
      very low.  Dan is mid-explanation:

                                     DAN
                     ... it's not just dangerous for 
                     _you_ to know what I'm doing, it's 
                     dangerous for _me_.

      Lois is entering the room with a tray: coffee and cookies.
      As she sets it down on the coffee table:

                                     LOIS
                     That's what I'm saying, Dan.  You
                     don't trust me.

      Before Dan can respond, his BEEPER GOES OFF.  He unclips it,
      looks at the number.  Lois is leaning over in front of him 
      and can see the number.

      Lois looks away from the beeper as Dan looks up.  She
      continues pouring coffee for him. Dan resumes the
      conversation:

                                     DAN
                     I think you're looking for
                     something that doesn't exist,  Lois.

                     relationship, the perfect life...
                     Will you excuse me for a minute?

      He takes a cel phone out of his pocket and walks away to get
      a little privacy.

                                     DAN (CONT'D)
                     This won't take a second.

      To his back:

                                     LOIS
                     Nirvana?

      Dan's antennae go up.  He turns.

                                     DAN
                     What?

      His reaction fuels her suspicions.

                                     LOIS
                          (innocently)
                     The perfect life.  Nirvana.  Eden.
                     Utopia.  Camelot.

      Dan relaxes.  Must've been a fluke.

                                     DAN
                          (patiently)
                     Yeah...  Those places don't exist,
                     Lois.  The real world is what we
                     have to deal with.

      And here comes the real world, Metropolis style.  Superman
      appears at the window, behind Dan.  He's holding the summons
      that Barry Barker served.  Dan sees Lois' eyes shift to the
      window, and he feels the breeze.  He turns.  Neither he nor
      Superman is pleased to see the other.

      into his cel phone.  Yes, Superman _could_ tune in his 
      superheating to overhear Dan's conversation, but he's got 
      his own problems.  Lois finishes reading the subpoena.

      Superman sits across from CONSTANCE HUNTER.  She's fortyish.
      Her office is dark -- blinds closed, sunlight struggling to 
      get in but losing the battle, a single desk lamp lit.  Lots 
      of law books, both current and old, line the walls.  
      Constance is calm and focused and kind.  She's listened
      empathetically to Superman's story, which is winding up now.

                                     SUPERMAN
                     ... His hand will heal, and since 
                     he has no job, there's no loss of 
                     income.

                     medical expenses.

                                     CONSTANCE
                     What was his response?

      Superman smiles.

                     He seems to have only one response
                     to everything:  He complained.

      Constance smiles back.

                     I know the type.  _They_ want,
                     _they_ need, _they_ deserve.
                     Nothing is ever right, and nothing 
                     is ever enough.  They stand alone 
                     at the center of the universe 
                     whining for more.  Their hunger is

                     unappeasable... I really hate them.

      There's a BEEP.  Lois hangs up, looks over to another part 
      of the room, where Perry and Jimmy are watching one of 
      several TV sets.

      we're watching Congress in session, but what we're HEARING 
      is...

                                     PFINCH-LUPUS (V.O.)
                     ... and so we see that spineless 
                     dung beetles tend toward thinly 
                     veiled power struggles, apparently 
                     having little regard for the colony 
                     as a whole...

      As we're HEARING this, we're PANNING over to Perry and Jimmy 
      to find that the voice over is coming, not from C-SPAN, but
      from The Nature Station, which they're watching.                 (X)

                     Next we go to the fascinating 
                     Andean Nettlebug, a species with 
                     three genders; male, female and the 
                     sexless drone. The drones seem to 
                     serve a matchmaking function unique 
                     in the insect kingdom, and a 
                     thankless job it is for them...

                     I need some research, Jimmy.  I

                     mates only once, with tragic
                     consequences for all concerned.
                     But the species survives and
                     thrives, and the little newly
                     hatched nettlebugs have no inkling

      For the first time we see what must've hooked Elise on the

                     And Superman didn't even apologize.

      That's it.  Clark lowers his glasses and aims his HEAT
      VISION at the TV, which sizzles, pops and dies.  Calvin is
      beside himself, and of course, he blames Elise.

      Trapped.  Trapped like a fly in a sticky web.  At this
      moment, we hear, from somewhere O.S., a faintish SQUEAL OF
      BRAKES.  Clark reacts.  If Clark Kent were capable of
      saying, "Oh, shit!!" -- now would be the time.

      returns, looks around.  The waiter hands him the note and
      moves off.  Clark looks down at it:

                     You choke 'em on paperwork, cut off 
                     their air, then go after their 
                     families, friends and when their

      Superman sits with a seasoned old PRO.

                                     PRO LAWYER
                     Superman, you're the one being 
                     exploited here and I've got an 
                     idea.  Let's sue them.  And not 
                     just them -- let's go after those 
                     guys selling Superman t-shirts and 
                     not cutting you in and the comic 
                     books, let's get you a little taste 
                     of that action.
                          (as Superman tries to
                           interrupt)
                     I know, I know, no money, right?  
                     Don't worry, the first few are on 
                     me, pro bono... if you just sign 
                     over the TV movie rights to me.

      Back to the Sharpie in a pantomiming, red-faced apoplexy:

                                     SHARPIE LAWYER
                     ... kill, kill, kill!

                                     SUPERMAN
                     I, uh, really have to... go rescue
                     someone... or something...

                                     SHARPIE LAWYER
                          (suddenly calm, checks
                           watch)
                     Oh, yeah, I'm late for yoga.
                     Listen, we'll talk soon, huh?

      Superman just nods absently and gets the hell away from this
      lunatic.


  57  EXT. COURT HOUSE - DAY                                         57   

      Superman comes out fast, takes a deep breath, moves to a 
      bench and sits, exhausted.  A LITTLE GIRL walks up.

                                     GIRL
                     You look sad, Superman.

                                     SUPERMAN
                     I'm okay.

                                     GIRL
                     Want a hug?

      He nods.  She loops her arms around his neck and gives him a 
      squeeze and a peck on the cheek.  Then --

                                     GIRL (CONT'D)
                     Don't be a Mr. Gloomy Pants.

                                     SUPERMAN
                     I'll try.

      She turns and skips off.

                                     LOIS (O.S.)
                     Careful, I might get jealous.

      He turns.  Lois is coming out of the court house.  She sits 
      next to him.

                                     SUPERMAN
                     Lois... what are you doing here?

                     Checking out this bum who's suing 
                     you.  He's got quite a record back 
                     in England.  Loved to sue people.  
                     Loved to _get_ sued so he could 
                     counter-sue.  Now I think that 
                     establishes a real pattern...

                                     SUPERMAN
                     It would if it were admissible.

                                     LOIS
                     You can't use this?  But it proves 
                     he's... he's vindictively 
                     litigious.

                                     SUPERMAN
                          (getting up)
                     Sorry, Lois.  Thanks for trying.

                                     LOIS
                     Tell me what I can do to help.

                     I'm afraid this is a battle I've
                     got to fight on my own.

                                     LOIS
                     But I --

      There's more she'd like to say but he takes off with a

      Dan steps out of the shadows, wearing a suit and tie.  A man
      appears.  Dressed in an expensive suit, with an air of 
      authority, this is CHARLES KNOX.  He carries a steel attache 
      case.

                                     DAN
                     Hi. Charles Knox, right?  Dan
                     Scardino, FDA.
                          (points to case)
                     Is that money?

      He hefts it onto a sill and snaps it open.  It's stuffed 
      tight with cash.

                                     KNOX
                     Let's talk dates.

                                     DAN
                     We hardly know each other, but
                     hell, if you're paying...

      Knox steps into Dan's face, menacing:

                                     KNOX
                     Go be Chuckles the Clown on your 
                     time; on my clock, shut your mouth.
                     Now... we want FDA approval on the 
                     drug.  We want it by the first of 
                     the year.  And we want it 
                     guaranteed.

                                     DAN
                     You got it.

      Knox walks off, leaving the case.  Dan hefts the case and 
      walks down the hall to the elevator, pushes the button, 
      waits.  Then, from behind him --

                                     LOIS
                     So this is what you didn't want me

                                     LOIS (V.O.)
                     Is that why you won't talk to me

                     Ms. Hunter, I thought I'd seen
                     every kind of evil there is...
                     every perversion of man, law and
                     God.   And I thought I knew how to
                     fight them all.  But there's
                     something out there I've never
                     really seen before and I _can't_
                     fight it because I don't understand
                     it.  Greed.  I need an ally, Ms.
                     Hunter, someone who does understand
                     it but doesn't want to be a part of
                     it... and if that's pathetic,
                     well...

      These words hit Lois hard.

                     ... so stop acting like one.  You 
                     know who you want to be with.  
                     You've known all along.  The 
                     problem is, he's just as scared as 
                     you are.  So... which one of you is 
                     going to step up and say the scary 
                     words?

                                     LOIS

                     questions?

  90  INT. COURT ROOM - DAY                                          90   

      Moments before Superman's trial.  On one side of the bar,
      Calvin and Barker; behind them, in the gallery, Elise.  On 
      the other side, Superman and Constance; behind them in the 
      gallery, Perry, Jimmy, Dan and Lois.  The room is packed, 
      dotted with PEOPLE in neck braces, slings and bandages.

                     mega-criminals and he's getting 
                     brought down by a mealy-mouthed

                     care of.  I'm a little worried 
                     about him.  Hasn't been himself 
                     lately.

      Lois tries to hide the effect of another disappointment.
      Perry leans over and whispers to Jimmy:

      Both men nod sagely and glance at Lois.  Dan, sitting beside 
      her, takes her hand.

      Sitting at the bar, Superman glances back and sees Dan 
      holding Lois's hand.  He tries not to let it hurt.  Lois 
      sees the look on his face.  Their eyes meet for a second, 
      she's curious, then... The JUDGE enters, everyone rises.


  91  INT. COURT ROOM - WITNESS STAND - LATER                        91   

      Elise on the stand, nervous, under direct exam by Barker:

                                     ELISE
                     ... and Calvin hasn't been able to use

      The Judge glances at Calvin.  Calvin slumps low in his chair 
      and shields his eyes with his hand, a mournful and forlorn 
      figure of suffering and sorrow.  Lois looks at Calvin, 
      disgusted.

  92  EXT. PARK ACROSS FROM COURT HOUSE - DAY                        92   

      Knox with a well-dressed ASSASSIN, both kneeling in front of
      an open attache case.

                                     ASSASSIN
                     It's silent, no moving parts, just
                     two globs of liquid C-12,                         (X)

                     little sucker... right under
                     Superman's nose.

      We see what's in the attache case now: a high-tech bomb.
      The Assassin closes the case and locks it.

                                     KNOX
                     Just remember, it can't look like
                     Scardino and Lane were the only

      They move out of the park, toward the court house.


  93  INT. COURT HALL - DAY                                          93   

      A break in the proceedings.  People mill.  Elise gets some
      water.  Lois walks up.

                                     LOIS
                     Can I ask you a question?  How can
                     you lie on the stand like that for
                     a man who won't even admit he's
                     married to you?

      Elise looks at her, like a deer caught in headlights.

                                     ELISE
                     How... how did you... ?

                                     LOIS
                     The kind of degradation you'll
                     tolerate in your personal life is
                     your business -- but you're ruining

                     He's about as far from perfect as 
                     you can be but I'll tell you the 
                     difference between him and
                     Calvin -- he wants my happiness 
                     more than his own.  I feel it every 
                     second I'm with him, and sometimes 
                     there aren't enough of those 
                     seconds and the ones we _do_ have 
                     end a little abruptly but Elise,
                     Calvin doesn't feel that way about
                     you and someday he'll prove it in
                     the ugliest way he can.

      Elise, stunned, moves back to court. A man bumps her from
      behind and mutters an excuse.  As he slips into the
      courtroom, we see it's the Assassin, with his attache case.

      The Assassin sets his attache in the aisle near Lois and
      Dan, twists the snap-lock and --


  95  INSERT - INSIDE THE CASE                                       95

      forms of liquid explosive. Smoke rises and curls.

                     a thousand times, why?  And the 
                     only answer I could come up with

      A hush in the courtroom.  Superman cocks his head and sniffs 
      the air, as if smelling something for the first time.

                     ... here.

      He opens it, revealing the bubbling, smoking bomb.  PEOPLE 
      jump and SCREAM, startled and terrified.

      Superman hugs the bomb to him and takes off, going straight 
      up in a whooshing BLUE AND RED BLUR.

      The sound of Superman CRASHING through the ceiling.  Plaster 
      chunks and bits of dust cascade down.  Some of it lands on 
      Calvin.  He starts to dust it off, annoyed, then a thought 
      strikes Barry Barker, who nudges Calvin, and suddenly "in 
      agony" --

      He makes a blind-man grope and tumbles over a chair.  Elise 
      and Barker kneel to him.

                     right?  Someone get a doctor!

      Then the SOUND of an ENORMOUS BLAST echoes from above.  
      Everyone looks up, frozen.

      The doors open and Superman strides in, smoke sizzling off 
      his suit, holding the charred remains of the bomb in his 
      hands.

                                     DAN

      back her hair.

                     are you running away?                             (X)

                                     CLARK
                     What are you saying?  That I                      (X)
                     should just tell her that I'm...                  (X)
                     I'm... ?

                                     MARTHA
                     I'm not saying anything.  And                     (X)
                     before we stick our noses in any
                     further --
                          (exiting with Jonathan)
                     We're going out for Chinese.


 103  INT. LOIS' APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  103   

      There's a knock at the door, she opens it and there's Dan,
      with a copy of the Planet and the headline's "OMNICORP'S
      KNOX ARRESTED".  Beneath are photos of Knox and the
      Assassin.  "Exclusive by Lois Lane."

                                     DAN
                     Congrats.

                                     LOIS
                     Dan, come on in.

      He comes in and as he does, he produces a bouquet.

                                     DAN
                     Sorry.  Couldn't help myself.

      She takes them and smiles.

      Clark is alone, on the phone.  RINGING, then the sound of
      Lois' machine picking up.  He hangs up.

                     And so what are we to learn from 
                     the mating habits of insects, 
                     reptiles and mammals?  What does it 
                     teach us about ourselves?  That 
                     we're not the only creatures on the

      She knocks.  He moves away from the drone of the TV to the
      door and opens it.

                     Hi.

                     Hi.

                          (peering in)
                     You planning a yard sale?
                          (suddenly shifts gears)
                     Wait, wait.  That's a form of
                     distancing.  My therapist -- I
                     know, I have a therapist, can you
                     believe it? -- she says I say
                     things like that to distance, so we
                     don't really have to deal with
                     anything and it's very complicated
                     and linked to a lot of boring
                     childhood trauma and... can I come
                     in?

      As she does --

                                     LOIS
                     I told Superman I just want to be
                     friends... that there's someone
                     else...  And Dan and I --                         (X)

                     This isn't just vacation packing,

                     I was thinking of moving but...                   (X)
                     now I'm not so sure.                              (X)

                     What, you were just going to slip 
                     out of town, not even tell me?  
                     Maybe send me a post card from -- ?
                          (stops)
                     Distancing, distancing.  Sorry.                   (X)
                     But this is... I mean, _leaving_, I
                     didn't expect this.

                                     CLARK
                     Lois, we haven't been very happy 
                     with each other lately.  And it's 
                     my fault and I think I should --

                                     LOIS
                     Yes, it _is_ your fault.   And my 
                     fault.  We let ourselves get 
                     distracted and we let ourselves get 
                     hurt too easily and we work too 
                     much and we argue over stupid 
                     things... all so we can hide from 
                     each other and I'm sick of it, 
                     Clark.  Because the only reason we 
                     hide is, we're scared.

                                     CLARK
                     Of what?

                                     LOIS
                     The fact that we're partners...
                     best friends... and _this_.

      She launches herself at him in a passionate kiss.  He's 
      taken aback for a moment, then returns the kiss, deeply and
      passionately.

      Lois breaks from the kiss, her lips close to his as she          (X)
      speaks:

                     tell me now.

                     I won't run, Lois.  I'm ready for
                     the next step if you are.

      They kiss again, as we MOVE TO the TV nearby and see a 
      MONTAGE of paired animals nuzzling, hugging...

                     We seek the comfort of another...
                     someone to shape and share the life
                     we choose... someone to help us 
                     through the never-ending attempt to
                     understand ourselves... and, in the

      ... and the final image: two Koala bears, side by side, 
      slumbering in one another's arms.  And then REVEAL our
