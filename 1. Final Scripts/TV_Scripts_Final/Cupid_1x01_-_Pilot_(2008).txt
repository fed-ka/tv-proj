    Two men work in the darkness. They stand on makeshift 
      scaffolding busily tying off the corners of a huge tarp. The 
      first of the men to speak, DAVE, (late 20s, laid back, 
      scruffy sexy) has an Irish (alternately, English) accent.

                                  DAVE
                    You re confident this will impress 
                    her -- not send her into witness 
                      protection?

    The second man (35, brash, confident, manic) wears a leather 
      jacket over a  Virginia is for Lovers  T-shirt. For the time 
      being, we ll call him CUPID.

                                  CUPID
                    Grand gestures, Dave. It makes them 
                    weak in the knees. Ready?

      Dave takes a deep breath, nods.

                                  CUPID (CONT D)
                    One... Two... Three...

    The two men hoist the tarp up and over a wooden ledge. They 
      regard each other. Cupid grins, jackhammers his eyebrows.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Dave and Cupid step into a blinding light. They squint as 
      their eyes adjust. They turn and regard their work. 
      Spotlights are illuminating the tarp draped over what must be 
      a billboard. A QUESTION MARK has been painted on the tarp.

                                  CUPID (CONT D)
                    Trust me. This llblow Holly s 
                    mind.

                                  DAVE
                    On that, we can agree.

      HELICOPTER SHOT starts on the two men at the base of the 
      question mark. As the SHOT GOES WIDE and opens out on the 
      million lights of Hollywood and the L.A. Basin, we realize 
      we re looking at the HOLLYWOOD SIGN. The men have covered up 
    the  W  with a giant question mark, and they ve masked the 
      final three letters with blank tarps.

    The sign now reads -- HOLLY?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Cupid and Dave climb up the scrubland toward the street.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   2.


                                  DAVE (CONT D)
                    How long you think we ve got before 
                    the cops show up?

                                  CUPID
                    Oh, I m pretty sure they ll be up 
                    there waiting for us.

      Dave stops in his tracks.

                                  DAVE
                    Excuse me?

                                  CUPID
                            (nonchalant)
                    Yeah, that s the best part. You get 
                    arrested. Then interviewed. You 
                    tell the reporter your story. You 
                    can t buy that kind of publicity.

                                  DAVE
                          (frantic)
                    Dude! I m here on an expired visa. 
                    They ll send me back to Ireland. My 
                    storywon t matter.

      Cupid strokes his chin, considers.

                                  CUPID
                    I wish you d mentioned that.

                                  DAVE
                    I wish you d brought up the getting 
                    arrestedpart earlier. I thought 
                    we d take credit in a personals ad 
                    or something.

                                  CUPID
                          (sighs, then...)
                    Fine. I ll tell your story.
                            (gazingdramatically up 
                          the hill)
                     Tis a far better thing I do than 
                    I ve ever done...

                                  DAVE
                    You sure? Because I can t...

                                  CUPID
                    Go. I ll make it happen. We re 
                    gonnafind Holly. Bank on it.

      Dave offers up his hand. Cupid shakes it. Dave heads out into 
    the darkness. Cupid continues up the hill.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   3.


      EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS STREET - NIGHT

      CAMERA PANS OFF A SQUAD CAR S CHERRYTOPtoward a spot where a 
      spotlight has illuminated a stretch of roadside. A beat later, 
      Cupid ascends into the light. He s again momentarily blinded.

                                  CUPID
                    Evening officers. Beautiful night.

    The silhouettes of two of L.A. sfinest, move toward Cupid. 
    One of the officers begins to roughly cuff him.

                                  CUPID (CONT D)
                    Hey, hey, hey!Gently, please.

    The cop who cuffed Cupid jerks his arms up, leads him back to 
    the car despite Cupid s ongoing ad-libbed protestations.

      EXT. SUNSET BLVD. SIDEWALK - NIGHT

      POVSHOT of the HOLLYWOOD SIGN which still reads  HOLLY? 

      ANGLE ON DR. CLAIRE ALLEN (35, professional, sexy) waiting on 
      a street corner. She gazes up at the Hollywood sign with an 
      amused, curious expression. The  Don t Walk  sign changes to 
       Walk,  and Claire crosses Sunset toward Border s Books. 

      INT. BORDER S BOOKS - NIGHT

      Claire moves through the store, climbs a flight of stairs.

      INT. BORDER S BOOKS 2NDFLOOR - CONTINUOUS

      Claire enters a glassed-in private room. CAMERA STAYS on a 
      sign on the door that reads,  Mondays -- Mystery Readers Book 
      Club; Tuesdays -- Dr. Claire Allen, Dating for Life. 

      INT. BORDER S BOOKS READING ROOM - NIGHT

    An eclectic group of singles are seated in furniture angled 
      toward Allen. A flannel shirt-wearing GUY S GUY has floor.

                                  GUY S GUY
                    Everyone see the Hollywood sign 
                    tonight? Someone sgot cojones.

                                    JUST-OFF-THE-BUS INGENUE
                    Out there somewhere, there s a 
                    Holly realizing -- someone loves 
                    me. It s terribly romantic. Don t 
                    you think, Dr. Allen?                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   4.


                                  CLAIRE
                    I don t know. I know most of you 
                    regulars have heard me say romance 
                    is in the eye of the beholder.I d 
                    ask myself, if I were this Holly, 
                    what kind of man have I become 
                    involved with? The sort of man who 
                    breaks the law? The sort of man who 
                    won t take no for an answer?

                                    JUST-OFF-THE-BUS INGENUE
                    I guess it s more of a fantasy.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Fantasy is overrated.

    All eyes shift to Prudence (29, Pretty by normal standards. 
      Cute by television standards.) Given the way the others 
      react, we get the sense she isn t one of the regular talkers.

                                  PRUDENCE (CONT D)
                    Sorry. It s just... I m a reporter 
                    for The Times, and I used to work 
                    the police beat. I d get these 
                    calls for violent crimes. I d show 
                    up, and almost without fail the 
                    victim and the perpetrator were 
                    lovers. Pretty soon I figured out 
                    these domestic disputes occurred in 
                    the exact moment that the fantasy
                    of what these people believed their 
                    lives together would be like 
                    crashed into reality of what their 
                    lives had become. That s why these 
                    days my goal is to find a 
                    relationship that doesn t make me 
                    crazy or inconvenienceme.

      Claire s cell phone rings. She looks annoyed, but she checks 
    it. CLOSE ON PHONE: the caller ID says  HOSPITAL. 

                                  CLAIRE (INTO PHONE)
                    What is it? I m in a meeting?

                                  DR. GREENBURG (O.S.)
                    Claire, we need you to come down 
                    here. Tonight, if possible.

                                  CLAIRE (INTO PHONE)
                    Why? McCormack s on call.

                                  DR. GREENBURG (O.S.)
                    Yeah, but you won t want to miss 
                    this one. He s right up your alley.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   5.


      INT. CEDARS-SINAI MENTAL HEALTH CENTER - NIGHT

      Claire walks with her colleague, DR. CHARLES GREENBURG (50s.) 
      Claire references a folder in her hand. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    This is the guy who changed the 
                    Hollywood sign?

                                  DR. GREENBURG
                    Not the guy; the god.

      Claire shoots Greenburg a  what the hell?  look.Greenburg 
      points further down the file. Claire reads; her eyes go wide.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Really?

      Greenburg hands over a plastic bag containing several items.

                                  DR. GREENBURG
                    No ID. That s all he had on him. 
                    Chapstick, balloons, a novelty pen,  
                    and a feather. How s the follow up 
                    to your first book coming?

                                  CLAIRE
                    It s not. I m mediating a singles 
                    group hoping that I ll find 
                    inspiration. So far, nada.I may 
                    have to return the advance money.

                                  DR. GREENBURG
                    Keep the advance, Claire. There s a 
                    best seller waiting in your office.

      INT. CEDARS-SINAI MENTAL HEALTH CENTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Cupid sits in a chair across from a desk. An orderly, ISAAC, 
      stands behind him. Claire enters, moves toward her desk.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Hello, Mr...?

                                  CUPID
                    It s Cupid.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Cupid. I m Claire Allen, one of the 
                    doctors here.

                                  CUPID
                    Then I suppose you d like me to 
                    disrobe.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   6.


      Cupid begins taking off his shirt. Isaac steps toward him, 
    but Claire shakes her head. She can handle it.

                                  CLAIRE
                    That won t be necessary. Isaac, I m 
                    fine here.

                                  ISAAC
                    I ll be just outside the door.

      Isaac gives Trevor a warning look on his way out.

                                  CUPID
                    I thought he d never leave. So, 
                    where were we? That s right! We 
                    were about to play doctor.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m going to have to ask you to 
                    refrain from that kind of innuendo.
                    I can t help you until we establish 
                    some boundaries.
                            (indicatingwho s who)
                    Doctor. Patient.

                                  CUPID
                    You want to help me? Get me out of 
                    this place. I ve got a job to do 
                    that I can t get done in here. I m 
                    supposed to be telling Dave s story 
                    to a reporter right now! How s Holly 
                    gonnaknow he s looking for her?

                                  CLAIRE
                    So this is a job? Interesting 
                    choice of words...

                                  CUPID
                      Punishment, more like it. Two 
                    hundred mortals matched. One 
                    hundred happily-ever-aftersbefore 
                    I m allowed back.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Back where?

                    Olympus.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Of course.

                                  CUPID
                    You asked.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   7.


      Claire leans back in her chair, kicks her feet up.

                                  CLAIRE
                    So this punishment..? Did you do 
                    something wrong?

                                  CUPID
                    Oh, at my expulsion, they yammered on 
                    about relearning my craft, the 
                    screwed up state of love and romance.
                    Frankly, I had trouble taking the 
                    whole thing seriously.

      Claire catches Trevor admiring her legs, she tucks them under 
    her desk as he answers the question. Trevor doesn t register 
    any embarrassment. If anything, his eyes continue to linger.

                                  CLAIRE

      Claire walks down the hall, speaks into a micro-recorder.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Four days into observation, patient 
                    presents no relief from his 
                    delusional state. I have no 
                      explanation why such high dosages of 
                      Haloperidol and Risperidonehave 
                    yielded no observable effect at all.

    As Claire walks, she spots Cupid in the REC ROOMplaying ping 
      pongwith Isaac the orderly. She pauses, backs up.

      REVEAL CLAIRE has stepped into the room behind Cupid. The 
      last bit of dialogue was delivered for her benefit.

                    believe you re an expert in the

                    I m not offended, Charles. I m just 
                    suggesting his lack of respect, his 
                    view that I am merely mortal or a 
                    woodland nymph he can charm is 
                      interfering with the therapy. It s 
                    been ten days. I m afraid I need to 
                    be more aggressive in punching 
                    holes in the delusion.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   10.


      A PLUMP NURSE steams up to Claire and Greenburg.

    All of them?*Why?*

      INT. CEDARS-SINAI MENTAL HEALTH CENTER REC ROOM - DAY

      Claire and Greenburg push into the room to discover CUPID 
      leading a cross section of male mental health patients (not 
      unlike Jack Nicholson s Cuckoo s Nestbrethren) as they 
      collectively belt out the chorus of  All You Need Is Love.

      Claire and Greenburg are momentarily speechless. Finally...

                    Have an orderly take Patient 245 to

      Claire sighs. Her patient is convincing everyone.

                    You know, those patients need more 
                    than love. Many of them need

      Claire doesn t take the bait, though she does reach across 
    the desk, take the photo from Cupid and carefully put the 
      photo back in the exact spot it was before.

                    one can deny that the man is fun.

                    Nothing wrong with fun.

      Claire takes a beat, decides whether to engage in a discussion

                    not riling up the other patients.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   14.

                    He s even quit trying to set me up 
                    with Dr. Evans.

      Claire nods. It seems that all is well.

      INT. CEDARS-SINAI MENTAL HEALTH CENTER HEARING ROOM - DAY

      A three-member mental health panel sits at a long table in 
      front of the room. Cupid sits next to Claire facing the 
      panel. He remains passive

                                  CLAIRE
                    ...he demonstrates no danger to 
                    himself or others. Given our 
                    current bed situation, I feel I can 
                    recommend this patient s release 
                    with some degree of confidence.

                                  DOCTOR 1
                    A John Doe? You still have no idea 
                    as to his true identity? No name?

                                  CUPID/TREVOR
                    It s Trevor -- Trevor Hale.

      Claire looks at her patient. The news surprises her.

                                  DOCTOR 1
                    Well, good. That eases one of my 
                    qualms. Now, does he have any 
                    money? A place to stay?

                                  CLAIRE
                    We re looking into shelters that--

                                  TREVOR
                    I ve got a place to stay. And I may 
                    still have a job.

                                  DOCTOR 1
                    Excellent. I think I can speak for 
                    the committee when I say we ll 
                    approve the release of Trevor Hale 
                    on a trial basis if you continue to 
                    monitor his progress.

                                  CLAIRE
                    But, uh...

                                  DOCTOR 1
                    To that end, we d like to receive 
                    weekly reports keeping us informed 
                    of the patient s progress.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   15.

                    My caseloadis such that...

                                  DOCTOR 1
                    If you find the patient stops 
                    making progress, he should be 
                    readmitted immediately. Thank you, 
                    Dr. Allen. Next case.

    Off Claire s weary look.

      EXT. CEDARS-SINAI MENTAL HEALTH CENTER - DAY

      Trevor exits Cedars. Claire exits a beat later, calls out.

                    Hey, ...Trevor!

      Trevor turns, stops, waits for Claire to catch up. He is in a 
      cheery mood. He s his old self. She hands Trevor a card.

                    Isaac! Marla! Have a good weekend!

      Claire turns to see Isaac and a woman who must be Marla 
      exiting the hospital hand in hand. Claire shakes her head.

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    They re going down to Laguna for

      expression that she expects this to end badly.

      EXT. HOLLYWOOD & HIGHLAND ESCALATORS - DAY

      Trevor appears at the top of the escalator as we hear the 
      sound of an acoustic guitar and a talented singer.

                                  STREET MUSICIAN (0.S.)
                    Where will I wander and wonder? 
                    Nobody knows. But wherever I m 
                    going, I ll go in search of a rose.

      EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

      ANGLE ON DAVE. He s the source of the song we ve been 
      hearing. He s singing to a couple tourists who have stopped 
    in front of his open guitar case.

                                  DAVE
                    I ll savor the softness of summer/ 
                    I ll wrap up when winter blows/ And 
                    wherever I m going, I ll go in 
                    search of a rose.

      Dave sees Trevor. He strips off his guitar and embraces him.

      INT. BEVERLY HILLS INVESTIGATIONS - DAY

      DIGGER LENARDI(40s) in a cheesy mustache and a Members Only 
      jacket leans back in a chair with his feet up on a desk.

                    I ve got the goods, ma am. I m 
                    staring at the money shot as we 
                    speak. And as soon as I receive 
                    payment, I will happily e-mail you 
                    your key to a prosperous divorce.

      ANGLE ON DIGGER S COMPUTER SCREEN. There s a photo of a man 
      (50s) in poolsiderecliner straddled by a sweet young thing.

      Claire enters the office, begins looking around uncertainly. 
      Digger raises his eyebrows at the sight of her.

                    What can I help you with, Dr. Allen?

                                  CLAIRE
                    I want to find out if there are any 
                    missing person reports for a man 
                    named Trevor Hale. If there are, 
                    I d like to find out if this is the 
                    same man.

      Claire hands Digger a picture of Trevor in patient garb.

                                  DIGGER
                    You ve come to the right place.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You see, this man is a patient of 
                    mine, and if he turns out to be 
                    Trevor Hale, I might get some 
                    insight on how best to treat him.

                          (thinking aloud)
                    I could do some additional 
                      investigating on my end. Even in 
                    cases of severe delusions, patients 
                    slip up. They mention a street they 
                    lived on or reference the snow on 
                    the ground. I mean, if he mentions 
                    snow, we could eliminate--

                                  CLAIRE
                    We ll keep each other posted on 
                    what we dig up.

                                  DIGGER
                    That can be our plan.

    Off Claire s satisfied nod. She knows what she needs to do.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   19.


      EXT. TRES EQUIS CANTINA - DAY

      Trevor enters the courtyard of TresEquis, a former adult 
      movie theater that s been converted to a Mexican-themedbar. 

      Trevor bounds up a set of exterior steps to an apartment. 
      He s surprised to find a  ROOM FOR RENT  sign in the window. 
    He tries his key. It doesn t work. Trevor heads back down the 
      stairs, moves through the courtyard. We take note of the 
      adult theater marquis which proclaims tonight  MARIACHI 
      KARAOKE NIGHT.  Trevor enters...

      Trevor heads past the bar, climbs a spiral staircase that

                    Margaret, I respect your decision. 
                    I do. All I m suggesting is that if 
                    you re going to continue to place 
                    an ad in the personals, it might be 
                    wise to mention your chastity 
                    pledge within the text.

      A QUICK PAN for reactions among the group suggests the other 
      attendees are in total agreement. The PAN lands on Trevor and 
      Dave seated together.

                    All right. It seems like we have 
                    time for one more person.

      Trevor s hand shoots up. Claire winces.

                    Trevor, maybe it would be a good 
                    idea if you just audited the first 
                    couple sessions.

                                  TREVOR
                    Not me. My buddy Dave, here.
                    He could use some help.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (relieved)
                    All right. Welcome Dave. Tell us 
                    about your love life.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   21.


                                  DAVE
                    Uh, yeah. Okay. As it turns out, 
                    I ve also been chaste, just over 
                    six months now, though, in my case, 
                      unintentionally.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m not sure what your friend told 
                    you, but we workshop long-term 
                      relationships. We re not here to 
                    facilitate hookups.

                                  DAVE
                    Oh, no. That s not what I meant to 
                    suggest. No, my problem is purely 
                    romantic. Singularly-romantic.

                                  CLAIRE
                    All right, then. I m sorry. Go on.

                                  DAVE
                    Okay... Last Christmas, I was 
                    working at my dad s pub, and this 
                    American woman comes in asking for 
                    directions to Connolly Station. We 
                    spent twenty minutes talking before 
                    she had to go catch a plane home to 
                    Los Angeles, but those twenty 
                    minutes were all it took. We had 
                    this transcendent, palpable 
                      connection. Unfortunately, all I got 
                    was her first name, Holly.

                                    JUST-OFF-THE-BUS INGENUE
                    Oh my god. You re the guy who 
                    changed the Hollywood sign!

                                  DAVE
                    Yeah, with a little help.

      Dave glances at Trevor. Suddenly the room is buzzing.

                                  TREVOR
                    So you know what Dave did? He took 
                    all his money, bought a ticket to 
                    L.A. He s been here six months, out 
                    on the streets, on a quest. So 
                    spread the word, people. You know a 
                    Holly who had a magic moment with a 
                    guy in a music store in Dublin? 
                    He s here. He s looking for her. 
                    Thatgood people, is love.

      ANGLE ON PRUDENCE, wearing a look of amused disbelief.                                                      Thomas_CUPID_031308   22.

                    I m sorry, that may be romantic, 
                    but it s not love.

                    Perhaps we can agree to call it 
                    infatuation.

                                  TREVOR
                    We can agree to disagree. What are 
                    you preaching in here? Just don t
                    do it? Reach for the copperring?

                    Love isn t smart. Love is retarded. 
                    You wanna drink from that trough? 
                    Take it from me and Captain Kirk --

                    Love at first sight is a myth. Love 
                    is built on a sturdier foundation, 
                    Trevor -- shared interests, values, 
                    aspirations. Mutual respect, 
                    friendship -- things you can t 
                    possibly establish in a couple 
                    days, let alone twenty minutes.

                                  TREVOR
                    No. Love is heat. Love is passion, 
                    chemistry, sex.

                                  CLAIRE
                    No. Love is what s left after the 
                    heat and passion fades away, and 
                    you can learn that lesson in here, 
                    or you can learn it the hard way.

                                  TREVOR
                    Wow. Who ripped out your heart?

      Claire realizes she put this too bluntly. She takes a deep 
      breath before addressing her suddenly silent group.

                                  CLAIRE
                    This is probably a good place to 
                    take break.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   23.


      Group members stand, begin milling out.

                                  TREVOR
                    An announcement, though. Tres

                    Trevor. Stay.

      Trevor nods, not offended. Claire drums her fingers on the 
      arms of her chair, waits for the crowd to disperse. Then...

      INT. TRES EQUIS CANTINA - NIGHT

      RAKING ON A SINGLES GROUP MALE and a SINGLES GROUP FEMALE. 
      They re on the bar s de facto stage performing a karaoke 
      version of Pat Benatar s,  Love is a Battlefield.  They re 
      backed by a five-piece mariachi band in full costume.

      WIDEN TO REVEAL Trevor entering. He finds a very busy Felix 
      behind the bar. Felix looks up, tosses Trevor an apron.

                    Margaritas are half price?

      Trevor catches the apron, heads behind the bar, shrugs.

                    It s L.A. They re still six bucks.

      INT. TRES EQUIS CANTINA - LATER

    TEN SINGLES GROUP MEMBERS are seated around a large table. We 
      find an urban hipster named JIMMYattempting to chat up 
      Prudence.

                    a shot. I ll take a coffee if

                    anyway. Coffee s for the lady.

      Jimmy points out Prudence with his eyes.

                    Jaded. You know the type.

      Trevor reacts. A reporter, huh?He slides the tequila shot in 
      front of Jimmy who downs it in a gulp.

                                  TREVOR
                    I ll take the coffee out to her.

      A PAIR OF SINGLESGROUPERSput the final touches on  You 
      Don t Bring Me Flowers.  The crowd cheers. The singers hand 
    off one of the micsto Lita who checks her clipboard.

      Prudence glances over at Trevor.

                    That s my cue. Sorry I can t help 
                    you.

      Prudence stands, makes her way to the stage. Trevor stews, 
      then has an idea. He hops up, heads to the restrooms.

    The men s room and supply closet doors are next to each 
      other. Trevor unspoolsthe power cord to a nearby vacuum. He 
      loops the cord between the two door handles, effectively 
      preventing either door from being opened from the inside.

    ON STAGE

      Prudence is standing self-consciously alone waiting for her

                          (female part)
                    Baby, you re not that type

      Prudence performs gamely despite the lack of a partner. 
      But...

                                  PRUDENCE (CONT D)
                    Jimmy. Wherever you are. You re a 
                    dead man.

      INT. MEN S RESTROOM - SAME TIME

      Jimmy finishes air drying his hands, reaches for the door. 
      He s perturbed when he can t seems to open it. He pulls 
      harder, then begins pounding on it.

      INT. TRES EQUIS CANTINA - NIGHT

      Prudence s had enough. She starts to put the microphone back 
    on the stand. She doesn t see the new performer take the 
      stage, until...

                                  DAVE
                    Don t go breaking my heart

      Prudence turns, discovers Dave on stage with her. She s too 
      taken aback to hit her next line. Dave picks up.

                                  DAVE (CONT D)
                    Honey, when you knocked on my door--

                                  PRUDENCE
                          (tentative)
                    Oooh, I gave you my key.

    As the song progresses, Dave s performance begins to win over 
      Prudence. His voice is dreamy. His performance is charming -- 
      just the right blend of cheeky karaoke savoir faire and 
      genuine talent. What s more, his confidence is contagious. 
      Prudence  turns it on  a bit.

    AT THE FRONT DOOR

      Claire enters. She spots Trevor standing behind the bar. A 
      voice calls her from the big singles group table.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   28.

      Claire moves to the table and takes a seat. Group members ad-
    lib enthusiastic greetings. Our REDHEADleans closer to 
      Claire, indicates Trevor behind the bar.

                                  OBLIGATORY BRASSY REDHEAD (CONT D)
                    So who s the new guy?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Oh, just a guy I know from work.

                    A doctor?

                                  CLAIRE
                    No. Just a guy.

                    No. He s not.

      Obligatory Brassy Redhead gives Claire a look. 

      ANGLE ON BATHROOM DOORS

      Jimmy forces his way out. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM out to the main 
      floor just in time for Prudence and Dave s big finish. The 
      pair hammilyclasp hands and bow like they re FleetwoodMac. 
    The crowd, with the notable exception of Jimmy, cheers 
        enthusiastically.

    AT THE BAR

      Claire approaches Trevor.

                                  TREVOR
                    Couldn t stay away from me.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I wanted to verify employment. I m 
                      responsible for you. Remember?                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   29.


                                  TREVOR
                    Likely story. What can I get you? 
                      Sex-on-the-Beach? Screaming Orgasm?

                    futon?

      Claire is at a momentary loss for words. A patron at the 
      other end of the bar waves a bill.

                                  TREVOR (CONT'D)
                    Think about it.

      Trevor wanders down the bar. Claire notices Prudence 
      loitering by the exit. She wanders over to her.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Hey. Great job up there. 

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Thanks. My partner carried me.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yeah. He was something. Can you get 
                    over his story? If you were that 
                    Holly, wouldn t you be scared to--

      Dave sidles up to Prudence, hands her a coat. Claire 
      blanches.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    Oh, hey. You two are leaving, huh?

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Yeah. We re gonnafind some place 
                    quiet. I think I m going to do a 
                    story about Dave.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (you re shittin me)
                    Wow. Yeah... Good idea.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Yeah, well. Trevor deserves the 
                    credit. It was his suggestion.

      Claire s jaw drops. Prudence and Dave ad-lib goodbyesas 
      Claire turns back to Trevor. He catches her eye, reads her 
      frustration. Off Trevor s  what s up?  shrug.

      INT. TRES EQUIS CANTINA - NIGHT

      Lita exits the TresEquisoffice, descends the staircase. She 
      furrows her brow at the sound of arguing and peers out.

      LITA S POV- Trevor stacks chairs on tables as Claire 
      lectures him. The bar is otherwise deserted.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I told you not to keep feeding 
                    Dave s fantasy.

                                  TREVOR
                    Yeah. That s my point.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (sighs, then...)
                    Look, it s one thing to proclaim 
                    you re Cupid, the god of love. It s 
                    something else entirely when you 
                    insert yourself into strangers  
                    lives, Trevor.

                                  TREVOR
                    Yeah. Thenit s called divine 
                      intervention.

      Lita s absorbs the conversation, heads back up the stairs.

      INT. TRES EQUIS CANTINA - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Lita enters and finds her brother on the phone. He looks up, 
      gives her the  one second  finger. Meanwhile...

      INT. TRES EQUIS CANTINA - NIGHT

      Claire and Trevor continue their discussion as Trevor clears 
      tables by the dart boards.

                                  TREVOR
                    What s the problem? It s not like 
                    I m telling my believers to send me 
                    their social security checks. I m 
                    finding people their soulmates.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   31.

                    Trevor, you don t havebelievers.

                                  TREVOR
                    Is that so? Then why is there a 
                    Temple of Eros down on Melrose?

                                  CLAIRE
                    They sell trashy lingerie.

                                  TREVOR
                    Of course they do! It s one of the 
                      sacraments.

                                  CLAIRE
                    What s next on the agenda for Dave? 
                    Afterthe newspaper interview.

      Trevor finds a dart on a table. He picks up a nearly-full mug 
    of Guinnessfrom the table. He faces away from the dart board. 
    He lines up the dart board in the beer s reflection.

                                  TREVOR
                    Dave claims Holly is a super fox. 
                    Tomorrow I m taking him out where the 
                    beautiful singles mingle. See if we 
                    can t track her down.

      Trevor tosses the dart over his shoulder, hits the bullseye.

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    Can you dig it?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Oh, so I suppose Tom Brady is Thor.

                                  TREVOR
                    I could ask around.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (shaking it off)
                    I m going with you tomorrow.

                                  TREVOR
                    Why?

                                  CLAIRE
                    To make sure you re  doing no harm  
                    like I promised the hospital board. 
                    Plus, I want to set up a weekly 
                    session. I ve got Fridays at 3 
                    available.
                          (off Trevor stewing)
                    Or did you want to be recommitted?                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   32.

      INT. CANTER S DELI - NIGHT

      Dave and Prudence occupy a booth. Prudence takes notes in a

                          (oncethe waitress leaves)
                    This place is exactly what America 
                    looks like in the movies. The 
                    waitresses all call me  shug  or 
                     darlin.   I quite fancy it.

                    flying off to California to track

                    My dad hadto support me. He met my

                    I m not sure which I have a harder 
                    time buying: a matchmakingfestival 
                    or a town called Lisdoonvarna.

                    Both real. Each year, after the 
                    harvest came in, single men and 
                    women of Western Ireland would show 
                    up hoping to find a spouse. These 
                    farmers  kids were so spread out, 
                    they might not have met otherwise. 
                    Back in  59, my dad was there. He 
                    spotted my mom standing outside a 
                    dress shop.

                    Yeah. Me, too.
                          (offeringup his phone)
                    There s a picture of her. She was a

                                  DAVE
                    Then I m in real trouble. First, 
                    I m absurdly uncoolmyself. It s 
                    hard to picture Steve McQueen
                    chasing a girl across the globe, 
                    isn t it? And I ve never wanted to 
                    hang out with cool people, you 
                    know. They re usually a drag.

      Prudence is charmed by Dave s answer.

      Prudence, beelines toward their table, plops down next to 
      Prudence.

                                  TREVOR
                    So I m mopping up back at the bar 
                    and I get this idea -- what if you 
                    get the newspaper to hire a sketch 
                    artist to do a composite of Dave s 
                    dream gal? Run it with the story.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   34.


                                  PRUDENCE
                    We can do that.
                          (toDave)
                    It s been six months. You think you 
                    can give a description?

                                  DAVE
                      Absolutely.

    Off Prudence, surprised to feel stung by his enthusiasm.

      INT. FELIX S BEDROOM - DAY

      Felix is sound asleep, until we hear the sound of POUNDING. 
      Felix s eyes snap open. He shakes his head unhappily. The two 
      mixed-breed dogs -- one large, one small -- in bed with him 
      perk up, whine, unhappy about the disturbance as well.

      INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Felix, wearing a robe, and trailed by the dogs, trudges 
      across the room toward the source of the noise.

      INT. TREVOR S BEDROOM - DAY

      Felix enters. He s nonplused by what he sees. Trevor is 
      standing on a chair nailing up a pool hall counter across one 
      corner of his room.

                                  FELIX
                    You don t plan on opening a pool 
                    hall in here, do you?

                                  TREVOR
                    Nope.

      Trevor steps down from the chair, drags it across the room. 
      Felix isn t quite sure what to do next. He settles on...

                                  FELIX
                    My sister heard you arguing with a 
                    woman after closing last night. The 
                    woman called you Trevor.

                                  TREVOR
                    Yeah, that was my shrink.

                                  FELIX
                          (on eggshells)
                    She said you believe you re Cupid?

                                  TREVOR
                    Yeah, it s a real bone of 
                    contention between us.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   35.


                                  FELIX
                    You told me your name was Ed Ross.

                                  TREVOR
                    No. I said my name was...
                          (drawing it out)
                    ...Eros.
                          (movingon)
                    That s what the Greeks call me. The 
                    Italians say Cupid. Take your pick.

      Trevor begins nailing the other end of the counter up.

                                  FELIX
                    I ll go with Trevor.

                                  TREVOR
                    Whatever makes you comfortable.

                                  FELIX
                    Um.I don t have much experience 
                    with mental health patients. Do you 
                    know whether your doctors would 
                    want me to play along as though the 
                    delusion is real or refuse to be 
                    engaged by it.

      Trevor slides all the beads to one end of the counter.

                                  TREVOR
                    Oh, definitely play along. Any 
                    harsher therapy should be doled out 
                    by trained professionals.

      Felix seems relieved. He indicates the pool hall counter.

                                  FELIX
                    So what s all this about?

                                  TREVOR
                    I don t get to go home...
                          (cutting off Felix off)
                    Mount Olympus -- until I match a 
                    hundred couples. This just helps 
                    keep score.

                                  FELIX
                    So...what? You get a point every 
                    time a couple you hook up, you 
                    know, rocks the casbah?

                                  TREVOR
                    I wish. Nope. It only counts if the 
                    gods decide it s...
                                  (MORE)                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   36.

                                  TREVOR (CONT'D)
                          (this is nauseating)
                    ...true love.

                                  FELIX
                    So how reyou supposed to know when 
                    that happens.

                                  TREVOR
                    I ll know.

      Trevor exits the room. We hold on Felix processing.

      INT. LOS ANGELES TIMES - DAY

      Dave looks over the shoulder of a SKETCH ARTIST.

                                  DAVE
                    Her eyes are more...playful.

    The sketch artist gives Dave a look, begins revising.

      REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS Trevor and Prudence positioned around 
      Prudence s cubicle. The newsroom itself is a hive of 
      activity.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    I m starving. Anyone else hungry?

                                  CUPID
                    I ve been trying to find a decent 
                    Greek place.

                                  PRUDENCE
                          (lighting up)
                      Yummm.Baklava...

                                  SKETCH ARTIST
                          (checking watch)
                    Aren t you meeting the photographer 
                    down at the pier in an hour?

      Both Trevor and Prudence deflate.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Damn. Should we all drive down 
                    there together?

                                  TREVOR
                          (still unhappy about this)
                    Can t. I have to meet someone 
                    first. I ll catch up though.

      Dave glances at the slide show playing on Prudence s computer 
      screen, double-takes.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   37.


                                  DAVE
                    Did I just see a picture with you, 
                    Daryl Hall and John Oatesgo by.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    That s right. Got something to say 
                    about it, Sport?

                                  DAVE
                          (shrugs helplessly)
                    Why..?

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Because they re awesome. That s 
                    why. The picture was taken at the 
                    Greek after their sold-outreunion 
                    show. They invited the web-masters 
                    of the top ten fansitesin the 
                    country to hang out backstage.

                                  TREVOR
                    There are tenHall & Oatesfans?

                                  DAVE
                      I certainly feel better about my 
                     property of the borg  boxers.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Get a life, nerd.

      Dave smiles, enjoying the give-and-take.

                                  SKETCH ARTIST
                    Something like this?

    The sketch artist reveals his work to the others.

                                  DAVE
                          (stunned)
                    That s her. That s the woman I came 
                    here to find.

                                  TREVOR
                    Let s see.

      ANGLE ON THE SKETCH. The woman is breathtaking.

      RAKING TWO SHOT on Trevor and Prudence. They re both 
      momentarily speechless.

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    That dlaunch a thousand ships.

    OFF Prudence trying her best not to reveal her disappointment.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   38.


      EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT

      Dave is beautifully framed with the lights of the Ferris 
      wheel spinning behind him as he poses with his guitar. An 
      L.A. TIMES PHOTOGRAPHERsnaps photos as Prudence observes.

                                  PHOTOGRAPHER
                    I think I got it.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Thanks, Roger.

                                  DAVE
                    I wonder where Trevor is.

      Prudence looks past Dave, lights up.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Dance DanceRevolution!

      Prudence moves past Dave affecting a zombie gate, tone.

                                  PRUDENCE (CONT D)
                    Must. Dance.

    As she passes Dave, Prudence speeds up. Dave watches her 
      curiously, bends down to put his guitar in its case.

      EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER ARCADE - MOMENTS LATER

      Dave catches up with Prudence just as she feeds quarters into 
    the DANCE DANCEREVOLUTIONVIDEO GAMEat the mouth of an 
      indoor/outdoor arcade. A 14-YEAR-OLD ASIAN BOYwaits 
      stoically next to her.

                                  DAVE
                    What are you doing?

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Teaching this youngster how we 
                    kicked it in the mid-90s.

    The video game cranks up, and Prudence and the 14-year-old 
      start dancing, stomping on the lighted dance floor in time to 
    the patterns scrolling down the screen.

      PUSH IN ON DAVE as he observes Prudence dancing with playful 
      abandon. He smiles, utterly charmed by her gusto. Prudence is 
      decent at the game. The kid next to her, though, is an ace.

                                  DAVE
                    Is it like golf? The lower the 
                    score the better?                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   39.


                                  PRUDENCE
                    Shut up.
                          (stilldancing)
                    So what happens if you find Holly, 
                    and she has a boyfriend? Or worse, 
                    what if you didn t have quite the 
                    same impact on her that she had on 
                    you?

                                  DAVE
                    I get over it eventually. Not 
                    knowing whether it was real would 
                    be worse than knowing it wasn t.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    I guess.
                          (whatthe hell...)
                    I suppose the reason I d never go 
                    on a quest like yours is because I 
                    gave up believing in happily-ever-
                      afters...this whole 19th century 
                    invention we call romantic love. 
                    Arranged marriages in the dark ages 
                    had a better chance of survival.

                                  DAVE
                    To be fair -- wives were considered 
                    property in the dark ages. Not many 
                    breakups under the circumstances.
                    ...So then, will your parents be 
                    choosing a husband for you?

                                  PRUDENCE
                    I believe in love. Just a pragmatic
                    love. It s why I started going to 
                    Dr. Allen s sessions. She gets it.

      Dave is dubious. Prudence points out a lovey-doveycouple of 
      teenagers strolling through the arcade hand in hand.

                                  PRUDENCE (CONT'D)
                    Okay, take these two... For them, 
                    love is winning a giant stuffed 
                    animal, a photo-booth make-out 
                    session, a ride on the Ferris 
                    wheel, but that s not real...

                                  DAVE
                    Couldn t tell you. I ve never been 
                    on a Ferris wheel.

      Prudence stops dancing. She can t believe it.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   40.


                                  PRUDENCE
                      Inconceivable.

                                    14-YEAR-OLD
                    Better luck next time, lady.

      Prudence turns to the kid, gives him a feisty look, then 
      shoves him off the machine. She dusts off her hands...

      EXT. PARKING LOT NEXT TO SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT

      Trevor is pacing impatiently. He hears a honk, he turns and 
      spots Claire driving up. She rolls down her window.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Sorry. Traffic.

    Off Trevor, grumbling.

      EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT

      Claire and Trevor stand in the spot where Dave was posing.

                                  TREVOR
                    Dave was supposed to be right here.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (digging for clues)
                    Don t you love amusement parks? Did 
                    you go to many as a kid?

      Trevor gives Claire a flat look.

                                  TREVOR
                    You mean when I wasn t inspiring

                    Yeah. When you weren t doing that.

                    blanketry, I ve got a good feeling 
                    about tonight.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You think maybe you and Dave might 
                    be better served by altering your 
                      expectations.

                                  TREVOR
                    Poppycock. That s mortal-think.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   41.


      EXT. SANTA MONICA FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

      Dave and Prudence ride the Ferris Wheel. They re at the very 
      top. Dave looks over the side. He appears frightened.

                                  DAVE
                    I thought these things were kiddie 
                    rides. You know, like a merry-go-
                    round tipped on its side. This is 
                      terrifying.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    You were right. You re totally 
                    uncool.

                                  DAVE
                    Yes, but, on the other hand, you ve 
                    gotta admire my keen self-awareness.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Here. We ll get through this 
                    together.

      Prudence blithely offers up her hand to hold. The two smile 
    at each other -- a fun moment. 

      CAMERA GOES CLOSE ON THEIR HANDS as they squeeze tightly. 
      Prudence s thumb rubs the back of Dave s hand.

      We re on Dave s face as he realizes what s happening. He 
      turns to Prudence and finds she s already looking him in the 
      eye. Prudence leans over, kisses Dave. For a moment Dave 
      isn t an active participant in the kiss. He s merely a 
      passenger. After a couple seconds of this, he seems to be won 
      over.

    As the kiss continues, the pair revolves to the bottom of the 
      Ferris Wheel where Claire and Trevor have been searching.

      ANGLE ON CLAIRE AND TREVOR

      Claire taps Trevor on the shoulder, points to the kissing 
      couple. Trevor deflates. 

                                  TREVOR
                    I blame you for this.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Chalk one up for mortal-think.

    Off a two shot: Trevor forlorn, Claire pleased.

                                        ACT FOUR

      EXT. THE SKY BAR - NIGHT

      Trevor, Claire and Dave are near the front of line of 
      beautiful people waiting to get into the club.

                                  TREVOR
                    So, remember, when we get inside, 
                    we re looking for the woman who 
                    inspired you to buy that one way 
                    ticket to America. Try not to trip 
                    and land with your tongue in anyone 
                    else s mouth.

                                  DAVE
                          (head still swimming)
                    Yeah, I m not quite sure how that 
                    happened. Prudence s just so easy 
                    to talk to...

                                  TREVOR
                    Focus, man.

                     Ease of communication  is one of

                                  TREVOR
                    Zip it.

                                  DAVE
                    You should see her dance. She d 
                    probably really fancy this place.

      A LARGE BOUNCER makes an announcement to everyone in line.

                                  BOUNCER
                    People! If you re not on the list, 
                    you will not get in tonight. We re 
                    having a private party. 

    As people in front of our group disperse, Trevor muscles his 
    way up to the Bouncer, indicates Dave.

                                  TREVOR
                    My buddy was here last night, and 
                    he thinks he left his credit card 
                    at the bar. Can he go in and check?

                                  BOUNCER
                    Quick like a bunny.
                          (to Trevor and Claire)
                    You two wait right here.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   43.


                                  TREVOR
                          (sotto to Dave)
                    Take a quick lap. See if she s here.

      INT. SKY BAR - MOMENTS LATER

      Dave wanders through the bar scanning the faces of patrons. 
      He s about to give up when he spots a woman in one-quarter 
      profile by the pool. His jaw drops. The woman looks like she 
      could be the one from the sketch. Dave starts moving toward 
      her. Then he does something strange: he stops.

    It appears he s not sure he wants to find out if this is his 
      dream girl. He cocks his head, weighs his options before 
      finally turning back toward camera with renewed 
      determination. He walks toward the look-alike, but before he 
      gets there, she turns fully toward Dave. It s nother. 
      Strangely, Dave appears a mix of relief and disappointment.

      EXT. SKY BAR - NIGHT

    We return to Trevor and Claire waiting for Dave.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I don t get it. You say you re on a 
                    mission to match one hundred 
                    couples. We find a man and a woman 
                      youintroduced hitting it off, 
                    kissing, and yet, you drag him away.

                                  TREVOR
                    Have you not been paying attention? 
                    I get credit for a match when it s 
                    true love, the kind of love  you d 
                    cross oceans to find.  They were 
                    very specific on that point. Romeo 
                    and Juliet counts. Romeo and the 
                    coat check girl doesn t. Got it?

      Dave emerges from the club. Trevor spots him.

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    There he is. Any luck?

      Dave shakes his head. Nada.Off Trevor s disappointment.

      INT. LOS ANGELES TIMES - NIGHT

      Prudence sits at her keyboard in her cubicle. She s staring 
    at her completed story on screen. She appears torn.

                                  FEATURES EDITOR
                    It s a human interest piece. It s 
                    not Watergate. Ten more minutes.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   44.


    The editor exits. We hold on a conflicted Prudence. She 
      turns, stares out the window at downtown Los Angeles. We note 
    the PRUDENTIAL LIFE BUILDINGin the foreground.

      INT. CEDARS-SINAI MENTAL HEALTH CENTER SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

      Claire walks down a hallway. She notices the fruit of 
      Trevor s labor -- Isaac and a Marla -- engaged in a private 
      tete-a-tete. Isaac looks unhappy. Claire regards the pair, 
      concerned. She shakes it off, keeps walking. Her phone rings.

                                  CLAIRE (INTO PHONE)
                    This is Claire.

      INT. BEVERLY HILLS INVESTIGATIONS - SAME TIME - INTERCUT

      Digger sits up in his desk, refers to his notes.

                                  DIGGER (INTO PHONE)
                    Dr. Allen. It s Digger. I think 
                    I ve got something for you. An R.T.
                    Hale from the Chicago area was 
                    reported missing a while back. 
                    Never found.

                                  CLAIRE (INTO PHONE)
                    R.T.?

                                  DIGGER (INTO PHONE)
                    Just R.T.Doesn t stand for 
                    anything. I talked to the cop who 
                    worked the case. Hale was a 
                    professor at Northwestern, and the 
                    university was investigating him 
                    for sexual misconduct. Local police 
                    assumed he threw himself off one of 
                    the bridges. They re trying to 
                    track down a photo for me.

                                  CLAIRE (INTO PHONE)
                    Thanks, Digger. Let me know. Bye.

      Claire resumes her trek down the hall engrossed in thought.

      EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOSTEL - DAY

      CAMERA HOLDS ON THE SIGN ON THE DOOR. Suddenly the door opens 
    and Dave steps out onto the street, guitar case in hand.

                                  TREVOR (O.S.)
                    Dave!

      Dave turns, discovers Trevor jogging toward him, waving the 
      L.A. Times. Trevor catches up, hands the newspaper to Dave.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   45.

                    Front page. Calendar section. 
                    Prudence came through for us.

      Dave finds the page. The story on Dave features the sketch of 
      Dave s dream girl, a photo of the altered Hollywood sign and 
      a photo of Dave on the pier with the Ferris Wheel behind him 
    and the headline: The Face that Launched A Thousand Tips.

                                  DAVE
                    This is amazing.

      A stranger walking down the sidewalk calls out to Dave.

                                  STRANGER
                    Hey, you re that guy! Good luck. 
                    Hope you find her.

                                  DAVE
                    Cheers, mate.

                                  TREVOR
                    The price of fame.

                                  DAVE
                    Gets worse. The local top-40
                    station wants me to come down for 
                    an interview before tonight s show.

                    If Holly still lives in L.A., 
                    she llbe there tonight.

                                  DAVE
                    I sure hope so, because I m a 
                    foreigner with an expired visa who 
                    just took credit for an unlawful 
                    act in a major American newspaper.

      Dave points out the photo of the HOLLY sign, winks.

      INT. CEDARS-SINAI MENTAL HEALTH CENTER OFFICE - DAY

      Claire sits at her desk holding a compact up to her face. At 
      first, we believe she s checking her reflection, but on 
      closer inspection, we see that she s eyeing a felt dartboard 
    on the wall behind her. She aims, then tosses a Velcro-tipped 
      dart over her shoulder. She fails to hit the board.

    She turns, regards several darts on the floor below the 
      board. She growls. Before she can make another attempt, her 
      iPhonerings. She regards the screen. We see from the 
      picture/text that it s  Dad  calling. It takes Claire some 
      energy to psyche herself up to take the call.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   46.

      Claire listens. A beat later all of her positivity evaporates.

                                  CLAIRE (INTO PHONE) (CONT D)
                    Oh, no. Dad. Please do not do that. 
                    It s notthe Alamo.Squatters rights

    Off Claire s frustration.

      EXT. MARINA PARKING LOT - DAY

      Claire walks hurriedly across the parking lot. She eyes a 
      SPEEDY REPOSSESSION truck and boat trailer.

      EXT. MARINA - DAY

      Claire s dad, BILL ALLEN (still dashing and charismatic at 
    60) stands on the bow of a 10-year-old sport yacht.  Note: 
      these run around $200,000 used. It s not an impressive boat 
      when one contemplates livingin it.

                                  BILL ALLEN
                    I speak as a child of God and 
                    brother to the suffering poor!
                    I speak for those whose land is 
                    being laid waste, whose homes are 
                    being pillaged, whose culture is 
                    being subverted! I speak as a 
                    citizen of the world, for the world 
                    as it stands aghast at the path we 
                    have taken!

    As Bill Allen rails against his fate, we realize there s a 
      thin line between the  crazy  Claire deals with at the 
      hospital and the  crazy  she grew up with...

      REVERSE ANGLE shows us Claire arriving and sidling up beside 
    two bewildered blue collar men wearing SPEEDY REPOSSESSION 
      shirts. They re standing on the dock watching Mr. Allen.  The 
        African-American RepoMan turns to his partner.

                                  REPOMAN
                    I swear I heard this before.

                          (interjecting)
                    It s Martin Luther King --  The 
                    Trumpet of Conscience. 

    The RepoMan nods -- sounds right. Bill notices his daughter 
    on the dock. He seems to regain some of his composure.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   47.

                    Hey there, Claire Bear. These 
                    gentleman are trying to take my 
                    home, my castle.

                                  CLAIRE
                    It s a boat, Dad.
                          (tothe repomen)
                    Can I write you a check for the 
                    missed payments?

    Off Claire s hopeful, pleading expression.

      INT. CEDARS-SINAI MENTAL HEALTH CENTER OFFICE - DAY

      Claire is on the phone dealing with her finances.

                                  CLAIRE
                    No. Just move the money from 
                    savings into checking... I don t 
                    know. I ll think of something.

    As Claire hangs up, Trevor knocks and enters in one motion.

                                  TREVOR
                    GutenTag, herrDoktor.Let s make

                    Why, yes, it is. Very good. During 
                    our next session, we ll work on 
                    days of the week.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I raced back here, so I could be on 
                    time for our 3 o clock appointment.

                                  TREVOR
                    That s because you rea responsible 
                    adult.

                                  CLAIRE
                    And what s wrong with that? Isn t 
                    that a good thing? Did someone 
                    decide that responsibility was a 
                    quality possessed solely by nerds 
                    and losers?

                          (gettingworked up)
                    Why is it that irresponsible people 
                    are always the heroes. They get to 
                    be the dreamers, the visionaries, 
                    the romantics. But if you re 
                      responsibleyou re a killjoy.

                                  TREVOR
                    I didn t make the rules.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I ll let you in on a secret. It s 
                    that responsible  killjoy  who ends 
                    up making the boat payments...who 
                    makes sure the dreamer she loves 
                    takes his medication. It s the 
                      responsible one who ends up with 
                    400 HDDVD players in storage shed 
                    in Van Nuysand five percent share 
                    in a revolving restaurant downtown. 
                    It s the responsible one who has to 
                    say,  No, dad. You did not win the 
                    Canadian Lottery. 
                          (emphatically)
                    Can you dig it?

      Trevor takes a long considerate beat. Then...

                                  TREVOR
                    How much are you asking for those 
                      HD-DVDplayers?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Let s take a walk. I could use the 
                    fresh air. Plus, there s a love 
                    story I want to share with you.

                                  TREVOR
                    I d prefer a courtroom thriller. 
                    I m up to my nards in love.

      Claire simply points toward the door.

      EXT. PACIFIC DESIGN CENTER PLAZA - DAY

      Trevor and Claire walk and talk, coffee cups in hand.

                                  CLAIRE
                    The story is about a scholar -- a 
                    university professor. He falls in 
                    love with one of his students.

                                  TREVOR
                    Old story.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   49.


                                  CLAIRE
                    He falls madlyin love with her. 
                    She reciprocates. But the semester 
                    ends. For her it was a passing 
                    fling. For him it was much more.

                                  TREVOR
                    Like I said -- old story.

                                  CLAIRE
                    But it doesn t end there. He can t 
                    stop thinking about her. He stalks 
                    her, leaves drunken messages on her 
                    machine. She reports him to the 
                      university. He resigns in disgrace. 
                    He snaps. He has to get as far away 
                    from her as possible. He changes 
                    his identity. Eventually he can t 
                    even remember who he is. He tells 
                    people he s the god of love.

                                  TREVOR
                    Okay. Not bad. But I ve got a 
                    better one. Let s take your 
                    professor. This time, let s say 
                    he s a real ass hound. Always 
                    seducing the co-eds.Then, 
                      unexpectedly, he falls for one of 
                    his peers -- another professor. 
                    He s head over heels. This morally 
                    bankrupt man finally finds someone 
                    who turns him into the man he was 
                    supposed to be.

      Claire is rapt. She thinks she s hearing Trevor s real story.

                                  CLAIRE
                    And then?

                                  TREVOR
                    Then some jealous co-edhe tossed 
                    away the year before makes it her 
                    mission to spoil his happiness. She 
                    tells the new woman about the girls 
                    he s seduced. Provides names, 
                    numbers. The professor s lover can t 
                    take it. She wants to escape, to 
                    sleep until it doesn t hurt any more. 
                    She s got some pills. She figures the 
                    more she takes, the longer she 
                    sleeps. Our Prince Charming finds her 
                    in bed, but no matter how many times 
                    he kisses her, she won t wake up.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   50.


      There s a long beat as Trevor reflects on the story. Claire s 
      heart goes out to the man in front of her.

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    Poetic justice? Or is it irony?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Trevor, I know I can help you.

                                  TREVOR
                    I m not sure about your ending, 
                    either. A tad hackneyed. Instead of 
                    the insanity thing, let s say he

                    Trevor, Marla dumped Isaac today. 
                    There was a big scene here at the 
                    hospital. You have no magic. You 
                    aren t a god.

                                  TREVOR
                          (exasperated, weary)
                    No bow. No arrow. I ve explained 
                    that. I can t make you believe me. 
                    After tonight, I ll have my first 
                    match, and I ll be that much closer 
                    to going home and getting out of 
                    your hair forever.

      INT. CEDARS-SINAI MENTAL HEALTH CENTER OFFICE - LATER

      Trevor is gone. Claire opens her laptop. She clicks on a word-
      processing program, opens a title page. She types.

      CLOSE ON SCREEN: IN SEARCH OF CUPID: A CASE STUDY.

      INT. TRES EQUIS CANTINA - OFFICE - NIGHT

    The music cue fades as we find Felix tending to his books. He 
      wears a concerned expression. There s a KNOCK and Lita pokes 
    her head in. Felix looks up.

                                  LITA
                    You should come look at this.

      INT. TRES EQUIS CANTINA - NIGHT

      Felix descends the stairs, turns a corner, his eyes go wide.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   51.


    THE BAR IS PACKED. It s wall-to-wall humanity. We catch a 
      glimpse of Dave on stage tuning his guitar. Felix is 
      thunderstruck. Trevor calls out to him from behind the bar.

                                  TREVOR
                    Yo! Boss! Little help?

      Felix turns to Lita. They share a smile. They needed this 
      kind of night badly.

      INT. TRES EQUIS CANTINA - LATER

    The packed house applauds as Dave wraps up a version of the 
      Turtles   Happy Together. 

      Dave glances out into the crowd, smiles. CAMERA FINDS the 
      person he smiled at -- Prudence. She s seated next to Claire 
    at a small table enjoying the show. Claire observes the 
      smitten way Prudence watches Dave s performance. She smiles.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (knowingly)
                    You look awfully nice.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Am I being stupid? He s in love 
                    with someone else.

      Claire gives a supportive smile.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You re being proactive. That s 
                    chapter one of my book.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    A few days ago I felt sorry for the 
                    girl on the Hollywood sign. Now I m 
                    jealous of her.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Don t be. He s only in love with 
                    the ideaof someone else.

                                  DAVE
                    I learned a new song especially for 
                    this night. It goes out to someone 
                    who is spectacularly uncool.And 
                    that s what I dig about her.

      Dave starts playing guitar. Prudence shakes it off, turns her 
      attention back to Dave who is performing the Hall & Oates
      standard,  You Make My Dreams Come True.                                                      Thomas_CUPID_031308   52.


                                  DAVE (SINGING) (CONT D)
                    What I ve got s full stock of 
                    thoughts and dreams that scatter. 
                    You pull them together. And how, I 
                    can t explain. You make my dreams 
                    come true. Hoohoo.Hoohoo.

      Prudence is smiling wide. Most of the patrons of the bar have 
      started singing along, so we don t immediately notice when 
      Dave stops playing. Prudence notices, though. We re on 
      Prudence as she realizes what s happened.

      PRUDENCE SPOV- Dave has stopped playing. He looks like he s 
      seen a ghost. And there she is - the DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS WOMAN
    who inspired him to come to America. She s made it to a table 
      just a few feet from the stage and Dave has spotted her.

      ANGLE ON TREVOR AT THE BAR as he realizes what s happening.

      ANGLE ON CLAIRE as she sees it, too.

    The audience -- now without any accompaniment -- begins 
      cluing in. They ve all read the story. Someone starts 
      applauding. Others join in. Dave steps down from the stage. 
    The mystery woman stands. The two come together.

                                  DAVE (CONT D)
                    Holly. I knew I d find you.

      Dave embraces the mystery woman. Trevor is thrilled. He 
      glances over, notices Prudence walking sadly toward the door. 
      Trevor moves to catch her.

                                  TREVOR
                    Prudence. Don t go. This is it. 
                    You ve got your story.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    I didn t want to be the girl who 
                    got the story this time, Trevor. I 
                    wanted to be the girl who got the 
                    song.
                          (holdingup thumb and 
                            forefinger)
                    I came thisclose.

      Prudence takes one look back at Dave hugging his mystery 
      woman. She forces a wan smile and exits.

      INT. TREVOR S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      CLOSE ON TREVOR s CONCERNED FACE. We hold on this tight shot 
    as his eyes scan from side to side. He grunts unhappily.

                                  TREVOR
                    Huh.

      REVEAL TREVOR s POV.The pool bead counter. All the beads are 
      still lined up on one end.

      INT. CANTER S DELI - NIGHT

      Trevor enters the diner, spots Dave and Holly in a booth. He 
      approaches the table. Dave sees him and lights up.

                                  DAVE
                    Trevor this is Holly. Holly, this 
                    is a friend of mine, Trevor. He s 
                    the person responsible for twisting 
                    the fabric of space and time and 
                    bringing us back together.

      Holly is beautiful, friendly enough, supremely self-
      confident, and ever-so-slightly hipper-than-thou.

                                  HOLLY
                    A regular Cupid, huh?

      Trevor shakes Holly s hand and sits down next to her.

                                  TREVOR
                    No such thing.

        A WAITRESSapproaches, sets down cappuccinos. Holly sips hers 
    as the waitress serves Dave.

                                  HOLLY
                    Uh. I asked for non-fat.

                                  WAITRESS
                    It is, honey. I made it myself.

      Holly grimaces in an I-hate-to-be-a-pain way.

                                    HOLLY
                    Maybe the container was mis-labeled.

    The waitress glances at Dave who says nothing. She picks up 
      Holly s cup, heads away from the table. Holly addresses Dave.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   54.

                    I have so much to teach you. This 
                    place used to be theafter-hours hot 
                    spot -- it had this whole Reservoir 
                    Dogsvibe, you know, like real
                    people came here -- but then 
                    everyone sort of remembered,  what s 
                    so great about real people? 

                                  DAVE
                    I don t know...I m kind of a fan of 
                    real people.

                                  HOLLY
                    Oh, yeah, we all are. That didn t 
                    come out right. I grew up around 
                      salt-of-the-earth folk -- god love 
                     em -- but I came to L.A. forthe 
                    bright lights. If you moved to 
                    Paris in the  30s, you d wanna hang 
                    out with Cole Porter, Henry Miller, 
                    right? Not Jean QPublique.

      Trevor regards Dave. He can tell from the look in Dave s eye 
      that this relationship is never going to work.

      INT. TRES EQUIS CANTINA - DAY

      Lita watches over his shoulder as Felix stands at the cash 
      register counting the take from the previous night. They re 
      both euphoric. Lita is the first to notice Trevor entering. 
    She squeals, her attitude toward him muchimproved. 

                                  LITA
                    Trevor!

                    I need to ask you guys a favor...or

    Off Trevor s nod.The plan is in motion.

      INT. CEDARS-SINAI MENTAL HEALTH CENTER HEARING ROOM - DAY

      Claire stands in the back of the room in which Trevor s 
      release was approved. Another psychiatrist addresses the same 
      trio of doctors we ve seen before. Claire glances up 
      momentarily and something catches her attention. Engraved in 
    the marble above the doctors is an epitaph...

    THE WORLD FELT A TREMOR
    AND DOWN CAME THE HAIL

      CLOSE ON THE FINAL TWO WORDS -- TREMOR, HAIL. Claire shakes 
    her head, allows a smirk. Her cell phone rings. She answers.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Hello?

      INT. TRES EQUIS CANTINA - INTERCUT

      Trevor is on the pay phone.

                                  TREVOR
                    Hey. It s your favorite patient.

                          (shaking it off)
                    Uh... Yeah. Listen, I ve been up 
                    all night brainstorming. As much as 
                    I hate to ask, I need you. What do 
                    you say? Help me OB-1-Claire-nobi.
                    You re our only hope.

                    What dyou have in mind?

      INT. LOS ANGELES TIMES - NIGHT

      Prudence returns to her cubicle wearing a dour expression. 
      She s surprised to see Trevor waiting there for her.

                                  TREVOR
                    Baklava. You and me. I did some 
                      investigating. I know where we can 
                    find the best baklava in the great 
                    state of California. You with me?

      Prudence isn t in the mood, but it requires less energy to go 
      along with the plan than to resist. She picks up her purse.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   56.


                                  PRUDENCE
                    What the hell. I m done here.

      EXT. DISNEYHALL - NIGHT

      Trevor and Prudence walk past the Frank Gehrymasterpiece.

                                  TREVOR
                    ...to understand the history of 
                    baklava is to understand the 
                    history of Cyprus, which is to say, 
                    the narrative of the Greek/Turkish 
                      conflict...

      INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

      Trevor and Prudence ride in the elevator with others.

                                  TREVOR
                    ...some heretics will try to 
                    convince you syrup is an authentic 
                    topping. Humbug. Me? Give me honey.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    I appreciate what you re trying to 
                    do. It s really sweet of you to 
                    check in on me, but I m not sure 
                    I m going to be very good company.

                                  TREVOR
                    That s okay. I ll be great company.

      Prudence manages a grateful smile.

      INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

      Trevor and Prudence sit across from each other in candlelight  
      browsing their respective menus. The view of the downtown 
      skyscrapers surrounding them is breathtaking. 

                                  PRUDENCE
                    I don t even see baklava on the 
                    menu.

                                  TREVOR
                    I think you must have to special 
                    order it.

      Prudence looks out the window, cocks her head.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Are we moving?                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   57.


                                  TREVOR
                    Yeah, it s one of those restaurants 
                    that spins.

      Prudence glances down, sees the seem in the floor. The outer 
      ring of tables is revolving around an inner ring.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    Huh... I didn t know these even 
                    existed anymore--

      Prudence stops talking abruptly as she hears the sound of an 
      acoustic guitar being strummed. She turns her head in the 
      direction of the sound.

      Trevor and Prudence s table is essentially moving toward the 
      restaurant bar. There on a small stage is Dave backed by the 
      TresEquishouse band. Dave is already looking Prudence in 
    the eye as he begins singing the first line of the song.

                                  DAVE (SINGING)
                    I ve been so many places in my life 
                    and time. I ve sung a lot of songs. 
                    I ve made some bad rhymes. I ve 
                    acted out my love on stages with 
                    ten thousand people watching, but 
                    we re alone now, and I m singing 
                    this song for you.

      ANGLE ON PRUDENCE. Her jaw has dropped. She s unsure how to 
      respond. Trevor reaches over and taps her on the hand. 
      Prudence regards Trevor who points out the window.

        PRUDENCE SPOV.The restaurant has rotated enough that the 
      PRUDENTIAL LIFE BUILDING has come into view. The sign on the 
    top no longer reads  PRUDENTIAL LIFE,  however.

    The sign now reads  PRUDENCE 4 LIFE. 

      TIGHT ON PRUDENCEas she tries vainly to choke back tears, 
    and yet she seems frozen in her seat as Dave begins to spin 
    by. She looks at Trevor imploringly.

                                  TREVOR
                    Ask yourself...what would Captain 
                    Kirk do?

      Prudence grins, then bolts out of her seat and rushes toward 
      Dave. Dave rips off his guitar. The two embrace and begin 
      kissing to the surprise of the restaurant s patrons. Though 
    the singing has stopped, the mariachi band continues to play. 
    The violin takes over the melody line.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   58.


      CAMERA FINDS CLAIRE sitting at the bar. She also finds herself 
      a bit misty-eyed. She glances over, sees Trevor savoring the 
      moment. She regards him for a moment. He turns and catches her 
      eye. Off Trevor and Claire sharing a satisfied look.

      EXT. PRUDENTIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

    The song continues to play as CAMERA FINDS Felix and Lita 
      admiring their own handiwork. They have managed to use tarps 
    to cover the appropriate letters.

                                  CLAIRE (O.S.)
                    If I hadn t seen it with my own eyes, 
                    I doubt I would ve believed it.

      INT. PRUDENCE S BEDROOM - DAY

      Dave and Prudence kiss. They unbutton and unfasten each 
      other s clothing. They make the cat collar hanging from the 
      bedpost jingle. The images are sweet, romantic, sexy. 

                                  CLAIRE (O.S.)
                    Certainly there was no magic bow 
                    and arrow, but Trevor created a 
                    romantic scenario that witnesses 
                    would almost universally first 
                    think to describe as  magical. 

      Prudence and Dave roll off the bed in hysterics.

      INT. CLAIRE S OFFICE - DAY

      Claire walks around her office speaking into a headset.

                                  CLAIRE
                    My casebooksare full of stories 
                    about soldiers who have seen so 
                    much blood and suffering on the 
                      battlefield that the only way they 
                    can cope is to convince themselves 
                    they re Jesus Christ -- the prince 
                    of peace.

      ANGLE ON HER LAPTOP as voice recognition software types in 
      everything Claire dictates.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    In many cases, the delusion 
                    actually protects these patients  
                    fragile minds. I believe my mystery 
                    patient who calls himself Trevor 
                    Hale has experienced no less a 
                    tragedy.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   59.

                    The key to dispelling the delusion, 
                    I believe, is to learn the cause 
                    and then to treat the heartbreak. 
                    Of course to learn the cause, I 
                    must learn the patient s identity 
                    with little to go on beyond a...

      Claire reaches into her desk drawer, pulls out the plastic 
    bag containing Trevor s effects.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    ...pink feather, a tube of cherry 
                    chapstick, a novelty stripper pen 
                    and a trio of party balloons...

      Claire looks more closely at the balloons. Something catches 
    her eye. She holds a balloon up to her eye, then, surprises 
    us by blowing into it. She ties it off, regards the balloon.

      TIGHT ON THE HEART-SHAPED BALLOON:  Fete Accompli Party 
      Supplies -- Olympia, WA. 

      Claire stares at the balloon, intrigued. She dials her cell.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    Hey, Mr. Lenardi... Yes, Digger. 
                    You can forget about RTHale in 
                    Chicago. I ve got a new lead. Can 
                    you find out if the man in the 
                    photo I gave you went missing from 
                    Olympia, Washington?

    Off Claire, a bit more hopeful than before.

      EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY

      Dave, wearing a look of supreme bliss, strides down the 
      sidewalk, turns into the HOLLYWOOD HOSTEL.

      INT. HOLLYWOOD HOSTEL - CONTINUOUS

      Dave passes through the lobby, but he s stopped by two men in 
      suits before he gets very far.

                                  MAN IN SUIT
                    Dave Linehan?I m agent Morris with 
                    the INS. I m afraid we re going to

      INT. TRES EQUIS CANTINA - AFTERNOON

      Trevor enters in a cheery mood. He moves behind the bar, puts 
    on an apron. Felix appears, and Trevor looks up.

                                  TREVOR
                    Hey, boss. What s the good word?

                                  FELIX
                    That singer, Dave, called hoping 
                    you were around. I guess the INS 
                    caught up to him. They put him on a 
                    plane back to Dublin...
                          (checking watch)
                    Dave wanted me to tell you thanks 
                    for everything...say goodbye.

      Trevor looks like he s been hit with a sledgehammer.

                    You should really get a cell phone.

      INT. TREVOR S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

      Trevor enters, approaches his pool hall counter. All the 
      beads remain grouped on one side. Off Trevor, demoralized.

      INT. BORDER S BOOKS READING ROOM - NIGHT

      Claire stands at the door ad-libbing greetings to the singles 
      arriving at the session. She spots Prudence coming up the 
      stairs, clearly upset. Claire approaches her, pulls her aside.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Prudence. What s wrong, honey?

                                  PRUDENCE
                    I ve got a question to ask you, and 
                    I already know your answer, and 
                    it s not your decision to make, but 
                    I want a sober voice in my head...

                                  CLAIRE
                    You lost me.

                                  PRUDENCE
                    The INS took Dave away. Back to 
                    Ireland. And I think I may be in 
                    love with him. But I know that s 
                      impossible. I ve known him two 
                    days. People don t fall in love in 
                    two days, do they?                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   61.


      Claire regards Prudence sympathetically, but the resignation 
    in Claire s expression indicates her she won t be giving 
      Prudence the answer she was hoping for.

                                  TREVOR (PRELAP)
                    For thousands of years I just shot 
                    people. Sat back. Laughed at the 
                    results.

      INT. TREVOR S BEDROOM - NIGHT

    PAN OFF an unwrapped cell phone box, find Trevor using it.

                                  TREVOR
                    It was a game. An easy game. I 
                    preferthe easy game. Why do 
                    mortals make falling in love so 
                    difficult?

      INT. CLAIRE S APARTMENT - SAME TIME - INTERCUT

    We find Claire in a downtown loft, modern design. She stares 
    out at the lights of the city, a glass of wine in hand.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You ll get used to it, Trevor. In 
                    fact, I find my moments of playing 
                    god much more taxing.

                                  TREVOR
                    What?

                    Nothing. I just... I just gave some 
                    advice tonight, and I m not sure it 
                    was good advice.
                          (shakingit off)
                    No. I m sure it was good advice, 
                    it s just no fun always being the 
                    one telling people to slow down.
                          (then...)
                    I m thinking about disbanding the 
                    group. I ve been using them for 
                    research. Maybe it s not fair.

                                  TREVOR
                    No. You can t. They need you. I
                    look around that singles group of 
                    yours and think,  buddy, get a dog. 
                    Order the complete cable package. 
                    I m in there looking to make the 
                    easiest match. But not you. You 
                    show up at those sessions thinking 
                    you can save them all.                                                     Thomas_CUPID_031308   62.

                    There s someone for everyone, Trevor.

                                  TREVOR
                    You say that with your authoritative 
                    tone, and even though I know better, 
                    I almost believe you.

                    Someone broke your heart -- I m 
                    sure of that much. But you ll heal. 
                    You ll even fall in love again.

                                  TREVOR
                    Here? With a mortal? Not likely. 
                    They d never let me go back, and 
                    sister, I m getting back as soon as 
                    I can.

                    Cupid fell in love with Psyche. She 
                    was a mortal.

                                  TREVOR
                    I m telling you. That never happened.

                    Let s go tomorrow. We ll meet for 
                    lunch -- you and me. I ll buy.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I don t think that s a good idea, 
                    Trevor. There are rules...

                                  TREVOR
                    Doctor. Patient. Lest I forget. 
                    Tell you what: I could use some 
                      counseling, Dr.Allen.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Suddenly doubting your omniscience?

                                  TREVOR
                    No. But from what people tell me, 
                    you re the best shrink around.

                    It may take some time, but with 
                      around-the-clock availability, some 
                    moxie, you might cure me of this.

                                  CLAIRE
                    This what?

                      Homesickness.

      Claire smiles. As she does, we INTERCUT...

      EXT. LARCHMONT VILLAGE - NIGHT

      Prudence walks down the street. She s sad, lost in thought. 
      Something catches her attention in a storefront window.

                                  CLAIRE (O.S.)
                    All right. I ll meet you down 
                    there, see if we can t make this 
                    work. You know where we re going?

                                  TREVOR (O.S.)
                    No earthly idea.

      ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE BUSINESS as the window frames Prudence 
    who puts her face against the glass.

                                  CLAIRE (O.S.)
                    That omniscience kindacomes and 
                    goes, huh? It s on Fountain, 
                    between Pacific and Atlantic. How 
                    does one o clock sound?

      Trevor doesn t answer immediately. He s facing his window, 
      staring at something. He almost appears to be in a stupor.

      TREVOR s POV: One bead has moved all the way across the pool 
      hall counter line strung across his bedroom.

                    I ll be there.

      EXT. SAINT NICK S - DAY

      Claire and Trevor sit at an outdoor table engaged in 
      conversation. From this distance the two look more like 
      friends or people on a date than a doctor and her patient. We 
      leave them feeling as though their relationship evolved into 
      something new.

      INT. LINEHAN S PUB, DUBLIN, IRELAND - DAY

    We find the source of the music. It s Dave. He s sitting at a 
      piano in a mostly-deserted pub attempting to figure out the 
      chords to a Hall & Oatessong. He begins to sing.

                                  DAVE (SINGING)
                    She s gone. Oh I, oh I d better 
                    learn how to face it. She s gone. 
                    Oh I, oh I d pay the devil to--

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hey.

      Dave looks up. He s overwhelmed to find Prudence standing 
      over him. If Prudence had any doubt about whether Dave would 
    be glad to see her, it s gone in an instant.

      Dave knocks over the piano bench in his anxiousness to take 
      Prudence in his arms. As the two fall into a mind-bending 
      kiss an older man appears behind the bar, having ascended 
      from the cellar. He sees his son wrapped in this embrace. The 
      older man allows a smile.
