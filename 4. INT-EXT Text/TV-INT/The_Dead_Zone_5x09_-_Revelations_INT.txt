          Whoosh!  It's hard to decipher where we are.  Purdy's on
          his knees.  Crying.  Sweating.  Mouth crimson with blood.

                                        PURDY
                        Is this what you came to do?! 
                        Then do it!  I deserve it! 

          A woman, JESSICA, 40s, stands above him.  Stone-faced. 



          A moose head adorns the wall.  Johnny RINGS a bell on the
          counter.  A studious looking young woman appears, JOANNA
          (15).  She has shiny braces on her teeth.

                        I hope so.  We're looking for...

          Her eyes light up as she suddenly realizes who she's
          talking to.

                        You're John Smith.

                        That's right.

                        That must make you Bruce Lewis.

                        Hey, will you guys pose for my
                        web page?  It'll really freak out
                        the bloggers.

          She grabs a digital camera from under the desk.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gee, y'know, I'm not really
                          comfortable with that kind of
                        publicity.

          Her raw excitement is quickly replaced with a look of
          cold rejection.

                                        JOANNA
                        Oh, sure, I understand.  You want
                        to keep things on the down low.

                          Exactly.
                                (awkward beat)
                        So, I was wondering if we could
                        see her room?

                                        JOANNA
                        Her room?  Oh, the girl with no
                        last name.  Sounds pretty
                        important?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It could be.

          She just stares at them, as --

          Johnny and Bruce are blinded by a camera FLASH.  Joanna
          lowers her digital Nikon, once again filled with geeky
          excitement.

                                        JOANNA
                        Okay, one more.  This time stand
                        back to back.  And fold your arms.

          They reluctantly strike the pose.  FLASH!

                        Key?  Oh, right, sure.

          She hands them a room key and walks away checking the
          camera.

                                        JOANNA
                        Just drop it on the desk on your

                        lunch.

          Johnny uses the key to open the door, as they enter --



          Johnny touches around the room, then the bed and -- WHOOSH:



            Jessica's crying.  Her suitcase is on the bed; she packs
          her things.  The photo she showed to Purdy is about to go
          into the suitcase when FREEZE:

          Johnny takes a close look.  It's a black and white PHOTO
          of a WOMAN, 20s and a LITTLE GIRL at a carnival.  A Ferris
          Wheel behind them.  There's a town WATER TOWER in the
          background.  Stenciled on the tower is: "Lewiston, Maine."



          Johnny comes out of the vision, turns to Bruce.

          She's deep into a saucy romance novel.

                        What about a carnival that came
                        through town?  Would've been about
                          twenty-five years ago.

          a wooden cross, an old bible, a couple of candles.

                        I ran a check on Raymond Franklin. 
                        Nothing came up.  At least nobody
                        that lived in Maine in the mid-
                        60's.  Closest match was an "R

                        hedge-fund in Rochester.

                        Just following some bread crumbs. 
                        Talk to you later.

          Hangs up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It seems Raymond Franklin doesn't
                        exist.  At least not one that
                          preached under a tent. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Sure he does, only his name is
                        Gene Purdy.  You saw that poster.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, I saw it.

                                        BRUCE
                        So why don't you just ask him and
                        get it over with?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You were there.  You saw the way
                        he blew me off.  I come at him, I
                        better have more than a faded
                        poster.

                                        BRUCE
                        Which leaves us where?

          As Johnny ponders their next move --



          BZZT.  A whir of articles BLUR by the screen.

          We STOP on an article.

          A PHOTO - a group of performers pose at the carnival.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's a scary lookin' bunch.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Freaks.  Carnival-type, anyway. 
                        Wait.

          Johnny recognizes someone in the photo.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Right there.  That's the guy I
                        saw arguing with Purdy.

                        I mean, Franklin.

          A tall, thin Carnival Barker leans up against the carousel. 
          Smiling a sinister smile.  Bruce scans the text -

                                        BRUCE
                        Says the carnival went out of
                          business the summer of '64.  The
                        owner opened up a restaurant just
                        north of Lewiston.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know about you, but I'm
                          suddenly starving.



          The SHOT starts TIGHT on the face of a bizarre looking,
          slightly demented, oversized CLOWN.  As the SHOT PANS
          across the room we realize it's a theme restaurant
          displaying carnival relics from yesteryear --the fortune
          teller display case, the strongman muscle-o-meter, the
          Wheel of Fortune, ETC.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        He would have been a barker for
                        your midway shows.

          The SHOT FINDS Johnny and Bruce seated at the counter
          talking with the OWNER.  They show him a copy of the photo
          they found at the library.

                                        OWNER
                        I can't place the face.  There
                        were so many rounders in those
                        days.  Most of 'em were runnin'
                        away from someplace... or somebody. 
                        And most of 'em didn't want to be
                        found.

                                        BRUCE
                        What about a Minister Franklin?

          The man's expression shifts...

                                        OWNER
                        Him, I remember.  Had a second
                        class tent revival.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What else can you tell us?

                        Guy was real a thorn in my side. 
                          Followed us that whole summer. 
                        Real fire 'n' brimstone act.

                        Any idea what happened to him?

                        Damned if I know.  One day he
                        just disappeared.  Carnival closed
                        shortly after.  I always thought
                        we'd have had a few more years,
                        if it weren't for that damn
                          preacher.

                        Excuse me.

          He walks away to help another customer.

                                        BRUCE
                        That doesn't help very much.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe we need spiritual guidance?

          Johnny notices the Wheel of Fortune and walks over to it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Last time I spun one of these was
                        the night of my accident.

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe you shouldn't tempt fate.

          Johnny notices the moustached Fortune Teller, his mannequin
          bust sits quietly behind glass.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can't hurt to check my future,
                        can it?

          He pulls out a dime, pushes it into the slot.  As he pulls
          the lever down.  WHOOSH.



          RESUME: Johnny takes his hand off the lever.

                        I don't know.

          We can see how much this is beginning to bother Johnny.



          A dark but massive home.  There's a long family history
          here, old money.  Johnny spots the photo of Jessica and
          her mother on the mantle.

                                        JESSICA
                        If the Reverend has questions, he
                        should ask me himself.

                        I think he's afraid of you.  At
                        least, your motives.

                                        JESSICA
                        I don't understand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene Purdy is an important man. 
                        And wealthy.

                        You think this is about money?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Isn't it?

                                        JESSICA
                              (a beat)
                        I want to show you something.



          Jessica pulls a stack of CHECK STUBS from a desk and hands
          them to Johnny.

                                        JESSICA
                        I've been getting monthly checks
                        since I was three years old.  It
                        was only recently I found out
                        who's been sending them.

          Johnny sees where they're issued from -

                        My mother is dead.  My husband
                        ran off with another woman two
                        years ago.  And I'm not able to
                        have children.  I assure you this
                        is about much more than money. 

          Johnny hands the checks back to her and -



          Whoosh.  We spin around Jessica.  Purdy is kneeling down
          in front of her.  Shaking.  In pain.  Mouth crimson with
          blood.  Just like before.  He looks up at her:

                                        PURDY
                        Is this what you came to do?! 
                        Then do it!  I deserve it! 

          He bows his head, closes his eyes.  Prays.

                        "Though he slay me, I shall yet
                        trust Him..."

          And a sea of GRAIN rains down, suffocating him...



          Johnny SPINS out, his suspicions crystal clear.

          Johnny notices a RED BIBLE on her coffee table.  The same
          bible from his previous vision.

          Johnny picks it up -          DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT TWO - 7/1/05 - BLUE 28.



          Whoosh!  We're in the same foyer that Johnny is standing
          in.  Young Purdy drops the red bible and kneels over the
          DEAD BODY of Clara Simon.  He checks her pulse. 

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        ... she's dead. 

          Young Purdy stares down at her open eyes.  Scared.

                                        CARNIVAL BARKER (O.S.)
                        Dead?  How can she be dead?  This
                        is not what we planned.

                        What?

                        You killed her.

          He grabs his jacket and starts away. 

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        Where are you going?  Nolan?

                        You better pray God is as forgiving
                        as you claim. 

          Nolan exits, as Young Purdy turns his attention to Clara
          Simon's lifeless body.

          Off` his look of inner torment... 



          Whoosh.  Johnny, stunned by what he's just seen.

                        I'm sorry, I've taken up too much

          And he leaves.          DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT TWO  - 6/21/05 - WHITE 29.



          Johnny and Bruce outside City Hall.  They head for his
          car.

                                        BRUCE
                        Nolan accused Purdy of killing
                        Clara Simon?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, and from the look on Gene's
                        face, he might have been right. 

                                        BRUCE
                        That explains why Purdy would
                        accept Jessica as his daughter. 
                        He doesn't want anybody asking
                          questions about her mother's death.

                        Purdy's a lot of things, but a
                          murderer?  

                                        BRUCE
                        I found some old tax records.  It
                        seems Clara Simon was loaded. 
                        Sound familiar?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You talking about my mother?

                                        BRUCE
                        Wealthy widow taken in by a
                          charismatic man of God.  It can't
                        be a coincidence... can it?    

          Angry, Johnny puts the Range Rover into drive -



                                        BRUCE
                        How you gonna handle this?

                                        JOHNNY
                        How would you suggest?

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe you should take a minute to
                        cool off?

          Johnny notices something in the rear-view mirror.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Sonofabitch!

          Bruce looks out the back.  A DARK SEDAN follows them.

                                        BRUCE
                        Same guy from before?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've had about enough of this. 
                        Hold on.

          Bruce braces himself as Johnny SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.



          Johnny snaps his seat belt off and throws open the door.

                                        BRUCE
                        John, where you goin'?

                                        JOHNNY
                        To see what this guy wants.

          Johnny gets out.



          Purdy watches as Jessica stares out the window at the
            sprawling green campus at Faith Heritage. 

                                        JESSICA
                        This place is amazing.  So many
                        unusual things to see.

          Jessica notices a small carved WOODEN IDOL.

                                        PURDY
                          I brought that back from Senegal.
                                (off her confused
                                look)
                        That's in Africa.

                                        JESSICA
                        Oh.  Wow.

                                        PURDY
                        I did my missionary work there. 
                        The idol was a gift from the
                          children of the local tribe.  It
                        symbolizes trust and love. 

          Jessica hesitates, suddenly bothered by the situation,
          then... 

                                        JESSICA
                        I don't know if this was such a
                        good idea.

                                        PURDY
                        What do you mean?

                        I don't want to be a burden to
                        you. 

          Purdy puts a hand on her shoulder.

                                        PURDY
                        There's a reason God has brought
                        us together.  I'd like you to
                        join me for services.

                        It's always been my sanctuary
                        during troubled times.

                        I'm not really dressed for the
                          occasion.

                                        PURDY
                        You look just fine.

          She forces a small smile, as...



          A full cathedral.  

          IN THE WINGS

          A pipe organ signals the beginning of the service. 
            Suddenly, an USHER approaches.  Whispers in Purdy's ear.

                                        PURDY
                                (to Jessica)
                        Excuse me for a moment.



          Johnny waits in the side hall, looking worse for wear. 

                                        PURDY
                        Johnny?  The service is about to
                        begin.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know about Clara Simon.

          Purdy considers the implications, then...

                                        PURDY
                          I really have to go.

                        What's going on, Gene?  Or should
                        I call you Raymond?

          Purdy pulls the door shut separating them from the
            congregation.

                                        PURDY
                          Whatever you think you know...
                        you're mistaken.

                        Then tell me.

                                        PURDY
                        I... can't.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm trying to help you, for God's
                        sake.

                                        PURDY
                                (angry)
                          I didn't ask for your help!

          Purdy holds his anger, then turns to leave.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't walk away from me, Goddammit!

          Johnny grabs Purdy by the arm as, WHOOSH.



          Whoosh.  Johnny spins out of the vision.  Shocked.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Jessica isn't your daughter.  And
                        you know it.

                                        PURDY
                        This is none of your concern.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If you continue down this path,
                          something very bad is going to
                        happen.

                                        PURDY
                        I'm prepared to take that chance.

          Purdy opens the door to the congregation. 

          A PIPE ORGAN plays.  Purdy calmly takes Jessica's hand -
          and they walk onstage, together.

          Johnny watches from just outside, as THE DOORS SLOWLY
          CLOSE in front of him.



          Johnny follows Walt down the hall.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Purdy had me followed, he knows I
                        know the truth, but he won't talk
                        about it.

                                        WALT
                        Why didn't you tell me about all
                        this sooner?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know, I guess I thought
                        if I didn't say it, it might not
                        be real.

                                        WALT

          Purdy's limousine is parked in front.  Jessica sits in

                          Reverend, I can't take this.

                                        PURDY
                        And I can't think of anyone else
                        I'd want to have it.

          She seems genuinely moved by the gesture.

                                        JESSICA
                              (a beat)
                        You're not the person I expected. 
                        The person I made up in my head.
                                (suddenly emotional)
                        I'm sorry.  This was a mistake.

          Purdy watches as Jessica leaves the limo.



          Purdy kneels in the front of the cathedral, head bowed. 
          He is the only one here.

                                        PURDY
                        "Our Father which art in heaven,
                          Hallowed be thy name.  Thy kingdom
                        come.  Thy will be done in earth,
                        as it is in heaven.  Give us this
                        day..."           DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT THREE - 7/1/05 - BLUE 41.



          Purdy walks alone, through the grand halls of the Church.

                                        PURDY (V.O.)
                        "And forgive us our debts, as we
                        forgive our debtors..." 

          The door to Purdy's office is OPEN.  Purdy stares at it,
          puzzled.  He enters.  Flips on the lights. 



          It's a MESS.  His desk has been swept off onto the floor. 

                                        PURDY (V.O.)
                        "And lead us not into temptation,
                        but deliver us from evil: for
                        thine is the kingdom and the power,
                        and the glory, for ever.  Amen."

          Then he SEES it -- African idol sits on his desk.  There's
          a NOTE attached to it.  He reads it, quietly shocked.

                                        PURDY
                                (hushed pain)
                        My God.



          Johnny walks in and flips on the lights, to FIND Purdy
          sitting in a chair.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene?

          Purdy looks up, his eyes carrying the pain in his heart.

                                        PURDY
                        She's gone, Johnny.  Jessica's
                        been taken.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                            ACT FOUR

          FADE IN:



          Purdy reads Johnny a note.  Upset. 

                                        PURDY
                        "This night thy soul shall be
                          required of thee..."  It was
                          attached to this.

          Purdy holds the African idol in his hands. 

                                        PURDY
                        I can't let anything happen to
                        her.

          Purdy lifts a black leather briefcase onto the desk.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're going to pay ransom?

                                        PURDY
                        Everything I have.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Call the police.

                                        PURDY
                        I can't take that chance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you want me to do?

                                        PURDY
                        Tell me who did this.  I'll never
                        ask another thing of you as long
                        as I live.  Just tell me who took
                        her.

          Johnny stares at the note.  Doesn't touch it.  He now has
          some leverage to get some answers.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who was Raymond Franklin?

          The mention of that name stings Purdy.

                                        PURDY
                        A monster.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene...

                                        PURDY
                                (pointed)
                        Raymond Franklin is dead and
                        buried!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did you kill Clara Simon?

                                        PURDY
                          Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did you?!

                                        PURDY
                        Why don't you see for yourself.

          He puts his hand out.  Johnny hesitates, then takes it.

            MATCH/CUT/MORPH:



          We SPIN around Purdy as he MORPHS into Young Purdy.  His
          hands are on Clara Simon's shoulders.  She looks pale,
          sick.  Her eyes are closed.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL

          We are onstage inside a small revival tent.  An organ
          plays, as Purdy preaches:

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        And Jesus said, "Listen carefully
                        to the voice of the Lord God, and
                        do what is right in his eyes. 
                        And I will not bring on you any
                        of the diseases I brought on the
                        Egyptians, for I am the Savior."

          Purdy places the palm of his hand flat against her forehead --

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        Dark sickness be gone from this
                        woman!

          He thrusts his hand hard against her as she falls back
          and is caught by two older men in rumpled suits.  The
          small congregation rejoices with their hands in the air
          and sporadic "Praise God!"  and "Hallelujah, Jesus!"  


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT FOUR - 7/6/05 - PINK  43A.

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        I feel the power of Christ filling
                        this tent tonight.  I see the
                        Glory of his mercy in every face.

          The crowd REJOICES again.  Clara is now back at his side.

                        Affirm your faith and you will be
                        healed!  Do you believe, sister?!

                                        CLARA
                        I believe.

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        Do you accept me as a messenger
                        of God?! 

          Clara is finally swept up in the moment as her emotions
          burst through and she begins to cry joyous tears. 

                                        CLARA
                        I do!  I believe!  I believe!

          She falls into Purdy's embrace as the scene builds
          intensity.  Whoosh.



          MATCH: Purdy's sullen expression, as Johnny now sees the
          truth.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You were a faith healer?

                                        PURDY
                        More 'faith' than 'healer'.
                                (beat)
                        My partner and I went from town
                        to town, gathering information on
                        wealthy citizens and using it to
                        gain their trust.

          He stops for a second to consider the African idol, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's when you met Clara Simon?

                                        PURDY
                                (nods)
                        When she came to me, she was pale
                        and weak.  As time passed, her
                          condition grew more serious.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She believed you'd healed her.

          Purdy offers a sorrowful nod.

                                        PURDY
                        It was only later I realized she'd
                        stopped taking her medication. 
                        That her condition was much more
                        serious than I'd been led to
                          believe. 
                                (desperate tone)
                        You have to believe me, Johnny. 
                          I wasn't in it just for the money. 
                        I believed then, as I believe
                        now, that God truly does perform
                          miracles.  I'm living proof.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But you still took the money.

                                        PURDY
                        I was young, full of blind
                          ambition.  I planned to use the
                        cash to build a church.  A place
                        where anyone and everyone would
                        be welcome.  A place like Faith
                          Heritage. 
                                (beat)
                        But make no mistake, I killed
                        that woman.  Murdered her the
                        same as if I'd put a gun to her
                        head.  And there hasn't been a
                        day I haven't suffered for it.

          Johnny can see his pain.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's why you set up the hedge
                        fund.  Why you sent Jessica money
                        every month. 

                                        PURDY
                        I need to protect her.  No matter
                        what.

          Purdy picks up the ransom note and offers it to Johnny
          again.

                        One more question.  Did you con

                                        JOHNNY
                                (cold as ice)
                        If you're lying, it won't be God
                        that strikes you down.

          Johnny walks out, leaving Purdy alone.



          Johnny answers the DOORBELL.  It's Walt and Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY

                        Nolan and Purdy used to work
                          together.  A tent revival.

                        I'm afraid so.  He's waiting in
                        my office...



          They enter the office.  But Purdy's gone.

          They know where they need to go now.



          Purdy walks in.  Looks around.  Seems empty.

                                        PURDY
                                (calling into the

                        Hello?  Edward?  I have the money.

          A long BEAT, then...

                                        NOLAN (O.S.)
                        Hello, Raymond.

          Purdy SPINS around, as he SEES Edward Nolan directly behind
          him.

                                        NOLAN
                        It's been a long time.

            Suddenly, Nolan swings down with his right hand.  BAM. 
          Purdy is knocked out as the SCREEN GOES BLACK.



          PURDY'S POV - LIGHT

          A BRIGHT LIGHT.  Is this death?

          ANOTHER ANGLE

          Purdy regains his senses as he realizes he's been CHAINED
          to a concrete slab inside the silo.

          He pulls on the chain, but he's trapped.

                                        NOLAN (O.S.)
                        How's it feel to be chained up
                        like an animal?

          Nolan steps out of the darkness, holding a gun.

                        Now you know what my life has
                        been like the past ten years.

                                        PURDY
                        What have you done with Jessica?

                                        NOLAN
                        Is that any way to greet your old
                          partner?



          Nolan stands over Purdy.

                                        NOLAN
                        You've come a long way, Raymond. 
                          Remember when we shoveled grain
                        on farms like this?  You never
                        were much for gettin' your hands
                        dirty.

                                        PURDY
                        Those days are gone.  I'm a 
                          different person now.

                                        NOLAN
                        Only thing different about you is
                        your name... and your hairline.

          Nolan smiles as he SNAPS the briefcase open.  Thick stacks
          of Ben Franklins inside....

                                        NOLAN
                        Still sellin' God to the great
                          unwashed.

                                        PURDY
                          I understand you think I betrayed
                        you, but I'm no longer the man
                        you knew.  I've been reborn.

          Nolan approaches Purdy, leans in, studies his face.

          BAM.  Nolan DECKS Purdy with the butt his rifle.  Blood
          trickles from his mouth, down his chin.  Nolan sniffs.

                                        NOLAN
                          I waited in here for 3 DAYS after

          Jessica comes out of the darkness.  Unharmed.  Unbound. 
          The weight of what's happening falls on Purdy.

                                        PURDY
                        I don't understand.  You're

                        from me?  Pay for the life you
                        took?

          Nolan climbs a flight of steps as he speaks...

                        No questions asked.  Just the way
                        I knew you would.

          Purdy is on his knees, defeated.  His mouth crimson with
          blood.  Just like in Johnny's vision.  Looks up to Jessica.

                                        PURDY
                        Is this what you came to do?! 
                        Then do it!  I deserve this!

          He bows his head, closes his eyes.  Prays.

          box.  And turns the key.

          The conveyor WHIRS to life.



          Nolan BREAKS the key in the lock with his boot.

          Grain FALLS from the ceiling onto Purdy.  He pulls on the
          chains, he's trapped...



          Grain showers down on Purdy who is almost buried in it,*
          only his face showing.  The grain covers Purdy's face,*
          suffocating him.*



          Jessica looks at Nolan, horrified.  Nolan walks towards
          the exit...

                                        JESSICA
                        What are you doing?  We have the

                        there is a God, and you are a
                          different man, then the gates of
                        Heaven should swing wide when you

          Nolan and Purdy stare hard at each other, then...          DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT FOUR - 7/6/05 - PINK  54.



          Johnny crawls in.  Over the loud HUM of a motor, he hears*
          voices coming from overhead.  He creeps up the stairs*
          leading to...*



          Johnny sees Nolan and Jessica whose backs are toward him*
          as they look down, watching the grain falling on Purdy*
          below.  As Johnny approaches them, Nolan turns.  Johnny*
          makes a grab for the rifle.  As he and Nolan struggle,*

          THE RIFLE

          Falls to the floor and skitters out of reach.*

          Johnny and Nolan both see it, as Johnny jumps and grabs*
          him.  A brief FIGHT ensues, as Nolan finally drops Johnny
          with a punch to the gut.

          Nolan hurries to retrieve the gun, but finds it gone.  He*
          turns to SEE Jessica holding the rifle on him.

                                        NOLAN
                        Give me the gun.

          He takes a step towards her as she quickly chambers a
          round and levels the barrel on him.

                                        JESSICA
                        Stay where you are!

          Nolan notices the money bag about twenty feet across the
          silo on the ground.  Jessica sees it, too.

                                        NOLAN
                        You were right.  Let's just take
                        the money and go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You leave with him and you won't
                        see the sun again.

                                        NOLAN
                        I wouldn't hurt you.  You know
                        that.

          The grain builds up around Purdy like quicksand.

          Jessica is confused.  Johnny starts up towards the control
          panel.

                                        JESSICA
                        I said don't move!

          She swings the gun up towards Johnny, then back at Nolan
          and back up at Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't pretend to know you, or
                        your pain.  But you're not a
                        killer.  Don't let this man make
                        you one.

                                        NOLAN
                        He deserves to die for what he
                        did to your mother.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nolan doesn't give a damn about
                        your mother.  All he cares about
                        is the money.

          She begins to cry, the pain and suffering of her life
          bubbling to the surface in this tense moment.

                                        JESSICA
                        He lied to her.  She believed in
                        him and he lied.

          Johnny locks eyes with Purdy, the grain now covering his
          chest and climbing.  For a brief second, Johnny isn't
          sure why or if he can defend this man.  Then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not saying Raymond Franklin
                          deserves your mercy.  He doesn't. 
                        But Franklin isn't here.  He died
                        with your mother over forty years
                        ago.

          Purdy can only close his eyes and listen.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can only tell you about Gene
                        Purdy.  I can tell you he's a man
                        of compassion and understanding. 
                        He's also a man blinded by greed
                        and personal ambition.  I guess
                        he's like the rest of us,
                        struggling to stay on the path. 
                        But he was willing to sacrifice
                        everything for you.  Even his
                        life.  That has to count for
                        something.

          A tear rolls down Jessica's cheek. 

          The GRAIN rises to Purdy's neck... 

          She LOWERS The gun.

          Nolan grabs the briefcase and TAKES OFF.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let him go!

          Johnny stares at the control panel.  The key is broken
          inside the lock. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        He broke the key off.  I can't
                        shut it off from here.

          The grain won't stop.  It's under Purdy's chin.

          Johnny runs back down to the first floor.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene, hang on!

          Purdy is now muttering the Lord's prayer to himself.

          Johnny lunges in and begins to dig away the pouring grain
          away from Purdy's face.  It's a losing struggle against
          time.

                                        PURDY
                        The rifle.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (digging)
                        I'm not going to shoot you!

                                        PURDY
                        Not me... the control panel.

          Johnny realizes he's right, but if he stops digging, Purdy
          might suffocate by the time he shoots the box and gets
          back down to him.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Jessica, keep digging the grain
                        away while I go up top!  You can
                        do it!

          She takes over for Johnny, as he grabs the rifle and runs
          up the steps towards the master control panel.  Having
          smaller hands and less strength than Johnny, it's quickly
          a losing battle against the falling grain.  Purdy's face
          becomes hidden beneath the mounting grain.

                                        JESSICA
                        I can't stop it!

          ON JOHNNY

          As he steps back and FIRES 2 SHOTS into the metal control
          box.  The SPARKS FLY as the motor whirs to a stop.

                                        JESSICA
                        Johnny, help him!

          Johnny dashes back down the steps, tossing the rifle aside
          as he lunges into the mountain of grain.  Purdy is no
          longer visible under the mound.

                                        JESSICA
                                (crying)
                        I couldn't stop it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Keep digging!

          They both dig frantically...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Come on, hang in there you self
                          righteous sonofa --

            Suddenly, we SEE the top of Purdy's head as Johnny doubles
          his effort to clear the grain away from Purdy's face...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene?

          For a moment we aren't sure if he's dead or alive, then
          finally Purdy coughs and spits...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank God.  Help me get him out.

          WIDE SHOT as they both start pushing away the pile of
          fallen grain...
