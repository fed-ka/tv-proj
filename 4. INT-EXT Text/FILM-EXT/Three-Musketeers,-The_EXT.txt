Dawn. A verdant field in Gascony. BIRDS CALL from tree-
tops. The WIND RUSTLES through green leaves. A fox
darts into a thick hedge. And last, anti-pastoral, out
of place -- the sound of CLASHING STEEL.
SUPERIMPOSE:
France, 1625.
Suddenly, two young men burst INTO VIEW, sword points
cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air. The
first is GIRARD, bearded, nearly thirty, a man in every
facet. The second, D'ARTAGNAN. Younger in appearance
and attitude. Exuberant, handsome. And at just this
moment, bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous
cry.
They battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew.
Girard is the more polished combatant. But d'Artagnan is
nearly a force of nature. He whips his sword through the
air with wild-hearted abandon. He tumbles and somer-
saults. This is fun.
Girard and d'Artagnan cross the field, pass over a wooden
fence, struggle toward a stable and hayloft. As they
fight, both men utilize a variety of props. Handfuls of
hay, a wooden spar, quick kicks from heavy boots.
Anything goes as the swords cut through the air.
D'Artagnan, gaining increasing advantage, forces Girard
up against a peaceful country manor. Girard, seemingly
cornered, executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof,
fights from this high angle. D'Artagnan merely smiles...
and follows.

ANGLE ON ROOFTOP

Seen briefly in silhouette against the rising sun, Girard
and d'Artagnan scramble up the v-shaped rooftop, pause
to exchange swipes at the peak, then slide down the other
side, attacking, defending, as they go.

Inside the manor house, a HANDSOME WOMAN of forty glances
up from her writing table, hears FOOTSTEPS on the roof.
She reacts -- curious, not afraid -- and steps to an open
window. As
if to follow the footsteps to the other side.

BACK TO SCENE

Girard leaps to the ground first -- landing in an en-
closure filled with SQUAWKING GEESE. D'Artagnan flies
after. The geese scatter, d'Artagnan -- whose wild
progress frequently resembles that of a young colt --
stumbles briefly. Girard seeks advantage, thrusts his
sword toward the young man's heart. But d'Artagnan
parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand, rolls over
the offending goose -- glances deadpan apology -- and
rises to fight again.
The epic battle continues. Girard's modest success de-
volves into desperate flight. D'Artagnan's seemingly
endless reserves are wearing him down. Then, at the
last possible moment, Girard spies escape: a slow-
moving HAYCART RUIMBLING up the country road. He runs
toward the cart, leaps upon it, turns back to d'Artagnan
with a confident smirk -- an expression that vanishes
when the young Gascon executes a nearly impossible leap
to join him.
And still they battle, the clash of swords a kind of
music by now, the men, their exuberance, the bright morn-
ing all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display. Just
then: The haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge. Girard
backs from d'Artagnan's sword, weak from exhaustion, he
stumbles. D'Artagnan has his man and he knows it. He
prepares one last blow --
-- And the haycart shifts, deposits both men over the
side and down to the small muddy creek below. A comical
antidote to all this glorious swordplay.

INCLUDE CREEK

Girard lands flat on his back, stunned, his sword out of
reach. D'Artagnan lands similarly, but recovers with
grace, or rather, as much grace as the muddy situation
will allow. He rolls toward Girard, sword in hand, and
lightly places the sharp gleaming tip against his adam's
apple.
A long beat. Then a surprise. Girard begins to laugh,
long and loud. D'Artagnan responds with a charmed smile.
D'ARTAGNAN
Had enough?
GIRARD
(breathless
deadpan)
I believe now would be a good
time to end your, uhm, formal
training. Well done.

D'ARTAGNAN

clothing -- cut to ribbons, muddy and soaked.

A huge and beautiful field appropriate to the moment.
Mother and son stand in the vast expanse. D'Artagnan

I'm not your mother now. I'm
speaking for your father. And
this is what he would have told
you. Never forget the code of
the d'Artagnans. It is your
special heritage.

Always seek out adventure...
D'ARTAGNAN

A bittersweet moment. D'Artagnan posed before his first
great adventure. But not completely certain that he
wishes to leave home.
D'ARTAGNAN
Mother. Maybe I should wait.
Until after harvest.
D'Artganan's mother smiles, understands.
And speaks
gently to urge him forward.
MOTHER
You've heard that every man in
the Musketeers is on the run from
someone or something?
D'ARTAGNAN
Yes.
But what am I running from?
MOGHER
(gentle humor)
A shrew of a mother, and a drafty
old house. Now go.
And in this fashion, she releases him. D'Artagnan sweeps
his Mother into an embrace, now turns, heroic, and leaps
into the saddle. The horse reacts with a start, skitters
in a half-cicle. D'Artagnan struggles to gain control,
finally brings the horse to rein. He manages a charmed
grin. His mother smiles, scolds:
MOTHER
And for heaven's sake, practice
your horsemanship.
D'ARTAGNAN
Horsemanship.
Got it.
D'Artagnan digs his heels into the horse's flanks, shoots
off across bright green fields. His Mother shields her
eyes from the sun, feels a gathering of tears, and
watches him ride into the distance.

EMBLEM OF KING'S MUSKETEERS
12
It FILLS the SCREEN, serves as background for the MAIN
TITLES. As the FINAL CREDIT APPEARS, and the MUSIC ENDS,
the blade of a sword ENTERS FRAME. It slides beneath the
emblem, pries it off the wall. The emblem falls to the
floor with an undignified thud. A fire blazes in a huge
hearth behind it.

INCLUDE MUSKETEERS' HEADQUARTERS
13
A room in the Musketeers Headquarters. The fallen emblem
is retrieved by JUSSAC, an officer who wears the bright
red tunic of the Cardinal's Guards.
JUSSAC
What should I do with this?
Jussac offers
the emblem to a tall, elegant wraith in
black finery,
a patch covers one eye. This is the COUNT
DE ROCHEFORT,
Richelieu's right hand, one of the deadli-
est swordsmen
in all of France.
ROCHEFORT
Throw it on the fire with
everything else.
JUSSAC
But this is the emblem of the
Musketeers...
ROCHEFORT
The Musketeers no longer exist.
Or haven't you heard?
(cold command)
Throw it on the fire.
Jussac hastily adds the emblem to the fiery blaze, it is
instantly consumed. Rochefort watches it burn, then
walks to a balcony overlooking a vast courtyard.

Grim, funereal silence as a hundred Musketeers remove
their blue and gold tunics, drop them into a pile that
already contains their swords and muskets. The
Musketeers remain stoic throughout, unwilling to reveal
the depth of their despair. The latter is supervised by
the Cardinal's Guards, who view their hated enemies'
plight with satisfaction. This is a sad day for the
Musketeers, the end of an era.
MONSIEUR DE TREVILLE forces a salute toward the captain
of the Cardinal's Guards, hands over his own musket.

Rochefort watches from above, a cruel smile twists his
lips. He steps to the railing, addresses the men below.
ROCHEFORT
Musketeers...
A hundred faces turn
upward to regard him. And on each
the same expression
-- absolute loathing for the man in
black. Rochefort is
not intimidated by this sea of con-
tempt. He revels in
it.
ROCHEFORT
By joint edict of His Majesty
King Louis XIII and His Eminence
Cardinal Richelieu, the
Musketeers are officially
disbanded. In preparation for
the coming war with England, your
ranks and commissions are hereby
transferred to the Infantry. You
will be contacted and told where
to report. Until that time, you
are instructed to return to your
homes.
DE TREVILLE
(shouting to
Rochefort)
And who will protect the King?
ROCHEFORT
The Cardinal's Guards are more
than capable of assuming that...
responsibility.
Muttered curses and dissent throughout.
Rochefort raises
his voice to be heard:
ROCHEFORT
You are hereby ordered to
disperse. Should even one of you
resist... the entire corps will
be arrested and imprisoned.
(with pleasure
and disdain)
'All for one, and one for all.'
As Rochefort intended, the Musketeers explode. But
before they can attack the Guards, de Treville's com-
manding voice calls out above the clamor.

And with that, the Musketeers freeze. Their eyes go to

chooses his words carefully. Even in defeat, de Treville
is stoic.
DE TREVILLE
Go to your homes. Wait. Our
day will come again.
De Treville shoots a defiant look at Rochefort who smiles
in a patronizing manner. Then, de Treville leads his
Musketeers out of the courtyard.

ROCHEFORT

He returns to the adjoining room where Jussac stands by.
Rochefort has enjoyed himself immensely. He goes to a
mirror and preens, adjusting his eye patch to a more rak-
ish angle. That's when he catches a glimpse of something
behind him. Something red. Rochefort turns.
a tall, powerfully built MAN stands in the shadows of the
room, a spectre in red.
ROCHEFORT
Your Eminence.
Rochefort and Jussac instantly fall to their knees.
ARMAND DU PLEISS THE CARDINAL RICHELIEU steps out of the
darkness and into the light, his long crimson robes
swirling about him like clouds of blood. His face is
long, shrewd and intelligent. His eyes are penetrat-
ing. He smiles his crocodile smile.
Richelieu observes a duty roster on one of the walls.
It contains the names of all the Musketeers, past and
present.
RICHELIEU
Have they all been accounted for?

All but... three.
On Richelieu's face, a flicker of irritation.

Jussac leads
a regiment of the Cardinal's Gruards down
Paris' most
colorful and notorious street. They react
to SHOUTING
and VIOLENT NOISES coming from a tavern
ahead. The
one called... The Dead Rat.
The tavern door flies open, and two of the Cardinal's
Guards are flung into the street, bruised and bloody.
Just then: A window on the second floor bursts open,
and a big Musketeer dangles a struggling Guard by his
feet, threatening to drop him into the street. The
Musketeer, a man of enormous appetites -- wine, women,
song -- is called PORTHOS. Jussac shouts:
JUSSAC
Release that man!!
Happy to comply, Porthos lets go of the Guard who plunges
to the street with a dull thud. Then, with a wink and a
piratical grin, Porthos ducks inside. Jussac darkens,
signals his men, and they rush toward the tavern.

D'Artagnan, on horseback, pauses on a bluff overlook-
ing the magnificent city on the Seine. What he beholds
is Paris as it looked in the early part of the Seven-
teenth Century, its steeples and towers rising to meet the
sky. For a country boy like d'Artagnan, Paris is a
magical place where the wildest of dreams can come true.
D'Artagnan's reverie is broken by the sound of THUNDERING
HOOFBEATS coming from behind. He turns in response and
what he sees is this:
Two women on horseback are riding for all they're worth
pursued by two men on horseback.
19
D'ARTAGNAN
19
His heroic blood stirs. Women in danger! As the women
GALLOP past, d'Artagnan leaps from his horse. Quickly
formulating a plan, he clambers up the trunk of a nearby
tree and climbs out on a branch that overhangs the road.

As the two riders pass underneath, d'Artagnan leaps into
space and tackles one of them, knocking him out of the
saddle. The rider hits the ground and is knocked sense-
less. One down.
D'Artagnan scrambles to his feet as the second rider re-
verses direction and GALLOPS back, charging d'Artagnan.
The rider draws his saber.
D'Artagnan dodges the horse and the sword. He catches
the second rider's arm and yanks him right out of the
saddle. The man lands with a painful thud at
d'Artagnan's feet. Before he can recover, d'Artagnan is
upon him with flying fists. One swift punch -- and the
second rider is senseless. Two down.
D'Artagnan stands over his two victims, out of breath,
but greatly pleased with his performance. He looks up as
the two women ride back to see what's happened.
The first woman is of noble breeding, a beautiful dark-
haired girl in her late teens. Her name is ANNE. Her
companion is roughly the same age, titan-haired and
equally beautiful. Her name is CONSTANCE.
Anne regards the two men on the ground, then d'Artagnan.
She shakes her head, laughs with delight and rides off.
Constance remains. She smiles down at d'Artagnan from
atop her horse.
CONSTANCE
Do you have any idea what you've
done?
D'ARTAGNAN
I've saved you and your friend
from these bandits.
CONSTANCE
These 'bandits' are the Queen's
own bodyguards.
D'Artagnan is stunned.
D'ARTAGNAN
The Queen?
Constance points a finger in Anne's direction.
CONSTANCE
If I were you, I'd make myself
scarce. These men are going to be
very angry when they wake up.

Constance smiles at him, her eyes twinkling.
CONSTANCE
Do you have a name?
D'ARTAGNAN
D'Artagnan.
CONSTANCE
You're a very foolish boy,
d'Artagnan... but a very handsome
one. Good-bye.
Constance spurs her horse and rides off to catch up with
Anne.
D'ARTAGNAN
(calling after her)
Wait!
You didn't tell me your
name!
But Constance is gone.
D'Artagnan stands in the middle of the road, feeling
foolish and oddly thrilled at the same time. The two
bodyguards groan and grumble.
A bright reflection catches d'Artagnan's eye. He looks
down and sees a gleaming bracelet. He picks it up and...
D'ARTAGNAN
The man who attacked you...
(pointing in the
opposite direction)
... went that way.
With a guilty smile, d'Artagnan spurs his horse and rides

shop doors. Colorful vendors and pedestrians move along
the crowded boulevard. Acrobats, puppeteers, and jug-
glers perform on street corners. LAUGHTER and MUSIC
drift from taverns and public houses.
D'Artagnan views it all with great enthusiasm. He sees
the exterior of the Musketeer Headquarters... wow! The
future belongs to him.

He crosses the courtyard to a large wooden door. But as
he reaches for the handle, the door flies open and smacks

D'Artagnan blocks Athos' path.
D'ARTAGNAN
But I just got here. How can I
become a Musketeer if they've been
disbanded?

I'd say you've got a problem.
D'Artagnan grabs Athos by his injured arm. Athos, stif-

ATHOS
You could use a lesson in manners.
D'Artagnan touches his sword, eyes flashing at the pos-

Meanwhile, d'Artagnan races around another corner, down a
narrow lane, and speeds after the ladies on horseback.
He dashes through a muddy puddle -- spraying foul water
all over Porthos where he stands. D'Artagnan doesn't
notice, a huge cart loaded with wine barrels has rolled
INTO VIEW, blocking the lane. Fellow travelers shout
complaints, the cart driver shakes his head, makes an
obscene gesture. It's a Seventeenth Century traffic jam.
D'Artagnan sees Anne and Constance dismount in the dis-
tance, tie their horses, and step into an alley. A man
waits in the shadows to escort them. D'Artagnan leaps
off his horse, he means to continue his pursuit on foot.

DE WINTER. She is to sex, what Constance is to innocence.
D'Artagnan watches as if in a dream. The carriage, the
beautiful woman inside it. Paris wraps its arms around
the young man's heart. Suddenly: a second face enters the
carriage window, replacing hers, jarring by contrast. It
is the fierce visage of Milady's Indo-Chinese Bodyguard,
PARKER. The bodyguard glares, pulls at the carriage
window curtains, taking Milady, the dream, from view.

D'ARTAGNAN
If you'd rather kill me another
time...
ATHOS
Thanks, but I see my seconds
coming now.
Porthos and Aramis arrive on horseback. They dismount,
view d'Artagnan with amazement. D'Artagnan reacts with
similar surprise, smiles sheepishly.
PORTHOS
(to Athos)
What're you doing? You can't
fight this man.
ATHOS
Why not?
PORTHOS
Because I'm fighting him.
D'ARTAGNAN
Excuse me, monsieur. But not
until one o'clock.
ARAMIS
(amused)
Wait a minute. I've got a duel
with him, too.
D'ARTAGNAN
Yes, sir.
But not until two.
ATHOS
(to d'Artagnan)
How long have you been in Paris?
D'ARTAGNAN
I arrived this morning.
ATHOS
You've been... busy.
D'ARTAGNAN
I've also fallen in love.
ATHOS
(gruff to a fault)
Better to die for love than to
live for it. Gentlemen?

Athos gestures for Aramis and Porthos to stand aside. He
draws his saber, ready to fight. A beat. And in that
moment, d'Artagnan's face reveals an emotion he has never
felt before in his young life. Fear. Athos sees it,
allows him a moment to withdraw his saber. D'Artagnan
does so, they square off, touch sabers, and...
... Jussac leads a patrol of the Cardinal's Guards INTO
VIEW.
JUSSAC
There they are!!
Athos and d'Artagnan separate as Jussac and his four
swordsmen stride towards them.
ARAMIS
Jussac.
Again.
Athos steps forward to meet him.
ATHOS
I told you the next time we met
I'd want an answer. But I didn't
expect you so soon.
JUSSAC
The three of you are under arrest.
The boy's of no interest to me
and is free to go. Do you intend
to resist?
PORTHOS
Oh, don't be stupid. Of course we
intend to resist. Just give us
a second.
Porthos huddles with Athos and Aramis.
PORTHOS
Interesting odds. Five of them
and three of us.
ARAMIS
It hardly seems fair. Let's give
them the chance to surrender.
D'ARTAGNAN
(interrupting)
Excuse me, but there are four of
us.
They turn and regard d'Artagnan.

ATHOS
This is not your fight.
You're
not a Musketeer.
D'ARTAGNAN
I may not wear the uniform, but I
believe I have the heart of a
Musketeer.
The three Musketters exchange smiles. D'Artagnan's
youthful bravado manages a small dent in their cynicism.
PORTHOS
Bold and brave.
ARAMIS
A poet.
ATHOS
Have you got a name, boy?
D'ARTAGNAN
D'Artagnan.
PORTHOS
(startled)
D'Artagnan?
The name has meaning for all of them. The Musketeers
look at each other, deadpan, shake their heads.
ARAMIS
Impossible.
PORTHOS
It couldn't be.
Athos knows that it is. He steps forward, extends a
hand. The others follow, shake as well. Athos intro-
duces each in turn.
ATHOS
Athos... Porthos... Aramis.
D'ARTAGNAN
Pleased to meet you... How do you
do?... Good to see you again...
Meanwhile, Jussac and his Guards look on with increasing
impatience. He clears his throat, draws his saber. The
Musketeers turn toward the Guards, d'Artagnan standing
among them.

PORTHOS
Well. Now that we're all
acquainted...
ATHOS
The Cardinal's Guards.
D'Artagnan and the Musketeers draw their swords... and
charge.
42
FIGHT
42
Suddenly: nine men are locked in mortal combat. Athos
takes a Guard named Cahusac, Porthos battles BISCARAT,
and Aramis battles with two adversaries at once.
D'Artagnan looks for an opponent... and finds himself
face to face with Jussac.
The fighting style of the Musketeers is an exuberant mix-
ture of styles and techniques. Athos is a brutal swords-
man, his strokes overpowering and savage. His repertoire
also includes swift kicks, solid punches, the occasional
elbow when necessary. Aramis is a seamless and graceful
technician, he handles his two opponents with balletic
ease, an artist working with steel and flesh, rather than
paint and canvas.
And last, and perhaps the most entertaining of all,
Porthos. He is a walking arsenal, carrying a variety of
bizarre weapons on his body -- a crossbow, daggers, bolo,
nunchucks -- all of which he uses with the polished skill
of a master. Add this funhouse of armaments to his
already impressive size and strength, and you have a one-
man wrecking crew of epic proportions.
D'Artagnan's youthful energy is by now familiar. He
bounds about like a newborn tiger, encircles his adver-
sary, changing stance and shifting his ground with alac-
rity. Jussac is having a hard time defending himself
against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all
directions at once.
JUSSAC
(losing patience)
Stand still! How do you expect
me to kill you if you keep jumping
around!!
43
MONASTERY
43
A monk watches from the bell tower, incensed by the battle
raging on the field below. He grabs the BELL rope, gives
it a mighty pull... and sounds a clamorous ALARM.
41.
44
BACK TO SCENE
44
Porthos reacts to the interruption with irritation. He
produces a pair of nunchucks. Biscarat looks at the odd
weapon with professional curiosity, slight confusion...
and Porthos whacks him on the side of the head, knocks
him to the ground.
PORTHOS
(eyes on the tower)
Damn monks. Always spoiling
everybody's fun.
Aramis replies while shifting from one foe to the next.
ARAMIS
They are nearer to God...
PORTHOS
They're about to get a little
nearer to the hilt of my sword.
ARAMIS
Pagan.
PORTHOS
Papist.
Porthos slides over to handle one of Aramis' opponents.
He'd rather bicker from close range. But Biscarat
struggles to his feet, grabs his saber. Porthos sees
him, sighs.
PORTHOS
(to Aramis)
Excuse me?
ARAMIS
I'm fine, thank you.
And Porthos returns to his original foe. Meanwhile,
Athos' heavy strokes take their toll. Cahusac staggers,
wounded in arm, shoulder, grazed at the head -- and falls
to the ground with a thud. Aramis calls out to him,
indicates d'Artagnan:
ARAMIS
Take a look at our young friend.
ATHOS
You mean he's still alive?
Not only is d'Artagnan alive, but he's making a fool out
of Jussac.
Frustrated, enraged, Jussac makes a full lunge
at him, but d'Artagnan ducks, then slips under Jussac's
sword like a snake and runs him through.
(CONTINUED)
42.
44
CONTINUED:
44
Jussac falls to the ground, lies still.
He is dead.
Athos and Aramis react, impressed. Then turn their full
attention on weakening foes. They disarm and disable
them with swift strokes. Meanwhile, Porthos chases
Biscarat into a grove of trees. The Guard has discovered
the better part of valor, now runs for his life. Porthos
-- who is at play as much as he is war -- takes a Spanish
bolo from his cloak, and whips the balls over his head.
Biscarat hears the odd WHIZZING sound, turns to face him.
The color drains from his face.
BISCARAT
Now what...?
Porthos lets the bolo fly -- it catches Biscarat about
the neck, the balls slam into his head. The Guard drops
to the ground without a sound.
PORTHOS
God, I love my work.
45
AFTERMATH
45
A sudden silence, save for the occasional dull groan.
D'Artagnan scans the battlefield, sees Aramis bending
over Jussac's body, speaking in solemn tones under his
breath.
D'ARTAGNAN
(to Athos)
What's he doing?
ATHOS
Last rites. Aramis takes death
very seriously.
Porthos returns in high spirits, stashes the bolo in a
pouch under his cloak. D'Artagnan sees the other weapons
there, including a boomerang. Maybe next time.
PORTHOS
(re: the bolo)
Do you know where this bolo comes
from?
D'ARTAGNAN
(a bold jest, given
the circumstances)
The Queen of America?
PORTHOS
Spain.
(CONTINUED)
43.
45
CONTINUED:
45
Porthos deadpans, then grins acceptance.
All for one,
and one for all. D'Artagnan beams.
ARAMIS
Don't encourage him. By killing
Jussac, the boy's made himself
an outlaw too.
ATHOS
Not if he leaves Paris. Which is
exactly what he's going to do.
D'ARTAGNAN
I can't leave. I just got here.
PORTHOS
Go home, find a wench, live long
and prosper.
D'ARTAGNAN
Why can't I stay with you?
Aramis and Porthos look to Athos.
As always, he will
decide.
ATHOS
Because I do not want you to.
It's hard to say whether he's acting out of concern for
the boy... or he simply doesn't give a damn. Whatever
the case, d'Artagnan is crestfallen. The Musketeers
mount their horses, Porthos and Aramis adopt a friendlier
tone.
ARAMIS
I know Athos may seem cold and
unfriendly, but don't let that
fool you.
PORTHOS
He really is cold and unfriendly.
ARAMIS
But he's also right. This is our
fight, not yours. Go on, get out
of here.
D'ARTAGNAN
Whatever happened to the motto of
the Musketeers? 'All for one,
and one for all.'
ATHOS
Wake up, boy.
The Musketeers are
just a dream.
(CONTINUED)
44.

45
Athos spurs his horse, rides away. Aramis and Porthos
follow. HOLD ON d'Artagnan as he watches the Musketeers
grow small in the distance. Then, sadly, he steps to his
horse, climbs into the saddle. It has been both the best
and the worst day of his young life.
That's when a group of horsemen come riding around the
corner of the monastery -- five Cardinal's Guards led by
Rochefort himself. They see their wounded comrades,
Jussac dead, and the three Musketeers escaping in the
distance.
ROCHEFORT
(pointing)
There they go! After them!
But before Rochefort and the Guards can give chase,
d'Artagnan rides into the middle of the field to
challenge them, as if to further prove himself worthy
of the blue and gold.
D'ARTAGNAN
(defiant)
Long live the Musketeers.
And d'Artagnan draws his saber.
AT DISTANCE
The three Muskeeters rein their horses, look back to
d'Artagnan's bold charge.
PORTHOS
(with admiration)
Do you believe this kid.
D'Artagnan gallops toward the Guards to engage them.
He
races through PISTOL SHOTS like a demon possessed.
Rochefort rides to the lead, draws his sword.
ROCHEFORT
(shouts to the
others)
Fall back! I'll take him myself!
And like two jousting knights, d'Artagnan and
Rochefort
meet in the middle of the field. Their BLADES
connect
with a resounding CLASH, d'Artagnan is knocked
clear of
his saddle. He hits the ground with a painful
thud.
Rochefort's Guards leap towards him.
45.
46
ANGLE TO INCLUDE MUSKEERS
46
Porthos and Aramis are greatly moved by d'Artagnan's
courage.
PORTHOS
Rochefort's got the boy.
ATHOS
(seemingly unmoved)
Too bad.
ARAMIS
You can't just leave him.
Athos spurs his horse, rides away. Aramis and Porthos
exchange sad looks and hopeful comments.
ARAMIS
He has a plan.
PORTHOS
Definitely.
A plan.
And with that, they gallop after.
47
BACK TO SCENE
47
Meanwhile, d'Artagnan is soon outnumbered, and quickly
subdued.
GUARD
This boy fights like a wildcat.
D'ARTAGNAN
(exhausted)
Thank you.
The Guard clobbers d'Artagnan with the scabbard of his
sword. The last thing d'Artagnan sees is the three
Musketeers riding into the distance. Then the WORLD
TILTS, GOES SUDDENLY BLACK.
FADE IN:
48
48
The walls and towers of France's most infamous prison
rise to meet a starless sky. The portcullis is raised
by men-at-arms, admitting a spectacular crimson carriage
pulled by a team of snow-white stallions. The emblem of
the Cardinal of France is emblazoned on the carriage
door, and THROUGH its WINDOW we see the profile of
Richelieu.

59
BELLS TOLL. A motley crowd gathers around the execution
scaffold, held back by men-at-arms. A hooded executioner
mounts the steps of the scaffold in the company of a
PRIEST. The Priest wears a black cassock and a broad
black sombrero. The executioner, a large man, raises
his axe and touches the end of the blade, cutting his
finger. Razor-sharp. The executioner holds up his
bloody thumb.
(CONTINUED)
55.
59
CONTINUED:
59
The crowd roars approval. And turns to regard the day's
victim as he is rolled INTO VIEW.
D'Artagnan stands, half-naked, his hands bound behind him,
in a horse-drawn cart. The driver turns the cart, begins
a circuit of the square. The blood-thirsty crowd cheers
and jeers at d'Artagnan. But d'Artagnan keeps his head
high. If he must die, he will die with dignity.
60
TOWER OF BASTILLE
60
Rochefort watches from a tower overlooking the square.
Richelieu appears beside him.
ROCHEFORT
Milady left at midnight.
By
private coach.
RICHELIEU
A remarkable woman. The most
beautiful I've ever known. And
the deadliest. Which would
explain my attraction.
(peering down at
the scene)
How is our young daredevil holding
up?
ROCHEFORT
He's wishing he'd never heard of
the Musketeers.
Down below, the horse cart reaches the scaffold. A man-
at-arms drops the tailgate, d'Artagnan steps down. He is
taken into the custody of a CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS, and
several men-at-arms carrying muskets.
61
ANOTHER ANGLE
61
The Cardinal's familiar carriage is parked a safe distance
from the square. The Guards who attend it have wandered
off to watch the festivities. The coachman remains,
seated on top, braiding his whip. Suddenly, a gloved hand
grabs the coachman, yanks him from his seat.
62
SCAFFOLD
62
D'Artagnan is led by the Captain of the Guards up the
stairs to the execution platform. The executioner and
the Priest wait patiently above. D'Artagnan sees the
bloodstained block where his neck will soon lie; pales.
The Priest mutters comfort:
(CONTINUED)
56.
62
CONTINUED:
62
PRIEST
Fear not, my son...
D'Artagnan regards the Priest whose face is hidden be-
neath the brim of his broad black hat. He holds a
large Bible in his hands.
PRIEST
For we are with you, always.
The Priest raises his face, reveals it... and winks.
It
is Aramis. He whispers:
ARAMIS
All for one, and one for all...
D'Artagnan's heart soars. He turns to face the execu-
tioner. Porthos grins beneath the hood's overhang.
CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
Prepare the prisoner.
Porthos lays his axe aside, approaches d'Artagnan in a
threatening manner. He takes him by the scruff of the
neck, and forces his head upon the chopping block. The
crowd goes wild.
PORTHOS
(whispers into his
ear)
Don't worry, boy. You won't
feel a thing.
The Captain of the Guards gives Aramis a suspicious look.
CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
Where is Father Rostand today?
ARAMIS
The good father is... all tied up.
CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
Very well.
Proceed.
Porthos nods.
63
ANOTHER ANGLE
63
Meanwhile, on the perimeter of the square, two figures
ride on horseback, they wear familiar cloaks. A CLOSER
look reveals Queen Anne and Constance. They ride through
the city, towards the countryside beyond. But their
progress has led them here. Anne frowns at the spectacle.
(CONTINUED)
57.
63

63
ANNE
Barbarism.
CONSTANCE
Men call it justice.
ANNE
Are you surprised?
She replies
with contempt, reins her horse away from the
square, the
crowd, the executioner's axe. But Constance
freezes in
place, eyes wide. As d'Artagnan, upon the
cart, rolls
INTO VIEW.
CONSTANCE
It's him.
For just a moment, their eyes lock. Inestimable space
between. Constance's eyes fill with tears, she watches
d'Artagnan. Porthos steps back from d'Artagnan, raises
his axe. D'Artagnan shuts his eyes, wonders, mutters a
silent prayer. That's when screams of panic erupt from
the crowd. D'Artagnan raises his head to see the source
of this mayhem.
64
MARKET SQUARE
64
The Cardinal's crimson carriage races toward the scaffold,
scattering the crowd in all directions. Men shout, women
scream, all leaping to avoid the stallion's sharp hooves,
the coach's THUNDEROUS spinning WHEELS. In the driver's
seat, clutching the reins in one hand and CRACKING a WHIP
in the other... is Athos.
Porthos uses the heavy blunt end of the axe to topple the
closest men-at-arms. Aramis opens his Bible, pulls out
a PISTOL, and BLASTS the saber from the hand of the
Captain of the Guards. A man-at-arms raises his musket
to shoot the false priest, but d'Artagnan leaps out of
nowhere, lands on him with both feet, knocking the man-
at-arms off the scaffold.
65
CARRIAGE
65
Athos pulls up alongside the scaffold.
ATHOS
(the usual dour
expression, but a
hint of levity)
Gentlemen, your carriage.
Compliments of the Cardinal.
(CONTINUED)
58.
65
CONTINUED:
65
D'Artagnan rushes to the edge of the scaffold, springs
into the air, landing on the seat beside him. Aramis and
Porthos shed their disguises, jump after, light upon the
carriage. The roof fabric tears, they drop into the
plush interior below. Athos CRACKS the WHIP... and the
stallions race off through the crowd, towards freedom.
66
SQUARE
66
Constance watches the escape, transfixed, delighted. As
the carriage barrels from the scaffold, she thrusts a
gloved fist into the air, triumphant.
CONSTANCE
Yes!
67
TOWER
67
But the Cardinal looks on with horror.
RICHELIEU
My carriage.

CARRIAGE

Athos produces a dagger, cuts the leather ties that bind
d'Artagnan's wrists.
ATHOS
Hold on!
Athos cracks the whip, driving the horses onward.

The carriage charges up a steep hill. At the summit, Athos
tosses aside his bottle, takes the reins from d'Artagnan.
(CONTINUED)

72
D'Artagnan sighs with relief. Athos yanks the brake
lever, brings the horses to a halt, and leaps down from
the driver's seat. D'Artagnan follows. Athos pulls the
passenger door open, revealing Porthos and Aramis inside.
Gold coins on the carpet at their feet, food and drink
between them.
ATHOS
Gentlemen, this is the end of the
line. I hope you had a pleasant
ride.
(to d'Artagnan)
Unhitch the horses.
D'ARTAGNAN
But the Guards.
D'Artagnan points to the bottom of the hill.
The mounted
Guards chase after, begin their ascent.
ATHOS
Do as I say.
D'Artagnan hurries to the horses. Porthos and Aramis
climb from the cab. Porthos emits a contented belch.
ATHOS
(to Aramis)
Your pistol and powder, please.
Aramis hands Athos a sack of powder, and his pistol.
Athos tosses the sack into the carriage, takes aim with
the PISTOL, and SHOOTS it -- igniting the powder inside.
ATHOS
Stand back.
The interior of the Cardinal's carriage bursts into
flames.
73
BOTTOM OF HILL
73
D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers mount the Cardinal's
white stallions, race off into the distance. Porthos
shouts, laughing.
PORTHOS
I'd give five years of your life
just to see the Cardinal's face!
ARAMIS
Ten!
CUT TO:
62.
74
RICHELIEU'S FACE
74
The Cardinal's face is contorted in fury. He
steps out of
a horse cart, approaches the charred remains
of his be-
loved carriage. He stares at the smouldering
ruin for a
long beat. Rochefort and a company of Guards
stand near-
by, wait for him to speak. When he does, his
tone is
measured and calm.
RICHELIEU
One thousand pistoles on each of
their heads, dead or alive. The
boy knows our plans.
Rochefort reacts with surprise.
CUT TO:
75
75
D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers rest against tree
trunks in a hidden glade, polish off the last of the
Cardinal's food and drink. Their usual cynicism replaced
by something approaching camaraderie. Aramis smiles as
d'Artagnan attacks a turkey wing.
D'ARTAGNAN
I haven't eaten in three days.
I guess with all the excitement,
I forgot.
ARAMIS
Your trip from home has been an
eventful one.
D'ARTAGNAN
(he can't quite
believe it)
Three days.
PORTHOS
I heard of a d'Artagnan once. He
was a captain in the Musketeers
when we were just recruits.
D'ARTAGNAN
He was my father.
ARAMIS
A good man, I'm told.
PORTHOS
I knew there was something
familiar about this boy.
(CONTINUED)
63.
75
CONTINUED:
75
D'ARTAGNAN
(sadly)
He died when I was nine.
The mention of the elder d'Artagnan's death casts a pall.
D'Artagnan continues, tentative, the memory still hurts.
D'ARTAGNAN
All my mother would tell me is
that he died in the service of
the King.
An uncomfortable silence.
It is Athos who finally speaks:
ATHOS
D'Artagnan, your father and another
Musketeer were ambushed and
murdered outside the Louvre.
D'Artagnan pales, stunned and silent.
He manages a
broken whisper:
D'ARTAGNAN
This other Musketeer -- is he
still alive? I'd like to talk
to him.
Athos shakes his head.
Porthos adds:
PORTHOS
You already have. His name is
the Count De Rochefort.
D'Artagnan isn't listening. He stands suddenly, turns,
and walks away. He doesn't want the Musketeers to see
the tears forming in his eyes. Aramis shouts after:
ARAMIS
D'Artagnan.
CUT TO:
76

D'Artagnan stands at a flowing stream, wipes the tears
from his eyes. Aramis appears at his side, offers silent
comfort, a hand on d'Artagnan's shoulder.

I imagined his death a hundred
time.

D'ARTAGNAN (CONT'D)
On a battlefield, defending
his King. Fighting bravely for
France. And now... I will find
the man who murdered my father
and kill him where he stands.
ARAMIS
A man is better measured by his
life than by his death. Your
father was bold, and brave.
D'ARTAGNAN
But you never knew him...
ARAMIS
He lives in you.
That's all the evidence Aramis requires.
D'Artagnan
pauses to reflect. Then wonders:
D'ARTAGNAN
And your father?
ARAMIS
I was orphaned at a young age.
The church took me in.
D'ARTAGNAN
You didn't have one.
ARAMIS
But I did. He was a great man,
a leader of the church. And his
example inspired me to dedicate
my life to God's service.
Aramis opens his cloak, reveals a priestly cloth.
A
secret he carries near to his heart.
D'ARTAGNAN
You were a priest...
ARAMIS
I was a fool.
(eyes on the cool
water)
This great man, this father,
betrayed the church, and turned
his back on God. To worship power
and gold.

ARAMIS (CONT'D)

It broke my heart to see it.
D'ARTAGNAN
And you became a Musketeer.
ARAMIS
I joined the Musketeers and a
strange thing happened. I got my
faith back.
D'ARTAGNAN
But who was that man...
ARAMIS
(turns to face him)
All of France knows him. His
Eminence, the Cardinal Richelieu.
D'Artagnan nearly jumps from his boots.
CUT TO:
77
77
Richelieu stands on the roof
of the Palais, lost in
thought.
He looks down and
sees, through the smoke and
mist, the silent rooftops of
Paris, pointed, innumerable.
Richelieu turns, and crosses
to an elaborate pigeon coop.
Servants attach messages to
the legs of carrier pigeons.
Rochefort steps INTO VIEW, anxious, out of breath.
ROCHEFORT
(bowing)
Your Eminence. The Musketeers
have been sighted riding north
on the road to Calais.
Richelieu nods, he already knows.
He picks up one of
the pigeons, strokes it gently.
RICHELIEU
Don't worry. Thanks to our winged
friends, every mercenary and
bounty hunter in France will be
waiting for them.
(with a smile)
Isn't modern communication a
wonderful thing?

The three Musketeers gather around d'Artagnan, listen to
his story. In mid-telling:
D'ARTAGNAN
... I couldn't hear it clearly,
I was standing by the door, the
voices were low --
PORTHOS
Go on.
D'ARTAGNAN
The Cardinal sent someone to
England. With a secret treaty.
ARAMIS
What?
D'ARTAGNAN
He's made an alliance with a man
named, Bucking... Buckingham.
The Musketeers look at each other with alarm.
PORTHOS
The Duke of Buckingham?
D'ARTAGNAN
(nodding)
Do you know him?
ARAMIS
He rules England the way Richelieu
rules France.
D'ARTAGNANj
A ship called the Persephone waits
for the Cardinal's agent at
Calais. To take him to England.
Tuesday, midnight.
ARAMIS
(figuring)
Calais is over two hundred leagues
from here...

PORTHOS
This messenger and the treaty will
prove the Cardinal a traitor. If
we can get our hands on them.
D'ARTAGNAN
What are we waiting for, let's go.
ATHOS
Wait.
Athos stops their exuberant plots and plans with a
single word. All turn, wonder.
ATHOS
(as always, the
bottom line)
Does the Cardinal know you have
this information?
D'ARTAGNAN
Yes.
ATHOS
Then he knows we have it too. And
he'll do everything in his power
to stop us.
PORTHOS
But with three men trying, one
of us might be able to make it.
D'ARTAGNAN
Four.
Bold words. D'Artagnan matures by leaps and bounds.
Athos almost smiles.

Fog drifts across
a lonely stretch of road. Suddenly:
pounding HOOFBEATS
come over the scene. MUSIC SWELLS.
And galloping out
of the fog come d'Artagnan and the
three Musketeers,
riding hell-for-leather. HOLD ON this
heroic tableau for
a long beat.
80
80
Four rough-looking MERCENARIES crouch on a low bridge
spanning a shallow stream. They are armed with muskets
and swords. The Mercenaries wait in the darkness, whisper
eagerly among themselves.
(CONTINUED)

One of them hisses for silence, all conversation ends.
And the sound of HOOFBEATS is heard in the distance.
Faint, but growing closer.
MERCENARY
Shoot low. We'll need their
heads for identification.
The Mercenaries raise their muskets, take aim. Right on
cue, four horsemen come THUNDERING out of the mist. But
just before they reach the bridge, the four horsemen
break in half -- one pair rides to the left, the other to
the right. Before the Mercenaries realize what's
happened, the horsemen ride on either side, splashing
through the shallow stream. In a flash, they return to
the road, and race away. Having avoided the bridge
completely.
Cursing, the angry Mercenaries whirl about, FIRE at
d'Artagnan and the three Musketeers as they ride into
the night. Porthos' merry laugh drifts back to mock them.
CUT TO:

81
An overturned wagon lies in the ditch. Beer kegs litter
the roadway. The wagon's driver, an old FARMER, sits on
one of the kegs, holding his head. D'Artagnan and the
Musketeers gallop INTO VIEW, rein their horses to a stop.
FARMER
(with relief)
Thank God for a friendly face.
My horse broke loose. Can you
help me move these kegs out of
the road?
D'Artagnan starts to dismount.
ATHOS
Stay on your horse.
D'ARTAGNAN
He needs our help.
ATHOS
Don't worry.
We'll help him.
Suddenly: two other men step before the wagon, pointing
muskets. The ragged Farmer reaches inside his coat, pulls
out a pistol, makes a smirking request:
(CONTINUED)
69.
81
CONTINUED:
81
FARMER
Won't you step down... Musketeers?
ARAMIS
Gentlemen, I beg you. Please put
away your weapons and remove these
kegs from the road. We'd prefer
to ride on without having to kill
you.
D'Artagnan and the "Farmers" gape at Aramis in surprise.
FARMER
You're threatening us?
PORTHOS
It's not a threat, it's a fact.
If you don't haul those kegs away,
you're dead where you stand.
The Farmer laughs, contemptuously. He raises his pistol
and aims it at Porthos' head. But before he can pull the
trigger, THREE EXPLOSIONS ERUPT from under the cloaks of
Athos, Porthos and Aramis.
When the smoke clears, d'Artagnan is startled to see the
three dead "Farmers" sprawled in the road and the three
pistols emerging from beneath the cloaks of the
Musketeers.
PORTHOS
Mine hit the ground first.
ATHOS
Mine was taller.
Aramis swings out of the saddle and begins to perform
last rites over the bodies. D'Artagnan still can't be-
lieve what just happened. He turns to Porthos. Porthos
raises the barrel to his lips and blows away the gunsmoke.
PORTHOS
There's only one rule, d'Artagnan
-- stay alive.
THUNDER RUMBLES and RAINS begins to fall.
CUT TO:

87
The sun rises, casts long shadows across a sparkling dew-
wet field. D'Artagnan and the Musketeers ride INTO
FRAME, continuing their journey to Calais. D'Artagnan
squints ahead, wincing with every bump. Porthos grins.
PORTHOS
Beautiful morning, eh, d'Artagnan?
D'Artagnan is terribly hung-over from the night's
carousing. He looks like he could puke at any moment.
So that's exactly why Porthos shouts to him and says...
PORTHOS
You know,
d'Artagnan, it's not a
good idea
to travel on an empty
stomach.
You really should have
had a big
portion of those sheep's
brains...
D'Artagnan covers his mouth.
Porthos laughs good-
naturedly.
D'ARTAGNAN
My head feels like it's filled
with the King's marching band.
Would you please stop whistling?
(CONTINUED)
80.
87
CONTINUED:
87
PORTHOS
Whistling?
I'm not whistling.
D'ARTAGNAN
Well someone is.
PORTHOS
(to others)
The Barmaid's kiss left him dizzy.
ARAMIS
I hear it too. It sounds like...
ATHOS
(knows immediatley)
A connon ball.
Athos is cut off by an EAR-PIERCING WHISTLE as a CANNON
BALL drops out of the sky and STRIKES the ground nearby,
sending up a tremendous EXPLOSION.
PORTHOS
I hate cannon balls.
Another BALL EXPLODES into the ground in front of them.
Their horses rear up in fear, threatening to dump them
out of their saddles. As the Musketeers and d'Artagnan
struggle to control their horses, they look back and see
an old castle atop a distant hill.
A group of men operate two rusted cannons, left over from
some long-forgotten war.
The Musketeers barely calm their horses, when another
BALL comes SCREAMING their way, IMPACTING a few feet
away. As dirt rains upon them:
ARAMIS
(to d'Artagnan)
How's your head now?
D'ARTAGNAN
I'm beginning to wish the Cardinal
had chopped if off.
ATHOS
Stay with us, and you just might
get your wish.
Athos spurs his horse across the field, d'Artagnan and
the Musketeers follow. But they discover crude battle-
ments in their path. Athos changes direction, sees six
horsemen waiting for them in the near distance. He
changes direction again, as the horsemen charge after.

They ride as fast their mounts will carry them. A cross-
roads up ahead. Athos sizes up the situation, shouts
command.
ATHOS
Split in half! D'Artagnan rides
with me!
D'Artagnan nods, thrilled to go with Athos.
ARAMIS
We'll see you in Calais!
ATHOS
Or hell!
Athos and d'Artagnan take off in one direction, Porthos
and Aramis in the other. The pursuing horsemen soon
race INTO VIEW, break in half to give chase.

Infantry troops drill outside the King's palace, prac-

Porthos and Aramis ride hard, look back over their
shoulders. They crest the top of a bluff, rein their
horses to a stop. They can afford to rest for a moment.
Their pursuit is at least a mile behind them.
ARAMIS
My horse will not survive another
league.
PORTHOS
And you?
ARAMIS
(in kind)
Ten, twenty at the most.
Porthos looks into the near distance, manages a weary
smile.
(CONTINUED)

PORTHOS
Here's just the thing.
A nice,
relaxing boat ride.
At the bottom of the hill: a crude ferry lands at the
bank of a swift, choppy river.
CUT TO:
94
94
The ferry is an open flatboat -- a wooden platform, about
fifteen-by-twenty feet. It travels from one shore to the
other by means of a ferry rope. Transport is slow, the
trip to the other shore takes nearly five minutes.
As Porthos and Aramis arrive, the flatboat is just re-
turning, piloted by its FERRYMAN, a hunched and weather-
beaten gnome. Four passengers wait to be carried across
-- TWO GENTLEMAN CAVALIERS on horseback, and a country
WOMAN and her child. As the flatboat enters its slip,
the two Cavaliers urge their horses on board, rudely
jostling the Woman and her child to the rear.
The Ferryman, an experienced boot-licker, bows and
scrapes to the Cavaliers, collects the coins they toss
to his way.
FERRYMAN
A privilege to carry you on my
humble boat...
The Ferryman turns a greedy eye on the Woman and child.
FERRYMAN
Two pistoles.
WOMAN
But I only have one. Couldn't
my child ride free? She's so
small...
FERRYMAN
(hand outstretched,
demanding)
Two pistoles.
A courtly voice intervenes.
ARAMIS
Put away your money, madame. You
and your child will cross the
river under our protection. For
free.
(CONTINUED)
90.
94
CONTINUED:
94
All turn to regard Aramis on horseback, Porthos at his
side. The Woman reacts with grateful surprise. The
Ferryman is outraged, spittle flies as he curses and
protests.
FERRYMAN
Nobody rides for free! Under
your protection bloody well
indeed! I'll teach you a thing
or two about protection! Apple-
cheeked young fools!! -- Just who
do you think you are!!
ARAMIS
(waits for the
tirade to cease;
simply)
Musketeers.
Two two Cavaliers react to the word. The Ferryman does,
too -- into cringing, obedient servant.
FERRYMAN
Musketeers? Well, why didn't you
say so? Of course you'll ride for
free. I insist on it. This way,
pretty madame. My what a lovely
little girl...
ARAMIS
Porthos!
PORTHOS
What?
Aramis takes Porthos by the shoulder and turns him so
he can see their pursuers pouring over the top of the
hill on their horses.
PORTHOS
We sail!
And with that, Porthos takes the sharp edge of his boom-
erang and brings it down on the dock rope. The rope
splits and the ferryboat lurches away from the dock.
95
HILL AND SHORE
95
The pursuers charge down the hill and ride to the end of
the dock but they're too late. Porthos and Aramis have
gotten away.
91.
96
FLATBOAT

Porthos laughs and taunts the angry pursuers. Aramis
ties scarves around the horses' eyes to blindfold them
for the crossing. Then he turns around and sees what
Aramis is already seeing -- the two Cavaliers watch them
with keen interest.
FIRST CAVALIER
You're those Musketeers everyone's
been looking for.
PORTHOS
Popularity has its price.
The First Cavalier smiles, produces a flask.
FIRST CAVALIER
I have some excellent brandy here.
Would you gentlemen care to drink
a toast with us to the Cardinal?
PORTHOS
We'd be happy to.
Porthos produces a bottle from under his cloak.
PORTHOS
If you'll drink one with us to
the King.
SECOND CAVALIER
But the only King we recognize...
is the Cardinal.
ARAMIS
There are those who would call
that treason.
FIRST CAVALIER
Happily, no such objections have
been raised... here.
PORTHOS
All right.
I'll object.
SECOND CAVALIER
I'm listening.
PORTHOS
Let's see. You are, by your dress
and by your manner, members of a
bone-lazy class of servile ninnyhammers
whose slavish allegiance to His
Eminence the Cardinal is as that
of a dog who likes nothing better
than to sniff today where he has
peed the day before.

PORTHOS (CONT'D)

Piss is piss, no matter what robes

ARAMIS
Well said. I'm impressed.
Ninnyhammers.
PORTHOS
I was momentarily inspired.
The Cavaliers are not amused. The first replies in
measured tones, his lips white with fury.
FIRST CAVALIER
May I reply?
ARAMIS
(courtly)
By all means.
FIRST CAVALIER
Better to be a dog in the service
of a great master, than a beef-
witted moron so dazzled by the
throne that he does not see the
true nature of the foolish boy
who wobbles atop it. Which is to
say, that most muddy-brained of
all men... a Musketeer.
The Cavaliers have already pulled out their swords.
Porthos and Aramis now reach for their own. Porthos
deadpans:
PORTHOS
Maybe there's something
about us
that just pisses people
off. At
least I'd like to think
so. It's
too bad we can only kill
them
once.
97
FIGHT
97
The middle of a river on a rocking flatboat is not the
best place for a duel. But the combatants make the most
of it. Slipping, sliding, and falling. They attack with
everything they've got. The Cavaliers are excellent
swordsmen. And, as if that were not enough, the
Musketeers have an additional disadvantage -- they must
keep the Woman and child clear of the flashing blades.
(CONTINUED)
93.
97
CONTINUED:
97
Porthos drives his opponent about the flatboat with a
devilish grin, chases him between -- and at one point,
over -- blindfolded horses.
Aramis duels with the expected artistry, gradually re-
ducing his opponent to tatters. At one juncture, the
child loses her footing, slides toward the low end of
the flatboat, the deep river beyond. Aramis executes a
neat sidestep, stops the child's desperate progress with
one arm while continuing to do battle with the other.
He returns child to Mother with a grin, continues.
The two Cavaliers are soon vanquished, groaning on the
flatboat deck. Porthos and Aramis meet at the middle,
breathless. Porthos complains:
PORTHOS
I've been called a lot of things
in my time...
ARAMIS
(eyes on the
opposite shore)
Porthos...
PORTHOS
But beef-witted is a little more
than I can stand, not to mention
unfair...
ARAMIS
Porthos...
PORTHOS
What?
Aramis indicates the opposite shore as the flatboat
approaches it. There, waiting patiently, swords and
muskets already drawn... is a patrol of Cardinal's
Guards.
ARAMIS
Can you swim?
PORTHOS
(doesn't like the
sound of this)
No.
My horse can.
ARAMIS
That'll do.
PORTHOS
But...?
(CONTINUED)

Aramis hurries to
his horse, takes off the blindfold.
Porthos grumbles
after, follows suit. They leap atop
their mounts, the
horses slip upon the wet deck as they
guide them to the
edge.
ARAMIS
You go first and I'll watch your
progress.
PORTHOS
No, no.
Please. After you.
Stalemate. Then, they can't help it, Aramis and Porthos
grin. Life is an adventure, lived to the fullest. They
count...
ARAMIS AND PORTHOS
One, two -- three!
And with that, as the Woman and child, the Ferryman look
on, Aramis and Porthos guide their horses into the raging
river. The Woman whispers after:
WOMAN
Thank you.
God speed.
Porthos manages a wink as he floats into the distance.

The Cardinal's Guards react with anger and disbelief.

RIVER
99
A wild ride down the ROARING RIVER. Porthos clinging to
his horse for dear life. Aramis keeping an eye on his
fellow Musketeer... and the deep rapids up ahead.
Through twists and turns, walls of white water, huge
boulders, and gyrating whirlpools... Aramis and Porthos
finally reach a quiet pool, a leafy shore beyond. They
lead their horses from the water, step toward dry land...
and see yet another (or perhaps the same) patrol of
Cardinal's Guards. Waiting, swords drawn, for their
arrival.
Porthos looks down at his latest sash -- destroyed like
the others. Aramis draws his saber, mutters.
ARAMIS
A nice relaxing boat ride...

Cool, clear water. WIDEN to reveal d'Artagnan and Athos
at a shallow pond, watering their horses. The forest
around them is dark and primeval.
D'ARTAGNAN
Do you think we've lost them?
ATHOS
They'll catch up eventually.
To the point, as always. D'Artagnan pauses to look at
their beautiful surroundings, remembers:
D'ARTAGNAN
My father used to hunt in a forest
like this. He promised to take me
on my tenth birthday. I don't know
why he picked that year. Something
about a boy becoming a man. I'd
lay in bed at night and imagine it,
just the two of us. But he died
before I could go with him.
Athos is unmoved, or so it would seem.
He replies with
quiet cynicism:
ATHOS
Well. You have your boyhood wish
at last. The dark forest. The
thrill of the hunt. The nearness
of death.
Only d'Artagnan is the hunted, not the hunter.
D'ARTAGNAN
I'd be proud to die for my King.
ATHOS
I just wanted to save you from the
life of a Musketeer. You don't
have to go looking for experience,
d'Artagnan. It'll find you soon
enough. And when it does -- it
will mark you forever.
Athos rides into the forest.
D'Artagnan hurries to
follow.
CUT TO:
96.
101

Athos leads d'Artagnan through the forest. Sunbeams
shoot down through thick branches like golden bars. A
pastoral setting, almost peaceful. And then: THUNDERING
HOOFBEATS. Athos and d'Artagnan turn in surprise, see
SIX HORSEMEN CRASHING through the glade.
102
ANOTHER ANGLE
102
Athos and d'Artagnan GALLOP through the dense forest.
The horesmen FIRE PISTOLS as they ride. A SHOT grazes
d'Artagnan's shoulder, he staggers, retains his mount.
Athos leads them up a hillside, a series of boulders at
the top. The climb is fast and treacherous, GUNFIRE all
around them. Athos' horse is struck by a bullet, stag-
gers forward... and collapses just as they reach the
crest. D'Artagnan leaps off his horse, takes cover with
Athos behind the boulders. Athos takes aim, FIRES a
SHOT, and kills one of the horsemen below. The others
curse, leap from their mounts, seek cover. SHOTS WHIZ
back and forth like angry hornets.
Stalemate, but not for long. They are badly outnumbered.
The horsemen creep slowly up the hillside, from tree to
tree. Athos turns to d'Artagnan as he reloads:
ATHOS
I'll hold them off for as long as
I can. Go on without me.
D'ARTAGNAN
I can't leave you here. Not like
this.
ATHOS
Ride to Calais and stop the
Cardinal's agent.
D'ARTAGNAN
Athos... I can't.
Athos points his pistol at d'Artagnan.
ATHOS
Go, or I'll kill you myself.
A few days ago, d'Artagnan would have obeyed without
question. Fearful, if nothing else. But not here, not
now.
D'ARTAGNAN
A duel then.

ATHOS
You're insane.
D'ARTAGNAN
We never finished the first.
ATHOS
All right. I'll toss a coin.
Tails I stay, heads you remain.
Agreed?
D'Artagnan nods. Athos FIRES off another SHOT. He
produces a gold coin, flips, slams it between palm and
hand. And looks between.
103
ATHOS AND HIS POV
103
Heads. D'Artagnan is to remain.
Athos looks up without
missing a beat.
ATHOS
Tails.
I stay.
Athos returns the coin to his doublet without giving
d'Artagnan a chance to see.
D'ARTAGNAN
But...?
Athos reloads, FIRES below. D'Artagnan recognizes the
kindness he has received. That Athos cannot fully express
it. And that there is no use arguing with him.
D'ARTAGNAN
At least take my pistol.
He gives it to Athos.
They clasp hands.
ATHOS
(gruff; yet proud)
Don't let us down... Musketeer.
There are tears in d'Artagnan's eyes.
He knows Athos
hasn't got a chance.
D'ARTAGNAN
(a choke of emotion)
I'll never forget you.
ATHOS
Go!
Athos turns away, SHOOTS at another horseman.
D'Artagnan
runs to his MOUNT, GALLOPS away.
98.
104
D'ARTAGNAN

He rides, straining to hear the sounds of GUNFIRE. As

Abruptly... the SHOTS CEASE.
D'Artagnan swallows his heart, and rides.

A lonely stretch of road, illuminated by moonlight. A
signpost announces: CALAI 15 LEAGUES. An exhausted
HORSE CLOPS INTO VIEW, its rider half-conscious in the
saddle. It is d'Artagnan. He can barely keep his eyes
open. Suddenly, d'Artagnan passes out, tumbles from
his saddle, and lands in the middle of the road. He
opens his eyes once -- a sky filled with stars -- then
closes them.
We hear HORSES, and the CREAK of a CARRIAGE APPROACHING.
The DRIVER brakes, and the horses are brought to a halt
just short of trampling d'Artagnan. In the darkness, we
can make out other shapes, rugged men on horseback,
bodyguards to the carriage's passenger. Milady de
Winter.
MILADY (O.S.)
What is it, Henri?
HENRI (DRIVER)
There's a body in the road, Milady.
MILADY (O.S.)
Be careful.
Pistols are cocked.
Henri's shadow falls across
d'Artagnan's body.
HENRI
It's a young man. He appears to
be injured.
We hear the CARRIAGE DOOR OPEN.
FOOTSTEPS to d'Artagnan's
side.
MILADY (O.S.)
My, what a handsome boy. Put him

Strong hands grasp d'Artagnan and lift him from the cold
ground.

Out of the darkness, a face appears,
BLURRY and OBSCURED.
It FILLS the SCREEN, slowly swimming
INTO FOCUS. It is
Milady de Winter, even more beautiful
in CLOSEUP.
Familiar, and no doubt deadly, ivory
combs gleam in her
hair. She smiles warmly.
MILADY
Welcome back.
Did you dream?
107
ANOTHER ANGLE
107
reveals the interior of a bed chamber at a roadside inn.
D'Artagnan, regaining his senses, finds himself propped
up in a large bed. He blinks into the face of Milady
who sits at the edge. His eyes widen with recognition,
faint awe.
D'ARTAGNAN
You.
MILADY
Have we met?
D'ARTAGNAN
I... saw you in Paris.
D'Artagnan notices that his shoulder has been bandaged.
He looks around the large room. A FIRE ROARS in the
grate. Food and drink have been set upon a table.
D'Artagnan continues, still groggy, uncertain:
D'ARTAGNAN
Where am I...?
MILADY
This is Calais.
D'ARTAGNAN
(with a jolt)
Calais!
(muttered; to self)
The ship... Tuesday at midnight...
D'Artagnan leaps out of bed. Then realizes he is stark
naked. Milady smiles. D'Artagnan gathers a bedsheet
around him.
D'ARTAGNAN

D'Artagnan runs to a window, and throws open the shutters.
Beyond: the harbor lights of the Port of Calais.
MILADY
It's Tuesday, near nine.
D'ARTAGNAN
Nine?
Are you sure?
Somewhere in the night, a BELL TOLLS the HOUR.
Milady
smiles.
MILADY
Quite sure.
D'Artagnan relaxes slightly.
Milady rises from the bed.
She wears a sky blue dressing
gown, something soft and
silken beneath it. D'Artagnan
reacts perceptibly. En-
joying his discomfort, Milady
crosses the room, joins
him at the window.
MILADY
Are you in a hurry?
D'ARTAGNAN
(after a beat)
How did I... get here?
MILADY
I found you in the road.
Discarded. Like an unwanted
kitten. Do you have a name or
shall I make one up for you?
D'ARTAGNAN
(nervous)
My name is d'Artagnan.
MILADY
D'Artagnan. I like that. I am
the Countess de Winter. Milady.

hint of danger. All in a single reply. D'Artagnan
hesitates, he is not immune to her charms, then:
D'ARTAGNAN
Countess, I'm very grateful for
what you've done, but I can't stay
here. I've got...
MILADY
What...?
D'ARTAGNAN
Important business.
MILADY
How mysterious. A handsome young
man with 'important business' in
the still of night. Does it
involve a young lady?
D'ARTAGNAN
No.
MILADY
Does it require clothes?
D'ARTAGNAN
Yes.
I need my clothes.
MILADY
They won't be ready for at least
an hour.
D'ARTAGNAN
An hour?
MILADY
I told the
innkeeper to bring them
when they
are dry. Until then,
I'm afraid
you are my prisoner.
Would the
prisoner care for a
drink?
Milady crosses to the table, food and drink upon it. As
she passes by the fire, her dressing gown seems to disap-
pear, revealing a silhouette that makes d'Artagnan's
heart stop.

Milady pours wine into glasses, turns to face him.
And

MILADY
Good. Then we will sit by the
fire, and eat and drink, and you
may impress, perhaps even move me,
with the story of how you came to
lie unconscious, in the middle of
the night, on the road to Calais.

I love a good adventure.
D'Artagnan hesitates, then steps to her.

The lights of the harbor are muted by low-hanging fog.
We see the outline of a ship waiting at the pier. Henri

Milady's bodyguards dismount, six of them. A motley
bunch of sinister killers. They look around the pier,
ready for any encounter.
D'Artagnan takes in his surroundings.
There is a mel-
ancholy air about him.
MILADY
What's the matter, d'Artagnan?
Still hoping for your friends to
ride to the rescue?
D'ARTAGNAN
My friends are dead.
MILADY
Well. If it's any consolation,
you'll soon be joining them.
Milady's return to form does not surprise. Parker shoves
d'Artagnan toward the fog-enshrouded ship. A name can be
made out on her barnacled hull. Persephone.

Henri calls out to the ship, which is little more than an
outline in the fog, her boarding gangplank leading to
the soupy darkness of her deck.
HENRI
We are the Countess de Winter's
party, arrived from Paris.
Permission to come aboard.
There is no reply.
Closely guarded by Parker, d'Artagnan
strains to see.

VOICE (O.S.)
Permission granted.
Milady nods to Henri. He steps up the narrow gangplank,
followed by Milady, d'Artagnan, Parker, and the six
bodyguards.
CUT TO:
119
119
The deck is filled with swirling fog. Henri peers into
the gloom as he climbs aboard, followed by the others.
He addresses one of the crew, a tall figure standing
nearby.
HENRI
Take us to your captain.
The tall figure does not reply, nor does he move.
Henri
demands:
HENRI
What are you, deaf?
Henri goes to shake the man. He grabs his arm, and the
man pitches forward, falling face first on the deck.
Henri jumps back in alarm. Milady and the others react.
BODYGUARD
What is this?
Milady's Bodyguards rush around the deck, confront the
other silent silhouettes. They, like the tall figure...
are dead. The limp bodies topple at their touch. The
Bodyguards shout alarm and panic:
BODYGUARDS
Dead!
They're all dead!
PORTHOS (O.S.)
Well I certainly hope so. After
all that hard work.
That's when Porthos, and Aramis -- come swooping down
from above like avenging angels. They swing on the ends
of ropes, slicing through the air, then dropping feet
first on top of Milady's Bodyguards. D'Artagnan stands
open-mouthed, as his three friends draw their swords.
ARAMIS
(calling to him)
You look like you've seen a ghost.

D'ARTAGNAN
Two of them.
PORTHOS
Remind me to tell you the story
of horses that could fly above
raging waters. A heroic tale of
love, death, and Musketeers.
Suitable for the general public.
Porthos wades into the Bodyguards, at play, shouting as
he goes.
PORTHOS
All right then. All those who
wish to die, raise your hands!
Don't by shy, there's plenty to
go around!
D'Artagnan grabs a sword from the deck, turns to join
the fray. And finds himself face to face with Parker, the
Indo-Chinese bodyguard. Parker has two Oriental swords
spinning in his hands. One knocks d'Artagnan's sword out
of his hand. D'Artagnan does a back flip but falls on
the slippery deck. As Parker is about to chop
d'Artagnan's head off, his face grimaces as he is lifted
on a sword OUT OF FRAME. In the mist Athos is revealed!
ATHOS
Sorry I'm late. Did I miss
anything?
D'Artagnan almost cries with happiness.
He leaps to his
feet and embraces Athos.
D'ARTAGNAN
I thought you were dead.
ATHOS
Keep your mind on the mission,
d'Artagnan.
He winks at d'Artagnan, returns to the fray. D'Artagnan
follows. The Musketeers confront Milady's evil Bodyguards
in the night and fog. Athos with brutal perfection.
Porthos with strange weapons and a healthy sense of the
absurd. And Aramis with familiar grace and artistry --
and a marked determination to disable, not kill, his
opponents.
Milady views the latter with alarm. As the battle rages
around her, she retreats into the shadows.
(CONTINUED)

Athos and d'Artagnan find themselves fighting side by
side. Athos observes d'Artagnan's technique -- the usual
frenetic windmill of feint and thrust -- with a frown.
ATHOS
Boy, it's a miracle you're still
alive fighting like that.
D'ARTAGNAN
What do you mean?
ATHOS
First, always find your enemy's
weakness. Second, take advantage
of it. Watch me.
One of the Bodyguards, who wears a wooden leg, attacks
Athos. Athos kicks the false leg out from under him,
knocks him to the deck. D'Artagnan repeats, even as he
disables his own foe.
D'ARTAGNAN
Find the weakness. Take advantage.
Got it.
Aramis kneels at a dying man, delivers muttered last
rites. A Bodyguard races INTO VIEW, means to kill him
where he kneels. Aramis doesn't miss a beat -- he shifts,
rises, delivers a punch and kick, knocking the man off the
ship to the water below. A SPLASH is heard. And Aramis
resumes a priestly pose, continues the litany.

Two SAILORS, crew members of the Persephone, return to
the ship after a night's drunk. They see and hear the
mayhem ahead.
SAILOR
That's our ship...
The two Sailors pull out daggers, and bound up the
gangplank.
CUT TO:
121

The two Sailors find themselves in the middle of a wild
battle. They look around for someone to assault, see a
large Musketeer with his back turned. They charge.

Porthos hears them coming, spins. The two Sailors stop
in their tracks, eyes popping with horrified recognition.
BOTH SAILORS
Porthos the Pirate!!
With a collective "yah!" the two Sailors drop their
daggers, and flee into the foggy night. Porthos looks
about to see if anyone noticed their exit. D'Artagnan
grins nearby.
PORTHOS
I told you I was famous.
D'ARTAGNAN
Porthos the Pirate?
PORTHOS
Privateer.
There's a difference.
Every Musketeer is running from something or someone.
D'Artagnan deadpans:
D'ARTAGNAN
I love a good sea story.
Do tell
me sometime.
Porthos reacts to d'Artagnan's jest. But before he can
reply, the youth has bolted back to the fray.

BACK TO SCENE

Athos drives several Bodyguards back with his sword,
notices d'Artagnan working his way towards him.
ATHOS
Did you find the Cardinal's spy?
D'ARTAGNAN
Yes.
ATHOS
Did you kill him?
D'ARTAGNAN
Athos.
The spy... is a woman.

ATHOS
What?
Athos turns to d'Artagnan, wonders. And at that moment,
sees a figure at the gangplank, swathed in fog and diffuse
light. Milady. Time stops as they regard each other
across the deck, the battle between.
ATHOS
No.
Milady turns and runs into the night.
Athos races after.
CUT TO:
124
124
With the speed and grace of a panther, Milady runs down
the gangplank, climbs into the saddle of one of her
Bodyguard's horses, and gallops off. Athos appears
moments later, leaps into the saddle of another horse.
And gives chase.
CUT TO:
125
125
Milady whips her horse, drives it onward. But Athos
overtakes, leaps from his saddle, takes her into his arms.
They fall to the ground with a crash. Milady grabs the
deadly comb from her hair, grips the dagger's handle.
Athos, stunned from breaking their fall, rolls to his
side. Milady peers at his face, vulnerable in the half-
light. And lowers the dagger. She will not kill him.
Milady scrambles to her feet, runs toward a dark forest.
But Athos stands and shouts:
ATHOS
Stop!!
Milady takes a halting step, then turns to face him.
Athos holds his musket in a steady hand. A very long
beat. Milady takes a step closer. Finally, she whispers,
with love, with hate:
MILADY
Athos.
ATHOS
How did you do it, Sabine? How
did you come back from the dead?
(CONTINUED)
116.
125
CONTINUED:
125
MILADY
A kind gentleman took pity on me.
ATHOS
I did not.
MILADY
No, Count. You were too proud to
listen to the truth. I learned
the value of lies soon after.
Athos grips the pistol tighter, as if to ward off the
past and what it brings.
ATHOS
Give me the Cardinal's treaty.
MILADY
No.
ATHOS
Then I will shoot.
Athos cocks the trigger.
Milady whispers:
MILADY
Be kind.
And aim for my heart.
Athos' face is a mask of contradiction. He tries to pull
the trigger, but it is not in him. Milady recognizes
his pain with a nod. She feels it, too. Then, briefly,
before she leaves him, Milady speaks softly. The past,
their love, and where it led them.
MILADY
I remember... everything.
She turns and runs away... directly into the arms of
Armand de Winter. He has ridden, and he has followed,
and he has finally found her here.
ARMAND
Countess de Winter...
As d'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis arrive on the scene...
CUT TO:
126
128
A hundred feet below, waves crash on a rocky shore. On
the jagged cliff above, a black mass of trees is outlined
against a stormy sky filled with copper-colored clouds,
surreal in effect. A sinister procession approaches the
cliff.
Porthos leads Milady. She wears a simple white shift,
her hair pulled back into a long braid. She looks years
younger, the girl she used to be. The Executioner walks
behind them. Followed by Armand de Winter, Aramis,
d'Artagnan. And Athos. He watches every step.
The procession stops at the cliff's edge.
THUNDER RUMBLES. Lightning slashes the sky. The
Executioner ties Milady's hands behind her. The
Executioner removes a bright scimitar from beneath his
cloak. Milady catches Athos' eye. He holds her gaze.
He stares at Milady unflinchingly, as if to burn her
image into his eyes, so that he might keep it there until
the day he dies.
Aramis reaches inside his cloak, removes the sacred
priestly cloth he carries.
(CONTINUED)
120.
128
CONTINUED:
128
The Executioner delivers the formal litany:
EXECUTIONER
I forgive you for your crimes.
Die in peace.
Athos repeats, whispers:
ATHOS
Die in peace.
Aramis comes forward, intones:
ARAMIS
I am the resurrection and the
life, sayeth the Lord. He that
believeth in me, though he were
dead, yet shall he live; and
whosoever liveth and believeth
in me shall never die...
The Executioner's sharp blade shines in the light of
dawn.
EXECUTIONER
On your knees.
Milady kneels, the Executioner steps closer. The tableau
silhouetted against a reddish glow on the horizon. The
Executioner brushes Milady's braid from her neck,
exposing the soft white skin beneath. He raises the
scimitar overhead, and just as he is about to bring it
down... a cry is heard, torn from the heart:
ATHOS
No.
Athos grabs the Executioner's wrist, and twists the
scimitar loose. It falls to the ground.
EXECUTIONER
What's this...?
Porthos leaps forward, locks his great arms around Athos.
PORTHOS
Athos --
But Athos breaks free.
Milady rises to her feet.
Athos
rushes to her.
ATHOS
Forgive me, Sabine.
Please
forgive.

MILADY
I do.
The words he could never say, finally spoken. Milady
locks eyes with him. Athos' desperate act, the pure
feeling it signifies, has given her a kind of release.
And the strength to face her fate.
MILADY
The Cardinal intends to assassinate
the King at his birthday celebration
on Friday.
And with that, Milady reaches forward, offers a gentle
kiss. Then, as Athos and the others look on, stunned,
uncertain... she takes a backward step, finds the
cliff's edge... and steps over it. The Executioner
rushes to look after. The others follow. Except for
Athos, who remains rooted in place, eyes on the
distant horizon. A long silence. THUNDER RUMBLES.
EXECUTIONER
God's justice be done.
D'Artagnan sadly lowers his head. Porthos puts a
consoling hand on his shoulder. Aramis stands to the
other side, mutters:
ARAMIS
Amen.
ATHOS
Musketeers.
D'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis turn. Athos has regained
his former self. Stoic, in command. And hiding a broken
heart.
ATHOS
The King's life in danger.
We
have work to do.

START CLOSE ON the now familiar portrait of King
Louis XIII, usually found hanging behind Richelieu's
desk. A SHOT RINGS OUT -- and a blast tears through
the painting, leaving a smoking hole where the King's
heart should be.

REVEALS Richelieu and Rochefort as they walk across the
roof to the painting, appraise the damage. Thie Cardinal
pokes a long finger into the hole.
RICHELIEU
Impressive.
ROCHEFORT
He can do it every time.
Rochefort signals approval to a solitary marksman
positioned far away on one of the roof parapets. The
marksman rises from a shooter's crouch, bows curtly,
and begins to reload his musket.
RICHELIEU
And he has no qualms about...
ROCHEFORT
None. He believes that man should
honor no Kings before God.
RICHELIEU
A man of faith. How delightful.
(turns back to
the painting)
Whatever you're paying him, double
it. I want the King's birthday to
be a memorable event. And rehang
this painting in my chamber. Just
as it is.
HOLD ON Richelieu for a beat.
Framed by a sky filled
with stars. His evil intent.

D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers thunder through on
horseback. Pedestrians scurry to get out of their way.
As they ride past, Porthos raises a crossbow and fires
it. The arrow slices through the air with a terrible
hum and imbeds itself on the public wall. Attached to
the arrow is a piece of parchment, like the one in
d'Artagnan's father's study. It reads: All For One,
And One For All.

A CAPTAIN in the Cardinal's Guard makes a public
pronouncement from horseback outside a cathedral.
Townspeople are gathered around.
CAPTAIN
... the aforenamed Musketeers are
declared outlaws and are sentenced
to death. Any person sheltering
or aiding them will be hanged --
HOOFBEATS interrupt. The Captain turns in irritation.
And Porthos and Aramis ride to either side, snatch the
man up by the arms, drag him briefly through the air,
and deposit him with a thud against a hitching post.
The Captain, stunned, looks down at the piece of
parchment now attached to his chest. All For One, And
One For All.

The citizens of Paris move through the streets. They
share a common destination, the Palace. A festive mood
is in the air. And why not, it is the King's birthday.
CUT TO:
137
140
The balcony has been colorfully decorated. The crowd
focuses its attention on the empty space where the King
will soon appear. Below, the entrance to the Palace is
protected by a double line of the Cardinal's Guards,
resplendent in their crimson tunics. It would take an
army to get past them.
CUT TO:
141
141
The streets leading to the Palace are clogged with
people, all pushing and straining to get closer.
D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers arrive on horseback,
are forced to dismount. They push through the crowd,
trying to reach the Palace, afraid that they will be too
late. Athos barks orders as they struggle forward:
ATHOS
(to d'Artagnan)
Look through the surrounding area.
We'll try to reach the King...
D'ARTAGNAN
But...?
ATHOS
Go!
Athos and the others press on. D'Artagnan, a little
disappointed to be left behind, pauses, checks the
buildings that loom overhead. Then he starts, reacts
with shock and surprise.
126.
142
D'ARTAGNAN'S POV
142
The bell tower of the Carmes-Deschaux monastery. A
figure moving about, dimly-viewed, but this much is
clear. The man is not a monk. And he is carrying a
musket in his hands.
143
BACK TO SCENE
143
D'Artagnan turns to alert the Musketeers. Too late, they
have already vanished into the throng. D'Artagnan takes
off running for the monastery.

BELL TOWER

HIGH ABOVE the swelling scene. The marksman assumes a
crouching position, raises his musket, and trains it on
the empty balcony where the King is soon to appear.

Louis and Anne lead the procession to the doors of the
balcony. The crowd roars and the TRUMPETS BLARE. The
King steps into the sunlight. The Queen follows, then
Richelieu. The three most important people in France
stand together, acknowledging the clamoring multitudes.
149

The marksman takes careful aim. The cheering down below
is like a faint whisper at this altitude. The marksman
cocks the hammer of his flinklock.
CUT TO:

The BIG BELL makes a resounding, ear-splitting CLANG --
causing the marksman's SHOT to go wild.
CUT TO:
152
152
The SHOT misses the King and EXPLODES INTO the WALL an
inch from his head. Louis turns to Richelieu -- sees
anger and disappointment flash on the Cardinal's face.
Just for an instant... but it is enough.
CUT TO:
128.
153
153
Pandemonium, inside and outside the Palace. Athos,
Porthos, and Aramis emerge from the crowd at the entrance,
draw their swords, and prepare to rush the long line of
Guards protecting the doors. The Guards cannot believe
what they are seeing. Three men against a hundred. It's
ridiculous. But then... the looks on Guards' faces begin
to change, subtly at first, from amusement to horror.
154
THEIR POV
154
Behind Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, something incredible
happens. Musketeers appear from every direction. Some
from the surrounding crowd. Some from buildings, roof-
tops. Others appear on horseback, a few disguised as
monks. And all defiantly wearing their blue and gold
tunics.
The murmur of the crowd becomes an excited roar. The
corps of Musketeers line up behind Athos, Porthos, and
Aramis. Porthos and Aramis exchange a smile. Athos
keeps his usually dour expression. But his eyes are
charged with excitement. They raise their arms, and
face the long line of Guards. A hundred sabers flash in
the sunlight.
ATHOS
Save the King!!
The Musketeers charge.
It is a glorious sight.
CUT TO:
155
155
D'Artagnan scrambles up through the trapdoor, and tackles
the marksman. As the BELL CONTINUES TO CLANG, they fight
hand-to-hand. The marksman forces d'Artagnan toward the
edge of the tower. Two hundred feet to the ground below.
They remain deadlocked for a beat, the marksman inching
d'Artagnan backward, certain death behind him. And at
the last moment, d'Artagnan summons up the strength of
three -- and shoves the marksman backward with a resound-
ing kick.
The marksman stumbles, falls through the open trapdoor,
and plunges to his death.
D'Artagnan peers down the shaft. There's a faint CRASH
as the marksman hits bottom. Utilizing the bell ropes
like a fireman's pole, d'Artagnan grabs hold and slides
down into the abyss.
