Pikul and Geller spew out of the doorway and find themselves
standing alone in the weedy parking lot of the church. The
church itself stands isolated on a country road just outside
a town which is not much more than two gas stations and a
crossroad.
Pikul and Geller look around wildly. The vehicles in the
parking lot are country, pickup trucks, rusted vans, 4x4s.
Across the road, aloof, maybe too high-class for the parking
lot, sits a Land Rover Defender 110, the one with the roof
cage and the seven seats and the winch hanging off the
front. Geller gestures towards the Defender.
GELLER
Let's take my limo.
PIKUL
(WILD)
No, no!
GELLER
Why no?
PIKUL
I don't trust the driver!
GELLER
You drive, idiot!
They cross the road and jump in the Defender. Frances, the
driver, sixtyish, a retired lady farmer who moonlights, is
apprehensive.
FRANCES
What's the commotion, Miss
Geller? Say, are you all right?
What's goin' on in there?
GELLER
We need this vehicle, and we need
it without you. But with the
keys.
FRANCES
I can't do that. I can't abandon
my vehicle.
Geller pulls the weird gun out of an astonished Pikul's
pocket. She points it at Frances.
GELLER
Get out, Frances. You can say you
were hijacked.
FRANCES
(CHUCKLES)
It'll take more than a dead
squirrel to get me out of this
seat.
Geller fires two shots. One rips a hole in Frances's
headrest.
FRANCES
(getting out of her seat)
You have to push the shift lever
down to get it into reverse.
GELLER
Thanks, Frances.
They drive off down the country road, leaving Frances in the
dust.
The intimate moment involves Pikul digging the bullet out of
I Geller's shoulder with a Swiss Army knife while kneeling in
front of the idling Defender's headlights. Pikul'is being
squeamish and not getting the job done.
GELLER
(IRRITATED)
C'mon. If you're gonna do it, do
it.
PIKUL
OK, OK.
He grits his teeth and digs in with a bit more gusto.
Something yellow and white, like a kernel of corn, flips out
of her wound and onto the road's shredding asphalt. Pikul
feels around for it, finds it, holds it up to the light.
PIKUL
I got it. Wow. Did somebody bite
you?
GELLER
What do you mean?
PIKUL
What I just dug out of you. It's
a tooth. A human tooth.
Pikul holds the tooth out to her, but she just glances at
it, then rummages around in her MetaFlesh game-pod bag.
GELLER
Lemme see that weirdo pistol.
Geller pulls the strange weapon out of the bag. After a
moment of study, she expertly pops the magazine out of the
grip. The gristly magazine is packed with teeth.
GELLER
Yep. The bullets are human teeth.
Look - this one's got a cavity.
PIKUL
That thing was designed to get
past any kind of metal or
synthetics detector. It's all
flesh and bone.
GELLER
I suppose the smaller caliber
pistols would have to fire baby
teeth. The tooth fairy could go
I into the arms business.
PIKUL
(INCREDULOUS)
That guy really came there
tonight just to kill you.
GELLER 4
(WITH IRONY)
Amazing, isn't it?
We follow the Defender as it parks outside the Salmon Falls
Motel. Pikul jumps out carrying two paper bags of Perky
Pat's takeout. He knees the truck door shut and walks over
to motel door 5.
The Defender is parked by the pumps. A gangly pump attendant
- his name, embroidered on his overalls, seems to be Gas -
fills the truck as Pikul and Geller hover nervously.
GAS
Anything else I can do for you?
GELLER
Well, Gas, you could check your
bioport-plugs.
GAS
The what? The sparkplugs?
GELLER
You heard me. My friend here has
a bioport problem.
GAS
(COOL)
A bioport, now, that's a sort of
a hole in your spine, isn't it?
Lotta assholes `round here, but
that's generally it. I don't know
why you'd be talking to me about
that, lady.
Geller smiles a knowing smile.
GELLER
Sure you do.
Gas looks at her closely for the first time. His eyes widen
in disbelief. He pulls a greasy wallet out of his overalls
and flips out the card holders. Amongst various family
photos, hot rod photos, fishing photos, is a photo of
Allegra Geller clipped from a glossy magazine. Under the
photo is the legend "Genius In A Game-Pod".
Gas takes her hand in his and kisses it.
GAS
Allegra Geller. You changed my
life.
In the heat of the summer night, game-pod case still slung
over her shoulder, Geller wanders around the periphery of
the gas station, touching things - trees, the ground, grass
- at random, her expression suggesting that everything she
sees is amazing and delightful and slightly disturbing, like
someone who has wandered into a sculpture garden where
everything is perfect in every detail except that everything
is made out of bronze.
We are close on a bizarre insect which sits unsteadily on
the chrome of a gas pump handle. Geller's hand comes into
frame and gently eases the creature into its palm. Geller
floats her hand closer to her face and studies the creature
with an expression of rapture on her face.
The insect is large, praying mantis-sized, and it has two
heads, neither of which seems to know how to deal with the
other one. Each time it attempts to move, it falls over in
an awkward heap because its legs are all different sizes and
shapes. It beats its large, papery wings wildly in order to
pull itself upright and then begins the whole clumsy process
all over again. Eventually, its wing action lifts it off
Geller's hand - more by accident than will, it seems - and
the creature disappears in the darkness surrounding the gas
pumps.
The Defender winds its way up a heavily wooded mountain
road.
The Defender turns off a dirt road and rumbles through an
open gate. The stone gateposts bear a coy rustic sign which
reads, CALEDON SKI CLUB - PRIVATE ROAD.
The Defender pulls up beside the chalet-style ski clubhouse.
As they get out of the truck, the same bizarre insect that
Geller was playing with the night before lands on the
truck's side mirror, narrowly missing Pikul as it flops
around in the air.
PIKUL
Look at that huge bug. It's got
two heads.
GELLER '
They breed them here. They're not
supposed to get away.
They get out and walk towards the clubhouse.
PIKUL
What if somebody comes up here
and really wants to ski?
GELLER
Nobody actually physically skis
any more, Pikul. You know that.
PIKUL
I've watched some ski shows.
Downhill racing, Austrian Alps.
GELLER
(CONTEMPTUOUSLY)
Yeah, right.
A ragged stream of pod-assembly workers trickles along a
densely wooded gravel path towards a very un-Chinese
Victorian red-brick farmhouse. A small river flows not more
than fifty feet from the restaurant, mimicking the movement
of the line of workers.
The workers all file past a sign on the lawn in front of the
building which reads, MONA ZHANG'S BEIJING CUISINE.
The trio walk along the bank of the river that feeds the
Trout Farm. Nourish points out a connected series of rock-
lined, internally-lighted pools, some stagnant, like ponds,
and some clear, with river water running through them.
NOURISH
See there, the breeding pools.
The pools are all alive with strange creatures, mutated
fish, amphibians, and, along the small, muddy terraces that
border the pools, reptiles. Like the dysfunctional insect at
the gas station, these creatures do not work very well. They
float and swim belly up, lie on their sides at the bottom of
their pools, flop and flounder around, and in general,
ostentatiously fail to function.
PIKUL
Is that where you caught today's
special?
NOURISH
(LAUGHS)
The restaurant is controlled by
us. We raise these mutant
creatures as food and that is our
cover, but of course, we are also
raising them as components for
undetectable and hypoallergenic
weapons. Right under the noses of
our enemies. And speaking of our
enemies, it's important that you
go back to work at Cortical
Systematics. We need to maintain
as many agents there as we can.
I'll take care of the mess at the
restaurant.
GELLER
The Trout Farm is owned by
Cortical Systematics?
NOURISH
Yes.
(MORE)
OC
NOURISH (CONT'D)
(BITTERLY)
Their corporate slogan should be,
"Enemies of Reality".
A glazed look comes over Pikul. He begins to speak like a
robotic orator.
PIKUL
(ROBOT-LIKE)
Reality is a fragile thing. Most
people think that reality must of
course be the most solid thing,
but it isn't. Reality is
threatened now more than ever. It
is being eroded and it is
washing away in the deforming
storm of non-reality, which
masquerades as reality, and
eventually replaces it. Deformed
and crippled and limping and
hideous, threatening to engulf us
all.
Geller looks at Pikul in admiring disbelief.
GELLER
(SOTTO VOCE)
Where did that come from?
PIKUL
The game made me do it.
GELLER
I'm impressed.
Nourish is also impressed. He smiles broadly, then takes
Pikul in his arms and hugs him, then Geller.
NOURISH
(PASSIONATE)
We love you two now, now that you
have proven to be true and
trustworthy Realists. We'll be in
touch.
Nourish turns around and walks back-towards the restaurant.
PIKUL
"Enemies of Reality"? Or does it
really mean, enemies of eXistenZ?
Are the Realists the game-life
version of the Anti-
eXistenZialists, desperately
want to kill you?
S'
GELLER
I wouldn't take it too seriously.
PIKUL 1
Of course you wouldn't. But maybe
you should.
(PAUSE)
But why is the name Cortical
Systematics familiar?
GELLER
We saw it everywhere in Dorsey
Nader's game store, remember?
PIKUL
Yes. So that makes it the game-
life version of our own company.
Cortical Systematics is
equivalent to Antenna Research in
the real world.
GELLER
That's probably fair to say.
PIKUL
So, then, do we meekly go back to
work and say nothing? It sounds
as though Nourish and his
Realists are preparing to
sabotage the Trout Farm. Before
you know it, they'll be planning
to assassinate game designers.
GELLER
We're just characters in here.
Don't mix your real-life
loyalties into it or you'll lose
for sure.
PIKUL
Then what do we do next?
The cashier leads Pikul and Geller out of the guest chalet
and down the mountain path. The chalet next to theirs begins
to implode as they scurry by it.
As they flee, they realize that all the chalets are on fire.
There are people trying to fight the fires, running
r frantically everywhere with hand-held extinguishers. There
is also scattered gunfire, but who's firing on whom is
impossible to tell.
86
The cashier now leads them up to the top of a hill.
CASHIER
Up here. We can see everything
from here.
PIKUL
What is it that we're seeing?
CASHIER
(GLEEFUL)
The victory of Realism. And you
were part of it.
GELLER
(DESOLATE)
The death of eXistenZ. And we
were part of it.
The cashier turns on her with his gun. He snaps out his old
clip and slams home a new one. He cocks the gun.
CASHIER
There's just one more thing.
PIKUL
(HORRIFIED)
What are you doing? We're on your
side.
CASHIER
(FIERCE)
How could you be? How could
Allegra Geller, the world's
premiere game designer, be on our
side?
(off their bewildered
LOOKS)
Oh, Y93.' We know who you are. You
can't hide inside a game forever.
PIKUL
Something's slipped over the
edge, here, Allegra. Something's
all wrong.
CASHIER
(SMILES)
There. You see what I mean. You
see the problem.
9'
The cashier raises his gun to fire at Geller, but before he
can pull the trigger, he jolts backwards and falls twitching
to the ground.
From the shadows of the trees, backlit by the fiery
landscape below, steps Kiri Vinokur. In his hand he holds
the gristle gun which Pikul assembled in the Chinese
restaurant.
VINOKUR
I tried to find you. Thank God I
got here in time.
(pause; waggles the gun)
My dog brought me this.
GELLER
(BACKING AWAY)
You didn't get here in time. My
game is dead.
(FOCUSSING)
You murdered my game.
VINOKUR
(LAUGHS)
No, just your pod. I replicated
the entire contents of your pod
when I fixed your nerve boards.
They're in safe-keeping. They're
all in one piece.
GELLER
You copied eXistenZ?
VINOKUR
(soft, pleading)
Allegra, come over to Cortical
Systematics. Yes, yes, Cortical
Systematics. I'm defecting and so
are all the Antenna Research top
brass, Pellatt, Melzack, Sherrin,
everybody good.
GELLER
You're a spy for Cortical
Systematics.
PIKUL
(CONFUSED)
Wait a minute. Cortical
Systematics is just the qame
version, it's only...
I 9
VINOKUR
TIGNORING PIKUL)
Not a spy, exactly. I think of
myself as a personnel exchange
engineer. If you want to be
reunited with your creation,
you'll come over to us. eXistenZ,
by Allegra Geller. Only from
Cortical Systematics.
GELLER
(DEFIANT)
Only from Antenna Research.
VINOKUR
But why stay with them? Look at
that mess down there. How could
you trust Antenna again, when
they've endangered you like this?
Geller seems to have lost the thread. She wanders over to
the cashier's body and disentangles his submachine gun from
him.
GELLER
(referring to cashier)
You know, this guy was actually
going to kill me.
Vinokur looks to Pikul for support.
VINOKUR
(TO PIKUL)
Can you talk to her? I mean, we
can take you with us too.
But before Pikul can respond, Geller, now sitting next to
the cashier's body on the grass, opens fire at Vinokur with
the submachine gun. Vinokur falls with a startled expression
on his face.
Pikul, absolutely horrified, runs at Geller and kicks the
weapon out of her hand, picks it up himself.
PIKUL
What the fuck are you doing?!
You've killed him! Are you gonna
kill me next?
A-
GELLER
(LAUGHS GIDDILY)
C'mon, Pikul. He's only a game
character. And I didn't like the
way he was messing with my mind.
PIKUL
(SUDDENLY CALM)
Didn't you? You didn't like that
and so you killed him?
GELLER
He was only a game character.
PIKUL
(QUIETLY)
But Allegra. What if we're not in
the game anymore?
GELLER
(confused, childlike)
Huh? If... if we... we're not?
PIKUL
(STRANGELY HARD)
If we're not, then you just
killed someone real. A real
person.
(PAUSE)
You see what can happen. It's
important for me that you see
that.
GELLER
Why?
PIKUL
(standing over her)
It wasn't an accident that you
and I ended up on the run
together.
GELLER
Not an accident?
Pikul hefts the submachine gun in his hands.
PIKUL
No.
GELLER
(COLD)
That's why you never had a
bioport. You were one of them.
PIKUL
I still am one of them.
GELLER
But you have a bioport now.
(IRONIC)
I thought that was forbidden to
Anti-eXistenZialists.
PIKUL
I made the bioport sacrifice to
get close to you, to make love to
my enemy.
GELLER
Why would you do that?
PIKUL
To understand what I have to
kill.
7.
GELLER
(QUIETLY)
Then. understand this.
Geller produces a tiny electronic remote controller from the
pocket of her shirt.
GELLER
Understand that I suspected who
you were from the moment you made
that fake phone call to yourself
in the limo. Understand that I
knew you were my real assassin
when you pointed the gun at me in
the Chinese restaurant.
She flicks up a safety cover on the remote's tip, revealing
a toggle switch. Pikul's hands tense around the submachine
gun.
GELLER
And understand that you're dead.
Geller flips the toggle switch. The base of Pikul's spine
blows out, his shirt billowing with blood as his bioport
explodes.
9:
A delighted Geller dances to her feet as Pikul staggers
backwards.
GELLER
(GLEEFUL)
Death to the demon Ted Pikul!
His eyes frozen in a death stare, Pikul falls, rolls down
the hill into the underbrush. Smoke creeping up from the
fires below curls over him like a blanket.
Arms raised in the air, Geller dances around on the top of
the hill, looking down on the flames and the chaos.
GELLER
(confident, laughing)
Have I won the game? Have I won?
Have I won?
The hill, the trees, the flames melt down around her.
