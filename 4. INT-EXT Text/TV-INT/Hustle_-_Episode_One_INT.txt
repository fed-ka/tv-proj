      PETER WILLIAMS, a businessman in his mid forties, his suit 
    and jewelleryoozing money, sits at table with business 
      colleague.   Colleague signs credit card slip for bill.

      Colleague stands and puts  25 cash tip on tray. They shake 
      hands and colleague leaves.  Once his colleague is out of 
      sight, WILLIAMS checks he s not being watched then sneakily 
      reaches over and takes  20 note from tip.

      This is seen by avuncular looking ALBERT STROLLER at nearby 
      table.



      WILLIAMS leaves restaurant and walks through to bar.

      ALBERT watches him go.   Leans back to ma tre de desk and 
      spins reservation book around to check name.                           Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 2.



      WILLIAMS sits at bar, something falls to his feet, he leans 
      down and picks up a classy cigarette lighter.

    As he straightens up, he finds himself looking at ALBERT 
      sitting on next stool.   ALBERT smiles as he takes lighter 
      back, offers to buy WILLIAMS a drink.

    As ALBERT turns to order drinks, he looks into camera through 
      mirror behind bar and touches his nose.



      Been a long night, five poker players in various states of 
      sweaty, smoke stained disarray, battle weary. Pan around 
      table to DANNY BLUE,babyface, small stack of chips left, he 
      looksat player opposite; waits for him to make his play. 

      DANNY looks at camera, then throws remaining chips 
      into pot, shitor bust.

      long red nails;

      shirt, and into blackness of inside jacket pocket.

      STACIE smiles at smarmy city guy who looks delighted at the 
      collision, before she carries on her way to door.  He grins 
      inanely at his mates.....As STACIE reaches door, she puts 
      wallet inside magazine.

      Look to camera, leaves;



      MICKEY sits in back of black cab, he takes slip of paper from 
      pocket, checks it as cab stops;

      They are parked at end of Mews, MICKEY looks through cab 
      window.

      A woman appears [his wife RACHEL], he smiles...she s carrying 
      bags to her car which is parked outside her house.                          Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 4.



      MICKEY still sitting in cab watching RACHEL load her car;

      A man appears, coming out of house behind her.  

      MICKEY leans back, the couple kiss, then get into car.  

      MICKEY looks down at slip of paper, screws it up and throws 
    it from window.     He nods at driver who watches him in rear 
      view mirror, the cab pulls away.

      SLOW MOas he looks to see ASH MORGAN fill his windscreen, 
      hovering slightly above at grotesque angle - blood spurts 
      from ASH s mouth hitting screen just in front of driver.

      Back to speed as ASH s body crashes on to bonnet, then rolls 
    off into road.    Businessman horrified.



    FAT GUY sits on edge of bed, STACIE strokes his cheek.  As he 
      reaches out to her, she glides away.  He starts to unbutton 
    his shirt watching her legs as she walks across room.

    She picks up a small black leather case and returns to the 
      bed.  She clicks catches and opens case.

    Sex toys, including furry handcuffs...

      STACIE licks her lips, FAT GUY grins.



      Small bar, dimly lit, quiet.  BARMAN EDDIE cleaning bar.

      MICKEY sits with ASH MORGAN;  ASH smokes;

                    Amen to that.

      A moment, ASH lights new cigarette from old one;

                    So what now Mick?

                    Knocked him out in the ninth.

                                  MICKEY
                    You think that bugged him?

                                  ASH
                    Never thought about it.

                                  MICKEY
                    Fifty sounds like you picked the 
                    number.  That it was planned, a 
                    matter of choice.  Forty nine 
                    sounds like he didn t have another 
                    fight left in him.  Fifty made him 
                     the man , forty nine made him a 
                    pussy.

                                  ASH
                    You re calling Rocky Marcianoa 
                    pussy?

                                  MICKEY
                    A manner of speech to make a point.

                                  ASH
                    Which is?

                    That s emotional blackmail.

                                  MICKEY
                    I ve known you ten years, that buys

                    He s here to oversee the Mickey 
                    Stone surveillance...
                    Give him what he wants.

      MULLENS leans into DEPALMA.

                    Any overtime comes through me 
                    first.

                                  DEPALMA
                    Sir.

      MULLENS walks away, leaving DEPALMA looking at his team.   
      He s approached by D.S TERRI HODGES, an attractive woman in 
    her late thirties, who offers her hand although we sense 
      she s not overjoyed at DEPALMA s appearance.

                                  HODGES
                    Sergeant Terri Hodges.  I ve been 
                    heading up the surveillance.

                    Good, then let s see what you ve 
                    got...                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 12.

                    He s the roper.  Finds the marks, 
                    sucks them in and introduces them 
                    to the mob.  Usually plays the part 
                    of ex-serviceman or retired  
                      banker...In reality he was a shoe 
                    salesman in the American Mid-West.  
                    Legend has it, when his store was 
                    closed down and the staff made 
                    redundant, he conned the company 
                    out of sixty thousand dollars and 
                    shared it amongst his co-workers.  
                    Fled to England in the seventies, 
                    but by then he d got the taste and 
                    hasn t looked back since.  His

      HODGES moves to photograph of PETER WILLIAMS.

                                  HODGES (cont d)
                    We think this is their next mark.



      ALBERT has set up his own briefing board on wall of room. He 
      stands in front of photograph of PETER WILLIAMS;

                                  ALBERT
                    Peter Reginald Williams.  Started a 
                      pharmaceutical business in the 
                    early eighties, first wife Sara was 
                    old money...He used her family s 
                      connections in the government to 
                    get research contracts. 

                                  ASH
                    Where s the in?

                                  ALBERT
                    He s greedy.                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 15.



      ALBERT s POVas WILLIAMS  colleague puts cash tip on table 
    for waiter, once he s gone, WILLIAMS looks around and picks 
    it up.   

      ALBERT watches.



      ALBERT points to series of stills;   

      WILLIAMS shaking hands with politician.  Leaving his office.    
    Big society wedding. Over this;

                                  ALBERT
                    ....it seems his shares have taken 
                    a tumble like everyone else s and 
                    he s struggling to keep his new 
                    young wife in the style to which 
                    she s become accustomed.  

      MICKEY stands, stares deep into the photograph of WILLIAMS, 
      getting his measure;



      HODGES taps MICKEY s photograph;

                                  HODGES
                    This crew is not about conning 
                    little old ladies out of their 
                    pension, they re strictly major 
                    league.  And remember...Mickey 
                    Bricks thinks he s cleverer than 
                    us, that there s no way we can 
                    catch him...Let s prove him wrong.



      MICKEY smiling;

                                  ASH
                    Sounds like you really warmed to 
                    this guy Albert...

      ALBERT stands beside photo of WILLIAMS.

                      Objectionable little man, with the 
                    morals of an alley cat.

                    One more thing...



      WILLIAMS stands at bar with group and two pretty young women.

      WILLIAMS giving it large, ordering champagne.    

      ALBERT watching in b.g;

                                  ALBERT  (V.O.)
                    He s a sucker for a pretty face, 
                    spends money to impress...The 
                    shorter the skirt the looser he 
                    gets...



      MICKEY, ASH and ALBERT.

                                  MICKEY
                    Time to get an edge.



      ALBERT and PETER WILLIAMS at dinner table, the waiter stands 
      beside table as ALBERT puts cash on top of bill.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    Don t give him a tip Tony...
                          (glare at waiter;)
                    The service was shite...

      ALBERT hands waiter tray, he smiles and walks away;

    As they get up, ALBERT notices something under the table, he 
      bends down and picks up wallet.   He offers it to WILLIAMS;

                                  ALBERT
                    You ve dropped your wallet...

                                  WILLIAMS
                    It s not mine.

      WILLIAMS produces his own. 

      ALBERT opens up wallet, stuffed with cash.  The two men 
      exchange a look.  He then takes out business card; 

                                  ALBERT
                    Mark Hamilton, MRHInvestments.

                          on back)
                    You are a card.

      ALBERT walks away.

                                  ALBERT (cont d)
                    Let s see if he s staying at the 
                    hotel.

      WILLIAMS eventually follows ALBERT to MAITRE D s desk, but is 
      clearly peeved at not being taken seriously....

                                  ALBERT (cont d)
                          (to maitre d ;)
                    Excuse me.   We found this in the 
                      restaurant.

    The MAITRE D  looks at card, then wallet stuffed with cash.

                                  MAITRE D 
                    I ll see MrHamilton gets it sir.

      WILLIAMS watches as MAITRE D  looks at cash bursting from 
      wallet.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    I don t think so...
                          (takes wallet off maitre 
                          d ;)
                    Just tell us which room he s in.

      ALBERT smiles to himself;



      DEPALMA and HODGES sit at table in front of P.Cmonitor as 
      photograph is being downloaded.

      It s STACIE meeting with MICKEY outside hotel.

                                  DEPALMA
                    So who s she?

                                  HODGES
                    Stacie Monroe.  She was married to 
                    short con artist Jake Henry...they 
                    worked the badger mostly, did well 
                    too..Then Jake took all their 
                    savings and ran for the hills five 
                    years ago.

                                  DEPALMA
                    So much for honour amongst thieves.

                    So why the change of heart?



      MICKEY, stands in front of the mirror.

      STACIE enters, turns him round and fixes his tie;

                                  STACIE
                    I always liked you in a shirt and 
                    tie.

      MICKEY smiles.

      A moment, having finished tie, STACIE goes to sit on edge of 
      bath.

      A wry smile from MICKEY;

                                  MICKEY
                    Thanks.   I ll remember that tip 
                    for my next relationship...

                                  STACIE
                    Did you go and see her?

      Take MICKEY s reaction, remembering the scene in the mews.

                                  MICKEY
                    Is this leading somewhere?

                                  STACIE
                    You can t kid a kidder...

                                  MICKEY
                    You think I want her back?

                                  STACIE
                    Do you?

      MICKEY kisses her on forehead and leaves, not wanting to 
      continue conversation.

      STACIE watches him go;   Thoughtful.



      ALBERT s hand knocks on door.

      A beat, widen shot to show ALBERT beside WILLIAMS.

                                  MICKEY  (O.S.)
                    Who is it?

                                  ALBERT
                      MrHamilton?

                                  MICKEY  (O.S.)
                    Who wants to know?

      ALBERT looks at WILLIAMS...Bemused.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    We think we ve found something of 
                    yours... 
                          (a beat, silence;)
                    Your wallet?

      A beat, they hear chain removed and door opens revealing 
      MICKEY.   A predatory smile.                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 21.



      DANNY sits at bar with deck of cards;.    

      EDDIE, the barman, walks to DANNY, picks up his empty glass, 
      holds it up;

      DANNY nods. 

      DANNY takes Queen from deck and two other cards...

    As EDDIE puts drink in front of him, DANNY sets up three card 
      monte on bar, mixing cards with lightening speed....

                                  EDDIE
                          (wearily;)
                    Three fifty.

                                  DANNY
                    I ll give you two shots.

                                  EDDIE
                    Yeah right...Three fifty.

      DANNY takes out note and puts on bar.

                                  DANNY
                    Come on Eddie...Pick anyway.

      EDDIE can t resist it;

      Points to first - wrong.   Second - wrong.    DANNY turns 
      over remaining card - Queen.

      EDDIE shakes head and walks to till, DANNY starts shuffling 
      three cards again;   

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                    Go again.

                                  EDDIE
                    Shouldn t you be somewhere Danny?

                                  DANNY
                    Tell you what, I ll make it easy 
                    for you....

      Takes Queen, folds down one corner, puts it back with other 
    two on bar, mixes them up;   Drains glass;

                                  DANNY (cont d)

                                  DANNY
                    No money, buy me a drink if you re 
                    wrong...

      EDDIE looks at card, stares at fold in card, a beat, he 
      points at it;

      DANNY turns it over - wrong.    Turns over card beside it - 
      Queen.

      DANNY grins and pushes empty glass towards EDDIE;

                                  EDDIE
                          (picks up glass)
                    You re a very sick person.

                                  DANNY
                    I m just naturally gifted.

      EDDIE fixes DANNY s drink;

                                  EDDIE
                    You heard Mickey Bricks is out?

      DANNY looks up, sudden interest.

                                  DANNY
                    He played the long con, right?

                                  EDDIE
                    Top of the food chain.

                                  DANNY
                    You think he could teach me 
                    anything?

                                  EDDIE
                    What do I know?...All you guys 
                    freak me out....
                    But they say he s the best.

      Take DANNY s reaction - stung.

                                  DANNY
                    Yeah?  Then how come he s been 
                    pissing in a bucket for two 
                    years..?

                                  EDDIE
                    Story I heard was he found out his 
                    wife was cheating...Took a baseball 
                    bat to the guy.

                                  DANNY
                    Doesn t sound very bright.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 23.

                    you ten there s a woman there 
                    somewhere...

                                  DANNY
                          (a beat, then dismissive;)
                    No-one plays the long con anymore.

                                  EDDIE
                          (leans in;)
                    Maybe that s because no-one knows 
                    how...

      EDDIE sees new arrival enter, looks at DANNY, sensing his 
      intrigue, but also knowing he s too proud to ask;

                                    EDDIE(cont d)
                    He s booked in the London Park 
                    Hotel.

      DANNY shrugs - so what? - EDDIE walks away to serve new 
      arrival.

      With EDDIE not watching, DANNY s expression changes - 
      thoughtful now.



      STACIE hands ALBERT and WILLIAMS a drink before leaving room, 
      WILLIAMS watches her walk away, taking in her legs and behind 
      lustfully...

      MICKEY turns to ALBERT and WILLIAMS.

                                  MICKEY
                          (raises glass)
                    Here s to you, gentlemen.  I didn t 
                    think there were any honest men 
                    left in the world. 

                                  ALBERT
                    One or two.

                          (raises glass)
                    To honest men.

      ALBERT and WILLIAMS raise glasses, sip drinks.

      MICKEY picks up wallet;

                                  MICKEY (cont d)
                    You must let me thank you properly.

      WILLIAMS sits forward, eager, but ALBERT raises a hand.

                                  ALBERT
                    We wouldn t hear of it.

      WILLIAMS glances at ALBERT, sits back;

                                  WILLIAMS
                    Absolutely not.

                                  MICKEY
                    You must let me show my 
                      appreciation...even if it s only 
                    the cab fare home.

      Knock on door.

                                  MICKEY (cont d)
                    Excuse me.

      MICKEY opens door to reveal ASH, WILLIAMS turns to watch; 

      MICKEY and ASH talk conspiratorially in doorway, ASH hands 
    him a small briefcase.

      MICKEY closes the door, WILLIAMS looks away;

      MICKEY re-joins them, putting briefcase down, but opening it 
      briefly to check contents - it s stuffed with cash.  WILLIAMS 
      sees this, take his reaction.

                                  MICKEY (cont d)
                    Sorry gentlemen, where were we?
                    Oh yes, I was trying to persuade 
                    you to take something in return for 
                    your kindness.

      WILLIAMS sits up again, smiles eagerly;

                                  ALBERT
                    It s a strange state of affairs if 
                    one chap can t do another a favour 
                    without money rearing it s ugly 
                    head. 

      WILLIAMS sits back again.

                                  ALBERT (cont d)
                    And who knows, one day you may be 
                    in a position to do something 
                    similar for us.

      MICKEY thoughtful.

                    intact but satisfy my need to thank 
                    you properly.

      ALBERT draws breath, about to refuse again, but this time 
      WILLIAMS gets in first.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    What did you have in mind?

      MICKEY looks at camera.Then;

                    to make a small investment for him 
                    tomorrow.  If you ll allow me, I ll 
                    put... say...five hundred pounds in 
                    for you?

      A beat.   WILLIAMS reacts at prospect of getting  500 for 
      nothing.

                                  MICKEY (cont d)
                    I ll take the five hundred back, 
                    you just keep the profit.  It s 
                    cost me nothing but at least I ll 
                    feel happier knowing I ve done 
                    something.

      WILLIAMS sitting with huge silver hook pierced 
      through cheek.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    Sounds very generous...

    OUT on DEPALMA studying photo. 



      DANNY paces up and down outside MICKEY s room, summoning 
      courage to knock, working through introductions in head.                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 27.



      MICKEY, ASH and ALBERT sit at table. 

                                  ALBERT
                    This guy moves in high circles, 
                    it ll take something special to 
                    impress him.

                                  MICKEY
                    Then that s what he ll get.
                          (slaps ASH on back)
                    As soon as Ash starts working his 
                    magic...

      STACIE enters, sits on arm of ALBERT s chair.

                                  STACIE
                    You ever thought about a younger 
                    woman Albie..?

                                  ALBERT
                    At my age my dear I think of little 
                    else...

      STACIE grins.  Knock at door.

      MICKEY shoots a glance at STACIE, ASH and ALBERT who pick up 
      their things and head for bathroom - MICKEY looks at table, 
      it s like they were never there.

    He opens door, it s DANNY.

                                  DANNY
                    MrStone?

      MICKEY stares at him, doesn t answer.

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                    I m Danny Blue.

      Still no reaction from MICKEY.

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                          (hint of arrogance;)
                    You might have heard of me.

      Still no reaction from MICKEY.  DANNY deflated.

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                    I know you re playing a score.  I 
                    want in.

                                  MICKEY
                    In what?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 28.

                                  DANNY
                    In the game.
                          (looks past MICKEY at 
                          room)
                    Look, I really want to learn... Can 
                    we talk about this inside?
                          (a beat)
                    I can help.   I m good.
                          (a beat)
                    I ve read about all the old 
                    plays...So what is it...The wire? 
                    The rag?  The pay-off?  I pick 
                    things up quick, you tell me once, 
                    it s in...

                                  MICKEY
                    Bet you watched The Sting too 
                    didn t you?

      DANNY looks at MICKEY s hand move to door;

                                  DANNY
                    You gonnaclose the door now?

                                  MICKEY
                    I thought I might.

      DANNY looks resigned as MICKEY closes door on him.

      MICKEY smiles and walks back inside as others emerge from 
      bathroom;



      DEPALMA sits at table looking at surveillance photographs, 
      HODGES sits beside him;

                                  HODGES
                    So when do we pick  em up?

                                  DEPALMA
                    We wait.  I want everything, all 
                    the players, the money, nothing 
                    left to chance.

                                  HODGES
                    As far as we can make out, Mickey 
                    Bricks hasn t got the money to 
                    bankroll a con like this...



      Empty briefcase, MICKEY places cash in, then ASH enters and 
      does the same.

      STACIE sits beside it with calculator, taps in figures, turns 
    it round to show MICKEY.



      DANNY sitting staring at drink.



      Briefcase, STACIE beside it as ALBERT hands her money, he 
      kisses her hand.

    She smiles, taps into calculator;



      Briefcase, filling up nicely;  STACIE counting;



      STACIE puts last of cash into briefcase, MICKEY, ASH and 
      ALBERT sit exhausted.

                                  MICKEY
                    Enough?

                                  STACIE
                          (looks at ASH)
                    What about this place?

                                  ASH
                    Sorted.

                                  STACIE
                          (taps final figure in 
                            calculator, checks;)
                    Then it s enough.

      MICKEY picks up phone;



      WILLIAMS and ALBERT sit at table;

      WILLIAMS looks STACIE up and down as she walks over to join 
      them;   She talks to them briefly, they get up and follow her 
      out.

    Go to corner table, man reading newspaper.   He puts paper 
      down.   It s DANNY;



      A brown envelope is thrown on table in front of ALBERT and 
      WILLIAMS.

                                  MICKEY
                    As promised gentlemen, I invested 
                    your five hundred pounds, this is 
                    your profit.

      WILLIAMS picks up envelope, opens it - it s stuffed with 
      cash.

    He looks at MICKEY;  STACIE nearby;

                                  MICKEY (cont d)
                    I hope you re not disappointed.

                          (looking in envelope)
                    There must be a thousand pounds in 
                    there.

                                  MICKEY
                    One thousand nine hundred and fifty 
                    to be precise.













































                                                                            (CONTINUED)                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 32.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    That s quite a return.

                                  MICKEY
                    I ve had worse.

                                  ALBERT
                    Made quite a killing yourself I ll 
                    wager. 

                                  MICKEY
                          (wry smile)
                    So shoot me.

                                  ALBERT
                    Forgive me for prying, but I get 
                    the feeling there was little or no 
                    risk with this particular 
                      investment...

                                  MICKEY
                    No risk at all.
                          (a beat)
                    Right, gentlemen...If you ll excuse 
                    me I have a meeting...

                                  ALBERT
                    Wait.  I mean, can t we do this 
                    again?

      WILLIAMS and MICKEY look at him in unison.

                                  MICKEY
                    Again?

                                  WILLIAMS
                    MrHamilton s been more than 
                    generous Tony...

      A look between MICKEY and ALBERT, not the response they 
      wanted.

                                  WILLIAMS (cont d)
                          (offers hand to MICKEY)
                    Thank you.

      MICKEY reluctantly offers hand - Take reactions from group, 
      it s going wrong...

      Knock on door, STACIE glances at MICKEY then walks to open 
    it;

                                  ALBERT
                          (trying to retrieve 
                            situation;)
                    I m sure he wouldn t mind...




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 33.

                                  MICKEY
                    Well...

      Before MICKEY can finish his sentence; he looks up to see 
      DANNY pushing past STACIE and striding towards him, hand 
      outstretched.

                                  DANNY
                      MrHamilton.  I want to shake you 
                    by the hand.

      Nervous glances all round;  DANNY shakes MICKEY s hand 
        enthusiastically;

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                    You re a very great man and I m 
                    sorry I doubted you.  You know when 
                    I gave you my money I even 
                    considered the possibility you 
                    could be....
                          (a beat)
                    No.  I can t say it...

                                  MICKEY
                    Please.  Get it off your chest.

                                  DANNY
                    Well...I thought you could have 
                    been a con man.

      ALBERT glances sideways and nervously at WILLIAMS;

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                    That I may never see you or my 
                    money again....
                          (a beat)
                    I can t believe I said that.

                                  MICKEY
                          (quietly amused;)
                    I m not sure I can either.

                                  DANNY
                    Then BANG!

      WILLIAMS jumps;

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                    A four hundred per cent return, 
                    just like you said...Shit. 
                    I need a drink....D youmind?

    He walks to drinks cabinet, pours himself a drink.

      MICKEY composes himself;




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 34.

                    Pleased to meet you.
                          (a beat, then to MICKEY)
                      Right...I m ready to go again and 
                    this time, I want to go bigger...

                    Please, I don t think this is...

                                  DANNY
                          (cuts in;)
                    No I mean it, I m ready.

                                  MICKEY
                          (to STACIE)
                    Helen, maybe you d like to show 
                    Tony and Peter out?

      STACIE steps forward.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    No wait...I mean ifthere is 
                    another deal up for grabs, well I d 
                    like to hear about it.
                          (looks at ALBERT)
                    Tony? 

                                  ALBERT
                      Absolutely.

      MICKEY glances at DANNY who has his back to WILLIAMS.   DANNY 
      grins;



      MICKEY is at doorway, showing WILLIAMS and ALBERT out;   
      WILLIAMS shakes MICKEY s hand.

                                  MICKEY
                    My car will pick you up in the 
                    morning.

    And he watches as they walk away along corridor.

      MICKEY closes door and walks back into room, DANNY stands in 
      centre of room.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 35.

                    Now I m no expert, but I d say that 
                    went like a dream.

      MICKEY unleashes ferocious right hook from nowhere, 
      connecting with DANNY s chin, almost lifting him off his feet 
    and knocking him backwards over sofa.

      A beat.

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                          (O/S from behind sofa)
                    So am I in?

                                  MICKEY
                    You re in.

      MICKEY walks through to bedroom and closes door.

      DANNY appears from behind sofa, grinning at STACIE.


      START MUSIC



      STACIE sits sipping coffee, guy on next stool but one, with 
      security badge clipped to top pocket.

      STACIE puts cigarette to lips, she leans forward to guy and 
      smiles.

    Guy takes cigarette lighter from bar, leans over to light her 
      cigarette.   When he straightens up - his security badge has 
      gone.



    ASH putting finishing touches to fake security badges;

    In the background, STACIE waits; DANNY watches her intently.



      MICKEY, STACIE and DANNY walk through reception area wearing 
      security badges.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 36.

      They get into lift, MICKEY presses 2, STACIE and DANNY both 
      reach for button 8, their hands touch, a moment between them, 
      seen by MICKEY. Doors close.



      DANNY and MICKEY get out of lift and walk along corridor to 
      office marked  Human Resources  - They go inside.

      Open plan office - DANNY chats up member of staff, while 
      MICKEY seemingly waits, but in reality he is looking for 
      something.

    He sees holiday chart on wall, drifts across and studies it. 
    One entry;  ALAN MOSS - ON LEAVE/OFFICE CLOSED ROOM 105.

      MICKEY looks at DANNY and touches nose, they leave.



      STACIE comes out of lift on 8th floor, walks along corridor.   
    She reaches  Technical Services  - someone comes out, she 
      puts foot in door.

      Inside is room full of computers - very high tech - staff in 
      white overalls - huge banks of machines.

    She takes out small video camera from bag and enters room.

    She puts video camera on machine, then walks across to engage 
      technician in conversation.

    OUT on video camera, recording light on;



      Lift doors open on 12th floor.   ASH exits pushing trolley of 
      equipment.    STACIE, DANNY and MICKEY follow.



      ASH, MICKEY, STACIE and DANNY reach door - Room 105 - Alan 
      Moss.    MICKEY knocks - no answer, door locked, he takes out 
      tool and opens it with ease.

      MICKEY and STACIE enter; DANNY holds door for ASH to follow 
      them in;                           Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 37.



      Outer office;   ASH starts unloading equipment, small T.V 
      Monitor amongst it;   STACIE takes video camera from bag and 
      hands it to ASH.

      MICKEY walks through to large inner office, looks around, 
      very affluent - perfect.

    ASH points out to DANNY things that identify the office as 
      belonging to Alan Moss - family photos, desk name plate etc, 
      DANNY puts them in drawer, then replaces them with new 
      photos, name plate etc that ASH hands him from case....

      DANNY misses a leather bound calculator on desk, with  Alan  
      embossed.  A disapproving look from ASH.

    ASH then picks up T.V Monitor from trolley and sets it up on 
      desk, plugging in etc, as MICKEY puts up wooden plaque with 
      clocks with names of major cities underneath.

    ASH looks around room for one last check, then looks at 
      MICKEY, brushing shoulders of his jacket and straightening 
    his tie.

      MICKEY checks watch.

      STOP MUSIC;

                                  MICKEY
                          (to ASH)
                    Go.

    ASH takes chauffeur s cap from bag.

      DANNY and STACIE in foyer.  They exchange a look before DANNY 
      walks to reception desk.  An officious looking receptionist.

                                  DANNY
                    How you doing?












                                                                            (CONTINUED)                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 38.

      RECEPTIONIST looks at him, ungiving;  DANNY looks at box of 
      VISITOR passes behind desk.

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                    Just waiting for some new clients.

      RECEPTIONIST still unresponsive, going about her business.

      A moment;

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                    Dwarf goes to see the doctor, only 
                    he s waiting for hours, he goes to 
                    the reception desk and complains, 
                    but the receptionist says... Can 
                    you be a little patient ?

    The RECEPTIONIST looks at him like he s something she s 
      trodden in, he glances at STACIE whose expression screams get 
      a move on...

      Still nothing.

                    Listen, I m supposed to meet these 
                      guys...trouble is, I m busting for 
                    a pee.
                          (a beat)
                    If they come before I get back, do 
                    me a favour and send them up will 
                    you?  Pete Williams and Tony 
                    Monroe.  They re here to see Mr
                    Hamilton 1205...

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    I ll check the list...

                                  DANNY
                    Er, I m not sure they re on 
                    there...



      STACIE glares at DANNY.   She looks to see ALBERT and 
      WILLIAMS enter.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 39.

      DANNY sees them too.  RECEPTIONIST checking list.

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    If they re not on the list I ll 
                    have to check....Isn t 1205 Mr
                    Moss s office...?

      DANNY sees ALBERT and WILLIAMS approaching desk, STACIE 
      glaring at him;

      DANNY looks down, sees Mills & Boon romantic novel tucked 
      under paperwork on desk.

                                  DANNY
                    I lied!

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    What?

      With ALBERT and WILLIAMS almost at desk, DANNY grabs 
      astonished receptionist by arms of chair and pushes her 
      backwards on wheels.

                                  DANNY
                    Do you believe in love at first 
                    sight?

      STACIE steps behind desk just as ALBERT and WILLIAMS get to 
      there.

                                  STACIE
                    Gentlemen, MrHamilton s expecting 
                    you...

    She takes two VISITOR passes from box.

                                  STACIE (cont d)
                    I ll take you up.

    As STACIE leads ALBERT and WILLIAMS to lifts, she glances at 
      DANNY leaning over receptionist still pinned to chair.  
      WILLIAMS looks around his surroundings - impressed;

    Go to DANNY;   Receptionist open mouthed, pinned to chair.

                                  DANNY
                    Do you know what it s like, having 
                    to watch you sitting there every 
                    day...?
                          (she opens mouth to speak)
                    No!  Don t say anything...
                    You re right, I shouldn t be doing 
                    this.
                          (angrily;)
                    I ve got no right to expect you 
                    might feel the same way...

                    too close to a flame...?

    He lifts her hand, kisses it gently, turning head slightly to 
      watch STACIE, ALBERT and WILLIAMS getting into lift;

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                    Forgive me.

    He lets her go.  She s still open mouthed, but as he walks 
      away, she smiles;  adjusts her hair;

      MICKEY sits behind desk, STACIE shows ALBERT and WILLIAMS in 
    to inner office.

                                  MICKEY
                    Gentlemen, come in...Take a seat.
                          (to STACIE;)

      DANNY enters hurriedly.

                    Er, sorry I m late guys, I ran into 
                    an old friend...

      DANNY smacks STACIE on bum.   STACIE smiles through gritted 
      teeth.   Noticed by MICKEY.

      DANNY sits and grins at WILLIAMS and ALBERT.

                                  MICKEY

                    plenty...



      DEPALMA and HODGES sit in car parked opposite office block, 
      HODGES on phone and taking notes.

                    Okay, got it.

    She turns off phone;

                                  HODGES (cont d)
                    We ve got a positive ID.  He s a 
                    short con artist called Danny Blue.

                                  DEPALMA
                    Any history?

                                  HODGES
                    We know he played a con three 
                    months ago, south of the river... 
                    But the mark withdrew his complaint 
                    and CPS wouldn t prosecute without 
                    his evidence.

                                  DEPALMA
                    Why did he pull out?

                                  HODGES
                    The mark bet his life savings in a 
                    horse racing scam, but his wife 
                    didn t know anything about it.  
                    I suppose he wanted to keep it that 
                    way.

                                  DEPALMA
                    Hard to explain over breakfast I 
                    guess.

                                  HODGES
                    Must be true what they say... 
                    There s one born every minute.

    She looks back at office building;



      WILLIAMS listens intently to MICKEY as STACIE enters with 
      tray of coffee.

                                  MICKEY
                    What I m about to show you may be 
                    foolproof, but it s also illegal. 
                    There s no victim, but it s against 
                    the law.
                          (a beat)
                    Would you like me to continue?

                                  MICKEY
                    The only way this thing works is if 
                    you want something for nothing.

                    Okay.

                    Now when the multi-nationals 
                    publish their annual reports, there 
                    is a flurry of activity...
                    If a company has done well, their 
                    shares attract buyers and the price 
                    jumps.

                    What we ve managed to do, is to

                    system just long enough to assess 
                    them and put our own order to buy 
                    in before them.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    So you buy, knowingthe share 
                    prices will go up?

                    Exactly.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    But any delay would be noticed,

                    I never said it was easy, I said it

      WILLIAMS looks from DANNY to ALBERT, feeling left behind;   
    He takes out mobile phone;

      ALBERT and MICKEY exchange a look.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    You don t mind if I call my broker?

      WILLIAMS stands and walks across room.  MICKEY, DANNY and 
      ALBERT forced to sit in nervous silence;

                                  WILLIAMS (cont d)

                    you if anything comes of it...

    He clicks off phone.

    He looks at MICKEY, who keeps stone face.

                                  WILLIAMS (cont d)
                    Okay.   Count me in.

      Relief from all as WILLIAMS sits back in chair.

      MICKEY stands, shakes DANNY s hand;  ALBERT does the same.  
      WILLIAMS last...



      EDDIE behind bar.  ASH, STACIE, ALBERT and DANNY with drinks.

      A moment, ALBERT sees something, STACIE follows his line of

      STACIE looks at ALBERT and ASH, then puts glass down; walks

      RACHEL forces smile; glances at others, turns and leaves.

      STACIE joins the others, picks up her glass as MICKEY comes 
    out of washroom.   He joins them at bar, picks up glass, he 
      looks around him, everyone subdued.

                                  MICKEY

      MICKEY turns and walks out, ALBERT glances at STACIE; they 
    all follow MICKEY out.

    She picks up drink and moves away, putting drink in front of 
      ALBERT, kissing him on top of head.   He puts a paternal arm 
      around her.

    Out on thoughtful DANNY.  



      DEPALMA knocks on DCIMULLENS door, goes inside, puts photo 
    of DANNY on his desk.



      DANNY comes out of lift.

    As he goes to walk towards exit, two figures step forward and 
      stand blocking his way, it s HODGES and DEPALMA.



      MICKEY and ALBERT sit at table playing draw poker.   

    On other side of the room, STACIE puts real bank notes on top 
    of wads of paper.

                                  MICKEY
                    So how did you find him?

                                  ALBERT
                    Am I that transparent?

                                  MICKEY
                    You taught me well.

                    I d heard about him, he s good and 
                    wants to be the best.  Sound

                    Albert...You would too if you knew 
                    what else to do.

      A wry smile from ALBERT, knowing this is true;

                    Three.  (cards)

                    And made you a pain in the arse.

                    Rachel came into Eddie s today.

      MICKEY looks at him;

      ALBERT smiles and lays his hand on table, a full house, take 
      MICKEY s reaction.

                                  ALBERT
                    You know what I love about 
                    roulette?  That glorious thirty 
                    seconds while the wheel s still 
                      spinning...

      A moment between them;  As ALBERT deals a new hand, MICKEY 
      turns and looks at STACIE, she catches his eye and smiles;



      DANNY sits at interview desk.   A P.C stands at door.

      DEPALMA and HODGES sit opposite him, file on table;

                    You ever been to prison Danny?

      DANNY looks at tape machine;

                                  DANNY
                    Shouldn t you be taping this?

                                  DEPALMA
                    That s plan B.

      DEPALMA opens file and takes out surveillance photographs; 
      MICKEY, DANNY, ALBERT, STACIE, ASH and PETER WILLIAMS placing 
      them on desk in front of DANNY.

      A beat, DANNY studies photos.

      STACIE puts last bundle into second of two briefcases.

    All eyes on WILLIAMS - he s not sure.

      Knock on door - STACIE shoots MICKEY a glance and opens it, a

      STACIE picks up briefcase, hands it to DANNY.

      MICKEY looks at WILLIAMS as he opens his case, full of cASH.

      ALBERT sits alone at table.

      DEPALMA looks at others;  Then turns to DANNY;

                                  DEPALMA
                    Alright Danny, you can go.

      MICKEY, STACIE, ALBERT and ASH turn to look at DANNY.

      DANNY looks at MICKEY who glares at him;

                                  ALBERT
                    Judas.

                                  DANNY
                      Mickey...It s not how it looks...

      STACIE slaps DANNY full in face.   HODGES steps forward;

    As he does so, MICKEY jumps to feet and takes hand gun from 
      Hodge s belt holster, pointing it at DANNY.  

      Quick as a flash, DEPALMA takes out his gun and points it at 
      MICKEY.

                                  DEPALMA
                    Don t do it Michael.

                                  MICKEY
                          (to DANNY)
                    Final lesson, Danny.

      A moment;

                                  DEPALMA
                    I ll do it! I mean it!

      MICKEY fires his gun, the bullet splintering glass framed 
      picture on wall behind DANNY.

      A split second later, DEPALMA fires at MICKEY;  WILLIAMS 
      horrified, STACIE calls out, DANNY moves forward;






                                                                            (CONTINUED)                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 60A.
        CONTINUED:105105

    On MICKEY, his forehead explodes, then another explosion at 
      back of his head from bullet exit, blood spurts on wall 
      behind him.

















































                                                                            (CONTINUED)                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 61.

      MICKEY slumps to floor.  STACIE screams;

                                  DANNY
                    No!

                                  WILLIAMS
                    Oh my God...

                                  DEPALMA
                          (to HODGES)
                    Get him out of here!

      WILLIAMS is led away as DANNY rushes to MICKEY.

      DANNY turns and lurches at DEPALMA;

                                  DANNY
                    You bastard!

      DEPALMA pistol whips him, he falls to floor unconscious;

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

                                                                          FADE IN:



    An extremely nervous WILLIAMS sits in front of HODGES and 
      Detective #1.

                                  HODGES
                    We need a statement.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    I ve got my position to think of.

                                  HODGES
                    We understand that sir.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    Just give me my money and I ll go.

                                  HODGES
                    We can t do that, it s evidence...

                                  WILLIAMS
                    Then sod the money, just let me out 
                    of here...
                          (he leans forward, hisses 
                          at HODGES)
                    I can t be implicated in something 
                    like this, it would ruin me.






                                                                            (CONTINUED)                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 62.
        CONTINUED:106106

                                  HODGES
                    If we have enough evidence we can 
                    get guilty pleas, it won t go to 
                    court.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    Am I under arrest?

                                  HODGES
                    We need your statement...

                                  WILLIAMS
                          (strong;)
                    Am I under arrest?

                                  HODGES
                          (reluctantly)
                    No sir...

      WILLIAMS stands, heads to door, a P.Cblocks his way.

                                  WILLIAMS
                    Get out of my way!

    The P.Clooks at HODGES who reluctantly nods;

      WILLIAMS has gone.

                                  HODGES
                    Let s hope the boss can do his 
                    stuff... 



      DANNY on floor where he fell, slowly coming round;

      DEPALMA sits in armchair.   A coffee table between them with 
    A4 pad and pen.

      DANNY opens eyes, sits up slowly, rubs head, sees DEPALMA as 
    he sits in chair.

                                  DEPALMA
                    Sorry about the head...

      A beat.

                                  DANNY
                    You killed him.

                                  DEPALMA
                    I saved your life Danny.

      A moment.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 63.

                    Everyone s in custody.  We ll get 
                    you checked out on the way to the 
                    station.  

    He pushes A4 pad and pen towards him;

                                  DEPALMA (cont d)
                    First.  Time to keep your end of 
                    the bargain...

      DANNY looks at pad and pen;

                                  DEPALMA (cont d)
                    Be sure not to miss anything out.

                                  DANNY
                    I m not a grass.

                                  DEPALMA
                    Be smart Danny, all you can do now 
                    is lose.

                                  DANNY
                          (stands;)
                    Then I lose, but I d rather that 
                    than hook up with a murdering 
                      scumbaglike you....

                                  DEPALMA
                    Stone fired a gun at you.

                                  DANNY
                    He thought I d betrayed him.

                                  DEPALMA
                    You do this, or I ll see you get 
                    five years.

      DEPALMA pushes pad and pen towards him again.

                                  DEPALMA (cont d)
                    Last chance.

      A beat.   DANNY picks up pad and pen - throws it at DEPALMA.

                                  DANNY
                    Go screw yourself.

      DEPALMA stands, walks to interior door and opens it;

                                  DEPALMA
                    Okay, he s all yours...

      DANNY braces himself - but suddenly DEPALMA breaks into huge 
      grin;




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 63A.

      ALBERT, ASH and STACIE enter room, all smiles...Embracing 
      DANNY, STACIE kisses him;

      Take DANNY s reaction, complete bewilderment.

    He looks at grinning DEPALMA.


      START MUSIC 



      HODGES sitting at her desk.  The phone rings, she answers.  A 
      beat as she listens:

                                  HODGES
                          (outraged, into phone)
                    What do you mean, they ve gone?  
                    Who signed them out?

    She slams the phone down and runs out.



      DEPALMA grinning.

      DANNY surrounded by STACIE, ALBERT and ASH.

      A beat, MICKEY enters room carrying briefcase.

      Take DANNY s reaction, he looks at others who all grin.



    ASH fixing thin metal strap across top of melon.   Once in 
      place he steps back, presses a button on remote.

      A tiny explosion at front of melon, a larger one at back 
      simultaneously; 



      Re-run of shooting in room, but this time focus on ASH 
      sitting at table;   

    As DEPALMA shoots, ASH hits button on remote, MICKEY s head 
      explodes, front and back.                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 64A.



      DEPALMA in doorway ushering last of detectives out, he closes 
      door.  Looks at MICKEY on floor.  He opens his eyes and 
      grins.                        Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 65.



      MICKEY in front of DANNY, he pats DANNY s cheek, swings 
      briefcase on to table.

      Clicks catches.



      HODGES runs into evidence room, takes down three briefcases 
      from shelf, frantically opening them...all three stuffed with 
      paper...

      Paper everywhere as she rummages through cases.  Close on 
      her, the realisationshe s been had.



      MICKEY lifts lid, briefcase full of cash.  Everyone laughing, 
      picking up money....

      STACIE pops champagne;



      MULLENS screaming into phone, an agitated HODGES standing by 
    fax machine.

    Fax machine purrs into life, a copy of MARTIN DEPALMA s Photo 
    I.D comes through, with his name clearly on it.

      A fat guy with moustache.



    Fat guy with moustache, naked and handcuffed to bed where 
      STACIE left him.

    He has one of those novelty baseball caps with two cans on 
      each side, straws leading to mouth.   He takes drink.

      Fade music;



      Open on STACIE laughing, then DANNY shaking hands with 
      DEPALMA.

      DANNY looks around the room taking it all in;

                                  DANNY
                    So we re home free?



      MULLENS and HODGES look at file, photos of crew etc.

                    accused...

      HODGES rubbing face, defeated.   MULLENS face clouds, then 
      puts file through the paper shredder.



      DANNY looks at MICKEY, who beams, then turns away in complete 
      incredulity at the audacity....He looks back at ALBERT, 
      STACIE and NEIL.....All four laugh uproariously;

    ASH pats DANNY on back.

    It sinks in ;   Chaos again...Laughter, hugs...MICKEY looks

      DANNY sidles up to MICKEY;

    ASH grabs handful of cash from case and throws it up in air,

    BOX BESIDE CLOSING CREDITS;120A120A

      DANNY s hands do a fancy shuffle with deck of cards, then 
      take three cards out, a Queen and two others;

    He then turns them face down and shuffles around at speed.

    Box moves down - a second appears above it.  DANNY looks up 
    to camera - MICKEY, ALBERT, ASH and STACIE standing behind 
      him;
