          Moving off the banner to reveal the PARKING LOT, about a
          third full.  The BANNERMAN S.U.V. pulls in and parks a
          spot or two away from a MINIVAN which is in the middle of
          disgorging five kids, the Mom who got stuck with
          chaperoning them, and a folding table.



          The door to Gym opens and Johnny walks across the hall,
          turns and leans against the lockers, like he's getting
          fresh air.  Walt and Sarah follow.  Sarah is concerned,
          Walt looks annoyed.

                                        WALT
                          Alright, what's this about?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just... let me think where to
                        start.

          Walt glances at Sarah, misreading the situation.

                                        WALT
                        Listen, if you wanna take off,
                        it's not a big...

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  No one can leave.  Everyone
                        has to stay.

          Johnny nods to himself, mind racing to work this out.

                        Walt.  He saw something.

          Walt wearily looks at Johnny, his body language begins to
          speak swear words.

                                        SARAH
                        What is it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw a virus, I think.  Some
                        kind of disease.  It's already
                        here, starting to spread.  It's
                        gonna be bad.

                                        SARAH
                        A disease?  Like what, SARS?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  All I know is it's
                        highly infectious... maybe fatal. 
                        And it looks like it's starting
                        with the kids.

          This sinks in.
