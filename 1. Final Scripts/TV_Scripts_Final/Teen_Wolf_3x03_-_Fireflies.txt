                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT11

      The FULL MOON looms omnipresent over the eerily quiet woods 
      of Beacon Hills. Far closer to the ground, another GLOWING 
      OBJECT flutters into view.

      A FIREFLY. 

      The tiny luminescent beetle is joined by a second and third, 
      soaring up and through the woods. All three, the unwitting 
      prey of two children, BILLY and BREANNE, chasing after them 
      with glass jars.

                                  BILLY
                    Got one!

      Screwing the lid on top of the jar, Billy turns to show his 
      sister.

                                    BREANNE
                    What are you doing, dumbass? You re 
                    supposed to put holes in the lid. 
                    Otherwise you kill them.

                                  BILLY
                    Do I have to let him go?

                                    BREANNE
                    Do you want him to die?

      Billy holds up the jar, peering in at the firefly to decide 
      its fate. Breanne, however, steps past him as she notices a 
      remarkable sight just ahead...

      HUNDREDS OF FIREFLIES, tiny lights blinking off and on in the 
      darkness. Uncapping her own jar, Breanne races forward. The 
      fireflies scatter, soaring up to the safety of higher 
      altitudes.

      Billy cautiously follows one into the thick of the woods. 

      The glowing beetle settles on a low branch, joining another 
      PAIR just near it. Billy creeps forward, holding out the jar 
      and its lid to catch the first when--        TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/132.

        CONTINUED:11

      It flutters away, leaving the other two behind. Coming 
      closer, Billy notices the other two are actually not 
      fireflies.

      They re the GLOWING EYES of a WEREWOLF. 

      Fangs bared, dirt-smeared and as feral and frightening as a 
      wild animal, Boyd rises from the shadows. 

      SEVERAL YARDS AWAY - With a jar full of captured fireflies, 
      Breanne spins at the sound of her brother s SCREAM.

                                    BREANNE (CONT D)
                    Billy?

      Alarmed, she runs toward his voice. But she doesn t need to 
      go far. Billy hurtles out of the darkness right for her.

                                  BILLY
                    Run--run!

      Terrified, he drags her with him, causing her to drop the 
      jar. She manages a glance back at SOMETHING CRASHING THROUGH 
      THE BRANCHES toward them.

      Panicked, they run for the only shelter they can find. A lone 
      STEEL TOOL SHED. They charge inside and--

      INT. TOOL SHED/EXT. WOODS - NIGHT22

      Breanne slides the flimsy metal door shut, fumbling with the 
      tiny lock while, behind her, Billy grabs at her shirt.

                                  BILLY
                    He s gonna  get in--he s gonna  get 
                    inside--

                                    BREANNE
                    Shut up--shut up.

      Breathless, she pulls him back and away from the door. They 
      hear FOOTSTEPS. Low, animal breaths.

      Breanne holds her hand over her brother s mouth, trying to 
      keep him quiet while listening to Boyd circle the shed.

      Their heads turn at CLAWS ticking against the metal walls. 
      They follow the sounds down to where MOONLIGHT spills in 
      through the rusted and bent space between the shed s side and 
      floor. 

      CLAWS slip in through the space, feeling about for a hold.        TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/133.

        CONTINUED:22

      Backing further away, Breanne and Billy watch helplessly as 
      the claws grasp around the wall and begin to pull at it.

      METAL TEARS as Boyd wrenches the wall up, separating the 
      entire exterior of the shed from its floor. With a furious 
      GROWL, he hurls the collapsing steel frame into the air, 
      exposing the two SCREAMING children.

      But just as Boyd takes a step forward to attack, SOMETHING 
      ROLLS RIGHT IN FRONT HIS FEET.

      Breanne s JAR. 

      Lid removed, the FIREFLIES soar out of the opening, bursting 
      up in a cloud around Boyd s head. Enraged, he waves his claws 
      at the flickering lights.

      When the fireflies finally scatter, Boyd focuses his yellow 
      eyes forward to see the two children--are gone.

      EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS - NIGHT33

      Carrying a shocked Breanne and Billy under each arm, Scott 
      gives a momentary but satisfied glance back to the darkness 
      behind them as he races through the woods. Fast as he can.

      EXT. WOODS/TRAILS - NIGHT44

      Down a thin, twisting path, Derek kneels by a SHOE PRINT in 
      the dirt while talking to Scott on his cell.

                                  DEREK
                    You lost him?

                                  SCOTT (V.O.)
                    I kind of had to.

                                  DEREK
                    That s not exactly the plan.

                                  SCOTT (V.O.)
                    I know. Which is why I think we 
                    should stick together.

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT55

      Phone to his ear, Scott glances nervously about the woods. 

                                  SCOTT
                    Trust me, he s too strong, too fast 
                    and way too angry for one person to 
                    handle. We gotta  do this together.        TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/134.

                                  DEREK (V.O.)
                    Boyd might be more dangerous 
                    anyway.

                                  SCOTT
                    How come?

                                  DEREK (V.O.)
                    He s Bitten. Cora s Born. She might 
                    have more control. I m by the 
                    trails at the entrance to the 
                    preserve. Can you meet me?

                                  SCOTT
                    Yeah. Just need to drop something 
                    off first...

      Hanging up, Scott looks down at Billy and Breanne, clutching 
      fearfully to his legs.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF

      INT. MARTIN HOME/LYDIA S ROOM - NIGHT66

      Pushing aside her homework, Lydia gets up from bed to shake 
      off the nightmare. When her feet hit the floor, though, she 
      puts a hand to her head with a pained GASP.

      At her dresser, she finds the bottle for the IBUPROFEN empty.

                                  LYDIA
                          (calling out)
                    Mom, I m going to the store. Mom, 
                    did you hear me?
                          (to herself)
                    Of course, you didn t. You would 
                    have heard me screaming like a 
                    lunatic.

      Grabbing a jacket, she pauses to notice the FULL MOON outside 
      the window. With a sigh, she shakes her head at herself.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Lunatic.

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT77

      Trees blur past as Scott and Derek run with supernatural 
      speed, hurtling through the forest.        TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/135.

        CONTINUED:77

      But Derek stops short, dropping down to a kneeling position. 
      With an acrobatic flip, Scott lands right at his side to find 
      him examining TRACKS in the dirt.

                                  SCOTT
                    Is it them?

                                  DEREK
                          (nodding)
                    We re not the only ones who decided 
                    to stick together.

                                  SCOTT
                    Is that going to make it easier or 
                    harder to catch them?

                                  DEREK
                    I don t know.

                                  SCOTT
                    Derek, I saw Boyd try to rip two 
                    little kids apart. Are they going 
                    to do that to everyone they find?

                                  DEREK
                    Everyone and anyone.

      EXT. BEACON HILLS PUBLIC POOL - NIGHT88

      The door to Lydia s car clicks open. She steps out with her 
      eyes on her phone as she thumbs a text message, walking 
      briskly across the empty parking lot.

      But she stops short. 

      Slowly peering up, she finds she s not at the store, but at 
      the BEACON HILLS PUBLIC POOL. Glancing about in confusion, 
      her breath tightens noticeably.

      And then she spots an OBJECT in the darkened pool. Something 
      floating there.

      Inching forward, Lydia tries to make out what it is. With 
      each step, it becomes clearer... A BODY floating in the 
      water.

                                  LYDIA
                          (a whisper)
                    Oh God...

      She starts toward it, but then indecision halts her. She 
      looks back to her car. Then to the body in the pool.         TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/136.

        CONTINUED:88

      Finally, she approaches the pool, moving down the side by the 
      LIFEGUARD CHAIR where she kneels at the edge.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Oh my God, are you dead? Please 
                    don t be dead.

      She reaches for the body, managing to grab hold of the leg, 
      pulling it toward the moonlight to reveal--

      It s a CPR MANNEQUIN.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Are you kidding me?

      With an irritated breath, she sits up, wiping her wet hands 
      against each other.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Lydia, what the hell are you 
                    doing...

      She pauses, peering down at her wet hands. Wet with blood. 
      Gazing at a widening puddle of dark blood around her feet, 
      she follows the trail, slowly turning her head to look up.

      Perched in the LIFEGUARD CHAIR is the body of an eighteen 
      year-old BOY, wet blood still flowing down his clothes from a 
      horribly SLASHED THROAT.

      As the CPR mannequin drifts silently back in the water, 
      Lydia s terrified SCREAM fills the moonlit night.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:

      INT. ALLISON S CAR - NIGHT99

      Engine off, Allison sits in the darkened car, hands gripping 
      the wheel. She stares out the windshield, gazing not at the 
      landscape in front of her, but at a memory--

      INT. ABANDONED BANK/VAULT CORRIDOR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK1010

      Still clutching the bloody wounds on his chest, Scott can t 
      seem to look Allison in the eyes.

                                    ALLISON
                    She tried to kill you?

                                  SCOTT
                    It s okay--

                                    ALLISON
                    How is that anywhere close to being 
                    okay?

                                  SCOTT
                    I mean it doesn t matter now.

                                    ALLISON
                    Why didn t you tell me?

                                  SCOTT
                    I ll tell you everything. Anything 
                    you want to know. But right now--

                                    ALLISON
                    Just tell me why.

                                  SCOTT
                      I couldn t. All I saw was it making 
                    things worse. For that to be your 
                    last memory of her... I couldn t do 
                    it...

      He trails off, looking past her. She turns to see Derek 
      standing behind them. Erica s body held in his arms.

      INT. ALLISON S CAR - NIGHT1111

      Allison blinks away the memory, trying to shake it off. Her 
      gaze drifts to the GLOVE COMPARTMENT. After a moment, she 
      reaches over and clicks it open to grab something inside.        TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/138.

      Slowly, she raises a small object between her fingers, 
      moonlight catching its razor-sharp edges... an ARROWHEAD.

      EXT. WOODS/CAMPGROUND/INT. TENT - NIGHT1212

      AN ELECTRIC CANDLE clicks on inside a tent. One-by-one, over 
      a dozen light up, an amber glow flickering around a young 
      woman named CAITLIN. She looks out the open tent flap.

                                    CAITLIN
                    You coming?

                                  EMILY (O.S.)
                    There s a snake out here the size 
                    of a train.

                                    CAITLIN
                    Kick it.

                                  EMILY (O.S.)
                    If I kick it, I swear it could 
                    swallow my foot and drag me back to 
                    Mordor.

                                    CAITLIN
                    Just step over it.

      Caitlin hears a shuffle of feet and then EMILY bursts through 
      the flap of the tent, scrambling inside. They both laugh as 
      she falls back into Caitlin s arms. Then Emily notices the 
      candles.

                                  EMILY
                    Nice touch.

      Caitlin threads her fingers through Emily s. Then slowly  
      lowers her lips to Emily s for a gentle kiss.

                                    CAITLIN
                    You re nervous.

                                  EMILY
                    You make me nervous.

                                    CAITLIN
                    Is that good or bad?

                                  EMILY
                    All good.

      She brushes Caitlin s hair from her cheek, a thumb against 
      her soft skin. Caitlin leans forward to kiss her again, but 
      Emily sits up.        TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/139.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Okay, that s a mood killer.

      She nods to the silhouette of a large BEETLE crawling up the 
      outside of the tent, a Pine Sawyer at almost two inches long.

      Caitlin thumps her hand against the beetle. The silhouette 
      disappears. But another beetle begins crawling up. Caitlin 
      thumps that one as well.

                                    CAITLIN
                    Okay?

                                  EMILY
                    Better.

      They kiss. More intense this time, bodies pressing closer. 
      Emily s nervousness subsides as she lets Caitlin kiss her 
      chin, her neck and--

      SHE SCREAMS.

      Caitlin lurches back in shock. Then glances up to see what 
      Emily s looking at. HUNDREDS of BEETLES crawling over the 
      tent, dark silhouettes pressing down on it.

      One BEETLE pushes in through a hole in the tent. Others pour 
      in after it, a dozen of them inside the tent.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Oh my God--I can t--I can t stay in 
                    here.

                      Wait--Emily, wait--

      Already yanking the zipper up on the tent flap, she crawls 
      out and--

      EXT. WOODS/CAMPGROUND - NIGHT1313

      BEETLES tumble off the side of the tent into Emily s hair. 
      She slaps at them with her hands, spinning furiously in the 
      dark. 

      Staggering further from the tent she trips over a root, 
      tumbling into the dirt and leaves with a painful thud.

      She blinks, looking about in a daze, unable to see the tent 
      anywhere. But as her eyes focus, she sees something utterly 
      incredible...      TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/1310.

      CONTINUED:1313

      THOUSANDS OF BEETLES scurrying out of the shadows. Coming 
      right for her.

      Emily scrambles back in terror. But THE BEETLES cover her, 
      enveloping her body, literally drowning her in a sea of 
      shiny, black exoskeletons.

      Finally, their numbers dissipate and like a receding wave, 
      they vanish into the woods ahead. Except, strangely... Emily 
      is also gone.

      A voice calls out from the dark.

                                    CAITLIN
                    Emily?

      Stepping between the trees, Caitlin glances about, voice 
      becoming more tremulous as her calls turn to shouts.

                                    CAITLIN (CONT D)
                    Em, where are you? Emily? Emily!

      The CRACK of a BRANCH stops her cold. Head cocked to listen, 
      Caitlin doesn t notice the TWO YELLOW EYES blinking open 
      behind her.

                                    CAITLIN (CONT D)
                    Em?

      Behind her, the transformed Cora steps into the light. A 
        fearsome-looking werewolf, BLOOD SPATTERED across her cheek, 
      she slowly approaches her prey.

      As if sensing something behind her, Caitlin begins to turn 
      when--

      ISAAC YANKS Cora to the ground, knocking her clear off her 
      feet. As Caitlin staggers back in shock, Cora leaps up with 
      an enraged GROWL.

      Crouched in an attack pose, Isaac peers up with a smile. He 
      loves a fight. 

      Cora comes at him, claws SLASHING. Digging into his jacket, 
      she pulls Isaac around and--with a stunning display of 
        strength--hurls him across the clearing, SMASHING HIM RIGHT 
      into the trunk of tree.

      Splinters and debris falling about him, Isaac crumbles 
      forward as Cora charges.

      But Scott leaps out of the darkness, hurtling right over 
      Isaac. He takes Cora down, sending her CRASHING back.      TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/1311.

      Even as Scott lands on his feet, however, Cora scrambles up 
      to her own. Except now she rises to face Derek. He bares his 
      FANGS, ROARING a challenge at her. 

      Out of the corner of her eye, Cora sees Scott and Isaac 
      circling. She retreats back and decides to run, gunning for 
      the darkness ahead. 

      Derek launches after her with Isaac following quickly behind. 
      Scott turns back to Caitlin who has witnessed everything with 
      ever widening-eyes.

                                  SCOTT
                    Are you okay?

                    Are you all right?

      She gives a bewildered nod.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    You have to get out here, okay? Get 
                    out of the woods. Get out as fast 
                    as you can.

      Backing away from her, he sprints off in pursuit of the 
      others. Breathless, Caitlin stands in silence, alone in the 
      woods. Completely alone.

      EXT. BEACON HILLS PUBLIC POOL - NIGHT1414

      Stiles s Jeep flies into the lot, pulling in next to Lydia s 
      car. He SLAMS on the brakes and jumps out.

                                  STILES
                    Lydia? Lydia!

      Past the fence, he finds her hugging herself in the cold.

                    Not okay.

      Stiles spots the dark figure perched in the lifeguard chair 
      and reaches for his phone.

      Stiles steps closer to the body to discover an interesting

      Stiles reads the single word inscribed on it: PURITY.

      Stilinski nods, then motions for her to step aside with him.

                    Let s get an APB out on Emily and 
                    this other girl when you ve got 
                    something better than fangs and

                    She saw something.

                                  DEPUTY GRAEME
                    You mean someone.

      But Stilinski s nod is oddly hesitant. Curious, Graeme 
      watches him turn into the blur of flashing police lights.

      EXT. STORE/PARKING LOT - NIGHT1919

      Heading down an aisle of cars, Argent fumbles with an armful 
      of groceries while trying to get his keys of his pocket. One 
      of the bags slips from his grasp and he winces as it hits the 
      ground with a CRUNCH.

                                  ARGENT
                    Had to be the one with the eggs.

      He clicks open the hatchback on his SUV and loads the bags 
      inside. When he reaches to close it, he pauses. Slowly, his 
      right hand slips inside and--

      Argent whips the barrel of a Glock around to point at Scott.

                                  SCOTT
                    Uh... hi.

      EXT. STORE/PARKING LOT - NIGHT2121

      Scott keeps his eyes on the Glock in Argent s hand, still 
      pointed at him.

                                  ARGENT
                    First of all, why would I care 
                    about anyone related to Derek? 
                    Second, I don t know this kid Boyd. 
                    I don t even know his last name.

                                  SCOTT
                    His last name s Boyd.

                    What s his first name?

                                  SCOTT
                    Vernon. Which is probably why he 
                    goes by Boyd. And--just curious--is 
                    there a reason you re still 
                    pointing the gun at me?

                                  ARGENT
                    Probably because some part of me 
                    still wants to shoot you.

                                  SCOTT
                    I get that.

      Argent lowers the gun and places it back into its hiding 
      space in the hatchback.

                                  ARGENT

                    I m sorry. I can t help you.

      Finally, all Scott can do is nod. But, as he turns to go, he 
      pauses. Then glances back to Argent.

      INT. DEREK S CAR - NIGHT2222*

      Derek and Isaac watch Scott get into the passenger side of 
      Argent s SUV. They share a look, both equally confused.

      When the SUV pulls out of its parking space, Derek starts the 
      engine to do the only thing he can. He follows them.*

      INT. ARGENT S SUV - NIGHT2323

      Scott shifts nervously in his seat while Argent drives.

                    Thanks again. I ve been running for

                    closer if you can.

      Letting the vehicle drift forward, Argent now sees what Scott 
      wants him to see...

      The POLICE CRIME SCENE where two devastated PARENTS identify 
      the body of their eighteen year-old son. 

      When the MEDICAL EXAMINER zips up the body bag, the MOTHER S 
      legs give out. The FATHER grabs her, trying to keep her on 
      her feet as she collapses under the weight of grief.

      Argent watches the scene, barely breathing.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Thanks again for the ride.

      EXT. BEACON HILLS LOOKOUT POINT - NIGHT3636

      Kneeling, Argent drives a METAL DEVICE shaped like a rail 
      spike into the ground. At its tip a soft light FLASHES on and 
      off.

                                  ARGENT
                    These are Ultrasonic Emitters. It s 
                    one of the tools we use to corral 
                      werewolves, pushing them into a 
                    direction we want them to run. It 
                    gives off a high-pitched frequency 
                    only they can hear.

      He looks up to Scott, Derek and Isaac all pressing their 
      hands to their ears.

                    NO KIDDING.

                    This is going to work.

      He glances to the others, none of whom seem to share his 
      confidence.

                    It ll work.

      Argent slams the hatchback closed with a sound like a 
      STARTING GUN. A moment later, one hunter and three werewolves 
      are off and running.      TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/1326.


      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT3737

      Hurtling through the darkness, Isaac launches over a fallen 
      tree and--without a pause for a breath--sends an ULTRASONIC 
      EMITTER into the ground. 

      As the LIGHT begins FLASHING--

      EXT. WOODS/ROADSIDE - NIGHT3838

      Argent s SUV SCREECHES to a stop. The driver s side door 
      opens and he drops an EMITTER into the soft dirt, tip GLOWING 
      BRIGHTLY.

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT3939

      Whipping an EMITTER around, Derek launches it out of his hand 
      like a throwing knife. The device lands in the side of a 
      tree, PULSING TO LIFE.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/WOODS - NIGHT4040

      Scott soars out from the edge of the woods surrounding the 
      school. He flips forward with the EMITTER grasped in his 
      hands. Feet hitting the ground, thumb pressed on the button, 
      he drives the EMITTER into the ground with a BURST OF LIGHT.

      He looks up, facing the high school. It looms before him, a 
      dark and empty fortress. Their last hope...

                    Does that mean something?

      Before Argent can respond, they hear a wolf s HOWL. A signal.

                    They re coming.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT4646

      The HOWL echoes its way inside, sending Derek into his 
      position just beyond the lobby of the school where the 
      corridors intersect.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT4747

      Trying to hold his nervous breath, Isaac glances about the 
      shadows, tensing as the SOUNDS of RAPID MOVEMENT come closer 
      and closer.

      TWO BODIES hurtle into the lot. Boyd and Cora, racing at each 
      other s side, eyes darting about for something, anything to 
      kill.

      They re eyes set on Isaac.

                    Oh, great...

      But Argent s SUV ROARS past him, LIGHTS BLAZING. He pushes 
      down on the HORN, pressing them back, driving them like 
      cattle toward the front of the school.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT4848

      Hands opening to reveal his claws unsheathed, Derek stands 
      ready, poised to defend his ground.

      Through the open doors, he sees the two werewolves turning 
      away from Argent s SUV. Coming fast and right for him. But 
      just as they reach the steps--

      Both Cora and Boyd veer off to the sides, disappearing out of 
      his sight.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT4949

      Scott rushes past Argent to look up.

                    through the rope and twist around 
                    and... Stiles?

      She notices the look of shock on him. He takes a faltering 
      step back.

                    Oh my God, did you know her?

      He nods and she quickly covers the body again.

                    I m sorry--I didn t know.

      Even covered, he can t take his eyes off the body. He speaks 
      softly, each word an effort.

                    We should call your father. You re 
                      a witness.

      But Stiles doesn t respond as the shock falls away to 
        realization. He turns back to the body of the Young Man.

                    one in--Caitlin--to do a tox

      Argent and Scott race up the steps to join Derek as he rushes 
      out from the lobby, all of them glancing about the roof for 
      Boyd and Cora.

      Feet hitting the pavement, Cora and Boyd land on the rear of 
      the high school. They start forward, intent on breaching the 
      residential area of Beacon Hills. Both of them rising up to 
      race forward when--

      AN ARROW soars past Cora s head. IT EXPLODES IN A BLINDING 
      FLASH against the side of the school.

      Cora blinks in confusion as Boyd spins trying to find their 
      attacker. 

      But another arrow hits the ground near him and BURSTS INTO 
      BLINDING RINGS OF LIGHT AND SMOKE.

      Hands shielding their eyes, Cora and Boyd fall back toward 
      the school. FLASH BOLTS burst all around them, sending them

      Bow hooked over her shoulder, Allison KICKS the doors closed. 
      Moving fast, she wraps the chains back over the handlebars 
      and engages the lock.

      Breathless and trying not to let a triumphant smile spread 
      too wide on her face, she turns to see--

      Isaac. Standing nearby and having witnessed the whole thing. 
      They stare at each other for one nerve-wracked moment.

      But then Allison simply raises a finger to her lips. A silent 
      plea for him not to say anything. When Isaac nods, she turns 
      and runs for it, disappearing into the night.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT5454

      Still blinking furiously, Boyd and Cora stagger into the 
      darkened corridor where--

      Derek grabs Cora. He shoves her back with brutal force, 
      sending the snarling werewolf tumbling across the tile floor.

      Boyd whirls to attack but Argent moves in, brandishing the 
      STUN BATON. BOLTS of ELECTRICITY ripple up the side with a 
      threatening CRACKLE.

      Boyd lashes out, but Argent whips the baton around like a 
      trained swordsman. He presses forward, turning the furious 
      werewolf around to face Scott who surges out of the darkness 
      with fangs bared.

                                  DEREK
                    Come on! This way.

      Derek holds his hands out, gesturing for Boyd and Cora to 
      approach. Scott inches over to Derek to help.

      Back on his feet and almost shaking with rage, Boyd steps to 
      Cora s side. Fangs bared, the two of them slowly approach.

      TWO FIRE EXTINGUISHERS blast WHITE FUMES at them. 

      Hands rising to shield their faces, Boyd and Cora howl in 
      response. But Derek and Scott use the extinguishers to force 
      them back, pushing them all the way into the Boiler Room. 

      Dropping the extinguisher, Scott SLAMS the DOOR shut as Derek 
      shoves a steel desk in front of it. They turn to each other, 
      breathless.

      A FRENETIC POUNDING jolts them back. From the other side, 
      Boyd and Cora hammer on the door uselessly. 

      After a moment, the pounding ceases.

      Under the ominous silence, Derek and Scott lean closer to 
      listen. They glance to each other, both of them noticing the 
      odd quiet. Cautiously, Scott presses his ear to the surface 
      of the door.

      And then, finally, he stops fighting.

      Arms outstretched, hands wrapped around their necks, Derek 
      holds off Boyd and Cora even as they slash at his body, 
      forcing him to his knees while he struggles to outlast, 
      trying simply to endure...

      Blood flying from every claw slash, their savage attack only 
        intensifies. Gritting his teeth, Derek closes his eyes.

      And endures.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - DAY6464

      Now inside the school, Isaac spots the tiniest sliver of dawn 
      beginning to spill through the windows.

                                  ISAAC
                    Scott! Scott!

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/BASEMENT/CORRIDOR - DAY6565

      Isaac races down the stairs to find Scott already pulling the 
      boiler room door open. They both stop in shock when they see 
      the bloody mess inside.

      Breathing hard--but still breathing--a brutally beaten Derek 
      slowly raises his eyes. 

      Cora and Boyd lie before him. Both alive and transformed back 
      to their human selves.

                                  DEREK
                          (with difficulty)
                      There s... a teacher... back there. 
                    I ll take care of her.

      Rising, he falters. Scott starts forward to catch him, but 
      Derek steadies on his own.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Get these two out of here.
                          (off their hesitation)
                    Go.

      Scott and Isaac hurry over to pick Cora and Boyd up while 
      Derek turns to the closed door of the storage closet.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/BASEMENT/BOILER ROOM/STORAGE CLOSET - DAY6666

      Cowering in the corner, an utterly terrified Ms. Blake tenses 
      as the door CLICKS OPEN. She grabs for something to defend 
      herself. Finds a stapler.      TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/1341.

      Derek steps inside. With the light streaming in about him, he 
      looks like a Greek God come down from Olympus to save her.

      The stapler slips from Blake s grasp as he gently extends a 
      hand to help her up.

      INT. HOSPITAL/MORGUE - DAY6767

      In the dimly lit morgue, an exhausted Scott and Stiles look 
      over the body of Heather in front of them.

                                  SCOTT
                    So Boyd and Cora might not have 
                    killed anyone?

                                  STILES
                    You re going to wish they did.

                    Why?

                                  STILES
                    I m not totally sure yet, but that 
                    other girl who was out in the 
                    woods, Emily? They re eventually 
                    going to find her...

      EXT. WOODS - DAY6868

      Black shoes rush across wet leaves. Deputies following 
      Stilinski as he hurries through the woods.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    She s one of them. Emily, Heather, 
                    the guy Lydia found at the pool. 
                    All three were virgins.

      Stilinski slows when he finally spots Emily. She seems to be 
      standing against a tree. But as he steps closer he can see 
      that she s actually bound to it, wire around her neck.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    And all of them are going to have 
                    the same three injuries.

      As the other deputies watch, Stilinski slowly lifts Emily s 
      bloodied head to reveal the wire garrotting her slashed 
      throat.      TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/1342.

      Stiles covers Heather s body and looks up to Scott.

                    It s called the Threefold Death.

                                  SCOTT
                    So if they re not random killings, 
                    what are they?
