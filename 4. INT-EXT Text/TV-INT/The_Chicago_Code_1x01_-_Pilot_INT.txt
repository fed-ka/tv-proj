      Teresa walks with a tweaked Antonio.  She notices.

      Jarek and Caleb walk.  Jarek points to a FIRE ALARM.  

                                        JAREK
                    I say the word  institution , that s

      Jarek and Caleb mid-informing SEVEN ACCOUNTANTS of the 
      death of their boss.  Shock and tears.

                                        FEMALE ACCOUNTANT
                    Oh, my God. 

                                        JAREK
                    I m so sorry for your loss.  Linda was 
                    a good comptroller?  A good boss?

                    She was the best.                                                                                      19.


                                        JAREK
                    Can anyone think of any reason someone 
                    would harm her or her husband?

      A beat.  The group ponders it.  One man in the back, 
      PHILLIP (50 s) just looks down, worried.

                                        MALE ACCOUNTANT
                    Why would anyonedo this?

                    I honestly don t know.  Is this a 
                    pretty good institution to work for?

                                        MALE ACCOUNTANT
                    Sure.  I guess so.

      A beat.  Jarek looks over at Caleb, who doesn t move.

                                        JAREK
                    So it s a good institution.

                                        CALEB
                    I need to grab something from the car.

      Caleb walks out.

                                        JAREK
                    We re going to need a half hour or so 
                    with each of you to discuss what kinds

                    We have to do this now?

                                        JAREK
                    I m afraid so.  Is there a room we --


      Caleb looks around the empty hallway.  Lifts the plastic 
      Fire Alarm and PULLS the alarm.  RED INK sprays out onto 
    his hand as the ALARM SOUNDS.  Caleb can t believe it.


      Jarek reacts with surprise to the alarm.

                                        JAREK
                    I guess we can do the interviews 
                    tomorrow.  Everyone should clear out 
                    for their own safety.

    As the accountants quickly take things from their desks 
    and scurry out, Jarek grabs Phillip, the last to leave.                                                                                      20.


                                        PHILLIP
                    Hey.

                                        JAREK
                    You get outside, say you re going to 
                    call your wife, then call me.

      Jarek hands him a card.

                                        JAREK
                    Go.


      Teresa sits opposite SERGEANT TOM WORTHEN(57, white) 
    and his Union Lawyer, HENRY LISKWRIGHT(40 s, even 
      whiter).  Antonio holds up the wall behind Teresa.

                    hear me?  I will getyou first!

    But she s already gone --


    An attractive secretary, LILLY, professional, early 
      30 s.  Jarek and Teresa approach.

                                        TERESA
                      Superintendent Colvinand Detective 
                    Wysockifor the Alderman.                                                                                      26.


                                        LILLY
                    He s waiting for you.

    She rises, leads them to the door which opens to --


    The kind of office that only 30 years of running a city 
      from behind the scenes can buy.  Behind the desk sits 
      Chicago political machine legend PATRICK GIBBONS, 60.

                                        GIBBONS
                    Good to see you again, Teresa.

                                        TERESA
                    You too.  This is Detective Wysocki.

                                        GIBBONS
                    Can I get either of you a drink?

                                        TERESA
                    No thank you.

                                        GIBBONS
                    Lilly, just a scotch for me, please.

                                        LILLY
                    Yes, sir.

                                        GIBBONS
                              (to Jarek)
                    Or is it too early?

                                        JAREK
                    Is there such a thing?

                                        GIBBONS
                              (to Lilly)
                    I guess it s a double then.

    She nods, exits.

                                        GIBBONS
                    So this murdered couple that happened 
                    this morning...

                                        JAREK
                    Steve and Linda Walling.

                                        GIBBONS
                    This kind of butchery in my district, 
                    it s unacceptable.

                                        TERESA
                    Hopefully, we can eliminate this kind 
                    of crime in the entirecity.                                                                                      27.


                                        GIBBONS
                    Well, I m an optimistic man, Teresa, 
                    but I have the disadvantage of living 
                    in the real world.  Austin, Cabrini, 
                    we whack the moles where we can, but 
                    mypart of town?  We catch the 
                    bastards.  Tell me what you know.

                                        JAREK
                    Our canvass landed a real good looking 
                    suspect.

      Jarek hands Gibbons the sheet Det. Howell gave him.  
      It s a photo and rap sheet for WENDELL HOLMES, 30 s, 
      white, emaciated meth-head.

                                        JAREK
                    Wendell Holmes, was seen in the area 
                    just prior to the shootings.You see 
                    his sheet.  No stranger to violence.

                                        GIBBONS
                    So this looks like a meth-headstick-
                    up gone bad?

                                        JAREK
                    Probably.
                                (beat, casual)
                    But we re also looking into the wife s 
                    place of employment, Liffey 
                      Construction.  She was involved with 
                    some big city stuff, so we want to 
                    cover our bases there.

      Lilly enters with Gibbons  double scotch.

                                        GIBBONS
                    Thanks, Lilly.
                                (toTeresa)
                    Any resources you need.  Anything.


      DINA WYSOCKI, Jarek s ex-wife, 40, does house chores as 
    she cradles the phone against her ear --

                                        DINA
                    It s me.

                                        JAREK
                    You re on speaker.

                                        DINA
                    Who else is there?

      Jarek looks at Caleb, can t remember his name...

                                        CALEB
                    Caleb Evers, Ma am.

                                        DINA
                    Hi Caleb.  I m the ex-wife.

                                        CALEB
                    I m the soon-to-be ex-partner.

                                        DINA
                    Has he told you about his fiancee yet?

                                        JAREK
                    Dina.

                                        DINA
                    Twenty-seven years old.  Doesn t that 
                    seem a little young for Jarek, Caleb?

                                        CALEB
                    That seems a little young.

      Caleb nods  no  to Jarek.                                                                                      33.


                                        JAREK
                    What can I do for you, Dina?

                                        DINA
                    J.J. lefthis physics project at your 
                    house.  He says it s in the cubby.

                                        JAREK
                    When does he need it?

                                        DINA
                    Can you bring it by around nine?

      Jarek sees in his rear view mirror, WENDELL HOLMES.  

                                        JAREK
                    Sure.  Got to go.

      Jarek and Caleb exit the car.  Six Beat Coppers appear 
      from various nooks and crannies, guns drawn.

                                        JAREK
                    Wendell Holmes!  On the ground!

                                        WENDELL
                    I m not resisting!

      Wendell lays down.  Caleb pats him down as a beat copper 
      cuffs him.  Caleb pulls an I-POD from Wendell s pocket.

                                        CALEB
                    You know what goes well with these?  
                      Headphones.

      Caleb finds some keys.  Jarek turns to the Unis.

                                        JAREK
                    Take him to the station.

                                        BEAT COPPER #1
                    Any help executing the search warrant?

                                        JAREK
                    No.  I don t want any police presence 
                    here.  Clear out ASAP.


      Jarek opens Wendell s door with the keys.  They enter --


      Small, dark, a sty.  

                                        JAREK
                    Never ceases to amaze me how well 
                    crime pays.  Close it and lock it.
                                        (MORE)                                                                                      34.

                                        JAREK (CONT'D)
                                (offCaleb)
                    I m expecting visitors.

      Caleb shuts it, locks it.  They look around the place.  
      It s filthy, depressing, except for --

                                        JAREK
                    Always with the big TVs, these guys.

      A 50  plasma on the wall.

                                        JAREK
                    Find the remote, see if the game s on.

                                        CALEB
                    Game doesn t start until 2:20.

                                        JAREK
                    You mean the Cubs game, right?  
                    Because the Sox don t play today.
                                (Caleb s busted)
                    I knew it.  You re a lying, filthy 
                    Cubsfan.  You thought you could 
                    weasel your way into my good graces by 
                    pretendingto be a White Sox fan?

                                        CALEB
                    I grew up on the North Side.  We had 
                    Sandberg, Maddux, Grace and Dawson.  
                    What was I supposed to do?

      Jarek looks at Caleb like he rapes nuns for sport.

                                        JAREK
                    Search it.

    As they search different parts of the apartment --


      They walk down the hallway, approach Classroom 15.

                                        ANTONIO
                    That used to be Mrs. Estrada s class.

                                        TERESA
                    Still is.

      Teresa opens the door, waves Antonio inside to --


      Where twenty-five 4th graders (almost all Hispanic) sit.  
      Happy Birthday banners on the wall.

                                        KIDS
                    Happy Birthday, Officer Betz!

      Antonio looks at Teresa.  She smiles, nods him forward.

                                        MRS. ESTRADA
                    Antonio!

                                        ANTONIO
                    Mrs. Estrada.

    She hugs him.

                                        MRS. ESTRADA
                    Class.  Today is Antonio s twenty-
                    fifth birthday.  But fifteen years 
                    ago, he was a fourth grader in this 
                    classroom, just like you.  Who has 
                    questions for Officer Betz?

      Many kids raise their hands.  Antonio points to one.

                                        4TH GRADE BOY
                    How do you become a police officer?

                                        ANTONIO
                    Well, you stay out of trouble.  Decide 
                    you want to help people who can t 
                    always help themselves.  And then you 
                    need someone to give you a chance.

      Antonio sneaks a peak at Teresa.  She beams.                                                                                      36.



      Jarek and Caleb still rooting through the place, when 
      they hear action at the door.  Both draw their guns.

                                        WILL (O.S.)
                    Wendell?  Open up.

      A low knock.  Jarek opens the door to reveal two TOUGHS, 
      WILL and LIAM, both 20 s and Irish.  They see the guns --

                                        WILL
                    Easy...

                                        JAREK
                    And who are you?

                                        WILL
                    We re just looking for Wendell.

                                        JAREK
                    Come on in.  

                                        WILL
                    Nah, that s alright.  

                                        JAREK
                    Get in here.

      Jarek waves them in, closes the door behind them.

                                        JAREK
                    How you know Wendell?

                                        WILL
                    Just friends.

                                        JAREK
                    Oh yeah, how tall is he?

      Will doesn t know.

                                        JAREK
                    Who sent you here?
                                (beat, louder)
                    Who sent you here?

                                        LIAM
                    Screw this.  I m out.

                                        JAREK
                    You re not going anywhere.

                                        LIAM
                    Get an arrest warrant then, asshole.                                                                                      37.


      Jarek KICKS Liam in the GROIN, sending him to the floor.  
      Caleb freaks out.

                                        CALEB
                    Hey!

      Jarek GRABS Liam s head and SMASHES his face hard into 
    the floor.  Caleb tries to stop Jarek, but Jarek gets 
    one or two more shots in before Caleb gets him off.  
      Liam writhes in pain.  

                                        JAREK
                    Search the big mouth.

      Caleb searches Liam, while Jarek searches Will.

                                        CALEB
                    Just a wallet.

                                        JAREK
                    Let me see.

      Caleb tosses is to Jarek.  Jarek pulls out the license. 

                                        JAREK
                    Pleasure, Liam.  Who sent you to find 
                    Wendell?

                                        LIAM
                    Your mother, after I got done three-
                    wayingher and your sister.

      Jarek rushes towards him to kick his ass.  Caleb 
      intercepts him.  Caleb turns to Will and Liam.  

                                        CALEB
                    Get the hell out of here.

                                        JAREK
                    I m not done with him.

                                        CALEB
                                (sotto)
                    Yes you are.  Because if we bring them 
                    in, I ll have to write this all up.
                                (toWill and Liam)
                    Go.


      Jarek tosses the wallet back to Liam.

                                        LIAM
                    What about my license?

                                        JAREK
                    Mail away for a replacement.                                                                                      38.


                                        WILL
                    Come on.  

      Will and Liam beat it out of there.  A pause.

                                        CALEB
                    That was really not cool.

                                        JAREK
                    Starting tomorrow you won t have to 
                    worry about it.


      Jarek, Caleb and Yancy finish lunch. 

                                        YANCY
                    That was great.  Thanks again.

                                        JAREK
                    No problem.

      A waitress (PENELOPE) approaches.

                                        PENELOPE
                    Get you fellasany dessert?

                                        JAREK
                    Well, Penelope, that depends on Yancy.
                                (toYancy)
                    You pals with Wendell Holmes?

                                        YANCY
                    That s what that shakedown was about 
                    back there?  Forget it.

                                        JAREK
                    Here s the deal.  We can skip dessert, 
                    process you on the stolen merch... or 
                    we can forget about those charges 
                    while you order any dessert on the 
                    menu and tell us about Wendell.

      Penelope waits, curious.  After a beat.                                                                                      40.

                    Same.


      Teresa sits alone at a private table eating.  She looks 
      across the restaurant -- Antonio at the bar points Jarek 
    to her.  Caleb is with him.  Jarek tells Caleb to stay. 
    As Jarek walks across the room towards Teresa --

                                        TERESA (V.O.)
                    Jarek wasn t my first or last partner.  
                    But he was the only one to tell me how 
                    being a woman could make me a better 
                    cop.

                    Jarek could have had this job.  Never 
                    wanted to leave his car or play the 
                    political game though.  When I took 
                    the gig, we agreed... Six months to 
                    settle in, then we tear the city up, 
                    make some real overdue changes.  That 
                    was six months ago.

      Jarek arrives at the table.

                                        JAREK
                    Beautiful woman eating all alone?  
                    Doesn t seem right.  How reyou

                    You think it s the gun?

      Jarek sits.  Across the restaurant, at the bar --

                                        CALEB
                    They do this a lot?

                    She wouldn t do that --

                    Never know.

                    In the meantime, Alderman Gibbons 
                    wants another update.

                    We believe Linda Walling was targeted 
                    because of work she was doing at 
                    Liffey Construction.

                    Is there some reason you don t want us 
                    to search Liffey Construction?

                                        GIBBONS
                    No.  I mean it won t be necessary to 
                    get a warrant.  I know Liffey s owner.

    Off Jarek and Teresa, hiding their surprise --


      A dozen cops accompany Jarek, Teresa and Caleb in this 
      search.  We see Caleb talking on the side with WILL and 
      LIAM.  Jarek gives orders to two Beat Coppers.

                    Anything with the name Linda Walling 
                    or any paperwork relating to the

    The cops move off.  Caleb approaches Jarek and Teresa.

                    You find it odd that the two guys who 
                    came looking for Marshall today happen 
                    to be working after hours at the same 
                    place the dead lady worked?

                    He s not who he says he is.

      Beat.  Jarek and Teresa feign ignorance about Liam.

                                        JAREK
                    Seems like a regular knucklehead.

                    Yeah, he talks that game.  Looks it 
                    even, but he s smarter than he lets 
                    on.

                                        JAREK
                    You get that from two minutes of 
                    chatting up the guy?                                                                                      47.

                    It s the way he scans the place.  I 
                    see the gears moving inside his head.  
                    That s not the brain of some lowlife 
                    muscle.  I say we bring him in, figure 
                    out what his game really is.

      That would be awkward.  Before they need to respond, 
      Gibbons arrives with OWEN MCDONNELL, 50 s Irish.

                                        GIBBONS
                      Superintendent Colvin.This is the 
                    owner of Liffey Construction, my 
                    friend, Owen McDonnell.

                                        TERESA
                    Mr. McDonnell.

                                        GIBBONS
                    He may have something useful for you.

      McDonnell offers them a paper.  Teresa scans it.

                                        MCDONNELL
                    We have a vendor named Jasper 
                    Franklin.  He sells us piping.  He s 
                    been in town past few days, but he s 
                    on his way back to Atlanta tonight.

                    Plane leaves O Harein five minutes.  
                    Too late to go through channels to 
                    stop the flight.

                                        JAREK
                              (to McDonnell)
                    So you believe this Jasper Franklin 
                    may harbor terrorist intents?

                                        MCDONNELL
                    What?

                                        JAREK
                              (to Teresa)
                    Call the airport, tell  em a potential 
                      terrorist s about to take off.


      Jarek and Caleb with JASPER FRANKLIN, 30 s.  There s no 
      table in this room.  Just a bench attached to the wall 
    and two fold up chairs Jarek and Caleb use to get close 
    to Jasper.  Mid-interrogation Jasper s scared, breaking.

                                        JAREK
                    Why dyou want Linda Walling dead, 
                    Jasper?                                                                                      48.


                                        JASPER
                    I didn t even know the lady.

                                        CALEB
                    Then why are you sweating like we just 
                    entered you in a spelling bee?  Oh, 
                    because you re starting to realize the 
                    shooter ID dyou as the man who paid 
                    him five grand to do the deed.

                                        JAREK
                    Go ahead, Jasper.  Take your time 
                    accepting the reality of this 
                    situation.  We ll bring some food in.  
                    You want some menus?

      Beat.

                                        JASPER
                    Gibbons wanted her gone.

      Jarek perks up considerably.  Caleb can t believe it.

                                        CALEB
                    Alderman Patrick Gibbons?

                                        JAREK
                    Gibbons ordered the hit on Linda 
                    Walling?

                                        JASPER
                    Yeah.

                                        JAREK
                    He gave you the order directly?

                                        JASPER
                    Well, no.  I was talking to Owen 
                    McDonnell.

                                        JAREK
                    And McDonnell gave you the order on 
                    behalf of Gibbons?

                                        JASPER
                    Yes.  No.  Not exactly.  I was having 
                    dinner with McDonnell and he made a 
                    real point to tell me how this woman 
                    was becoming a real pain-in-the-ass 
                    for Gibbons, for the company.

                                        JAREK
                    And Gibbons wanted her dead?

                                        JASPER
                    He didn t say that.  He didn t have 
                    to.                                                                                      49.


                                        JAREK
                    So, no one gave you the order?

                                        JASPER
                    They didn t have to, you understand?  
                    She was a pain-in-the-ass to Gibbons.  
                    That s all he had to say.  You need to 
                    know these people.


      Antonio stands in front of a council of THREE GANG 
      LEADERS, all black.  Main guy is HORACE, 30.

                                        HORACE
                    Face to face was supposed to be with 
                    the main lady not some Mexican busboy.                                                                                      51.


                                        ANTONIO
                    She doesn t grant face to faces with 
                    gangs who break truces and drag 
                    corpses into the street.
                                (beat)
                    But, if you want the raids and the 
                    arrests to stop, I m here to negotiate 
                    terms... respectfully.


      Jarek lets himself into this two-story home with a key.

                                        JAREK
                    Dina?

                                        DINA
                    I m in J.J. sroom.


      Jarek enters to find Dina making the bed.  Jarek puts a 
      BACKPACK on a desk.

                                        JAREK
                    There s his physics thing-a-ma-jig.  
                    He here?

                                        DINA
                    No.

      Beat.  Then they rush each other and embrace.  Kiss 
      passionately.  He THROWS her on the bed.  Reaches under 
    her skirt and RIPS her panties off.  Animals.

                                        DINA
                    Break up with that tramp already.

                                        JAREK
                    She s not a tramp, she s my fiancee.                                                                                      52.


                                        DINA
                    When are you going to tell her?

                                        JAREK
                    It s a bad time.  Her mother s real 
                    sick.  I ll tell her soon.


      Jarek and Dina s 16 year old son, J.J., enters.

                                        J.J.
                    Mom!... Mom!

      J.J. climbsthe stairs, FLINGS open his door --


      Dina s fully dressed, making the bed.  No sign of Jarek.

                                        DINA
                    Would it kill you to make your bed?

                                        J.J.
                    I forgot my phone.

                                        DINA
                    You can t live two hours without it?

                                        J.J.
                    Why chance it?

      J.J. un-plugshis phone, takes it.  About to leave.

                                        DINA
                    Your father brought your physics 
                    project by.

    She points to it.  He grabs it on his way out.

                                        J.J.
                    See ya.

    The door slams downstairs.  She goes to the closet, 
      slides it open.  Jarek stands naked, t-shirtcovering 
    his privates, her panties in his other hand.

                                        JAREK
                    You usually like getting caught.



                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                      53.


                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      Gibbons watches a NEWS REPORT about the shooting of the 
      Superintendent and her driver.  Info is sketchy.

                                        LIAM (O.S.)
                    It s a real pleasure to finally get to 
                    meet you, Mr. Gibbons.

      Gibbons turns and we see Liam with Will.

                                        GIBBONS
                    Will says you can be of some use to us 
                    with constituency services.

                                        LIAM
                    Not sure what that means, but I d love 
                    to help with anything.

                                        GIBBONS
                    Well, thanks for coming by.  He ll let 
                    you know when we need something.
                                (yellsout)
                    Lilly.  Where s that drink?

      Will nods for Liam that s their cue to exit.  They do, 
      passing Lilly on her way in with a scotch.

                                        GIBBONS
                    Close the door.

      Lilly lets Liam and Will exit, then closes the door.  
      Gibbons sits in his leather chair, turns the TV up.  
      Lilly brings him his drink, places it in front of him.

                                        LILLY
                    Anything else?

                                        GIBBONS
                    Kiss my ear.

    She bends down and slowly french kisses his ear.

                                        LILLY
                    Something like that?

                                        GIBBONS
                    Don t stop.  It s working.

    She resumes kissing.  Whether it s the tongue in his ear 
    or the news on his TV, he smiles ever so slightly.                                                                                      55.



      A few cops inside.  Caleb paces as Jarek STORMS in.  
      Caleb intercepts him in a private spot.

                                        JAREK
                    How is she?

                                        CALEB
                    One bullet hit her vest.  Cracked rib.  
                    That s all.  She ll be fine.

                                        JAREK
                    Antonio?

                                        CALEB
                    He s dead.  Didn t have a chance.

      Beat.  Jarek takes it in.  Makes a choice.                                                                                      56.


                                        JAREK
                    I want the absolute truth... That gut 
                    feeling you had on Gibbons  guy, Liam.  
                    That a lucky guess or can you bring 
                    that kind of thinking on a daily 
                    basis?

                                        CALEB
                                (absolute truth)
                    I m really good.

      A beat.

                                        JAREK
                    Liam s undercover for us.  You re the 
                    third person, besides Liam himself, to 
                    know that fact.  You and I cruise the 
                    city, pick the cases that really 
                    matter, starting with who did this.

      Caleb wanted the job, but not at this price.

                                        CALEB
                    I ll bring up the car.

                                        JAREK
                    Where is she?

                                        CALEB
                    Around there.

      Caleb exits.  Jarek rounds the corner, sees Teresa, in 
      just her white undershirt, ribs WRAPPED, staring at --

      ANTONIO lying, shirtless, bloody, dead on a bed in an 
      otherwise empty room.  Jarek stands close for support.

                                        JAREK
                    You stopped wearing your vest when you 
                    got named Superintendent.

      Beat.

                                        TERESA
                    When I reassigned one of the cops 
                    today he got angry.  Made some 
                    threats.  Not really, but kind of.
                                (beat)
                    Antonio insisted I put on his vest.  
                    Wouldn t start the car until I did.

    She looks at Antonio.  It s too much for her.  Whether 
    she knows it or not, she s been waiting for Jarek to
