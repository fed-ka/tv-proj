A grim region where the sky hangs low and the wind can
knock a man off his feet.
On the side of the highway, a large, muscular man with
spiked blond hair: Ali Van Versh, 25.
He has a big bag in one hand and a cell phone in the other.
He talks on the phone as he continues walking:
ALI
It's me. It's Ali... I left. I took the kid
with me. She can't take care of him anymore.
I got into a fight with the guy she's with.
I don't know where to go. What do I do with
the kid? I can't talk. I don't have any more
credit... Call me back!
He hangs up quickly and turns to Sam.
ALI
Move it!
His phone rings. He immediately answers.
ALI
Yeah! Where is it? Shit! It's so far! How do
I get there? I don't know. Today or
tomorrow. Yeah...
Ali lifts Sam onto his shoulders with one arm. Sam is tiny,
he looks like a squirrel on his father's back.
2
Ali's face is turned toward the orange heat of an afternoon
sun.
Ali and Sam look at the sea, the beaches and hotels. It's
hot and beautiful. They walk by tanned people in shorts,
short skirts, sandals...
In their shapeless grey track pants, they look like hoboes.
Ali drags his sport bag with one hand and Sam with the
other.
Ali is on the phone:
ALI
I don't know. A big street that started at
the station. Yeah, by the beach. Behind? We
just came from there!
Ali pulls Sam away from one of the stairways that lead to
the beach...
SAM
I'm tired.
ALI
So am I. He's coming to pick us up. Come on!
Sam is extenuated. Ali has to heave him up onto a shoulder.
A four-lane avenue near the outskirts of town.
Ali is walking on the shoulder of the road, with Sam piggy-
back. A horn beeps. A refrigerated truck, blinking to get
to the side of the road. The window rolls down to reveal a
moustache and a cap: Richard.
4
A kitchen with mismatched furnishings. China and cheesy
wallpaper. Sam devours the cookies and Coke that Richard
gives him.
RICHARD
We all got fired after some Spanish guy
bought out the trucking company... Eight
truckers. I thought it over, discussed it
with your sister and figured I could do it
on my own. So I bought this truck with my
severance pay...
Ali has finished his cream cheese sandwiches. He gets up
and opens the old fridge.
RICHARD
Oops, poor man, not those! She'll kill you!
Start with the expired ones, on the top
shelf! They're organized by date. First the
top shelf, then move down.... Anna brings it
home from the supermarket where she works.
As soon as they reach their expiration date,
those idiots throw it all away, even if you
can still eat it for a week! (to Sam) You
want some more?
Evening is falling. At the back of the garden are a home-
made pen and doghouse. Four puppies come running. Sam
touches them through the chicken wire.
ANNA
You want to pet them?
She lifts Sam up over the wire mesh.
ANNA
Careful. Don't step on their tiny paws.
They're just babies.
Anna shows him how to feed puppies, then stands back up.
ANNA
(to Ali) The breeder's picking them up next
month. Brings in some money. Otherwise,
Richard and I were thinking 300 a month for
you and the kid... That okay?
ALI
Yeah.
ANNA
"Yeah" what? Is that too much?
ALI
It's not too much, but I don't have it. I
had to pay for the train...
ANNA
So what are you going to do?
ALI
I don't know. Find a job. Whatever.
ANNA
Yeah, whatever... You think there's any work
around here? You think there's any more here
than there? Where has that ever been the
case? When you told me you were coming down,
8
I said we couldn't afford houseguests!
ALI
What should I have done with the kid? Where
should I have gone?
ANNA
I have no idea, but if you stay here you
have to pay your share, or else go somewhere
else. As far as we're concerned, it's easy:
we can't! How long were you thinking of
staying?
ALI
I don't know.
She makes a tired gesture and goes back toward the house,
calling Richard on the way. Ali hears Sam in the kennel,
giggling in delight.
He looks around: the seedy garden, a metal shed leaning to
one side, what's left of an engine, an old, orange Special
50 moped, plastic junk, etc.
Overhead, a plane descends on Nice, its landing lights
shining.
Suddenly, Sam sees his father run out of the shop, trying
to shake a security guard hot on his tail. Sam watches them
disappear into a tiny lane.
Sam looks around a bit frightened.
9
Farther off, in a busy shopping district
Ali forces his way through hordes of tourists. The security
guard grabs him by the hood and forces him up against a
wall. They are both dripping with sweat and out of breath.
SECURITY GUARD
Unzip your jacket! Empty your pockets!
Ali keeps his cool.
ALI
Unzip it yourself!
Ali struggles free and smiles at the guy invitingly. The
guard tries to punch him. Ali dodges:
The guard hesitates a moment, until Ali lets fly a right
hook. The guard stumbles. A kick in the face sends him
flying into a stall. Ali lifts his arms in victory for the
benefit of the few, stunned passersby. He kisses his own
biceps, does three steps of a moonwalk and saunters off.
Sam is walking along the street by the beach amid the
terraces and ice-cream stores, looking for his father.
Then he sees the moped at the far side of the parking lot
where they had left it chained up. He walks toward it. A
voice calls out.
ALI
Hey! Here I am!
Ali crosses the street and kneels down in front of Sam who
is sniffling, tears in his eyes.
ALI
No need to cry. I wouldn't have left you all
alone.
Ali unlocks the moped.
10
In a small side street, Sam watches Ali sell a camera for a
few 20 Euro notes.
On the beach, Ali and Sam eat some McDonald's.
ALI
Are you happy here?
Sam nods.
SAM
Mm.
ALI
What do you like the most at Auntie's?
SAM
The dogs.
ALI
Is that all? Nothing else besides the dogs?
SAM
The truck.
ALI
The dogs and the truck. The house? Auntie?
The ocean?
SAM
The dogs and the truck.
Ali nods. Sam watches his Dad's fat fingers assemble the
plastic toy from his Happy Meal.
ALI
We have it good here...
Ali's fingers stop. Sam looks up to find his father
watching some girls in swimsuits go by.
They go for a swim, horsing around and making noise.
11
Saturday evening. The door to the Fever Ray night club.
Patrons wait, bouncers pick and choose. An imposing
Caucasian maneuvers the red rope. Behind him, Ali Van
Versch and Foued Latahoui, who looks like a lightweight
boxer, guard the door.
Ali wears a faded blue "ALTA Secu" jacket and stiff,
matching pants. Looking well-groomed, Foued is wearing a
white shirt and tie. Well-groomed.
A group of girls passes through the security barrier. Foued
acts like he's hesitating:
FOUED
Okay, I'll let you through because I'm
outnumbered. Four against one, I don't stand
a chance!
The girls smile and disappear inside. Ali watches them
vanish.
FOUED
You say something nice, anything. That way,
when they leave, they remember you and you
can hit on them. If they're a little
plastered, if things didn't go too well for
them, you're there with a nice thing to
say...
ALI
And it works?
FOUED
Sometimes. But you can't be dressed like
that. Like a parking lot attendant...
They are interrupted by the bouncer.
THE CAUCASIAN
(pointing) Fight!
They go running. Three guys are fighting like savages. Ali
and Foued clean house. Foued gets rid of gawkers. Ali
delivers a few random punches, lifts one of the guys off
14
his feet and grabs another by the collar.
While Foued chases the rowdy men toward the parking lot,
Ali helps a girl back to her feet. She's a pretty blond,
must be about 27 or 28, who has taken a punch in the face.
It is Stephanie.
ALI
Are you okay? Breathe out of your mouth. In
and out. Put your head back. Walk a little.
Walk and breathe...
He demonstrates how and takes her by the arm, forcing her
to walk. She looks groggy.
STEPHANIE
I have to go home...
ALI
You have friends here?
STEPHANIE
No, I came alone. I have my car in the lot.
I'll be fine.
ALI
You can't drive like that.
STEPHANIE
I'm fine. I'm fine, I said. Thanks.
ALI
You can't drive like that. I'll call you a
cab.
STEPHANIE
How do I get my car afterwards? Seriously,
I'll be fine. Trust me!
We hear a voice from the parking lot.
ANGRY MAN
Bitch!
Stephanie looks back.
15
ANGRY MAN
Yeah... you, you cunt. Bitch!
She ignores him, pretending not to see him. She then
notices the blood stains on her T-shirt.
STEPHANIE
Shit.
ALI
Where's your car?
The Fiat stops in front of a small building in a flowery
residential neighborhood. They climb out.
STEPHANIE
How will you get back?
ALI
I don't know.
She takes out her wallet.
ALI
No, stop!
STEPHANIE
For a taxi.
ALI
Don't worry. Got any ice at your place?
He shows her his wrist.
ALI
Ice cubes.
18
STEPHANIE
Wait, I'll go check.
ALI
I can come up.
STEPHANIE
No!
Even she is surprised by the brusqueness of her response.
STEPHANIE
(embarrassed) Someone's up there.
ALI
So what?
STEPHANIE
Wait here. I'll be right back.
She takes a few steps, fumbling for her keys. She
hesitates, then looks back.
STEPHANIE
Okay, come on up.
The empty stadium above the pool. The trainers walk along
the gangplanks busily.
In her diving suit, Stephanie leans over the "beach" of
pool 3. She taps on the surface of the water. A wave
forms, whirling around the pool.
The whale washes up on the "beach" beside her. She performs
what looks like a daily ritual. She examines the whale,
caresses it. The whale responds with uncanny gurgles.
Stock shots of a show at Marineland, or images which we
will film to resemble stock shots: wide-angle shots from
the stadium.
The sound equipment blares "Jump" by Van Halen, orcas shoot
out of the water, the audience applauds Little kids clutch
electric-blue dolphin balloons, getting splashed by the
orcas Images of the show are relayed on giant video
screens, orcas shoot by like torpedoes behind the plastic
protective wall in front of the main pool, etc
CUT TO:
Stephanie is on the rim of the pool. All around her: the
audience panics, a loudspeaker orders evacuation, Louise
leans over her.
STEPHANIE
What... What happened?
LOUISE
Tom and Niska... They got in each other's
way.
Then Louise sees blood spurting from the rips in her diving
suit. She tries to find a pressure point.
Stephanie sees Louise's face wet with tears:
STEPHANIE
Stop it, calm down. I'm fine!
Her hand searches for something at thigh level, without
finding it.
She faints.
Ali is wearing his MP3 headset. He runs down the road to
the beach, sweat dripping into his eyes.
Sam's toys are lying scattered in the garden, his half-
eaten snack is on the table. Ali takes off his headset.
ALI
Sam!
No answer. There is some noise over at the kennel. He goes
and finds Sam in the kennel, talking to the puppies.
ALI
What are you doing here?
27
Sam jumps and scuttles to the back of the kennel, but Ali
reaches in and grabs him by the arm. Sam is covered in mud,
straw and dog shit.
ALI
You're gross! You stink! Who's taking care
of you?
Ali drags him over to the garage to hose him down. The
water is freezing cold. Sam hops from one foot to the other
and screams.
SAM
Stop it, Dad! It's cold. Stop!
Sam shrieks. An 18 year old tomboy wearing a skimpy tee-
shirt comes out of a neighboring house: Joelle, the
neighbors' daughter.
ALI
Aren't you supposed to be taking care of
him? What the fuck are you up to?
JOELLE
I was next doing the laundry.
ALI
Take a look at him!
JOELLE
I'll put him in the shower.
ALI
(to Sam, crying) Don't go in there. It's
disgusting. You hear?
Joelle takes Sam and disappears inside.
Ali is drawn to the living room, when through the half-open
door he notices the flat screen turned onto a news channel.
Onscreen and behind the anchorwoman, he recognizes an inset
photo of Stephanie, the same he saw at her place, riding on
the back of a killer whale. 

Il manque une phrase
28
JOELLE
There was an accident at Marineland.
Ali answers without taking his eyes off the screen.
ALI
I know her.
Sam pulls off his towel. He watches his father who is
riveted to the screen, glued to the looping footage of the
accident.
The bluish light at the bottom the main pool at Marineland.
A diver is raking its bottom, wiping away sludge composed
of micro algae, paint chips and fish bones. He examines the
replacement mud and then, inside the drain, the mud being
replaced. He digs his hand into the sediment and feels
something there. He surfaces and deposits his find on the
rim of the pool: It is one of Stephanie's diving flippers,
with her foot cut off at the ankle.
31
CUT TO:
A HyperBrico DIY store in an industrial zone in Cannes. Its
windows shine in the night like an aquarium.
The Speciale 50 putt-putts in the early morning light. Ali
drives through a neighborhood of chain stores, Conforama,
38
Courtepaille, Leroy-Merlin...
A gated community made up of four story buildings, lawns,
bougainvillea and lavender. It looks pretty as a picture
and squeaky clean.
When they come out of the building's lobby, the sun hits
him on the head like a bad hangover.
ALI
Here.
Ali hands her a pair of sunglasses.
ALI
Where should we go?
STEPHANIE
I don't know. You're the one who wanted to
go out...
ALI
Should we go to the ocean?
STEPHANIE
I don't care.
He tries to push the wheelchair, but she stops him:
STEPHANIE
Stop it. I want to puke.
He notices that his moped is attached in the middle of a
sprinkler area. He goes to free it and gets splashed...
Heavy chain, padlock... he comes back with soiled hands.
When he comes back, she's gone. He sees the wheelchair
moving toward the seafront avenue. He goes to join her.
They are sitting at a table on a terrace facing the beach.
They remain silent. She looks at his huge fists, black with
axle grease.
ALI
I want to go in.
STEPHANIE
 ?
42
ALI
I feel like swimming!
STEPHANIE
Go ahead.
ALI
You don't want to?
STEPHANIE
Huh?
ALI
You don't feel like swimming?
She looks daggers at him.
ALI
You don't have a bathing suit?
STEPHANIE
Do you realize what you're saying?
ALI
Who the fuck cares? There's no one here!
STEPHANIE
Forget it.
He wavers a moment, then finally crosses the seafront
avenue.
Stephanie is at the top of the steps in her wheelchair.
Ali is talking with the beach boy when he notices her.
Ali and the beach boy carry her to the deck chair area.
Ali rents the whole shebang: parasol, beach towel, deck
chair and a small tube of sunscreen 50.
Sheltered under a parasol, she pancakes her face with cream
and watches him dive in, wearing his boxers, and noisily
and clumsily crawl some laps. His body is pink and white.
Huge and buff. Then she looks out to sea, the listless
waves washing in and out. The fresh feel of it all makes
43
her want to drink it all in.
He comes back, enthusiastic and dripping wet.
She looks around. The beach is deserted, other than for a
far off, elderly couple broiling in the sun.
STEPHANIE
Actually I think I will go in.
He looks at her. She covers herself with a towel and
wiggles out of her pants, revealing what remains of her
legs. Her stumps are white, with terrible scars at their
extremities.
STEPHANIE
You have to carry me. Help me...
ALI
(makes a gesture)... How, like this?
STEPHANIE
Yes.
He lifts her up and carries her to the water. He takes her
far enough in until she begins to float.
ALI
You okay?
STEPHANIE
Don't let me go! Not right away... Do it
gently.
She feels unsure of herself. He lets go of her gradually.
She starts to sink, then crawls forward, with power and
grace. She stops but has to paddle like a dog to tread
water. He joins her. She grabs onto him.
ALI
So?
STEPHANIE
I can't stop. If I do, I sink. Wait...
She gesticulates...
44
STEPHANIE
This is bothering me!
She takes off her T-shirt and hands it to him. Her breasts
press against Ali's chest.
STEPHANIE
Okay, you can let go.
She lets herself go and crawls like a pro. He stays put,
holding her t-shirt.
Twenty-five meters later, her head emerges. He hears a
burst of laughter.
Half asleep in a deck chair, he looks up from time to time
to see how she's doing.
She calls out to him. She is sitting in the water. She
motions for him to come and get her.
He helps her out and takes her into his arms. She hangs on
to him, still out of breath.
ALI
You swim like a real pro!...
She shuts her eyes.
STEPHANIE
Fuck that's good!
The beach is crowded now. Ali carries her back to the deck
chairs. Some bathers watch them go by, others look away.
They are stretched out in their chairs. She has wrapped her
lower body in a beach towel. They sunbathe.
STEPHANIE
Thanks.
ALI
Huh?
STEPHANIE
Thanks.
45
She rolls onto her back. He sees her breasts pointed
heavenward.
Outside, Ali has unwrapped the sandwich his sister had
prepared for him. A bit farther off, the aerobics
instructor is smoking in the sun. She has a short, buff
body. She smokes her cigarette like someone who counts them
out sparingly.
They remain like that a while, he chewing ands she smoking.
CUT TO
46
Sam is playing alone, perched up on monkey bars in the
schoolyard.
Through a wide window, he sees his father racing down a
corridor that runs alongside the schoolyard. The principal
is waiting for him at the door. Ali spurts out some quick
apologies.
Sam slowly slides off the structure. We hear the noise of
his hands skidding on metal.
56. EXT ANTIBES EVENING
The moped wheezes and sputters.
Ali and Sam are heading back home along the beach. Ali is
so big, the moped looks like a kid's bike. Behind him on
the luggage rack, he can feel Sam leaning into him. Sam's
hand rummages in his coat pocket for a box of Choco-BN
cookies. Ali takes one too.
To their left, a train noisily speeds by.
Louise briskly pushes Stephanie's wheelchair across the
residence garden. The warning lights on her 205 are
blinking in front of the gate.
Stephanie hangs onto Louise's neck. Louise lifts her out of
her wheelchair as best she can and into the passenger seat.
48
Louise bends down to buckle Stephanie's seat belt.
STEPHANIE
(annoyed) I can do the seat belt!
In front of the open trunk, Louise struggles to fold the
wheelchair.
LOUISE
Can't you call them to tell them we're going
to be late?
The day is over. The beach boy has already packed away most
of his paraphernalia. In the water, Ali and Stephanie are
out with some of the last swimmers.
Faithful to what by now seems to have become a habit, he
carries her piggyback to their lounge chairs. They come out
of the water in the middle of a discussion.
STEPHANIE
What kind of boxing? Thai? Do you use your
feet?
ALI
No, just fists I think. We bash each other's
faces and whoever's still standing at the
end wins. Hey, you're strangling me!
He puts her down on her chair.
STEPHANIE
Is it the first time you're doing this?
ALI
Yeah.
STEPHANIE
And you're not scared?
ALI
Of what?
STEPHANIE
How much do they pay you for this?
ALI
I don't know. About 500, 1000 maybe.
57
STEPHANIE
You're doing that for 500 euros?
ALI
Um, yeah.
STEPHANIE
You're going to get whacked on the face and
risk your health for 500 euros?
ALI
Risk my health? What are you talking about?
Why are you getting so worked up?
STEPHANIE
I'll give you the 500! Cancel it and I'll
give it to you tomorrow.
ALI
You can give it to me if you have too much
money, but I said I was doing it and I am.
That's all.
STEPHANIE
If it's not for money, why then?
ALI
I didn't say it's not for the money!
STEPHANIE
Why are you doing it?
ALI
Oh, stop driving me crazy! I'm doing it to
fight. For fun. Why did you clown around on
your fish? For the fun of it, right?
She grins.
STEPHANIE
Yeah and look how I ended up.
ALI
Spare me. You turn on the waterworks when
you feel like it.
58
She dries her eyes. He begins to pack things up.
STEPHANIE
Your fight, if you do it...
ALI
Mm?
STEPHANIE
You think I can come along?
A narrow road. Down below, a town. The Mercedes Vito with
the tinted windows lifts a cloud of dust.
Stephanie is in the back seat and has to hold on to the
overhead strap to avoid hurting herself.
At the end of the road is a gate guarded by two huge
homies. They signal Martial to over.
He rolls down his window and the two homies peer inside.
They see Ali and Stephanie in the back.
HOMEBOY 1
Who's she?
MARTIAL
His girlfriend.
Surprised, Stephanie looks at Ali, watching for his
reaction. He looks elsewhere. The gate opens. Martial
drives in.
Ali and Stephanie are alone in the car. Through the tinted
windows, they can see a concrete yard with boats dry-docked
around it and buildings with satellite dishes studding
every balcony. Some men are over in one corner,
discussing: Martial, his cousin and some other mean looking
guys.
In the shade, a bit to one side and surrounded by his fans,
is a bare-chested, muscle-bound North African. He warms up,
59
wagging his head from left to right.
ALI
(under his breath) Motherfucker's acting
like he's on Canal Plus.
STEPHANIE
Who are the other guys?
ALI
I don't know. Guys with money. Dealers.
A beat.
STEPHANIE
You okay?
ALI
Great.
Martial comes back with a wad of banknotes and slides into
the passenger seat.
MARTIAL
It's okay. Let's go. Fall against the big
one in black shorts. I told you. They're big
guys.
ALI
Okay. And the bets? How much is there?
MARTIAL
A little over 2000 for the time being. But
it'll go up during the final match.
STEPHANIE
What do I do?
MARTIAL
No girls. Stay in the car. (To Ali) You
ready?
Ali nods.
60
The blazing sun is melting the asphalt. A coin bounces
between pairs of basketball shoes.
The cousin picks it up. He points to Ali and the guy in the
black shorts.
COUSIN
You and you.
Ali pulls off his T-shirt, staring down his adversary.
Martial takes the T shirt and leans over to Ali.
MARTIAL
If you get into trouble, don't insist, just
fall.
Ali doesn't flinch. The cousin, the bettors and the other
fighters move away.
A cloud of dust, a narrow, bumpy road. Martial's car is
headed for the town below.
The afternoon sun has the entire coast sparkling. Ali is on
his moped, with the box between his knees, driving up the
coastal road. He looks splendid, wearing new clothes.
He finally sees what he was looking for: a group on the
beach, Anna, Richard and their neighbors, having a picnic.
CUT TO:
CU Ali and Anna are off to one side, talking.
ANNA
You see what you're like with him? You're
not around and when you are, you scream at
him. Damn, you hit him! Why did you take him
along if you act like that? You should have
left him.
ALI
Cut the shit. He's not dead. I didn't do it
on purpose. I'm sorry about it.
Anna avoids his glance. He rummages in his pocket, pulls
out the envelope of money and hands it to her.
ALI
Here.
ANNA
What's that?
ALI
Money. What I owe you plus the next few
65
months. You can count it.
She looks at the bills.
ANNA
Where did you get this? (pointing to his new
clothes) Same place?
ALI
I won a fight.
ANNA
A fight? What kind of fight? Is that the
only job you could find?
Is that why you have marks on your face?
ALI
Hey, will you take the money or not? Why are
you looking at me that way?
ANNA
Nothing.
He leaves her with the envelope and trots over to the rest
of the group.
They are packing away ice chests and folding things up. Sam
and his little friends are playing in the sand with the
John Deere tractor. Sam has a bandage on his forehead. Ali
sits down in the sand next to him.
ALI
(pointing to the tractor) You like it?
Sam continues to play, ignoring him. Behind them, Richard
is folding up parasols with the help of Che, a bearded
neighbor who is also there with all his family.
RICHARD
Have you eaten?
ALI
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
CH
You don't want to drink something before I
66
pack up?
Ali shakes his head no'. He looks at Joelle, Che's
daughter: a tomboy with boobs.
ALI
(to Sam) You want to go for a swim?
Ali and Jolle take turns tossing Sam into the waves. The
child laughs so hard, he swallows water.
Ali takes Sam into his arms.
ALI
Give me a kiss.
SAM
I don't want to.
ALI
Give Daddy a kiss!
SAM
No.
ALI
(using a deep voice) Give Daddy a kiss!
SAM
(deep voice too)... No!
Ali kisses him and hugs him tight.
The horn beeps. Out of breath, in a sweat, Ali looks back
and sees Richard and Sam in the truck. They slow down and
pull up to him. Richard lowers his window.
RICHARD
We're going to school. Want to come along?
Ali shakes his head and continues jogging. The truck
disappears.
A street near the beach. The weekend is beginning. The
streets are crowded. Ali is on the phone.
ALI
Where are you? I can't see you. Where?
He looks every which way until he sees her, a few feet
away. She is standing upright, in a light pair of pants,
with her canes hidden behind her back. It takes some time
to register. She smiles at him.
70
ALI
That's fucking amazing! I was looking for a
wheelchair...
STEPHANIE
Stop looking. No more wheelchairs!
ALI
Since when?
STEPHANIE
Two days.
ALI
You could have told me!
STEPHANIE
Why? Is it a problem?
ALI
No, I don't know. You're like before.
STEPHANIE
Well, not exactly.
ALI
Go on, let's see.
She takes a few steps forward, leaning on her canes. He
whistles in admiration.
STEPHANIE
I need to get my balance but supposedly that
doesn't take long.
ALI
It must be like walking on stilts...
STEPHANIE
I don't know. I've never walked on stilts
before.
ALI
You look taller. Does it hurt?
71
STEPHANIE
A little, but it feels good too.
ALI
Want to go for a swim?
She stops.
STEPHANIE
The beach... pff, I don't know... It's
different today... I don't think I want to
get undressed.
Stephanie uses one of her canes to push open the door to
the staff room. The room is apparently empty.
STEPHANIE
Louise? Louise, are you here? Is anyone
here?
No answer.
She looks over the office she once knew so well and that
hasn't seen again since her accident: the photos on the
wall, the diagrams, the case histories, the animals' names,
etc...
Up in the bleachers, Stephanie looks over all the pools,
the big one as well as the others... suddenly, in n 3, a
huge but limp black dorsal fin appears.
Weighed down by her prostheses, Stephanie has to lie down
on the rim of pool n 3 to reach the water. She reaches out
and slaps the water with the palm of her hand. Nothing
78
really happens, a black mass just keeps circling at the
bottom of the pool... She slaps again and the black mass
swims faster and faster... a wave is formed around the
sides of the pool, a wave that swells higher and higher...
Stephanie's hand again slaps the water and, suddenly, Niska
emerges.
CUT TO:
Niska washes up. Stephanie caresses her and weeps softly,
like someone caught unawares.
LOUISE (OFF)
(gently) Stephanie?
Stephanie looks back to discover Louise and three other ex-
colleagues. They have been there a moment, surprised,
unsettled and ill at ease.
STEPHANIE
I stopped by the office but there wasn't
anyone.
Stephanie stands up with the help of her canes. The guys
rush over to help her. They hug and kiss. All four remain
like that for a moment.
Sun and music. The public is beginning to invade the lanes
and paths.
Stephanie, Louise and the other keepers are on the terrace
of the employees' cafeteria. They are thrilled and
reassured to see her again. At times a hand touches her
arm or shoulder. Sometimes an acquaintance comes over and
kisses her.
Under the table, Stephanie types oper?' into her cell
phone, then looks up and returns to her surroundings.
We can imagine the "How are you?" "And you?" "Great". The
"Let me get a look at you... You look wonderful!"...all a
79
bit strained, but friendly. Louise, who is sitting next to
her, leans over to her:
LOUISE
(softly) See? It wasn't hard!
They smile at each other and return to the conversation in
progress. Stephanie's cell phone vibrates on the table. She
discreetly checks the answer, and when she looks up,
exchanges a glance with Louise.
From that glance, we cut to:
The group of trainers has accompanied Stephanie to a taxi.
... then goes to the garden where he startles Anna:
ANNA
I didn't know you were here. You scared me.
What were you up to?
ALI
I was talking?
ANNA
You're not alone?
ALI
I'm with a friend.
ANNA
You bring girls back to my place now?
ALI
She's a friend, I said.
Just then, the basement door opens and Stephanie appears on
her crutches. Anna is dismayed. Ali motions to Stephanie:
ALI
(to Stephanie) Let me introduce you to my
sister! (to Anna) This is Stephanie. You
know the girl from Marineland.
Stephanie offers her hand to Anna who takes it, then
realizing what she's doing, puts the other to her mouth:
ANNA
Oh, my God. Poor thing!
82
Sam arrives with his snack. Stephanie looks at him.
STEPHANIE
So that's him?
They are sitting around the garden table. Anna comes
carrying a tray.
ANNA
They were out of grapefruit. I took tropical
fruit.
She puts some glasses and two tetra packs of fruit juice on
the table. Through a hole in the oilcloth, Stephanie can
watch Sam playing under the table.
ANNA
I'll make tea. I have some cookies. You
drink tea, don't you?
STEPHANIE
Don't bother. This is perfect, I swear.
Thanks.
Before Stephanie can even finish, Anna is already on the
way back to the kitchen.
ALI
You don't want to get going?
STEPH
Wait, your sister...
ALI
You freak her out. Can't you see? She feels
like a cashier with you. Pathetic with her
tea and cookies. It's a pain.
Stephanie leans on a cane to stand up.
ALI
What are you doing?
STEPH
I'm going to help her.
83
ALI
No need to overdo it.
His opponent's guard is up, closed tighter than a safe.
Behind his fists, Ali can see the guy's frozen stare. And
then suddenly he breaks loose: a series of feints and a
kick behind the ear.
He hears himself growl, the light becomes electrifying. He
is on the ground, protecting himself as best he can. He
tries to block his opponent's arm. He hears himself
wheezing and panting like a pair of bellows. He sees his
blood splatter his opponent.
ALI (OFF)
... All of a sudden, in your mouth, it's
like it tasted like bone. A taste of rust
and bone.
STEPHANIE (OFF)
Because you think bone has a taste?
85
ALI (OFF)
Yeah, there I did.
Then, through the spectators' legs, he sees something:
sunlight reflected off the Mercedes door that has just
opened on a pair of shoes attached to two prostheses, a
pair of shorts He also sees the heads of the tough guys
who turn back to look.
He breaks free, struggles to his feet, spits up a clot of
blood and returns to the task at hand.
His opponent tries to get up. Ali jumps on him to finish
HIM OFF
Through the door of the club, we hear snatches of the
introduction to Thunderstruck.
People are sweating and trying to get into the Fever. Foued
lets Martial, Ali, Stephanie and Khadi through. Virile bear
hugs and handshakes.
FOUED
The Cousin's waiting for you inside. Table
to the left of the bar.
Ali knows and greets everyone. Stephanie is in the middle
of the group. She holds herself up on the shoulders of
these big, caring guys and lets herself be carried along.
She feels good
The smoking area is located outside, and a bit farther off,
the dope smoking area. Behind the smokers, we hear noise
from the club. Cousin is puffing on a spliff. Stephanie
watches, holding her champagne goblet. He offers it to
her. She accepts and takes a drag.
COUSIN
Can I talk to you?
She nods "yes".
COUSIN
There's something I'd like to know... The
fish that ate your legs...
She wasn't expecting that.
STEPHANIE
Yes?
COUSIN
Is it true it's still there?
STEPHANIE
Yeah... where else would it be?
COUSIN
They didn't shoot it? Or put it down,
whatever?
92
STEPHANIE
Why would they do that?
COUSIN
I don't know... when a dog attacks you, they
kill it. And the fish gets off. Don't you
mind that the thing that ate your legs is
living it up in its shitty fucking aquarium?
STEPHANIE
No. And I don't want anything to happen to
it. Now more than ever!
He looks at her, incredulous, but with admiration.
COUSIN
(imitating her) "Now more than ever". Listen
to you!
He takes another drag.
COUSIN
(imitating her) Tututu-tu-tutu...
They laugh.
STEPHANIE
Do I sound like that?
COUSIN
Tututu...
Early morning. The shrill screech of the sea gulls and the
milky light of a day that looks like it's going to be
sunless.
Stephanie drinks her coffee at the only table on the
terrace. Behind her, chairs are still piled up and the
waiter is slowly getting to work.
A silhouette appears on the sidewalk. It's Ali, in the same
clothes as last night. He joins her and takes a seat.
ALI
You okay?
STEPHANIE
Fine.
95
ALI
Did you stay late?
STEPHANIE
I can't remember. Afterwards the cousin took
us to a club at la Colle sur Loup... It
sucked and it was 5 a.m. And you?
ALI
Normal. (to the waiter) A large coffee with
milk and bread with butter!
A beat.
STEPHANIE
You think it's good that we're having this
conversation?
ALI
What conversation?
STEPHANIE
That I ask how it was with the girl last
night and you answer normal.
ALI
What do you want me to say?
STEPHANIE
Nothing.
He grimaces at her mood.
ALI
Oh la!
STEPHANIE
"Oh la" what? You think it's normal leaving
with that bimbo in front of me? What would
you say if I did the same thing?
ALI
Nothing.
STEPHANIE
Oh yeah? You wouldn't care?
96
ALI
You're pissing me off. What's your problem?
STEPHANIE
Wait, let me put it differently. What I am
for you? A friend? A pal?
Sort of a buddy, like Foued and the others?
ALI
STEPHANIE
Tell me something: do you and your buddies
fuck every now and then?
He snickers.
STEPHANIE
No? Really? Never?
That's the difference.
Her looks at her.
STEPHANIE
Dammit, stop looking at me that way!
ALI
How am I looking at you?
The waiter arrives with Ali's order. She tones her voice
down a notch.
STEPHANIE
You wanted us to continue... Isn't that what
you told Martial?
ALI
What are you talking about, fucking or
fighting?
STEPHANIE
Well, we have to go about it well. We have
to show each other manners, and
consideration...
ALI
Manners?
97
STEPHANIE
Hey! Stop acting like an idiot. Do the words
bother you? You know what I mean.... Tact...
You've never stopped being tactful with me.
A beat. He looks away.
STEPHANIE
So... is that a plan?
She waits for his mind to come back before continuing.
STEPHANIE
We'll continue... but not like animals.
He smirks, with a flick of the chin.
STEPHANIE
Cat got your tongue?
Ali stirs his cup without answering. He feels her eyes on
him. He smiles.
ALI
I'm oper now.
STEPHANIE
What?
ALI
You made me oper. It's you! It's because
it's all you're talking about!
STEPHANIE
(softly) You are really a dog.
He stands up.
STEPHANIE
What are you doing?
ALI
I'm getting out of here.
STEPHANIE
Why?
98
ALI
I'm fed up.
STEPHANIE
You're bored?
ALI
Yeah.
STEPHANIE
What I'm saying bores you?
ALI
Yeah.
STEPHANIE
Are you acting like a jackass on purpose?
ALI
Aren't you being an ass by putting words
everywhere?
He sits back down. She watches him eat his sandwiches.
STEPHANIE
I'm the one who's leaving.
She gets up.
Ali finishes his coffee.
Stephanie is at a teller's window, withdrawing a rather
large amount of cash.
A machine counts out the bills, while the employee stuffs
wads of them into an envelope.
112. EXT/INT USED CAR DEALERSHIP. DAY
Pennants flap in the wind, the pennants of a used car
dealership.
CU: car doors opening, automatic gearboxes, Stephanie's
"feet" testing pedals, bucket seats, backseats, tinted
windows opening and closing, etc.
Through the tinted windshield of a Nissan Pathfinder SUV,
Ali watches Stephanie, wearing a tight T shirt and leaning
on her cane, talking with Cousin and some bettors. The
discussion looks intense.
Stephanie returns to the car. Below her pedal pushers, her
prostheses sparkle in the sunlight. We hear salacious jibes
from the surrounding buildings.
She opens the car door.
ALI
How much is there?
101
STEPHANIE
3400. Are you ready?
Walking with a slow, deliberate sway - aware of the effect
she's having - she ceremonially opens the passenger door.
The remarks cease.
Music.
104
The road speeds by. Sun. Road signs with the names of
Italian cities. The landscape has changed.
Wearing her baseball cap and sunglasses, Stephanie drives
with her elbow out the window. On the radio, we hear the
voice of an Italian DJ.
Ali jogs along the sea shore. He sweats, huffing and
puffing. He stops, takes a few steps, then continues, but
soon stops again. It looks as if his feet are weighing him
down. Traffic speeds by. He stands still and stares into
the near distance.
Nothing.
Out of breath, Ali pushes open the gate and climbs the
stairs.
In the half-light of the basement, a rectangle of light has
formed where the door opens onto the street. Stephanie
looks over Ali's mess: his magazines, body building
equipment, dirty T-shirts, track suits hanging over a
trestle...
Anna is standing against the light at the door and, a bit
farther off, Sam is sitting on the stairs watching them.
ANNA
In his message he said he was in Strasbourg.
No news since. I don't know what he's doing
111
there, or even if he's still there. Has he
called you?
She shakes her head "no".
ANNA
Did you try the gym?
STEPHANIE
Yeah. They don't know.
ANNA
If I had an address or a number, I'd give it
to you... Even if I think it's dumb. Do you
believe me?
STEPHANIE
Yes.
ANNA
After what he did to me...
Sam sees Stephanie join Anna near the door. She's about to
leave.
ANNA
He abandoned his kid. He doesn't give a fuck
about anything. All he ever cared about was
himself. He's totally selfish.
Sam watches the two women swallowed up by the light.
STEPHANIE (OFF)
You don't know him.
ANNA (OFF)
Me? What did you expect with him?
STEPHANIE (OFF)
I don't know. Not this.
Fade to black.
Black.
112
A frosty landscape with trees that look like they've been
engraved in ink... A group of twelve joggers in blue track
suits run across a landscape of gray sky and snow. Some
shadowbox while running.
Ali is wearing a wool cap pulled down around his ears. He
runs alongside Foued.
A truck rushes headlong through the countryside. First it
is day, then night.
Richard lowers his window.
113
RICHARD
I can't come in any further or I won't be
able to get back out!
Ali checks out the huge semi.
ALI
Looks like you changed trucks!
RICHARD
Bosses, in fact. I'm back to being
exploited.
Ali doesn't insist. Richard opens his door to let out Sam
who is already trampling him, trying to get out.
RICHARD
(to Sam) Got everything? Your bag, your
coat, your hat, your mittens? You haven't
forgotten anything? Now give me a kiss.
Sam gives him a kiss. Richard slips him out and into Ali's
arms.
ALI
How are things there?
RICHARD
They're okay.
ALI
My sister?
RICHARD
She found a job at a school cafeteria. She
seems to enjoy it.
ALI
Does she know about today?
RICHARD
Yes. She says it's good for the kid.
ALI
Tell her I can't help out for the time being
but that as soon as I have a little money...
114
RICHARD
Don't worry. When's your fight?
ALI
Next month. On the 9th.
Richard smiles admiringly.
RICHARD
Keep us posted if you win.
ALI
Sure I will.
RICHARD
Yeah, right... Okay, I'm off. I'll deliver
my load in Colmar and pick up the kid at
around 7, okay?
ALI
Okay.
RICHARD
No later, because I have to be back tomorrow
at 11.
The two men say good-bye. Sam waves good-bye.
A path runs through fields and into a clump of fir trees.
Ali pulls a plastic sled with Sam on top. Whenever there is
a slope, he lets Sam glide down it and runs after him.
Snow falls from the trees. He looks up and sees a couple of
squirrels jump from branch to branch. Sam has never seen
any before. Ali neither.
Sunlight filters through the branches. A group of cross-
country skiers trudges by.
SAM
I want to skate too!
115
ALI
They're not skating. They're skiing.
SAM
No, they're skating.
ALI
They're skiing, I said!
SAM
Skating.
A few steps on:
ALI
Skiing.
SAM
You're annoying me.
They take a break at a picnic area, where they eat some
sandwiches and drink orange soda.
ALI
(his mouth full) Does Auntie still have
dogs?
SAM
No, now it's chickens.
ALI
In the garden?
SAM
Yeah, in the cage. They lay eggs.
ALI
That's good.
SAM
But Auntie doesn't want me to take the
chicks in my room.
ALI
She's right. They're disgusting. (pointing
to his sandwich) Finished? You want some
116
applesauce?
Afternoon.
On the way back, they find a frozen pond. Ali carefully
advances on the ice. He tests it. Jumps on it. Then he
lets himself go and glides across the ice.
ALI
You can go. But not too far!
Sam starts slipping and sliding. He falls down. He lies on
the sled and lets it glide.
Ali pees behind a tree.
Sam is far away.
ALI
Come on, we have to head back!
SAM
5 minutes.
ALI
Now!
SAM
(showing his fingers) 5 minutes!
ALI
5 minutes.
And then suddenly, instead of gliding, the child sinks. He
tries to climb out and sinks again. A thin layer of ice is
forming over him.
SAM
Daddy! Daddy!
ALI
Shit!
Ali rushes to the pond, but Sam is already iced over. He
kneels down and then crawls on his stomach toward the hole.
Sam has disappeared. Ali shoves aside snow. He looks
everywhere, but sees nothing. And then he hears a noise,
blows like signals coming from under the ice. Ali crawls
117
over and clears away snow as best he can. Under the ice, he
sees Sam's face, staring wide-eyed.
Ali begins to pound both his fists on the ice, like pistons
or pestles... As if pounding on his punching bag.
139. UNDER THE ICE. DAY
Underwater, we hear the sound of dull thuds. Sam sees his
father's fists pound on the ice. He sees bloodstains.
The ice cracks, a bloody fist searches the water for him.
Sam closes his eyes.
Evening is falling. Ali has stretched Sam out on the rim of
the pond. The child has turned blue. He tries mouth-to-
mouth resuscitation, he massages his heart and rubs him
down.
Ali's respiration has become a grunt, then a groan.
He runs. He has stowed Sam behind the front of his parka
and runs as fast as he can. He slips, gets back up and runs
again... he again breathes into Sam's mouth... while still
running...
