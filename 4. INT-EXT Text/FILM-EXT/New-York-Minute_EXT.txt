CLOSE ON the anxious, sweating, frightened face of DREW
MacLEOD, 17, running to save her life. Think Dustin
Hoffman in Marathon Man -- someone, something -- is after
her but UNSEEN.
She glances fearfully behind at her mysterious pursuer,
her BREATHING becoming more labored.
Cutting through a deserted park, she leaps a bench.
Above her, the thin morning sun has only begun to lighten
the leaves.
Around the corner, she's back on a sidewalk lined with
beautiful homes, all quiet at dawn, the only noise her
racing FOOTSTEPS and quickening BREATHS.
DREW'S POV - HER OWN FRONT DOOR
and safety loom half a block down. She pours on the
effort, hurdles a hedge, jumps the stairs and makes the
door, rips it open, bolts inside and SLAMS it shut.
ANGLE ON THE SHRUB
where, with the CAMERA AT GROUND LEVEL, a GOLDEN
RETRIEVER PUPPY, unable to leap the hedge, PLOWS INTO IT
HEADFIRST and disappears. YELP!
Quinn hops in her Saab.
ANGLE ON the doorway, where Drew pauses, takes a deep
breath to brace herself, then walks like a condemned
prisoner to her mother's car and climbs in.
10.
Commuters all jump from their cars and into the station.
Parker's on the platform. The Conductor climbs back on
the train into the FIRST CAR.
PARKER
(calling after)
I guess you were never young and
randy!
This is when she sees Drew sitting in the train window,
smiling and giving her a little victory wave.
16.
ACTION
Parker steps outside where it's just as crowded. She
scopes the situation, which isn't good -- stranded
COMMUTERS jostle for the few remaining TAXIS.
TWO EXECUTIVES get into a shoving match.
To the left, a couple of BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CARS --
standard car service rigs -- sit IDLING, each with a
DRIVER next to it, holding up his sign with his client's
name scratched on it.
An EXECUTIVE (#2) passes her, finger in the air,
signaling the FIRST DRIVER who holds a sign that read:
"Wilcox."
EXECUTIVE #2
That's me.
With no further ado, the driver opens the back door for
him, the Exec climbs in, the driver hustles around to his
side and in an instant, the car leaves the chaos behind.
Parker raises an eyebrow.
Hm.
The second driver (BENNIE) with a head like a cinder
block and no neck, is talking on his cell phone and
holding up a sign, "SCARPELLI."
Parker shoots a finger into the air. This barely gets
his attention but he nods, nonchalantly. Parker signals
again -- one minute -- then turns back inside.
Parker pulls Drew toward the Town Car.
DREW
What's this?
PARKER
A car service.
DREW
Car service? You couldn't have
called for a...
But Bennie opens the door for Parker like he's done it a
thousand times.
BENNIE
Morning, miss.
PARKER
Good morning. Thank you.
My
sister's coming, too.
Drew KNOWS SOME SKETCHY SHIT IS GOING DOWN buy she's only
got this instant to consider. She glances at the
STRANDED MOB descending on a lone approaching CAB,
engulfing it.
PARKER
You want to make that interview,
or not?
Drew lets herself be pulled inside. Bennie shuts the
door and waddles around to his side.
They hit the sidewalk and without breaking stride, race
around the first corner, looking back over their
shoulder.
PARKER
He's stuck at the light!
VRROOOM!
Here comes the Lincoln storming around the
corner.
DREW
He has no respect for traffic
laws!
They run into the first ALLEY and hunker down by a
GARBAGE CAN. The Lincoln flies past. They dash back
out, the same way they came.
SCREECH!
Bennie LOCKS UP the WHEELS!
They round the same corner going the opposite way and
Parker pulls them into the first door...
The girls practically have to drag the key around to the
restroom on the side.
Parker puts the key in and slowly... slowly...
CREAKING... opens the GATES OF HELL
ON THE GIRLS -- WHO STARE IN HORROR INTO THE ABYSS FOR A
BEAT, THEN:
GIRLS
AHHHHHHH!!!!
CUT TO:
The bus pulls over then pulls away, leaving the girls on
the sidewalk.
PARKER
See?
New York. We made it.
DREW
I could be arrested for vagrancy
looking like this.
PARKER
Listen.
I've got an idea.
DREW
No. No ideas. I'm going straight
to that interview and wait,
without moving or speaking,
especially to you, for four hours.
PARKER
(ignoring her)
Come on! We're going to the
Plaza! We can be Eloise! We'll
get a nice room, you can take a
shower and I'll swap clothes with
you! Simple as that!
DREW
Do you have the slightest clue
what that would cost?
(CONTINUED)
28.
CONTINUED:
PARKER
So? You've got the emergency
credit card Mom gave you, right?
Drew's suddenly looking at her EMPTY HANDS.
PARKER
What's wrong?
DREW
(dawning realization)
Oh.
My. God.
PARKER
Where's your, uh, stuff?
DREW
(near coma)
I left it in his car.
PARKER
Oh.
DREW
He knows where I live. He's going
to hunt me down and kill me.
PARKER
Come on, Drew. I don't think even
the Mafia kills people just for
scamming a ride. Quit being
paranoid.
(beat)
So, we don't do the Plaza. I've
got...
Parker digs in her pockets.
PARKER
Six dollars and thirty-two cents.
DREW
That won't get me hosed down at a
car wash.
PARKER
What are we thinking? You've got
your secret-safety twenty!
DREW
(beat)
My secret-safety twenty. Of
course. But it's only for
emergencies.
(CONTINUED)
29.
CONTINUED:
Parker looks her sister right in the eye.
DREW
Yeah.
Drew takes off her shoe, lifts the inner sole and pulls
out a twenty, then realizes:
DREW
Hey, how'd you know about my
secret-safety twenty?
PARKER
That's not important now. But
let's just say that it's a good
thing for you I think those shoes
are so ugly I never borrowed them.
(pointing)
Hey, how about there?
Parker points to hotel where the dilapidated sign reads:
THE RITZY PLAZA -- HOURLY RATES, HOT TUBS.
DREW
No. I want to get clean, not
contract hepatitis.
PARKER
(sotto voce)
Twenty-six dollars and thirty-six
cents.
DREW
We touch nothing.
Parker leads them inside.
Panicked, Drew sprints down the sidewalk with Parker and
the Desk Clerk in tow.
Laying the hammer down, the Desk Clerk blasts past Parker
-- he's a midget, but he's got wheels.
PARKER
Drew!
STOP!
CUT TO:
"TODAY SHOW" SECURITY GUARDS and NYPD descend on the
crowd.
NYPD OFFICER
All right.
Who's the wise guy?
Parker pulls Drew out of the pile-up and grabs the key,
tossing it away from them, sending the Desk Clerk
scrambling after it.
The two girls HIGH TAIL IT around the corner.
Winded,
they stop.
PARKER
Man, that little guy could really
motor. Why'd you bolt?
DREW
There was a rat, Parker. A rat
the size of a Doberman eating my
foot.
PARKER
That was all our money.
DREW
Our money?
OUR MONEY?!
PARKER
Key down, you're going to have an
attack.
(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED:
Drew's sucking on her inhaler but is so irate she spits
out the words.
DREW
Parker, it was not 'our' money and
this is not 'our' day in New York.
What it is, is quite possibly the
most important day of my life.
I've resigned myself to the fact
that you don't give a crap about
what you do with yours, but if you
could find it in your heart, your
tiny, cold steel heart, to respect
what this means to me, I would
appreciate it.
But Parker's not listening.
She's staring intently...
... ACROSS THE STREET where several TOWN CARS are parked,
the DRIVERS chatting next to a HOT DOG/PRETZEL CART.
Among them is Bennie, sipping coffee.
Parker spots him
and freezes.
DREW
You're not even listening. That's
typical. Look, we're splitting
up. Give me back my secret safety
money.
PARKER
(still looking past
Drew)
You know how I told you not to be
paranoid?
DREW
Paranoid?
PARKER
What I meant was, it isn't
paranoia if someone really is
chasing you.
Parker tries to subtly indicate with her eyes that Drew
should look across the street.
DREW
What's wrong with your eyes?
PARKER
(whispering)
It's him.
(CONTINUED)
35.
CONTINUED:
Drew finally turns and she, too, freezes.
PARKER
Quiet.
Don't run. He'll see us.
Not wanting to draw his attention, the Girls shuffle off
quickly down the street.
ON Bennie -- squinting across at them. Can he make them
out in the crowd? He nods to ANOTHER DRIVER, tosses his
coffee cup and climbs in behind the wheel.
DREW
HE SAW US!
The girls break into a run.
DREW
How'd he find us?
PARKER
Maybe it's just coincidence!
DREW
Or maybe WE TOLD HIM WHERE WE WERE
GOING!!
She points up at the street sign -- 57th and 5th.
Oops.
PARKER
Come on!
Parker leads her into traffic, HORNS BLARING, as they
weave their way across. On the far side, a HORSE
CARRIAGE pulls away from the curb and at the last minute,
Parker spots a fresh pile of...
... HORSE SHIT, which she manages to leap. Drew,
however, ISN'T GOING TO MAKE IT OVER. She closes her
eyes.
PARKER
Jump!
Drew stumbles, wrong-foots the takeoff but somehow
manages to get across it to the curb. For just a BEAT,
we see her surprised face. Hm. I did it.
Then they see Bennie crossing in traffic, huffing and
puffing after them and not seeing the pile, which he hits
in full stride, slips on, and PLOPS INTO on his ass.
This gives the girls the opening they need and they ditch
inside some revolving doors.
36.
... and scurry down the stairs only to find that THE
LADDER DOESN'T REACH.
(CONTINUED)
43.
CONTINUED:
Parker hangs and then drops onto the top of a DUMPSTER
with one side of the lid still closed, then jumps to the
alley.
PARKER
Hurry up!
But DREW'S FROZEN WITH FEAR and to complicate matters,
she's struggling to keep the curtain wrapped around
herself.
DREW
I'll, uh, go around.
PARKER
Are you out of your mind?!
It's
only a little ways! JUMP!
Drew's still FROZEN on the fire escape.
DREW
I can't do it!
PARKER
Yes you can!
ANGLE ON THE END OF THE ALLEY
where Roger appears with The Emperor. Surprised
to see
the girls, he backpedals, worried he'll be seen,
but
they're too wrapped up in their own getaway and
he
quietly makes his way to his VAN (painted on the
back and
sides: "Michelangelo's Painting: A Masterpiece
every
time".
DREW
No I can't!
PARKER
Have fun in prison. Under 'Summer
Internships' on your college
application, you can write
'license plate manufacturing.'
(CONTINUED)
46.
CONTINUED:
Roger's VAN SQUEALS AWAY, drawing Parker's attention.
She glimpses him in his side mirror as he disappears
around the corner into traffic.
Shutting her eyes, Drew drops onto the closed lid of the
dumpster.
DREW
(astonished)
I did it.
Oops, the curtain starts to slip. When she reaches for
it she loses her balance and suddenly -- FWONK --
nosedives into the dumpster. The curtain floats INTO THE
ALLEY at Parker's feet.
DREW (O.S.)
OW!
PARKER
Get out of there!
DREW (O.S.)
(beat)
Give me... my... curtain.
Parker tosses the curtain in and Drew climbs out.
They
hurry off down the alley.
IN THE SECOND STORY FIRE ESCAPE WINDOW -- Morty appears.
MORTY
Stop!
Bring back that dog!
MORTY'S POV -- The girls near the end of the alley. A
small dog could easily be concealed under that shower
curtain.
ON THE GIRLS -- running full-tilt, Drew turns to Parker.
DREW
He thinks we have the dog!
PARKER
A painter took it!
DREW
A pain --
WHAM! -- Drew's
CLOTHESLINED at the intersection by a
BIKE MESSENGER
who, in a valiant attempt to avoid her,
brakes so hard
he flies off the handlebars and lands
RIGHT ON TOP OF
HER.
(CONTINUED)
47.
CONTINUED:
It's DREAM GUY from the train and for a confused BEAT
they look into each other's familiar faces where we read
recognition, love, unstated chemistry, then:
DREAM GUY
You know, one of us is gonna get
hurt if we keep doing this.
O.S. SIRENS signal that the police are now involved.
PARKER
Hey, complete stranger!
Get off
my sister!
Parker yanks Drew from underneath Dream Guy.
DREW
I'm, uh, late for this place,
thing, where I'm supposed to be.
College. Interview!
DREAM GUY
Where at?
But Parker's got her by the arm and she can only call
back over her shoulder...
DREW
NYU!
... before disappearing into the CROWD on the sidewalk.
DREAM GUY
(too late)
Me, too!
AROUND THE CORNER comes Morty who, without time to react,
trips headfirst over Bike Messenger Guy.
The girls weave through the PEDESTRIANS but spot a COP
CAR SCREECHING to a halt in front of them and quickly
take a left into...
Where to now? Thinking fast, Parker pulls on a door --
locked -- the next door SWINGS OPEN as if by divine
providence and two HIGH FASHION MODELS step past them out
while the girls step inside.
48.
Then, Parker HEAVES THE DOOR WITH ALL HER MIGHT, spinning
it so fast the security guys and cops can't jump in.
The police and security look left, right, across the
street.
BRUCE
Where'd they go?
HOGAN
They couldn't have gone very far.
We'll split up.
(pointing)
You go that way! You take Fifth!
Come on, get on your horse!
Morty and Bruce take the cop's order and race off in
separate directions. Neither Hogan nor his partner
moves.
WILLIAMSON
Coffee?
HOGAN
Sure.
Williamson and Hogan step over to a hot dog cart set up
next to a NEWSPAPER STAND.
WILLIAMSON
(to hot dog vendor)
Two black.
HOGAN
Where do you think those two went?
WILLIAMSON
Beats me. They didn't have any
stupid dog with them from what I
could see.
HOGAN
Might have stashed it.
(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:
WILLIAMSON
Maybe they ate it.
The cops giggle at this.
WILLIAMSON
The rent-a-cop said the mutt's
worth like 50 G's. That makes it
grand theft, my friend. Five to
ten.
ANGLE ON THE NEWS STAND
where a BLIND CASHIER (SPEEDY) smiles at the two
policemen.
HOGAN
(to blind cashier)
Hey, Speedy. You didn't see a
couple of blondes run past here,
did you?
SPEEDY
Yep. Couldn't miss 'em. Real
criminal types. Looked like they
were headed to Mexico.
HOGAN
That's where they all go.
ANOTHER ANGLE
REVEALS Drew and Parker, crouched down behind the counter
right next to Speedy.
WILLIAMSON
See you around.
SPEEDY
Not if I see you first.
The cops head back to The Plaza.
HOGAN
I say we put Abbott and Costello
on the ransom watch. I don't want
to be stuck in the same room all
day with Leona Helmsley's nasty
stepsister.
(CONTINUED)
55.
CONTINUED:
With the Detectives gone, Speedy turns up his nose and
waves the air, fanning away a bad smell.
SPEEDY
Whew. You know, it's not some old
wives' tale about blind people
having an acute sense of smell.
DREW
Sorry.
SPEEDY
So? What did you do with that
dog?
DREW
We didn't steal it, I swear.
PARKER
A painter did.
SPEEDY
You girls best give yourselves up
and tell 'em the story.
DREW
(torn)
He's right, Parker.
PARKER
Of course he's right. We're going
to march in there and give
ourselves up right this minute.
They will, of course, take us down
to the precinct, call Mom and Dad,
we'll give our statement, they'll
grill us under hot lights for a
few hours, force us to confess
with some tricky good cop/bad cop
routine and the next thing you
know we're doing five to ten in
Attica.
Drew checks her watch.
DREW
So we'll turn ourselves in right
after the interview.
SPEEDY
May I make one suggestion?
(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED:
PARKER
Sure.
SPEEDY
Hit the showers before you do
anything else.
A BEEP BEEP indicates Parker's BLACKBERRY is receiving a
message.
DREW
We're facing felony charges,
Parker. Maybe you can do your on-
line flirting later. Better yet,
he can see you during visitor's
hours.
Parker reads the incoming MESSAGE from...
THOREAU 786:
HOW'D CHEM TEST GO?
PARKER
(beat; epiphany)
Oh my God. Warren works in the
city.
DREW
Warren? WARREN?! So you lied,
right to my face. No, Drew, this
isn't about the chat room guy.
Nah!
But Parker's typing furiously even as Drew rants on --
she has to lean around Speedy's legs. A GUY buying a
newspaper peers down at the strange sight.
SPEEDY
(to guy)
Take your daughters to work day.
The guy pays for his paper, leaves.
NOTATWIN: WARREN. MY REAL NAME'S PARKER MACLEOD.
MY
SISTER AND I NEED A FAVOR.
DREW
Are you listening to me?!
Give me
that stupid thing!
Drew reaches for the Blackberry.
(CONTINUED)
57.
CONTINUED:
PARKER
Knock it off, Drew! This guy
might be able to help. He lives
here.
DREW
Parker, you have completely lost
your mind if you can be thinking
about boys at a time like this!
THOREAU 786:
PARKER.
THANKS FOR SHARING.
ANYTHING YOU
NEED.
NOTATWIN: BIT OF A JAM IN THE CITY. MOB, POLICE AND
HOTEL SECURITY ON OUR TAIL. COULD USE A HIDEOUT.
THOREAU 786: LOL!
ADVENTUROUS TYPE.
MEET ME AT WORK?
I'M AT THE U.N.
PARKER
(to Drew)
The United Nations?
DREW
You can't possibly know somebody
who works at the United Nations.
Maybe he meant United Sub
Sandwiches. Or United Skate Rats
Store.
NOTATWIN:
UNITED NATIONS?
THOREAU 786:
JUST A DAY JOB.
JOIN THE 11:00 TOUR.
SOON.
Parker pockets the Blackberry.
PARKER
So. We're going to the United
Nations to use the restroom.
DREW
How convenient. You arrange a
little date while your sister's
future hangs in the balance.
PARKER
Look, he said he'd help and it's
only a couple blocks away. You
got a better idea?
Speedy opens the rear door of the newsstand.
(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED:
SPEEDY
(how's he know?)
Coast's clear.
PARKER
Thank you, Mr. Speedy.
SPEEDY
You're quite welcome.
Good luck
in that interview.
Drew SIGHS, then reluctantly follows Parker out.
CUT TO:
The girls try to be as inconspicuous as possible walking
cross-town in couture, Drew with only one shoe and in a
bad mood.
PARKER
We're going to make it, Drew.
You'll see. There's still plenty
of time. You'll get cleaned up,
we can trade clothes... this is a
nice suit, huh? Right?
DREW
(abrupt)
Yes.
PARKER
You're going to get accepted, then
we can explain the
misunderstanding about the dog to
the police and everything will be
okay.
DREW
Maybe after the police forgive us
for sneaking into someone else's
hotel room, we can ask them to
please keep the mob hit man from
whacking us and dropping us into
the marina so he doesn't get his
suit dirty.
PARKER
First things first.
DREW
Parker, I know you're trying to
cheer me up, but I have to be
honest. This is all your fault.
(CONTINUED)
62.
CONTINUED:
PARKER
(beat)
My fault? MY FAULT?! I didn't
mean for any of this to happen!
DREW
Yeah, right! Like you didn't mean
to ask Bernie Lipscomb to the
prom!
PARKER
What's that supposed to mean?
DREW
I'll bet that was just another
accident of yours that happened to
screw up my life!
PARKER
Bernie Lipscomb?
(dawning)
You...?
Drew didn't want to admit that -- it just slipped out
under pressure.
PARKER
You liked Bernie, too?
DREW
You know I did!
PARKER
No I didn't.
I haven't seen you
talk to a guy since we were in
kindergarten and we thought Jerry
Wester was a girl.
DREW
You asked Bernie just to snake him
from me!
PARKER
I did not!
(beat)
Wow, the really spooky thing is,
that would mean we liked the same
guy.
A block away, the United Nations building stands
majestically against the sky.
(CONTINUED)
63.
CONTINUED:
Directly in front of them, however, a POLICE CAR is
stopped at the light with two uniformed POLICEMEN inside.
The girls spot the Police and stop.
The Police look up at the girls through their windshield.
The Horse Carriage passes the usual groups of PROTESTORS
and TOURISTS outside on the U.N. Plaza and...
... the Girls jump off and move into the crowd, headed
for the ENTRANCE where there's a LINE at the door.
DOWN THE BLOCK the Detectives' unmarked car appears and
parks at the curb.
Williamson and Hogan climb out, scanning the crowd.
WILLIAMSON
(pointing)
There they are.
DETECTIVES' POV
-- just a glimpse as they ENTER the building.
65.
BACK TO SCENE
HOGAN
What in the world could they be
doing here?
Once outside, he YELLS AGAIN.
WARREN
Dingo cashito, BRAD PITT ezukai!
The JAPANESE GIRLS turn around and STORM BACK THROUGH THE
DOORS, blocking Williamson and Hogan's EXIT.
The three of them run for the line of taxis.
PARKER
You speak Japanese?
WARREN
I may not look like an underwear
model, but I'm smarter than a
hundred of them put together.
Warren grabs a Taxi door.
WARREN
Come on!
PARKER
We don't have any money!
WARREN
I'm smart AND rich!
Williamson and Hogan have fought their way out through
the little Japanese Girls.
Realizing they won't reach Parker and Drew in time, they
head for their own unmarked cruiser which is parked just
ahead of...
Bennie's TOWN CAR. He's holding the door for a cigar-
chewing CLIENT but watching the Girls climb into the cab
up ahead.
76.
Tears running, Drew's walking too quickly for the one
stupid shoe. She nearly turns her ankle.
DREW
Darn it!
DARN IT DARN IT DARN IT!
This is when she sees, parked just down the block...
ROGER'S VAN with "Michelangelo's Painting" across the
back door.
DREW
That's... that's the painter.
Drew quickly steps into the shadow of a doorway to keep
out of sight and watch the van.
A BLOCK BEHIND THE TAXI --
Drew watches as Roger climbs out, looks up and down the
street, then moves around to the passenger side, grabs
The Emperor and drops him into a gym bag.
AT THE END OF THE BLOCK -- SPECTATORS for the New York
Kennel Club Dog Show have begun filing into the Garden.
Ever wary, Roger carries The Emperor under one arm. The
Emperor pokes his nose out. Roger pushes it back in.
The dog pokes it back out.
ROGER
(to Emperor)
Knock it off.
Whoosh! From behind, DREW GRABS THE EMPEROR and takes
off running.
ROGER
Hey!
Give me that dog!
Holding The Emperor at arm's length, Drew makes a run for
it with Roger after her.
ON DREW -- LOOKING RIGHT INTO THE SMILING MAUVE FACE OF
THE EMPEROR.
DREW
I just want you to know that I'm
allergic to you AND cynophobic!
She and Roger race right past...
... Mr. Lo Biancho, holding out the Saks bag of money.
(CONTINUED)
85.
CONTINUED:
MR. LO BIANCHO
Excuse me?
DREW
I can't stop!
I have to return
this dog!
ROGER
I'll be right back!
Puzzled, Mr. Lo Biancho falls in line behind Roger,
keeping up pretty well for an old dude with a gut.
ANGLE ON THE END OF THE BLOCK
WHERE PARKER'S TAXI APPEARS.
The Emperor's having the time of his life. He licks
Drew's face joyfully as she weaves through the growing
crowd.
DREW'S DOG-SLOBBERED POV
REVEALS A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN doing security at the
DELIVERY ENTRANCE to the Garden, where SHOW PARTICIPANTS,
wheeling their DOG KENNELS, are being checked in by two
SHOW OFFICIALS.
BACK TO SCENE
Drew draws a bead on THE POLICEMAN, determined to reach
him and hand over The Emperor:
DREW
Officer?!
Officer?!
But SHOW OFFICIAL #3 appears from inside, taps the
Policeman on the shoulder -- they need him inside.
He
turns and goes through the door just as...
... Drew reaches the loading dock and hustles up the
stairs.
DREW
Officer?!
She sprints past the other SHOW OFFICIALS checking in
CONTESTANTS.
SHOW OFFICIAL #1
Miss! You can't go in without
credentials!
ACTION
CHAOS.
The TWO SHOW OFFICIALS,
sporting nifty sweaters and
manicures, are prepared
to sacrifice their lives to block
the door. In addition
to the PARTICIPANTS trying to get
inside, they're holding
off Roger, Mr. Lo Biancho,
Williamson and Hogan.
SHOW OFFICIAL #1
(quite disturbed)
No entry without official
credentials!
MR. LO BIANCHO
I'm Emile Lo Biancho! I demand to
be let in!
WILLIAMSON
NYPD!
Move aside!
At the mention of POLICE, Roger's EYES GO WIDE. He
slinks down, losing himself in the crowd and sidles off.
SHOW OFFICIAL #1
(chin set)
I'll have to see identification,
officers.
(to Mr. Lo Biancho)
I'm so sorry, Mr. Lo Biancho. Go
right in.
AT THE CORNER, Parker and Warren keep their distance, not
wanting to be seen by the Detectives.
WARREN
You think she made it?
PARKER
She's faster than she looks.
CUT TO:
88.
CONTINUOUS ACTION
THEY CATCH UP TO HER IN A SWARM, KNOCKING HER ONTO THE
SIDEWALK OUTSIDE WHERE SHE DISAPPEARS UNDERNEATH A
MOUNTAIN OF DOGS!
Williamson, Hogan, Morty, Bruce, Mr. and Mrs. Lo Biancho
and quite a few SPECTATORS pour out the doors.
89.
ANGLE DOWN ON DREW
STILL HUGGING THE EMPEROR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACK, ALL
OF WHOM GLEEFULLY LICK HER FACE!
DREW
Please!
I'll get hives!
(resigned)
Oh, go ahead.
DREW'S POV
The Detectives appear above her.
BACK TO SCENE
She holds up The Emperor.
DREW
I, uh, just wanted to return him.
As the other OWNERS and HANDLERS gather their dogs,
Williamson hands The Emperor off to Mrs. Lo Biancho while
Hogan handcuffs Drew.
MRS. LO BIANCHO
Flog her! Step aside and I'll
whip her myself!
MR. LO BIANCHO
(dead calm)
Didn't you say it was a man who
called, Dear?
MRS. LO BIANCHO
So she had an accomplice! We'll
beat the information out of the
little wench!
(handing him
The Emperor)
Get him cleaned up, Emile.
Williamson and Hogan move Drew toward their car.
DREW
I didn't take her dog, I swear.
WILLIAMSON
We'll sort it out.
(CONTINUED)
90.
CONTINUED:
DREW
But I have this interview. I
mean, it's not really an
interview. I'd never lie to the
police...
(it's over)
... never mind.
Just as they push her head down into the car, she
glimpses a vaguely familiar face among the myriad GAWKERS
-- it's the Bike Messenger. For just an instant they
lock eyes before the car pulls away.
DOWN THE STREET
Parker and Warren round the corner at a run, only in time
to watch the Detective's car leave with Drew in the back
window.
WARREN
What now?
PARKER
We have to go to the jail and tell
them what happened.
WARREN
What on earth did happen?
PARKER
Poor Drew. She wanted to get into
that program more than anything in
the world.
With a SIGH, they turn to go and BUMP -- knock into
Bennie, who's staring coldly down at Parker.
BENNIE
You goin' somewhere?
She's paralyzed with fear.
WARREN
(gulp)
Hello, sir.
PARKER
Oh my God!
Please don't kill me!
WARREN
Kill?
(CONTINUED)
91.
CONTINUED:
PARKER
We don't know anything at all! We
didn't see anything or hear
anything and I'll swear to that in
a court of law!
Bennie appears unmoved. Parker closes her eyes, trying
to meet death with dignity.
PARKER
Just not in the face.
BENNIE
What's the big idea? You two a
couple a nutbags or somethin'?
She opens one eye.
PARKER
Nut bags? No. I mean,
yes. Is
there a right answer to
that?
See, my sister had this
interview
which turned out not to
be an
interview, really and I
sort of
messed things up because
I wanted
to meet him.
Indicating Warren.
WARREN
Really?
You came into town just
for me?
Wow.
PARKER
Not now, Warren.
(back to Bennie)
Drew was going to be late even
though technically she wasn't
going to be late since there
wasn't an interview and that's
when we got in your car. I
promise we meant to pay. It was a
true emergency.
BENNIE
I meant, why you runnin' when I'm
trying to give you your bag back?
Bennie hands Parker Drew's daybag.
Parker takes it,
still trying to comprehend.
PARKER
You were just...?
(CONTINUED)
92.
CONTINUED:
BENNIE
I found your mom's number in the
book. She said you needed it
pretty badly for that big
interview. Listen, I gotta go.
It's my mother-in-law's birthday
and I gotta plant some stupid rose
bush and then take her out to
dinner at the Pier. See ya
around.
Bennie waddles over to his Town Car and climbs in.
PARKER
(beat; calling after)
Thank you?
WARREN
Well, he certainly is a good
Samaritan.
Parker looks at the daybag.
WARREN
You guys lead a pretty interesting
life, don't you?
But now Parker's mind is elsewhere.
She pulls out Drew's
daybook, opens it.
WARREN
We going to the jail, or what?
I've never been to a jail before.
PARKER
What time is it?
CUT TO:
Warren and Parker leap from a cab and hustle across
campus. In only a few strides, Parker's dusting him.
PARKER
Try to keep up, Warren!
WARREN
(calling after her)
Hey! I'm an intellectual! I
never claimed to be athletic!
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
94.
CONTINUED:
WARREN
(CONT'D)
As a matter of fact,
I was excused
from P.E. because of
an ascended
testicle!
(realizing)
Too much information,
right?
CUT TO:
Jim catches up to her.
DREW
Thanks for getting me out of jail
but I have to go home now because
my entire life is ruined.
(CONTINUED)
96.
CONTINUED:
JIM
Bad day, huh?
DREW
You turn understatement into an
art.
JIM
Can you just tell me your name?
Please?
DREW
(sigh)
I'm Drew MacLeod. The girl who
won't be going to the NYU
Accelerated Program.
JIM
Why not?
Drew looks at her watch.
DREW
Because short of flying, there's
no way to get from here to NYU in
five minutes.
JIM
Sure there is.
CUT TO:
Parker's on the stairs with Drew's DAYBOOK open, staring
into it like someone who has a final exam in two minutes
but forgot to show up for the semester.
Warren's looking over her shoulder.
WARREN
Wow.
And I thought I was anal.
PARKER
This is no good. I don't do too
well with the whole rehearsal
thing. I'm more of a 'wing it'
person.
Parker checks herself in her reflection in the glass.
Working herself into Drew form, she puts her hair into a
conservative bun and then tries straightening her posture.
(CONTINUED)
97.
CONTINUED:
PARKER
(all business)
How's this look? Drewish?
WARREN
You know, I've always had a thing
for librarians.
PARKER
Warren, honesty is fine. But you
could edit a little, you know?
WARREN
Got it.
PARKER
Wish me luck.
WARREN
Good luck, Drew.
CUT TO:
STUDENTS leisurely make their way between classes.
JIM (O.S.)
Yo!
Coming through!
(CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED:
The Students dive out of the way as Jim comes barreling
across campus with Drew clinging for life to his
handlebars.
Just outside the Administration Building, Jim hits the
brakes and Drew FLIES OFF THE HANDLEBARS and like the
puppy in the opening, disappears into a shrub.
JIM
You okay?
The old Drew is back.
She scrambles out of the
shrub...
DREW
Fine.
... and up the stairs -- then stops, turns.
DREW
Wait right there.
(beat)
I mean, I don't want to be bossy.
You don't have to stay right
there, if you don't want to.
JIM
I'll be right here.
DREW
Great.
She launches herself into the building.
Warren and Jim sit waiting when the Girls come out,
smiling.
Drew turns to Parker.
DREW
Thanks.
The sisters hug, but we GO...
(CONTINUED)
105.
CONTINUED:
CLOSE ON PARKER -- EYES WIDE.
PARKER
Sis?
DREW
Yeah?
PARKER
Gotta go.
Parker grabs Warren by the hand and blasts around the
corner just as...
Charley MacLeod pulls up in his truck and parks half on,
half off the curb.
He leans over, waving to Drew.
CHARLEY
Hi, baby!
Drew goes over to the truck.
CHARLEY
I was in the city. I tried to
call you. Thought you might want
a ride home.
DREW
Sure.
CHARLEY
(what?)
Is that a new outfit?
DREW
Yeah.
Hey, one minute, 'kay?
CHARLEY
Sure.
Drew goes back to Jim.
DREW
Thanks.
JIM
You're welcome.
DREW
I, uh...
(CONTINUED)
106.
CONTINUED:
JIM
You want to maybe... get together?
DREW
First I want to take a shower.
For about a week.
Drew leans over and kisses him on the cheek.
Then she
reaches into her bag and pulls out a card.
DREW
Call me, okay?
JIM
You have a card? Aren't you in
high school?
She smiles, shrugs and climbs in her dad's truck. They
pull away, leaving Jim waving. When they're out of
sight, Parker and Warren come back around the corner of
the building.
PARKER
Oh, man. I'm doomed.
I'll never
get home before them.
WARREN
Sure you will.
Warren pulls out a CELL PHONE, hits speed dial.
WARREN
Dad?
Hey.
I need a favor.
