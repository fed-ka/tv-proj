      INT. 28TH FLOOR - DIANE S OFFICE - DAYA1A1

      Diane and Will in the conference room.  Arguing.  No sound.  
      Seen through glass.

                                  BREE
                    It s nothing.

                                  CARY
                    What do you mean  it s nothing -- 
                    look at them.  

      Watching are Cary, Alicia, two other associates, and BREE, 
      waiting for a meeting with Diane, trial transcripts open in 
      their laps.    

                                  BREE
                      I amlooking at them.  It s a 
                    financial meeting.  That s how they 
                    look in financial meetings.

      Alicia eyes the partners scratching off something in binders.  

                                  CARY
                    No, that show they look when they re 
                    cutting jobs.  Come on, law firms 
                    aren t recession-proof the way they 
                    used to be. 

                                  BREE
                    Would you stop scaring yourself?  
                    They said billable hours are up 
                    this year.  They said we re fine.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY11

    And we re inside the room now with Will and Diane... 

                                  DIANE
                    And tax litigation?  We have six 
                    full-time.  

                                  WILL
                    Cut four.  Hold on to two.

                                  DIANE
                    Which four?  Bayer?

                                  WILL
                          (reluctant)
                    Bayer s wife s pregnant.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    2.
      CONTINUED:11


                                  DIANE
                          (but...)
                    He doesn t have seniority.

                                  WILL
                          (grimaces)
                    See if he ll do part-time.

      Diane nods, looks out, sees Cary, Lori, and Alicia peering 
    in.  They quickly look away.  Diane considers it.

                                  DIANE
                    And the Junior Associates?  

      Will looks up, follows her gaze.     

                                  WILL
                    Put a pin in that.

                                  DIANE
                    We don t have a lot of pins left.

                                  WILL
                    Diane. 

      Right.  She nods: okay.  His cellphone rings.  He looks 
      toward the caller I.D.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Well, better late than never.

                                  DIANE
                    Stern?

                                  WILL
                          (nods)
                    The great man decides to make an 
                      appearance...
                          (answers)
                    Jonas?  How are you?  We have some 
                    names to run by you for layoffs.
                          (hardto hear)
                    Where are you?  It sounds loud.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - DIANE S OFFICE - DAY22

    The conference room door opens, and Bree, Alicia, and Cary 
      look up, see Diane and Will exiting, neither partner smiling.

                                  WILL
                    Hey, Alicia, do you have a second?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    3.
      CONTINUED:22


      Uh-oh.  Cary and Bree look toward her.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Sure.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - WILL S OFFICE - DAY33

      Will and Alicia in his office.  Alicia glances out the door, 
      sees Cary shooting a look in at her.  Is she getting fired?

                                  WILL
                    How are you doing?

                                  ALICIA
                    Good.

                                  WILL
                          (smiles)
                    It s nothing like law school, is it? 

                                  ALICIA
                          (smiles nervously)
                    It s better.  I always felt unsure 
                    in law school.

                                  WILL
                    Really?  You could ve fooled me.

                                  ALICIA
                    I did fool you.

      Smiles.  Alicia bracing herself: let s get to it.  

                                  WILL
                    So I have a favor to ask.  
                    Actually, Mr. Stern has a favor to 
                    ask-- you ve never met Mr. Stern?

                                  ALICIA
                          (relieved)
                    No, he s been away.

                                  WILL
                          (a sore point)
                    Right.  Bali and the Barrier Reef.  
                    Anyway, he has a daughter-- Anna-- 
                    from his first marriage.  She s 
                    being sued-- I don t know the 
                    details-- I m sure they re ugly.  
                    Last time we got her out of a drug 
                      possession.

                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    4.

                                  WILL (CONT'D)
                    Before that it was a car driven 
                    through a department store window.  
                    Anyway-- You don t need to take 
                    notes on this.  

      Okay.  Alicia stops.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Her new husband hired a lawyer from 
                    some no-name firm, and Mr. Stern 
                    wants someone from our firm to co-
                    counsel with him.

                                  ALICIA
                    With this other lawyer?

                                  WILL
                    Yes, make sure he doesn t screw up.  
                    Second chair him.  She s meeting 
                    with this lawyer in an hour.  So 
                    take Kalinda and get the lay of the 
                    land, okay?

      Alicia nods, starts toward the door when Will stops her...

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Alicia.  We re going through a lot 
                    of changes here, and... there are 
                    only three votes that really matter: 
                    mine, Diane, and Mr. Stern s.  This 
                    is a good way to impress Mr. Stern.     

      Alicia stares at him.  A lot of meaning there.

                                  ALICIA
                    Thanks.  

    And she leaves, considering that, as Will watches her go.

      Wynton Ridge.  Jewish Orthodox neighborhood.  Men in prayer 
      shawls, beards.  Elegant Orthodox women pushing baby 
      carriages.  Store signs: Hebrew mixed with English.  (No

                                  KALINDA
                    Stern s daughter lives here?

                    near here--

                                  ANNA
                    Excuse me?  Are you looking for me?

      They turn to find a confident and sunny Orthodox housewife, 
      returning to her house with groceries.  ANNA LOEB, (27), 
      elegantly though conservatively dressed, worldly.  

                                  ALICIA
                    No, we re actually... Are you...?

                    Anna.  Jonas Stern s daughter.  

    It takes them a second, actually more than a second to absorb 
      this.   Alicia and Kalinda stare at the Orthodox woman.  

                                  ALICIA
                    I m sorry, I...

                    Don t worry, I get that a lot from 
                    dad s friends.  This is me now.  Hi.

                                  KALINDA
                    ...Hi.

      INT. LOEBS  HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY55

      Alicia and Kalinda watch Anna open cans with an electric can 
      opener, set them on the counter.  The house seems to be about 
      music.  Jazz.  A synthesizer in the corner.

                                  ANNA
                    I was in rehab out in Westchester, 
                    and there was this volunteer there.  
                    A yeshiva student.   

                                  KALINDA
                    Those hot-blooded yeshivas.

      Alicia shoots a look toward Kalinda, but Anna laughs.

                                  ANNA
                    Yes, I surprised myself.

                                  ANNA (CONT D)
                    Isaac was talking about passion and 
                    music and-- the Torah, and I just-- 
                    I fell in love.  That s the problem 
                    with love: you can t just make it 
                    do what you want.

      Alicia smiles, liking her, as Anna nods toward the canning:

                                  ANNA (CONT D)
                    Sorry, I can t do this during the 
                    Sabbath.  It s work.  

    Ah, Alicia and Kalinda nod.

      INT. LOEBS  HOUSE - VARIOUS ROOMS - DAYA6A6

                                  KALINDA
                    So what happened?

      Anna sets timers on all the lights, Alicia and Kalinda 
      following her through the house...

                                  ANNA
                    Well, a lady tripped in front of our 
                    house, and she s suing us.  We have 
                      homeowner s insurance, but it only 
                    covers the $20,000 in compensatory 
                    damages, not the punitive.  

                                  ALICIA
                    How much is the punitive?   

                                  ANNA
                    1.2 million.

      Alicia and Kalinda trade a look, startled:

                                  ALICIA
                    She s suing you for 1.2 million 
                    dollars?

                                  ANNA
                    Yes.  It ll take everything.  Our 
                    house.  Our... savings.  Just when 
                    you think you find your place in 
                    life, here comes this. 

      Alicia nods: understands completely.  Kalinda shoots a look 
      toward her.  Bonding again-- at the drop of a hat.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    7.

                                  ISAAC
                    We won t take it.  We re not in 
                    touch with him.

      ISAAC LOEB (29) enters the room.  A bearded Orthodox man.  
      Committed, but not unkind.  There s a softness to his face.  
    An artist s face.   

      EXT. WYNTON RIDGE - DEVON AVENUE - DAY66

      Alicia and Kalinda wait on the doorstep looking in at Isaac 
    and Anna talking, discussing.  Mostly Isaac talking.

                                  ALICIA
                    Wow.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Yeah.  A year ago she was club-
                    hopping with Tara Reid.  You know 
                    what she ll be doing in another 
                    year?  Club-hopping with Tara Reid.

      Alicia smiles at Kalinda s cynicism:

                                  ALICIA
                    Have you ever been surprised by 
                    anyone?

                                  KALINDA
                    Nope.

                                  ALICIA
                    Even me?

                                  KALINDA
                    Especially by you.  

      Alicia laughs as Isaac approaches.  Closes the door.

                                  ISAAC
                    Sorry, I know Anna probably told 
                    you: we ve already hired a lawyer.  
                    He did work for my brother on a 
                    foreclosure, and he s very good.  
                    But thank you.

                                  ALICIA
                    Isaac, could you just tell us what 
                    happened?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    8.

                                  ALICIA
                    Am I-- Is that important?

                                  ISAAC
                    To understand what happened, yes.

                                  KALINDA
                    It s important to be Jewish to 
                    understand a slip-and-fall?

                                  ISAAC
                    Yes, I m sorry you came all this way,

                    You re...?

      Alicia exhales, nods.  Here we go again.  But Isaac takes a 
      second, thrilled.  

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    Your husband was a great man, Mrs. 
                    Florrick.  A very great man.

      Alicia pauses, surprised as Kalinda shoots her a smile.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    The hate crimes on 58th, he put the 
                    skinheads away for life.  He took us 
                    seriously.  How s he doing?

                                  ALICIA
                    He s... in prison.

                                  ISAAC
                    Yes, I m sorry.  A righteous man 
                    quickly finds the world aligned 
                    against him.

      Kalinda clears her throat: yep,  righteous.

                    you just show us what happened, 
                    since we came all this way?   

      Isaac considers it, considers her.  The mood completely 
      changed now.  And... 

      EXT. WYNTON RIDGE - DEVON AVENUE - TEN MINUTES LATER - DAY77

      ...click-- a photo of a wire fifteen feet overhead.  Thinner 
      than a telephone wire, it seems to serve no purpose.  Click-- 
      another shot of the same wire connected to a thin pole.  Click-- 
    the wire runs from pole to pole down the street.

                    It s an eruv wire.

      Kalinda takes pictures as Alicia walks with Isaac and Anna:

                    A what?

                    You know the Sabbath is a holy day

                    like carrying a baby or groceries, 
                    in a community s courtyard.

                                  ANNA
                    But there are no courtyards these 
                    days so the eruv wire--
                          (points to the wire)
                    --creates a symbolic courtyard.  For

                     Willful and wanton conduct. 

      Alicia turns, sees a man leaning against the stoop.  RYAN 
      ALPRIN (33).  Not orthodox.  Handsome but quirky, wildly 
      unpredictable, wildly unlawyer-like, and wildly... well& wild.  

                                  ISAAC
                    Mr. Alprin, there you are.  This is 
                    the other lawyer Anna mentioned.

                                  ALICIA
                    We were just discussing the suit.  
                    We think our firm could offer you 
                    some... assistance.

                                  RYAN
                    Odd, I didn t know I needed some... 
                      assistance.

      Ryan turns to Isaac.  A second.  Alicia looks between them.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Mr. and Mrs. Loeb, why don t you 
                    give us a moment to talk.  

                                  ISAAC
                    Yes, please.  Ryan, if you could 
                    make this work, we would prefer 
                    that.  And, Mrs. Florrick, next 
                    time you see your husband, please 
                    tell him how much he is 
                    appreciated. 

      Ryan turns to Alicia at the name, studies her.  Of course, 
      that Florrick.  Isaac and Anna start back toward the house as 
      Alicia and Ryan wait.  All smiles.  Then... the client s gone.

                    So, I do the depositions, the pre-
                    trial motions, prep for next week s 
                    trial, and here comes the 600 pound 
                    gorilla.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yep, that s me, 600 pounds.  
                    Stocking feet.

                    Have you read the brief?

                                  ALICIA
                    Nope.

                                  RYAN
                    Talked to the plaintiff?

                                  ALICIA
                    Nope.  Came on this...
                          (checks her watch)
                    ...two hours ago.  Our firm is doing 
                    this as a favor to Mrs. Loeb.  Why 
                    willful and wanton conduct?

    But Ryan starts off.  Alicia shoots Kalinda an  I ll handle 
      this  look, follows...

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Look, I was put on this case.  It s 
                    not my choice.  And I really don t 
                    care if it s your choice.  So call 
                    it 600 pound gorilla or whatever 
                    you want, but I m now your second 
                    chair. 

      Ryan looks over at her.  Shrugs.

                                  RYAN
                    They saw the eruv wire was down; 
                    they knew it could trip somebody 
                    up; and they didn t try to repair 
                    it.  That s why it s willful and 
                    wanton conduct, and subject to high 
                    punitive damages.

                                  ALICIA
                    They admitted that?

                                  RYAN
                    In their depositions.  

                                  ALICIA
                    And-- Why did they admit that?  

      Ryan stops by his motorcycle, puts on his helmet.

                                  RYAN
                    The wire fell on the Sabbath.  They 
                    couldn tdo anything.

                    Wow.

                                  RYAN
                    It s a perfect legal trap.  It 
                    fulfills the demands of civil 
                    liability because their religion 
                    wouldn t let them act.  

                                  ALICIA
                    And your defense?

                                  RYAN
                    My defense is to suggest you go tell 
                    your boss you re meeting regularly 
                    with me, and I m doing a great job.  
                    And let me win this case.

      Ryan revs his engine, and Alicia yells over it:

                                  ALICIA
                    It s not going to happen, Mr. 
                    Alprin.  We re in this together.

    But Ryan races off, and Alicia watches him go.

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYA9A9

      A woman in a deposition.  DAWN DECATO (28).  The trip-and-
      fall victim.  Pretty, sweet, athletic.  Answering honestly:

                                  DAWN
                    I would ve reached out, but-- I had 
                    my groceries in my arms-- and I-- I 
                    hit my head on the curb.  Here.

    The right side of her head.  The depo video plays on a 
      conference room monitor, watched by Alicia.  A worried 
      Alicia.  This woman seems genuine.  She hears an off-screen 
      Ryan, questioning.  A little harsh:

                                  RYAN (O.S.)
                    And this grocery store was a half-
                    mile from your home, Miss. Decato. 
                    Why did you pass up five closer 
                    grocery stores to go to this one?  

                                  DAWN
                    My daughter needs gluten-free food.  
                    The kosher grocery store has more 
                    options.

                                  KALINDA
                    Good answer.

      Kalinda entering behind her.  Alicia nods:

                                  ALICIA
                    Great answer.  Anything to undercut 
                    her injury testimony?  

                                  KALINDA
                    Still checking.  Far as I can tell 
                    nobody witnessed her fall, but I m 
                    checking with first responders.  
                    Any word from your... co-counsel?

                                  ALICIA
                    Nope.  Our friend Mr. Alprin 
                    doesn t seem to pick up his phones.  
                    I m heading there now.

      They eye Dawn.  In tears now.  Describing her injuries.

                    And you re dealing with... sympathy 
                    issues.

                                  ALICIA
                    Is that a euphemism for something?

                                  KALINDA

      Alicia considers it.  

                                  ALICIA
                    We can handle that in voir dire.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Yeah, not sure what those questions 
                    look like.   Do you dislike Jews? 

                                  ALICIA
                    Well, you re a bundle of fun today.

                          (smiles)
                    Least you have a co-counsel you trust.  

      Alicia laughs, hears a slam outside.  A male employee 
      slamming his chair down.  They both look.

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    Lay-offs.  They re  slimming down  
                    tax litigation.

      Alicia watches the employee sit at his desk, look down.

      ... Siren Escorts.   A middle-brow porn and escort site.  *
      Trying to suggest Gold Card classiness.  Zach scrolls down *

       Katarina.   *

    He grabs one of the episode 101 photos.  The best view of the *

      Ryan opening his door.

                    Hello, Mr. Alprin, we-- 

    But Ryan turns inside, lets the door swing closed, but Alicia 
      catches it, enters.

      INT. RYAN S LAW OFFICE - DAY1010

    She looks around.  One room.  Desk.  Computer.  Chairs.  It s 
    not sad or squalid, just bare bones.  She approaches Ryan 
      talking with ANOTHER PROSTITUTE.

                                  RYAN
                    I asked for a continuance until 
                    Monday morning because vice cops 
                    like to sleep in, so don t fail to 
                    show up in court, okay?  If you 
                    don t show up, you ll have to take 
                    a plea.

    She nods, gets up, starts out as Ryan looks up, sees Alicia 
      approaching.  His phone rings.  Answering:

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Alprin and Associates.  

      Alicia sits at his desk.  Opens her binder, pulls out 
      transcripts.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    I thought you were taking away his

                    Okay, tell me when we can talk.  
                    I ll just sit here.  

      Ryan stops, looks up at her...

                    So, Mrs. Florrick... Mrs. Peter

                                  RYAN
                    I liked your husband.  He was

                                    ALICIA
                    So here s your problem.  You ve got 
                    a client who admitted to liability, 
                    and a sympathetic plaintiff.  

                                  RYAN
                    You saw the depositions?

                                  ALICIA
                    Got them from the plaintiff s 
                    attorney.  You wouldn t answer your 
                    phone.  The only play I see is you 
                    attack the medical evidence, try to 
                    reduce the punitive amount. 

      Ryan smiles, leans back in his chair.

                                  RYAN
                    What do you think of the First

                    You want to use the First Amendment

                    if they acted, so they couldn t act.

                                  ALICIA
                    And OSHA vs. Smith?  

                                  RYAN
                    OSHA vs. Smithcan kiss my ass.  
                    Liability is outweighed by the 
                      Loebs right to exercise their 
                    religion.

                                  ALICIA
                    Up to what point?  If they saw 
                    someone dying outside--

                    And in the case of anticipated 
                    injury?  

                                  RYAN
                    It s not a knowable consequence.  
                    Seeing a wire down isn t inevitably 
                    going to lead to someone tripping.

                    Well, yes, when that happens, I ll 
                    call on you, Mrs. Florrick. 

                                  ALICIA
                    But you re creating a loophole in 
                    liability law--

                                  RYAN
                    It gets more honest answers.  
                    Judges in civil courts crave two 
                    things: novelty and getting out of 
                    civil court.  The First Amendment 
                    is novel.

      Alicia takes a second here.  Interesting.

                                  ALICIA
                    We ll need to get a First Amendment

      Ryan stares at her, pushes print, goes to his printer to 
      collect the paper...  

                                  RYAN
                    Two years ago, I had a case of lead 
                    poisoning in toys.  Benny Brauer.  
                    Eight months old.  Fell into a coma 
                    after sucking on a crib mobile.  The 
                    insurance company offered to settle 
                    until your firm got involved.

                                  ALICIA
                    Excuse my naivete, isn t that the 
                    point of representing clients: to 
                    help them win?   

                                  RYAN
                    Meet me in open court, I ll beat you 
                    every time.  That s not what your 
                    firm did.  You buried us in paper, 
                      continuances, trial motions waiting 
                    for Benny Brauer to die.  I was 
                    there at the hospital.  You don t 
                    want to see an eight month old die 
                    of lead poisoning.  A week later, I 
                    heard your chief litigator had a 
                    name for it...  Litigating the 
                    margins.   Delaying the reward to 
                    exhaust the opposition and therefore 
                    reduce the payout.

      Alicia stares at him...

                                  ALICIA
                    We do pro bonos.  We do death row

                                  RYAN
                    Sure you can.  Especially when one 
                    of your partners was the chief 
                    litigator.  Will Gardner.  The fish 
                    stinks from the head.

      Will Gardner.  He sits in the conference room, with Diane.  
      Alicia eyes him when he looks up, nods.  Gets up, exits, 
      walks with her toward the stairs:

                                  WILL
                    So, hey, Stern phoned for an update 
                    on his daughter s case.  And he 
                    sent you something.

                    Well, whoever we put on the case.

      Will reaches into his office, takes out a coconut with a 
      monkey painted on it.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    He s in Bora-Bora.

                    So how s it going?

                    Well, interesting is good.  

    An assistant hands Will some phone messages.  As he sorts 
      through them:

                    In fact, he was saying some things.

                    Yeah, what?

    But Alicia thinks about it.  Bad idea to ask.

                                  ALICIA
                    I-- Nothing.  Another time.

      Will watches her oddly as she continues off.  Cary takes a 
      second, falls in beside her:

      Zach goes to the wallet, pauses.  Looks toward the dining *
      room.  Alicia out of sight.  He quietly clicks it open, *
      reaches in.  A row of pretty credit cards.  Like candy.  *

      Zach pauses only a second before taking one.*

                                  EZRA
                    Shoymer is a purely volunteer 
                    policing force for the Hasidim.  
                    Mostly we deal with hate crimes. 

      Kalinda, with Nikon, walks with EZRA, an Orthodox college 
      student in his 20s.  Modern, a street accent.  Mutual 
      respect.  Pragmatist to pragmatist.

                                  EZRA (CONT D)
                    We don t carry guns; we have no 
                    power to arrest.  We carry walkie-
                    talkies and badges, that s it.  

                                  KALINDA
                    And you were the first responders 
                    on the scene?  

                                  EZRA
                    Yeah, right here.  Lady was on her 
                    back, screaming.  Really in pain.   

                                  KALINDA
                    On her back?  She fell forward.

                                  EZRA
                    Yeah, she rolled on her back.  
                    There was a lot of broken glass in 
                    her groceries. 

    Oh, Kalinda nods.  Points toward a surveillance camera on a 
      pole overlooking the scene:

                                  KALINDA
                    That seems to have a direct view.

                                  EZRA
                    It was put in before the lady fell, 
                    but it wasn t hooked up until 
                    after. 

                                  KALINDA
                    Unlucky.

                                  EZRA
                    Yeah.  Just happened that way.  
                    With the hate crimes around here, 
                    we have almost every square yard of 
                    this street covered by cameras.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    24.

      Kalinda nods, zooms her Nikon in on a deli across the street.  
      Pans along the roofline.  Yep.  Another surveillance camera, 
    two actually.

                                  KALINDA
                    Can I ask a favor, Ezra.  Could you 
                    stand here-- where Dawn fell.  

                                  EZRA
                    Sure.

      INT. DELI - DAYA14A14

      Busy.  Customers.  Two men behind the counter.  Kalinda 
      enters, sees a familiar blue-tinted light by the cash 
      register.  Crosses to it, peers over.  Yep.  Two small 
      monitors.   A view of the street, reaching as far as the 
      parked cars across the road, but... no Ezra in frame. 

      Kalinda backs up three feet, peers out, sees-- yep, Ezra 
      still stands there.  He s just not in frame.  Damn.   And--

      INT. CIVIL COURT - DAY1414

    --a burst of angry whispering.  We re in court now: in the 
      middle of an angry sidebar beside the judge s bench.  Four 
      lawyers.  Alicia, Ryan, two plaintiff s lawyers.

                                  JUDGE DUNN
                    Okay, hold up, hold up.

      JUDGE HORACE DUNN (58).  A frustrated intellectual.  
      Professorial.  Feels like he s in the backwaters of the law 
      when he should be swimming the main stream. 

                                  JUDGE DUNN (CONT D)
                    So, Mr. Alprin, let me get this 
                    straight.  You intend to argue a 
                      slip-and-fall as a First Amendment 
                    issue?

                                  RYAN
                    Yes, your honor.

    The plaintiff lawyer interrupts.  AARON ABBOTT (37), tall, 
      stiff, square jawed, Dudley-Do-Right.

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    This is ridiculous, your honor.  
                    They can t even keep a straight 
                    face.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    25.
      CONTINUED:1414


                                  RYAN
                    In Kolatch vs. Harper, 1983, your 
                    honor, it was argued that the 
                    Constitution can t be segregated 
                    from peripheral areas of law. 

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    Kolatch vs. Harper?You can t 
                    just bring up some two-bit case 
                    from 1983 as a citing.

                                  JUDGE DUNN
                    Actually it was a one-bit case.  My 
                    first one as a litigator.

    Oh, Aaron pauses: shit.  As Alicia looks toward Ryan: nice move.

                                  JUDGE DUNN (CONT D)
                    As I remember it, Mr. Alprin, I 
                    lost that case.

                                  RYAN
                    Yes, sir, but it was still a good 
                    argument.

      Judge Dunn chuckles.  Ryan too.  Aaron fuming.  

                                  ALICIA
                          (closing the deal)
                    Your honor, shouldn t the jury be 
                    allowed to decide?

                                  JUDGE DUNN
                    Yes, that s what I argued then.  I 
                    lost that argument.

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    Your honor, this is about liability; 
                    it s not about the constitution--!

                                  JUDGE DUNN
                    Counselor, everything s about the 
                      constitution.  Okay, life rarely 
                    gives you a chance to reverse a 
                    past regret, so what the hell?  
                    Let s let the jury decide.  Step 
                    back, and Mr. Abbott, you may call 
                    your first witness.

      Aaron and his second chair fume as Alicia and Ryan start back 
      toward the defense table, pleased, whispering: 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    26.

                                  ALICIA
                    Just keeping up.     

      They sit beside Isaac, as Alicia turns back to shoot a 
      comforting smile to Anna in the first row.  

                                  ANNA
                    Is everything alright?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.  Actually it is.  

      Anna nods.  Good.

      INT. CIVIL COURT - THIRTY MINUTES LATER - DAY1515

      DWIGHT KNOX (29) is now on the stand.  A General Contractor 
      with a frat boy chumminess.  A bit pleased with himself... 

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    So when you installed the wire a 
                    year ago, you warned the Loebs 
                    about maintenance?

                                  DWIGHT KNOX
                    Yeah, I did.  I always recommend 
                    that I be called once a month to 
                    maintain and inspect.

      Alicia eyes the FOREWOMAN, seeing her look from Dawn at the 
      plaintiff s table to a bearded Isaac.  Distaste on her face.  
      Uh-oh.  

















                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    27.

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    And how often did the Loebs phone 
                    you after you installed it?

                                  DWIGHT KNOX
                    Zero.    

      Alicia winces.  Not good.  As Aaron returns to his seat.

                                  JUDGE DUNN
                    Mr. Alprin?

      Ryan takes a second.  Looks over at Alicia.  She looks at 
      him: what?  Ryan just grins.  Wide.  Um, Alicia isn t sure 
      what that means, but... Ryan is on his feet, starting toward 
    the witness.  Truly  on  when he s cross-examining:

                                  RYAN
                    So, good morning, Mr. Knox.

      Dwight eyes Ryan: something heightened about that.  Hesitant:

                                  DWIGHT KNOX
                    Good morning.

                                  RYAN
                    Every time a customer phones you for 
                    maintenance, you make money, correct?

                                  DWIGHT KNOX
                    That s not why I ask them to.

                                  RYAN
                    Of course not.  Now, you ask 
                    customers to phone you once a month 
                    not because your work is shoddy?

                                  DWIGHT KNOX
                    Oh, no.

                                  RYAN
                    Because that would mean you were 
                    liable in this case too, if your 
                    work was shoddy.

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    Was that a question, your honor?

                                  RYAN
                    It was a preamble to a question 
                    your honor-- just as this is now a 
                      parenthetical to my preamble. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    28.

      Judge Dunn waves his hand: continue, as Alicia leans forward, 
      listens, while behind her, Will slips into court.  Sits.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    When was the last time you were sued 
                    for shoddy workmanship, Mr. Knox?

                                  DWIGHT KNOX
                    I was-- I ve never been sued.

      Ryan sweeps by Alicia who hands him a document...

                                  RYAN
                    And have you ever been served?

      Dwight eyes the document unhappily.  

                                  DWIGHT KNOX
                    I-- I guess I might have.    

                                  RYAN
                    Isn t it true that the plaintiff in 
                    this case tried to sue you--?

                    Mr. Abbott, the question hasn t 
                    been asked yet. 

                                  RYAN
                    Wasn t it only when you agreed to

                    lovely Mr. Abbott over there agreed 
                    to drop the lawsuit against you?
                          (to Aaron)

                    You did shoddy construction in

    And Ryan plops in his seat.  Next to Alicia.  Both staring 
      straight ahead.

      EXT. CIVIL COURT - DAY1717

      Alicia sits with a sandwich outside court.  A beautiful day.   
    She looks up from case notes, sees... 

      ...Isaac and Anna in the shade.  Isaac talking on a cell.  
      Anna behind him, looking off in the other direction.  Almost 
      back to back.  

      Alicia eyes them.  Is that a picture of marriage?  Two people 
    at cross purposes?  No connection?  But Alicia suddenly sees...

      ...Isaac reaching his hand behind him.  And Anna feeling the 
      touch of his hand, places her palm in his.  It s a tiny 
      little glimpse of intimacy.  More passionate than a kiss.  
      Private.  Intended for no one else.  And...



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    30.

      ...Alicia smiles.  Marriages are just mysteries.  Ryan flops 
    on the bench beside Alicia, eating potato chips. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Nice cross.

                    So we re getting intimate now?

                                  ALICIA

    go.  

      INT. CIVIL COURT - DAY1818

      Anna.  Uncomfortable.  Nervous.  On the stand now.  

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    So you can t use any machinery 
                    during the Sabbath?  Because God 
                    would disapprove?

                                  ANNA
                    Yes.

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    So that s why you couldn t use the 
                    phone to call about the eruv wire 
                    being down?  Because that would be 
                    operating machinery?

                                  ANNA
                    Yes.

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    Okay, I think I get it.

      Aaron returns to the plaintiff s table, smiling at Ryan on the 
      way.  Alicia and Ryan trade a look: that s odd.  Whispering:

                                  RYAN
                    What s he got?

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    Mrs. Loeb, this is a record of your 
                    cellphone bill.

      Anna.  She immediately blanches.  Horrified.  Alicia sees 
      this, looks sharply toward Ryan.  Something not good.

                                  AARON ABBOTT (CONT D)
                    If you could look at the underlined

                    you made at 9:33 pm on what day?  
                    Could you read it?

      Anna pauses.  Her lips dry.

                                  ANNA
                    September 4th.

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    And what day was that?  What day of 
                    the week. 

                                  ANNA
                    ...Friday.

    And Anna immediately looks toward Isaac at the defense table 
    who stiffens.  Stunned.  Like a brick thrown at him.

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    So that would be on the Sabbath?  You 
                    made a phone call on the Sabbath?

                                  ANNA
                    I... I m... yes.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    32.

                    And this was a call to?

      Anna looks directly at Isaac, appalled, horrified.  

                                  ANNA
                    To my father.  We d been estranged,

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    And you called at night on your 
                    cell so your husband wouldn t know 
                    about it, is that right?

      Anna takes a long second.  As Alicia looks back and forth 
      between the husband and wife.

                                  ANNA
                    Yes.  I m... sorry.

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    And you did the same on August 7th,  
                    July 17th, and June 19th, is that 
                    correct?  Other Fridays?

      Anna nods as Isaac stands sharply.  Ryan pulls on his sleeve:

                                  RYAN
                    ...sit down...

    But Isaac pulls away, turns, starts out of court.  Judge Dunn 
      watches him leave compassionately.

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    So, Mrs. Loeb, you could ve phoned 
                    about the eruv wire being down, but 
                    you chose not to, thus making you 
                    liable?  
                          (Anna stares, doesn t answer)
                    No further questions.

                                  JUDGE DUNN
                    Why don t we recess until tomorrow.

                    I understand it.  I understand why

                                  ALICIA
                    It s a weakness.

                    Was what happened with your husband

                    Alicia...

      It s Will, leaning out of the conference room-- some quiet 
      confrontation going on inside.  Alicia goes to him... 

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    So this lawyer yesterday you were 
                    working with?  Who is he?

                                  ALICIA
                          (surprised)
                    Ryan Alprin?

                                  WILL
                    Yeah, I saw him in court yesterday; 
                    he s good.

      A quiet burst of words--  I can t believe this -- comes from 
      within the conference room.  Alicia peers in.  A security 
      guard.  A manager trying to offer calming words.  Somebody 
      being laid off.  Will steps out, closes the door. 

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Sorry, this is tough.  He s good, 
                    right?  I like him.  It s like we
                    were right out of a law school.  
                    Hungry.  Is he with some firm?  

                                  ALICIA
                    No.  He s coming here actually for 
                    the settlement conference.  Aren t 
                    we laying people off?

                                  WILL
                    Yeah, but we need new blood.  
                    Litigators who can do the job of 
                    two.  You know?

      Alicia studies Will.  Like he s a stranger. 

                                  ALICIA
                    You met him before.

                                  WILL
                    Who?

                                  ALICIA
                    Ryan Alprin.  On that case 
                    involving lead poisoning in toys.

                                  WILL
                    Oh, the--?  From two years ago?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes, he was on the other side. 

                                  WILL
                    The losing side?
                          (Alicia nods)
                    So, what, he holds a grudge?

                                  ALICIA
                    He thinks we buried him.

                                  WILL
                    I m sure we did.  That s how you 
                    kill shallow pockets.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Litigating for the margins?

                                  WILL
                    Representing your client.  Look, if he s 
                    with a bigger firm, he ll have deeper 
                    pockets.  See if he s interested.

      Alicia studies Will.  Not sure what she thinks.

                                  ALICIA
                    Sure.

    But Alicia sees Ryan in reception sticking his face against 
    the glass, flattening his nose.  

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    I d better go.

    And Alicia starts toward him as Will watches her go.

      Alicia leads Ryan down the stairs.  Night and day from his 
      one-room office...

                    A lot of glass here.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yep, every time we sell a piece of 
                    our soul, we buy glass.

      Ryan smiles, passes Cary who looks up from a secretarial 
      station, eyes Ryan.  Ryan looks back, sees he s being eyed.

                                  RYAN
                    Who s that?

                                  ALICIA
                    My competition.

                                  RYAN
                    Ah.  

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - ALICIA S OFFICE - DAY2323

      They enter Alicia s office, close the door.  Ryan looks around.

                                  RYAN
                    Nice coconut.

    The coconut with the monkey painted on it.

                                  ALICIA
                    Thanks.  

                                  RYAN
                    Can I have it?

                                  ALICIA
                    No.

      Ryan smiles.  Likes she can slap him down like that.  Sits.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - WILL S OFFICE - DAYA24A24

      Will and Kalinda stand in the doorway of his office, Kalinda 
      taking notes.  Lots of movement, people passing.   

                                  WILL
                    Just do your usual thing.

                    out, okay?

                                  KALINDA

      Kalinda looks up...

                                  KALINDA
                    Alicia s lawyer?

                    In case we hire him.  

    Oh, Kalinda nods.  Gets it now.  Turns back to her notes.

                                  KALINDA
                    You want personal stuff too?

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - ALICIA S OFFICE - DAYB24B24

                                  ALICIA
                    What s our fallback position?

      Alicia and Ryan deep in discussion...

                                  RYAN
                    Like you said before: undercut the extent 
                    of injuries, try to reduce the award.    



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    39.

                                  ALICIA
                    We re still vulnerable on punitive.

                                  RYAN
                    The jury liked Anna.  I think they 
                    see it as a human mistake.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yeah, but they hate Isaac.  They ll 
                    want to punish him.  I ve gone over 
                    the numbers.  We can settle for 
                    double compensatory.  

    But Ryan sees the screen saver.  Photos of Alicia and Peter.

                                  RYAN
                    Why didn t you divorce him?

                                  ALICIA
                          (seeing where he s looking)
                    Because I didn t want to.  Double 
                    compensatory handles the victim s 
                    medical, and a bit more.

                                  RYAN
                    That s not an answer.

      Alicia clicks the space bar, makes the screen saver go away.

                                  ALICIA
                    It s the only answer you re getting.

                                  RYAN
                    No one asks you?

                                  ALICIA
                    Ryan.  I m your co-counsel.  I know 
                    you think you ve got this cute 
                    little spontaneous thing going--

                                  RYAN
                    This is my take on it.  You re a rule-
                    follower.  The way you dress, the way 
                    you act.  But there s this part of you 
                    that wants freedom.  Rule-breaking.  
                    Look at who you married.  Look at--

                    Now there s a three foot clearance 
                    between the victim s head and this 
                    view.  A two foot clearance between 
                    her feet and this view.  That is 
                    either the strangest coincidence in

                    But she had to know exactly what the 
                    cameras saw to avoid being taped.  
                    Thisview at the deli was obvious.  
                    The security screen is right behind 
                    the cash register. But these cameras-- 
                    the park cameras-- their screens 
                    aren t on site.  The only way you 
                    could see them was at the security 
                    company, Megalith Security.

                    I see.  We re in Mr. Stern s 
                    office, and you work for Mr. Stern, 
                    but he s not stepping in on this?

      Ryan gets up.  

                                  RYAN
                    Okay. This was fun. See you in court.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - HALLS - DAYAA27AA27

      Alicia escorts Aaron and the other plaintiff attorney back 
      toward the elevator, Ryan bringing up the rear...

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    There s a web site about you.

                                  ALICIA
                    Excuse me?

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    I said there s a web site about 
                    you.   The Women of Scandal. 

      Alicia nods.  The usual hazing.  

                                  ALICIA
                    There s a web site for everything.  

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    They rate you.  I went on line and 
                    voted for you.  The sexiest.  Just 
                    so you know.

      Alicia stares at him.  Yuck.

                                  ALICIA
                    So now I know.  There s the exit.

    The elevator.  Alicia splits off, continues down the hall, 
      feeling that vulnerable scandal feeling again, as Ryan 
      watches her go.  Looks back toward Aaron.  

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - LADIES ROOM - DAYA27A27

      A surgically clean office restroom.  Alicia looks in the 
      mirror.  Studies herself.  Takes a long deep breath.  She 
      exits into...  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    43.



      INT. 28TH FLOOR - RESTROOM HALL - DAY2727

      ...a restroom hall.  The backstage of Stern, Lockhart.  
      Empty, except for Alicia.  She pauses, hears voices around a 
    dog leg in the hall.  Angry voices.

    She looks toward the corner, hears a loud THUD.  Something 
      going on there.  She starts toward the corner, pauses, hears...

                                  AARON ABBOTT (O.S.)
                    Let go of me!  I said--

    And we re around the corner now, in the middle of a burst of 
      violence.  Ryan, his hand grabbing Aaron s suit.  Face into his:

                                  RYAN
                    Don t you ever talk to my co-counsel 
                    that way again.  You understand? 

      Alicia, startled.  Still only hearing it around the corner.  
      Startled and something more.  As she hears:

                                  AARON ABBOTT
                    I ll sue you-- I ll--!

      But-- WHAM--Ryan slams him against the wall.  Then takes out 
      a card, slips it into Aaron s pocket. 

                                  RYAN
                    There.  That s my number.  Phone me.  

      Done, Ryan straightens Aaron s coat, shirt, lets go of him.  
      Aaron backs away, stumbling, rushing, racing around the 
      corner, seeing...  

      ...Alicia standing there, fascinated by all this.  He meets 
    her eye-- only for a second before rushing off.  Gone.  
      Alicia looks up, sees...

      ...Ryan coming around the corner too.  He stops, sees Alicia.  
    She sees him.  A long second.  

    And Ryan starts off.  Leaving the hallway.  Alicia pauses 
      there for a second.  Alone.

      INT. MEGALITH SECURITY - DAY2828

      A row of surveillance sixteen-square screens.  Black and 
      white, color.

                                  HANK
                    I have 63 security link-ups.  
                      Households, businesses, loading 
                    docks, parks.  We DVR everything.  
                    Up to six months.

      HANK (40), a chubby computer.  Too much food from vending 
      machines.  Kalinda follows him through his small security 
      company.  Just three guys in three rooms.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Do all the employees have access to 
                    all the screens?

                                  HANK
                    Well, there are only three of us.  
                    What are you looking for?

                                  KALINDA
                    Just covering my bases.  There was 
                      a surveillance camera put in right 
                    above where this trip-and-fall 
                    happened?

                                  HANK
                    Right.  The community watch 
                    requested it.  But it wasn t linked 
                    up until the next week.  In fact, 
                    we rushed it due to that fall.  
                    There.

      Hank points toward one of the checkerboard images on a 
      monitor.  But Kalinda eyes Hank, not the monitor.

                                  KALINDA
                    Really?  Why rushed?

                                  HANK
                    Well, it s kind of dark there.  

                                  KALINDA
                    So someone goes out there with a 
                      cherry-picker to put the camera up?

                                  HANK
                    That s right.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    45.

                                  KALINDA
                    Who does that?

                                  HANK
                    I do.  This is pretty much a four-
                    man operation.   

      Kalinda eyes him.  Nods.

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY2929

    The xeroxed video screens.  Map of the street.  Video 
      cameras.  Alicia and Ryan sit side by side studying it all. 

                                  ALICIA
                    We ve got phone records.  We ve got

                    reach of the eruv wire days before 
                    it fell.  This could work.

                    Yeah.  You want to do cross?

                    Get him to deny any connection,

                    What do you want?

      them.  A marriage on the rocks.  They re eyed by... 

      ...Alicia.  Frazzled herself.  They both see her.  Nod.  And 
      Isaac moves past as Anna pauses with Alicia.  Tired.

                                  JUDGE DUNN
                    Mr. Alprin, are you ready?

      Ryan smiles.  Prize-fighter mode again.  

                                  RYAN
                    Yes, your honor.

    He starts toward the witness stand.  As Alicia looks back at 
      Anna and Isaac in the gallery.  Two feet between them.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    So you re the owner and operator of 
                    Megalith Security, is that right, sir?

                                  HANK
                    It is.

                                  RYAN 
                    And how do you know the plaintiff?

      Hank looks up.  What?

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Do you want me to repeat the question?

                                  HANK
                    Did you ask  How do I know... her? 

      Hank points toward Dawn, the plaintiff.

                                  RYAN
                    Yes, I did.

                                  HANK
                    I don t know her.

                                  RYAN
                    You re under oath, sir, and you re 
                    swearing you don t know her?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    50.

      Hank pauses.  Trying to decide which way to take this.  He 
      looks toward Dawn, and for the first time we see something 
      else on her face.  She s only had a pained and stoic 
      expression up until now.  Now there s an edge of worry.  

                                  HANK
                    Yes, I am.

      Alicia offers a document to Ryan who smiles cockily at Aaron 
    at the plaintiff s table as he passes...  

                                  RYAN
                    Sir, what s this?

                                  HANK
                          (uh-oh)
                    It s a phone bill.

                                  RYAN
                    Your phone bill, correct? 
                          (he nods)
                    And this number here, do you see 
                    that?  That number belongs to... 
                    the plaintiff.  

      Aaron frowns, looks down toward Dawn.  Shit.  

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    So was that a wrong number, sir?

                                  HANK
                    Probably, I don t know.

                                  RYAN
                    And here on this page.  Did you phone 
                    that wrong number three more times?

      Hank frowns now, angrily staring at Ryan...

                                  HANK
                    I don t know.

                                  RYAN
                    And this call was eight minutes 
                    long.  Is that usually how long you  
                    talk to a wrong number?

                                  HANK
                    I would contest that bill.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    50A.

                                  RYAN
                    And this call of five minutes?  And 
                    this one of 23 minutes?  Would you 
                    contest those too?

                                  HANK
                    I... would.

                                  RYAN
                    Now this surveillance camera you 
                    installed near the eruv wire a week 
                    before the...  accident.   You were 
                    in a cherry-picker bucket, right?  
                    Installing the camera?

                                  HANK

                    the exact place where the eruv wire 
                    attached to the Loeb house?

                                  HANK
                    Well, no, not right there.  

                                  RYAN
                    Five feet away?

                                  HANK
                    I don t know.  I didn t measure it.

                                  RYAN
                    Well, we did.

      Alicia nods, watching Ryan.  He s really good, as...

      ...a note is dropped in front of Alicia by a bailiff.  Alicia 
      opens it, reads:  We need to talk.   Alicia turns, sees 
      Kalinda at the back door.  Alicia frowns, gestures sharply 
      toward the witness stand: Not now.

    But Kalinda points just as sharply toward the door.  Now.  
      Alicia frowns, looks up toward Ryan still questioning. 

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    So you were in a position to weaken 
                    the eruv wire so it could fall, 
                    weren t you?

      Kalinda waits outside the door, pacing, waiting on her 
      cellphone.  Alicia pushes out...

                                  ALICIA
                    Kalinda, I m in trial.  Can t this--

                                  KALINDA
                    No, it can t.  Will was having me 
                    look into your co-counsel.

                                  ALICIA
                    What, why?

                    He was thinking of hiring him.  
                    It s standard operating procedure.

                                  ALICIA

      Just a second later.  A stunned Alicia staring at Kalinda.

                                  ALICIA
                    He s not a lawyer, or you think
                    he s not a lawyer?

      Kalinda rolls her eyes, still waiting on her cell:

                                  KALINDA
                    My friend is checking to see if he 
                    missed anything.  But as far as we 
                    can tell, Ryan Alprin went to law 
                    school, but failed the bar exam, 
                    and never took it a second time.  
                    They can t find his bar association 
                    number.

                                  ALICIA
                    How is that possible?

                                  KALINDA
                    It s possible.  The system is based 
                    on trust more than we think.

      Alicia turns away, mind racing.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.

                                  ALICIA
                    He s up there right now, cross-

                    Yeah, I m still here.

                                  ALICIA
                    He s winning this case--

                    Look, it s not just about this case.  
                    He ll be arrested-- this is a State 
                    crime-- and you could be disbarred 
                    if you don t take this to the judge-- 

                                  ALICIA
                    IfI know he s not a lawyer--

                    Which you ll know in two minutes.

                                  ALICIA
                    Once the jury starts deliberating, 
                    the verdict stands-- even if it s 
                    found out he s not a lawyer.

                                  KALINDA
                    Yes, but...

    She gestures toward her cellphone.  The word is coming.

                                  ALICIA

                    The Loebs need us to win this case.  
                    And I m not gonna let Ryan--

    And with that Alicia has to stop.  Emotion there.  But just 
    for a second.  She can only allow herself a second.

                    Wait, I want to be clear.  

    She looks around.  Nobody nearby.

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    You want me to not be here when I

                    control the placement and view of 
                    your surveillance cameras, and you 
                    phoned the plaintiff three times in

                    yourself in, or I m going to the 
                    judge.

                                  RYAN
                    This is all a mistake.

      Alicia stops, turns to him:

                                  ALICIA
                    Don t.  I mean it.  

                                  RYAN
                    I m sorry.  

                                  ALICIA
                    No, this is not one of those 
                     sorry  things.  Turn yourself in, 
                    or I will.

    And Alicia charges on ahead.  Jaws set to keep in the emotion.

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - BULLPEN - DAYA41A41

      Alicia at the same speed crosses the bullpen floor when Cary 
      catches up with her...

                                  CARY
                    Hey, you know that case you were 
                    talking about, the lead poisoning 
                    one Will was on?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yeah.

                                  CARY
                    Bree was talking about it.  She 
                    said we wanted to settle.  Offered 
                    the families a lot of money too.  
                    But one plaintiff held out for 
                    more, and that brought everything 
                    crashing down.

      Alicia slows down, listening...

                                  CARY (CONT D)
                    Anyway Bree said one of the kids 
                    died, and Will sent the family his 
                    bonus check.  Anonymously.  
                                  (MORE)

        CONTINUED:A41A41
                                  CARY (CONT D)
                    Pretty amazing, huh?  I would never 
                    do that.   Would you? 

      Alicia stares at him now.  And...

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - WILL S OFFICE - DAY4141

        ...knock-knock-- Alicia taps at Will s office.  Will nods.  

                                  WILL
                    Yeah?

                                  ALICIA
                    Just quickly... this lawyer, Ryan, 
                    I think I made a mistake about him.

                                  WILL
                    What do you mean?

      Alicia pauses.  Something a little harder in Will s attitude 
      toward her.  

                                  ALICIA
                    I mean, I don t think he s right 
                    for us.  

                                  WILL
                    Okay.  Got it.  Thanks.

    And that s it.  Um, Alicia stands in the door.  Feeling like... 
    an employee dismissed.  A low level one at that.  She nods, 
      goes.   

      INT. CIVIL COURT - DAY4242

      Alicia sits at the defense table, the chair next to her 
      empty.  Ryan s chair.  She looks toward it.  Sad.  As we stay 
    on Alicia s face, hearing:

                                  JUDGE DUNN
                    And have you reached a verdict?

                                  FOREWOMAN
                    Yes, we have, your honor.

      Alicia looks up, worried.  The same Forewoman who eyed Isaac 
      with such disregard before.

                                  JUDGE DUNN
                    How do you find?

      Alicia closes her eyes, waits.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    58.
      CONTINUED:4242


                                  FOREWOMAN
                    We find for the defense.

    And Alicia opens them, smiles, turns, sees...

      ...Anna and Isaac in the first row.  Pausing, stunned.  
      Didn t expect that.  Isaac looks toward his wife.  Reaches 
    his hand toward...

      ...hers, rests it on top.  She nods, smiling, but eyes wet.  
    And she leans toward him, and hugs him.  Hard.  Close.  He 
      returns it.  Two people trying to make themselves one, as...

      ...Alicia watches, moved.

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY4444*

      Alicia plops her computer bag on the counter, her purse, *
      everything, exhausted.  She sees her cellphone, blinking.  A *
      missed message.  She clicks it on.  Looks up, sees...*

      ...Jackie staring in at her, worried about something or *
      other.  *

                                  RYAN (O.S.)*
                     Hey, it s me.  Sorry I missed the *
                    verdict.  I heard.  Congratulations. *

      Alicia turns away from Jackie, listens to Ryan.*

                                  RYAN (O.S.) (CONT D)*
                     Look, the law s the only thing I m *
                    good at-- the only thing I ve ever *
                    been good at.  But I m going to make *
                    this right.  I made a mistake and *
                    I m going to fix it.  I just, *
                    Alicia, I wanted to say to you-- *

      But-- click-- Alicia clicks it off.  Fuck that.  She puts the *
      cellphone aside, turns to deal with Jackie now.*

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - ZACH S BEDROOM - DAY4545*

      Zach sits on his bed, Algebra book in his lap.  Alicia opens *
    the door, pauses, doesn t know how to start.  *

                                  ALICIA*
                    Who were you on the phone with last *
                    night?  *



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    59.

                                  ZACH*
                    No one.*

                                  ALICIA*
                    Jackie picked up the extension.  *
                    She heard you on the phone with *
                    someone.*

      Zach hesitates.  Hates to lie.  Hates to be caught in a lie.  *
      Alicia closes the door behind her:*

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)*
                    Zach.  Tell me.  *

                                  ZACH*
                    You won t understand.*

                                  ALICIA*
                    I will or I won t, but you re still *
                    gonna tell me.  *

      Zach frowns, not sure how to start.  *

                                  ZACH*
                    I phoned a sex line. I was curious.  *
                    That s all.  I won t do it again.*

      Alicia exhales.  Sits on the bed.  Zach tenses: feels the *
      talk coming.*

                                  ZACH (CONT D)*
                    Mom, please.  I m not going to do *
                    it again.  *

                                  ALICIA*
                    I know.  *
                            (thinksabout it)*
                    I can t stop everything out there *
                    from happening, Zach.  But, in *
                    here, we have to tell each other *
                    the truth.  *

                                  ZACH*
                    That is the truth.  *

      Alicia studies him.  Looks toward the computer. *

                                  ALICIA*
                    You re sure?  There s nothing you *
                    want to tell me?*

      Alicia crosses to the door, looks back at him, exits.  Zach *
      exhales.  Gets up.  Crosses to his drawer.  Pulls it open.  *
      Finds the pictures from 101 there.*
