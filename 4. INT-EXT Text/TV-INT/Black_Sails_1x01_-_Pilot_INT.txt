A DEEP, HORRIBLE GROAN...  Like from some kind of monster...

Silver enters.  And just as he shuts the door behind him--

FLINT (V.O.)
Let me tell you a story about a 
Spaniard named Vazquez...

--we INTERCUT WITH:


Candlelit.  Richard and Gates listen as Flint talks--

FLINT
A few weeks ago, he staggers into a 
Port Royal tavern, and sits next to 
an English Merchant Captain. 
Vazquez, it turns out, is dying. 
Bleeding from a knife wound to the 
belly. 

BACK TO THE WALRUS, where we see QUICK CUTS of Silver 
carefully looking through Flint s things.  Books.  Scientific 
instruments.  AN EASEL, with a half-painted landscape in 
progress.  In toto, a glimpse of a self-improving man.  But 
no Merchant Captain s Log...  Silver is getting frustrated...

FLINT (V.O.) (CONT D)
The knife wound is courtesy of his 
former employer...

But just as Silver is ready to give up, his FOOT CATCHES ON 
SOMETHING.  A FLOORBOARD, raised just slightly at one corner. 

FLINT (V.O.) (CONT D)
La Casa del Contraci n, in Seville.

SMASH BACK TO RICHARD, as his eyebrows go up.

RICHARD GUTHRIE
Colonial intelligence...Untitled Pirate Project - 2ND DRAFT - Steinberg/Levine 9/28/11   36.


FLINT
He was one of their top agents in 
the Americas.  Charged with 
overseeing maritime operations. His 
specific task, for the past two 
years, was the management of a very 
special set of ships, delayed in 
Havana for extensive repairs...

Underneath, Silver finds some papers.  A few books.  Among

the line...

And as Silver reads, and his eyes go wide--

According to Vazquez, total cargo 
is in excess of 7 million dollars.

On Silver.  Shit-eating grin.  But the moment s broken when--

He hears floorboards CREAKING-- The Watchman is coming.  
Startled, Silver ACCIDENTALLY RIPS A PAGE IN THE LOG...
