The woman enters. She rushes over to a table and dumps the 
purse on a chair and starts unraveling herself. We meet 
  LORELAI GILMORE, a very attractive, vibrant, thirty three 
year old woman, though she could easily pass for twenties. 
She sits down and looks around her. sprints across the diner, 
she spots something. Her eyes widen. LUKE DANES, the owner, 
is taking a fresh pot off the coffee machine. Luke is a 
  scruffy though handsome man in his thirties with the body of 
  a fireman under that apron. Lorelai grabs her coffee cup and 
  sprints across the diner to the counter.

                              LORELAI
                          (holding out her coffee cup)
                Please, Luke. Please, please, 
                pleeeeeese?

                              LUKE
                How many cups have you had this 
                morning?

                              LORELAI
                None.

                              LUKE
                Plus...

                              LORELAI
                Five. But yours is better.

                              LUKE
                You have a problem.

                              LORELAI
                          (holding the cup out further)
                Yes, I do.

Luke shakes his head and pours.

                              LUKE
                Junkie.                              LORELAI
                Angel. You're a Goddamn angel.

  Lorelai goes back to her table. She drinks her coffee happily 
for a beat before she realizes that there's a VERY ATTRACTIVE 
MAN in his twenties standing over her.

                              JOEY
                You make that look really good.

                              LORELAI
              It is really good. Best coffee in town.

                              JOEY
                Yeah? I'll have to get a cup.

                              LORELAI
                Good plan.

                              JOEY
                I've never been here before. I'm just 
                passing through on my way to Hartford.

                              LORELAI
                You're a regular Jack Kerouac.

                              JOEY
                          (no idea what she's talking 
                          about)
                Yeah. Hey, you mind if I sit down?

                              LORELAI
                Actually, I'm meeting someone.

He sits down next to her.

                              JOEY
                I'm Joey.

                              LORELAI
                Okay.

                              JOEY
                You don't have a name?

                              LORELAI
                I have a name. But I really am waiting 
                for someone so...

                              JOEY
                So, I should get going.

                              LORELAI
              So soon?                              JOEY
                What?

                              LORELAI
                Just screwing with your mind.
                          (she smiles at him)
                It's been nice meeting you Joey. Enjoy 
                Hartford.

                              JOEY
                Enjoy your coffee, mystery woman.

                              LORELAI
                Oh, I like that.

Joey smiles at her and moves off. The door opens and another 
  bundled up young woman comes in. She makes her way over to 
  Lorelai's table. This is RORY. She looks a bit younger then 
  Lorelai, but is also tall and pretty. Rory's more serious and 
shy then Lorelai, but just as sharp.

                              RORY
                Freezing.

                              LORELAI
                What do you need, hot tea? Coffee?

                              RORY
                Lip gloss.

                              LORELAI
                Here. 

  Lorelai rifles through her purse.

                              LORELAI
                Cocoa, strawberry, vanilla, or toasted 
                marshmallow?

                              RORY
                You've got to go back on sugar.

Rory peers into Lorelai's bag.

                              RORY
                Anything in there not resembling a 
                breakfast cereal?

                              LORELAI
                Boring, but yes.

She pulls out a jumbo size make-up bag.

                              RORY
                God, RuPaul doesn't use that much make-
                up.                              LORELAI
                You're crabby.

                              RORY
                Sorry. I lost my Macy Gray CD and I 
                need caffeine.

                              LORELAI
                Ah, well...
                          (she rifles through the bag 
                          again)
                I have your CD...

                              RORY
                Thief.

                              LORELAI
                          (hands over the CD)
                ...here. And I'll get you some coffee. 

  Lorelai grabs an empty cup and heads to the counter. Rory 
starts looking through Lorelai's make-up bag.

                              LORELAI
                It's not for me. It's for Rory. I 
                swear.

                              LUKE
                You're shameless.

                              LORELAI
                            (pointing)
                Hey, Officer Krupke, look. Over there 
              at that table.

ANGLE ON Lorelai's table where we see that Joey has returned 
and is now chatting up Rory. Lorelai shakes her head in 
  disbelief.

                              LORELAI
                          (to herself)
                He's got quite a pair, this guy.

  Lorelai walks up behind Joey.

                              JOEY
                          (talking to Rory)
                Yeah, I've never been through here 
                before.

                              LORELAI
                Oh, you have too.

Joey whirls around surprised.                              JOEY
                Oh, hi.

                              LORELAI
                You really like my table, don't you?

                              JOEY
                I'm just...

                              LORELAI
                Getting to know my daughter.

                              JOEY
                Your...

He looks at Rory. Rory smiles at him.

                              RORY
                Are you my new daddy?

                              JOEY
                          (to Lorelai)
                Wow, you do not look old enough to have 
                a daughter. I mean it.
                          (to Rory)
                And you do not look like a...daughter.

                              LORELAI
                That's possibly very sweet of you. 
                Thanks.

                              JOEY
                So...daughter, huh?
                          (beat)
                You know I'm traveling with a friend.

                              LORELAI
                She's sixteen.

                              JOEY
                Bye.

                              LORELAI
                Drive safe.

  Lorelai and Rory wave good-bye to the nice man, then look at 
each other and laugh.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
                                END OF TEASER                                      ACT ONE

FADE IN:

  ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MAIN STREET, STARS HOLLOW, CONNECTICUT.

This is a historical old town with white clapboard houses, 
huge trees, rolling hills, and no fences. Everywhere you look 
things are perfectly maintained. The residents obviously love 
this place where hayrides, pumpkin patches, town parades, and 
fourth of July picnics are the way of life.


An oil painting of A VERY SCARY OLD GUY WEARING A POWDERED 
WIG AND KNICKERS fills the screen. We pull out to reveal the 
foyer of the Independence Inn. Behind a beautifully carved 
wood front desk stands JUDY TOLAN. Judy's the young, brand 
new and very unsure desk clerk. She has a handful of keys and 
is putting them in the corresponding slot on the wall. Next 
to her is MICHEL GERARD, the concierge. Michel is a very 
  attractive, extremely intolerant black man in his late 
  thirties. Michel has a beautiful French accent which helps 
with his pursuit of the ladies. Michel is on the phone.

                              MICHEL
                          (into phone)
                No, I'm sorry we are completely booked 
                this week. We have a wedding party 
                here. No, there's really nothing I can 
                do. Yes, I'm sure. Positive. I don't 
                have to look ma'am I...
                              (MORE)                              MICHEL (CONT'D)
                Yes of course I'll look.
                          (he puts the phone down takes a 
                          deep breath and puts it back to 
                          his ear again)
                No, I'm sorry, completely booked...Yes, 
                life is full of disappointments...No, I 
                don't know what the point of living 
                is...Yes, well, at least you're taking 
              it well.

  Lorelai and Mrs. Langworthy walk into the lobby.

                              MRS. LANGWORTHY
                Two of the flower girls are allergic to 
                tuberoses so they can't be in their 
                baskets or they'll die.

                              LORELAI
              No tuberoses. I'll take care of it. 
                Now, you need to go up to your room, 
                relax, unpack, and I'll send a masseuse 
              up to take care of you.

                              MRS. LANGWORTHY
                You're a dear. See if someone tall and 
                Antonio Banderas-like is available.

Mrs. Langworthy goes up the staircase. Lorelai heads over to 
the front desk. Michel is still on the phone. He's 
  desperately trying to keep from killing himself.

                              MICHEL
                Madame, you have no idea how 
                desperately I'd like to help but I'd 
                have to build a room for you myself and 
                I'm not a man who works with his hands 
              so the best I can do is suggest that 
                you please, please try for another 
                weekend. Any weekend...The twenty 
                first? Hold on I'll look.

He looks in the reservation book.

                              MICHEL
                No, I'm sorry we're all booked.

  Lorelai goes behind the desk.

                              LORELAI
                Judy, get the florist on the phone.

                              JUDY
                Okay. Judy stands there looking 
                confused.                              LORELAI
                Ask for Gee. Tell him tuberoses for the 
                Langworthy wedding are out. Substitute 
                the climbing roses he used for us in 
                the dining room arrangement he did last 
                week. Tell him to do one and send it 
                over for approval by four o'clock and 
                why aren't you moving?

                              JUDY
                I don't know where I put his number.

                              LORELAI
                716-6872.

                              JUDY
                716...sorry. Numbers throw me.

  Lorelai writes the number down for Judy.

                              LORELAI
                There. Now, when the arrangement gets 
                here, find me immediately. Has the 
                plumber attended to room four yet?

                              JUDY
                I don't know. I was doing the keys.

                              MICHEL
              He was here, he did nothing, it's a 
                hundred dollars.

  Lorelai dials the phone. Rory enters. She's wearing jeans and 
  a bulky sweater that goes down to her knees.

                              LORELAI
                          (into phone)
                Yes, Marco. Lorelai. Talk to me about 
                room four. What was wrong with it?

She covers the phone, reaches out, grabs Rory's sweater and 
pulls her toward her. Kiss. Rory kisses her. Lorelai goes 
back to the phone.

                              LORELAI
                I thought you replaced that last 
                time...Because you told me you did and 
                I never forget anything. So, then this 
                one's on you, right?...Pleasure doing 
                business with you.

She hangs up. Rory comes behind the desk poking around. She's 
  obviously very comfortable back there.                              LORELAI
                Judy, please go up and check on room 
                four. Make sure it's working.

                              JUDY
                Okay.

She looks around for someplace to dump the rest of the keys. 
  Lorelai impatiently takes them from her.

                              LORELAI
                Judy, listen to me. I've been working 
                for your aunt and uncle a long time. 
                And they've been good to me. So, when 
                they asked me to give you a job, train 
                you in the family business, I was happy 
              to do it. Happy. See, the smile? Okay, 
                but this is a really busy week, and I 
                need you to be faster and more 
                organized or please God in heaven find 
                yourself a rich husband.

ANGLE ON Michel who crosses over to Judy and whispers to her.

                              MICHEL
                Don't you listen to her. Find yourself 
                any husband, he doesn't have to be 
                rich.

Judy looks at him dejectedly and exits. Lorelai starts filing 
the keys back in their place at lightening speed. Rory starts 
  rooting around in the drawers. Michel notices.

                              MICHEL
                          (to Lorelai)
                What is your offspring doing?

                              RORY
                I need stamps.
                          (holding up stamps)
                Can I have these?

                              MICHEL
                No.

                              LORELAI
                Take them.
                          (off Rory's sweater)
                What's the deal with the muumuu?

                              RORY
                Stop.

                              LORELAI
                No, I'm just saying you couldn't find 
                one made of metal in case anyone has x-

                ray eyes?

                              RORY
                Who here heard me say stop?

DERECK an eighteen-year old absolutely adorable valet comes 
up to the desk.

                              DERECK
                Man, there's a lot of people here 
                today. I've got cars backed up all the 
                way down the driveway.

                              RORY
                Well, good thing you're in here.

                              DERECK
                          (to Lorelai)
                Oh, well, I just wanted to tell you 
                that I don't have to go to my Aunt's 
                funeral tomorrow. She didn't die yet.

                              LORELAI
                Well, maybe next week.

                              DERECK
                Yeah, maybe.
                          (beat, to Lorelai)
                That's a real nice outfit you're 
                wearing.

                              LORELAI
                Thank you, Dereck.

Dereck smiles at her. He's smitten. He takes off out the 
front door. Rory shakes her head.

                              RORY
                God, he is so puppy faced around you.

                              LORELAI
                Dereck's sweet. You should take a crack 
              at him.

                              RORY
                He's not into me, Mrs. Robinson.

                              LORELAI
                Well, he could be if you weren't 
                wearing an entire flock of sheep.

                              RORY
                And how we say good-bye.                              LORELAI
                Wait - give Michel your French paper to 
                look at before you go.

                              MICHEL
                Excuse?

                              RORY
                That would be great.

                              MICHEL
                No.

                              RORY
                Come on, Michel. I'll tell all the 
                ladies what stud you are.

                              MICHEL
                I believe they already know.

                              LORELAI
                Please, Michel? Please?
                          (in Betty Boop-ish baby talk 
                          voice)
                Pretty please with sucre with top? I'll 
                stop talking like this.

                              MICHEL
                Leave it. I'll look at it if I get a 
                chance.

                              RORY
                It's due tomorrow. And pay special 
                attention to grammar.

Rory exits. Lorelai looks at Michel smiling. Michel tries to 
ignore her, pretending to be busy. She keeps staring and 
  grinning.

                              MICHEL
                I despise you.


The kitchen is huge and chaotic with fabulous things cooking 
and bubbling. On the floor under an avalanche of pots and 
pans is SOOKIE ST. JAMES, the chef and Lorelai's best friend. 
She's a brilliant cook with no hand-eye coordination 
  whatsoever. Right now her forehead's bandaged, there's a 
splint on her left little finger and Band-Aids all over her 
arms. The sous-chef, SALVADOR, and a couple of the kitchen 
  helpers are trying to untangle her.

                              SOOKIE
                I'm okay.                              LORELAI
                What did you do now? Are you hurt? How 
                did this happened.
                          (in Spanish)
                Weren't you watching her?

                              SALVADOR
                          (in Spanish)
                I turned around for one second.

                              LORELAI
                Sookie, damn it, I told you to be 
                careful.

                              SOOKIE
                I know. I'm sorry. Hey, I fixed the 
                peach sauce.

                              LORELAI
                This is blood. You're bleeding. Why are 
                you bleeding?

                              SOOKIE
                Oh, I think my stitches opened. I used 
                too much maple syrup. It strangled the 
                fruit.

                              LORELAI
                When did you get stitches?

                              SOOKIE
                Friday night. Radish roses.

  Lorelai grabs a couple of kitchen towels and starts wrapping 
them around Sookie's hand. Sookie tries to reach up to the 
  counter to get a pan.

                              LORELAI
                Stop moving.

                              SOOKIE
                I want you to taste the sauce. You have 
              to try it while it's warm.

She reaches up again. She manages to grab a spoon and pull it 
down.

                              LORELAI
                Sookie, I mean it. You have to stay...

Sookie puts the spoon in her mouth.

                              LORELAI
                Dear God almighty that's incredible.                              SOOKIE
                I thought I'd put it on the waffles 
                tomorrow for breakfast.

                              LORELAI
                I swear, I want to bathe in this sauce. 
                You know, someday, when we open our own 
                inn? Diabetics will be lining up to eat 
                this sauce.

                              SOOKIE
                Oh, won't that be great?

                              LORELAI
                But the key to achieving that dream is 
                you staying alive long enough to 
                actually open the inn with me, 
                understand?

                              SOOKIE
                Yes. I understand.

                              LORELAI
                Okay, now, let's get you up and to the 
                doctor. On three. One, two, three.

                              SOOKIE
                Ow.

                              LORELAI
                            (panicked)
                What?

                              SOOKIE
                I stepped on my thumb. I'm fine. On 
                three. 

  Lorelai shakes her head and they try again.


MRS. TRAISTER, a tall, thin sharp-featured American 
  literature teacher is pacing the front of a packed classroom.

                              MRS. TRAISTER
                For those of you who have not finished 
                the final chapters of Huckleberry Finn, 
                you may use this time to do so. For 
                those who have, you may start your 
                essay now. Whichever task you choose, 
              do it silently.

Mrs. Traister sits down and starts grading papers. We PAN 
DOWN the row of students. We reach the back of the room where 
Rory is seated in the second to last row. She writing 
  feverishly, extremely concentrated on her task. She is 
  surrounded by a gaggle of girls who are all deeply fascinated 
by a bottle of nail polish. One girl tries it on, looks at 
it, shows it to the others, and then passes it on to the next 
girl, who does the same. Rory doesn't even look up. One of 
the girls notices Rory. She motions to the others to look. 
What is she doing that is so important? The girls lean into 
each other to conference.

                              GIRL ONE
                            (whispers)
                I bet it's a love letter.

                              GIRL TWO
              Or her diary.

                              GIRL THREE
                Could be a slam book.

Girl One motions the girl on Rory's right, GIRL FOUR, to take 
  a peek. Girl four leans over and starts at Rory's paper. She 
  frowns. She turns to the others with a puzzled look. They all 
lean in to each other again.

                              GIRL FOUR
                            (incredulous)
                It's the assignment.


This is Lane's house. The Kims have devised a very 
  interesting living arrangement for themselves. The family 
lives upstairs except for the kitchen. The downstairs is 
their antique store. It's crammed from top to bottom with 
  antiques. Tables are piled on top of each other, chairs are 
piled on top of tables. Sofas are hung from the ceiling. 
  There's not an inch of open space anywhere. Nor is there a 
clear path for people to walk through. The whole place is an 
  elaborate, dusty maze. Rory and Lane enter.

                              LANE
                          (calling off)
                Mom? We're home.

The girls listen.

                              LANE
                Did you hear something?

                              RORY
                I'm not sure.

                              LANE
                          (calling again)
                Mom?! Are you here?!

                              MRS. KIM (O.S.)
                          (very muffled)
                Lane?

                              RORY
              We have contact.

                              LANE
                          (calling toward the voice)
                Mom? Where are you?

                              MRS. KIM (O.S.)
                Lane? Where are you?

The girls head toward the voice.

                              LANE
                Back here!

                              MRS. KIM (O.S.)
                Over here.

The girls change direction.                              RORY
                I think she's that way.

                              LANE
                          (yells)
                Are we closer?

                              MRS. KIM (O.S.)
                I'm by the table.

Rory looks around at the sea of tables.

                              RORY
                She's kidding, right?

                              LANE
                          (calling to mom)
                Look, we'll meet you in the kitchen!

                              MRS. KIM (O.S.)
                What?!

                              RORY
                The kitchen!!

                              MRS. KIM (O.S.)
                Who's that?

                              LANE
                It's Rory, Mom.

                              MRS. KIM (O.S.)
                Oh.

                              RORY
                          (to Lane)
                Wow. I could hear the disappointment 
                from here.

                              LANE
                Come on.

The girls start to make their way to the back of the house.

                              RORY
                You know, it sucks that after all these 
                years your mom still hates me.

                              LANE
                She doesn't hate you.

                              RORY
                She hates my mother.

                              LANE
                She doesn't trust unmarried women.                              RORY
                You're unmarried.

                              LANE
                I'm hayriding with a future 
                  proctologist. I have potential.

The girls reach a small door in the back and go through it.


The girls enter to find MRS. KIM busy at the stove. Mrs. Kim 
is tiny with a slight Korean accent. She wears sneakers at 
all times since she moves about a thousand miles a minute.

                              MRS. KIM
                Tea is ready. I have muffins with no 
                dairy, no sugar, and no wheat. You have 
              to dip them in the tea to make them to 
                soft but they're very healthy.

Lane and Rory sit at the table. Mrs. Kim puts tea cups in 
front of them. 

                              MRS. KIM
                How was school? None of the girls get 
                pregnant and drop out?

                              LANE
                Not that we know of.

                              RORY
                Though come to think of it Joanna 
                Posner was glowing a little.

                              MRS. KIM
                What?

                              LANE
                Nothing Mama. She's kidding.

                              MRS. KIM
                          (to Rory, stern)
                Boys don't like funny girls.

                              RORY
                Noted.

The tinkling of the front door is faintly heard.

                              CUSTOMER (O.S.)
                Hello? Anybody here?

                              MRS. KIM
                            (yelling)
                We're here! We're coming!
                          (to the girls)
                              (MORE)                              MRS. KIM (CONT'D)
                Have more muffins. Only good for 
                twenty-four hours.

Mrs. Kim exits. We hear "Is anybody here? "Over here." 
  "Where?" "Follow my voice." As Mrs. Kim plays Marco Polo with 
the customer, Rory and Lane dunk a muffin in their tea, take 
  a bite, and quickly spit the disgusting inedible things out 
into their napkins.


  Lorelai is sitting at her desk opening a large stack of mail. 
Judy pokes her head in.

                              JUDY
                Hi. Uh, a man just called and said the 
                angels for the Langworthy wedding 
                aren't in yet. Is this...bad?

                              LORELAI
                Well, let's see. The wedding's on 
                Saturday, the angels aren't in, now 
                even with a total lack of deductive 
                skills, doesn't this sound...bad?

                              JUDY
                Yes. I'll call him back.

                              LORELAI
                Tell him if they're not here by 
                tomorrow I'll take to court and if he 
                tries to give you any grief...

  A letter has caught her attention. She opens it and reads.

                              JUDY
                What? If he gives me any grief, what? 
                Please, I need the specifics.

                              LORELAI
                          (off the letter)
              Oh my God! Oh my God!

  Lorelai runs out of the room. Judy looks after her.

                              JUDY
                Are you coming back?


  Sookie, with one arm in a sling, is moving quickly around the 
  kitchen. Salvador and two other guys are following her 
  closely, moving hanging pots she almost backs into, putting a 
rag in her hand before she touches something hot - it's a 
well orchestrated ballet. Lorelai bursts through the door.                              LORELAI
                Sookie! The Chilton school! She got in!

                              SOOKIE
              Oh my God! Oh my God!!

                              LORELAI
                          (reading the letter)
                "Dear Ms. Gilmore, we are happy to 
                inform you that we have a vacancy at 
                Chilton Preparatory starting up 
                immediately. Due to your daughter's 
                excellent grades and recommendations, 
                and your enthusiastic pursuit of her 
                enrollment..."
                          (to Sookie)
                I offered to blow the principal to get 
                her in.
                          (back to reading the letter)
                "...we would happy to accept her as 
                soon as the first semester's tuition 
                has been received."
                          (smiling huge)
                She did it. She's going to Chilton.

                              SOOKIE
                I'm so happy for you.

She and Sookie hug.

                              LORELAI
              Is something burning?

                              SOOKIE
              My bangs. Earlier.

                              LORELAI
                This is it, you know? From that school 
                she'll be able to get into any college 
                she wants. She's going to get the 
                education I never had and do all the 
                things I never did and I can resent her 
                for it and we can finally have a normal 
                mother daughter relationship. Okay, 
                more hugs.

They hug again.

                              LORELAI
                I love you. I really, really do!

  Lorelai exits. Sookie, swept up in the moment, grabs a rag, 
waves it in the air doing her own little jig.                              SOOKIE
                Rory's going to Chilton, Rory's going 
              to Chilton.

Sookie happily tosses away the rag and goes back to work. The 
rag lands on the stove and bursts into flames. Salvador 
calmly clamps a lid down on it and it's doused.

                                                                          FADE OUT:
                                END OF ACT ONE                                      ACT TWO

                                                                            FADE IN:


The room is small, but full of warmth and life. Old rugs, 
  lived-in furniture and antique quilts everywhere. There's 
  definitely not a set color scheme - just the organized chaos 
of two young women living under the same roof. There's a 
  fireplace much smaller than the elegant ones at the inn, 
whose mantle is crammed with photos of Lorelai and Rory and 
their friends. A happy little fire is burning away. Lorelai 
goes around the room lighting candles. Rory enters.

                              RORY
                Hey.

She sees the room.

                              RORY
                Wow.
                          (looking at the fire)
                Are those real logs?

                              LORELAI
                Yep.

                              RORY
                What, are we out of Duraflames?

                              LORELAI
                Nope.

                              RORY
                You're happy.

                              LORELAI
                Yep.

                              RORY
                Did you do something slutty?

                              LORELAI
                I'm not that happy.

  Lorelai pulls Rory into the dining room.


The beat-up round wooden dinner table is beautifully set with   candles, flowers, and a gorgeous meatloaf all on a silver 
  platter. And on top of Rory's plate is a beautifully wrapped 
  package.

                              RORY
                You made meatloaf?

                              LORELAI
                And mac and cheese. And that salad you 
                like with the sugared walnuts and the 
                blue cheese, and, Sookie made this 
                unbelievable cherry rum cake that you 
                are way too young to eat but what the 
                hell.

                              RORY
                What is going on?

                              LORELAI
                Open your present, please.

Rory rips the package open and pulls out a blue and white 
plaid skirt.

                              RORY
                I'm going to be in a Britney Spears 
                video.

                              LORELAI
                You're going to Chilton.

                              RORY
                            (floored)
                What?

                              LORELAI
                I got the letter today.

                              RORY
                This is not funny.

  Lorelai pulls the letter out of her pocket.

                              LORELAI
                You're in, baby.

Rory is stunned. She smiles. She laughs. She starts to cry.

                              LORELAI
              On no. Don't you dare cry.

  Lorelai goes over and hugs Rory who is full-on crying now.

                              RORY
                  I don't...how did this happen? You 
                didn't really...
                              (MORE)                              RORY (CONT'D)
                with the principal, did you?

                              LORELAI
                No, that was a joke. They got an 
                opening. I'm sending the check tomorrow 
                and you're starting on Monday.

                              RORY
              Oh my God! I can't believe this!!

                              LORELAI
                I know!!

They hug big time.

                              RORY
                Can we do this? Do we have the money?

                              LORELAI
                Hey, you let me worry about the money, 
                huh? You just worry about getting into 
                Harvard. Now, we have a lot of 
                fattening food to eat, so I suggest we 
                get started.

                              RORY
                Okay.

Rory sits back down in her seat and brushes the tears out of 
her eyes. Lorelai starts cutting the meatloaf. After a beat 
Rory can't control herself anymore. She rushes at Lorelai and 
gives her a huge flying hug that send both of them and the 
chair crashing to the ground.


Rory and Lane are at their lockers.

                              RORY
                And we get to wear uniforms. No more 
                having people check you out to see what 
                jeans you're wearing. Everyone dressed 
                alike in boring clothes just there to 
                learn.

                              LANE
                Okay, there's academic minded and then 
                there's eighty.

A guy comes down the hall. A very intense looking, dark eyed, 
  weirdly amazing looking guy. His eyes lock on Rory. She 
  doesn't notice. He stares at her as he goes down the hall. 
The girls close their lockers and head the other way.


Michel is standing next to the phone which is ringing. He's   letting it ring. Lorelai storms out of the office.

                              LORELAI
                Michel. The phone.

                              MICHEL
              It rings.

                              LORELAI
                Can you answer it?

                              MICHEL
                No. People are particularly stupid 
                today. I can't talk to any more of 
                them.

                              LORELAI
                You know who's really nice to talk to? 
                The people at the unemployment agency.

Michel picks up the phone.

                              MICHEL
                Independence Inn, Michel speaking.


  Lorelai is pacing, obviously very upset. Sounds of Musak are 
heard over the speaker phone. She's looking at the acceptance 
  letter. A voice comes on the speaker phone.

                              VOICE (O.S.)
                Chilton Prep.

                              LORELAI
                            (frantically dives for the 
                          phone)
                Yes. Hi. I've been holding for Mrs. 
                Bell. Okay, my daughter just got 
                accepted and...no this semester. Right. 
                Well, I was so excited when I read that 
                she got in that I didn't read the whole 
                letter and today I went to make out the 
                enrollment check and, well, I read the 
                whole letter and - that's a very high 
                fee you got yourself there. I was 
                wondering if you couldn't take, say, 
                part now just to get her going... But 
                she's supposed to start Monday and that 
                doesn't give me much time to pull a 
                bank job... I was kidding... A bank job 
              is robbing a bank... You know what, 
                never mind... No, no, no. Don't give 
                her space away. I'll figure it out... 
                Right. It's been a real treat talking 
              to you. Bye.


Sookie goes into the kitchen. Lorelai gets her sewing basket 
and starts pinning the skirt up.

                              RORY
                I can't believe tomorrow is my last day 
              at dormancy high school. I was so 
                excited today, I dressed for gym.

                              LORELAI
                You're kidding.

                              RORY
                And I played volleyball.

                              LORELAI
                With other people?

                              RORY
                And I learned that all this time I was 
                avoiding group sports?

                              LORELAI
                Yeah?

                              RORY
                Was very smart because I suck at them.

                              LORELAI
                Yeah, you got that from me.

Sookie comes back out of the kitchen wearing an apron.

                              SOOKIE
                Where's the pate?

                              LORELAI
              At Zsa Zsa Gabor's house.

Sookie goes back in the kitchen. Lorelai finishes pinning the 
skirt.

                              LORELAI
                Okay. Go see what you think.

                              RORY
                I love being a private school girl.

Rory runs off excitedly. Lorelai sits on the couch. She looks 
over at a photo on the table next to her. ANGLE ON a picture 
of a six-year-old Lorelai standing in front of a brick house 
with an unusually ornate iron door. ANGLE ON Lorelai as she picks up the picture. ANGLE ON the picture which fills the 
  screen. We DISSOLVE TO:


A far cry from the chaotic but homey clapboard house of 
  Lorelai's, this house is very elegant and upscale. Marble 
floors in the entry way, heavy drapes and crystal chandeliers 
make up a house that says "front page of Architectural 
  Digest" and "don't touch anything" simultaneously. They walk 
down the hall. The place looks great.

                              EMILY
              It hasn't changed.

                              LORELAI

The living room is even more imposing then the entry way. 
  Portraits of Emily and Lorelai's father Richard hang on the 
walls. Another portrait of a mischievously smiling little 
  Lorelai also hangs on the wall. The women sit down stiffly.

                              LORELAI
                So, how are the girls at the bridge 
                club?

                              EMILY
                Old.

                              LORELAI
                Well...good.

                              EMILY
                You said you were taking a business 
                class?

                              LORELAI
                Yeah. I take a business class at the 
                college twice a week. I'm sure I've 
                told you.

                              EMILY
                Well, if you're "sure" then you must 
                have.

An awkward beat passes.

                              LORELAI
                So...I'm executive manager at the Inn 
                now.

                              EMILY
                Really?

                              LORELAI
                I run the whole place.

                              EMILY
                You must be busy.

                              LORELAI
                It's just a matter of time before I can 
                buy my own inn.

                              EMILY
                Well, won't that be something.

The two women lapse back into silence for a beat.

                              EMILY
                Would you like some tea?                              LORELAI
                I'd love some coffee.

We hear the front door open. A gruff voice calls out.

                              RICHARD (O.S.)
                Emily? I'm home.

                              EMILY
                We're in here.

  RICHARD GILMORE enters. Richard is a tall, strong, 
  opinionated man of few words. He doesn't need that many. He 
stops in his tracks when he sees Lorelai.

                              RICHARD
                What is it, Christmas already?

                              LORELAI
                Hey, Dad.

                              EMILY
                Lorelai was taking a business class at 
                the college today and decided to drop 
              in to see us.

                              RICHARD
                What business class?

                              EMILY
                Well, she told us about it dear, 
                remember?

                              RICHARD
                No. He crosses to his very Blake 
                Carrington bar and pours himself a 
                drink.
                          (to Emily)
              Is she staying for dinner?

                              LORELAI
                No, she's not. Look, I actually came 
                here for a reason. Dad, could you maybe 
                sit down for a minute?

  Richard stands at the bar going through the mail.

                              RICHARD
                          (not looking up)
                You need money.

                              LORELAI
                I have a situation.

                              RICHARD
                You need money.                              LORELAI
                Would you please just let me get this 
                out? Please? Rory's been accepted to 
                Chilton.

                              EMILY
                Chilton? Oh, that's a wonderful school. 
                It's only five minutes from here.

                              LORELAI
                I know it is. I've been trying for two 
                years to get her in there. And now 
                there's an opening and we just found 
                out about it. She can start as early as 
                Monday. The problem is I have to put 
                down an enrollment fee plus this 
                semester's tuition and I have to do it 
                immediately or she loses her spot.

                              RICHARD
                          (beat, then without looking up)
                So, you need money.

                              LORELAI
                          (small)
                Yes.

  Richard puts the mail down. He and Emily look at each other.

                              LORELAI
                It's not for me, okay? It's for Rory. 
                This is a great opportunity for her, 
                and it would simply be a loan, I fully 
                intend to pay you back every cent. I 
                just can't let miss out on something 
                this important. I don't ask for favors, 
                you know that.

                              EMILY
                Oh, yes.
                          (pointedly)
              We know.

  Richard and Emily look at each other again.

                              RICHARD
                I'll get the checkbook.

                              LORELAI
                Thank you. I can't tell you...thank 
                you.

                              EMILY
              On one condition.                              LORELAI
                A condition?

                              EMILY
                Yes. Since we are now financially 
                involved in your life, I want to be 
                actively involved in your life.

                              LORELAI
                What does that mean, Mother?

                              EMILY
              It means that I want more contact. Not 
                just holidays and birthdays. Rory's 
                going to be going to school five 
                minutes from here, and you yourself are 
              in town at least twice a week, as you 
                told us.

                              LORELAI
                            (exasperated)
                I did tell you.

                              EMILY
                I want a weekly dinner.

                              LORELAI
                What?

                              EMILY
                Friday nights, you and Rory will have 
                dinner here.

                              LORELAI
                Mom...

                              EMILY
                And you have to call us once a week to 
                give us an update on her schooling and 
                your life. That's it. That's the 
                condition. If you agree, you can come 
              to dinner tomorrow night and leave here 
                with a check. Otherwise, I'm sorry we 
                can't help you.

                              LORELAI
                          (a long beat)
                I don't want her to know I borrowed 
                money from you. I want this to be 
                between us.

                              EMILY
              Is seven good for dinner?                              LORELAI
                          (beaten)
                Perfect.

  Richard goes back to the mail leaving mother and daughter 
  looking at each other.

                                                                          FADE OUT:
                                END OF ACT TWO                                    ACT THREE

FADE IN:


Rory is cleaning out her locker. Lane is helping her.

                              LANE
                So, I told my mom you're changing 
                schools.

                              RORY
                Was she thrilled?

                              LANE
                The party's on Friday.

Rory puts the last book in her bag and closes her locker.

                              RORY
                Well, that's it.
                            (regarding locker)
                Twenty - five - thirteen. It's all 
                yours. You're gonna like it. Great 
                front door access.

                              LANE
                Thanks. Oops, I have to go. I have to 
                have a pre-hayride cup of tea with the 
                future doctor. How do I look? Korean?

                              RORY
                The spitting image.

                              LANE
                Good. Bye.

Lane disappears around the corner. Rory bends down to pick up 
some trash that spilled out of her locker. When she gets back 
up the mystery boy is standing there.

                              RORY
                            (startled)
                God!

                              DEAN
                Sorry.

                              RORY
                You're like Ruth Gorden in Rosemary's 
                Baby. Just standing there with the 
                tannis root. Make some noise.

                              DEAN
                Are you cleaning out your locker?

Rory gets her first good look at the beautiful stranger. She's struck. This is a very new thing for her.

                              DEAN
              It looks like you're going somewhere.

                              RORY
                Oh, right. I am.

She stares at him a beat.

                              DEAN
                Where?

                              RORY
                New school.

                              DEAN
                You're moving?

                              RORY
                No, just my books are.

                              DEAN
              My family just moved here. From 
                Chicago.

                              RORY
                Chicago. Windy, Oprah...

                              DEAN
                Yeah. That's the place.

They stand there a beat.Rory stares at the ground.

                              DEAN
                I'm Dean.

                              RORY
                Hi.
                          (beat, then realizing)
                Oh. Rory. Me. That's...me.

                              DEAN
                Rory.

                              RORY
                Well, Lorelai technically.

                              DEAN
                Lorelai. I like that.

He smiles at her. She's melting.

                              RORY
                It's my mother's name, too. She named 
              me after herself. She was lying in the 
                hospital thinking about how men name 
                              (MORE)                              RORY (CONT'D)
                boys after themselves all the time, you 
                know? So, why couldn't women? Her 
                feminism just took over. Although 
                personally I think a lot of Demerol 
                also went into the decision.
                          (beat)
                I never talk this much.

They stand there a beat.

                              DEAN
                Well, I'd better go.

                              RORY
              Oh sure. Bye.

                              DEAN
                I have to go look for a job.

Dean takes a pen and a paper scrap out of his pocket and 
writes something down. He holds out the paper to her.

                              DEAN
              If you hear of anyone hiring around 
                here maybe you could give me a call.

                              RORY
              Oh sure. If I hear.

They look at each other a beat. Dean starts to walk away.

                              RORY
                You know you should check with Miss 
                Patty. She teaches dance. She was 
                actually on Broadway once.

                              DEAN
                I don't really dance much.

                              RORY
                No. She just kind of knows everything 
                that's happening in town. She'll know 
              if someone's looking.

                              DEAN
                Oh. Great. Thanks.

Dean starts away again. Rory looks after him wishing he'd 
stop but not knowing how to make him. Dean stops.

                              DEAN
                Hey, what're you doing now?

                              RORY
                Nothing. Much.
                          (looks at the trash in her hand)
                              (MORE)                              RORY (CONT'D)
                I should throw this way at some point.

                              DEAN
                Maybe you could show me where this Miss 
                Patty's place is?

                              RORY
                            (brightening up)
                Yeah. I guess so. I don't really have 
                anything important to...let's go.

Rory drops the trash on the ground and they start off. Dean 
grabs her backpack and swings it over his shoulder.


  Lorelai and Rory sit eating salads. Neither with a lot of 
gusto. They're both a little preoccupied.

                              LORELAI
                You were late getting home tonight.

                              RORY
                          (lying)
                Yeah. I went to the library.

They sit a beat.

                              LORELAI
                Oh, I forgot to tell you, we're having 
                dinner with the grandparents tomorrow 
                night.

                              RORY
              We are?

                              LORELAI
                Yeah.

                              RORY
                But it's September.

                              LORELAI
                So?

                              RORY
                What holiday is in September?

                              LORELAI
                            (exasperated)
                Look it's not a holiday thing, okay? 
                It's just dinner.

                              RORY
                Fine. Sorry. God.

They sit there not eating a beat. Luke brings over their   burgers.

                              LUKE
                          (to Lorelai)
                Rare meat can kill you. Enjoy.

Luke walks away. Lorelai and Rory just sit a beat.

                              LORELAI
                I finished your skirt today.

Rory doesn't answer.

                              LORELAI
                A grunt of acknowledgment might be 
                nice.

                              RORY
                I don't understand why we're going to 
                dinner tomorrow night. What if I had 
                plans? You didn't even ask me.

                              LORELAI
              If you had plans I would've known.

                              RORY
                How?

                              LORELAI
                You would've told me.

                              RORY
                I don't tell you everything. I have my 
                own things.

                              LORELAI
                Fine. You have things.

                              RORY
                That's right. I have things.

                              LORELAI
                Hey, I had dibs on being the bitch 
                tonight.

                              RORY
                Just tonight?

                              LORELAI
                What the hell is up your butt?

Beat.

                              RORY
                I'm not sure I want to go to Chilton.                              LORELAI
                            (floored)
                What?

                              RORY
                The timing is just really bad.

                              LORELAI
                The timing is bad?

                              RORY
                And the bus ride to and from Hartford? 
                It's forty minutes each way. That's 
                time I could be studying, or helping 
                you out at the inn.

                              LORELAI
                I can't believe what I'm hearing.

                              RORY
                Plus, I don't think we should be 
                spending the money right now and I know 
                Chilton's gotta be costing you a lot.

                              LORELAI
                          (rubbing her temples)
                Oh, you have no idea.

                              RORY
                All of your money should be going 
                toward buying an inn with Sookie.

                              LORELAI
                What about college? What about Harvard?

                              RORY
              We don't know that I can't get into 
                Harvard if I stay where I am.

                              LORELAI
                Okay, end of the crazy talk. I 
                appreciate your concern about the 
                money, but I've got all that covered.

                              RORY
                I still don't want to go.

                              LORELAI
                Why?

                              RORY
                Because I don't.

                              LORELAI
                I have to get out of here.

  Lorelai gets up and heads for the door.                              RORY
              We have to pay first.

  Lorelai comes back, takes a twenty out of her purse, throws 
it on the table and heads out. Rory follows her.


Rory enters and slams the door. Lorelai enters right on her 
heels. The door gets slammed again.

                              LORELAI
                This is about a boy. Of course. I can't 
                believe I didn't see it. All this talk 
                about money and bus rides...you've got 
                a thing going with a guy and you don't 
                want to leave school.

                              RORY
                I'm going to bed.

                              LORELAI
                God, I'm so dense. That should've been 
              my first thought. After all, you're me.

                              RORY
                            (emphatically)
                I'm not you.

                              LORELAI
                Really? Someone willing to throw 
                important life experiences out the 
                window to be with a guy? Sounds like me 
              to me.

                              RORY
                Whatever.

                              LORELAI
              So who is he?

                              RORY
                There's no guy.

                              LORELAI
                Dark hair? Romantic eyes? Looks a 
                little dangerous?                              RORY
                This conversation is over.

                              LORELAI
                Tattoos are good too.

                              RORY
                I don't want to change schools because 
              of all the reasons that I already told 
                you a thousand times. If you don't want 
              to believe me, that's fine. Good-night.

                              LORELAI
                Does he have a motorcycle? 'Cause if 
                you're going to throw your life away, 
                he'd better have a motorcycle!

Rory exits off to her bedroom.


Rory is changing into her sweats. Lorelai enters.

                              RORY
                Thanks for the knock.

                              LORELAI
                Rory, please, just talk to me.

Rory gets into bed, grabs a book and proceeds to read.

                              LORELAI
                Fine, I'll talk. Look, don't get me 
                wrong. Guys are great. I'm a huge fan 
              of guys. You don't get knocked up at 
                sixteen being indifferent to guys. But 
                babe, guys are always going to be 
                there. This school isn't. It's more 
                important. It has to be more important.

                              RORY
                Please, let me go to sleep.

                              LORELAI
                You've always been the sensible one in 
                this house. I need you to remember that 
                feeling now. You will kick your own ass 
                later if you blow this.

                              RORY
                Well, it's my ass.

                              LORELAI
                Okay, you know what? We've always had a 
                democracy here. Nothing happened unless 
              we both agreed. 
                              (MORE)                              LORELAI (CONT'D)
                But this time I'm gonna have to play 
                the "Mom" card.

She stands up.

                              LORELAI
                You're going to Chilton. I don't care 
                whether you want to or not. Monday 
                morning you will be there, end of 
                story.

                              RORY
                We'll see.

                              LORELAI
                Yes, we will.

  Lorelai exits the room. Rory turns on her CD player. Macy 
Gray's "I Try" plays as Rory lays there miserable.


  Lorelai enters and slams the door. She turns on her CD 
  player. The same Macy Gray song, "I Try", plays as she lies 
down on her bed miserable.

                                                                          FADE OUT:
                              END OF ACT THREE                                    ACT FOUR

FADE IN:


A team of burly men are moving an enormous stove out of the 
  kitchen. Black smoke pours from it. Lorelai is signing a 
  clipboard full of papers. A very distraught Sookie stands 
next to her.

                              SOOKIE
                I swear, I don't know what happened.

                              LORELAI
                It's not important.

                              SOOKIE
                I've made that dish a hundred times. 
                It's never exploded.

                              LORELAI
                It's fine.

                              SOOKIE
                          (tearing up)
              Oh God, I killed a Viking.

  Lorelai hands the delivery man back his clipboard. He exits.

                              SOOKIE
                You should fire me. Or at least take 
                the cost of the new stove out of my 
                paycheck.

                              LORELAI
                Whatever you want.

                              SOOKIE
                I can't afford to pay for a new stove. 
                Those things are expensive.

                              LORELAI
                Sookie, please, I'm begging you, pull 
                yourself together because I got no 
                sleep last night and I think I put my 
                pantyhose on backwards.

                              SOOKIE
                Rory's still mad at you?

                              LORELAI
                Hey, I'm not so crazy about her either.                              SOOKIE
              It was just a fight. Mothers and 
                daughters fight.

                              LORELAI
                No. We don't fight. We never fight.

Michel enters.

                              MICHEL
                You told me to inform you when your 
                daughter arrived. Well, she's here and 
                she's sitting in my chair.

                              LORELAI
                I'll be back in minute.

  Lorelai rushes out of the kitchen. Michel looks at the empty 
hole where the stove once stood, and then at Sookie.

                              MICHEL
                And you're the one left standing. 
                Life's a funny, funny thing, no?


Rory is sitting in a chair reading. Lorelai walks over.

                              LORELAI
                Hey, no muumuu today. You know what's 
                weird? I kind of miss it.

                              RORY
                You left me a note to meet you here.

                              LORELAI
                Yeah, I thought maybe you could help 
                out for a couple of hours. We've got 
                this wedding tomorrow, things are 
                crazy. You could make a little extra 
                cash.

                              RORY
                          (goes back to her reading)
                Fine.

                              LORELAI
                So, are you going to give me the "mommy 
                dearest" treatment forever?

                              RORY
                You wanted me here, I'm here. Should I 
              do something, or what?

                              LORELAI
                          (fed up with her)
                Yeah. Go home. Dinner's at seven. 
                              (MORE)                              LORELAI (CONT'D)
              Be ready to go.

                              RORY
                Fine.

Rory exits. Lorelai looks after her. Michel comes over.

                              MICHEL
                            (happily)
                Ah, my chair.

He sits at his chair. Lorelai goes in the back office and 
slams the door.


  Lorelai and Rory enter.                              EMILY
                I can't tell you what a treat this is 
              to have you girls here.

                              LORELAI
                Yeah. We're pretty excited, too.

Emily looks at Lorelai's coffee container.

                              EMILY
              Is that a collector's cup or can I 
                throw it away for you?

                              LORELAI
                Oh, I can do it. She starts to drop the 
                cup into a small waste basket.

                              EMILY
              In the kitchen, please.

                              LORELAI
                Right. Sorry.

                              EMILY
                Rory. Just let me look at you. You are 
                just exquisite. Look at that skin. Oh, 
                it's so good to see you.

Emily gives Rory a long hug.

                              RORY
                It's good to see you too, Grandma.

  Lorelai and Rory take their coats off and hang them up.

                              EMILY
                            (grabbing Rory's hands and 
                          leading her into the living 
                          room)
                So, I want to hear all about Chilton.

                              RORY
                Well, I haven't actually started yet.

They exit into the living room. Lorelai drops her cup into 
the forbidden trash can and follows them in.


  Richard is sitting reading a paper. Emily and Rory enter with 
  Lorelai right behind them.

                              EMILY
                Richard, look who's here. He glances 
                up.                              RICHARD
                Rory. You're tall.

                              RORY
                I guess.

                              RICHARD
                What's your height?

                              RORY
                Five eight.

                              RICHARD
                That's tall. She's tall. He goes back 
              to his paper.

                              LORELAI
                Hi, Dad.

                              RICHARD
                Rory. Your daughter's tall.

                              RORY
                Yeah. It's freakish. We're going to 
                have her studied at M.I.T.

Emily goes to the bar and starts pouring champagne.

                              EMILY
                Champagne anyone?

                              LORELAI
                Champagne. Wow. Fancy.

                              EMILY
                Well, it's not every day that I have my 
                girls here for dinner on a day the 
                banks are open...A toast.

She hands a glass to Lorelai and a glass to Rory.

                              EMILY
              To Rory entering Chilton. And an 
                exciting new phase in her life.

                              RICHARD
                          (still reading the paper)
                Here, here. They all toast and take a 
                sip of champagne.

                              EMILY
                This is so exciting. An education is 
                the most important thing in the world, 
                after family.                              LORELAI
                And pie.

Emily and Richard look at her.

                              LORELAI
                Joke.

                              EMILY
                Ah.

The room sinks into silence with Lorelai and Emily avoiding 
each others eyes. Without looking up Richard hands Rory part 
of the paper.


The dining room is formal and a bit Citizen Kane-ish. Several 
large silver platters with domed lids have been set on the 
table.

                              EMILY
                Rory, how do you like the lamb?

                              RORY
                It's good.

                              EMILY
                Too dry?

                              RORY
                No.

                              EMILY
                Tina always leaves it in too long. I'll 
                have her make something else.

                              RORY
                Please don't. It's fine.

                              EMILY
                Well, alright then.

Beat.

                              LORELAI
                The potatoes are a little salty though.

                              EMILY
                Excuse me?

                              RORY
                          (jumping in)
                So, Grandpa, how's the insurance biz?                              RICHARD
                People die, we pay. People crash cars, 
              we pay. People lose a foot, we pay.

                              LORELAI
                Well, at least you've got your new 
                slogan.

                              RICHARD
                And how are things at the motel?

                              LORELAI
                The inn. They're fine.

                              EMILY
                Lorelai is the executive manager now. 
                Isn't that wonderful?

                              RICHARD
                Speaking of which, Christopher called 
                yesterday.

                              LORELAI
                            (incredulous)
                "Speaking of which"? How is that a 
                "speaking of which"?

                              RICHARD
                He's doing very well out in California. 
                He's got his own practice now.
                          (to Rory)
                He's a very talented man, your father.

                              LORELAI
                She knows.

                              RICHARD
                          (to Rory)
                Always was a smart one, that boy. You 
                must take after him.

Rory shoots a look at her mother nervously. Lorelai's pissed.

                              LORELAI
                Speaking of which, I'm going to get a 
                Coke...or a knife.

  Lorelai exits into the kitchen.


The kitchen is huge, with state-of-the-art restaurant quality 
  appliances. There are dirty pots pans everywhere. Tina, the 
maid, is piping whipped cream on the dessert. Lorelai enters, 
  fuming. She paces around trying to figure out what to do 
next. She spots a sink full of dishes. She grabs a pair of 
rubber gloves and furiously starts to wash them. Lorelai 
looks over at the stunned maid.                              LORELAI
                            (gruffly)
                Hey, how're ya doing?

She continues to scrub like a mad woman.


Emily and Richard continue to eat. Rory stares at the kitchen 
door. She starts to get up.

                              RORY
                I think I'm going to go talk to...

                              EMILY
                No. I'll go. You stay and keep your 
                Grandfather company.

Rory sits down reluctantly. Emily goes into the kitchen.


Emily enters to find Lorelai at the sink.

                              EMILY
                Lorelai, come back to the table.

                              LORELAI
                He's a piece of work, my father.

                              EMILY
              He didn't mean anything by that.

                              LORELAI
              Is this what it's going to be like 
                every Friday night? I come over here 
                and let the two of you attack me?

                              EMILY
                You're being very dramatic.

                              LORELAI
                Dramatic? Were you at that table just 
                now?

                              EMILY
                Yes, I was, and I think you took what 
                your father said the wrong way.

                              LORELAI
                How could you take that the wrong way? 
                What was left open to interpretation?


  Richard persues the paper as Rory stares at the kitchen door. 
You can clearly hear the conversation going on inside.                              EMILY (O.S.)
                Keep your voice down.

                              LORELAI (O.S.)
                No. I can't take it anymore. Tonight 
                has been like a nightmare.

                              EMILY (O.S.)
                You're dripping all over the floor!

                              LORELAI (O.S.)
                So, sue me. Hire Christopher to be your 
                lawyer. That would be cozy!

Rory is starting to get uncomfortable.


                              LORELAI
                Why do you pounce on every single thing 
                I say?

                              EMILY
                That's absurd. You've barely uttered a 
                word all night.

                              LORELAI
                That's not true.

                              EMILY
                You said "pie".

                              LORELAI
                Oh, come on.

                              EMILY
                You did. All I heard you say was "pie".

                              LORELAI
                Why would he bring up Christopher? Was 
                that necessary?

                              EMILY
              He likes Christopher.

                              LORELAI
                Well, isn't that interesting? Because 
              as I remember, when Christopher got me 
                pregnant, Dad didn't like him so much.

                              EMILY
              Oh well, please. You were sixteen. What 
                were we supposed to do, throw the two 
              of you a party? We were disappointed. 
                The two of you had such bright futures.                              LORELAI
                Yes. And by not getting married we got 
              to keep those bright futures.

                              EMILY
                When you get pregnant, you get married. 
                A child needs a mother and a father.

                              LORELAI
                Mom, do you think Christopher would be 
                a lawyer right now if we had gotten 
                married? Do you think he'd be anything 
              at all?

                              EMILY
                Yes, I do. Your father would have put 
                him in the insurance business and you'd 
              be living a lovely life right now!

                              EMILY
                That's right. Far away from us.

                              LORELAI
                Oh, here we go.

                              EMILY
                You took that girl and completely shut 
              us out of your life. You moved, you 
                wouldn't accept our help, our money...

                              LORELAI
                You wanted to control my life.

                              EMILY
                You were still a child.

                              LORELAI
                I stopped being a child the minute the 
                strip turned pink, okay? I had to 
                figure out how to build a life. I found 
                a good job...

                              EMILY
              As a maid. With all your brains and 
                talents.

                              LORELAI
                I worked my way up. I run the place 
                now. I built a life on my own. With no 
                help from anyone.

                              EMILY
                And think of where you would've been if 
                you had accepted a little help, hmm? 

The voices are crystal clear.

                              EMILY (O.S.)
              If it weren't for your ridiculous pride 
                your life could've been better. But no. 
                You were too proud to take anything 
                from anyone. You were always too proud 
              to accept anything from anyone.

                              LORELAI (O.S.)
                I wasn't too proud to come here to you 
                two, begging for money for my kid's 
                school, was I? 

Rory looks up, stunned. This is big news to her.


                              EMILY
                No, but you're too proud to let her 
                know where you got it from, aren't you? 
                Well, fine. You have your precious 
                pride. And I have my weekly dinners. 
                Isn't that nice? We both win.

Emily exits back in to the butler's pantry. Lorelai stands 
there exhausted.


Rory doesn't know what to do now. She turns toward her 
  Grandfather. ANGLE ON: Richard. His head dropped. He's fast 
  asleep.


  Lorelai drives silently. Rory looks at her mother a beat.

                              RORY
                So...you want to get a cup of coffee?

                              LORELAI
                Desperately.


  Lorelai and Rory enter. They sit at their usual table.

                              RORY
                So, nice dinner at the grandparents 
                house.                              LORELAI
                Yep. Her dishes have never been 
                cleaner.

                              RORY
                You and Grandma seemed to have a nice 
                talk.

                              LORELAI
                How much did you hear?

                              RORY
                Oh, not much. You know, snippets.

                              LORELAI
                Snippets.

                              RORY
                Little snippets.

                              LORELAI
              So you heard everything.

                              RORY
                Basically. Yes.

                              LORELAI
                          (sighs)
                Well, the best laid plans.

                              RORY
                I think it was very brave of you to ask 
                them for money.

                              LORELAI
                I so do not want to talk about it.

                              RORY
                How many meals is it going to take till 
                we're off the hook?

                              LORELAI
                I think my funeral will be the last 
                one.
                          (beat, then realizing)
                Oh, wait, does this mean...

                              RORY
                I can't let a perfectly good plaid 
                skirt go to waste.

                              LORELAI
                You won't be sorry.

Luke comes over. He's dressed in a clean button up shirt and 
a good pair of 501's. He cleans up good.                              LORELAI
                Wow. You look...nice. Really nice.

                              LUKE
                Oh, I had a meeting earlier. At the 
                bank. They like collars. You look nice 
                too.

                              LORELAI
                Yeah, well, I had a flagellation to go 
                to.

                              LUKE
                So, what'll you have?

                              LORELAI
                Coffee. In a bowl.

                              RORY
                I'll have Coffee also. And chili fries.

                              LUKE
                That's quite a refined palate you got 
                there. 

Luke walks off. Lorelai watches him go a beat. She then turns 
back to Rory.

                              LORELAI
                Behold the healing powers of a shower.
                          (turning back to Rory)
                So.

                              RORY
                What?

                              LORELAI
                Tell me about the guy.

                              RORY
                You know what's really special about 
                our relationship? The total 
                  understanding about the need for one's 
                privacy. I mean, you really understand 
                boundaries.

                              LORELAI
                          (beat)
                So, tell me about the guy.

                              RORY
                Mom...

                              LORELAI
              Is he dreamy?                              RORY
                Oh, that's so Nick at Nite.

                              LORELAI
                I'm going to find out anyhow.

                              RORY
                Really, how?

                              LORELAI
                I'll spy

Luke brings over the coffee and the fries.

                              LUKE
                Fries and coffee. I can't stand it. 
                This is so unhealthy. Rory, please, put 
                down that cup of coffee. You do not 
                want to grow up to be like your mom.

                              RORY
                Sorry. Too late.

  Lorelai smiles at Rory, then sips her coffee happily as we:

                                                                          FADE OUT:
                                  END OF SHOW
