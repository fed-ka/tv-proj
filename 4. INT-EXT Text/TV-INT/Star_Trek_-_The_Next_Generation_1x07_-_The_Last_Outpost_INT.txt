        On screen APPEARS the FERENGI STARSHIP: a strange

                GEORDI 
            Not good, sir. The Ferengi 
            forcefield that holds this ship 
            compensates... 
              (taps board) 
            Almost as fast as we increase 
            power. 

                RIKER 
            Almost? 

        Using his hands as a demonstration, Geordi tries to 
        explain the "isometric" problem of the forcefield.

            I wonder what they're thinking 
            over there. 

                PICARD 
            That's easy. They're wondering 
            what we are thinking... and what 
            we might do next. 

                WORF 
            I say fight, sir. There is

            an act of war? 

                TROI 
            The facts are that the Ferengi 
            did fire at us, but we were 
            chasing them. Since then, they've 
            only searched our computers, 
            trying to learn who and what we 
            are. 

                PICARD 
            Your point, Counselor? 

                TROI 
            Let's talk to them.

            But did we tell them anything they 
            wanted to hear? 

        There's not a person present who doesn't know the 
        implication of that statement. 

                PICARD 
            Any other observations? 

        Picard waits; there are none.

            Thank you all for your advice and

            You wished to discuss surrender, 
            Captain Picard? 

                PICARD 
            What I actually said, DaiMon, 
            is... 

                TAAR'S COM VOICE 
              (interrupting) 
            UNCONDITIONAL... 

        The Bridge reverberates with Taar's booming voice, 
        shattering every last hope. 

                TAAR'S COM VOICE 
              (continuing; a difficult 
               beat) 
            ... Surrender, I warn you, is... 
              (emphatic) 
            Totally unacceptable!! 
              (desperate but proud) 
            We will die to the last one of 
            us before such dishonor! 

        Nobody can believe their ears! Picard shares a look with 
        Riker and Troi, understanding now the incredible thing 
        that has happened. Picard turns quickly to Tasha, makes 
        a hand/slash signal. In response, Tasha touches her 
        panel. 

                TASHA 
            Hailing frequency off, sir. 

        Now WE SEE Picard at his command best as he gives a 
        series of orders.             STAR TREK: "The Last Outpost" - 8/7/87 - ACT TWO      23.

                PICARD 
              (to Riker) 
            Something has seized their ship 
            too. They're in the same predicament 
            as us. 
              (to Geordi) 
            Launch a sensor probe. Set it 
            to search for the source of this 
            "something" that's holding us both. 
              (to Tasha) 
            Back to hailing fequencies, fast. 
              (Com technique) 
            ... and so I regret DaiMon Taar 
            that I can no longer negotiate 
            unless it is conducted visually. 

                TAAR'S COM VOICE 
              (beat; concerned) 
            Your complete message not 
            received, Enterprise. But visual 
            communication is against our 
            custom. 

                PICARD 
              (into Com) 
            And it is against Starfleet orders 
            to accept a surrender otherwise. 
            Do you withdraw your surrender 
            offer? 

        A long delay -- enough time for the Enterprise Crew to 
        become nervous. Then: 

                TAAR'S COM VOICE 
            You give us no choice, Enterprise. 
            May we have a visual on you too?

                PICARD 
              (into Com) 
            Agreed, DaiMon Taar. You should 
            be able to view us now. 
              (waits) 
            Do you have us on your screen?

        The MAIN VIEWER FLICKERS and AN IMAGE OF DAIMON TAAR'S 
        FERENGI FACE comes into sight -- large, menacing, 
        lens-twisted and very brightly lit.

                TAAR'S COM VOICE 
            I do not know how your twisted 
            alien culture has paralyzed our 
            vessel but I concede your 
            'Enterprise' is superior. 
              (snaps) 
            We will return your worthless T-9 
            device and we offer the life of 
            our second officers as required 
            by the Ferengi code. 

        The Enterprise crew does not give themselves away with 
        cheers, but the relief is evident. 

                DATA 
            I am relieved we have no such code 
            involving our second officers. 

                TAAR (V.O.) 
            Is this to your satisfaction, 
            Picard Captain? 

                PICARD 
            Your offer may be inadequate, but 
            I will discuss it with my staff. 
            Stand by for further communications. 

        The CRACKLE ends, the Ferengi transmission complete. 
 

        It is a place dominated by a viewing screen which is 
        flanked by computer panels. TWO TEEN BOYS are 
        inspecting the starship reliefs. They see Picard 
        coming, make their hasty EXIT as the bridge personnel 
        ENTER... leaving a plaything near the viewscreen, a 
        Chinese finger PUZZLE.             STAR TREK: "The Last Outpost" - 8/7/87 - ACT TWO      25.

               ENTERING) 
            Matthews! Pola! You know this 
            area is off-limits. 
              (as Boys LEAVE) 
            Boys will be boys, Captain. 

        Picard gives Riker a withering look at this statement. 
        Data and Geordi also ENTER. 

                PICARD 
              (to Geordi) 
            Have you launched the probe? 

                GEORDI 
            Yes, sir. We'll get readings 
            soon. 

                PICARD 
              (to Geordi) 
            If we're not holding the Ferengi 
            and they're not holding us... then 
            who the hell is? 
              (to Data) 
            Next, you wanted to show us 
            something? 

                DATA 
            As requested, Captain, 
            library-computer information on 
            this planet. 

      27   ANGLE EMPHASIZING DATA AND VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL) 
 
        Data has picked up the finger-puzzle game, plays with it 
        abstractly, as: 

                DATA 
            It has been charted only, from 
            long range scans. It is Class 
            M, but with no indications of life 
            forms, sentient or otherwise. 
            However, you may find this of 
            interest... 

        Data touches a panel and on the screen APPEARS AN IMAGE 
        OF A HOLOGRAPHIC STAR MAP with a huge ball of artificial 
        connecting lines. An INCOMPREHENSIBLE ALIEN LEGEND 
        APPEARS TOO.             STAR TREK: "The Last Outpost" - 8/7/87 - ACT TWO      26.

            Resolving it into our language... 

        Data touches a control and an unusual SYMBOL APPEARS, 
        together, with the words "TKON EMPIRE." 

                PICARD 
            A space federation of some sort. 
            But I've never heard the word 
            "Tkon." 

                DATA 
              (distracted by stuck 
               finger) 
            Understandable. It has been 
            extinct six hundred thousand 
            of... of our years. 
              (back to viewer; back 
               to finger problem) 
            According to... legend, these 
            planets... were outposts... of that 
            empire... 

        Data has put his opposing finger from his other hand 
        into the open puzzle end... and pulls it tight, trapping 
        himself. Another snap or two finds him quite ensnared. 
 
                PICARD 
            Data. What are you doing? 

                DATA 
            Apologies, Captain. I seem to have 
            reached an odd functional impass. 
            I am, ah... 
              (futile tug) 
            Stuck. 

                PICARD 
            Then get unstuck and continue your 
            briefing. 

                DATA 
            Yes, sir. That is what I am trying 
            to do... 
              (no go again) 
            But the solution eludes me. 

                GEORDI 
              (laughs) 
            My hero. 

        Picard reaches over, grabs Data's hands in his own and 
        pushes in... releasing Data's trapped fingers.             STAR TREK: "The Last Outpost" - 8/7/87 - ACT TWO      27.

            Intriguing. 
              (then quickly indicating 
               viewscreen) 
            Again, only legend, but it 
            describes the Empire as impossibly 
            huge and powerful.

            Excuse the interruption, Captain,

            probe. 

                PICARD

                DATA 
            This planet, Gamma Tauri IV, 
            could have been the most distant

            Your alien images again shock us. 

                PICARD 
            DaiMon Tarr, regarding your

                PICARD 
            It... acknowledges your interest

            suggest?! 

        Picard takes a breath, this is not going well. 

                PICARD 
            All I am trying to say is you have

                PICARD 
            Certainly not. And I have no wish 
            to argue issues of territory or 
            property, when our mutual problem 
            remains. Like it or not... 
              (firm) 
            We are both trapped by the power 
            draining forcefield of this 
            planet. 

                TAAR 
              (lets up) 
            On that matter, there can be no 
            argument. 

                PICARD 
            Might I propose a swap?

        Taar's face grimaces at the foul-sounding new word. 
 
                TAAR 
            And... what is a "szwop"? 

                PICARD 
            An exchange, a trade... 

                TAAR 
            Yes, trade, hu-man. What is your 
            offer? 

        Picard's getting somewhere, and Troi acknowledges the 
        progress with a smile to her captain. 

                PICARD 
            We will give you what we know 
            about the planet, and in trade, 
            you will give us your information. 

                TAAR 
            Ridiculous. How will we know you 
            have not cheated us? 

                PICARD 
            We must trust each other, Taar. 

        Tarr responds with a grating laugh at this idea. 

                TAAR 
            Amusing, hu-man. But impractical. 

                PICARD 
            Then may I propose we both 
            cooperate in a joint examination 
            of the planet surface? 

                TAAR 
            And what profit is in this, Picard 
            Captain? 

                PICARD 
            The profit, DaiMon Tarr, lies in 
            saving all our lives. 

        Taar considers a beat, then answers, a deal being done. 
 
                TAAR 
            We will agree to this. But I warn 
            you now, any further trickery on 
            your part will be met with no 
            mercy. Understood?

                PICARD 
            Understood. 
              (onward) 
            If you care to join us, we have 
            a well-proven transporter 
            device which... 

                TAAR 
            We have a matter-energy device 
            of our own. We will beam a 
            science team of three to whatever 
            coordinates you propose. 

                PICARD 
            Excellent. We will transmit that 
            information shortly. Enterprise 
            out. 

        Picard nods at Tasha. 

                TASHA 
            Hailing frequencies off. 

        The Main Viewer has returned to an image of the Ferengi 
        vessel and the planet. 

                PICARD 
            I'll log that as "promising," at 
            least. 

                RIKER 
            I wonder, Captain. Ordinarily, 
            I don't believe in distrust at 
            first sight... but this may be 
            an exception. 

                DATA 
            Especially in view of the fact 
            the image he transmitted was 
            likely distorted somehow, sir. 

                TROI 
            I felt the same thing, Captain. 
            He was hiding something. 

                RIKER 
              (stands) 
            With this power drain I see no 
            reason to delay, sir. 
              (looks around) 
            I'd like some additional help 
            on this. Can you spare Worf?

              (nods) 
            Take him. And be careful, Number 
            One. 

        Riker CROSSES toward the turbolift, FOLLOWED by Data, 
        Geordi, Tasha and Worf. Their Bridge positions are 
        immediately filled. 


        A strong away team of five: Riker, Data, Tasha, Geordi 
        and Worf. All are armed with phasers, including a 
        couple of large ones, plus a couple of tricorders. They 
        step onto the "pads." 

                TRANSPORTER CHIEF 
            With this power drain, we may have 
            trouble communicating with you, 
            sir. 

                RIKER 
            Understood. Anything else? 

                TRANSPORTER CHIEF 
              (reluctant) 
            Due to this forcefield, there is 
            presently no way... to beam you 
            back, sir. 

                GEORDI 
            You had to ask. 

                RIKER 
            Understood. 
              (checking the others, 
               then) 
            Energize! 

        WE SEE the TRANSPORTER EFFECT. 


        Various SHOTS REVEAL the exhausted and weakening crew 
        still at their stations... Beverly is struggling to aid 
        the stricken. She passes Picard who is doing the same.

        bringing an armload of silvery thermal blankets onto the 
        bridge, distributing. She passes the captain.

                PICARD 
            How far down is it likely to go? 

                BEVERLY 
            A lot. Even in orbital space it 
            gets past minus two hundred 
            degrees. 

                TROI 
            We won't have to worry past... 
              (tries to smile) 
            ... minus seventy or so. 

                PICARD 
              (shivers) 
            Feels like that right now. 


        Picard comforts a crewmember, then CROSSES to Beverly. 
        They're both very cold and weak, GASP OUT their words. 
 
                BEVERLY 
            I should visit... the family 
            decks...again... 

                PICARD 
              (shakes head) 
            I've diverted... all reserve... 
            power there. They'll... last 
            longest. 
              (looks around) 
            Is there anything else we can do, 
            Doctor? 

        Beverly shakes her head. Then Picard remembers 
        something. 

                PICARD 
              (continuing) 
            Where is... your son Wesley? 

                BEVERLY 
              (beat) 
            I gave him... something. He'll 
            have a... terrible headache if we 
            live. 

                PICARD 
            You shouldn't have. 

                BEVERLY 
            Shouldn't have? 
              (weak but outraged) 
            He's my son. I love him...

        with a nod. 

                BEVERLY 
            That is... a male perspective! 

        From deep in his thermal blankets, Picard makes a 
        MUFFLED SOUND. 

                BEVERLY 
              (continuing) 
            What?

            What did you say, Jean-Luc? 

                PICARD 
            I said... rubbish! 


        as all power is restored, the bridge lights and a/c 
        return to norm, not a lot too late. The crew begin to 
        stir. Picard gets to his feet fast, but weakly.
