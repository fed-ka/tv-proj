Two dozen KINDGERGARTNERS listen to their teacher, MS.
BERRY. The word "Work" is on the blackboard.
MS. BERRY
"Work." Today we're going to
share what our parents do for
work.
QUICK CUTS of a series of five-year olds standing beside
their desks, addressing the class:
JEFF
My dad is a truck driver.
MELINDA
My mommy is a doctor.
CAROLYN
My dad is a librarian and my
mom is a vegetarian.
THEODORE
(with difficulty)
My father is a struck-sher-al-
engine-ear.
CRAIG
-
My mother is an actress. She
works at Denny's.
KELLY
My daddy works at a place
where they make stuff, and my
mommy is a mommy.
ELLIOT
(looking a little
CRAZED)
My father is a postal worker.
The QUICK CUTS end with MAX:
MAX
My mom's a teacher.
As Max starts to sit:
MS. BERRY
And your dad?
MAX
(HESITANT)
My dad? He's . . . a liar.
MS. BERRY
(taken aback)
A liar? I don't think you
mean "a liar."
MAX
Well... he wears a suit and
goes to court and talks to the
judge and--
MS. BERRY
(RELIEVED)
Oh! I see-- you mean he's a
lawyer.
Max shrugs.
FLETCHER REID, early 30's, stands before the JUDGE. His
manner is utterly genuine and convincing.
FLETCHER
A dark street. . . a stormy
night... two desperate men
struggle... one man is taken
to the hospital, the other to
ja il. The prosecutor wants
you to believe this is an
open-and-shut case of a poor
man, brutally victimized.
He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Well, for once I agree with
t he prosecutor. This is an
open-and shut case -- but the
true victim is my client.
Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Put yourself in his shoes for
a moment--walking home from
church, alone, in a
frightening part of the
suburbs.
As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEM
OUT:
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
You're nervous, timid, looking
over your shoulder -- when
suddenly, you encounter him--
(pointing at the
old man)
pouncing from the shadows.
You quiver in fear. The
streetlight flashes on
something shiny in his hand--
a knife?
Suddenly Fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a
weapon. The jurors RECOIL.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
And in that terrifying instant
you do what any respectable
citizen would -- you defend
y ou rse lf. Only after you
shatter his arm and collarbone
do you realize it's all a
mistake... the man was merely
walking away from an ATM
machine, the apparent flash of
metal caused by his bank card.
He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
(CONCERNED)
As you stand over his
crumpled, though potentially
still-dangerous form, your
he art goes out to him. You
want to help. First, you
gather up the many bills he
dropped, to stop them from
bl owi ng away. Second, in an
effort to get the name and
number of someone to notify,
you take his wallet. Finally,
you leap into the man's Lexus
to head for assistance, when
suddenly a police car speeds
up. You breathe a sigh of
relief: "Someone to look -after
the injured man! Oh joy!"
But do the police applaud your
initiative? Do they hail your
heroism? No-- they arrest you
and throw you in the slammer!
He walks along the jury box:
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
 And why? Why does the State
turn its massive power against
this individual?
(takes an
IMPRESSIVE
moment, then
answers his own
QUESTION:)
Discrimination,
(to a black
JUROR)
But this time it's not based
on race.
(to a female
JUROR)
Not based on gender.
(to a man wearing
a crucifix)
Not based on religion,
(to a heavy set
JUROR)
No--this time it's
discrimination based on size!
. I know what the prosecution
wants you to think - - i t ' s
always the big guy's fault.
Is that what we've come to as
a society -- persecuting
people because they're large?
Fletcher points accusingly at the opposition.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Shame on you, Mister
Prosecutor! Shame on you!
(turning back to
JURY)
The state is trying to
barbeque my client on the spit
of Justice. Only you can douse
the flames. The decision is
your s. And please...don't let
your emotions run away with
y ou . The fact that my client
is a family man, raising his
sons alone after the tragic
death of their mother, has
absolutely no bearing on this
case.
In the front row we see two sad-faced YOUNG CHILDREN.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Instead, let cold reason be
your guide as you decide the
fate of this church-going,
orphan-rasing widower!
Fletcher returns to his seat. Jurors, dab their eyes.
.
Audrey enters, shuts the blinds.
FLETCHER
T o Stanford? Overnight? Does
this mean you two are...
(cringes, can't
say the words)
AUDREY
I've been seeing him seven
months, what do you think?
FLETGHER
I was hoping that after being
married to me, you'd have no
more strength left.
AUDREY
. Well you have to remember when
we were married, I wasn't
having sex nearly as often as
you were.
FLETCHER
MEDIC!! I've been hit.
/-
Fletcher is driving, Max beside him.
MAX
Dad, are we really going to go
to wrestling?
FLETCHER
Absolutely, Maxattacker. We
just have to stop by the
office for one minute.
Max SIGHS. He's heard this before.
Fletcher grabs The Daily Journal, paying for it with a
HANDFUL OF CHANGE. His son takes this in.
On their way to the elevators Fletcher and Max pass PHILIP,
a dweebish bore.
PHILIP
Fletcher!
FLETCHER
Philip!
PHILIP
And this must be Max!
FLETCHER
(trying to brush
him off)
. Yes. Yes it is. Well, it was
good seeing you--
Fletcher starts off with Max, when Philip calls after him.
PHILIP
You know, Ethel and I had a
blast at our last little get-
together.
FLETCHER
Oh, me too. I can never get
enough of charades. We'll
have to do it again sometime.
Fletcher heads into an open elevator... only to find the
door's closing impededby Philip's foot.
PHILIP
When?
FLETCHER
Soon.
The door again begins to close... when Philip stops it.
PHILIP
How 'bout tonight?
FLETCHER
Not that soon. I'm taking Max
to see wrestling--
PHILIP
We love wrestling.
We could--
FLETCHER
I don't think so. See, Max is
really shy around strangers.
Max looks up at Fletcher.
He isn't.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Tell you what -- give me your
card as a reminder. I'll call
y o u . Soon. Promise.
PHILIP
Great!
Philip hands him his card just as the door closes.
Max watches as his father TEARS PHILIP'S CARD IN TWO.
The receptionist, JANE, greets them. Jane has an ODD,
UNATTRACTIVE HAIRDO. A large GIFT BASKET is on her desk.
JANE
Hi, Mr. Reid.
(indicates, her
HAIR)
What do you think?
FLETCHER
Fabulous! I love it.
(indicates the

BASKET)
What's this?
JANE
I don't know who sent it. But
it's for Mr. Allan. It's his
anniversary.
FLETCHER
Ah... The Partnership
Committee meeting still
scheduled for Friday?
JANE
(as she goes)
Yep...
Fletcher quickly removes a gift card from his pocket,
scribbles on it, puts it in place of the one already there
MAX
What are you doing?
FLETCHER
Oh, I'm... fixing the card,
(shows him the
old card)
Look, they spelled Mr. Allan's
name wrong. Have an apple.
...Where a troubled FRED RAND is talking to MIRANDA, a
beautiful, steely partner.
FRED
I can't do it.
M IRANDA
Fred, it's your duty to
present the strongest case
possible.
FRED
The strongest case possible,
consistent with the truth.
MIRANDA
Let the Judge decide what's
true. That's what he gets
paid for. You get paid to
win.
FRED
If you insist on my taking it
to trial, I'll represent Mrs.
Cole aggressively and
ethically. But, Miranda -- I
won't lie.
Miranda looks out her window, calculating.
MIRANDA
Then we'll just have to find
someone who'will.
Fletcher strides through the hallway with Max, calling out
GREETINGS to his colleagues.
FLETCHER
Hey, Pete! Great tie!
.
Max looks at PETE, -whose fashion-disaster tie startles him.
FLETCHER
Thomas--looks like you're
losin' weight.
THOMAS glances up from a file. Max notes that he's
corpulent.
THOMAS
Gained three pounds.
FLETCHER
(wedging past
HIM)
On you, it works.

Fletcher arrives at his office. WE MEET his secretary, the
fiftyish, .worldly-wise and world-weary GRETA.
GRETA '
M ax ! What's new?
.MAX
Well. . . it's my birthday
tomo rrow. We're having a
party and everything.
Flet cher's EYES WIDEN. He has clearly forgotten.
GRE TA
I'm sure your dad'11 give you
something wonderful.
Fletcher tries to wave her off, awkwardly stopping when Max
turns to him.
.
MAX
Yeah?
FLETCHER
Oh, yeah. You're going to
love it. Uh, why don't you
play in my office for a
minute? Fax something, sue
someone, have a good time.
We'll be leaving in a second.
Max heads into the office. Fletcher closes the door behind
him turning it into a silly, two-handed wave.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Damn!
I completely forgot.
GRETA
Oh, there's a surprise.
Greta produces a wrapped GIFT.
FLETCHER
You're a saint. I should get
you something.
GRETA
You did.
She holds up another, smaller package.
FLETCHER
Ah. Well, I always do the
classy thing. Any calls?

She hands him a stack of mail.
GRETA
. Let's see.. .

(CHECKING
MESSAGES)
Judge Patterson's clerk. He
needs your filing.
FLETCHER
Tell him it's in the mail.
GRETA
(jotting down a
NOTE)
Right. You'll do it next
week. Mr. McKinley phoned,
questioning that fourteen
hours you billed on Christinas
Eve.
FLETCHER
Write him a long, explanatory
letter. Then bill him for the
letter.
GRETA
(jotting down a
. note).
..
Done. Your mother called.
FLETCHER
I ' m on vacation.
GRETA
This is your fifth week.
.

.
FLETCHER
It's a long vacation.
GRETA
(jotting down a
NOTE)
"Break mother's heart." Done.
And that's it, except
Miranda's looking for you.
FLETCHER
(checking watch)
As if I don't have anything
better to do than bow and
scrape at her royal perfumed
p artner feet. Tell her I'm in
court.
GRETA
Court's closed.
FLETCHER
Tell her I broke my leg and
had to be shot.
GRETA
(WHISPERS)
Why don't you tell her
yourself?
As Miranda approaches, Fletcher switches gears in an
INSTANT:
FLETCHER
--And then send out a notice
of judgement on my win today!
GRETA
(DRY)
I'll get right on it.
Fletcher turns -- and pretends to be surprised.
FLETCHER
Miranda! I didn't see you.
Hey, you look lovely, today.
Here, I bought you a gift.
He grabs Greta's gift and hands it to Miranda.
MIRANDA
Thanks. I heard about your
victory today. You're making
quite an impression on the
partnership committee.
FLETCHER
(FEIGNING
PUZZLEMENT;
THEN)
Oh, that's right. You folks
are meeting again soon.
"Allan, Stewart, Konigsberg,
and Ried." There's something
about the rhythm of fours.
It's like a full measure.
Well, anyway, I've got a
client waiting in my office--
MIRANDA .
Actually, something important
h as come up. You're not busy
tonight, are you?
Before Fletcher answers, we:
CUT TO:
A sad Max sits on Fletcher's big sofa. His heart sinks
further when Fletcher enters. . . carrying two boxes of
documents.
MAX
We're not going, are we?
FLETCHER
Of course we are. A promise
i s a promise. We are gonna
see wrestling or my name isn't
Fletcher T. Reid.
FLETCHER
(to wrestler)
Could you hand me that?
(the wrestler
DOES)
Thank you.
(without looking
UP)
We are having some fun, eh
Maxer?
PUSH IN on Max; he isn't.
Jerry paces. Audrey is on the phone, waiting.
She notices
Jerry pacing.
AUDREY
Are you alright?
JERRY
Uh, yeah, just, uh... how long
are you gonna be on the phone?
AUDREY
I just wanted to say good-
night to Max, but he must
still be out with Fletcher,
(hangs up)
JERRY
(SUDDENLY)
Will you marry me?
She's SHOCKED.
I
AUDREY
Uh...would I . . . ? What did you
say?
JERRY
(NERVOUS)
I proposed, I . . . Look, I know
this Boston thing is a great
opportunity, good job,
mo ney .. . everything. But I
started to think about being
three thousand miles away from
you and Max. And I didn't
like it. I-- Look, I know
it's a lot to ask, to move and
everything, but I . . . . I love
you. I love your son.
Will
you marry me?
She stares at him, excited, but nervous.
Fletcher types on his computer.
He's been up all night.
He leans back, rubs his eyes. When he opens them he sees
Max standing there in pajamas. Fletcher SMILES.
FLETCHER
Max Factor... Happy birthday.
How old are you today?
T h ir t y ? Forty?
MAX
Five.
FLETCHER
Well, you've held up well. I
only wish there was some way
to commemorate such an
occasion, some small symbol to
mark this day, like....
Fletcher produces --
FLETCHER
. . . A present! .
Max eyes it with wonder.
MAX
What is it?
FLETCHER
(no idea)
It's... it's.
(it hits him)
a surprise.
Max knows his father doesn't have a clue but he rips the
box open, revealing, a BASEBALL, GLOVE, DODGER'S CAP, and
FULL MAJOR LEAGUE STYLE UNIFORM.
MAX
Baseball stuff!
_J
FLETCHER
Baseball stuff.
MAX
(hugging his dad)
Will you play catch with me?
FLETCHER
'
:
Absorootentootenlutely.
Max beams.
FLETCHER
Tonight. After your party,
you have my word on it.
Max nods sadly as Fletcher turns back to his work.
Miranda, and Fletcher's new client, VIRGINIA COLE, an
alluring woman in her early thirties/ review the document
he spent the previousnight putting together.
VIRGINIA
This is good. This is really
smart.
FLETCHER
Thank you.
VIRGINIA
Only i t ' s . . . Like not true.
Every word of it is a lie.
Fletcher and Miranda exchange glances.
VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
I mean... isn't that a
problem?
FLETCHER
Mrs. Cole, the only problem
here is that after you've
provided years of faithful
service and loving support, of
raising his children -- They
are his?
VIRGINIA
H m ? Oh yeah. One for sure.
FLETCHER
After all that, your husband
wants to deny you a fair share
of the marital assets based on
one single act of
]
INDISCRETION--
VIRGINIA
Seven.
FLETCHER
Hm?
VIRGINIA
Seven single acts of
indiscretion.
FLETCHER
--Seven acts of indiscretion,
only one of which he has any
evidence of, and all of which
he himself is responsible, for.
VIRGINIA
He is?
FLETCHER
Mrs. Cole, I stayed up all
night last night studying your
c ase. Not just your case...
b ut you. And, by now, I feel
I know you. You are the
victim here. The wife of a
cold, distant businessman.
Starved for affection, driven
into the arms of another man--
VIRGINIA
Seven.
FLETCHER
(not missing a
BEAT)
--Seven .other men. You're not
trying to deny him what is
r ig htf ull y his. All you're
insisting on is what is
r ig htf ull y yours. And maybe
an idgy-smidgy bit more. I
think you're bending over
backwards.
VIRGINIA
Well, I did agree to give him
j oint custody of the kids...
(to Miranda)
He's always been a good
father.
FLETCHER
And you've always been a good
wife.
VIRGINIA
(getting worked
UP)
Yeah. . .
FLETCHER
There's such a thing as being
t oo nice. That's why you need
aggr essive representation. To
show the court that there is
more than one side to this
st ory. All I'm asking is the
opportunity to see that
justice is done on your
behalf.
(takes her hand)
Will you give me that
opportunity?
He stares into her eyes. A moment, then...
VIRGINIA
Yes! I ' m tired of getting
kicked around.
FLETCHER
Good for you!
VIRGINIA
Thank you, Mr. Reid. I ' m so
grateful I have an attorney I
can trust.
S he gives him a HUG and momentarily grabs his ass. With a
farewell nod to Miranda, she leaves.
Miranda turns, smiles at Fletcher, then shuts the door.
She moves in on him.
MIRANDA
You're good. You're really
good.
FLETCHER
Oh, pshaw.
(pronounces it
with the "p")
She picks a piece of lint off.his jacket.
MIRANDA
N o, I mean it. The Cole case
is worth a truckload of money
to this firm, not to mention
the press it's going to
g en er at e . You win this case
and I guarantee you'll make
partner.
(STRAIGHTENING
his tie)
Actually, how would you like
to make a partner right now?
FLETCHER
Excuse me?
She grabs his lapels and pulls him in for a deep KISS.
INT, AUDREY AND MAX'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
A PARTY in progress, KINDERGARTNERS being entertained by a
MAN in a clown suit and clown make-up.
CLOWN
(SINGING)
Captain Fuzzy is my name,
Making children happy is my
game,
With a shake and a juggle,
And a big belt buckle,
You'll all be glad I came. '
He flops down on his back causing something in his pants to
HONK. Audrey and Jerry watch.
AUDREY
(indicating the
CLOWN)
What do you think?
JERRY
Well, if you don't hire your
brother, who will?
.
She heads into...

JERRY
They called me again from
B oston. They really want me
there tomorrow.
AUDREY
. . . I can't go to Boston.
JERRY
How come?
AUDREY
Max.
JERRY
He'll love it there.
AUDREY
It's Fletcher.
JERRY
Fletcher?
AUDREY
I can't move Max three
thousand miles away from his
father.
JERRY
Audrey, I have never said a
bad word about your ex --
AUDREY
I know.
JERRY
But how much responsibility
does Fletcher take for Max,
now? He'd never come over if
you didn't remind him.
AUDREY
I know. But if they're three
thousand miles apart they'll
never see each other.
Fletcher will never come to
Boston and how can I send Max
cross-country to him?
.JERRY
So because your ex-husband is
unreliable, we can't-'-
AUDREY
I know, it's not logical, it's
emotional. I'm sorry.
Pause.
JERRY
I still want to marry you.
AUDREY
Are you sure?
Jerry picks up the PHONE, pulls out a piece of paper,
dials.
JERRY
(into phone)
Mr. Crisitelli, Jerry
She!ton... I hope I'm not
calling too late... Mr.
Crisitelli, I'm afraid I have
to turn down your offer..'. So
am I . . . Well, I've fallen in
love with this beautiful woman
in L.A. and she doesn't want
to leave and I won't leave
without her... Well, thank you
very much... Yes, good-bye.
(hangs up)
He wasn't there, but that's
1
the speech I would've made.
She smiles and KISSES him.
The PHONE RINGS.
Audrey
answers.
AUDREY
Hello...
INTERCUT WITH:
A UDREY
Fletcher, where are you?
We're getting ready to cut the
cake.
FLETCHER
Urn, actually, something has
come up. A problem on a new
caaa--
.
Miranda bites one of Fletcher's nipples.
F LET CHE R
A-h-h-h-!
AUDREY
What happened?
FLETCHER
Nothing. I just nailed my
knee into the desk... Listen,
I'm really sorry I can't 'make
it.
AUDREY
Max is going to be so
disappointed.
FLETCHER
I'll make it up to him, I
promise. I'll pick him up
from school tomorrow, okay?
AUDREY
Do you want me to put him on
the phone?
Miranda starts "reeling in" the phone cord.
FLETCHER
Ah, no.
I have to go.
AUDREY
Right.
ANGRILY, she hangs up. Fletcher stares UNHAPPILY at the
phone, before Miranda THROWS HIM BACK ONTO THE COUCH.
WE PAN DOWN from banners reading HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAX!. . . to
a room full of guests... to a desultory five-year-old.
Audrey finishes lighting the candles on the homemade cake.
AUDREY
All right, birthday boy, make
a wish.
Max doesn't respond.
AUDREY (CONT'D)
C'mon, honey. It can be
anything-- whatever you want
most in the world.
When he .doesn't respond, she leans down to him..
AUDREY (CONT'D)
Max, your dad is sorry. He
had to work.
MAX
He said he was coming. He
promised.
AUDREY
Yes, well, he... promises
he'll see you tomorrow.
Max doesn't believe it.
<
He turns his full attention to the candles on the cake.
In
VOICE OVER we hear what she does not.
MAX (V.O.)
I wish, for just one day, Dad
couldn't tell a lie.
He takes a breath --and blows out all the candles. A
strange WIND blows the drapes and the wisp of smoke up, up,
up... to the clock on the wall. It's 9:15.
CUT TO:
A clock on a wall.
It's 9:15'. We are--
PAN around Miranda's office, where the displaced sofa is
adorned with Fletcher's shoes...
To the credenza, where Fletcher's pants hang...
To the lamp, where Fletcher's shorts swing...
To the desk, where a ravished Miranda lies next to
Fletcher. Superbly confident of the answer, she asks--
MIRANDA
S o . . . was it good for you?
Without thinking, Fletcher responds in the most astonishing
way possible-- he TELLS THE TRUTH.
FLETCHER
I've had better.
Miranda turns to him in disbelief -- but it's nothing
compared to the LOOK OF SHOCK on Fletcher's face.
The door opens -- and the naked Fletcher is forcefully
kicked out. He goes TUMBLING over a desk as a RAIN OF
CLOTHES follow.
The door SLAMS SHUT again, leaving him without his pants.
A CLEANING LADY stares at him in shock, then takes her
broom, aims for his crotch, SWINGS.and. . .
An alarm CLOCK RINGS. Fletcher BOLTS UP in bed. With
regret and wonder he remembers:
FLETCHER
"I've had better?"
Fletcher brushes his teeth, looks up at his reflection in
the mirror, mouth foaming.
FLETCHER
"I've had better?!"
Dressed for work, Fletcher waits for the elevator.
FLETCHER
(laughing it off)
"I've had better?"
I t arrives. He steps in.
The elevator is empty, except for Fletcher... and a
beautiful young WOMAN.
FLETCHER
New in the building?
MODEL
I just moved in Monday.
FLETCHER
Ah. Well, you must allow me
to give you the grand tour.
MODEL
(SHE'S
INTERESTED)
O h? Do you do that for all
the new tenants?
FLETCHER
No. Just the ones I want to
bang like a drum.
Fletcher's face REGISTERS extreme SHOCK and...
We HEAR a SMACK off camera and a PING as the elevator door
opens. The model storms off and A STUNNED Fletcher steps
out, rubbing his freshly slapped face.
A winded Fletcher joins Virginia at the respondent's table,
VIRGINIA
You look like you're having a
rough morning.
FLETCHER
I've had better.
He WINCES as he recognizes the words. Then, an extremely
wealthy, respectable industrialist, RICHARD COLE enters
with his attorney, DANA APPLETON, young, brisk, confident.
DANA
Good morning, Fletcher.
FLETCHER
Dana.
"
RICHARD
All right, Virginia, how much
will it take to put an end to
this?
FLETCHER
Fifty per cent of your estate.
Richard is SHOCKED.
DANA
Fifty per cent? With a pre-
nup and proof of adultery?
What's your case?
FLETCHER
Our case is simply this. . .
Fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her -- but he CAN'T
GET THE WORDS OUT. He tries to FORCE OUT SOUNDS, but
succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land.
DANA
.
Interesting, though based on
your track record, I expected
a little more.
Nearing panic, Fletcher whirls to his BRIEFCASE and grabs
the brief.
FLETCHER
..
Wa it! Wait!
I've got it in
writing!
But when Dana tries to take the document, the astonished
Fletcher finds himself PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO RELEASE IT.
DANA
Let go!
FLETCHER
I'm trying!
He INVOLUNTARILY snatches the document away and IT PULLS
HIM to a nearby TRASH CAN where he throws it out.
At this moment the BAILIFF calls.
BAILIFF
All rise for the Honorable
Judge William Stevens.
DANA
Very funny, Fletcher. You
want to play hardball, I'm
game.
JUDGE STEVENS takes the bench.
JUDGE STEVENS
Calling case BA 09395, Richard
Cole versus Virginia Cole.
How're we doing this morning,
counsel?
DANA
Fine, thank you.
JUDGE STEVENS
And you, Mr. Reid?
FLETCHER
Well, I'm a little upset about
a bad sexual episode I had
last night--
Fletcher screeches to a standstill, suddenly aware of what
he just said. After an awkward silence--
JUDGE STEVENS
(DRYLY)
Well, you're still young.
It'll happen more and more.
In the meantime, what do you
say we get. down to business?
First, Mr. Reid, I see that
your client was previously
represented by Mr. Rand of
your office.
FLETCHER
Yes, Your Honor.
JUDGE STEVENS
I take it you're seeking to
substitute in as counsel?
FLETCHER
Yes, Your Honor.
JUDGE STEVENS
Fine , fine. And for the
record, the reason is?
FLETCHER
Mr. Rand had severe ethical
objections to my client's
case.
Fletcher is incredulous. Somehow his greatest asset in the
world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy.
JUDGE STEVENS
I take it you don't share the
same ethical objections, Mr.
Reid?
FLETCHER
I have lower standards, Your
Honor.
JUDGE STEVENS
I see. Well, if Mrs. Cole
wants the substitution of
counsel, I'll allow it. Is
that what you want, Mrs. Cole?
Virginia looks to the judge, then to Fletcher, whose
unorthodox syle seemed so brilliant earlier.
VIRGINIA
(UNSURE)
Yes?
JUDGE STEVENS
Fine.
VIRGINIA
(aside, to
FLETCHER)
What are you doing?
FLETCHER
(WORRIED)
.
I don't know.
(to judge, with
SOME
DESPERATION)
Your Honor, I ' d like a
continuance!
JUDGE STEVENS "
This case has already been
delayed several times, Mr.
Reid.
FLETCHER
I realize that, Your Honor,
but I ' d really, really, really
like a continuance.
JUDGE STEVENS
I'll have to hear good cause,
counselor. What's the
problem?
FLETCHER'S P.O.V.
The ROOM begins to SPIN slowly -- then faster -- then
faster -- until we wind up squarely on --
FLETCHER'S FACE
FLETCHER
I can't lie!
JUDGE STEVENS
(IMPATIENT)
Commendable, Mr. Reid, but I'm
still waiting for the good
caus e. Now, do you have it or
. not?
'
FLETCHER
(TRUTHFUL)
Not.
JUDGE STEVENS
Motion for a continuance
denied. Is there any chance
of a settlement in this case?
DANA
I don't think so, Your Honor.
Mr. Reid made it abundantly
clear that the last thing in
the world he wanted was to --
FLETCHER
(DESPERATE)
SETTLE! SETTLE! SETTLE!
Dana and Mr. Cole look at Fletcher with surprise.
JUDGE STEVENS
There appears to have been a
change in strategy. Let's go
to my chambers and negotiate.
He BANGS the gavel.
Dana and an apprehensive Fletcher sit before the judge
DANA
Your Honor, under the terms of
the prenuptual agreement, if
Mrs. Cole commits adultery,
she is entitled to nothing.
We have in our possession an
audiotape made by a licensed
private investigator of an
explicit act of sexual
congress with a man who is not
her husband.
JUDGE STEVENS
Sounds pretty damning, Mr.
Reid.
FLETCHER
It certainly does.
DANA
However, my client has no
desire to see his ex-wife
destitute. Against my advice,
he's willing to offer her a
cash settlement of.two point
four million dollars.
JUDGE STEVENS
Two four seems like a pretty
fair offer, Mr. Reid.
FLETCHER
Fantastically fair.
Phenominally fair. In fact,
I'd say beyond fair, bordering
on stupid.
Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness
refreshing.
JUDGE STEVENS
What are you suggesting, Mr.
Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's
willingness to proffer such an
offer betrays a lack of faith
in her position?
FLETCHER
(utterly sincere)
No, not at all. She's got my
client dead to rights. When
attorneys go to sleep at
night, they dream of having a
case as strong as hers.
DANA
Can the sarcasm, Reid. All
right, I admit it -- I've seen
you make even the lamest case
fly. But this time I have
you. Even Clarence Darrow
couldn't explain this away.
She brandishes the audiotape.
JUDGE SAMIOAN
Wel l, Mr. Reid? without a
dynamite explanation, I'd say
you're dead in the water.
How's you client's story?
FLETCHER
The best that money can buy,
Y o u r Honor.

JUDGE STEVENS
Strong corroborating evidence?
FLETCHER
We have evidence that you are
not going to-believe.
Despite herself, Dana is beginning to look worried.
JUDGE STEVENS
You're pretty confident how
this trial is going to come
out, eh, Mr. Reid?
FLETCHER
(hopeless) .
"Confident" is too weak a
word, Your Honor. I am
certain what will happen if I
take this puppy to trial. The
verdict will be a stunning,
humiliating defeat that will
cut a spectacularly promising
legal career off at the knees.
Fletcher is referring to himself, of course, but Dana
thinks he's speaking about her. She buckles.
DANA
All right! Double the offer!
Four point eight! And not a
penny more.
(venomous, to
FLETCHER)
Bastard!
She storms out, leaving an astounded Fletcher behind.
JUDGE STEVENS
You are some negotiator, Mr.
Reid. If your client has half
a brain, she'll jump at the
offer.
CUT TO:
VIRGINIA
No!
We are --
Fletcher has joined Virginia at the respondent's table
FLETCHER
No? ! Mrs. Cole, this offer
was a miracle. I'm talking
about a walking-on-water,
Lazarus-rising-from-the-dead,
FIND-NO-LINE-AT-THE-FRIGGIN'-
DMV miracle! You've gone from
two point four to four point
eight million in...
(checks his
WATCH)
four minutes. Think of it
this way -- now you're getting
paid seven hundred thou per
schtupp!



VIRGINIA
Mr. Reid, you convinced me
yesterday -- I'm the victim
here, starved for affection,
driven into the arms of
another man--
FLETCHER
Seven!

VIRGINIA
-- Seven other men. With the
story you came up with, I
don't think I can lose. I
want to proceed.
FLETCHER
Mrs. Cole, you don't
.
understand, I--
But before Fletcher can finish, the judge enters.
JUDGE STEVENS
Well , Mr. Reid. Do we have a
settlement?
Fletcher looks pleadingly at his client, but she is firm.
He shakes his head unhappily. The judge is irritated.
JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)
Th ere' s no settlement. Trial
to start at one-thirty sharp.
He BANGS the gavel. Fletcher emits an involuntary whimper.
DA ZED, Fletcher makes his way down the hall. Jane comes
toward him wearing a hairstyle that resembles a nest. He
tries to avoid her, but...
JANE
What do you think?
FLETCHER .
I think you need help.
HORRIFI ED, Fletcher hurries on. The heavyset Thomas
ambulates in his way.

-

THOMAS
What's shakin', Fletcher?
FLETCHER
Your cellulite, Tubster.
The now panicked Fletcher breaks into a run, passing Fred.
FRED
Hiy a, Fletcher. How's the
Cole case going?
FLETCHER
(not stopping)
'Straight into the crapper, you
wuss, with my career right
behind it.
P
Fletcher is RUNNING NOW, COVERING HIS EARS and SINGING
LOUDLY so as not to hear OTHER EMPLOYEE 'GREETINGS...
FLETC HER
LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA!!
Fletcher speeds past--
 GRETA
Hi, boss. What's happening
WITH--
FLETCHER
DON'T ASK! FOR GOD'S SAKE,
PLEASE DON'T ASK!
-- And races into his office.
I NT . FLETCHER'S OFFICE - MORNING
He leans against the door, trying to catch his breath.

FLETCHER,
(PACING)
Do n't panic. You can beat
this -- it's all a matter of
willpower.
He dives for his desk and rifles through it.
FL ET CH ER
A test. . . Something small...
Aha!
He holds up a BLUE PEN.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Red.
Red. All right. Focus,
(with great
DELIBERATION)
The color of this pen is  r--.
R--. R--! The color of this
pen is--blue! AAAAHH!
(burying his
HEAD)
Ahhhh! One' tiny lie and I
can't say it!!
(suddenly sitting
UP)
' I'll write.it!
He takes a sheet of PAPER, his pen and writes "This pen
i s . . . " He tries to write an "R" but can't. He STRAINS.
S TR AIN S HARDER. He's out of his chair, on the desk. His
feet KICK OVER OBJECTS on the shelves'behind him. He
finally forces pen to paper. He looks down where he wrote
INADVERTENTLY:
"This pen is blue."
F LE TC HE R
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! ! ! !
Greta enters to find--
FLETCHER running around the office, shaking the blue pen in
the air.
GRETA
Boss, what's wrong?
FLETCHER
. The pen is blue!! The pen is
.
b l u e ! ! The GODDAMN PEN IS
BLUE !!!
Almost weeping, he collapses into a chair. A moment --
then Greta tentatively offers him a red pen.
GRETA
Red?
FLETCHER
(BITTER)
Oh, that's easy for you to
say?!
GRETA
Are you all right?
FLETCHER
(getting up)
I have to go home.
GRETA
Home? Was the case settled?
FLETCHER
No. I have to be in court at
one-thirty.
GRETA
Well, then how can you.go
home?
FLETCHER
I don't know, I don't know!!!
GRETA
Okay.
(walking on
EGGSHELLS)
Before I forget -- Rubin and
Dun n called. They want to
know where the Darvis
settlement offer stands.
FLETCHER
I only proposed a settlement
t o dick with them. I never
had any intention of going
th ro ug h with it.
.
Not certain why her boss would .shoot himself in the foot,
Greta nonetheless jots down his remarks.
GRETA
'...dick with them." Okay.
Your accountant, Philip,
called to remind you about
getting together. .
FLETCHER
I'd rather shave my ass and
sit in vinegar..
GRETA
(jotting down a
NOTE)
Got it. And your mother
called again. Are you still
on vacation?
FLETCHER
(EMPHATICALLY
nodding "yes")
No.
GRETA
So then you're here?
FLETCHER
(EMPHATICALLY
shaking his head
"NO")
Yes.
GRETA
I ' m having a little trouble
following you. what do I say
to your mom?
FLETCHER
(RESIGNED)
Tell her I'm a thoughtless son
who'd rather spend ten hours
clogging the wheels of justice
than five minutes talking to
her-- but only if she asks.
You.might also add that she
deserves better, though I hope
to God you don't.
GRETA
Thanks for clearing that up.
And that's it, except your ex
called and asked when you were
cowing over to see your son.
FLETCHER
(REMEMBERS)
OHH! I'M SUCH A SHIT!!
He reacts, particularly stunned by this truth.
Audrey is driving Max, who wears his new baseball uniform
when her cellular PHONE RINGS. She picks it up.
We INTERCUT between car and office.
FLETCHER
AUDREY--
AUDREY'
Hey, Fletcher. T was
wondering if you were going to
still pick up Max after school
today.
FLETCHER
I don't think I can. I had a
case I was certain would
settle and it didn't. I have
to go to trial this afternoon,
God help me.
AUDREY
(not believing
HIM)
Right.
FLETCHER
It's true... I really do want
to see Max, today.
Fletcher considers what he just said, realizes it is true.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
How about that. I really do.
AUDREY
(CYNICALLY)
But things keep coming up at
the last minute.
FLETCHER
Yes, but-this time it's
different.
AUDREY
I see. And how is that?
.

FLETCHER
( he walked into
IT)
This time I'm telling the
truth.
AUDREY
But last night you weren't?
FLETCHER
No.
AUDREY
What were you doing?
FLETCHER
Having sex.
AUDREY
(barely holding
her temper),
It must have been with someone
very "special."
FLETCHER
No. It was with someone I
don't even like. But I
thought it would help my
career and at the moment that
seemed more important than
attending my son's birthday!
A U D R EY
M y God!!
She SLAMS DOWN the phone.
Fletcher BANGS THE PHONE against his head in frustration! '.
FLETCHER
A H H H H H H ! ! I WHAT IS WRONG WITH
ME I ! I
E X T . FULGHAM KINDERGARTEN - MORNING
The Volvo parks.
Audrey gets out. She leans over to say good-bye to her
son.
,
.
MAX
Is dad picking me up?
AUDREY
No, I'm sorry, Max. He can't
make it. I will. I'll work
it out.
Max is disappointed.
MAX
I guess my wish didn't come 
true.
AUDREY
What wish?
MAX
I wished that, for just one
day, Dad couldn't tell a lie.
Max heads toward his teacher. Audrey is deeply moved.
He's dialing the phone.
FLETCHER
Answer, answer, answer...
INTERCUT WITH AUDREY'S CAR
AUDREY
Hello.
FLETCHER
Audrey, let me explain.
Something has happened to me--
AUDREY
Fletcher, something else is
about to happen to you.
FLETCHER.
What do you mean?
AUDREY
Max and I are moving to
Boston.
FLETCHER
What?!
AUDREY
Jerry asked me to marry him.
He wants Max and I to fly with
him this weekend to pick out a
house. And I'm going to go.
God knows I don't have any
reason to stay here.
FLETCHER
(panicking)
.
Wait, you can't move! If you
take Max away... I'll
practically never see him.
AUDREY
Well then you'll have pretty
much the same relationship you
have with him now.
FLETCHER
Audrey, please.... Is this
because of what I just said on
the phone?
AUDREY
That was the straw and this is
the camel's back saying
goodbye.
FLETCHER
Where are you?
AUDREY
Heading home.
FLETCHER
When you gee there, stay
there. I'll be right over.
We have to talk.
AUDREY
FLETCHER--
FLETCHER
I'll be right- there!
He hangs up and heads for the door.
It opens and Miranda
enters.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Aaaah!
MIRANDA
Flet cher. Fletcher, Fletcher,
Fletcher. I must confess--
after last night's incident, I
was. . . hurt. So hurt. I was
tempted to do whatever little
things lie in my power to
scuttle your chances of making
partner.
Fletcher is FRIGHTENED.
MIRANDA (CONT'D)
But then I thought, "No,
that 's not fair. Fletcher
didn't mean to insult me."
(STRAIGHTENING
his tie)
"It was just some massive,
boneheaded misunderstanding,
and Fletcher is very, very
sorry."
Fletcher smiles.
It looks like he's off the hook, until--
MIRANDA (CONT'D)
Isn't that right, Fletcher?
FLETCHER
(in agony)
Uh -- not really, no.
MIRANDA
(stunned, angry)
N o ? No?! What are you
sayi ng? Have you no respect
for me?!
FLETCHER
None, whatsoever. I mean, I ' d
like to respect you, and if it
weren't for your mistreatment
of the associates, your
rudeness to the staff, and the
fact that your work sucks, I
would.
M IRANDA
But -- what about last night?
FLETCHER
I was afraid you wouldn't
support my partnership if I
turned you down. Plus, I have
an immature need for sexual
conquests.
W e HEAR A SMACK! The door flies opens -- and a furious
Miranda stalks off.

Fletcher rubs his freshly SLAPPED FACi..
Fletcher speeds away. He pulls the blue pen from his
pocket.
FLETCHER
Gotta focus. . . gotta focus.
He's so preoccupied that he speeds through a crosswalk and
almost hits an OLD MAN.
FLETCHER
The color of the pen is --
re d !
.
But he hasn't regained the ability to lie -- he's referring
to the RED LIGHT he just ran, nearly colliding with a
truck. The DRIVER screams:
DRIVER
What's your problem, schmuck?!
FLETCHER
(the truth)
I ' m an inconsiderate prick!
Fletcher once again focuses on the blue pen.
FLETCHER (CON "ID)
C'mon, you can do this! The
color of the pen is -- RED!
This time he's referring to the flashing red light of a
POLICE CAR in his rearview mirror.
FLETC HER
S hi t !!
Fletcher pulls over. A POLICE OFFICER strolls up.
POLICE OFFICER
Do you know why I stopped you?
FLETCHER
Depends on how long you were
following me.
POLICE OFFICER
Why don't we take it from the
top.
FLETCHER

(in agony)
Here goes -- I didn't fasten
my seatbelt, I didn't glance
in my rearview mirror, I
didn't signal when I pulled
away from the curb, I sped, I
followed too closely, I ran a
stop sign, I almost hit :a
Chevy Camaro, I almost hit a
ge ezer, I sped some more, I
failed to yield at a
crosswalk, I changed lanes in
the intersection, I changed
lanes without signalling, and
I changed lanes in the
INTERSECTION-WITHOUT
signalling while running a red
light and speeding.
A long moment.
POLICE OFFICER
May I see your driver's
license?
FLETCHER
No.
POLICE OFFICER
And why is that?
FLETCHER
It's in my other pants.
POLICE OFFICER
I see. And where are your 
other pants?
FLETCHER
Hanging from my boss's
credenza.
POLICE OFFICER
Do you expect me to believe
that?
FLETCHER
No.
POLICE OFFICER
Do you think I'm an idiot?
FLETCHER
Yes -- but that's beside the
point! My license actually is
in my other pants, and they
actually were hanging from a
credenzaJ I wouldn't lie to
you! I mean, I would if I
could, but I can't!
POLICE OFFICER
I see. So you ..have no reason
to try and hide your license
from me?
FLETCHER
I didn't say that. I have
other reasons. Seventeen
reasons, to be precise.
(begrudgingly,
off the
officer's look)
Unpaid parking tickets.
(BESEECHINGLY)
Be gentle.
Fletcher marches quickly down the hall, cake box under his
arm.
Ms. Berry's reading a story when Fletcher enters.
Max
brightens.
MAX
Dad!
MS . BERRY
Are you Max's dad? I ' m Ms.
Berry, Max's teacher!
FLETCHER
Hi. Listen, I need to talk to
MAX--
MS. BERRY
Mr. Reid, we were just talking
ab ou t careers. You're a
lawyer, aren't you?
FLETCHER
(WARY)
Yes.
MAX
Mr. Reid it'would be wonderful
for the children to hear
something positive about
lawyers!
FLETCHER
Well, actually-- 
MS. BERRY
Children! .Mr. Reid is going
to tell us what it's like to
be a lawyer.
She leads the kids in APPLAUSE. Fletcher takes center
s tage. The children stare, rapt with attenion.
FLETCHER
Uh, hi. Uh, I'm a lawyer and
I work at a big law firm with
a lot of other lawyers and I
do stuff in a law court.
Thank you.
He starts out.
MS. BERRY
One moment, Mr. Reid. Maybe
some of the children have
QUESTIONS
(hands shoot up)
Jeffrey?
JEFF
What kind of lawyer are you?
FLETCHER
Mostly, I ' m a divorce lawyer.
BILLY
What's that?
FLETCHER
It means if you're daddy left
your mommy, he'd call me.
CRAIG
So what do you do?
FLETCHER
(growing more and
more impatient)
I help people fight over their
money and their children.
THEODORE
Can't they fight without you?
FLETCHER ' "
They could but then J wouldn't
make a living.
JILL
Why would my daddy leave my
mommy?
FLETCHER
To marry a younger woman. To
escape a loveless marriage and
have cheap meaningless sex.
To cling to an illusion of
youth as his body gives way to
sore backs, flat feet, spare
tires, gum disease, hair loss,
liver spots, kidney stones,
clogged arteries, diabetes,
goiter and eventual death.
The kids EYES GO WIDE. A moment, then:
MS. BERRY
(BRIGHTLY)
Well, I think it's time for
fingerpainting.
Fletcher drags himself past Greta's desk. Miranda gives
him the stink-eye. Fletcher doesn't see her.
GRETA
Do you want your messages?
FLETCHER
No.
He goes into his office. Greta is concerned.
She follows
him in, leaving his door open.
Fletcher collapses onto his couch. Greta enters.
GRETA
Are you okay?
FLETCHER
My son hates me.
GRETA
No! He loves you. I've seen
y ou together. You're his
hero.
FLETCHER
O h yeah? Last night at his
birthday party, he made a
wish. That I wouldn't be able
to tell a lie for one whole
day.
GRETA
Kids...
FLETCHER
It came true.
GRETA
What?
FLETCHER
It's true. Didn't it seem odd
to you that I kept telling the
truth all morning?
GRETA
Well, yeah, but...
(INCREDULOUS)
You're telling me that you
can't lie.
FLETCHER
That's right!
I am incapable
of lying.
Miranda is 'eavesdropping.
A wicked gleam in her eye,
GRETA
Just today?
FLETCHER
Apparently until 9:15 tonight.
It's a twenty-four hour curse.
GRETA
Yes, those are going around.
FLETCHER
You don't believe me.
GRETA
Of course not.
FLETCHER
Go ahead. Ask me something
I ' d normally lie about.
She thinks.
GRETA
A ll right. Remember a few
months ago, I wanted a raise--
FLETCHER
(QUICKLY)
Forget it. Let's not do this.
GRETA
-- and the firm wouldn't.give
me one. And I asked you if
you would give it to me out of
your own pocket and you said
the company wouldn't permit it
because it creates jealousy
among the other secretaries?
Was that true or did you just
not want to pony up the dough?
Greta is emptying all her personal effects into boxes.
She's leaving. Fletcher is on the phone and looks very
harras,sed.
FLETCHER
Greta, please...
(into phone)
Yes Judge Stevens, hi!..
Fletcher Reid. I ' m scheduled
to be in your court in half-
an-hour... Judge Stevens, I
badly, badly need a
continuance. . . so I can go
home and stay there the rest
of the day...111? Am I ill?
He wants to say "yes", but he can't.
FLETCHER
In a way.
(covers the
MOUTHPIECE)
Please, lie to him for me.
Greta holds up a framed photograph.
GRETA
I remember when you. bought me
t hi s silver frame. From
Tiffany's.
(QUESTIONING)
. . . Tiffany's?
FLETCHER
Jumbo's House of Junk.
She thrpws it in the trash and keeps packing.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
I'll give you the raise!
GRETA
(gives him the
FINGER)
Here's your raise.
FLETCHER
(into phone)
Hi, Judge Stevens?... Yes, I
know I haven't given you a
reason.
The PHONE RINGS.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
(into phone)
But if you could just do this
for me, I--
The phone won't stop ringing.
.'
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Hold on, please,
(pushes two
BUTTONS)
Hello... Mom!!
The phone flies into the air. He catches it.
FLETCHER {CONT'D)
Mom... Well, I wasn't actually
on vacation... Because I
didn't want to talk to you...
Because you insist on talking
to me about Dad's bowel
movements -- size, color,
frequency... I'll call you
later... No, not really.
He pushes -two more buttons. Then SCREAMS.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Oh dammit! I cut him off! I
cut off the Judge! Greta...
He falls to his knees.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
I'm on my knees in a nine
hundred dollar suit. Don't
leave.
Greta stops.
She seems to consider.
GRETA
A few years ago a friend of
mine had a burglar up on her
roof.
FLETCHER
Yes?
GRETA
..
A burglar. -He fell through
the kitchen skylight and
landed on a cutting board on a
butcher's knife, cutting his
l e g. He sued my friend. The
burglar sued my friend.
Thanks to guys like you-- he
won. My friend had to pay him
six thousand dollars. Is that
justice?
FLETCHER
No. . . but what' s your poijit!
GRETA
My point is, it's hard to get
justice. But this is justice,
(pinches his
CHEEK)
Have a nice day in court,
bubbie.
She leaves.
Fletcher starts to give chase...
FLETCHER
GRETA--
He runs directly into Miranda.
FLETCHER
Aaaah!
Miranda smiles like a cat that's trapped a mouse.
MIRANDA
Ah, Fletcher, so nice to bump
i nto you. Are you busy?
FLETCHER
Extremely.
MIRANDA
Good. Would you follow me,
please?
Highly nervous, Fletcher follows Miranda down the hall.
MIRANDA (CONT'D)
Fletcher, did you know that
the partnership committee is
being headed up by Mr. Allan
himself?
(off his wary
NOD)
Say, you used to work directly
for Mr. Allan, didn't you?
(off his waried
NOD)
Tell me, what do you think of
him?
FLETCHER
(HELPLESS)
He's a pedantic,
pontificating, pretentious
bastard, a belligerent old
fart, a worthless, steaming
pile of cow dung.
MIRANDA
(GRINNING)
How delightful!
She swings open a door, ushering Fletcher into --
The room is filled with ATTORNEYS, including MR. ALLAN,
the founder himself. Fletcher freezes.
MIRANDA
Pardon me for interrupting
your, meeting. Mr. Allan, you
remember Fletcher Reid.

MR. ALLAN
It's good to see you again,
Fletcher. '.
An involuntary WHIMPER from Fletcher.
MIRANDA
Oh, that's right. You used to
work together. .Tell me, what
do you think of Mr. Allah?
Fl etc he r gulps. This is it. His career is history. He's
trying to hold it back, but--
MIRANDA
I said... What do you think of
Mr. Allan?
FLETCHER
.
He's a pedantic,
pontificating, pretentious
bastard, a belligerent old
fart, a worthless, steaming
pile of cow dung.
DE AN SILENCE. Then --Mr. Allan bursts into raucous
LAUGHTER. He is joined by everyone except Miranda, who
looks on, STUNNED. Everyone pounds the table in hysterics.
MR. ALLAN
Marvelous! Marvelous! That's
what I love most about this
firm-- the collegial
atmosphere, the hearty good-
fellowship!
Miranda is incensed.
MR. ALLAN (CONT'D)
And thanks for those flowers
for my anniversary. My wife
loved them.
FLETCHER
Well, I'm due in court... bye-
bye.
Fletcher exits the conference, closes the door, breathes a
sigh of relief, then FAINTS.
.
CLOSE UP of Fletcher, seated alone at a table. His hands
are on his-face. He looks totally dazed. At the other
table, sit Dana Appleton and Mr. Cole.
BAILIFF
All rise.
They do. Judge Stevens enters. He sits. Everyone sits.
JUDGE STEVENS
Counselors, are we ready to
begin?
FLETCHER
(eagerly and a
little too
LOUDLY)
N o sir! We are not ready to
b eg in. My client has not
arrived.
The doors OPEN and Virginia Cole enters with her CHILDREN
and a NANNY.
FLETCHER

.
--
until now.
He collapses into his chair.
(to Falk, with
DETERMINATION)
Did you and Mrs. Cole ever
make lo-- forni-- roll in the
h-- make the beast with two
ba -- Did you two ever fu--
fu-- Fu!
He begins to hyperventilate.
Virginia turns to Falk.
VIRGINIA
Wate r! Get him water!
Falk hurries into the building as Fletcher hacks on.
FLETCHER
Fu-- fu--
/
VIRGINIA
S it down! Get some air!
(slaps him on the
BACK)
Try to relax! Breathe deeply!
Falk hurries out with a cup, hands it to Fletcher, who
downs it in one gulp -- then spews it out again, SCREAMING
in PAIN. -
VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
W hat?!
What?!
FALK
I couldn't find any water, so
I got him coffee!
Fletcher runs up and down the steps, frantically fanning
h is scalded mouth. The bailiff appears.
BAILIFF
Judge is taking the bench.
Fletcher's expression turns to terror.
The judge settles in. Mr. Allan and a smug Miranda look on
from the gallery.
JUDGE STEVENS
You may proceed, Mr. Reid. .
Everyone turns to Fletcher in anticipation.
In a voice
quaking with fear...
VIRGINIA
Sorry. One of the kids threw
up in the car.
Virginia takes her seat, leaving her two young children
sitting dejectedly in the gallery with their nanny.
FLETCHER
(INCREDULOUS
WHISPER)
You brought your kids. . . to
your divorce?
VIRGINIA
(by way of
EXPLANATION)
Sympathy.
FLETCHER
Well, it's working. I feel
sorry for them already.
The judge BANGS the gavel.
JUDGE STEVENS
Ms. Appleton, you may begin.
CUT TO:
Dana Appleton questions BRYSON, a private investigator.
Fletcher watches with mounting anxiety, NERVOUSLY DRINKS
from a GLASS OF WATER at his table.
BRYSON
(referring to his
NOTES)
-- From March six through June
twelve, I surveilled Mrs. Cole
at the behest of Mr. Cole.
During that period, I noted
that Mr. Cole left each day
between seven-forty and seven-
fifty. Thereafter, Mrs. Cole
would frequently have a male
visitor arrive and stay for
one to four hours. I was able
to take several photographs of
the male visitor.
He shows a photo - - o f a strapping hunk. Fletcher TAKES A
HUGE DRINK.
.
DANA
I see. And do you .know what
Mrs. Cole and her male visitor
did during their frequent...
visits?
BRYSON
Well, they were pretty good
about keeping the shades drawn
-- but I sure was able to
hear. I made an audiotape of
one such., "session."
H e hands her the tape. Fletcher refills his glass.
DANA
With the Court's permission, I
would like to play the tape.
FLETCHER
Your Honor, I object!
JUDGE STEVENS
And why is that, Mr. Reid?
FLETCHER
(can't help
HIMSELF)
Because it's devastating to my
case.
The judge is startled by his candor.
JUDGE STEVENS
Overruled..
As Dana pops the tape into a player, Fletcher anxiously
DOWNS THE GLASS.
Periodically CUTTING to Virginia, Mr. Cole, Dan and the
thirsty Fletcher, we hear Virginia and her visitor engaged
in intense physical activity.
MALE VISITOR (O.S.)
So , what did you say? You
ready?
VIRGINIA (O.S.)
Oh boy am I ready.
MALE VISITOR (O.S.)
Good. Let me help you off
with that. Come on, lie down.
VIRGINIA (O.S.)
Wai t a minute. Do you have
protection?
MALE VISITOR ( O . S . )
Right here. Okay, now I ' m
gonna show you something new.
VIRGINIA ( O . S . )
Oh, I've never done it like
this before.
..
MALE VISITOR (O.S.)
Don't worry, you can take it.
Oh yeah. That's it. There
you go. Yes! Yes!
WE HEAR labored rhythmic breathing.
MALE VISITOR (O.S) (CONT'D)
Yes, yes, yes --
As Dana fast-forwards again, then resumes... with still
more labored breathing, building intensity and --
MALE VISITOR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Oh yeah, bring it on .home --
yes! Yes! Yes!
VIRGINIA (O.S.)
Yes! YES! YES!
The groans reach their incredible climax. There's a still
moment. . .
As the shy COURT REPORTER, the macho BAILIFFS and the no-
nonsense judge all mop their brows, Dana shuts off the
tape. She turns to Fletcher with a satisfied smile.
DANA
Your witness.
FLETCHER
No questions.
JUDGE STEVENS
No questions? .
VIRGINIA
No questions?
FLETCHER
(afraid to ask
ANY)
No questions.
DANA
(TRIUMPHANT)
Petitioner rests.
JUDGE STEVENS
All right, Mr. Reid. You may
proceed.
FLETCHER
(to himself)
How?!
Gathering his courage, he stands, downs the last of his
water, and moves to the lecturn. He's about to speak...
when a WONDERFUL FEELING sweeps through him.
After a momement, he grins.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Would the Court be willing to
grant me a short bathroom
break?
JUDGE STEVENS
It can't wait?
FLETCHER
Not unless you want to mop up.
JUDGE STEVENS
(FRUSTRATED)
All right, but get back in
here immediately so .we can
finish this.
Fletcher beams. Then necessity compels him to race out.
Fletcher stands before the urinal, taking the longest leak
i n legal history. Relief. Then, he looks at his watch.
It's only 4:15. '
FLETCHER
What did I think? That I
could piss for forty-five
minutes?!
He HITS HIS FOREHEAD in frustration... and gets an idea.
He HITS HIMSELF AGAIN and AGAIN, SMASHES HIS HEAD INTO THE
WALL, POKES HIMSELF IN THE EYES, YANKS ON HIS EARS, finally
KNOCKS HIMSELF IN THE STALL, where he continues his attack.
A MAN enters, hears a commotion from behind the stall door.
MAN
What's going on in-there?
FLETCHER (O . S . )
I ' m abusing myself! Do you
mind?!
The man looks disgusted. He carefully leaves the room.
The judge is PISSED. Suddenly the bailiff helps in the
severly beaten Fletcher. The entire courtroom is SHOCKED.
BAILIFF
I found him like this in the
bathroom. Somebody beat the
hell out of him.
JUDGE STEVENS
Who did this?
FLETCHER
(TRUTHFULLY)
A madman, Your Honor.. A
desperate fool at the end of
his pitiful.rope.
JUDGE STEVENS
-What did he look like?
FLETCHER
(DESCRIBING
HIMSELF)
About five eleven, hundred
eighty-five pounds, crazed
look in his eye.
JUDGE STEVENS
Bailiff, have the deputies
search the building.
A HUBBUB rises. He bangs the gavel.
JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)
Under the circumstances, I
have no choice but to recess
this case until tomorrow
morning at nine.
Fletcher smiles serenly -- until --
JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)
-- Unless, of course, you
think you can still proceed?
Fletcher covers his mouth in a desperate attempt to avoid
answering, but he can't repress the truth.
JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)
Can you?
FLETCHER
Yes, I can.
JUDGE STEVENS
Splendid. I admire your
courage, Mr. Reid. I'll give
you a few minutes to compose
yourself, and then we'll get
started.
Fletcher looks as if he has just been sentenced to death.
Fletcher's handcuffed and is led to jail by TWO OFFICERS-.
There's a happy/crazedness to him now. The truth is
pouring forth, but he looks way, way off the deep end.
(desperately,
p as si ng a phone)
Pho ne call!! Phone call!! I
g et to make a phone call!!
Max and Audrey at the table. The airline tickets Jerry
gave her are in front of them.
MAX
When would we move?
AUDREY
Soon. My semester's almost
over. You only have a week
left of school... You like
Jerry don't you?
(he nods)
So what do you say, should we
check it out? Jerry wants us
to come with him tonight. He
has to pick out a place to
live and he really wants our
help?
MAX
Could I get a sled for when it
snows?
AUDREY
Of course you can.
Max thinks, then:
MAX
Okay.
F l e t c h e r ' s holding a phone. He's frantic, now.
F L E TC H E R
( re: ringing
PHONE)
Answer! Answer!! Answer!! !
%
The phone RINGS, Audrey answers it.
AUDREY
Hello.
.
INTERCUT FLETCHER/AUDREY
FLETCHER
Audrey!
It's Fletcher--
AUDREY
(PISSED)
I can't talk now, Fletcher.
We have to pack.
FLETCHER
Wait, the most amazing thing's
happened to me! I am feeling
so good...
(REALIZING)
Pack?! Did you say pack?!
AUDREY
Max was sitting on the porch
again, waiting for his dad. I
won't let you do this to him
anymore. I won't let you do
this to me.
FLETCHER
A ud rey , wait. Please, I need
to talk to you. I .swear, I'm
a changed man. Just come to
the courthouse with a thousand
dollars and bail me out...
Hello?
(to a cop)
O ne more call!! I need
another call!!
Fletcher is pacing back and forth. A GROUP OF TOUGH
PRISONERS are on the far side of the cell, trying to stay
as far away from Fletcher as they can.
FLETCHER
And what about our water
su pply ? You don't think "the
man's" dumped enough toxins to
render every dick in this cell
as lifeless as a beached
minn ow? You're damn rightJ
"The man" does anything he
w an ts. We're nothing but
pu ppets... Little game pieces
they move back and forth.
A DEPUTY appears.
'
DEPUTY
Mr. Reid.
^
FLETCHER
That's me. Fletcher T. Reid.
Pawn no. 332-154-9867.
DEPUTY
You made bail. Some woman.
Fletcher rushes in.
FLETCHER
Audrey?
(he spots)
Greta?!
GRETA
Am I too late? Have you been
se xu al ly molested yet? I
could circle the block.
FLETCHER
Greta! Greta!! . . . . Look at
you, you well preserved,
underpaid, overworked,
underappreciated thing you.
G iv e me a hug! You came and
got me out!! Hug me!!
GRETA
(totally wierded
OUT)
Yes, well, I heard you went
all noble in front of Mr.
Allan so--
FLETCHER
Y ou know what?! I love you.
I loveyouloveyouloveyou. I
wa nt to hug you. Come here..,
GRETA
Mr. Reid, what has gotten intc
to you?!
FLETCHER
Just the truth, Greta.
Fifteen years of being stuck
in a lie is nowhere near as
powerful as one day of being
stuck in the truth.
(checks his
WATCH)
Oh, my God!! I have to go!
Thanks again, Greta!
(as he runs off
he calls back to
HER)
By the way, the truth is that
I need you and I couldn't file
a paperclip without you!
Greta smiles, then catches herself, and quickly regains her
"composure".
CUT TO:
Fletcher's driving like a madman...
FLETCHER
(on his phone)
Answeransweransweranswer...
We HEAR a RECORDED VOICE:

VOICE
The subscriber you called is
either unavailable or outside
the calling area.
FLE TCHER
Shit!!
A udrey and Max meet Jerry by the ticket counter. Max is
wearing the Dodger cap his dad gave him. Jerry surprises
him with a Boston Red Sox hat.
JERRY
A little going away present.
I was gonna get you a bowl of
clam chowder but they only had
Manhattan.
A UDREY
Say thank you, Max.
MAX
Thanks.
.
Max takes off the hat his dad gave him and replaces it with
the Boston hat.
Fletcher's on the phone.
He sails passed a parked POLICE
CAR.
FLETCHER
(into phone)
Shelton, Jerry Shelton.
What time's that flight leave?
7:50. Thank you.
(checks his
WATCH)
Oh, shit! Shit!! Shit!
Fletcher spots the FLASHING LIGHTS.
FLETCHER
Shiiiiit!!!
He pulls over -- so quick he jumps the curb.
POLICE OFFICER
Would you step out of the car,
please?
Fletcher obeys.
FLETCHER
Listen; I know I'm driving a
little crazy but i have an
emergency to attend to...
The cop's just getting off his walkie talkie.
POLICE OFFICER
I'm impounding this vehicle.
FLETCHER
W h y ? What for? For changing
lanes?
POLICE OFFICER
I just ran your tags through
the computer. You've got.
seventeen unpaid parking
tickets.
FLETCHER
No ! I paid them! This
morning! That's the truth!
I
swear!!
POLICE OFFICER
Not according to the computer.
FLETCHER
The computer is wrong! It
' hasn't been updated. The
computer's a liar!
POLICE OFFICER
You can straighten it out at
the impound yard.
FLETCHER
(checks his
watch, firmly)
NO!
POLICE OFFICER
No?
FLETCHER
That's right, no! I'm not
gonna lose my son because some
stupid clerk was too lazy to
update the computer.
(getting cockier.
as he goes)
Now if you want to follow me,
. you can follow me and take the
car after I get where I'm
going. I'm a lawyer and I
k now my rights! Understand?!
CUT TO:
A TOW TRUCK drives away with Fletcher's car, leaving
Fletcher stranded.
He starts in the front door, when a SECURITY GUARD stops
him.
SECURITY GUARD
Whoa, where do you think
you're going?
FLETCHER
I just need to use the phone
to call a cab. I work here.
MR. ALLAN (O.S.)
Used to work here.
Mr. Allan has just exited the elevator.
...

MR. ALLAN
(to security
GUARD)
Son, that man is tresspassing.
The guard starts toward Fletcher threateningly.
FLETCHER
Hold it!
(to Mr. Allan)
I've got ten years worth of
dirt on you and this firm, and
I'm in the kind of mood today
to get a lot off my chest.
You let me use the phone or I
start talking!!
CUT TO:
Fletcher's is THROWN ON HIS ASS in the street. Mr. Allan
has watched from atop the stairs of the building.
MR. ALLAN
Still euphoric, Reid?
He goes back inside. Fletcher starts to get up when a CAR
SCREECHES to a HALT, inches away.
MAN'S VOICE ( O . S . )
Fletcher! 
It's PHILIP.
PHILIP
Seven-thirty... It's Karaoke
time!
Fletcher runs up and HUGS the astonished man,
FLETCHER
PHILIP!!
LOOK AT YOU!!! MY
PHILIP!!
Fletcher KISSES HIM ON THE LIPS.
Philip's driving Fletcher.
FLETCHER
You're saving my life, Philip.
PHILIP
You know, it's funny, but for
some reason I was beginning to
think you didn't like me.
Isn't that silly?
FLETCHER .
No. It's not silly.
I don't
like you.
PHILIP
What?
FLETCHER
I don't like you. I'm sorry.
I find you boring. I hate
ch ara des . And you wouldn't
know a good time if it sat on
your face.
(feels bad)
I'm sorry. It was easier than
telling you how I really felt.
Are you upset?
A moment, then:
PHILIP
No. To be honest, I don't
like you either. You treat
people like obstacles and you
cheat at charades. .
FLETCHER
Then why are you always trying
to socialize with me?
PHILIP
You're a client. I figured if
I didn't try to be your
friend, you'd get a new
accountant.
FLETCHER
Philip, I don't like you as a
person, but I'm crazy about
you as my accountant. I ' d
never hire a new accountant.
Never!
PHILIP
So we don't have to like each
other anymore?
FLETCHER
-
Not at all.
.
PHILIP
All right. Sooner I get you
to the airport, sooner I can
dump your sorry ass off.
Fletcher races in.
FLETCHER
Bedelayed. Bedelayed. Fog,
rain, something, anything...
He sees the DEPARTURE BOARD
" F li g ht 69. Departs 7:50. On Time. Gate 17."
Fletcher looks at the clock -- It's 7:46!!
Holy Shit!!
Fletcher pushes his way HE a crowded escalator. Past
people standing on the left despite the SIGN that says
STAND ON RIGHT.
FLETCHER
Excuse me. . . excuse me. . . Come
on folks, let's let the
frantic man pass... Sorry...
Thank... you... Standing on
the right, passing on the
left. They can't make this-
deal any easier than it is...
Come on... coming through...
At the top,- a WOMAN in a NURSES UNIFORM asks for money...
WOMAN
Help the poor?...
FLETCHER
(speeding past)
I don't trust you. I don't
know what the hell that
uniform is. Sorry.
(a Hare Krishna
tries to stop
HIM)
NOT NOW, TOGA BOY!
Fortunately, there's no line at the metal detector.
Fletcher races right by but SETS OFF THE ALARM.
INSPECTOR
Please step through again.
FLETCHER
Ahhh!! !
Damn..;
Fletcher frantically tosses his keys, cufflinks, his Rolex
into a tray.
He tries again.
It BUZZES again!
FLETCHER
What? I'tii practically naked!
A guy in a TURBAN passes over him with a DETECTOR WAND.
FLETCHER
It's called a ZIPPER, Hodgy...
The wand BEEPS over Fletchers front pocket. He reaches in
and pulls out the now familiar BLUE PEN...
Fletcher races by Gate 15, 16, gets to 1 7 . . . but sees the
PLANE Slowly TAXIING AWAY.
FL E TC H ER
N ooo!!!
Fletcher spots a door marked "NOT AN EXIT".
Goes for it
when a FLIGHT ATTENDANT interrupts.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Can I help you?
FLETCHER
Look out!! ! --
(TRUTHFUL)
-NOTHING'S COMING!!
The woman raises her eyebrows and looks anyway. And
Fletcher BOLTS THROUGH THE EXIT!
PASSENGERS calmly read while outside FLETCHER speeds along,
WAVING HIS ARMS like a maniac. The ENGINE NOISE drowns out
his call for...
F LET CH ER
MA X ? !!
AUDREYY?!!
A STEWARDESS stands in the aisle, giving the safety
lecture.
STEWARDESS
In case of a water landing,
please use your seat cushion
AS--
Her MOUTH DROPS as she notices Fletcher.
Fletcher's BANGED UP pretty good. His head is BANDAGED.
He.puts a COLD COMPRESS to his BRUISED FOREHEAD and WINCES.
FLETCHER
(mumbles to
HIMSELF)
Oh boy, the truth hurts.
Yes
indeed.
DEPUTY
Mr. Reid. Someone made bail
for you.
