    THE SCREEN IS WHITE.  CAMERA moves; more a feelingof 
      movement than anything else.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        I dream... I dream I m floating on the 
                        surface of my own life...

      RESOLVE: CAMERA travels over STILL WATER until we find:  
      DEXTER, floating on his back.  Pure leisure.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Watching it unfold.  Observing it.   
                      I m the outsider looking in.

    He turns, mildly curious.  HIS POV: across flat water, a 
      dock.  Two teenage BOYS toss a young GIRL into the water.  
      A fan of ripples widens from where she went in.  Finally, 
    she surfaces, screams at her tormentors.

                                        GIRL
                          Suchassholes!

    But she s laughing, too.  ON DEXTER.  Watching the fun.  
    The ripples reach him.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Look at them: they can laugh and play.  
                      It comes so easily.

    The boys lift the girl back onto the dock.  Laughing, they 
      turn their backs onthe girl.  She abruptlySHOVES THEM 
      BOTH IN THE WATER: sweet revenge.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Even though I m not one of them... 

    The boys come up, sputtering and grinning.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Even though sometimes I can really be 
                        a monster...

    ON DEXTER, watching the girl jump in to swim with the boys.

    He allows himself to slip into the water; and, just before 
    he goes all the way under, his eyes remain above surface 
      level.  Like a crocodile watching the world.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                                (playful)
                      ... a seamonster.

    And he sinks from view.

      OMITTED22


    The  Slice of Life  bobs tranquilly at anchor.  A beat.  
      Then Dexter ERUPTS from the water and, in one graceful 
      move, pulls himself onto his boat.  

    He crosses to the cooler, retrieves a gleaming red apple 
    and takes a healthy bite.  SLOW PUSH IN on the apple.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Soon enough I ll have to go back to 
                        doing what I do.

    THE SCREEN BLOOMS TO RED.  Bright, translucent crimson. 

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      So I make a point of enjoying days 
                        like this when I have them.

      SLOW PULLBACK and we realize we re looking at one of 
      Dexter s slides.  We re --


      Dexter holds the blood slide up to the light.  Admires it.  
      A KNOCK at his door pulls him from the moment.He returns 
    the slide to the box and puts the box in its hiding place 
      behind the air conditioner.  

      Starting to cross, he spots the Doll Head on the 
      refrigerator.  He quickly tosses it into the freezer, goes 
    to the door and opens.  The chain catches.  There sDEBRA.

                                        DEXTER
                        Hey.

                        Bagels, brother. Lemme in.

      Dexter unlatches the chain, letting his sister pass.  She 
      immediately pulls open the drapes.          DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     3.

                        Could it be more depressing in here?

      Dexter regards her, amused.

                                        DEBRA
                      Got anything to drink?  It s hot as 
                        hell out there.

                        So... how reyou doing?

      Dexter opens the freezer.  There are the Doll Parts.  He 
      scoops up some ice. 

                                        DEXTER
                        Things are fine.  Breakfast, which I 
                        already had, was fine.  

    He closes the freezer,crosses back to Debraand smears a 
      bagel with cream cheese. 

                                        DEXTER
                      But you know me: always hungry.  

    He takes a messy bite, wipes his lips.

                                        DEXTER
                        So...what s up, hotshot?

      Debra grins, happy for permission to get down to business.

                                        DEBRA
                      All right, get this: the Lieutenant is 
                        looking for that refrigerated truck in 
                        every swamp, glade and chop-shop from

                      Way I see it: the whack-job truck 
                        driver threw a severed head at your 
                      car for Chrissake.It s not as if 
                        he s shy.

                      You think he s hiding the truck in

                        I could answer that if LaGuerta didn t

      Teenage Dexter uses the knife to clean and gut a sizable 
      collection of freshly-caught fish.  He tosses the guts 
      overboard and rinses his bloody hands in a bucket of fresh 
      water.  Then he looks over to Harry, who s putting away 
      tackle.  Harry turns and grins at him.

    He smiles a big, confident smile at Teenage Dexter and 
      steps onto the dock (passing Dexter s bicycle) and heads to 
    his truck.  On Teenage Dexter, watching his father go...

      CAMERA at street level.  All is still.  A beat.  Then the 
      tranquility is shattered when a BODY CRASHES into FRAME 
      from somewhere above, slamming hard against the wet 
      pavement.


      Detectives, Uniforms and Forensics, Dexter and BATISTA 
      among them, swarm the body.  LAGUERTA approaches.

                                        LAGUERTA
                        Morning, Detective.  We got an ID?

                        Still waiting.

      Dexter leans over the body.  LaGuerta moves in.  He turns 
    to her.  She tilts her head at him.

                                        LAGUERTA
                        Hello, Dex.

                        right place at the right time when 
                        promotions came around.

      LaGuerta puts her hand on Dexter s shoulder, a squeeze.

                      In keeping with her total sense of 
                        entitlement, she has this, this

                      And I thought Iwas creepy.

      LaGuerta looks around, takes it all in.        DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     13.

                        Where dhe come from?

      Dexter squats down for a closer look.

                                        DEXTER
                        Given the skin rupture and secondary 
                        spatter distance, had to be a 50-60 
                        foot drop.

    He glances up, studies the Causeways overhead.

                                        DEXTER
                        Eastbound is maybe 40 feet... not high 
                        enough for this kind of damage.  So, 
                        best guess, originating point was the 
                        Westbound Causeway.

      LaGuerta strides off, barking at her minions as she goes.

                                        LAGUERTA
                      Get me a team on the Westbound 
                        Causeway.

                                        BATISTA
                              (no she isn t)
                        She s good.

    But Dexter s distracted.  He leans over the victim. 

                                        DEXTER
                        There s something in his mouth.  
                        Angel, lemme have your tweezers.

      Batista passes them over and, as Dexter moves in even 
      closer, the victim suddenly EXHALES -- spewing out a mist 
    of blood that catches Dexter full in the face.

      Dexter, his face covered in blood, turns to Batista.  But 
      Batista s already on the move.

                                        BATISTA
                        Paramedicos, vengan!

    As the EMTsrush in, Dexter stoops to retrieve what was in 
    the victim s mouth.

                                        EMT
                        Just a death rattle.  He s gonzo.

      Batista hands Dexter a towel, turns to the Paramedics.

                                        BATISTA
                        Better check out my friend, too.  No 
                        telling what that guy is carrying.        DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     13A.


      Dexter wipes his face, holds the tweezers up to the light.

                                        DEXTER
                        Here s what he s carrying.        DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     14.


      It s a three inch chunk of meat.

                                        DEXTER
                        Call me crazy...
                                (beat)
                      ... but I think this is human flesh.


      TIGHT ON Dexter.  A beat.  Then he sprays something on his 
      face.  He switches off the lights and we go DARK.  Then the 
      eerie glow of a BLACK-LIGHTcomes on and we realize that 
      Dexter hasLuminoledhis own face.  He passes the blue-
      light wand in front of it.  Fascinated, he observes the 
      blood residual from the man in the alley.


      Dexter working at his desk.  Debra hovering, snooping.

                                        DEXTER
                        Tried calling you last night.

                        I hooked up with Sean.

                      God no.  He smelled like cheese.

                                        DEXTER
                      So, then mechanic Sean?

                                        DEBRA
                        Yup.He came over. Two things led to 
                        another and next thing I know we re 
                        doing the... 

      Dexter keeps busy, not really focusing on his sister.

                                        DEBRA
                      You really want to hear this?

                                        DEXTER
                        Actually... no.  But if you guys are 
                        getting serious, I d like to meet him.

      Debra takes something from his desk.  He takes it back.

                                        DEXTER
                      How about you and Sean the mechanic

    In the b.g., Batista works at a nearby desk.        DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     15.


                                        DEBRA
                        Why, so you can tell me later that he s 
                      not good enough for your little sister?

                                        DEXTER
                        You re the one who was going on about 
                        brother-sister stuff this morning.  

                                        DEBRA
                      And that becomes brother-sister double-
                        dating?  What exactly goes on in that 
                        head of yours?

                                        DEXTER

      DOAKES enters from the stairwell;moving past Dexter, Debra 
    and Batista with a scowl. 

                                        BATISTA 
                        What crawled up his ass?

                                        DEBRA 
                      He hates lab rats. 

      Batista turns to Dexter.

                                        BATISTA
                        Here s the headline:  it s you lab 
                        rats that make us cops look good.

      LaGuerta comes out of her office.  Somber. 

                                        LAGUERTA
                        Listen up.  We just got an ID on the 
                        body from the alley.  His name was 
                        RickySimmons... he was a cop.

      A hush falls over the room.  Everyone shocked to learn they 
      lost one of their own.  Especially Doakes.

      LaGuerta and Doakes pull up in her car.  Before they get 
      out:        DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     16.

                      Ask you something?

                      ... yeah.

                                        LAGUERTA
                        When we were partners, you came up 
                        with every excuse in the book to get 
                      out of making a next-of-kin 
                        notification...

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        I knew Ricky from the Department 
                        softball team.  He was a good guy, a 
                        good cop.  Least I can do.

      They get out, head up the walk and climb the porch steps. 
      LaGuerta rings the bell.  No answer.  Again.  Nothing.  
      Doakes goes to a window, looks inside.  A beat.  Then he 
      sees something.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        Motherfuck!

    He pushes past LaGuerta and, pulling his weapon, KICKS in 
    the front door.


    ON THE LOUVREDWINDOWS sweating with condensation.  As we 
    PAN to find Dexter asleep in his bed, we HEAR the AC 
      working overtime, already fighting the early morning Miami 
      heat and humidity.

    The phone RINGS.  Dexter stirs, checks the caller ID and 
      answers.  INTERCUT with Debra on a street corner.

                      So Miami is the haystack and the ice 
                        truck is the needle, right?

                                        DEXTER

                        Then, brother... I just found the 
                        fuckingneedle!


      Dexter walks with Debra.  OVER THEIR SHOULDERS: an ice 
      truck parked near a busy street corner.

                                        DEXTER
                        How dyou find it?

                                        DEBRA
                        I put the word out with patrol.  You 
                        know, the whole hide-in-plain-sight 
                        thing?  Juan-Pierre flagged this one 
                      and called me.

                        Kinko sguy said it was here when he 
                        opened up this morning.  Abandoned and

    The Captain looks across to where Debra fills out a report.

                        Harry s daughter?  Must be in the

      BACK OF THE ICE TRUCK.  Dexter steps from the cold into the 
      sun.  He looks to the sky.

                        Another beautiful Miami day: mutilated 
                        corpses with a chance of afternoon 
                        showers.

    He sees LaGuerta crossing toward Debra.

      DEBRA LOOKS UP, expectant, as LaGuerta approaches.

                                        DEBRA
                        Chalk one up for Miami Metro, eh,

                        keep me apprised at all times on all

                        your father was.  

    She storms off.  Debra turns to Dexter in the maw of the 
    ice truck.  All he can do is shrug a smile her way.        DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     24.



      A public park where Latin men of all ages play dominoes.

    PAN OFF the mist of sprinklers shimmering in the late-day 
    sun to FIND NORBERTOCERVANTES at a concrete table playing 
      dominoes with crime boss CARLOSGUERRERO.  Each man has a 
      stack of hundreds in front of him  Two Bodyguards hover 
      nearby as Cervantes lays down a tile.  

      Note:  this scene will play in Spanish (without subtitles).

                                        GUERRERO
                      Es tu diade buenasuerte.(Today s 
                        your lucky day.)

    He slides a hundred toward Cervantes.          DEXTER 102      "Crocodile"      Final Draft - 7/17/06     26.


                                        GUERRERO
                          Estoyagradecidoportu lealdad.(I am 
                        grateful for your loyalty.)

    He pushes the rest of his money toward Cervantes.

                                        CERVANTES
                      El gusto es mio, patron. (It is my 
                        pleasure, patron.)

    As he reaches for the money, he notices a red dot on his 
      hand.Then one on his shirt.  Guerrero spots this, quickly 
      rises and turns to see --

      Emerging through the sprinkler spray, five MIAMI SWAT 
      OFFICERS approaching in a tense crouch.  Each has his MP-5
      9mmrifle laser-locked on Cervantes  body.  Cervantes 
      rises, arms outstretched, the smug grin of an untouchable 
    on his lips.

    The Bodyguards start to move; and each is immediately laser-
      locked on the forehead by a SWAT Member.

      Doakes comes up from behind.  A little excessive force and 
      Cervantes is cuffed.

                                        GUERRERO
                      Is that necessary?

                        It s a dangerous world.

                                        GUERRERO
                      And one can t be too careful, 
                        Detective.

      Doakes levels him with a glare, hustles Cervantes away.

                      So the good people of Florida only 
                        went as far as validating their own 
                        assumptions: that MattChambers is a 
                        Floridabad guy.

    The fingerprints match positiveto two other crimes in two 
      other states.  Dexter prints-out the results.  We see news 
      clippings and photographs:

      A seething Doakes clicks off the recorder, scowls at an 
      arrogantly stoic Cervantes.  LaGuerta hovers nearby.

                        Rickyis dead?  That saddens me.

    The door opens and a Cop hands something to LaGuerta.  As 
    she pockets it, Cervantes glances through the open doorway 
    and sees half a dozen other cops watching him with 
      unconcealed contempt.

                                        CERVANTES
                        Wait, you re not implying that Ricky
                        Simmonswas a cop, are you?  I m 
                        truly... disappointed.

      LaGuerta shifts her weight.  A subtle reminder that she s 
      there and that Doakes has to stay professional.  


      Dexter turns away from Doakes and presents a tray with the 
      severed fingertips.  Back in his element now, he s drawn to 
      them.  

                                        DEXTER
                      See how the skin is gloving around the 
                        joints?

                      she was relieved of her fingertips.

                                        DEBRA
                      But why the different nail polishes?  
                        Whatthe hell s this guy thinking?

                      At least he s consistent.

                        Yeah, killing young women who have to

    She turns away, moved and angry.

      Brother and sister share a look.  This can t be good.  
      Debra goes.  Dexter looks after her, then leaves.


      Dexter watches Chambers pull into his driveway.Hetakes 
    the syringe from his pocket and holds it up to the light; 
      admiringthe amber fluid.

      into his house.

                        comeback for happy hour.


      Teenage Dexter stands next to his bike in the teeming Miami 
      rain.  Harry s truck pulls up, slams to a stop.  Teenage 
      Dexter whips open the door.

                        Jesus, Dad, it s called being on time, 
                        ever heard of it?

    He throws his bike into the bed of the truck, climbs in and 
      YANKS the door shut.

                                        HARRY
                        I was having a bad day.  Captain and I 
                      had to have a discussion.

                        Wait.  What kind of bad day?

      Harry stays still, staring off into the pelting rain; the 
      wipers whappingback and forth.  Too angry to answer; too 
      angry to drive.  Teenage Dexter studies his father, then, 
      dawning...

                                        TEENAGE DEXTER
                        It s about the guy who killed

                        today.

      Harry finally turns, looks to Teenage Dexter.  Doesn t say 
      a word.

                        It s all about the choices you make.

    He turns back to the road, slips the truck into gear and 
      drives off.  On Teenage Dexter, next to him, that truth 
      sinking in.                         END FLASHBACK. 


      Dexter crams the Hefty Bags into his trunk, gets in his car 
    and pulls away.  As he leaves the empty parking lot, we 
      CRANE UP to see just where he performed this last deed.

      There, above the storefront, is the broken, ramshackle sign 
    of an old Liquor Store.


      Dexter slips his newly-won slide into the box, then places 
    the box behind the AC unit.

                        people, studying them... 

    He crosses to the refrigerator and opens the freezer.  
      There are the Doll Parts, each so carefully wrapped.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      ... isthat I almost always know what 
                        they re going to do.  

    He takes out the Doll Head, smiles, and puts it back on the 
      freezer door.  He starts to close the freezer; stops.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      So when someone does something I 
                        didn t see coming...

    THE TINY WRAPPED DOLL HANDS.  Dexter unwraps one.  Nothing 
      unusual.  He unwraps the other.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        I really have to stop and...

    The fingernails are painted with the same colors as the 
      fingertips from the block of ice.

                        Just hidden truths that lie beneath 
                      the surface.

    And he sinks into the water, disappearing from view.
