                    My name is Sarah Jane Smith and
                    once I travelled among the stars.

      And now the CAMERA is moving through space...

      Giant, radiant gas clouds.  Wonderful twin stars.  Worlds
      of all colours.

                                      SARAH JANE (CONT'D)
                    I saw worlds beyond imagination. 
                    I went to places beyond my wildest
                    dreams and met creatures beyond my
                    darkest nightmares.  And all of it
                    was amazing.

      As she speaks the CAMERA's journey increases in speed,
      cutting across dark space, the stars becoming streaks of
      light...  now approaching a small sun orbited by nine
      planets - our solar system...

      Blue sky.  Sun shining.  You just know that it's a Sunday.

      SARAH JANE comes out of the house.  Smiles at the day.

                    Life changed.

      Across the road she can see HARESH washing his car.  GITA's 
      Bloomin' Lovely van is parked there, too.  She is watering*
      the hedge.  As Haresh turns away from her, mischievous*
      Gita aims the hose and splashes Haresh.  *

      Sarah Jane grins broadly.

                    I think what crashed here was some
                    sort of prison carrier.

                    prisoner.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    The Judoon's only interest is in
                    stopping that creature getting
                    away.  Humans don't matter.  Under
                    the Articles of the Shadow

                      primitive.

      Luke, Clyde and Rani run after Sarah Jane.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      CAPTAIN TYBO is making his way through an alleyway, cautious 
      now. 

      But not ready for ANDROVAX - who comes from behind.

                                      ANDROVAX
                          (whispers)
                    Judoon!

      Tybo swings around.

      Tybo's POV: A massive piece of wood (or RSJ) coming at
      him...

      SMACK!

      And Androvax is standing over the unconscious Judoon.  His
      lizard-like mouth breaks into an impossibly wide smile of
      a thousand razor-edged teeth.



                                                                (CONTINUED)        THE SARAH JANE ADVENTURES 3 Ep 1 PINKS 17/04/09 page 13.

      Androvax reaches out to Tybo.

      Then the sound of someone coming!

      He stops smiling just as fast, pulls back from Tybo - and
      makes off among the houses -

      As SARAH JANE, LUKE, CLYDE and RANI reach the spot...

                                    RANI
                    Look!

      Luke and Rani swoop, concerned, on the prone Tybo.  There's 
      yellow blood over one of his eyes.

                                    LUKE
                    He's been knocked cold.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Be careful!

      As Tybo begins to stir.  Quickly, Sarah Jane grabs his
      fallen weapon and throws it aside.

      Tybo is suddenly alert - and angry.

              SJA 3 Ep1 PINKS
                                    TYBO

                    Whoa!

 
      Tybo leaps to his feet, now furious...

                                    TYBO
                          (at Clyde)
                    Mo wo sho cho!

                                      CLYDE
                          (to the others)
                    What did I say?

      But Tybo staggers a little, nearly falls - Luke and Rani
      move to help him.  Tybo shakes them off.

                                    TYBO
                    Ko fro mo!

      Sarah Jane takes charge.

                                      SARAH JANE
                          (to Tybo)
                    You're injured.  We only want to
                    help you.

      Tybo pulls his translator out and puts it near Sarah Jane's*
      mouth - the others react, startled.*

                    Yeah.  Your prisoner clobbered you
                    and ran off.

                    Sentence is execution -

      Only as Tybo tries to go for his gun, he just sinks to his 
      knees, and moans with pain.  Sarah Jane and the others go 
      to help him.

                    I think we'd better get out of

      The police jeep is making its way steadily along a suburban

      A cyclist overtakes them.*

      Another car, top-down, stops beside them at the junction. *
      A BOY RACER, playing loud music - very loud music.*

      Tybo grimaces.  The Boy Racer is so deep into his noisy
      music he hasn't noticed the Judoon.

      Tybo buzzes the window.

                                    LUKE

      As Tybo aims his gun through the window at the Boy Racer...

                      Attention!

                    Have nice day.

      The lights change and Tybo pulls away.

      The Bloomin' Lovely van pulls up outside the Genetec

                    According to the brochure Sarah*

                    back for miles.  Well, a long way*

      Gita opens the back to the van - it's full of plants.*

                    Might have to get a second van-*

                    This is ridiculous, Gita.  You're
                    going to get us arrested.

                                      GITA*
                    Oh don't be such a wet blanket,
                    Haresh.  You're not in school now,
                    you know.

                                      HARESH
                    No.  But I'd like to still have a
                    job there tomorrow.

      Gita dumps a big plant in his arms.

                    call it.

                                      HARESH
                    Except we're not planting in the
                    city.  We're dumping dozens of

                    I still think sending them a letter -
                      a brochure - would be a more
                      conventional approach.

                                    GITA
                    You see, conventional.  That's
                    your problem, my darling.  If you're
                    going to grow in corporate floristry
                    you have to learn to think outside
                    the seed box.  It's a plant eat
