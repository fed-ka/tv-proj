      MIKE EDWARDS (42) and KATE EDWARDS (40, as of today), full
      of life and optimism, enter their kitchen from the garage, a
      little tipsy, the ease of a successful 15-year marriage--

                                    KATE EDWARDS
                    40's the new 30, right?  How bad can
                    it be?

                                    MIKE EDWARDS
                    No wise man ever wished to be younger.

                                    KATE EDWARDS
                          (thinks)
                    Eleanor Roosevelt?

                                    MIKE EDWARDS
                    Jonathan Swift.  
                          (beat)
                    I think.  We could Google it.



                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        2.

                                    KATE EDWARDS
                    Google shmoogle.  Thank you.  For
                    the best birthday ever.

                                    MIKE EDWARDS
                    Looking forward to the next 40...

      They kiss.  Till Kate sees a card on the counter, "Happy
      Birthday, Mom!"  Only a mother's love for her daughter could
      interrupt this moment.  She opens it.  Reads, smiles--

                                    KATE EDWARDS
                    Look at the card Kayla left for me.

                                    MIKE EDWARDS
                    Sweet.  She asleep?  I'm gonna turn
                    on the news...

                                    KATE EDWARDS
                    I'm gonna sleep off three martinis...

      Kate squeezes Mike's hand and heads upstairs.  Mike flips on
      the news and gets comfortable on the couch...


      Mike jerks awake-- a gun pointed in his face.  A MAN in a
      ski mask and gloves is staring down his automatic at him-- 

                                    MAN 
                    Hands.

      Mike's eyes go wide.  Taking in the threat.  Trying to process--

                                    MAN (CONT'D)
                    Gimme your hands.

      --Things moving fast and slow at the same time.  Mike leaps,
      trying to get to his family.  The Man cracks him in the head
      with his gun, dazing him.  Puts a plastic zip tie around his
      wrists and drags him upstairs to--


      --Where he rouses KAYLA (13) from sleep, the gun in her face--

                                    MAN
                    Gettup.  

                                      KAYLA EDWARDS
                    Daddy--?

                                    MIKE EDWARDS
                    Do what he says.  I love you.


                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        3.

      CONTINUED:

      The Man zip-ties Kayla's hands, keeping the gun on her. 
      Indicates for them to continue down the hall to the--


      Where Kate is asleep, stirs when the light flicks on--

                                    KATE EDWARDS
                    Babe...?

                                    MIKE EDWARDS
                    Kate--

                                    MAN
                    Up. 

                                    KATE EDWARDS
                    Oh my God-- Kayla--

                                      KAYLA EDWARDS
                    Mommy--

                                    MAN
                    Hands.

      Kate sees Mike's and Kayla's bound hands.  Extends her own. 
      The Man ties them--

                                    MAN (CONT'D)
                    Go--

      He pushes Kate into the--


      The Man in the doorway, and Kate-- 

                                    MAN
                    Open it.

                                    KATE EDWARDS
                    What--?

                                    MAN
                    The safe.  

      Right.  Kate opens a cabinet door.  Inside is a large SAFE. 
      She studies the lock... Please, let me remember... She turns
      the swivel several times.  Wrong.  Back again.  Excruciating. 
      Then.  Click.  She scrambles out of the way to give him room--

                                    MAN (CONT'D)
                    Your ring.

      Her engagement ring.  Kate slips it off.  Tosses it to him.  

                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        4.

      CONTINUED:

      He empties the safe into his backpack and pushes Kate--


      --Back into the bedroom.  Points his gun toward the wall.

                                    MAN
                    Kneel.  

      Kate, Mike and Kayla kneel down facing the wall.  

                                    MAN (CONT'D)
                    Be quiet and everything's gonna be
                    fine... 

      Mike and Kate share a glance, ever hopeful, when--

      BAM.  BAM BAM.  The Man opens fire.  Three shots.  And we:

                                                                      SMASH TO BLACK.

      UNDER WHICH WE HEAR:

        A HEARTBEAT, working overtime.  Like a symphony, other
      instruments join in:  Rapid BREATHING, POUNDING footsteps.

      CLOSE ON THE FACE OF A WOMAN, early thirties.  Running.

      Her name is ANNIE FROST.  And if you're wondering why you're
      instantly drawn to her, it's probably because she's a Texan. 
      Wholesome.  Open.  Lethal-- 

      Cowboy boots pounding the dirt like a machine.  Nothing else
      in the world except whatever she's running from.  Or towards.

      CHYRON: "Today."

      WIDER TO REVEAL A MAN 

      About 50 yards in front of her.  Let's call him "The Bull." 
      Because he's big and mean as a bull, and struggling mightily
      to make the distance between them wider.  Might pull it off
      too, as he merges into the crowd of tourists at--


      Welcome to the South Texas Violent Offender Fugitive Task
      Force.  Four walls.  One:  A map of Texas, its iconic shape,
      the state known 'round the world.  Two:  The Texas Flag with
      its Lone Star.  Three:  The U.S. Marshals Star badge.  Four: 
      The U.S.M.S. "Top 15 Most Wanted," a.k.a. "The Bitch List,"
      15 wooden frames with the fugitive's mug shot and stats,
      lovingly adorned with horns, fake mustaches, etc.  The room
      itself is filled with low-walled cubicles for the deputies'
      desks.  A few offices off the main room.  Nothing fancy.  

      The Task Force members (including Jimmy, Marco and Daisy)
      start their day with coffee and kolaches (ko-lah'-chee: a
      Czech pastry filled with pretty much anything you want and
      an essential part of any Houston cop's day).  [Note: Unlike
      clean-cut, suit-wearing FBI agents, these deputies are in
      jeans and T-shirts, allowing them to blend in in places where
      fugitives and their associates hang out.]

      They ERUPT WITH APPLAUSE when Annie enters, her signature
      boots and faded Levis-- 

                                      MARCO
                    Hey-- it's the famous Annie Frost! 
                    Looked good on the 10 o'clock news! 



                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        7.

                    Got a fugitive on Mt. Rushmore, you
                    wanna go wreck that too.

                    Gonna sic you on my ex next time she
                    comes 'round lookin' for alimony.  

      Annie LAUGHS.  This is a crowd that lives to toss each other
      shit.  But Annie can take it.  And they know it.  The more
      shit they toss, the more they show their love for this woman
      who has, in 8 short years, become their de facto leader in
      the field.  Their heart and soul.

                                      ANNIE
                    Which ex we talking about, Jimmy? 
                    Number five or six?

      More LAUGHTER.  Task Force Commander CHIEF TYLER (45, had an
      earring and long hair before they offered him the job) enters. 
      LUKE WATSON (25, clean-cut, fresh-faced) trails a step behind.

                                      CHIEF TYLER
                    Okay, Annie, so you nab the slimeball
                      drug-slinger we've been chasing 5
                    years.  Now you wanna tell us how
                    you destroyed part of a $14 million
                      architectural marvel and nearly got
                    yourself killed in the process?

      The room CHUCKLES.  But there's pride in Tyler's eyes. 
      Annie's the best he's got.  

                                      CHIEF TYLER (CONT'D)
                      Contractor just called Washington. 
                    Glass panel's gonna run us 70K.

                                      JIMMY
                    We got enough in the seized assets
                    fund to cover that one?  

                                      ANNIE
                    Tell 'em to file a claim.  

      More LAUGHTER, till Luke Watson pipes up, in earnest--

                                    LUKE
                    Good thing there were no ricochets. 
                    Could've shot yourself, instead of
                    the Bull.

      Everyone turns and looks.  Who the fuck is this?  Dressed
      D.C. preppy, shiny new loafers for his first day on the job-- 



                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        8.

      CONTINUED:

                                      CHIEF TYLER 
                    Sorry, people.  Luke Watson, our
                    latest P.O.D.  Rotated outta hook-
                    and-haul in D.C. to join us.
                          (to Annie and Jimmy)
                    He's your tag-along.  Show 'em the
                    ropes, get him acclimated.

      As Tyler turns to go, Annie and Jimmy catch up--

                                      ANNIE
                    Never been one for tag-alongs, Chief. 
                    Except for ol' Jimmy here, of course.

                                      JIMMY
                    Look at the kid.  He'll last as long
                    in Texas as a fly in a frog swamp.

                                      CHIEF TYLER
                    What you get for being the best. 

      Just enough sarcasm to shut them up.  Tyler exits.  Luke
      smiles at the gang--  

                                    LUKE
                    Just wanna tell you how psyched I am
                    to be on the Task Force.  It's been
                    a dream of mine.  Seriously.

      Daisy and Marco share a look.

                                      DAISY
                    Tuna?

                    Totally.  The sooner the better.

      Whatever that means, we'll find out later, as Jimmy holds a
      phone out to Annie--

                                      JIMMY
                    Wes Lawson from HPD Homicide.  Says
                    he's got a bad one, needs our help.

      Annie nods, her whole demeanor going serious, as we SMASH TO--


      A MAN'S FACE (26, blond hair, green eyes) illuminated on the
      wall as Annie turns off the lights.  Luke reacts, Huh?, till
      Annie turns on the "smart board" (a wall-sized computer touch
      screen that lets her call up images, save what she writes to
      a file), and pulls up one of her famous "LINK CHARTS" (looks
      like a family tree with the fugitive in the middle, everything
      they know about him branching out).

      Annie's gaze turns back to Mason's photo.  And that's when
      we see it.  What Annie sees.  Mason's photo-- not just a
      static image-- it's almost three-dimensional in its detail...
      brought to life by Annie's heightened sense of perception... 

      As she talks, she fills in Mason's name and stats...

                    Took six days, but they matched a
                    partial tattoo Kayla saw on his neck
                    to a "W" tattoo in the Scars, Marks
                    & Tattoos database.  Looks homemade,

                                        ACT ONE


      Annie, Jimmy and Luke pull up to Mason's apartment in an SUV
      outfitted by TOG (Tactical Operations Group, basically the
      domestic CIA).  Dashboard computer, gun locker, radios--

                    Seized from a crook doing 30 up in
                      Robertson.  

      They jump out of the car and gear up-- tactical pants over
      their jeans, vesting up in Kevlar, grabbing their AR-15s and
      pistols out of the the gun locker--

                    Alrighty.  Let's make this look good.


      Daisy and Marco sweep the house, checking closets, inside
      furniture, looking for hidden walls, as Mason's mother, JAN
      BOYLE (43, blonde from a bottle) watches in horror.

      the bedroom, oddly devoid of personal effects, as Jimmy enters--

                    No clothes on the floor.  No magazines

                    cleaned up.
                          (opens the closet)
                    Just a couple old shirts.  Wouldn't
                    even know the guy lived here...  

      She gets an idea.  Picks up a pillow on the bed.  Smells it. 
      Removes the pillow case.  Smells the pillow itself.

      Annie looks around the kitchen.  Spotless.  Zeroes in on--

      --THE SINK.  She reaches her hand into the disposal.  Pulls
      out a few mangled Maraschino cherry stems.  

      --THE REFRIGERATOR.  Empty.  She opens the butter dish door. 
      Finds a hot sauce packet from "Tico's Tacos."  Pockets it.

                    from that house...

                                      LAURA ROSS
                    ... What?  No.  Mason bought it for
                    me.  It's mine.

                                      ANNIE
                    If that's true, I'll bring it back.  

      Laura looks at the ring, a lump rising in her throat. 
      Blinking, she hands it to Annie.

                                      ANNIE (CONT'D)
                    You know, Laura.  If he lied about

                    he's lying about too...
                          (re: the photo)
                    ... handsome guy like that.

      Laura stares at Annie, determined not to break down.

                    I'm late for work.  Can I go now?


      A LITTLE GIRL (3) wanders down the aisle of a Houston grocery
      store.  Lost.  A cart, empty except for three jars of
      Maraschino cherries, rolls up to her.

                                      MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Are you lost, sweetheart?

      The little girl looks up at the Man.

                                      LITTLE GIRL 
                    Do you know where my mommy is?

      The Man crouches down.  It's Mason.  He smiles at her. 

                                      MASON
                    Whaddya say we try and find her? 

      He takes her hand-- and walks her straight out of the store...


      Jimmy and Luke eat tacos, blending in and keeping an eye out
      as Annie discreetly shows Mason's photo to a BLONDE WAITRESS--

                                      BLONDE WAITRESS
                    'Course I remember him.  Guy asked
                    me out every time he came in here.

                          (her wedding band...)
                    He liked extra habaneros and I'd

                    No way.  Should'a seen that smile of
                    his... Like the break of dawn.

                    Not for a while.  Good thing, too. 
                    My husband and I hit a rough patch...
                    I was finally gonna say yes.

                                      ANNIE
                    Remember how he dressed?

                    Work boots and jeans.  Like every
                    other dope in here.  

      Annie watches a few guys get up after lunch.  They head across
      the street to a door with a sign, "Cartwright Construction." 

                                      ANNIE
                    You got a lipstick I can borrow?


        Hole-in-the-wall office, immigrant day-laborers milling. 
      Annie walks in:  Red lipstick, hair up, shirt tied in a knot,
      snapping a piece of gum.  She spots the MANAGER (50s)--

                                      ANNIE
                    Howdy.  Y'all seen my brother, Mason? 

      She shows him the photo.  He looks at it.  Then back at Annie.  

                                      MANAGER
                    Sorry.  Dunno 'im.

      He goes back to work.  Annie takes a breath, "determined."

                                      ANNIE
                    Sir-- I dunno what kinda brother you

                    a heap a money to hand 'im and-- I
                    just gotta find 'im.  Okay?

      Annie puts a few bills on the counter.  A long beat as the

                    But he was always goin' on about
                    Dodge Chargers.  Old ones.  Said it
                    was the only car a man should drive.
                          (oh, what the hell?)

      WHOOSH --


      It's happening again... this time to a YOUNG COUPLE in the

                    It was about Dingos.  The boots.

      A beat.  Then Annie begins to sing softly:

      Kayla goes still at the memory.  Then nods.  That's the one.

                    His voice...

      She can't get the words out.  A beat.  She tries again:

                    ... was nice.

      On Annie, as this twisted truth lands.  She turns to go--

                    He's still out there, isn't he?

      Annie stops.  She faces Kayla, who's struggling to hide just
      how alone she feels right now.  

                                      ANNIE
                    I knew a little girl like you once. 
                    She used to lie in bed at night,
                    wondering the same kinda things you're
                    wondering right now...  
                          (beat)
                    He's out there... But I'm gonna catch
                    him.  So you can sleep at night
                    instead of wondering.

                    We got a deal, kiddo?

                    ... Deal.


      The Task Force is buzzing with activity, all the TFOs (Task
      Force Officers) following leads, staying "balls to the wall"
      during a big case like this.  Luke sniffs the air.  Looks
      under his desk...in the trash.  Daisy and Marco share a look.

                    Mason stopped relying on his luck a

                    Mason works construction.  Maybe he

                    Sure seems like it.  Let's find out
                    who insured both safes.  See if
                    there's a connection.

                    Only traffic to the back was a
                    delivery truck.  Laura went into the

                    they went inside to check and she
                    was gone.  They tracked down the
                    driver and jacked him up.  Says he
                    dropped her off a couple blocks away.

      PAN OFF a "Bollinger Insurance" coffee mug to find Annie and
      Jimmy talking with a MANAGER, a couple of his suited BOSSES
      looking over his shoulder.

                                      ANNIE
                    Mike Edwards and Paul Wilson both
                    had policies with you.  We need to
                    know how Mason Boyle knew about them.

      The manager taps at his computer keyboard throughout:

                    ...Not an employee... Name isn't

                    Sure, some.  Not one of the more
                    reputable companies...

                    Edwards and Wilson-- those houses
                    built by Cartwright?

                                      MANAGER
                    ... Yes.

                    Who was the appraiser for them?

                                      MANAGER
                    Pete Lofgrun... 
                          (looks up, realizing)
                    ... on both.

                    Pete ever go to the houses while
                    they're still under construction?

                                      MANAGER
                    Yes.  He inspects the safes in new
                    builds before we insure them.

                    else you know about Pete Lofgrun--

      WHOOSH --


      Mason is lurking in the back of a truck stop diner.  His
      hair is now black.  PETE LOFGRUN (50s) hurries in, nervous
      as hell.  Takes a beat to recognize Mason, sits down--

                    Hell's wrong with you, Pete?  Sweating
                    like a virgin at a prison rodeo.

                                    PETE LOFGRUN
                    You shot another family.  I'm doing
                    this for my sister's medical bills--
                    and you're killing people--

                                      MASON
                    I got a strict no-witness policy.

                    The U.S. Marshals showed up at my
                    office today.  They're coming for us--

                                      MASON
                    You talk to 'em, Pete?

                                    PETE LOFGRUN
                    Hell no.  Why would I do that?

      Mason stares at him.  Maybe wondering the same thing.

                                    PETE LOFGRUN (CONT'D)
                    Listen, I just need my money.  I

                    You get it at the end, like we said.

      A WAITRESS (30s, fragile) arrives at the table.

                                      TRUCK STOP WAITRESS
                    What'll ya have, boys?

      Mason looks up at her, shifting gears on a dime.  Smiles. 
      Like the break of dawn...

                                      MASON
                    You're what I'll have, darlin'. 
                      Breakfast, lunch and dinner.

      The waitress blushes as Mason stares at her.  It's intense
      and weird but damn if she isn't just a little bit seduced...
      customers at other tables picking up on it... Mason looks
      around, realizing.  Abruptly throws a $20 on the table and
      walks out.  As the waitress straightens herself, she catches
      eyes with a terrified-looking Pete Lofgrun...


      Jimmy drives as Annie talks on her Blackberry--

                    Hey, Wes, looks like this Pete Lofgrun
                    is an accomplice in your murder case. 
                    We're set up on his house, but he's
                    in the wind, no doubt in my mind...
                          (looks at caller I.D.--)
                    Listen, I got the com center calling
                    me... Okay, talk soon.
                          (she clicks over--)
                    It's Annie... 
                          (glances at Jimmy,

                    Put him through... Pete?

                    I know you're looking for me and I
                    wanna come clean.  I never thought
                    anyone was gonna get hurt, I swear. 
                    This guy's a lunatic--

                                      ANNIE
                    It's all gonna work out, Pete.  Just
                    tell me where you are--

      WHOOSH --                                                                                        31.




      Pete gets in his car parked in the truck stop parking lot,
      his nerves shot.  He glances in his rear-view mirror.  And
      there is Mason, staring at him from the back seat.  Before
      Pete can react, Mason has his knife at Pete's neck-- 


      Annie can hear the sickly sound of Mason slicing Pete's neck--

                                      ANNIE
                    Pete?  Pete.


      Pete goes limp.  Mason picks up the fallen cell phone.  Puts
      it to his ear as he gets out of Pete's car, steps over to a
      '68 Dodge Charger, and gets inside...

                                      ANNIE (O.S.)
                    ... Mason?  Is that you?  


      Annie listens to Mason BREATHING-- her mind racing, knows
      she only has a couple seconds-- 

                                      ANNIE
                    Mamas don't let your babies grow up
                    to be cowboys/Cause they'll never
                    stay home and they're always alone/
                    Even with someone they love.


      Mason sits listening as Annie quotes the Waylon Jennings
      song, a little unnerved.  A beat, then:

                                      MASON
                    You don't know me.  


      Back with Annie, she's losing him--

                                      MASON (O.S.)
                    Good-bye, Annie Frost.

      Click.  And as Annie slams down her phone in frustration--

                                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                    I am Mason Boyle... an outlaw cowboy. 
                    They might'a got me the first time,
                    but it ain't gonna happen again. 
                    Not with my prison education.  So as
                    soon as I get out, I look for a gig. 
                    I meet Pete Lofgrun, and I set out
                    to rob 12 safes with a street value
                    of 1.3 million.

                                      JIMMY

                    No, that's retirement money.  That's
                    money with a plan... 

      Annie studies the board... Huntsville State Prison...

                    I pay attention in jail.  I find out
                    Mexico doesn't extradite for capital
                    offenses because of the death penalty.

                    .. I go there and get to know my way
                    around.  I see that with 1.3 million
                    you can live like a king.  Which is
                    what I am.  A king.  

      Annie writes "Mexico" on the board...

      Annie puts a marker in San Antonio, half-way between Houston
      and the Mexican border...

                    Force.  Tell 'em what we got, and to

      WHOOSH --


      A crowded country/western bar in San Antonio, "Ramblin' Fever"
      on the juke box.  Mason is cowering in a back corner, eyes
      scanning the crowd, aware of each and every guest including
      a COWBOY and his GIRL in a nearby booth, paying their bill.  

      Mason spots two UNIFORM COPS through the front window.  He
      tenses, watching their every move.  Till they walk past.  

      Mason downs a bourbon, eats the three Maraschino cherries in
      his glass, and watches as the Cowboy couple heads for the
      parking lot out back.  Mason tosses a bill on the table and
      follows them out to--


      The Cowboy couple driving in their truck.  The girl is
      hysterical, dialing 911 on her cell phone, hands shaking-- 

                                      COWGIRL
                    Some freak just tried to jack our
                    car!  My boyfriend has a gun, thinks
                    he got 'im in the leg.  He ran into
                    the woods behind the Silver Spur... 
                    Six feet, maybe?  Black hair, jeans
                    and a brown hoodie... We're goin' to
                    the police station now--

      --As her boyfriend in his ten-gallon hat GUNS the truck...


      The cowboy's truck comes to a checkpoint at the edge of town.

                                      STATE POLICE
                    Gonna need to see some ID.

      Cowboy and his girl hand their IDs to the cop, who's listening
      to the helicopter chase on his radio.  He waves them through.

                                      STATE POLICE (CONT'D)
                    Be safe now, ya hear?


      Annie's got Mason in her sights.  Ready to take him down.  

      She jumps out of the helicopter-- 

      Flattening Mason to the ground.  Roughly cuffing him. 
      Spinning him onto his back like a prize bull--

      But it's not Mason.  

      It's the cowboy from the Silver Spur in Mason's clothes. 
      Traumatized--

                                      COWBOY
                    He shot me in the leg!  Said he'd
                    shoot my girlfriend if I stopped
                    running!  Where's my girlfriend? 
                    Where's Lizzy?!

      WHOOSH --


      The cowboy's truck speeds down the open road.  Pulls over
      long enough for the driver to kick "Lizzy" to the shoulder.  

      Then the cowboy speeds away, removing his ten-gallon.  And
      as he does we MOVE IN TIGHT ON HIS FACE...  

      Revealing that it is not the cowboy driving.  Never was. 
      It's Mason.  Smiling that smile of his.

                                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                        ACT FOUR

      OVER BLACK:

      The sound of a razor scraping skin...

      WHOOSH --


      Mason finishes shaving his head with a straight-edge razor. 
      He runs his hand over his scalp.  The new feel of it...  


      Annie turns her iPod to "Armed & Dangerous" by Waylon
      Jennings.  Clicks in her headphones.  Presses "play."  As
      the music swells:

      " Annie puts a metal file case on the table.  Opens it like
      it's the Holy Grail.  Inside?   Link Charts of every fugitive
      she's ever caught.  As she flips through them... 


    " Mason uses a glass stopper to put peroxide on his eyebrows,
      bleaching them...  


    " Annie looks at Mason's Link Chart, lining up all the women:
      His mother, Laura Ross, the waitress from Tico's Taco's... 


    " Mason covers his tattoo with thick foundation makeup...  


    " Annie looks at Mason's criminal history.  Focusing on the
      fact that he severed a woman's finger to steal her ring... 


    " Mason dabs some cologne on his neck.  A little behind the
      ears...


    " Annie focuses on "Odessa Christian High School."  She draws
      a new Link Chart box: "High School Girlfriend?"

                                                                          TIME CUT TO:                                                                                        37.




      Annie steps out of the Briefing Room with TOG on the phone--

                                      ANNIE
                    Hey, Alfredo.  Gonna need the Cessna
                    again.  We're looking for a ride to
                    Odessa... Right, thanks.

      Annie hangs up, surprised to find Luke still at his desk.

                                      ANNIE (CONT'D)
                    Gotta sleep at some point, Luke.

                    You don't.

      He's got a point.  Annie smiles.

                                      ANNIE
                    C'mon.  I'll show you where we hide

                    It's where he's from.

                    Mason robbed the first Houston house,
                    then gave the engagement ring to
                    Laura Ross, right?  

                                    LUKE
                    Right.

                    When he cut off the woman's finger
                    to steal her ring?  He was still in
                    high school.

                                      ANNIE
                    Exactly.  So who'd he give that ring

      On Luke, eyes brimming with excitement, and Annie, finding a
      new role:  Mentor.  This could be fun after all.


      Annie, Jimmy and Luke walk down the high school's main
      hallway.  Students turn to look.  Who's in trouble now?


      The female PRINCIPAL (60s, gold cross necklace) hands Annie

                    She never would've dated someone
                    like Mason Boyle.

      Annie opens to Jessie Lyn's senior page:  A portrait, a couple
      candids, and a close-up exposing the "W" tattoo on her neck.

                                      ANNIE
                    Guess Jessie Lyn's got a little outlaw
                    cowboy in her too.  She still live
                    around here?

                                      PRINCIPAL
                    No, she moved away after graduation. 
                    I haven't seen her since.  

      Annie looks at Luke. 

                                      ANNIE
                    Let's go find Mason's first love.

      WHOOSH --


      JESSIE LYN PEELE (now 8 years older), a "Rio Grande Real 

                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        40.

      Estate" pin on her lapel, her "W" tattoo still intact, puts
      a plate of Mexican food down in front of Mason.  Mason opens
      packet after packet of hot sauce, pours it on...

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    Hell'd you do to your hair, Mason? 
                    And your eyebrows-- they're white.

      Mason smiles at her.  

                                      MASON
                    What, it's cool, right?  Did it just
                    for you...

      Jessie Lyn shakes her head... 

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    You call me outta the blue, ask me
                    to bring you food... You gonna tell
                    me what you're doing in El Paso now?

                                      MASON
                    Well it ain't for the tex-mex.

      He shows her that smile again.  Jessie Lyn smiles back.  But
      it's short-lived...

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    Been a long time, Mason.

                                      MASON
                    I wrote you letters, ya know.  All
                    got sent back.  Near broke my heart.

      Jessie Lyn is surprised.

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    I never saw 'em.  Musta been my daddy.
                          (then)
                    How long you stickin' around?

                                      MASON
                    Depends on you.  Hopin' it's awhile.

      Jessie Lyn stares at him for a long beat.  Then gets up and
      retrieves something from the entryway.  An old guitar.

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    Told you I'd watch this for ya...

                                      MASON
                    --You still got it?

      He picks it up, an old friend.  And there's no way he can
      help it, he's got to fire off a quick ditty, fingers like 

                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        41.

      lightening.  He's good.  A glimpse of what could've been...

                                      MASON (CONT'D)
                    I got somethin' for you, too.

      ... He retrieves a distinctive gold necklace.  One we should
        recognize...

                                      MASON (CONT'D)
                    Jessie Lyn.  I spent the last year
                    saving up good so I could come back
                    to you with my head held high.

      ... Almost like he's taking a vow... 

                                      MASON (CONT'D)
                    I know I been missin' a long time. 
                    But if anything teaches you to cherish
                    what you got, it's bein' on the
                    opposite side of freedom.  

      Jessie Lyn studies him.  Then moves closer.  They kiss.

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    ... Now I remember how good you always
                      smelled...

      ... A beat longer, and she gently pushes him away...

                                      JESSIE LYN (CONT'D)
                    You gotta give me some time, okay?

                                      MASON
                    Take as long as you need.  I ain't
                    goin' nowhere...


      A suburban house.  A car with a "Rio Grande Real Estate"
      logo on the side pulls up.  Jessie Lyn gets out and goes
      inside.  PULL BACK to reveal Annie, Jimmy and Luke watching
      from a rental car.  Luke looks at Jessie Lyn's DMV photo--

                                    LUKE
                    That's definitely her.  We gonna
                    jack her up?

                                      ANNIE
                    Can't do it here.  If Mason sees us
                    he'll sky up again...

      Annie pulls out her Blackberry.  Dials the "Rio Grande Real
      Estate" number on the side of the car.



                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        42.

                    husband and I are moving to El Paso
                    and we'd like to look at houses...


      Jessie Lyn walks Annie and Jimmy through the house...

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    So, when are y'all relocating?

                                      ANNIE
                    Next month.  Not much time... How're
                    the schools 'round here?

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    This house is in a great district. 
                    How old are your children?

                                      ANNIE
                    Eight and ten.  

      Annie shows Jessie Lyn a photo of an 8-year-old girl and 10-
      year-old boy (cut out from the magazines).


                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        43.

                    Maggie and Jake.  You have kids too?

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    A girl, Sissy.  She's eight.

      Jessie Lyn shows Annie a photo of an 8-year-old GIRL.  Annie
      studies it.  We see the photo from Annie's perspective... 

                                      ANNIE
                    She has her father's eyes.

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    ... Excuse me?

                                      ANNIE
                    Her eyes, they look exactly like
                    Mason's.

      Jessie Lyn looks at Annie, confused... 

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    ... How do you know Mason?

                                      ANNIE
                    We're not here to look at houses,
                    Jessie Lyn.  We're U.S. Marshals. 
                    We need your help to find him.

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    ... U.S. Marshals? 
                          (a dreadful beat)
                    What did he do?

                                      JIMMY
                    Killed three people in home invasions. 
                    Another two along the way. 

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    Oh God--

      Jessie Lyn searches for a place to put her hands.  Looks
      around the empty house, trying to get her bearings... 

                                      JESSIE LYN (CONT'D)
                    ... I believed him.  I actually
                    believed him...

                                      ANNIE
                    These guys'll tell you anything you
                    wanna hear...

      Jessie Lyn's hand goes to the distinctive gold necklace around
      her neck.  She takes it off, gives it to Annie...


                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        44.

                    This isn't mine... I gave him his
                    old guitar back.  Shoulda known that's
                    all he wanted... 

                                      JIMMY
                    You know where he's staying?

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    The Sun City Hotel.  I just talked
                    to him.  He's in his room right now.


      Annie and Jimmy take the stairs three at a time till they
      reach the fifth floor.  Annie signals to Jimmy.  They break
      out of the stairwell--


      Moving down the hallway to room 509.  Jimmy uses the key
      card to pop the door.  Ducks out of the way as Annie enters
      with the shield.  Jimmy sweeps in after her--                                                                                        45.




      Annie and Jimmy enter, guns drawn.  They search under the
      bed, in furniture, closets.  The room's clear.  

      Annie signals to Jimmy:  Maraschino cherry stems in a glass
      by the bar.  Ice still cold.  

      Jimmy nods to the bathroom door:  The shower is running. 


      They pop the bathroom door.  Sweep in.  Annie opens the shower
      curtain.  The tub's empty.  WTF?


      They scour the room further.  And then they see it.  Mason
      punched his way through a wall in the closet into the
      adjoining room.  One of the rooms Luke just evacuated--

                                      ANNIE
                          (into radio--)
                    He's on the ground!  No one leaves
                    the premises!  And find out who was
                    checked into room 511!


      Annie, Jimmy and Luke watch the security video footage of
      the hallway.  Luke looks like he'd rather be dead. 

      ON THE VIDEO: Luke escorts the woman in the bathrobe and her
      shaved-headed "boyfriend" out of the room Mason punched into.  

      Jimmy turns to Luke, ready to eat him alive--

                                      JIMMY
                    That how you been walkin' 'round
                    here the whole time?  Nice tailored
                    shirt all tucked in?

      Luke's shirt is indeed tucked in, unlike seasoned Deputies
      who always wear lose, untucked shirts to conceal their guns.

                                      JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    Turd must've looked out his window
                    and seen your weapon.

      Jimmy exhales, shakes his head-- walks out.  Luke is crushed.

                                    LUKE
                    You said to look at the different
                    pieces.  The eyebrows... the nose... 

                                      ANNIE
                    Gotta go through the mill, Luke.
                    Can't pick it up overnight...

      Annie's cell phone rings.  She steps out into the--


      Where Jimmy is pacing, letting off steam.  Annie picks up--

                                      ANNIE
                    Annie Frost.
                          (fuck--)
                    We're on our way.

      She hangs up, turns to Jimmy-- 

                                      ANNIE (CONT'D)
                    He took Sissy.  Must've gone straight
                    to the school--

                    Two birds with one stone-- get back
                    at Jessie Lyn, use Sissy to help him
                    cross the border.

                                      JIMMY
                    But she's only eight--

                    He'll use her any way he can.  I
                    know what I'm talking about, okay?

      More forceful than she intended.  Jimmy looks at her.

                                      ANNIE (CONT'D)
                          (then, softer)
                    We gotta find that girl.

                                        ACT FIVE

      WHOOSH --


      Mason is driving a late model pick-up, gardening equipment
      in the back.  He checks addresses as he passes abandoned
        storefronts, looking for a number scribbled on a bar napkin.  

      SISSY, a street-savvy 9-year-old, is in the passenger seat,
      stealing looks at him.  Surprisingly, she doesn't seem scared. 
      More like she's enjoying this adventure with her dad.

                                      SISSY
                    You look different than your picture. 
                    Mom hides it in her wallet, but I
                    know where it is...

      Mason doesn't respond.  Just keeps driving.  

                                      SISSY (CONT'D)
                    She calls you her outlaw cowboy,
                    cause you were in jail and all.  But
                    I can tell she still likes you...
                          (off his silence)
                    You never shut up, do ya?
                          (then)
                    Where're we going anyway?  This
                      neighborhood is lame.  

      Mason looks at her.  Curious.  His blood.  Then finds the
      address, pulls into an alley around the corner. 

                                      SISSY (CONT'D)
                    Why'd you drive past it?  So they
                    wouldn't see you?  Good idea.

                                      MASON
                    Be quiet and-- stay put.  Y'know...
                    like partners.

      A beat.  And Sissy smiles.  The happiest girl in the world.

                                      SISSY
                    I always knew you'd come back.


      CLOSE ON jewels seen through a gem scope.  WIDER as a GEM
      DEALER looks up from the scope.  Glances at Mason-- then at
      the wanted poster under the counter.  He knows Mason's
      vulnerable, is looking to take advantage--



                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        49.

                                      MASON
                    ... Let's see.  That's $95,000 shy
                    of what I'm sellin' 'em for.

                                      ASIAN GEM DEALER
                    Best offer.

      Mason stares at him.  He's been on the run a while and it's
      taken its toll.  Mason pulls out his automatic.

                                      MASON
                    Ya sure 'bout that?

                                      ASIAN GEM DEALER
                          (nerves of steal)
                    Take it or leave it.

                                      MASON
                    Alright.  I'll take it.  

      Mason grabs the cash and the gems as TWO ARMED security guards
      appear.  Mason shoots and misses-- off his game, desperate--
      and bolts as they fire after him--


      Sissy sees Mason running down the alley toward the passenger
      door.  He jumps in, shoves her into the driver's seat.

                                      MASON
                    Drive.

                                      SISSY
                    I don't know how to--  

                                      MASON
                    Drive.

      The look in his eyes, and Sissy does as she's told.  She
      lurches out of the alley, passing one of the security guards
      who's looking for Mason.

      SECURITY GUARD'S POV:  He sees Sissy driving.  No one in the
      passenger seat.  

      BACK INSIDE THE CAR:  Mason is lying on the floor.                                                                                        50.




      VIDEO SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE: The pick-up drives past, Sissy
      at the wheel.  

      PULL BACK to reveal Annie and her team watching the video-
      taped surveillance footage with a technician.

                                      ANNIE
                    See if you can enhance it-- grab the
                    plate.  I need that plate.

      The technician gets to work...

                                      MARCO
                    Why's he taking the kid with him? 
                    Doesn't make any sense--

                                      JIMMY
                    Drop it.  Okay?

      Jimmy glances at Annie.  She meets his look, gratitude in
      her eyes.

                                      ANNIE
                    Three bridges in El Paso alone... 

                                      DAISY
                    Any word from border patrol?

                                    LUKE
                    I'll check again. 

                                      JIMMY
                    Marco-- go with him, will ya?

      Luke gives Jimmy a look, he's never gonna live it down, as
      the technician shows Annie the enhanced surveillance video--

      ON THE VIDEO: ZOOM IN on the license plate...

      WHOOSH --


      Annie looks into a hospital room.  Inside, Kate Edwards is
      recovering, Kayla by her side.  Kayla sees Annie, steps out--

                                      KAYLA EDWARDS
                    Annie... You caught him.

                                      ANNIE
                    Deal's a deal, right?

      Kayla nods, they share a small smile...

                                      ANNIE (CONT'D)
                    Here, something I want you to give
                    your mom...

      Annie gives Kayla the engagement ring Mason took from Kate...

                                      KAYLA EDWARDS
                    Thanks, Annie.

                                      ANNIE
                    You got it, kiddo.

      Kayla hugs Annie, then goes back inside the room and gives
      her mother the ring.  Kate holds it tight, remembering...
      Nods her silent thanks to Annie through the window.  

      Annie nods back, watching mother and daughter, their first
      glimpse of hope... The reason Annie does this job. 


      Luke approaches his desk, recoils-- 

                                    LUKE
                    --the hell?

      Something really stinks.  He starts opening drawers, searching
      for the source.  Finally comes up with an open can of tuna
      fish.  He looks up to see Marco and Daisy, stifling laughs. 

                                    LUKE (CONT'D)
                    Thanks, guys.  Really appreciate it.


                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        57.

      CONTINUED:

      ACROSS THE ROOM

      Annie sits at her desk.  She adds Mason Boyle's completed
      Link Chart to her file case of catches.  A private ritual.

      She stares at the case for a long beat.  Then flips to the
      back.  Pulls out another chart.  

      This one is her father's.  

      She stares at his picture, circa 1985... The nearly empty
      Link Chart... Then focuses on the words, "At large."  As...

                                      CHANTING VOICES (O.S.)
                      Hur-ri-cane!  Hur-ri-cane!


      The team kicks back at Gilley's.  Straw on the floor, beer
      on the table, Charlie Daniel's Band on the speakers.  Jimmy
      is leading the "Hur-ri-cane" chant, directed at Daisy-- 

      Who's riding the mechanical in the middle of it all.  She
      holds on till the end, then jumps down, triumphant.  Annie
      high-fives her as they head back to--

      THEIR TABLE

      Where Jimmy yells to the WAITRESS (SUE, 20s) above the music-- 

                                      JIMMY
                    Round of beef ribs, Sue!

                                    SUE
                    Extra sauce?

                                      JIMMY
                    You bet!

      Sue nods and heads off.  Luke stops her--

                                    LUKE
                    Um, sorry-- you have anything, you
                    know, vegetarian? 

      Sue looks at him blankly.

                                    SUE
                    You mean with pork?  

      Jimmy shakes his head.

                                      JIMMY
                    This is H-Town.  Not Georgetown. 
                    Eat some ribs, Green Bean.

                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        58.

      CONTINUED:

      Luke gives Jimmy a look, as Annie puts a coin on the table. 
      A challenge coin.  Something U.S. Marshals carry wherever
      they go.  Jimmy, Marco and Daisy quickly do the same.  

      Luke looks around the table.  They're all grinning at him. 

                                    LUKE
                    You haven't even given me a coin
                    yet.

                                      ANNIE
                    Sorry, Luke.  As my old friend George
                    Jones once wrote, "There's more old
                    drunks than there are old doctors,
                    so I guess we'd better have another
                    round."  Looks like you're buying.

      And as Luke digs out his wallet...


      CLOSE ON ANNIE'S BOOTS, as our team country line dances on
      the packed dance floor.  Swept up in the beat, the whole
      crowd moving as one.  Clap-step-step.  Clap-step-step. 
      LAUGHING, enjoying the hell out of this.  

      Luke, the outsider for now, watches from the sidelines as:

      WE PUSH IN ON ANNIE'S FACE.  A brief moment of peace.  This
      music, her escape... 

      Until her cell phone rings.  She looks down at it, her whole
      demeanor going serious.  And as the chase begins again--

                                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                        THE END
