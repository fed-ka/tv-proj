The peeper is zooming down a hole, walls of dirt racing by on
all sides.
The peeper is falling down, down, down.
The whole way
screaming like a five-year old girl.
PEEPER'S POV
We see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the
peeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire.
He
SCREAMS.
Looks like an American teenager's room - models, a dresser,
heavy metal posters (tons of OZZY stuff) everywhere (but no
bed - Devils don't sleep).
Nicky is air guitaring to the
song.
Over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled
"NICKY'S MONSTER METAL MIX."
The head demon, JIMMY THE DEMON, opens the door, scaring
NICKY who falls backward into the table, breaking it.
NICKY
(embarrassed)
Hey...
JIMMY THE DEMON
Your father wants to see you and your
brothers in the throne room.
NICKY
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is
rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
ADRIAN and CASSIUS are playing darts.
They're aiming for
people's faces that are coming through the wall.
CASSIUS
I knew it.
He's finally retiring.
ADRIAN
I've been waiting on this day for ten
thousand years.
He throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead.
HUMAN DARTBOARD
Aaaah!
CASSIUS
If the old man picks me to take over
Hell, I'll keep the torture going twenty
four seven.
No breaks.
ADRIAN
Well Dad says it's the breaks that make
the torture.
You have to let people
feel a sense of relief.
Cassius whips a dart which hits one of the HUMAN DARTBOARDS
in the eye.
HUMAN DARTBOARD
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
ADRIAN
Then again, the beauty of Dad retiring
is what he says doesn't matter anymore.
Cassius pulls out the dart.
The eye comes with it.
CASSIUS
I'll take that.
Cassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it.
THWACK!
It splatters like a grape.
HUMAN DARTBOARD
Was that really necessary?
Nicky enters sheepishly.
CASSIUS
Hey, how's Daddy's little girl doing
today?
NICKY
Good, thanks.
Cassius snaps his fingers in Nicky's face.
CASSIUS
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Wanna mind wrestle?
Cassius' eyes start glowing red.
NICKY
Actually, I'll take a rain check on0
Nicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible
force.
CASSIUS
Got ya!
NICKY
(picking up his head)
Yes, you got me...
Nicky's head slams back down again.
CASSIUS
Got ya, again!
NICKY
(picking head up)
Got me for sure, yes...
He grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the
head.
CASSIUS
Got ya!
Now here's the big finish...
Nicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his
own crotch.
NICKY
Oh no.
Please Cassius...
Nicky's hand is being possessed.
It gets closer and closer
until it latches on to Nicky's crotch.
NICKY (CONT'D)
Aaaaah.
Cassius concentrates even harder, making Nicky twist his own
hand.
Nicky screams even louder.
Adrian smiles.
They don't
notice that DAD, wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small
devil horns), enters behind them.
DAD
What are you boys doing?
Cassius releases Nicky's hand.
NICKY
Nothing, Dad.
Just re-arranging the
furniture.
DAD
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out
of your brother's mind?
CASSIUS
I forgot.
DAD
Maybe this will help you remember.
Dad's eyes flash red and Cassius punches himself hard in the
nose, sending him back against the wall and down to the
floor.
Dad gives Nicky a wink.
Nicky smiles.
Dad has an air of
confidence and power.
DAD (CONT'D)
Now everybody sit down.
NICKY
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying
down my monsters of metal compilation
tape.
I really think it's a
masterpiece.
DAD
Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
He leads the boys to the throne area.
We see outside the
window the peeper staring in sexily.
Dad looks, shakes his
head.
Just then, THE BIRD appears and attacks him.
Dad
closes the curtains.
Nicky, Adrian and Cassius sit on little stools at the foot of
his throne.
Dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip
of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at
his three sons.
DAD (CONT'D)
My dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was
thrown out of Heaven by G-d and rules
here in hell for ten thousand years.
And after this ten thousand years had
passed, he decided to abdicate his
throne...
Confused, Nicky sheepishly raises his hand.
DAD (CONT'D)
...to step aside.
(Nicky lowers his hand)
...and let me become the ruler of hell.
This, as some of you might know, is my
ten thousandth year as Prince of
Darkness.
So I think the time has come
to discuss who will succeed me.
Jimmy the Demon walks in.
JIMMY THE DEMON
Knock, knock.
DAD
Yes, Jimmy.
He whispers in Dad's ear.
DAD (CONT'D)
No, no, that's not what I said.
He can
keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta
go.
JIMMY THE DEMON
(turning to leave)
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a
pineapple up Hitler's ass at four
o'clock.
Dad nods, and Jimmy shuffles out.
Dad turns his attention
back to his sons.
DAD
This was a very difficult decision,
because I have three wonderful sons.
I
mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless.
And Cassius, so strong, so tough.
And
Nicky, so...so...
NICKY
Don't worry about coming up with
anything.
It's cool.
DAD
Such a sweet boy.
But after much
thought and careful consideration, I've
decided that the ruler for the next ten
thousand years is going to have to
be...me.
CASSIUS AND ADRIAN
(dumbfounded)
What!?
NICKY
Hallelujah.
They all look at Nicky.
NICKY (CONT'D)
I mean...tough break.
DAD
The important thing for the stability of
our rule is to maintain the balance
between good and evil.
And I don't
think any of you are ready for that
responsibility yet.
You need the wisdom
that comes only with the passage of
time.
CASSIUS
Dad!
This is Hoyashit.
Dad glares.
Cassius goes FLYING BACK.
One of the Human
Dartboards laughs.
Cassius whips a dart and hits him in the
tongue.
Jimmy enters and points at his watch.
DAD
Right.
Right.
Send him in.
(to the boys)
I'm sorry, boys.
I've got to get back
to work.
Nicky, Cassius and Adrian start filing out.
Adrian stops.
ADRIAN
You sure about this decision, Dad?
DAD
I'm telling you, pal, it's the right
thing to do.
HITLER (in a French maid's outfit), is being brought in by
Jimmy.
They head towards the closet.
Inside the closet is a crate of pineapples.
Hitler picks out
a relatively small one.
Dad shakes his head "no."
Dad walks
over to the closet.
Hitler picks out a really big pineapple.
Dad nods "yes."
Hitler sadly hands it to Dad.
Jimmy bends
Hitler over and as Dad raises the fruit...
CLOSE ON HITLER'S EYES
As the pineapple's jammed up his ass.
HITLER
Holy schnit!!
Dad and Nicky are listening to one of Nicky's metal mix
tapes.
We hear the end of Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb."
Pause.
Dad exhales.
DAD
Now that was an experience.
"You are
only coming through in waves."
That
line blows my mind every time.
NICKY
Definitely.
DAD
I don't care what kind of mood you're in
at the start of that song.
When it's
over, that mood has been altered.
Wow.
Great shit.
What's next?
NICKY
Well, I thought that after messing with
your head, I'd give you a little kick in
the keester.
Hits the tape player.
"Enter Sandman" blasts.
DAD
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
NICKY
Metallica, Dad.
Come on.
DAD
I was just playing with you.
Dad and Nicky dance to the song.
CLOSE ON DAD.
DAD
I'm sorry.
After careful consideration,
I regretfully have to decline.
ON PERSON HE'S TALKING TO: DAN MARINO.
DAN
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one
Superbowl ring.
DAD
In exchange for eternal damnation of
your soul?
You're too nice of a guy for
me to want to do that to you, Mr.
Marino.
DAN
You did it for Namath.
DAD
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways.
Just go back to Earth and enjoy your
records and the Hall of Fame and the
beautiful family and all that.
DAN
This is bullshit, man.
(gets up to leave)
I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year,
with or without you!
DAD
Now you're talking.
Dan exits.
NICKY
You're a good devil, Dad.
DAD
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
Nicky and Dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint
sirens.
The Gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his
knees.
GATEKEEPER
Your highness, Cassius and Adrian have
escaped from hell.
They went through
the fire, and they broke it.
I think
they took the New York tunnel.
I tried
to stop them, but they overpowered me,
sir.
DAD
Oh, boy.
Oh boy.
Calm down.
Get off
your knees.
The Gatekeeper stands up.
GATEKEEPER
Thanks for being so understanding, your
worship.
You're the man.
You've always
been the man.
Dad's EYES GLOW RED as the Gatekeeper stands up.
Two huge
boobs grow out of either side of the Gatekeeper's head.
We
only see them from the front for a second.
From behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the
nipples as he talks to Nicky.
GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
(to Nicky)
I'm lucky to get away with just the head
boobs, right?
NICKY
Coulda been much worse.
GATEKEEPER
That's what I'm thinkin'...
Dad is staring off.
He looks shaken.
DAD
This is bad, Nicky.
NICKY
How bad?
DAD
I'm gonna die, Nicky.
If the gates are
broken, no new souls can get in, which
means I'll start to deteriorate into
nothing.
GRANDPA LUCIFER enters.
LUCIFER
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
DAD
Everything's fine, pop.
LUCIFER
Last time you said that the renaissance
happened.
DAD
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
LUCIFER
(regarding gateskeeper)
Can I take him with me and have sex with
his head?
DAD
Sure, pop.
Whatever you want.
The gatekeeper walks towards Lucifer.
GATEKEEPER
Oh, this is gonna be a whole new
lifestyle for me, isn't it.
A SIGN: 42ND ST. GRAND CENTRAL
PAN DOWN to the darkened bowels of the old station, between
two tracks, to a putrid puddle.
Nicky breaks through the
surface, sputtering.
We hear a rumbling in the near
distance.
NICKY
Okay. Earth.
The Blue Marble.
This
doesn't look too bad.
Nicky sees a fast approaching light, furrows his brow and
WHAMMM!
Nicky makes it back through the hole.
Looks both ways and
hops out of the hole.
He carefully crosses the tracks and is
stopped by the sight of a bulldog, BEEFY, on the other side.
In his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to
identify their passengers at the airport.
On the sign is
scrawled "NICKY."
Nicky and Beefy stare at each other a beat.
NICKY
I'm Nicky.
Beefy drops the sign from his mouth.
BEEFY
(voice of Sandy Wernick)
Hey, terrific!!
Now get off the track
and come with me, shitstains.
The throng of commuters making their way through the terminal
are giving a wide berth to the filthy man who's looking
around suspiciously, talking to the dog.
BEEFY
My name's Beefy.
I'm an old friend of
your father's.
He's asked me to help
you out.
NICKY
I just need to find my brothers and be
on my way, Beefy.
BEEFY
It's not gonna be easy.
Your brothers
can possess people.
So they probably
won't look like themselves.
You have to
be suspicious of everyone.
Nicky looks at Beefy warily for a beat.
NICKY
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...
(pulling out the flask)
Just get in the bottle.
Just slide
right on in there.
BEEFY
It's not me, moron.
NICKY
Oh.
Sorry.
The Monster is rubbing the gatekeeper's boobs.
The
gatekeeper is wearing a modified bra.
He seems to be
enjoying it.
We hear a THUD.
They look down to see Nicky on
the ground.
(We didn't see him flying through this time.)
The Monster and Gatekeeper immediately stop.
Kind of
embarrassed.
GATEKEEPER
Hey.
NICKY
That's a pretty brassiere.
GATEKEEPER
Thanks.
NICKY
Could you maybe not tell anyone about
this?
GATEKEEPER
You got it.
Could you maybe not tell
anyone about this?
NICKY
You got it.
Nicky turns and walks toward the firewall.
As soon as his
back is turned, the monster pantomimes to the Gatekeeper, "I
love your boobs."
The Gatekeeper gives a flirtatious laugh
(we don't see him morph back through the wall here.).
Beefy is sitting on a bench/booth at a strip club.
Champagne
is on the table.
Bills in his mouth.
We see THREE DANCERS
dancing for him.
FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:
A scruffy, thirtyish buy, TODD (Allen Covert), is on the
phone in his small, bohemian apartment in the Village.
TODD
(on phone)
I know exactly how you feel... The night
Reagan was elected, I said to my mother,
"Is this man going to blow up the world,
Mommy?"
Then we both cried for like an
hour.
(knock at the door)
Somebody's here.
Call you later.
Todd gets up and opens the door.
It's Nicky, with Beefy by
his side.
Nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced.
NICKY
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky.
I
understand you're seeking a roommate, as
per your advertisement in the Village
Voice.
Would it be possible for me to
fill the slot?
TODD
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent
is?
Nicky looks down at Beefy.
Beefy looks up at Nicky.
Both
nod imperceptibly.
NICKY
Yes.
What is rent?
TODD
Eight-hundred, split down the middle.
Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with
my scene partner so the living room will
be off limits.
NICKY
Off limits.
TODD
Right.
And as far as household items:
we can share the soap, but we'll split
the cost 60/40.
Cause the person who physically goes out
and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay
as much as the other guy.
(looks at Nicky)
Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
NICKY
No.
TODD
It's like eighty degrees in this
hallway.
You from the South?
NICKY
Yeah.
The deep South.
Nicky laughs a little too hard.
TODD
Why is that funny?
NICKY
I don't know.
TODD
And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
Todd turns and goes into the apartment.
BEEFY
You'll be alright.
Go on.
Big day
tomorrow.
Don't forget to do that sleep
thing I told you about.
NICKY
Got ya.
(to Todd)
Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
TODD
Yeah, your bedroom is right over there.
The door closes.
Beefy looks down at the welcome mat.
It
reads: I "heart" METHOD ACTING.
Beefy raises his leg over
it.
Nicky is sleeping on top of the hissing radiator, fully
clothed.
When he inhales through his nose, we hear that
familiar snoring/snorting sound.
But when he exhales, we
hear disturbing "speaking-in-tongues", Exorcist-style voices.
SLOW PAN across the room to the doorway where Todd stands,
looking concerned.
CLOSE ON an ELDERLY, kind looking CARDINAL.
He ascends the
steps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation.
We see that TV cameras are covering the SUNDAY service.
He
gins his homily.
CARDINAL
In today's gospel, the Lord tells us who
we are to live if we wish to attain the
splendor of Heaven... or something like
that.
Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in
the Bible.
Moses this.
Moses that.
Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.
The crowd stares dumbfounded.
We see that the Cardinal is
standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box
with the top open.
CARDINAL (CONT'D)
Yep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of
hibbity-jibbity.
But has he ever really
done anything for us?
Has he ever put a
Jaguar XJR in my driveway?
Has he ever
given any of my enemies the herpes?
No.
He hasn't done a damn thing for any of
us.
A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stands up.
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
The Lord gave my son the strength to get
off drugs.
CARDINAL
Ma'am, I know your son, and believe me,
he was better off on drugs.
He's a
bore.
At least when he was smoking
hashish, he made me laugh occasionally.
A YOUNG MAN and his PREGNANT WIFE stand up.
YOUNG MAN
After we tried for many years, the Lord
finally helped my wife conceive a baby.
CARDINAL
No, your best friend Fitzie helped your
wife conceive a baby.
He helped her
conceive it all night long.
Fitzie, who's sitting on the other side of the Wife, starts
to "raise the roof."
Then thinks better of it.
The Cardinal
points to a well-dressed man in the front pew.
CARDINAL (CONT'D)
How about you, Mr. Mayor?
The Lord ever
do anything for you?
The Mayor has tinfoil on his feet.
MAYOR
(standing)
Well, I wish I could think of something,
Cardinal, but to be honest with you, I
can't.
Kind of makes you wonder if
there even is a Lord.
If there is any
ultimate punishment for our so-called
"sins."
Maybe we should all just have
fun and do whatever the hell we want.
A hubbub is raised by the crowd.
Fitzie raises the roof
again, this time energetically.
CARDINAL
Amen to that.
Let the sin begin!
The hubbub grows to a roar.
Several PEOPLE start fighting
over the money in the collection plate.
The Cardinal smiles knowingly at the Mayor.
We hear the
Cardinal's thoughts - in Adrian's voice.
ADRIAN (O.S.)
Oh, this is delicious.
ON MAYOR
He's smirking.
WE HEAR his telepathic response.
CASSIUS (O.S.)
(laughing)
"Let the sin begins" - that was a good
one.
ADRIAN (O.S.)
Well, we must get people sinning if we
want to fill up our New Hell.
How are
things going down at City Hall?
CASSIUS (O.S.)
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
ADRIAN (O.S.)
Brilliant.
This is so much fun.
I
never want it to end.
CASSIUS (O.S.)
Why should it end?
Who's gonna stop us?
The Mayor/Cassius laughs.
As he does, his eyes slowly cross.
Nicky gets to the front of the line and tries to get the
Cashier to drink.
The Cashier yanks his head away and gives
Nicky a dirty look.
Nicky shrugs and points to the menu,
ordering some chicken.
Beefy is looking around for Nicky.
He spots him - inside the
polar bear cage.
Nicky approaches the bear holding the
flask.
Nicky shoots through the firewall, having been killed again.
The Gatekeeper is wearing tassels on his boobs.
GATEKEEPER
Bus?
NICKY
Beast.
The Monster laughs.
GATEKEEPER
(to Monster)
You like that?
You think that's funny?
The Gatekeeper swirls his tassels.
GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
How about that?
You like that?
The Monster howls with delight.
Dan Rather speaks to the camera.
Over his shoulder we see a
graphic of the Arch-Decon's face.
NOTE (Arch-Decon is a made
up religious figure that appeared earlier in the script.)
DAN RATHER
Reverberations from Arch-Decon
Donnelly's shocking speech are still
being felt throughout the city.
Today,
some disgruntled cast members of the
play CATS broke the fourth wall in a
most hostile manner.

A few CATS are down in the aisle physically pushing around
shocked audience members.

...But even that does not come close to
what happened today on Live with Regis

VIDEO FOOTAGE
The set of Regis and Kathy Lee.
REGIS
So I was driving to work today, and some
bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
KATHY LEE
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
REGIS
So I followed him...
KATHY LEE
You followed him?
REGIS
I followed him all the way downtown, and
when he gets out of the car, I reach
under my seat and pull out an aluminum
bat.
KATHY LEE
You keep a bat under your seat?
REGIS
Recently, yes!
So I run up behind this
guy, and start bashing his brains in
with this bat, and it made me feel
happy!
Did you ever see THE
UNTOUCHABLES?
KATHY LEE
Yes, great movie...
REGIS
I was DeNiro!
The blue haired lady AUDIENCE is crying.
The TV turns off.
We PULL BACK to see that we are in.
Beefy turns to Nicky.
BEEFY
Your brothers are upsetting the balance
of good and evil.
NICKY
What can I do about it?
BEEFY
You can't do jack shit... unless you
learn your evil powers.
NICKY
Nobody's as evil as my brothers.
Those
dudes put the wick in wicked.
BEEFY
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
NICKY
But those are my roommate's sodas...
BEEFY
(high-pitched mocking)
"But those are my roommate's sodas..."
Does that sound like a statement the son
of the devil would make?
Nicky, ashamed, gets a Coke out of the fridge and places it
on the coffee table.
He and Beefy sit on the couch and stare
at the Coke.
BEEFY (CONT'D)
You have the power to change the cola in
that can into any other liquid - engine
oil, bat's blood, moose piss.
You just
have to release the evil within you.
NICKY
Release the evil?
BEEFY
I'm just saying, there's wickedness in
you... I can tell from your snores.
Nicky stares at the can.
BEEFY (CONT'D)
Release your evil...
Nicky frowns and bites his lip.
The can rattles a little.
TODD
What are you doing?
Todd is standing in the doorway.
Beefy runs to the fire
escape.
*******************
TODD (CONT'D)
I know it's your living room night.
But
can I finish watching the Globetrotters'
game out here?
To me it's classic
Comedia Dellarte.
CUT TO:
The TV clicks on.
We see TODD sit down and look at the TV.
Nicky's behind him.
ON TV
BILL WALTON
What an odd game, folks.
The powerhouse
85-0 Harlem Globetrotters, who normal
run circles around the 0-85 Nationals,
seem to be struggling to find their
groove in front of their hometown fans.
A Globetrotter makes a fancy pass to another player, who
makes a fancy pass to CORNROWS who starts doing some VINTAGE
GLOBETROTTERS FANCY DRIBBLING.
The REF blows the whistle and
makes the travelling signal.
REF
He's walking, get him a bus!
BILL WALTON
Oh, another awful call.
There is no way
that was travelling.
Ref takes ball from Cornrows, who gets in the Ref's face.
CORNROWS
What's with all these crazy calls?
You
gotta watch that shit, we haven't lost a
game in 53 years.
REF
Technical foul!
Ref snaps just like Cassius in the players' face.
ON TODD AND NICKY
NICKY
That guy in the striped shirt snaps his
fingers like someone I know...
ON TV
The ref mind wrestles four globetrotters to simultaneously
slam their heads on the scorers table again and again.
ON TODD AND NICKY
NICKY (CONT'D)
It looks like the work of a brother...
TODD
A black guy?
NICKY
If it's Cassius, yes.
Nicky races for the door.
As the ref taunts the crowd, a fan wearing a Globetrotter's
shirt yells out.
GLOBETROTTER FAN
Get your head out your ass, ref!
The
kids came to see the Globetrotters win.
REF
Oh, so you wanna lip off to me?
Unsportsmanlike conduct on the big mouth
in the Globetrotter's shirt.
Take ten
points off for the Globetrotters.
The Globetrotter's score on the board goes from 46 to 36.
ON STANDS
The KIDS are crying.
ON COURT
The halftime buzzer sounds.
The Globetrotters walk off the
court.
The crowd BOOS.
BILL WALTON
In all my years of basketball, I was
never so happy to hear a halftime
buzzer.
Folk, I'm afraid if the second
half doesn't get any better, I expect a
full scale riot.
A spotlight points to an announcer at mid-court.
COURT ANNOUNCER
It's time for the Globetrotter's
halftime half-court heave throw, where
one lucky fan will have a shot at ten
thousand dollars!
A brick lands at the announcer's feet.
COURT ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
And if he makes it, everyone in
attendance today will receive a free
pizza.
MIGUEL, wearing a big basketball jersey, looks nervous.
He
has a pass on.
MIGUEL
I ain't goin' out there and taking the
shot.
These people have gone crazy.
NICKY
I'll take the shot.
As Nicky runs out on the court, Peter turns to John.
PETER
Look who's back from the dead.
JOHN
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
They high-five.
The only happy fans in their section.
Todd's baffled, looking at his roommate on TV.
Beefy is
watching from the fire escape.
TODD
What's Nicky doing down there?
BEEFY
Trying to capture his brother in a flask
and preserve the balance of good and
evil on Earth.
Todd looks over, suspicious.
TODD
Did you just talk?
BEEFY
No.
The court announcer covers his mic and whispers to Nicky.
COURT ANNOUNCER
You better win these people some free
pizza.
Looks like they're about to
start killing each other.
STANDS
A BUSINESSMAN pushes a very old SODA GUY down an aisle of
stairs.
COURTSIDE
The court announcer hands Nicky the ball.
He looks at it.
NICKY
Release the evil.
His eyes get red.
Staring at the ball, it explodes.
NICKY (CONT'D)
Okay, too much evil..
Bill Walton's hair is on fire.
BILL WALTON
I think that ball just blew up.
And
yes, my hair is aflame.
NICKY
(turning to sideline)
Could I get another ball?
The court announcer throws out another ball.
Nicky stares at
it again with red eyes.
NICKY (CONT'D)
I command you not to blow up and go into
that metal circle.
Nicky throws an underhand shot.
The ball arcs through the
air and is about to go in when the ref comes out of nowhere
and swats it away.
REF
Get that crap outta here!
The crowd BOOS!
Nicky and the ref stare at each other.
NICKY (O.S.)
I know you're having fun, Cassius, but
you gotta come back to Hell.
CASSIUS (O.S.)
Look around you, Nicky.
We're in Hell.
The New Hell.

We see FITZIE, sitting between TWO PREGNANT WOMEN, raising
the roof.

As the crowd BOOS, Nicky runs over and grabs the microphone.
NICKY
Listen up, New York.
Your souls are in
great danger...
Nicky gets hit by a hot dog.
NICKY (CONT'D)
Alright, how about this?
I get one more
shot.
The ref will cover me.
I miss
it, the Globetrotters forfeit the game.
I make it, he doesn't ref the second
half and we all start conducting
ourselves like decent human beings
again.
The crowd is silent.
NICKY (CONT'D)
And we get free pizza.
The crowd roars.
Bill Walton's hair is now burnt looking.
BILL WALTON
I think it's safe to say we're all
rooting for this bizarre and hideous
looking man.
Bill Walton reaches over to an old lady sitting near him.
He
takes off her wig, leaving behind her bald head, and puts her
wig on his head in order to cover his burnt hair.
The crowd starts YELLING.
CROWD
Nicky!
Nicky!
Nicky!
STANDS
John and Peter are yelling the loudest.
COURTSIDE
The ref walks to half-court and hands Nicky the ball.
NICKY
You know, Dad got very sick when you
left.
REF
I heard.
I'm glad he's dying.
It's my
turn now.
Nicky's eyes get red, he starts dribbling.
Beefy is watching, transfixed.
BEEFY
Take him to the hole, Nicky.
(Todd stares)
I mean, woof!
Woof!
Todd looks at Beefy, terrified.
We see CORNROWS and some other Globetrotters are coming back
from the locker room.
They stop to watch.
Nicky pushes the ball up the court while the ref plays
extremely tight defense.
Nicky fakes one way, then heads
toward the basket.
The ref stays tight.
Nicky's eyes are
redder than ever.
He fakes left, he fakes right.
He
dribbles behind the back, dribbles between the legs, then
takes his momentum up toward the basket.
He jumps from the
foul line and flies through the air.
He emits a crazy, blood
curdling, devil yell.
CUT AWAY DURING DEVIL YELL TO:
SHOT CLOCK
It reads: 666.
Popcorn and sodas EXPLODE.
Cornrow's cornrows POP open into a GIANT AFRO.
BACK ON NICKY
Nicky's head starts turning and does a 360 (like the
Exorcist).
He ends his flight by slamming down a thunderous
dunk, cracking the backboard's glass into pieces.
He hits
the ref on the way down.
The crowd CHEERS, finally happy
again.
NICKY
Never doubt my skills.
CORNROWS
Damn, I gotta learn how to do that.
MID-COURT
Nicky sees the ref is lying on the basketball arena floor,
covered in glass.
He gets up slowly
REF
That's nuts.
When'd you learn that
shit?
NICKY
Sorry, Cassius.
Maybe it was the super
devil juice Dad gave me.
HE thought I
might need it for just such an occasion.
REGIS
Super devil juice?
Give it over.
Let's
go best two out of three.
NICKY
(pulls out the flask)
No.
No way.
Dad said it was only for
me.
The ref rips the flask from Nicky and drinks.
Cassius screams like bloody hell as he is sucked out of the
ref's mouth and into the bottle.
WHOOSH!
The ref slumps to
the floor.
STANDS
Still quiet until John and Peter rush to Nicky and bow.
COURTSIDE
Nicky peers into the flask.
CASSIUS (O.S.)
Damn you, Nicky!
There ain't no super
devil juice in here!
Nicky caps the flask.
Nicky waves to the stunned, but
appreciative crowd.
A homemade cake is laid out.
It reads: CONGRATULATIONS,
NICKY.
JOHN, TODD, PETER AND BEEFY are there.
TODD
So your father's the devil, you're a
talking dog sent from Hell, and you guys
are who?
PEEPER
Just a couple of big fans of Nicky and
the work his Dad does.
JOHN
By the way, Nicky.
Check this out.
He spins his Black Sabbath backwards.
JOHN (CONT'D)
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
NICKY
Absolutely nothing.
The Blizzard always
came straight with his messages.
But
wrap your minds around this one.
Nicky gets up and we see his is sitting on a hibachi.
He pus
on a James Taylor album and plays it backwards.
VOICE
I command you in the name of the Lucifer
to spread the blood of the innocent.
John and Peter look at each other, shocked.
JOHN
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
TODD
I gotta say this cake tastes a little
funny.
PETER
Oh, I dumped a fat sack of reefer in the
mix.
Tried to spice up the bash.
Nicky takes a big bite of cake.
NICKY
What's reefer?
DISSOLVE TO:
PAN UP from Popeye's laying everywhere.
Everyone's laughing
hard.
JOHN
Come on.
One more time.
NICKY
Not again, fellas.
It kind of hurts.
PETER
Please.
You got to.
NICKY
(resigned)
All right...
Nicky loosens up his neck and makes his head go around 360
degrees.
Everyone cracks up, high fives.
Even Todd LAUGHS.
PAN OVER to Beefy, who has bloodshot eyes.
BEEFY
I used to get baked like this with my
first girlfriend, Heather.
We'd get so
stoned she would forget I was a dog.
JOHN
She was human?
BEEFY
Actually, she was a sewer rat.
Man,
that pissed my parents off.
JOHN
I dated a Japanese girl once.
My
parents disapproved.
Not cause she's
Japanese, but cause she was only
fifteen.
NICKY
I'm only fifteen...thousand years old.
Everyone cracks up.
TODD
I was in love one time but she said I
wasn't financially reliable enough.
And
she needed that.
JOHN
By she, do you mean he?
TODD
No.
BEEFY
Busted.
(laughs)
PETER
How you feelin' over there, Satan Abdul
Jabar?
NICKY
A little strange.
I can't stop thinking
about this girl, Valerie.
TODD
Why?
Did she hurt you?
Do you miss
her?
Need a shoulder to cry on?
JOHN
Easy, Liberace.
TODD
Oh, would you grow up.
NICKY
We had the greatest afternoon of my life
until Adrian made me tell her she had a
heart-shaped ass.
BEEFY
Maybe you love her.
But what do I know?
I'm baked out of my mind.
PETER
Me, too.
We're gonna get going.
TODD
You guys want to stay?
I have a futon
in my bedroom.
JOHN
That's a big pass, Elton John.
PETER
We're going to see Ozzy play at the
Meadowlands, right now.
Wanna come,
Nicky?
NICKY
No thanks.
I'm afraid I wouldn't be
able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
JOHN
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal,
then.
Later on.
NICKY
See ya, fellas.
They leave.
BEEFY (O.S.)
You better snap out of it soon, kid.
Cause we're going after Adrian tomorrow.
Seven AM.
Nighty, night.
He falls asleep and starts snoring.
We hear the SOUND of
THREE LITTLE GIRLS singing "Ring Around The Rosie" as he
exhales.
TODD
That is the most frightening thing I
have ever seen.
Nicky stands and moves to the window.
He looks out longingly
over the sleeping city... achingly.
RACK FOCUS behind him,
we see Todd nodding encouragingly in the reflection.
NICKY
Todd.
Which way to the Parson's School
of Design?
A STUDENT is standing in the window draped in silks, feeling
his nipples with his legs crossed like the guy in "Silence of
the Lambs."
The student is startled.
STUDENT
Hello.
NICKY
You smell like coconuts.
STUDENT
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific."
Makes me
feel like a hula girl.
Which is kinda
what I'm going for.
Wanna come in?
NICKY
No thanks.
I'm looking for a girl named
Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
STUDENT
Valerie Doran?
Two floors up, one
window over.
NICKY
Thanks, much.
Good luck with the
genital tucking.
STUDENT
I don't need luck.
I'm good.
Nicky floats away.
A few seconds later, he floats back,
holding up the flask.
NICKY
Adrian?
STUDENT
Andrew.
Nicky nods and floats off.
Cool music.
She is up late.
Working by candlelight on a
fantastic design.
Something's not working.
She drapes a
beautiful fabric over another.
She smiles at the
combination.
She is happy being creative.
Nicky feels his
heart swell as he watches her.
ON NICKY
He's so enraptured he leans forward trying to kiss her.
His
head bumps the window.
She turns, startled.
She sees the
beaming Nicky.
NICKY
Hey.
VALERIE
Nicky?
Oh my G-d.
Stay right there.
Pause.
Valerie opens the window and sprays a can of mace
right in Nicky's face.
NICKY
Oh that stings!
My eyes are on fire!
Nicky stands up and stumbles around.
VALERIE
What were you thinking coming here?
NICKY
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve
getting blinded with poison.
He bounces off the front rail, stumbles backward and goes
flying over the back rail.
Beefy and Todd are watching TV.
They look over to see the
insects scurry under the front door and morph back into one
exhausted Nicky.
NICKY
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
BEEFY
The shit has hit the fan, kid.
Take a
look.
TODD
Been breaking all morning.
ON THE TV - DAY
We see Dan Rather addressing the camera.
DAN RATHER
At a news conference earlier today,
Chief of Police Andy Shaifer gave this
beleaguered city its latest dose of bad
news.
He revealed that the man who
caused a sensation at basketball arena
last night is no hero... he is, in fact,
a mass murderer.
We see the chief of police behind a bunch of mics.
He's
holding up a picture of Nicky taken at the Basketball arena.
Nicky's outraged.
NICKY
I didn't murder anybody
BEEFY
Look.
You were really high.
Things
happen.
NICKY
I was with Valerie, I swear.
This is
Adrian's work.
I've got to find him.
BEEFY
I think you're looking at him.
ON THE TV - DAY
We reveal that the chief is standing on a grilled-cheese
press to keep him warm.
CHIEF OF POLICE
(on TV)
This video shows what he did after he
left the basketball arena yesterday...
ON THE VIDEOTAPE - DAY
Scarface shooting his AK-47.
Nicky's face has been crudely
superimposed over his.
GUY
(Adrian's voice)
My name's Nicky, and I'm gonna kill all
you suckers for no reason!
CUT TO FOOTAGE on "SCARFACE"
ON TV - DAY
The Chief shakes his head.
CHIEF OF POLICE
Difficult to watch, I know.
In response
to this vicious crime, I am authorizing
the largest reward in law enforcement
history: fifty million dollars to the
person or persons who bring this man to
me.
Nicky stands outraged.
NICKY
This is baloney!
BEEFY
He superimposed your head onto
"Scarface."
TODD
...which is by far DePalma's best
work...
A LOUD KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
The pounding increases.
NICKY
I'm not Nicky.
I'm not home!
I don't
live here!
PETER
Dude, it's us.
Let us in.
Nicky opens the door.
Peter and John stumble in.
JOHN
There's like a total mob scene coming
this way.
We hear VOICES of an approaching crowd coming outside.
NICKY
I thought for sure I gave 'em the slip.
Todd i s looking out the window.
TODD
Looks like they're following a giant
trail of bug shit.
PETER
What'll we do now, Beefy?
BEEFY
I don't know, this is a little out of my
league.
VOICES GROW LOUDER.
VOICES (O.S.)
Come on.
Let's get 'em.
JOHN
What would your dad do, Nicky?
NICKY
Good idea...kill me.
PETER
Dude.
Seriously?
NICKY
Yes.
I'll meet you at Grand Central at
noon.
Okay.
Do me.
I command you.
JOHN AND PETER
(psyched)
Alright!
John takes Nicky's head and slams it hard into the kitchen
counter.
Nicky is dazed.
NICKY
That just hurt a lot.
TODD
I've always wanted to kill someone.
Can
I do it?
JOHN
Look at Queen Latifah steppin' up.
Nicky is in the bathtub being angrily drowned by Todd.
John
and Peter watch happily.
TODD
Die, Grandma, die!
Nicky's arm comes out with a thumbs up.
Pause.
The hand
drops back in.
He's dead.
Start on a CLOSE UP of Lucifer.
He's holding cards, looking
at his hand.
LUCIFER
Royal flush, you lose.
Off with the
bra.
The Demons and Gatekeeper are sitting around playing strip
poker.
The Gatekeeper takes off his bra.
From behind, we
see his breasts flop out.
LUCIFER (CONT'D)
Last time I saw a pair of jugs that big,
two hillbillies were blowing on them.
The Gatekeeper throws his hand down and storms out.
The
Monster laughs uproariously.
Nicky enters and moves to
what's left of his dad.
Arms, torso, and a head (with one
ear).
NICKY
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after
me.
He's always a step ahead.
What am
I gonna do?
DAD
What are you gonna do?
Look at me,
Nicky!
I got no legs, I got no hips, I
got one ear...
Dad's remaining ear falls out.
DAD (CONT'D)
I got no ears!
I can't hear!
JIMMY THE DEMON
Now he's got no ears!
You happy, Nicky?
Your father's got no ears!
NICKY
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad.
Do you have
any advice at all for me?
DAD
I can't hear you, Nicky.
I can't hear
anything!
Jimmy picks up the ear.
Jimmy speaks into it.
JIMMY THE DEMON
Check one-two.
Check one-two.
DAD
Put it back on my head.
I'm falling
apart here.
JIMMY THE DEMON
He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.
(putting ear back on Dad)
You get your ass back up there.
You
save your father!
Nicky looks very upset.
Surrounded by prostitutes and criminals in a very hot room,
the chief of police puts down his bottle of PEPPERMINT
SCHNAPPS, stands up and looks at the two idiots.
CHIEF OF POLICE
You have what I want?
JOHN
Sure do.
You got what we want?
PETER
Fifty million bones, bro.
He nods to a DEPUTY who gives them a briefcase of money.
CHIEF OF POLICE
That's half of it.
You get the rest
when I get Nicky.
PETER
Excellent.
But I gotta warn you, man.
He's not human.
CHIEF OF POLICE
Really?
JOHN
We think he's the son of Satan.
PAUSE.
The chief LAUGHS, then everyone else does.
He walks
over and picks them up by their throats.
CHIEF OF POLICE
Well, then I guess I'll have to be extra
careful.
Now where is he?
We see the BIG CLOCK on the wall.
FIVE minutes til NOON.
We
see JOHN and PETER (with the briefcase) walking into GRAND
CENTRAL with the chief and twenty-five NYC cops.
The chief
bumps into a filthy bag lady drinking out of paper sack.
BAG LADY
Hey, watch it!
Who do you think you
are?
CHIEF OF POLICE
(never stopping)
Emperor of the New Hell.
They march through onto the platform for Track 33.
We see Beefy and Todd waiting by the place where Nicky
usually comes up.
It is hot down there.
Steam and smoke
comes out of the tunnels.
Todd is nervous.
TODD
Where is he?
He's late.
BEEFY
He'll be here.
Just keep your cool,
kid.
They hear FOOTSTEPS.
They turn and see the chief of police
backed up by the huge police force.
BEEFY (CONT'D)
We've been ratted out.
Beefy and Todd turn to see John and Peter looking sheepish.
TODD
You guys.
That was so uncool.
PETER
We thought the son of Satan would
understand a move like this.
Peter and John high-five.
CHIEF OF POLICE
Okay, take these two outside.
I can
handle this.
The police grab Todd and put a leash on Beefy.
The cops lead
their prisoners away down the tunnel, leaving John and Peter
alone with the chief.
CHIEF OF POLICE (CONT'D)
Wanna see something cool?
The chief inserts a finger into his nostril.
Then he fits
his hand up there.
Soon his whole arm is up his nostril as
he searches for something.
John and Peter are impressed.
The chief grabs something and starts to pull.
Then out of
his nose comes Adrian, who fully forms as the shell of the
chief's body slumps to the ground.
ADRIAN
Ta-da.
So what time is my brother
expected back?
JOHN
Noon...
They look at the clock.
It's noon.
JOHN (CONT'D)
...ish.
Peter is sweating, kinda nervous.
PETER
So even though you're not really the
chief, we still get the rest of the
cash, right bro?
ADRIAN
You know what you'll get?
An
indescribably horrific torture
administered by demons for the rest of
eternity.
JOHN
But what about the cash?
Can we keep it
or what?
ADRIAN
Sure, why not?
They high five.
Adrian smiles and waits.
It is real hot
down there.
We hear a train coming in the distance.
A fan
circles slowly.
They all wait for him.
LADY
(mumbling to herself)
Food stamps?
They should call 'em "dude stamps."
Cause ever time I get one, some dude
takes it away...
We see the HOMELESS LADY down the platform stumbling her way
towards them, drunk.
Adrian scowls at her.
LADY (CONT'D)
Hey, studs.
I'll let you make out with
me for a dollar!
JOHN
No thanks...but we'll take that bottle
of booze.
(grabs the bottle, laughs)
LADY
Hey...that's mine.
Peter pushes her away.
PETER
Beat it, ya freak.
John and Peter high five and John swigs from the bag.
JOHN
Schnapps...
PETER
(takes the bag, swigs)
Peppermint...alright.
Adrian raises his eyebrows.
We see that the homeless lady is
actually VALERIE in disguise.
She looks back, tense.
John
offers Adrian the flask.
JOHN
Wanna hit?
Hands it to him.
He takes it.
PETER
Drink up.
Here's to fifty million
clams.
ADRIAN
To the defilement of Earth and the
corruption of its people.
PETER
Whatever.
Knock it back, grab Nicky and
let's get outta this hell-hole.
Adrian smiles at John, then raises the bag.
He stops just
before it hits his lips.
He looks at John curiously.
ADRIAN
It is awfully hot down here.
How do you
manage to stay so cool?
JOHN
Weed lowers the body temperature.
(stuttering)
I read that...in, uh...er, science
magazine.
Adrian stares at John.
He raises the bag again.
ADRIAN
This liquid will probably quench my
thirst.
Cool me off.
PETER
Definitely.
JOHN
And give you a good buzz.
ADRIAN
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all
eternity.
JOHN
Uh.
No it won't?
John starts to tremble a bit.
ADRIAN
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you.
Come on out
and say hello...
JOHN
Urr...uggg...errr...
ADRIAN
(eyes getting red)
I'm calling you out, brother...
Adrian is mentally pulling Nicky out of John.
Nicky/John
wages an epic battle with himself as Adrian smiles.
JOHN/NICKY
Urrr...uggh...
(as Nicky)
Oww.
Adrian, this is very painful.
Nicky comes flying out.
John's body slumps to the floor next
to the chief's.
Adrian looks in the "Schnapps bottle" to see
the flask wrapped in paper.
He peeks inside.
ADRIAN
Hello, Cassius.
CASSIUS (O.S.)
All right.
Let me out.
ADRIAN
You know, New Hell really only needs one
new Satan.
CASSIUS (O.S.)
You mother...
Adrian hands Nicky the flask.
ADRIAN
But Cassius could use some company for
the rest of eternity.
So get in the
flask.
He puts the Flask in Nicky's hands.
The police are escorting Beefy and Todd through the terminal.
Beefy starts whining and stops.
The cops look down.
Beefy
raises his leg.
COP
Oh, he's gotta pee.
A thick, yellow smoke shoots out of Beefy, enveloping the
group.
Beefy escapes and bolts back down stairs.
TODD
Run, Beefy!
Run!
Adrian stares down Nicky.
NICKY
I won't drink.
You can't make me.
Adrian looks over at Valerie.
Suddenly she comes flying over
to him.
He grabs her by the throat.
We hear a train coming in the distance.
ADRIAN
Of course I can.
Drink or she dies.
(Nicky is scared)
Unlike you, she won't come back from
where she's going.
NICKY
Let her go.
ADRIAN
I hear a train coming.
Drink.
The train sound is coming CLOSER.
Valerie looks at Nicky.
Nicky raises the flash to drink.
VALERIE
Don't do it.
NICKY
I have to, Valerie.
We see Beefy skid to a stop, raise his leg and a full size
archery arrow shoots out of his penis and tracks right into
ADRIAN'S LEG.
ADRIAN
Ahhh!
BEEFY
Now that hurt the both of us.
Valerie is able to escape momentarily.
Adrian reaches for
her, grabbing her.
They both spin and fall down onto the
tracks.
Right into the oncoming train.
NICKY
Valerie!!!
Nicky leaps down onto the tracks, wrestles Valerie away from
Adrian and tosses her off the tracks.
Adrian looks at Nicky.
ADRIAN
See you in Hell!
WHAMM!
The train comes by, hitting both Adrian and Nicky.
Adrian comes flying through the solid firefall into Hell.
He
looks around.
Confused, there's no Nicky.
DISSOLVE TO:
Nicky enters the cake to find ANGEL and two friends: JENNA
and CHRISTA.
They are doing arts and crafts sort of things
on a glass table in front of them.
They stare at him.
Angel
rises.
ANGEL
Oh. My. G-d.
I can't believe you're
here.
Welcome.
Can I just tell you, I
am so excited right now.
CHRISTA
So excited.
JENNA
She really is.
NICKY
That's terrific.
Now could you ladies
point me to the Black Palace?
I should
check in with my dad...
Nicky trails off as he sees the Angels laughing at him.
ANGEL
I'm sorry, you're just so cute.
JENNA
Do you have any idea where you are right
now?
NICKY
The home of eternal damnation, house of
Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
ANGEL
Maybe try the opposite of that.
The Angel and two friends laugh and high-five.
Nicky's
confused.
ANGEL (CONT'D)
Okay, can I just ask you something?
What do you know about your mom?
NICKY
My brothers told me my mother was a
mountain goat.
Which would explain my
chronic halitosis.
ANGEL
(annoyed)
A mountain goat?
That's really sweet.
NICKY
My mom wasn't a goat?
ANGEL
Try an angel.
NICKY
An angel?
ANGEL
Unh-huh.
Which would make you half
angel.
Nicky is floored.
NICKY
Wow.
What...what did she look like?
ANGEL
Well, she was about six-three, only
spoke Portuguese and had really long
grey hair.
The GIRLS start laughing.
ANGEL (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, I'm totally busting on you.
I'm your mom.
Nicky is even more floored.
FLASH.
Jenna has taken a
picture of Nicky.
JENNA
I'm sorry, but you just had the sweetest
look on your face.
CHRISTA
You're gonna be so happy she did that.
NICKY
(stunned)
How come you're not older?
ANGEL
Angels don't get any older, son.
JENNA
I can't believe you just called him
"son."
ANGEL
Oh my G-d.
This is so wild.
They laugh.
Nicky is quite baffled.
Dad is just a pair of lips, with ears on either side held up
by two forearms with hands attached, lying on the throne.
Gatekeeper, Lucifer, Jimmy and a few other demons stand
around.
DAD
I can't see shit.
You're all still
here, right?
Adrian enters.
They all cheer.
JIMMY THE DEMON
Adrian's here.
You'll be back to normal
in a jiffy, sir.
DAD LIPS
Yea!
I can't believe little Nicky came
through.
ADRIAN
Where's Nicky?
JIMMY THE DEMON
He came with you and Cassius, right?
ADRIAN
I came through that gate alone.
JIMMY THE DEMON
Sorry, sir, false alarm.
DAD
Boooo.
ADRIAN
Somebody explain what's going on.
Puts the Gatekeeper in a headlock.
GATEKEEPER
You'll get nothing out of me.
ADRIAN
Perhaps a titty twister will loosen your
lips.
He twists a breast.
The Gatekeeper babbles out the
information immediately.
GATEKEEPER
The only way to save your dad is for you
and your brothers to pass through the
gates at the same time before he
deteriorates completely.
ADRIAN
How much time does Dad have before that
happens?
Adrian twists hard.
GATEKEEPER
Thirty minutes.
And then whoever claims
his throne will have unimaginable power.
Adrian throws him down.
LUCIFER
All boobs and no balls.
ADRIAN
Thirty minutes.
Hmmm.
I hope you don't
mind if I take a seat while I wait for
you.
He moves to the throne and throws the lips off.
DAD LIPS
Ahhh!
He pushes Lucifer out of the way.
LUCIFER
I don't get no respect.
ADRIAN
Ten thousand years.
And I never once
got to sit here.
He sits on the throne and it starts to shake a little.
He
grins as two horns grow out of his forehead.
ADRIAN (CONT'D)
Wow.
And this is just a little taste of
my power.
DAD
Hell's gonna bust wide open.
Demons,
get him out of the chair!
The demons approach.
ADRIAN
Ah-ah.
Not so fast, demons.
There are
a couple of million evil souls on Earth
ready to be harvested.
Anyone
interested?
The demons stop.
Now loyal to Adrian.
All except Jimmy.
Everyone is sitting around drinking Diet Cokes.
NICKY
Are you Adrian and Cassius' mom, too?
CHRISTA
No, their mother's weren't angels.
ANGEL
I think they were hookers or strippers
or something really porno like...
There's a knock on the door. It opens and in comes Carl
Weathers dressed as Chubbs from Happy Gilmore.
CHUBBS
Holly, Jenna, Christa. Time for your
Mambo lesson.
ANGEL
Oh, Chubbs.
I totally spaced.
I'm so
sorry.
I have company.
It's my son,
Nicky.
My son.
Can you believe it?
CHUBBS
Wow, that's terrific.
ANGEL
Nicky, this is Chubbs.
He used to be a
golf pro, but up here he's the dopest
dance instructor.
CHUBBS
You mambo?
NICKY
I don't think so.
CHUBBS
Remember, it's all in the hips.
It's
all in the hips.
Chubbs dances as he leaves.
NICKY
Where did you meet my father?
ANGEL
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven
and Hell mixer.
CHRISTA
I remember that night, you had like four
daiquiris.
ANGEL
Try four and a half.
At first I totally
didn't like him.
JENNA
He was really conceited.
ANGEL
But I don't know, he was funny, he made
me laugh, and I hate to say it but he
had a really nice body.
NICKY
And that made you want to make a baby
with him?
The Angels laugh.
ANGEL
Well, I really wasn't thinking about
making a baby at the time!
Her cell-phone rings.
She answers it.
ANGEL (CONT'D)
Hello....yes, he's here with me now... I
don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you
perv!
I'll call you back...
(laughs)
Oh my G-d, I will call you back,
goodbye.
(hangs up)
That was my friend, Michelle, she says
"hi."
NICKY
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
Angel makes a motion towards the phone, then stops.
ANGEL
I'll call her later.
CHRISTA
You know, we saw you save your
girlfriend's life.
JENNA
That was so cool.
ANGEL
That's why you came up to Heaven instead
of Hell.
Self-sacrifice automatically
gets you here.
NICKY
How did you see me?
ANGEL
We can see what's going on anywhere on
Earth.
Look.
Angel and the girls clear the junk from the glass table in
front of them.
Angel touches the glass and it turns into a
reflection of Earth below.
DAD LIPS are morosely talking to the Gatekeeper and Jimmy.
DAD LIPS
I was a good Devil, wasn't I?
JIMMY THE DEMON
You were the best Devil, boss, the best
Devil!
GATEKEEPER
Absolutely.
DAD LIPS
I tried to do some interesting stuff...
JIMMY THE DEMON
You did amazing stuff!
GATEKEEPER
I don't know how you came up with some
of it.
DAD LIPS
Really?
That means a lot to me.
JENNA (O.S.)
Oh my G-d.
He looks gross.
ANGEL (O.S.)
I can't believe I did it with him.
She touches the pool again and the reflection changes to:
Nicky is shocked.
NICKY
Valerie's crying!
ANGEL
She's so nice.
CHRISTA
She goes to Parson's, right?
ANGEL
I would totally love to go there.
But I
hear it's really hard to get in.
NICKY
I gotta help her.
I gotta help Dad.
I
gotta help everybody.
ANGEL
Yeah, you do...
Adrian is looking at a clock tower that reads 11:45.
ADRIAN (V.O.)
At the stroke of midnight, my father
will be completely deteriorated.
And
all of your souls will be mine.
Nicky is starting to panic.
NICKY
But how can I win?
Adrian is stronger
and smarter than me.
ANGEL
Stronger, yes.
Smarter, definitely.
But you have something he doesn't have.
NICKY
A speech impediment?
The girls laugh.
ANGEL
No, you have the inner light.
You can
totally use it.
It's the best power of
all.
(he smiles)
And in case you get in real bad trouble,
G-d told me to give you this.
She gives him an ornate, jewelled ball.
NICKY
What is it?
ANGEL
I'm not a hundred percent on that.
G-d
said when the time comes, you'll know
what to do.
CHRISTA
G-d's so smart.
JENNA
The smartest.
ANGEL
Well, goodbye...for now.
(looks at his face)
Can I just do this?
She licks her finger and wipes some dirt off his forehead.
ANGEL (CONT'D)
That was such a Mom thing, wasn't it?
FRIEND
Totally.
NICKY
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.
(to Angel)
Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
ANGEL
It would be so okay.
Nicky hugs his Mom.
NICKY
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple
cause I'm gonna rock that town like a
hurricane.
ANGEL (O.S.)
You're already there...
We now see Angel, Jenna, Christa and SEVEN OTHER GIRLS
watching the action on the table.
ANGEL
I totally had to do that.
ALL THE GIRLS
Yah you did.
CHUBBS is there, too.
The Angel and the Friend are praying.
Dad is just a very thin pair of lips and one finger.
The
FINGER is going up and down on the lips, making silly sounds.
The Gatekeeper, the Monster, Jimmy the Demon and Lucifer are
on their backs crying like babies.
The lips and finger are slowing down.
Nicky triumphantly passes through the wall of fire and it
starts burning again behind him.
And now all the BACKED UP
SOULS fall out on top of Nicky.
The Gatekeeper APPLAUDS.
Dad's lips form a body around it.
Dad FILLS IN.
Dad and Nicky are hugging.
DAD
You came through, Nicky.
NICKY
I came through for you, Mom and the
butterflies, Dad.
DAD
You're back in Hell now, kid.
There's
no butterflies here.
If you want
butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
NICKY
What about you and Grandpa and everyone
in Hell?
DAD
Nicky, I let my butterflies die once
upon a time and it's never stopped
hurting.
(Dad looks up)
That's right, you heard me, Holly.
I'm
still in love with you.
Angel is shocked.
ANGEL
Oh my G-d.
He's totally talking about
me.
DAD
And don't think I forgot about how crazy
you get after a few daiquiris.
FRIEND
That guy is still a horn dog.
Dad turns to Nicky.
DAD
Listen, I got down low.
Your mom's got
up high.
You take care of the middle.
NICKY
I will, Dad.
But in the words of Motley
Crue, this will always be my...home
sweet home...
He pats him on the back.
JIMMY THE DEMON
Sorry to interrupt guys, but it's time
for Hitler's punishment.
LUCIFER
Let me handle that.
Lucifer walks over to the closet.
LUCIFER (CONT'D)
And I'm not using a pineapple this time.
He pulls out the flask.
ADRIAN (O.S.)
No!
CASSIUS (O.S.)
Don't do it!
He shoves the flask up Hitler's ass.
Hitler's face tightens.
HITLER
Holy Schnit!
FREEZE FRAME, then:
DISSOLVE TO:
ONE YEAR LATER
Over the skyline of Manhattan.
