      CLOSE ON KATE S MUGSHOT.  WIDEN to reveal it s being held by 
      JACK, standing over a leather bag full of medical supplies.  
      He s TOTALLY FOCUSED on the photo in his hand, staring at it 
      wistfully, when he hears:

                                  KATE (O.S.)
                    I take better pictures than that.*

      Jack spins to face -- KATE, smiling unsurely.  Happy to see  *
      Jack despite what he s holding.  Trying to make light of it -- *

                                  KATE (cont d)*
                    Smaller, too.  I mean, if you d *
                    like something for your wallet.*

    He looks at her a beat, almost sadly.

                                  JACK
                    Just came to pick up a few things.

    He hands Kate her mug shot.  The ROAD BLOCK between them.

                                  JACK (cont d)
                    This, uh... It was with my stuff.

      Kate takes the photo, folds it up -- MEMORIES HERE.  Jack 
      goes back to packing up his things.*

                                  KATE
                    So... You re not staying.

                                  JACK
                    Hurley and I... We ve been checking 
                    out in the valley...
                          (pointedly)
                    And they re a hell of a lot safer 
                    than living out here on the beach.

                                  KATE
                    You re mad at me.

    He stops packing to look at her.

                                  JACK
                    No.  Kate, I m-- I just don t 
                    understand why you won t come with 
                    me -- us.  The caves are--

                                  KATE
                    We crashed eight days ago.  I m not *
                    setting up house here, Jack.*

                                  JACK
                    Look, I want off this island too.  
                    But we both know that s not gonna *
                    happen anytime soon.

      They stand in silence for a beat, then...

                                  KATE*
                    Sayid... He has a plan...

                                  JACK
                    To find the source of the distress *
                    signal.  Yeah.  I remember.

                                  KATE
                    The transmission s coming from 
                    somewhere on the island.  If we can *
                    find it --

                                  JACK
                    -- That signal s been playing on a *
                    loop for sixteen years.  The woman *
                    who left it wasn t rescued, what 
                    makes you think it ll be different *
                    for us?*

                                  KATE
                          (after a beat)
                    Because I believe it.

      Jack eyes her a moment.

                                  JACK
                    I wish I shared your faith.

                                  SAWYER (O.S.)
                    Wouldn t mind sharing a few things 
                    with her myself.

      They both turn to see SAWYER strolling up, a bag slung over  *
    his shoulder.  There s no love lost between him and Jack. *

                                  KATE
                    What do you want, Sawyer?

                                  SAWYER
                    Not a thing, sweetheart.  Heard the 
                    doc here was vacating the premises.  
                    Thought I d best lay claim to my 
                    new digs before somebody else does.

    He tosses his bag into the tent.  Jack can t fucking believe 
      this guy --

                                  JACK
                    I didn t build this for you to live 
                    in -- it s an infirmary.

                                  SAWYER
                    Not without a doctor around it 
                    ain t.  Yep, I could fix this place 
                    up real nice.

                    with me.

      Kate rolls her eyes, digusted.  Jack doesn t have time for 
      this High School shit -- Hoists the leather bag...

                                  JACK
                    Fine.  Take the tent.

    And Jack goes.  Sawyer comes up behind her.

      WIDE ON CHARLIE, alone, inexplicably standing in the middle 
    of a clearing, surrounded by tall, dense brush.

    CUT IN CLOSE on his face - Looking pale, breathing shallowly.  
    His eyes dart around, anxiously.  When suddenly he hears A 
      TWIG SNAP.  His head SWINGS toward the direction.  Whispers --

                                  CHARLIE
                    Locke?  Th-that you?

    The SNAPPING becomes QUICKER, the nearby brush shakes, and we 
      hear an UNGODLY SCREECH!  Something s charging --

    AND CHARLIE RUNS FOR HIS LIFE!  TRACK WITH him as he crashes 
      through the flora, weaving among the tall trees -- TIGHT ON 
      HIS FACE, terror in his eyes, when we hear:

                                  CHARLIE (PRE-LAP) (cont d)
                    Bless me, Father, for I have 
                    sinned...




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                                5.




      CHARLIE -- as he continues to TEAR ASS through the jungle.  
      WHIPPING PAST TREES -- HURDLING BUSHES -- until he reaches --

    A DEAD END.  He spins around in time to see --

    A SQUEALING FLASH OF FUR BURSTS THROUGH THE BRUSH...

      ON CHARLIE - Breathing hard, pinching his eyes closed, as the 
      thing bares down on him, then...

      CLOSE ON A ROPE draped across a tree branch PULLING TAUT and

      WE SEE A SCREECHING BOAR -- ASCENDING INTO THE SKY --  
      SQUEALING AND CONVULSING IN A NET.

                                  LOCKE (O.S.)
                    Nicely done, Charlie...

      Charlie looks over at*

      LOCKE -- securing the pull-rope attached to the BOAR TRAP. *

                                  LOCKE (cont d)
                    You make excellent bait.

      ON CHARLIE, taking a step toward him, as all shades of that  *
      good kid in the confessional melt away, and a DARKNESS falls  *
      over his eyes.  He speaks in a harsh, dangerous whisper. *

                                    CHARLIE
                          (glad I could oblige)*
                    Now give me my bloody drugs. *

      And off a glowering CHARLIE --

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK: *

                                        ACT ONE


      ON fuming Charlie trailing Locke ON THE MOVE, calmly  *
      receiving Charlie s verbal assault.*

                                    CHARLIE
                    You hear what I said?  I want my *
                    drugs back!  I need them!*

                                  LOCKE
                    Yet you gave them to me.  Hmmm.

                                    CHARLIE
                    And bloody well regret it.  I m 
                    sick, man.  Can t you see that?

                                  LOCKE
                    I think you re a lot stronger than 
                    you know, Charlie.  And I m gonna 
                    prove it to you...

      Locke comes to a nearby backpack resting on a rock and, from 
    a side pocket, removes a HUGE HUNTING KNIFE.  ON CHARLIE -- 
      seeing the knife -- What s Locke got in mind here?

                                  LOCKE (cont d)
                    I ll let you ask me for your drugs 
                    three times.  And the third 
                    time...?  I m going to give them to 
                    you.  Now.  Just so we re clear.
                          (gesturing with knife)
                    This was one.

      As Charlie takes that in, Locke crosses to the netted boar.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Why-- Why are you doing this?  To 
                    torture me?  Just throw them away -- 
                    Get rid of  em and be done with it!

                                  LOCKE
                    If I did that, you wouldn t have a 
                    choice, Charlie.

      CHARLIE reacts, remembering the words of his priest as LOCKE 
      grabs the netting surrounding the squealing boar.

                                  LOCKE (cont d)
                    Having a choice, making decisions 
                    based more than instinct...
                          (indicates the boar)

                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                                9.
      (CONT'D):77
                                  LOCKE (cont d)
                    ...is the only thing that separates 
                    you from him.

      With that, Locke (OFF-CAMERA) stabs the boar in the throat.

      AND ON CHARLIE, as he adverts his eyes, the Boar letting out  *
      an AGUISHED SQUEAL...*


      BOOMING DOWN on a MAKESHIFT ANTENNA, reminiscent of the one  *
      in Ep. 2, and attached to an 8-foot pole from the wreckage,  *
      until we find...*

      SAYID securing the pole into the wet sand and addressing  *
      BOONE and KATE, who stand nearby, a duffle bag at their feet. *

                                  SAYID
                    Three antennas.  Three points of a *
                    triangle.  One here on the beach...*

      He removes another antenna from the bag and hands it to Kate.

                                  SAYID (cont d)*
                    Another Kate will position in the 
                    jungle, roughly two kilometers in.  
                    And the third...

      He brings up yet another antenna, this one hardwired to the 
      ever-important TRANSCEIVER.

                                  SAYID (cont d)
                    I ll take to high ground.
                          (points toward mountains)
                    ...up there.  If the French 
                      transmission is coming from 
                    somewhere within our triangulation, 
                    I ll be able to locate the source.
                          (beat)
                    But there are two complications...

                                  BOONE
                    Of course there are.

                                  SAYID
                    The power cells I ve grafted onto 
                    the antennas are drained.  There s 
                    no telling how long they ll last.  
                    A minute.  Maybe more.  Maybe less.

                            (understanding)
                    So we all have to be in position 
                    before we switch them on.

                                  BOONE
                    Whoa, wait a minute, how are we 
                    supposed to do that?  There s no 
                    way to communicate with each other.

      Sayid just SMILES.  Thought of this.  Reaches into his 
      duffel, pulls out THREE BOTTLE ROCKETS.

                                  KATE
                    Bottle rockets?

                                  SAYID

                    my rocket.  When you two see it, 
                    fire yours.  After the last one 
                    goes up, we ll all switch on our *
                    antennas.

                                  KATE*
                    You said there were two 
                      complications.

                                  SAYID
                    The battery in the transceiver is 
                    dead.  And I ve yet to find a *
                    suitable replacement.  Without the *
                      transceiver, all of this is for *
                      nothing...*
                          (beat)*
                    Something from a PDA or, better *
                    yet, a laptop computer would *
                    probably work... but... I ve been *
                    unable to salvage any from the  *
                    wreckage.*

      Kate thinks for a moment, glances back at the beach camp. *

                                  KATE
                    Think I might know where to look.*

      OFF KATE, hoping this will work...






                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              11.




      KATE and SAYID -- NOT at the beach -- as they trek through 
      DENSE JUNGLE, Sayid s antennas PROMINENT in their backpacks.

      SUDDENLY KATE JUST STOPS.  SPOOKED.  Sayid looks at her.

                                  SAYID
                    What is it?





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              21.
      (CONT'D):1616


                                  KATE
                    I dunno.  Felt like a goose just 
                    walked over my grave.
                          (off Sayid s look)
                    Something my dad used to say.  When 
                    he got the feeling something bad 
                    just happened.  You ever get that?

                                  SAYID
                    Only about every thirty seconds.

      Kate manages a smile, as Sayid continues on and she follows.

                                  KATE
                    What we re doing.  I mean, chasing *
                    some phantom distress signal -- *
                    What are the odds of this working?

                                  SAYID
                    No worse than the odds of us 
                    surviving that plane crash.*

                                  KATE
                    People survive plane crashes all 
                    the time.

                                  SAYID
                    Not like this one.  The tail 
                    section broke off when we were 
                    still in the air.  The cockpit 
                    separated some time later... Our 
                    section cart-wheeled through the 
                    jungle, completely crushing those 
                    who died.  And yet we escaped with 
                    nothing more than a few scrapes.  
                    How do you explain that?

                                  KATE
                          (considers, then shrugs)
                    Blind, dumb luck.

                                  SAYID
                    No one is that lucky.  We shouldn t 
                    have survived.

                                  KATE
                          (half-playful)
                    So... what -- We re dead?  And 
                    this... is, what, Hell?

      Sayid gives her a bemused look --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              22.
      (CONT'D): (2)1616


                                  SAYID
                    Of course not.  That s insane... *
                    All I m saying is that perhaps 
                    there s a reason we re still alive.*

                                  KATE
                    Divine intervention?
                          (off his non-response)
                    Sorry, Sayid... but things just 
                    happen.  No rhyme or reason to it.

                                  SAYID
                          (grins)
                    Tell that to your goose.

      AND OFF KATE, as they forge deeper into the unknown...


      CHARLIE reaches the beach -- out of breath -- rushes up to 
      MICHAEL and WALT - Michael s shaving as Walt pets VINCENT, 
      lying next to him.

                                    CHARLIE
                    HEY!  We need help!

                                    MICHAEL
                    What s wrong, man?

                                    CHARLIE
                    It s Jack.  He s trapped!  There 
                    was a cave-in...

      SHANNON and Boone overhear, and rush over --

                        BOONECHARLIE
      What?  How -- ?-- Cave collapsed.  Don t 
                                                  even know if he s alive... We 
                                                  gotta get him out...

      MICHAEL looks around, spots a couple of burly SURVIVORS. Good-
      looking guys in their FORTIES.  He calls out to one of them.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Hey, you... Scott!*

                                  STEVE*
                    I m Steve.*
                          (pointing to his partner)*
                    He s Scott.*

                                  MICHAEL*
                    We got an emergency.  Grab a couple 
                    more guys and c mon --*

                                  CHARLIE*
                    Yeah.  We gotta move.  Follow me...*

      Charlie starts to lead them toward the jungle.  Walt and  *
      Vincent tag along.  Suddenly, Boone STOPS.  Shit.  PULLS the  *
      BOTTLE ROCKET from his pocket, turns to Shannon --*

                                  BOONE
                    Shannon, you need to do something *
                      important, okay?*
                          (points to the ANTENNA)
                    At five o clock, you need to be *
                    ready to turn that thing on.  The *
                    switch is right at the base.

                                    SHANNON
                    Uh... why?

                                  BOONE
                    Kate and Sayid are triangulating *
                    the French signal.  But the 
                    antenna s power is weak, so you *
                    have to wait until they fire off 
                    their bottle rockets...
                          (holds up his rocket)
                    Then you fire off this one.  Then 
                    turn on the antenna.  Got it?*

    A long beat.  She just looks at him BLANKLY.  Then -- *

                                    SHANNON
                    The switch is where now?

                                  BOONE
                    Did you hear a word I said?

                                    SHANNON
                    Look, don t get mad at me because 
                    the Professor and Maryann have a 
                    confusing frigging plan...

                                  BOONE
                    Can you do it or can t you?

      Shannon shakes her head, but petulantly takes the ROCKET --





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              24.
      (CONT'D): (2)1717


                      SHANNONBOONE
      Yeah.  I can do it.
                                                  -- If you can t...

                                    SHANNON
                    I can.  Go save the world already.

      Boone nods.  Runs off to join the others, all heading into 
      the jungle.  We pick up CHARLIE, who stops abruptly --  *
      doubles back -- realizing someone s missing --*

                                  CHARLIE
                    Wait.  Kate.  I gotta let Kate know 
                    about Jack.

                                  SAWYER (O.S.)
                    Sorry, sport, you just missed *
                    her...

      ON SAWYER by the infirmary tent, having heard everything,  *
      wringing out his wet T-shirt.*

                                  SAWYER (cont d)
                    She and Muhammed headed into the 
                    woods  bout ten minutes ago --

                                  CHARLIE
                    Which way?

                                  SAWYER
                    Don t sweat it, amigo.  I know 
                    which way they went.*

      Charlie starts to protest, but Sawyer cuts him off -- *

                                  SAWYER (cont d)*
                    I ll tell her.  You just keep *
                    doing... whatever it is you do *
                    around here...*

      Sawyer hurries off in another direction of the jungle,  *
      leaving Charlie standing there, ignored and alone.  PUSHING  *
      IN ON HIS FACE, we hear a BASS LINE playing, accompanied by  *
      the roar of an appreciative crowd...


      KATE continues to trek through the jungle with Sayid -- when 
      they hear a rustle in the underbrush -- STOP -- NERVOUS -- *

                                  SAYID
                      Something s coming --

      SAWYER emerges from the jungle.  Kate shakes her head -- *

                                  KATE
                    What the hell are you doing here?

                                  SAWYER
                          (winded)
                    Easy.  I just came to tell you *
                    something --

                                  KATE
                          (harsh tone)*
                    What makes you think I m interested *
                    in anything you have to say to me?*

      SAWYER, taken aback by this reception.  After a beat...

                                  SAWYER
                    Came to tell you... You were right.
                          (off her look)
                    About me.  That I don t help anyone *
                    but myself.  Well, here I am.   *
                    Ready to pitch in.

      Are Sayid and Kate skeptical?  Fuck yeah.

                                  KATE
                    You re here to help?

                                  SAWYER
                    Hey -- You act any more surprised, 
                    I m gonna be insulted.

      And OFF KATE, wondering what Sawyer s up to -- no idea that 
      he s sitting on the news of the cave-in -- WE FIND --


      CHARLIE, his withdrawal symptoms worsening, heading through  *
      the jungle to the place where Locke trapped the boar -- *




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              29.

                                  LOCKE (O.S.)
                    Something wrong, Charlie?

      Charlie whips around to see LOCKE, the skinned BOAR in the 
      background, hanging from a tree by its heels.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Yeah.  Jack.  He s... There s been 
                    an accident... At the caves... 
                    Jack s buried in a cave-in...

      Locke takes that in, wiping his bloody knife on his shirt.

                                  LOCKE
                    Is anyone trying to get him out?

                                  CHARLIE
                    Yeah -- Bunch of people there now.

                                  LOCKE
                    And why aren t you with them?
                          (no response)*
                    You didn t come to tell me about 
                    Jack, did you?

      Charlie looks at the ground, broken.

                                  CHARLIE
                    I want my stash, Locke.  I can t 
                    stand... feeling like this.*

      Locke eyes him a moment, then nods.

                                  LOCKE
                    Let me show you something...

      He leads Charlie to a tree, points out a COCOON on its trunk.

                    What do you suppose is in this

                    I dunno.  Butterfly, I guess.

                    No.  It s much more beautiful than *
                    that.  This is a moth cocoon.*

                    attention.  But moths?  They spin *
                    silk.  They re stronger.  Faster...*

                                  CHARLIE*
                    Yeah.  Wonderful.  What s the --*

      But Locke ignores him, leaning in CLOSE to the cocoon.   *
      Transfixed -- in his own world to some degree...

                                  LOCKE
                    See this tiny hole?  This moth s 
                    almost ready to emerge.  It s in 
                    there right now, struggling, 
                    digging its way through the thick 
                    hide of the cocoon.  Now I could 
                    help it, take my knife, gently 
                    widen the opening... And the moth 
                    would be free.  But it d be too 
                    weak to survive.
                          (looks at Charlie)
                    The struggle is nature s way of 
                      strengthening it...

      He pulls the baggie out of his pocket...

                    This is the second time you ve 
                    asked me for your drugs back...

      He holds the baggie out, holds it right up to Charlie s face.  
      And we re CLOSE ON LOCKE as his eyes narrow...

                    Ask me again and it s yours.

      And OFF CHARLIE, hungering for a fix...

      CLOSE ON CHARLIE, stumbling along a jungle path.  Dazed.   *
      Leaving us to assume he s had a fix.  THE CAMERA FLOATS with  *
      him, dreamily, emulating his high, or so it d seem... *

      But something is WEIRD HERE.  Something is DEFINITELY OFF.  
      And then Charlie just STOPS -- because up ahead is --

    A MAN SITTING ON A ROCK.  Just sitting there, wearing a black 
      t-shirt, his back to Charlie.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Hello?

      As Charlie inches forward -- the guy suddenly turns around.  
      And HOLY FUCKING SHIT.  It s...

                    Wha-- Nowhere.  I mean, I went for 
                    help.  For you... But I was... I... 
                    I got lost...*
                          (notices Jack s shirt)
                    What are you wearing...?

      As Jack looks down, we TILT DOWN to see he s wearing Ian s 
       MU$IC $LUT  T-shirt.*

                                  JACK
                    You ve seen me in this before, 
                    Choir Boy.
                          (stands; intense)
                    You were supposed to look out for 
                    me, Charlie.  But you left me to 
                    die in a hole.

      Scared and confused, Charlie backs away --

                                  CHARLIE
                    How d you get out of the cave, 
                    Jack?

      And now Jack is COMING TOWARDS HIM, eyes burning --

                    STILL THERE!

                    YOU ALL EVERYBODY... YOU ALL 
                    EVERYBODY! --*

      And as he s almost ON TOP of Charlie, a BIRD S CA-CAWS!  *
      RATTLE CHARLIE.  He jolts -- as if waking from a dream.  And  *
      when he looks back -- Jack is gone.  As Charlie moves off,  *
        unnerved...*

        OMITTED2424 *


      KATE, completely oblivious to Jack s predicament, as she, 
      Sayid and Sawyer enter a clearing.

                                  SAYID
                    This is far enough.  We ll place 
                    the second antenna here.

      Kate removes her antenna from her backpack.  Sayid takes out 
    a small coil of wire, looks around, then at Sawyer.

                                  SAYID (cont d)
                    You want to help?
                          (pointing)
                    Attach this antenna up in that 
                    tree.  As high as you can.

                                  SAWYER
                    Golly, thanks!

      He takes the antenna from Kate, giving her a wink, and moves  *
      toward the tree.  Sayid hands Kate her bottle rocket. *

                                  SAYID
                    Five o clock.  Watch for my flare.  
                    Then it s your turn.

      Kate nods.  Sayid glances over at Sawyer, uncoiling the wire.

                                  SAYID (cont d)
                    I do not trust him.

                                  KATE
                    Who does?




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              34.

                                  SAYID
                          (more pointedly)
                    I do not trust him with you.

      Kate looks at Sayid.  Then, smiles at him, fondly.

                                  KATE
                    I can handle him.

      Sayid doesn t like it... but he NODS.  Heads back off into 
      the jungle.  ON KATE as she turns to watch Sawyer --


      SAWYER, sitting in the shade of a tree watching Kate as she  *
      scans the horizon, checking her watch constantly.*

                                  SAWYER
                    Still ain t five.  Just like the 
                    last time you checked your watch.

                                  KATE
                    I just don t want to miss Sayid s 
                    signal.  Remember, I ll fire the 
                    flare, you switch on the antenna.

                                  SAWYER
                    Thank the good Lord I got you here 
                    to keep reminding me.

      Kate shoots him a look, then focuses back on the horizon.   *
      After a beat...

                                  SAWYER (cont d)
                    So what do you see in that guy, 
                    anyway?
                          (off her look)
                    Jack.  What is it about him that 
                    makes you go all weak in the loins?

                                  KATE
                    What did you just say?

      Sawyer looks at her, unsure what she means.

                                  KATE (cont d)
                    You said  if he d survived a few *
                    more weeks...   What does that --*

      Sawyer realizes he s BUSTED.  He manages a smirk --

                                  SAWYER
                    Aw... damn.  Didn t I tell you?  *

                          (brutal)
                    Now you got someone else to pity.

      Shit.  The man holds a GRUDGE.  Kate stares at him in shock.   *
      And just when we think she s gonna rip his fucking head off -- *

      She throws the bottle rocket to the ground.  Turns. And RUNS. *

      ON SAWYER, his spiteful expression dissolving into something 
      like REMORSE.  He picks up the bottle rocket by his feet, 
      regards it for a moment, before looking after her again...

                                    CHARLIE
                    Well... you did this to me!

    A LONG BEAT, as Ian stares at him.  Then, SYMPATHETICALLY... *





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              45.

                                  IAN

                    for a few weeks?  Karen and me...  
                    We can get you help.  Sydney s got 
                    some really good programs--

                                  CHARLIE
                    Forget it.

      He gets up, knocking over his lemonade, and walks away.  Ian  *
      stands, wants to follow, but can t leave his Little Girl... *

                                  IAN
                    Don t go --

                                  CHARLIE
                          (his back to Ian)*
                    Thanks for helping, brother.

                                  IAN
                      Charlie... stay.  Please.

      CLOSE ON CHARLIE, tracking back with him.  Ian in the 
      background, calling after him.

                                  IAN (cont d)
                    I m just looking out for you --

                                    CHARLIE
                    You NEVER --
                          (stops himself; pure RAGE)
                    I ve got a plane to catch.

      As Charlie exits frame, we re left with the sight of Ian, 
      standing on his manicured lawn, helpless to stop Charlie -- *


      SAYID.  ANTENNA in position.  Checks his watch.  FIVE SHARP.   *
      He takes a breath, offers a MUTTERED PRAYER ( Allaabu Akbar )  *
      and prepares to light his bottle rocket, THE ONE AND ONLY  *
      FAILSAFE he will have of signaling the others to turn on 
      their antennas.  He touches a match to the fuse -- WHOOSH! *

      FOLLOW THE ROCKET UP AS IT EXPLODES IN THE SKY ABOVE HIM.  ON 
      SAYID, staring up as he prepares to activate the ANTENNA --

                                  SAYID
                    Alright, everyone.  It s your turn.





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              49.




      SHANNON casually chats with another young survivor, BETH, her 
      bottle rocket ignored next to her.

                                    SHANNON
                    ...Malibu most of the year, but the 
                    guys there are such idiots...

                                  BETH
                    Hey, what s that?  Fireworks?

      Shannon turns around and sees Sayid s bottle rocket exploding 
      high in the sky... ONLY THEN does she remember her MISSION --

                                    SHANNON
                    Oh, dammit, dammit, dammit --

      And as Shannon LUNGES FOR THE BOTTLE ROCKET, WE CUT BACK TO --


      Sayid.  His face LIGHTS UP as Shannon s bottle rocket 
      EXPLODES in the SKY OVER THE BEACH.

                                  SAYID
                    Come on, Kate.  One more...

      BUT NOTHING IS HAPPENING.  No bottle rocket.  Sayid begins to 
      look nervous for a moment, then... SWOOSH -- the third bottle 
      rocket EXPLODES above the jungle.  And although it s lost on 
      Sayid, we can t believe Sawyer actually came through.

      SAYID switches on his antenna, the one connected to the 
      transceiver -- and we see CLOSE ON TRANSCEIVER - Bars.  He s 
      getting BARS.

                                  SAYID (cont d)
                    Yes!  Yes, yes, yes!

      As he slowly pivots his body away from CAMERA, trying to find 
      the source... A SHADOW falls over him.  Someone is behind 
      him.  Sayid senses it, but before he can turn...

      WHAM!  A LARGE ROCK in the hand of someone we don t see SLAMS 
      down on Sayid s head!

      And as Sayid CRASHES to the ground, unconscious...*


                                  END OF ACT FOUR




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                              50.


                                        ACT FIVE


      SAYID, lying on the ground right where we left him.  His eyes 
      slowly blink back to consciousness.

      He sits up, disoriented.  His HEAD THROBBING.  Trying to 
      remember what happened.

      And it all comes back to him when he sees the antenna -- 
      SMASHED on the ground by his side.

                                  SAYID
                    No...

      And then he spots something.  Crosses over.  PICKS IT UP--

      THE TRANSCEIVER, also completely destroyed.

      And as the awful truth washes over Sayid s face -- that 
      someone doesn t want the castaways finding the source of the 
      French transmission -- WE...

                                                                        BLACK OUT.
