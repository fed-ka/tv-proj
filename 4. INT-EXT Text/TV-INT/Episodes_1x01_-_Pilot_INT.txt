Sunlight pours in.  Outside it s a beautiful California day.  
Inside it s not so nice.  Clothes are being furiously stuffed 
into a suitcase.  BEVERLY is doing the stuffing.  She s 
English, in her 30 s, and under most circumstances a strong, 
  self-possessed woman who suffers no fools.  Today she s a 
mess.  Her husband SEAN -- also English -- looks on.  Sean is 
bright, both in his intelligence and his sunny outlook.  He 
  genuinely believes that everything will turn out well.  Today 
he s wrong.   

                                  SEAN
                Beverly.  Stop.

                                    BEVERLY
                No.  

                                  SEAN
                Please.

                                    BEVERLY
                No.  I ve had it.  I m going home.  
                You stay.  Clearly, you re flourishing 
                here.

                                  SEAN
                I m hardly flourishing.

                                    BEVERLY
                Oh?  What did you do this morning?  

                                  SEAN
                      (sheepish)
                Surf lessons.  

                                    BEVERLY
                  Brilliant.

She snaps the suitcase shut and is out the bedroom door.

                                  SEAN
                      (following)
                If it helps, I fell off a lot.                                                                  12/28/09      2.



The house is a massive McMansion decorated with questionable 
taste.  Beverly is heading for the front door.  Sean follows.  

                                  SEAN
                Look.  I realize LA isn t your --

                                    BEVERLY
                This isn t about LA.

She opens the door.

                                  SECURITY SYSTEM VOICE
                Front door ajar.

                                  SEAN
                Wait!
                      (closing the door)
                Is it about the show?  It s one more 
                week.  

                                    BEVERLY
                Move.

He steps aside.  Beverly opens the door again.

                                  SECURITY SYSTEM VOICE
                Front door ajar.

                                  SEAN
                One more week, the work ll be done and 
                we can leave together with our heads 
                held high.

                                    BEVERLY
                Heads held high??  Have you not seen 
                our heads?  It s all we can do to not 
                kick them when we walk!

                                  SEAN
                      (closing the door)
                Granted, we ve made some compromises --

                                    BEVERLY
                This isn t about the show.  

She opens the door.

                                  SECURITY SYSTEM VOICE
                Front door ajar.

                                  SEAN
                Well, then what --                                                                    12/28/09      3.


He closes the door.  Beverly opens it.

                                  SECURITY SYSTEM VOICE
                Front door ajar.

                                    BEVERLY
                      (to Sean and the door)
                Will the two of you please shut up!
                      (then, level)
                I know about you and the girl with the 
                  gravity-defying breasts.

                                  SEAN
                      (flustered, sputtering)
                What?  All right, that --  I realize --  
                You have to --  Look --  

                                    BEVERLY
                You ll notice that absent from that 
                pile-up of words were the ones  It s 
                not true. 

She goes.


Rain is pouring down.  Sean and Beverly are lost in thought.

                                    BEVERLY
                You re already there, aren t you?

                                  SEAN
                No.

                                    BEVERLY
                Yes, you are.  You re having brunch 
                with Angelina Jolie.  My god, you ve 
                already got a tan.


Sean and Beverly are getting undressed.  

                                    BEVERLY
                You really want to move to LA?  You re 
                always taking the piss out of it.  

                                  SEAN
                Only because it s never wanted me.  
                I m very petty that way.

                                    BEVERLY
                But why do it?  Our lives are here, 
                our friends are here.

                                  SEAN
                Who would you miss?

                                    BEVERLY
                      (considers this)
                We need better friends.

She presents Sean with her back.    

                                  SEAN
                I m just saying, if we do this and 
                we re a hit -- 
                      (unhooking her necklace)
                A hit show in the States, a big stonking 
                hit -- it s like winning the lottery.  
                We d never have to work again.  

                                    BEVERLY
                What would we do instead?

                                  SEAN
                      (considers this)
                All right, we need friends and we need 
                hobbies.                                                                12/28/09      11.


                                    BEVERLY
                I don t know.  LA?  It s so... LA.

                                  SEAN
                Come on.  It s an adventure!

                                    BEVERLY
                      (a whimper)
                I d have to drive everywhere.

                                  SEAN
                Ah, there s that pioneer spirit.  

She presents him with her back again.  He unzips her dress.  
It slips to the floor.  She turns to face him.

                                    BEVERLY
                You really want this?

                                  SEAN
                I think I do.

She shrugs her acquiescence.  He beams.

                                  SEAN 
                Hurray.

He kisses her.  She starts to step away.  He stops her.

                                  SEAN
                Wait.  I get to do the bra too.

                                    BEVERLY
                      (amused)
                You re still fifteen, aren t you?

                                  SEAN
                Mmm hmm.
                      (trying to unfasten it)
                What, did you weld this?

As he continues to struggle with it, we PAN over to rain 
hitting the window.  Then CUT TO...


Sean and Beverly enter.

                                  SECURITY SYSTEM VOICE
                Front door ajar.

Beverly shuts the door, then opens it again.

                                  SECURITY SYSTEM VOICE
                Front door ajar.

                                    BEVERLY
                      (impressed)
                She s fun.

Beverly spots the living room and heads toward it.

                                    BEVERLY
                Oh my god...

The room is grand and column-lined.  Like the rest of the 
house, it has been decorated with a very heavy hand.  
  Everything s oversized.  Too much draped fabric, too many 
pillows, too many urns.  But Beverly s delighted.

                                    BEVERLY
                This is mad.  

She eyes a Roman-ish statue of a woman holding grapes.

                                    BEVERLY
                I love her!  Is it me, or do her 
                nipples follow you around the room?

                                  SEAN
                Bev, look at this.

He has discovered that one of the large columns is made of 
painted polystyrene and not connected at all to the house.  He 
rocks it back and forth. 

                                    BEVERLY
                Very Hollywood.

  FLORINDA, a middle-aged Hispanic housekeeper enters.  Her 
accent is dense.                                                                  12/28/09      16.


                                  SEAN
                  Florinda?  Hello.  We re Sean and 
                Beverly Lincoln.

                                  FLORINDA
                The gate call.  Guests come.  I say 
                you no here.  

                                  SEAN
                      (beat, then)
                  Brilliant.


The bathroom is vast.  Beverly s in heaven.

                                    BEVERLY
                I m never leaving this room.

They take in the oversized bathtub.

                                  SEAN
                I like a bath you can dock a barge in.

                                    BEVERLY
                      (with a suggestive smile)
                Big enough for two.

He knows that look.

                                  SEAN
                What, now?

                                    BEVERLY
                I m feeling a bit dirty.  You?

                                  SEAN
                Filthy.

They kiss.  

                                    BEVERLY
                So you want to dock that barge?

                                  SEAN
                Always a lady.

They kiss again.

                                  SEAN
                Let s do this.

He quickly starts to undress.  Beverly turns on the water.  
The bath begins to fill.                                                                  12/28/09      17.



Sean and Beverly, both in robes, stare at the bath.  The 
enormous basin is still not even half full of water.  


They continue to stare at the bath.  It s still not full.  The 
moment has passed.  

                                  SEAN
                Or maybe some other time.  

                                    BEVERLY
                Yes.

They start to put their clothes back on.


CAROL RANSOM is ushering Sean and Beverly into her office.  
Carol s the head of Primetime Programing.  In her 40 s.  
Smart.  A real person.  Or an incredible facsimile.  Another 
woman, MYRA, and a man, ANDY, are already in her office.

                                  CAROL
                Merc really wanted to be here, but he 
                had to be in New York.  This is Andy 
                Button, our head of Casting.

                                  ANDY
                Huge fan.  Ohmygod.  I ve been 
                watching tapes of your show.  Beyond 
                  hysterical.  Beyond.  

                                  CAROL 
                And Myra Licht, head of Comedy.

Myra wears a perpetually pained expression.

                                  MYRA
                      (with a grimace)
                It s really funny.

                                  CAROL
                Sit, sit, sit.  So are you settling 
                in?  Some house, huh? 

                                    BEVERLY
                We love it.  The only thing it s 
                missing is a moat.                                                                12/28/09      18.


                                  CAROL
                Get a big rating, Merc ll dig you a 
                moat.

They all chuckle.

                                  ANDY
                She s not kidding.

                                  SEAN
                It is somewhat strangely built.  
                Several of the columns are made of 
                  polystyrene.

                                  CAROL
                Oh my god, they re probably left over 
                from some set.  A lot of producers use 
                that house for reality shows.  They 
                shot a season of  The Bachelor  there.  
                And I think  The Apprentice: LA .  We 
                just had twelve girls living there 
                  competing to become a supermodel.  

                                    BEVERLY
                Right.  The bathroom did have a vague 
                vomity smell.

                                  CAROL
                That would be why.

Beat.

                                  CAROL
                So.   Lyman s Boys .  Let s talk about 
                casting.

                                  SEAN
                Well, we ve got Julian committed to 
                recreate the role of Lyman.  So that s 
                half the battle right there. 

                                  CAROL
                We love Julian.  He s hilarious.  We 
                just need to find a time when he can 
                fly over and audition for Merc.

                                  SEAN
                  Audition?

                                  CAROL
                No one gets cast in anything without 
                Merc seeing them first.                                                                12/28/09      19.


                                    BEVERLY
                That s mad.  Merc loves the show.  
                Julian is the show.  Why should he 
                have to audition?

Andy looks to Carol.  Awkward glances are exchanged.

                                  CAROL
                Yeah.  Um.  Here s the thing.  There s 
                a chance Merc may not have actually 
                seen your show.

                                  SEAN
                What?

                                  CAROL
                I m not saying he hasn t seen it.

                                    BEVERLY
                Has he seen it?

                                  CAROL
                No.

                                  SEAN
                Hang on.  He told us he loved it.  He 
                said he wanted to have sex with it.

                                  CAROL
                Well, if I had a nickel for everything 
                Merc would have sex with sight-
                  unseen... 

                                  ANDY
                She d have a lot of nickels.

                                    BEVERLY
                Then what about it did he love?

                                  CAROL
                Uh, it s a hit?  It wins awards?  It 
                ran for four years?   

                                    BEVERLY
                  Unbelievable...

                                  CAROL
                We ve all seen it.  And we do love it.  
                Which is why Merc really needs to see 
                Julian read.                                                                  12/28/09      20.


                                    BEVERLY
                But we ve already offered him the 
                part.  He gave up a play in the West 
                End to do this.

                                  CAROL
                I hear you.  I do.  And I m sure 
                Merc ll flip for him.  I mean, my god, 
                he s Julian...

                                  ANDY
                Bullard.

                                  CAROL
                Bullard.  

                                  SEAN
                Can t Merc just watch some tapes of 
                the show?

                                  CAROL
                It s better if we do it in person.  
                He s not a big TV watcher.

                                    BEVERLY
                And if we say no?

Andy and Myra look sharply at Carol.  You can feel the fear.  

                                  CAROL
                You don t want to say no to Merc.  You 
                really want him on your team.

                                  SEAN
                  I thought he was on our team.

                                  CAROL
                Totally.  But if he likes Julian -- 
                and he will -- you re pretty much 
                  guaranteed you re on the air.

                                    BEVERLY
                He already guaranteed we re on the 
                air.

                                  CAROL
                  Absolutely.  But you know, nothing s 
                in stone.

                                  SEAN
                  Actually, Merc said this was in stone.

                                  CAROL
                And it is.  But, you know.                                                                12/28/09      21.


                                    BEVERLY
                Clearly we don t know.

                                  CAROL
                It s in stone.  But... stone.  There s 
                things stronger than stone.

                                  SEAN
                Like what?

                                  CAROL
                Like Merc.  Merc is stronger than 
                stone.


Sean and Beverly are with JULIAN BULLARD, veteran actor of 
stage and screen.                                                                  12/28/09      22.


Julian is charming, with a twinkle in his eye.  He glances at 
some script pages, calm and relaxed.  Sean and Beverly are far 
more anxious.  

                                  JULIAN
                  I remember this scene.  It s rather 
                good.

                                  SEAN
                Julian, thank you again for doing 
                this.   

                                    BEVERLY
                We re horrified that you even need to 
                go through this.

                                  JULIAN
                Peaches, don t give it a second 
                thought.  I understand.  I m not new.  
                The king won t let us play till he 
                shows us all how big his dick is.  
                You d think they d have wives and 
                  boyfriends for that...

Andy sticks his head in the door.

                                  ANDY
                Merc s here.  We can start.


Merc, Carol, Myra and Andy are there, as well as a smattering 
of MINOR EXECUTIVES.  Sean and Beverly enter.  

                                  MERC
                      (bad Cockney)
                 Ello, gov nah!

He jumps up and gives them both big Merc hugs.

                                    BEVERLY
                      (re: the hug)
                So it s every time.

                                  SEAN
                Hello, all.  I d like to introduce 
                Julian Bullard.

Julian enters.

                                  MERC
                Welcome.  Thanks for coming in.                                                                  12/28/09      23.


                                  JULIAN
                      (cheeky, not hostile)
                Not at all.  The last time I had to 
                audition was in  87 to do  Private 
                Lives  with Dame Judi at the National.  
                So this is a treat.

                                  MERC
                Well, we all appreciate it.

                                  JULIAN
                And with whom will I be reading?

                                  ANDY
                Me.  Career highlight.

                                  SEAN
                For those who haven t seen this 
                episode, in this scene Lyman has to 
                tell one of the boys he s been asked 
                to leave St. Abban s.

                                  MERC
                      (to the others)
                Oh, this is a good one.

Sean and Beverly stare at him.

                                    BEVERLY
                Wow.

                                  SEAN
                Whenever you re ready.

Julian, in character, turns to Andy.

                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                Robbie.  I m afraid your time at St. 
                Abban s has come to an end.

                                  ANDY (AS BOY)
                Why?

                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                      (choosing his words)
                Well.  The teachers and I think you ll 
                do better at a school with a less 
                  academically demanding curriculum.

                                  ANDY (AS BOY)
                Why?                                                                12/28/09      24.


                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                We believe you need a more... 
                  intellectually diminished environment.

                                  ANDY (AS BOY)
                Why?

                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                Mmm.  How to put this...  You re not 
                bright.

This gets a genuine laugh from Merc and the others.  Sean and 
Beverly are cautiously relieved.

                                  ANDY (AS BOY)
                I m bright.

                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                No.

                                  ANDY (AS BOY)
                I m not stupid.

                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                You re not not stupid.
                      (waits as the boy tries to 
                        figure this out)
                Too many  nots ?

                                  ANDY (AS BOY)
                Maybe I m just not working up to my 
                  potential.

                                  JULIAN
                No.  This is you on all cylinders.  
                There are just no wheels.

Big laugh from the room.  Even Myra chuckles cringingly.

                                  JULIAN
                But all is not bleak.  For, young man, 
                you have something far more important 
                than intelligence.  You re attractive.  
                And in the real world, that will get 
                you much, much further.  There isn t a 
                Nobel laureate who wouldn t happily 
                give up twenty IQ points for chiseled 
                  cheekbones and a full head of hair.  
                Plus you re pleasant and your family 
                is rich.  My god, you could be running 
                this country some day!  And I assure 
                you, intelligence would only get in 
                your way.                                                                12/28/09      25.


And... scene.  The room applauds.  Huge reaction.  Beverly and 
Sean are enormously relieved.  They mouth  thank you  and 
offer a little bow to Julian who smiles, pleased.

                                  CAROL
                Julian, could you give us a minute?

                                  JULIAN
                  Certainly.

He leaves.  Everyone looks to Merc.

                                  MERC
                Wow.  He s the real deal, huh? 

                                  SEAN
                Yes, he is.

                                  MERC
                That was a treat, I ve gotta tell you.

                                    BEVERLY
                So we re all set?

                                  MERC
                Mmmm...

                                    BEVERLY
                Yes?

                                  MERC
                      (big sigh)
                Is it me, or does anyone else feel he 
                comes off a bit too... English?

                                  CAROL AND THE OTHERS
                I know what you mean.  A little.  
                English.  I heard it.

                                    BEVERLY
                Hmm.  Too English.  Possibly it s 
                because he s English?

                                  MERC
                Yeah, no, I dunno.  He just sounds a 
                  little... butler-y.  I mean, if we re 
                doing an American version of the show...

                                  SEAN
                Right.  But he s playing the 
                  headmaster of an elite boarding 
                school.  The boys will be American.  
                The other teachers.  Why can t he be 
                British?                                                                12/28/09      26.


                                  MERC
                I hear you.  But... we need the 
                audience to like him.


Beverly and Sean are with Julian.  They re beyond mortified.

                                    BEVERLY
                I can t believe we re even asking you 
                to do this.  Truly, I m having an out-
                of-body experience.  I may be sick.

                                  SEAN
                Julian.  We d understand completely if 
                you say no.  We do.  But... could you 
                possibly do the scene again with an 
                American accent?

                                  JULIAN
                      (unfazed)
                No problem.

                                  SEAN
                Really?

                                  JULIAN
                Dear ones, I was doing Tennessee 
                Williams and Eugene O Neill before you 
                were born.

                                    BEVERLY
                How old are you?

                                  JULIAN
                      (good natured)
                Piss off.


Beverly and Sean return with Julian.  

                                  SEAN
                      (wry)
                You all remember Julian Bullard.

                                  MERC AND OTHERS
                Hi.  Welcome back.

                                  SEAN
                Shall we do this?

Julian and Andy begin the scene again.  Julian speaks with an 
impeccable American accent.  He s flawless.                                                                  12/28/09      27.


Only this time, he s absolutely not funny.  Perhaps because 
the pace is different, or his affect is flatter.  But the 
magic is gone. 

                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                Robbie.  I m afraid your time at St. 
                Abban s has come to an end.

                                  ANDY (AS BOY)
                Why?

                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                Well.  The teachers and I think you ll 
                do better at a school with a less 
                  academically demanding curriculum.

                                  ANDY (AS BOY)
                Why?

                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                We believe you need a more... 
                  intellectually diminished environment.

                                  ANDY (AS BOY)
                Why?

                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                Mmm.  How to put this...  You re not 
                bright.

No response from the audience.  Silence.  Crickets.  Sean and 
Beverly glance anxiously at each other.  Julian feels it, too.

                                  ANDY (AS BOY)
                I m bright.

                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                No.

                                  ANDY (AS BOY)
                I m not stupid.

                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                You re not not stupid.
                      (then)
                Too many  nots ?

Again, silence.  Julian starts to sweat.

                                  JULIAN
                Sorry.  May I try that last bit again?

                                  MERC
                Please.                                                                12/28/09      28.


                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                We believe you need a more... 
                  intellectually diminished environment.

                                  ANDY (AS BOY)
                Why?

                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                Mmm.  How to put this...  You re not 
                bright.

Again, it s just not funny.  The silence is punishing. 

                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                      (tries different inflections)
                You re not bright.  You re not bright.  
                You re stupid.  

Nothing.  Merc is stony.  Myra looks constipated.  The flop 
sweat is pouring off Julian.  Sean and Beverly are dying.

                                  JULIAN
                Maybe Southern.

                                  SEAN/BEVERLY
                  Southern.  Yes.  Brilliant.

                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                      (with Southern accent)
                You re not bright.

                                  ANDY (AS BOY)
                I m bright.

                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                No.

                                  ANDY (AS BOY)
                I m not stupid.

                                  JULIAN (AS LYMAN)
                You re not not stupid.  Too many 
                   nots ... there... pardner?
                      (as himself)
                  I suppose that would be if I were the 
                  headmaster of a cowboy school.
                      (then)
                  Allrightee, I believe we ve seen 
                enough.  I know my way out.  Thank me 
                very much for coming.  And let s hope 
                to Christ there s a bar at my hotel.

He briskly exits, a broken man.  After a long silence:                                                                12/28/09      29.


                                  MYRA
                      (grimacing as always)
                He just didn t make me laugh.


Sean is pouring a truly enormous glass of Scotch.  Beverly 
sits nearby.  They both look stunned.  Shell-shocked.

                                  SEAN
                What just happened?

                                    BEVERLY
                I don t know.
                      (re: the Scotch)
                In case you re wondering, I ll be 
                wanting at least that much.

                                  SEAN
                Shit!

He slams his fist into a nearby column.  As it is polystyrene, 
it goes right over.  Sean regains his composure.

                                  SEAN
                All right.  All right.  Let s look on 
                the positive side --

                                    BEVERLY
                Positive side??

                                  SEAN
                Well --

                                    BEVERLY
                No!  Just once, please, do not try and 
                find a positive side.  Because even if 
                you can, which I very much doubt, my 
                Negative is so much, much bigger than 
                your Positive.  In fact, my Negative 
                openly mocks your Positive.  My 
                Negative slaps your Positive around.  
                My Negative grabs your Positive, bends 
                it over the couch and buggers it from 
                behind.  

                                  SEAN
                      (tiny throat clear)
                My Positive did not enjoy that.

The phone rings.  Beverly answers.                                                                12/28/09      30.


                                    BEVERLY
                Hello.  Hi, Carol.  
                      (to Sean)
                It s Carol.

                                  SEAN
                Put her on that speaker thing.

INTERCUT WITH:


Carol is also talking on speaker.  Myra and Andy are with her.

                                  CAROL
                Hi, kids.  Tough day.

Beverly rolls her eyes.

                                  SEAN
                Yes.  Yes, it was.

                                  CAROL
                We all feel terrible.  Merc is sending 
                you a basket of loganberries.  

                                    BEVERLY
                Lovely.

She gives the phone the finger.

                                  CAROL
                So how are you two doing?

                                  SEAN
                      (off Beverly s threatening 
                        look)
                Well, we re not feeling positive, I 
                can tell you that.

                                  CAROL
                I m sure.  Anyway.  We should all try 
                and look forward.  We still love the 
                show.

                                  ANDY
                We do.

                                  MYRA
                      (removes something from her 
                        hair)
                What is this?                                                                12/28/09      31.


                                    BEVERLY
                Well, it s hard for us to imagine 
                doing it without Julian.

                                  CAROL
                  I understand.  But before we go there, 
                we wanted to share an idea with you.  
                It s a different way to go, so keep 
                your minds open.  We just found out 
                that there s an actor available.  Huge 
                star, hysterically funny, the audience 
                loves him, and he s ready to come back 
                to TV.  Merc thinks he d be perfect 
                for this. 

                                  SEAN
                      (always hopeful)
                Really?  Who?

                                  CAROL
                Matt Leblanc.

Long pause.  Carol and the others lean toward the phone 
waiting for a response.  On the other end, Beverly and Sean 
are beyond words.   

FADE OUT.


                                      END OF SHOW
