DEBO is laid out on the grass.
CRAIG (V.O.)
In the movies, when you beat up the
neighborhood bully; you suppose to live
happily ever after.
But around here;
that's when all the drama begins...
Blue and red police lights flash over Debo's body.
Two
sheriffs walk INTO OUR FRAME and stand over Debo.
They flash
their lights on him.
CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)
Last Friday; I got fired for the first
time.
I got high for the first time.
I
got shot at for the first time and I
kicked Debo's ass for the first time...
They get him to his feet; but he stumbles and falls in the
bushes like a knocked out prize fighter.
The sheriffs laugh
at him.
Debo looks dazed and confused.
The sheriffs help him out the
bushes and start to cuff him.
CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)
I was the man that night; and Debo ended
up going to jail for a couple of years.
But he told Ezal he was getting out next
Friday.
He said, when he see me, he was
gonna smoke me on the spot...
They walk him OUT OF FRAME...
FADE TO BLACK.
OVER BLACK:
CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)
And today is next Friday...
SOUNDTRACK!
"New Line Cinema presents, etc., etc...
FADE IN:
OPENING CREDITS.
It's early Friday morning and the sun peeks
over the LA skyline.
As the city starts to awake and the
credits continue to roll;
we see SEVERAL SHOTS of the real people who make up Los
Angeles.
It seems that they all move to the same beat.
Debo is released from the Twin Towers County Jail.
Still in
his orange jumpsuit, he walks right past us and down the
street.
Everybody clears his path.
SOUNDTRACK still PUMPIN'.
Debo crosses the street passing an old man dancing and
directing traffic.
Debo stops, the man starts to dance in
front of him.
He stares for a second, then he's on his way.
Still walking tall and hard, he trips over a crack in the
sidewalk (losing cool points).
Three little black girls in plaid uniforms practice the
latest dance steps on their way to school.
Debo is walking
towards them.
They scream and take off in the other
direction.
He smiles.
Briefly.
Still walking; he stops at a corner.
A SA boy waits to cross
with his low-rider bike.
A Metrolink train passes.
After it
goes by; we see Debo riding off on the boy's bike.
He's on
the ground holding his eye.
Debo continues to ride through the city.
He turns a corner or two and comes to a stop at Craig's
house.
Mr. Jones' dog catcher's truck sits in front of the house.
A CHIHUAHUA (like the Taco Bell dog) takes a dump on the
lawn.
It starts to BARK at Debo.
He looks down at the dog
and kicks him in the street.
The DOG YIPES!
Debo focuses his attention on Craig's house.
The front door opens.
Mr. Jones walks out the door, yelling
back into the house.
MR. JONES
Craig!
Let's go!
I don't wanna hit that
traffic.
He steps off the porch backwards and into "fresh Chihuahua
shit."
He slips and falls on the grass.
MR. JONES (cont'd)
I be got damn.
Mr. Jones gets up.
He brushes the grass off his uniform.
He
looks clean, but when he turns around dog shit is smashed all
over his back and butt.
MR. JONES (cont'd)
Craig!
Craig!
Craig emerges from the house with his bags in hand.
CRAIG
(irritated)
Here I come!
MR. JONES
(still mad)
Well bring yo' ass on...
Craig slams the door and starts towards the truck.
CRAIG
What's the matter?
MR. JONES
I fell in some mud.
Now hurry up!
Mr. Jones gets in the truck.
Craig jumps in.
They back out
and pull off.
They exit the freeway and pass a sign that reads, "Rancho
Cucamonga" (the city away from the city).
Welcome to the suburbs.
Where the "Smiley Happy People" live
in peace and quiet.
The neighborhood is full of green lawns and nice two story
track homes as far as the eye can see.
The yellow truck
drives through the streets and pulls up to a cul-de-sac.
Mr.
Jones BLOWS the HORN.
MR. JONES
Nice neighborhood, huh?
CRAIG
It's alright.
MR. JONES
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass
brother hits the lotto his first time
playing.
I still can't figure that one
out.
CRAIG
Why they got to have the loudest house on
the block!
Uncle Elroy's house is royal blue with gold trim.
All the
other houses are painted in earth tones.
MR. JONES
Ah, son, don't be no hater.
You know
your uncle ain't got no taste.
Just
don't let him rub off on you.
Craig grabs his bags.
CRAIG
You coming in?
MR. JONES
No, I'mma go on to work.
I don't wanna
hear Elroy's mouth.
Now listen to me,
Craig.
It's gonna be different living
over here.
Don't let your uncle and your
cousin get you into no shit.
Understand?
CRAIG
Hey, Pops, I'm grown.
Can't nobody get
me in trouble no more.
As craig gets out;
the front door flies open.
It's DAY-DAY
(22), Craig's crazy younger cousin.
He yells back into the
house.
DAY-DAY
Daddy, Craig is here.
Day-Day walks out to the car and gives Craig a pound.
CRAIG
What's crackin'?
DAY-DAY
You.
Hi, Uncle Willie.
MR. JONES
Hey, Day-Day.
Where's yo' big head
father?
DAY-DAY
There he is.
Just then, UNCLE ELROY (42) hits the door.
Dressed in boxers
and a T-shirt.
This is Mr. Jones' (very loud) little
brother.
UNCLE ELROY
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass-
whippin'?
CRAIG
Naw, it ain't like that.
UNCLE ELROY
If you see that boy again, bite off his
ear off like Mike Tyson.
CRAIG
Alright, I'll remember that.
UNCLE ELROY
You know me?
I would've shot his big
ass.
(peeking into the ear)
Hey, Willie, how's it going?
Still
steppin' in dog shit every day?
Uncle Elroy laughs.
Mr. Jones isn't amused.
MR. JONES
Make sure you look after my son out here.
Don't get him involved with none of your
bullshit, Roy.
UNCLE ELROY
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.
He
in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho
Chocomunga, baby!
This my world, you
just a nigga late paying rent.
Ain't
that right, nephew?
Uncle Elroy hugs Craig by the arm.
MR. JONES
Craig, remember what I told you.
CRAIG
I'll remember.
Mr. Jones pulls off.
Uncle Elroy yells out to him.
UNCLE ELROY
Send Betty my love.
(to Craig)
Boy you looking good.
(grabbing his bags)
I'mma take these in the house for you,
man... and when you finish with this cat,
come inside.
I got something to show
you.
CRAIG
Thanks, Unc.
Uncle Elroy starts towards to the house.
DAY-DAY
You know it's been over a year since we
kicked it last?
Up at the family
reunion.
CRAIG
I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed
out everybody, and threw up in Aunt
Faye's backseat.
Day-Day laughs.
DAY-DAY
Yep.
I forgot about him cussin' out
everybody.
Damn that was fun.
CRAIG
I know, we had a good time.
But ever
since you guys moved out here, it seems
like we've lost touch.
DAY-DAY
I know; this a long way from Watts.
But
what I like about living out here is that
you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens,
no drive-by's, no nothing.
Just peace
and quiet.
Listen.
They do.
It is quiet, except for a few BIRDS SINGING.
DAY-DAY (cont'd)
Shit sound good, huh?
Just then, a maroon Cadillac low-rider on Daytons rolls up
the block.
It's the Jokers: JOKER (28), LI'L JOKER (21) and
BABY JOKER (15).
They pull into their driveway.
DAY-DAY (cont'd)
Aw damn.
In SLOW MOTION: One by one they get out the car.
They have a
dog with them named "Cheeco."
As they get to the front door
they all look over at Craig and Day-Day.
Day-Day looks away, while Craig keeps his eye on them.
They
disappear inside.
CRAIG
Who is that?
DAY-DAY
Joker, he just got out of the pen.
Li'l
Joker, he just got out of Youth
Authority.
And Baby Joker, he just got
out of Juvenile Hall.
CRAIG
They ever let you hit the switches on
that Cadillac?
DAY-DAY
Naw, them dudes is assholes.
Especially
that dog - Cheeco.
Watch this little
ass, he's sneaky.
Plus, I got something
better than a Cadillac.
They walk over to his black BMW 325i on chrome rims.
CRAIG
This you?
DAY-DAY
(proud)
Yeah, that's me.
Just a little somethin'
somethin' I picked up.
CRAIG
Must be nice.
I wish we won the lottery.
Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
DAY-DAY
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying
off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end
up with a million.
We bought this house
and I spent the rest on this.
It's the
bomb, huh?
CRAIG
This my baby.
I feel like a new nigga in
this car.
I get mo' phone numbers
rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus.
MISS HO KYM (O.S.)
Hi, Day-Day!
They turn to spot MISS HO KYM (67), the old Korean lady who
lives next door.
She's sitting on her porch nursing a cup of
coffee.
DAY-DAY
(speaking louder and slower)
Hi, Mulan.
MISS HO KYM
Fuck you, Day-Day.
Who's ya boy?
DAY-DAY
This my cousin, Craig.
He just moved out
here from L.A.
Craig, this is Miss Ho.
Day-Day smiles at Craig.
MISS HO KYM
My name is Miss Ho Kym.
Day-Day just
trying to be a smart ass.
Nice to meet
you, Craig.
Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
CRAIG
Excuse me?
MISS HO KYM
I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it --
rowdy, rowdy?
Craig can't believe his ears.
CRAIG
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
MISS HO KYM
Well, then, it's all good.
Yo, Day-Day,
something is going down with those
Mexicans across the street?
I've been
seeing a lot of activity.
They all look over at the Joker's house.
CRAIG
What kind of activity?
MISS HO KYM
Strange activity.
I think they running
drugs off Tijuana.
Day-Day don't believe
me.
DAY-DAY
How do you know for sure?
MISS HO KYM
I know everything, playboy.
Don't hate,
congratulate.
DAY-DAY
I don't have time, Miss Ho, I'll see you
later.
Day-Day and Craig start to walk back to the house.
MISS HO KYM
See you later, Day-Day.
Come by after
work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
CRAIG
Nice to meet you?
MISS HO KYM
Peace out, Craig.
It's D'WANA (20), Day-Day's six-month pregnant girlfriend.
She's walking on the right side of his BMW.
With one hand
she waves at Craig...with the other hand she's keying Day-
Day's car with the skills of a retarded first-grader.
D'Wana continues her job.
Day-Day storms over, waving the
paper.
DAY-DAY
Girl, you supposed to be 1000 feet from
my house.
What you doing over here?
D'WANA
What it look like I'm doing?
You can't
quit me, I'm pregnant!
DAY-DAY
That ain't my baby!
Day-Day spots the damage.
He loses it.
DAY-DAY (cont'd)
(in disbelief)
Oh, my God!
What you doing?!
Now he's a madman.
DAY-DAY (cont'd)
Bitch!
You keyed my car!
I'mma kill
you!
Day-Day charges D'Wana.
She has her pepper spray ready.
D'WANA
I got your bitch right here.
D'Wana sprays his face orange.
He stops in his tracks; grabs
his eyes and screams like a woman.
DAY-DAY
Awwwww....
(staggering)
Awwwww....
D'WANA
I expect you to return all phone calls
and take me to lunch today.
I'll be back
out here on my break.
Nobody quits me.
D'Wana runs to her car.
She speeds off.
Uncle Elroy goes
for the water hose.
Craig grabs Day-Day.
DAY-DAY
I can't see!
I can't see!
Daddy!
CRAIG
Lay down, Day-Day.
Stop moving.
Craig puts him on the grass.
DAY-DAY
She pepper-sprayed me, man!
She pepper-
sprayed me!
CRAIG
I know, be still.
Before he can say another word, Uncle Elroy nearly drowns him
with the water hose.
UNCLE ELROY
Boy, you got you a little fatal
attraction, huh?
I had two or three of
them in my day.
Day-Day is drowning.
UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
Craig, I hope you know how to deal with
women better than this fool.
Craig moves the hose.
CRAIG
That's too much water.
Now Day-Day is blind and choking.
UNCLE ELROY
Help him to his feet.
Let's get him to
the bathroom.
They get him up and into the house.
Uncle Elroy and Craig start to walk around the back yard.
In
the B.G., we NOTICE giant weed plants everywhere.
UNCLE ELROY
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to
live out here, Craig.
I never thought
I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the
suburbs.
But as soon as I got my check,
I was gone.
Paid 230 thousand dollars
cash on this house.
CRAIG
You paid cash?
UNCLE ELROY
Cash money.
They wasn't gonna stick me
with no 30-year payment plan.
That's for
suckas.
They got my daddy like that for
a Cadillac years ago.
I got the only
house on the block that's paid for.
That's why I'm the king around here.
They walk over to the pool.
UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
You like that pool?
It's half-full with dirty water.
An upside-down lawn chair
floats in it.
CRAIG
It's cool, but where's the water?
UNCLE ELROY
Don't need water.
We didn't have no pool
in the projects...so none of us swim.
CRAIG
Y'all never use it?
UNCLE ELROY
Never...
(humping the air)
But me and Suga can get real nasty in
that Jacuzzi, though.
The Jacuzzi water has a purple condom floating in it.
Uncle
Elroy reaches over and picks it out.
UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
(shaking the water off the
condom)
You welcome get in it anytime you want
to.
Shit, you my brother's son.
CRAIG
That's okay, Unc.
I can't swim, either.
UNCLE ELROY
Good.
A run-down crack house sits alone in the middle of the block.
It looks deserted with chipped paint, overgrown grass and
security bars everywhere.
Inside we can hear a FIGHT in
progress.
CRACK DEALER (O.S.)
Ezal, I'm sick of you coming around here
wit no money.
Suddenly the door flies open and Ezal comes flying out on his
ass.
EZAL
I be damned.
He gets up and brushes himself off.
He heads back into the
crack house.
EZAL (cont'd)
Now look here, man.
I'mma preferred
customer and I can take my credit card
somewhere else.
SMACK!
SMACK!
SMACK!
Ezal is roughed up some more and
flies through the picture window.
GLASS rains down.
EZAL (cont'd)
Oh, my neck, oh, my back.
Man, I quit!
I'm retired!
Officially!
Life shouldn't
be this hard for a crackhead!
Ezal lays there in pain.
Out of nowhere, a bicycle comes
INTO FRAME.
Ezal looks up at the rider.
It's Debo.
DEBO
Where did Craig move to?
EZAL
I don't know, Debo.
Debo rolls on top of him with the front tire.
Ezal is
smashed and in more pain.
DEBO
What you say?
EZAL
(hurting)
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his
cousin Day-Day.
DEBO
Rancho Cucamonga?
EZAL
Yeah.
Debo thinks about it.
EZAL (cont'd)
I can't breathe.
He rolls off of Ezal.
Relief.
DEBO
Get on.
EZAL
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on
that.
DEBO
Get on!
Ezal hops on the handlebars quick.
They start to ride off.
EZAL
Just don't go over the curb.
Debo rides over the curb and into the street.
The journey
begins.
EZAL (cont'd)
Watch my balls!
As they walk out the front door, someone catches Craig's eye.
It's KARLA (23), the Joker brothers' fine sister.
She's
leaning against the lowrider, looking into her purse.
She
waves at them.
KARLA
(friendly)
Hi!
Craig and Day-Day are mesmerized.
BOTH
(waving back)
HEY!
Craig and Karla's eyes meet.
She smiles.
CRAIG
Who is that?
DAY-DAY
That's the sister.
CRAIG
Yo know what?
I'm starting to like
Rancho Cucamonga.
DAY-DAY
I know what 'cha thinking.
I thought the
same thing.
But it can't happen.
CRAIG
Why?
DAY-DAY
Because, it's been a little tension
between us ever since they got out the
joint and ran their momma crazy.
And I'm
just trying to keep the peace.
We moved
out here to get away from that shit.
Day-Day walks over to his Beamer.
Craig follows.
CLOSE-UP
Big scratch on the side of Day-Day's car.
WIDER
DAY-DAY (cont'd)
It ain't that bad, is it?
Craig is still looking at Karla.
DAY-DAY (cont'd)
Craig!
It ain't that bad, is it?
CRAIG
Yeah, it's bad.
And that scratch make it
ugly.
Day-Day is starting to get mad.
CRAIG (cont'd)
It's long and crooked...make you not
wanna even drive it.
DAY-DAY
Alright, alright... I see what you
talking about.
Karla looks at her watch and starts to walk up the street.
This is Craig's chance.
CRAIG
Hold up, Day-Day.
He trots after her.
DAY-DAY
Let it go.
Karla is still walking.
CRAIG
Hey!
Hey!
She stops and waits for him.
CRAIG (cont'd)
I'm Day-Day's cousin, Craig.
What's your
name?
KARLA
Karla.
CRAIG
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty
good together.
Where you going?
KARLA
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
CRAIG
Oh yeah, why you walking?
KARLA
My brothers won't give me a ride.
Day-Day is about to have a heart attack.
He's looking back
and forth between Craig and Karla, and the Joker's house
where somebody is looking out the window.
DAY-DAY
(to himself)
Just get the number and come on.
Just
get the number and come on.
Back at the "Love Connection," Craig has Karla smiling.
CRAIG
You want us to give you a ride?
KARLA
I don't know.
CRAIG
What you mean, you don't know?
Just wait
here.
Craig starts to trot over towards Day-Day.
Day-Day is
frantically waving Craig to hurry.
CRAIG (cont'd)
What are you worried about?
Day-Day's eyes get as big as golf balls.
DAY-DAY
Cheeco!
Craig turns to see the pit bull "Cheeco" running right after
him.
KARLA
Cheeco, no!
Craig runs right towards Day-Day's BMW.
DAY-DAY
Oh shit, jump!
They both jump on top of Day-Day's BMW with CHEECO coming up
fast.
He's BARKING viciously.
ACROSS STREET
Joker, Li'l Joker and Baby Joker are across the street
laughing.
Karla is embarrassed.
ON BMW
Craig is breathing hard but he's calm, but Day-Day is
terrified.
DAY-DAY (cont'd)
Hey, Joker!
Stop playing, man!
Call the
dog back!
They continue to laugh.
Craig pulls his belt off.
He swings
it and hits Cheeco in the middle of his forehead with the
buckle.
The DOG CRIES and runs back across the street.
The Jokers aren't laughing anymore.
Joker stares at Craig.
Craig stares back.
You can feel the tension.
Joker kicks
the dog.
JOKER
Get yo dumb ass in the back.
CHEECO HOLLERS.
Craig and Day-Day get off the top of the
BMW.
DAY-DAY
Look at my roof.
Big dents in the roof of his BMW.
DAY-DAY (cont'd)
Man, why you do that?
I told you not to
talk to that girl.
CRAIG
Why not?
She was cool with it.
Day-Day gets into the car.
DAY-DAY
So.
CRAIG
What you mean, so?
DAY-DAY
If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and
start a feud, you can always go back to
home.
I gotta live here.
Just remember
that.
He slams the door, starts the car and backs up.
Leaving
Craig standing there.
He sees Karla walking away.
He looks
over at the Jokers.
They're still staring hard.
Craig just
looks away and walks into the house.
Debo is riding Ezal on the handlebars.
EZAL
We gotta stop or something, man.
My ass
is hurting.
This handlebar is hard.
Debo keeps riding.
EZAL (cont'd)
Debo!
Debo!
Now you stuck on stupid.
He finally stops at a pay phone.
Ezal jumps off and grabs
his ass.
EZAL (cont'd)
My God...gotta walk it out, walk it out.
Man, it's gonna take us a week to ride
out there.
DEBO
Shut up!
He still eats here every day!
Mr. Jones' dog truck sits in front.
DEBO
Here's the plan.
You gonna call over
there and say you have a very urgent
message for Mr. William Jones.
EZAL
What urgent message?
DEBO
If you shut up I'll tell you.
The urgent
message is...Drop everything!
Craig is
in trouble.
Come quick, don't call.
EZAL
That ain't gonna work.
Debo slaps him in the back of the head.
DEBO
Just do it.
EZAL
I don't know the number.
Smack!
Debo slaps him again.
DEBO
It's on the outside of the building, now
pick the phone up!
Ezal picks up the phone.
He starts to dial.
EZAL
Hello...Yeah, I got an urgent message for
a nigga named Mr. Willie Jones.
Debo slaps him again.
DEBO
William.
EZAL
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a
customer named William Jones.
Drop
everything, Craig is in trouble.
Come
quick.
Don't try to call.
Ezal hangs up the phone.
EZAL (cont'd)
Man, you better stop hittin' on me for I
do you like Craig did you.
DEBO
Let's go.
Debo and Ezal run across the street to the dog truck.
Debo
opens the back and lets all the dogs out.
They run for it.
DEBO (cont'd)
After I get in, close the door.
Debo is a hard fit.
Ezal stuffs him in there.
EZAL
You too big.
DEBO
Keep pushing.
Finally he's in.
Ezal gets in and slams the door shut.
Just
then, Mr. Jones comes running out the joint with a sandwich
in hand.
MR. JONES
Oh my God!
He gets in and speeds off.
Cars pull in and out of this 12 store strip mall where
Pinky's is located.
Day-Day runs around the side of Pinky's Records store.
He
stops to see if anyone is coming.
It's Baby'D with the three
others trailing.
Baby'D is chasing Day-Day all through the
parking lot.
Craig, D'Wana and Roach stop to watch.
ROACH
Haul ass, dude.
Don't stop.
...and he is.
CRAIG
You better stop running from that girl.
DAY-DAY
Fuuuuuuck -- U!
He runs back towards his BMW.
The chase continues around his
car.
Baby'D is starting to tire.
DAY-DAY (cont'd)
I'mma shoot yo' big ass.
D'Wana watches from a distance.
Craig and Roach are close.
ROACH
(smiling)
She moves well for a big girl.
Just then, out of nowhere, Karla appears behind them carrying
a couple of bags.
She taps Craig on his shoulder.
He turns
around.
KARLA
Hello, remember me?
CRAIG
Hell yeah, I remember you.
KARLA
I'm sorry for what my brother did this
morning.
They're assholes.
CRAIG
It's cool.
You ain't got to apologize
for your brothers.
They're big boys.
KARLA
I just wanted to give you this.
She hands him a card with her number on it.
KARLA (cont'd)
If my brothers wasn't so over-protective,
I'd have you call the house.
But for now
just page me when you get a chance.
CRAIG
Most definitely.
KARLA
Better sooner than later.
She picks up her shopping bags and walks away.
Over at the
chase: Baby'D is winded.
She bends over trying to catch her
breath.
DAY-DAY
Baby'D, you're not going to catch me as
usual.
So what can we do to end it this
time?
What you want?
Another Big Pun
CD?
'Cause I gotta get back to work.
Baby'D looks over at Craig.
BABY'D
Okay, I know what I want this time.
DAY-DAY
Anything you need.
BABY'D
Yo' cousin, Craig.
Hook us up.
DAY-DAY
That's it?
BABY'D
Just tell him to come over here and talk
to me.
DAY-DAY
And I can go free?
BABY'D
Go, fo' I change my mind.
Day-Day carefully walks back over towards the store.
D'Wana
pouts and walks towards Baby'D.
(If looks could kill.)
ROACH
Great moves, Day-Day.
CRAIG
What happen?
DAY-DAY
We worked out a deal.
All you gotta do
is go over there and talk to Baby'D.
Craig looks over at Baby'D.
She's waiting.
CRAIG
What you mean talk to her?
ROACH
(still smiling)
You know what he mean, dude.
CRAIG
I'm gone.
Craig turns and sprints into the store.
Baby'D looks
concerned.
Day-Day grabs Roach and they run into the store.
BABY'D
I'mma get you, Day-Day!
You gotta come
out sometimes!
D'Wana hands her a brick.
D'WANA
I told you.
Baby'D screams and throws the brick through Day-Day's
WINDSHIELD.
A pink limo pulls to a stop.
The chauffeur gets out wearing
his suit just a little too tight.
He opens the door and a
pair of pink boots hit the pavement.
The CAMERA PANS UP TO
PINKY (35), the asshole owner.
PINKY
Look, man, you hittin' them goddamn
corners too fast.
Slow down.
I almost
spilled my Hennessy on this 300 dollar
suit.
He walks over to the door.
He thinks it's open.
It's not.
PINKY (cont'd)
I be damn.
He shakes the door.
It's locked.
He looks inside.
No one's
at the counter.
Cassettes all over the floor.
Pinky looks
around making sure no one sneaks up on him.
He reaches under
his shirt and pulls out a Glock 9mm.
Sticks his key in the
door and steps in.
BACK STORE AREA - CLOSE UP - ROACH
is upside down.
All the blood has rushed to his head.
He
has Chinaman eyes and a big smile on his face.
DAY-DAY
Roach, what are you doing?
ROACH
R-U-S-H Intensely.
A big cloud of smoke rolls out of his mouth and he falls and
hits the deck.
ROACH (cont'd)
My spleen.
Craig and Day-Day laugh at Roach.
The VACUUM is still GOING
but the room is very smoky.
Craig jumps in.
CRAIG
(unplugging the vacuum)
This vacuum don't work.
Where's the
restroom?
DAY-DAY
Out the door and to the left.
ROACH
I thought the vacuum would work.
IN HALLWAY
Craig makes a left and grabs the knob.
He feels something
pressing on the back of his head (gun).
PINKY
(whispering)
Don't move or I'll blow your head smooth
off.
Craig throws his hands up.
PINKY (cont'd)
Now back up slowly... and don't say a
word.
He obeys.
Pinky backs Craig into the store.
PINKY (cont'd)
Get on the floor.
Craig gets down.
PINKY (cont'd)
Little mothafucka trying to rob me.
I'mma show you how I do 'em.
CRAIG
I ain't trying to rob you...
PINKY
Shut up!
Fo' I pump this Glock in yo'
ass!
What did you do wit Day-Day and
Roach?
CRAIG
Man, Day-Day is my people!
PINKY
I said shut up!
Now who sent you?
CRAIG
Nobody!
PINKY
If you say another word, it's over.
I'm
not playing!
Pinky starts to pat down Craig's pockets.
PINKY (cont'd)
You ain't got no gun, but where's the
weed at?
I smell it.
Craig says nothing.
PINKY (cont'd)
I'mma tie you ass up!
Pinky backs up and steps on Roach's skateboard.
The gun goes
flying and so does he.
Pinky falls on his ass.
The 9mm
lands in front of Craig.
There's a big scramble for the gun.
BACK STORAGE AREA
The mood is serious.
DAY-DAY
I gotta think of a plan to get this money
before tomorrow.
ROACH
You could sell your Beamer.
Day-Day gives Roach the evil-eye.
ROACH (cont'd)
My bad.
DAY-DAY
I don't know.
I hope Craig got a good
idea.
We gotta ask him when he comes
out.
Let's go and clean up before Pinky
gets here.
ROACH
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the
money.
DAY-DAY
Yoooo, that's it.
You ain't as dumb as I
think you are, Roach.
ROACH
I know.
BACK INSIDE STORE
Pinky and Craig are still scrambling for the gun.
The store
looks like a tornado hit it.
Twice.
Craig comes up with the
pistol.
Pinky jumps on the ground.
PINKY
Don't kill me.
Craig is exhausted.
He stands over Pinky with the gun.
CRAIG
Shut up.
I been trying to tell yo' ass
that... Day-Day is my cousin.
They're
right there in the back.
PINKY
Whatever you say, man.
I didn't see
shit.
The safe combination is 34-5-27.
Just take it all.
Just then, Day-Day and Roach come from the back.
DAY-DAY
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
CRAIG
Nothing.
PINKY
Day-Day, is this your cousin?
DAY-DAY
Yeah.
PINKY
Good.
You fired...and, Roach, your fired
too.
ROACH
Why me?
PINKY
I smell weed.
He looks up at Craig.
PINKY (cont'd)
And you...you lucky.
I was just about to
get in yo' ass.
Now give me my pistol
back and get the hell out my store.
Craig looks at Day-Day.
Day-Day looks back at him.
Nobody's
high now.
Mr. Jones' dog truck is weaving in and out of traffic.
The Beamer pulls into the driveway.
Our trio get out with
very long faces.
CRAIG (V.O.)
In a strange way, I feel responsible for
Day-Day getting fired.
If I wouldn't
have fought Pinky, and gave Day-Day the
joint, he'd still have a job.
Day-Day walks into the house while Craig and Roach stay out
on the porch.
The dog truck exits the freeway.
He pulls into a gas station
by the freeway.
He stops near the restrooms and jumps out,
air freshner in hand.
When he gets to the door, it's locked.
MR. JONES
Damn.
He knocks.
MR. JONES (cont'd)
Say, man, hurry up.
We got an emergency
out here.
No answer.
Mr. Jones paces nervously.
MR. JONES (cont'd)
I knew I shouldn't have ordered that
extra hot sauce.
Craig and Day-Day are trying to think.
Roach is practicing
skateboard moves.
He's not very good.
DAY-DAY
Man, sit down.
He knocks again.
MR. JONES
Say, man, what the hell you doing in
there?
Open the door.
Just then the door opens and out walks MICHAEL JORDAN.
MICHAEL JORDAN
Don't nobody go in the bathroom for about
35, 40 minutes.
Mr. Jones is stunned.
MR. JONES
Hey, you that boy?
Jordan jumps in his car and he's gone.
Mr. Jones is happy
he's just seen Michael Jordan.
MR. JONES (cont'd)
(smiling)
Ain't that something, Michael Jordan.
He walks in the bathroom.
INSIDE
Reality hits, it stinks up in there.
Mr. Jones fronds.
MR. JONES (cont'd)
Oh, Michael, that boy better check his
drawls.
He starts to spray.
Craig, Day-Day and Roach are sitting on the porch thinking.
DAY-DAY
What we gonna do?
CRAIG
I don't know yet.
ROACH
I know what I'mma do.
Go home and face
the music.
My dad is gonna kick my ass
for getting fired again.
He gets on his skateboard.
DAY-DAY
Alright, Roach, see you around.
CRAIG
Sorry about today, man.
ROACH
Yeah, me too.
Later.
He attempts to jump off the porch with his board and lands
dead on his ass once again.
His board continues to roll.
DAY-DAY
Man, sit down.
I can't think with you
falling everywhere.
His board continues to roll into the street.
At this same
time, Joker's low-rider rolls by and breaks his board in two.
Roach runs to pick up the pieces.
ROACH
My board!
The Joker Bros. back their low-rider into the driveway.
They
have no sympathy.
Cheeco (the pitbull) is in the back yard.
He's happy to see them.
They stroll into the house with three Mexican girls with
them.
Joker spots our trio looking.
JOKER
What the fuck you looking at?
DAY-DAY
Nothing.
ROACH
You ran over my board!
JOKER
So what?
It shouldn't have been in the
street.
They disappear into the house.
BACK ON PORCH
Craig has a twinkle in his eyes and Roach walks over, pissed.
ROACH
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
DAY-DAY
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
ROACH
I'm not letting nothing go.
They killed
my board.
DAY-DAY
Let it go!
Craig is looking over at the Joker's house.
Baby Joker walks
out the front door.
He walks over to the rider and POPS the
TRUNK.
CRAIG
Wait.
Check'em out.
Baby Joker pulls out a chrome hydraulic pump.
He carries it
towards the house.
Cheeco starts to hump his leg.
BABY JOKER
Get down.
Baby Joker drops the pump, something falls out.
(We can't
see what it is.)
Baby Joker quickly puts it back.
BACK ON PORCH
CRAIG
You see that?
DAY-DAY
I didn't see nothing.
ROACH
Me neither.
CRAIG
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
DAY-DAY
Yeah, air.
CRAIG
Naw.
I bet'cha it's something better
than air.
DAY-DAY
How you know?
It could be anything.
CRAIG
I don't know, and it could be anything.
But I just say we go take a look.
ROACH
I say we go over there and kick their
asses.
I can take the little one.
DAY-DAY
Are you out your mind?
I'm not messing
with them S.A.'s boy.
You must be crazy.
CRAIG
Could be.
Rather be crazy than homeless.
Now all we need is a big pack of baloney.
Day-Day and Roach look at each other.
BOTH
Baloney??
Craig, Day-Day and Roach are sneaking across the street
towards Joker's house.
Craig looks calm.
Day-Day looks
nervous.
Roach eats on a piece of baloney.
DAY-DAY
This ain't gonna work.
I'm going back.
Day-Day tries to turn around.
Craig grabs him.
CRAIG
It's about to work, just come on.
ROACH
(about to bite baloney)
What about the dog?
Craig slaps the baloney out of his hand.
CRAIG
That's what the baloney's for!
All three kneel down next to a parked car.
Day-Day looks
sick.
DAY-DAY
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig.
I got the B-G's.
CRAIG
What's the B-G's?
DAY-DAY
(holding his stomach)
The bubble guts.
I'm so nervous it feels
like I'mma shit on myself.
ROACH
Try an' hold it, man.
Squeeze your ass
cheeks together.
DAY-DAY
Butterflies, my ass.
I'm about to go
home.
Craig grabs Day-Day again.
CRAIG
Look, Day-Day.
If we don't go over there
and take a look, this might be the last
night you got a home.
Now trust me.
Day-Day realizes that Craig is right. He takes a deep breath.
CRAIG (cont'd)
Now all we gotta do is find out where the
little one put that pump.
Take it and
see what's in it.
DAY-DAY
You make it sound so easy.
CRAIG
It is easy. You know why?
'Cause they're
not expecting it.
Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco.
Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a
good look.
ROACH
Dude, dogs hate me.
I don't know why.
Me and K-9's just don't get along.
CRAIG
Well get along with this one.
(pushing Roach)
Go ahead of us.
Don't get seen and don't
let that mutt out of your sight.
ROACH
Fuck, what's his name?
CRAIG
Cheeco.
Roach crawls away on his hands and knees.
Roach sneaks past Joker's lowrider.
He slowly approaches the
fence.
No sign of Cheeco.
Roach opens the pack of baloney
and pulls out a slice.
ROACH
(nervous whisper)
Here, Cheeco.
Chee-co, here boy.
That's
a good boy.
It's pitch-black behind the fence, still no Cheeco.
PARKED CAR - SAME TIME
Craig makes a move.
CRAIG
Come on, he should have'em by now.
Day-Day follows.
DAY-DAY
Hurry up.
He didn't have that much
baloney.
They sneak up to the side of the house.
The MUSIC is
BLEEDING THROUGH the walls.
INSIDE HOUSE
Li'l Joker is dancing with all 3 girls.
They're all getting
high and feeling good.
One girl has come out of her blouse.
The others start to follow her lead.
LI'L JOKER
(yelling towards bedroom)
Hey, homes, you guys better hurry up!
I'mma get greedy.
BACK OUTSIDE
Craig and Day-Day are peeking through the window.
Craig
moves on.
Day-Day is still watching.
DAY-DAY
(to himself)
Look at those tig-ole-bitties
Craig snatches him from the window.
They walk over to the
fence.
CRAIG
You go first.
DAY-DAY
Naw, you go first.
CRAIG
You go first.
DAY-DAY
No.
CRAIG
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence
I'mma throw you over.
DAY-DAY
I ain't scared of you.
We ain't little
no more.
Day-Day gets ready to fight.
CRAIG
What?
Craig jumps like he's going to hit him.
Day-Day jumps back
and almost falls.
DAY-DAY
I hope to God that dog is happy.
CRAIG
Me too.
ROACH
...is having no luck.
Cheeco is nowhere to be found.
Roach
starts to sing.
ROACH
My baloney has a first name.
It's C-h-e-
e-c-o.
We hear a MEAN GROWL out of the darkness.
Roach continues.
ROACH (cont'd)
My baloney has a second name it just like
the first Cheeco.
GROWLING gets LOWDER.
ROACH (cont'd)
Ooooohhhh I love to eat it everyday if
you ask me what I'll say.
We can hear TINY FOOTSTEPS RUNNING at Roach.
ROACH (cont'd)
Cheeco's got to be the dumbest fuckin'
mutt in the whole wide U.S.A.
CHEECO is running at Roach full speed.
He jumps on the fence
and starts to BARK with everything he's got.
Roach drops the
baloney.
CRAIG AND DAY-DAY
...hear the DOG BARKING and freeze in their tracks.
Day-Day
tries to run.
Craig grabs him, again.
CRAIG
Wait.
DAY-DAY
(loud whisper)
Wait for what?
A LOT of BARKING.
Nothing coming.
CRAIG
He's still over by Roach.
ROACH
...picks up the baloney and stuffs the whole pack into his
mouth.
CHEECO is SILENCED.
Roach is relieved.
INSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
The chrome pump is open and filled with money.
Baby Joker's
pulling out the money while Joker sits on the bed counting
it.
They stop when they hear CHEECO BARKING.
BABY JOKER
Want me to take a look?
JOKER
No, keep working.
In the mirror behind Joker, we see a stick slide through the
curtain.
The curtain cracks just enough to see Craig's eye
looking in.
Just then, Li'l Joker bursts through the door with his shirt
off and two half-naked girls on his arms.
LI'L JOKER
Yo, man fuck that shit.
Do it later.
It's Friday, time to party, SA.
JOKER
Close the door.
LI'L JOKER
Not until you come party with us, man.
Baby Joker looks at the girls, then at Joker.
JOKER
Alright, put it in that drawer.
Joker hands Baby Joker the money.
He puts it away.
They
start to exit the room.
OUTSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS
Craig is still looking.
Day-Day is scared shitless.
He's
looking for Cheeco.
DAY-DAY
(whispering)
What you see?
CRAIG
That pump was full of money.
I saw where
they put it.
Stay right here, I'mma
climb in and go get it.
DAY-DAY
Wait here?
So Cheeco can bite my ass
off?
Tell me where it is I'll do it.
CRAIG
No, man, just wait.
Craig climbs in the window.
Day-Day holds his stomach.
DAY-DAY
I got the B-G's.
ROACH
... his meat supply is almost gone.
He tries to think fast.
Cheeco starts to look for more meat.
Roach grabs the smashed
brownie out of his pocket and throws it to Cheeco.
He
swallows it in one big gulp.
He's looking for more.
There
is no more.
Roach smiles.
CHEECO GROWLS.
ROACH
Good boy.
Nice dog.
CHEECO'S STILL GROWLING.
Suddenly Cheeco falls back on his
butt and lets out a slight moan.
CHEECO'S POV
Cheeco is looking up at Roach.
He's seeing double, even
triple.
Cheeco lays down.
It looks like he's faded.
ROACH
No lungs, baby.
No lungs.
INSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Craig is in.
The bedroom door is cracked.
Craig walks over
and shuts the door gently.
He locks it.
Then he creeps over
to the dresser.
He pulls out the pump and sets it on the
bed.
He opens it, revealing all the bundled-up money packed
in.
He starts to stuff it in his pockets.
OUTSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS
Day-Day is trying to keep his composure.
Day-Day and Roach are at Joker's front door.
DAY-DAY
You wanna knock?
ROACH
Go for it.
Day-Day knocks real soft.
Too soft.
ROACH (cont'd)
No one's gonna hear that.
The music's
playing.
DAY-DAY
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto
knock.
ROACH
This is a knock.
Roach starts to kick on the door with his foot.
It's very
loud.
Mr. Jones' dog truck pulls to a stop.
He gets out and runs
to the house.
He KNOCKS.
Uncle Elroy answers.
Suga is
looking over his shoulder.
MR. JONES
I got your message.
Where's Craig?
UNCLE ELROY
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn
message!
MR. JONES
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a
urgent message?
UNCLE ELROY
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics
must be sucking on yo' brain!
MR. JONES
Somebody left me a message.
Well where's
Craig and Day-Day?
UNCLE ELROY
I don't know.
Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym
if she seen them.
Craig is about to climb out the window.
KARLA
Next time, page me first.
CRAIG
Okay.
Craig climbs out the window.
He loses his footing and free
falls into some bushes.
KARLA
You alright?
CRAIG
Yeah, I'm cool.
See you later.
He runs past a sleeping Cheeco and hops the fence.
Free at
last.
He's about to run back across the street when he sees
the dog truck.
CRAIG (cont'd)
What is he doing here?
Craig ducks back.
The front door swings open.
It's Uncle Elroy.
UNCLE ELROY
Craig, where the hell you been?
Mr. Jones pops up.
So does Suga and Miss Ho Kym.
MR. JONES
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.
Craig,
what the hell wrong with you?
Where you
been?
CRAIG
Have you seen Day-Day?
UNCLE ELROY
No.
Thought he was with you.
CRAIG
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
He steps in the house and closes the door behind him.
Karla backs up the rider and she's out.
The Joker house
looks quiet.
Then the door opens and three Girls walk out.
LI'L JOKER
Sorry you gotta walk, but I'll call you
tomorrow.
The Girls take off down the street.
The porch lights go out.
Uncle Elroy catches up with Craig and Mr. Jones on the side
of Joker's house.
He has a big chrome .357 magnum.
CRAIG
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
UNCLE ELROY
Thank you.
I only got two bullets in the
mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
MR. JONES
Two bullets?
Yo' ass ain't changed.
Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
CRAIG
Come on.
They sneak over to the fence.
UNCLE ELROY
What about that ugly dog?
MR. JONES
I got my mase.
CRAIG
He's on the other side, sleep.
They start to hop the fence.
ON CHEECO
...starts to awake.
He tries to stand up and stumbles back
on his face.
He lets out ANOTHER MOAN.
ON CRAIG AND UNCLE ELROY
Craig is over the fence.
Mr. Jones is over
But Uncle Elroy
is having a little trouble.
CRAIG (cont'd)
Need some help?
MR. JONES
Need to lose some weight.
UNCLE ELROY
Shut yo' ass up.
Uncle Elroy falls off the fence.
UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
Damn.
Craig & Mr. Jones helps him up.
They creep over to the
window - the shades are pulled down.
CRAIG
I'm not sure, but I think they're in this
room.
Baby Joker walks out the back door.
He stops in the middle
of the yard.
BABY JOKER
Cheeco!
Cheeco!
Here, boy!
No Cheeco.
He continues to a shed in the back yard.
He goes
inside and picks up a chainsaw.
On his way out the shed,
he's slapped in the face with a "Big Ass Stick."
Mr. Jones
is working the handle.
Baby Joker is out cold.
Mr. Jones stands over him.
MR. JONES
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
CRAIG
Yeah, pops!
UNCLE ELROY
Damn, big bro.
You swung that like Sammy
Sosa.
MR. JONES
The skills are still intact.
Now tie his
ass up, Elroy.
He does.
Li'l Joker stands at the back door.
LI'L JOKER
Junior?!
Junior?!
No answer.
Suddenly he spots something over by the shed.
It's Baby Joker all ties up.
LI'L JOKER (cont'd)
What the...
He runs to the rescue.
But right before he gets to him,
Uncle Elroy jumps out the bushes and takes him.
"Ronnie Lott
Style."
Mr. Jones steps in with the stick.
Craig steps in
with the rope, and it's over.
Uncle Elroy's hurt.
It's his
back.
UNCLE ELROY
(in pain)
My back.
MR. JONES
What's the matter?
UNCLE ELROY
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
Craig goes to assist Uncle Elroy.
CRAIG
Stretch it out.
UNCLE ELROY
Don't move me.
The back door flies open.
Joker appears with the AK-47 in
hand.
He spots Uncle Elroy in the middle of the yard bent
over.
He lifts the AK.
JOKER
What you doing here?
UNCLE ELROY
I lost something, nigga.
What it look
like?
JOKER
Looks like a dead man.
Out of nowhere, Craig hits Joker from the back.
He flies one
way and the gun flies another.
Now it's really on!
Hand-to-
hand combat.
Craig vs. Joker.
Right vs. wrong.
Good vs.
evil.
You know how it go.
MR. JONES
Go to the body, Craig!
Go to the body!
Fight's still on.
Craig is giving Joker the ass-whipping he
deserves when Uncle Elroy, Day-Day and Roach reach the back
porch.
DAY-DAY
Get 'em, Craig!
ROACH
Bite his ear!
UNCLE ELROY
What 'em!
Watch 'em!
Joker takes a few more shots from Craig, then grabs Craig
around the waist and slams him to the ground.
Craig is hurt.
UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
Get off yo' back, Craig!
Craig struggles with Joker, who now has the devil in his
eyes.
CRAIG
Ya'll mothafuckas help me!
Day-Day and Roach look at each other.
They rush to Craig's
aide.
Joker spots them coming, he also spots the AK.
In SLOW MOTION, Day-Day and Roach dive on Joker...at the same
time Joker dives for the AK.
Day-Day and Roach land on top
of Craig and our trio try to hurry to their feet.
But as
soon as they get up, they're looking down the barrel of an AK-
47.
JOKER
(smiling)
Say hello to my little friend.
BOOM!
Debo hits Joker from the back.
Joker is out cold.
DEBO
No way, Jose.
This one is mine.
Ezal picks up the gun and hands it to Debo.
DEBO (cont'd)
Hi, Craig, remember me?
Craig knows he can't fight a gun.
Everybody is helpless.
We
can hear SIRENS getting CLOSER and CLOSER.
Suddenly, out of
nowhere...
CHEECO!
The pitbull is back!
And he's mad as hell.
He runs through
everybody and jumps on Debo, knocking the gun from his hand.
Craig and Day-Day jump on Debo.
Roach WHISTLES, and Cheeco
stops his attack on Debo.
Cheeco runs over to Roach and jumps in his arms.
Roach's
being licked to death by the pitbull.
DAY-DAY
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
ROACH
He's a boy, dude.
Out front, three sheriff cars swoop into the driveway.
The
cops jump out, guns drawn.
Debo and Ezal are tied up next to the Jokers.
EZAL
Mr. Jones, we was just playin'.
He made
me do it.
Mr. Jones don't wanna hear it.
Craig runs into the house.
Uncle, Day-Day, Roach and Cheeco look at the five on the
ground...it's over, or is it?
SHERIFF #3
Freeze, Sheriff's Department!
The SHERIFFS are on our heroes, guns drawn.
UNCLE ELROY
Wait a minute!
I live across the street!
SHERIFF LADY
You do?
UNCLE ELROY
Yeah.
Paid cash.
DAY-DAY
They the ones you want.
Red and Blue lights flash through the neighborhood.
Everyone
is out their door looking at the action.
The suburbs is
starting to look like the ghetto for real.
Uncle Elroy is bent over.
UNCLE ELROY
When my back gets better I'mma beat the
black off you, Day-Day.
DAY-DAY
I know.
I'm sorry.
UNCLE ELROY
Sorry, my ass.
Suga and Miss Ho Kym come running.
SUGA
Elroy, what happen?
UNCLE ELROY
I threw my back, again.
SUGA
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
UNCLE ELROY
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
SUGA
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
UNCLE ELROY
For what?
We ain't gonna have no house
after the auction tomorrow!
Everyone is sad.
ROACH
Don't worry, bro, you, Suga, Day-Day and
Craig can live with me and my parents.
'Til you get back on yo' feet.
UNCLE ELROY
Thanks, Roach, but I can't accept that.
We're moving back to Watts where it's
safe.
DAY-DAY
Where's Craig?
UNCLE ELROY
I don't know.
MR. JONES
That boy just don't never learn.
Craig steps out of Joker's front door carrying the chrome
hydraulic pump.
CRAIG
I love Fridays.
He walks past the cops and crosses the street.
ROACH
There he go.
MR. JONES
What the hell is he carrying?
DAY-DAY
Property taxes, and a new candy-apple
paint job.
They greet Craig and all start to walk towards the house.
As we PULL BACK, all is well inside and outside Uncle Elroy's
house.
The suburbs are back to normal.
They get in the car.
Craig looks over at the Joker's house.
ANGLE ON JOKER'S HOUSE
Karla pulls up in the low-rider.
They lock eyes and she
blows him a kiss.
He gives her a wink.
They pull off.
She
goes in the house.
CRAIG (V.O.)
Well, all's well that ends well.
Another
Friday gone.
Another problem solved.
It's a trip to know that things can get
crazy in the suburbs, too.
I can't wait
to get back home...to the peace and quiet
streets of South Central.
D'Wana's car pulls INTO FRAME.
She stops in front of Uncle
Elroy's house.
Baby'D jumps out with a brick.
She throws it
through the back window of Day-Day's BMW.
She jumps back in
and they're gone...
THE END.
Next Friday
