ESTABLISHING SHOTS of Dave's beautiful colonial home. Huge
oak trees shade the lush front lawn. New Audi and BMW station
wagons sit in the driveway. We hear WATER SPLASHING...
They stumble down the dark Hollywood street together...
DAVE
Don't get me wrong, I love my kids,
I do, I would take a bullet for
them, but...remember that heroin
addict you dated?
MITCH
Tara? Or Rena? Or Rachel?
DAVE
Jesus, how many heroin addicts have
you dated?
MITCH
It's a national scourge, dude.
DAVE
Anyway. Having kids is like dating
a heroin addict, only instead of
dating them, they move into your
house for 18 years. They're
laughing one second and crying the
next and then they're trying to
kill themselves in your bathroom
for no reason. They're mean and
selfish and they burn through all
your money and they steal your shit
and they break everything and they
stay up all night and they listen
to really shitty music and the
dirty secret is, no one actually
likes kids.
MITCH
Oh come on, you don't mean that--
21.
DAVE
No! It's true. Everyone pretends to
like kids because if you don't you
look like a huge dick. It's like
Drew Barrymore or jazz. No one
actually likes them, but if you say
that out loud, everybody hates you.
MITCH
Dude, I love Drew Barrymore -- have
you seen Boys on the Side?
They weave across a LARGE PLAZA, stumbling for Mitch's car.
DAVE
I'm just saying: don't fuck up your
life like I did, okay?
MITCH
What are you talking about? You've
got it all! You've got a huge house
full of food and furniture -- shit,
your TV is bigger than my car! You
have a great job, you make a shit-
ton of money, and people respect
you, man! My last job involved an
ape costume -- do you know what
that does to a man?
Dave waves him off, not really hearing him. But Mitch is
sincere, heartfelt:
MITCH (CONT'D)
Plus you've got a hot, extremely
fuckable wife who cooks and cleans
and takes care of all your needs!
It's like having a really hot mom
who you can also have sex with!
DAVE
Wait, what--?
MITCH
Also you're never lonely, you
always have someone to talk to
about your day, plus you get to do
all the fun gay couple stuff like
go to wine country! You think
single guys can go to wine
country?! No way! They won't even
let us in! You're living the dream,
dude! What more do you want?!
22.
DAVE
Tatiana! I want Tatiana! I want sex
with strange new women and maybe
also with Sabrina if she's single
and I want to wake up at noon and
smoke weed all afternoon and I want
to not think about the needs of
four other people 24 hours a day
and I want to start reading a novel
and actually finish it and I want
to take a solid shit because I'm
not constantly stressed out and I
want to learn how to rollerblade
and also I really want to pee...
MITCH
Yeah, me too...
They look around the plaza, and their eyes land on the HUGE
FOUNTAIN in the middle; a GREEK GODDESS sits atop it.
MITCH (CONT'D)
Fountain?
DAVE
Bingo.
They stumble over to the fountain, unzip their pants, and,
leaning on each other, begin peeing into it. Mitch glances up
at the GREEK GODDESS METIS. She scowls down at them.
MITCH
This chick does not look happy.
DAVE
Maybe she has three kids and a job
she hates.
MITCH
Dude, enough already.
DAVE
I'm just saying...I envy your life.
MITCH
And that's what's so fucked,
because I envy yours.
DAVE
Yeah you don't--
MITCH
I do!
23.
DAVE
No, I do--!
MITCH DAVE
I wish I had your life! I wish I had your life!
They're about to say "jinx" when--
BOOM!
A thunder clap CRASHES and
ALL OVER LOS ANGELES
the electrical grid starts shutting down, neighborhood by
neighborhood! Soon the entire city is PITCH BLACK...
BACK IN THE DARKENED PLAZA
Dave and Mitch freeze, terrified, hugging. . .and peeing...
MITCH
Ummmmm...?
Then all the lights in the city flicker back to life...
DAVE
R-Rolling blackout?
MITCH
I guess...?
They continue peeing, a little freaked out.
DAVE
You really have nice flow by the
way. Very thick and confident.
MITCH
Thank you. Yours is very steamy.
DAVE
Thank you. My urologist says I run
a little warm.
Eventually they both finish, tuck in, and zip up. Beat.
DAVE (CONT'D)
You good to drive?
MITCH
Now I am.
24.
As they stumble off towards Mitch's Fiero, HOLD ON the statue
of Metis, the shape-shifting Greek Goddess of Wisdom...
It almost looks like she's smiling...
DISSOLVE TO:
Unable to find a parking spot, Mitch and Dave double-park on
Hollywood Boulevard, hop out, and sprint for the plaza...
MITCH
What are we gonna do when we get to
the fountain?!
29.
DAVE
We're gonna hug each other and pee
into the fountain and wish our
lives back!
MITCH
That might sound really gay!
Both men race around the corner onto the plaza and stop cold:
THE FOUNTAIN IS GONE
A DEPARTMENT OF PARKS CREW is cleaning up the site where it
once sat. Mitch and Dave are blown away.
DAVE
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!
They hurry up to the crew FOREMAN.
MITCH
Excuse me! Where is the fountain?!
FOREMAN
It's getting restored.
DAVE
Where did you take it?!
FOREMAN
I don't know, chief, I'm not the
fountain spokesman, I'm just the
guy that fills the fucking hole.
DAVE
Who could tell us where it is?!
FOREMAN
Maybe the district manager?
CUT TO:
A DESK PLACARD READING "DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON"
District Manager CARLA NELSON sits behind her desk in her
bland office, her face the model of bureaucratic ennui.
DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON
It's not in the computer.
Opposite her, Dave and Mitch pull their hair out, insane.
30.
MITCH
Well of course it's not--!
DAVE
When will it be in the computer?!
DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON
You could try calling tomorrow.
DAVE
Tomorrow?! We can't wait until
tomorrow, Carla!
MITCH
How can you lose a fountain?.
DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON
(beat, deadpan)
It's not in the computer.
Mitch LUNGES for Carla, but Dave grabs him and wrestles him
out of the office.
MITCH
YOU ARE EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG
WITH THE WORLD--!
DAVE
We'll call you tomorrow! Thank you!
Dave and Mitch exit the Department of Parks building and pace
on the sunny sidewalk, their hands on their heads, stunned.
MITCH
This is so fucked...
DAVE
We should just go home and lock the
DOORS AND--
Mitch's phone rings in Dave's pocket. Dave hesitates, then
answers it, fruitlessly trying to sound like Mitch:
DAVE (CONT'D)
This is fucking Mitch?
MITCH
I don't talk like that, dude--
DAVE
Okay ...Okay...Great...Thank you.
31.
Dave clicks off.
MITCH
Who was that?
DAVE
Marty Green, the producer of Busted
Dreams 4. Apparently the guy they
cast for Steve Action OD'd last
night, and the back-up actor got
deported, so, alphabetically,
you're the next actor on the list.
You got the part, man.
Mitch covers his mouth like he just won American Idol.
MITCH
Oh my God! Oh my God! Dreams really
do come true--!
(REALIZING)
Wait, no, this sucks! I'm stuck in
your fat dad-body! I can't play
Steve Action looking like this!
DAVE
(remembering, stunned)
Oh my God: and I've got my closing
today.
MITCH
What, is that like a big deal?
DAVE
A big--?! Yeah! Whether or not I
make partner is riding on this!
MITCH
So what the hell are we gonna do?
PANICKED SILENCE. Then Mitch looks at Dave...
DAVE
No. No. We can't just be each other
for a day, Mitch! You have no idea
how to be a lawyer!
MITCH
Dude, I'm an actor, a human
chameleon, I can do lawyer in my
fucking sleep! It's you I'm worried
about: you can't act for shit!
32.
DAVE
First of all, it's Busted Dreams 4,
okay? It's not The Reader. Second
of all, I'm a WASP, I've spent my
entire life acting happy and no one
has ever questioned my performance,
okay?!
They look at each other, cooling off a bit...
DAVE (CONT'D)
Are...Are we actually considering
doing this...?
MITCH
I mean, we have to...right?
Both men look highly anxious. Dave glances at the time.
DAVE
All right, well, my meeting starts
in 45 minutes. You need to race
home, get dressed, then go to my
office and find my secretary Gladys-
MITCH
She sounds hot, is she hot?
DAVE
No. Get the merger docs from Gladys
and take them to the conference
room. All the partners will be
there so do not speak to anyone.
MITCH
Really? Because I can vamp--
DAVE
NO! No vamping! And once the
meeting starts, you will continue
to say nothing. When a partner asks
you for the merger documents, you
will silently hand them over, okay?
MITCH
Dude, I get it. Play it big, but
maintain my reality--
33.
DAVE
No! Play it small. Really small.
I've spent the last nine months
banging out the terms of this deal,
all you have to do is hand over the
documents. That's it.
MITCH
Dude, that's easy as fuck. Okay,
for me, go home, put on some cool
clothes, and get to set -- all the
info is on my phone. Once you're
there, go to Hair & Makeup and
memorize your lines and try not to
be a total douche to everyone,
okay? This is the film industry.
Everyone is really cool.
They look at each other, very doubtful that this will work...
MITCH (CONT'D)
I'm trusting you, dude...
DAVE
I'm trusting you, too...
MITCH
Power hug.
They hug tight then release.
DAVE
Oh hey, you also need to pick up
Cara from ballet at 4, okay?
MITCH
(heads for the car)
I'm so fucking all over that shit.
Off of Dave's deeply unsettled look, we
CUT TO:
Dave nervously pulls up to a RANCH HOUSE in the Fiero,
reading the address off his iPhone. Several crew trucks are
parked out front, and PA's with headsets loiter about.
Dave gets out wearing an ironed buttondown shirt tucked into
khakis. He self-consciously untucks half his shirt, trying to
look "cooler," as he approaches a nearby P.A.
DAVE
Yo, Mitch Planko is here. Where the
fuck is Hair & Makeup?
P.A.
(POINTING)
Um, trailer 3.. ?
DAVE
That's so real.
Dave stiffly walks off as the P.A. eyes him, weirded out.
Dave and Mitch head up Dave's front walk, solemn...
MITCH
What are you gonna tell Jamie?
DAVE
The truth.
MITCH
Can I highly recommend against
that?
Dave parks Mitch's Fiero on this shady Silver Lake street,
glancing at the HOMELESS GUY stumbling by, a bit scared.
Wearing fingerless driving gloves, Mitch races the twins to
day care. He looks like the fucking Transporter...
Exotic sells the most pimped-out used cars in LA. Mitch
SQUEALS off the lot in a RED FERRARI and cruises down the
Sunset Strip, music BLASTING. Dave sits shotgun, stunned.
DAVE
I can't believe you just charged a
Ferrari to my Discover Card.
MITCH
You need to learn to be
spontaneous, Dave. Chicks like
spontaneous.
(to WOMEN walking by)
Hey ladies! Show us your tits!
They flip him off. Mitch laughs. Dave is still floored:
DAVE
What are we gonna tell Jamie...?
82.
MITCH
Do me a favor, Dave. Relax your
butt hole.
DAVE
What?
MITCH
Your sphincter. Just... release it.
Dave's entire body visibly relaxes a bit.
MITCH (CONT'D)
You didn't even know it was
puckered, right? Now recline your
seat a bit...
(DAVE RECLINES)
Good. Now take some deep breaths.
(Dave does, calming)
Now give me your sunglasses.
Dave gives him his sunglasses; Mitch chucks them out the
window and hands him his cool Ray Ban's.
MITCH (CONT'D)
Now, just for like three minutes,
don't be a dad, don't be a husband,
don't be a lawyer, just be a dude
rolling down Sunset strip in a
fucking Ferrari with his best
friend listening to Seal, okay?
Dave looks out the window, getting into it...
MITCH (CONT'D)
Feels good, right?
After a moment, a TEAR escapes from under Dave's shades.
MITCH (CONT'D)
It's okay, just let it out.
DAVE
It's been so long since I felt
cool...
MITCH
I know, baby. I know.
They cruise for a bit longer, then Mitch pulls into a CAR
WASH. Dave looks confused.
83.
DAVE
Why are we washing the car? It's
brand new.
MITCH
We're not washing the car, David.
We're getting you mentally,
physically, and spiritually ready
for your date. Come on.
Dave and Sabrina exit the restaurant. It's a warm night.
DAVE
Well, I had a great time...
SABRINA
Oh -- are we done? It's only 2.
DAVE
Right! No! What are we, lame
married people? Let's go to a
rave...or something? Do people...
still do that? Raving?
SABRINA
My friend is spinning afterhours at
Foxtail, if you want...?
DAVE
(CONFUSED)
Spinning? Is that with the bikes?
Sabrina laughs and takes his arm.
SABRINA
You're so funny! Come on!
A line of HIPSTERS wait outside Foxtail. Holding Dave's hand,
Sabrina cuts the line, kisses the BOUNCER on the cheek, and
he lets them inside. Dave nods, awesome...
Dave walks Sabrina home along her quaint, tree-lined street.
DAVE
Now that was a first date...
SABRINA
For a guy with a poker table in his
living room, Kiefer Sutherland is
surprisingly bad at poker.
DAVE
I know. I'm not even sure he
understood the rules...
She laughs. Then they stop in front of her apartment. Beat.
SABRINA
It's so weird, I feel like I've
known you for longer than just one
night...
DAVE
Yeah. Me too...
There's a lull for a kiss. Dave hesitates...so Sabrina moves
in and kisses him. It's sweet but passionate... When it's
over, Dave can barely speak:
DAVE (CONT'D)
Can...Can, um, can I call you
sometime? Do people still say that?
SABRINA
Yes -- and you'd better.
DAVE
Okay. Well. Good night, Sabrina.
SABRINA
Good night, Mitch.
92.
She gives him a thoughtful smile then disappears inside. Dave
waits a second, then does a victorious karate chop, YES!
DISSOLVE TO:
A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY MORNING
Light floods into Mitch's apartment. Dave wakes up and looks
at the clock: 9:02.
DAVE
Fuck that.
He rolls over and goes back to sleep, a smile on his face...
Dave sits at an outdoor table, reading a novel and taking his
time with brunch. He sees a BUSINESSMAN wolfing down his food
and running off to his car, yelling into his cell phone,
stressed out of his mind. Dave smiles and keeps reading...
Dave, in a Dodgers jersey, tees off on baseballs in a batting
cage. CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! It feels great...
Dave, holding a cross-bow and wearing a loincloth, has fake
sex with his CO-STAR on a jungle set; their mid-sections are
conveniently obscured by a giant fern.
Dave is selling it, and when Valtan calls cut, the whole CREW
applauds, wildly impressed. Dave waves them off, bashful...
DISSOLVE TO:
A line of limousines roll up to Dave's building and dozens of
stone-faced EXECUTIVES from both companies file out...
Ted Norton and all his execs hurry out of the building,
briefcases in hand, looking ashen. They head for their long
line of idling limos. Ted hisses to Flemming:
CEO TED NORTON
I can't believe we just walked away
from 725 million dollars.
FLEMMING STEEL III
For the record, I did not support
THAT DECISION--:
VOICE BEHIND THEM
Mr. Norton?! Sir?!
They turn to see the mediator jogging out of the building.
ERIN WALSH
Sir, Mr. Kinkabe has agreed to the
825 million. The deal is closed.
98.
A shocked CHEER rises up from the execs! Hugs and handshakes
all around! Ted pumps Mitch's hand, ecstatic.
CEO TED NORTON
Helluva job! I owe you my life!
MITCH
Fuck it. Helping ridiculously rich
people become even more
ridiculously rich is why I go to
work every day.
CEO TED NORTON
Well, you are bar none the best
attorney I've ever worked with!
MITCH
I am?! Fuck, I've never really been
good at anything before...
Mitch considers this a second, then laughs, proud.
MITCH (CONT'D)
Gimme me a hug you tiny capitalist!
Mitch hugs Ted and lifts him off the ground, spinning him.
MITCH (CONT'D)
I love you so much...
CUT TO:
A perfect, sunny day game at Dodgers stadium. Dave and
Sabrina take their seats behind home plate.
DAVE
(AMAZED)
These are your grandfather's seats?
SABRINA
Yeah, my family's been coming to
Dodger games since they moved here
from Brooklyn in '58.
Dave looks at her, his amazement only growing...
DAVE
Really? Who's your favorite Dodger?
SABRINA
Fernando, obviously.
99.
Blown away, Dave unzips his jacket to reveal a throwback
number 34 Fernando Valenzuela jersey. She laughs.
SABRINA (CONT'D)
No way!
DAVE
It's too soon to say I love you,
right? That's against the rules?
she laughs and kisses him.
SABRINA
You're cute.
Smiling, Dave looks out at the perfect ball field, his arm
around Sabrina-he looks profoundly... existentially.. .happy.
And then his iPhone RINGS. He answers it:
DAVE
Mitch Planko who the fuck is this.
INTERCUT WITH: DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON
sitting at her desk, talking on the phone and doing WHIPPETS
off a can of Reddi-Wip; twenty empty cans litter her desk.
DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON
This is Carla Nelson from the Los
Angeles Department of Parks.
DAVE
Oh my God, hi!
Dave steps away to take the call. Carla does another whippet.
DAVE (CONT'D)
What's.. .going on?
DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON
We found that fountain. It's in our
San Pedro warehouse.
Dave glances back at Sabrina... and winces, conflicted:
DAVE
And... and how long is it going to
be there?
DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON
It ships out tonight for repairs.
100.
DAVE
And after that?
DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON
(doing another whippet)
No fucking clue, dude.
Dave gets a CALL WAITING BEEP.
DAVE
Right. Okay, well thanks, Carla.
(clicking over to other line)
Hello?
INTERCUT WITH: MITCH
He's walking down the hall of his law firm, on the phone, as
all of his peers step from their offices, APPLAUDING his
victory, slapping him on the back, shaking his hand.
MITCH
You hear about the fountain?
DAVE
Yeah... We should probably switch
back, huh?
Mitch high-fives a co-worker.
MITCH
Sure. Right. I mean... the funny
thing is...I was just starting to
enjoy your life a little bit...
DAVE
Yeah, and I was just starting to
enjoy yours, too...
MITCH
Really?
DAVE
Really.
MITCH
So.. .maybe we should keep going--?
DAVE
I'm so glad you said that.
MITCH
I'm so glad I said that too! Your
life rocks!
(MORE)
101.
MITCH (CONT'D)
I just closed the Amalgamated deal
for 825 million dollars and for the
first time ever, people actually
respect me! It's so weird! Word is
they're going to make me partner
tonight! I love your life, dude!
DAVE
And I love yours! All the free time
and the fun activities and I'm
really growing as an actor and I
think Sabrina might actually have
intercourse with me tonight!
MITCH
Dude, you sent her flowers -- she's
gonna fuck you like a crack whore
on rent day.
DAVE
So, wait, what are we talking about
here? Staying like this... forever:
MITCH
No! Course not.
DAVE
Right! That's crazy...
Beat.
MITCH
Is it though...?
Mitch bumps fists with smiling co-workers...
Dave watches Sabrina CHEER after a base hit...
DAVE
It's so strange, when the change-up
happened, we were so focussed on
switching back into our bodies that
we didn't even consider that this
might be exactly what we both
needed...
MITCH
Yeah, we're fucking morons.
DAVE
All right, well, see ya, Dave...
MITCH
Take it easy, Mitch...
102.
They both hang up, surprised smiles on their faces...
SMASH CUT TO:
A DEAFENING THUNDER-CLAP
RAIN blankets Los Angeles that night. It's an epic storm...
Fastening his belt, Mitch sprints out of the restaurant,
desperate -- but Jamie is already SQUEALING away in her car.
MITCH
FUCK! Fuck...
He stands in the rain, overcome with self-loathing...
CUT TO:
As the rain tapers off, Jamie rockets through LA, running red
lights, skidding through turns, splashing through puddles!
Jamie and Dave squeal up to their house to see Mitch, out
front, sadly trying to pack a Barcalounger into his Ferrari.
DAVE
Mitch! Get in!
MITCH
Dave?
DAVE
Get in!
MITCH
(squinting inside car)
Is that Jamie?
JAMIE
Get in the fucking car, dipshit!
Mitch, terrified, sprints to the car and hops in.
The Port of Los Angeles never sleeps. Huge diesel cranes load
and unload freighters as tractor trailers THUNDER to and fro.
The street is lined with WAREHOUSES. Beat. Then Jamie skids
around the corner, Tokyo Drift-style, in her station wagon!
DAVE (O.S.)
There it is!
Jamie screeches up to a warehouse labelled L.A. DEPARTMENT OF
PARKS; she, Mitch and Dave pile out of the car and run into
THE IMMENSE WAREHOUSE
where they sprint down the towering aisles, past park signs,
swingsets, jungle gyms -- and finally, fountains.
DAVE (CONT'D)
There!
Four WORKMEN pack the FOUNTAIN OF METIS into a large wooden
crate for transport. Jamie, Mitch and Dave run over to them.
MITCH
Wait! Stop!
The workmen stop packing the fountain, confused.
DAVE
We...We need that fountain.
116.
WORKMAN #1
You.. .need this fountain?
MITCH
Yes. We have to pee in it.
DAVE
It's a magic fountain.
The workmen just look at them, deadpan. Then Dave reaches
into his wallet and starts pulling out CASH--
SMASH CUT TO:
MITCH AND DAVE STANDING SIDE BY SIDE AT THE FOUNTAIN
with their pants down around their ankles. Dave starts
PEEING. Mitch doesn't. Dave hisses at him:
DAVE
Come on, open the floodgates!
MITCH
I can't pee with them watching!
PAN OVER to the workmen, standing nearby, looking at Mitch
and Dave like they're total freaks.
DAVE
Well I can't keep going forever!
Mitch tilts his head back and quietly sings to himself:
MITCH
The sun is shining all the time,
Looks like another perfect day, I
love L.A. We love it! I love L.A...
DAVE
Are you singing Randy Newman--?
Then we hear a second stream of PEE hit the fountain.
MITCH
Oh thank god.
DAVE
Okay, quick, we have to hug!
MITCH
(glancing back at workmen)
Do we, though?
117.
DAVE
Yes, we have to do everything
exactly the same! Come on!
As they scootch together and put their arms around each
other, Mitch calls over to the workmen:
MITCH
Just so you know, this isn't gay!
Our penises aren't even touching--!
DAVE
Come on: "I wish I had my old life
back" on three! One, two:
MITCH DAVE
I wish I had my old life I wish I had my old life
back! back!
JUST THEN A THUNDER CLAP CRASHES OUTSIDE
The lights in the warehouse flicker. Dave and Mitch finish
peeing and slowly zip up, exchanging a worried look...
DAVE
You think it worked?
MITCH
How the fuck should I know?
(waving to workmen)
Thank you! Have a pleasant evening!
CUT TO:
PEACEFUL BLACK STILLNESS
Then we hear a baby SCREAM BLOODY MURDER. Then we hear a
second baby join in, even more shrill than the first.
Finally, we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear:
JAMIE (O.S.)
Your turn.
FOLLOWED BY:
DAVE (O.S.)
YES!
Dave turns on the light, rushes over to the mirror, and
touches his face, overjoyed, clearly back in the right body.
118.
DAVE (CONT'D)
Oh thank God. Thank God. Pumpkin,
it worked! I'm back!
JAMIE
(groggy, half-asleep)
Great, go feed the fucking babies.
She rolls over and goes back to sleep. He grins and runs out.
The sun sets over LA. The MUSIC in the air and the cars
lining the street tell us that Dave is hosting a party...
A "CONGRATS ON GETTING A JOB, MITCH!" banner hangs from the
swingset. Kids race about as adults drink, eat, and mingle.
Dave, in jeans and a tee shirt, works the barbecue and talks
to Mitch, in a jacket and tie, as he adjusts his crotch:
MITCH
I still can't get used to the whole
underwear thing. It's such a
SUPERFLUOUS LAYER--
Just then CARA runs up and hugs her Dad.
CARA
Hi Daddy!
DAVE
Sugar-bug!
MITCH
How's my favorite ballerina?!
120.
Cara turns, takes Mitch's hand, and flips him onto his back.
CARA
I'm not a ballerina anymore, bitch.
She races off. Mitch painfully pulls himself to his feet.
MITCH
Jesus fucking Christ...
Dave sees SABRINA, looking angelic in a sundress, chatting
with a circle of GUESTS on the patio.
DAVE
So. How's it going with Sabrina?
MITCH
Great. We just celebrated our two
week anniversary.
DAVE
Wow. Good for you.
Mitch nods, proud, I know. Swigs his beer.
MITCH
You think she's fucking Fernando
Valenzuela?
We see that the man she's talking to is, in fact, Dodger
great FERNANDO VALENZUELA, in a pimped-out white suit.
DAVE
Maybe.
MITCH
I'm oddly okay with it.
DAVE
I can't believe they're family
friends.
MITCH
I know. She really is perfect--
Just then TATIANA and KIEFER SUTHERLAND approach, wheeling
her newborn DAUGHTER in a pram.
KIEFER SUTHERLAND
I gotta go feed her baby, but
congrats on your new gig, bro.
121.
MITCH
Thanks, Kiefer. See you guys.
Mitch kisses Tatiana on the cheek and they head off.
MITCH (CONT'D)
It's creepy that Kiefer Sutherland
is like way into other people's
babies, right?
DAVE
Oh yeah.
Dave flips the burgers.
MITCH
Thanks again for hooking me up with
the job at Amalgamated, man.
DAVE
Hey, the CEO owed me a favor...
MITCH
I think I'm really going to crush
it in corporate America.
DAVE
I think so too.
Just then, MITCH'S DAD approaches.
MITCH, SR.
I'm heading out. Thanks for having
me.
Mitch, Sr. pulls his son into an emotional hug.
MITCH, SR. (CONT'D)
I love you, Mitch.
MITCH
I love you too, Dad.
They break apart. Mitch, Sr. heads off. Then he stops. Turns.
MITCH, SR.
Hey Mitch...
Mitch turns.
MITCH, SR. (CONT'D)
I'm real proud of you.
122.
