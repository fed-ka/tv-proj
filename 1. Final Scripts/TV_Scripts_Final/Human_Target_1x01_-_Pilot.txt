                                          TEASER

  OVER BLACK:

  A man s voice.  Nervous.  Raspy.  A little out of breath...

                              RASPY VOICE (V.O.)
                Blending in...  You have no idea what 
                it s like, always blending in...  You 
                forget who you are.  Eventually, you   
                start to forget who you ever were...

  ...then, BLINDING LIGHT, and we re in--

  INT. DINGY OFFICE BULLPEN - DAY

  A large office bullpen, awash in stark daylight.  But there s 
  nobody here.  The desks are all empty.  The place is dead--

                              RASPY VOICE (O.S.)
                They push you and push you further into 
                the margins. Treat you like dirt, take 
                away your manhood. Make you small...

  --except for the DOZENS OF EMPLOYEES face down on the ground, 
  some crying, all panicked.  We re in a hostage situation...

                              RASPY VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                Somebody had to do something about it.

  One hostage is separated from the crowd; in a chair, a BLACK 
  HOOD covering his face, his wrists and ankles taped down.  If 
  we re paying attention, we ll see he s wearing BROWN LOAFERS.

  And as we keep pushing into the office, we finally find the 
  source of the voice.  A GUNMAN, on the phone with--

                                                                              CUT TO:

  EXT. OFFICE BUILDING PARKING LOT - DAY

    A NEGOTIATOR, among a heavy perimeter of cop cars--

                                NEGOTIATOR (INTO PHONE)
                I hear you, Hollis, I really do.  He used 
                you.  Took advantage of all your work, and 
                then cut you loose. It s a terrible thing--

  WE HEAR A COMMOTION OVER THE PHONE, before the line goes 
  dead.  Off the Negotiator, concerned--

                                                                              CUT TO:                Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      2.



  INT. OFFICE BULLPEN - SIMULTANEOUS

  The Gunman (HOLLIS) is now amidst the hostages, RIFLE RAISED--

                                HOLLIS
                What was that?!  I heard that!!!

  We now see that he s wearing a VEST WIRED FULL OF EXPLOSIVES.  
  He points his rifle at a WOMAN on the ground--

                                HOLLIS (CONT D)
                All I want is Lydecker don t make me hurt 
                the rest of you!!

  The Woman is crying.  Hollis s nerves are totally frayed.  
  This whole thing is going south, fast...

  As Hollis paces nervously, we see a photo on the wall:  KEN 
  LYDECKER, the man in the hood. In the photo, he s smiling.

  A PHONE RINGS in the hostage area.  Hollis picks up.

                                NEGOTIATOR (FROM PHONE)
                Hollis?  Hollis, are you there?

  Hollis doesn t know how to respond, stays silent...

                                                                      INTERCUT WITH:

  EXT. OFFICE BUILDING PARKING LOT - DAY

                                NEGOTIATOR (INTO PHONE)
                Alright, listen; I ve got people to 
                answer to, and if they think those 
                hostages are in imminent danger, they re 
                gonna start kicking in doors.

                                HOLLIS (FROM PHONE)
                You won t. You know I ll blow the office.

                                NEGOTIATOR (INTO PHONE)
                I know that, but at a certain point it 
                isn t gonna be up to me anymore.  Now 
                since I don t think either of us want to 
                go down that road just yet, help me buy 
                some time.  Send out the employees...

                                HOLLIS (FROM PHONE)
                No...  No that won t work...

                                NEGOTIATOR (INTO PHONE)
                Lemme finish.  The deal is, I get the 
                  bystanders, and you keep Ken Lydecker.  
                He s the only one you really want anyway.

                                NEGOTIATOR (INTO PHONE) (CONT'D)
                You ll still have leverage, and I ll have 
                  something to show my bosses.  And we all 
                get to live a little while longer...

  ON HOLLIS, sweaty.  He doesn t know what to do.  But he 
  watches the Woman Hostage crying on the floor, and a moment 
  of humanity hits him...  Off Hollis--

                                                                              CUT TO:

  EXT. OFFICE BUILDING PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER

  We see a line of HOSTAGES filing out of the building.  The 
  cops receive them, offer medical assistance, etc.

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. OFFICE BULLPEN - DAY

  Hollis is left alone, pacing.  We move past the seated Hooded 
  Man.  If we re paying attention, we ll notice that HIS SHOES 
  ARE NOW BLACK BOOTS.  And his ankles are no longer taped to 
  the chair...  As Hollis paces nervously--

                                HOODED MAN
                Hey... Buddy.  Are we alone yet?

                                HOLLIS
                Shut up, I m...

  Hollis stops pacing.  That was not the voice he expected to 
  hear coming out of that hood.  What the fuck...?

                                HOODED MAN
                Hello?
                      (no response)
                Alright, that sounds like a  yes. 

  The Hooded Man (whose hands are apparently free too) peels 
  off his hood.  This is CHRISTOPHER CHANCE (39).  Rugged and 
  rumpled, like he s living in some permanent hangover state.

  Hollis jerks up his rifle, freaked.

                                HOLLIS
                Where s Lydecker?

                                HOODED MAN (CHANCE)
                Give it a minute, you ll figure it out.

  Off Hollis, we--

                                                                              CUT TO:                Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      4.



  EXT. OFFICE BUILDING PARKING LOT - DAY

  Among the hostages being attended to, we spot KEN LYDECKER.  
  Bloodied, but safe, free and reunited with his family.

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. OFFICE BULLPEN - DAY

  Hollis is both furious and terrified.  He unsafeties his 
  rifle, shoulders it.  Then, a moment of recognition--

                                HOLLIS
                I ve seen you.  You ve been around 
                here...  You re the auditor...

                                CHANCE
                Sure.  Listen, a word of advice?  Never 
                make threats.  You wanna do something, 
                don t talk about it.  Just do it.

                                HOLLIS
                What?

                                CHANCE
                You ve been sending Lydecker threats for 
                weeks.  It got his guard up.  Got him 
                  planning.  And now look where you are...
                      (then)
                Threats just make things messier.  No 
                threats.  Just action.

                                HOLLIS
                      (beat)
                You just committed suicide for that snake-- 
                that rat...  Do you realize that?

                                CHANCE
                Okay, first, I don t think you can be 
                both of those things at the same time.  
                Second, you re a salesman.  You got 
                fired.  Let s not do this like he had you 
                working the chain gang.

                                HOLLIS
                He took away eight years of my life!  
                Left me with nothing.  No severance.  No 
                savings.  He broke me.  And he deserves 
                to die for it.

                                CHANCE
                No he doesn t.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      5.

    CONTINUED:


                                HOLLIS
                Yes he--

                                CHANCE
                No, he really doesn t.  Nobody deserves 
                to die, Hollis.  Frankly, after seeing 
                your behavior today, I think Ken Lydecker 
                deserves a medal for putting up with you 
                as long as he did.
                      (beat)
                Now there aren t too many good outcomes 
                for you here.  But they all start with 
                you giving up that gun...

                                HOLLIS
                I came in here ready to kill him, what 
                makes you think I won t kill you?

  Chance sizes him up.  And then starts walking towards him...

                                CHANCE
                Because I see the rifle, but I don t see 
                a guy who s gonna use it.

                                HOLLIS
                Are you crazy?  I said stop!

                                CHANCE
                Am I crazy?

  Chance walks right up to him, inches from the rifle muzzle.

                                CHANCE (CONT D)
                I assume that was a rhetorical question.

  A tense beat, as they stare each other down.  Before Hollis 
  can speak, CHANCE LASHES OUT, pushing the rifle aside, and 
  striking at Hollis in the same move.  The GUN FIRES, but 
  Chance is well clear of it.

  Hollis tries to fight back, but he s severely outmatched.  
  Chance is no street fighter; every move is graceful.  This is 
  a guy who has spent a lot of time studying martial arts.

  The rifle skitters across a desk and onto the floor, and 
  Chance goes after it.  As he does, Hollis frantically 
  connects some wires from his vest to a DEAD-MAN S SWITCH.

  Chance grabs the rifle, cycles the chamber expertly, and aims 
  it at Hollis.  But Hollis has just finished arming the vest.

                                CHANCE (CONT D)
                You don t wanna go out like this, do you?


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      6.

    CONTINUED: (2)


  A tense moment of stalemate.  Then--

                                HOLLIS
                No...  So I m going outside.  And when I 
                get close enough to Lydecker...
                      (re: the detonator)
                I m going to finish what I started.
                      (starts towards the door...)
                You can stand there and say whatever you 
                want...  That I m about to do a terrible 
                thing.  That I can still get out of this.  
                But it won t change anything.  This is 
                going to happen.

  On Chance, calm and cold.  As Hollis nears the door--

                                CHANCE
                Hey...  What d I tell you?
                      (Hollis turns to face him)
                No threats.

  --and CHANCE SHOOTS HOLLIS, SQUARE IN THE CHEST.

                                                                              CUT TO:

  The Police Negotiator is arguing with his CHIEF, as--

    BOOOM!!!!!  THE THIRD FLOOR EXPLODES, shattering windows...  
  Smoke billows out, as glass and debris rain down on us...

  The footsteps continue as we--

  INT. DARK CORRIDOR - DAY

  --to a shadowy, lamp-lit hallway.  We follow SHOES as they 
  walk down the hall, finally stopping in front of an apartment 
  door.  The door is unlocked (3 locks), and we enter into--

                                                                              CUT TO:

  Modest.  A strange variety of art from around the world.  
  Museum quality pieces sitting beside garbage movie posters...

    CONTINUED:


  No real unifying sensibility to any of it.  Clothes strewn 
  about, dishes piled by the sink.  The place is in complete 
  disarray.  We get the sense that it s always that way.

  As we enter, we get a look at the owner of the feet from the 
  hallway.  Black, early 40s.   He flips through some junk mail 
  on the table, including A FED EX BOX.  Separate from the mail, 
  he sees an unmarked envelope.  Lifts it open, and sees a 
  bundle of cash inside.  This, as a humongous ROTTWEILER greets 
  him.  When the Man speaks, it s with a British accent...

                              MAN
                Hello Carmine...  How s your buddy today?

                                CHANCE (O.S.)
                  Completely immortal...

  Chance emerges from the other room.  His shirt is off, and we 
  see the damage from the explosion.  Scratches on his face; a 
    noticeable limp; a large bandage on his chest...  Behind him, 
  a DOCTOR emerges from the other room as well.

                                DOCTOR
                Hello, Winston.

  Meet WINSTON, Chance s business partner, and trusted friend. 

                              WINSTON
                Doc.  Didn t think I d see him on his 
                feet for weeks.

                                DOCTOR
                I m as surprised as anyone, considering 
                the shape he was in.

  Chance sits, and the dog jumps up licking his face.  As the 
  Doctor goes to leave, he pulls Winston aside--

                                DOCTOR (CONT D)
                That wound is still opening up whenever 
                it feels like it.  It ll heal, but...  He 
                needs to take it easy.  No kidding.

  Beat.  Winston nods.  But as Doc reaches for the envelope of 
  cash, Winston puts his hand down on it defensively.  The Doc 
  gives Winston a look...  Really?

                                DOCTOR (CONT D)
                Been keeping my mouth shut for 10 years. 
                You really think I need to hear the rules 
                again?

  Almost immediately, Winston feels a little silly.  He lets go 
  of the envelope.  The Doc takes it.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      8.

                                DOCTOR (CONT D)
                Winston, is everything alright?

                              WINSTON
                Yeah...  Thanks for your help.

  Doc lingers a beat, before exiting.

                                CHANCE
                You came to check on me?

                              WINSTON
                Who do you think s been feeding that 
                beast all this time you ve been laid up?

                                CHANCE
                Figured maybe he finally got a hold of 
                the mailman and had just been eating him.

  Winston inspects the Fed Ex box on the table.

                              WINSTON
                I see Lydecker finally sent payment...

  Winston unpacks the box to produce a WHISKEY BOTTLE.  He 
  looks at it, puzzled.  Holds it up to Chance.

                              WINSTON (CONT D)
                  Whiskey...?

                                CHANCE
                It s not whiskey.  It s 30 year old 
                  Yamazaki.  It s a $900 bottle of scotch.
                      (off Winston s look)
                Hey, that stuff s not easy to find...

                              WINSTON
                When I suggested we might keep 
                  transactions quiet by bartering instead 
                of cash, I assumed you understood I 
                meant,  bartering for things of value . 
                      (re: a canvas by the table)
                This is a Degas.  It has great value.
                      (re: the whiskey)
                This is a slow Tuesday night for you.

                                CHANCE
                      (re: the scotch)
                Ken Lydecker is a good guy who was in a 
                bad spot. I figured he could use a break.
                      (re: the Degas)
                That guy...  I didn t much like that guy.

                Alright, setting aside for the moment 
                your stunning disregard for our solvency, 
                there s a bigger conversation I ve been 
                putting off... 
                      (then)
                There are a finite number of times you 
                can cause a mess of that magnitude and 
                still have clients show up at our door.

                                CHANCE
                Don t start...  I told you, it was the 
                only way to stop the guy from killing 
                  Lydecker, along with dozens of bystanders. 

                              WINSTON
                  I understand that.  What I can t figure 
                out is why it got that far.  Why not 
                  challenge him at the outset?  You said he 
                hadn t armed the vest yet, why not disarm 
                him cleanly before he did?  

                                CHANCE
                What do you think, I let it get that far 
                because I thought it d be fun?

                              WINSTON
                I don t know, mate, you tell me.

                                CHANCE
                Come on-- I controlled the situation.

                              WINSTON
                The building explo--

                                CHANCE
                  --exploded, I know, I was there.
                      (then)
                I waited because I felt Lydecker was in 
                no immediate danger.  I let it play out 
                until I had an angle.  When the bomb 
                went, I got distance, gave myself cover.  
                I was in control the whole time.

  A beat, Winston unable to take that at face value, but 
  unready to push the issue.  Yet.  He nods, gets up to leave.

                                CHANCE (CONT D)
                Where are you headed?

                              WINSTON
                Peale has a referral he wants me to see.

                Hey...  Thanks for worrying.  But really, 
                there s nothing to worry about.

  Off Winston, hoping that s true.  He exits.

  INT. CHANCE S OFFICE - NIGHT

  Chance and Winston s non-descript office.  Could belong to 
  any small business in LA.  Seated across from Winston is 
  STEPHANIE DOBBS (35, sophisticated-sexy) and her husband 
  JAMES (40s).  In the corner is PEALE, a local cop.

                                STEPHANIE
                It was about a week ago.  I get in the car 
                to go to work, and it won t start.  Two 
                hours later, I m at the dealership, and 
                the mechanic comes out with this look on 
                his face...  He says the good news is my 
                  battery s dead. The bad news is he found 8 
                ounces of Primasheet 2000 under the hood--

                              WINSTON
                Plastic explosive.

                                STEPHANIE
                Had the car started...

                              WINSTON
                Lucky battery.

                                STEPHANIE
                Yeah.  Listen, Mister...

  She waits.  Winston looks to Peale plaintively--

                              LT. PEALE
                No names, Stephanie.  Easier that way.

                                STEPHANIE
                Look, I don t know why somebody would 
                want me dead.  I ve never gotten threats. 
                Don t have enemies.  I don t know what 
                this is.  That s why I need your help.

                I m sorry, but why exactly is this 
                  something the police couldn t handle?

                              LT. PEALE
                Tell him what you do.

                                STEPHANIE
                I work for McNamara Engineering, I run 
                the design team for the Monterey Line.

                              WINSTON
                      (beat; duly impressed--)
                Is that a fact...

                              LT. PEALE
                You re looking at the lady responsible 
                for the most expensive public works 
                project in US history.  Bullet train from 
                LA to San Francisco.

                                STEPHANIE
                With the train s maiden voyage coming up, 
                you can understand why we d like to keep 
                this information private.

                              JAMES 
                The last thing McNamara needs is more 
                  controversy surrounding the project.  But 
                I m not here speaking for the company.  
                And I m not here because I m her 
                  supervisor and I can t do my job without 
                her, though I am and I can t.  I m here 
                because she s my wife.  And if you can 
                help to end this thing faster and safer 
                than the police can, then you re the men 
                we want. 

                              WINSTON
                      (considers all this, before--)
                Alright, what I m going to do is refer 
                you to a private security firm that I 
                think quite highly of.  They ll work with 
                you to develop a security plan--

                                STEPHANIE
                I m sorry, I thought your associate 
                provided the security.

                              WINSTON
                We aren t taking new clients at the moment--

                Why me?

  Everyone stops, sees Chance standing in a shadowed doorframe.

                                STEPHANIE
                Excuse me?

                                CHANCE
                Why not conventional private security?

                                STEPHANIE
                You can flush this person out, yes?  Get 
                him to reveal himself, and take him out.

                                CHANCE
                That s the idea.

                                STEPHANIE
                I don t want to live my life in fear.  
                  Whoever s behind this, they shouldn t 
                have that kind of power over me.  I want 
                to end this.  On my terms.  Soon.

  Chance considers her a long beat.  Mulling it over.  Then--

                                CHANCE
                And how fast does this thing go?

                                STEPHANIE
                      (a bit thrown)
                Safe cruising speed is about 200 mph.

                                CHANCE
                Would I get to ride on it?

  On Stephanie, puzzled...  What the hell is this guy s story?

                                STEPHANIE
                I assume so...

  Chance considers that very seriously.  Winston smiles a 
  resigned little smile.  He knows where this is going...

  Around the dining room table, papers and files spread out.

                I work with a cover, so I ll need a way

                                CHANCE
                The threat needs to see you as vulnerable.  
                That s how we draw him out, keep him off 
                guard.  If I stand out, he can plan around 
                me.  That s how clients get dead.

                                STEPHANIE
                Well, I don t know what else there is...  
                With the rollout coming up, we ll have 
                people in from Sacramento and our 
                  consultants in from Tokyo, but unless you 
                can be the California Secretary of 
                  Transportation or a Japanese person, I 
                don t think that s gonna be much help. 

  Stephanie catches a strange little smile on Chance s face.

                Because there s no escape for him either.  
                Once he takes his shot, he s exposed. And 
                then he s gotta deal with the one 
                variable he wasn t accounting for.

                                STEPHANIE
                What s that?

                                CHANCE
                      (big smile)
                This guy.

  Off Chance--

                                        ACT ONE

  OVER BLACK

  Faint crowd noises...  Muffled cocktail party chatter...

                                CHANCE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Who am I?

  As the muffled chatter comes into relief, we--

                                                                            SMASH TO:

  EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY

  A private platform, filled with invited guests.  A banner 
  above:  MONTEREY LINE - MAIDEN VOYAGE.  And just off the 
  platform, a sleek, double-decker bullet train.  MONTEREY ONE.  
  Chance walks with Stephanie through the crowd.  Eyes open, 
  never watching her.  Always watching the crowd. 

                                STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                You re Tony Graham, my new translator.

  Stephanie s voice-over matches (but just barely) the movement 
  of her lips as she introduces Chance to her colleagues.

                                CHANCE (V.O.)
                What happened to your old translator?

                                STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                The company provided one to deal with our 
                Tokyo consultants, but she made too many 
                  mistakes, so I hired my own.
                      (beat)
                While we re on the subject...  You are 
                fluent in Japanese, right?

  This as FOUR JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN approach and greet 
    Stephanie.  Introductions are made MOS.

                                CHANCE (V.O.)
                I guess we ll find out, won t we?

  We join them as sound returns, and one of the men says 
  something to Stephanie in Japanese.  Chance translates.

                                CHANCE (CONT'D)
                Mr. Saito wishes you congratulations on 
                the well-earned celebration.  They re 
                honored to be invited.

                                STEPHANIE
                Thank you, I m so glad you could be here.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      16.

    CONTINUED:


  As Chance translates, Stephanie catches the Japanese looking 
  at Chance a little sideways...  She tries to stay calm...

  Saito smiles, and turns to go, but then turns back and talks 
  to Chance.  Except Chance doesn t translate.  They re talking 
  to each other.  On Stephanie-- What the hell?  Chance appears 
  to be telling Saito a story.  Hand gestures, big inflection.  
  Unless you speak Japanese, you ll get none of it.  But it 
  sure sounds interesting.  As he finishes, the Japanese all 
  smile big, each shaking Chance s hand.  After they exit--

                                STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                What the hell was that?

                                CHANCE
                What the hell was what?

                                STEPHANIE
                They re our biggest consultants, I have 
                to work with them. What did you just say?

                                CHANCE
                They were surprised my dialect is satsuma-
                ben. I told them my father s father was 
                with MacArthur s staff in Tokyo, where he 
                  befriended a steward from a fishing 
                village on the island of Kyushu.  My 
                  grandfather sponsored the steward when he 
                came to the U.S. for college, where he 
                and my dad became lifelong friends.  And 
                he taught me to speak Japanese.

                                STEPHANIE
                      (totally charmed by that...)
                Wow, that s...  Is that true?

                                CHANCE
                No.  We shouldn t be the last to board, 
                let s go.

  Stephanie shakes her head, and they head to the train. But as 
  they do, Chance spots a SUSPICIOUS GUY in the crowd.  The Guy 
  had an eye on Stephanie and tried to look away...  Not in 
  time.  Chance clocks it...

                                                                              CUT TO:

  EXT. LOS ANGELES OUTSKIRTS - DAY

  The Monterey Line runs through an LA suburb, still at its 
  modest urban cruising speed.  Ten passenger and cargo cars, 
  an engine at both front and back.  It s a good-looking train.

                                                                              CUT TO:              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      17.



  INT. MONTEREY ONE - CAFE CAR - DAY

  The cafe car has been done up for a cocktail party.  Right 
  now, everyone s attention is focused at the front of the car, 
  where DAVID MCNAMARA (60s), addresses the crowd. 

                              MCNAMARA
                ...when my father started this company 52 
                years ago, I doubt he d have believed the 
                State of California could get its act 
                together to accomplish something like 
                this.  But in three hours we ll be in San 
                  Francisco, nothing will ever be the same 
                again, and it s because of all of you.
                      (a STEWARD whispers in his ear)
                Folks, I m told we re now clear of the 
                marker.  Now most of you know Stephanie 
                Dobbs, she s the project leader for this 
                mess. Stephanie, will you give the order?

                                STEPHANIE
                Full speed ahead...

  Off Stephanie, beaming--

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. MONTEREY ONE - CONTROL CAB - DAY

  The ENGINEER pushes the throttle forward, and we watch the 
  digital speedometer move.  90 mph... 110... 140...

  EXT. LOS ANGELES OUTSKIRTS - DAY

  THE TRAIN SCREAMS BY.  A 200 MPH bullet, bound for San Fran.

                                                                TIME DISSOLVE TO:

  INT. MONTEREY ONE - CAFE CAR - DAY

  Cocktail party.  Chance talks to TOM (40s), as Stephanie is 
  in another conversation, just arms length away from Chance.

                              TOM
                Don t sweat what everyone says about her, 
                I m sure you ll enjoy working for her.

                                CHANCE
                What does everyone say?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      18.

    CONTINUED:


                              TOM
                That she s miserable to work for.  That 
                if you re not as smart as she is, you 
                must be incompetent.  That mistakes 
                should be punishable by death...

                                CHANCE
                So it s not true?

                              TOM
                No, it s true.  But I love her anyway.

                                CHANCE
                So if s she s so difficult, why does 
                anyone put up with working with her?

                              TOM
                She d tell you it s because no one can do 
                what she does.  But the truth is, James d 
                never let anyone look at her funny, much 
                less suggest getting rid of her...
                      (unable to ignore his scratches)
                Say, what happened to your face?

                                CHANCE
                You should see the other guy.  What s 
                left of him, anyway...

  Tom laughs, although something about Chance s tone creeps him 
  out a little.  Stephanie joins them.

                              TOM
                I was just telling Tony here about how 
                everyone hates you but me...

  Stephanie punches Tom in the arm.

                                STEPHANIE
                Tom was James s Best Man, he introduced 
                us.  He s Mac s General Counsel.

  Tom sees an OLDER WOMAN waving him down across the room...

                              TOM
                Excuse me.  Our Undersecretary for Mass 
                Transit isn t through bugging me about 
                the tab for today.

  Tom excuses himself, and exits.

                                CHANCE
                What was the tab for all this?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      19.

                All in?  About 80 billion.
                      (off Chance s double-take)
                We went a little over budget.

                                CHANCE
                Well I should hope so.  Do I even want to 
                know how much of that came from my taxes?

                                STEPHANIE
                About 80 billion.

                                CHANCE
                      (beat; under his breath)
                Even I want to kill you a little bit 
                right now...

  Stephanie has to smile a little.  Then, quietly, privately--

                                CHANCE (CONT D)
                Listen, if it s possible, have them turn 
                the air-conditioning down 10 degrees.

                                STEPHANIE
                Why, are you warm?

                                CHANCE
                I m not, but at least 10 different guys 
                here are starting to sweat... 

                                STEPHANIE
                What do you care how much other guys 
                sweat?

                                CHANCE
                Because God doesn t like cold-blooded 
                killers, so He makes as few as He can.  
                The prospect of hurting someone causes 
                stress in most people.  They sweat.  Fat 
                guys sweat when it s 5 degrees too warm.  
                I like to be able to tell the difference.

                                STEPHANIE
                Oh...  Ok.  I ll see what I can do.

                                CHANCE
                Great.  And feel free to keep asking 
                  questions about how I do my job.  I find 
                it not at all irritating or distracting. 

  Stephanie doesn t shrink from that.  And we get the sense 
  Chance likes it.  But we also sense there s something else on 
  her mind...


                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      20.

  INT. MONTEREY ONE - CAFE CAR - DAY

  Chance is on a cell phone.  He s talking discreetly, no one 
  else in earshot.  He watches Stephanie intently as he talks.

                                CHANCE (INTO PHONE)
                Line forms to the left.  She s a bad 
                boss.  She s stubborn as all get-out.  
                She designed a $40 billion train that 
                somehow cost 80.  If there are 10 people 
                here who haven t considered killing this 
                woman at least once, I d be amazed.

                Just out of curiosity, does she know

  suits.  We focus on the LATINO one of the two.   Guerrero?  
  He scans the place, before he spots--

  A SKINNY GUY (40s), sitting alone in a corner booth, reading 
  a book, eating his lunch.  The Thugs sit, boxing him in.

                                LATINO THUG
                You re the guy digging around South Trust 
                Bank.  Asking questions.  Making trouble.

  It s weird, but the Skinny Guy doesn t seem intimidated.

                                SKINNY GUY
                And you re... employees of the bank?

                                LATINO THUG
                You could say that.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      22.

                                SKINNY GUY
                I see. Well, I m sorry, but your employer 
                is engaged in some pretty shady loans 
                with his directors  families.  And my 
                friends need to know just how shady if 
                they re going to make their case.  So I m 
                afraid we re at an impasse.

                                LATINO THUG
                We re at a what?

                                SKINNY GUY
                Impasse.  It means we disagree without 
                prospect of resolution.

  Latino Thug looks to Other Thug.  You believe this guy?

                                LATINO THUG
                See, we came here to explain it to you.  
                But you re not getting it.  So maybe we 
                need to go for a little walk to the alley 
                out back, and explain it different.  So 
                we don t have  impasse. 

                                SKINNY GUY
                      (beat; considers them)
                Alright.  But I have to warn you.  If 
                this gets violent, I m gonna fight back.

  The Thugs chuckle.  They outweigh him by about 500 lbs.

                                LATINO THUG
                You re gonna fight back...

                                SKINNY GUY
                  Actually, you re right,  fight back  is a 
                little misleading.  What I ll do is break 
                into your homes some night soon, and kill 
                you each in your sleep.
                      (off their stunned silence)
                You ll probably be first, Alfredo.  That 
                way Steven here can have a few extra days 
                with Marla and the girls. It s only fair.

  On the Thugs.  What the hell is this...

                                LATINO THUG
                How do you know my name?

                                SKINNY GUY
                Your employer keeps sensitive information 
                on a drive he thinks is secure. It isn t.
                      (re: the door)
                Shall we?

                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      23.

    CONTINUED: (2)


  The look in the Skinny Guy s eyes makes our skin crawl.  
  There s something just slightly unhinged about it...

  The Thugs consider how long they have to wait to leave in 
  order to maintain a shred of dignity.  Long enough?  Yeah, 
  that ll do it.  They get up, and exit silently.  Skinny Guy 
  watches them go, as his CELL RINGS.  He answers.

                                SKINNY GUY (GUERRERO)(INTO PHONE)(CONT'D)
                This is Guerrero.

  Off Guerrero--

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. MONTEREY ONE - CAFE CAR - DAY

  Chance and Stephanie sit at a booth.  A CELL RING comes from 
  Chance s pocket.  He fishes it out and answers.

                                STEPHANIE
                That s funny, my phone has the same ring.

                                CHANCE (INTO PHONE)
                Yeah.  Yeah, go ahead...

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. CHANCE S OFFICE - DAY

  Winston, on the phone--

                              WINSTON (INTO PHONE)
                Guerrero is in.  But there s something 
                else.  I went through her call logs,  
                found something that may be interesting.

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. MONTEREY ONE - CAFE CAR - DAY

  As Chance listens silently to Winston on the other end, a 
  STEWARD (whom we ll only see from the neck down) sets a few 
  drinks around the table.

                                STEPHANIE
                That s strange, don t you think?  That 
                we d both have the same...
                      (looks closer)
                Wait a minute, that is my phone.

                                CHANCE (INTO PHONE)
                Alright, let me know what he finds.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      24.

                                STEPHANIE
                      (snatches the phone back)
                You stole my phone?!

                                CHANCE
                  I borrowed it.  Listen, do you know a 
                Times reporter named Mark Hoffer?

                                STEPHANIE
                I forgot to plug it in last night, and 
                you re here running it down-- 

                                CHANCE
                Focus, please.  Mark Hoffer.

                                STEPHANIE
                He covers the project, he used to call 
                  periodically for background or a quote.  
                Why?

                                CHANCE
                His name isn t in your phone book, but 
                his number s listed as incoming a dozen 
                times or so.  Mostly unreturned.

                                STEPHANIE
                Yeah, well, I m bad about returning 
                calls.  Haven t talked to him in almost a 
                year.  What difference does it make?

                                CHANCE
                Just that reporters are like vultures; 
                when they linger, it s worth noticing...

  Chance trails off, his attention focused out the window...

                                STEPHANIE
                  Hello...?

  ...we then notice what s drawn his attention.  In the 
  window s reflection, Chance sees the Suspicious Guy, now 
  clearly eying Stephanie from across the car.  A beat, before 
  the GUY STARTS WALKING THIS WAY...  Chance calmly stands up, 
  picks up a full cocktail...  Waits...  Then turns, 
     accidentally  spilling the drink all over Suspicious Guy...

                                CHANCE
                Jeez, I m sorry about that...

  Chance helps the guy clean up...  But as he does, we see he s 
    discreetly frisking him.  Chance then turns him, looks him 
  square in the eye.  Evaluating the threat.  The look of 
  surprise in the guy s eyes says he s clear.  Chance backs off.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      25.

    CONTINUED: (2)


                                CHANCE (CONT D)
                Can t take me anywhere...

  The Guy gives Chance a sideways look, before continuing on 
  and approaching Stephanie.  Chance stays close by...

                                SUSPICIOUS GUY (BILL)
                We ve never met, but I think you know who 
                I am.  My name is Bill Arnold.  May I sit?

  Stephanie is instantly uncomfortable.  Seems to know exactly 
  who this guy is, and not in a good way...

                                STEPHANIE
                Of course.

                              BILL
                I ll be honest, I came here prepared to 
                say to your face what you already know 
                I ve been saying in Sacramento.  But now 
                that I ve seen this thing you ve created, 
                now that it s real...  I think the first 
                thing I need to say is, I m sorry.  
                  Evidently, you were worth every penny...

  Chance watches over the conversation, but suddenly, we start 
  to notice the sounds in the room start to drop out.  Bill s 
  voice...  Then the crowd noise...  On Chance, hyper-alert.  
  He can t tell what it is, but something isn t right...

  Chance scans the crowd...  Still can t put his finger on 
  what s tripping his alarms...  Then, from the silence, we 
  begin to hear the SOUND OF TINKLING ICE CUBES rise in the 
  mix...  Chance focuses on a few glasses in the hands of 
  people around the room...  From glass to glass, until his 
  focus settles on Stephanie s...  And the ICE CUBES in her 
  drink...  As Stephanie lifts her glass to take a sip--

  SOUND RUSHES BACK IN...  Chance grabs her arm, taking away 
  her glass, and leading her away from the table...  Before she 
  can protest, she sees the look in his eye, and knows exactly 
  what it means.  She goes along.

                              BILL (CONT D)
                Excuse me, we were just in the middle of 
                  a conversation...

  Chance ignores him, keeps Stephanie moving.  They pass James, 
  surprised by the sight of Chance whisking his wife away.

                                CHANCE
                      (passing by James--)
                Stay.  Keep your mouth shut.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      26.

    CONTINUED: (3)


                              JAMES
                Wait a minute, you can t just--

  --but Chance is already past him.  James helplessly watches 
  as Chance and Stephanie continue towards the rear exit...  

                                STEPHANIE
                What s going on?

                                CHANCE
                The ice in your glass was cubed.

                                STEPHANIE
                So?

                                CHANCE
                No one else s is.

  ON BILL.  Takes a swig from his own glass, but it s empty.  
  Just ice.  He grabs Stephanie s fresh one, and takes a 
  healthy pull.

  Back on Chance and Stephanie, as they near the exit...

                                CHANCE (CONT'D)
                They re plastic.  I ve seen them before.

                                STEPHANIE
                  Plastic...  What for?

                                CHANCE
                Delivery system.

  BACK ON BILL...  Not feeling so hot.  Then, his eyes roll 
  back in his head, and he hits the deck.  Convulsions.   A 
  WOMAN SCREAMS.  A crowd forms around him.  As Chance and 
  Stephanie reach the exit, Chance stops, turns back...

  He scans the crowd surrounding Bill.  Face after face, all 
  focused intently on Bill.  Except ONE STEWARD, who Chance 
  catches staring back at him...  He was watching Stephanie 
  exit...  Chance grins.

                                CHANCE (CONT D)
                      (to himself)
                Hello, fella...

  He then takes Stephanie out the exit into the next car, as 
  the door whooshes shut behind them.

                                        ACT TWO

  INT. MONTEREY ONE - COACH PASSENGER CAR - DAY

  Chance and Stephanie enter an empty passenger car.  Stephanie 
  paces, clearly panicked by the bullet she just dodged.

  Chance sees an EMERGENCY STOP handle on the bulkhead.  He 
  cracks the glass, pulls the switch.  Nothing.

                                STEPHANIE
                Not operational.  Most of the systems 
                back here aren t online yet...

  Stephanie is shaking.  Seriously freaked out.

                                STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                Why d you let him drink from that glass?

                                CHANCE
                He s not my problem.

  He notices Stephanie s state.  Goes to her, takes her pulse.  

                                STEPHANIE
                I m fine.  I m fine...

  It s taking every ounce of will she has to hold back tears.

                                CHANCE
                You re all over the place.

    Completely catching Stephanie off guard, Chance hugs her.  
  She pushes back--

                                CHANCE (CONT'D)
                Relax, this isn t a date...  It s a 
                  physiological response, it ll slow your 
                heart rate down.
                      (he holds her; she lets him)
                Not sure why, but it works.  Something 
                about human contact and stress receptors.  

  A beat.  Chance doesn t intend this to be sexual or romantic 
  in any way.  But off his face, we FLASH OUT TO--

  --Chance and a DIFFERENT WOMAN, vague resembling Stephanie.  
  Ten frames.  Barely enough to get oriented.  But we can just 
  make it out...  They re dancing...  

  BACK TO SCENE.  Chance tightens his grip just enough for us 
  to notice.  She pushes away again; he lets her go.  But as 
  they separate, she sees BLOOD ON HER SHIRT.  Looks at Chance 
  and sees a red spots growing on his shirt...

                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      28.

                                STEPHANIE
                You re bleeding...

                                CHANCE
                It s a scratch.

                                STEPHANIE
                That s no scratch.  What happened to you?

                                CHANCE
                Long story.  Can we lock this door?

                                STEPHANIE
                Not from here.  Seriously, are you ok?

  Chance finds a loose CHAIN, and rigs it to the door.  If the 
  door opens, the falling chain makes a racket.  But as he rigs 
  it, he senses her eyes on his back.  He changes the subject--

                                CHANCE
                We ve got at least one of them out in the 
                open now.  A steward.  Not for nothing, 
                but you should really talk to your 
                caterers about their hiring process.

                                STEPHANIE
                At least one of them...?

                                CHANCE
                  Sometimes they work in teams.  Frankly, 
                I m not convinced the person or people 
                who paid for it aren t up there too.  
                Either way, right now he s trying not to 
                panic.  He missed the shot, probably 
                knows I made him, probably made me for 
                security if he s any good.  

                                STEPHANIE
                So what do we do now?

                                CHANCE
                He s irritated.  He s gotta come to us 
                now, and he knows it.  So we let him make 
                that mistake.

  Off Chance, as he finishes up his door alarm...

                                                                              CUT TO:

  EXT. PARK - DAY

  Guerrero sits on a park bench.  He s approached by LOWELL 
  (50s), balding and overweight.  Lowell, who looks like he s 
  had a bitch of a morning, sits down nearby Guerrero.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      29.

                              GUERRERO
                Thanks for coming.

                                LOWELL
                Sorry I m late.  It s been...  It s been 
                a rough morning.

                              GUERRERO
                I need some information about a guy who 
                works in your office.  Name s Mark 
                Hoffer, he s on the Sacramento desk.

                                LOWELL
                      (beat; an indignant glare)
                Is that supposed to be a joke?

                              GUERRERO
                Was it funny?

                                LOWELL
                Mister Guerrero...  I owe for what you 
                did for me and my family.  But there must 
                come a point at which I ve repaid that 
                debt.  Now I know what kind of a man you 
                are, so when you pull me out of the 
                office to ask these kinds of questions--

                              GUERRERO
                What are you talking about?

                                LOWELL
                Are you saying you don t know?

  Off Guerrero, at a loss--

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. MONTEREY ONE - COACH CAR - 2ND FLOOR - DAY

  Chance and Stephanie sit in a booth.  She s lost in thought.

                That guy back there, he said you were worth 
                every penny...  What was all that about?

                                STEPHANIE
                I m due a sizable bonus if the train comes 
                online by a certain date.  Bill s a lawyer 
                with CALDOT, he s been whining to the press 
                about our overruns.  When he heard about 
                the bonus, he tried to paint me as the 
                poster child for waste in the project.

                Hey, if they could ve found someone to do

                Funny, don t remember you mentioning that.

                All my clients say that.

                                STEPHANIE
                Then why are you making that face?

                                CHANCE
                Because all my clients are lying when 
                they say that.
                      (off her look)
                If you really wanted to help me, you d 
                tell me everything. Secrets. People you ve 
                hurt. Stuff that keeps you up at night.  
                Because 9 times out of 10, one of those 
                things is why somebody wants you dead.

                                STEPHANIE
                So you re saying I m lying to you?

                                CHANCE
                I m saying everybody lies to me.  Even 
                when it might save their life to come 
                clean, they lie.  You wanna know why?

                What s your point?

                                STEPHANIE
                If you have such a low opinion of people, 
                why risk your life for them?  Why be the 
                guy who ll take a bullet for a stranger, 
                a human target for hire, if they deserve--

                I didn t say they deserve it.

                You just said--

                                CHANCE
                I said people have secrets, and secrets 
                can be dangerous. Nobody deserves to die.

  Stephanie takes that in a moment.  The silence is broken, 
  though, as HER PHONE RINGS.  Chance grabs it, answers...

                                CHANCE
                Once you what?

                                STEPHANIE
                About eighteen months ago, I had a run-in 
                with management about a design issue.  
                Happens all the time, but this one they 
                gave me an especially hard time with.  I 
                was mad when I talked to Mark, I felt bad 
                  immediately that I said anything to him.

                                CHANCE
                What did you say?

                                STEPHANIE
                There s a component in the brake 
                  assemblies, a Y-Wing connector, that we 
                bought from a new supplier.  Most Y-
                Wing s are titanium, these were some 
                alloy I d never heard of.  So I did some 
                testing.  When I exposed them to a 
                  significant static charge in just the 
                right way, they overheated.

                                CHANCE
                Is that a problem?

                                STEPHANIE
                Not if the static charge is below a 
                certain limit.  But at extremely high 
                speeds, it could lead to a catastrophic 
                failure of the brakes.

                                CHANCE
                Train won t stop.

                                STEPHANIE
                Not when you want it to, no.

                                CHANCE
                So what happened?

                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      33.

                                STEPHANIE
                I told management, they rejected my 
                  conclusions.  Said I over-estimated the 
                charge, that it d take a driver recklessly 
                  exceeding safe speeds for there to even 
                  theoretically be a problem.  Said it d 
                cost billions to retrofit my changes, and 
                that  my compulsive need for perfection  
                wasn t compelling justification.  But 
                where I come from, when something s broke 
                you fix it.  So I kept pushing.  A week 
                later, they caved.  Said they d make the 
                fixes.  I haven t thought about it since.

                                CHANCE
                So far, so good.  Why d you tell Hoffer?

                                STEPHANIE
                I don t air dirty laundry outside the 
                office, I didn t even tell James.  But 
                Mark caught me right in the middle of it. 
                I was frustrated, I made a mistake.

                                CHANCE
                  Stephanie...  Is there a chance he was 
                gonna write about this?

                                STEPHANIE
                Write about it?

                                CHANCE
                Nice sidebar to go along with the launch

                                STEPHANIE
                It s possible.  But what difference would 
                it make?  If they fixed the brakes, what 
                  difference would it make if he wrote...

  They both arrive at the hypothetical answer at the same time.  
  It hangs in the air a moment.  But before either can respond, 
  we hear THE CHAIN SLINKING TO THE GROUND downstairs.

  Chance grabs Stephanie, they hide behind a bulkhead near the 
  rear of the car.  Chance draws his gun...

  FOOTFALLS up the spiral stairs...  Slowly approaching...  But 
  as they get closer, something about it seems wrong to Chance.  
  Whoever s clunking around out there, it ain t a professional 
  assassin.  Chance holsters his gun.

                When I couldn t find you, I asked James 
                where you were.  He seemed weird about 
                it, didn t really answer.  I got worried,

                There s a doc up there, he s managed to 
                  stabilize him.  They talked about 
                stopping and medivac-ing him to UCSF, but 
                McNamara figures it s actually faster to 
                keep him on the train...  They put the 
                pedal to the floor; a chopper would 
                actually be slower than we are right now.
                      (then)

                              TOM
                      (thinks)
                  Vaguely... You d talked to some reporter, 
                wanted to make sure you hadn t violated 
                your confidentiality agreement...

                                STEPHANIE
                You didn t tell anyone else at the 
                company about that, did you?

                              TOM
                Did I say anything...?  Why would I--  
                No, of course not.

  There was a bit of a hitch in his answer.  Chance clocks it.

                              TOM (CONT'D)
                Steph, are you sure you re okay?

                                STEPHANIE
                Yeah...  Yeah, I m fine.

  A beat, before Tom exits.  Chance eyes him warily as he goes.

                An editor at the paper owes me.  Few 
                years back, a utility company hired a guy 
                to hassle him and his family over a story 
                he was working.  I got him out of it. 

                              WINSTON
                How did you do that?

                Not sure what you re finding there, but 
                I m feeling like McNamara management may 
                be involved in this.

                              GUERRERO
                Because companies like this aren t built 
                to off people, so it tends to be sloppy.  
                Someone talks, the wrong guy s listening,

                Someone decides you re making a big deal 
                out of nothing.  Figure they re $40

                for a few billion more just to make you 
                happy.  So they lie to shut you up.  
                Except they find out the Times is writing 
                about it.  Even if they think the train s 
                safe, they can t allow a suggestion 
                  otherwise.  No paying passenger would 
                ever go near this thing.  Someone asks, 
                 How do we make this problem go away ,

  A generic office building food court.  Guerrero approaches a 
  table where an OLD MAN (60s) sits eating his lunch.  But as 
  Guerrero nears him, a BEEFY GUY in a suit gets up and stands 
  in Guerrero s way. They stare each other down a beat, before--

                It s alright.

  The Beefy Guy steps aside, and Guerrero takes a seat.

                              OLD MAN (CONT D)

                              OLD MAN
                An answer for everything...  This is why 
                  I stopped finding work for you.

                              GUERRERO
                  I stopped taking the work you found, 
                that s why you stopped finding it.

                              OLD MAN
                What do you want?

                work put on the street by a company 
                called McNamara Engineering.

  The Old Man looks to the Beefy Guy, who shrugs.

                              OLD MAN
                Not to the best of our recollection.

                              GUERRERO

                shaft.  There s a seam that runs along 
                the front of each box.  If the connectors 
                were replaced, the seams should be

  Chance and Stephanie unlock the panel, and as they hoist it 
  up, THE WIND NOISE IS DEAFENING.  Like standing next to a jet 
  engine with the cowlings off.  Chance takes off his dress 
  shirt, and we see that the wound on his chest is becoming a 
  problem.  Stephanie is a little horrified by it, but Chance 
  doesn t even acknowledge it.  He crawls down into--

  EXT. MONTEREY ONE - CRAWL-SPACE - CONTINUOUS

  Chance slips into the crawl-space.  The wind is overwhelming.  
  Hard to keep his eyes open...  Hard to breathe...

  The space itself is open on three sides, made up of a loose 
  criss-cross of supports.  Above is the undercarriage of the 
  train.  Super-tight; very little room to maneuver.

  Chance hangs on to the supports above, with his feet wedged 
  into the side struts for support.

  He shimmies awkwardly down the crawl-space, straining to keep 
  his weight suspended over the bottom guard rail.

  He sees the brake-case, just needs to make it that far...  A 
  few more yards...  But, as he moves, his leg jerks back.  His 
  shoelace caught in the rigging...  Chance yanks at it, but 
  can t get it free...  Straining to hold himself up...  On his 
  undershirt, we see THE RED SPOTS JOINING, where the wound on 
  his chest is now worsening...

  Chance gives it one last pull...  His foot comes out of shoe, 
  the shoe falls onto the guardrail, and is then SUCKED IN BY 
  THE JETSTREAM...  ROCKETS AWAY LIKE A BULLET, OUT TO THE SIDE 
  OF THE TRAIN, and then UP IN THE AIR, riding the train s air 
  current like it was shot out of a cannon.  It s violent and 
  quick.  On Chance, resolving not to go the way of the shoe...

  He digs deep and regains his grip.  It takes all he s got, 
  but he REACHES THE BLACK BOX...  Feels around behind it...

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. MONTEREY ONE - CARGO CAR - DAY

  Stephanie waits nervously by the open access panel...  No 
  sign of Chance... She s really starting to worry, as A HAND 
  POPS OUT OF THE OPENING.  Then another...

  Stephanie rushes over, and helps A GRIMY, BLOODY CHANCE haul 
  himself up onto the deck.  He collapses, exhausted.

                                STEPHANIE
                Please tell me we re ok...

                                CHANCE
                      (heaving)
                Well...  Ok...

                                STEPHANIE
                We re not ok, are we?

                                CHANCE
                We re screwed...

  Stephanie pops up off the ground, paces nervously.

                                CHANCE (CONT D)
                Here s what we re gonna do.  We go to the 
                front, and you re gonna tell them they 
                need to cut the engines--

                                STEPHANIE
                It s not that simple...  There are three 
                high grade curves on the route.

                If we are where I think we are, there s 
                one coming up in about 60 miles.

                                CHANCE
                So?

                                STEPHANIE
                So there are only two rules to driving a 
                train.  And one of them is, when you get 
                to a curve, slow down.

                                CHANCE
                      (putting it together)
                We ll go off the rails at this speed...
                How long would it take to coast to a 
                safer speed?

                                STEPHANIE
                More than we ve got--

  CHANCE TACKLES STEPHANIE to the ground, just before--

  BANG!  Gunshots ring out...  The ASSASSIN IS AT THE OPPOSITE 
  END OF THE CAR, FIRING AT US...

  Chance pulls his gun and returns fire, as he and Stephanie 
  take cover behind a bundle of machinery.  A beat, as Chance 
  peers over the bundle to check the Assassin s position.

                                CHANCE
                Run as fast as you can to the door.

                                STEPHANIE
                But it s the wrong way, we have to get to 
                the main car to warn them about--

                                CHANCE
                Go!

  Before Stephanie can even react, Chance pops up and WALKS OUT 
  IN THE OPEN TOWARDS THE ASSASSIN.  The Assassin eyes go wide 
  with surprise as he sees Chance walking right into his fire.  
  The Assassin tries to aim for a clean shot, but Chance forces 
  him to take cover...

  STEPHANIE RUNS towards the rear door.  As she nears it, Chance 
  starts to fall back, TOPPLING A STACK OF BOXES to cover their 
    retreat...  They both sprint out the door and into--

                                                                              CUT TO:              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      44.



  INT. MONTEREY ONE - EMPTY PASSENGER CAR - CONTINUOUS

  Chance and Stephanie sprint through a barebones passenger 
  car, largely unfinished...  A beat, before THE ASSASSIN 
  APPEARS AT THE DOOR, FIRING AWAY...  Chance returns fire, but 
  after the first shot-- CLICK.  Out of ammo...

  He and Stephanie quickly make it through the next door, and 
  shut it.  The Assassin s gunfire impacts off the closing 
  door, just missing them...

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. MONTEREY ONE - 2ND TO LAST CAR - MOMENTS LATER

  Chance enters, shuts the door, and shuts a CLOSET DOOR just 
  inside, which covers the main door.  He then HAULS DOWN A 
  CART FULL OF EQUIPMENT, barricading both doors closed.  A 
  beat, before THWACK, the Assassin runs up against the 
  barricade on the other side.

                                CHANCE
                Oughta hold him for a few minutes...

  Inside the car, we see tools, equipment...  It s the rear 
  engineering car.  Through the barricaded door, we can hear 
  the Assassin working at the door, trying to get through.

                                STEPHANIE
                I don t know how many minutes we ve got.  
                12, maybe 15 before we hit the curve...

  She pulls out her phone.  TIGHT ON THE DISPLAY: A RED BATTERY  
    INDICATOR. Stephanie dials: JAMES. It rings, hits voicemail.

                                CHANCE
                Who are you calling?

                                STEPHANIE
                James.  He can at least warn them...  
                Come on, pick up...

  Stephanie dials again, but as she does the battery goes, and 
  the phone shuts itself down.

                                STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                Dammit!

                                CHANCE
                There s gotta be an intercom or 
                  something...

                They hooked up these cars so they could 
                test speed at full capacity.  They re 
                ballast.  Only electronics working are 
                the lights and the air conditioning...

  A beat, as they both arrive at the same idea together...  
  They slowly look up to a partially exposed AIR DUCT...

  MOMENTS LATER, INSIDE THE AIR DUCT...

    --Chance s head is poked into the duct, checking it out.  
  It s tight, barely big enough for a person to be on all 
  fours.  Chance then drops back down to--

  THE REAR CAR, with Stephanie...

                                CHANCE
                Will it support both of us?

                                STEPHANIE
                I don t know.  I didn t exactly design it 
                to be a jungle gym. 

                                CHANCE
                It doesn t have to hold for long, we just 
                have to get past him to the next car.

  Off Stephanie...

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. AIR DUCT - MOMENTS LATER

  Chance leads Stephanie down the cramped duct...  They quickly 
  reach a thick grating at the end of the car--

                                STEPHANIE
                There s two--

  Chance makes a face-- Shhhhh!!!  Then, whispered--

                                CHANCE
                If he hears us, we re gonna be dodging 
                  bullets...

                                STEPHANIE
                There s two grates between here and the 
                next car.  You can just unscrew them...

  Chance pulls out a UTILITY KNIFE, and carefully unscrews the 
  grate, before gently setting it aside.  They then crawl into 
  the next section.  Like ribbed, flexible Kevlar; we re now in 
  the connecting space between the cars.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      46.

    CONTINUED:


  Chance then carefully, quietly, unscrews the second grate 
  that ll take them into the Assassin s car. As he finishes, he 
  turns to Stephanie, and holds a finger to his lips.  He takes 
  a breath...  But as he pulls away the grate to set it aside--

  WE SEE THE ASSASSIN A FEW YARDS AWAY, IN THE DUCT!  He s 
  trying same thing we are...  A moment of surprise for both of 
  them, before the Assassin goes for his gun, and Chance 
  scrambles towards him, trying to close the distance...

  The gun comes out, but Chance is on top of him--  They trade 
  punches, elbows...  Like wild dogs locked inside a metal 
  trunk...  With each punch and kick, we see the BRACKETS 
    SUPPORTING THE DUCT STRAINING under their weight... 

  They trade punches, but Chance is losing stamina... The 
  Assassin begins to get the upper hand, lands a few nasty 
  elbows...  With the last one, THE DUCT GIVES WAY, and we--

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. MONTEREY ONE - EMPTY PASSENGER CAR - CONTINUOUS

  --where one end of duct drops--  Chance and Assassin slide down 
  and onto the deck...  The section holding Stephanie teeters for 
  a moment, before it gives way, dumping her hard to the ground...

  Chance gets up just in time to DODGE THE REST OF THE DUCT AS 
  IT FALLS...  The lower end of the duct hits the ground, 
  SNAPPING LOOSE THE END THAT WAS STILL CONNECTED...  The top 
  end then topples SIDEWAYS INTO A WINDOW, SHATTERING IT, 
  FILLING THE CAR WITH WHIPPING WIND.

  Chance looks to Stephanie; she s not moving.  But before he 
  can go to her, the ASSASSIN SPRINGS...  This isn t like 
  fighting Hollis earlier; the Assassin knows what he s 
  doing...  Hand-to-hand combat between two pros...

  But the Assassin goes to work on Chance s wound, which is now 
  a full-on bleeding mess...  Chance summons the strength to 
  throw the Assassin off him...  He then clambers across the 
  floor, where a STEEL PIPE is rolling...  He grabs the pipe, 
  stands, brandishing it, ready to charge, but as he turns, he 
  sees the ASSASSIN HAS RECOVERED THE GUN.  A beat...  The 
  Assassin smiles a little...  Cocks his gun...  Checkmate. 

  On Chance...  Think fast...  He turns, AND FIRES THE PIPE AT 
  A WINDOW OPPOSITE THE SHATTERED ONE... As it hits, A 
  SPIDERING CRACK grows in the window...  The Assassin looks at 
  Chance puzzled--  What the hell was that for?  But then, the 
  window finally shatters, and--




                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      47.

    CONTINUED:


  ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE...  The two open windows create a cross-
  draft that TURNS THE WHIPPING WIND INTO A CYCLONE!  Hurricane 
  force winds swirl, tossing the Assassin like a rag doll...

  The odds evened, Chance scoots towards the Assassin, almost 
  gliding across the deck as he catches a tailwind...  HE 
  CRASHES INTO THE ASSASSIN, checking him into the wall, just a 
  few feet away from the OPEN WINDOW...

  They struggle, each trying to get the upper hand...  Then, in 
  one move, Chance pivots, spinning the Assassin s momentum 
  against him, towards the window, and with one last shove, THE 
  ASSASSIN IS SUCKED RIGHT OUT OF THE TRAIN.

  Chance drops to the ground, completely spent...  Catching his 
  breath...  But as he raises his head, he sees Stephanie, now 
  on all fours, hauling herself up.  They exchange a look...  
  We re not out of the woods yet...

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. MONTEREY ONE - CAFE CAR - DAY

  Chance, with Stephanie tight behind him, enters the crowded 
  car.  James approaches, and Stephanie rushes to him, hugging 
  him tightly...

  Chance looks like grim death, and draws strange looks from 
  most of the car s passengers.  CHANCE THEN FIRES HIS PISTOL 
  into the deck.  That gets the attention of the rest of them.

                                CHANCE
                In about 10 minutes, this train is going 
                to crash.  I suggest we all get off it 
                  beforehand.

  Stunned silence, as the bewildered crowd stares at Chance.

                              SAITO (JAPANESE SUBTITLED)
                Who are you?

                What?

                                STEPHANIE
                I told you about the defect in the brake 
                  assemblies.  I warned you.

                  Stephanie, you sound like a crazy person, 
                calm down...

  James tries to put an arm around Stephanie to calm her down, 
  but she pushes him away--

                                STEPHANIE
                In a few minutes, we re going to arrive 
                at the R-5 curve.  But when the engineer 
                applies the brakes to slow us down before 
                the curve, the brakes are going to fail.

                              MCNAMARA
                Alright, let s everyone take a breath.
                This train is perfectly safe.  Its brakes 
                are perfectly safe.  Would I be here if I 
                had the slightest doubt about that?

                                STEPHANIE

                Excuse me.  Seems like there s an easy 
                way to resolve this...

  Stephanie gets it immediately.  She heads towards the control 
  cabin.  Chance follows.

                                                                              CUT TO:              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      49.



  INT. MONTEREY ONE - CONTROL CAB - MOMENTS LATER

    Stephanie, Chance, James, the Engineer, and a number of 
    onlookers.  McNamara pushes his way to the front.

                                STEPHANIE
                Slow us down, please.

  The Engineer, a bit confused, engages the brakes.  Everyone 
  watches the speedometer...  231 MPH... 227... 221...  They re 
  slowing.  Relieved sighs around the cabin.

                              MCNAMARA
                  Stephanie, come tomorrow, we re going to 
                have to have a serious discussion about 
                your continued employment with--

  A LOUD METALLIC POPPING SOUND comes from under the deck.  
  Everyone gets quiet a moment.  ANOTHER POP.  THEN ANOTHER.  
  We hear a series of pops, running the length of the train...

  On the speedometer... Stopped at 221 MPH.  The Engineer 
  pushes the brakes harder, but the speed stays the same.

  The air suddenly goes out of the room, as it dawns on 
  everyone the trouble they re in.  McNamara s face goes white.

                                CHANCE
                I think they have a name for the kind of 
                train this just turned into...

                              TOM
                There must be a way to stop it.

                                STEPHANIE
                There isn t.  But there may be a way to 
                stop part of it...
                      (beat)
                There s a supplemental braking system in 
                the rear car.  It s too weak to slow the 
                whole train at this speed, but if we 
                separate the rear car, we can slow it 
                down enough to take the curve safely.

  A few people look to McNamara for his approval, but he s too 
  shocked to respond.

                                CHANCE
                How far?

  Stephanie checks a display on the console.

  Guerrero enters, a sense of urgency about him.  He goes 
  straight to the computer.

                              WINSTON
                Find something?

                              GUERRERO
                Do you still have the call logs from the 
                client s cell phone?

                              WINSTON
                Yeah.

                Please read me back the dates and times 
                of the incoming calls from Mark Hoffer.

  A beat, before Guerrero pushes back from the computer.

                              GUERRERO
                I think I know who hired the hit on 
                  Stephanie Dobbs.

  Off Winston--

  INT. MONTEREY ONE - 2ND-TO-LAST CAR - DAY

  The penultimate car in the train.  Passengers are still 
  shuffling into the rear car, soon to be their lifeboat.

  Stephanie has an access panel open in the bulkhead--

                                STEPHANIE
                The system isn t online.  We ll have to 
                cut the hydraulics manually from here to 
                cut the last car loose.

                                CHANCE
                Four minutes.  Is there time?

                                STEPHANIE
                We re fine.  Once the hoses are 
                  disconnected, there ll be about a 20 
                second delay before the cars separate.

                              TOM
                Why don t you let somebody else do that?

                                STEPHANIE
                I know the guts of this thing better than 
                anyone.  

  James looks a little distressed.  She smiles warmly for him.

                                STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                It s ok.  I ll be ok.  Go...

  James, Tom and everyone else clear out into the rear-car.  
  Just Chance and Stephanie remain.  She s shoulder deep in the 
  access panel, feeling around as she disconnects the hoses.

                                CHANCE
                Sorry.

                                STEPHANIE
                For what?

  Chance glances around.  The train.  Her baby.

                                CHANCE
                Figured somebody should say it.

                                STEPHANIE
                At least I know what I ll be doing next 
                Monday.

                                CHANCE
                What s that?

  Chance smiles.

                                STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                I m down to the last connection here.  
                Ready?

  Chance nods.  Stephanie pulls the hose, and we hear MACHINERY 
  SHIFTING under the deck.  Around them, STEAM HISSES FROM 
    CONNECTING HOSES behind the walls...  

  But as Chance and Stephanie get to the door to the rear car, 
  IT WON T BUDGE.  Chance pulls at it.  Nothing.

                                CHANCE
                  I thought you said they don t lock.

                                STEPHANIE
                They don t...

  REVEAL THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, where we see that someone 
  has jammed it shut.

  ON CHANCE as he pulls at the door, trying to work it loose.  
  But as he gives it a pull, he drops to a knee, exhausted.  
  His wounds have finally become unbearable...

  Stephanie pitches in.  But as she tries to work the door 
  loose, A LOUD BANG IS HEARD FROM OUTSIDE, as the flexible 
  cowling covering the short space between the two cars comes 
  undone...  As the rear car separates, and begins recede away--

                                STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                      (small)
                No...

  --Stephanie watches helplessly out the window.  Chance is on 
  the floor, bleeding out.  Off the two of them, stranded...

                                CHANCE
                Two minutes.  Give or take.

  Chance and Stephanie, stranded, time running out...

                                STEPHANIE
                Maybe we can strap ourselves in.  Hope 
                the cars are strong enough to hold 
                  together...

                                CHANCE
                Are they?

  Stephanie s look doesn t inspire much confidence...

                                STEPHANIE
                We re going to die, aren t we?

  Chance looks up at her, and we FLASH AGAIN TO--

  --Chance and the Mystery Woman from before.  Except this 
  time, he s holding her lifeless body...  As fast as it 
  appeared, it s gone, and we RETURN TO SCENE--

  ON CHANCE, the wheels in his head spinning...

                I said I didn t like it, I didn t say I 
                couldn t do it.

  Chance hoists himself off the deck. A look of purpose to him.  

                                STEPHANIE
                What are you trying to figure out?

                Take this...

  Tosses her the utility knife--

                                CHANCE (CONT D)
                  Seatbelts, two of them.  Cut them as

                I m open to alternatives.  I d talk fast 
                though.

  Chance holds out his arms.  Stephanie crosses herself, before 
  getting close to him.  He wraps his arms around her tightly.

                                CHANCE (CONT D)
                Exhale.  Hard.

  Stephanie does.  Chance opens the door behind them, fires the 
  tarp out the back door, holds on to Stephanie with everything 
  he s got--  A moment, before THEY RE BOTH YANKED VIOLENTLY 
  OUT THE BACK DOOR!

  EXT. MONTEREY EXPRESS - DAY

  The tarp expands in the train s backdraft, BECOMING A 
  MAKESHIFT PARACHUTE, drifting up and away from the speeding 
  train, which rockets forward away from them...

  The trip up is the easy part.  As they fall, it becomes clear 
  that this thing ain t a parachute.  A messy, spiralling (but 
      non-life-threatening) drop, before--  

  THEY LAND ROUGHLY in the dirt.  Stephanie s wind is knocked 
  out of her, she heaves for air.  Lifts her head up just in 
  time to watch as--

  THE TRAIN REACHES THE CURVE AHEAD...  The lead car starts 
  around bend, but it can t hold the track...  THE FIRST CAR 
  CAREENS OFF THE RAILS and into a dusty flatland...  THE 
  TRAILING CARS JACK-KNIFE, piling up behind it, and carrying 
  the whole mess thundering forward...  It s the biggest damn 
  wreck you ve ever seen.

  As it finally comes to a rest, things get quiet again...  
  Stephanie notes that Chance never got up from the fall.

                                STEPHANIE
                Hey...  Hey!

  Chance doesn t answer.  Stephanie goes to him, not sure what 
  to do.  Concern turning to panic.

                                STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                Wake up...  Come on...

  Lifeless.  But after a beat, he coughs.  Comes around.

  Stephanie smiles her relief...

  We pull back on a tableau of the two of them...  The smoking 
  hulk of the bullet train off in the near distance...  The 
  SAFE CAR rolling by them, appreciably slowed down, and 
  coasting safely around the curve ahead...

                no shortage of questions in the coming 
                days about how such an accident could--

  The TV is clicked off.  Tom stands looking out the window, 
  lost in his own head.  Clearly on edge.

  A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  Tom goes to answer it.  IT S GUERRERO.

                anyone that she d talked to the reporter 
                about the brakes, you said you hadn t.  
                That wasn t entirely true, was it? 

                              TOM
                No.
                      (beat)
                I told her husband.
                      (to James)
                I told you so you could protect her...  
                And you did this?

                                CHANCE
                      (to James)
                How d you put it together from there?  
                  Suspicious that she d told Tom and kept 
                it from you?  Start digging through her 
                phone like I did?

  On Stephanie, horrified in several different directions...

                                STEPHANIE
                You knew...?  For how long?

  James remains silent.  Just stares back at her.

                                STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                But it was over.  It d been over for a 
                year, I hadn t even talked to him...

                              JAMES
                I know.

                                STEPHANIE
                Then why now?  We were doing better...  
                This whole last year, we ve been better.

  On Chance, as it clicks...

                                CHANCE
                The money...
                      (beat)
                                (MORE)

                                CHANCE (CONT'D)
                If he d done this a year ago, you don t 
                finish the train, and there s no bonus... 
                This way, he gets the money.

  On Stephanie, as that sickening realization hits her.  She s 
  in shock, too horrified to speak.  She looks up at Chance, 
  and they lock eyes, as a tear starts to run down her cheek...

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. JAMES & STEPHANIE S HOME - LATER

  We see the cop siren flashing silently through the window.  
  Lt. Peale is here.  He s just finished cuffing James, when he 
  pulls Chance aside--

                              PEALE
                With all the news about the crash, this 
                place is about to be a mob scene.  Press.  
                Precinct captain.  You got about 5 
                  minutes--

                                CHANCE
                Yeah, I m going.  Thanks.

  Chance exits the house to--

                                                                              CUT TO:

  EXT. JAMES & STEPHANIE S HOME - CONTINUOUS

  --where he sees Stephanie sitting on steps of the front 
  porch, her knees pulled to her chest.  He stands in front of 
  her.  Her eyes stay on the ground as she speaks--

                                STEPHANIE
                I think you were wrong.

                                CHANCE
                About what?

                                STEPHANIE
                      (beat)
                I m responsible for this.  You risked 
                your life for me, and it turns out I 
                deserved what was coming to me...

                                CHANCE
                There are 118 people who are alive 
                tonight because of you.

                                STEPHANIE
                That s not what I m talking about--


                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      60.

    CONTINUED:


                                CHANCE
                I know what you re talking about...

  Chance moves closer to her, and places a hand on her head.  
  It s as intimate a moment as he ll allow himself.

                                CHANCE (CONT D)
                You did something you regret.  We re hard-
                wired to do things we regret.  It ain t 
                gonna change, it ain t something to be 
                afraid of, and it most certainly is not a 
                reason to die.

  Chance lingers.  Doesn t want to leave her.  She doesn t want 
  him to go.

                                STEPHANIE
                I don t even know what I owe you...

                                CHANCE
                      (beat; smiles...)
                You ll buy me a drink someday.

  And he finally turns, walking off towards a waiting car. 

                                STEPHANIE
                Can you at least tell me your name?

  Chance stops walking.  A beat.  Then, defenses down...

                                CHANCE
                Chance.  Christopher Chance.

                                STEPHANIE
                      (beat)
                Is that true?

  Chance gives her a hint of a smile, but no answer.  He turns 
  back towards the car, where Winston is driving, Guerrero s in 
  back.  Chance gets in, and they head off into the night.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

  INT. CHANCE S OFFICE - DAY

  Chance reads the paper.  A piece about a foiled murder-for-
  hire plot that shattered a family.  We get the sense that 
  Chance isn t even reading.  He s just looking at the picture 
  of Stephanie.  It s an old picture, and she s smiling.

  Winston enters, and sits.

                              WINSTON
                I think you should take some time off.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      61.

    CONTINUED:


                                CHANCE
                Imagine my surprise.

                              WINSTON
                I m not joking, mate.  Take some time.  
                Get away from this.

                                CHANCE
                What are you so worried about?  What s 
                  different about right now than anything 
                else I ve ever done?  And don t start 
                with me about how much Stephanie looked 
                like Mary.  That was a low blow.

                              WINSTON
                Do you want to know the truth?

                                CHANCE
                Please.

                              WINSTON
                  I thought that at first.  That maybe you 
                thought that somehow by putting yourself 
                through this, you d be able to finally 
                put Mary in the past.  But now I don t 
                think that s it.

                                CHANCE
                It isn t it.

                              WINSTON
                No, now I m even more worried.  I kept 
                asking myself, why would he keep doing 
                this?  Letting situations get out of hand 
                so he ends up standing in front of one 
                loaded gun after another?  Lydecker, that 
                stunt with the train...  Is it the rush?  
                Is it some kind of penance?  And then it 
                hit me...  Maybe he keeps putting himself 
                in front of the loaded gun because he s 
                hoping one of these days, he ll get what 
                he deserves, and it ll finally go off.

  On Chance, who just looks back evenly at Winston.  Doesn t 
  respond.  Gives nothing away.  The silence is broken by a 
  RINGING PHONE.  Chance answers.

                                CHANCE
                Yeah...  Ok...  Tell me about the threat.

  Winston watches silently as Chance listens, scribbling notes.  
  On Winston, hoping that Chance will hear him...  Hoping he ll 
  put this job away for a while.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)              Human Target - Steinberg   Network Revisions 1/23/09      62.

                      (beat)
                What s my feeling about it?

  He shares a long look with Winston, before--

                                CHANCE (CONT D)
                I m in.  Let s get started...
