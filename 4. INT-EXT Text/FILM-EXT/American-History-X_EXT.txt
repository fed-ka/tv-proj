turns the corner and splashes through a puddle from an
earlier rain. TUPAC SHAKUR blares from inside.
A slight buzz emanates from the power lines and street
lights above the humble VINYARD household. A black FORD
BRONCO rests in the driveway.
TUPAC'S rapping builds. The window-tinted drive-by
slowly heads down the residential street, cruises past
the Bronco in the driveway, and slows to a stop. The
music stops and TWO BLACK MEN spring from the car.
They move with purpose. The larger figure, crowbar in
hand, moves to the truck. The GUN wielding passenger
hurries to the front door and stands guard. Inside the
car, another man methodically waits.
Danny SEES a man reach through the broken window and
unlock the door. He quickly. pans to the idling Trans Am.
THE BLACK GUARD carelessly turns toward the driveway to
see what's taking his partner so long with the wires.
Derek throws open the door and the black man standing
guard wheels and fires a shot into the front door. Derek
buries two bullets in his chest.
DEREK
Fuck you!
The force propels the man six feet backwards.
Stunned by the gunfire, he charges back to the getaway
Tranny. Derek buries a bullet into his shoulder. The
car splits and Derek fires a shot through the side
window. He then walks towards the car and fires shot
after shot at it until it disappears.
From the rain-soaked window he watches Derek face his
wounded prey - crawling on the ground. Sirens sound from
a distance.
STACEY (O.S.)
Get down, Danny! Jesus!
TIGHT ON DANNY. His gaze is locked on his brother from
his bedroom window. Derek cocks his piece, points it and
walks toward the man.
TIGHT ON DEREK'S FACE. Eyes blistering.
FADE TO BLACK:
THREE YEARS LATER
A black man in a suit and tie, ROBERT SWEENEY, goes
through the automatic doors and into the station. He
approaches a DESK SERGEANT. A daily calendar on her desk
reads MONDAY. MARCH 3. 1997.
SWEENEY
Captain Rasmussen?
DESK SERGEANT
Briefing room. Down that hall...third
door on the left.
A YOUNGER DEREK, short haired with no tattoos, stands
next to the reporter. Derek wears a Venice High
Basketball jersey drenched in sweat. Towel around neck,
he thinks to himself as the man speaks into the camera.
REPORTER
To my right I have Lieutenant
Vinyard's oldest son Derek.
(to Derek)
How do you feel about all this, son?
DEREK
How do I feel? How do you think I
feel? It's typical.
REPORTER
Typical how, Derek?
DEREK
Well...look at our country. It's a
haven for criminals. Black...brown...
yellow...whatever.
REPORTER
So you're saying the murder of your
father is "race" related?
DEREK
Every problem in this country is
"race" related. Every problem, not
just crime. These problems are rooted
in the black community, the Hispanic
community, the Asian...every non-
Protestant group in our society.
(then)
Look at the shit. Immigration...
welfare...AIDS...they're all the
problems of the non-white. Look at
the statistics.
REPORTER
Most of these issues you're referring
to though son are related to--
DEREK
(interrupting)
No no no! Don't say poverty right now
cause that's not it. They're not a
product of our fucking environment
either! Minorities don't give two
shits about this country! They're
here to exploit...not embrace.
RASMUSSEN (O.S)
(over reporter's question)
When Alexander got his hands on this
segment...he copied it, sent it out
and it became the Gettysberg Address
for hate groups across the country.
BACK TO THE TELEVISION.
DEREK
Millions of white Europeans came to
this country and flourished within a
generation! A generation! So what
the fuck is wrong with these people?!
REPORTER
What does any of this have to do with
your father?
DEREK
Because my father was doing his
fucking job! Saving a nigger
neighborhood he didn't give two shits
about! And he got killed by some drug
dealer who still collects a fucking
welfare check.
Derek looks at the man and walks over to HIS MOTHER
DORIS, who smokes a cigarette. The camera follows him as
he puts his arm around her and escorts her back inside
their Venice Beach residence. The camera pans back to
the reporter who just stands there, speechless.
PEACEFUL DAY by PENNYWISE blasts from Danny's walkman
headphones. The day is cloudy and overcast but that
doesn't bother the local SURFERS. A twosome paddles
north to get a better break on the next set. Danny
watches as he skateboards down the strand.
His appearance is changed, now resembling a younger,
softer Derek.
Head shaved to a quarter of an inch, he wears a PLAIN
WHITE BACKPACK with punk/white power bands scribbled all
over it. Your standard Sex Pistols, DK, Germs, G.B.M.,
and Adolescents in black. Cro-Magnons and Skrewdriver
off to the left. In red is the largest name, DICK NIXON.
CUT TO:
Kids from all walks of life park their cars, lock their
bikes and head off to class.
Danny throws his SKATEBOARD in, slams the door, and turns
to face LIZZY, a pretty, redheaded freshman.
LIZZY
Hi Danny.
DANNY
Hey Lizzy.
The two smile at one another as the FIRST BELL RINGS.
CUT TO:
Murray walks out and turns back to Sweeney.
MURRAY
Thanks, Bob.
SWEENEY (O.S.)
Okay. Get in here, Dan!
Danny and Murray make hostile eye contact.
DANNY
I knew it was you.
SWEENEY (O.S.)
Shut up and get your ass in here!
A series of intercuts shows activity in and around the
pier. A HOMELESS LATINO MAN searches a trash dumpster.
OPEN VENDORS sell tie-dye and water bong paraphernalia.
A FAT WOMAN walks past eating a hot dog. BLACK GANG
MEMBERS play basketball in their low-rider shorts and
boxers.
TIGHT ON DANNY. He skateboards down the boardwalk,
performing tricks and spinning the board. He eats shit,
recovers, and looks off into the distance.
DANNY (V/O)
People look at me...and they see my
brother. That's how things have gone
since the murder of our father.
From afar, he spots a group of black gang members shoot
hoops. He and Little Henry from earlier exchange a cold
glance.
DANNY (V/O)
Little Henry Hastings and his older
brother Jerome. Jerome's a Shoreline
Crip...Henry's on his way.
Little Henry and older brother JEROME catch their breath
and stare down Dan. Danny doesn't flinch. Jerome sips
from a 40 oz. beer and resumes playing.
DANNY (V/O)
Venice Beach, man. It didn't always
look like this. I mean...our Dad used
to take us down here to run...and it
was cool. Derek fucking owned this
place.
Since then though...the gangs,
man--
TIGHT ON DANNy. He watches the basketball action as he
takes a drag off his Marlboro Red.
DANNY (V/O)
--they've moved west from Inglewood
and South Central and have really
just...taken over. Especially at my
high school. The Venice Locos are big
too but they hang out in bumluck Mar
Vista. It's scary.
(then)
And then there's The Disciples of
Christ. The D.O.C.
Jerome and Little Henry joke and argue with eight extra
players and spectators.
DISSOLVE TO:
DANNY'S POV. The teams are a mixed assemblage of 3
blacks and 2 Latinos and 3 whites and 1 black and 1
Latino. SKINHEAD FAT SETH RYAN, early twenties, and his
two skinhead buddies, can't compete against the better,
predominantly black team. One of the skins, CURTIS, has
a shaved head, a light beard and an M-16 RIFLE tattooed
on his head.
JEROME and LITTLE HENRY sit together to the right of the
court and monitor closely. Danny looks over his left
shoulder and sees Derek and Stacey sit with CAMMERON.
Cowboy hat and BRONCO JERSEY, they sit and converse on
the bleachers.
LAWRENCE
Seven-six. Let's go!
Set some picks!
SETH
Bring it on, boy.
Derek quickly moves his eyes to the court.
LAWRENCE
Boy?
Lawrence quickly pivots past Seth, dunks it, and yells as
he hangs on the rim. The crowd cheers.
SETH
Lucky piece of shit! I'm through
"monkeying" around with your ass!
Lawrence spins around and challenges Seth.
LAWRENCE
Fat, pasty, pale, pastrami eating,
cracker, motherfucker. A hundred
bucks says I make you my bitch.
SETH
(to the crowd)
Here we go! Trying to make ends meet
for that cut in welfare.
He makes a scene and passes Danny on the sideline.
Lawrence waits for Seth to take it further. Danny looks
at him, concerned.
DANNY
It's eight-six, Seth.
SETH
When I want your fucking opinion I'll
ask for it, fuckhead.
(to Derek and Cam)
Help me cover here, guys.
Derek and Cameron stare at Seth, knowing Seth will lose
and embarrass them.
CAMMERON
You got a big fucking mouth, fat kid.
SETH
I'll take this negro down.
DEREK
You can't take a shit, Seth.
Shut up.
Derek shoots a look to Cameron, comes to a decision, and
stands. He shouts for all to hear.
DEREK
I got a bet.
Lawrence stares at him, sensing something harder.
DEREK
I come in, same score now, first one
to eleven. Black boys against the
white boys.
Lawrence looks back to his boys in disbelief.
LAWRENCE
Name your price, Cracker.
DEREK
No money...for the court. We win, you
grab your shit and find a different
place to run. Not just today...
forever. You win, and we don't come
back. No hitching, no fighting, here
in front of everyone. Six-eight, our
ball.
The action around the court gets very still.
Finally,
Lawrence nods.
LAWRENCE
You got a lot of fucking balls, man.
Bring it. Right now.
Derek pulls off his sweatshirt and gives it to Stacey.
Lawrence gets his team together.
CUT TO:
No more mixed assemblage of players.
One team is white,
one team is black.
A SERIES OF SMOTS
Derek blows by Lawrence for a left handed layup. Derek
hits a thirty looter. Curtis grabs a rebound and uses
his elbows to get defenders off him. Big Lawrence fouls
Derek hard and Derek stares at him. Big Lawrence makes a
twenty foot turnaround. Lawrence advances on a three on
two and dunks it. Derek pump fakes three times and uses
the glass for a deuce. Finally, Derek drives the lane
and dishes to Seth at the last minute for a bucket.
SETH
Yes! Ten a piece! Nice fucking dish.
SETH and CURTIS slap Derek's hand as they get back on
transition. Derek stares at Lawrence. CAMMERON watches
intently.
CAMMERON
It's all you, Der!
LAWRENCE
Fuckin' BYU, man!
All right!
All we
need is one now!
Lawrence and Derek lock eyes, a look exceeding
competitive boundary. A look filled with rage.
CAMMERON
Use that fat ass and keep him out,
Seth!
Seth and the opposing player bang to get position
underneath.
LAWRENCE
I ain't losin' in my house!
Clear it
out!
The POWER FORWARD dribbles beautifully up the court --
his teammates clearing out the key. Defensively, Derek
is solid. He tries to pass Derek but Derek's defense is
stifling. Again. With another tricky move, Lawrence
inadvertently puts his LEFT ELBOW into Derek's face,
sending him quickly to the pavement. EVERYBODY STOPS.
CURTIS
That's fuckin' offense!
LAWRENCE
Get the fuck outta here!
He was
movin' his feet!
Derek, teeth bloodied, rises. The two have a stare down.
DEREK
(threateningly)
I'll go if you want to.
LAWRENCE
You wanna piece! Bring it!
Players quickly rush to restrain the two even though the
teams hate each other.
DEREK
If you wanna go...I'm ready.
Don't be
throwin' fuckin' elbows.
LAWRENCE
Fuck you!
Derek walks over to Cammeron, Danny and Stacey standing
courtside. She has a water bottle and a towel waiting
for him. He wipes his BLOODY LIP and takes a sip.
Cameron stares at Derek.
CAMMERON
Hey.
Are you copacetic?
Derek nods and looks at Danny and Stacey.
CAMMERON
He's gonna do that 180 spin move.
DEREK
I know what he's gonna do.
DANNY
You gotta call offense on that shit.
DEREK
Not on point game you don't.
STACEY
Fuck that, D. That chucker can't pull
that shit. It's fucking-
DEREK
Not on point, honey.
He turns back to the court and walks over to Lawrence.
He stands in front of him and checks the ball in.
DEREK
Tens!
Lawrence takes the ball, passes it to the wing, and
quickly gets it back. Lawrence dribbles up top, makes a
marvelous 180 spin with the ball, and pulls up for a ten
foot jumper. Derek reads it perfectly and REJECTS IT.
Lawrence trips to the ground, Derek grabs the ball off
the fast break and DUNKS IT.
DANNY
(amazed by the dunk)
Holy shit!
Everybody courtside goes nuts. Derek walks to the
sideline, ignoring all the hand slaps being offered.
Everyone is riveted on Derek.
SETH
(to the other team)
Get off my
fucking court!
This is my
house!
DANNY
Yeah! Fuck...yeah!
A sweaty Derek pulls his little brother close. He takes
a drink of water, spits out more blood, looks at his
bitter opponent, and says nothing.
CUT TO:
Derek, Danny, Seth, Cammeron, Curtis and Stacey stand
outside the Bronco. The doors are all open and the
stereo softly plays music in the b.g. Derek dries off.
DANNY'S POV. Derek throws a shirt and tie over his
sweaty, tattooed body. Danny watches the tats disappear,
and it's almost like his brother is normal. A name tag
reads LA COPY CENTER - DEREK - ASSISTANT MANAGER.
Derek looks at JEROME and LAWRENCE from afar. Danny
notices the two men stare at his brother, ready to kill.
Derek meets their gaze.
CUT TO:
Danny awakens from his daydream. The black players now
stare at him. Danny puts his board down and skates down
the boardwalk.
DANNY (V/O)
It was only the beginning.
(then)
Derek once told me that minorities
would take America over one day. That
white people are too afraid. Maybe he
was right.
CUT TO:
Danny skates up to the gate and kicks his board up to his
hand.
He passes two SURFBOARDS on his way towards the
back.
LIZZY, the redhaired beauty from earlier, and her blond
friend KAMMI, sturable out and laugh. They're stoned.
KAMMI
Hey! Danny!
DANNY
(smiling)
Hey.
LIZZY
You're going tonight, right?
DANNY
Where?
LIZZY
That party. Go there.
The two young girls giggle and take off.
The three skateboard down the strand, Jason and Chris
with their surfboardS and suits. Chris looks at Jason's
shirt.
CHRIS
What's ZOG again?
JASON
Zionist somethin'.
DANNY
Zionist-Occupational-Government.
Ahead an OLD ASIAN WOMAN tows a succession of SHOPPING
CARTS. As Jason passes, he smacks her with his surfboard
and knocks her to the ground. They all laugh and Danny
breaks off and heads east on Rose.
CUT TO:
Danny skates up to his residence and looks at a car
across the street. Two plainclothes cops from the
earlier meeting sit in their car and stare from afar.
Danny goes through the gate.
iNT. HOUSE- SAME
Danny walks in on the tearful family conclave.
He stands
there, wishing the day would just end.
DANNY
Oh man--! Come on!
What are you
crying about now?
THE PHONE RINGS and Derek rushes down the hall to get it.
DEREK
I got it.
Danny looks to his mother.
DANNY
Are you feeling better at all?
DORIS
I need a kiss.
Danny wipes away her tears, kisses her, and moves away
quickly so he won't get sick.
He looks through the blinds and stares at the UNMARKED
CAR. Danny throws his backpack on the bed and exits.
TIGHT ON DEREK. He listens to the television.
TV ANCROR (O.S.)
Saturday's prison release of a former
skinhead gang leader has many
community leaders up in arms tonight.
Danny walks' towards Derek and they smile and hug.
Davina
and Doris soon join in.
Davina
BLACK WOMAN (V/O)
Derek Vinyard deserved the death
penalty for what he did to that young
man! And now he walks the street as
free as you and I.
DANNY
{to the tv)
What about OJ, bitch!?
Derek looks at the oblivious cops and drops into the
passenger's seat. Seth starts the engine and drives
away. As the truck disappears, we pick up on a WHITE
SOUPED UP JEEP CHEROKEE turning the corner. Tinted
windows, it cruises past the apartment complex.
THE BROAD EXPANSE OF AN EMPTY, DIMLY LIT PARKING LOT. In
the distant corner we see a few parked cars and a group
of skins gathering.
DANNY (V/O)
It was lunacy after he left us. All
the time. Derek believed in
Cammeron...he was angry...that
combination gave them bodies. White
punks...sick of gettin' their asses
kicked by black and mexican gangs at
school.
TIGHT ON DANNY LEANING AGAINST AN ADJACENT CAR.
Seven skins, including Seth and Curtis, smoke and wait.
DANNY'S POV. Danny looks to his left and sees Derek with
Cammeron, who sits in the driver's seat of the BRONCO.
Stacey leans in from the backseat.
STACEY
I hope you kill that fucker.
Derek looks back at her and straight to Cameron.
CAMMERON
He might have a gun.
DEREK
Are you going in or not?
CAMMERON
You know I got the cops on me. If I
come up on one of those cameras I'm a
dead man.
Derek stares at the older man, who appears nervous.
CAMMERON
Somebody needs to drive, Derek.
DEREK
(referring to his mouth)
All right. You can turn it off now.
(back to Stacey)
You're right on his tail, right?
STACEY
(nodding)
I hate that fucking Korean.
I hope
you smash his face in.
DEREK
Just be ready, okay?
She nods and Derek gets out. The group is silent.
DEREK
Come on. Let's pull it together.
Hey! We're not playing fuckin' games
here. Let's go.
The group snaps to attention behind him as Seth toys with
the camera. CURTIS from earlier takes a hit off a joint
and makes Derek wait for him. Derek walks over to the
crazy man, takes the joint, and throws it onto the
ground.
DEREK
What the fuck, Curtis? You a fuckin'
nigger now? Want some crack?
CURTIS
No.
DEREK
(grabbing his neck)
Pull your fucking stupid head out of
your ass then.
CURTIS
Okay. Jesus.
DEREK
(to the group)
We're here tonight cause we got
immigration problems spiralling out of
control. We got Asians up the ass...
taking over our land with their
fucking Yen. Mexicans...flocking into
this place like some giant fucking
Pinata was shattered.
The group busts up. Cammeron watches Derek and smiles.
DEREK
Don't laugh. It's tragic. On the
Statue of Liberty it says "Give me
your tired, your hungry, your poor,
your huddled masses...yearning to be
free." It does not say give me your
shiftless, your greedy, your indolent,
your criminals, looking for a free
ticket.
The group agrees.
DEREK
We're here tonight to show the
government how we feel about
minorities taking over our country.
The treat us like criminals while they
reward them with jobs and fucking
welfare checks. And it's only getting
worse.
ET AL
(nodding)
Fuck yeah it is.
DEREK
Are you ready to do something about
it?
ET AL
Yeah.
DEREK
Okay then.
AND THEY'RE MOVING.
In formation.
Fast.
Directly at
us.
Angry.
As the camera swings into line, TRACKING WITH THEM, Derek
reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a STOCKING
MASK. He pulls it down over his face.
The foot soldiers follow him in unison.
DEREK
(back to his troops)
Remember. No names. Danny?
Stay
right on my fucking ass, man.
And now they're getting ahead of us. As the CAMERA
SWINGS behind them, we see their destination.
They storm the front entrance. The few people who are in
there scream and scramble for cover. Derek grabs a
Mexican boxboy and throws him to the ground. Seth
catches up to another and gets him on the ground.
SETH
Wheto's your fucking green card,
asshole?
Seth kicks the young man in the face with a blatant shot
and continues. DEREK leaves a terrified white woman
alone like she's not even there and pushes over an
adjacent shelf, knocking over another worker with CANS OF
BEANS.
DEREK
(referring to the border)
Can't hide from me, motherfucker!
He kicks the man and looks around the market for more.
Danny watches in awe. Curtis breaks a giant jelly jar
over a head. Another skin throws a BLACK CHECKER into a
shelf of POTATO CHIPS.
DEREK'S POV. He looks up at one of the aisle mirrors.
As the rain falls, we see the Vinyards sitting at the
table. Stacey and Murray Rosenberg, Doris' then
boyfriend who we met earlier, round out the clan. Stacey
sits close to Derek.
DANNY (V/O)
And then came October 4th, 1993.
Murray goes to his car and Doris follows.
Danny watches
from the door.
DORIS
He's a stupid kid, Murray!
I'm sorry!
MURRAY
He's not a kid, Doris. We were kids.
We didn't call people kikes.
DORIS
It's just gonna take some time with
him. What can I do?
MURRAY
You don't know your children, Doris!
You have no clue about the world they
live in. Your son is a terrorist.
DORIS
He's not a terrorist, Murray.
Jesus!
MURRAY
He's a member of the Disciples of
Christ. You remember that grocery
store incident?!
DORIS
Murray?
MURRAY
My sister and her two kids got
evacuated from her Temple in Woodland
Hills!
DORIS
Murray! Please! Derek would never
have anything to do with bombs, okay?!
You don't know him like I do.
MURRAY
And I wouldn't want to. Goodbye.
Murray gets inside and goes down the street.
He hovers over big Lawrence. Gun pointed steadily, he
kicks him in the stomach over and over -- tongue pressed
against teeth.
Hot air flows from Derek's breath and
into the cold.
DEREK
You fucked with the wrong bull.
LAWRENCE
Goddamn, man!
Danny watches his brother from the front porch.
DANNY
Let the cops handle it, Der!
DEREK
Fuck that. The cops will let him
walk.
Derek grabs Lawrence and drags him to the CURB.
DEREK
Ever shoot at firemen, you fuck?
(then)
Open your mouth and put it on the
corner of the curb. I'm gonna teach
you a little lesson.
DANNY
Derek!?
DEREK
Get in the fucking house, Dan!
Danny doesn't move.
LAWRENCE
Come on, man. Call an ambulance.
DEREK
My dad gave me that truck,
motherfucker. Couldn't leave well
enough alone. Put your mouth on the
corner of the fucking curb!
Derek cocks his piece and Lawrence complies--his teeth
now scraping concrete. SIRENS sound from afar. Danny
walks out into the middle of the street to check it out.
DANNY
The cops are comin' Der'
Lawrence mumbles something unintelligible from his
outstretched mouth.
DEREK
What the fuck did you say?
You just
threaten me? Hunh? Hunh? Hunh?
DANNY
(anticipating)
No!
Derek STOMPS his foot on the back of LAWRENCE'S head -
completely tearing his jaw in half on the curb's corner.
DANNY
(crying)
Holy fucking shit!
Derek!
What the
hell was that for?!
Jesus!
The two lock eyes. Derek does not flinch. Helicopter
lights shine on the house. COP CARS SCREECH TO A HALT.
DANNY'S POV. Two cops take cover behind their door, draw
their guns, and shout instructions. Derek puts the gun
down, puts his arms behind his head, and drops to his
knees. His eyes are remorseless.
DANNY (V/O)
Joseph Conrad once wrote that "murder
is always with us. It's almost an
institution." That couldn't rang more
true than with me.
CUT TO:
FIVE PATROL CARS, a FIRE TRUCK, TWO AMBULANCES, and a
throng of terrified NEIGHBORS strangle the front of the
house. Clothed and handcuffed, Derek is escorted from
the house by two uniformed cops and RASMUSSEN.
DANNY (V/O)
Bobby Lawrence died of massive head
trauma early that morning.
Derek marches past the bodies -- which are being tended
to thoroughly.
DANNY (V/O)
Six months after that...Derek was
convicted and sentenced to seven years
for voluntary manslaughter...to be
served at the California State
Penitentiary in Chino.
Rasmussen forces Derek's head down and he gets in the
car. He stares at his brother and sister as police
lights flash on him. Then to Stacey. Finally, to a
lifeless Doris. They lock eyes as the patrol car takes
off down the street.
DANNY (V/O)
Prosecutors wanted murder one for my
brother's torture method...but there
wasn't enough "premeditated" evidence.
CUT TO:
OMIT
A TRUCK sits across the street.
He watches the house. Suddenly, Danny, Chris and Jason
skate up to the residence and follow Seth inside.
DEREK
What the--? Shit.
His face is tattooed with crow's feet and prison ink.
CASSANDRA, a frail, older, English woman with green hair
and multiple piercings, approaches JASON at the keg.
CASSANDRA
You're full of shit!
JASON
If he ain't here, he's comin'.
TIGHT ON CAMMERON ALEXANDEr. The older, white trash skin
furiously bangs his sticks on the drums to the song.
Cam's hair is still long but now he's got a swastika
between his eyebrows like CHARLES MANSON. He wears TROY
AIKMAN'S DALLAS JERSEY and a BLACK COWBOY HAT.
DEREK'S POV. He pans right to check out the crowd. A
man pisses out the window. Then to a distinct woman.
IT'S STACEY. Her head is now completely SHAVED but she's
still gorgeous as ever. Derek indulges her for a few
moments until he turns and walks away.
He bumps into a
girl and knocks her drink.
CASSANDRA
Excuse fuckin' me!
DEREK
Sorry.
She smiles at Derek as the SONG comes to a close.
CASSANDRA
Derek?
DEREK
Cassandra.
CASSANDRA
Oh my God! They said you might be
here but I didn't fucking believe 'em!
CURTIS, the M-16 on the side of his head perfectly
intact, walks by Derek. He walks past Derek with his
young son on his shoulders.
CURTIS
I hope what I heard ain't true, man.
You better hightail it the fuck outta
here if it is.
After a moment, Derek looks away and Curtis heads off.
CASSANDRA
You gotta chop that mop, Der!
Cassandra lights a brown menthol cigarette.
CASSANDRA
(exhaling)
Stacey's meandering around here
somewhere! Have you seen the bitch?!
Derek shakes his head.
DEREK
The only person I've seen is Seth.
CASSANDRA
Oh God.
I'm sorry.
DEREK'S POV. He sees Cameron puts his arm around her
and kiss her. Cameron sticks his hand down the back of
her pants, smiles, pulls it out, and licks his finger.
Derek watches as Danny delivers a beer to Cammeron.
Ca
puts his arm around Dan and they go into the bedroom.
Stacey looks at Derek and follows them.
LIZZY (0. S. )
Are you going in there?
Derek looks down to see Lizzy and Kammi.
LIZZY
Can you tell Danny that Lizzy's
looking for him?
Derek can only stare at the girl's youth.
They SALUTE the band and chant as they tune up for
another set. The singer inquires about his DRUMMER.
Derek pushes his way through and spills a few beers cn
the way. Cassandra smokes a cigarette with a few random
skins as Derek passes by.
RANDOM SKIN
Hey Derek!?
DEREK
What?!
CASSANDRA
(exhaling)
Jesus, Der.
What happened?
CURTIS
(psychotically)
Where's Cammeron, man?!
DEREK
I haven't seen him.
Cassandra looks at him curiously and then focuses her
attention to the bedroom.
STACEY (O/S)
Hey!
Derek turns around and faces her.
DEREK
(pointing his finger)
Stay away from me.
STACEY
Don't point your fucking finger at me.
DEREK
I'm serious, Stacey!
Stay away!
She grabs and pulls on his shirt.
STACEY
What are you gonna do?! Hunh?! Hit
me?! Kick me as I roll on the fuckin'
ground screaming?!
(then)
That bullshit with Cammeron is
nothing, Derek!
DEREK
I don't care.
Stacey looks deep into his eyes and can feel it.
STACEY
Goddamn you, Derek! Those two niggers
deserved what they got. They deserved
to die! And just like Cameron and
Seth and a million others out
there...I'll believe that 'til the day
I fucking die. I will. Nothing will
ever change that either.
Derek breaks from her grasp and walks away.
He looks over to the kegs. Through the sliding glass
window, he sees Seth taking a "tap hit" off the keg. All
the guys in the b.g., INCLUDING DANNY, count and cheer.
Seth sucks the tap while skins count in the background.
Derek walks out and watches Dan pump the keg.
ET AL
Forty-five! Forty-six!
Forty-
seven...!
Seth removes his mouth from the tap and belches like a
pig. All the guys laugh.
SETH
(grabbing Danny)
Why the fuck did you pump it?! I
coulda gone for a minute at least!
Danny looks over and meets eyes with a bloody Derek.
He
FREEZES while everyone turns to look Derek over.
DEREK
Let him go, Seth.
Seth sees blood on Derek's face and shirt and takes a
moment to identify the source. He draws his 9mm Baretta
and points it at Derek's head from four feet away.
SETH
Where's Cameron?
Derek stares directly into the BARREL.
DANNY
(frightened)
Seth, man!? Come on!
Seth puts the gun directly to Derek's cool head.
SETH
I'd be doing America a great fucking
favor, let me tell you.
STACEY
Do it, Seth.
Seth glances at her and Derek quickly GRABS the pistol.
A shot goes off and people hit the deck. Derek wrestles
the pistol away and punches Seth in the STOMACH. Falling
to the ground in pain, Derek cracks him in the face once
more and it's over.
Derek tosses the gun over the fence and looks to Danny.
DEREK
Come with me right now.
He looks at his brother. He then sees Curtis and three
other skins come through the house. Derek stares at Dan
and hauls ass down the back alley.
DANNY'S POV. Curtis arrives and tends to Seth rather
than go after Derek. Confused and mildly embarrassed,
Danny bolts back into the house to get his board.
CUT TO:
Danny passes them on his board as he conguers the cracks
in the street at an incredible rate. He turns the tight
corner and cuts off a turning car. The man yells.
Danny spots his brother walking twenty yards up on the
left-hand side of the street and crosses. Approaching
quickly, he skates faster and faster as Derek nears a BUS
STOP BENCH. Hearing the board, Derek turns to face the
clickity clack behind him.
DANNY LUNGES FROM HIS BOARD AND TACKLES DEREE. The two
crash into the street as a car henks from the inside
lane, barely missing the duo. Danny punches his brozher
in the face.
DANNY
Fucking asshole!
Derek gets on top of his brother, spots a speeding car
heading right for him, and pulls his brother to the
sidewalk. Just in time.
DEREK
What the luck are you thinking!?
DANNY
What are you thinking!? Friends don't
fight friends, Der! They stick
together!
DEREK
They're not friends, Dan!
DANNY
What the hell are they then?!
Derek picks his brother up and sits him on a BUS STOP
BENCH.
DEREK
Just sit there and relax for a second.
DANNY
I don't wanna relax!
You looked like
an idiot back there!
Derek stares and sits next to him. Cars and homeless
randomly pass in the b.g. Danny looks at his brother,
transfixed in thought.
DANNY
What's happened to you, Derek?
TIGHT ON DEREK. He looks into his brother's eyes.
DISSOLVE TO BLACKNESS:
FILING OUT OF THE CELL.
The morning drill. His roommate, an old Latino guy,
right behind. Derek's eyes cast among the inmates,
noting everyone and looking for a friendly face. He
notes a familiar tattoo, catches the guy's eye and nods.
WALKING THROUGH THE CAFETERIA.
Derek with his tray. A sea of tables divided by race. He
spots a tiny island of white guys at a distant table. He
looks at STEVIE THE LEADER, but gets a nod from the HUGE
ARYAN next to him. Derek moves to sit with them.
A WIDE SHOT OF THE YARD.
From a distance, he approaches the Aryan corner. They
casually greet each other. Derek then looks over to the
HUGE ARYAN from the cafeteria and to STEVIE MCCORMICK,
the crazy looking leader. Derek walks over and shakes
their hands.
CUT TO:
DEREK'S POV. He sees Stevie McCormick conferring with a
Mexican gang leader.
The Mexican hands Stevie a joint
through a handshake.
Derek turns and talks to two white guys who seem
impressed. Stevie walks up and takes a hit off his
joint.
STEVIE
I was just talking about you.
You're
Cammeron's boy?
Derek turns and stares at him.
DEREK
His boy? No, I don't think so, man.
I'm not anybody's boy.
STEVIE
Well...you know what I mean.
DEREK
Nooo, I don't know what you mean.
Derek and Stevie lock eyes.
Stevie sneaks a hit and
offers Derek.
STEVIE
Here, man. Relax and have a hit.
Derek stares at him.
DEREK
Nooo...how about you getting that
fucking shit awax from me?
Stevie looks at him, ready to kill. The other two can't
believe Derek's gall. Stevie shrugs.
STEVIE
You got a problem, man?
DEREK
Excuse me? Do I have a problem? No,
I don't have a problem. Do you have a
problem?
STEVIE
No. I don't.
Stevie stares at Derek and walks off. He turns back
again and he and Derek lock eyes. He walks back to his
group.
DEREK
Who the fuck are you?
Derek turns back to the other two and they are already
walking away. Derek looks at the two and back to Stevie.
Stevie sits with HUGE ARYAN and says something to him.
CUT TO:
A group of White Aryans are gathered in the yard. Derek
plays basketball with a mixed assemblage, including
Lamont. Derek continues to look over every now and then
at Stevie and his group. Stevie suddenly smiles towards
Derek.
Not understanding what it's all about, Derek turns
'around. Standing there is HUGE ARYAN and his STOCKY
FRIEND.. They proceed to beat the shit out of Derek right
in the middle of the court. The players circle as Derek
rolls on the ground. He gets bombarded with kicks and
punches, a few even coming from randoms on the court.
CUT TO:
Derek looks over to the white table and they something
amongst themselves. They break into laughter. Derek
thinks about eating somewhere else, but there's nowhere
to go. He walks BACK over to the white table and looks
at STEVIE.
STEVIE
How's your face, man?
Everyone laughs. Derek sits and eats, his tail between
his legs.
STEVIE
That'll teach you.
Don't be a prick
to your superiors.
CUT TO:
Stevie walks by himself and smokes a cigarette. He turns
a corner and standing there waiting for him is DEREK.
Derek stares him down.
STEVIE
What do you want?
DEREK
I'm right here, man. You wanna have
it out with me, let's go. Just me and
you though.
STEVIE
Man...you are a stupid motherfucker.
You know that? When are you--?
Derek cracks him in the face and Stevie falls to the
ground.
DEREK
Stupid?! You have anything else to
say, you little pussy! Hunh?!
STEVIE
Fuck you!
Derek kicks the man a few more times and takes off. A
few black prisoners laugh at Stevie from the PING PONG
TABLE.
CUT TO:
Derek reads by himself on the cement stairs by himself.
A shadow approaches from behind.
VOICE
How you doin', man?
Derek turns his head and sees LAMONT standing there.
DEREK
All right.
(after a beat)
How are you?
LAMONT
I'm fucking incarcerated, man. With a
bunch of faggots. How you think I'm
doin'?
Derek looks at the young man and can't help but laugh.
Derek slowly gets up and limps past Lamont.
LAMONT
What are you gonna do, man?
Derek looks at him for a few moments, still shaken.
DEREK
I'm not going to do anything.
CUT TO:
Danny tearfully stares at his brother, speechless.
DEREK
(after a long beat)
You're my best friend, Danny. You're
my only friend. And I just want
what's best for you.
The two rub heads as DEREK puts his arm around him.
Danny squeezes back and Derek kisses him on the top of
the head.
CUT TO:
Danny skates up to the front gate and looks at them.
COP #1
How the hell...?
Derek slaps the roof on the passenger side and scares the
hell out of the officers.
COP #2
Son of a bitch.
DEREK
Pretty shitty assignment you got.
COP #1
Out of respect for your father.
DEREK
Oh yeah? What the hell do you know-
about my father?
The two men sit there speechless as Derek walks over to
an awaiting Danny.
A white homeless man in an ARMY JACKET sits outside
begging for change. Seth and Cameron, both beat-up,
drunk and bloody, stare at the man.
HOMELESS MAN
Spare change for a cheeseburger?
SETH
Get a job and buy one why don't you.
HOMELESS MAN
God bless you.
SETH
Fuck you.
Seth stumbles into the shop.
Cam stares at the homeless
man, psychotically.
HOMELESS MAN
Fifty cents is all I ask.
Vietnam, man.
I was in
CAMMERON
Really? So you've had what? Thirty
years to get your shit together?
HOMELESS MAN
All I want is something to eat.
CAMMERON
There are plenty of fuckin'
dishwashing jobs out there, Vietnam
boy. Go get yourself one.
In the background, BEN THE OWNER and Seth shake hands.
HOMELESS MAN
Did I do something?
CAMMERON
You're a disgrace to the white race.
If Adolf Hitler was alive...God bless
his soul...he would have you shot.
HOMELESS MAN
Fuck you then. Now and forever.
Fuck
you.
Cameron knees the weaker man square in the face. The
man slopes down to his side, unconscious. As an
afterthought, Cameron kicks him several more times.
CAMMERON
Noooo. Fuck you.
QUICKLY TO ACROSS THE STREET. Little Henry and two of
his friends watch Cammeron's brutality from their bikes.
They turn in the opposite direction and hurry off.
The white vehicle gets passed by cars left and right.
The men close in. Seth and Cam are blind to it.
Jerome
raises the bat as they close in and we--
FADE TO:
Derek plunks a quarter down the slot and removes a copy
of the LA TIMES. Danny continues to skate ahead of him.
Sensing danger, Derek looks back behind him. With no one
in sight, he walks into a doughnut shop.
They are outside the fence surrounding the field.
Students head off to morning class.
DEREK
Hey. Keep your head up, alright?
I'm
going to take care of this.
DANNY
How?
DEREK
I don't know. I'll figure it out
though. You gonna be okay?
DANNY
Yeah.
The two stare at each other as THE BELL RINGS.
DANNY
I gotta turn that paper in.
Danny hops the fence with his backpack on. He looks back
at Derek. Cops #1 and #2 sit in their car in the b.g.
DEREK
Hey.
DANNY
What?
DEREK
Come here.
Derek puts his hand over the fence. Danny walks up and
clasps it -- FINGERS INTERTWINED. Derek wants to say one
thing but something else comes out.
DEREK
I'll see you at home.
Danny smiles at his brother and nods. Danny puts his ear
phones on and heads to class. Derek watches his brother
through the chain-link fence. Danny meets up with Lizzy
and they soon disappear from Derek's sight. Derek turns
and walks down the street.
COP #1
You need a lift anywhere?
DEREK
Nope.
Derek stops in his tracks, walks back over to the fence,
and stares at the school.
