                                          ACT I

      FADE IN:


1INT. HARRIET'S OFFICE - DAY - NEW SCENE1

      HARRIET KORN, sixtyish, sits in her well-appointed office,
      riveted by the CARTOON SHE WATCHES ON TELEVISION.  She's
      also smoking a joint.  

                                        HARRY (V.O.)
                    In theory, the moral of the story
                    comes at the end.  But sometimes...
                    it comes at the top, in the middle...
                    and you just don't get it 'til the
                    end.

      As ROBERT FINEMAN, sixties, enters.  JENNA BACKSTROM,
      thirties, stands at the doorway, we get the sense she
      tried to stop him from charging in.  He walks to the
      TELEVISION, TURNS IT OFF.

                                        HARRY (CONT'D)
                    I was watching that, Robert.

                                        FINEMAN
                    In less than a month, you've gone
                    from being one of the best patent
                    lawyers in all of Cincinnati to a
                    pot-head who sits in her office
                      watching...  What the hell has 
                    happened? 

                                        HARRY
                    Well... what's happened is, after
                      thirty-two years of rather dedicated
                    practice, I've come to the
                      unfortunate if not altogether-
                      surprising conclusion that patent
                    law is as boring as a big bowl of
                    steaming dog -- shut the door, Jenna.

      JENNA does.

                                        HARRY (CONT'D)
                    It's dull, Robert.

                    I lead a dull life with dull
                    partners, I consider you foremost
                    among them, I would sooner look
                    into a mirror and watch my teeth
                    rot than do one more case involving
                    patent law.  As always, I value
                    your feedback.

                                        FINEMAN
                    I'm afraid this is the end, Harry.

                                        HARRY
                    The end of what?

                                        FINEMAN
                    The end of your relationship with
                    this firm.  You're fired.

2EXT. STREET - DAY (COMBO NEW AND FORMER SCENE 5)2

      THE MUSIC CONTINUES, As Harry walks, a look of stunned
        disillusionment on her face.

                                        LOUIS ARMSTRONG
                          (singing)
                    Pardon the smile on my face, my
                    friend/ Dreamin' of reachin' my
                    journey's end/...

                                        HARRY (O.S.)
                    It's certainly been said that every
                    knock is a boost.  

      Suddenly--  WOMP.  A BLACK MAN, age nineteen, lands on
      top of Harry. 

                                        HARRY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Not sure who said it.  

      She's flat on her back, unconscious, as MALCOLM DAVIES,
      nineteen, the falling assailant, a little shockey, rises. 
      There's SOME IMMEDIATE AND ESCALATING PANIC FROM BYSTANDERS
      during--

                                        MALCOLM
                    Oh my God!  Are you alright?  Oh my
                    God. 

      But Harry doesn't move.  

                                        MALCOLM (CONT'D)
                          (screaming)
                    Somebody call an ambulance!  Help! 
                    Somebody call nine-one-one!
                          (then)
                    Help!  Please don't die.  Please
                    don't die.

3EXT. STREET - LATER (FORMERLY SCENE 6)3

      Harry, strapped onto a gurney, head immobilized, is being
      loaded into an ambulance.

4INT. E.R. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY (FORMERLY SCENE 6A)4

      Jenna is there as Harry gets dressed.

                                        JENNA
                    Are you sure you're really okay?

                                        HARRY
                    Doctor says I am.  Nothing broken,
                    no concussion,
                          (noticing)
                    I'm missing a sock.

                                        JENNA
                    You weren't wearing socks.  You
                    don't feel lightheaded even, or
                    maybe delusional?

                                        HARRY
                    I'm telling you, one second I'm
                    walking down the street, the next--

      She stops upon seeing Malcolm at the door--

                                        MALCOLM
                    I'm so sorry.

                                        HARRY
                    Where exactly did you come from?

                                        MALCOLM
                    I'd jumped off the building.  It's...
                    you leap onto awnings and roll off...
                    it's kind of an urban sport thing.
                          (then)
                    I never saw you.

      A beat.

                                        HARRY
                    What's your name, son?

                                        MALCOLM
                    Malcolm.

                                        HARRY
                    You're not being truthful with me, 
                    Malcolm.  Are you?

                                        MALCOLM
                    What do you mean?

                                        HARRY
                    That building is six stories high. 
                    The sport you were playing is called
                    extreme suicide.  You were trying
                    to kill yourself, weren't you,
                    Malcolm?

      Malcolm stares back, busted.  Silence.  Then--

                                        HARRY (CONT'D)
                    Why?

      A beat.  The boy looks visibly undone.  As if about to
      dissolve into tears.  He flees.  OFF Harry:

5EXT. CINCINNATI - DAY - NEW SCENE5

      Harry walks, somewhat purposelessly, THROUGH AN UNLOVED
      NEIGHBORHOOD, AS WE HEAR THE MUSIC.  A PEDESTRIAN BUMPS
      HER SLIGHTLY, innocently, it startles her perhaps more
      than it should.  She gives a quick glance to the sky,
      makes sure nobody's coming from that direction... then,
      as she continues on... she stops... SPIES A SHOE STORE.


                                                                (CONTINUED)      HARRY'S LAW 2j5941 - Pilot - SEVENTH DRAFT 6-17-10        5.


5CONTINUED:5

      BIG SIGN "FOR RENT" IN THE WINDOW. 

      CLOSE ON HARRY.  For whatever reason, she's utterly
      captivated by the place.  A beat.

      RESUME

      HARRY steps off the curb to cross the street.  WOMP. 
      SHE'S SUDDENLY KNOCKED OUT OF FRAME BY A CAR; WE HEAR THE
      SCREECH OF BRAKES AS WE:

      ANGLE: A BMW SIX SERIES CAR

      FISH-TAILING, SCREECHING TO A STOP.  THE DRIVER, ADAM
      STORM, late twenties, LEAPS OUT.

                                        ADAM
                    Oh my God.  Oh my God.

      He runs to A GROUP OF MEN, movers from a moving company,
      CLUSTERED AROUND THE FALLEN HARRY.

                                        ADAM (CONT'D)
                          (to the Men)
                    Is she dead?  Oh my God, is she
                    dead?

7INT. E.R. - LATER7

      Harry with DR. MAX RICHARDS, thirties.  Jenna is present
      again.

                          (to Harry)
                    I don't understand.  How can you
                    not be dead?  Or at least have broken
                    bones.

                                        HARRY
                    I told you.  I landed on a mattress
                    these movers were unloading...

                    But the car struck you.

                                        HARRY
                    Mostly soft tissue.

                          (to the Doctor)
                    She's like a big stuffy.

                                        HARRY
                    There you go, a diagnosis: Big
                    stuffy, can I go now?

                                        DR. RICHARDS
                    Let me first check the X-rays one
                    more time.

      As Dr. Richards exits, he crosses Adam, entering.

                          (to Harry)
                    Are you okay?

                    I'm fine.
                          (to Jenna)
                    This is the man who hit me.  Man-
                      who-hit-me meet Jenna, where's my
                    other shoe?

                                        ADAM
                          (to Harry)
                    Wait a second.  I know you.  You're

                    Like a wart, you hit me on purpose,
                    didn't you?

                    Of course I didn't... you stepped
                    off the curb, and... what were you
                    even doing there?

                                        HARRY
                    I was going to work.

9INT. SHOE STORE, CINCINNATI - DAY (FORMERLY SCENE 14)9

      As Harry unpacks her law books, Jenna enters, observes. 
      The place is unloved, dingy, and there are shoes all over. 
      It's a shoe store.

                                        JENNA
                    Okay.  Okay.  We can make it work. 
                    Needs a little love.

                    Jenna, I can't afford to pay you--

                                        JENNA
                    What's with all the shoes, though?

                                        HARRY
                    Previous tenant.  Got evicted, left
                    all this stuff behind.

                                        JENNA
                          (checking out the
                            shoes)
                    Prada.  Jimmy Choo,--

      Suddenly, the air nearly goes out of Jenna as she picks
      up a particular shoe.

                                        HARRY
                    What's wrong?

                                        JENNA
                          (like it's the holy

                    A white satin stiletto sandal with
                    horsehair and crystal straps.

                                        HARRY
                    Is that good?

                    Is it good, it's--

      She suddenly grabs a different shoe; she's gobsmacked.

                                        JENNA (CONT'D)
                    Gold leather, five-inch woven wicker-

      Harry looks up to see Malcolm.

                    I was trying to kill myself.

                    I'm facing prison.  I got arrested
                    on a drug charge.  Third offense. 
                    I uh... I got a cocaine problem. 
                    I'm working on it but...
                          (a beat)
                    Anyway, I was thinking... everything
                    happens for a reason.  And I figure
                    I landed splat on you 'cause I wasn't
                    meant to die. 
                          (then)
                    Will you represent me?  Please?

                    Harry, you need clients, it's not
                    as if you have any and this...
                          (she's suddenly
                            arrested by another

                    this is a deep blue leather with a

                    But I really do think I fell on you
                    for a reason.  I mean... I suddenly
                    don't wanna die anymore.

                                        HARRY
                    Because you gained perspective,
                      near-death experiences can do that.

                                        TIFFANY
                    Evidently she got fired for smoking
                      marijuana.

                                        ADAM
                      Marijuana?  Medicinal?

                    I don't know.  Then, evidently, as
                    she was walking down the street, a
                    black man did in fact fall on her
                    head.  She was released from the
                    hospital, that's when you hit her. 
                    What are the odds, being hit by
                    both a black man and a car?

                                        ADAM
                    You know the irony?  When I was on
                    that case against her... I loved
                    watching her work, I remember saying
                    to myself, "please let me run into
                    this lady again."  But not with a
                    car.  She's really working in that
                      neighborhood?

                                        TIFFANY
                    That's the rumor.
                          (then)
                    There's a lot of pot in that

                    What the hell are you doing?

      As Malcolm exits--

                                        ADAM
                    I'm temping.  I took a little leave
                    until you land on your feet, least
                    I could do after knocking you off
                    them, I figure two weeks--

                                        HARRY
                    You're not working here.

                    Why not, we can be a team, me and
                    you, you and me, happy together, or
                    however that stupid song went,
                          (to Jenna)
                    I'm not getting coffee, am I?

                                        HARRY
                    Get out.  

                                        ADAM
                    Harriet, come on.  We did click
                    before.

                                        HARRY
                    We did not click.  I didn't like
                    you then, I'm liking you less now.

                                        ADAM
                    You think you can do this alone,
                    maybe you can, but I'd like to help
                    you just the same, the chance--
                          (to Tiffany)
                    maybe you can get Jenna to tell you
                    where the coffee is,
                          (back to Harry)
                    I won't lie, I look at this as an
                      opportunity, the chance to pick
                    your nose for two weeks -- meant to
                    say 'brain' there -- it would be a
                    dream.  I mean, of all the people I
                    could've mowed down with my 
                      performance vehicle,... it was you.  

      A beat, as DAMIEN WINSLOW, African-American, twenties,
      enters.  A little dangerous, but something delicious about
      him, a contagious charmer of sorts. 

                                        DAMIEN

                    My name is Damien Winslow, I'm CEO
                    of Winslow Security, Inc., we provide
                      privatized security to the local
                    merchants in the neighborhood, which
                    is necessary 'cos Cincinnati's Finest
                    aren't too quick to respond
                      sometimes, know what I'm sayin',
                          (to Jenna)
                    'Sup, Sweet,

                    I think you'll find two hundred
                    dollars a month to be very
                      reasonable, are you the manager?

                                        HARRY
                    I am.  And I pass.

                                        DAMIEN
                    Well, I don't think you mean to do
                    that. 

                                        ADAM
                    Look, Bub, can I call you Bub, 'cos
                    I sense a connection.  She passed.

      Damien glares at Adam.  Then--

                                        DAMIEN
                          (to Harry)
                    It's just the merchants who do not
                    engage the services of Winslow
                    Security, Inc., tend to be
                      burglarized, vandalized, plagiarized,
                    etc. etc., know what I'm sayin'?  

                                        HARRY
                    Yes, thank you again, but I've
                    already got protection, so I won't
                    be needing Winslow Security, Inc.

                                        DAMIEN
                    Oh, you got protection, do you, and
                    who that be?

      She opens a drawer, pulls out a Magnum, puts it on the desk.

                                        HARRY
                    It be this.

      A beat.  Adam's eyes bulge a bit.

                    Isn't that funny, 'cos I don't much
                    like you at all. 

      Damien's face goes slightly colder.

                                        HARRY (CONT'D)
                    Tell you what, Damien.  You can
                    smash my windows, beat me up and,
                    God forbid, plagiarize my loved
                    ones, but I'm a lawyer who's used
                    to working with P.I.s, D.A.s, and
                    police, some of 'em honest, others
                    not so much.  I have the means to
                    find out all about you, your mother,
                    your sister, and your wife, should
                    you have them, say hello to my

                    your picture, you got a family, Mr.

                          (a beat)
                    So... Damien.  How should we play this?

      Damien stares back.  Then starts to head off, until--

                                        HARRY (CONT'D)
                    Now here's a deal I will make.  You

                    long as I stay safe, if and when
                    you get arrested -- I'm figuring
                    when -- my law firm will defend you
                    for free.  Isn't that funny?  You
                    walked in here offering to save me. 
                    Turns out, I could be saving you. 
                    Don't you just love how life can
                    take unexpected turns?

      OFF Damien, then Adam, then Harry, we:

12INT. JUDGE WINSTON'S COURTROOM - MORNING (FORMERLY SC. 23)12

      Not yet in session; LOTS OF LAWYERS, CLIENTS, PEOPLE
      MILLING ABOUT.  WE FIND HARRY, with D.A. JOSH PEYTON,
      forties, leaning over the prosecutor's table, rushing
      through some last-second paperwork.  He speaks quickly.

                                        PEYTON

                    I'm not saying let him go without
                      consequences--

                                        PEYTON
                    Yeah, just without jail, lemme tell
                    you, counsel, jail is the only
                      consequence these people understand.

                                        HARRY
                    These people?

                    Yeah, the thing is if he gets any
                    time he'll get expelled from
                      college...

                                        PEYTON

                    It doesn't really sound like you
                    wish you could help me, Mr. Peyton. 
                    In fact, it sounds more like you
                    wish I'd bugger off.  Is that what
                    you really wish?

                    Yeah, well, don't we all, lemme
                    tell you, if you think you're gonna
                    get no time for a three-time loser --
                    not gonna happen, not gonna happen.

                          (almost avuncular)
                    Look.  I'm no expert on criminal
                    law.  But more times than not, trials
                    come down to which lawyer a jury
                    likes more and my feeling is they'll
                    look at me and they'll look at you. 
                    And they'll tumble to something you
                    know all too well and which I'm
                    beginning to suspect.

                                        PEYTON
                    Which is?

                    You're an asshole.

      A beat, as he stares.  And breaks into a thin, sickly
      smile.  Like a cat who's about to swallow a canary.

                    pricey.  And this one I also like. 
                    And it's half the cost.

                    Harry, it's that Damien person, he
                    said something about a shooting, he
                    sounds a little hysterical, he needs
                    you right away.

                                        HARRY
                    That didn't take long.

                                        TIFFANY
                    He's at the Korean Laundromat just
                    two blocks over, the corner of Beacon
                    and Middlesex.

      As Malcolm enters--

                                        HARRY
                    Okay, Adam, Damien's all yours. 

                                        ADAM
                    What? 

                                        HARRY
                    You want to work here, you need a
                    case.  Go.  Malcolm, sit.

                                        JENNA (O.S.)
                          (to Della)
                    I can ring you up.

      REMAINDER ALREADY SHOT AS PART OF FORMER SCENE 28 

                                        HARRY
                    I got nowhere with the D.A.  Which
                    means you got two choices:  Take
                    the deal for one year, or go for
                    jury nullification, which basically
                    is we know he did it, but "wink,
                    wink," we let him go anyway."

                                        MALCOLM
                    Does that work?

                                        HARRY
                    Almost never.  Take the deal.

                                        MALCOLM
                    No.  I want to go for it.

                                        HARRY
                    In which case you could get three
                    years.

                                        MALCOLM
                          (to Harry; weakly)
                    Please.  Look, I know it's a long-
                    shot but...  One year is as bad as
                    three years as far as college... I
                    fell on you for a reason.

                                        HARRY
                    You want some advice?  I'm not sure
                    it's technically legal, but... things
                    rarely happen for a reason.  Most
                    things in life make absolutely no
                    sense.
                          (then)
                    And what makes the least sense of
                    all is for you to roll the dice
                    with some slam-dunk loser--

                                        MALCOLM
                    I'm trying this case.  You bailin,'
                    or you still with me?

      She death-glares him for a beat.

                                        MALCOLM (CONT'D)
                    Thank you.

14EXT. STREET - DAY - NEW SCENE14

      Adam walks briskly toward the Laundromat, realizes there's
      TOTAL CHAOS GOING ON INSIDE; HE CAN EVEN HEAR WAILING.


15INT. LAUNDROMAT - CONTINUOUS - NEW SCENE15

      HYUN KIM, a smallish Korean man, is on the phone, SPEAKING
      hysterical KOREAN AS PANIC ENSUES EVERYWHERE; Damien is
      on his knees, tending to the leg of A WOUNDED MAN, white,
      thirties - BLOOD IS SPURTING EVERYWHERE.  IN THE CORNER,
      A MOTHER SITS HOLDING A TERRIFIED CHILD.  A FEW HYSTERICAL
      WITNESSES ARE SCREAMING WITH PANIC, blood is everywhere.

                                        ADAM

                    I musta hit a vein or something!

                                        ADAM

                    Give me your tie!!

      The Wounded Man wails as Adam rips off his tie.

            Hurry up, man,(to Hyun)
            give it to me!Are you calling...?

      As Adam hands Damien his tie--

                          (re: the wound)

                    Do it, man!!

      As Damien takes his finger out to get hold of the tie,
      BLOOD SPURTS LIKE A GEYSER.


                                                                (CONTINUED)      HARRY'S LAW 2j5941 - Pilot - SEVENTH DRAFT 6-17-10       21.

      Adam gets his finger in the wound as Damien fastens the
      tie, using it as a tourniquet.  BLOOD SHOOTS UP, SPURTS
      ADAM IN THE FACE.

                                        ADAM

      And HYUN SCREAMS BACK AT ADAM IN KOREAN.

      PARAMEDICS are carrying the Wounded Man out on a stretcher;
      Damien is handcuffed.  WE FIND A COUPLE OF OFFICERS with
      Adam, who's still soaked with blood.

                                        ADAM
                    I'm telling you, I was not a witness,
                    I got here after the fact, the only
                    thing I saw was the one in handcuffs
                    saving the life of the wounded guy.

                                        OFFICER MITCHELL
                    And what's your relationship to Mr.
                    Winslow?

                                        ADAM
                    I'm his lawyer, which means I need
                    to be talking to him, not you, excuse
                    me.

      And Adam moves to Damien.

                          (not pleased)

                    Well, you didn't get her.

                    Excuse me, I'm his attorney, gimme

                          (re: the place)
                    Isn't it looking great?

                                        HARRY
                    For a shoe store, maybe.  But this
                    is a law firm.

                                        JENNA
                    There's no reason it can't be both. 
                    Harry's Law and Fine Shoes, it'll
                    be a gold mine, I can feel it.  Are
                    you all set for court?

                                        HARRY
                    Am I all set?  I'm about to try a
                    case with no defense, does that
                    sound all set to you?

                                        JENNA
                    Harriet.  Listen.  Whenever I faced
                    failure as a kid, either in school,
                    or gymnastics, or whatever, my mom
                    had a saying, I'll never forget it. 
                    She'd say to me: "Jenna.  When
                    there's a will, there's a way."

      Harry just holds a look.

                                        HARRY
                    Mom just came up with that, huh?

      And then Adam enters, still a bit blood-soaked.  Tiffany
      throws her hands over her mouth and freezes in horror.

                                        HARRY (CONT'D)
                    Adam!!  What the...

                    I'm okay, this is somebody else's
                    blood, do we have running water?

                                        HARRY
                    My God.  What happened?

                                        ADAM
                    I just had a meeting with the new
                    client.

      Jenna bends over to retch.  Harry simply looks down at
      her left foot.

                                        ADAM (CONT'D)
                    Okay.

                          (mortified)
                    I am so sorry.  Harriet, I'm sorry.

                                        HARRY
                    I'll be needing something in a six
                    if you've got it, Jenna.

                                        JENNA
                    Right.

      Jenna goes to look for shoes, Harry looks back at Adam.

                                        ADAM
                    Damien shot a guy.  He evidently
                    came to the aid of a laundromat-
                    owner he "protects." 

                                        HARRY
                    Was anybody killed?

                                        ADAM
                    No.

      Adam then sees Tiffany is still frozen in horror.

                                        ADAM (CONT'D)
                    Tiff, I'm fine.

                                        HARRY
                    You better make sure that the victim
                    is tested, you've got blood all

                    Okay, guys.  Obviously, this
                      neighborhood isn't entirely safe. 
                    We all have to take a few extra
                    security precautions.
                          (to Adam)
                    Are you sure you're not hurt?

                    I'm sure.

      He looks to see Tiffany is facing the wall, hands covering
      her face, cowering.  He goes to her.

                    Look at me.

                    Tiffany.  Turn around.

      She does; she's trembling with horror.

      JUDGE RONALD WINSTON, sixties, presides as Peyton questions
      OFFICER BYRON TATE.  CASSIE DAVIES, forties, sits with
      Jenna.

                                        OFFICER TATE
                    I was working undercover, presenting
                    myself as a drug dealer, I was
                      approached by the defendant, he
                    expressed his interest in purchasing
                    cocaine, a transaction ensued, we
                    then placed the suspect under arrest.

                                        PEYTON
                    He gave you money?

                                        OFFICER TATE
                    He did?  

                                        PEYTON
                    And, Officer, you're certain that
                    the man who purchased the cocaine,
                    the man who gave you money for the
                    cocaine, is the man seated right
                    there, that man, this man, that
                    man.

                                        OFFICER TATE
                    Positive.

                                        PEYTON
                    Thank you.  I have nothing further,
                    nothing further.

      He sits.  A beat.  Harry rises.  

                                        HARRY
                    Okay.  I guess we're all clear then
                    that this is the man who purchased
                    the cocaine, the man seated right
                    there, that man, this man, that
                    man.

                    that, no call.

                                        JUDGE WINSTON
                    I'll sustain it.  

                                        HARRY
                    Sorry.  This is my very first
                    criminal trial, so I'm bound to get
                    a few things wrong.   
                          (then)
                    Officer, speaking as a citizen, I
                    should start by saying thank you
                    for all the good work you do.  I
                    remember once I got a flat tire in
                    a very bad neighborhood and I thought
                    I might even get killed.  A policeman
                    came along, changed my tire, and I
                    remain convinced he could've possibly
                    saved my life.

      Peyton knows what she's doing, and he won't have it.

                                        PEYTON
                          (rising)
                    I'd like to echo defense counsel's
                    gratitude and point out that police
                    officers in this city and nationwide
                    save thousands of innocent lives,
                    you all face an endless tide,
                      especially when it comes to the
                    evil toll drugs take on this country,
                    thank you, Officer, I too salute
                    your efforts in fighting that
                    scourge, well done, well done, bravo.

      And he sits.  The Judge smiles, rolls his eyes.  Harriet
      just deadpans at Peyton.  Then--

                                        HARRY
                    Tell me, Officer, I read a lot in
                    the papers these days --  how the
                    police budgets have been cut and
                    there have been layoffs and how the
                      department is undermanned.  Is that
                    true?

                                        OFFICER TATE
                    It is.

                                        HARRY
                    Well, I'm a little curious... with
                      everything on your plate, are you
                    really targeting non-violent drug
                    users?  I can understand dealers
                    maybe, but...


                                                                (CONTINUED)      HARRY'S LAW 2j5941 - Pilot - SEVENTH DRAFT 6-17-10       28.


18CONTINUED: (2)18

                                        OFFICER TATE
                    We actually are targeting the
                    dealers, I was doing so that night,
                    we arrest users in the hope they'll
                    flip their suppliers.

                                        HARRY
                    Aah.  So Malcolm... he's not really
                    the guy you're after then?

                                        PEYTON
                      Objection.  The only question before
                    the court is, did the defendant
                    commit the crime with which he is
                    charged, this is not about
                      departmental policy.  Not about
                    that, not about that.

                                        JUDGE WINSTON
                    I'll sustain it.

                                        HARRY
                    Well,  I'm just saying... isn't it
                    a little silly... these jurors all
                    have to be here, away from their
                    jobs, their families, you're here
                    at the taxpayer's expense, as is
                    the judge, all for a trial, where
                    this isn't even the guy you all are
                    really after.

                    kid is being used like a pawn to
                    get somebody else?

                    No, man.  If I plead, I go to jail.

                                        ADAM
                    Why are all you criminals so jail-
                    averse, isn't that like a cost of
                    doing business, you pick a career,
                    it's jail-here-I-come, isn't that
                    how--

                                        DAMIEN
                    Hey!

                                        ADAM
                    You shot a guy. 

                                        DAMIEN
                    In self-defense!  In defense of a
                    client,--

                                        ADAM
                    Even if I could sell that, your gun
                    wasn't registered, you didn't have
                    a carry permit, not to mention your
                      enterprise itself is--

                                        DAMIEN
                    What kind of lawyer are you, man?

                                        ADAM
                      A pragmatic one. 
                          (signing sign-language)
                    You.  Shot.  A.  Guy.

                                        DAMIEN
                          (impassioned)
                    And if I hadn't, that guy woulda
                    robbed that store, he mighta killed
                    innocent people, are you telling me
                    that don't count for something? 

                                        ADAM
                    Look--

                          (impassioned)
                    No, you look.  Your problem is you
                    see me as a criminal and only a
                    criminal.  You see my business as
                    like some terrible extortion thing,
                    can't you make room for the
                      possibility I do good?

                                        DAMIEN (CONT'D)
                    I help people, dammit!  I got in
                    this to protect, not to steal, the
                    people I serve are grateful, ask
                    them!  I help all of them.  And
                    right now... I need you to help me.

      Adam stares back, startled by Damien's emotion.  Touched
      by his passion, even persuaded by it.  A long beat. 
      Finally...

                                        ADAM
                          (quietly)
                    Okay, Damien.  I hear you.  And I
                    get it.  I'll fight the fight.

                                        DAMIEN
                    You will?

                                        ADAM
                    I will.

                    Thank you.  Thank you.
                          (then; fishing)
                    No chance the old lady can...?

                                        ADAM
                    No, she's in trial.

      FADE IN:


21INT. SHOE STORE/LAW OFFICE - NIGHT - NEW SCENE21

      Harry is with Malcolm; Adam is hovered over a computer. 

                                        HARRY
                          (to Malcolm; one last
                            time)
                    So I'll walk you through your
                    life,... talk about how your brothers
                    were into drugs, your father,... 
                    We'll talk about how you were in
                    the drug clinic.  Anything and
                      everything I can do to get the jury
                    to feel for you, sympathize with
                    you.

                                        MALCOLM
                    Okay.

                                        HARRY
                    And then, brace yourself for the
                    cross.  As I said, I'll protect you
                    as best I can.  But... you've seen
                    this D.A., you can count on him to
                    be aggressive.  Just keep your poise. 
                    Stay humble, respectful... well,
                    we've been over it, you know the
                    drill.  Go home, get a good night's
                    rest... jacket and tie, eleven
                    o'clock, don't be late.

                                        MALCOLM
                    Okay.

      As Malcolm exits--  

                                        ADAM
                          (excitedly)
                      "Necessity," there it is -- "may be
                    raised when the defendant is
                    compelled to commit a criminal act" --
                    like when somebody breaks the speed
                    limit to get a person to a hospital,
                    the question is, did the defendant
                    choose the lesser of two evils --
                    which here, Damien did, right, right?

                                        ADAM (CONT'D)
                          (then)
                    But how do I explain him having the
                    gun?

                                        HARRY
                          (to Adam)
                    You could argue "necessity" for
                    that, too.   
                          (off Adam's look)
                    Your client was providing a service
                    in a bad neighborhood where the
                    police either wouldn't or couldn't.

                                        ADAM
                    You think that could actually fly?

                                        HARRY
                    No.  But look.  I've met quite a
                    few D.A.s over the years and they
                    all seem to have one thing in common. 
                      Unmanageable caseloads.  My early
                      impression of you is that you're a
                      tremendous pain in the ass.  Let
                    the D.A. see right off at arraignment
                    that this is going to be a knock-
                    down drag-out fight. 

                                        ADAM
                    Really? 

                                        HARRY
                    Just go off like a cannon.

                                        ADAM
                    At arraignment?

                                        HARRY
                    Why not?  You can't really win this
                    case.  Your best strategy would be
                    to make the D.A. want to get rid of
                    you as much as I do.  Maybe you'll
                    snag a plea bargain.

                                        ADAM
                    But won't I be tipping my hand if I
                    launch into a defense at arraignment?

                                        HARRY
                    What hand?  You haven't got a hand.

                    judge that you'll be a living
                      nightmare.  Can you do that?  I

                    I'm in love with Adam.

                    They're all wrong for him.  I'm

                    I gotta say, Malcolm, as drug addicts
                    go, you seem like such a swell kid,
                    swell kid, and you're the victim,
                    you had no choice but to buy the

                    But there are victims here, aren't
                    there, Malcolm?  See, here's the
                    thing about being a junkie, it's
                      expensive, it costs thousands of
                    dollars a week to get the fix, and
                    the only way most addicts can swing
                    that is by stealing, and whose houses
                    do you think they break into, whose
                    cars get hijacked, whose innocent
                    children get killed in the cross-

                    Did it ever occur to you, Malcolm,
                    that every time you buy cocaine you
                    help fund a billion-dollar illegal
                    drug trade that is bringing this
                    country to its knees, a drug trade
                    that is killing innocent people?

                    I can make this quick.  This isn't
                    about the color of the defendant's
                    skin.  And it isn't about whether
                    drugs should be decriminalized,
                    what laws we should or should not
                    have.  We have to deal with the
                    laws that are on the books today. 
                    It is illegal to buy and use cocaine. 
                    That's the law, the defendant broke
                    it.  He's admitted doing so.  He's
                    offered no defense.  He did it.  No
                    dispute.  Did it.  The only question
                    is, do you abide by your oath to
                    uphold the law, or not?  It's that
                    simple.  It really is.

      And he returns and sits.  Harriet waits... finally rises.

                    But I do know that study after study
                    after study shows that when you
                    take kids like Malcolm and you stick
                    them in jail, you increase the
                      likelihood that they'll remain
                    addicts, wind up homeless or, worst
                    of all, become more-hardened and
                    career criminals.  When it comes to
                    drug abuse, treatment is seven times

                    we're not in the justice business,
                    not really.  Judges and politicians

                    Tiff, it doesn't help when you say
                    that, it's like when somebody says
                    you look tired, it makes you wanna
                    lie down and take a nap, you tell
                    me I don't look okay and I won't
                    feel okay, and I need to feel good
                    about whatever it is that's going
                    to come out of my mouth, alright,
                    which I don't even know what that
                    will be. 

                                        TIFFANY

                    Well, the way this works is we go
                    through a little fact-finding
                    process, the police investigate,
                    you investigate, we do discovery,
                    and then if you want to bring a
                    motion to dismiss--

                    my client walked in on an attempted

                    Trials are expensive, they can

                    poor, forget it, this could cost
                    Damien Winslow his house, if only
                    he had a house, which of course he
                    never will, why, 'cos he's poor and

                                        TIFFANY
                    Adam.  I thought you were brilliant.
                          (admitting)
                    I didn't understand much of what
                    you were saying, but...

                                        ADAM
                    The judge hated me.  Did you see
                    the look on her face?

                                        TIFFANY
                    You got bail.  That's good, right?

                                        ADAM
                    Tiffany.  You don't always have to
                    cheer me up when I suck.

                                        TIFFANY
                    But you didn't suck.  You were really
                    really good.

26INT. JUDGE WINSTON'S COURTROOM - DAY (FORMERLY SCENE 46)26

      All parties present as the FOREWOMAN reads the verdict.

                                        FOREWOMAN
                    In the matter of the State of Ohio
                    vs. Malcolm Davies, on the charge
                    of possession of an illegal
                      controlled substance... we the jury
                    find the defendant Malcolm Davies...

                                        MALCOLM
                          (softly)
                    Please, please, please... 

                                        FOREWOMAN
                    Guilty.

      Malcolm looks numb... almost wobbly.  Cassie drops her
      head.

                                        HARRY
                    I'm sorry, Malcolm.  We knew this
                    was a long-shot.

                                        JUDGE WINSTON
                    Malcolm Davies, you have been found
                    guilty by a jury of your peers of a
                    Class Two felony.  It is the order
                    of this court--

                                        HARRY
                    Wait, wait, wait.  Judge, if you're
                    about to sentence my client, I
                    certainly wish to be heard.

                                        JUDGE WINSTON
                    The defendant is sentenced to two
                    years in State prison,--

                                        HARRY
                    Your Honor--

                                        JUDGE WINSTON
                    --said sentence to be suspended in
                    its entirety, pending Mr. Davies's
                      successful completion of a drug
                      rehabilitation program.


                                                                (CONTINUED)      HARRY'S LAW 2j5941 - Pilot - SEVENTH DRAFT 6-17-10       50.

      As Harry stares back, stunned.

                                        PEYTON
                    Your Honor, this is his third
                    offense.  You kidding me?  You
                    kidding me?

      The judge shoots a glare at Peyton.  Then--

                                        JUDGE WINSTON
                            (continuing)
                    Ms. Korn, check with probation,
                    then your client is free to go.
                          (to Malcolm)
                    Son.  Do not let me down.  We're
                      adjourned.

                                        MALCOLM
                          (to Harry)
                    What... what does it mean?

                                        HARRY
                          (fighting some emotion)
                    No jail.  It means no jail.

                                        MALCOLM
                          (weakly)
                    Really?

                                        HARRY
                    You can't mess up, Malcolm.  He's
                    giving you another chance.  You
                    need to make this work.

                                        MALCOLM
                          (emotional)
                    I will.  I will.

      And Malcolm embraces Harry.

                                        HARRY
                    Alright.  I'm not a hugger.

      And no sooner does Harry break free of Malcolm than Cassie
      engulfs her.

                                        HARRY (CONT'D)
                    Okay.  Okay.

27INT. SHOE STORE/LAW OFFICE - DAY - NEW SCENE27

      Harry sits at her desk, pouring herself a jigger of scotch. 
      Adam, Malcolm, Jenna, and Tiffany are present.

                                        ADAM
                          (to Harry)
                    Explain to me how that could happen,
                    no jail at all.

                                        HARRY
                    Well... as I said to the jury, all
                    I needed was one.  The one I got
                    was the judge.

                                        MALCOLM
                          (to Harry)
                    I still don't know how to thank
                    you.

                                        HARRY
                    I told you how.  You can work your
                    ass off in this office, doing
                    whatever I tell you to do. 
                          (to Adam)
                    How'd you do, by the way?

                                        ADAM
                    Well... we entered a plea of not
                    guilty, judge released him O.R.,
                    D.A. wants to at least talk about a
                    plea, so... who knows.

                                        HARRY
                    Were you any good?

      WE HEAR THE DOOR CLOSE.  There stands Damien.

                                        DAMIEN
                    He was unbelievable.
                          (to Adam; from his
                            depths)
                    Thank you, man.

                                        ADAM
                    Not out of the woods, Damien.  Not
                    by a long shot.

                                        DAMIEN
                    I know.

                    But I just wanted... look, I've
                    been arrested before, had my share
                    of lawyers who... how was it you
                    put it... "fight the fight."  But I
                    ain't never had nobody who ever
                    fought for me like that.  Ever.  I
                    had to come look you in the eye and
                    say that. 
                          (then)
                    Thank you.

      And Damien exits.  A long, silent beat.  Adam is again
      touched by Damien, but he stays stoic.

                    Are you kidding me?  This is the
                    most fun I've ever had.  Yesterday,
                    I stuck my finger in a guy's leg,

                          (off her look)

                    Adam.  Don't be an idiot.  You have

                    The answer is no.

                    I'm gonna just say this.  I never
                    had a mother.  She died during

                    thing for a test-drive and see how
                    it goes.  Every day, I go to work
                    in that big firm.  I sit at my desk
                    and I say to myself, "This ain't
                    it."  "It can't be it."  From the
                    moment I walked into this stupid,
                      run-down... I just knew:  This is

                    was so big.  And later that night,
                    as I slept... a mosquito somehow
                    got into my room, and it bit me
                    right on my pimple... and sucked it
                    dry.  When I woke up, the pimple
                    was gone.  It was like... a mosquito
                    from God.

      They look at her with disbelief, until-- 

                                        TIFFANY
                    That was really beautiful.    

      Upon which, THREE GUYS, twenties, enter; we can see they're
      up to no good.

                                        HARRY
                    Help you gentlemen?

                                        MAN #1
                    Yeah we looking for some shoes. 
                    That okay with you?

      It looks more like they're casing the joint.  Upon which,
      Harry pulls out her Magnum, plops it on her desk.  Adam
      then pulls out his Glock, does the same.  Tiffany pulls
      out her small sub-compact Glock.  Jenna pulls out her
      mini-revolver.  A beat.

                                        MAN #1 (CONT'D)
                          (humbly)
                      Actually... we're looking for a
                    lawyer.  Damien Winslow told us
                    'bout you.  We invented... I dunno,
                    kind of a do-hickey.

                                        HARRY
                      A do-hickey?

                                        MAN #1
                    Yeah, it can open like any car. 
                      Originally for criminal purposes,
                    but Damien said if we got a patent
                    we wouldn't need to be robbin' cars. 
                    It's a door-opener do-hickey.

      A beat.

                                        HARRY
                    Tiffany will take down your
                      information.

                                        TIFFANY
                    Can I get anybody coffee, or tea?

      As Tiffany deals with the men, we CLOSE ON HARRY AND ADAM.

                                        ADAM
                          (big smile)
                    Look at that, three more clients. 
                    You'll have a full caseload by the
                    end of the week.  This is home,
                    Harry.  We're home.

      As LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S "THE HOME FIRE" BEGINS TO DROWN OUT
      THE BANTER, and as the CAMERA PULLS BACK.

                                        TIFFANY
                          (to the Men)
                    One Social Security number per will
                    do.  Actually, you should each only
                    have one.

                                        HARRY
                          (to Adam)
                    You'll need to fill out your time-
                    sheets every day.  And--

                                        ADAM
                      Time-sheets, what, whoa, I never said
                    I'd be working for you.  With you, we'll
                    be partners.

                                        HARRY
                    Like hell we will.  You'll be a
                    junior associate.

                                        ADAM
                    No, no, no, no,--


                                                                (CONTINUED)      HARRY'S LAW 2j5941 - Pilot - SEVENTH DRAFT 6-17-10       56.

                                        HARRY
                    Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,--

                    ADAMHARRY (CONT'D)
              Harriet, life is--or there's the door.
              richer with a
              partner who can
            truly share your
              successes and
              tribulations--

                                        HARRY (CONT'D)
                    I don't want a rich life, and I
                    don't want a partner.  

      As they bicker, THE CAMERA PULLS BACK.

                                        HARRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I guess the moral of this story did
                    come in the middle, as Jenna and
                    Malcolm said, sometimes things do
                    happen for a reason.  You could say
                    that I didn't just get it 'til the
                    end... except this really wasn't
                    the end at all.  For the five of
                    us, this new and ridiculous firm,
                    perhaps even my life... I have a
                    feeling we're only at the beginning.   

      As they bicker away, we are OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN THROUGH
      THE GLASS WINDOW.  STENCILED ON IT IS "HARRIET'S LAW AND
      FINE SHOES."  OFF the banter, the MUSIC, THE WINDOW, we
      finally:

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                          The End
