  CLAIRE pokes her head out of her office, looks at the empty 
  receiving chair, then asks JACLYN --

                                CLAIRE
                Jaclyn, could you let me know when Trevor 
                gets here?   Thanks. 

  Jaclyn looks up from a copy of a romance novel. 

                                JACLYN
                Can t wait to hear the results of your 
                  experiment, huh, Dr. Allen? 

                                CLAIRE
                It is not an experiment.  Not as far as 
                Trevor knows anyway. 
                      (pretty proud of herself)
                I simply suggested he spend a week living 
                like a  mere mortal  -- live an ordinary 
                life:  no  mission,  no matchmaking. 

                                JACLYN
                See how the other half lives? 

                                CLAIRE
                I told him it d make good research.  
                  Meanwhile I ve got him acting like a 
                person for a week...  Therapist rule of 
                thumb:  get the behavior right, the 
                  attitudes will follow. 

                                JACLYN
                Meaning a guy who thinks he s Cupid but 
                acts like a regular guy is --

                                CLAIRE
                Just a regular guy with a dumb nickname. 
                      (off her disappointment)
                I m writing a book about Trevor s 
                  recovery, Jaclyn.  He actually has to 
                recover for me to get past the 
                  introduction.

  AN ODD SERIES OF KNOCKS is heard, presaging... TREVOR S 
  ENTRANCE.  Claire checks her watch. 

                                CLAIRE (cont d)
                Trevor.  Just in time to be ten minutes 
                late...  And? 

  Even through her attitude we can tell, Claire s waiting for 
  news of progress like they were overnight ratings.  But 
  Trevor just looks at her, circles around, holding everything 
  in. 

                                TREVOR
                ... Normal... 
                      (then, a whirlwind)
                Average.  Plain.  Run of the mill.  
                Vanilla.  No sprinkles...  I worked forty 
                hours, I Stair-Mastered, I watched the 
                Thursday night line-up, I went to the 
                  supermarket, forgot the yogurt, went back 
                -- I listened to Hootie... 

                                CLAIRE
                      (anxious)
                And? 

                                TREVOR
                      (beat; then, a whirlwind)
                How do you people live like that? 

                                CLAIRE
                You mean living a normal life. 

                                TREVOR
                I mean living without meaning!   Living 
                bland, canned, non-essential lives!   
                Life without a purpose -- it s like... a 
                car without gas, a balloon without 
                helium, a bra without balloons, cable 
                without nudity, a point without one last 
                  metaphor!

                      (the therapist)
                So, you find it hard to exist without a 
                divine mandate? 

                                TREVOR
                How can anyone be expected to get up in 
                the morning without a raison d  tre?   A 
                higher calling!   A personal quest --

                                CLAIRE
                I get it -- 

                                TREVOR
                      (still going)
                A grand design, a lofty aspiration! 

                                CLAIRE
                  A thesaurus.  Alright, alright. 

                                TREVOR
                Truth is, I should thank you. 

                                CLAIRE
                Really.  Go for it. 

                                TREVOR
                Yeah, your experiment gave me a whole new 
                  appreciation for my punishment.  Now if 
                the other gods chucked me down here 
                without making me match a hundred couples 
                -- just a couple months of purposeless 
                  purgatory...  Yeesh -- then what? 

  In her head, Claire hears the teensy popping sound of her 
  bubble bursting.  She looks to Jaclyn, then back to Trevor. 

                                CLAIRE
                Then you might never have gotten arrested 
                even once. 

                                TREVOR
                He-heh.  Don t be so sure. 

  Frustrated, Claire heads for her office. 

                                CLAIRE
                I want to hear more about this... 

  She enters, expecting him to follow.  He doesn t. 

                                JACLYN
                I think she wants you to go in with her. 

                                TREVOR
                      (coy)
                I don t say yes to every girl that 
                invites me on her couch. 

                                JACLYN
                Choosy, are you?  Only go for goddesses? 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)  "Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     4.

                                TREVOR
                I have been known to get sidetracked by 
                the occasional water nymph. 

  Eyebrows arched, Jaclyn sips languidly from her bottle of 
  Evian.  ( Is that so...  ) Missing it, Trevor enters... 


  Claire is already seated, notes opened.  Trevor makes himself 
  as comfortable as possible. 

                                CLAIRE
                Some of us do find meaning in smaller, 
                more reality-based ideals, Trevor.  Work, 
                family, religion, education... 

                                TREVOR
                      (he d rather eat sand)
                All s I can say is, thank god I m a god.  
                To be mortal in this day and age? 

                                CLAIRE
                Things are different now than they,  used 
                to be?  

  Trevor picks up a her name plate, gestures with it. 

                                TREVOR
                Sure.  Back in ancient Greece, people s 
                lives had purpose.  You farmed all day so 
                you could eat.  Now you have these 
                  meaningless, unexplainable jobs -- 
                  consultant, assistant manager, freelancer 
                -- what the hell is a Comptroller anyway? 

   Claire snaps away Trevor s  pointer.  

                                CLAIRE
                  Lifespans have increased.  For the first 
                time in human history there s more to 
                life than simply not dying.  People are 
                just trying to get the most out of life. 

                                TREVOR
                      (standing)
                The most of the least important.  You 
                guys finally figure out how to live 
                longer and how do you use the time?  You 
                eat low-fat foods, you watch more TV, you 
                work harder on stupider jobs, you read 
                Grisham. 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)  "Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     5.

  Trevor s a preacher on his pulpit.  Claire thinks he has a 
  point, but holds her peace. 

                                TREVOR (cont d)
                The ancients spent their lives in fear of 
                losing what little they had.  Your 
                  generation lives in fear of standing out! 
                      (to her window)
                Fear the norm, people!  Surpass! 

  Riding the moment, Trevor storms out, SLAMMING the door 
  behind him.  Claire shudders.  After a moment, Trevor opens 
  the door again, pokes only his head in. 

                                TREVOR (cont d)
                Like that?   Inspirational, huh?   Bet if 
                Morgan Freeman said all that in a movie, 
                half the crowd d get up and start 
                painting or writing novels or something. 

  He looks for validation of his brilliance, doesn t get it. 

                                CLAIRE
                Kind of spoils the effect when you 
                  grandstand. 

                                TREVOR
                      (ponders; then)
                Oh.  Hmm.  Can I do it again? 
                      (before she can say no; fiery)
                 Fear the norm, people!   Surpass!  

  Again, SLAM!  Claire waits for it to open one more time. 

                                JACLYN (O.S.)
                      (calling)
                He left for real this time. 

  Claire readjusts, thinks.  She swivels to face her computer.  
  After a moment she types.  As she does, we see the unfold 
  words form on her screen:   The Search for Cupid:  Chapter 
  Six.   And beneath it:   Old Gods, New World .  

  Pulling back, Claire regards her notion.  With pleasure. 

                                                                            FADE OUT:

                                        ACT ONE

  FADE IN:


  Claire sits at her desk, lights out, concentrating on her 
  computer.  She types. 

                                CLAIRE (V.O.)
                Most delusions, I believe, follow a 
                  principle of escapism.  Trevor Hale s 
                  delusions of being the god Cupid follow 
                that principle utterly.  The question I 
                have wrestled with for these months is:


  Early morning.  A be-jammied Trevor holds a fresh poured mug 
  of coffee, ponders the sorry state of his bead counter. 

                                CLAIRE (V.O.)
                What, exactly, is Trevor so desperately 
                trying to escape?  His life?  His time?  
                His own mortality? 

  Trevor sips, grimaces.  As if answering Claire s question:

                                TREVOR
                ... Bad coffee. 
                      (sips again; RE: beads)
                Bad progress. 

  Displeased, Trevor throws on a throw, and heads for the... 


  where he warms up his coffee and, walking to the staircase 
  with the pot, YELLS --

                                TREVOR
                Champ, coffee? 

                              CHAMP (O.S.)
                In a minute. 

  Trevor smirks.  He loves this.

                Lorna?

  Champ descends.  The man needs a shower.  Long night.

                Just because you re sleeping with the 
                casting director who got you your first 
                national commercial you expect I ll have 
                some wise ass crack to make? 
                      (then)
                Fair guess.  So does the scotch-guard on 
                her casting couch chafe your butt?  When 
                she sends you to auditions does she call 
                up and say,  Best client I ever had -- 
                always willing to go the extra mile. 

  The look on Champ s face says it all:  he s not too happy, or 
  sure, about this arrangement either.  WE HEAR LORNA approach. 

                              CHAMP
                Fine, you got it all out.  Now please try 
                not to embarrass me. 
                      (remembers who he s talking to)
                ... Much. 
                      (remembers who he s talking to)
                ... More than you have to. 

                                TREVOR
                No problem.

                Morning.  Sorry, no time for coffee, I m

                whining for more gritty, yet attractive 
                  late-twenties males.  They ve used up all 
                the Chicago cheesecake, I might have to

                      (re: the beads)
                I have been!   And look, it s pathetic.  
                I hooked up three couples last month 
                alone and see?  Not one of them took. 
                      (to the heavens)
                You so owe me!   Three!   Okay at least 
                two.  Fine, one.  Harry and Julia?  You 
                can t deny me that one! 

                              CHAMP
                Which one? 


  Trevor stands, very still (his feet don t move throughout 
  this scene), before a wall of  English Patient  videos, 
  scouting the area. 

                                CLAIRE (V.O.)
                In his efforts to escape reality, Trevor 
                has devised some rather elegant methods 
                for coupling.  For example, the technique 
                he calls  video pairing. 

  Among the video toads, Trevor spots HARRY -- early 30s, 
  charming Texas stock, the kind who can pull off a bolo tie 
  (although he now wears a T.C.U. sweatshirt).  Trevor points 
  to the  English Patient Wall. 

                                TREVOR
                See it yet? 

                              HARRY
                Never thought it d be my kind of flick.

                What s not to like?  Boy meets girl, boy 
                helps girl cheat on husband, girl croaks 
                in a cave, boy ends up looking like a 
                potato knish. 

                              HARRY
                Breaks your heart. 

                                TREVOR
                Last copy.  You ll love it. 

  Trevor hands him a tape.  Harry takes it, walks on, when a 
  woman walks past Trevor:  JULIA (late 20s, attractive, with 
  well-done but big hair).  WE NOTICE Harry noticing her.  He 
  stops, not too far off, pretending to look at video titles. 

                                TREVOR
                See it yet? 

                              JULIA
                See?  As much as I could through all the 
                cryin .  That movie was like a shot of 
                lemon juice, right in the eyes. 

                                TREVOR
                Think it s time for another shot? 

  Now that you mention it, it is.  She aims for a copy, only... 

                              JULIA
                Oh, none left.  Too bad...  Maybe they 
                rent lemons. 

  Trevor laughs politely as Julia heads for  Foreign.   Harry 
  also moves to leave, but Trevor taps him on the shoulder. 

                                TREVOR
                      (sotto)
                Hey buddy.  Hear that?  The gal you been

                Yeah, so?

                Don t you watch  Profiler ?  Slightly 
                younger, carefully coiffured Southern 
                hair, no ring, no boyfriend trying to 
                convince her to rent  Die Hard,  no hopes 
                but to sit home and watch a long, 
                romantic movie solo.

                      (kidding)
                Aw hell, why don t I just mosey on up n 
                ask her if I should come on over and 
                watch this at her place.

                      (horrified)
                Are you -- people come here, they don t 
                wanna be bothered. 

                                TREVOR
                You think people come here for movies? 
                Are you kidding?  This is where all the 
                other single people are!   And everyone 
                comes here hoping to high heaven that 
                  someone ll do the unthinkable, introduce 
                  themselves, and make it so they never 
                ever have to come here again. 

  Harry looks at Julia, alone by the Fellinis. 

                              HARRY
                You really think it d work?  Intruding 
                like that? 

                                TREVOR
                Saw a lady in half, they call you a cheap 
                magician -- saw a baby in half, they call 
                you a biblical legend...  It s all about 
                context. 
                      (Harry doesn t get it)
                Just give it a shot. 

                                CLAIRE (V.O.)
                It s amazing.  It isn t that strangers 
                don t doubt Trevor... 

  Harry takes a moment to study Trevor s face.  And for that 
  moment we see him as a total stranger might:  an imp 
    promising, if not fun, adventure. 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     11.

                They just listen to him anyway. 

  Harry turns towards Julia.  And takes a step forward towards 
  her.  After a moment a proud Trevor steps aside -- REVEALING 
  A STACK OF  ENGLISH PATIENT  TAPES, about waist high, 
  carefully hidden behind him...  Pretty sneaky, Sis. 


  Trevor s proud of that one. 

                                TREVOR
                  Beautiful!  She comes in, the sultry, 
                aging debutante.  And who spots her but 
                Walker, Texas Lawyer.  They take the bait 
                and hoochie-laka-boom!  Didn t even watch 
                the movie, stayed up all night  talking. 

                              CHAMP
                Good for you. 

                                TREVOR
                Not good for me -- it doesn t get good 
                for me unless a bead moves. 

                              CHAMP
                Is that all it takes? 

  Trying to help Champ simply reaches up and, to Trevor s utter 
  horror, slides three beads over to the good side. 

                              CHAMP (cont d)
                There.  Three up, three down.  You re 
                that much closer to getting out of my 
                life. 

  There is a foreboding moment as we ponder exactly what shade 
  of purple Trevor has just turned.  Oh man, is it fit-time...  
  Trevor dashes over and rights the egregious wrong. 

                                TREVOR
                Wha -- I -- Did you just?  No-no-no-no-no-

  Trevor shuffles to his room mysteriously, giving a troubling 
  Jay Sherman  Achem  sound.  Then threatens with worse...

  Claire sits, scribbling in a pad.  She looks across to 
  Trevor, as he spots a LONELY-LOOKING WOMAN, staring into her 
  drink.

                  Insisting he is from simpler, more

                pressing his services upon complete

                though ultimately their own -- bidding.

  each other, perversely PDA-ing couple you ever did see:  TINA

                hung it proud  til we found him for 
                her...

  Trevor walks upstairs with RICK, from the picture -- 25, 
  athletic, still in the Ikea stage of post-college life.  Rick 
  has with him an awfully cute DOG, COLIN (NOT a poodle!)  
  While RICK plays with the pup throughout, Trevor is very dog-

                Okay Rick, you tried not to give me any 
                details -- duly noted in the sensitive 
                guy statistics.  Now out with it. 

                              RICK
                What do you want?  Hillary s great. 

                                TREVOR
                On a scale of fair to great, or great to 
                  magnificent? 

                              RICK
                How s this:  We ve been on two dates, and 
                  I couldn t sleep after either of them --
                      (before Trevor can spin that)
                And she never even came upstairs. 

  Rick means it, he really digs Hillary.  He rubs Colin s ears 
    affectionately before opening the door to his apartment. 

                                TREVOR
                      (off Colin)
                You really seem to love that... thing.

                              RICK
                Oh yeah.  Colin s my baby. 

                                TREVOR
                Huh...  He a slobber dog? 

                              RICK
                      (kisses him in that dog owner 
                        way)
                What s wrong with a little doggy slobber? 

                                TREVOR
                Not nearly as much as there is with what 
                you re doing. 

                              RICK
                You a cat person?

                Let s just say that on the scale of cat 
                people versus dog people, I m more of a 
                goldfish kinda guy.  More importantly, 
                you and Hillary, so you haven t um... 

  He offers an unthreatening gesture. 

                              RICK
                ... Not yet.  Thinkin  about it though. 

                                TREVOR
                Well thinking won t stain any furniture. 
                      (thinks; remembers a goodie)
                How  bout making her dinner? 

                              RICK
                I think she d be more impressed with food 
                she can eat. 

                                TREVOR
                You miss my point.  Nota benne:  a man 
                invites a woman over for dinner, it s 
                actually code for,  Listen, I m going to 
                try to hump you this evening.  And if the 
                woman agrees, that s code for, 
                   Wonderful, yes I d like that.   Subtext -
                - neat stuff. 

  Rick smiles, digging this idea.  The two enter Rick s place. 


  As at the act s opening, Claire types in a darkened room. 

                                CLAIRE (V.O.)
                  Ironically, though he claims to be from 
                another, more sensible era, Trevor 
                  navigates the romantic byways of this one 
                with... well, Cupid-like alacrity. 

  Claire s typing is interrupted by a PERSISTENT BANGING.  She 
  stands, annoyed, marches to her closet and the source of all 
  noise:  FRANK.  He s hammering, delicately yes, but 
    hammering. 

                                CLAIRE
                I was wondering if you could do that a 
                little louder. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     18.

                      (doesn t even look up)
                Not getting the full effect yet? 

  He starts hammering louder. 

                              FRANK (cont d)
                Better? 

                                CLAIRE
                You know, most carpenters would ve been 
                done by now. 

                              FRANK
                Most carpenters don t charge by the hour. 

  He s kidding -- he charges by the square footage. 

                                CLAIRE
                If you weren t very good at your job... 

                              FRANK
                If I wasn t very good at my job, I 
                wouldn t be doing it. 

  The phone RINGS, interrupting Claire s quip, mid-formulation. 

                                CLAIRE
                Try to keep it a smidge less bangy, okay? 

                              FRANK
                      (a whisper)
                Okay. 

  Claire heads back to her desk, pushes the speaker button and 
  turns back to her computer, expecting to multi-task. 

                                CLAIRE
                Hello. 

                              JOSIE (O.S.)
                Claire, it s Josie.  Have a sec? 

                                CLAIRE
                      (while typing)
                Of course I have a sec.  How many sisters 
                do I have?

                  Technically, two.

                                CLAIRE
                What s up? 

                              JOSIE (O.S.)
                Just some news.  Remember that project 
                Scott and I have been working on? 

                                CLAIRE
                The kitchen?  Did the cabinets come in?  
                If they didn t I know a great carpenter. 

                              JOSIE (O.S.)
                The other project... 
                      (no recollection from Claire)
                Claire, I m pregnant. 

  Claire snaps to full attention.  She picks up the receiver 
  and squeaks, girly with glee. 

                                CLAIRE
                Eeeek!  You are?  Jos, that s wonderful!  
                Ohmigod, when...  Uh-huh?  You ll be huge 
                for Dad s birthday...  Oh, then call me 
                back when you have more time.  Love you. 

  Claire hangs up and gives a smile so wide and proud you could 
  drive a wide and proud truck through it.  She dials on her 
  speaker phone when Frank enters, cleaning his hands. 

                              FRANK
                She s pregnant? 

                                CLAIRE
                Yup. 

                              FRANK
                      (deadpan)
                Eek. 

  Ah, sisterhood.  Frank leaves.  The phone RINGS on speaker.  
  After three or so rings, an ANSWERING MACHINE picks up.  
  Claire is CLEARLY disappointed. 

                              ALEX (FROM PHONE)
                Hi, this is Alex -- I m not going to be 
                near my phone  til Thursday, so leave a 
                message and hope for the best.

  BEEP!

                                CLAIRE
                      (her balloon popped)
                Hi Alex, it s me...  Claire.  I have some 
                news.  Call me when you can. 


  Wearing an apron -- he s produced as fine a dinner as he 
  could muster -- Rick answers the door.  It s Hillary, looking 
  eminently kissable.  The two have very little to say between 
  bites of one another s faces.  Finally, still from the door:

                              HILLARY
                I like your place. 

                              RICK
                It s not much.  All my furniture is 
                either early college or late relative.  
                Just enough for the two of us. 

                              HILLARY
                I didn t know you had a roommate. 

                              RICK
                That s right, you haven t met Colin 
                yet...  C mere boy. 

  The doggy-dog comes charging to the door and up to Hillary. 

                              RICK (cont d)
                Colin, meet Hillary.  We like her. 

  Colin bops all over Hillary.  But Hillary expresses not the 
  complete adoration we d expect, but total fear.  Quickly 
  transformed into a pre-sneeze grimace. 

                              HILLARY
                AH-CHOO!  I didn t know you had a--CHOO!! 

  Rick is speechless.  He wonders if this is funny, and even 
  thinks it is for a moment (just as we do), until he 
    recognizes the exact ramifications that --

                              RICK
                You re allergic? 

                              HILLARY
                      (nodding; and how!)
                Beyond aller -- AH-CHOO! 

  Hillary grabs an inhaler from her purse, inhales.  Oh yeah, 
  this is bad.  She sneezes rapidly, repeatedly through:

                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     21.

                gotta -- CHOO!  I ll call you. 

  She hightails it outta there.  As Rick realizes he s just 
  entered his worst romantic nightmare. 

                                                                            FADE OUT:

  FADE IN:


  Trevor trails Harry again.  Harry looks at the movie titles, 
  trying to avoid conversation. 

                                CLAIRE (V.O.)
                Because he idealizes a pre-industrial 
                age, there are certain problems that 
                Trevor -- his considerable intelligence 
                  notwithstanding -- is simply not equipped 
                to handle. 

                                TREVOR
                C mon, Harry.  I ve got an inside track -- 
                if it was going well, I d know.  What s 
                up with you two? 

                              HARRY
                  Nothing s wrong.  Everything s... fine.  
                Really.  I promise. 

                                TREVOR
                Oh, not too much protesting there.  
                Sorry, I m sensing a whole lotta doth.  

                              HARRY
                      (stops; admits)
                Well, there is kind of a problem. 

                                TREVOR
                Okay.  Problems are my specialty. 

                              HARRY
                      (four shades of purple)
                I m a little old fashioned about these 
                things -- this isn t easy for me to talk 
                about. 

                                TREVOR
                I ll be gentle.  Just tell me. 

  Harry steels himself. 


  Harry and Julia are in bed together, resting, post-coital, 
  pretty pleased.  Southern comfort. 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     23.

                              HARRY (V.O.)
                It started the first time we... uh --

                                TREVOR (V.O.)
                  Wa-booed. 

                              HARRY (V.O.)
                Yeah. 

                              JULIA
                That was... 

                              HARRY
                Yeah. 
                      (then)
                But you didn t... uh... 

                              JULIA
                No.  But don t worry.  I m fine. 

                              HARRY
                      (playful)
                Fine?  Can t leave you fine.  Tell me 
                what you like -- I ll do anything. 

                              JULIA
                Well...  You sure? 

                              HARRY
                  Positive. 

  She leans over, opens a drawer with a distinctive KUKLUNK, 
  takes something out (O.S.)  We only see Harry s expression. 

                              JULIA
                Oh, can you hand me the remote control -- 
                I keep leaving the batteries in there. 

  Harry does, swallowing a lump the size of his pride. 


  Harry absently fingers a copy of  Big Trouble in Little 
  China. 

                              HARRY
                It s been the same every time. 

                                TREVOR
                Every time? 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     24.

                The worst part is when that drawer opens,

                can t do what a little piece of plastic 
                can... 

                                TREVOR
                It s just a toy, Harry.  Like a Furbie. 

                              HARRY
                A real romantic one too.   Thanks, that 
                was a wonderful, tender moment, mind if I 
                plug this in now?  
                      (off Trevor s giggle)
                It s not funny. 

                                TREVOR
                Well, it s kinda funny...  C mon, there 
                are worse problems, right? 

                              HARRY
                Can you imagine what it s like to know 
                that you re not able to pleasure the 
                woman you care about most? 

  Trevor thinks.  That d be a no.  A big fat no. 

                                TREVOR
                Did she say anything?  About why...  the 
                blender? 

  Off that...


  Julia and Harry share the same pillow.  Julia shrugs, as if 
  hearing the question asked.

    CONTINUED:


                              JULIA
                I spent my first marriage liking sex -- 
                not loving it, liking it...  My husband 
                loved it, I liked it.  It made me feel 
                close to him...  Still, with him, with 
                anyone, I never got to that...  that 
                place... 

                              HARRY
                But if I can t take you there... 

  Seeing his unease, Julia wraps herself around him, a blanket 
  of comfort.  She turns his head to face her. 

                              JULIA
                Oh Harry, don t -- it s not your fault.  
                It s just the way I m built... 
                      (trying very hard to lighten 
                        his mood)
                Some women are analogue, I m digital. 

  Julia pulls his mouth to hers; he concedes.  As they kiss... 


  Harry is crushed by the memory.  Trevor feels it. 

                              HARRY
                Used to be I d look at Julia and all I 
                could think about was retiring on a ranch 
                  somewhere and living a long, lazy life 
                with her.  Now I look at her and all I 
                can think about it that buzzing sound. 

  Harry walks off, dejected... 


                                CLAIRE (V.O.)
                While Trevor s problems usually focus on 
                getting couples together, more and more 
                often, his challenge has become keeping 
                couples together despite a very 
                  resistant, very new world. 

  As Claire pokes at a salad lunch, pen in hand, writing those 
  words, Trevor approaches, bringing her a refill.  She sets 
  aside her notes (keeping them out of his line of sight). 

                                TREVOR
                I m tellin  you, there is no reason why 
                that couple shouldn t happily-ever-after. 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     26.

                That s a verb now? 

                                TREVOR
                  Apparently.  But no, modern technology 
                has to go and make a piece of moulding 
                capable of twenty-thousand RPMs more than 
                the human pelvis.  Man, people have 
                gotten so off track. 

                                CLAIRE
                Not off track.  We just have different 
                tracks now. 

                                TREVOR
                This from a woman who s boyfriend lives a 
                thousand miles away and thinks it s okay 
                because they both have e-mail. 

                                CLAIRE
                The sacrifices of a long distance 
                  relationship are simply part of the 
                modern predicament.  And I have to say, I 
                don t mind having the space. 

  He knows she s justifying, but leaves it. 

                                TREVOR
                Yeah, well I ve got one guy who s going 
                to have all the space in the world 
                because of an appliance.  And another 
                because of a dog.  A dog!  Do you know 
                what canines were to the Greeks? 

                                CLAIRE
                      (doesn t wanna think about it)
                Please don t.

                                CLAIRE
                That s actually better than what I 
                thought you were going to say. 

                                TREVOR
                If they weren t pulling carriages, they 
                were walking meat freezers.  Fresh steaks 
                you didn t even have to lug around. 

  Claire tries to interrupt.  But Trevor s on a roll. 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     27.

                 em like family.  You put off having 
                kids, get a puppy and call that intimacy. 

  Trevor pauses, all huffed up.  Claire knows he s not done. 

                                CLAIRE (V.O.)
                For all his insight, Trevor is hardest to 
                reach when he s on a roll --

  The REGULARS are in attendance.  Trevor is on his soap box. 

                                CLAIRE (V.O.)
                Although I must admit, he does force me

  He sneers back.  But all quipping ends and all heads turn to 
  the back of the room when enters... TINA...  Returned from 
  the land of the coupled.  And looking like she s just been 
  orphaned.  Confused gazes follow her as she takes an empty 
  seat.  She s trying to keep it together.

                Tina?  What are you doing here?  Sign

                I know.  I know...

                      (sob)
                Things were going so good.  For the first 
                time in my life, I was really, really 
                happy.  I was sure this was-- you know...  
                And then he cut me off, totally out of 
                the blue. 

                                CLAIRE

                That s the worst part... nothing.  He 
                just said,  I think we should stop seeing 
                each other.   And then he left. 

  This sinks in.  Trevor just went from concerned to confused.

                Yes you do.  The only way to defeat the

                  Unfortunately, when someone s hopes are 
                so high, it s hard for them to tell when 
                they re falling. 

  She sits back, stares at her screen, when a thought occurs to 
  her.  She tries the phone again.  She dials.  Someone picks 
  up, surprising her.

  Hair wet, he is hurriedly packing a briefcase and putting on 
  a clean shirt. 

                              ALEX
                It s me. 

                                CLAIRE
                I was starting to think all the phones in 
                New York were out. 

                              ALEX
                Just stopped in for a shower and change -- 
                work s been nuts.  What s up? 

  We move into a SPLIT SCREEN. 

                                CLAIRE
                      (not so excited now)
                My sister.  She s pregnant. 

                              ALEX
                Oh.  That s swell.  Great. 

                                CLAIRE
                Yeah...  Great. 

                              ALEX
                What?  Claire, what s wrong?  Or did I 
                just ask a dumb question. 

                                CLAIRE
                You didn t even ask me which sister. 

                              ALEX
                Okay, which sister? 
                      (when he gets no response)
                Was that another dumb question?  Look, 
                I m sorry, Claire. 

                                CLAIRE
                So am I.  I m sorry I have to hunt you 
                down just to talk to you.  You re

                soap. 

                              ALEX
                Claire, I -- I m sorry I ve been busy.

                Don t be sorry.  Maybe that s the way 
                it s got to be.  Maybe I should get used 
                to minimizing your role in my life...  
                Good night Alex. 

  Claire hangs up.  (BUT THE SPLIT SCREEN REMAINS AS WE LINGER 
  ON THEIR REACTIONS.)

  Alex sits down on his bed, confused, saddened, guilty.  He 
  scratches his head, reaches for the phone again as... 

  Claire stands, walks.  She s steaming, upset.  But her 
  anguish stops after a long moment, when something on a table 
  catches her eye.  A giftbox.  She opens it as... 

  Alex wavers over whether or not to call Claire back.  After a 
  few false starts he decides he shouldn t, or can t.  He gets 
  out of his chair and leaves.  Yet the SPLIT SCREEN STILL 
  REMAINS, his half fixed on the empty chair as... 

  Claire opens the box.  Inside is a lovely, hand-carved baby 
  rattle -- beautiful, wooden, a gift.  We wouldn t even need 
  to see the attached card (reading:  Eek.  -- F.  ) to know 
  who it s from.  Claire takes this in, and we become aware of 
    a PERSISTENT BANGING coming from somewhere in her house.  She 
  turns her head towards the noise.  And sits.  And smiles. 

                                                                            FADE OUT:

                                      ACT THREE

  FADE IN:


  Trevor and Rick are kamikaze cleaning the place.  Vacuum, 
  dusting, carpet beating -- the works.  Trevor wears a bandana 
  Aunt Jemima style.  They ve been at it all morning. 

                                CLAIRE (V.O.)
                If Hercules cleaned the Augean Stables in 
                the name of penitence, Trevor felt he 
                should at least be able to disinfect an 
                  apartment in the name of love... 

                              RICK
                This is my worst nightmare:  I finally 
                meet the perfect girl and she s allergic 
                to my best friend. 

                                TREVOR
                      (turns off the dust buster)
                Maybe you should find friends with less 
                fur. 

                              RICK
                You ve never had a pet, have you? 

                                TREVOR
                Did know one dog.  Bit of a temperament. 
                      (under his breath)
                  Understandable, he had three heads. 

                              RICK
                I got Colin when I was in my lonely post-
                college social slump.  He kept me company 
                until I got my life together. 

  We look over to a sad-eyed Colin, coping in the corndoned off 
  study.  The doorbell RINGS. 

                                TREVOR
                Thar she blows. 

                              RICK
                Are you sure about... 





                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     37.

                Fret not, I put Hillary on so many things 
                with  ephizene  and  assotate  in it, she 
                should be coated in gelatine and 
                  swallowed. 
                      (eyebrows)
                And if this works out, I suggest you try 
                that one out. 

  Trevor opens the door on Hillary, joins her in... 


  Trevor closes the door behind him. 

                              HILLARY
                I m ready.  A little drowsy, but ready.  
                Is the field decontaminated? 

                                TREVOR
                We ve been kamikaze cleaning all morning.  
                There is no dust, hair, air, allergen or 
                  sneezergen left in that place that I 
                didn t personally rinse out in sudafed. 

                              HILLARY
                I m allergic to sudafed. 
                      (off Trevor s look)
                Kidding, kidding. 

  Trevor takes a deep breath, then opens the door.  They enter.  
  She and Rick exchange looks, very hopeful.  This is important 
  to all of them.

                              RICK
                Well... 

  Hillary breathes.  They wait.  Things look good. 

                              HILLARY
                I think we re okay. 

  Everyone relaxes.  Rick puts an arm around her.  Trevor does 
  a happy dance. 

                                TREVOR
                This is why you listen to momma when she 
                tells you to clean your room! 

                              RICK
                      (suddenly concerned)
                Your eyes, are they tearing? 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     38.


    CONTINUED:


  Hillary checks; they are.  But she really wants this to work.  
  Trevor snaps back from his reverie. 

                              HILLARY
                No.  I m fine.  I think the sepa s 
                kicking in. 

                                TREVOR
                Sure you don t want a quick acupuncture? 

                              HILLARY
                      (sucking it up)
                Really, I think we re okay. 

  Believing her, Rick is momentarily relieved.  But alas, she 
  can t hold it any longer.  Trevor and Rick s face drop as her 
  face contorts again, into that now-familiar pre-sneeze pose. 

                              HILLARY (cont d)
                AH --


  The sound of platter SLAMMING on a countertop takes the place 
  of the  CHOO!   Trevor has followed Allan (who wears a chef s 
  smock) to his place of work: the busy kitchen of a rather 
  fine restaurant.  Allan attempts to assemble ravioli plates 
  while fending off Trevor. 

                                TREVOR
                Your therapist?!  You broke up with your 
                soulmate because your therapist said so! 

                              ALLAN

                of Tina s dreams because some bull-

                              ALLAN
                Overly simplified... yes. 

                                TREVOR
                Allan, but -- you -- a shrink!  A psycho-
                  therapist!  Some masters-level flake! 

  Trevor sulkily picks food off a plate.  Allan sees, hands 
  Trevor the plate and a fork, fixes up a replacement.  (Trevor 
  continues to sample bits of food as the trays wizz by.)

                Dr. Klein s a psychiatrist, he has an MD. 

                                TREVOR
                And he was such a promising young doctor 
                that he turned to the only medical field 
                with less scientific grounding than the 
                Nielsen ratings. 

                              ALLAN
                      (keeping his calm)
                Order up, table nineteen. 

                                TREVOR
                Shrinks didn t even exist until ninety 
                years ago.  You know who people listened 
                to before then?  Their mothers!  Call 
                your mother, see what she says. 

                              ALLAN
                I did, she said,  Listen to your 
                  analyst. 
                      (getting upset)
                I talked to Dr. Klein about this for a 
                long time.  A long time.  And what he 
                said made sense:  I m just not ready yet. 

  That said, Allan walks away, carrying a finished tray to the 
  bussing station.  Trevor calls across the din. 

                                TREVOR
                You are nuts!  Insane.  Maybe I should 
                  recommend a good therapist. 

                              ALLAN
                      (yelling back)
                Very funny.  I m sorry. 

  Trevor is about to counter, then realizes the sad futility.

                Of all the things Trevor does well, and 
                there are many, he never has gotten the

                Not particularly.  You go ahead. 

  Jaclyn opens it, reads, way more excited than Claire. 

                                JACLYN
                 Tired of talking to you on the phone.

  Jaclyn looks like she just finished watching  Love Story.  
  And Claire, her smile could toast a bagel.

  She closes her book. "Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     41.






  Champ and Lorna are at it, headed for the bed.  The clothes 
  left on them fly -- she s mauling him.  Champ is into it for 
  a moment, but then hesitates. 

                              CHAMP
                Hang on a sec. 

                              LORNA
                  Something wrong? 

                              CHAMP
                  Nothing s wrong.  Let s just take a sec.  
                Slow down...  Talk.  We never do that. 

  She sits on the bed, not overly concerned. 

                              LORNA
                Okay.  Let s talk.   Mrs.  Robinson, do 
                you like art? 

  He lies down beside her, languidly, playing it up. 

                              CHAMP
                I m serious. 

                              LORNA
                Okay, fine... 
                      (doesn t think hard about it)
                Let s talk about your career.  Where do 
                you see your career going? 

  Champ lights up, sits up.  He likes this one. 

                              CHAMP
                Now that I ve made a few bucks doing 
                  commercials and cop shows, I m really 
                hoping to get back into theater.  Real 
                theater.  The serious, risky kinda stuff 
                I told myself was the reason I was 
                doing... 

                              LORNA
                  Commercials and cops shows. 

                              CHAMP
                Yeah.  Like that company that s doing 
                 Peer Gynt -- cover to cover.  Same way --

                              LORNA
                Same way the Royal Shakespeare Company 
                did.  I love Ibsen.  You should totally 
                go for that. 

                              CHAMP
                You think? 

                              LORNA
                      (a purr)
                  Absolutely... 

  Their gazes linger, showing some genuine chemistry.  Feeling 
  it, Champ kisses her now.  Lorna stops him, a wise-ass. 

                              LORNA (cont d)
                Wait, I thought we were talking.  We 
                never talk. 

  As his answer, Champ CLICKS OFF THE LIGHT (beside the bed), 
  leaving them in complete darkness. 


  In the same pitch dark, WE HEAR much groping and moaning.  
  (MUSIC:  Again,  JOHN HENRY,  later verse.)

                                LYRICS
                John Henry was hammerin  on de mountain / 
                An  his hammer was strikin  fire / He 
                drove so hard till he broke his po  
                heart/ An  he lied down his hammer an  he 
                died/ Lord, Lord, he lied down his hammer 
                and he died... 

  Suddenly A LIGHT CLICKS ON.  Harry and Julia are sitting up 
  in bed, blanket up to their chests.  They re both out of 
  breath, having just finished a good bout of thrashing.  Harry 
  looks like he s about to get his overnight ratings. 

                              JULIA
                      (warm; enthused)
                Wow.  That was all very... new. 

                              HARRY
                You liked it? 

                              JULIA
                Oh yeah. 

                              HARRY
                Um.  You didn t seem too... 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     43.

                              JULIA
                        (diplomatic)
                Well, no.  Not really. 

                              HARRY
                Not even when I... 

  He modestly gestures something. 

                              JULIA
                ... No... 

                              HARRY
                        (frustrated)
                  Analogue... 

                              JULIA
                Not that I didn t like it.  It was great!  
                Wow. 

                              HARRY
                But not enough. 

  A long moment passes before a resigned Harry reaches over, 
  picks up the remote control.  He clicks it at the TV, but 
  nothing happens. 

                              JULIA
                Oh, sorry.  Let me get the batteries out. 

  Julia reaches over to her bedside table.  We hear the drawer 
  KURTHUNK.  Harry winces.  And the MUSIC STOPS abruptly. 


  Claire is decked out in sleek black crushed velvet.  Lighting 
  the last candle on the table, Claire gives her handiwork a 
  once over.  Perfect.  She slings a dish towel over a 
  shoulder, walks towards her bedroom to Frank, still hammering 
  away (a sound reminiscent of the guitar beat of our version 
  of  John Henry ).  Frank does not look up.  Ever. 

                                CLAIRE
                Um, I have company coming in an hour. 

  Claire has other things on her mind than tact. 

                              FRANK
                I know. 

                                CLAIRE
                Will you...  still be here? 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     44.

                Not likely. 
                      (then, before she turns away)
                You look perfect. 

                                CLAIRE
                      (stopping)
                Excuse me? 

                              FRANK
                In case you were wondering.  You look 
                perfect. 

  That she did not expect.  In a million, billion years.  It 
  changes everything in her. 

                                CLAIRE
                Wu -- thank you...  You don t think I 
                should go with the red one? 

                              FRANK
                Can t wear colors when it s gray outside. 

                                CLAIRE
                      (hadn t noticed)
                Is it...  I mean, gray outside? 

  He slides his hand along the fine panel he was finishing. 

                              FRANK
                Can t fight the weather.  And you can t 
                improve upon perfection. 

  Claire thinks of a million, billion stupid things to say, 
  comes up with:

                                CLAIRE
                Thank you. 

                              FRANK
                What s for dinner? 

                                CLAIRE
                Seared ahi, soy ginger glaze.  And...  
                  something else... with lemongrass. 

                              FRANK
                Pan Asian. 
                      (turns to her, finally)
                Lucky man.

  Again, Claire doesn t have anything to say, though she wishes 
  she did.  Mercifully, the phone RINGS. 

                                CLAIRE
                I have to get that.  The phone.  It s 
                ringing.  Like last time. 

                              FRANK
                  I understand. 

  Claire scampers to the other room, and to the phone. 

                                CLAIRE
                Hi, Alex? 
                      (checks the time)
                Where are you...?  A storm delay? 
                      (her face drops)
                You can still get here by midnight...  
                Well, six hours of travel for five hours 
                  together...  I guess... 
                      (she knows where this is going)
                No, maybe you shouldn t bother then. 
                      (man, is that upper lip stiff)
                  I understand.  Come when you can spend 
                more time.  Maybe next -- oh no, I m 
                okay.  I just made dinner is all...  No, 
                I didn t go out of my way... 

  But Claire looks to her dining room.  Very romantic set up.  
  Candles, crystal, fresh bread.  Sorry bud, she went way out 
  of her way.  Brazil. 

                                CLAIRE (cont d)
                Not at all.  We ll talk tomorrow...  Bye. 

  They hang up.  Claire pauses as the bravado melts like so 
  many popsicles in August.  She wells up.  Until, of all 
  times, Frank chooses now to  Eh-hem  himself known.  She 
  turns. 

                              FRANK
                Sorry to bother you.  But I m done for 
                tonight.  You have yourself a nice 
                evening, Claire. 

  He turns to go.  In a flash, Claire makes a decision; though, 
  if you asked her, I doubt she could explain why she calls:

                                CLAIRE
                Frank?

  Trevor, Rick and Harry sit inauspiciously on the floor 
  between Trevor and Rick s apartments.  They re making their 
  way through a second suitcase of cheap beer.  Commiseration 
  session, guy style.  Rick is nearly passed out off the five 
  empties before him.  (On a stereo dragged into the hall,

                Yup.  Made me feel about this big. 

  He holds his finger two inches apart.  Harry turns, as Trevor 
  wrestles with himself to keep from making the dick joke.

                Just a little bit.

                Get some help. 

  Trevor thinks; he knows exactly what, or who, that means. 


  Forty minutes later and Claire and Frank are seated at the 
  table, quite familiarly, quite closely, mid-conversation.  
  Dinner has been served and eaten. 

                                CLAIRE
                Your family was rather biblical: the 
                eldest brother inherits the family trade. 

                              FRANK
                      (nods)
                But Uncle Aldo knew my brother didn t 
                have hands for it.  Fred has the soul of 
                  a woodsman, but the hands of a tax 
                lawyer. 

                                CLAIRE
                That put you in the shop. 

                              FRANK
                Right where I wanted to be. 

  A pause.  Neither of them are sure they should be as 
  comfortable here as they feel. 

                              FRANK (cont d)
                Thank you for having me join you. 

                                CLAIRE
                Well, ahi doesn t quite keep...

                That was a very sweet gift.  Before.  
                That you left.  Thank you. 

                              FRANK
                My pleasure. 

  And even Frank feels a slight embarrassment for a moment.  He 
  looks to his glass, focuses. 

                              FRANK
                It s a nice wine you picked -- I prefer 
                the Chileans.  When I was sixteen, Freddy 
                was already in college, my Uncle took me 
                to Chile with him for Christmas, he said 
                to see where his wife had been born.  But 
                then he brought me to this winery, a 
                small thing, family owned, in Lontu  
                valley, where they still make all their 
                wine by hand. 
                      (absorbed in the glass, the 
                        wine)
                They pick by hand, carry by hand, press 
                by hand and foot, pour by hand into 
                barrels cut by hand.  To this day.  
                  Marvelous.  The only mechanical process 
                they have is when the trucks come to pick 
                up the bottles...  Seeing that...  I 
                still think that was the whole reason 
                Uncle Aldo took me down there. 

  He sips, appreciating every nuance of flavor. 

                              FRANK (cont d)
                What is it? 

  Frank takes a few walnuts from the centerpiece Claire has set 
  out.  He rolls them around in his hands absently. 

                                CLAIRE
                      (caught staring)
                I -- I d just thought of you as, you 
                know,  man of few words.  
                      (then)
                I ve never been there -- I ve always 
                wanted to go.  I made it to Costa Rica 
                with a boyfriend once, but we went the 
                hotel route. 

                              FRANK
                Nothing wrong with creature comforts.  As 
                long as they still feel like luxuries -- 
                it s when you get too used to them. 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     50.

  From Frank s hands there is a loud CRACK.  The walnuts.  More 
  than ever Claire stares at his hands. 

                                CLAIRE
                You just cracked walnuts, in your hand. 

                              FRANK
                      (no big whoop; he eats one)
                Not hard.  Anyone can do it. 

                                CLAIRE
                Anyone who works with his hands all day.  
                For me, changing the paper in my fax is a 
                workout. 

                              FRANK
                It s not the hand strength, it s the 
                  leverage.  C mere... 

  Frank pulls his chair up beside Claire.  Places two nuts 
  gently in her hand.  Claire is a touch startled at the 
    proximity, the touch. 

                              FRANK (cont d)
                Use the hardness of one shell against the 
                other.  Jujitsu principle. 

                                CLAIRE
                Just squeeze? 

                              FRANK
                Don t squeeze so much as turn. 

  He puts his hand on top of her.  Claire, warming, does as he 
  said.  We expect a crack...  But nothing happens. 

                                CLAIRE
                It s not working. 

                              FRANK
                  I suppose not. 

                                CLAIRE
                  I thought you said anyone could --

  Frank laughs, admitting the ruse: he was just trying to get 
  close.  And it worked.  Claire hesitates, fearful.  We feel 
  her strain to want to do the right thing.  But when she finds 
  she doesn t know what that is, she sets aside the mounting 
  fear and accepts her impulse.  So she leans forward, just a 
  hair.  To where she can smell the lemongrass on Frank s 
  breath. 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     51.

  Seeing them so close, so unmasked, we wonder who will break 
  the tension first.  Claire?  Frank?  Or...

                Thought I d pop in -- matching s gettin  
                a wee wiggy and I could really use some--

  Trevor walks in, sees the two holding hands, near kissing.  
  He d be less surprised if he found midgets flipping pancakes 
  on her sofa. 

                                TREVOR (cont d)

                                        ACT FOUR

  FADE IN:


  Claire jumps up to head Trevor off.  Frank remains at the 
  table, unfazed by the interruption. 

                                CLAIRE (V.O.)
                  Describing the god Cupid, Plato once said 
                that because he is so passionate he  is 
                  constantly in a state between wisdom and 
                  ignorance.   It is my experience that 
                Trevor often favors the latter. 

                                TREVOR
                Oh me, oh my.  I don t even know where to 
                start. 

                                CLAIRE
                Then let me suggest with your exit. 

  Trevor rubs his hands together, preparing to dig into this 
  feast of mockery.  Claire dreads the results. 

                                CLAIRE (cont d)
                Oh, here it comes.  Trevor, just try not 
                to embarrass me.

                ... Much. 
                      (remembers who she s talking 
                        to)
                ... More than you have to. 

                                TREVOR
                Have you been talking to Champ?  Now be 
                polite and introduce me to your date. 

                                CLAIRE
                He s not my date, he s my carpenter.

                  Carpenter...  This some kinda midnight

                        (approaching; to Frank)
                So, Carpenter...  Isn t she a snip too 
                  bourgeois for you?

                I think I have to object to this

                Never did make it through  Das Capital. 

  He sips his wine.

                Did she tell you about her boyfriend?  
                He s got really cool hair.  It won him a

                                CLAIRE
                Okay, it s time to leave. 

                                TREVOR
                Don t go yet, I came here to talk to you. 

                                CLAIRE
                  Surprisingly, what you came here for is 
                not high on my priority list right now. 

                                TREVOR
                Didn t make the cut?  Got bumped for 
                higher end items like sanding, maybe 
                getting a good varnish. 
                      (to Frank)
                She could use a good varnish. 

                              FRANK
                Maybe I should go. 

                                TREVOR
                Wait, I haven t even asked you about your 
                adz.  I bet you got a great one.  A great 
                big adz. 

  Frank leaves, crossing to the bedroom.  Claire fumes. 

                                CLAIRE
                Look what you did. 

                                TREVOR
                Ta da. 

    Exasperated, Claire goes after Frank. 

                                CLAIRE
                Frank, please.  You re an invited guest.  
                Unlike some. 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     54.

                You got a plumber named Phil too? 

  Entering her bedroom, Claire sees Frank has gone.  Trevor 
  pokes his head in -- yup, disappeared. 

                                TREVOR (cont d)
                Whoa... Batman.

                I know, the gall of him.  Didn t even 
                thank you for dinner...  So I interrupted 
                your flirt session. 

                                CLAIRE
                That was not flirting. 

                                TREVOR
                The way you two were were holding hands -- 
                in  Barbarella  that counted as sex. 

                                CLAIRE
                And even if I was flirting, what business 
                do you have telling me not to? 

  Trevor s not quite sure about that.  He comes up with:

                                TREVOR
                What about Alex? 

                                CLAIRE
                What about him?  You re the one who said, 
                   Surpass, surpass! 

                                TREVOR
                Not at the expense of betrayal. 

                                CLAIRE
                Suddenly you re on his side. 

                                TREVOR
                Call it devil s advocate.  Besides, I set 
                you and Alex up -- I have a professional 
                concern. 

                                CLAIRE
                It was just a dinner, Trevor.  One that I 
                made for Alex, but he wasn t here to 
                share. 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     55.

                distance relationship were simply part of 
                the modern predicament. 

  Not happy having her words turned against her, Claire stomps 
  back to the dining table, begins cleaning up.  Trevor re-
  enters behind her.  He s eating a piece of fish he picked up 
  in the kitchen (a new habit).

                This is actually good.

                      (ignores; in his own thoughts)
                I m going out of my mind trying to help 
                these people, but they don t even seem to 
                want it. 

                                CLAIRE
                Not wanting you around.  Hmm... not sure 
                I can identify. 

                                TREVOR
                Used to be everyone wanted love.  Now 
                they say they want it and then run away 
                when it s right there.  And for what?  
                For pets?  Or sex toys, or therapists! 

  Claire puts a stack of empty plates in Trevor s indignance-
    outstretched arms. 

                                CLAIRE
                People have problems, you have to respect 
                that. 

  She walks to the kitchen.  He follows. 

                                TREVOR
                  Problems?  Tuberculosis was a problem!  
                Small pox, the potato famine, the Huns 
                raping your cattle, those were problems!

                                CLAIRE
                What can I tell you?  People often fear 
                having the things they idealize.  

                                TREVOR
                Why d they do that? 

                                CLAIRE
                I don t know.  Maybe because then they d 
                have nothing to look forward to. 

  Trevor plops her plates in the sink, turns to go. 

                                TREVOR
                Yeah, well I wanna go home.  I really do.  
                And I m tired of looking forward to it. 

                                CLAIRE
                What are you going to do? 

                                TREVOR
                Whatever I have to to get there. 

  Claire watches him go. 


                                CLAIRE (V.O.)
                The one thing about Trevor, as much as 
                his persistence is a nuisance, it is also 
                  a marvel. 

  As before, Trevor questions Allan.  Only now he does so with 
    considerable ardor. 

                                TREVOR
                Why aren t you ready? 

                              ALLAN
                What do you mean? 

                                TREVOR
                You said your therapist convinced you to 
                dump Tina because you weren t ready yet.  
                I wanna know why you aren t ready. 

  Allan doesn t want this conversation, he keeps his eyes on 
  his pasta. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     57.


    CONTINUED:


                              ALLAN
                It all comes down to trust.  You can t 
                really be with someone until you trust 
                them.  Enough to tell them everything. 

                                TREVOR
                Is there something you haven t told her? 
                      (Allan nods silently)
                So, you ll tell her.  Whatever it is, 
                you ll tell her, she ll understand, 
                  everyone s happy. 

                              ALLAN
                I wish it were that easy. 

  Allan looks like he could die from shame. 

                                TREVOR
                How bad could it be?  Hidden wife?  Gay?  
                Murder rap?  Terminal illness?  Gay? 

                              ALLAN
                No, it s -- never mind. 

                                TREVOR
                Nuh-uh.  Don t  never mind  me on this.  
                I found you your lady love -- if you know 
                of any reason why you two should not be 
                joined in holy mattress-moaning, speak 
                now. 

  Giving in, Allan flushes, then looks around him to see who s 
    listening.  People are about, so he leans to Trevor, whispers 
  into his ear.  Trevor takes whatever it is in.  And the 
  corners of his angry mouth go wide, wide, wider with glee. 


  Claire is mid-lecture.  Trevor is not yet there. 

                                CLAIRE
                ... As hard as it is, we should welcome 
                change.  No matter how much we revel in 
                the comfort of the status quo, we can t 
                expect anything to stay --

  She stops as Trevor BURSTS into the session. 

                                TREVOR
                Tina.  The principal needs to see you in 
                the hallway.  Now. 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     58.


    CONTINUED:


  Not quite knowing why, Tina stands. 


  Trevor leans in close to Tina. 

                                TREVOR
                Where did you get his face from? 
                      (she doesn t get it)
                When you sketched your perfect man, 
                before the Valentine s dance, you drew 
                Allan.  Where did you get the image. 

  She balks at the question. 

                              TINA
                I -- I made it up. 

                                TREVOR
                Tina, the future of your future depends 
                on you being honest with me.  Honest as 
                in truthful.  Now...
                      (intense)
                How did his face get into your head? 

  After a moment, Tina sets aside her own shame and leans in to 
  Trevor.  She whispers in his ear...  If Trevor s grin denoted 
  the eating of anything specific, that thing would be shit. 

                                                                      SMASH CUT TO:


  In an otherwise empty bar, after due celebration, the 
  single s group bunch sends off an ebullient Tina and Allan.  
  Tina, holding a suitcase, hugs Claire. 

                                CLAIRE
                I m so happy for you two. 

                              TINA
                Thanks Claire.

                Eloping!  Have you ever heard of anything 
                more romantic? 

                                PRISCILLA
                      (sotto; always a bride s maid)
                I once knew a girl who s fianc  actually 
                married her in public.

  Priscilla relents as Trevor gives Tina a lingering hug.  He 
  wears the prideful glow of an expectant mother.  Allan gives 
  Trevor a warm look of understanding. 

                              ALLAN
                Easy there.  That s going to be my wife 
                in a couple hours.

                My baby s all grown up. 
                      (sniffle)
                Say hi to Reno for me. 

                                CLAIRE
                Reno?  I thought it was Vegas. 

                              TINA
                We were gonna go to Vegas, but we wanted 
                to be near Tahoe. 
                      (excited)
                He s taking me skiing. 

                              NICK
                Where no man has gone before... 

  Nick hi-fives whoever will accept.  The happy couple leaves, 
  in a flurry of ad-libbed CHEERS.  Except the moment the door 
  shuts behind them, Priscilla lets her huge scowl show.  As 
  the group bunch heads out the door:

                                PRISCILLA
                I used to like them so much. 

                              VERONICA
                Can t you be happy for her? 

  Priscilla thinks, tries, fails, nods no, shoots the rest of 
  her drink, leaves herself.  Only Claire and Trevor remain. 

                                CLAIRE
                Okay, spill it.  What did you say to him, 
                to make him change his mind? 

                                TREVOR
                ... Nothin . 

  Off Claire s confusion, Trevor, fantastically pleased with 
  himself, produces a videotape.  Pops it into the VCR above 
  the bar, hits play.  

                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     60.

  When we hear (but do NOT see) the telltale signs of a porn -- 
    BOM-CHICKA-WOMP-WOMP music, poorly dubbed moaning, etcetera -- 
  Claire s confusion changes instantly to revulsion.  She 
  covers her eyes. 

                                CLAIRE
                Trevor, what are you -- turn that off! 

                                TREVOR
                Tina had a little collection...  Seems he 
                needed the money to get through college.  
                Couyldn

  Claire starts, as she peeks through her fingers at the 
  screen... and is shocked by the recognition. 

                                CLAIRE
                Allan? 

  Trevor, nodding, smirking, CLAPS his hands clean...

                One down... 


  Trevor KNOCKS LOUDLY THREE TIMES on Rick s door.  Rick 
  answers, hungover, ice pack on his head. 

                                TREVOR
                Still miserable without her? 

  He is, he is.

                How do you feel about visitation rights? 

  Rick ponders that when Lorna passes by behind Trevor, on her 
  way to see Champ. 

                                TREVOR (cont d)
                Oh, hi Lorna.

  Champ is waiting, waiting, waiting in the barber s chair, 
  holding a copy of the Chicago trades, when the door opens.

                      (cold)
                Hi.  Come on in.  Kick off your shoes. 

  Not hearing the tone, she does, with a  Whoop!  Lorna then 
  sidles up beside Champ, places arms and lips upon him.  He 
  doesn t budge; she doesn t notice. 

                              LORNA
                Had the most boring, boring day today.  I 
                spent four hours re-alphabetizing head 
                shots because my gorgeous Portuguese 
                  assistant still hasn t gotten past  L-M-N-
                O  in her English primer.  How s my 
                Champ? 
                      (finally notices his scowl)
                Oh, what s wrong sweetie? 

                              CHAMP
                You sent Chris Templeman in for the part 
                of Peer Gynt.  And he got it. 

                              LORNA
                I know, won t he be great? 

  Champ doesn t think so.  He stands. 

                              CHAMP
                I wanted that part, you knew that.  And 
                you recommended someone else? 

                              LORNA
                      (not liking this)
                Okay, A) the part is excruciatingly long, 
                and you hate delivering any speech longer 
                than six lines.  And B) --

                              CHAMP
                Forget B.  You said I should go for the 
                part. 

                              LORNA
                That doesn t mean I have to put you up 
                for it.  I didn t think you were right. 

  This hurts Champ s feeling, enough that he forgets himself.

  Lorna takes a long moment before answering.  She gets it now.  
  Her flightiness has just flown for good. 

                              LORNA
                You were right for that.  Champ.  And 
                that was the only reason you got it.

                Yes you did...   Get you  the spot.  You 
                thought that s what this was about -- I 
                stuff your resume so long as you stuff 
                me?  I m a modern woman, buddy, but not

                      (grabs her coat)
                You know, and the worst part is, I really 
                liked you. 

  She thinks about getting her shoes, but doesn t want to be 
  there long enough to look for them. 

                              LORNA (cont d)
                Keep the shoes.   You ve earned them. 

  She SLAMS the door behind her.  Champ realizes he s missed a 
  very big point, keeps silent. 


  Trevor tails Harry once more.

                While some elements of the modern world 
                are surmountable, others even Trevor will 
                concede to.  Not that he dwells on it. 

                                TREVOR

                              HARRY
                Not right now thanks.  I m still 
                  recovering -- all I want to do is curl up 
                with a movie and eat my candy and pretend 
                I m not too shallow to date. 
                      (grabs an  English Patient )
                Still haven t seen it. 

                                TREVOR
                Aren t you from back-in-the-saddle 
                country?  We gotta keep at it, find you a 
                new, less electronically dependent woman.  
                A sexual Luddite. 

  Trevor winks big as a FRUMP WITH POTENTIAL walks past. 

                                TREVOR (cont d)
                Hey, what movie you got there? 

    Reluctantly, Harry turns to hear what she ll say. 

                              FRUMP WITH POTENTIAL
                   Laurence of Arabia.   The new DVD just 
                came out.  I ve seen it before, but...  
                ya  just can t beat digital, can you. 

  At that word,  digital,  we see Harry dissolve, melted 
    completely by his memories of Julia s warmth, of her attempts 
  to ease his discomfort.  His expression softens.  He looks to 
  the Woman, then to Trevor.  And makes a decision. 

                              HARRY
                No, you can t.  I m sorry, Trevor, I 
                gotta go. 

                                CLAIRE (V.O.)
                Still, for all his insights, even Trevor 
                is pleasantly surprised sometimes. 

  Trevor and the woman watch Harry leave.  While Trevor is 
  quite pleased, she is confused.  Trevor notices her 
    confusion. 

                                TREVOR
                Sorry about that.  Didn t mean to bother 
                you here...  Not too much anyway.  Thing 
                is, I believe I can help you --

  As we recognize his pitch, Trevor places an arm around her 
  and walks her off.  The spiel unfolds... 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     64.

                See, you look a little lonely.  Truth is 
                you look like a borrowed piece of gum... 


  Claire is pulled out from bed by her own KNOCK at the door. 

                                CLAIRE (V.O.)
                Although you should know, as charmed as 
                Trevor s matches seem to be, not all of 
                them are immune to failure... 

  She opens it revealing...  ALEX.  Claire is stunned.  Throws 
  her arms around him. 

                                CLAIRE
                Alex.  What are you doing here?  Where s 
                your bag? 

                              ALEX
                No bag.  My flight back leaves in an 
                hour. 

                                CLAIRE
                Six hours of travel time for one hour 
                here?  Why? 

                              ALEX
                Because I owe you this conversation.  And 
                I owe it to you to have it in person. 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     65.

  They step inside.

                Now I really wish I d rehearsed 
                  something... 
                      (then)
                I know you were hurt that I didn t come 
                the other night.  That wasn t okay, of 
                me. 

                                CLAIRE
                I m glad you see that. 

                              ALEX
                I do.  And I m sorry... 

  Claire is pleased with this direction so far.  Alex sits, 
  taking the same seat Frank sat in during dinner. 

                              ALEX (cont d)
                I made you some promises that were going 
                to make our being apart work.  I haven t 
                kept them. 

                                CLAIRE
                No, you haven t. 

                              ALEX
                And I don t think I ll get any better at 
                it. 

                                CLAIRE
                This isn t making me feel any better, 
                Alex. 

                              ALEX
                      (stands)
                That s the problem.  I haven t been 
                making you feel any better since I left.  
                Worse, I ve hurt you...  I can t let 
                myself keep doing that. 

                                CLAIRE
                You want -- you want to break up? 

                              ALEX
                No.  Not at all. 
                      (this is very hard for him)
                But I can t hold you back, not when you 
                could be finding someone who could make 
                you happier than I am...  I care about

                From exploring something that might be

                Alex I --

                              ALEX
                Sh...  If you say a word all this bravado 
                will fall apart. 

  Claire manages a smile.  Alex kisses her.  She accepts. 

                              ALEX (cont d)
                I have to go. 

  They kiss again, quite possibly for the last time.  Finally, 
  Alex leaves.  He looks back, wordlessly, pained.  The door 
  shuts.  And Claire is left with a confused and damaged heart. 


  Trevor (shot from the waist up) enters, chipper  n cheery 
  after his successes (music should reflect that). 

                                CLAIRE (V.O.)
                And so, our Cupid proves to be an 
                  appropriate present day analogy for that 
                most elusive emotion:  love.  Like love, 
                he is demanding, nostalgic, obnoxious, 
                and unstoppable. 

  Champ approaches, done with his shift. 

                                TREVOR
                How s your casting situation. 

                              CHAMP
                What casting situation?  

                                TREVOR
                I see. 

                              CHAMP
                How s your bead situation? 

                                TREVOR
                Better. 

  Off that, REVEAL COLIN, as Trevor and Champ look down at him. 

                              CHAMP
                Oh yeah, so this is our new roommate? 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     67.

                Yup. 

                              CHAMP
                Hope he s cleaner than you. 

  As Champ leaves, Trevor heads for the bar, warmly greets the 
  regulars, introduces himself to a new face.  And we:

  REVEAL CLAIRE, watching Trevor from a table, writing on a 
  pad.  She s in her down-time duds. 

                                CLAIRE (V.O.)
                ... And like love, he comes crashing into 
                your life when you least want or expect 
                it and demands your full attention. 

  At that, Trevor crashes down beside her.  Colin bounds on 
  Claire s lap. 

                                TREVOR
                      (demanding her full attention)
                Like him? 

                                CLAIRE
                Aww, what a cutie.  Is he yours? 

                                TREVOR
                Colin, nah.  Just dog-sitting until some 
                new antihistamines hit the market. 

  Claire fawns all over Colin, petting him, doggy-talking. 

                                TREVOR (cont d)
                Yeah, he s a chick magnet.  I m thinking 
                of renting him out to the goober guys in 
                your group.  Help offset the cost of 
                puppy chow.  Little freeloader. 

                                CLAIRE
                I m glad you got a dog. 

                                TREVOR
                Think I needed more fur clinging to my 
                clothes? 

  Trevor PULLS some dog hairs off his sleeve, shudders. 

                                CLAIRE
                I think you need not to be alone so much.  
                And now you know there s always someone 
                out there who remembers you at your best. 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)"Chapter Six"      #116      Writer's Draft     1/22/99     68.

  Sure she means the dog.

                I guess it s good to know you ve got 
                someone around.  For when you need  em. 

  Okay, we re not sure who knows exactly what here.  But if 
  they both knew that they both know everything, we might have 
  a real moment on our hands...  Claire breaks the tension. 

                                CLAIRE
                Yeah, I d hate to have to barge in on 
                someone in the middle of the night. 

                                TREVOR
                You think the fuzzball gives your caliber 
                of advice?  Hey, Colin, how do I get 
                Champ and his girlyfriend back together? 
                      (nothing from the dog)
                See?   Nothing... 
                      (gets up; pats his thigh)
                A right, time for walkies...  Kid thinks 
                he s too good for the john.  C mon. 

  He leaves; Colin follows.  Writing one last line, a wistful 
  Claire watches them.  There they go... a god and his dog.

                And despite the changing times, Trevor, 
                like love, endures.  And despite all our 
                  rationale, all our fashionable attempts 
                at detachment, we submit to their charms 
                and their passions, and allow our lives 
                to be swept into the current.
