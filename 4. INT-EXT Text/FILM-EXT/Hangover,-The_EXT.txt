It's a beautiful spring morning in the Palisades. High atop
the cliffs, looking out over the Pacific Ocean, sits the
exclusive BEL AIR BAY CLUB. Workers bustle about the lawn,
setting up a high-end wedding.
A STRING QUARTET warms up. A team of FLORISTS arrange
centerpieces. CATERERS set the white linen tables...
Heat-waves rise off the Mojave. Standing at a lone, dust-
covered payphone in the middle of the desert is
VICK LENNON
He's in his late 20's, tall, rugged -- and currently a mess.
His shirt is ripped open, his aviator sunglasses are bent,
his lip is bloodied, and he clearly hasn't slept in days.
VICK
Tracy, it's Vick.
Parked on the dirt road behind Vick is his near-totalled 1967
Cadillac Deville convertible; it's scratched, dented, filthy -
- and missing its passenger side door.
Slouched inside are TWO OTHER GUYS, also looking like hell.
2.
TRACY
Hey Vick!
VICK
Listen, honey...The bachelor party
got a little out of control and,
well...we lost Doug.
TRACY
(her jaw dropping)
What?! But we're getting married in
like four hours!
Vick squints at the rising sun.
VICK
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
CUT TO:
TITLE OVER BLACK: 40 HOURS EARLIER
CUT TO:
The top down, The Who's "Baba O'Riley" blasting from the
stereo, Vick's pristine Cadillac convertible rockets down
Highway 10 towards Nevada.
At the wheel is Vick, looking as sharp as his Caddy in a half-
open shirt and mint condition aviators.
Sitting shotgun is the groom, DOUG BILLINGS, late 20's,
handsome, barefoot, crunchy -- an all around great guy.
Behind Vick sits ALAN MERVISH, late 20's, an anal tax
attorney from Connecticut, his Izod shirt tucked into his
khakis. He's currently applying sun screen to his forehead.
Next to Alan is STU PRYCE, late 20's, former high school
linebacker and lovably dimwitted father of two. He drums the
back of the frontseat to the music, totally pumped, like this
is his first time out of the house in years. Because it is.
STU
Dude this is already the best
weekend ever!
VICK
Stu, relax, we're still on the 10.
3.
STU
Oh, did I show you pictures of my
kids?!
DOUG
No, dude, show `em.
Stu fishes pictures out of his wallet and eagerly shows them
to Doug in the front seat. Doug is clearly the core of this
group, the glue that holds these childhood friends together.
STU
Haylee is two, and Kaitlin is
already four! Can you believe it?!
DOUG
(smiling at photos)
How cute... Good for you, man.
Doug shows the photos to Vick; he nods, impressed.
VICK
The one on the left is gonna be a
hottie. The other one, not so much.
Stu protectively snatches the photos back, muttering:
STU
Jesus, dude, those are my children--
ALAN
(re: sunscreen)
Hey, am I rubbed in?
Stu glances over and sees un-rubbed-in sunscreen all over
Alan's face.
STU
Yeah, you're good.
DOUG
Hey so Alan, are you and Becky
still together?
But before Alan can answer--
VICK
Of course they are, Doug. Jesus,
Alan's been dating Becky for 14
years. When they first met, Alan
had braces and soccer hair, and
Becky had a functioning hymen.
(MORE)
4.
VICK (CONT'D)
Asking Alan if he's still with
Becky is like asking the sun if it
still rises in the east.
The guys try not to laugh; Alan scowls.
DOUG
She still pressuring you to get
married?
ALAN
Enh, we've moved past the pressure
stage...it's more like aggravated
assault stage now? Like at the last
wedding we went to, she threw a
camera at my head, called me a
closet fag, then ran out crying.
The guys wince, oooo.
ALAN (CONT'D)
But we talked, and everything's
cool now.
STU
Maybe you could wear a helmet to
Doug's wedding.
ALAN
Great idea, Stu. Thanks.
DOUG
(LAUGHING)
So Vick, how's business going?
VICK
Oh, great. Yeah, I'm working on
bringing the next big dessert craze
to Los Angeles. It's gonna be huge.
DOUG
What is it?
VICK
Bavarian custard. We ran the
numbers, and it's gonna be bigger
than fro yo.
Doug and Stu nod, impressed; only Alan looks skeptical.
ALAN
Isn't custard like a trillion
calories--?
5.
VICK
Our plan is to open three stores in
the Valley and then franchise it.
Shares are selling fast, but I can
probably squeeze you guys in...
DOUG
Yeah, man, count me in.
STU
Me too, man! I love pudding!
Alan just shakes his head, unbelievable.
ALAN
Is this gonna do better than the
hip-hop label you started, Vick? Or
the topless sushi bar? Or the
mobile tattoo parlor--?
VICK
Tattoo-To-You was an idea ahead of
it's time, Alan! And don't come
crying to me when there's a Custard
Cabana on every street corner in
America and you didn't buy in--!
DOUG
(LAUGHING)
All right, all right, save it for
the party...
Vick and Alan quiet. Stu is still drumming the seat.
STU
Dude! I can't believe I get to
party all night, and then, tomorrow
...I get to sleep in! It's almost
too much! And FYI, if anyone gets
really drunk and craps themself,
just let me know, I can have you
cleaned up and partying again in
under three minutes. No joke. I am
a master of stool removal...
They rocket off into the desert, LAUGHING...
CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: "FRIDAY, 5:12 PM"
6.
As the last rays of sun fade, the Cadillac crests the final
hill to reveal LAS VEGAS in all its illuminated splendor...
The Caddy rolls down the famed Strip. We are again reminded
of the absurd scale of Las Vegas. The 5,000 room hotels, the
eight lane roads, the 60 foot billboards...
The Caddy rolls up to the Mandalay Bay. The guys hop out,
exhilarated. Vick throws the key to the VALET...
The guys, dressed to the nines, open the steel rooftop door
and file out onto the flat tar roof of the Mandalay Bay; Vick
is carrying a bottle of Patron and four hotel glasses.
Bringing up the rear, Alan slides a wood block between the
door and the frame so they aren't locked up here.
The guys step out onto the dark, windy roof and take in the
stunning panorama...the Strip...the mountains...the countless
stars... It's breathtaking.
STU
Thish is so great! I love you guys!
VICK
Check it out, Stu's already wasted.
Vick starts refilling everyone's glasses.
ALAN
We've only had two shots, man!
DOUG
Yeah, what happened, Stuey?! You
used to be able to drink us all
under the table!
STU
Dude, I'm a dad! I don't have time
to get plastered anymore! It blows!
(QUICKLY)
Am I a bad dad for saying that?
12.
DOUG
What? No!
STU
Because my dad was a bad dad.
DOUG
(patting his shoulder)
That's true, Stuey, but you're
different. We've talked about this.
Stu just stares at the guys, glassy-eyed. Beat.
STU
Have I showed you guys pictures of
my kids yet--?
ALAN & DOUG & VICK
YES!
Doug laughs and raises his glass for a toast, heartfelt:
DOUG
Little toast: to Tracy, the
coolest, kindest, most beautiful
woman I've ever met. I can't
believe she let me come this
weekend -- much less agreed to
spend the rest of her life with me.
I think both will prove to be
massive errors of judgement on her
part.
The guys chuckle, hear-hear.
DOUG (CONT'D)
And to being here, with my best
friends in the world. There's
nowhere else I'd rather be.
The guys raise their glasses, touched.
DOUG (CONT'D)
That said, let's not get too stupid
tonight, okay? I'm getting married
in 36 hours.
ALAN & STU & VICK
No, no. / We'll be good. / Totally,
dude.
Doug lowers his glass, laughing, completely unconvinced.
13.
DOUG
I'm serious, dudes! Nothing above
the neck -- no piercings, no weird
haircuts, no facial tattoos. I
gotta look decent on Sunday.
VICK
Jesus, what do you take us for?
DOUG
Vick: you shaved Alan's eyebrows
off the night before graduation!
STU
Oh yeah! That was hilarious! And
remember when I blacked out at
Homecoming and you wrote on my face
with permanent marker?! That was
awesome! What'd you write again?
ALAN & DOUG & VICK
"Respect me!"
They all laugh. Stu throws his arm around Doug, nostalgic.
STU
Ahh, good times, man. Good times...
VICK
We'll be good tonight, Doug.
ALAN
Seriously, man, we're your friends.
STU
Yeah, we've totally grown up since
then.
Doug looks at them, highly dubious, then hoists his glass.
DOUG
Well then...to a night we'll never
forget.
They CLINK glasses, shoot their shots, and
SMASH CUT TO:
THE NEXT MORNING
Shafts of white desert sunlight pour into
14.
THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE
THE CAMERA follows a LIVE CHICKEN as it walks through the
totalled suite.
Furniture is broken, the minibar ransacked, and the floor is
covered with remnants of the night before: empty beer cans,
platefuls of room service food, a cowboy hat, the Gideon
Bible, half-eaten skinless mangos, a bra, a battle axe, etc.
SNORING on the couch, wearing only his jeans and one shoe,
the word ASSHOLE written in Sharpie across his chest, is Stu.
TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 11:15AM"
The chicken struts across the top of the couch, until it
reaches a plastic coin cup from Bellagio blocking its path.
Beat. Then the chicken pecks it off...onto Stu.
The cup hits Stu in the face, and stale beer splashes all
over him. Stu spastically jerks awake and flips off the
couch, onto a pile of newspapers.
PILE OF NEWSPAPERS
OWW! Get off! Get off! Jesus!
Confused, Stu clambers off the pile of newspapers -- to find
Vick sleeping underneath, on the floor, fully dressed. Vick
pulls himself onto the couch, clearly in pain.
VICK
Damn, dude, why are you retarded?
Both men are ragingly hungover.
A long beat as both of them rub their faces, then:
VICK (CONT'D)
Um, Stuey?
STU
Yo.
VICK
Why do you have a mullet?
Stu does, in fact, have a mullet haircut. But he's too
hungover to understand.
STU
What?
15.
VICK
You know, business on top, party
down the back?
Stu still looks confused. This is excruciating for Vick.
VICK (CONT'D)
Your hair, dude. You have a mullet.
Stu touches his hair. Then he stumbles into the bathroom.
After a beat, we hear his voice:
STU (O.S.)
Dude...I have a mullet.
Then we hear ALAN'S VOICE in the bathroom, groggy:
ALAN (O.S.)
Just give me ten more minutes,
Beck...
STU (O.S.)
Whoa, did you sleep in the tub?
Beat, then Stu pokes his head out of the bathroom.
STU (CONT'D)
Check it out: Alan slept in the
tub.
VICK
Get him up. I'm hungry.
Stu disappears back into the bathroom. We hear the SHOWER
turn on. Beat. Then we hear Alan slowly awaken:
ALAN (O.S.)
Wet. Water. Jesus, what's--?!
There's a THUD as Alan falls out of tub. Beat.
Then Stu and a very confused, very hungover, very wet Alan
stumble out of the bathroom.
Alan appears to be wearing his polo shirt from the night
before. Only, as we PULL BACK, we see that his shirt is cut
off at his chest -- he's naked from there down.
VICK
Jesus, dude, put away your sack.
Alan looks down at his hairy nakedness, totally bewildered.
16.
STU
Yeah, and it might be time for some
manscaping, bro. Your bush looks
like Yanni.
Alan looks back up again, squinting, hungover.
ALAN
What did we do last night?
CUT TO:
Stu, walking bow-legged, squinting painfully in the bright
sun, tries to inspect everyone lying around the huge pool.
Doug? Doug? Several HOT WOMEN in bikinis sit up, disgusted!
STU
No, no. It's cool, I'm a dad. It's
totally cool...
CUT TO:
The three guys exit the hotel looking like crap. Vick hands
his ticket to the valet. Alan chews mint gum.
VICK
So, we go to the wedding chapel, we
find out what we did with Doug, we
recover him, and we're back in LA
before sundown. Easy as Stu's ass.
No one laughs. Tense SILENCE as they wait for the car.
STU
Check it out, some idiot threw his
bed out the window last night.
Stu points over at a huge stone GRIFFIN in front of the hotel
with an ENTIRE BED impaled upon its ear.
ALAN
That was us, dude.
29.
STU
Really?
ALAN
Yeah, there's no bed in Doug's
room.
STU
(FROWNING)
Oh. Well, I'm sure we had a good
reason for doing it.
(BEAT)
You think they'll charge us for--?
ALAN
Yeah, Stu, I really do.
VICK
Guys, relax. Everything's gonna be
cool...
Just then the Valet drives up in
VICK'S DESTROYED CADILLAC
The exterior is scratched and filthy, like it's been off-
roading. The hubcaps are gone, as is the front passenger side
door. A wisp of STEAM trails up from under the hood.
The guys just stand there, agape.
STU
You okay, Vick?
VICK
I'm not emotionally prepared to
talk about it just yet, Stuart, but
thank you.
Vick dons his sunglasses and heads for his destroyed car...
DISSOLVE TO:
THE GUYS ROLLING DOWN THE STRIP
in their ridiculous car. Cars full of FAMILIES, cute GIRLS,
even NUNS, point and stare. Our guys just face forward, each
quietly suffering in their own personal Hell.
ALAN
Seriously: what am I gonna tell
Becky? For 14 years she's been
begging me to get married...
30.
VICK
Well, now you did. Just not to her.
Alan glowers at the city going by... Then he sits up--
ALAN
Wait, is that homeless guy wearing
Doug's shirt?
The guys turn to see a HOMELESS GUY weaving down the sidewalk
in Doug's DISTINCTIVE ORANGE SHIRT from the night before.
Once they pass, the guys exchange a look.
STU
Naaah.
VICK
Yeah, that was a different shirt.
Alan doesn't look so sure. They drive in silence. Then:
VICK (CONT'D)
Left turn.
Stu, sitting shotgun, braces against the empty doorframe so
as not to fall out of the car as they turn left...
Sitting in an East Vegas strip mall, sandwiched between a
laundromat and a pawn shop, is the pink Now & Forever Wedding
Chapel. The Cadillac parks in the lot out front.
Vick drives like the wind, trying to see around the huge
SPIDERWEB in the windshield. Alan and Stu are freaking out.
ALAN
Why'd you do that?!
VICK
(INCREDULOUS)
Really?
STU
Maybe they just wanted to talk!
VICK
I honestly don't know how you two
are still alive.
ALAN
Do you think we stole something
from them last night?!
STU
Oh my god I am such a bad dad!
ALAN
(producing cellphone)
I'm calling the police. This is
getting way out of control--
VICK
No! No cops!
ALAN
"No cops?!" Who are you, Fitty
Cent?!
41.
STU
Yeah, Vick, what's going on?
VICK
Nothing! I just think we should
focus on finding Doug and not get
distracted by every little thing!
ALAN
Every little thing?! We were just
assaulted by the Yakuza!
VICK
Oh please, those guys are from
Guam. Get a grip.
ALAN
They knew your name, Vick! Which
means they probably know who Stu
and I are, too!
STU
If anything ever happened to my
family, Vick...
VICK
Fine. Let's just go back to the
hotel -- Doug is probably back from
wherever he spent the night, we'll
get him, we'll straighten out
whatever we did to those angry
Samoans, then we'll get the hell
back to LA, okay? Left turn.
Vick angrily takes a harder-than-necessary left turn. Alan
hangs on tight, almost flying out of the car.
CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 2:26 PM"
Chastity and the guys hurry around the corner from the Crazy
Horse, laughing, exhilarated from the chase.
STU
Did you see them trample those tiny
Japanese businessmen?! I think they
killed like four of them!
Everyone laughs. Vick puts his arm around Alan.
VICK
Come on, Alan: tell me that wasn't
just a little fun...
ALAN
That was...a little fun.
Vick smiles -- just as a LAS VEGAS POLICE CAR hops the curb,
lights flashing, and cuts them off! Two mustachioed COPS get
out and hurry for them, pointing, intense.
LAS VEGAS POLICEMAN
Victor Lennon?! Alan Mervish?!
Stuart Pryce?!
STU
(SCARED)
Y-Yes?!
LAS VEGAS POLICEMAN
You're coming with us.
CUT TO:
54.
Day has turned to night. Vick, Stu, and Alan descend the
steps of the police station. The mood is grim.
ALAN
Did you have to be such a dick?!
VICK
We got out, didn't we?
ALAN
Yeah, four hours later! If we'd
just cooperated with them--
VICK
If we'd cooperated with them, we'd
be in jail right now, Alan.
They reach the curb, and Stu starts trying to hail a cab.
Desperation is setting in.
58.
ALAN
What are we gonna do now? We've got
zero leads on where Doug is!
STU
Why hasn't he called? It's 8:30.
The guys shake their heads, I don't know.
STU (CONT'D)
Do you think he's okay--?
VICK
Stu, don't. Doug is fine.
STU
I mean, we were hanging out with
mobsters last night, man! They kill
people for looking at `em weird--!
VICK
Stu: Doug is fine.
STU
Or what if we like drove Doug out
to the desert and left him, just as
like a funny prank--?!
VICK
Stu! Enough!
ALAN
(MUTTERING)
I knew I shouldn't have come...
VICK
What did you just say?
ALAN
I said I knew I shouldn't have come
this weekend, Vick!
VICK
(getting heated)
Is that right?
ALAN
Yeah, that's right. I only came
because Doug insisted.
Vick steps towards Alan, heated.
59.
VICK
Why do think you're so much better
than us, dude?!
ALAN
I don't -- I just think I'm better
than you, Vick! And trust me, it's
not that hard! You haven't changed
one bit since high school! Jesus,
you're 28 years old and you still
talk back to cops?! Really?!
VICK
You're out of your depth, Alan--
ALAN
And you're still the one getting us
in trouble! Only then it was hiding
your weed in our locker, and now
you've got us partying with wanted
felons! It's not cute anymore, man!
We're too old for this!
Vick scowls; this is actually hitting home...
ALAN (CONT'D)
And all your stupid get-rich-quick
schemes?! Girl-nasium?! Custard?!
In Los Angeles?! Are you joking?!
STU
Okay, let's all take a breath--
ALAN
When's the last time you had a real
job, man?! When's the last time you
had a girlfriend?! Hell, when's the
last time you picked up the check?!
VICK
What's so great about any of those
things?!
ALAN
Those "things," Vick, are what
grown men do!
Vick swallows, furious.
STU
Look, we're all tired and hungry--
60.
VICK
None of us ever liked you, Alan! We
only hung out with you because Doug
made us!
Alan recoils, whoa, stung. This is clearly news to him.
ALAN
Stu...? Is that true?
Stu gestures, uncomfortable, enh, who's to say? Alan nods, I
see, his face reddening.
VICK
Why would anyone like you, dude?
Have you ever thought about that?
You're uptight, you're judgemental,
you're cheap, and yet somehow you
think you're sweeter than everyone
else! Well look around, man: no one
wants to be you! I'd rather be Stu
than you!
STU
Wait, what--?
Too late: Alan charges Vick and TACKLES him onto the lawn!
They roll on the ground, trying to punch each other, but it
ends up being a mess of half-chops, pulled hair, and hands in
each other's faces...
ALAN
I've...always...hated you...
VICK
You punch like...your sister...
Stu runs over and jumps in, trying to break them apart.
STU
Hey, no! Time out! We all need a
time out--!
THUNK! Stu is accidentally kicked in the face and goes down.
Alan and Vick continue rolling on the lawn, trying to beat
the crap out of each other. They could be kids again. Then,
just when it starts getting way too intense,
A CAR HORN SOUNDS
And all three of them look up to see Vick'S BEAT-UP CADILLAC
parked on the curb, Chastity at the wheel.
61.
CHASTITY
That might not be like, the
smartest place to fight?
Vick and Alan look over at the huge LAS VEGAS POLICE
DEPARTMENT sign right next to them. They frown...
CUT TO:
Vick's car sits parked in front of a country bar.
The guys rocket down the Strip, weaving in and out of
traffic! All the stamps on Stu's arm are now labelled in
regular ink. MUSIC blares, and the mood is high.
STU
Where do you want to start?!
VICK
At the top! We hit every club we
went to til someone remembers what
we did with Doug!
ALAN
Nice clue, Stuey! I can't believe
we're actually gonna pull this off!
Stu grins over at the car next to them. Then he stops.
STU
Hey: is that guy wearing Doug's
hat?!
The guys look over to see that the DRIVER of the next car
over is, in fact, wearing the DISTINCTIVE FEDORA-STYLE HAT
Doug was wearing last night. The guy turns off the Strip.
VICK
Naaah, couldn't be.
ALAN
Lots of people have hats like that.
Stu nods, yeah, I guess...
TIGHT ON: STU'S HAND
The first bar written on it is "GhostBar."
MATCH CUT TO:
The BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and
unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line...
Chastity and the guys bound out of Chaps, jubilant. Stu is
carrying a box of TWO DOZEN VIDEOTAPES.
ALAN
That was cool of Roger to give you
all the tapes of your performance.
STU
I know, if I actually was gay, I'd
totally date Roger first. What a
gentle soul.
They get into Vick's clunker.
77.
VICK
How we doing on time?
ALAN
(looking at watch)
2:22.
VICK
We'll be in LA by dawn.
(firing up engine)
I told you bitches this would all
work out...
They drive off into the night, grins all around.
Vick drives, Stu sits shotgun. Alan sits in the back with
Chastity. The cool night air washes over them. They look
happily exhausted.
ALAN
This has officially been the
craziest weekend of my life.
(to Chastity)
Thanks for all your help. You were
awesome.
CHASTITY
Anything for my hubby.
Alan's smile flickers slightly.
CHASTITY (CONT'D)
I'm kidding, Alan. I know last
night wasn't, you know, real...
She looks out at Vegas as it flies by.
ALAN
I'm sorry about all this, Chastity.
CHASTITY
Jennifer.
ALAN
Beg pardon?
CHASTITY
My name is Jennifer. Jennifer Elly.
Alan hesitates; suddenly she seems a lot more...human.
78.
ALAN
Okay, well, I'm sorry, Jennifer.
CHASTITY
Oh, don't be. Last night wasn't the
first flaky decision I've ever made
in my life. I mean, I am a
stripper.
Alan tries not to laugh. She smiles, a twinge sadly.
ALAN
Where you from?
CHASTITY
LA. Tarzana.
ALAN
Oh yeah?
CHASTITY
Yeah. I work here on the weekends.
ALAN
You fly out every week?
CHASTITY
Yeah. I'd move, but my kid is in a
great school.
ALAN
Kid?
VICK
(aside, to Stu)
They always have kids.
CHASTITY
I have a little girl, Sarah.
She's... Well, she's everything.
Chastity proudly shows Alan a photo from her purse of a cute
little toddler. Alan smiles.
CHASTITY (CONT'D)
What about you?
ALAN
No kids. Same girlfriend for 14
years. Becky.
Alan shows her a photo of Becky on his cellphone.
79.
CHASTITY
Wow, she's stunning.
Stu turns around, unable to keep quiet any longer:
STU
We like you way better.
ALAN
STU!
Chastity tries to stymie her laugh.
ALAN (CONT'D)
Becky is great.
STU
Becky collects teapots.
VICK
Yeah, she's a total canwego.
CHASTITY
A what?
VICK
You know, she's the girl at the
party who's always like "Can we go?
Can we go?"
Chastity laughs. Alan does too, shaking his head.
ALAN
She has low blood sugar.
STU
She has low fun sugar.
ALAN
Jesus, guys! This is the girl I'm
going to marry!
(beat, considers)
If, you know...she forgives me for
cheating on her...
VICK
Wait: you're going to tell her?
ALAN
Of course I'm going to tell her! I
could never keep something like
that from her.
80.
VICK
Dude, she still hasn't forgiven me
for scratching her Queensryche CD
in sixth grade -- she's neeeeever
gonna forgive you for marrying a
stripper in Vegas.
ALAN
Well, then that's just the price
I'm going to have to pay.
Alan looks off, stoic. Chastity pats his hand, proud.
CHASTITY
Good for you.
She smiles at Alan, impressed, pulling her hair from her
face. Alan looks at her anew... It's a sweet moment...
VICK
She's gonna cut your dick off,
dude.
CUT TO:
Lamborghini's, Ferrari's and Hummer limos clog the valet
stand. Vick rolls up in his clunker. The guys hop out.
VICK
(to the valet)
Keep `er close, Paco. We'll be
right back.
The guys pack their bags into Vick's beat-up Caddy. The mood
is as dark as the pre-dawn sky. When the car is loaded,
Chastity takes Alan's hands, gentle.
CHASTITY
Would you like me to come with?
ALAN
No...It might get a little
dangerous. I wouldn't want...
He trails off. Chastity nods.
CHASTITY
I'm so sorry...about everything.
ALAN
Thanks for all your help.
Awkward silence. The cold desert wind blows.
CHASTITY
There's no sense...in exchanging
numbers or anything...right?
ALAN
Yeah, probably not...
Alan looks genuinely sad.
89.
CHASTITY
Well...I'll always remember you as
a great first husband, then.
They both smile weakly.
CHASTITY (CONT'D)
You can just send the divorce
papers to the Crazy Horse or
whatever...
Alan nods, okay. Another awkward pause.
CHASTITY (CONT'D)
Thanks for reminding me that there
are still some really good guys out
there, Alan. I don't...I don't get
to meet too many of them.
She smiles a bit sadly, kisses him on the cheek, and walks
off. TIGHT ON Alan's Grandmother's ring still on her finger.
Alan doesn't remember the ring, however; he's too busy
watching her walk out of his life, and feeling a real sense
of loss...
Then Vick fires up the car next to him.
VICK
We gotta go, man.
Alan nods, yeah, and gets in the car...
The Caddy is parked next to MILE MARKER 26 in the middle of
the windy desert. The Las Vegas skyline is just barely
visible in the distance.
Vick very delicately zips up his duffel bag so as not to
disturb the bills, and places it on his lap.
ALAN
This is the dumbest plan ever.
VICK
Alan I need you positive please.
STU
Here they come.
They all look up to see a WHITE YUKON approaching on the far
horizon, kicking up a trail of dust. The guys tense up.
VICK
Stuart?
STU
Yeah?
VICK
There's an emergency bottle of
tequila in my glove box. Get it out
please.
Stu opens the glovebox, pulls out a bottle of Patron. He
opens it, takes a swig, then passes it to Vick, who takes a
pull and passes it to Alan, who also drinks.
They all watch the white Yukon draw ever closer.
ALAN
I can't believe this is how we're
going to die...
The Yukon pulls up about ten yards away. No one moves.
The Yukon's doors open... The Cadillac's doors open...
TIGHT ON the Jimmy Lang's RED BOOT as it hits the road...
92.
TIGHT ON Vick's LEATHER SHOE, then Alan's SAILING TOPSIDER,
then Stu's FLIP-FLOP, as they all hit the dusty road...
The two parties stand by their respective cars, facing off.
Somewhere in the desert, a rattlesnake RATTLES.
JIMMY LANG
Let's see the money!
Vick gently holds up his duffel bag.
VICK
Let's see Doug!
Jimmy Lang nods to Kalolo, who opens the back door of the
Yukon and pulls out a GUY with his hands tied behind his back
and a plastic RALPH'S BAG over his head; he struggles a bit.
The guys look a bit alarmed.
ALAN
Jesus, what'd they do to him?
VICK
Pull off the Ralph's bag!
Jimmy yanks the bag off of the guy's head to reveal
IT'S NOT DOUG
It's some black dude. Vick, Stu, and Alan look confused.
VICK
Who the hell is that?!
JIMMY LANG
(ANNOYED)
This is Doug!
He pushes the guy forward.
ALAN
Oh my God: it's the other Doug!
Roger's friend, the cake designer!
BLACK DOUG
(to Jimmy Lang)
I told you, man, I'm Doug Howland!
I barely even know these guys!
VICK
Yeah, you got the wrong Doug, man!
93.
Jimmy Lang and the thugs look exasperated.
JIMMY LANG
You sure?!
VICK
Yeah, man, our Doug is white!
JIMMY LANG
But you were partying with this guy
at my birthday thing!
VICK
I don't know what to tell you, bro,
this isn't the Doug we requested!
JIMMY LANG
Well. I apologize for the mix-up...
(drawing his HUGE GUN)
But I'm still gonna need my money.
Vick and the guys start backtracking towards their car.
ALAN
Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God...
JIMMY LANG
Don't move, Vick.
Vick freezes, duffel in hand, as Stu and Alan slink from
view. Jimmy reaches Vick, gun calmly trained at his head.
JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
Now please. Give me my money.
All eyes on Vick, anxiously clutching the bag in his hand...
Sweat beads on his brow...
JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
Don't be stupid, son. You--
Then Vick throws a hard left hook, SLAMMING Jimmy square in
his massive stomach! And
NOTHING HAPPENS
Jimmy is built like a tank. Vick freezes, oh shit. Then Jimmy
PISTOL-WHIPS Vick -- his lip explodes with blood and he falls
to the ground.
VICK
Christ that hurts!
94.
Then Jimmy picks up the duffel bag. Hefts it. Feels wrong. He
goes to open the zipper when he hears:
STU
AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
Jimmy looks up to see Stu insanely charging him like the
linebacker he once was! Jimmy raises his gun, but
STU TACKLES JIMMY TO THE GROUND FIRST!
The gun flies free and they wrestle for it! Dust flies!
BACK BY THE YUKON
The two Guamians fumble for their guns -- but it's difficult
with huge CASTS on their shooting hands!
ON BLACK DOUG
He sees what's going down, and, his hands tied behind his
back, takes off sprinting towards Vegas!
BY THE CADDILAC
Alan looks around, what should I do?! What should I do?! Then
he spots the keys in the ignition of the car. He hops in and
fires up the engine! Just then
THE TWO GUAMIANS OPEN FIRE
Bullets pound into the Cadillac! Alan ducks down, terrified,
and floors the gas!
ALAN
I'm being shot at! I'm being shot
at!
UP AHEAD
Jimmy Lang throws Stu off of him and recovers his gun,
panting. He cocks it, aims it at Stu on the ground.
JIMMY LANG
I really didn't want to kill anyone
TODAY--
Then WHAM! Alan drives the car into Jimmy Lang at 25mph!
The obese mobster is pitched off his feet, and lands a good
ten yards away, in a heap of dust!
The guys freeze, shocked.
95.
The Guamians freeze, shocked.
ALAN
Oh my god, is he okay?!
VICK
Who cares! Go go!
Alan floors the car while Stu and Vick SPRINT and DIVE in!
The caddy peels the hell out of there, kicking up rocks and
dust! The Guamians FIRE after them!
BULLETS IMPACT ALL ALL OVER CAR
taking out the tail-lights, the windshield, the headrests.
The guys duck down til they're sufficiently far away. Then
they sit up, amazed, out of breath.
STU
I can't believe you just saved my
life!
VICK
I can't believe you just drove my
car into Jimmy Lang!
Alan drives, his eyes as big as saucers.
STU
He's gonna be really upset!
ALAN
Yeah, I was just thinking that!
BACK ON JIMMY LANG
The huge mobster lies face-down on the desert floor. His two
henchmen waddle up, highly concerned.
KIKIOLANI
Boss, Boss, you okay?!
Jimmy sputters into the dirt, furious.
JIMMY LANG
Find Vick... And kill him.
The guys pull up at a lone, dusty payphone in the middle of
the desert. They all look at the phone.
ALAN
Who wants to make the call?
Beat. Then Vick reaches for his nose, odd man out. Stu and
Alan immediately reach for their noses, too. It's close.
STU
That was you!
ALAN
What?! No! I beat you by a mile!
STU
Vick, who won?!
VICK
(FROWNING)
Actually...I should do it. This
weekend was mostly my fault. I need
to Man Up.
Alan looks shocked -- and impressed -- by Vick's newfound
sense of responsibility.
ALAN
Well, I'll be damned...
Vick grabs the bottle of Patron, takes a long swig. Beat.
VICK
I still can't believe Stu banged my
sister.
Vick hands the bottle to Alan, gets out, and makes for the
pay phone...
CUT TO:
Alan floors the car back onto the 15 towards Vegas, amped!
ALAN
Remember when we saw Doug's bed
impaled on the griffin thing?!
STU
Yeah, we threw it out the window.
ALAN
No: the windows don't open,
remember?!
99.
VICK
So how did--?
(REALIZING)
Oh my God.
STU
I don't get it.
ALAN
And that's why we've been seeing
Doug's clothes all over Vegas! He
was trying to signal someone!
VICK
I don't believe it...
STU
I-I still don't get it--
ALAN
And it totally jives with the
timeline, right?! We brought Doug
back to the hotel at 5:00, he was
passed out...
VICK
It's so obvious!
STU
Not...to me...so much?
VICK
How'd you figure it out?!
ALAN
The Patron, man! It reminded me of
our first drink of the night!
VICK
Honestly, dude, you're a genius.
STU
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHERE
DOUG IS?!
VICK
He's on the roof!
Stu looks confused, the roof?
100.
ALAN
After Doug passed out, we must've
taken him up there in his bed as a
prank, so he'd wake up on the roof
or whatever? Then we forgot him.
VICK
And all day he's been throwing his
crap off the roof, trying to signal
someone to get him down!
STU
You think he's still up there?!
ALAN
Only one way to find out...
SMASH CUT TO:
The guys peel up to the valet and sprint out of the car.
The guys burst out of the steel door, onto the massive black
tar roof. It's empty.
ALAN
DOUG?! DOUG?!
VICK
WHERE ARE YOU, MAN?!
But Doug is nowhere to be seen. The guys start to despair...
Then...stepping out from behind an air-conditioning vent,
naked except for tighty-whities, his entire body bright pink
from sunburn...
IS DOUG!
And he looks furious. The guys run to him, overjoyed!
ALAN
DOUG!
STU
Oh my god, I'm so glad you're okay!
101.
Before they can hug him, though, Doug holds up his hand, and
whispers, nasty, parched:
DOUG
Don't...even...talk to me.
The guys stop short.
VICK
Okay, no, that's cool!
STU
Yeah, you have every right to be
upset! We validate your anger!
CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: "SUNDAY, 7:05AM"
The guys gingerly rush Doug, now in a Mandalay Bay bathrobe
and clutching an arm-full of BOTTLED WATERS, through the
hotel lobby. Alan is arguing into his cellphone.
As they pass ATASHIR at his desk, Vick yells over:
VICK
Why'd you do it, sweet Atashir?!
Why did you betray us?!
ATASHIR
Because they paid me. And also
because you're kind of racist.
VICK
Fair enough! See you next time, you
beautiful Judas!
They blow out of the hotel...
...where their beatup Caddy is waiting. Alan slams his
cellphone shut, frowning.
ALAN
No flights to LA with empty seats!
STU
Well, we can't drive! It's 350
miles to LA and the wedding starts
at 10, which is in--
(MORE)
102.
STU (CONT'D)
(looking at watch)
--three hours!
Beat. Then Vick, Stu and Alan exchange a look...a smile
slowly creeps across their faces.
SMASH CUT TO:
THE TOTALLED CADILLAC ROCKETING DOWN I-15
Vick is at the wheel, leaning on the HORN, keeping the three-
doored Caddy at 110 miles per hour. When traffic gets thick,
he doesn't hesitate to drive in the shoulder.
In the backseat, Doug chugs bottled water, still simmering.
VICK
Look, Doug, I think I speak for
everyone in the car when I say I'm
really sorry about locking you on
the roof of the hotel.
STU
You gotta admit, it's a pretty
funny prank... I mean, up until the
part when we forgot all about you.
Doug just stares out at the desert in stony silence.
STU (CONT'D)
He's still not talking to us.
ALAN
Totally understandable, man.
Whenever you're ready...
CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: "SUNDAY, 9:15AM"
Workers bustle about the grand lawn of the Bel Air Bay Club,
putting the last touches on the outdoor wedding site.
It's beautiful: the royal palms, the expansive views of the
Pacific, the white chairs in perfect rows, the altar adorned
in roses. A HARPIST begins to warm up as well-heeled GUESTS
filter in, finding their seats...
103.
A GARY'S TUXEDO VAN speeds up alongside the Caddy as they fly
down the 10 freeway. A very nervous TEENAGER opens the van's
sliding door and, wind whipping his face, throws a huge
PACKAGE over to Alan, who stands and catches it! Vick nods at
the van driver and shouts over the wind:
VICK
I OWE YOU, NEECO!
The driver gives Vick a thumbs up, and heads off. Alan rips
open the package -- inside are four TUXEDOS. The guys start
taking off their tattered clothes...
CUT TO:
All the seats at the wedding are filled. Everyone is there.
Except the Groomsmen. Or the Groom. The harpist still plays,
though she's starting to look a little pissed.
The guys,
now in their tuxes, rocket down the freeway,
primping.
Alan brushes his teeth, Doug tries to comb his
hair, Stu
flosses, and Vick shaves with an electric razor as
he weaves
in and out of traffic...
CUT TO:
104.
