Julie explodes out of the building. Hurries down a sidewalk. Will
finally catches up.
WILL
Julie! Wait! You okay?
JULIE
I'm fine.
WILL
You sure?
JULIE
I'm fine.
WILL
You don't seem fine.
Julie realizes this is true.
JULIE
I had another dream, Will.
Will takes this seriously.
WILL
The shower again?
JULIE
It was in a church...it was so real.
I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
WILL
(caring)
I'm sorry.
JULIE
I thought I was over the dreams for
good. I really did. I hadn't had one
for months.
WILL
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna
get better.
JULIE
It can't get worse. I mean, it's not
like this was the first time I
freaked out in class. I hardly ever
get a full night's sleep, my grades
suck, I'm this close from being thrown
out of school.
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! EXPLOSIONS. Julie jumps out of her skin. It's just
STUDENTS letting off FIRECRACKERS as they fly past on bicycles.
Will and Julie are now thinking the same thing.
JULIE
(cont'd)
It was one year ago...
WILL
It's...the anniversary. That's what's
going on...Take it easy on yourself.
JULIE
(weary)
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I
don't even know why I came up here in
the first place.
WILL
(cheering her up)
To get out of Southport?
JULIE
(softens)
Right. Now I remember.
He smiles at her. She smiles back. They stop in front of her apartment
building.
JULIE (cont'd)
Are you getting out of town on the
fourth?
WILL
Nah. I'll probably just be here
studying for finals. The joys of
summer school...
(beat)
Are you okay?
JULIE
I'm okay.
WILL
Are you sure?
She touches his face affectionately.
JULIE
Thanks for the talk, Will. You're
good to me.
Will stands there akwardly --
WILL
Um...Okay. Bye.
Will walks away. Julie watches him a beat, then turns down her walk --
RAY
steps out of the shadows. Julie practically faints.
JULIE
Oh, my god, Ray. You scared me.
Recovering, she hugs Ray, genuinely glad to see him. He's a bit cold.
RAY
I got in early. I was excited...
(re: the receding Will)
Who was that guy?
JULIE
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend.
You'd like him.
RAY
Yeah.
JULIE
Ray, we're just friend.
RAY
Every guy in history who tried to
pick up a girl did the good-friend
thing first.
JULIE
Why are you being like this?
It should be obvious Ray feels insecure in the college environs, but
they're miscommunicating.
RAY
Hey, I'm sorry. You're right. Are
you ready to go? I've got the old
truck. You know the drill...Crab
boil at Ollie's. Croaker Queen
Pageant...It's only small-town fun,
but it's still nice. People really
miss you. I miss you.
She looks at Ray, his compassionate demeanor. This is hard to say --
JULIE
(softly, but resolved)
Ray, I can't...
RAY
Can't what?
JULIE
I just feel like some part of me
hasn't healed up enough to go back.
Like some critical piece is missing.
Please understand...
Ray is cold. This is what he's expected all along.
RAY
I understand something.
JULIE
It's not like that. It's not you.
It's me. My head. I want to go back.
I want to be with you. I want to be
fine. I want everything to be like
it used to be.
(beat)
It just isn't.
Ray is hurt and confused.
JULIE (cont'd)
Hey, why don't you stay up here?
They have fireworks over the river.
And...there's a million things to do.
RAY
I have to work, Julie. My boat's in
Southport, remember? But, I get it.
You need your space from Craokerland.
And maybe from me, too.
Ray starts walking away.
RAY (cont'd)
You know where to find me.
JULIE
Ray? Ray? At least come up for a
while.
Ray keeps on walking.
RAY
It's okay. I'm just gonna go.
Julie follows him out to the road. A group of LAUGHING STUDENTS block
her way.
JULIE
Ray, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
(to herself)
I'm just scared...that's all.
But Ray is already gone. Julie stares after him a beat, then turns
quickly to her door. She clearly feels uncomfortable, exposed on the
walk alone. She nervously pulls her keys. A can of mace dangles from
the keychain.
CUT TO:
Students throw FRISBEE in the street. Ray walks to his old truck,
which is wedged between a new Sport Utility and a BMW.
He clambers into the front seat. He thinks. Then, digs into his pocket
and pulls out the unmistakable shape of an ENGAGEMENT RING BOX. He
throws it in the glove box, starts the truck and drives away.
CUT TO:
A SMALL MOUND OF RED SNAPPER is DUMPED -- wiggling and suffocating its
way across the deck of a fishing boat.
WE PULL AWAY TO REVEAL it's RAY who's just done the dumping. A
coworker, DAVE, friendly, playful, and down-to-earth, calls out from
the dock --
DAVE
Hey, Ray...phone!
Ray takes the phone.
WE INTERCUT.
JULIE
Hi.
Ray is happy to hear her voice, but cautious.
RAY
(beat)
Hey. I'm really glad you called...
I'm sorry.
JULIE
(compassoinate)
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm
the one --
RAY
No, I shouldn't have left so fast...
I was just...
JULIE
It's okay.
Dave holds up two wriggling snappers. He dances them toward each other
in a puppetlike mating ritual, making KISSING SOUNDS and narrating --
DAVE
(as the fish)
Julie, I love you. I know I'm only a
humble fish, but if you really look
at it, you're a fish, too.
(girl voice)
Oh, Ray, you're right...Do me like a
snapper.
(mashing the fish together)
Hey, something smells like fish...
Ray waves him away, concentrating on his call.
JULIE
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas!
An island called Tower Bay. And she
wants us to come with her.
RAY
What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
Dave's interest is piqued.
JULIE
We'd have a long weekend just to sit
in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and
swim, and...
(sexy)
You know...
RAY
This weekend?
Dave is watching Ray closely. Ray's expression hardens.
RAY
(hurt)
You'll go away with you're college
friends, but you won't go away with
me?
DAVE
Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
Karla is watching Julie.
JULIE
It's not you, it's Southport. And
it's the Bahamas! And it's free!
Karla is watching Julie.
KARLA
You gotta sell his butt on the
Bahamas?
JULIE
Ray, come on. I want us to be
together.
Ray thinks. Dave looks at him like he's crazy.
RAY
(can't give in)
Julie, we're working a big run up
here. It's been crazy. We probably
have to go out again tonight. I
don't think I can do it.
JULIE
Will you try...for me, please?
Dave moves one of the fish like it's been shot through the heart.
RAY
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...
(martyrlike)
If I don't make it up, then you go
ahead and have a great time.
JULIE
Ray...please try. I really miss you.
(beat)
Okay. Bye.
She hangs up and Karla sits next to her.
KARLA
That boy has got fish on the brain.
(sensitive)
Hey, cheer up, Charlie.
(singing a rumba)
We're going to the Bahamas. Bahama
Mama, yeah...
Ray is staring unhappily at the little pile of snapper. Dave is
staring at him in disbelief.
DAVE
Man, what is your problem? We
haven't caught anything for days.
Pull the big ugly stick out of
your butt. She asked you to go to
the Bahamas! Man, you gotta go.
We'll both drive up. I got friends
I can see up there.
Ray realizes how right he is.
RAY
Stupid. Stupid.
DAVE
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
Ray looks at Dave a contemplative beat, then walks over to his truck.
He leans in the passenger side and pulls out the engagement ring box.
Dave walks over.
RAY
You wanna see what I've been
thinking?
He holds up the box and slowly opens it. Dave is stunned.
DAVE
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw
the bomb.
RAY
I should go up there. I should call
her back, tell her I'm coming.
DAVE
No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be
psyched.
Ray is excited by the plan and Dave's right there with him.
DISSOLVE TO:
We stare out at a rain-soaked stretch of road.
A PICKUP ROARS past, cruising along with its RADIO loud and windows
rolled down.
Ray steps from his truck. Looks back at the empty car, then turns
toward the body.
RAY
(nervous)
Hey! Buddy, what's up?
The body doesn't move.
BEHIND RAY
and behind Dave, in the other car, a FIGURE IN A SLICKER sits up in
the back seat and gets out of the car.
Ray continues toward the body.
RAYS POV - BODY
FACE DOWN -- WEARING A BLACK RAIN SLICKER.
Ray moves closer to the all to familiar image.
BEHIND RAY
SLICKER FIGURE moves toward the unsuspecting Dave.
Ray nears the body. He kneels down.
RAY
Hey, can you hear me?
Ray reaches toward the body...
Ray turns over the body. Something isn't right. Ray jumps back --
CLOSE - SLICKER MANNEQUIN
Its eerie smile mocking Ray who turns for the truck.
RAY
DAVE!
Dave hears something. He turns to late. SPLLAATTT!!! THE FISHERMAN
jams his hook through Dave's jaw and skull and YANKS DAVE OUT OF THE
CAR WINDOW.
RAY
...Dave?
There's no answer from dead Dave. Ray tries to see around the
headlights. He moves slowly toward the truck.
The BRIGHTS and FOGS come on, blinding Ray. The truck's engine REVS.
The truck rolls a few inches, adjusting a bead on Ray.
Then, tires spinning, the truck launches straight at Ray.
Ray runs at the truck. AT THE LAST MINUTE, he ducks behind the parked
car.
HIS TRUCK goes SCREAMING past.
Ray backs around the car --
AN EIGHTEEN-WHEELER
goes barreling by in the other direction. Ray dives out of the way.
IN THE ROAD
Ray is exposed. He sees his truck closing fast. He's got nowhere to
go. Then, at the very last second,
RAY
jumps off the edge of the road. His TRUCK SLAMS INTO THE BARRIER RIGHT
WHERE RAY WAS STANDING. SPARKS FLY! METAL BUCKLES!
Ray falls through the air. Lands hard on his leg. Tumbles down the
hill, finally stopping with a crash. He lies motionless at the bottom
of a ravine.
FADE OUT:
Karla exits the building. She watches Julie sitting on the curb.
A truck turns onto the street. Julie looks hopeful, but -- it's not
Ray.
Karla approaches her friend.
KARLA
Girl, it's gettin' down to the wire.
Julie turns.
JULIE
He's not coming. I thought he was
just...
KARLA
Julie, you left four messages...
Four.
JULIE
But, he said he'd try.
KARLA
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe.
Try is nothing!
JULIE
(appoligizing for him)
He does work hard.
KARLA
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your
heart just because he can.
(hesitant)
And I don't want to have to say I
told you so...
JULIE
Then, don't.
A Jeep Cherokee stops, and an ebullient Tyrell steps out wearing
shorts and a Hawaiian shirt.
TYRELL
Hey, baby, we gonna get tropical or
we gonna get tropical?
The passenger door opens and Will Benson steps hesitantly around the
Jeep.
JULIE
Oh!
KARLA
(re: Will)
Hey, sorry...
(quick, playing it off)
He's my friend, too. And that ticket
is not going to waste.
Will reads Julie's expression.
WILL
Julie, is everything cool? Karla
said...
KARLA
I said we start having fun. And that
means now.
Julie takes a last look up the street. She stands.
TYRELL
Is there a problem here?
KARLA
Where there's a Will, there's a
way. Come on.
JULIE
(deciding)
You know what? This rocks. We're
going to the Bahamas!
Will is relieved.
KARLA
(getting into the spirit)
We goin' Bahamas, I'm Ty's Bahama
Mama. We goin' Bahamas...
She bops over to Tyrell.
CUT TO:
A wide-body jet SCREAMS through the clouds.
Establishing. A Board of Tourism kind of shot. Blue water. Green
islands. Golden sun. Puffy clouds.
A BOAT CHUGS by with the words "Tower Bay" painted on the side.
Tyrell THROWS UP over the side.
More of a small tub than a ferry. Julie, Karla, Will, and Tyrell are
the only passengers.
At the bow, Julie and Karla laugh and play "King of the World." Julie
in the prow, Karla behind her.
JULIE
(deadpan)
I'm the King of the World.
KARLA
(deadpan)
No, I'm the King of the World.
They switch places. They look at each other and crack up laughing.
Karla takes in the surroundings, the salt spray, the day --
KARLA
Remind me to study real hard so
someday this is normal and all that
back there is somethin' I do for a
weekend once every ten years.
JULIE
(sharing the moment)
I will, and you remind me of the same
thing.
They throws their arms around each other and stare into the horizon.
AT THE STERN
Will talks to a very green Tyrell.
WILL
You just gotta breathe.
Tyrell is trying to keep from puking --
TYRELL
Can't talk right now.
WILL
(slightly malicious)
See, it's not a macho thing. It's
about equilibrium in your inner ear.
You could've used a patch, but it's
too late now. Get used to it.
(then)
Some folks just can't sail.
PAULSEN, the BOAT CAPTAIN, overhears as he passes --
PAULSEN
That's too bad, too, because it's the
only way on or off the island.
(slightly ominous)
Unless you have an accident. And then
they call the Coast Guard.
Julie and Karla have rejoined the men.
JULIE
It's pretty remote here.
PAULSEN
(smiles)
Yep. That's what the tourists pay for
-- sun, sea, and solitude.
TYRELL
Are we there yet?
PAULSEN
Few more minutes.
We move off the boat and REVEAL the island. The intrepid vacationers
excitedly take in the island.
CUT TO:
Establishing. An isolated tropical paradise with jungle growing to the
beach.
The ferry pulls in to a canopied dock. A white-sand beach stretches in
every direction. Beautiful tourists stroll about without a care in the
world.
Tyrell stamps his feet on the dock.
TYRELL
I feel like I'm still on that thing.
A dockhand, DERRICK, glides past him toward the ladies.
DERRICK
That way for a complimentary Planter's
Punch to get you readjusted.
TYRELL
(mile-wide smile)
I can get used to this.
Derrick reaches for Julie's hand, clearly checking her out in the
process.
DERRICK
Welcome, Fair Princess, to Tower Bay.
(a wink)
I'm Derrick. At your service for the
duration of your stay.
Julie smiles politely. Will gently nudges her on. They walk away.
PAULSEN
(to Derrick, mocking)
I'm at your service, Princess.
DERRICK
(shrugs)
Season's over old man. So I gotta
work fast.
PAULSEN
If Marine Radio's right about the
weather, you're already out of time.
He hangs a SIGN at the end of the gangplank. It reads: LAST DEPARTING
FERRY -- LINE FORMS HERE.
Our guys are already at the end of the dock.
CUT TO:
Establishing. An opulent, Carribean-style hacienda resort with all the
accoutrements.
The main building is two stories high with a tiled roof. A bell tower
rises from one side. And, of course, it is surounded on all sides by
suffocating fooliage.
Julie and Karla take in the beauty of the resort.
KARLA
Check it out.
TOW BIKINI GIRLS
catch the eyes of Tyrell and Will.
TYRELL
Yes, ma'am.
Karla THWACKS him on the back of the head, but they're all having fun.
The path widens. The trees part. It's even nicer up close. They walk
across a tiled plaza.
Behind them, THREE YOUNG GUYS carry their GIRLFRIENDS piggyback,
racing each other toward the departure dock.
Our two arriving couples move on toward the entrace, passing a FENCED
TENNIS COURT on the left. A GLASS-PANED ORCHID HOUSE straight ahead.
And, on the right,
A LUSH POOL with a built-in JACUZZI in the shallow end. An outdoor
THATCHED ROOF BAR stands nearby -- and just beyonk it, a small POOL
HOUSE.
A guy's unintelligible RASTA VOICE calls out --
RASTA VOICE
Anybudorsomethin'?
They turn to see TITUS, white guy, dreads, full-Rasta demeanor. He's a
phony, but sincere about it.
Titus approaches Tyrell --
TITUS
My brother, can I interest you in the
islands finest ganja?
WILL
(teasing)
Hey, Tyrell, we found you brother.
TYRELL
(wry)
Not possible.
TITUS
(undetered)
Who be wantin' the kind, the uber-
sticky, the Bwana, The depth-charge,
the Up-All-Night-Laughing-With-Your-
Friends? Who wants it? 'Cause Titus got
it.
WILL
No, thanks.
TITUS
Come on, man. Everybody wants something.
Will and Tyrell walk on. Undetered, Titus goes up to Karla and Julie.
TITUS (cont'd)
How 'bout you, ladies? Lovely ladies.
Titus moves his hips.
TITUS (cont'd)
(lascivious)
Something I can do for you?
Karla looks him up and down, wrinkles her nose --
KARLA
Take a bath, maybe.
TITUS
That's cold, but if that's how you
want it.
The group moves on. Titus watches them go --
TITUS (cont'd)
(yelling after them)
Anybudorsomethin' you come and see me.
OMIT SCENE 21 & SCENE 22
CUT TO:
Around TWENTY TO THIRTY GUESTS ARE ON THEIR WAY OUT as Julie and the
others walk in. Julie smiles at an old PORTER helping the departing
guests with their bags. He doesn't smile back.
Will looks down at his wet pants.
WILL
(soto)
Dork.
Passing Karla and Tyrell's room on his way down the hall, Will spots
the DO NOT DISTURB SIGN.
He hears an INCREDIBLE POUNDING from inside. He shakes his head and
mopes down the hall.
CUT TO:
Derrick, the dockhand, whistles in the darkness as he coils the bow
rope of a service boat around a cleat on the dock.
Ominous shadows play all along the dock. Out on the water there's a
big SPLASH.
The dockhand rises, looking out at the water with a sigh.
DERRICK
Damn. I should've brought my pole.
He turns away. As he does, we see
THE END OF THE DOCK
where a sinister SLICKER FIGURE stands perfectly still, silhouetted by
moonlight.
Derrick paces down the dock the other way past a handfull of other
tied-off staff and service boats.
He picks up a hose and begins spraying down the hull of a Sunfish
sailboat.
He turns the hose off and begins coiling it, backing toward an
EQUIPMENT SHACK. Suddenly, a HAND touches him on the back. He jumps
and turns to see --
TITUS
standing there smoking a spliff.
DERRICK
Get lost, you scared me.
TITUS
Fish are all over the water...Come on,
let us take a boat out.
DERRICK
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up
in Spain.
TITUS
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
Derrick throws the hose in its place.
DERRICK
There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats
are going out.
TITUS
Storm is what makes it interesting.
Thass why all the fish are up. Less
hook us a couple big ones.
Derrick is now ignoring Titus.
DERRICK
I got work to do. Take the bake
elsewhere.
TITUS
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
Titus glides away into the dark. Derrick watches him go. There's
another SPLASH in the water near the dock.
Derrick walks to where the splash was. He kneels down by the edge --
watching BUBBLES RISE from the dark water below.
DERRICK
(to the fish)
Hello, little sea bass. You're lucky
I'm busy or I'd hook you myself.
WE PUSH IN AS HIS FACE GETS CLOSER TO THE WATER --
AND THEN -- RISING SLOWLY FROM THE DARK WATER DIRECTLY BEHIND THE
DOCKHAND -- A SINISTER SLICKER.
Derrick hears A SPLASH -- and just in time for...
SPLAT! THE OLD HOOK IN THE EYE. THE FISHERMAN PULLS HIM DOWN. HE
SCREAMS -- BEN YANKS ON THE HOOK -- AND DERRICK'S CRUMPLED BODY FALLS
INTO THE WATER.
ANGLE ON THE WATER
as poor Derrick's BLOOD MIXES WITH BUBBLES...
CUT TO:
Bubbles of a different kind. The JACUZZI sits in an enclosure at the
shallow end of the SWIMMING POOL.
And enjoying its warmth, Karla and Tyrell are liplocked in the
churning tub. MUSIC plays on the boombox beside them.
The tempurature rises and Ty's hands begin to wander. Still clad in
her cute bikini, Karla pulls away --
KARLA
You sure you didn't pick up my hair
tie?
TYRELL
(rubbing his bald head)
Hello?
KARLA
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my
hair wet.
TYRELL
Baby, I finally got you alone in this
Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin'
hair care.
She splashes him.
KARLA
Don't you get feisty...
Tyrell moves in for the kill. He won't take no for an answer.
TYRELL
Too late for that. We're miles from
anywhere, baby. No one's gonna hear
you scream.
He goes in for a serious kiss. Things start to heat up --
KARLA
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to
have to blow my whistle.
TYRELL
(playful)
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your
whistle.
Tyrell is done talking. He pulls her over to him and the moment
becomes more passionate.
Karla opens her eyes in time to see --
TITUS
surface in the pool next to them.
Karla SCREAMS. And not just because it was a surprise. Titus looks
even uglier when he's wet.
Titus opens his mouth, reveals a smoking PHILLY BLUNT on the end of
his tounge.
TITUS
No water sports after midnight. Hotel
policy.
Titus eyes Karla in the Jacuzzi. Tyrell moves protectively in front of
her.
TYRELL
What's the policy on burnin' herb?
TITUS
We got one for that, too. It's don't
try until you buy.
(beat)
You don't buy any, you don't get any.
Titus blows a cloud of smoke on them both, rolls the joint back into
his mouth, and swims off. Tyrell is angry, but Karla pulls him back.
A dejected Will appears in his bathing suit, a towel over his arm.
Tyrell sees him coming.
TYRELL
There's ten people on this whole island
and they're all gonna end up in this
Jacuzzi with us.
WILL
(getting in)
How's the water?
TYRELL
Crowded.
KARLA
Ty!
Will slips into the water ignoring Tyrell's look.
WILL
Ahh, that feels great.
KARLA
(considerate)
How's Julie?
WILL
Alone. In the room.
(to Karla)
Got any advise?
TYRELL
(annoyed)
Yeah. Find another Jacuzzi.
Karla shoots Tyrell a look.
KARLA
(to Will)
Your not out yet, slugger. You gotta
just get back up there and keep
swingin'.
CUT TO:
Ray is at a telephone booth up the street from Julie's apartment.
He looks exausted. Blood seeps through his shirt. He's in pain.
RAY
I need an international operator.
CUT TO:
Karla and Tyrell are drying off beside Will as their hysterical friend
comes racing across the pool plaza.
JULIE
It's happening again! There's a body!
Will cathes her in his arms and she sobs uncontrollably.
WILL
What? What are you talking about?
Where?
JULIE
It's in my room!
They can see she's not fooling around.
BACK TO:
And we PULL AWAY from Julie's face through the glass -- SLOWLY TILTING
above her room to another
TINY WINDOW
in the bell tower. A candle burns, and lighning flashes illuminate the
haggard face of Estes, the porter.
CUT TO:
Establishing. Bars on the windows. Neon PAWN fickering. Hand-painted
sign reads: Se Habla Ingles.
Will and Tyrell exit the hotel and make their way down the steps
outside and go splashing across the flooded grounds. Debris from the
storm is scattered all around them.
TYRELL
They're around...They just don't
care about us 'cause we're the
contest winners.
(beat)
Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his
lazy butt hook us up with fishing
poles or Ping-Pong paddles or
something.
WILL
(nervous)
You know, the greenhouse effect has
caused the gulf stream to shift and
almost every meteorological expert
expects a dramatic increase in
tropical depression --
TYRELL
Hey -- shut up, okay?
Tyrell keeps walking. Will looks around at the wind-and-water-swept
vista. Not much of a day for activities.
WILL
(sotto)
I don't like to fish.
Tyrell moves across the grounds. He looks back. Will is stopped in his
tracks, looking up at --
IN THE WINDOW OF THE BELL TOWER --
ESTES, staring down at them.
TYRELL
(calling to Will)
You coming?
Will trots after him, but he takes a glance back at the window...Estes
is gone.
CUT TO:
Tyrell looks across the grounds and sees, at the far end of the tennis
court,
TITUS'S POOL SUPPLY CART
half-obscured by the heavy fooliage surrounding the court.
Tyrell walks away from Will toward the cart. He hears the jam-box on
the cart playing "TRENCHTOWN ROCK" by Bob Marley..."One good thing
about music...when it hits you feel no pain..."
The open door of the entrance CLANGS against the fence in the wind.
Tyrell decides to cut through the court to the far entrance and the
cart.
Tyrell angrily makes his way past the outdoor pool bar as Will
follows. Tyrell spots a tray of empty bottles. He picks one up and
smashes it in half on the ground. He holds out the jagged bottle to
Will.
TYRELL
Take this.
WILL
And do what with it?
Tyrell breaks another bottle in half.
TYRELL
Julienne of pool boy.
They move toward the nearby POOL HOUSE.
Tyrell and Will stop outside the door. There's MUSIC from inside. More
Bob Marley -- "Lively Up Yourself..."
TYRELL (cont'd)
I'm gonna throw the door. Get ready.
Tyrell opens the door and charges in. Will's right behind him.
The two of them collapse, COUGHING and CHOKING.
TYRELL
What the -- ?
Will splashes a puddle of rainwater on his face --
WILL
That's chlorine and muriatic acid.
Put the two together and you get
cyanide.
Tyrell rolls over on his back next to Will, practically coughing up a
lung.
TYRELL
Cyanide? Like poison gas?
(reality dawning)
You mean, somebody really killed
him...Omigod. Think...Think...
Suddenly, they both hear KARLA SCREAMING. They sprint for the main
building.
CUT TO:
Tyrell and Will follow Karla's CRIES to a narrow srip of basement
window which runs along the side of the hotel. Her palms have bloodied
one of the windows.
TYRELL
Get back --
Karla tumbles to the ground with only one thing to say.
KARLA
(screaming)
Julie!
SMASH CUT TO:
Julie runs down the steps and cuts through the blowing palms.
CUT TO:
Julie is at the end of the dock. Tears are streaming down her face,
her chest heaving.
The others catch up with her. Karla realizes the boats are gone.
Everyone is freaking out.
KARLA
There were boats here? Refresh my
memory, there were boats...
Tyrell picks up the end of a cut mooring line --
TYRELL
They were cut loose.
WILL
Julie? Wanna tell us what is
going on here?
They look at Julie. Their escape is cut off by water. They're scared.
JULIE
(freaking out)
We're all going to die. He's going
to kill us one by one.
TYRELL
Who?
JULIE
Ben Willis.
KARLA
(not this again)
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed
him. Now, get over it. We gotta
think here.
JULIE
They never found the body.
Her voice is low and urgent, an impromptu confessional.
JULIE (cont'd)
Two summers ago. We lied to the
authorities. We hit Ben Willis with
our car. Ray, me, Barry, and Helen
...We threw the body in the water to
cover it up --
KARLA
Julie...
JULIE
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry
and Helen last July Fourth.
Tyrell begins backing away from Julie. He picks up a piece of
driftwood from the dock.
JULIE (cont'd)
I thought Ray and I killed him on the
boat, but we didn't and now he's back
to finish up the job.
Tyrell holds up the log as a weapon. He's angry and afraid --
TYRELL
We're on an island, miles from
anywhere. I don't give a crap about
you're fisherman. There's dead bodies
pilling up everywhere and there's one
guy missing --
Will moves closer to Tyrell --
WILL
The porter...what's his name? Old
Asbestos --
TYRELL
Estes! That's exactly who it is. That
old guy knows something. We can sit
here and wait for him to pick us off
or we can go find him first.
Tyrell turns and heads down the dock. Will goes with him. Karla takes
a few hesitant steps after them, then turns back toward Julie, who
hasn't moved.
KARLA
Julie, we have to do something.
Julie sees her friend caught in the middle, sees her suffering. She
reluctantly starts for Karla --
JULIE
(sotto)
It's not him.
CUT TO:
Establish. The rain pounds a fleet of fishing boats. The boats are
securely battened down in the weather.
Ray limps past, heading for a small building at the end of the dock.
Its sign reads: Island Ferry, Jack Paulsen -- proprieter.
CUT TO:
Estes, Will, Tyrell, Julie, and Karla walk along a trail through the
heart of the island. The storm has abated for a few minutes.
It's windy, dark, and spooky. The kind of place you'd take people if
you wanted to scare them with a classic ghost story. That is just what
Estes is doing.
ESTES
He worked here for many years. He
had a nice family. A pretty wife
and two little ones. A boy and a
girl. They'd be about your age, now.
They continue along the path.
Estes looks at them in the dark, slowing for just a second.
ESTES (cont'd)
One day his wife went missing. Maid
found blood all over the honeymoon
suite -- Room 201.
There are strange NOISES out in the woods.
ESTES (cont'd)
Eventually, they found her body.
Pieces. A leg in the swamp. An arm
washed up on Three Mile Beach.
(beat)
And the head they found much later.
A huge branch is blown from a tree and comes crashing down through the
underbrush, scaring them. Estes calmly steps around it.
ESTES (cont'd)
Careful --
JULIE
(softly)
Did he do it?
ESTES
People say she was running around on
him. People say he caught her in bed
with other men. People say a lot of
things.
(beat)
He disappeared, taking the two small
ones with him. At least they were
never found.
The winding path leads to a small orchard. They hang on his every
word.
ESTES (cont'd)
We're here.
In the center of the orchard is a cemetery.
They move off the path into the safety of the woods. There seems to be
activity around the place. It's silent and eerie.
Julie stares, fascinated. She is slowly drawn toward the house. Karla
grabs for her arm.
KARLA
Be careful, Julie.
JULIE
I've got to see.
She leads, they follow, circling the house. Julie rounds a corner of
the shack and stops. She sees --
TWO TOMBSTONES
The first stone reads: SARAH WILLIS (birth/death)
The second stone reads: SUSIE WILLIS (birth/death)
Beyond them
A FRESHLY DUG GRAVE
and the group moves slowly toward it. The headstone, partially
obscured by the mound of dirt, comes into view.
The third headstone reads:
JULIE JAMES
born September 6, 1979
died July 4, 1998
"A Lying Whore"
"A Lying Whore" is scratched with a knife.
KARLA
(realizing)
...Today's July fourth.
Will goes to comfort Julie --
JULIE
I'm not dying on this island,
Will.
(louder)
Do you hear me?
Julie shouts into the darkness.
JULIE (cont'd)
You want me, Ben Willis? Come and
get me. I'm right here.
She kicks over her headstone --
JULIE (cont'd)
My grave stays empty!
She looks defiantly down the path.
KARLA
Julie, the boats are gone, the
phones are down. There's no way off
this place.
JULIE
Then, we fight --
Will looks around. Estes is gone.
WILL
Where'd Estes go?
TYRELL
What is up with that weirdo?
WILL
I'll go find him.
KARLA
Why? He can't help us.
WILL
He's probably the only one who
can help us.
TYRELL
I'll come with you.
KARLA
Are you crazy? We're not staying
here on our own.
WILL
It's okay. He couldn't have gone
far. I'll catch up with you later.
Will disappears into the darkness.
KARLA
Maybe we should just wait here?
Hide in a tree?
TYRELL
I'm not hiding up no tree.
(to Julie)
I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves
to the teeth and kick this psycho's
butt.
CUT TO:
Will runs from the trees and finds himself by an old house. He sees
Estes by the ocean, near a boat.
WILL
Hey Estes.
(beat)
Estes? Where'd you go?
Estes doesn't answer right away -- he keeps his back to Will.
WILL (cont'd)
You abandoning us? How come you
didn't tell us you had a boat?
Estes picks up the boat's oar. He speaks low, almost inaudibly.
ESTES
This has to end. Now.
WILL
What -- ?
Estes swings the oar, cracking Will's head hard.
SMASH CUT TO:
Ray pilots the boat through the dark, choppy water. He's navigating by
compass, maps spread before him. He sees something off the bow --
A BOAT
drifting on the fast sea. The words "Tower Bay" are painted on the
side. Ray pulls alongside and discovers the boat is empty.
He reaches for the radio.
RAY
(into radio)
Come in...This is Summer Breeze
requesting emergency assistance for
Tower Bay island. I repeat...This
is Summer Breeze...
Ray guns the boat away.
SMASH CUT TO:
Karla backs onto the porch. She backs up against the railing.
CUT TO:
Julie and Nancy reach the CATHEDRAL WINDOW. They open it and look out.
and Ben advancing toward Karla, whose back is against the railing.
Karla looks behind her, sees
THE GLASS ROOF OF THE ORCHID HOUSE
which doesn't look nealy strong enough to suppor her.
Ben advances, swining the hook. Karla leaps over the railing and onto
the glass.
Karla keeps a wary eye on Ben as she gingerly backs up on the glass.
The GLASS begins CRACKING, subtle crack lines splintering out from her
footsteps.
Ben lunges and swipes at her with his hook.
Karla leans away from the attack and loses her balance, slipping onto
her back on the glass.
She lifts her head. Starts to move...CRACK. The glass is fracuring
beneath her. She looks through the glass.
KARLA'S POV - THE ORCHIDS BELOW
She tries to slide toward a support...The glass CREAKS and MOANS as
she moves across the room.
KARLA
(to herself)
Oh, god, no --
She's almost to the support when
THE ROOF EXPLODES
taking Karla down into the orchid house.
Julie, Karla, and Nancy approach the iron door to the underground
storm cellar. Julie carries the axe.
NANCY
It's over there.
They struggle together to open the heavy door.
Will is already on the move toward the hotel.
WILL
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
JULIE
Did you get help?
Will shakes his head. He's walking woozily.
JULIE (cont'd)
What happened?
WILL
Estes came after me with a gaffing
hook.
JULIE
He's in it with Willis?
WILL
I guess so.
Julie points out that his chest and stomach are covered in blood, too.
JULIE
Your stomach, you're hurt --
Will looks down, clutches himself, and keeps moving.
WILL
When I was coming back I saw your
slicker friend looking for you guys
down by the water.
(beat)
Let's hurry and get inside...
CUT TO:
Ray guns the boat straight up onto the beach. He leaps from the boat.
CUT TO:
Will pulls Julie along a muddy path in the rain. He's got her by the
hair. She's slipping and falling.
WILL
Look at the bright side, Jules. We
finally get to spend some quality
time together.
Julie's trying to get to the knife she's stashed in her back pocket.
JULIE
Why are you doing this to me?
WILL
Me, me, me. It's always about you.
I'm having bad dreams. I can't
sleep. I'm not doing well in school.
I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
JULIE
I trusted you.
WILL
We had a connection, didn't we? I
can tell you one thing, though. Ray
didn't trust me. He was right. He's
dead, but he was right.
They come into the orchard. They are covered in mud. Julie stumbles
again. Goes to her knees. Works the knife free and slashes up at Will.
She slices him across the face.
He steps back, feels the blood.
WILL (cont'd)
What'd you have to do that for?
There is a creepy pause. Will stares at his own blood. She catches her
breath...
Then suddenly, Will knocks the knife from her hand. He lifts her by
the hair. Enraged, he puches her in the face. She goes down.
CUT TO:
Will has Julie in a choke hold. He drags her toward the open graves.
Julie is losing energy, slowly giving up.
JULIE
...Why?
WILL
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll
get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
He shoves her. She falls backward into the arms of Ben Willis.
WILL (cont'd)
Hi, Dad.
Julie WAILS, struggling wildly in Ben's grasp.
JULIE
OMIGOD --
BEN
That's my boy.
Ben holds her back to look at her. He throws back the hood of his
slicker. We see his face clearly for the first time.
JULIE
No, no, no --
Ben pulls off his hook and strokes Julie's cheek with his stump.
BEN
Shush, now. No more screaming...No
more running. Time to die.
RAY (v.o.)
Let go of her! Now!
Ben and Will spin to see
RAY
like the hero from a western, step out from behind a tree.
Ben starts to laugh. Will joins him.
WILL
You gotta be kiddin' me.
BEN
What're you gonna do, boy? Call
us names?
RAY
Let her go. Now.
Ray raises the .38 caliber handgun. He COCKS the hammer.
Ben doesn't let go of Julie. Lightning fast, he slaps his hook back on
and gets the point to Julie's neck.
BEN
Think about it, boy. You're no
killer.
(beat)
That's my job.
Ray hesitates, his finger on the trigger. He does look scared.
Ben takes a step toward Ray. Then another, pushing Julie in front of
him. Will moves closer, too.
RAY
Stop right there.
Ray's finger squeezing down the trigger.
BEN
You don't have it in you.
Suddenly, Will dives for Ray. Ray gets a shot off, tagging Ben in the
shoulder. The gun goes flying.
Julie spins and hits Ben in the face. He knocks her into her own
grave...Mud begins to slide in on her. She tries to scramble out.
Will and Ray wrestle, punching each other repeatedly in the face.
Will has Ray down and his hands around his kneck. He looks him in the
eye.
WILL
We haven't missed you down here,
Ray boy. I got to know Julie real
well.
Will gets the better of Ray. He's stronger. He yanks him up -- choking
him. Ray is begging to check out.
WILL (cont'd)
Think of all the things I'm gonna
do to her.
(beat)
Dad, finish him.
Ben charges toward Ray's back. He pulls back the hook for a roundhouse
slashing --
At the last second, Ray dips, elbows Will.
THE HOOK
goes straight into Will's chest.
The fisherman has hooked his own son.
Father and son make final eye contact, the son's eyes go blank.
Ben stares in shock as Will expires, falling back into the mud.
Ben SCREAMS in rage. Ray is tired.
THWACK. Ben begins beating Ray. He puches him. He straight-arms him
with the hook. He knocks him again and again and Ray is beaten, giving
up...
Ben has Ray against a tombstone. The hook slowly inches toward his
eye.
BEN
Gonna blind you first.
The hook is touching the eyelid --
A GUNSHOT
rings out. A look of wonder crosses Ben's face. He slowly turns away
from Ray.
JULIE
stands behind him holding the gun.
JULIE
Just...Die.
BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. She empties the gun into Ben, who flies backward
into Julie's grave.
As he tumbles, Ben releases the dirt stacked beside the grave...
A MUDDY LANDSLIDE
slowly covers Ben up.
Ben's face is covering over. His mouth starting to fill with dirt --
BEN
You can't kill me.
His face is completely covered. His mouth still moving.
BEN (cont'd)
I'll always be with you.
The dirt covers him. It continues to fill, until just the
GLEAMING METAL HOOK
waves futilely out of the dirt. Then, is stops wiggling.
Julie goes to Ray.
CUT TO:
Ray and Julie limp across the grounds of the hotel. They are moving
past some shrubbery when
A DARK FIGURE
jumps out. Julie yells. She and Ray jump back.
KARLA
stops in the middle of her kamikaze attack, knife held out.
KARLA
Oh, god, it's you --
JULIE
You're okay. Thank god.
KARLA
Is he?
They nod. They go to her -- jubilant group hug time. They compose
themselves.
KARLA (cont'd)
You know, it's true what they say
about package vacations...You get
what you pay for.
(beat)
Now, how about we get off this piece
of crap island.
The first rays of the morning sun appear. Ray looks adoringly at Julie
as the beautific light catches her face.
Ray kisses her. She kisses him back. They are silhouetted against a
beautiful orange sunrise.
JULIE
(smiling)
We don't have to tell anyone it
rained the whole time. It can just
be our little secret.
The three of them throw their arms around each other's shoulders and
they start walking for the beach as...
A COAST GUARD HELICOPTER
rises into view.
MATCH CUT TO:
Establish. The sun setting over a quaint street in a college town.
SUPERTITLE:			FOUR MONTHS LATER
Julie pedals her bicycle down the street. She has a book bag over her
shoulder. It feels like one of the first days of school.
She rides the bike up to a small house on the perfect street. She
rolls the bike right up to the front door.
CUT TO:
