            A grilled-cheese sandwich begins to smoke in a fry pan on
          the stove, REVEALING JOHNNY, who has his back to this
            impending culinary disaster.  At the moment, he's caught
          up in one of those mind-numbing, home shopping INFOMERCIALS
          on television.

          A way too happy MAN and WOMAN demonstrate their new miracle
          product.

                                        MAN (ON TV)
                        Folks, this truly is a miracle
                          product.  It cooks, grills, fries,
                        steams and smokes any meat, fish,
                        poultry and vegetable product you
                        can imagine.

          Johnny has a pen and pad in hand.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (impatiently waits)
                        Just give me the damn phone number.

                                        MAN (ON TV)
                        We're going to give you that phone
                        number in just a few minutes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Aw, come on!

                                        MAN (ON TV)
                        Right now, Rhonda, my lovely
                          assistant is going to demonstrate
                        the patented self-cleaning
                        mechanism.  Rhonda...

          Johnny suddenly smells smoke and turns to SEE THE SANDWICH
          BURNING.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Aw, geez!

          He hurries back to the stove and reaches for the handle
          of the pan -- OUCH! -- too hot.  The SMOKE BUILDS in the
          kitchen.

          The DOORBELL RINGS!


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "THE COLLECTOR" - TEASER - 1/13/05 - WHITE-2   2.

          Johnny shuts off the burner then grabs a dish towel and
          dumps the smoking pan into the sink.

          The DOORBELL RINGS again!

                                        JOHNNY
                          Terrific.  It's probably the fire
                          department.

          He tosses the dish towel in the sink and MOVES through
          the thick smoke towards the front door.



          Johnny OPENS the door to find SARAH.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sarah?  This is a surprise.

                                        SARAH
                        I was in the area.  Is everything
                        okay?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Terrific.  I was just fixing lunch.



          Johnny opens a window, fanning the smoke out with the
          dish towel.  Sarah checks the damage in the sink.

                                        SARAH
                        What was it supposed to be?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Grilled cheese.

                                        SARAH
                        You seem to have the 'grilled'
                        part figured out.  Ever think
                        about getting a housekeeper?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Every time I get hungry.

          They share a smile.

                        So, what's up?

                                        SARAH
                        JJ mentioned something about an
                        old baseball glove you said he
                        could use.

                                        JOHNNY
                        My father gave it to me before he
                        died.  You didn't have to come
                        all the way over here.  I could
                        have dropped it by your place.

          Johnny can see there's something else on her mind.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Unless, there's something else on
                        your mind?

                                        SARAH

                        Or a friend.



          They step out from the kitchen...

                                        SARAH
                        I've been doing some volunteer
                        counseling down at the woman's
                          outreach center.  They have a
                        program for homeless women.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sounds terrific.

                                        SARAH
                        It is.  Truth is, I think I get
                        more out of it than the women in
                        the program do.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How do you mean?

                        give back.

                        There's a girl, her name is Erica. 
                        I've been helping her through the
                        job training program.  A few days
                        ago she just stopped showing up. 
                        I have this terrible feeling.

                                        JOHNNY
                        A feeling?

                        That she's out there somewhere...
                        in trouble.

          Off this moment of decision, we're...



          A local under-funded social work operation.  Flat lighting. 
          Donated furniture, mismatched chairs, broken copy machine.

          YOUNG WOMEN being trained to do secretarial jobs.  Some
          have BABIES with them.  Sarah shows Johnny around.

                                        SARAH
                        The center operates almost
                          exclusively on private funding.

          It's both sad and encouraging.  She guides him to a cubicle
          with a COMPUTER.

                        This was Erica's work station.

          Johnny sets his jacket down and starts moving around the
          station, gently using his hands to touch things, the chair,
          the desk and then the keyboard as WHOOSH --



          Johnny stands in a perfectly decorated room.  With a silk
          floral bedspread and matching pillows trimmed in delicate
          lace.  The matching curtains are also trimmed in lace. 
          It's like something built for a storybook princess.

          There's a small vanity table against one wall.  Johnny
          steps around to find a terrified young woman, ERICA (19). 
          She's on the floor against the door.

                                        ERICA
                                (crying)
                        Let me out of here!  You hear me! 

          She gives up and sinks against the door.



          Johnny snaps out of the vision.  Sarah reads the bothered
          expression on his face.

                                        SARAH
                        Did you see something?

          FADE IN:


          We open on Sarah handing Walt a photograph of her and the
          missing girl, Erica.

                                        SARAH
                        This picture was taken a few weeks
                        ago at the community center.

          Walt passes it to Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's the girl I saw in my vision.

                                        WALT
                        You have no idea where she was
                        being held?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It looked like a little girl's
                          bedroom.  Could be anywhere.

                                        WALT
                          I checked the emergency call
                        center.  No one named Erica Carlson
                        has been reported missing.  If
                        that's even her real name.

                                        SARAH
                        Why would she lie?

                        Most of these women come from
                        abusive relationships.  Some of
                        them don't want to be found. 
                        Sarah, do you remember anything
                        this girl might have said? 
                          Somebody bothering her.  An old
                          boyfriend maybe.

                                        SARAH
                        She didn't really talk about her
                          personal life.  I should have
                        tried to get closer.

          She's clearly upset.

                                        WALT
                        I'll take the picture out on the
                          streets, see if anybody recognizes
                        her.

                        I'll go with you.

          Walt puts his hand on Sarah's shoulder.

                                        WALT
                        We'll do everything we can to
                        find her.



          Erica's on the floor, hair askew.  Suddenly, the lighting
          in the room shifts, as several powerful wall mounted flood
          lights kick on, blasting a powerful white light directly
          into her face.  She HEARS the lock opening outside.  As
          the door swings slowly open we see the silhouette of a
          MAN.  Erica lifts her head, still unable to see much
          because of the lighting.

                                        MAN'S VOICE
                        Don't look at me.

          Erica does as she's told, looking down at the floor.

                                        ERICA
                        I want to go home.  I won't tell
                        anyone, I promise.

          A pair of SNAKE SKIN COWBOY BOOTS step silently into the
          room (of course, we don't see the person wearing them). 
          The boots step forward, passing just inches away from her
          as they move to a closet against the far wall.

                                        ERICA
                        I'm hungry.

          A MAN'S HAND wearing a coiled snake ring reaches for the
          closet door and opens it.

                                        ERICA
                                (she begins to cry)
                        Please, I just want to go home.

          The ringed hand traces across a row of neatly hung party
          dresses, finally selecting a yellow one with green flowers. 
          He pulls it off the hanger.

                                        ERICA
                        I'll do whatever you ask.  Just
                          don't...

          The man tosses the dress down on the floor in front of
          her.

          The unseen kidnapper steps back across to the open door
          and turns to face her.


          ERICA'S POV - SLOWLY FOCUSING

          Erica steals a look at her unseen abductor, the bright
          lights making it nearly impossible to see him clearly.

                                        MAN'S VOICE
                        Get dressed and fix your face. 
                        There's make-up on the table.

          He closes the door as the lighting shifts back to the
          warmer overhead configuration.  Erica looks at the dress,
          then rises to find a box full of expensive make-up on the
          vanity table.



            Establishing.  It's the dive you'd expect.

                                        TAMI'S VOICE
                        Let me get this straight.



          Tami leads Johnny and Walt into the small, slightly
          disheveled room.  A few odd posters on the wall and a
          battered boom box on the dresser.

                        You can predict the winning Lotto
                          numbers, but you don't?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's complicated.

                        It's crazy.  What's the point of
                        having super-powers unless there's
                        some cash in it?

                        Step back and let the man do his
                        job.

          Johnny moves around the room, trying to pick up something.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How long have you lived here?

                        This place has been a transient

                        have a shot at The Publisher's
                          Clearing House jackpot?

          Johnny is zeroing in on the dresser.

                                        WALT
                        One more question and I'll predict
                        the next thirty days of your life. 
                        And trust me, Ed McMahon will not
                        be involved.

          Johnny touches the top dresser drawer, as WHOOSH --



          He's THROWN into a sensual FAST REWIND VISION...

          Tami is all around Johnny in various states of (un)dress
          with other "clients" in this one little room.  It's an
          absolute BLUR.  But the vision slows down at just the
          right moment...

          Erica, the missing girl, walks into the room, pulls out
          the top dresser drawer and lifts the false bottom to find
          some cash.



          Johnny comes out of the vision.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "THE COLLECTOR" - ACT ONE - 1/4/05 - YELLOW   12.

          He finds the false bottom in the top drawer.  It's empty.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You keep money hidden in here.

                                        TAMI
                        I used to leave Erica a few dollars
                        for pizza.

          He touches the false drawer and gets another quick HIT -



          Johnny comes out of the vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We should go.
                                (to Tami)
                        Thank you for your time.

          He and Walt move to the door.

                                        TAMI
                        Tell me one thing, will ya?

          Johnny turns.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If I can.

                                        TAMI
                        Is Erica ever coming back?

          The big question hangs in the air between them...



                                        JOHNNY
                          Assuming it has any connection to
                        Erica's disappearance.

          Walt can see that Johnny's getting pulled emotionally
          deeper into the case.

                                        WALT
                          I appreciate you getting involved
                        with this, John.  I know it means
                        a lot to Sarah.

          They start off again as the bus DRIVES towards it's next
          stop.  Johnny thinks back on his conversation with Sarah.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (fishing)
                        So, how are things at home these
                        days?

                                        WALT

                        Things are good.  Things are very
                        good.
                                (beat)
                        Why do you ask?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No reason.  No reason at all.
                                (beat, then)
                        Sarah did mention how you've been
                        working late.  How JJ's growing
                        up.

                                        WALT
                        Yeah?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Nothing.  Just making conversation,
                        that's all.

                        Seems kind'a strange she'd bring

                        just drop it.

                          mentioning.
                                (beat)
                        I think maybe she feels a little...

          Erica sits at a vanity wearing the yellow party dress. 
          She applies some eyeliner and stares at herself in the
          small round mirror.  It's as if she's preparing herself
          for something she can't or doesn't want to imagine.

          A pair of now familiar snake skin cowboy boots step in
          frame as we HEAR a BELL RING.

          The door slowly opens, as those familiar cowboy boots
          step into the open doorway.  But Erica's gone.  SHOT PANS
          up to REVEAL a MAN WEARING A CLEAR PLASTIC MASK.  It's
          terrifying in it's simplicity.  His eyes widen as he
          realizes the room is empty.

                                        ERICA'S VOICE
                        Lookin' for somebody?

          The MASKED MAN turns to his left and gets kicked hard in
          the crotch.  He doubles over, grabbing for Erica as she
          fights her way past him.  Even in pain, he's right behind
          her.



          Erica stumbles up the darkened hallway towards another
          closed door, as the Masked Man chases right behind her. 
          She can HEAR the DOORBELL RINGING as she starts to scream,
          but the man quickly grabs her from behind, his large hand
          over her mouth.  He drags her back up the hallway, as the
          BELL RINGS AGAIN.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        You look nice in that dress.



          The Unmasked Man pulls back the curtains and looks out a
            window...



          Those snake skin boots calmly stride towards the door as
          we hear the BELL RINGING.  He reaches for the doorknob,
          his other hand moving behind his back holding the plastic
          mask.  As he OPENS the door --          DEAD ZONE: "THE COLLECTOR" - ACT ONE - 1/13/05 - WHITE-2   18.



          The door opens to REVEAL a TEENAGE BOY holding a pizza
          box outside.  A small delivery truck sits parked behind
          him.

          A swarm of police activity has now come to a close.  Walt
          steps up to where Johnny is standing.  Linda and Rich
          nearby.

                          cooperative.  Thank you.

          Walt shakes their hands.  He looks at Johnny, who
          reluctantly shakes her hand too.



          It's the same room from Johnny's previous Vision.  He
          sees the girl on the floor, but when she looks up it's
          not Erica's face, it's Linda's.  A familiar, but affordable
          song can be heard in the background...



          WHOOSH.  We're out of the vision.  Johnny stares at Linda.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He took you, too.

          Linda pulls her hand away.

                                        LINDA
                        I beg your pardon?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You were abducted, weren't you?

                                        RICH
                        What are you talking about?  Who
                        are you?

          Walt looks at Johnny, then back at Linda...

                                        WALT
                        We're searching for a missing
                        girl, a possible kidnapping.  If
                        you have any information...

                                        LINDA
                        I don't know what you're talking
                        about.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's not true.

                                        RICH
                        I'm going to ask you to leave
                        now.  Both of you.

          Walt has no choice but to comply.

                                        WALT
                        He's right.  Let's go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw her.  I was there in the
                        room...

          Johnny stops as he realizes he can't force the issue any
          further.  He reluctantly walks away.



          Linda shuts the front door behind Walt and Johnny.  Rich
          sits down on his recliner in front of the TV.  Linda
          stands, her back slightly to him, her eyes transfixed out
          the front window.  She's been affected by the encounter
          in a silent, but profound way.

                                        RICH
                        That was strange.

                                        LINDA
                        Very.

                        I'm not sure.  Mistaken identity,
                        I'd imagine.

                                        RICH
                        Right.  That's probably what it
                        was.

          Rich zones in on the television, using the remote to 
          channel surf.  Linda stands near him, but thousands of
          miles away.  Her eyes begin to scan a group of framed
          photographs sitting on a table.

                                        RICH
                        You okay?


          INSERT - FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS

          Photographs of her life with Rich.  There's one constant
          image in every picture, the expression of numb discontent
          in Linda's eyes.  It's like looking at the ghost of
          herself.  Behind her Rich continues watching television.

                                        RICH

                        I'll be right there.

          The SHOT PUSHES TIGHTER on her as we see something shift.



          Walt and Johnny approach the cruiser.  Johnny seems
          deflated and frustrated.

                                        WALT
                        Don't beat yourself up.  Nobody's
                        right all the time.

                        I'm not wrong.  She's lying.

                                        WALT
                        What do you want me to do?  Arrest
                        her for denying a vision.

          Walt looks over at Roscoe, who's heading for his car.

                                        WALT

          Walt starts the car.

                          Something'll turn up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What if it doesn't?

          Walt considers that possibility, puts the car in DRIVE
          and hits the gas --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt!

          Walt sees it too and jams the brakes, REVEALING - Linda
          standing directly in front of the car, her eyes seem to
          be filled with a new resolve.

                                        LINDA
                        I can help you find the girl.

          Off this bizarre, unexpected moment --



          Linda sits with her hands folded neatly in front of her. 
          Walt and Johnny sit opposite her.  She gazes out at Rich
          in the adjoining room.  He sits quiet, seemingly oblivious
          to the situation as he reads a thick, sci-fi paperback
          novel.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He doesn't know what happened,
                        does he?

          A single tear rolls down her cheek, otherwise she appears
          remarkably unaffected.

                                        LINDA
                        He's a good man.  Decent.  He
                        won't understand this.

          She looks at him, then resumes her stoic pose.

                        Have you been to the Raintree
                        Motel?

                        It was three years ago December. 
                        It was a cold night.  The kind of
                        cold you feel deep down in your
                        bones.  It was late.  I'd been
                        working all night and I was tired. 
                          I crossed between two buildings
                        when he grabbed me.  He put his...

          She hesitates --

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's okay.  You're safe here.

          COLD AIR exhales from her lips.

                        He put his hand across my mouth. 
                          I smelled chemicals, then I blacked
                        out.  When I woke up, I was in
                        the dark...

          The camera SPINS around Linda --          DEAD ZONE: "THE COLLECTOR" - ACT TWO - 1/13/05 - WHITE-2   24.



          She wears the same clothes, in the same chair, but the
          room is DARK behind her.  We are in a lucid VISION.  The
          song "Chances Are" FADES UP in the background.  Her breath
          is visible.  Johnny is also in the room with her, touching
          her hands.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did he hurt you?

                        Not at first.  I was so frightened. 

          Linda breaks down into tears.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're doing great.  Just relax.

          Linda's whole appearance suddenly and magically CHANGES. 
            Perfectly placed makeup on her eyes, her hair no longer
          pulled back - but flows down to her shoulders (a wig). 
          She wears a powder blue dress with long sleeves.

                                        LINDA
                        He brought me pretty dresses and
                          expensive make-up.  He had a way
                        about him, gentle, but dangerous. 
                        There were times when I thought I
                        was the only woman left in the
                        world.  He punished me when I
                        made mistakes.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Mistakes?  What kind of mistakes?

          The faint sound of a TRAIN WHISTLE approaches.  Johnny
          scans the room.  Just a closed door.

                                        LINDA
                        "The dress must never be wrinkled. 
                          A neatly pressed dress makes for
                        a clean and presentable woman."

          There is a discomforting ease in the way she speaks.  The
          train whistle is coming closer...

                                        LINDA
                        "The makeup should be subtle. 
                        Too much makes a woman look cheap. 
                        Hair should be neatly combed and
                        above the shoulders..."

          The SCENE SPEEDS UP, FLASHING IMAGES, and then --          DEAD ZONE: "THE COLLECTOR" - ACT TWO - 1/13/05 - WHITE-2   24A.



          The room is dark as a man's hand slides firmly around her
          throat.  She drops to her knees and stares up at him. 
          The train whistle CRESCENDOS!

          bothered he is by the moment.

                        We just got a hit off the
                          photograph.  A positive ID on the
                        missing girl.

          Walt takes the slip of paper.

                          I better go call Sarah, tell her
                        not to hold dinner -- again.



          Sarah is sitting alone, playing her cello.  The PHONE
          RINGS.  She keeps playing.  More RINGS.  Finally, she
          answers it.

                                        SARAH
                        Hello.



                                        WALT
                        How's my beautiful wife?

                        Any news about Erica?

                        That's why I'm calling.  Bangor
                        P.D. got a positive match off the
                        photo.  Her real name is Erica
                        Carter.  There's a mother living
                        up near Glacier Lake.  They haven't
                        been able to make contact yet.

                        Glacier Lake?  That's less than
                        an hour from here. 
                                (beat)
                          I should have paid more attention.

                        We're so understaffed down at the
                        center, the phones don't even
                        work half the time... It's amazing
                        anybody ever gets helped.

          Johnny steps into the room --

                        I gotta go. -- Me too.  Bye.

          Walt sets the picture of Erica down on the desk, as the
          CAMERA PUSHES TIGHT on it.

                                               MATCH CUT TO:



          Sarah looks at the photo, then begins to play again.  We
          realize she has a plan.



          A Deputy walks in carrying a box of stuff.

                                        WALT
                        Is that from the Raintree?

                        Dusted the room for prints.

                                        WALT
                          Anything interesting?

                                        DEPUTY
                        Not unless you count two members
                        of the Cleaves Mills city council,
                        the Mayor's brother and the town
                        librarian.

          Johnny reaches into the box.  Picks up a few items, then
          a small TEDDY BEAR.  We CLOSE in on the teddy bear's button
          eyes...          DEAD ZONE: "THE COLLECTOR" - ACT TWO - 1/13/05 - WHITE-2   28.



          There's a small table in the center of the room and two
          wooden dining chairs.  The song "Chances Are..." by Johnny
          Mathis plays on a small record player.

          POV through the clear mask's eyes - think the opening of
          the film 'Halloween'.  We hear heavy BREATHS.

          Erica sits wearing the yellow dress.  Two candles are lit
          on the table. 

          Continue POV: The Masked Man uncovers a tray revealing
          plates of steak, potatoes, vegetables.  

          Erica reaches for the food, but the Man slams his hand
          down on the table.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        Napkin.

          RRRIP!

          Johnny is now in the room with them.  Observing.  The Man
            carefully cuts his meat, his eyes continually watching
          her through the mask.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        Eat. 

          Erica awkwardly picks up her fork.  There's a BEAT as she
          notices the steak the knife across the table from her. 
          Could she use it as a weapon?  Could she attack him from
          here and get away?  She contemplates her move, then decides
          to eat.  The Man suddenly FIXATES on the corner of her
          mouth.  Her lipstick seems to be a little off.

                        What? 

          His tone suddenly dark and angry as he sets down his knife
          and fork.

          He picks up her plate and SMASHES it against the wall. 
          She cowers from the debris coming off the wall.

          She notices the steak knife clatter down on to the floor
          a few feet away.  She isn't sure if, in his rage, her
          masked captor is aware of just how close she is to it.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        Look at yourself! 

          He forces her to look into a small hand-held mirror. 
          She's crying and trembling as she stares back at herself
          in the reflection.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        Does that look pretty?  Do you

                        you?!  Answer me!

          She's trying not to lose it completely, as she eyeballs
          the knife beneath her.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        You're just like the others. 
                        Imperfect.  Flawed.  Disgusting.  

 But she still has an eye on that knife.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        Stop your blubbering.

          She seizes the opportunity and grabs the knife off the
          floor, spins and LASHES out at him, ripping the mask off!

          But to our surprise it's JOHNNY SMITH underneath the mask.

          There's a DESPERATE STRUGGLE as he fights the knife out
          of her hand and forces her back into the seat.

                                        ERICA
                        I'm sorry.  I didn't mean it.

                                        JOHNNY/MASKED MAN
                        I show you kindness and this is
                        how you repay me.

                          I didn't see anything... I would
                        never say anything to anybody. 
                        Ever.

          He considers her for a moment.

          He steps around behind her, out of her sight.

          When he is REVEALED again, he's wearing the mask and Johnny
          appears again as an OBSERVER.

                        this time.  I promise.

          He picks up the plastic bag filled with cosmetics and
          dumps the contents on the table in front of her.

                        I'm afraid our lessons are over. 

          He gently touched her face from behind, the suddenly,
          he slips the PLASTIC BAG quickly over her head.  The
          CAMERA MOVES QUICKLY OFF HER as we HEAR her MUFFLED
          STRUGGLE and Johnny watches in horror.

          FADE IN:


          Walt and Johnny talk just outside of Walt's office. 

                                        WALT
                        And you have no idea if what you
                        saw is Erica's future or her past?  

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, but either way we can't stop
                          looking.

                        There's nothing about this guy
                        that feels remotely familiar.  He
                        takes his victims and then lets
                        them go.  He dresses them up and
                        tears them down.  It's crazy.

                                        JOHNNY

                        And now you tell me he's crossed
                        the line.  That he's killed this
                        girl.  Or he's going to, if we
                        don't stop him.  Hell, I'm not
                        even sure where to begin.

          Johnny stares through the window into Walt's office at
          Linda and gets an idea.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe we begin at the end.

          Off Linda sitting quietly --

                        were picked up? 



          Walt drives with Linda beside him and Johnny in the back.

          Linda stares out the window, a bleak sadness in her eyes.

                          I flagged down a passing truck.

                        This road runs thirty miles along
                        the river.  Another twenty minutes
                        and it's going to be dark.

          Johnny gets a frustrated look from Walt in the rear-view
          mirror.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Linda, if you could just --

          She suddenly notices a bullet riddled street sign --

          The car skids to an abrupt STOP.



          Johnny and Linda sit at a booth drinking coffee.  Linda
          has a sandwich she hasn't touched.  The diner is filled
          with late-night truckers and night owls.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're not eating.

                        Do you have any idea what it's
                        like to have your life torn in
                        half?  To measure every second of
                        your existence through the center

                          Surprisingly, I do.  Why take

                        I want to see the look in his

                        You go through something and it
                        changes you.  It holds a mirror
                        up against everything that's ever,
                        or ever will happen to you from
                        that point forward.  In some ways
                        you could say that my life began
                        and ended while I was with him.

          She considers him a beat, then moves away.  Johnny has a

            continues to help wipe up the spilled coffee.          DEAD ZONE: "THE COLLECTOR" - ACT THREE - 1/11/05 - GOLD   38.

          Johnny walks up to the cash register.  Sees a BELL with a
          note:  "Ring for service."  As Johnny touches the bell:



          WHIPS into...

            A mysterious MAN - a trucker cap pulled down low over his
          eyes.  He pays for some take-out.

          Dinner table.  Erica.  It's exactly the way Johnny saw it
          before.  Mascara runs down her cheeks.

          QUICK FLASHES that take us through the DINNER SPILLING,
          the PLATE FLUNG AGAINST THE WALL, the ATTACK WITH THE
          KNIFE and to the end, where he DUMPS OUT THE CONTENTS OF
          THE PLASTIC BAG, the items FROZEN IN MID AIR.  These are
          the very moments leading up to her murder.

          the man's wrist watch.

          It reads 11:55PM, 22nd day of the month.

          There's just enough moonlight filtering in through a set

          behind him - holding Walt's shotgun and wearing the now
          familiar powder blue dress.

          Before he can react, Linda introduces the butt of the
          shotgun to Johnny's face -- knocking him OUT COLD.  She
          stands over him, holding the 12-gauge. 

                                        LINDA
                        You showed me exactly where I
                        needed to be.

          She seems different, as if we're meeting her for the first
          time.



          Gun drawn, Walt MOVES cautiously along a dark corridor. 
          He STOPS as he HEARS THE FAINT SOUND OF A WOMAN'S VOICE
          CALLING FOR HELP.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "THE COLLECTOR" - ACT FOUR - 1/13/05 - WHITE-2   46.

          He MOVES towards an old service elevator.



          Johnny wakes up as a cup of cold water is splashed in his
          face.  He's lying on the floor, his nose bloodied and his
          brain cells slightly scrambled.


          JOHNNY'S HAZY POV - LINDA

          She stands watching him, the shotgun in her hands.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Linda?

                                        LINDA
                        I don't expect you to understand
                        this.  I don't completely
                        understand it myself.

          She steps forward into the light, as Johnny's senses clear. 
          She looks different.  Her hair down (she's wearing the
          wig).  Her face made up.  She looks surprisingly glamorous. 
          Just like in his previous visions (Scene 46).

                                        LINDA
                        When this is over, I want you to
                        tell them it was you who came to
                        me.

          There's a weird look in her eyes, like she's found some
          strange sense of inner peace.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Killing this man isn't going to
                        fill up what's missing in your
                        life. 

                                        LINDA
                                (amused)
                        You really can't see it, can you?
                                (beat)
                        I have no intention of killing
                        him.  I never did.

          It's in this very moment that Johnny sees the unbelievable,
            unimaginable truth of the situation.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You've come back to be with him.

                                        LINDA
                        You opened the door to feelings
                        I'd forgotten.  Emotions I'd pushed
                        out of my memory.

          She turns on a portable cassette player.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Linda, listen to me.  What you're
                        going through, it's not your fault. 
                        It's called Stockholm Syndrome.

          She begins to become agitated.

                                        LINDA
                        You don't understand...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It happens to people who've been
                        kidnapped.  They begin to
                        sympathize with their abductor.

                                        LINDA
                        That's not how it is...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It happened to Patty Hearst.  To
                          prisoners of war.

                                        LINDA
                                (flares)
                        I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYMORE!

          She MOVES QUICKLY towards him with the shotgun leveled at
          him, her hands trembling and her eyes burning.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's going to hurt you.  Maybe
                        worse.

                                        MAN'S VOICE
                        Not if she can be everything.

          Linda turns as we see the Man in the Mask standing behind
          her.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        Not if she can be -- perfect.



          Walt can't get the heavy metal doors open.

          He finds a metal bar and uses it to pry open the elevator
          doors.  He leans in --

                                        WALT
                        HELLO!  IS SOMEBODY THERE?!

          THE FOLLOWING EXCHANGE IS BETWEEN WALT AND ERICA IS --

                        YES, I HEAR YOU!  PLEASE, HELP
                        ME!

          Erica climbs up on the bed and calls out into an AIR VENT
          at the top of the wall.

                                        WALT
                        Erica, you need to listen to me!

          There's no way for him to get down the darkened shaft.

                                        WALT

          And he's gone.  Erica tries to keep a brave face.

          Linda steps towards the Masked Man, dropping to her knees
          as he reaches down and slips his hand around her throat.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        Why did you come here?

          She looks up at him, her breath visible in the cold air. 

                                        LINDA
                        For you.  I came for you.

          It's exactly like the vision Johnny had replaying itself
          in the present - with a whole new meaning.  Linda hands
          him the shotgun.

                                        LINDA
                        Please.  Give me another chance. 
                        I'll be what you want.  I can be
                        exactly what you want.

          A TRAIN WHISTLE is heard blasting in the b.g.

                                (to Linda)
                        This can't be what you want.

          She looks away, as the Masked Man begins to get more
          aggressive.

                        You have no idea what she wants.

          Johnny notices dinner on the table - a tray of food, two
          lit candles.  He realizes that Erica's last meal hasn't
          been served yet, meaning she's still alive.

                        What about Erica?  Is this what

                        lunatic so afraid of the world
                        that he lives his life hiding
                        behind a cheap plastic mask.

          The Masked Man jams the gun barrel into Johnny's chest,
          and Johnny is thrown in to another vision --

          The audience HEARS a WHOOSH.  Johnny comes quickly out of
          the Vision. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know you.  I know your mother
                        was never good enough.  I know
                        your father demanded perfection. 
                          Something she could never give
                        him.  Neither could his little
                        boy.

          The eyes behind the mask widen slightly...

                                        MASKED MAN
                        How could you know...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Now you search for that perfection
                        in the faces of these women you
                        take.
                                (eyeing Linda)
                        Then you throw them away like
                          garbage.

          The Masked Man cocks the shotgun.

          Johnny hesitates.  Linda seems suddenly concerned.  Johnny
          eyes the tray full of food, the candles burning.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        I won't tell you again!

          Johnny knows it's now or never, as he suddenly grabs a
          glass of wine and flings it into the guy's face.  He rushes
          him, driving him back against the wall.  They fight as
          they smash into the propane tank, knocking it off the
          counter onto the floor.

          Johnny and the Masked Man struggle, as the mask is ripped
          off REVEALING a man that oddly resembles a seventh grade
          shop teacher.  Johnny gets the upper hand, then suddenly
          feels the cold metal of the shotgun pressed against his
          back.

          Unbeknownst to our viewers, the scene now continues forward

                        will.

          The now UNMASKED MAN pushes Johnny away, as he takes the
          gun from her.  Behind them, the kitchenette burns. 

          Linda places her hand on the Unmasked Man's shoulder.

                        step aside.  It's your choice.  

          Tension builds.  Suddenly, the flames hit the propane
          tank, which Linda just notices and...

          Johnny feels the barrel of the gun jammed into his back. 
          Linda holds the weapon...

          We've rewound to the moment just before Walt appears.

                                        LINDA
                        I don't want to hurt you, but I
                        will.

          The Unmasked Man takes the shotgun.  Linda sets her hand
          on his shoulder.

                                        LINDA
                        We can just go.  Together.

                                        WALT (O.S.)
                          Nobody's going anywhere.

          Walt appears in the doorway, exactly like we just saw
          him.  Except this time, Johnny has a new plan.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt.  Don't!  Just put the gun
                        down!

                                        WALT
                        There's a half dozen police cars
                        heading up this mountain as we
                        speak. 

          The flames CRACKLE across the wall towards the propane
          tank...

                                        UNMASKED MAN
                        You choose, Sheriff.  Arrest me
                        and watch your friend die.  Or
                        step aside.  It's your choice.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt, listen to me.  You need to
                        let this one go.  I've seen it
                          before...

          Walt looks at Johnny and knows that he's up to something.

                                        WALT
                          Alright, everybody just relax.

          Walt slowly lowers his gun down.  Johnny sees the flames
          reach the propane tank.  Linda is about to notice it like
          she did before, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is it worth it, Linda?

          And instead of seeing the impending explosion, she looks
          over at Johnny.

                                        LINDA
                        You don't understand.

          In that instant, she notices the broken propane tank
          EXPLODE.  Only this time, she can't push the guy away and
          he takes a full frontal blast from the tank.

          He SCREAMS as he reaches up and covers his face.  Walt
          tries to get to them, but the FLAMES ARE TOO INTENSE.
          Linda and the Unmasked Man quickly vanish through the
          flames into the darkness of the factory.  Walt tries again,
          but Johnny grabs him by the arm --

          The fire now consumes most of the apartment.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let them go.  The factory is full
                        of chemicals.  We have to get to
                        Erica before the whole place comes
                        down.

                                        WALT
                        I spoke to her.  She's locked up
                          somewhere underneath us.

          And they quickly exit the burning room.



          (ACTION RESCUE SEQUENCE) Johnny and Walt fight their way
          through the fiery structure -- old vats of lye and
            explosive chemicals everywhere...          DEAD ZONE: "THE COLLECTOR" - ACT FOUR - 1/13/05 - WHITE-2   54.



          Johnny and Walt round a corner, running from a FIREBALL
          and exploding windows behind them...



          Johnny and Walt descend a stairwell to the basement as
          another FIREBALL EXPLODES behind them...



          Johnny and Walt reach the door to the Princess Bedroom...
          Walt kicks in the door... they pull Erica out and start
          to make their escape...



          The photograph of Erica.  The SHOT PANS OFF the screen as
          the real Erica sits in the Sheriff's office with a blanket
          around her shoulders.  Sarah is with her.  She gets up
          and walks out to join Walt and Johnny.

                                        WALT
                        She alright?

                                        SARAH
                        She doesn't want to go to the
                          hospital and she can't go home.

          Sarah is clearly upset by the situation.  Johnny shoots
          him a look, as --

                        Ya know, we've got that spare
                        room.  I could drag that day bed
                        in from the garage.  The mattress
                        is practically new.

                                        SARAH
                        We could do that.  She'll need
                          somebody to take care of her for
                        awhile.

                                        SARAH
                        A week -- ten days tops.  I still
                        think she can turn her life around,
                          I really do.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How could she miss with somebody
                        like you?

                                        WALT
                        I just hope there's enough of you
                        to go around.

          Sarah can't help but smile as she moves back in to where
          Erica is sitting.

                                        WALT
                        What about Linda?  What could
                        drive somebody to want to go back
                        to something like that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe for her the alternative was
                        worse.  We all need to feel like
                        we matter.  Even if it's just the
                        pain.

                                        WALT
                        I've got people up there sifting
                        through the debris.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's the chance of anybody
                          surviving that kind of explosion.

                                        WALT
                        Not very likely.

          Walt walks away as Johnny turns to look in at Sarah as
          she comforts Erica.



          Linda drives, the Unmasked Man sits in the passenger seat. 
          His face bandaged and bloodied.  She reaches across to
          touch his hand, as the taillights vanish out of sight.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
