      FADE IN:

      EXT. NEW YORK, STREET - DAY11

      Manhattan traffic, 86th and CPW, snarled.  (The traffic s 
      sound design places the viewer  in the thick of it. )

                                                                    TRANSITION TO:

      INT. BEDROOM - DAY22

      SUNLIGHT streams through a curtained BEDROOM WINDOW.    

      (Note: Identical traffic noise will be doppler effected to 
      fix Bedroom s location as same.) 

      CAMERA FOLLOWS the shaft of sunlight down to a high-priced 
      RUG, and a CELL PHONE resting, unattended, underneath a well-
      appointed BED.  (As the CAMERA takes us down to the phone, 
      the traffic sounds start to fade.)  

      HOLD ON CELL PHONE.  Beat.  

      Suddenly, the CELL PHONE comes to life with a MUSICAL RING 
      TONE:  Vampire Weekend.   (In any event, something youthful 
      and jarringly out of place in the quiet.)  

      SONG plays a few moments before the call ends, then the 
      remaining low, traffic sounds are overtaken by a doppler-
      effected BUZZING NOISE which would accompany a CAMERA DROP 
      through floors, prelapping a... 

                                                                    TRANSITION TO:

        A FLORESCENT-TUBED CEILING FIXTURE - DAY33

      (Note: Concrete, piping; an industrial ceiling and clearly 
      not the bedroom.)

      Bright white tubes buzzing.  A beat.  The buzzing starts to 
      fade concurrently with a CAMERA PAN down to the top of a row 
      of rumbling MACHINERY. 

      CAMERA PANS LOWER and the buzzing is overtaken by the 
      rumbling of the machinery and an even louder thump-thumping 
      at regular 2-3 second intervals. 

      CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN LOWER passing a COIN SLOT, revealing:    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    2.


      THE GLASS PORTAL OF A FRONT-LOADING DRIER 

      Inside, clothes are spinning: that s the rumbling sound we ve 
      been hearing.  But what s that thumping?

      CAMERA PUSHES IN TOWARD THE GLASS PORTAL, revealing, 

      The back of someone s head and long hair, her body tumbling 
      around and around.  

      The BODY, with each revolution: thump, thumping.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY44

      CASTLE sits at a conference table, his phone on the table, 
      looking over a stack of documents. Across from him, is a 
      humorless, suited LAWYER (mid-40s, balding).

                                  LAWYER
                    You understand that by signing 
                    these documents, you ll be waiving 
                    a number of legal rights in 
                    exchange for the opportunity to 
                    accompany and observe Detective 
                    Beckett in her duties as an officer 
                    for the NYPD?

                                  CASTLE
                    Wow.

                                  LAWYER
                    Something wrong, Mr. Castle?

                                  CASTLE
                          (re: phone)
                    Yeah.  Do either of you get any 
                    bars in this room? 

      BECKETT, leaning against a nearby wall, shoots him a look.

                                    BECKETT
                    Castle. 

                                  CASTLE
                    It s just weird not to get cell 
                    service in a police station.  I 
                    mean, it d be so much easier to get 
                    your one phone call, right?  Sorry. 

      He turns his attention back to the paperwork.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    3.


                                  LAWYER
                    Be advised that once you sign, if 
                    you get injured, you cannot sue the 
                    city. If you get shot, you cannot 
                    sue the city. If you get killed...

                                  CASTLE
                    My lifeless remains cannot sue the 
                    city?

                                  LAWYER
                    Your heirs, Mr. Castle.

                                    BECKETT
                    Do I have to wait for him to sign 
                    or can I shoot him now?

                                  LAWYER
                    Mr. Castle, these waivers are 
                    serious business. Perhaps you d 
                    feel more comfortable referring the 
                    matter to your attorney.

                                  CASTLE
                    Are you kidding? He d never let me 
                    sign these.

      As Castle pulls out his pen...

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    Luckily, his job is to get me out 
                    of trouble, not stop me from 
                    getting into it.

                                    BECKETT
                          (annoyed)
                    Isn t your book coming out soon? 
                    Don t you have to be somewhere?

                                  CASTLE
                    Probably. But here s more fun.

      She shakes her head as her CELLPHONE RINGS. 

                                    BECKETT
                          (on phone)
                      Beckett... Where? I m on my way.

      Beckett heads toward the door.

                                  CASTLE
                    Hey... Where are you going?    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    4.


                                    BECKETT
                    I have work to do, Castle.

                                  CASTLE
                    What? We have a case?

                                    BECKETT
                    I have a case. You have paperwork.

      And she s out the door.  Castle turns to the Lawyer

                                  CASTLE
                    300 bucks for a phone and she gets 
                    the bars.

      INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY55

      BECKETT enters, finds RYAN and ESPOSITO standing beside the 
      now open drier.  

      An OLDER WOMAN, 70s, sits in a folding chair with a female 
      UNIFORM and an EMT TECH attending her, supplying portable 
      oxygen.  

      Ryan sees Beckett enter, crosses to her, as she scans the 
      room. QUICK CUT (her POV) on a busted BLEACH JUG laying in a *
      small pool of clear liquid.*

                                    BECKETT
                    So?

                                  RYAN
                    Mrs. Rosenberg. 9-E. Comes down to 
                    put her clothes in the drier, finds 
                    it s occupied. Comes down a half-
                    hour later and she s had enough. 
                    Decides to take matters into her 
                    own hands.

                                    BECKETT
                    C mon. You re telling me an old 
                    lady killed someone over a busy 
                    drier?

                                  RYAN
                    What?? No. She just got tired of 
                    waiting around, so she opened the 
                    drier to take the person s clothes 
                    out.  

      Beckett and Ryan reach the open drier, WE SEE the body of a 
      woman, 20s, fully clothed - jeans, T-shirt - cramped 
      awkwardly inside, along with a load of a little boy s 
      clothing.      Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    5.


                                  RYAN
                    Finds Miss Fluff and Fold instead.

      Beckett leans in for a closer look.  No blood.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Now if that s not a cautionary tale  
                    about poking through someone else s 
                    laundry, I don t know what is. *

                                  RYAN*
                    Dude, there s an etiquette *
                    involved.  If the clothes were dry, *
                    Mrs. Rosenberg had every right to *
                    put them in a basket.  Now, if *
                    you re gonna tell me she folded the *
                    clothes, then it gets kinda creepy.*

                                  ESPOSITO*
                    Sorry, but you start rooting *
                    through my underwear without *
                      invitation? I m gonna consider that *
                    a serious breach of hygiene.*

                                  BECKETT*
                    Thought you went commando, 
                    Esposito. 

      Off Esposito, then --

                                    BECKETT
                          (re: victim)
                    Alright, let s get her out of there 
                    with a little dignity. And get 
                    C.S.U. down here. I want blood 
                    samples from the edge of this table 
                    and that bleach bottle sent to the 
                    lab.  

      CLOSE ON THE OF EDGE OF A FOLDING TABLE, a trace of blood.

                                    BECKETT
                    Also, photos and prints; not that 
                    it s gonna do us much good in a 
                    public area... I assume she lived 
                    in the building?

                                  RYAN
                    Worked. 12-F. She s the nanny.

                                                                            CUT TO:    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    5A.


      EXT. 12TH FLOOR, HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER66

      Elevator doors open on the 12th Floor, revealing Castle 
      leaning against the wall, seemingly waiting for Beckett.

                                  CASTLE
                    Thought you ditched me back at the 
                    precinct, didn t you?

      Beckett shakes her head, starts walking down the hallway.  
      Castle follows.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    6.


                                  CASTLE
                    C mon, Nanny McDead s found on spin 
                    dry and you didn t think your 
                    Captain would let me in on that 
                    story?

                                    BECKETT
                    You re right. My bad... So, exactly 
                    how long can I expect you to be 
                    shadowing me on my cases like this?

                                  CASTLE
                    Hard to say.  You know when I m 
                    writing a new character, there s no 
                    telling how long it ll take for 
                      inspiration to strike. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Thought I was your inspiration, 
                    Castle.

                                  CASTLE
                    Oh you are, Detective, and in so 
                    many ways.  

                                    BECKETT
                    Well, then your  inspiration  might 
                    strike you sooner than you think.

      Beckett shoots a warning look at Castle as she stops in front 
      of 12-F; she presses the door buzzer. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Nanny s name was Sara Manning and 
                    she worked for the Petersons about 
                    two years.
                          (off her new look)
                    The doorman s a huge fan of my 
                    work. 

      Beckett shakes her head, just as CLAUDIA PETERSON, 38, pencil 
      skirt, silk blouse; professional appearance - minus the heels 
      now that she s home with the kid - answers the door.

                                    BECKETT
                    Mrs. Peterson? Kate Beckett. NYPD.  
                    I was hoping I could ask you a few 
                    questions about Sara Manning.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Yes. Of course. Please come in. 

      Claudia opens the door, Beckett enters, Castle follows.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    7.


                                  CASTLE
                    Hi. Richard Castle. Just... N-Y.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      CASTLE TITLE CARD

      INT. PETERSON APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER77

      Beckett and Castle are in the LIVING ROOM, with HOWARD 
      PETERSON, 40, while Claudia speaks to her SON, 8, through an 
      open door to his BEDROOM.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Sweetie, Mommy and Daddy need to 
                    talk to some people, but we ll be 
                    right out here.

      She closes the door, leaving it open a crack, giving us a 
      glimpse of the little boy, playing on a rug that looks 
      similar to the one in the Cold Open.  

                                    CLAUDIA
                    We still haven t told him what 
                    happened.  We just don t know how.

                                  HOWARD 
                    Sara was very close with him. She 
                    just had a gift with kids.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    She was such a lovely girl.

                                    BECKETT
                    I m very sorry.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    The school called me at my office 
                    when Sara didn t come to pick up 
                    Justin.  I tried her cell phone, 
                    but it went straight to voice mail.  
                    Then I tried here and the machine 
                    picked up.  So I hopped in a cab 
                    and went to the school. When we got 
                    home, the police were already here.

                                    BECKETT
                    So, the last time you spoke to Sara 
                    was when?

                                    CLAUDIA
                    My husband saw her yesterday 
                    evening when he got home.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    8.


                                  HOWARD 
                    We take Justin to school in the 
                    mornings, so we re usually gone by 
                    the time Sara gets here.  

                                    BECKETT
                    And what time is that?

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Today, it would have been eleven.  
                    Sara straightens up... does 
                    Justin s laundry, then picks him up 
                    at school about two.  One of us is 
                    then home for dinner.  Last night, 
                    it was Howard s turn.

                                    BECKETT
                    So, you talked to her last?

                                  HOWARD 
                    I guess so.

                                  CASTLE
                    Did she mention any problems she 
                    was having?  A boyfriend maybe.

      Beckett shoots a look.  Claudia s a little unnerved.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Sara s boyfriend?  

                                  HOWARD 
                    The doorman told us the police said 
                    it was a break-in, that it was 
                    probably a stranger who did this.

                                    BECKETT
                    We re not sure what happened.

                                  CASTLE
                    Maybe not.  But statistically 
                    speaking?  Much greater likelihood 
                    she knew her attacker.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Oh my god.

                                    BECKETT
                          (looks at Castle)
                    Again. We re not sure who was 
                    involved.  

                                  CASTLE
                    But she did have a boyfriend.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    9.


                                  HOWARD 
                    Brent.  But they broke up. 

                                  CASTLE
                    When was that?

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Maybe a month ago.  But Sara never 
                    said there was any trouble or 
                    anything like that. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Brent.  That s his name?

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Yes.

                                    BECKETT
                    What about a last name?

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Gosh, I don t think Sara ever 
                    mentioned it. 

                                  HOWARD 
                    To me either.

                                    BECKETT
                    Well, I appreciate you speaking 
                    with us.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Of course.

                                    BECKETT
                    Let s go, Castle.

                                  CASTLE
                    That s it? 

                                    BECKETT
                    That s it.

                    Oh, is there any chance you know 
                    how I can reach Sara s parents?  

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Oh god, I hadn t even thought about 
                    that... I m sorry, but we don t 
                    have their number.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    10.


                                  HOWARD 
                    They live down in Atlanta.  Sara 
                    was just with them over Christmas. 

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Those poor, poor people.

                                    BECKETT
                    What about her things? 

                                    CLAUDIA
                    That s her bag and jacket.  

      She motions to a JACKET and BAG on a chair.   

                                    BECKETT
                    Maybe I can take these with me and  
                    check her cell phone. 

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Thanks.

      Beckett has the BAG and JACKET, looking through both.

                                  CASTLE
                    Why didn t we stick around? I had a 
                    lot more questions.

                                    BECKETT
                    Because I actually like to 
                      investigate things myself first.  
                    Besides, neither of them is going 
                    anywhere, Castle. 
                          (then, re: purse)
                    There s no cell phone.

                                  CASTLE
                    You check the laundry room or the 
                    drier?

                                    BECKETT

                    And you re really the one who has 
                    to call her parents?

                                    BECKETT
                    Little easier to write about than 
                    live through, huh?

      Off Castle,

      INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT99

      Castle and Beckett enter, find MONTGOMERY, Esposito and Ryan  
      gathered around two monitors.  (Production note: One monitor 
      depicts the building s rear entrance; the other: a  bubble  
      camera inside the elevator, which doesn t show the elevator s 
      floor panel.) 

                                  CASTLE
                    Three men huddled around a 
                    computer.  I hope that s not porn. 
                    And if it is, I d like in.

                                  CAPT. MONTGOMERY
                    Esposito and Ryan pulled security 
                    tapes from the elevator and the 
                      building s rear entrance.  

                                  RYAN
                    Front door has a twenty-four hour 
                    doorman.

                    This is the Elevator s cam.  Victim 
                    gets on with the laundry basket.  
                    Goes down to the basement to put 
                    the kid s laundry into the washer.  
                    ... Few minutes later, she gets on, 
                    heads back upstairs to the 
                      apartment.  Then about forty 
                    minutes later, she rides the 
                    elevator to the basement again.

                                  RYAN
                    We re thinking probably to take the 
                    kid s clothes out of the washer and 
                    put them in the drier.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    12.

                    Camera never picks her up again.

      Esposito stops Sara s image.  Castle studies it.

                    basement during the next hour is 
                    the old lady who found the body.  

      Esposito nods, fast forwards and WE SEE Mrs. Rosenberg 
      getting off at the basement level.

                                    BECKETT
                    So, whoever attacked her had to 
                    have used the stairwell, otherwise 
                    the camera would have seen them.

                          (picks up file)
                    We got three maintenance workers on 
                    duty that day.  We re gonna run 
                    their names tonight. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Why run only the building s 
                    workers? Why not all the neighbors?

                                    BECKETT
                    What are you basing that on?

                                  CASTLE
                    I m basing it on the fact that a 
                    neighbor makes a better story.

      They roll their eyes a little.

                                  CASTLE
                    C mon.  What do any of us know 
                    about our neighbors in this city?  
                    You think the guy who lived next 
                    door to Son of Sam knew he was 
                    living next to Son of Sam?

                                  CAPT. MONTGOMERY
                    He s right.  Neighbors in 
                      Berkowitz s building had no idea he 
                    was the Son of Sam Killer.

      Castle can see he s piqued their interest.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    13.


                                  CASTLE
                    Like... what do we know about the 
                    guy in 8-B?

                                    BECKETT
                    Who?

                                  CASTLE
                    8-B.  The quiet type; the man who 
                    walks past you everyday and you 
                    never notice.  Only he noticed 
                    Sara. She was young, beautiful.  
                    The kind of girl he never stood a 
                    chance with.  
                          (beat; nods to Beckett)
                    We all know those girls, right?

      Beckett sees the three, Esposito, even Captain Montgomery 
      drawn in.  And all of them looking at her.  Then--

                                  CASTLE
                    At first, it was just a game: 
                    learning her schedule, when she did 
                    the laundry, when she d be alone. 
                    Until it became something more, 
                    something he couldn t control. 

      Now in the background we see a few COPS stopping to listen.

                                  CASTLE
                    He used the stairs, obviously, to 
                    avoid the elevator s camera.  Then 
                    waited, concealed, in the shadows. 
                    And when she went inside that 
                    laundry room, he pounced. 

      They re now hanging on his every word.

                                  CASTLE
                    And now, as he looked into her 
                    vacant, lifeless eyes, he wanted to 
                    tell her: He hadn t meant to kill 
                    her; that all he d really wanted 
                    was to be noticed... That s when he 
                    felt the warmth of that drier 
                    against his skin. He took her limp 
                    body in his arms and gently placed 
                    her inside.  When he found the 
                    quarter in his pocket, he nearly 
                    smiled at his good fortune, sliding  
                    it into the coin slot, buying 
                    himself the time to do what he d 
                    always done best: disappear.     Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    14.


      You can hear a pin drop now.   But Castle s only been fucking 
      with them and suddenly shifts gears.  Pops back to affable.

                                  CASTLE
                    Just saying it s a better story. 

      Beckett almost can t hide her smile, as Castle walks away.   
      The team looks at one another: It almost makes sense.

                                  CAPT. MONTGOMERY
                    Let s see what we can find out 
                    about the neighbors.
                          (then, sharper)
                    And someone better tell me who the 
                    hell lives in 8-B.

      Montgomery walks off toward his office.

      INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT1010

      Castle arrives.  There s a light in the kitchen.  ALEXIS is 
      there.  She s cleaning dishes, loading the dishwasher.  The 
      place looks like Caligula just held a feast.  It s a mess.

                                  CASTLE
                    Lemme guess.  Gram cooked.

                                  ALEXIS
                    In her room, taking a dramatic 
                    pause.

                                  CASTLE
                    And left the mess for someone else 
                    to clean up, as usual.  

      Castle grabs stuff to help the clean up.

                                  ALEXIS
                    I don t mind.  Dinner was fun.

                    And it s not  her room.   It s our

                    If you re hungry, there s lots of 
                      left-overs.

                                  CASTLE
                    Thanks, but I grabbed a slice on my 
                    way home.

                                  ALEXIS
                    You really are turning into a cop.

                          (cool)
                    Yeah?  You think so?

                                  ALEXIS
                    So who got killed today? 

                                  CASTLE
                    The nanny.

                                  ALEXIS
                    Do they know who did it?

                                  CASTLE
                      Apparently in an actual homicide? 
                    They don t know who did it until 
                    after the guy gets caught.

      Alexis smiles.  Beat.

                                  ALEXIS
                    How come we never had a nanny?

                    I was just asking Dad why we never 
                    had a nanny when I was little.

                                  CASTLE
                    Of course I spared her tales of my 
                    own experience. 

                                  MARTHA
                    Well, I had a real job as a working 
                    actress.  You know not all of us 
                    can sit at home with a keyboard and 
                    claim to be employed.

                                  ALEXIS
                    Really?  You had a nanny?

                                  CASTLE
                    They weren t called nannies then.

                    What were they called?

                                  MARTHA
                    Oh stop your whining. You didn t 
                    turn out half bad.  And don t you 
                    forget the good half are my genes.

                    Which is something I just have to 
                    take your word for, isn t it? But I 
                    wasn t looking for an apology,

                    success as well.

                    Really?  They do them at night?  
                    No, sure.  I m just really touched 
                    you thought of me... I see, you 
                    were ordered to call me.  Well, 
                    either way, I can leave now.

                    Really?  I thought cops just stand 
                    over the body eating ham and cheese 
                      sandwiches, cracking jokes.  You 
                    know, hard-core gallows humor.

      Beckett shakes her head and moves inside,

      INT. CITY MORGUE, EXAMINATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS1212

      Beckett is with LANIE.  Sara Manning is on an exam table.

                                  LANIE
                    Well, the head trauma definitely 
                      contributed to the death.  The 
                    force of the blows resulted in 
                      significant cerebral hemorrhaging.

      Castle comes in, still fitting the VISOR.

                                  LANIE
                    Mr. Castle.  Nice to see you again.

                                  CASTLE
                    I d say the same but my glasses are *
                      scratched.  How often do they let *
                    you replace these things? 

                                    BECKETT
                    Not everyone has your budget, 
                    Castle... So what killed her?

                                  LANIE
                    I d say she was struck in the head 
                    with the bleach bottle, then fell 
                    forward and hit her temple on the 
                    edge of the table.  That caused 
                    temporal bleeding.  

      Lanie goes over a counter and picks up a glass slide.

                                  LANIE
                    Without medical attention, she 
                    didn t stand a chance... But what I 
                    thought you d find really 
                      interesting is the fact that she 
                    had sex within hours of her death.  

                                    BECKETT
                    Sex?

                                  CASTLE

                    Might have even been within a few 
                    minutes of the murder.  Heat from 
                    the drier makes it hard to 
                    pinpoint.

                                    BECKETT

                    Hard to determine.  There were no 
                    vaginal lacerations or presence of 
                    any semen.

                                    BECKETT
                    So what was the evidence of sex?

                                  LANIE
                    Traces of a spermicide.
                          (beat; off Beckett)
                    The guy wore a condom.

                                  CASTLE
                    Really has been a while, hasn t it.

      Beat.

                                  LANIE
                    I mean, it s possible it was a 
                    rape, but my best guess is--

                                    BECKETT
                    That she knew the guy.

      Off Lanie s nod, Castle.

                                        ACT TWO

      INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY1313

      Castle, Beckett, Esposito and Ryan debate the merits.

                                    BECKETT
                    Without evidence of trauma, I m not 
                    ready to buy her attacker as a 
                    sexual predator.  Not with him 
                    using a condom.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Could be he was trying to hide DNA.

                                  RYAN
                    Dude, someone smart enough to hide 
                    DNA would have been smart enough 
                    not to have sex with her in a 
                    laundry room.

                                  CASTLE
                    You re missing the point: The 
                    laundry room provided him with an 
                      opportunity... It isn t just chance 
                    she was killed there.

      Montgomery enters,

                                  CAPT. MONTGOMERY
                    Where are we on her cell phone?  

                                  ESPOSITO
                    I pulled her records and had her 
                    service provider ping it.
                          (off file)
                      Triangulation put the phone at or 
                    near the building. 

      Esposito hands the file to Beckett. 

                                  CAPT. MONTGOMERY
                    Maybe the guy took it so she 
                    couldn t call for help, then dumped 
                    it somewhere close by. 
                          (then)
                    What about the ex-boyfriend?

                                  RYAN
                    We have a first name.  But if we 
                    had her cell phone, he might be in 
                    her address book.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    21.


                                    BECKETT
                          (off file)
                    What about these calls?

                                  CASTLE
                    What calls?

                                    BECKETT
                    Last two months, there s dozens of 
                    incoming calls from the same 
                    number.  

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Right.  We re still running it 
                    down, but the number s a pre-pay.  
                    Besides, those calls stopped a 
                    couple of weeks before she was 
                    killed.

                                    BECKETT
                    But her outgoing calls to that 
                    number stop even before that.
                          (beat, realizing)
                    Whoever it was, she didn t want to 
                    talk to them.  

                                  CASTLE
                          (following Beckett now)
                    She was letting those calls go to 
                    her voicemail.

      Off our guys,

      INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY1515

      BRENT JOHNSON, 20, nervous, sits waiting with a UNI, when 
      Castle and Beckett enter. UNI then gets up and exits.

                                    BECKETT
                    Brent Johnson?

                                  BRENT
                    Yeah.

                                    BECKETT
                    Detective Beckett. This is Mr. 
                    Castle. I assume you know why 
                    you re here? 

                                  BRENT
                    Um, the cops who picked me up at my 
                    job said you had some questions  
                    about what happened to Sara?

                                    BECKETT
                    That s right.  We understand you 
                    and Sara were dating.

                                  BRENT
                    Yeah.  Til about a month ago. 

                                    BECKETT
                    A month ago?  What happened then?

                                  BRENT
                    Nothing.  We broke up.

                                  CASTLE
                    Whose idea was that? 

                                  BRENT
                    Mutual thing, I guess.

                                    BECKETT
                    A mutual thing.

      Beckett reaches into her pocket, and takes out a small 
      digital recorder.  Hits  play. 

                                  BRENT (ON RECORDER)
                    Sara, it s me.  Look, just call me 
                    back, okay? 
                          (BEEP; new call)
                    You can t just not call me.  Don t 
                    be a bitch, Sara.
                          (BEEP; new call)
                    Sara, c mon.  I just wanna talk.

                                  BRENT (ON RECORDER) (cont'd)
                    Why can t you just tell me who the 
                    guy is?  Okay, you know what? 
                    You re just a little slut.  

      Beckett clicks  off. 

                                    BECKETT
                    There s plenty more of those. 

                                  CASTLE
                    And they all make Alec Baldwin s *
                    messages seem like rainbows and *
                      unicorns...*

                                  BRENT
                    How did you get those?

                                    BECKETT
                    From your service provider.  

                                  CASTLE
                    Little advice?  When you a buy a 
                    pre-pay phone?  Don t put it on 
                    your credit card.  Makes it totally 
                      traceable.

                                  BRENT
                    I wasn t trying to hide anything.

                                    BECKETT
                    No?  Then why d you just lie?

                                  CASTLE
                     Cause no man likes getting dumped, 
                    right?  Our egos can t handle it.  
                    I had an ex-girlfriend cheat once 
                    and I ended up drinking every meal 
                    for a week.  And I never even liked 
                    her.  But if I d loved her?  Wow.  
                    I don t know what I would ve done.

                                  BRENT
                    No.  No way.  It wasn t like that. 

                                    BECKETT
                    No?  Then how d you find out about 
                    Sara, if you broke up a month ago?

                                  BRENT
                    A friend. 
                          (off her look)
                    Chloe.  Chloe Richardson.  We all 
                    went to college together.  Chloe s  
                    the one who got Sara her job.   Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    23A.


                                    BECKETT
                    How d this friend find out?

                                  BRENT
                    Chloe nannies for another family in 
                    the building.  They were pretty 
                    close.

                                    BECKETT
                    So, where were you the day Sara was 
                    killed?

                                  BRENT
                    Where those other cops found me.  
                    At my job.  Look, they have video 
                    cameras and a sign-in sheet there.  
                    I swear, I didn t have anything to 
                    do with this.
                          (off Beckett, shit)
                    So, you gonna arrest me now or 
                    what?    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    24.


                                    BECKETT
                    No.  You can go.  But I don t want 
                    you to leave town until we talk 
                    again, do you understand? 

                                  BRENT
                    Yes, ma am.

      Brent gets up, beats a hasty retreat.

                                  CASTLE
                    Don t leave town?  Don t you need 
                    probable cause for something like 
                    that?

                                    BECKETT
                    Only he doesn t know that, does he.

      Beckett gets up, heads to the exit as well. 

                                  CASTLE
                    So, you can just lie like that?   
                    That is so cool.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. PARK - DAY1616

      The playground: ground zero for the Manhattan nanny.  KIDS on 
      swings, sandboxes, etc.  

                                    BECKETT
                    Doorman told Esposito this is the 
                      playground most of the nannies in 
                    the building go to, so this girl 
                    Chloe should be here. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Kinda takes me back a bit.

                                    BECKETT
                          (takes a playful shot)
                    A bit?  I m thinkin  it s gotta be 
                    a little more than that, Castle.

                                  CASTLE
                    I wasn t talking about when I was a 
                    kid.  I was referring to taking my 
                    daughter to the park.

                                    BECKETT
                    You took your daughter to the park?      Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    25.


                                  CASTLE
                    Spring, summer and fall, we were 
                    here almost everyday.  Alexis s 
                    mother was on the road a lot - 
                    community theater - so I had 
                    custody.
                          (off her look)
                    What? 

                                    BECKETT
                    Just never figured you for Mr. Mom.

                                  CASTLE
                    Some of the best days of my life.

                                    BECKETT
                    That s actually nice.

                                  CASTLE
                    Tell me about it.  Do you know how 
                    many lonely single mothers there 
                    are on a Manhattan playground? And 
                    there I was: in between marriages.

                                    BECKETT
                    Exactly how many times have you 
                    been married, Castle?

                                  CASTLE
                    Twice. 

                                    BECKETT
                    That s it?  

                                  CASTLE
                    Isn t that enough?  How  bout you?

                    You d be good at it. You re

                          (but then)
                    Doorman said she had a red vest on.   
                    That could be her over there.

      Beckett heads over to young woman, CHLOE RICHARDSON, 20s, 
      with a little girl, BECCA, 5, not far off.

                                    BECKETT
                    Chloe?

                                  CHLOE
                    Yes?

                                    BECKETT
                    Detective Beckett. I d like to ask 
                    you some questions about Sara 
                    Manning?

                                  CHLOE
                    Right now?

      Chloe looks over at Becca playing a short distance away.

                                    BECKETT
                    It won t take long.

      Another nanny, MAGGIE, late 20s, turns around.

                                  CHLOE
                    Could you watch Becca for a minute?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. PARK, BENCH - MOMENTS LATER1717

      Chloe, Beckett and Castle sit on a park bench.  

                                    BECKETT
                    Sara s boyfriend told us you were 
                    the one who got Sara her job.

                                  CHLOE
                    You talked to Brent?
                          (off Beckett s nod)
                    When we got out of school, Sara 
                    couldn t find a job.  She was 
                    temping all over town.  I nannie 
                    for a family in the same building 
                    and heard the Petersons were 
                    looking for someone.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    27.


                                  CASTLE
                    So, when was the last time you saw 
                    Sara?

      Chloe turns and looks away.

                                    BECKETT
                      I understand how it feels to lose 
                    someone, Chloe... But we need to 
                    ask you these questions. 

                                  CHLOE
                    We d meet before work sometimes.  
                    Get some coffee on Columbus, then 
                    walk over to work together.

                                    BECKETT
                    Did you have coffee with her that 
                    day?

                                  CHLOE
                    Yeah.

                                  CASTLE
                    And, did Sara say anything to you?  
                    Did she seem upset?

                                  CHLOE
                    Upset?  Upset about what?

                                    BECKETT
                    We got the impression from Brent 
                    that Sara was seeing someone else. 

      Chloe looks away again.  

                                  CASTLE
                    You know who he was, don t you.

      Chloe turns and looks at Castle.   This is hard for her.

                                  CHLOE
                    Sara stayed late sometimes.

                                    BECKETT
                    What do you mean?  At the 
                      Petersons?

      Castle mouths to Beckett, behind Chloe s back:  Told you. 

                                  CHLOE
                    We got off work around the same 
                    time, so we d take the train 
                    together.

                    I live with a roommate a couple of 
                    blocks from Sara... But the last 
                    few months she started staying 
                    late... Mr. And Mrs. Peterson kinda 
                    take turns coming home for dinner, 
                    you know?

                                    BECKETT
                    Yes. Mrs. Peterson told us.

                                  CHLOE
                    God, I don t wanna say something 
                    and then-- I mean, he s married.

                                    BECKETT
                    Sara told you about him then?

                                  CHLOE
                    No.  Not exactly.  It s just... the 
                    nights Mrs. Peterson didn t come 
                    home for dinner? Those were the 
                    only nights Sara stayed late. 

      Off Beckett, Castle,

      INT. LOBBY - DAY1818*

      Castle and Beckett enter a lobby.*

                                  CASTLE
                    Told you we should have asked the 
                    husband more questions that day.

                                    BECKETT
                    And I told you, I like to question 
                    my most likely suspect after I know 
                    more about him.  That way he s tied 
                    to more specific answers.

                                  CASTLE
                    So you suspected him too?

                                    BECKETT
                    The husband?  Duh.

                    You know, you would totally clean

                    Right.  Just you, James Patterson 
                    and the rest of the Times best 
                    seller list... Think it s probably *

                    Sorry, Castle, but I prefer mystery *
                    to horror.*

      Castle smiles, as they come upon Howard on his phone, roaming *
    a space.  He sees them, his look indicating he s unsure why *
      they re here. He holds up a finger for them to wait.*

      Beckett, Castle and Howard Peterson walk and talk.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    30.


                                    BECKETT
                    So when was the last time you saw, 
                    Sara, Mr. Peterson?

                                  HOWARD 
                    The night before she was killed.  I 
                    already told you.

                                  CASTLE
                    Which was your night to be home for 
                    dinner, right? 

                                  HOWARD 
                    Yes.  Why are you asking?

      Castle s about to answer.  Beckett jumps in--

                                    BECKETT
                    Eh. Eh. Eh.
                          (then, to Peterson)
                    I have information that Sara 
                    Manning was having a relationship.

                                  HOWARD 
                    Right.  She had a boyfriend.  

      Castle scrunches his face: You re guessing wrong.

                                    BECKETT
                    Someone else.  

                                  HOWARD 
                    Someone else?  Who?

      Castle looks at Peterson, sheepishly points to him.  

                                  HOWARD 
                    Me?  You think I was having an 
                    affair with Sara?  

                                  CASTLE
                    Bingo.

                                  HOWARD 
                    But that s, that s... crazy. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Is it?  We know she stayed late on 
                    some nights.  

                                  HOWARD 
                    To help us with dinner.       Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    31.

                    Us?  What we heard is that she only 
                    helped on the nights your wife 
                    wasn t home.

      Howard Peterson looks trapped a bit.

                                  HOWARD 
                    ... It s not what you think.

                                  CASTLE
                    When is it ever?

                                  HOWARD    
                    Look, it wasn t my fault Wall 
                    Street tanked. Took the real estate 
                    market with it. Only try telling 
                    her that. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Try telling who that, Mr. Peterson?

                                  HOWARD 
                    My wife. And you re right. I was 
                    having an affair. 

                                    BECKETT
                    So, what happened?

                                  HOWARD
                    What do you mean, what happened?  I 
                    cheated. I strayed. Whatever you 
                    wanna call it.

                                    BECKETT
                    I meant, in that laundry room.

                                  HOWARD 
                    What?

                                    BECKETT
                    You just said that--

                                  HOWARD 
                    I was having an affair. But it 
                    wasn t with Sara, for godsake. It 
                    was with a woman in my office.
                          (off them)
                    Look, on the nights I was supposed 
                    to be home for dinner? I wasn t. 
                    Check the land line at the 
                      apartment.  I always called Sara to 
                    make sure things were okay.

                    What happened with the husband?

                    What is this, The View?  Where are

                    Great.  So all we have is a 
                    cheating husband with a possible 
                    alibi and no cell phone to try to 
                    lift the perp s fingerprints.

                    Please tell me it s that the mayor 
                    wants him out of here.

                                  RYAN
                    Well, we got one now.  Guess who 
                    wasn t where they said they were 
                    the day Sara Manning was killed?

                    I m not guessing, Ryan.

      Ryan hands her his pad.  She looks at the name.  Then looks 
      up at Ryan, who s grinning at her.

      Claudia Peterson, with Beckett and Castle.

                                    BECKETT
                    Detective Ryan checked with your 
                    son s school. The day they called 
                    you about Sara not showing up to 
                    get your son, your assistant told 
                    them he couldn t reach you.  

                                    CLAUDIA 
                    What are you talking about?

                                    BECKETT
                    I m talking about Sara Manning, 
                    Mrs. Peterson.  We re talking about 
                    why you lied about where you were 
                    the day she was killed.  We know 
                    you weren t at your office.

                                  CASTLE
                    Wouldn t have been hard to sneak in 
                    your building.  Doorman could have 
                    been out hailing a cab for someone, 
                    taking a delivery...

      Claudia becomes slightly unnerved.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    My husband was having an affair... 
                    Did you know that?

                                  CASTLE
                    Actually, we did.

                                    CLAUDIA 
                    All these months and I had no idea. 

                                    BECKETT
                    But you found out? 

                                    CLAUDIA 
                    Sara told me a few weeks ago. 

      Beckett looks at Castle: Is this their break?

                                    BECKETT
                    Sara, told you about the affair?    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    35.


                                    CLAUDIA 
                    Yes.  And she d been a complete 
                    wreck about keeping it from me.   

                                  CASTLE
                    Yeah, I ll bet. 

                                    CLAUDIA 
                    Did you know he was paying her 
                    extra?

                                    BECKETT
                    No.  He didn t mention that. 

                                    CLAUDIA 
                    I mean, imagine him putting Sara in 
                    the middle of something like that. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Something like what?

                                    CLAUDIA 
                    Using Sara to cover for himself.  I 
                    mean, it s disgusting.

                                  CASTLE
                    Are you telling us your husband 
                    wasn t sleeping with Sara? 

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Howard and Sara?  Of course not.  
                    It was a woman from his office.

                                    BECKETT
                    I don t understand, if you had 
                    nothing to do with Sara s death,  
                    why did you lie to us?

                                    CLAUDIA 
                    Because my cheating husband has 
                      absolutely no idea that I m about 
                    to serve him with divorce papers.  
                          (off Beckett)
                    I lied because I was at my lawyer s 
                    that afternoon. It wasn t just 
                    Howard who could keep a secret.

      Off Beckett, Castle,

      INT. CASTLE LOFT, CASTLE S OFFICE - NIGHT2323

      Castle is in his home office looking over the ELEVATOR CAM 
      VIDEOS on two different monitors.  WE SEE Sara Manning on 
      both monitors: different shots.  Time clocks running on 
      screens.  Martha enters.

                                  MARTHA
                    What are you watching?

                                  CASTLE
                    Nothing.  

                                  MARTHA
                    You re not webcamming again, I 
                    hope.  

                                  CASTLE
                    I burned a DVD from some security 
                    cameras the police have been 
                    looking at...  And I never web 
                    cam d. 

                                  MARTHA
                    That s your story and you re 
                    sticking to it, huh?  

      Martha leans over his shoulder, looks at monitors, 

                                  MARTHA
                    The police just let you burn a DVD?
                          (off Castle)
                    You realize you re going to have  
                    to stop stealing evidence, right?
                          (beat)
                    I thought the purpose of following 
                    that detective was to help you 
                    write.

                                  CASTLE

                    mind invites a girl that pretty 
                    into her own home. 

      Castle starts it again.  Alexis pops in.

                                  ALEXIS
                    Hey, what are you guys watching?

                                  CASTLE
                    I m watching, she s butting in.  
                          (relents)
                    The police can t find the Nanny s 
                    cell phone.  They were hoping to 
                    lift fingerprints from it.  I just 
                    thought I could see if she had it 
                    with her when she went down to the 
                    laundry room.   

                                  MARTHA
                    And?

                                  CASTLE
                    It s in her hand the first time she 
                    brings the clothes down to wash. 
                    But she doesn t have it when she 
                    went down to use the drier. 

                                  ALEXIS
                    So, she probably left it upstairs 
                    in the apartment where she worked.

                                  CASTLE
                    They say they can t find it.  
                          (beat)
                    Wait a second.

                                  ALEXIS
                    What?

                                  CASTLE
                    There s a five second difference.

      Castle takes it back.  Fast forwards until she gets off.  
      Then goes to the other monitor.  Fast forwards again.

                                  MARTHA
                    A five second difference in what?

                                  CASTLE
                    She rides the elevator twice to the 
                    basement.  Once to put the clothes 
                    in the wash.

                                  CASTLE (cont'd)
                    The second time to put them in the 
                    drier.  Only the second time takes 
                    her five seconds longer. 

                                  ALEXIS
                    Why would it take her longer to 
                    travel the same distance?

                    Only the second time, it took her

                    But I ll bet whoever wore that 
                    condom lives on fifteen.  By the 
                    way, that whole elevator thing?  I 
                    only did it because you smell nice.

      Off Beckett, as Castle knocks on a door.  

                                    BECKETT
                    Castle, what are you doing?  You 
                    can t just knock on people s doors.

                                  CASTLE
                    Why not?

                                    ELDERLY MAN (O.S.)
                    Who is it?

                                    BECKETT
                    Because you re gonna freak them 
                    out.  Police.

      Door opens.  An ELDERLY MAN, 70s stands there.

                                    ELDERLY MAN
                    You re the police? 

                                  CASTLE
                    She is... Sorry to bother you, but 
                    do you live here alone?

                                    ELDERLY MAN
                    Yeah.  Why you wanna know?

                                  CASTLE
                    Doesn t matter.  You re not young 
                    enough. 

                                    ELDERLY MAN
                    Young enough for what?    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    40.


                                  CASTLE
                    To have sex. 

                                    ELDERLY MAN
                    What kinda cops you say you were 
                    again?

                                    BECKETT
                    He s not a cop.  I m a cop.

                                    ELDERLY MAN
                    And you re looking for someone to 
                    have sex with?  

      Just then -- a door opens down the hallway.  A woman, DIANA *
      HARRIS, 38, exits an apartment with a little girl, Becca, the 
      girl we saw in the park with Chloe Richardson.

                                    BECKETT
                    Castle.  Check it out. 

      Castle turns.  Sees them.  

                                  BECKETT*
                          (to Elderly Man)*
                    Sorry to bother you.*

                                    ELDERLY MAN*
                    No bother at all. Stop by any time.*

      Beckett approaches the Diana and Becca.*

                                    BECKETT
                    Excuse me.  But this little girl is  
                    Becca, right?    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    41.


      Off Diana Harris and Becca,

      INT. HARRIS APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER2626

      Castle is looking around the apartment, while Beckett 
      questions Diana Harris, who s re-entered the apartment.

                                  DIANA 
                    I m not sure I m following.

                                    BECKETT
                    Prior to her murder, we think Sara 
                    Manning was coming from this floor.

                                  DIANA 
                    Well, I don t know anything about 
                    it - I was at work.  But maybe she  
                    came up to see Chloe.

                                    BECKETT
                    Chloe Richards.

                                  DIANA 
                    Chloe takes care of Becca.  Sara 
                    and her were friends and our kids 
                    get together for play dates 
                      sometimes.

      IAN HARRIS, 38, enters from the BEDROOM.

                                  IAN 
                    Hun, what s goin  on?  I thought 
                    you guys were going out.

                                  DIANA 
                    It s the police.  

                                  IAN 
                    The police?

                                  DIANA 
                    They think Chloe s friend Sara 
                    might have been up here the day she 
                    was killed.  Wait. You were home 
                    that day, right?

                                  IAN 
                    Um, what day was that?

      Beckett sees Ian s nervousness.  So does Castle. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Tuesday.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    42.


                                  IAN 
                    Yeah.  Yeah.  I was here.

                                    BECKETT
                    Did you see Sara?

                                  IAN 
                    Um, I don t think so.

                                    BECKETT
                    You don t think so?

      Then --

                                  CASTLE
                    Mind if I use your bathroom?  

      They all turn to him.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    No one really thinks about cops, 
                    you know?  When they use the 
                    bathroom.

                                  DIANA 
                    Second door on your right.

      Castle moves off.

                                    BECKETT (IN B.G.)
                          (to Ian Harris)
                    So?   Tuesday.

      INT. HARRIS APARTMENT, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS2727

      Castle enters.

                                  IAN (O.S.)
                    Let me think a minute.

      Castle closes the door.  Goes to the medicine cabinet.  
      Searches.  FLUSHES.  Keeps searching: finds what he s looking 
      for: a BOX of CONDOMS.  

      INT. HARRIS APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS2828

      Castle re-enters the room.

                                    BECKETT
                    So, then you re saying you can t 
                    say for sure one way or the other.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    43.


                                  IAN 
                    Well, after Chloe got here to take 
                    care of Becca, I went inside to 
                    take a nap.  I work most nights...  

      Castle walks behind Beckett, whispers in her ear: 

                                  CASTLE
                      Condoms... 

      It unsettles Beckett. 

                                    BECKETT
                    What... is it you do, Mr. Harris? 

                                  IAN 
                    I m a musician.   

      Castle crosses behind Beckett again.  Whispers again.

                      CASTLEIAN 
      Condoms in the bathroom.So, it s possible Sara might 
                                                  have been up here, but I 
                                                    couldn t really say for sure.

      Off Beckett,

                                  DIANA 
                    You know, maybe you should talk to 
                    Chloe about this.

                                    BECKETT
                    I already have.

                                  DIANA 
                          (growing suspicious) 
                    And what did she tell you?

      Castle takes his phone out, surreptitiously dials a number.

                                    BECKETT
                    That she d seen Sara earlier that 
                    day.  But she didn t say anything 
                    about Sara being in your apartment.

                                  DIANA 
                    What else would Sara be doing here?

      On Ian Harris, just then in the background: the MUSIC TONE 
      from Sara Manning s cell phone.

                                  DIANA 
                    What is that?    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    44.


                                  CASTLE
                    Sounds like someone s cell phone.

      Beckett looks over at Castle, knows he s up to mischief.

      Ian Harris is caught.  

      His Wife realizes it now, heads into the BEDROOM,

      INT. HARRIS APARTMENT, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS2929

      WE FOLLOW into a bedroom, see the curtained window from the 
      Cold Open.  And the rug.  

      Diana walks around to the other side of the bed.  And there s 
      the cell phone on the floor, exactly as we saw it last, under 
      the edge of the bed. 

                                  DIANA 
                    Ian?  Who the hell s phone is that?

      Off Ian Harris,


                                    END ACT FOUR    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    45.


                                        ACT FIVE

3030INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - EVENING 

      Castle and Beckett are in with Ian Harris, Sara s phone on 
      the table.

                                  IAN 
                    Maybe she dropped it, I don t know.

                                    BECKETT
                    You told me you went into the 
                    bedroom to take a nap.  How could 
                    she have dropped her phone there 
                    without you having seen her?

                                  CASTLE
                    She s right. It doesn t make sense 
                    when you think about it.

                                    BECKETT
                    We re running a test on the condoms 
                    we took from your medicine cabinet. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Now there s something you never  
                    wanna hear...

                                    BECKETT
                          (beat)
                    If the spermicide s a match, you re  
                    looking at a murder charge.

                                  IAN 
                    I didn t kill Sara.

                                  CASTLE
                    But you were sleeping with her.

                                  IAN 
                    We had sex, okay?  But when Sara 
                    left my place, she was fine.

                                    BECKETT
                    You followed her down to that 
                    basement, didn t you? You followed 
                    her down there and you killed her. 

                                  IAN 
                    No. I would never hurt Sara.      Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    46.


                                    BECKETT
                    Wouldn t hurt her?  You re a 
                    married man sleeping with her in 
                    your own bed.

      Castle jumps in --

                                  CASTLE
                    What time did she leave your 
                      apartment?

                                  IAN 
                    A little before one.

                                  CASTLE
                    How can you be sure?

                                  IAN 
                    Because Chloe gets back from the 
                    park with Becca everyday around one 
                    to give her lunch.  And Sara left 
                    maybe ten minutes before Chloe got 
                    back... Look, ask Chloe.  She ll 
                    tell you, I was there. There s no 
                    way I could have killed Sara. 

      A lawyer, FRANK GARRISON, appears.  

                                  GARRISON
                    Detective Beckett? Frank Garrison.  
                    I ve been retained to represent Mr. 
                    Harris and I m directing him not to 
                    answer any more of your questions.

                                    BECKETT
                    Your client can answer my questions 
                    here or in front of a grand jury.

                                  GARRISON
                    If you have enough charge him, do 
                    it.  Otherwise, he s coming with 
                    me.

      Beat.  Off Beckett: she doesn t have enough. 

                                  GARRISON
                    Let s go, Mr. Harris.

      Ian Harris gets up, walks out.

                                  CASTLE
                    Guess it makes it tougher when they 
                    actually know the rules, huh?     Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    47.


      Beckett gets up, exits.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - EVENING3131

      Beckett, Montgomery, Ryan and Esposito kick it around. Ryan s 
      getting off the phone.

                                  RYAN
                    Lab says condoms are a match.

                                  CAPT. MONTGOMERY

      Castle enters the bullpen area.

                    Look, if Chloe was home by one 
                    o clock there s no way he had time 
                    to get down to the basement, kill 
                    Sara, then get back upstairs.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Maybe we oughta pick Chloe up?  See 
                    if she backs his story?

                    Our suspect says the victim left 
                    his apartment about 12:45.  The 
                    camera in the elevator puts her on 
                    it headed to the basement at 12:48.  

                                  RYAN
                    We think she was murdered maybe 10

                    Maybe she left the kid in the park 
                    with one of the other nannies.

                    Harris said she came home with his

                    The difference is: coincidences

      Beckett, Ryan, Esposito and Castle exit the elevator onto the 
      15th floor.  They make their way to the Harris apartment.  As

                    Okay, stack up.

      Beckett inches closer, as Esposito and Ryan take positions 
      behind her. She peers through the open door; sees: the sliver 
      of an image of Ian Harris lying on the floor.  

                                    BECKETT

                    in on three.  1, 2, 3!

      Beckett bursts into the apartment with Esposito and Ryan 
      right behind, guns raised, button-hooking around her.

                    Mrs. Harris, is your daughter with

                    I don t know.  She must have used 
                    her key.  I was giving Becca a 
                    bath; I didn t even know she was 
                    here.  

      Just then -- a WALL PHONE by the front door BUZZES.

                                  DIANA 
                    That s the doorman from downstairs.

      By now, Castle is standing at the open apartment door.  

                                    BECKETT
                    Answer it.

      Castle picks up the phone, as Diana finds her husband.

                    A tenant just told the doorman that 
                    there s a girl in the laundry 
                    room... And she has a knife.

      Esposito ushers EVERYONE toward the STAIRWELL, while Beckett 
      draws her weapon to a low-ready position.

                                  CASTLE
                    So, what s the plan?

                                    BECKETT
                    To get everyone out of this alive.

                                  CASTLE
                    That s a good plan.

                                    BECKETT
                    You don t go in. Do you understand?

                                  CASTLE
                    Yes.

      Beckett raises her weapon, comes to the open door of the 
      laundry room, peers inside cautiously, revealing...

      INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - CONTINUOUS3939

      ... Chloe, sitting on a folding chair in front of the drier, 
      where Sara Manning s body was found, holding a butcher knife. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Chloe?

      But Chloe doesn t turn to Beckett.

                                    BECKETT
                    Chloe, it s Detective Beckett.  Do 
                    you remember me?  

                                  CHLOE
                    Please.  Just go away.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    55.


                                    BECKETT
                          (creeping closer)
                    I m sorry, but I can t do that.  

      Chloe presses the knife against her leg.  Beckett can see 
      blood seeping through Chloe s pant leg.

                                    BECKETT
                    Look Chloe, you re hurt. Just put 
                    the knife down and let me help you.

                                  CHLOE
                    Why don t you just shoot me.

                                    BECKETT
                    Hey.  Hey.  Look at me.  

      Chloe turns to her.

                                    BECKETT
                    No one s shooting anyone, okay?

      Beckett lowers her gun.  Then notices Castle peering in.

                                    BECKETT
                    Unless it s you, if you take one  
                    more step in here.

      Castle raises his hands, backs off slightly. 

                                  CHLOE
                    He was sleeping with Sara. 

                                    BECKETT
                    I know.

                                  CHLOE
                    Only the whole time he was sleeping 
                    with me, telling me that he loved 
                    me, that he was going to leave his 
                    wife for me.

                                    BECKETT
                    Guys can be like that sometimes.  
                    They can lie... And I know when you 
                    find out, how it can break your 
                    heart.

      Off Castle, learning more,

                    I m pregnant.     Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    56.


                                    BECKETT
                    Then that s just another reason for 
                    you to get some help.  Right?  

                                  CHLOE
                    I only came down to talk to her, 
                    that s all.  To tell her that Ian 
                    and I were in love...

                                    BECKETT
                    I know what happened with Sara was 
                    an accident, Chloe.  I know that.

                                  CHLOE
                    I left Becca in the park and came 
                    back to the apartment to see if it 
                    was true.  When I saw Ian s bed, I  
                    knew... He went to take a shower, 
                    so I came down here to talk to 
                    Sara.

                                    BECKETT
                    I know you didn t mean to kill her, 
                    Chloe. 

                                  CHLOE
                    She was my friend; but she just 
                    didn t get it.  When she turned 
                    around, I grabbed the bleach and I 
                    hit her.  And she fell.  After, I 
                    was so scared, I didn t know what 
                    to do, so I put her in the drier.  

                                    BECKETT
                          (beat)
                    Chloe, put the knife down and let 
                    me help you.  Then me and you can 
                    walk out of here and we won t let 
                    this guy ruin your life anymore 
                    than he already has.  

      Beat.  Chloe then nods softly, lowers the knife.  

                                  CHLOE
                    I m so stupid.

      Beckett moves in and takes it from Chloe s hand.  Off Castle,

      EXT. BUILDING, STREET - NIGHT4040

      Chloe, handcuffed, a bandage around her leg, is placed in a 
      police car.  Ian Harris, conscious, on a GURNEY being loaded 
      into an AMBULANCE.  Diana stands a discreet distance away.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    57.


                                  CASTLE
                    Looks like I managed to make it 
                    through the case without getting 
                    injured, shot or killed.

                                    BECKETT
                    Yeah, well, maybe tomorrow.

                                  CASTLE
                    By the way, really loved that whole 
                      sisterhood thing you ran back 
                    there. 

                                    BECKETT
                    I wasn t running anything, Castle. 
                    What this guy did has consequences.  
                    Only he ll get to just walk away.

                                  CASTLE
                    Not scot-free, he won t. I m 
                    sensing a pretty big divorce 
                      settlement in his future. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Whatever it is, it won t be enough.

      Off Castle, as Beckett gets in her car.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CASTLE LOFT, CASTLE S OFFICE - NIGHT4141

      Castle is in his home office, writing on his laptop.  

      CU - on laptop and its text:  Nikki Heat had been in love. 
      That was obvious.  But what he didn t know until that very 
      moment was... (note: following text is revealed as Castle 
      types it)... her heart had once been broken.

      Just then Alexis stops by, sticks her head in the door.

                                  ALEXIS
                    So?  Did you guys get him?

                                  CASTLE
                    On their way up the river as we *
                    speak.*

                                  ALEXIS
                    Cool.  Was it who you thought?

                                  CASTLE
                    Actually, it wasn t.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    58.


                                  ALEXIS
                    Wow.  Must ve been a pretty good 
                    story to surprise you... Better be 
                    careful or you ll turn into one of 
                    your readers.

                                  CASTLE
                    Okay, now you ve ruined it.

                                  ALEXIS
                    You know it s okay to be surprised   
                      sometimes.  That s the fun.

                                  CASTLE
                    You surprise me all the time.

                                  ALEXIS
                          (smiles)
                    See you in the morning, Dad.

                                  CASTLE
                    Night, Pumpkin.

      Castle looks at his laptop; Alexis then stops. 

                                  ALEXIS
                    Dad?

                                  CASTLE
                    Yep?

                                  ALEXIS
                    Thanks for being my nanny.

      He looks up at her: He s a lucky father.  

                                  CASTLE
                    No sweat, kiddo.

      Alexis moves off, beat, Castle closes the laptop and opens 
      the top drawer looking for something.  It s not there, so he 
      opens another drawer.  Finds it: a small framed photograph of 
      Castle and Alexis, when she was 4, in a park, walking hand-in-
      hand, away from camera, their backs toward us.
