A VIRGIN AIR 747 bursts through the clouds and levels off.
-- James Earl Jones, still holding Pasqual in a bear hug.
They plummet, wind violently tearing at them. Pasqual's
frantic SCREAMS doppler quite nicely.
DROPPING WITH THEM
They continue to fall, gaining speed. Pasqual is
terrified, but Jones doesn't seem worried. In fact,
casually, he glances at his watch, and then looks --
FAR BELOW THEM - ACROSS THE SKY
At the tiny black speck gradually grows larger in the
distance...
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
4.
CLOSER - ON THAT BLACK SPECK
It's a jet helicopter. Its door opens, and now a SKYDIVER leaps
out, helmet down, arms back, streaking across the
sky in aerodynamic perfection, heading directly towards
JONES AND PASQUAL
who are still plummeting toward the earth at terminal
velocity. Jones begins to let go of Pasqual, who SCREAMS
and tries to clutch onto him, desperate.
JAMES EARL JONES
(over the rushing wind)
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER. WE HAVE
COMPANY.
PASQUAL
WHAT?
Suddenly -- WHOMMPPPH!! -- the skydiver spread-eagles,
stopping the wild dive directly behind Pasqual, and
immediately binds his arms and straps a parachute on him.
All three are still free-falling.
James Earl Jones nods at the Skydiver who, even under the
helmet and goggles, is clearly a beautiful woman.
Meet ALEXANDRA "ALEX" MUNDAY, one of Charlie's Angels.
She's a sultry bombshell -- a classic femme fatale --
only she's playing for the good guys.
She gives James Earl Jones a wink, then jerks Pasqual's
rip cord and -- WHOOMPH. Pasqual's chute deploys. He
flies upward, leaving --
Alex and James Earl Jones, both still falling.
Below the
ocean screams up at them. Not much time left.
James Earl Jones pulls his belt -- and his mufti flies
up. It's actually a tiny drogue chute, deploying his
entire dashiki. His outfit hides a parachute rig.
Alex pulls her own rip cord and -- WHOOMPH -- her chute
unfurls, and now...
Alex and James Earl Jones gently float towards --
A cigarette boat floats through the choppy water, a
gorgeous young woman expertly throttling up the growling
V-8.
Say hello to NATALIE THOMPSON, Charlie's second angel.
At a glance, she's the brainy-shy girl next door.

CONTINUED:
But put her behind the wheel of any vehicle, and she's
unstoppable.
Natalie glances ahead, maneuvering the boat perfectly under
Alex, who drops on deck. Alex gathers her chute, then whips off
her helmet to give her cascading mane a wild shake.
Here comes James Earl Jones. Natalie guns the boat
underneath...a perfect catch. Alex helps him with his
dashiki-chute, and then all three look up...
Here comes Pasqual. Natalie whips the boat around,
catching him as he helplessly drops into the seats, still
bound, still scared out of his wits. He gapes wild-eyed
at the two Angels, then whirls on James Earl Jones.
PASQUAL
You crazy bastard!
JAMES EARL JONES
I think you mean crazy bitch.
With that, James Earl Jones reaches up and pulls his face
off. Latex rips free, and standing there (without his
dashiki, James Earl Jones has a great figure) is...
... stunningly beautiful DYLAN SANDERS, angel number
three. She's the wild one.
Pasqual's jaw drops as Dylan shakes her hair free, then
reaches in her mouth --
DYLAN
(still with James Earl Jones' voice)
Don't need this anymore.
-- and extracts a voice-modifying chip.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
(now in her real voice)
But I sure could use this.
And she pulls from her pocket the airplane-size bottle of
Johnnie Walker Black. She twists it open and downs it.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
Damn I hate to fly.
Now, MEN IN "FBI" WINDBREAKERS haul Pasqual away, two of
them carefully handling the certs-explosive. A harmless
fellow pushes his way past them and onto the dock.
It's JOHN BOSLEY, Charlie's lieutenant.
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

CONTINUED:
He reaches the boat, which Natalie ties off while Alex
and Dylan neatly fold their parachutes.
BOSLEY
Well, Angels, the experimental
explosives are back in the hands of
the government, and the free world
can breathe just a lit-tle bit
easier tonight, thanks to you three.
Alex, Natalie and Dylan stroll from the dock onto the sand,
each starting to unzip/unbutton/unsnap their action gear and
hand it to Bosley as they continue walking.
NATALIE
And thanks to you, too, Bos.
ALEX
We couldn't have redirected the
flight path without your help.
Bosley puffs, proud. He speaks over the ever-growing
pile of chutes, body suits, goggles, the dashiki...
BOSLEY
Nothing a little teamwork can't do.
At least, that's what Charlie's
always telling us, right ladies?
DYLAN
Charlie will be joining us, won't he?
BOSLEY
He sends his regrets. But he
wanted you to know that dinner is
on him, so feel free to celebrate.
By now, the Angels have stripped off all of their
equipment, revealing eye-popping evening gowns.
ALEX
If it's on Charlie, we will.
The Angels share a laugh as they arrive in their sassy
duds at a private beach club, where a WAITER greets them
with a tray of champagne flutes.
They each take a glass, turn to each other and raise
them. Another Angels Mystery... Case Closed.
FREEZE FRAME.
And the TITLE SEQUENCE BEGINS...
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Once upon a time...

CONTINUED:
THREE FOURTH GRADE SCHOOL PHOTOS FILL THE FRAME, side by
side by side. These are three very different girls.
NATALIE, with a page-boy cut and wearing a Catholic
schoolgirl's uniform, sports glasses and braces; a bit
awkward and gangly, even shy.
ALEX, formally dressed with perfect pig-tails, is
sophisticated and self-possessed; a class act, even at ten.
DYLAN, wild blond hair and faded T-shirt, has a jaded,
street-wise smirk; even at this young age, her isolation
and disillusionment are masked by seeming confidence.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
... there were three very
different little girls.
The triptych remains on screen.
Now it shifts into:
VIDEO TAPE - THE THREE GIRLS (STILL IN TRIPTYCH)
Now TEENAGERS, on HOME VIDEO.
NATALIE, working the A-V equipment at school, hides her
face in embarrassment, uncomfortable with the camera.
FREEZE.
ALEX, in riding gear, accepting her steeple-chase trophy.
She knows where to look for the camera. FREEZE.
DYLAN, smoking with her tough-girl friends in the girls'
room of her reform school, is caught on camera. She
flips it off. FREEZE.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Who grew up into three very
different women.
TRIPTYCH CONTINUES
They're all WOMEN now, in their early twenties.
NATALIE, a research fellow at MIT (and beautiful, but not
flaunting it) demonstrates a chess-playing computer
program to a room of impressed advisors.
ALEX, valedictorian at Oxford, passionately delivers her
address to a crowd of rapt students, faculty and parents.
DYLAN, in leather and a helmet, steps off a Harley. She
sees a punk with a mohawk slapping around his girlfriend.
She decks him, then enters the back door of a seedy punk bar.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
With three things in common...
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

TRIPTYCH ENDS
With photographs again. The women, as they are now:
Natalie, Alex, Dylan. All gorgeous, all self-assured.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
They're brilliant. They're
beautiful. And they work for me.
Now, FIREBALL EXPLOSIONS completely fill the screen.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
My name is Charlie.
ANGEL SILHOUETTES appear, in flames.
New MUSIC kicks in.
"CHARLIE'S ANGELS"
...And a new title sequence takes over:
VARIOUS SHOTS:
MONTAGE (OVER MUSIC)
Credits continue as we watch the Angels in action (from,
presumably, previous adventures...)
-- A microscope-peering Natalie cuts a ruby, drops it in
a laser housing, shoots a red beam.
--
Dylan, wielding kendo sticks, spars with two Yakzuza.
-- Alex side-kicks two baddies, spins, drops a third.
ZOOM BACK: she is at the Parthenon.
-- A motocross race. Natalie digs in for the finish,
attacking the last jump with gusto.
-- Dylan, in traditional Islamic robes, finds a secret
switch. She pushes back a bookcase to reveal secret stairs.
-- At a ballroom dance competition, Alex wows the crowd
while keeping her eye on a nefarious couple.
-- Bosley, as "Luka, the Bad Ass Pimp," bitch-slaps a
couple of "ho's" -- actually Dylan and Alex -- then winks
at them as unsuspecting drug dealers back off, scared.
--
Natalie bites into a messy hot-dog, has to just laugh.
-- The three angels elbow their way through a roller-
derby match.
-- In orange prison jumpsuits, Alex and Dylan work in
female chain-gang.
-- Window-washer Natalie peers into a skyscraper office,
surreptitiously photographing the meeting inside.

-- On an Italian street, the three Angels buy a paper,
grin at the headline, "Mystery Women Save European
Union." As they high-five, Dylan's cone of gelato drops
to the sidewalk. The Angels look at it, look at each
other...and just have to laugh.
TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS.
OVER BLACK we hear a DIGITAL RING...
Blinded by the daylight, Dylan emerges from below,
relieved to see the boat is docked. Chad follows her
outside, pleading...
CHAD
C'mon Dylan. You + Me. It's
magic.

DYLAN
It's a mistake. A horrible,
horrible mistake.
She jumps onto the dock.
CHAD
Then how come we keep getting back
together? It's fate.
Dylan just keeps walking.
CHAD
(yelling after)
Is it because I live on a boat?
WHIP TO:
CLOSEUP - MAN'S FACE
This is Jason Gibbons, handsome, action-movie stud.
He's
concentrating fiercely.
ALEX (O.S.)
If you don't defuse this bomb,
Logan, L.A.'s going to be a new
underwater attraction.
A bead of sweat drops down Jason's face.
JASON
Get off my back, Sanchez.
I know
what I'm doing.
REVEAL ALEX, her face right next to his.
ALEX
Which wire?
The red one or the blue one?
JASON
Marix has a thing for red. Red
cars, red boats, red-headed hookers.
ALEX
So the red one.
JASON
That's why I'm gonna say blue.
He makes a "snip" motion.
They both breathe a sigh of relief.
ALEX
You saved the world again, Logan.
She leans forward, closer and closer, right in his face.

JASON
That's my job.
Alex kisses him. It's a damn good kiss.
Jason's into
it, but pulls away for a second.
JASON (CONT'D)
I don't think Sanchez would kiss
me. He's a forty-year-old man.
Pull back to reveal...
ALEX and JASON are in a fully macked out Airstream,
sitting on a bed, leaning over an open screenplay. We
can tell from our surroundings that Jason is a big deal
Hollywood action star, and this trailer is his home away
from home.
She licks the bridge of his nose, then kisses him again.
ALEX
Let's have it rewritten.
As she smiLes, a cell phone RINGS. Both Alex and Jason
reach for their phones. It's hers.
ALEX (CONT'D)
Hello?
Jason stands in the doorway in his robe as Alex tosses
her stuff in the back of a very excellent car.
JASON
So when you coming back?
ALEX
Not sure.
Whenever I can.
I'll
call you.
JASON
Oh, great, that's helpful.
(watching her prepare to go)
I don't get it, what kind of
executive assistant is on 24 hour call?
ALEX
A very good one.
JASON
You ask me, your boss is an asshole.

When do I get to meet this Charlie
guy, anyway?

ALEX
Charlie's not very social.
JASON
Yeah, well I think you should
quit.
ALEX
Charlie needs me.
JASON
I need you.
Alex looks back -- that was more personally revealing
than she expected.
A P.A. comes up next to Jason.
P.A.
Mr. Gibbons?
We're ready for you
on the set.
Jason nods, then back to Alex.
JASON
I gotta go save the world.
Alex smiles at the irony of that.
ALEX
My hero.
She blows him a kiss and speeds off.
Natalie KNOCKS on the door to 113.
A beat later, the
door swings open to reveal BOB.
Natalie SCREAMS in astonishment.
BOB
(freaked)
What!
Natalie, what?
NATALIE
I thought you were dead.
She pushes past him.
Passing cars reveal the one and only CHARLES TOWNSEND
DETECTIVE AGENCY. That's what the sign says.
Establishing...
Built into the Palm Springs Hills, this very exclusive
spa has a fantastic view of the desert.
Dressed in a crisp spa uniform, Alex has a sidebar with a
white-robed Bosley. She shows him a tiny electronic
device shaped like a bullet.
ALEX
This is a transmitter. I'll be
able to hear everything you say.
BOSLEY
Where do I hide it?
(leaning close)
I'll be nude.
Alex takes a plastic cup, drops the transmitter into it.
Covers it over with ice chips from a nearby bucket.
Bosley nods, clever.

ALEX
Try to get Corwin to talk about
the industry, Knox, anything.
BOSLEY
Understood.
She points him in the direction of the men's spa.
But he's
frozen with excitement.
BOSLEY (CONT'D)
I'm going undercover.
ALEX
I know.
You'll do great.
Nat and Dylan smash through the exit doors and out into
the sun-drenched streets of beautiful, downtown Los
Angeles. Natalie immediately spots the Thin Man, booking
down the alley.
NATALIE
That way.
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

CONTINUED:
And they take off after him.
What ensues is the fastest, wildest, two chicks and one
guy foot chase you've ever seen. Here are some highlights:
-- Thin Man pulls himself, clumsily, over a chain link
fence. Dylan and Natalie pull an old Jackie Chan trick
and run up the side wall and hop over easily.
-- Thin Man, still on foot, waits for traffic to slow,
then darts across the Harbor Freeway. By the time Dylan
and Natalie get there, traffic is roaring again.
Undeterred, they make their way through, tucking and
rolling under the wheels of a moving semi.
-- Dylan is racing down an alley, when a car comes barrelling
at her. She leaps up onto the hood of the car as it drives
underneath her, a la one of those That's Incredible! stunts.
-- They chase the Thin Man into an industrial laundromat.
The scene goes something like this:
The sign says it:
Welcome to Aspen.
VARIOUS ESTABLISHING SHOTS of the gorgeous mountain town,
still somehow quaint despite its astonishing wealth.
A rowdy establishment just outside of town.
A VW van climbs the winding road.
As we get closer, we see the
side reads, "Chalet Grams."
A DING-DONG DING-DING-DONG doorbell rings.
Thug One opens the door to find Dylan and Natalie dressed
in Swiss Miss outfits, complete with blonde braids.
DYLAN
Guten Tag!
NATALIE
(correcting Dylan)
Guten Morgen!
DYLAN
(correcting Natalie)
Guten Nacht!
DYLAN AND NATALIE
(to each other)
Guten Freund!
The girls lean in and hug each other, butts sticking out.
To the left, Bosley starts playing oommpa OOMMPA oommpa
OOMMPA on a wrap-around tuba. He's wearing lederhosen,
with a feather in his hat.
Natalie begins to YODEL.
Dylan hands a fancy envelope to the bewildered thug. Thug
Two is approaching from behind, curious what the hell is
going on.
Dylan begins to TALK-SING a song in German about a too-
curious goat and his worried mistress. Even with the pantomime,
we have no idea what's happening. It seems
wholesome, but occasionally one of the girls touches the
other in a weirdly coquettish, oddly sexual way.
Thug Two looks at the address on the envelope.
THUG TWO
(low)
They got the wrong address.
THUG ONE
Shut up.
As the angels continue their routine, the CAMERA RISES,
three quick cuts to take us to...
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
34.
... where a black cat-suited Alex stands at the
chimney... A ribbon of smoke curls from the stack.
Pulling the pin from a canister, she drops it down the
chimney.
Bosley is about to hyper-ventilate on the tuba, sweaty
and a little blue.
Dylan and Natalie's new song has them sharing the saddle
of an imaginary horse. When Dylan reaches back to slap
the "horse," she hits Natalie in the rump. Both women
tee-hee.
The thugs think it's pretty hot.
Dylan whispers a secret to Natalie.
Natalie WHISPERS
back.
Turning to the thugs, they each lean in to WHISPER into
a different thug's ear. As the men smile, the angels
suddenly BONK the two men's heads together. Both men
fall, knocked out.
Stepping over the bodies, Dylan heads inside.
Holding down three keys on the tuba, Bosley talks into
the mouthpiece. It has a secret radio.
BOSLEY
Alex, what's your status?
Dylan rushes Knox across the driveway to the waiting van
-- Natalie is pulling it around. Overhead, bright
security lights switch on.
Back at the front door, Alex pulls it shut. She attaches
a carabiner clip to the handle, running a thin steel cord
from it around the porch column.
Running with the tuba, Bosley stops for a moment to catch
his breath, hands on his knees. Okay, ready to run
again.
He's the last to be pulled into the van.
A spray of
gravel and they're off.
One by one, a series of arc lights switches on, forming a
snake all the way to the bottom of the mountain.
The VW Van leads the way down the mountain, tail-first.
As it builds speed, it starts to climb the wall, each turn
getting steeper and steeper.
The two jeeps are following. Facing the right direction,
they have a much easier time of it.
One of the jeeps makes a move, closing the distance to
the van. A RIFLEMAN leans out the passenger window,
lining up a shot. He FIRES.
The front jeep gets even more aggressive, building speed.
It hits the next turn too fast, rising up too high along
the wall. It tips further, and further, finally rolling
over onto its back. It SCRAPES across the concrete, a
shower of sparks as it slows down.
With nowhere to go, the second jeep brakes hard, but can't stop.
It SMASHES into the first jeep, a tangle of steel.

The combined mass continues sliding down the run, like a
jagged pinball in the chute.
A dejected Pete stands in front of the sign for the anime
festival, two tickets in hand.
WHIP BACK TO:
Back facing the right direction, the van charges onward.
The motorcycles race up to the passenger side, grabbing
for the door.
Re-establishing.
Charlie is on the speakerphone.
The angels are in their
usual lounging positions.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
Good work, Angels. Not only did you
save Knox, you saved his company as well.

ALEX

Any special guy you were thinking

Natalie grins a guilty smile.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
Sorry, Angels.
Our work is only
half-done.
Knox enters. Clean-shaven and neatly pressed, he's still a
darn good-looking man. Vivian Wu follows him.
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
Meet your new client, Eric Knox.
KNOX
First off, thank you. You rescued
me, for which I am eternally grateful.
He's talking to all the angels, but his gaze seems to fall
most upon Dylan. She notices it.
KNOX (CONT'D)
But there's still a problem. Whoever
kidnapped me wasn't just trying to
screw up our IPO. They also stole
the proprietary software for our new
web browser. I'm sure it was Roger
Corwin, but I need proof.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
That's where you come in, Angels.
CIRCLING AROUND, we see the video images of Corwin and the
Red Star Systems logo on the big screen.
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
We need to break into Red Star's computer
systems to see if Mr. Knox's software is
indeed being converted for Red Star's use.
NATALIE
Sounds like a plan.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
Not as easy as that, Natalie. Red
Star's headquarters are as tightly
guarded as a military facility.
We're going to need reconnaissance
on their mainframe computer system,
and the best way to get that is
through Mr. Corwin himself.

A video image of Corwin's Palm Pilot Schedule comes up the
bigscreen. The shot pulls in close on "SAN DIEGO SPEEDWAY."
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
We need to pin a camera on him to get
footage of the inside of the building.
Thanks to Alex's work at the health spa,
we know that Corwin will be at the San
Diego Speedway on Thursday. Get close to
him Angels, but don't tip your hand.
ALEX
Consider it done.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
Dylan, I need you to arrange for Mr.
Knox's security. I'd hate to have him
kidnapped again.
DYLAN
Absolutely. But we'd all feel safer
if you could join us, Charlie.
CUT TO:
UNDERWATER
From Charlie's P.O.V., looking up at the sunlight.
Three
manta-rays swim above us.
We can hear the BUBBLES from Charlie's regulator.
CHARLIE
I'd love to Angels. But I'm in a
bit over my head at the moment.
A manta-ray swims past, super-close, letting us...
WIPE TO:
A majestic craftsman in the hills, Frank Lloyd Wright meets
conspicuous consumption.
With a ROAR, another blur of racers whips past, with heat
and noise and speed. The lead car bears the familiar
markings of RED STAR INDUSTRIES. Roger Corwin is at the
wheel, steering calmly to a comfortable lead, when he is
suddenly BUMPED.
CORWIN
What the...?

ANOTHER BUMP sends him screeching to the left. He almost
crashes, then gets back on course, just as he's passed by...
A SLEEK, BLACK CAR, sponsored by the SONY CORPORATION, and
manned by a mysterious driver with TEXAS TORNADO inscripted on
the helmet. We follow the black car as it pulls into the pit.
The racer pulls off her helmet as the pit crew surrounds her.
Of course, the racer is Natalie, aka BETTY LOU HOBERT, the Texas
Tornado.
PIT BOSS
(yelling over the
engine noise)
NICE RACING!
(beat)
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'VE NEVER RACED
THIS TRACK BEFORE!
NATALIE
(Texas accent)
BACK WHERE AH'M FROM, WE RACE IN SWAMPS
AND BACK ROADS! THIS ALL'S A PIECE A CAKE!
Natalie shakes out her hair, winks at the pit boss.
The Pit Crew races in to make repairs. DYLAN, dressed in a
pit suit, kneels by Natalie's front tire. Natalie crouches
down next to her so they can talk.
NATALIE (CONT'D)
I nicked him. Should give you
enough time to do the deed.
DYLAN
I'm on it.
Dylan steals away, heading for...
CORWIN'S PIT CREW --
Corwin is seething mad as he pulls into his pit.
CORWIN
LET'S GO!
WE'RE LOSING TIME HERE!
The pit repairs his car as Corwin is approached by another
racer, also wearing a Red Star racing suit. He leans into
Corwin's car and now we see that's it's... THE THIN MAN.
THIN MAN
You okay, Boss?

CORWIN
No thanks to you! You're supposed

The Thin Man peers over at Natalie, but she's got her
back to him.
THIN MAN
Don't know.
I'll keep an eye out.
CORWIN
Yeah.
You do that.
Corwin peels out onto the track again, almost crushing
the Thin Man in the process.
AS CORWIN PULLS OUT
Dylan sneaks in. In all the cacophony, no one notices
as she grabs CORWIN'S SUITCASE out of the back seat of
his regular car, a bitching Mercedes. She checks both
ways to see if she's being watched.
BOSLEY (O.S.)
Coast is clear, Dylan.
CUT TO:
Where Alex, dressed as a trophy girl, watches the race
through binoculars and keeps an eye on her pals. She
nods to BOSLEY, who is dressed as the Flag Waver. He
speaks into a walkie talkie.
BOSLEY
Let's make the switch.
BACK IN THE PIT --
Dylan pulls a briefcase out of her jumpsuit, and swaps
it with one in Corwin's car. She carefully switches all
his files from the old briefcase to the new one, then
gives Alex a thumbs up.
MEANWHILE BACK IN THE RACE --
NATALIE roars back onto the track, keeping Corwin in her
sights. Then she spots another Red Star car, coming up
right next to her. She locks eyes with the Thin Man.
The two of them recognize each other at the exact same
instant.

The Thin Man, realizing he's been made, jams on the
brakes and skids off to the right, which leads to a ramp
that heads out of the stadium.
Natalie, not wanting to lose him, does something crazy.
Even though she's at the front of the pack, she brakes
hard, swerves into a full 180 degree U-turn, and starts
heading the WRONG WAY on the race track.
Startled drivers pull off to the left and right as she
follows the Thin Man out of the racetrack.
To a chorus of CAR HORNS, the Thin Man's blue racer weaves
through the spectator traffic entering the speedway.
Looking back, we see Natalie is gaining on him.
Finally clear of the traffic, both cars let it rip.
CUT TO:
HELICOPTER VIDEO FOOTAGE
Looking down on a freeway, where a ubiquitous police
pursuit is in progress.
TV ANCHOR VOICE
If you're just joining us, we're
approaching hour five of a pursuit
that has lead us all across the
Southland, at speeds up to 80
miles an hour.
A beat-up gray Chrysler leads a phalanx of police cars
down the empty freeway. It's oddly calm and hypnotizing.
FEMALE ANCHOR VOICE
Chuck, time and again we hear the
question, "Why don't the police just
ram the other car, or shoot out the
tires?" The LAPD has a policy of
hanging back and following unless...
Suddenly, the blue Formula One car comes screeching past
the cops and the suspect, over 200 miles per hour.
TV ANCHOR VOICE
What was that?
With the lanes cleared for the other chase, there is
nothing preventing the Formula One cars from hitting top
speed -- which they do.
Natalie is catching up to the Thin Man.
As they head under an overpass, we see KIDS CHEERING.
... but when you're going 200 miles per hour, that can
take a while. He misses the exit.
Natalie is trying to match his speed.
The Thin Man pulls over to the side, stops fully.
Braking as hard as she can, Natalie still passes him.
The Thin Man throws a U-turn, heading up the freeway on-ramp.
Natalie follows.
We catch glimpses behind fences and between train cars --
the two racers gliding slowly down the narrow roads, like
lions pacing.
We LOOK DOWN on Natalie's car as she rounds a corner,
still searching.
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
53.
Natalie spots the blue racer reaching the end of the
long pier. It pulls a U-turn to face her, then stops,
engine idling. There's only way off the pier, and it's
past Natalie.
The Thin Man REVS his engine.
Natalie REVS hers.
ANGLE ON a white seagull, pecking at something on the
pier, halfway between the two racers. The bird looks up,
hearing the engines.
ANGLE ON the Thin Man. He pulls his harness tighter.
REVS his engine higher.
ANGLE ON Natalie. If it's a game of chicken he wants,
she'll give it to him. She REVS her engine higher still.
The noise scares the bird, who suddenly flies off. Like
a flag being dropped, that's the signal for both racers
to peel out.
A cloud of SMOKE.
Rubber on asphalt.
Already reaching a tremendous speed, the racers are on a
collision course. The Thin Man isn't going to turn away.
Neither is Natalie.
Racing faster, and faster still, there's only one way
this can turn out. But then, at the very last moment,
the Thin Man wusses out. He cuts the wheel right,
missing Natalie and careening off the edge of the pier.
In SLOW MOTION, we watch as his racer hangs in mid-air,
wheels still spinning. Back-heavy, the tail hits the
water first.
Natalie brakes hard, cuts the wheel to avoid going off
the far end of the pier. She finally stops, the rear
tire just 1/4 inch from the edge.
CRANING UP along the side of the pier, we find Natalie
looking into the water where the blue racer went in.
There's just a slick of oil and a steady stream of bubbles.
CUT TO:
VIDEO / CAMERA'S P.O.V.
We see lots of hallways, doorways and security locks, all
from the POV of a man's hip.
The footage is from the camera in the switched briefcase
that Corwin is now carrying with him.

We PULL BACK from the video to see we are actually
watching it...
ANGLE ON Bosley, done up in full clown makeup. He tries
to twist a balloon animal, but no luck. Finally it POPS.
The CHILDREN CRY.
Entertaining the ADULTS, magician Alex whips open her silk
handkerchief to reveal that the "item" has disappeared.

CONTINUED:
ANGLE ON DIRECTOR #2, who looks very worried. Magician's
assistant Dylan takes off her giant hat to reveal the director's
billfold is underneath. Getting it back, he's
relieved.
Passing behind Dylan, Natalie takes the orange keycard
Dylan hands off. FREEZE FRAME. ZOOM IN.
ALEX (V.O.)
Then we have to get back into Red
Star. Problem is, their biometric
sensors are too good.
DYLAN (V.O.)
We need someone's help.
WHIP TO:
ANGLE ON Roger Corwin, driving his Mercedes.
He slows,
a road crew working ahead.
ANGLE ON Dylan, dressed in an orange vest, manning the
slow/stop sign. She makes Corwin stop, leans in to
apologize for the delay.
Behind the Mercedes, Natalie sneaks up. She quickly
picks the trunk lock, then quietly climbs in. She hoists
in a large duffel bag, then shuts herself inside.
Establishing. We see Corwin's Mercedes pull into the
parking garage.
Establishing...
Jason and Alex are walking down a beautiful, tree-lined
cobblestone street, holding hands. The buildings and
outdoor cafes are reminiscent of a quaint, vaguely
European town.

JASON
Alex, I can't tell you how happy I
am you came.
ALEX
Me too.
JASON
No, I mean, it's weird. It's
weirding me out how happy I am when
you're around. Am I sick or something?
ALEX
(smiling)
Got me.
JASON
The only bummer is, I start to
jones when you're not around.
What the hell am I gonna do this
weekend, if you're not with me?
ALEX
We'll get you some sedatives.
You'll be fine.
He stops, takes her in his arms. With the moonlight
shining down, it's very romantic. They kiss. Then...
JASON
Hey.
Wait a second.
Come with me!
ALEX
Come with you?
JASON
Miami, on the Sony Jet. I've got
two tickets to the Final Four.
ALEX
Jason, I don't...
JASON
Wait, before you say no, let me just
say something, okay? I'm sick of how
little we see each other. I'm sick of
stealing a day here, or a week there.
ALEX
It's my job, Jason. I can't
explain it, but I have to be on
call, all the time, and...
JASON
What if I changed all that?

CONTINUED:
JASON (CONT'D)
What if I told you to quit your
job, and come live with me. What
I'm saying, Alex, is that I want
you to...
BLAM!
BLAM!
Gunshots ring out!
ALEX
Gunfire!
Get down!
Alex, in Angels mode, immediately throws him to the
ground and covers him. She feels something wet, looks
down to see Jason's chest, covered in blood.
ALEX (CONT'D)
My God, you're hit. You're...
JASON
Fine.
I'm fine.
(he laughs)
They're squibs, it's fake.
See?
He wipes off a little, puts it on her tongue.
Finally
convinced, she almost lets herself laugh.
REVEAL
that we are in a soundstage, the cobblestones street is
just a set. The gunfire was coming from some effects
guys, who are test firing guns for the upcoming action
scene just outside the soundstage, visible through the
open loading door.
JASON (CONT'D)
Fake guns, too. They're just
setting up for the next scene.
He helps her up.
ALEX
Sorry about that, I...
JASON
(smiling)
God, I loved that. The way you
yelled and everything? Baby, you
been watching too many movies.
(he kisses her on the nose)
Alright, I gotta go reset these.
DON'T GO ANYWHERE. I want to
finish this conversation.
As he walks out of the soundstage, Alex is left behind,
alone. She cleans herself off, shaking her head at her
own paranoia.
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

CONTINUED:
ALEX
Nice, Alex.
Real nice.
THIPP!
A wall next to her sprays a cloud of plaster.
Alex looks
at the hole. That's strange.
THIP, THIP!
Two more little explosions, these barely missing her face.
ALEX (CONT'D)
Hey, is someone firing more squibs
or...
Suddenly, without warning, the wall is plastered with
SILENCED GUNFIRE. It's only Alex's instincts that let
her duck in time to avoid being turned into Swiss cheese.
She tucks and rolls behind a Styrofoam set as...
TWO GUNMEN with silenced SNIPER rifles fan out on the
fake city street.
ON ALEX --
crouched behind a wall.
She looks both ways. If she tries to break for the open
loading door, she'll lead the gunmen right back to Jason.
Only way out of here is to head for the far wall, all the
way across the building, where there's a fire exit.
Taking a deep breath, she darts across the fake street.
THE GUNMEN
fire at her, one of them pulling off his silencer and going
to machine gun mode. The sound of the gunshots are covered
by the sound of the effects guy, test firing guns outside.
ALEX --
Sees that the sets are held up by wooden support beams.
She lifts her leg and delivers a solid blow, cracking the
two-by-fours in half.
THE GUNMEN
move slowly through the fake street set. Suddenly, they
hear a creaking sound. They look up to see the whole,
fake building set collapsing!
They dive out of the way, just in time to see Alex race
through the fire doors.
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
65.
Alex races out of the soundstage and jumps into her car,
parked nearby. The Gunmen emerge from the stage and spot
her, just as she gets the car started. She peels out as
a hail of gunfire just misses her windshield.
Jason has just gotten his squibs refitted. He's facing
the opposite direction, so he doesn't see Alex's car
whizz away in the background.
Dylan and Knox walk hand in hand up a quaint, woodsy path
behind Knox's home. We can hear music drifting up from
the hill in front of them.
DYLAN
Where's that music coming from?
KNOX
You'll see.
Just a little farther.
He helps her up a steep part of the path.
As she comes
over the crest of a hill.
DYLAN
Oh...
(taking in the view)
Oh wow.
DYLAN'S POV --
The hill behind Knox's house has a magnificent view right
into the Hollywood Bowl. The music is the symphony
playing something very romantic.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
That's amazing.
They stand there, together, just listening to the music,
Knox watching her reaction closely.
KNOX
Can I ask you a personal question?
DYLAN
Maybe.
KNOX
How much do you know about Charlie?
Dylan seems surprised by this question.
KNOX (CONT'D)
I just find it strange that you
work for a man you've never met.
DYLAN
Well, I don't know what he looks like,
but I feel like I know him. We all do.
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

CONTINUED:
KNOX
And none of you have any clue who
he actually is?
DYLAN
Nope.
KNOX
And you're never curious to find out?
DYLAN
Of course, but believe me, it's
impossible. I've tried.
(beat)
Let's not talk about Charlie,
okay? Or work.
She smiles t him, motioning for them to go back up to
Knox's house.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
In fact, let's not talk at all.
WIPE TO:
Driving her own highly excellent car, Natalie has it floored.
INTERCUT
NATALIE
I'm ten minutes away. Wait until I
get there.
DYLAN
I can't do that. Call Alex and meet
me here.
NATALIE
Dylan...
But Dylan's already hung up.
Cursing her partner, Natalie
races the car even harder.
Dylan looks over the edge of the balcony. The drop-off is
incredibly steep -- the house is built on stilts -- and the
fall looks like it would kill her. But she doesn't have
much choice.
KNOX AND VIVIAN
come running out onto the balcony, just in time to see Dylan
jump. They rush to the edge, look down into a forbidding
thicket of trees.
VIVIAN WU
She can't have survived.
It's too far.

VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)
(beat)
Still, I should probably check...
Knox shakes his head.
KNOX
We've got more important things to do.
The two of them head back inside.
As they do...
We hold on the railing, then slowly start to drift down, to
the underside of the balcony. Dylan has attached her belt to
the bottom of the railing, and is hanging in the rafters. As
she pulls herself back up...
WIPE TO:
A black sedan pulls onto the tarmac. Knox and Vivian Wu emerge,
then hustle into a waiting private plane.
We PUSH IN over the water to reveal the massive complex -- half-
villa, half-castle. Built into the green hills, it's
flanked by oversized windmills.
DAY
Armed guards, as if they were necessary, make sure no one
goes up or down a staircase that leans up into the tower,
where their dangerous prisoner is being held.
CLOSE ON a satellite mini-dish mounted to the roof. We CRANE
DOWN to look in a tower window, where Bosley is hunched over
the TV.
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
77.
The angels still can't believe they're hearing his voice.
DYLAN
Can we trace him?
NATALIE
Not off a boosted signal. We'd
have to be within 20 miles.
ALEX
Come on, Bosley. Tell us where you are.
A HELICOPTER touches down inside the villa gates.
Knox
and Vivian emerge.
Dylan sneaks her way through the courtyard, doing an
admirable job of trying to stick to the walls. As she
comes around the corner.
THIN MAN (O.S.)
Um, excuse me?
I think you're
trespassing.
She whips around to see the Thin Man, standing right
behind her. She instantly swings at him, he blocks it.
She's about to swing again when five guns get cocked
against her temple. She's surrounded by guards.
NOW --
The thin man and his boys lead Dylan into the house.
THIN MAN (CONT'D)
No offense, but as "storming the
castle" plans go, this one sucked.
DYLAN
Oh yeah? And I suppose you could
do better?
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
81.
CONTINUED:
THIN MAN
Yeah, I sure as hell could.
DYLAN
Oh, right.
THIN MAN
How about an underwater entry? Or
hang gliding over the main tower?
There's a million good ways in, if
you just do your homework.
Dylan glares at him, and as she does...
We move in CLOSE ON Dylan's funky belt buckle.
There's a
tiny camera concealed there.
Natalie and Alex huddle around a three-inch monitor,
getting live video from Dylan's camera.
ALEX
You heard the man.
NATALIE
Nice work, Dyl.
They move into action.
Dylan is led inside by the Thin Man.
Knox is waiting for her.
THIN MAN
Present for you, sir.
KNOX
Dylan, how nice. Welcome to my
Florida home. Not as tasteful as
the one in LA, but much more private.
She shrugs off the goons -- enough already.
DYLAN
So tell me, Knox, what's the brilliant
plan? You gonna sell a list of our
foreign spies to the highest bidder?
Blackmail the President?
KNOX
The first plan is too complicated,
and the second is virtually
impossible.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

CONTINUED:
KNOX (CONT'D)
Besides, I already have all the
money I need and my motivation is
much simpler...
(leaning in close to her)
... revenge.
DYLAN
Revenge?
Against who?
KNOX
You know what? I'm not in a gabby mood
right now. I've got a score to settle.
He flips shut a suitcase filled with C-5 explosive, the
same stuff we saw Pascal selling in the opening scene.
DYLAN
Seems like you're going a bit overboard.
KNOX
No, just leaving myself plenty of
margin for error. Goodbye, Dylan.
With that, he walks out of the room.
The Thin Man signals to the Henchmen. Two of them force
Dylan to sit in one of the wooden deck chairs.
Then, with the thick packing tape, they begin binding her
arms to the arms of the chair. As they do:
DYLAN
I don't know why you bother.
I've
already won.
THIN MAN
Is that so?
DYLAN
Every moment I sit here is a
moment I'm using to figure out how
to take you down. In fact, this
statement -- this one I'm making
right here-- is just me stalling
for time while I decide which of
your goons I'm going to flatten
first.
(whispering)
It's gonna be the guy behind me.
The Thin Man can't help but be amused. After all, there
are six guards and one blonde -- who is now taped to a
chair.
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
83.
CONTINUED:
THE THIN MAN
Really?
DYLAN
By the time your guys are firing,
I'll be at about 180 on my reverse
inverted 360, which will land me
on Fat Boy there, as promised.
(nods to the second guard)
He'll take the chair seat in the
chin.
(re: two others; very slowly)
Now... I'm warning both of you:
I'm going to get you to shoot each
other. I know. Cliche as that
sounds.
(then to the last two)
Last, you guys -- hell, I'll make
something up. We'll have fun.
The Thin Man smirks oh-so-confidently.
THE THIN MAN
And what will you do to me?
DYLAN
You won't even be here. I mean, I
don't want to tell you how to do
your job, but you should've killed
me by now. Because I already know
that your people are onto my
people, which means any moment now
you're going to be called out to
go and deal --
Suddenly the door flies open and --
DYLAN (CONT'D)
Ah!
See?
HENCHMAN AT THE DOOR
We have intruders.
With a glare to Dylan, the Thin Man follows him out.
NATALIE hang-glides into a courtyard, knocking out two
henchmen as she does. Alex catches up with her, as
Natalie pulls out a small scanner.
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
84.
CONTINUED:
NATALIE
Bosley's close.
ALEX
You find him.
I'll get Dylan.
Natalie heads left.
Alex goes right.
From below, we hear SECURITY WHISTLES. The compound has been
breached. Dylan looks at the six armed guards surrounding her.
DYLAN
Here we go.
And now she does exactly what she told the Thin Man she'd do:
She pitches forward, ducking her head so the chair's back
crashes into the railing, tearing it off. She stands.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
Okay, that part worked.
The Guards FIRE -- but Dylan has already launched herself
from the railing into that backflip, which lands her on
the head of --
Fat Boy, flattening him bad, and smashing the rest of the
chair into kindling. She grabs the wooden seat and whips
it up, catching bullets from Guard #3 before flinging it
like a Frisbee at Guard #2, nailing him right on the chin.
Quickly she stands again, between Guards #3 and 4.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
Now, guys, I warned you. This is
where you shoot each other.
The two men scoff, disbelieving. Then Dylan does a head
fake, both Guards panic, and fire, but Dylan drops, leaving
each man a clear shot at the other. Both gape. Both fall.
Just Guards #5 and 6 left.
Dylan's chair arms are still
taped to her forearms.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
Okay, here's where we improvise.
In a whirl, she overhead-chops Guard #5. Drives her
right arm into his shoulder while swinging her left arm
into the back of the Guard #6's head.
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
89.
CONTINUED:
A few more blows, then both men fall.
Now Dylan drops into a second chair, half-exhausted,
half-amused with herself. Has one brief beat to take it
all in, then --
Bosley steps onto the veranda, sees Dylan sitting in the
chair.
FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW: It looks like Dylan -- whose
arms are still strapped to the arms of the first chair --
is taped to the chair she now sits in.
BOSLEY
Oh my God, let me help you.
Bosley hurries over, "freeing her." Amused, Dylan lets
him. Natalie steps out from inside, pausing to KICK one
guard who was starting to revive.
CUT TO:
Knox, carrying the briefcase bomb, gets into his waiting
helicopter, followed closely by the Thin Man.
KNOX
Let's GO!
The helicopter quick ascends, just as...
DYLAN (O.S.)
Damn!
THE THREE ANGELS
run into the courtyard.
NATALIE
Don't worry, we'll get him.
DYLAN
You don't understand. He's got a
pound of C-5 in that briefcase.
ALEX
The question is, where's he headed?
BOSLEY (O.S.)
Miami.
The three angels turn to see Bosley, huffing and puffing
his way into the courtyard.

BOSLEY (CONT'D)
The man Knox is trying to kill has two
general admission tickets to the Duke-
Maryland game at Miami Arena. He's going
to blow up the arena and kill his target.
DYLAN
Not that I don't believe you, but how
exactly do you know all this?
BOSLEY
Because Angels, I was the one who
purchased those tickets.
NATALIE
But Bosley, you HATE sports, why
would you...
(suddenly getting it)
You didn't buy them for yourself.
ALEX
You bought them for...
Bosley lowers his head.
Suddenly all the angels understand.
ANGELS
CHARLIE!
They race out the courtyard, in hot pursuit.
CUT TO:
In gorgeous SLOW MOTION, the three angels walk side-by-side
with a calm assurance, fireballs exploding behind them.
They won.
As MUSIC rises, the ANGELS TRIPTYCH descends, then peels
away to reveal...
The angels kick back on the white sands, tropical drinks in-
hand. Bosley is there as well, with a grass hat and zinc
on his sniffer.
Charlie is on the cellular speakerphone.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
Great work, angels. You'll be happy
to know you received another
presidential commendation.
The Angels, and Bosley, clink glasses.
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
Enjoy your vacation, angels.
THE ANGELS
Thank you Charlie.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

They toast the speakerphone.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
Alex, Natalie -- I know you've been
putting in some long hours on this case,
so I thought you might enjoy a chance to
catch up with some old friends.
NATALIE AND ALEX TURN TO SEE
PETER AND JASON
walking across the beach towards them. Each is carrying a
drink of his own. They wave. Damn those men look good.
Alex and Natalie share a smile.
DYLAN
Any chance you'll be joining us,
Charlie?
CUT TO:
A SUNNY DECK
We're in Charlie's point-of-view. We can see part of his
reflection in the window -- not enough to see his face,
but we get some sense of the man.
He turns away, begins walking.
Steps down onto the sand.
CHARLIE
(to cell phone)
I'd love to, Angels. But I have some
precious treasures to watch over.
With that, he hangs up. We stay in his P.O.V., walking
across the beach. And it's not just any beach.
TO THE LEFT, WE NOTICE
PETE AND JASON
approaching.
We're on the same beach.
Looking right, we see the backs of the Angels and Bosley.
They have no idea that Charlie is walking right behind them.
A beat, then Dylan looks back.
She looks directly as us -- at Charlie -- tracking as we
move past. Does she somehow recognize it's Charlie?
From her reaction, it's not clear.
A beat, then we...
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
103.
REVERSE ANGLE/NOT P.O.V.
Dylan looks back forward again. Did she just see Charlie?
Her smile tells us she thinks she did.
She raises a toast.
DYLAN
To Charlie.
THE ANGELS AND BOSLEY
To Charlie.
They knock glasses.
Right at the moment we should probably fade out, Bosley
spills his icy drink in his lap. His eyes go wide.
The Angels just have to laugh.
We FREEZE FRAME, then...
CUT TO BLACK.
