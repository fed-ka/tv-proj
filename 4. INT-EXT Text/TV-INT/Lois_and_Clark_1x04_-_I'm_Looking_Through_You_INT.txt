	We can see and hear the lightning and THUNDER through the

	desk.  The newsroom is nearly deserted, only our regulars still
	hanging around.  Clark notices Lois busy at the computer,

	at the Daily Planet Clock.


59.	DAILY PLANET CLOCK - CLARK'S P.O.V.	59

	in the light of a THUNDER CRACK we see Lois sleeping soundly,
	her arms wrapped around a pillow.  A beat later she wakes with
	a start when she hears someone KNOCKING on her front door.  She
	sits up, looks at the time, shakes her head.  The KNOCKING
	continues.  Lois throws the covers off, grabs a robe, puts it
	over her pajamas and exits the bedroom.



	Lois walks into the living room.

				LOIS
		All right, already! I'm coming.

	No answer. Lois, immediately suspicious, stands quietly by the

	Nobody there.



	Lois now removes the chain, opens the door wide, steps into the

		I was the invisible Robin Hood,

	Lois and Clark exchange looks.  Lois leans in to him.

				LOIS
		Alan, let's start at the
		beginning. Why?

				ALAN MORRIS
		It's very simple, Ms. Lane. I
		became invisible to become
		visible again.

				LOIS
		I'm not following.

				ALAN MORRIS
		Well, at some point, I don't know
		when exactly, years ago, I
		just... disappeared. I went to
		work every morning, did the same
		thing. I drifted apart from my
		friends.  Helene and I stopped
		talking. I guess, she lost
		interest in me.  I became so
		invisible in my own life, that I
		decided to do it for real. I
		started experimenting.

				CLARK
		Where did you get the idea for
		the suit?

				ALAN MORRIS
		From a florescent light bulb.
		A florescent light bulb turns
		invisible light into visible
		light. I reversed the process.
		It took me fifteen years to build

	Lois and Clark have dozens of files and pieces of paper strewn	(X)
	around the conference room; they've been at it all day and into

		This is impossible.  Even after

		Let's go over it again.  First,

				LOIS
		Jewels?  Collectors items?
		Precious metals?

				CLARK

		But not all precious metals.

	Lois looks at him, then grabs a sheet of typed notes off the

		He's bound to strike again.

	Lois and Clark sit outside on the rooftop, sipping tea. It's	(X)

		Nice.

				CLARK
		Lapsang Suchang. My mother used

		when I was feeling bad. Years

		as good.

	Lois walks over to the roof edge, stares out at the sky.
