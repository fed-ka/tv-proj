      Standing in front of the bathroom mirror, the Man holds an 
      unblinking stare on his own reflection, almost as if waiting 
      for something to happen.  

      Slowly, he unbuttons and removes his shirt to reveal a 
      bruised and slashed body. But then he twists around to reveal 
      a far more alarming wound at his lower back, just above his 
      hip--

      The unmistakable BITE of an ALPHA WEREWOLF.


      Reaching up, the Man swiftly yanks open the blinds. A FULL 
      MOON rises behind the clouds in the night sky.

      Moving quickly, the Man kneels at his bag and pulls out a 
      sawed-off shotgun. With mounting panic, he rifles through his 
      pockets and dumps the contents to the floor--wallet, keys, 
      lighter, SHOTGUN SHELLS.

      He grabs the shells, fumbling them into the chamber of the 
      gun. Raising the weapon, he cocks it and swings the barrel 
      under his chin.        TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/132.

      Behind him, the MOON rises. Its pale light spills in through 
      the window, creeping over his shoulder.

      A BEAD of sweat trickles down his brow as a YELLOW GLOW 
      begins to fill his IRISES. Finger tightening around the 
      trigger, he whispers his last words...

                                  MAN
                    Nous chassons ceux qui nous 
                    chassent.


      BLOOD slips down the glass, over the chipped paint of the 
      radiator and down to where the dead man lies. 

      Seeping into the carpet, the blood pools under the still-
      smoking barrel of the shotgun, widens past the bag and 
      finally reaches the open WALLET. 

      His DRIVER S LICENSE visible, the name underneath the picture 
      of the handsome man reads--

      Exhausted, Scott falls back onto the bed, staring up at the 
      slowly spinning ceiling fan. Stiles falls in next to him.

      Scott and Stiles slowly turn to share a look.

                    Yeah, made more sense in my head.

                    She was totally controlled by 
                    Peter. And she had no idea.

      Falling back on the bed again, Stiles s worried eyes drift to 
      the ceiling and the slowly spinning fan.


      Images blur past--brick and stone, the sliding door--all from 
      the POV of someone barely holding onto consciousness.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Derek--

      Jennifer appears, her face coming in and out of focus.

                    Oh God--this is a bad, very bad 
                    idea. I should be taking you to a

                                  DEREK
                    No... no hospital...

      Slipping out of his peripheral vision, she struggles to carry 
      him inside. DARK BOOTS move into Derek s sight. His own feet, 
      gingerly stepping into the safety of his loft.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Derek, I m losing you. I can t hold 
                      you--Derek.

      The world turns upside down as he collapses to the floor and 
      a wave of darkness surges in.


      Steam fills the bathroom, the shower running. Beneath the 
      spray, Allison pushes the water out of her hair and calls out 
      to the partially open door.

      He steps past the door and into the bathroom. Allison pulls 
      the shower curtain closer.

                                    ALLISON

                    How do you know this wouldn t make 
                    things better? Maybe it could even

      He reaches up, fingers gliding over the plastic of the shower 
      curtain s edge. But Allison grabs him by the wrist.

      He blinks, pulling his hand back. Then looks at her in 
      confusion. He steps back, glancing about.

      But he s already rushing through the door, leaving a very

      to her body.

      across the counter to the DESK CLERK, an older woman turned

                    room. Yet somehow every one of our

      Now trying to look at anything but the Desk Clerk s throat as

      noticing something odd.

      and shallow breathing. Finally, she takes a breath of her own 
      and lets her head fall to his bare chest.

                    Lydia?

      She waves a hand at Allison, quieting her. Then leans in, 
      distinctly hearing a VOICE coming through from the 
      neighboring room.

                                    HUSBAND (V.O.)
                    Which one do you want?

                    I don t know. The smaller one I 
                    guess.

      Fixated on the vent, Lydia inches closer as the VOICES 
      gradually become clearer.

                                    HUSBAND (V.O.)
                    It s okay, smaller is better. Less 
                    kick. I ll chamber the round.

      The unmistakable sound of a bullet slotting into the chamber 
      of a handgun echoes through the vent.      TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/1313.

                    One, two... then pull the trigger.

      Eyes widening, Lydia takes a step back on the bed.

      GUN SHOTS BLAST through the vent, sending Lydia staggering 
      off the bed, hands to her mouth.

                    the other room--they just shot each 
                    other.


      Lydia fumbles for the light switch but it clicks uselessly

                    Lydia, what are you doing?

      A FLOOR LAMP CLICKS ON. Lydia lowers her hand and finds the 
      room is not only empty but in a state of renovation. Plastic 
      sheets cover the furniture. Paint cans surround a work bench 
      on which lies a hand saw and other tools. A HEATER sits near 
      the wall drying the paint.

                    we ve been through, I believe you.

      Not looking at all relieved, however, Lydia s eyes are caught 
      by the wood paneling on the wall. She steps closer, noticing 
      patterns in the grooves of the wood. Like faces.

      But he s alone in the room. Easing back down, he closes his 
      eyes again, trying to fall back to sleep.

      A THUMPING comes from above. Peering up to the ceiling, Isaac 
      listens to HEAVY FOOTSTEPS. Someone moving hurriedly in the 
      second floor room just above.

      Isaac holds still as he hears a frighteningly familiar 
      voice...

                                  LAHEY (V.O.)
                    Hand me the seven sixteenths 
                    wrench.

      Isaac listens to the light CLATTER of steel tools. Until the 
      SHEERING of metal brings a shout of rage from Lahey.

                                  LAHEY (V.O.)

      Isaac turns to get off the bed, but stops when he finds 
      himself facing the INSIDE WALL of an industrial FREEZER. He 
      turns to the other side to face the freezer s opposite wall.

      Gasping, he looks up as--THE FREEZER LID SLAMS SHUT.

                    they re renovating it. Maybe 
                    they ve been scraping brain matter

      FADE IN:


      A GLOVED HAND reaches across the broken pieces of a tiled 
      wall inside the abandoned mall. Lowering his hand, Argent 
      takes a step back, carefully placing his feet into position, 
      arms reaching out as if to yank an unseen person--

      FLASHBACK - Ennis SLAMS into the wall, dust and debris 
      bursting up behind him.

      Argent pivots, then kneels, finding the exact place where--

      FLASHBACK - Boyd tumbles back to the floor, slashed in the 
      chest, blood flying.

      Argent focuses on the now dried blood spatter across the 
      pavement. He carefully retreats back, finding BOOT PRINTS in 
      the dust and dried blood. Placing himself in position of the 
      boots, he glances up to the BURN MARKS on the wall.

      Argent holds still, eyeing the dark burns on the concrete.

      FLASHBACK - Arrows soar past Derek, FLASHBOLTS EXPLODING into 
      brilliant whorls of light--


      The bathroom light FLICKERS above Scott as he stares at his 
      reflection in the mirror. He leans in, studying his eyes. 
      Closer and closer until he can see the tiny striations of 
      color within the iris.

      A GLIMMER OF RED ripples within the brown. Scott jerks back 
      from the mirror and--

      His phone RINGS. Shaking off the strange moment, Scott steps 
      out of the bathroom and picks up his cell from the night 
      table.

      Scott pulls the window blinds up. His mother, Melissa, stands 
      in the parking lot, holding the phone to her ear. Deucalion 
      stands next to her, CLAWED HAND wrapped around the back of 
      her neck, like he was grabbing a dog by its scruff.

                    all of them.

      EYES GLOWING RED, Deucalion rips his hand back, sending 
      DROPLETS OF BLOOD flying into the air as Melissa s knees 
      buckle--

                    Scott?

      He spins to find Stiles in the doorway of the bathroom, a 
      toothbrush in his mouth. Scott turns back to the view of the 
      parking lot, but there s no one there.      TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/1321.

      Scott nods, still focused on the window. A VIBRATING makes 
      him jump. Stiles pulls out his cell phone.

      A MESSAGE from Lydia appears: Need to talk. Just you.

      Stiles slowly glances up from the odd request, noticing Scott 
      still at the window, still staring out.


      Two pairs of BARE FEET slip across the bed spread, one 
        accidentally kicking a backpack to the floor. Making use of 
      only one of the beds, Ethan and Danny look up.

      Smiling, Ethan pulls Danny s shirt off. They kiss, bodies 
      pressing close as Ethan s hands move from Danny s shoulder s 
      to his torso where his fingers brush against a small scar.

                    metal bar put in when I was 
                    fourteen. It stayed there for two 
                    years to support my sternum so my 
                    lungs and heart wouldn t be 
                    crushed.

                    What if there was a way they could 
                      disappear?

                                  DANNY
                    I don t really want them to. I like 
                    them. They make me feel like a 
                    survivor.

      Ethan nods, looking into his eyes with genuine affection.

                                  ETHAN
                    I hope you are.

      Danny peers back at him quizzically. But then Ethan kisses 
      him again, pulling him closer, hands moving up his back, 
      turning him turn over on the bed. 

      As Danny s fingers wrap around his neck, the VERTEBRAE in 
      Ethan s back RIPPLES up, splitting into TWO SEPARATE SPINES 
      beneath the skin.

      Ethan pulls back, a gasp in this throat.

                                  DANNY
                    What? What s wrong?

                                  ETHAN
                    Nothing.

      He looks at his hands, fingers trembling. Danny watches him, 
      confused, as he steps off the bed.

                    Just give me a second.


      Ethan shuts the door of the bathroom, locking it. Breathing 
      hard, he turns to the mirror, twisting around to view his 
      back when--

      SOMETHING PRESSES against the skin of his chest.

      Ethan sucks in a pained gasp, looking down at his rib cage 
      which begins to distend impossibly. And then he sees 
      something more horrifying--

      The face of his brother, Aiden, pushing through the skin. His 
      mouth opening as if screaming his way out of Ethan s body.      TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/1323.



      The bathroom door bursts open and Ethan rushes out with his 
      arms around his torso. He quickly grabs his shirt and pulls 
      it on, moving for the door.

                    Ethan? You okay?*

                    Exactly. So can we get the hell out

      Stiles doesn t respond, eyes caught by the Bible.

                    Let me see that.

      He takes the book from her hands. With Allison and Lydia 
      watching, he carefully pulls a NEWSPAPER CLIPPING out from 
      between the pages.

      Without another word, the three of them go for the door.


      The door bursts open, its flimsy lock snapping apart. Stiles 
      stumbles in and looks up to find Ethan raising the buzzing 
      HAND SAW to his abdomen.

      Stiles seizes Ethan by the arms and manages to wrestle the 
      still spinning saw out of his hands. Slamming to the floor, 
      however, Stiles comes face-to-face with the blade, mere 
      millimeters from its razor sharp teeth as it jerks to a stop.

      Undeterred, Ethan opens his hands, CLAWS unsheathed. But 
      Allison latches onto one hand while Stiles grabs the other, 
      both trying to keep Ethan from literally gutting himself.

      The twin yanks them back, all three tumbling to the floor. 
      Ethan SLAMS into the WALL HEATER and instantly SNAPS his 
      hands away as if touching a burning pot. He whirls on Stiles.

      Bruised and blood-crusted hands pushing against his bed, 
      Derek struggles to rise. But Jennifer hurries over to ease 
      him back.

                    Not like this.

      She doesn t retreat from his stare, however. Instead, she 
      comes closer. Timid--even a little frightened--she softly and 
      cautiously presses her lips to his. 

      Derek barely responds at first. As if he doesn t even 
      remember how to kiss someone. But then--despite his injuries, 
      the bruises, the cuts on his body--he pulls Jennifer to him 
      and begins to kiss her back.


      Room key gripped in his hand, Boyd sits on the edge of the 
      bed, a strangely far off look in his eyes. 

      THE CLOCK RADIO CLICKS ON and he snaps his head around to it. 
      Light STATIC surges from the small speaker. Boyd presses the 
      power button, turning it off.

      It clicks back on by itself. No static this time. Just an 
      airy silence. Boyd reaches to turn it off again--

                    I told you. I was watching her. I

                    tired. And I swear I was watching

      Boyd grabs the clock radio and yanks it up. The cord snaps 
      away from the wall. Even unplugged, it turns back on yet 
      again with an electric CRACKLE.

                                  YOUNG BOYD (V.O.)
                    Is she dead? Is it my fault? Is she 
                    dead--

      Boyd SLAMS the radio to the floor, SMASHING IT to pieces.


      A shadow appears on the floor of the motel s office. Slowly 
      approaching the bullet-proof glass Boyd looks in past the 
      front desk, searching for something...

      Next to a cabinet and shelves sits a large and quite heavy-
      looking SAFE.


      Water plunges from the faucet of an almost full bathtub. 
      Boyd s reflection comes into view. He reaches down, twisting 
      the knob to stop the flow.

      Bare feet stepping into the water, Boyd calmly lifts the 
      motel safe up, carrying it into the tub with him. Carefully, 
      he lies back, letting the weight of the safe push down on his 
      chest.

      Lips and nose sinking beneath the surface, Boyd stares 
      blankly up at the ceiling. And begins to drown...

                    Ah... The Glen Capri.

      Argent holds still, the name of the motel giving him pause.

                                    ALLISON (V.O.)
                    Do you know it?

                                  ARGENT
                    It sounds familiar. Listen, I m

                    No, Dad, it s seriously okay.

                                  ARGENT
                    Allison, if there s something you 
                    feel like you can t tell me...

                                    ALLISON (V.O.)

                                  ARGENT

                                  ARGENT
                    Okay.

      Clicking off, Argent lowers the phone and looks out from the 
      exact same vantage point where Allison fired the flashbolt 
      arrows. Standing in the very same place she stood.


      Through the open bathroom, Stiles and Lydia can be seen 
      rushing into the motel room, racing to Boyd s rescue.

      The safe half covers his body, keeping him completely 
      submerged. Stiles dives his hand into the water, searching 
      about for the drain.

                                  STILES
                    He blocked it--he blocked the drain 
                    with something. I can t get to it.

      Stiles reaches around the safe. Lydia grabs a side, 
      struggling to help.

                    You think I know?

      Unable to even budge the safe an inch, they let go. Stiles 
      steps back and his hand hits the hot radiator behind him. He 
      yanks it away and then does a doubletake.

      Spinning around, Stiles hurtles out of the bathroom and out 
      of the motel room while--


      Lydia backs out of the bathroom, glancing to the open door.

      She quiets, hand coming to her mouth to cover the sound of 
      her own breathing. Hearing SOMEONE ELSE BREATHING.

        Ever-so-slowly, Lydia kneels to look under the bed and GASPS 
      when she sees--

      ISAAC. Curled up in a fetal position, he stares right back at 
      her with wide terror-stricken eyes.

      Lydia staggers back to her feet and spins around just as 
      Stiles hurtles into the room.

                                  STILES
                    I got one.

      Charging into the bathroom, he yanks the cap off and--nothing 
      happens. Frantic, he spins back to Lydia.

                    The cap. It s like a match--the cap 
                    lights it!

      Stiles twists the flare around and sees the coarse burgundy 
      surface of the cap is indeed just like a match. He rubs it 
      against the end of the flare, trying to light it.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Stiles--

                    I m TRYING.

      The flare IGNITES and Stiles shoves it into the bathtub, 
      BURNING BOYD.

      THE SAFE TILTS UP as Boyd lurches out of the water, gasping 
      for air. Eyes darting about as if just now realizing where he 
      is, he grabs hold of the safe and lifts it up.

      With a METALLIC THUD, the safe drops back onto the floor of 
      the bathroom in front of Lydia and Stiles. Breathless, they 
      look up from the safe to Boyd now standing in the bathtub, 
      dripping wet and pulling in deep breaths.

                                  BOYD

      His back gently presses to the tile wall behind him and he 
      slumps down.

      In the main room, underneath the bed, a terrified Isaac 
      watches Stiles kneel down to peer in at him.

                                  STILES
                    Hey, Isaac. Got something here for 
                    ya .

      Stiles uncaps the second flare, LIGHTS IT, and whips it right 
      toward him.


      Sheets wrapped around their bodies, Derek pulls Jennifer onto 
      him, their lips barely parting to catch a breath. Her hands 
      touch his bruised shoulders. As her fingers move down the 
      curve of his biceps, the bruises DISAPPEAR.


      With his lips on Jennifer s neck, Derek never seems to notice 
      that the cuts and wounds on his back continue to slowly but 
      surely disappear.

      Their bodies push together, their embrace pulling tighter, 
      more and more urgent.


      Jennifer and Derek fall back onto the bed. Her hand runs 
      across his chest while the wounds over his body complete 
      their healing.


      With the bright sunlight streaming in through its windows, 
      the door of the bus yanks open and Coach steps inside 
      followed by the Cross Country Team.

      Everyone pauses, however, to notice something odd...       TEEN WOLF EP#306"MOTEL CALIFORNIA"GOLDENROD2/13/1341.

      Scott, Stiles, Lydia, Allison, Isaac and Boyd, all begin to 
      wake up in the seats, clearly having spent the rest of the 
      night on the bus.

                                  COACH
                    I don t want to know. I really 
                    don t. But, in case you missed the 
                      announcement, the Meet s canceled. 
                    We re headed home. Pack it in.

      While the team quickly fills the bus, Scott looks up to see 
      Ethan approach.

                                  ETHAN
                    I don t know what happened last 
                    night, but I know you probably 
                    saved my life.

                    doesn t matter really. Minor 
                    detail.

                    So, I m going to give you 
                      something... We re pretty sure 
                    Derek s still alive.

      Scott and Stiles share a look of surprise.

                    Or Kali goes after him. And we kill 
                    him. That s the way it works.

                    of barbaric FYI.

      Ethan gives a final nod and steps past Allison and Lydia s 
      seat. Noticing something, Lydia stands.

      Before he can respond, Lydia reaches for the whistle just 
      below his neck. When she lifts it a stain of PURPLE DUST is 
      revealed on his shirt.

                    I want that back.

      As he turns, Lydia puts her hand over the whistle s air vent 
      and gives it a short breath. With Stiles and the others

      Grabbing the whistle out of Lydia s hand, he tosses it right 
      out the open window. Then turns back to see Coach glaring at 
      him.

      steps inside. A silhouetted figure sits in a wheelchair by

      Argent turns the wheelchair around to reveal his father, 
      Gerard. Not dead. But the mountain ash combined with the 
      Alpha bite has left him strangely disabled, a constant stream 
      of black blood dripping from his nose which he periodically

                    Argent, checked into the Glen Capri 
                    Motel for a one night stay. In room

                    the back of his skull. The autopsy
