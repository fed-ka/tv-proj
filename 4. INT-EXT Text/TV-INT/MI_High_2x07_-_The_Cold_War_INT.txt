      GESUNDHEIT, GRANDMASTER, FLOPSY, N/SBOY

      A small BOY is in a sealed room.  A brightly coloured
      vapouris sprayed over him.  After a few moments, we hear a 
      series of coughs, sneezes and nose-blowing.  A voice speaks 
    to him over an intercom. 

                                  GESUNDHEIT (O.S.)
                    Go now, my little carrier, and 
                    play with your friends...

      A door opens electronically and the now pale, flu-ridden 
    BOY with a dripping nose slopes off. PETER GESUNDHEIT (45, 
      feeble hypochondriac), his anti-cold mask in place, now 
      enters the empty room.

                                  GESUNDHEIT
                    Project 1914 complete, Sir.  

      A shadowy figure, follows behind. The GRANDMASTER! 

                                    GRANDMASTER
                    Excellent. If we succeed then 
                    you, Gesundheit, a humble 
                      pharmacist, will become chairman 
                    of the largest, most powerful 
                      pharmaceutical company in the 
                    world... Meisster-Grossen!

    The obsessive GESUNDHEIT nods appreciatively as he sprays 
    the room with a powerful antiseptic.

                                    GRANDMASTER
                    And why shouldn t we succeed? 
                    After all, coughs and sneezes 
                    spread diseases!  

    OUT ON the GRANDMASTER s cruel laugh.

                    Over the weekend an epidemic of

      Animated sneezing heads represent the spread of the 
      outbreak. They re everywhere! BLANE looks alarmed.

                    Wow. Here s a familiar headline! 
                    This 1914 virus attacked the 
                    immune system too. 

      ROSE turns, excited.

                                  ROSE
                    How did they defeat it?

      BLANE continues reading another article with a picture of 
      Theodore Tilbury, a stern-looking Edwardian scientist. 

                                  BLANE
                    This geezer called Theodore 
                    Tilbury managed to stop the 
                    pandemic in its tracks.

      DAISY looks blank.

                                  ROSE
                    A pandemic is an epidemic that 
                    spreads across a large region.

      DAISY soundlessly mouths  whatevah .BLANE scrolls up the 
      screen. We see Tilbury again, this time with a test tube. 
      (Note: his wife is in background).

                                  BLANE
                    He created a vaccine.

                                  DAISY
                    Cool! So we just use the same 
                    vaccine! (beat) Right?

      ROSE shakes her head.

                                  ROSE
                    Wrong. Vaccines don t last that 
                    long. What we need is the formula 
                    he used to make it.         The Inside Job - Episode 6 - Shooting Script - 30.07.07(13)

                    Tilbury s papers are housed 
                    someplace called the Museum of 
                    Infectious Diseases. Wouldn t 
                    they have a copy?

                    What loser would go to a museum 
                    about infections?

      ROSE nods in fake agreement then looks hurriedly down at 
    her microscope (clearly shehas been there!)

      DAISY has mastered her Sat Navshoes. As they arrive at the

      DAISY, BLANE

      DAISY and BLANE walk into the exhibition area. DAISY begins 
      blinking rapidly. 

                                  BLANE
                    You got something in your eye?

      A CCTV camera clicks off. The darkened interior is filled 
      with weird medical and anatomical exhibits. A colossal 
      atom/string of DNA twirls from the ceiling. DAISY stumbles 
      into a giant model nose and shrieks.  

                                  BLANE
                    Scchhhh!

      DAISY is momentarily reassured, but then turns and bumps 
      into an anatomical human model. She opens her mouth to 
      shriek again but this time BLANE is able to cover her mouth 
      with his hand. 

                                  BLANE
                    Can you get a grip, it s just a

      BLANE rolls his eyes. They continue searching. DAISY now 
      spots a large portrait of an ugly man with a beautiful 
      young woman by his side. She peers at her museum guide.

                                  DAISY

      DAISY pulls on some gloves and begins expertly searching a 
      large filing cabinet. BLANE is going through another set of 
      drawers, filled with dusty papers. Back on DAISY.

      BLANE creeps past an array of old medical artefacts before 
      spotting a large display cabinet. He looks stunned at what

                    You fool - they ve stolen 
                    Tilbury! This must be linked to 
                    Project 1914. Someone is on to

                    What do we do? 

    The GRANDMASTER rewinds CCTV footage of the spies escaping.

                                    GRANDMASTER
                    We? This is down to you,

    He feels his throat, already paranoid.

      GESUNDHEIT checks his pulse, pulls a mask over his mouth, 
    and sprays himself with antiseptic. He turns back to the 
      GRANDMASTER, imploringly.

    MS TEMPLEMAN, MR FLATLEY, DAISY, BLANE, N/STHEODORE 
      TILBURY

    MR FLATLEY is helped into a seat by MS TEMPLEMAN. As we pan 
      across, we reveal he s sitting next to the icy body of 
      TILBURY, an empty mug in front of him. MS TEMPLEMAN picks 
    up the mug. 

                                  MS TEMPLEMAN
                    May I?

      TILBURY makes no reply. MS TEMPLEMAN turns and whispers to 
    MR FLATLEY. 

                                  MS TEMPLEMAN
                    The supply teacher doesn t look 
                    too well either. I ll make him a 
                    cuppa, might pull him round.

      DAISY and BLANE watch nervously from their hiding place 
      behind a table. As MS TEMPLEMAN fusses over the tea and 
      FLATLEY dozes, BLANE and DAISY comically manage to 
      manhandle TILBURY out of the staffroom unseen. MS TEMPLEMAN 
      turns to the chair where TILBURY was sitting.

                    What a nightmare! Twenty quid in

      ROSE stares at the body in shock.  

                                  DAISY
                    Tilbury s files were missing.

                    He thought that. I think it s 
                    crazy. 

      ROSE peers over the frozen body. She taps at it. Rock hard.

                    Inner Reality maps the mind like

                    Finding the vaccine should be

      GESUNDHEIT makes a call on his mobile. We intercut with the 
      GRANDMASTER. 

                                  GESUNDHEIT
                    Please let me come back! It s 
                    terrible here... everyone is 
                    sick. And they don t put their 
                    hands over their mouths.

                                    GRANDMASTER
                    Our plan has almost succeeded...

    The GRANDMASTER s barometer shows 98% now have flu. A chart 
      marked  Company Profits  shows profits off the scale.

                                    GRANDMASTER
                    But if you return without Tilbury 
                    then the doors here will remain 
                    locked. You ll be out there - 
                    forever!

                                  GESUNDHEIT
                    No! Please, not that-

    The GRANDMASTER puts down the phone. Back on GESUNDHEIT 
      clearly shaken. LENNY appears at the end of the same 
      corridor, and seeing a stranger, takes cover. He watches 
      suspiciously. MS TEMPLEMAN emerges from the classroom and 
      approaches GESUNDHEIT.

                                  MS TEMPLEMAN
                    I ve handed out the assessment 
                    papers. 

      GESUNDHEIT is dragged back into class by MS TEMPLEMAN. 
      LENNY is reassured and hurries on towards the school 
      kitchen.

      BLANE tries to cool TILBURY s body with a electric fan but 
    the water still drips.

      attaches the Inner Reality gear to himself. DAISY s screen 
      shows a photo of Ailsa and Tilbury.

      Toilet rolls and used tissues litter the class. ZARA, 
      STEWART and FIFTY PENCE hug hot-water bottles and cough and 
      sneeze beneath blankets. FIFTY PENCE has pieces of toilet 
      roll up his nostrils. GESUNDHEIT looks longingly towards 
    the door as MS TEMPLEMAN hands him a pile of test papers.

                    Yes, top marks all round. If I 
                    was sick, I d come here. 

    MS TEMPLEMAN looks thrilled and holds out her hand to 
      shake, but GESUNDHEIT has already exited from the 
      classroom. Once outside, he leans against the wall, sprays 
    his throat and then his whole body. Suddenly he notices 
      something on the floor: a trail of frozen peas. He looks at 
      them intrigued, then excitedly follows the trail.

      BLANE and ROSE run through them.

      ROSE are so puzzled they don t move until they hear the

      DAISY looks at the heart monitor as a failing LENNY packs 
      bags of frozen peas around TILBURY s body. Both graphs are 
      going crazy. DAISY picks up the last set of Inner Reality 
      connectors. 

                                  DAISY
                    I know why they re in trouble. 

      Behind LENNY, we see the lift indicator showing someone on 
      their way down to the HQ, but he s too preoccupied to 
      notice. DAISY cues up the photo archive showing a big close 
    up of Tilbury.

                                  DAISY (CONT D)
                    The First World War began the day 
                    Tilbury s vaccine was 
                    distributed. He never got the 
                    credit he deserved which left 
                    him... pretty twisted.

      DAISY begins hooking herself up to TILBURY.

                                  LENNY
                    You re not going in?! Why risk 
                    it? Better to get Rose and Blane

                     Cos though Tilbury will never 
                    give us the vaccine, there s 
                    someone in there who might help. 

    The archive shows a photo of Ailsa, preparing medicine in a 
      test-tube. DAISY lies down next to TILBURY, BLANE and ROSE 
    but then sits up again, angry with herself for being 
      afraid.

                                  LENNY
                    That s the last set of 
                      connectors. I can t follow you 
                    in... no-one can!

                    Come on Daisy, mind over

    She closes her eyes and goes in. At that exact moment, the 
      lift doors open to reveal GESUNDHEIT! GESUNDHEIT spots 
      TILBURY alongside the prone bodies of the TEAM. LENNY turns 
    and confronts the intruder as he approaches TILBURY s body.        The Inside Job - Episode 6 - Shooting Script - 30.07.07(50)

                    together we ll make a fortune in 
                    flu remedies.

                                  LENNY
                    Over my dead body!  

      GESUNDHEIT makes a desperate lunge, which LENNY blocks. 
      GESUNDHEIT tries again, the bags of peas split open and 
      GESUNDHEIT slips on them. He makes another grab and LENNY 
      resists by throwing a bag of peas at him. GESUNDHEIT 
      retaliates by using TILBURY s limp arm to slap LENNY, who 
    is knocked to the ground. We think it s a knock out blow, 
    but LENNY gamely re-appears. His flu is getting worse. 
      Sweat pours off him, and he doesn t look strong enough to 
      resist.

                                  MS TEMPLEMAN
                    It s Four O clock... you re 
                    officially the healthiest teacher 
                    in the history of StHope s!

    MR FLATLEY feebly punches the air in triumph. 

                                  MS TEMPLEMAN
                    And we ve passed the First Aid 
                      Assessment. We can all go home! 

    The tattered remnants of the PUPILS cheer with hoarse 
      voices and then collapse in coughing and sneezing fits. MR 
      FLATLEY passes out. MS TEMPLEMAN taps his cheeks.

                                  MS TEMPLEMAN
                    Kenneth! Kenneth!

    No response. MS TEMPLEMAN slaps him much harder. 

                                  MR FLATLEY
                    Ow!

      Just as MS TEMPLEMAN is leaving, her mobile rings. 

                                    O GRADY(V.O.)
                    Mr O Grady.Sorry I couldn t make 
                    the first-aid test today, touch 
                    of that flu that s going round. I 
                    hope you got my message? 

    MS TEMPLEMAN looks shocked, then mischievously, she checks 
      no-one is looking and switches off her mobile phone.

      LENNY, GESUNDHEIT, N/STHEODORE TILBURY, BLANE, DAISY, ROSE

    As LENNY and GESUNDHEIT fight over TILBURY and around the 
      SPIES, the leads are stretched to their limit. 

                                  LENNY
                    Must... hold on... 

      LENNY gives a last half sneeze at GESUNDHEIT, who recoils 
      again. This time GESUNDHEIT feels the first droplet on the 
    end of his nose. 

                                  GESUNDHEIT
                    No!!! Not a dripping nose! It 
                    can t be... I have taken every 
                      precaution.

    He feels his forehead.

                                  GESUNDHEIT
                    34.2. I m burning up! Nooooooo!

      GESUNDHEIT sneezes. The bug is taking hold. He collapses in 
      a sobbing heap.

      LENNY, DAISY, ROSE, BLANE, GESUNDHEIT, N/STHEODORE TILBURY

      LENNY hurries to the tables. The SPIES  eyelids flicker and 
      their bodies twitch in an exaggerated manner. As LENNY 
      watches their pulse rates, the SPIES begin to come around.  

                                  LENNY
                    Are you OK?

                                  ROSE
                    I ve got a sixty-eight digit

                    call the Government Super-Flu 
                    Unit. Fast!

      LENNY hands her a phone and ROSE makes the call. 

                                  ROSE
                    Chief Medical Officer? Excellent, 
                    Rose Guptahere...

      BLANE spots GESUNDHEIT sobbing on the ground.

                                  BLANE
                    Who s the cry-baby?

                                  LENNY
                    He s a SKULagent. 

                                  GESUNDHEIT
                    Colds go straight to my chest. 
                    Why did he make me come here?! 

                                  LENNY
                    It was the Grandmaster s very own 
                    Cold War. A squad is on its way 
                    to arrest him.

      ROSE ends her call and joins the rest of the TEAM. She 
      looks across at TILBURY s body, now frozen again. 

                                  ROSE
                    I m going to make sure Tilbury 
                    and Ailsa get the praise they 
                    deserved. 

                                  BLANE
                    Deserve a bit of praise yourself. 
                    Inner Reality is totally amazing.

                                  ROSE
                    No, I m going to rework it. Daisy 
                    was right. The brain isn t only
                    about facts and data.        The Inside Job - Episode 6 - Shooting Script - 30.07.07(61)

    The TEAM laugh. GESUNDHEIT sneezes.

      GRANDMASTER, NEWS REPORTER (V.O.), FLOPSY

    The GRANDMASTER is rugged-up, clutching a hotwaterbottle 
    and dabbing his nose with a silk hankie. FLOPSYis 
      alongside. 

                                    GRANDMASTER
                    We escaped just in time, General. 
                    And all we came away with is 
                    Gesundheit s flu.

    He dabs his nose and gives an effete groan. FLOPSYis 
      watching breaking news on a micro-TV. We see images of 
      people being vaccinated.

                                  NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
                    And the new vaccine is being 
                      distributed nationally...

    The giant infectometernow shows flu levels at zero. He 
      switches off the television in irritation.

                                  GRAND MASTER
                    How I hate to see happy healthy 
                    people. We should never have 
                    trusted that useless germaphobe!

    He takes a thermometer from FLOPSYthen looks with concern.

                                    GRANDMASTER
                    I don t like the look of that 
                    moist nose. And your eyes are a 
                    little pink too. I do hope I m 
                    not going to have a hot-cross 
                    bunny on my hands!
