           January 22, 2009          Let s enjoy these aimless days while we can, I told 
          myself, fearing some kind of deft acceleration into 
          American magic and dread...  

                                  -- Don DeLillo,  WHITE NOISE 






           There s a darkness on the edge of town...  

                                  -- Bruce Springsteen                        ACT ONE


      EXT.  SETON WOODS - HAPLIN, MINNESOTA - NIGHT

    A dense, mossy-floored FOREST of pine, aspen, birch and 
      tamarack.  Vaguely-limned by a heavily-bruised moon, dimmed 
    by angry clouds approaching from the southern sky...

    WE GLIDE through this thick undergrowth, lashed by the wind 
    and spit-on by a light rain, and WE HEAR:

                                  GIRL S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Maybe one of these days, you ll 
                    actually be able to drop me off in 
                    front of my house -- 

      The response is male.  And muffled.  The sound of A CAR DOOR 
      OPENING... Just as WE CREST a line of black fir trees on a 
      hill brow.... To ARRIVE AT the mint  69 CUTLASS 442, 
          splendidly-restored, parked on this promontory overlooking --

      MAC S POND

      which is technically more of a lake, in that it covers some 
      six square miles, most of which are now FROZEN-OVER.  This is 
    a popular make-out spot for the local high-schoolers...

      Indeed.  A GIRL emerges from the passenger side of the 
      Cutlass.  Her name is GEORGIA BRAVIN, 17.  And, as she gets 
      her bits together (coat, scarf, hat), after a heated session, 
      we can see she is very pretty, almost in spite of herself.

      She leans down to the passenger-side window... 

                                    GEORGIA
                    Late --

      And she walks off.  Straight into the pitch of the woods...

      EXT.  SETON WOODS - NIGHT

      Georgia hews to the path that wends its way along the banks 
      of Mac's Pond.  It is quiet, but for the distant rumble of 
      thunderheads, as she picks her way along the scrim of frost-
      rimed rock and dirt and branch...

      When she hears what sounds like A SCREAM.  Coming from the 
      pond.  Coming from the middle of the pond...

      Georgia squints.  She can barely make-out, in the occluded 
      moonlight, the SMALL FRAME SHACK in the center of the pond...                                                                                      2.


    It is an ICE FISHING HUT.  And, oddly enough, there appears 
    to be a LIGHT on inside of it...

      Georgia frowns.  As another CRY splits the night.  Yes, that 
      was definitely a human cry... 

      Georgia debates whether or not to investigate.  All around 
      her, dead branches rustle dryly, like dead men s bones...  

    In a birch snag, an OWL HOOTS, as they so often do in these 
      instances, startling her... Georgia looks up at the treetops:

                                  GEORGIA
                    Are you kidding me, dude?

    Her eyes tick back to the ice shack.  And she makes a 
      decision.  She steps out onto the pond s frozen surface... 
    And begins to walk toward the ice shack, some 20 yards away.

      When suddenly it begins to POUR.  Coming down in thick, 
      sideways sheets... 

    So Georgia gives up the sleuthing.  And beats a hasty retreat 
    the way she came...

    We, however, remain at the shoreline.  Staring directly at 
    the ice shack.  As a SHADOW moves across the lone window.  

    And we HARD CUT TO:

    A KNOBBY FINGER PRESSING PLAY ON AN OLD-SCHOOL BOOM BOX.

    As the crunchy aggro riff of Megadeth s metal classic, 
       Symphony Of Destruction  begins --

      INT.  ICE SHACK - MAC'S POND - NIGHT

      Echoing through the interior of the ice shack, which is like 
    an outhouse on runners, covered with wall board... A single, 
      gas-fueled LANTERN provides a milky, cataract illumination --

    -- of the abject chaos at work here.  As a MAN - skinny and 
      blonde and a little strange-looking - is being tossed about 
    the ice shack as if he were made of mere gauze... This is 
      JERRY FRIDDLE, mid-40s.  

      Friddle is punched.  Kicked.  Hurled into the walls of the 
      shack.  By an unseen presence.  But whoever this unseen 
      presence is... This unseen presence is furious...

    The music CRANKS.  Friddle is thrown into a minnow bucket 
      full of shiners... The small, silvery fish splatter across 
    the floor, across Friddle s threadbare turtleneck sweater...                                                                                      3.


      This should all be very elliptical... Frenetic jump-cuts... 
      Friddle s head is thrust into the fish-hole hacked into the 
      pack ice... And dunked into its frigid maw... 

      Only to be ripped out again... Sputtering gelid pond water 
      from his mouth... 

                                  JERRY FRIDDLE
                    I don t know what you re talking 
                    about, man!  I don t... !!! 

      Friddle is slammed into a hardback chair.  Hands bound behind 
    him with electrical tape... As Dave Mustaine s nihilistic 
      fretwork provides a discordant soundtrack to the bedlam...

                                  JERRY FRIDDLE
                    You got the wrong man, is what--

    A FLASH OF SILVER.  And there is a HANDGUN pressed to 
      Friddle s face.  A large frame revolver, like a .45 ACP.  
      Long, gleaming bore glinting in the lantern light...

      Friddle sobs.. Despite the chill, his forehead is cleated 
      with sweat, eyes wild with fear... He weighs his options... 

                                  JERRY FRIDDLE
                    Okay, okay.  I ll tell you... !

    His attacker leans in... We only get a glimpse of the back of 
    a male head... As it lowers to Friddle s mouth... 

                                  JERRY FRIDDLE
                    How  bout you don t point the gun 
                    at me no more?

    His attacker lowers the enormous sidearm.  Friddle whispers 
      into the man s ear... His words obscured to us, beneath the 
      music, the rain, the thunder, the hissing lantern.

      And whatever Friddle has said... It hasn t placated the 
      man... Not at all... The man goes to a corner of the shack... 

                                  JERRY FRIDDLE
                    Okay?  We good?  Figure you let me 
                    go?  Let the proper authorities do 
                    what they need to me?  Court, jail, 
                    what have you -- ?

      His attacker turns... And he holds something up to the 
      lantern-light:  A RAILROAD SPIKE.

      And in his other hand, is a HAMMER...                                                                                       4.


                                  JERRY FRIDDLE
                    Now, what the hell is--

    The tip of the spike is pressed to Friddle s forehead... 

                                  JERRY FRIDDLE
                    Guy, I told ya what you needed to 
                    know!  I --

    And the hammer is raised back... 

                                  JERRY FRIDDLE
                    -- TOLD YA WHAT YOU NEEDED TO KNOW!

    And Dave Mustaine growls ( just like the Pied Piper/led rats 
      through the streets/we dance like marionettes/ swaying to the 
      symphony...  )...

    The hammer begins its downward arc, toward the head of the 
      spike... And, as they connect, and Friddle SCREAMS --     
      ( ... of destruction...  ) 

    We SLAM TO BLACK.  Over which, in all its ironic splendor, 
    our TITLE CARD appears:  

       HAPPY TOWN 

      FADE IN:

      EXT.  TRAIN STATION - HAPLIN, MINNESOTA - DAY

    An old-school depot on the outskirts of town.  A bright, 
      sunny day.  The storm has passed.  Leaving us with a March 
      morning, as crisp and clear as a flute of flat champagne...

    The flashing SIGNAL GANTRY heralds the arrival of the TRAIN - 
    a rambling, eleven-car affair.  A few COMMUTERS get on.  
      Heading to the Twin Cities.

      Only one person emerges.  A GIRL, early 20s.  Her look is 
          lonely-little-rag-doll meets early 90s Seattle Grunge.  She 
      carries a duffel bag and a guitar case.  This is HENLEY. *

    The train is quick to leave the station. And Henley is the 
      only one left.  She stands there.  Unsure as to her next 
      move.  When --

    A MINI-VAN pulls up.  A spry little blonde, early 30s - all 
      chirpy good cheer and blonde side-swept bangs - at the wheel.  
      This is MIRANDA KIRBY, Real-Estate-Agent-cum-Welcome-Wagon-
          Envoy-cum-Former-Pep-Rally-General...

      Miranda bounds from the van like a perfumed labrador.                                                                                      5.


                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    It s Henley, isn t it?   I m 
                    Miranda Kirby!  How fun!  Welcome 
                    to Haplin!  You are going to 
                    looooove it here!

      And, yes, Miranda Kirby speaks in staccato bursts of joy that 
      must have exclamation points affixed to them...

      Miranda grabs Henley s duffel... Her words a non-stop gout, 
      with what appears to be no pause for breathe:

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY
                    Do you play the guitar?  I always 
                    wanted to play!  Took lessons when 
                    I was nine.  But I didn t like my 
                    teacher.  He smelled.  So I asked 
                    my parents if I could quit.  And 
                    they let me!  

      Miranda tosses the duffel in the back of the van... 

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    I have half a mind to sue them now!  
                    Can you imagine if they hadn t let 
                    me quit?  I d be flippin  Eric 
                    Clapton today!  My Jordan (she s 
                    eight!), is going to start taking 
                    lessons this summer.  And if she 
                    wants to quit?  Sorry, customer!  
                      No-can-doofus!

    As Miranda goes around to the driver s side... Henley smiles 
      slightly at this shiny, happy person and WE CUT TO:

      EXT.  CONROY HOUSE - TO ESTABLISH - DAY

    A robust craftsman on a lovely cedar-lined street.  A 28-foot 
      performance FISHING BOAT - with a forward-casting platform 
      deck and  Dallas Alice  painted on its transom in cursive 
      curves - sits on a trailer in the driveway...

      Next to it, is parked an SUV and a Welly Crown Victoria, with 
    the words  Haplin County Sheriff  stencilled on the sides...

      INT.  CONROY HOUSE - DAY

      Where 7-year-old EMMA CONROY is moving her egg whites around 
    her plate, a look of supreme distaste on her precious face.

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    Where s all the yellow?                                                                                      6.


    Her mother, RACHEL CONROY, 27 - deep-dimpled, dishwater 
      blonde hair, fierce but fair - is at the sink, making a 
      cheese sandwich for Emma s lunch...

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    Those are egg whites.  No yoke.

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    Why?

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    Why what?

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    Why no yoke?

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    It s healthier --

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    The yoke is bad?

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                      Eventually.

      Emma frowns... But then an atonal SINGING approaches... 

                                  TOMMY (O.S.)
                          (singing)
                     As the son of a son of a sailor/I 
                    went out on the sea for 
                    adventure...  

    And in walks TOMMY CONROY, 32.  Raw-boned and handsome, Tommy 
    is jocular, relaxed, entirely comfortable in his own skin, as 
    a lifetime of having things go your way is bound to engender.

                                  TOMMY (SINGING)
                     Expanding their view of the 
                    captain and crew/Like a man just 
                    released from indenture...  *

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    Your father is getting his Jimmy 
                    Buffet on, Emm.  That can only mean 
                    one thing --

                                  TOMMY
                    Yes, indeedy.  The  Dallas Alice  
                    goes back in the water today!

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    It gets earlier and earlier every 
                    year...                                                                                      7.


                                  TOMMY
                    Not true.  The week of the  Thaw 
                    Fest  is always when we put her 
                    back in...

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    It s going to be a chilly  Thaw 
                    Fest  this year... It doesn t seem 
                    like it s warming up any time soon.

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    Daddy, look.  No yellow...

      Tommy feigns concern...

                                  TOMMY
                    The yoke s on you, Emma C.

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    It is ironic.  Here I am making her 
                    egg whites for breakfast... But an 
                    American cheese sandwich for lunch.

      Tommy comes up behind her, nuzzles her neck...

                                  TOMMY
                    You can only protect them one meal 
                    at a time...

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    You look at these brochures?

    She gestures... To a thin stack of BROCHURES - Chamber of 
      Commerce-type pamphlets extolling the virtues of sun-splashed 
    La Jolla, San Diego, Newport Beach, etc.

                                  TOMMY
                    I did not.  Emma C.  Mommy wants to 
                    leave Haplin and move to 
                      California.  What say you?

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    I say  no .

                                  TOMMY
                    How come?

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    They have earthcakes there...

                                  TOMMY
                    Yep.  They do.  And here we are.  
                    In the cradle of the heartland.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      8.

                                  TOMMY (cont'd)
                    Daddy s the son of the Sheriff in a 
                    town with no crime.   Mommy s got 
                    an important job at the bread 
                    factory.  Daughter Emma is the 
                    brightest bulb in her 1st grade 
                    class.  Mommy and Daddy still sneak 
                    off to smoochy-smooch, despite the 
                    fact they ve been together since 
                    prom.  The livin  is easy.  Fish 
                    are jumpin .  And the cotton is 
                    high.  Why, Emma C, would we trade 
                    any of that, to go to a place full 
                    of... Earthcakes?  Why?  

      Rachel shakes her head with a smile...

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    We wouldn t.

                                  TOMMY
                    Tell her, Emma C.  Tell Mommy of 
                    the glories of Haplin --

    And we ll use this as our logical transition to --

      EXT.  HAPLIN - VARIOUS / INT.  MIRANDA KIRBY S MINI-VAN - DAY

    As they pass the sign ( WELCOME TO HAPLIN:  WHERE THE BREAD *
      ALSO RISES ) Miranda Kirby gives Henley the quickie tour of 
      this small (population, 9,000), lake-spangled berg, some 40 
      miles from Minneapolis, clenched between empurpled, 
      stratified cliffs and majestic strands of Norway pine 
      forests...*

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY
                    This area was first occupied by the 
                    Sisseton Indians.  One of the seven 
                    original tribes of the Dakota... 

      We should be struck by the splendor here:  the Victorian  *
      houses and family farms;  the latticework of canoe trails and 
      tawny oceans of wheat.  Pheasants fly to the shelter of an  *
      alfalfa field;  above abandoned copper mines, adits grown- *
      over with bluegrass, decades after the ore went dry...

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY
                    The first white man to set foot 
                    here, was Wilmont Haplin, who came 
                    to map out the area in 1846... 

      They pass the entrance to an enormous GATED MANSE.  It s one 
      of those houses with a name:   WEEPING WALL ...                                                                                      9.


                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    Wilmont Haplin is the great, great, 
                    great grandfather of John Haplin, 
                    whose mother, Mrs. Peggy Haplin 
                    lives there.  She s The Grand Dame. 
                    Pretty much runs this whole show! 

      Henley notices a strange BIT OF GRAFFITI spray-painted on the 
      side of a building:  it is A QUESTION MARK WITH A HALO OVER 
      IT... But before she can comment, they have driven into --

      DOWNTOWN, HAPLIN*

    A bucolic sprawl of 19th century wood and brick structures,  *
      with more modern buildings interspersed: the St. Paul Church, 
      with its patron saints carved in stone and set in apsidal 
      chapels.  The Sheriff s Station.  The shops and saloons.  The  *
      boardwalk, imprinted with the area s ranch brands... *

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY
                    So why have you chosen Haplin, hon?   *
                    Aside from wanting to display 
                      impeccable geographic taste!

                                  HENLEY
                    My mother vacationed here.  As a 
                    child.  She recently passed away.   *
                    But she always spoke so fondly of 
                    this place... 

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY
                    What do you plan to do?*

                                    HENLEY*
                    Maybe open a candle shop.  With my  *
                      inheritance?  What do you think?  *

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY*
                    That s amazing!  I adore candles!   *
                      Especially scented ones!  *

                                    HENLEY*
                    Then you ll love my  Strawberry *
                    Fields Glow-ever  candle.  I use  *
                    sweet sun-ripened strawberries in  *
                    the wax and hand-grubby the top with  *
                    banana slice wicks.  The aroma! *

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY*
                    Put me down for five!  And when  *
                    you re ready to look at retail  *
                    space, I m your girl -- !*

      Henley sniffs the air... She has noticed it since she here:                                                                                    10.


                                  HENLEY
                    Speaking of aroma.  Everything  *
                    smells so good here --*

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    Of course it does, sweetie.  Look --

      Miranda gestures to the FACTORY, up on the hill, presiding 
      over all, smokestacks billowing smudgy fingers of industrial 
      cumulus across the otherwise perfectly blue sky... 

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    That s the bread factory.   Our 
                    Daily  Baking And Confectionery.  
                    The locals call it  The Bready .  
                    And, in this day and age, with 
                    factories closing down all over the 
                    country, not only does that 
                    wonderful place employ 12 percent 
                    of Haplin s residents, but it also 
                    makes Haplin a place where the air 
                    is alive, not with uncertainty, but 
                    with the aroma of baking bread, all 
                    the live-long day!

    As the mini-van motors down Main Street, we recognize this  *
      place for what it is:  a glimpse of another era, frozen in an  *
      amber untouched by the voracious predation of Starbucks and  *
      Wal-Mart and Blockbuster...*

    But on a railroad trestle, Henley once again clocks the  *
      GRAFFITI OF THE QUESTION MARK WITH THE HALO OVER IT... *

      Miranda follows Henley s look.  Sees the question mark.  She  *
      grimaces.  But it is only fleeting, as her chirp returns: *

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY*
                    Welcome to Haplin.  Or, as some  *
                    folks like to call it:   Happy *
                    Town .  Because they know, Henley.   *

      Henley looks at Miranda and her rictus grin, which is almost  *
    as unsettling as whatever it hopes to conceal;  like the  *
      disinfectant used in hospitals to cover the smells of decay. *

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY*
                    They know.*

    OFF OF Henley.  As they drive beneath the railroad trestle.   *
    As she clocks that mysterious question mark, it is apparent  *
      that cryptic glyph has great meaning for her... *

                       END OF ACT ONE*                                                                                    11.


                          ACT TWO*

      EXT.  CONROY HOUSE - DAY*

      Tommy and Emma are eyeballing the  Dallas Alice , in 
      preparation for taking it out of dry-dock...

                                  TOMMY
                    What do you think?

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    I think it s too cold.

                                  TOMMY
                    You see that s where you re wrong.  
                    It s all about visualization.  
                    Yeah, it s too cold.  But if you 
                    think on it.  Wish on it.  
                    Visualize the  Dallas Alice  on 
                    Lake Spirit.  Are you seeing it?

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    Nope...

                                  TOMMY
                    Are you seeing my string?  With the 
                    glittering array of trout and 
                    sauger and walleye dangling from 
                    it?

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    Nope.

                                  TOMMY
                    Are you visualizing anything?

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    Grilled cheese.

    He looks at her.  But then he clocks Georgia Bravin  - the 
      girl from our opening - ambling up the walk, with her 
      backpack... Emma doesn t see her...

                                  TOMMY
                    Okay, I ll prove that it works.  
                    Right now, I am visualizing your 
                    baby-sitter, Georgia, who has come 
                    to walk you to school... And, oh, 
                    hey, look -- !

      Emma does, sees Georgia... Shakes her head...

                                  GEORGIA
                    What are you guys doing?                                                                                    12.


                                  EMMA CONROY
                    Daddy is being dumb.

                                  GEORGIA
                    Daddy s do that...

    She helps Emma put her knapsack on.  To Tommy:

                                  GEORGIA
                    You really putting her in the water 
                    today?

                                  TOMMY
                    Yep.

                                  GEORGIA
                    Pond is still frozen-over.  I was 
                    by there last night...

                                  TOMMY
                    Pond isn t the lake.  And what were 
                    you doing by the pond last night?

    He looks at her, vaguely suspicious... But before she can 
      answer, another Haplin County Sheriff Welly Crown Vic pulls 
      up... Georgia smiles for:

                                  GEORGIA
                    Saved by the belly.

    And out steps SHERIFF GRIFFIN CONROY, early 60s.  Sheriff 
      Conroy has managed to retain the giddy ebullience that s 
      usually beaten out of men from these parts, when they get to 
    be this age.  And, yes, he s got an impressive gut.  Although 
    it looks to be made of poured concrete...

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    Grampa -- !

    And she goes and wraps her little arms around his legs...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Hey, Li l Bean --

    He pats her head... Nods to Georgia...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    How s your father, Georgia?

                                  GEORGIA
                    Sleeping one off...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Ain t that much sleep in creation.                                                                                    13.


                                  GEORGIA
                    Truth.

      Sheriff Conroy turns to Tommy...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    We got a situation at the square.  
                    Wanna ride along?

                                  TOMMY
                    Not really.  It s my day-off.  
                    Gonna put the  Dallas Alice  in the 
                    water...

      Sheriff Conroy appraises the boat.  Named for his late wife.

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Too damn early in the season to put 
                    her in the water...

                                  TOMMY
                    What, was there some meeting this 
                    morning, where you all got together 
                    to talk about the weather?

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Let s go...

                                  TOMMY
                    Lemme put on my khakis...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Your fine like you are.  We ll see 
                    ya later, Li l Bean?  Georgia.

                                  GEORGIA
                    So long, Sheriff --

      Tommy kisses Emma...

                                  TOMMY
                    Tell Mommy I had to leave.   Cause 
                    my Daddy is meaner than your Daddy.

      EXT.  DOWNTOWN, HAPLIN - DAY

      Henley and Miranda are on foot now... Walking along the 
      bustling Main Street...

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY
                    Are you hungry, Henley?

                                  HENLEY
                    I could eat.                                                                                    14.


    As they go, they pass a SMALL POSTER affixed to a TELEPHONE 
      POLE.  It has the PHOTOGRAPHS OF FIVE CHILDREN, between the 
      ages of 9 and 11, on it, beneath the SYMBOL Henley spied 
      earlier:  the question mark with the halo...

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    I know just the place.

    As they walk, Miranda snatches the poster off the telephone 
      pole.  Balls it up.  And tosses it into a trash can...

      EXT.  BIG DAVE S PIZZA BARN - DOWNTOWN, HAPLIN - DAY

    The words:   The Home Of The Monster!  are painted in spooky, 
      horror-movie-style scrawl, on the plate glass window...  *

      INT.  BIG DAVE S PIZZA BARN - DOWNTOWN, HAPLIN - DAY

      Where they not only know your name, they know the name of 
      your dog;  and the name of the sawbones that removed that 
      funny-colored mole from your hide... It s a big, barn-style 
      space... Tables and counter space and a large pizza oven... 

      Presided over by the gentle giant known as BIG DAVE DUNCAN, 
    30.  The burly, affable proprietor we will also come to know 
    as one of Tommy Conroy s best friends... Big Dave is talking 
    to ANOTHER DEPUTY, in his khakis.  This is LARRY  ROOT BEER  
      ROGERS, 28, pale and asthenic.  A worrier.  But a clever one.

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    Technically, it s not a  date .  I 
                    never framed it as a  date ...

                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    The minute you ask a girl out, Big 
                    Dave, it s a date...

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    I only asked her out for omelettes.  

                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    White wine and omelettes.

      Root Beer turns to the kid, 17, sitting alone at the counter, 
      eating a sandwich and reading a magazine.  ANDREW HAPLIN.  
      Handsome and sullen and silver-spooned...

                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    Andrew?  You re a lothario.  Talk 
                    to the man...

      Andrew just looks at the two men... We can see it in his 
      eyes:   leave me alone, you Laurel and Hardy motherfuckers!                                                                                      15.


      Miranda and Henley enter... 

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                     The Monster  is the only 26-inch 
                    pizza maybe in the country!  

      Miranda gestures to the stack of enormous pizza boxes piled-
    up beside the regular-sized ones behind the counter...

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    Big Dave has special boxes made.  
                    And since good pizza is all about 
                    the dough - and since New York 
                    pizza is the best - Big Dave has 
                    the water flown in especially from 
                    Manhattan. And mixed-in.  And this 
                    is Big Dave!  This is Henley.  New 
                    to town.  Henley, this is Big Dave.  
                    And Larry Rogers.  They call him 
                     Root Beer !  

      Root Beer shrugs, slightly abashed...

                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    Small towns.  Everyone gets a nick-
                    name...

                                  HENLEY
                    Nice to meet you...

    She follows Miranda.  Big Dave and Root Beer exchange a look. 

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    You thinkin  what I m thinkin ?

                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    White wine and omelettes...

    His CELL-PHONE RINGS... He answers it... Listens... Hangs up

                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    Gotta go.  Trouble in the square. *
                    Banner trouble.  

    And he exits, as we CUT TO:

    A BANNER, 

      twelve feet long, four feet high.  With the FACES OF FIVE 
      CHILDREN - two boys, and three girls - on it from the poster 
      Miranda Kirby tore off the phone pole.  With the words:  
       Remember To Never Forget  written below it, book-ended by 
      those curious question-marks-with-halos..                                                                                    16.


      EXT.  HAPLIN TOWN SQUARE - DAY

    An expansive plaza of grass and wrought-iron fence and old-
      timey gas lamps.  The square covers the equivalent of a city 
      block, and is now being readied for the  Thaw Fest :  

      Vendor booths are set-up, to sell food, arts and crafts, face-
      painting, etc.  And there are carnival-style games.  Bleacher- 
      seats and a band-riser are being erected...

    But right now there is something of a brouhaha brewing.  A 
      barrel-chested BLACK MAN, 46 - in  OUR DAILY  coveralls - is 
      regaling a GROUP OF WHITE MEN.  This is CARL DANCO.  And he 
      is enraged.  With him is a black woman, 40s, ZURI SORRELL.

                                  CARL DANCO
                    And I m saying this ain t close to 
                    right!  We been excluded for 14 
                    damn years!  And it stops now.  It 
                    stops here!

      The target of Danco s rage is JOHN HAPLIN, 38, and pretty 
      much the closest Haplin has to a Favorite Son...  With him is 
      PERRY STECKLER, 41... A large, angry, meat-faced fellow... *

                                  CARL DANCO
                    It s a damn glaring omission, ya  *
                    hear me?  This woman s son not 
                    being included!  A damn glaring  *
                    omission -- ! *

                                  PERRY STECKLER
                    Step back, Danco --

                                  CARL DANCO
                    You put that boy s picture on that 
                    banner... Or I swear to God, I will 
                    get the Reverend Sharpton down 
                    here, with a bunch of TV cameras, 
                    and we ll do a number on the steps 
                    of your bread factory - your white 
                    bread factory - have the whole damn 
                    state in tears... !

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    You keep trying to make this into a 
                    racial issue, Carl.  And I keep 
                    telling you it s a question of 
                    geography:  little Chad Sorrell was 
                    from Cook s Ridge.  Which is not 
                    Haplin proper.  Which is the only 
                    reason he is not included on the 
                    banner.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    17.

                                  JOHN HAPLIN (cont'd)
                    What all these kids have in common 
                    is that they are Haplin kids...

                                  CARL DANCO
                    What all these kids have in common 
                    is that they were taken by The 
                    Magic Man --

      And there is stunned silence from the crowd.  As if he has 
      said some kind of incantation that should never be uttered.

                                  PERRY STECKLER
                    You sonuvabitch -- !

      And he charges at Carl Danco... John Haplin and some of the 
      other men intervene... Just as Root Beer Rogers has arrived, 
      running up to the fracas, to separate the men...

                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    Settle down now, people.  

      But they don t... Danco goes for Haplin, Steckler goes for 
      Danco... Zuri Sorrell weeps... There is shouting and swearing 
      and considerable hue and cry... And then there is a WHISTLE.  
      An old-school wolf whistle... 

      All eyes turn... To where Sheriff Conroy and Tommy amble from 
      their Welly... Sheriff Conroy, walks with authority, hands 
      placed on either side of his belt, in proper  command 
      presence  posture.  He s as cool as a cobra.  To John Haplin:

                                    SHERIFF CONROY
                    Thought we agreed this wasn t to be 
                    hoisted, John -- ?

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    We agreed to nothing of the kind...

                                    SHERIFF CONROY
                    Sure we did.  We sat there.  At 
                    that City Council meeting.  And the 
                    talk was of healing.  Of not 
                    dwelling in the past.  And we 
                    agreed, then and there, this wasn t 
                    to be hoisted...

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    Which, I would imagine, is easy to 
                    do, when your own flesh and blood 
                    isn t pictured on it...

      More shouting... Sheriff Conroy studies the banner for a 
      beat... He looks at Tommy... Tommy, with his hands in his 
      back pockets... Sheriff Conroy shakes his head.                                                                                    18.


                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    As long as they remain missing, 
                    there is still hope, Sheriff...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    No doubt.  I m not trying to be 
                    insensitive, John.  Perry...  

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    Maybe you d like to discuss this 
                    with my mother...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Maybe I would...

    And Carl Danco rushes Steckler, swinging out wildly with a 
      fist like a lunchbox... Except that Tommy is in the middle... 
      Danco accidentally connects with Tommy s eye-socket... Tommy 
      goes down... Sheriff Conroy bellows:

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    THAT.  IS.  ENOUGH!

    And everyone settles down... 

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Get up, son --

    And Tommy s eye looks like it s going to develop a healthy 
      shiner... Sheriff Conroy looks mildly disgusted... But then 
      Root Beer Rogers approaches Sheriff Conroy, radio in hand... 

                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    Hobbs got something, sir.  Out to 
                    Mac s Pond... 

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    The banner goes away.  The  Thaw 
                    Fest  is about corn dogs and 
                    carousels.  Ain t about darkness.  
                    The banner goes away...
                          (turns to Tommy)
                    Come on then --

      They walk off.  We LINGER ON John Haplin.  He is not pleased. 

      EXT.  MAC S POND - DAY

      Tommy and Sheriff Conroy climb from the Welly, and begin to 
      walk across the ice... As they go:

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    How s the eye?                                                                                    19.


                                  TOMMY
                    Better than it s gonna be in a few 
                    hours...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Your own damn fault --

                                  TOMMY
                    How you figure -- ?

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    We ve had this conversation a 
                    million times.  You don t act like 
                    a cop.  You stand with your hands 
                    in your back pockets.  Instead of 
                    properly  blading   em.  Command 
                    presence. You act like you re 
                    selling ice cream... 

                                  TOMMY
                    You sound like Rachel.  This is 
                    Haplin.  Why make things difficult, 
                    when the world is offering this? *

    And he spreads his arms to include the level white plain of 
    the frozen lake, and the high blue vault of sky overhead... 

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Just know about the inevitability 
                    of the Vis Major...

                                  TOMMY
                    The what?

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    The Vis Major.  It s a Latin term.  
                     A natural and unavoidable 
                      catastrophe that interrupts the 
                    expected course of events.   And
                    every life can expect a visit from 
                    the Vis Major...  

                                  TOMMY
                    Yeah, well, I figure the trick is 
                    to avoid Major Vis.  Or Vis Major.  
                    Or whatever the hell it is.  For as 
                    long as possible...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    That is the trick.  I would tell 
                    that to Chloe, if ever I saw her 
                    again...                                                                                    20.


                                  TOMMY
                    What?  

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    What?

                                  TOMMY
                    Who s Chloe?

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Who?

                                  TOMMY
                    You just said--

    But before the Sheriff can answer, they have neared the ice 
      shack.   Where another Deputy - the large, African-American 
      KELVIN TOLLIVER, 35 - awaits them, near some EMTs... And a 
    few scared, sniffling KIDS... 

                                  KELVIN TOLLIVER
                    These kids were skating... When 
                    they found him...

      From out of the shack, steps the irascible ROGER HOBBS, 53.  
    The Chief Deputy/Investigator, he is the Sheriff s number 2.

                                   ROGER HOBBS
                    You ain t gonna believe this, 
                    Griff...  

      Hobbs holds open the door for them.  Father and son approach.

      INT.  ICE SHACK - DAY

    ... where they see poor old Jerry Friddle.  Still bound to 
    his chair.  Frozen and dead.  A HOLE, an inch and a half in 
      diameter, goes clean through his skull... 

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Know what this is, Tommy?

    And now we are looking at Tommy and the Sheriff.  

      But from the P.O.V. of the back of Friddle s head...

      Actually, through the hole.  As Tommy nods... 

                                  TOMMY
                    Yep.  The Vis Major.



                     END OF ACT TWO*                                                                                    21.


                         ACT THREE*


      EXT.  MANNING BOARDING HOUSE - DAY 

      An enormous three-story, neo-Jacobean pile, up on a hill 
      overlooking town.  The house looks mostly exhausted - 
      crumbling gables, tarnished lead roof, a listing weathervane - 
      although the landscaping is bright and well-tended...

      Henley and Miranda Kirby pull into the circular drive...

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY
                    I really do think you ll be quite 
                      comfortable here... Until we can 
                    find you something more... 
                      Permanent.

      Henley nods.  She eyes the house, a little warily...

      INT.  MANNING BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

      Where we meet its jolly, aproned proprietor, DOT MANNING, 64 - 
      round and soft like an overstuffed easy chair - as she leads 
      them through the house...  Which is cozily furnished - with 
      nary a nod to anything post-1980... 

                                  DOT MANNING
                    I have seven boarders at this time, 
                    Henley... Including you and me...

      Henley notices that Dot has something on her nose:  a small, 
      red splotch... But then we are off to --

      QUICK CUTS - as Dot shows them around:

    - The TV room.  Big frilly couches surround a 32  Zenith... 
      Dot holds up the REMOTE...

                                  DOT MANNING
                    The only rule of the TV room is:  
                    first to arrive gets to drive.

     - The dining room.  A long table, with 10 place settings...

                                  DOT MANNING
                    I just need to know the morning of, 
                    if you ll be joining us for dinner.  
                    Breakfast and lunch are come as you 
                    may... 

      Henley nods... Looking at that red splotch on Dot s nose.                                                                                    22.


    - The kitchen.  Spacious.  More modern appliances here.  Big 
      work station.  Pots bubble on the stove.  A SMALL WOMAN in 
    her mid-50s is slicing vegetables...

                                  DOT MANNING
                    This is Colleen.  She s from 
                    Ecuador.  My chief cook and bottle-
                    washer.  Befriend Colleen, Henley, 
                    and life at Manning s shall be one 
                      well-lived.  You re free to use the 
                     fridge. And the microwave.  But 
                    the stove and the oven are off-
                    limits...

    She turns to Henley... And, at last, Henley can take it no 
      more... She gestures to the splotch on Dot s nose...

                                  HENLEY
                    You... Uh...

    Dot wipes her nose, looks at the crimson blob on her finger.

                                  DOT MANNING
                    Oh, dear.   Just a little blood.
                    I have been known to chop up an 
                    unruly boarder and serve them as 
                    stew...

    And she holds up a large carving knife and smiles... Henley 
      looks slightly freaked...

                                  DOT MANNING
                    Joking, luv.  It s chutney.  I was 
                    making dinner when you arrived.
                          (to Miranda)
                    The kids today.  So serious...

      And then she s off... Henley looks at Miranda, who shrugs...

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY
                    Chutney.

    - The living room.  Where FOUR WOMEN, in their 60s and 7Os:  
      ROSE PERKINS, ESTHER KLAPMAN, IRENE VAUGHN, and JOANIE 
      JENKINS, are knee-deep in a game of bridge...

                                  DOT MANNING
                    Henley, these are my widows:  Rose, 
                    Esther, Irene, Joanie.  This is 
                    Henley.  She ll be staying here for 
                    a while...

      Clucks of  welcome  and  hello ...                                                                                     23.


    - The main staircase.  They climb up to the second floor 
      landing, where the bedrooms are... They pass another 
      staircase, heading up to the 3rd floor:

                                  DOT MANNING
                    The 3rd floor is strictly off-
                    limits.  Failure to adhere to this 
                    rule will result in termination of 
                    your stay here...  

      Henley smiles.  Dot shakes her head, suddenly officious...

                                  DOT MANNING
                    No, this time I m not joking.

    And she walks down the hallway... Again Henley looks to 
      Miranda... Again Miranda shrugs...

      They pass another room along the long, dark corridor.  The 
      door is ajar.  Inside, sitting at his desk, is a man, late 
      50s.  This is MERRITT GRIEVES.  

    He is handsome, in a slightly vampiric way.  His accent is 
      mid-Atlantic.  He is reading from a file.  Dot Manning stops 
    at his door...

                                  DOT MANNING
                    Will you be joining us for dinner 
                    tonight, Mr. Grieves?  We re 
                    serving lamb.  Mint-rubbed... 

    And Henley notices Dot Manning s chubby cheeks redden in the 
      presence of this man...

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    Regrettably, no, Mrs. Manning.  My 
                    stomach is sour.  Has been all day.

                                  DOT MANNING
                    Oh, dear.  I ll send Colleen up 
                    with some bicarbonate of soda...

      Dot walks off down the hall, Miranda following her... Henley 
      and Merritt Grieves exchange a look... He smiles slightly... 
      And then Henley catches up to the other women...

                                  DOT MANNING
                    Mr. Grieves moved here six months 
                    ago.  Opened a shop in town.  This 
                    is your room --

      She opens the door to a room.  It is small but clean and well-
      lighted.  A bed, a dresser, some floral prints, a small desk.                                                                                    24.


                                  HENLEY
                    It s perfect.

                                  DOT MANNING
                    I m glad.  We ll leave you to get 
                    settled...

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    We ll talk soon, Henley --

                                  HENLEY
                    Thank-you for everything, Miss 
                    Kirby...

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    Miranda, silly.

    And they are gone... And Henley exhales, as if she d been 
      holding her breath for the last 20 minutes... She looks out 
    her second story window... And she can see, up on the hill, 
    THE BREAD FACTORY... Smokestacks chuffing... Which will allow 
    us our transition to --

      INT.   OUR DAILY  BAKING AND CONFECTIONERY - DAY

    The bread factory that allows Haplin to thrive.  It s an 
      enormous industrial space, fully-automated, yet employing 
      some 1,000 workers, in white smocks and nylon hair-nets...

      Rachel Conroy is giving a tour - to a FIFTH GRADE CLASS from 
    a neighboring town...  

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    Here we see the containers in which 
                    flour, water, salt, fat and yeast 
                    are mixed... The mix is then placed 
                    into these kneading troughs, to 
                    ferment the yeast... This takes 
                    three hours, and allows the dough 
                    to rise...

      Rachel looks up, to the glassed-in aerie, two stories above.  
      These are the executive offices, and they provide a view of 
    the entire floor...

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    These huge mixers will then knead 
                    the dough for eight minutes, and 
                    then it is emptied into a large tub 
                    and loaded onto a slide above this 
                    machine - the dough-divider.  The 
                    dough now weighs a little over a 
                    ton...                                                                                    25.


    She glances up again to one office in particular:  John 
      Haplin s.  In time to see Carl Danco (the furious African-
      American man from the town square imbroglio), enter...

      INT.  JOHN HAPLIN S OFFICE -  OUR DAILY  - DAY

      Danco stands before Haplin s desk, which is overcrowded with 
      invoices and ledgers... We should also note the two FRAMED 
      PHOTOGRAPHS on his desk:  one shows John Haplin, his wife, 
      CAROL, (a brunette in her mid-30s), and their son, Andrew, 
      (the sullen 17-year-old eating at the counter in Big Dave s).

    The second FRAMED PHOTO is of a sweet-faced 9-YEAR-OLD GIRL, 
      with blonde spit curls, button nose, dimpled chin.  This is 
      ADDIE HAPLIN... 

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    From now on, Carl, you want to talk 
                    to me about something, you come in 
                    here... You don t do it in front of 
                    the town like that...

                                  CARL DANCO
                    That s called having a forum.  In 
                    here, you don t have to be 
                      accountable for nothing.  Out 
                    there... Different story...

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    It happens again... You re 
                    finished.  That kind of public 
                    insubordination just can t be....

                                  CARL DANCO
                    You ain t gonna do that.  Else 
                    you ll be manning the ovens 
                    yourself.   cause half the work 
                    force will walk with me.  You 
                    forget:  I am their beloved line 
                    foreman.  Where as you... Are not.

      INT.  HAPLIN SHERIFF S STATION - DAY

    A smallish municipal building in the center of town, which 
      houses the Sheriff's offices, records, dispatch center, and 
    the four-cell county jail...

    The Sheriff s Office includes 14 Patrol Deputies (Tommy 
      Conroy, Root Beer and Kelvin are three of them); 2 Night 
      Sergeants;  1 Day Sergeant;  2 clerical/records employees;  a 
      Dispatch Center with 3 full-time 911 Emergency Operators;  1 
      Chief Deputy/Investigator (Roger Hobbs);  and the Sheriff..                                                                                     26.


    And it s mostly bedlam now, as they deal with something they 
      haven t had to deal with much, if at all:  murder. 

    As Tommy and Sheriff Conroy walk through, they are braced by 
    the Day Sergeant - SHELL JENKINS, 24 - who somehow manages to 
    be mousy and wildly forceful at the same time...

      Tommy sports a purplish shiner where Danco punched him...

                                  SHELL JENKINS
                    State Police Barracks are sending a 
                    car over for the body, Sheriff --

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Izzat so?  They re not even gonna 
                    give us 11 seconds with it... ?

                                  SHELL JENKINS
                    Captain Frost orders...

    She slaps a stack of phone messages into the Sheriff s hands.

                                  SHELL JENKINS
                    And Peggy Haplin s office called. 
                    Six times.  Then the great lady 
                    called herself...

    The retinue follows Sheriff Conroy into his office - a 
      smallish room at the back of the station... We should notice 
    the array of decorative Sioux TOMAHAWKS adorning the walls... 
    It would appear Sheriff Conroy collects tribal hatchets...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    How d she sound?

                                  SHELL JENKINS
                    Like she d been eating hornets for 
                    breakfast...

      INT.   OUR DAILY  BAKING AND CONFECTIONERY - DAY

      Rachel Conroy continues to give the tour...

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    The dough is then rolled out to 
                    exact size and filled into baking 
                    molds, which shape the loaves...  

      Again, her eyes tick up to John Haplin s office... So --                                                                                    27.


      INT.  JOHN HAPLIN S OFFICE - DAY

      John Haplin dials the phone... It is answered by his wife,  
      CAROL HAPLIN, 35, the same pretty brunette we saw in the 
      photo on John Haplin s desk.  But in person she has a 
      slightly manic sheen to her brown eyes.... She is in A 
      BEDROOM of their home... CROSS-CUT AS NECESSARY...

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    You okay?

                                  CAROL HAPLIN
                    I m fine.  Just... Reading.

      Beat... And he senses something... So:

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    You re in the room again, aren t 
                    you?

                                  CAROL HAPLIN
                          (caught)
                    Just making up the bed.  I washed 
                    the sheets.  Spring cleaning and 
                    what not...

      And we PULL WIDER:  to reveal she is in a CHILD S BEDROOM.  
      Clearly a young girl s...

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    Dammit, Carol -- !

                                  CAROL HAPLIN
                    I found the book,  SPAGHETTI ON THE 
                    MOON .  Remember it?  You used to 
                    read it to her... ?

    She is holding a CHILDREN S BOOK... A sad smile on her 
      face... And she absently hangs up the telephone without 
      saying goodbye...

      John Haplin looks at the receiver... Shakes his head... But 
      then he looks out the window of his office... To see --

      From the employees  entrance, Deputies Root Beer Rogers and 
      Kelvin Tolliver have entered the factory...  

      Rachel watches as Root Beer asks a question to a WORKER 
      manning the dough-divider... The worker points to another 
      worker - a WOMAN, early 40s - who oversees the sifter...

      Root Beer and Kelvin head over to the sifter... All eyes are 
      upon them... The presence of cops never augurs anything good.                                                                                    28.


                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    Donna Friddle?  

    The woman tugs down her surgical mask.  This is DONNA 
      FRIDDLE.  She is slightly sour-looking.  Life has not been 
      easy... 

                                  DONNA FRIDDLE
                    Yes?

                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    We are here about your husband.  
                    Jerry...

      Rachel watches, as Root Beer and Kelvin give her the news, 
      Rachel sees Donna Friddle shakes her head.  

    And Donna Friddle wails and reaches into the sifter, and 
      begins to hysterically toss clumps of flour all over the 
      place, in a crazed flurry... The school children look 
      afraid... Rachel tries to calm them...

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    Okay, kids... Let s go to the 
                    tasting room, and see if we can t 
                    get a nibble of some hot, fresh 
                    rolls straight out of the oven!

    And as she hustles them away, her eyes once again, go to John 
      Haplin s office... Where he is watching Donna Friddle s 
      histrionics, his face impassive...

                         ACT FOUR*

      EXT.  HAPLIN HIGH SCHOOL - TO ESTABLISH - DAY

      KIDS and cars are scattered about this public school, erected 
      in the early 1930s.  Brick and bramble and clinging ivy... 

      INT.  HAPLIN HIGH - DAY

      Georgia walks down the crowded corridor with her girlfriend, 
      LANI, 17... 

                                  LANI
                    ... and he was totally killed in 
                    Raymond Manning s ice shack...

                                    GEORGIA
                    The one on Mac s?

                                  LANI
                    Yes... 

      Georgia looks slightly freaked... After all, she may have 
      come very close to witnessing to the murder...

                                    GEORGIA
                    I can t picture him.  Jerry 
                      Friddle...

                                  LANI
                    He was the custodian at the 
                    library.   The Skulker ?  Remember:  
                    they fired him  cause he would hide 
                    behind the stacks and stare at the 
                    women and the girls...

                                    GEORGIA
                    Oh, that guy.  The skinny guy...

                                  LANI
                    Yeah.  He was so the creep.  But 
                    still... He didn t deserve this...
                          (she sees)
                    Aw, no...

      Georgia follows her look... To where Andrew Haplin and his 
      CRONIES - in their letter jackets and zippy haircuts - cavort 
      by their lockers...

      Haplin and his crew are clearly the  popular crowd .  Rich, 
      athletic, college-bound... Andrew sees Georgia and Lani 
      approaching...                                                                                    30.


                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    Hey, fellas, look who it is!  
                    Direct from the government-
                    subsidized sub-division known as 
                    Cook s Ridge.  Where Cockroaches Go 
                    To Die...

    His friends laugh... Lani stands strong... 

                                  LANI
                    Why don t you--

    But Georgia backs her off...

                                  GEORGIA
                    Don t even.  Can t you see, Lani?  
                    Being mean to girls is how these 
                    clunks hide the fact that they are 
                    deep in the throes of homosexual 
                    panic... 

                                  LANI
                    Oh.  I see....

    The boys don t like this at all...

                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    How s your dad, Georgia?  Still 
                    cooking the meth?   Cause we saw 
                    him last night on Truck Trail Two, 
                    singing at the top of his tweaked 
                    lungs... He was singing that old 
                    song,  You re So Vain ?  But he had 
                    changed the words...
                          (sings)
                     In my veins/I think I ll shoot 
                    some meth in my forearm...   

      Andrew s friends laugh.  We can see that hurt Georgia... But 
    she dismisses this cruelty and marches off, Andrew s singing 
      following her down the hall... As we CUT TO:

      INT.  HAPLIN SHERIFF S STATION - DAY

      Where the phones are blazing... The hustle is bustling... We 
    get the sense that Haplin is ill-equipped to handle a murder 
        investigation... Especially as Root Beer Rogers and Kelvin 
      Tolliver enter Sheriff Conroy s office, covered in flour...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    The hell happened to you?                                                                                    31.


                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    Donna Friddle had a strong reaction 
                    to the news of her husband s 
                    demise... She s in Room 1...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    You brought her here?

                                  KELVIN TOLLIVER
                    What were we supposed to do with 
                    her?

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    She s not a suspect!  You give her 
                    the news... Then we question her at 
                    home after she s had time to 
                    process things properly...

      Root Beer and Kelvin exchange a look...

                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    Oh.  Should we bring her home?

    As they move for the interrogation room, Tommy is stopped by 
    Big Dave Duncan, still in his pizzeria whites... 

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    Hey, T.C., what s going on?

                                  TOMMY
                    It s a whole magungle... What are 
                    you doing here?

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    Thought we were putting the  Dallas 
                    Alice  in the water today... ? 

                                  TOMMY
                    It s not a good time... We got... 
                    There s been a murder...

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    A murder?  Who was murdered?  

                                  TOMMY
                    I gotta go.  Talk to you later. *

    And he follows the others into the interrogation room...

      INT.  HAPLIN HIGH - MUSIC ROOM - DAY

      Georgia panthers the deserted room... Pacing nervously back 
    and forth around the music stands and drum kits... When 
      Andrew Haplin enters... They stare at each other a beat...                                                                                     32.


                                  GEORGIA
                    You think that was gilding the lily 
                    a little bit, dude?  My Dad?

                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    Sorry...

      And, to our great surprise, he takes her in his arms... And 
      they kiss... Long and passionately... She breaks it for:

                                    GEORGIA
                    I think we need ground rules...

                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    Okay.

                                    GEORGIA
                    My father is off-limits.  So is my 
                    taste in music.  And my ass...   

                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    Your ass is beautiful.

                                    GEORGIA
                    Exactly.  Which is why it s off-
                    limits...

      He nods... And kisses her again... He begins to unbutton her 
      shirt... She stops him...

                                    GEORGIA
                    What should I do?  About the ice-
                    shack... ?

                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    What do you want to do?  You didn t 
                    actually see anything... And how 
                    are you going to explain what you 
                    were doing in Seton Woods, after 
                    midnight, in the freezing cold?

                                    GEORGIA
                    I could tell the truth:  that I was 
                    in a parked car snogging The Golden 
                    Boy Of Happy Town.  His grandma is 
                    The Mayor.  My grandma used to 
                    dance for the money they d throw.  
                    His father owns the bread factory.  
                    My father owns a meth lab...

                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    Great way to guarantee I am never 
                    allowed out of the house again...                                                                                    33.


                                  GEORGIA
                    I m just so over this whole Romeo 
                    and Juliet thing...

    He kisses her...

                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    I know.  But it s not going to be 
                    like this forever...

                                  GEORGIA
                    Right.  Eventually a meteor will 
                    hit planet earth, wiping out all 
                    humanity as we know it.  And then 
                    you and I will be able to hold 
                    hands in public...

    He smiles...

                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    I love you so much, most of the 
                    time I don t even know what day it 
                    is...

                                  GEORGIA
                    It s Grow-A-Pair Day.

    But she kisses him.  Deeply.  These two are clearly in love.

                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    I m late for practice... Can I see 
                    you later?  
                          (nothing from her)
                    Georgia?  Can I see you later?

      After a beat, she relents... Sighs...

                                  GEORGIA
                    Fine.  You bring the poison.  I ll 
                    bring the dagger...

    He smiles... Kisses her... And then he s gone, leaving her 
      alone with the dusty musical instruments and her conflict... 

      INT.  HAPLIN SHERIFF S OFFICE - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 

      Donna Friddle sits at a table.  Sheriff Conroy and Roger 
      Hobbs question her, while the Deputies look on...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Did Jerry have any enemies you can 
                    think of?                                                                                    34.


                                  DONNA FRIDDLE
                    He didn t have any enemies I can t 
                    think of...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Mrs. Friddle --

                                  DONNA FRIDDLE
                    My Jerry was persecuted here.  
                    Always.  On account of he liked to 
                    look at the girls.  Didn t bother 
                    me none.  He was a looker.  He 
                    looked.  He didn t touch.  And then 
                    he loses his job... A job he s had 
                    for 22 years?  

                                  ROGER HOBBS
                    He was making folks uncomfortable.

                                  DONNA FRIDDLE
                    Looking isn t skulking.  Looking 
                    isn t touching.  But in this town, 
                    if you pay attention to people who 
                    aren t necessarily you re friends, 
                    well, you gotta be  Magic Man  
                    material, don t you?   Because - 
                    remember what they used to say back 
                    when it was happening:   one thing 
                    you can count on:  The Magic Man?  
                    He s somebody you passed by on the 
                    street today...  

    The lawmen exchange a look... As if the mere mention of the 
      words  Magic Man  is like a hex...

                                  DONNA FRIDDLE
                    But all you need is to start with 
                    the Stiviletto Brothers.  They 
                    never left my Jerry alone.  They 
                    picked on him every chance they 
                    had...

                                  TOMMY
                    The Stiviletto Brothers pick on 
                    everyone every chance they have...

                                  DONNA FRIDDLE
                    They especially picked on my Jerry.

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    And at what point did Chloe contact 
                    you?                                                                                    35.


                                  DONNA FRIDDLE
                    What?

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    And did you realize the glow in her 
                    mouth was the silvery moon?

    And Tommy and the others look at Sheriff Conroy, whose eyes 
      have momentarily glazed-over...

                                  DONNA FRIDDLE
                    What the hell is he talking about?

                                  ROGER HOBBS
                    Griff?

                                  TOMMY
                    Pop?

    And just as quickly, he is back.  Focused on Donna Friddle:

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Which Stiviletto brother in 
                      particular?

      Roger Hobbs looks at Tommy.   What the hell was that?   But 
      then Shell sticks her head in... 

                                  SHELL JENKINS
                    Doctor Pete is on line 3...

                                    SHERIFF CONROY
                    Talk to him will ya, Tommy?

      Tommy does leaving the interrogation room, and picking up the 
      telephone at the front desk... INTERCUT WITH DOCTOR PETE 
      WEAVER, early 30s.  A quirky fellow and a pal of Tommy s...  

                                  TOMMY
                    Hey...

                                  DOCTOR PETE
                    Hey, buddy.  So they came to take 
                    the body to the State Barracks.  
                    They re gonna do a whole work-up.  
                    Don t have any faith in us here, at 
                    the helm of our turnip trucks...

                                  TOMMY
                    Okay.  Thanks.  I ll let everybody 
                    know.  Hey, Pete.  When s the last 
                    time my Dad had a check-up... ?                                                                                    36.


                                  DOCTOR PETE
                    Griff?  I d have to look at my 
                    records.  Last year some time?  
                    Why?

                                  TOMMY
                    I dunno.  He s been acting funny...

                                  DOCTOR PETE
                    He s got his first homicide ever. 
                    Of course he s been acting funny... 

      Tommy looks into the interrogation room, where he can see his 
      father continues to question Donna Friddle...

                                  DOCTOR PETE
                    Speaking of which... That big hole 
                    in Jerry Friddle s head?

                                  TOMMY
                    Yeah?

                                  DOCTOR PETE
                    It was made by a spike.  

                                  TOMMY
                    A spike?

                                  DOCTOR PETE
                    Yep.  A railroad spike.

                                  TOMMY
                    A railroad spike.

      Tommy looks back to the interrogation room.  And we CUT TO:

    A RAILROAD SPIKE

      hammered into the side of a ramshackle clapboard house, 
      holding up a home-made wood-carved sign that reads:  
       STIVILETTO ...

      EXT.  STIVILETTO COMPOUND - DAY

      It s a fetid cluster of tilting structures, surrounding a 
      MAIN HOUSE... This was clearly once a working farm... Only 
    now the pasture is a delta of mud;  the tower silo leans to 
    the left;  the machinery shed is missing its roof, etc.  

    All fronting - a half mile in the distance - the TOWN DUMP - 
    a veritable 30-acre landscape of dirt and discarded objects 
      atop of foundation of garbage and debris.                                                                                      37.


      Gulls circle and dive-bomb and caw their strident caws... A 
      pair of enormous EARTH-MOVERS gleam shiny yellow - as if they 
    are the only things in this blighted place that are lovingly 
      cleaned and tended-to...

      Tommy and Sheriff Conroy pull-up in the Crown Vic... 

                                  TOMMY
                    God, I hate these guys...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    You and the rest of the free world.

      They climb out of the car... A few chickens cluck and 
      scrabble in the dirt, avoiding the trio of nasty ROTTWEILERS 
      chained to a buried spike by the former sheep shelter...

    As Tommy and the Sheriff approach the front door, they see a 
      MAN, 24, chasing a piglet around the yard... He is called 
      BABY BOY, and he is mentally disabled, possessing the 
      guileless curiosity inherent in his condition. 

                                  BABY BOY STIVILETTO
                    Hello, Sheriff Griffin Conroy.  Top 
                    of them morning to you...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Top of them morning to you, too, 
                    Baby Boy... 

                                  BABY BOY STIVILETTO
                    Greggy is coming home soon from The 
                    Long Place, Deputy Thomas Conroy.  
                    Are you scared?

                                  TOMMY
                    Why should I be scared?  Greggy is 
                    gonna come out of penitentiary a 
                    proper citizen...

    And Baby Boy sniggers... Even he is not too slow to know 
      there s not a fucking chance of that...

      Tommy and Sheriff Conroy go around the back of the main 
      house, where they find the rest of the Stiviletto Brothers.  
    Who are:

    - RONALD STIVILETTO.  At 31, he is the putative leader, while 
    the oldest brother - GREGGY - is away at prison. 

    - LINCOLN STIVILETTO, 29.  A scrawny, weasel with a pinched 
      face and a nasty disposition...

    - WOMPER STIVILETTO, 27.  Enormously fat and mean and dirty.                                                                                    38.


    *** (A word about The Stiviletto Brothers.  Every town has - 
    and fears - a family like The Stiviletto Brothers.  They were 
      bullies in high school, piling up expulsions, DUIs, B&E 
      arrests, and if there was trouble to be had, they found it.  
    As adults, one would assume they are still up to no good.)

    As Tommy and the Sheriff approach... We see that the 
      Stiviletto Boys are building some kind of WOODEN TANK, like 
    the kind used in  dunk-the-clown  games at carnivals:  

      There is a seat, above a tank full of water... And softballs 
    are thrown at two targets on either side of the seat... It is 
      almost finished... A painted SIGN, with the letters  DUNK-THE-
      DIMWIT  across it, hangs on the side... 

    A keg is buried in a barrel of snow.  Stereo speakers in the 
      windows of a tractor shed blast some old-school metal (not 
      dissimilar to the Megadeth played in the ice shack)...

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    Look... It s Sheriff Andy Taylor 
                    and his boy, Opie, come-a-calling!

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Whatchoo boys doing??

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    It s our contribution to the  Thaw 
                    Fest .  For 50 cents, you get three 
                    chances to  Dunk-The-Dimwit .
                          (gestures to Baby Boy)
                    And here s the dimwit!

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Well, that ain t particularly nice.

                                  LINCOLN STIVILETTO
                    Also ain t particularly nowhere 
                    near your business --

                                  TOMMY
                    Why don t you settle down, Ronald?

                                  LINCOLN STIVILETTO
                    Don t even fake you re a hard guy, 
                    T.C.  Your old man weren t the 
                    Sheriff, you d be working for us at 
                    the dump, shooting rats...

                                  WOMPER STIVILETTO
                    If he knew how to fire a gun...

    And they chortle, as their kind will...                                                                                     39.


                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Where were you boys last night?

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    We were here...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    All night?

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    All night.  

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Break it down for me...

                                  LINCOLN STIVILETTO
                    Why should we--

    But his brother holds up a hand to quiet him...

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                      Eazy-peezy, Sheriff.  We were here 
                    all night.  Exceptin  for when 
                    Lincoln went into town to get a 
                    pizza from Big Dave s.  He come 
                    back.  We ate the pizza.  And then 
                    Ronald and Link worked on The 
                    Dunker.  And then Baby Boy watched 
                    a little reality television.  And 
                    then my girl, Kissy, came by and I 
                    made sweet love to her, while she 
                    read a movie magazine...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    You had a problem with Jerry 
                    Friddle?

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    Nah, he was okay.  Other than he 
                    did a lot of around-town-pervin ...

      Sheriff Conroy nods... Then:

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Chloe know you re here?

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    Who?  What?

    And Sheriff Conroy looks like he s momentarily lost his place 
    in a novel he was reading...

                                  TOMMY
                    Dad -- ?                                                                                    40.


      Sheriff Conroy blinks and he s back... Just as Baby Boy comes 
      around, climbing onto the seat in the  Dunk-A-Dimwit  tanks.

                                  BABY BOY STIVILETTO
                    Watch this, Conroy Men.  Watch me 
                    go, go, go!!!

      Sheriff Conroy would rather not... He turns to Ronald, as 
      Womper picks up two softballs... 

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Don t leave town --

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    We never leave town...

      Womper whips a softball at the target.  It goes wide left. 

                                  BABY BOY STIVILETTO
                    Womper stinks!  Womper stinks!

      Sheriff Conroy and Tommy begin to walk away... And the 
      rottweilers start to bark their heads off... Straining their 
      chains, jaws slavered with foam... Lincoln calls after Tommy:

                                  LINCOLN STIVILETTO
                    Hey, T.C.?  Greggy be gettin  out 
                    soon...

      Womper has tossed another ball... This one connects... And 
      Baby Boy gets dunked... The Rotts bark their heads off... 

                                  LINCOLN STIVILETTO
                    He s gonna be two things when he 
                    does...

                                  TOMMY
                    And what s that, Lincoln?

                                  LINCOLN STIVILETTO
                    He s gonna be rested.  And he s 
                    gonna be mad...

      Lincoln grins and goes back to where his brothers carouse. 
    Off Tommy, suddenly certain there are bad things ahead --

                   END OF ACT FOUR*                                                                                    41.

      INT. HAPLIN COUNTY SHERIFF S OFFICE - NIGHT *

      It is quieter now.  A few UNIFORMS are here.  And Sheriff  *
      Conroy, Kelvin Tolliver, and Roger Hobbs... *

      Tommy sits behind his desk, feet up, thumbing through the 
      Stiviletto case file... But he does so with a certain 
      detachment, knowing the weight of this investigation does not 
      lie with him.  He clocks the Sheriff, who is tasking Hobbs...

                                    SHERIFF CONROY
                    We re gonna let those boys stew in 
                    their own filth for a couple 
                    days... Get cozy with the thought 
                    that they re off our radar...  Use 
                    that time to load the cannons.  For 
                    when they slip.   Cause they will 
                    slip...

                                  ROGER HOBBS
                    Sounds good, Griff...

      The Sheriff goes into his office.  Tommy, figuring he s off 
      the hook, tosses the Stiviletto case file on his desk... 
      Hobbs  phone rings... He answers...

                                  ROGER HOBBS
                    Hobbs.  
                          (listens; to Kelvin)
                    It s the lab... They found 
                    something on the victim.
                          (into phone)
                    Couldn t be discharge residue... 
                    Our man didn t use a firearm.  
                    Where on the body...?  Okay...

      Tommy and Kelvin listen --

                                  ROGER HOBBS (INTO PHONE)
                    Well why didn t ya say so?  If it 
                    could be baking flour, it is baking 
                    flour.  Haplin s got the third 
                    biggest bread factory in the state.  
                    It rains flour around here!  We re 
                    all covered in it!!!  All right... 
                    Thanks...

    He hangs up...                                                                                     42.

                    body tested positive for high 
                    traces of baking flour!  Since I 
                    moved here, the back of my balls 
                    would test positive for high traces 
                    of baking flour!  I ll go tell

      INT.  MANNING BOARDING HOUSE - COMMUNAL BATHROOM - NIGHT

      Henley finishes up a shower.  She takes a moment to let the 
      steaming water pulse onto her face.  As if a small baptism, a 
      cleansing... She shuts off the faucet and we CUT TO:

      INT.  MANNING BOARDING HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Henley exits the bathroom, hair still wet, wearing a robe.  
    The wood floors are cold on her feet, the night chill a stark 
      contrast to her flushed pink skin.  

    As she moves towards her room, things seem to slow down...  
    As her attention drifts...  

    To THE STAIRWELL... Which leads to the THIRD FLOOR... She 
      stops in her tracks and considers it for a beat...  

    Is there a sound coming from up there?  No.  But what she is 
      hearing is somehow more ominous... It s the absence of sound.  
      The imperceptible hum of hollow air...  Henley regards it for 
    a beat, when...

                                  DOT MANNING (O.S.)
                    You said you d be joining us for 
                    supper? 

      Startled, Henley turns to see Dot Manning.  Who is none too 
      pleased by Henley staring at the third floor.  But she does 
      not make text of this...

                                  DOT MANNING
                    The soup is fresh cabbage.

      With that, Dot Manning leaves.  But we stay with Henley.  And 
      we are unsure if she was just foiled or spared from taking 
      that forbidden journey up into the darkness, so we ll CUT TO:  *

      INT.  HAPLIN SHERIFF S OFFICE - NIGHT

      It is quieter now.  Tommy is at his desk.  When he sees his  *
      father, in his office, packing up his things for the night...  *

      Tommy goes to his father s office --*                                                                                    43.


                                  TOMMY*
                    Heading out?*

                                  SHERIFF CONROY*
                    Tonight, my boy, is a night I will  *
                    not sleep... I will slumber. *

      And this is hard for Tommy... Delicate... *

                                  TOMMY
                    Can I ask you a question?

                                    SHERIFF CONROY
                    Always --

      And this is hard for Tommy... Delicate...

                                  TOMMY
                    Are you... Feeling alright?

                                    SHERIFF CONROY
                    My knee is creaking on me.  But 
                    what else is new?

                                  TOMMY
                    No.  I mean... Today... You said 
                    things... 

                                    SHERIFF CONROY
                    What things?

      Tommy spills it out...

                                  TOMMY
                    Who s Chloe?

                                    SHERIFF CONROY
                    Chloe?

                                  TOMMY
                    Yeah.  Who is she?

                                    SHERIFF CONROY
                    I don t know anyone by that name.  

      And Sheriff Conroy is sincere.  Which troubles Tommy more...

                                  TOMMY
                    Right.  Maybe you should make an 
                      appointment with Doc Pete?  Have 
                    him check under the hood?

                                    SHERIFF CONROY
                    I m fine...                                                                                    44.


                                  TOMMY
                    You talk about forgetting the past.  
                    Yet you still wear your wedding 
                    ring.  And Ma s been gone three 
                    years now...

      Sheriff Conway regards him for a beat... Then:

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    The sense of touch is the most 
                      unappreciated of the five senses.  
                    As long as this ring is on my 
                    finger, it s as if I m still 
                    holding her hand... 

    But Sheriff Conroy senses this hasn t eased Tommy s worry.

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Chin to the moon, son.  This was a 
                    dark day for Haplin.  We have had a 
                    seven year run of keeping that 
                    darkness from the township...

                                  TOMMY
                    You did.

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    However you slice it, for seven 
                    years there were no major felonies, 
                    no Magic Man, no murders.  Until 
                    this morning...  
                          (a beat)
                    And we ll get it back.  The good 
                    yesterday.  Take station with that. 

      But Tommy isn t convinced... Sheriff Conroy grabs his 
      belongings and exits...   But not before:

                                    SHERIFF CONROY (CONT D)
                    Hugs to the girls.

      Tommy nods and watches his father go... And the love and 
      admiration he feels for his father is present on his face... 
      As is the worry...

      INT.  MANNING BOARDING HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

      Henley, now dressed, approaches the dinner table, where Dot 
      Manning and the four widows are eating their soup...

                                  HENLEY
                    Sorry I m late everyone...

      Henley takes a seat in front of a bowl of soup...                                                                                    45.


                                  HENLEY
                    This looks delicious.

    She takes a spoonful... The women look at her, at each 
      other... Then, finally:

                                  ROSE
                    A woman travelling alone, they say, 
                    is either running from a man or to  
                    a man.  Which is it for you, dear?

                                  DOT MANNING
                    Irene -- !

                                  IRENE
                    What?  Girl-talk.  Right, Henley?

                                  HENLEY
                    Right.  It s okay.  And the answer 
                    is neither.  There s no man on 
                    either side of my travels...
                          (a beat)
                    But, I did kiss a cute accountant 
                    on the train ride in.  He was 
                    heading to Missoula and we made a 
                    point not to exchange phone 
                    numbers!   It was verrry 1970s.  

                                  IRENE
                    Well you ve come to the right 
                    place.  Don t let this trouble at 
                    the pond make you think otherwise.

                                  HENLEY
                    What trouble at the pond?

                                  ESTHER
                    Murder!

      Henley looks at her...

                                  DOT MANNING
                    The town weirdo.  An awful man.  
                    I m not saying he deserved to die.  
                    In my late husband s ice fishing 
                    shack, no less.  But he angered a 
                    lot of people around here with his 
                    shifty eyes and perverted ways...

    She finishes.  They all look at her... Then, to Henley:

                                  DOT MANNING
                    Gorgonzola on your soup?                                                                                    46.


    She slides a bowl of crumbled cheese over... But the moment 
    is interrupted by the SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS.  The Widows sit up 
    in their chairs, suddenly giddy...

                                  IRENE
                    Here he comes!

      Hair is fixed.  Collars are smoothed-out.  Henley is a little 
      confused by this sudden eruption of primping... Until --

      Merritt Grieves - the lone male boarder - enters the dining 
      room, wearing his coat... 

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    Good evening, ladies...

                                  DOT MANNING
                    Feeling any better?

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    Regrettably, no.  I m hoping the 
                    night air will bring a fix...

                                  ROSE
                    I ll leave some preserves on your 
                    night stand.  On a slice of toast!  
                    That and some warm ginger ale 
                    always does the trick!

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    Thank-you, Rose.  Ladies...

    And Grieves smiles at them all... And gives Henley a nod... 
      After he s gone, the Widows flit into a chorus of schoolgirl 
      giggles...  Esther swats Rose...

                                  ESTHER
                    You trollop!

                                  ROSE 
                    I will make no apologies!  In fact, 
                    I may just be laying across that 
                    slice of toast on his night stand!

      Hoots and giggles.  But Dot Manning who, while equally 
      entranced by Grieves, clearly disapproves of the overt 
      clucking of The Widows... Esther turns to Henley:

                                  ESTHER
                    Mr. Grieves is from Manchester. 

                                  JOANIE
                      Manchester, England, England.  
                    Across the Atlantic Sea...                                                                                    47.


                                  DOT MANNING
                    Which is greatly exciting to some.

                                  JOANIE
                    It s like living under the same 
                    roof as Rex Harrison!

                                  IRENE
                    He came to Haplin to open a 
                      memorabilia shop!  

      Henley is amused...

                                  HENLEY
                    So.  Who s got first crack?

                                  ESTHER
                    What do you mean?

                                  HENLEY
                    Who s gonna bump his bones?  Take 
                    the paint off his porch?  Squall 
                    and ball and climb the wall?

      There is a beat of stunned silence... And then the widows 
      collapse into a titter of nervous giggles and pointed 
      fingers, blushes and swoons...

                                  ESTHER
                    That question may be the end of us!  
                    You don t find men like Merritt 
                    Grieves in Haplin County...

                                  JOANIE
                    Stick around and you ll see!

      More giggles and titters... Until, the ringing of a spoon 
      against a drinking glass (wedding kiss-style), silences them.

    It is Dot Manning.  Admonishing.  Annoyed.

                                  DOT MANNING
                    Soup is getting cold, ladies.  Soup 
                    is getting cold...

      Uttered like a command.  The Widows, properly chastised, pick 
    up their spoons.  But Henley is pleased at her ability to 
      keep things lively...

      Until she looks up... To see Dot Manning glowering at her, 
      eyes bloodshot with unbridled anger... An anger that appears 
    to be all out of proportion to the infraction... 

                      END OF ACT FIVE*                                                                                    48.


                           ACT SIX*


      INT.  CONROY HOUSE - DINING AREA - NIGHT

      Tommy, Rachel, Emma and Georgia eat dinner...

                                  RACHEL
                    I saw Miranda Kirby at the produce 
                    counter today.  She said they re 
                    expecting the biggest turn-out yet 
                    at Thaw Fest...  
                          (to Emma)
                    Won t that be fun, cookie?

                                  EMMA
                    I wanna wear my purple dress.

                                    GEORGIA
                    I can t believe they re even going 
                    ahead with it.  Considering...

                                  RACHEL
                      Considering what?

      And, of course, she is referring to the murder.  But Tommy 
      doesn t want to open up that can of worms in front of Emma.

                                  TOMMY
                      Considering that the weather hasn t 
                    broken yet.  Right, Georgia?

      Tommy glares at Georgia - agree with me.

                                  GEORGIA
                    Right.  Crazy.  A Thaw Fest with no 
                    thaw.  It s like Thanksgiving with 
                    no... Thanks.

      Problem averted.  But only for a beat, as Rachel says:

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    I knew him.  The Skulker.

                                    GEORGIA
                    Really?

                                  TOMMY
                    Do we have to talk about this now?

                                    GEORGIA
                    How did you know him?                                                                                    49.


                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    He skulked me on occasion...

      This gets Tommy s attention --

                                  TOMMY
                    He did?

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    Why is that surprising to you?  Am 
                    I not skulk-worthy?

                                  TOMMY
                    No, it s just... Let s discuss this 
                    later, yes?

    And they go back to their food.  Until --

                                  EMMA
                    Someone got killed-did, I think.

      Tommy and Rachel share a look --

                                  RACHEL
                    Where did you hear that?

                                  EMMA
                    Angela Ferelli told me it.  She 
                    said somebody got killed-did on the 
                    pond.  Where we skate...

      Tommy takes a deep breath --

                                  TOMMY
                    It s true, Emma C.  Somebody did 
                    die today.  But we ve talked about 
                    this.  Everybody goes up to Heaven 
                    at some time.  Just like Grammy...

                                  EMMA
                    Did Grammy get killed-did?

                                  TOMMY
                    No.  Grammy was very old and very 
                    tired and --

                                  RACHEL
                    People die in different ways.  That 
                    man on the pond died because 
                    someone bad hurt him...

      Tommy looks at her... He doesn t want this conversation to 
      happen...                                                                                    50.


                                  TOMMY
                    But most people die like Grammy.  

      This is now a battle of wills between Tommy and Rachel...  
    All Georgia can do is sit back and watch...

                                  RACHEL
                    But sometimes, there are bad people 
                    who--

                                  TOMMY
                    Who you never need to worry about.  
                    Because daddy spends all day making 
                    sure bad things won t happen to 
                    you.  And Gramps, he s in charge of 
                    all the people who make sure bad 
                    things won t happen to you.  And 
                    there s nobody you love or trust 
                    more than Gramps... Right?

                                  EMMA
                    Yuh-huh.

                                  TOMMY
                    Exactly.

      Emma smiles and goes back to her pot pie... Unmindful of the 
      fact that her parents are engaged in a staring contest laden 
      with combustion.  Georgia clocks it...

      INT.  BIG DAVE S PIZZA BARN - NIGHT

      Not much of a dinner crowd.  Mostly take-out.  Sheriff Conroy 
      is at the counter, picking up some food to-go from Big Dave..

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN 
                    Good meatballs today...  

                                    SHERIFF CONROY
                    I ll be the judge of that...

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    Jerry Friddle used to come in here 
                    all the time.  I didn t mind him.  
                    People thought he was strange, 
                    but... You know, he could name 
                    every Viking, by position, since 
                    the franchise started in 1960... ?

                                    SHERIFF CONROY
      Izzat so?  Then maybe Roger Staubach killed him...                                                                                    51.


    And he walks to the door... Big Dave frowns... But on his way 
      out, Sheriff Conroy notices something... Someone... And it 
      stops him in his tracks:

    It is Merritt Grieves.  The mysterious boarder.  Seated in a 
      BOOTH in the back, seriously gorging on an autumn pot roast, 
      maple sweet potatoes, carrots, fennel, and cider gravy - all 
    of which belie his earlier claims of a stale stomach...

      Sheriff Conroy walks over to Grieves, who looks up at him 
      with a piratical gleam --

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    Sheriff...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    I thought we had an agreement.  
                    What are you still doing in my 
                    county?

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    My goodness.  Did you really just 
                    utter a version of  this town ain t 
                    big enough for the both of us ?  
                    How splendid.  A man can go his 
                    entire life without ever hearing a 
                    Sheriff say those words to him...

    A beat... As Sheriff Conroy sizes him up...  Until:

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    It appears you dropped something.

      Grieves points to the linoleum floor.  To where a SILVER 
      STEEL RING lays at Sheriff Conroy s feet.  

    The Sheriff, suddenly concerned, looks at his LEFT HAND - 
      it s bare.  Grieves picks up the ring and holds it out... 

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES (CONT D)
                    Your wedding band?

    And we stay in this moment, as the Sheriff considers 
      Grieves... Considers the ring and his bare hand... And then 
      considers Grieves s deep grey eyes... And we GO TO:

      INT.  CONROY HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Georgia and Emma are watching TV, out of earshot, as Tommy 
    and Rachel do the dishes.  And the tension from their dinner 
      conversation still lingers...                                                                                    52.


                                  RACHEL CONROY 
                    I was only telling her the truth.  
                    If we don t, she ll be a pod... 

                                  TOMMY
                    She ll be a kid...

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    The more we shield her from these 
                    things, Tommy, the less equipped 
                    she ll be to face them... To 
                    protect herself from them... 

                                  TOMMY 
                    Excuse me if I d like to prolong 
                    the innocence of our daughter s 
                    childhood for as long as we can.  
                    What next?   Hey, Emma, guess what:  
                    macaroni and cheese is bad for you 
                    and Jerry Garcia is dead! 

      They stare at each other.  A fight is rare.  But before it 
    can be resolved, THE HOUSE PHONE RINGS.  Rachel answers...

                                  RACHEL CONROY (INTO PHONE)
                    Hello?  Hi...  It s Kelvin...

      Rachel hands Tommy the phone...  

                                  TOMMY (INTO PHONE)
                    Yeah?

                                  KELVIN TOLLIVER (O.S.)
                    You better get down to the station, 
                    T.C.

                                  TOMMY
                    What is it?

                                  KELVIN TOLLIVER (O.S.)
                    It s... It s your father

      Tommy looks to Rachel.  And we SMASH CUT TO:

      INT.  HAPLIN SHERIFF S OFFICE - NIGHT

      Tommy BURSTS through the door, where he is met by Kelvin 
      Tolliver, Roger Hobbs and Root Beer Rogers... 

    The deep BARKING of a MAN S VOICE can be heard in the near 
      distance as Hobbs explains...*                                                                                    53.


                                  ROGER HOBBS
                    We were turning over the Stiviletto 
                    file when he came in...

                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    He stormed right past us, like we 
                    weren t there...

                                  KELVIN TOLLIVER
                    He s outside himself, Tommy.  This 
                    ain t him...

    As Tommy tries to process all this, he realizes that the 
      voice heard in the distance is that of his father - who has 
      locked himself in his office...

      Barricaded himself, in fact.  Tommy pales, as he sees his 
      father in a frenzy... Ranting and raving, disheveled and 
      thrashing about...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    YOU CAN T TAKE IT FROM ME -- !

      Tommy moves toward his father s office --

                                  TOMMY
                    Pop?

      Tommy stands inches from the office window --

                                  TOMMY (CONT D)
                    POP!  LET ME IN!

      Sheriff Conroy turns to Tommy, not quite sure who he is...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    If you touch the Baby Jesus... I 
                    will make you wear the cow suit!

    His eyes are aglow with something that can only be called 
      madness.  But then suddenly, he looks sad.  Resigned...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Chloe burnt the can...

      With that, the Sheriff holds up his left hand... His wedding 
      band glints in the light... Sheriff Conroy locks eyes with 
    his son for the first time... And he begins to sob.  

                                    SHERIFF CONROY (CONT D)
                    He ll be back...

                                  TOMMY
                    Who?                                                                                    54.


                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Now that blood s been spilled 
                    again.  Everything will unravel.  
                    And he ll be back... 

      Then a calm sweeps across his face.  And, somehow, this is 
      more chilling than the manic moaning of seconds before.

                                  TOMMY
                    Pop -- ?

                                  SHERIFF CONROY*
                    He is only born in the instant  *
                    flash of man s capacity for evil.   *
                    And he will thrive in the shadows  *
                    until that wickedness is *
                      vanquished...*

      Sheriff Conroy turns to the wall behind his desk and removes 
    one of his collectible HATCHETS from its wall mount... Tommy 
      pounds on the glass...

                                  TOMMY (CONT D)
                    POP!

                                  KELVIN TOLLIVER
                      Sheriff...!

      Sheriff Conroy sits down at his desk.  Places his LEFT HAND 
    on the blotter...

                                  TOMMY
                    Look at me, Pop!  Look at me!

    And father looks to son.  And then, with tearful resignation:

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    We can t stop him.  We never could.

      Just as the GLASS of the door SHATTERS... Roger Hobbs tossing 
    a chair into it... Hobbs reaches through, trying to turn the 
      knob... But before he can open the door, Sheriff Conroy has 
      raised the hatchet...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    He s a Magic Man.*

      And Sheriff Conroy SWINGS the hatchet down on his wrist. 

      As Tommy cries out in horror, WE SMASH TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT SIX*
                                (END OF HOUR ONE)*                                                                                    55.


                                      ACT SEVEN*


      INT.  HAPLIN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - MORNING

      Tommy paces, talking on his cell-phone, with hushed 
      urgency...  He is leaving a message...

                                  TOMMY (INTO PHONE)
                    It s Thursday morning.... He just 
                    got out of surgery... You need to 
                    call me back, Becca.  You need to 
                    put the child-of-the-wild-blue-
                    yonder stuff on hold and come on 
                    home...

      He turns and looks through an OBSERVATION WINDOW, where he 
      can see Sheriff Conroy, sedated, in a hospital bed.  Tubes 
      run out of him, his left hand is heavily bandaged... 

                                  TOMMY (INTO PHONE)
                    Because this is not a drill, 
                    Rebecca.  Your father just chopped 
                    off his hand with a hatchet.  So 
                    get on a plane or a train or your 
                      motorcycle, and get in the game...

      Click.  Tommy hangs up and heads down the hall to Rachel and 
      Big Dave, who are being downloaded by Doctor Pete on the 
      Sheriff s situation...

                                  RACHEL
                    Is she coming?

                                  TOMMY
                    I left a message.

      Tommy takes a breath to calm himself, then to Doctor Pete...

                                  TOMMY (CONT D)
                    Tell me.

                                  DOCTOR PETE
                    It s the best of a bad situation.  
                    The fusion was a success, but the 
                    ligature wasn t salvageable.  So, 
                    regaining mobility will be a 
                      process... A long one...

                                  TOMMY
                    What about the MRI?                                                                                    56.


                                  DOCTOR PETE
                    It came up clean.  But, obviously, 
                    we re dealing with something.  I 
                    called in a neuropathologist from 
                    up St. Paul.  He s a friend.  
                    Hopefully he can help us get a 
                    better sense of what we re up 
                    against...

                                  TOMMY
                    Okay... That s... Thanks.  Truly.

      Doctor Pete heads off...  Tommy looks to Big Dave...

                                  TOMMY
                    You can take off, Dave.  I ll call 
                    you later...

                                  BIG DAVE
                    Yan t, moosh.  I told Molly to 
                    cover the shop today.  I m here 
                    with you, T.C..
                          (a beat, then)
                    Part of me feels responsible.  I 
                    saw him right before he... I didn t 
                    notice anything off... 

                                  TOMMY
                    Did he mention the name  Chloe ?

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    I don t think so.  Who s Chloe?

    But before Tommy can answer --

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    Tommy -- ?

      Tommy turns to see John Haplin...

                                  TOMMY
                    Hey, John.  How ya doing?

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    My mother wants to see you --

                                  TOMMY
                    Now?  I appreciate her reaching 
                    out, but my father just got off the 
                    operating table and--

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    Which means he has three hours 
                    before he wakes from sedation.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    57.

                                  JOHN HAPLIN (cont'd)
                    We ll have you back at his side by 
                    then and he ll never know you 
                    left...

      Tommy looks at Big Dave.  It is clear that when Peggy Haplin 
      calls for you, however bad the timing may be, you do not 
      argue...  Tommy turns to Rachel and Big Dave...

                                  TOMMY
                    Call me if anything changes...

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    Where are you going?

                                  TOMMY
                    To Weeping Wall.

    To which Rachel and Big Dave look startled... As Tommy 
      follows after John Haplin.  And we CUT TO:

      EXT.  DOWNTOWN, HAPLIN - DAY

      Henley walks past the various shops... PEOPLE are out on the 
      stroll... The town is dressed up for  Thaw Fest .  Henley 
      sees Miranda Kirby across the street, with her daughter, 
      JORDAN.  Jordan is on her knees, feeding their PUPPY the 
      crust from her slice of pizza... Miranda sees Henley and 
      waves...

      Henley walks on... Passing cheese shops and ice cream parlors 
      and a record store that actually sells vinyl...

      When she comes upon Merritt Grieves, standing in the doorway 
      of  THE HOUSE OF USHERS .  Which is clearly a MOVIE 
      MEMORABILIA SHOP, WHICH seems so out of place here, not only 
    in its wares, but in a sense of gloom that pervades it.

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    Absurdly cheery here, isn t it?

    If she is surprised to see him, she hides it.  In fact, we 
    are not sure if this meeting is happenstance or well-planned.

                                  HENLEY
                    Hello.

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    Come in.  Please --

      INT.   THE HOUSE OF USHERS  - DAY

      Henley is the only soul in sight as she enters this dusty 
      shrine to motion picture artifacts... On sale are weathered 
      MOVIE POSTERS, LOBBY CARDS, ACTOR HEAD SHOTS, etc.                                                                                      58.


    As she studies the antiquities, one might notice that they 
    are all from a distant past.  

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    I m so happy you found us...

                                  HENLEY
                    Business is slow?

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    With the prices of meat powder on 
                    the rise, the compulsion to buy 
                    remnants of cultural signposts from 
                    a flickering history is not high on 
                    the list of priorities in Haplin 
                    County.  But to an outsider...

      Thus begins a dance between these two, as Henley finishes 
      Merritt s thoughts, which are intoned with curiosity...

                                  HENLEY
                    ... from Snoqualmie, Washington.

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    Visiting for reasons related to...

                                  HENLEY
                    ... the passing of a loved one.

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    And looking to find...

                                  HENLEY
                    ... comfort in breathing new air.

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    And also to...

                                  HENLEY
                    Use my inheritance to open a candle 
                    shop... 

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    Paraffin or tallow?

                                  HENLEY
                    Soy wax.

      Merritt smiles.  Henley does, as well.  But that was weird.  
    To break the awkwardness, he extends his hand...

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES (CONT D)
                    Merritt Grieves.  Room 2B.                                                                                    59.


                                  HENLEY
                    Henley Boone.  2F.  
                          (a beat, then)
                    You ve got the ladies in the 
                    boarding house in quite a dither. 

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    Yes, well.  One of the burdens of 
                    being eternally... Dashing.

    He shrugs with a smile... She smiles back... Maybe he s not 
    so bad, after all.  Henley looks around...

                                  HENLEY
                    So, no offense... And really, what-
                      do-I-know-about-anything? - but 
                    we re in the middle of the tundra.  
                    And this place would struggle in 
                    Berkeley.  Did you really think 
                    this was the prime plot to peddle 
                      memorabilia that, unless I m 
                    missing something, uniformly 
                    predates the 1950s?

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES 
                    Are you calling me a doddy?

                                  HENLEY
                    No, sir.  In fact, I m not quite 
                    sure what a  doddy  is... But it 
                    sounds properly fusty and out-of-
                    time.  So, no, that is not what I m 
                    calling you... But only because I m 
                    too polite...

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES (CONT D)
                    Opening the minds of these fricky-
                    frack townsfolk to the wonders of 
                    early cinema.  If I can deliver one 
                    convert to the tick of time, then 
                    my investment will be well-placed.

      His hands graze over several weathered LOBBY CARDS...

                                    MERRITT GRIEVES (CONT D)
                    I remember the overwhelming 
                    sensation I received when my dear 
                    mother exposed me to the wonder of 
                    live action...

      He picks up a lobby card for a film called  THE BLUE DOOR .  
    In which the titular door, open a crack, stands like the 
      final bulwark between us and the darkness.  Contrasty black 
    and white inks make the image seem overtly confrontational...                                                                                    60.


                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    Called  The Blue Door .  Made in 
                    1923 by a young auteur from Berlin.  
                    This film, seen by few, revealed to 
                    me the secrets of the universe... 
                    The Blue Door was a gateway... A 
                    portal into the heart of man...

      Henley stands transfixed.  

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    There s dread everywhere.  Even in 
                    the sunniest plains.  But Haplin 
                    County has lived under the false 
                    comfort of their Sheriff, who was 
                    able to keep the dread at bay for 
                    the last run of years...

                                  HENLEY
                    The Magic Man.

      Grieves smiles crookedly...

                                    MERRITT GRIEVES
                    So the uninitiated has been 
                    slightly initiated...

                                  HENLEY
                    One hears things.  Why do they call 
                    him  The Magic Man ?

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    Because he had an ability.  To make 
                    the children disappear so 
                      completely.  That bordered on... 
                    The mystical.

      Merritt puts down the lobby card...

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    Six children.  Vanish.  Never to be 
                    heard from again.  The last one 
                    seven years ago.  So why did he 
                    stop?  Did he die?  Was he jailed 
                    for another offense?  Did he move 
                    away?  Did he tire of it?  Or did 
                    he slip, ever-so-quietly, back 
                    through The Blue Door?

      Both of them glance to the lobby card... To that infernal 
      blue door... The image at once banal and wicked...

                      END OF ACT SEVEN*                                                                                    61.


                          ACT EIGHT*

      INT.  SUV - MOVING - DAY

      Tommy rides alone in the back seat, John Haplin is shotgun.  
    A DRIVER behind the wheel.  They ride in silence for a bit. 
      Then:

                                  TOMMY
                    How s the family, John?

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    Andrew is doing well.  Grades are 
                    up.  For the first time in years...

                                  TOMMY
                    And Carol?

      Haplin looks at him... Shakes his head...

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    All these years later.  And she 
                    still waits in the window.  When 
                    she s not napping in Addy s room...

                                  TOMMY
                    I m sorry...

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    Which is why the banner is about so 
                    much more than just the banner.  
                    You re father and I disagreed 
                      vehemently.  But it was terrible to 
                    hear what happened to him last 
                    night --

                                  TOMMY
                    Thank you --

      Beat...

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    Was your father any closer to 
                    finding who killed Jerry Friddle 
                    before he... ?

      Tommy looks at him.  As he himself realizes that:

                                  TOMMY
                    I don t know.

      Haplin nods.  And they have arrived at the gates of --                                                                                    62.


      EXT.  WEEPING WALL - THE HAPLIN ESTATE - DAY

    A huge COLONIAL MANSION of lush foliage, terraces and 
      verandas, pools and fountains.  An 800-foot canoe lake, 9-
      hole golf course, tennis courts, six-stall stable.  

    The view is breath-taking, even with the trees bare... And 
    the sprawling property is center-punched, oddly, with the 30- 
      FOOT LONG, 20-FOOT HIGH SECTION OF 17TH CENTURY DRY-STONE 
      WALL, that gives the property its name...

    The SUV takes them past the residence and toward a free- 
      standing ICE RINK in the middle of the grounds...  

      Tommy can see the LONE FIGURE skating a precarious figure-8 
    in the center of the rink...  

    The SUV comes to a stop... Haplin turns to Tommy...

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    She d like to meet in private...

                                  TOMMY
                    I ll see ya, John.

      Tommy exits the vehicle and heads towards the skating rink.  
    The lone figure glides to the lip of the rink to greet him... 

      This is PEGGY HAPLIN, late-70s, the town matriarch.  Hers is 
    an august bearing, a leonine elegance both austere and 
      impenetrable, but still possessing a certainty and confidence 
      which belies her age and the tentative way she skates...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    Deputy Conroy.

                                  TOMMY
                    Mrs. Haplin.

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN (CONT D)
                    Let me get a look at you...

      She studies Tommy, who hates this kind of thing...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN (CONT D)
                    You are your mother s son, aren t 
                    you?

                                  TOMMY
                    That s what people say.                                                                                    63.


                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    It s high praise.  She had a strong 
                    composition.  And was one of the 
                    best we ever had at Weeping Wall...

                                  TOMMY
                    She liked working here.  Always 
                    came home with a smile...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN 
                    Her facility with perennials was 
                    uncanny.  The gardens have never 
                    been the same since we lost her... 

    We now see the dynamic unfolding:  Tommy is bred from the 
       downstairs  contingency of Haplin County that serves at the 
      will of Peggy Haplin s  upstairs  command...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN (CONT D)
                    And now, this with your father.  
                    It s heartbreaking...

                                  TOMMY
                    Yes, ma am.  It is... Unexpected.

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    And ill-timed.  With the incident 
                    at the pond...

    She looks at him... Tommy nods... 

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    Walk with me... 

    And he climbs under the fence-post... And walks with Peggy 
      Haplin, while she slowly skates...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    You still play hockey?

                                  TOMMY
                    Not so much anymore.  Big Dave and 
                    I go down to the rink once in a 
                    while and slap a bag of pucks... 

      Peggy Haplin nods... Skates on... 

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN (CONT D)
                    The good work your father has done 
                    for this county - for me -  during 
                    his tenure... It s needed now more 
                    than ever...                                                                                      64.


                                  TOMMY
                    Roger Hobbs is a pretty capable 
                    guy.  He was a cop in the Twin 
                    Cities before he came to Haplin...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    Roger Hobbs mooches the stem.  He 
                    couldn t solve the mystery of the 
                    cheese sandwich if you showed him 
                    the pumpernickel and the provolone.

      And this is said with a savage bitterness... Tommy looks at 
      her... Peggy Haplin gathers herself... Smiles sweetly for:

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    Which is why, until Griffin gets 
                    his right back:  I would like you 
                    to take over as Acting Sheriff of 
                    Haplin County...

    And Tommy couldn t look more surprised --

                                  TOMMY
                    Me?

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    I m effecting you as of this 
                      discussion...

    And she executes a little butterfly spin... 

                                  TOMMY
                    With all due respect, Mrs. Haplin: 
                    I m just a four-year Deputy.  And 
                    I m certainly not my father...

      Tommy searches for a way to get out of this...

                                  TOMMY
                    And there s a a chain of command.  
                    Hobbs is Chief Deputy and-- 

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    Roger Hobbs mooches the stem --

                                  TOMMY
                    I don t know what that means!

      Stated a little more forcefully than one speaks to the grand 
      lady... She merely smiles...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    It means:  I think you ll be great.                                                                                    65.


                                  TOMMY
                    What about John?  Your son is not a 
                    big fan of my father.  I don t see 
                    him sitting easy with another 
                    Conroy being perched...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    My son is an obsessive.  And though 
                    I share his agony over the 
                      disappearance of my granddaughter, 
                    his choice to fixate on The Magic 
                    Man has not only hurt the spirit of 
                    this community, it has rendered him 
                    an irrelevance.  Particularly at 
                    this moment of crossroad...

      Tommy clenches.  He can only speak the truth...

                                  TOMMY
                    I think you re making a mistake 
                    here...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    And I think you can shift in your 
                    shoes all afternoon, young man.  
                    But I m an old lady accustomed to 
                    standing in the cold.  So I would 
                    suggest you do like your daddy did, 
                    and remind yourself whose founding 
                    capital pays for the apricots in 
                    your little girl s lunch pail...  

    She is not to be trifled with.  And Tommy gets it.  At last, 
    he nods... She eases.  Comforted by the victory...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN (CONT D)
                    Good Luck.  Sheriff.

      With that, she skates off... Tommy watches Peggy Haplin 
      resume her figure-8s, thinking back to a mere two days ago.  
      When life was vastly simpler...

                       END OF ACT EIGHT*



                      

                                                                                                        66.


                        ACT NINE*

      INT.  CAFETERIA - HAPLIN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      It s late.  But a few sad souls hold vigil for loved ones, 
      trying to find distraction at the bottom of bowls and cups.

      We find Georgia, seated alone at the counter with a take-out 
      cup of coffee.  She pours from her cream dispenser, only to 
      find it empty... 

      She turns to the MAN, several stools down... He is early 30s, 
      with a toothy, clean-cut wholesomeness.  We ll call him 
      HANDSOME SAM...

                                    GEORGIA
                    Can I borrow your creamer?

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    Of course.

      He hands it to her... She pours cream into her coffee...

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    You got someone upstairs?

                                    GEORGIA
                    Yeah.  Sadly.

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    Family or friend?

                                    GEORGIA
                    Family.  Kind of.   The grandpa I 
                    never had  sorta thing...

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    Is he going to be okay?

                                    GEORGIA
                    No one can say...

      There is something about Handsome Sam, whoever he is, that 
      puts Georgia at ease... He is warm and friendly...

                                    GEORGIA (CONT D)
                    How about you?  Who are you here 
                    for?

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    Me?  No one.  I just come for the 
                      tapioca...

      Georgia grins... Sips her coffee...                                                                                     67.


                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    I m a firm believer that all of 
                    society s ills could be quelled if 
                    everyone was just given some 
                    pudding...

                                  GEORGIA
                    Wouldn t that be nice?

      Georgia finishes her coffee and rises... 

                                  GEORGIA
                    So long...

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    Your sorta-grandpa will be in my 
                      thoughts...

                                  GEORGIA
                    And your tapioca will be in mine.

    As Georgia heads off, we STAY with Handsome Sam.  As he 
      watches her go.  His expression is neutral.  It shouldn t be 
    a cause for concern. But, somehow, it is.

      INT.  PATIENT ROOM - HAPLIN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      Georgia stands over Sheriff Conroy, who remains sedated, his 
      reattached hand bandaged... She speaks to him, gently...

                                  GEORGIA
                    It s a shame you re going to miss 
                    The Thaw Fest.  I know how much you 
                    love it. *

    She pours him a cup of water from a pitcher on his side  *
      table...  *

                                  GEORGIA*
                    I m hoping my dad doesn t show up.   *
                    Remember what happened last year? *

      Pours herself a glass.  Takes a sip... *

                                  GEORGIA*
                    Get better soon, huh?  You re the  *
                    only one who I can do the Sunday 
                    crossword puzzle with in ink...

    She leans in and kisses him on the forehead, taking a moment 
    to regard this man who represents uncommon kindness in her 
      otherwise cruel world...

    But then, something happens.  She HEARS Sheriff Conroy SPEAK:                                                                                    68.


                                  SHERIFF CONROY (O.S.)
                    In my younger days, I felt sorry 
                    for myself that I had no gloves...  

      Only his mouth hasn t moved.  And his eyes remain closed...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY (O.S.)
                    Until I met a man with no hands.

      Georgia is entirely freaked, but all she can muster is a --

                                  GEORGIA (CONT D)
                    Hello?

    She waves her hand over Sheriff Conroy s face... And, in that 
      moment, the whole room becomes inexplicably wobbly... She 
      looks at her empty coffee cup...

      Was Georgia just hearing things?  She steps back, almost 
      loses her footing.  She steadies herself, turning out to --

      INT.  HALLWAY - HAPLIN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      Georgia walks down the long hallway which, at once, appears 
      to ripple, as if she is looking at it through heat waves..

      The ground beneath her unsure, she makes her way to the 
      ELEVATOR BANK... She drops her coffee cup, and presses the 
      DOWN BUTTON, catching, out of the corner of her eye --

      Handsome Sam.  Walking toward her.  With a steady, precise 
      stride.  Again, he is doing nothing to engender fear...

    But she fears him.  And she cannot speak.  It s as if she s 
      been drugged.  Or is in the throes of a seizure...

                                    GEORGIA
                    Don t...*

      The elevator door opens... Georgia sloppily slips inside... 
      Searches for the LOBBY BUTTON... Finds it... Presses it... 
      Her heart races... The doors begin to close... She is almost 
      safe... Almost alone, when...

    A HAND is thrust through closing doors... They part... And 
      Handsome Sam slithers into the elevator...

      INT.  ELEVATOR - HAPLIN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      Trapped, Georgia s world continues to shift... Elongate and 
        constrict... Handsome Sam just stares at her... Never saying 
    a word...  Again, she tries to communicate with him:                                                                                    69.


                                  GEORGIA
                    Did you... Put something... In my..

    Her vocal chords betray her, but she is able to get out one 
      final word... 

                                  GEORGIA (CONT D)
                    ... milk?

    He does not respond.  In fact, he s gone.

    She looks around the small elevator.  But of course he s not 
      there... 

      Georgia s eyes tick to the illuminated FLOOR NUMBERS.  
      Watching them descend...  

    And then Handsom Sam is back.  He looks at her.  And, even 
      though his mouth doesn t move, she/we HEAR:

                                  HANDSOME SAM (O.S.)
                    It was cream, you silly bitch.

      She stares at him... He looks back... His face becoming oddly 
      fimbriated.  As if were made of water colors... But then --

      DING!  The doors open... Georgia pours out into...

      INT.  LOBBY - HAPLIN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

    It is empty.  Georgia s feet echo as she wills herself to the 
      exit... Toward some sense of freedom...

    But with each jagged, desperate step she takes, she is more 
      unsteady... Her feet betraying her...

    At last, she bursts through the glass doors --

      EXT.  HAPLIN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      Into the cool night air... But again, the ground is buckling, 
      canting, as if her entire vestibular system has shut-down...

    She turns... To look back into the hospital lobby... She can 
    see Handsome Sam... Still in the elevator... Keeping the door 
      from closing... Watching her... And she HEARS:

                                  HANDSOME SAM (SINGING;  O.S.)
                     I had some dreams/They were clouds 
                    in my coffee/Clouds in my coffee.. 

      Yep.  Carly Simon.  Georgia trips up... She sifts to the 
      ground... With nary a sound...                                                                                     70.


    It is only then that Handsome Sam exits the elevator... He 
      moves towards her... With those signature steady steps...

    He stands over her... Observes her... She looks up at him... 
    At his kind face... Those concerned eyes... Those unmoving 
      lips, which don t explain why she HEARS:

                                  HANDSOME SAM (SINGING;  O.S.)
                     You re so vain/You probably think 
                    this song is about you...  

    And Georgia gets to her feet.  And she runs.  Fast.  Away 
      from him.  As fast as she can possibly go... And as she does, 
      everything seems to waver... Not FADING... But DRIFTING --

    TO BLACK

      Over which, hyperkinetic, OVERLAPPING VOICES shuffle and 
      twist their way into our aural passage... Volume and pitch 
      fluctuate... Handsome Sam s singing, discordant and off-key, 
      CROSS-FADES, as we SNAP OUT OF BLACK to --

    AN OLD-SCHOOL TURNTABLE.  

    A vinyl record spinning on it.  Playing the actual Carly

      INT.  STIVILETTO HOUSE - NIGHT

      Ronald and Lincoln are having a heated argument... 

                                  LINCOLN STIVILETTO
                    You re wrong, man.  It s  you had 
                    one eye in the mirror, as you 
                    watched yourself  GO BY ...  

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    No.  It s  you had one eye in the 
                    mirror, as you watched yourself 
                     GAVOTTE ...  

      Georgia is sprawled across the filthy shag rug... Dazed... 
      Unnoticed by the brothers, as they continue their tiff...

                                  LINCOLN STIVILETTO
                    What the hell is  gavotte ?

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    It s a French thing.  A dance.  The 
                    guy, the vain guy, was dancing... 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    71.

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO (cont'd)
                    He was watching himself, in the 
                    mirror, as he danced...

    And Ronald goes to the turntable... Starts the record from 
    the beginning... They rock in time to the MUSIC...

                                  CARLY SIMON 
                     You walked into the party/Like you 
                    were walking onto a yacht/Your hat 
                      strategically dipped below one eye/ 
                    Your scarf it was apricot...   

    And Womper has noticed --

                                  WOMPER STIVILETTO
                    I think she s awake -- !

    He peers down at her... But Lincoln and Ronald can t be 
      bothered right now... Focused on the MUSIC...

                                  CARLY SIMON 
                     You had one eye on the mirror as 
                    you watched yourself --  

              LINCOLN STIVILETTORONALD STIVILETTO
    GO BY!GAVOTTE!

      Georgia tries to get to her feet.  Both brothers turn to her -

                                  LINCOLN STIVILETTO / RONALD STIVILLETO
                     And all the girls dreamed/That 
                    they d be your partner/They d be 
                    your partner and...  

    As the light in the room seems to waver... From WHITE to 
      MAGENTA to COLD BLUE...  And the Stiviletto Boys themselves 
    are appear to unravel.  Their faces elongate and constrict... 

                                  GEORGIA
                    What am I doing here?

    The Stiviletto Boys laugh... Georgia sobs in abject terror... 

                                  GEORGIA
                    I want... To go... Home.

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    Don t you wanna say  hi  to Baby 
                    Boy first?

                                  LINCOLN STIVILETTO
                    He s been sweet on you since you 
                    was the only one come to his 14th 
                    birthday party.  When you was six.                                                                                    72.


                                  WOMPER STIVILETTO
                    You brought him a rhino.  A stuffed 
                    rhino...

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    And then you flew your Lear Jet up 
                    to Nova Scotia to see the total 
                    eclipse of the sun...

      Before Georgia can answer, Baby Boy bounces into the room.  
    He gently waves at Georgia, all smiles: 

                                  BABY BOY STIVILETTO
                    Hi, Georgia.  Are you okay?  Do you 
                    want some tapioca?

    As the Carly Simon grows LOUDER... Georgia runs for the front 
      door.  Rips it open.  Spilling out to the tattered lawn.

      EXT.  STIVILETTO HOUSE - NIGHT

      Actually, it s dawn.  The night has passed.  Georgia looks 
      out, to the dump, in the distance, lit by a pale, amber glow.

      Georgia gets slowly to her feet... And she begins to run... 
    Not quite sure where she is going... She looks behind her... 
      Because the Stiviletto Boys are giving chase... 

    Her heart THUMPS.  As she runs.  Toward the dump.  Turbid and 
      confused.  As they follow.  Laughing...

      Georgia comes to a stop.  At the edge of the dump.  Staring 
      out... She looks behind her.  But The Stiviletto Brothers are 
    no longer about... She looks back to the dump --

    Her face is lucent with the shimmering flicker of a debased 
      light... And then we see what she sees --

      Like something out of a Flemish painting.  Beyond the dump is 
    A VALLEY of great breadth and depth, a nameless gloom, with 
      globes of black and red FLAMES rising out of the stinking 
      pit...

    We can hear rustling CRIES.  Like souls undergoing torment.  
    We can smell the smoke... And, in the distance, there are 
      opal towers and sapphire battlements...

    And the awful firelight dances, a twisting, guttering pyre.

    And Georgia SCREAMS.*

      INT.  HAPLIN SHERIFF S OFFICE - DAY

      In their version of a muster room, Roger Hobbs updates the 
      morning roll call:  a dozen or so COPS, including Kelvin 
      Tolliver, Root Beer Rogers, and Shell Jenkins...

                                  ROGER HOBBS
                    Our only clue (as we have not been 
                    able to rustle-up any eye 
                      witnesses, although we ve canvassed  
                      practically the whole town) is a 
                    powder that was found on the 
                    victim.  It appears to be some type 
                    of baking flour, and it s been sent 
                    off to the State Lab for further 
                      analysis...

      Roger Hobbs  face turns sour... A few follow his gaze... To 
      where Tommy has entered...  And for the first time in our 
      tale, Tommy is wearing his UNIFORM.  The crisp, pressed 
      khakis remind us of his newfound stature...

      There is a tick of awkward silence... Until:

                                  KELVIN TOLLIVER
                    How s Griff, T.C.?

                                  TOMMY
                    He s resting.  

      Eyes dart around the room... Many land on Hobbs, sensing a 
      confrontation.  And Hobbs delivers: 

                                  ROGER HOBBS
                    So, what s the next move then on 
                    the Friddle case?  Sheriff?

      Tommy looks at him.  At the others.  Then:

                                  TOMMY
                    Business as usual.  You re still 
                    running lead on the case.  You call 
                    the shots...

      Hobbs wasn t expecting this.  Tommy nods to all of them.  And 
      leaves the muster room.

      INT.  HENLEY S ROOM - MANNING BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

      Henley sits at a desk, writing in a journal.  When there is a 
      knock on the door.  She opens it.  But there is no one there.                                                                                    74.


    But a PLASTIC BAG hangs from the doorknob.  She opens it.  
      Inside is a DVD.  Of a film.  We recognize the poster art 
      from the lobby card:   THE BLUE DOOR .

      Henley smiles to herself.  Looks down the hallway.  No one 
      there.  She goes back into her room...

      INT.  HOSPITAL - SHERIFF CONROY S ROOM - DAY

      Tommy sits by his father s bedside... The room is crowded 
      with flower arrangement... Despite the fact that Griffin 
      Conroy is asleep, Tommy talks to him:

                                  TOMMY
                    Part of me... I ll tell ya... Part 
                    of me thinks she just wants a 
                    puppet.  Not that you were a 
                    puppet.  But you insisted on 
                    letting sleeping dogs lie.  Which 
                    is what Mrs. Haplin wants.  With 
                    me... 

    And he picks up his father s SHERIFF STAR, which is on the  *
      side table... Tommy turns it over in his hand... *

                                  TOMMY*
                    I think she s of the mind that even 
                    if I wanted to wake up those 
                    sleeping dogs, I m too much of a 
                    nincompoop to do it!  

    He smiles to himself... Puts the star back down on the table. *

                                  TOMMY
                    And she s probably right...

      Tommy goes to a flower arrangement  Looks at the card.  When -

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    He ll be back.  

      Tommy turns... The Sheriff, eyes still closed, is muttering:

                                  TOMMY
                    Pop?

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Now that blood s been spilled 
                    again.  He ll be back... 

      Tommy goes to his father s bedside...

                                  TOMMY
                    What?  Who?                                                                                    75.


      Eyes still closed, Sheriff Conroy continues his maundering:

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    The serpent always hisses where the 
                    sweet bird sings, Chloe...  

      And, just as quickly as he roused, Sheriff Conroy settles 
      back into his torpor... 

                                  TOMMY
                    Pop -- ?

    But then Tommy s cell-phone RINGS.  It s Rachel.  CROSS-CUT 
    AS NECESSARY...

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    You need to come home.  Right now.

      Tommy looks at his father s slumbering form...

                                  TOMMY
                    What is it?

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                      Something s happened.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      GEORGIA

      Sitting on the couch.  Dirty.  Disheveled.  A SCRAPE on her 
      face.  Clothes torn and muddy, she is wrapped in a blanket...

      INT.  CONROY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

      Tommy paces, listening to the tail end of Georgia s ordeal.  
      Rage boils inside him, though he s doing his best to keep it 
      all under control...

                                    GEORGIA
                    ... and I just ran and ran and ran.  
                    I don t even know if they were 
                    chasing me at that point.  I don t 
                    know if they were ever chasing me 
                    at all...

                                  RACHEL CONROY*
                    Her eyes were dilated when she got  *
                    here.  The Stivilettos must have  *
                    drugged her --*

      Tommy looks out the window.  To where Emma plays in the  *
        backyard...*                                                                                    76.


                                  GEORGIA*
                    No, that doesn t make sense...  *
                    Because I was... It was before-- *

      Tommy, anger building, interrupts --  *

                                  TOMMY
                    Did they hurt you?

                                  GEORGIA
                    I don t--

                                  TOMMY
                    DID THEY HURT YOU, GEORGIA??

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    Tommy, for God s sake -- !

      Tears spill from Georgia s eyes... Rachel gathers Georgia in 
    her arms... Rachel looks furious...

      Tommy charges from the house.

      EXT.  STIVILETTO COMPOUND - FRONT GATE - DAY

      Root Beer Rogers waits here, as Tommy slams his Welly to a 
      stop and bursts from the car... 

                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    Got your message.  What s up, boss?  
                    We making an arrest?

                                  TOMMY
                    No.  Not an arrest.

    And Tommy hands Root Beer his badge.  And his gun.

                                  TOMMY
                    Not an arrest...

    And before Root Beer can even ask --

      INT.  STIVILETTO HOME - DAY

    The FRONT DOOR CRASHES IN, splintering the door jambs, as 
      Tommy charges in --  

      Lincoln is the first one he sees... And he grabs two fistfuls 
    of Lincoln s collars and hurls him into a wall...

      Womper is there... Tommy turns and punches the fat man in the 
      mouth, liberating a couple of infected incisors from the 
      stank-filled orifice they previously resided in...                                                                                    77.


                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    What the hell are you doing, 
                    Conroy?  You best have a warrant 
                    you stupid sonuva--

    But Tommy whips a CHAIR at Ronald s head...  Lincoln has 
      found his feet... And he dives on Tommy... Bringing him to 
    the floor... Ronald jumps in...

    And the brawl is on:  plates and glasses smash.  Bodies 
      lollop around the kitchen.  Blows are exchanged...

      Tommy s fury comes as a great surprise to us.  As does his 
      ability to bring the thunder:*

      Tommy drops Lincoln with a whiplash-inducing uppercut, and 
      pins Ronald by his throat to a cracked kitchen cabinet...  

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    I told you:  we didn t do nothin .  

                                  TOMMY
                    You drugged her.  A 17-year-old...

      Suddenly Ronald gets it.  This is about Georgia.  

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    The Bravin girl?  We found her on 
                    our living room floor. Anyone 
                    should be pissed, it s us!  She 
                    broke into the damn house -- !

      Tommy cocks his fist --  

                                  TOMMY
                    You re lying -- 

    And Tommy is about to throw the punch, when Root Beer Rogers 
      bursts in, waving his cell-phone... He is momentarily stunned 
    at the tableau before him... But he hands Tommy his cell... 

                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    It s the State Lab --*

                    Hey, there.  This is Murtaugh at 
                    the State Lab?  We got the organics 
                    back on the substance covering your 
                    homicide?                                                                                    78.


                                  TOMMY
                    This really isn t a good time...

      Because Womper and Lincoln are getting to their wobbly feet.

                                  M.E. MURTAUGH
                    It most definitely is flour.  But 
                    it didn t come from your factory.  
                    It s a special kind that contains, 
                    get this, a fluoride found only in 
                    New York City tap water, which was 
                    mixed into the dough.  What do you 
                    make of that?  Figure your guy got 
                    gooned by a pastry chef on vacation 
                    from Coney Island?

      Murtaugh laughs at his own joke... But Tommy is not amused... 
      Especially when he see it -- 

      Laying on the floor by the door is A PIZZA BOX.  An oversized 
      pizza box... A pizza box able to hold a 26  pie... It s lid 
      slightly agape, as if quietly scolding him.

    And everything suddenly clicks for him.  A moment of quiet 
      washes over Tommy.  Tommy hands Root Beer the phone...  And 
    he walks toward the splintered front door --

                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    What s up, T.C.?

      Tommy looks back at Root Beer, at the brothers, at the 
      tumult... Tommy looks utterly enervated...

                                  TOMMY
                    It s like the man says:  the 
                    serpent always hisses where the 
                    sweet bird sings...

    And he walks out... Leaving Root Beer with the ravening 
      Stiviletto brood... As the sound of a DOOR KNOCK takes us to:

      INT./EXT.  RANCH HOUSE - PORCH/FOYER - DUSK

      Long shadows stretch across this well-kept lawn... A woman, 
      DORIS, old and rimpled, answers her front door, her face 
      immediately brightening when she sees Tommy...  

                                  DORIS
                    Tommy -- !

                                  TOMMY
                    Hey, there... He home?                                                                                    79.


                                  DORIS
                    No.  I expect him soon for supper, 
                    though... 

                                  TOMMY
                    No worries.  I just wanted to grab 
                    my drill gun... I can come back... *

                                  DORIS
                    Don t be silly... It s in the 
                      basement... You know the way...

    And as Doris lets Tommy in, we can see, by the expression on 
    his face, that this is exactly what he wanted.

      INT.  BASEMENT - RANCH HOUSE - DAY

      Tommy comes down an creaky wooden staircase and begins poking 
      around.  He rummages through various items on the workbench, 
    not sure what he s looking for.  

      Storage boxes on the far side of the room catch his 
      attention... More specifically, DUST TRACKS leading to 
      them... As if they ve recently been moved... 

      Tommy pulls the boxes from the wall and, in short order, he 
      finds a HIDDEN DOOR (one made to look like just another part 
    of the wall).  Cautiously, Tommy opens the door and enters...

      INT.  HIDDEN ROOM - BASEMENT - RANCH HOUSE - DAY

      Tommy pulls the draw string on a hanging light bulb.  The 
      room illuminates.  Dark corners.  Tommy s eyes land on 
      something.  His face falls.  Fear.  Disappointment.  Rage.  
      Sadness.  All wash over him...

    We see what s given him such pause:  the facing walls are  *
      covered with NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, PHOTOS, NOTATED MAPS, HAND-
      SCRAWLED REMINDERS, and TORN PAGES from JOURNAL ENTRIES.   *

    And all these keepsakes on display form a reliquary;  a 
      veritable shrine.  To The Magic Man.  

      Tommy is in shock.  When, from behind him:  

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    You weren t supposed to see this.

      Tommy turns.  Standing in the shadows, menace in his eyes -- *

    Is Big Dave.


                                END OF ACT TEN   *                                                                                    80.

      INT.  BIG DAVE DUNCAN S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

      To resume.  Tommy stands there... Facing Big Dave...

                                  TOMMY
                    I had no idea...

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    I know.  No one did.  

      Tommy looks at him...

                                  TOMMY
                    No, Dave.  I had no idea that 
                    you ve been obsessed with this...

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    Why is that important?  What s 
                    important is that I solved it.  I 
                    solved it and I saw that justice 
                    was served...

      Tommy shakes his head...

                                  TOMMY
                    Jerry Friddle was not The Magic 
                    Man...

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    Of course he was.  I ve been 
                    working on this for two years now, 
                    T.C.  Surveilling.  Gathering 
                    evidence.  Making my case...

                                  TOMMY
                     Making your case ?  Who the hell 
                    are you to  make your case ?  You 
                    make pizzas...

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    I got rock-solid evidence.

                                  TOMMY
                    You got nothing.  

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    That s not true.  I been shadowing 
                    Friddle for the last few weeks.  
                    And he was following little Gwen 
                    Simpson.  All over the place.  And 
                    she s only nine...                                                                                      81.


                                  TOMMY
                    You know why he was doing that?  
                    Because he had a thing for Leah 
                    Simpson.  Gwen s mother.  She filed  
                    a bunch of complaints over the last  
                    year or so.  Friddle skulked women, 
                    Dave.  Not kids...

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    You re wrong.

                                  TOMMY
                    Don t you think my father ran down 
                    Jerry Friddle eight ways to 
                    Tuesday, back when he had that 
                    trouble at the library?  And then 
                    did it again when he was found in 
                    Raymond Manning s ice shack with a 
                    hole in is head?

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    Things were overlooked --

      Tommy looks at him for a long beat... Then:

                                  TOMMY
                    Jerry Friddle was in Las Vegas for 
                    a family reunion when Billy Mixon 
                    disappeared.  

    The fury begins to bubble in Tommy:

                                  TOMMY
                    And he was in the hospital with 
                    gall stones when Lauryn Ward 
                    vanished!  But you!  You stupid, 
                    fat moron.  You just killed an 
                    innocent man based on half-baked 
                      conclusions after doing some junior-
                    varsity detective work?  Who the 
                    hell are you?  Who the hell are you 
                    to even get involved -- ?  

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    No one else was doing it... Even 
                    Haplin and them had given up --

                                  TOMMY
                    Okay.  So supposing you re right.  
                    Supposing Friddle was The Magic 
                    Man.  Then you just killed the only 
                    person who knows what happened to 
                    those kids...                                                                                     82.


    Big Dave smiles... 

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    He told me where the bodies are --

                                  TOMMY
                    What?

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    He did.  Friddle.  He told me where 
                    the bodies are...

      When, from upstairs:

                                  MRS. DUNCAN (O.S.)
                    DAVID?  EVERYTHING OKAY DOWN THERE?

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    EVERYTHING S FINE, MA... ME AND 
                    TOMMY JUST HAVING A GAB --

                                  MRS. DUNCAN (O.S.)
                    TOM WANT TO STAY FOR DINNER?  

      Beat... Big Dave looks at Tommy, like:  you gotta answer her.

                                  TOMMY
                    I M FINE, MRS. D.

                                  MRS. DUNCAN
                    YOU SURE?  MEAT PASTIES AND A 
                    SPAGHETTI HOTDISH --

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    HE S OKAY, MA -- !

      Once they hear her walk away:

                                  TOMMY
                    He told you where the bodies were?

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    In Wisconsin.  In a landfill.  Just 
                    outside of Solon Springs...

                                  TOMMY
                    He told you that?  Jerry Friddle?

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    He did... So you see -- ?

                                  TOMMY
                    Did you have a gun pointed at his 
                    head at the time he told you, Dave?                                                                                      83.


                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    Yeah.  So?

                                  TOMMY
                    Maybe he was under duress?  Maybe 
                    he was thinking if he told you 
                    anything, it would get him out of 
                    that shack?

    And we see this land on Big Dave... He processes it... But 
      then rejects it... Shakes his head...

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    That s not what happened...

      Disgust washes across Tommy s face...

                                  TOMMY
                    You idiot.  You stupid, pathetic 
                    idiot...

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    He was taking kids...

                                  TOMMY
                    HE WAS TAKING NOTHING!!

    And Tommy lashes out, smacking Big Dave across the face with 
    a closed fist... Blood leaks from Big Dave s nose...

    Big Dave doesn t retaliate... He just looks at his friend...

                                  TOMMY
                    What are we supposed to do now?  
                    Huh, Dave?  What am I supposed to 
                    do now?

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    You do your job.  You caught me.  
                    So we tell everyone what I did.  
                    And why I did it...

                                  TOMMY
                    No, we don t, Big Dave.  If we do - 
                    you go to jail forever.  Because 
                    Jerry Friddle wasn t The Magic Man.

                                  BIG DAVE DUNCAN
                    He told me where the bodies were.

      Tommy picks up a wrench off the work bench...                                                                                    84.


                                  TOMMY
                    You say that one more time I m 
                    gonna bury this in your head --

    As they look at each other... 

                                  TOMMY
                    Okay.  We gotta figure something 
                    out.  We just need some time... To 
                    figure something out --

    And the trouble they are in hangs there like a noose.  As 
      we ll PRE-LAP a CHILDREN S CHORUS rendition of Chicago s 
       SATURDAY IN THE PARK  and CUT TO: 

      EXT.   THAW FEST  - TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

      Town Square is all dressed-up for festival.  Beneath the 
       Remember To Never Forget  banner.  As it flies, high over 
      The Thaw Fest, just getting underway...

      The whole community has turned out.  

      The booths are thriving.  The farrago swirl of candied apples 
      and corn dogs and cotton candy freight the air... There are 
      FORTUNE TELLERS, JUGGLERS, MAGICIANS, etc.

      Calliope keens wrestle with the squeals of joyful children in 
    a scrum of pure Americana... The carousel glistens... The 
      Sunday CLOWNS make animal balloons...

      It is the NINTH GRADE GLEE CLUB, on the riser, singing 
       SATURDAY IN THE PARK  ( Can you dig it - yes, I can/And I ve 
      been waiting such a long time/For Saturday...  )...

      Henley walks through the festivities... Looking, all the 
      world, like a lost child... When, at once, there is Miranda 
      Kirby, her daughter, JORDAN, 9 and adorable and holding a 
      stuffed walrus  --

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    Henley!  This is my Jordan.  And 
                    this her walrus, Wally.  Jords, 
                    this is Henley, who I told you 
                    about... The real guitar hero.

                                  HENLEY
                          (to Jordan)
                    Hello --

                                  JORDAN KIRBY
                    Hi...                                                                                    85.


                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    Your first  Thaw Fest !  Are you 
                    having fun?

                                  HENLEY
                    It s great...

      Miranda is subsumed by the LADIES from the Garden Club... 
      Henley wanders away... To where Dot Manning and The Widows 
    are laying waste to the fried dough stand...Henley clocks the 
    lot of them, suitably preoccupied...

    Her time to go.  She starts to leave --

      EXT.  TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

      Tommy and Big Dave pull up in the Welly... They climb from 
    the car... Tommy clocks the banner... Hanging high... His 
      scowl is apparent... He turns to Big Dave and barks:

                                  TOMMY
                    Stay close.  And let s just act  *
                    normal until we can figure this  *
                    out...*

    As Tommy enters the  Thaw Fest , he and Henley cross... There 
    is a look, a moment, albeit a brief one...  But then his 
      attention is drawn to --

    THE DUNK-A-DIMWIT

    The Stiviletto Brothers  contribution to all of this... Baby 
    Boy sits in the tank... Ronald, Womper, Lincoln hawking 
       three tries for a buck ...

      Tommy and Ronald share a dark glance... But before things can 
    get urgent:

                                  RACHEL CONROY (O.S.)
                    Where have you been?

      Tommy turns to his wife... 

                                  TOMMY
                    Just... All of a sudden... Stuff.

      Rachel kisses him...

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    Happy  Thaw Fest , T.C...

    He nods... Clearly mad-distracted...                                                                                    86.


                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    Your father is going to be fine...

                                  TOMMY
                    I know.

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    Remember how, when we were kids, we 
                    used to hide from him every  Thaw 
                    Fest ?

      Tommy nods... She looks at him... He is clearly upset... She 
      touches his face... 

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    You okay, baby?

    He nods.  His eyes say otherwise.  She attempts to cheer him:

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    Starting to warm-up.  Maybe you 
                    will get the  Dallas Alice  in the 
                    water after all...

                                  TOMMY
                    Where s Emma C.?

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                      Stockpiling goldfish...

      She gestures... To a booth... Where you throw a ring-toss and 
      win goldfish... Emma is tossing, Georgia with her...

                                  TOMMY
                    Keep an eye...

      And he walks away... And Rachel frowns after him...

      GEORGIA

      cheerleads Emma s tosses...

                                    GEORGIA
                    You go, Li l Bean.  You da man.

      When Andrew Haplin appears... To Emma:

                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    It s all in the wrist, Em.  All in 
                    the wrist...

      Emma blushes... Clearly this older, cute boy has an effect.  
      Even on a 9-year-old...                                                                                    87.


                                  EMMA CONROY
                    Okay...

      Andrew notices the scrape on Georgia s face.  This 
      conversation is hushed, out of Emma s ear-shot and without 
      looking at each other, so to a casual observer they are 
      merely standing near each other --

                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    What happened?

                                  GEORGIA
                    It s nothing.

                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    Did your father do that?

    She considers what exactly to tell him.  Then:

                                  GEORGIA
                    Yeah.  He was on a real bender last 
                    night...

                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    I m gonna kill that guy, I swear...

                                  GEORGIA
                    It ll be fine, it ll be fine.

    But maybe it won t be.  Especially as we see --

      TOMMY

    On the other side of the park, keeping the peek on the 
      Stiviletto Brothers... When --

      HANDSOME SAM

    is at his side...

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    Sheriff Conroy?

    And Tommy is clearly not comfortable with this title...

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    Sam Dunning.  I work with Captain 
                    Frost.  State Police.  And I am 
                    here to help...

                                  TOMMY
                    You work with Frost?                                                                                    88.


                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    I do.  And I am here to help.

                                  TOMMY
                    Surprised the Captain hasn t paid 
                    us a visit himself.  Back in the 
                    day, he was a major presence...

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    He sent me.  And I am here to help.

                                  TOMMY
                    You said that...

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    How s your father?

                                  TOMMY
                    At this point:  we don t know...

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    I am here as a resource.  We will 
                    get to the bottom of this.  Not 
                    here to step on toes.  Most of all 
                    not yours.  But we will find this 
                    guy.  A homicide.  We don t get a 
                    lot of them.  When we do... We are 
                      snap-sharp...

      Tommy looks at him... 

                                  TOMMY
                      Snap-sharp.

      Handsome Sam nods...

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                      Snap-sharp.

    We can see Tommy isn t happy with the appearance of this man, 
      seeing as how his best friend is the culprit.  And we aren t 
      quite sure what this man s involvement was in Georgia s 
      nightmare at the hospital...

                                  END OF ACT ELEVEN*






                                                                                       89.



                             ACT TWELVE*

      EXT.   THAW FEST  - TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

      To resume.  There is the SQUEAL of FEEDBACK, and --

      PEGGY HAPLIN 

      is on the stage... At the mike, John Haplin behind her:

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN (AMPLIFIED)
                    Hello.  Hello, everyone.  I am 
                    going to make this brief... So 
                    everyone can get back to the 
                    business at hand:  which is having 
                    a ball at, believe it or not, the 
                    53rd Annual Haplin County  Thaw 
                    Fest !

      There is a burst of applause and cheers... Womper Stiviletto 
      two-finger whistles...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN (AMPLIFIED)
                    I remember my Daddy taking me to  -
                    and now I m giving away information 
                    I shouldn t - the very first  Thaw 
                    Fest ...
                          (laughter)
                    And I won a stuffed walrus.  I 
                    still have that stuffed walrus.  
                    Although he hasn t aged as well as 
                    I have... !

      There is more laughter... Doctor Pete sidles up to Tommy:

                                  DOCTOR PETE
                    Think she mentions the murder?

                                  TOMMY
                    Not a chance...

      When Ronald Stiviletto walks by:

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    Hey, Tommy!  Wanna give it a go?  
                    Three tries for a buck?  Proceeds 
                    go to Baby Boy s college education!

      He s holding three softballs... Womper and Lincoln hoot and 
      holler from beside  Dunk-A-Dimwit ...

      Tommy turns away from them... He looks up to where Peggy 
      Haplin is finishing up:                                                                                    90.


                                  PEGGY HAPLIN (AMPLIFIED)
                    Anyhow.  Have fun.  Eat, drink, win 
                    walruses, and generally rejoice in 
                    the myriad pleasures of living here 
                    in Haplin... Thank-you!

    Big applause... Tommy and Doctor Pete share a look... Tommy 
      nods... Emma runs up to him...

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    I won!  I won a dragon!

    And she shows him the stuffed dragon... And Georgia trails 
      her... And she sees Handsome Sam... She appears most rattled.  
      Especially when he offers her a placed:

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    Hello -- 

    But before Georgia can respond, Kelvin Tolliver approaches... 

                                  KELVIN TOLLIVER
                    Trouble --

    And he gestures... To where a pick-up truck has pulled up to 
    the entrance to the park... And out steps Carl Danco, the 
      disgruntled Bready line foreman...

      He s with a 7 equally ANGRY MEN... Most of them African-
      American... They march to the ropes securing the banner... 
    And begin to tear it down... 

      Perry Steckler and some of the other Haplin MEN try and 
      intervene... And, in seconds, there s a full-on skirmish 
      erupting... And Tommy, Kelvin and Root Beer run over, to 
      break it up... Tommy wrests Danco away --

                                  CARL DANCO
                    This has got to stop!  They are 
                    flying that thing, it is like they 
                    are spitting in the face of little 
                    Chad Sorrell!  Do you get that?  Do 
                    you see that?  Do you?

    And one of Danco s men takes a swing at one of Steckler s 
      men... And the upheaval takes a more dire bent... Fists are 
      flying... Children are crying... Angry shouting and shoving, 
      Root Beer and Kelvin are jostled and pushed...

      When, at once, Tommy hears a voice.  Above the din.  A 
      panicked voice.  And Miranda Walsh appears.  And she looks 
      singularly crazed...                                                                                    91.


                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    Jordan?  Jordan, where are you? 
                    JORDAN?  JORDAN???

    All eyes are on her... Nervous chatter... When she stops.  
      Bends down.  And lets out A WAIL.  A high, terrified PULING --

    For she is holding the stuffed walrus, Wally...

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    JORDANNNNNN!!!!

    As we MOVE IN ON Tommy... And, in absurd counterpoint, the 
      jaunty piano and horn section OPENING of Chicago s  SATURDAY 
      IN THE PARK  fades up... ( Saturday in the park/I think it 
      was the 4th of July , etc.)

      As everyone looks around... True panic setting in... Tommy 
      looks over at Rachel... At Emma...

      Bedlam ensues... Tommy looks at Root Beer and Kelvin... At 
      Peggy Haplin... At John Haplin... At The Stiviletto Brothers 
      as, oddly unmindful, Lincoln winds up and tosses a softball 
      at the target of the  Dunk-A-Dimwit ... This one connects... 
      And Baby Boy is dropped into the water tank...

      Miranda continues to wail... Everyone seems to be looking to 
      Tommy:  Georgia, Andrew Haplin, Dot Manning, Carl Danco, 
      Perry Steckler... CUT TO:

      INT.  HENLEY S ROOM - MANNING BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

      CONTINUE MUSIC.  Henley changes her clothes... She takes off 
      her sweater... She is wearing a wife-beater tee beneath it...

      Henley holds up a FLASHLIGHT.  Switches it on and off, 
      testing it... She dials a number on her CELL... Gets an 
      ANSWERING MACHINE... At the beep:

                                  HENLEY (INTO PHONE)
                    Hey.  So I m here.  I m going to go 
                    up now.  It s 9:30 my time... I ll 
                    call if I find anything... Oh, it s 
                    me...

      She looks at herself in the mirror... 

                                  HENLEY (INTO PHONE)
                    Chloe.

    She hangs up... We are behind her, as she looks into the 
      mirror... Steeling herself...                                                                                     92.


    And then we see it:  on her back, just below her shoulder.  
      There is a TATTOO...

    A tattoo of a question mark.  With a halo. 

      EXT.   THAW FEST  - TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

      CONTINUE MUSIC.  As MOTHERS grab their CHILDREN.  As Kelvin 
    and Root Beer try and keep the peace... 

      EXT.  TOWN SQUARE -  THAW FEST  - NIGHT

      CONTINUE MUSIC.  As FAMILIES run for their cars.  And a 
      hysterical Miranda Kirby rushes up to Tommy --

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    What are you going to do?  What are 
                    you going to do?  WHAT ARE YOU 
                    GOING TO DO?  WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO 
                    DO???

      INT.   HAPLIN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      CONTINUE MUSIC.  Down the long, empty corridor we go... 
      Through the ribbons of shadow... At last coming to Sheriff 
      Conroy s room... CREEPING TOWARD his bed... Slowly... 

    A SHADOW falls over Sheriff Conroy s slumbering form... 
      Looking at him... Only to recede.  Back the way it came... 
      And, after it is gone... Sheriff Conroy opens his eyes...

    He looks terrified.

      INT.  SECOND FLOOR - MANNING BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

      CONTINUE MUSIC.  As Henley walks out of her room.  Walks over 
    to the staircase, leading up to the third floor.  The 
      forbidden third floor...

    She takes a deep breath.  Turns on the flashlight.

    And ascends the stairs.

      Once she is out of sight, there is movement.  A FIGURE steps 
    out from the penumbra of a second floor wall sconce.

    It is Merritt Grieves.  He has seen Henley climb the stairs.

    And he smiles.

      EXT.  TOWN SQUARE -  THAW FEST  - NIGHT

      CONTINUE MUSIC.  Emma runs into Tommy s arms... He holds her 
      tight... Looking at Rachel... And we HEAR:                                                                                    93.


                                  SHERIFF CONROY (O.S.)
                    He ll be back.  Now that blood s 
                    been spilled again.  Everything 
                    will unravel.  And he ll be back.

    As Tommy holds his daughter, he looks across the violent 
      swirl of panic that the  Thaw Fest  has become --

    To find Big Dave.  Their eyes lock.  Big Dave looks lost.  
      Lost and scared and terribly mistaken... And WE HEAR:

                                  DONNA FRIDDLE (O.S.)
                    One thing you can count on:  The 
                    Magic Man?  He s somebody you 
                    passed by on the street today...

    And Kelvin and Root Beer walk up to Tommy... *

                                  KELVIN TOLLIVER*
                    What are we gonna do, T.C. -- ? *

    He looks at them.  Considers.  Then he takes something from  *
    his pocket.  Looks at it.  It s the SHERIFF S STAR.*

    And Tommy pins it onto his chest.  He turns to them -- *

                                  TOMMY*
                    We re gonna find that little girl.*

      They look at him.  As if seeing him for the first time.   *
      Which, in a sense, they are --*

      And, off Tommy, fully aware that everything he has known up  *
      till now is forever changed, we CUT TO:

      EXT.  MAC S POND - NIGHT

      CONTINUE MUSIC.  We begin at the banks of the pond.  As a 
      crack forms on the ice.  The thaw finally taking hold...

      And we FOLLOW THE CRACK.  As it spider-webs across the 
      surface of the pond.  Filament striations radiating from the 
      seam of the main crack...

      We FOLLOW IT... OUT TO THE CENTER OF THE ICE...  

      Still the joyful tune PLAYS ON ( People reaching/People 
      touching/A real celebration/Waiting for us all...  )...

      As the crack leads up to Raymond Manning s ICE SHACK... ( If 
    we want it, really want it/Can you dig it...  ) 

      Its interior lit with a lantern glow... ( yes, I can...  )                                                                                    94.


    As a SHADOWY FIGURE ENTERS... Dragging another FIGURE.  A 
      much smaller figure... ( And I ve been waiting such a long 
      time/For the day... ) 

      ... Closing the door behind the both of them.

      And we can see, in the pearlescent glow of the FULL MOON, now 
      skidding across the night sky, as if it, too, were melting, 
      like a tatter of butter in a skillet:

      The DOOR to the Manning ice shack.  Because we hadn t noticed 
      it before.  The color of the door...

    For it is blue.        

                            THE END
