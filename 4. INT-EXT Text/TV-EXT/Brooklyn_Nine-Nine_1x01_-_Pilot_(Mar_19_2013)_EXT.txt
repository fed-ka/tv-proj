                This job is eating me alive.  I can't 
                breathe anymore.


    A castle-like building on a busy Brooklyn street.

                              TERRY (V.O.)
                      (quietly)
                All right.  Let s get started.


  A typical loft style New York apartment building.


  Charles talks to Rosa.

                              CHARLES
                Hey, Rosa.  I just happened to notice, 
                there s an old movie festival at the Film 
                Forum this week.  You want to go?

                              ROSA
                      (shrugs)
                Sure.

                              CHARLES
                      (shocked)
                Cool!  Awesome.  There s a bunch of movie 
                options, so I ll send you those options, 
                and you can pick an option and we will 
                watch that option.

                              ROSA
                You just pick.

                              CHARLES
                Yeah.  I can definitely do that.  
                      (searching)
                I ll probably just go with something 
                classic?  Like  Citizen Kane. 

                              ROSA
                 Citizen Kane  is terrible.  Pick a good 
                movie.

  She walks off.

                              CHARLES
                      (confused)
                It s every critic s favorite movie.


  Terry, Amy, and Jake.  The room overflows with files.

                              JAKE
                He s seriously assigning me to the 
                records room?  Why do we even have a 
                records room?  The computer has been 
                  invented, right?

                              TERRY
                You re lucky, man.  I wish I could get 
                assigned here full time.  
                      (lovingly)
                You could not be farther from the action.

                              JAKE
                  Sergeant, you know me.  I have more 
                arrests than anyone.  Can you please tell 
                the captain how dumb it is to lock his 
                best detective in a file cabinet?  

                              AMY
                Second best.

                              TERRY
                You re wrong about Holt.  That man has 
                  forgotten more about being a cop than 
                you ll ever know.  In 1981, he caught the 
                Disco Strangler.
