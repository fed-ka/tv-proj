      It s a quiet night in Rosewood and most of the town s shops 
      are closed and empty.  Through the pane glass window of the 
      Rosewood Grill, we see EMILY, ARIA, SPENCER and HANNA wearing 
      their black funeral dresses, sitting at a table. They are the 
      only patrons in the restaurant, creating an iconic Edward 
      Hopper-like image.       


      Spencer, Aria, Hanna and Emily file out of the restaurant and 
      walk off in four different directions.  CAMERA rests on the 
      image of Jenna, who wee see through the front window, sitting 
      alone.

      FADE IN:


      Having just left her friends, Aria walks home alone.  She 
      sees, up ahead, EZRA walking toward his parked car.  He has 
      taken off his tie, but still wears the dark suit he wore to 
      Ali s funeral.  As he is about to climb into his car, he 
      looks up and sees Aria.  They lock eyes for a long moment.  
      Then he offers a charming and disarming smile that invites a 
      smile from Aria.     

                                  EZRA
                    I thought about you all day.  Are 
                    you okay?  

                                  ARIA
                    I will be.

                                  EZRA
                    It s hard to lose someone you re 
                    close to.  It changes you.     

                                  ARIA
                    We lost Alison a year ago.  Today 
                    was more about admitting it to 
                      ourselves.  

      After a moment -

                                  EZRA
                    I d offer you a ride -

                                  ARIA
                    - but I d have to say  no.   I 
                    meant what I said, Ezra.  I d never 
                    do anything that would get you into 
                    trouble. 

                                  EZRA
                    And being alone with you in my car 
                    would probably lead to trouble.  

      She considers the kind of trouble they would get into and a 
      flirtatious smile comes across her face.  

                                  ARIA
                    Yeah.

                    But if it s only a few miles...

      Now they are both thinking about the kind of trouble they 
      would love to get into and it s sizzling.

                    So what did you buy?

      He pulls out a CD.  It s The Fray.  

                                  EZRA
                    B26.  

      The look they share tells us they both recognize the 
        significance of his purchase.  He wanted to savor their 
      moment.  

      BETH, a female student from Rosewood High, approaches and 
      recognizes both of them.

                    Hi, Aria.  Hey, Mr. Fitz.

                    Good night, Mr. Fitz.  

      He wants to grab her and kiss her but -

                    I ll see you at school.

      Spencer sits at the outdoor dining table.  She peruses a 
      HOLLIS COLLEGE CLASS CATALOGUE as she pours a lot of sugar 
      into her coffee cup and eats a healthy breakfast.

      ANGLE ON the CATALOGUE where Spencer circles an INTERIOR 
      DESIGN CLASS.  

      PETER HASTINGS, Spencer and Melissa s father, walks out of 
      the house.  Dressed for work in a well-fitting suit and tie, 
      he joins Spencer at the table. 

                                  PETER
                    You re thinking about a college 
                    credit class, Spence?  That s a 
                    great idea.  

      MELISSA and WREN approach from the barn and join the 
      impromptu family meal.

                                    MELISSA
                    I took a Poli-Sci class at Hollis 
                    my junior year.  It was fun.

                                    SPENCER
                    That s what I was thinking.  I m 
                    looking for something fun.  

                                  PETER
                    For a local college, Hollis has an 
                    excellent Economics program. 

                                  WREN
                      Economics, that sounds like a 
                    bloody load of fun.  

      Melissa gives him a playful shrug.  

                                    MELISSA
                    Like her older sister, Spencer is 
                    on the fast track to an Ivy League 
                      education.  

                                  PETER
                    Spence, I really do like the idea, 
                    but I want to make sure you have 
                    time for the commitments you ve 
                    already taken on.  Class President

                                  PETER
                    The Hastings girls are ambitious, 
                    Wren.  That s why they re so 
                      successful.  

      His tone suggests he doesn t appreciate Wren s humor.  Wren 
      knows to back off.

                    So what are you thinking, Spence?  
                    Poli-Sci or Econ?  

      Spencer closes the catalogue.

                                    SPENCER
                    I haven t decided yet.


      Emily, dressed for school, reads To Kill A Mockingbird as she 
      sits on her front porch.  She looks up and finds herself 
      smiling as MAYA approaches. 

      As Maya sits next to Emily -

                                  MAYA
                    So, are you okay?  

      Emily doesn t have an immediate answer.

                                  MAYA (CONT D)
                    That was a dumb question.  Of 
                    course you re not okay.  I thought 
                    about going to the funeral, but I 
                    didn t know her and it didn t feel 
                    right.  

                                  EMILY
                      I understand.  

      Maya glances toward Emily s coffee cup.

                                  EMILY
                    Sure.  You want your own?

                                  MAYA
                    I d rather share yours.

      Emily hands Maya the cup. For a brief moment their hands 
      touch. As Maya takes a sip of coffee --   

                                  EMILY
                    You look tired.

                                  MAYA
                    I haven t slept much.  My mom found 
                    another box of Alison s things in 
                    the basement.  There were pictures 
                    of her in my room.  Her room.  

      Maya s usual perky exterior falls away.

                                  MAYA (CONT D)
                    She s everywhere.  And that poster.

                    Someone should take down the 
                    posters.  It hurts way too much to 
                    look at them.  

      Emily is on the verge of breaking down.  

                                  MAYA
                    Emily, I m so sorry.

      Maya hugs her friend.  Comforts her. 

      PAM, wearing tennis whites and looking extremely fit after a 
      practice match, walks up the front walk.

                    Is everything okay?

      Emily breaks their hug and inches away from Maya.  She looks 
      for a reaction on her mother s face then realizes she has 
      done nothing wrong.  

                                  EMILY

      Spencer tilts her head from side to side, obviously 
      stretching a sore neck.  She lines up the next shot then

                    We re all trying to find a way to 
                    deal with it.  

                                  EMILY
                    Maya and I are going for caffeine.  
                    Wanna join?

                                    SPENCER
                    I d kill for a latte -  

      Then she has second thoughts. 

                                    SPENCER (CONT D)
                    - but this is my only time to 
                    practice.

                    We ll catch you later.  

      Spencer returns her focus to her practice shots.  CAMERA 
      stays with Maya and Emily, heading toward the entrance of the 
      school.

                                  MAYA
                    She s intense.

                                  EMILY
                    If you knew her parents you d 
                      understand. 

      As they round the corner WE CUT TO --


      Fireworks explode in the distance.  Alison leads the charge 
      as the PLLs follow her and sneak across the lawn, toward a 
      free standing garage.  

      As they near the garage, Alison pulls a stink bomb 
      firecracker from her pocket.

      They stop.  Alison, annoyed, turns to her. 

                                  ALISON
                    What, Emily?

                                  EMILY
                    I don t want to do this.

                    Fine. Go back. You re on your own.

      She doesn t want to be on her own and Ali knows it.  

                                  ARIA
                    Maybe Emily s right. If we tell the 
                    police they ll bring him in. 
                    They ll take care of it.

                                  ALISON
                    What s the fun in that?  
                          (nobody answers, then:)*
                    Toby Cavanaugh is a freak and we *
                    need to teach him a lesson.  If he 
                    thinks he can come and spy on us 
                    while we re in your bedroom, Emily, 
                    he needs to know that his  domain  
                    is no longer a safe little hideout.  

      Alison looks over at the garage.

                    Are you sure it was Toby?

                                  ALISON
                    Yes, and it s a stink bomb for 
                    God s sakes.  We re not nuking the 
                    place. Now let s do it. 

      She sneaks closer to the garage.  The PLLs exchange cautious 
      looks, but then one-by-one they follow their leader.  

      When they reach the garage, Alison opens the top half of the *
      Dutch door and peaks inside. ALISON S POV: the garage is Toby s *
      lair.  Exercise equipment.  Computer stuff.  Cool band posters 
      decorate the walls.  

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    Give me the lighter.

      Spencer hands Ali, who is gleeful, the lighter.  She ignites 
      the firecracker fuse and when it sparks, she tosses it into 
      the garage. She takes one last look inside.  For a beat she *
      locks eyes on something (Spencer clocks her). Then Alison *
      snaps her attention back to the PLLs.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    Let s get out of here.

      She runs back across the yard and the PLLs run along side of 
      her.  What they don t see is that behind them - inside the 
      garage - flames have erupted.  Then they hear it, the sound 
      that changes their lives forever - A TEENAGE GIRL S TERRIFIED 
      SCREAM.

      Alison and the PLLs stop dead in their tracks as the garage 
      burns behind them.

      Emily sits in the passenger seat and Maya sits in the back as 
      Ben drives into the school parking lot.

                    Shut up, Ben.

      He parks the car and doesn t let up -

                    I don t know about Emily, but I 
                    slept like a baby.

      Maya opens her door.

                    Are you coming, Em?

                                  EMILY
                    I ll catch up.

      Maya is not sure how to read Emily s mood.  She leaves the 
      car and heads into school.   

                                  BEN
                    We were just messing around.  What 
                    are you so weirded out about?  

      Shocking Ben, Emily leans over and plants a major kiss on 
      him.  It s a serious lip-lock.  He grabs her. It s passionate 
      and builds.  THUD. THUD. Someone POUNDS on the car window.  

      Emily pulls back from Ben.  A pack of HORNY GUYS are hanging 
      on and around Ben s car, watching them.

                                  JOCK
                    Get a room, Ben!  And rock it! 

      He pumps his fist, urging his friend to go for it.

                                  JOCK #2
                    Looking good, Emily.  

      She realizes he is looking at her chest.  She notices a 
      button has popped open and she quickly fastens it closed.    PRETTY LITTLE LIARS  Ep. 102 "The Jenna Thing" Blue  4.12.10  42    



      As Emily climbs out of Ben s car, she sees Hanna who happened 
      upon the moment.  Hanna shoots a look at the jock guys.  

                                  JOCK #2

      Hanna stares him down.

                    Are you talking to me?

      The  it girl  speaks and the guys back down.

                    Whatever. 

      Emily hurries away from the car, heading toward school.  
      Hanna keeps up with her. 

                                  HANNA
                    Are you okay?

                                  EMILY
                    Not really.  

      Hanna is more curious than concerned.

                                  HANNA
                    I ve never thought of you as 
                    someone who d be so comfortable 
                    with PDA.     

      Emily stops and turns to her old friend.  

                                  EMILY
                    Maybe I m not the person everyone

      She spots Ezra walking toward her.  Sporting well worn jeans  
      and a boyish T-shirt, he looks damn cute as he heads her way.  
    A big smile comes across his face and it s obvious that he is 
      thrilled to see her.

      Aria walks toward the entrance to the theater ahead of her 
      mom -  Ella catches up to her.

      Ella doesn t see the  this is so damn awkward  look that 
      washes over Aria. 


      Spencer sits on the steps and laces up her running sneakers.  
      She looks up when she hears the door open.

      Her eyes quickly read an unhappy father who is dressed in 
      Saturday casual clothes, not running clothes.  He can barely 
      look at Spencer, but in that brief moment his silence speaks 
      volumes.  

      Peter walks past her and heads toward the barn where a 
      devastated Melissa waits for him in the doorway.  Melissa s 
      cold eyes shoot daggers at Spencer.  The weight of the moment 
      washes over Spencer as she stands alone on the porch and 
      knowingly looks on.  THUNDER RUMBLES in the distance. 


      THUNDER continues as Aria exits the coffee shop and walks 
      home.  It starts to RAIN and, caught without an umbrella, she 
      pulls up the collar of her jacket.  


      Aria hears the car and glances over to see Ezra approaching.  
      They lock eyes.  Aria wants him to stop.  So do we.


      Aria s heart pounds with anticipation as Ezra slows down - 

      Is he going to stop?  The look on her face tells us the 
      answer as he decides to do the right thing.  Aria, feeling 
      dejected, watches him drive on.  Just when we thought it was 
      over, the GLOW OF RED TAIL LIGHTS illuminate in the rain.  
      Ezra brakes and opens the passenger door.  


      Emily sits alone at the counter.    PRETTY LITTLE LIARS  Ep. 102 "The Jenna Thing" Blue  4.12.10  53    



      Spencer, alone, jogs down the wet street.  Her jog is 
      inspired today - she runs like she s trying to escape 
      herself.  Then she stops when she sees --

      Jenna sitting on a bus bench.  Jenna holds a voice activated 
      cell phone to her lips and quietly commands it to -- 

                                  JENNA
                    Send text now.  

      She lowers the phone and sensing someone s presence, looks up 
      at Spencer.  It feels like she can see her.  (We know she 
      can t.)  Spencer stands frozen as Jenna finally stands and 
      walks off in the opposite direction.
