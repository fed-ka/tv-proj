      INT. KINDERGARTEN. LONDON. CLASSROOM - DAY 1. 1000

      A madhouse.  Four year old KIDS, out of control, playing and 

      fighting noisily, running circles around their TEACHER, a 
      tormented girl of around 25, who s struggling to calm them 
      down.

                                    TEACHER
                    No, Gracie, don t do that - Graham!  

                    Let go of him, I said LET GO!

      The HEADMISTRESS steps into the fray. 

                                  HEADMISTRESS
                      Everything alright?


                                    TEACHER
                    Yes.  Sort of.  I m sorry, I ve 
                    just got the worst headache and the 

                    little buggers ...

                          (been there, done that)
                    They know just when to strike.  
                    Sometimes I think it s not lice we 
                    should be looking for but three 
                    little sixes.

                    I ll deal with them, why don t you 

                    go take some paracetamol and get 

                    some fresh air.  You know where the 
                    first aid box is.

      The teacher reaches into the cabinet for a bottle of 
        PARACETAMOL.  She opens it - it s got a tamper proof foil, a 
      new bottle - she peels it off and pops two pills with some 
      water.


      As she swallows them, she kind of tastes something different - 

      but then shrugs it off and puts the bottle back.

      The teacher walks into the classroom to find the kids all 
      sitting on the floor, listening to the headmistress who s 
      reading them a story.

                                  HEADMISTRESS
                    Feeling better?

      The teacher stands in the doorway for a beat, looking 

      unsettled.  Not sure what she s feeling.

                                    TEACHER
                    Sort of.  I ll be fine.

      The kids are all staring at her.  She just stands there, 
      holding on to the door, looking dazed.

      HER POV: it goes all swirly, double vision.

      The headmistress senses something wrong and gets up, goes to 
      her.

                                  HEADMISTRESS
                    Maybe you should sit down.

                                    TEACHER
                    No, I m fine, honestly ...

      And then it hits her, she suddenly goes into convulsions, 
      jerking violently before collapsing onto the floor, coughing 
      up blood, the kids shrieking and jumping back in horror.

      INT. DANNY S FLAT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 2. 0700
66

      DANNY, bleary eyed like he s just woken up, emerges from the 
      bedroom area and plods into the kitchen. The flat is eerily 
      quiet.  

      He flicks on the kettle which boils up noisily, and reaches 
      for a mug, then for a jar of coffee.  The jar s empty.  He 
      frowns and rummages through the cabinet for a replacement.  
      All he can come up with is a box of Camomile herbal tea.  

      He stares wistfully at the box for a beat: it was Zoe s.  He 
      shrugs and takes out a bag and sniffs it dubiously before 
      putting it into a cup of water.


      He moves to the counter, sits down, alone with his cup.  The 
      silence is deafening.  He reaches for the remote and switches 
      on the TV.  It s the morning news.

                                  NEWSREADER

                    victims still listed in serious 
                    condition across the country ...   

      But Danny s not really listening.  His mind is elsewhere.  

      HIS POV:  on the TV is a framed picture of him and Zoe in 
      happier times.  

      He stares at it.

      CLOSE on ZOE s face ...

                    avoid taking any form of 
                      paracetamol while this matter is 
                    being investigated, while 
                      manufacturers have issued 
                      statements assuring the public that 
                    ...

                    At least I ll be able to call you.

                    How late?  How many time zones are 
                    we talking about?  

                                  FIONA
                    Less than twenty.

                      I promised Wes we d take him to the

                    last weekend of the Space show, 
                    he s dying to see it.

                                  FIONA
                    You might have to take him on your 
                    own.

                                  ADAM
                    It would be great if we were both 
                    there for it.  We haven t done 
                    anything together with him for 
                    ages.

                                  FIONA
                    I know ...  Look, I ll try, I 
                    really will, but you know what it s 
                    like. 

      Adam just nods.  She can tell there s something on his mind.

                    He ll be fine, Adam.  It s not as

                    great school, he loves it there.

                      Everything else can wait.  We ve 
                    now got nine people dead after 
                    taking the most harmless and 
                    commonly used medicine in the 
                    country.  

                                  RUTH
                    I thought it was a manufacturing 
                    cock-up.

                                  HARRY
                    That s a story we re encouraging.  
                    The pills were tampered with 
                      intentionally, and this letter 
                      unfortunately scuppers any theories 
                    of corporate blackmail, which was 
                    the Met s first port of call.  

                                  SAM
                    Tampered?

                                    MALCOLM
                    The pills were laced with a little 
                                                                                              *

                    We need to look at this as a 
                    potential act of domestic terrorism 
                    and the clock is running on this 
                    one, I don t need to tell you how 
                    pervasive this already is.


                                  SAM
                    I know I ve already thrown out all 
                    my pills, and it s not the best 
                    time of month for me to do that, I 
                    can tell you that much.

      They all fix her.  She shrinks back, realising she probably 
      shouldn t have said as much.

      Ruth is studying the note.

                                  RUTH
                    This saying.

                    What about it?

                    It sounds more like a calling card 
                    than a statement after the fact.

                    That s what we need to find out.

                    Something like this has to have an

                    for the time being, this is 
                    strictly need to know.  Until we

                    Hey.

      He glances at her, but doesn t answer.

                    It s sweet of you to ask.  You 
                    know, that s what I love about this 
                    business.  People care. Everybody 
                    just looks out for everybody else 
                    in such an amazing way, it just ... 
                    it just warms me up inside. 

                                  RUTH
                    Danny, I know it s hard.  I miss

                    But we re nowhere near 
                      authenticating the letter.

                                  GUY
                    It doesn t matter.  We re releasing 
                    it this afternoon. 

                                  HARRY
                    That s ludicrous, it s 
                      irresponsible.  More than that ... 
                    it s borderline criminal.

                                  GUY
                    Recent statements from Al Qaeda 
                    have referred to them targeting 
                    financial and infrastructure damage 
                    rather than physical damage, 
                    haven t they?

                    We re releasing it, Harry.  

                                  HARRY
                    Look, right now people are wary of 
                    taking medication but that s where 
                    it stops.  Telling them their pills 
                    are being fiddled with by faceless 
                      terrorists and you raise the dread 
                    to a whole new level ... what s 
                    next?  Milk?  Water?  To say 
                    nothing of potentially triggering 
                    another round of racial violence.

                    Don t get me wrong, Harry.  The PM

                      terrorism.  Which it undoubtedly 
                    is.

                                  HARRY
                    I think we d all be on safer ground 
                    if people acted more on evidence 
                    than on belief.  Especially where

                    People are already scared out 
                    there.  There s no need to make 
                    their lives any more fearful.  

                                  GUY
                    And there s no point pouring all 
                    our resources into waging a war 
                    against terrorism if we can t point

                    I ve got three groups who have been 
                    very vocal in their criticism of 
                    Pharmavor and their Aids pricing 
                                                                                              **

                    history of violent protest of any 
                    kind.

                    hits so far.  They don t have 
                    anyone working there with so much 
                    as an unpaid parking ticket, no one

                    across something in an old book 
                    about the Crusades.  Back in the 
                    twelfth century, they were a small

                    These groups always take their name

      Adam and Danny walk to their car.  The tension between them 
      is palpable.

                                  ADAM
                    You want to talk about it?

                    Why is everyone so interested in my 
                    wellbeing all of a sudden?

                                  ADAM
                    Could it have anything to do with 
                    the fact that you ve been acting 
                    like a total prat all week?

                    None of us wanted to lose Zoe, 
                    Danny.  But that s the business 
                    we re in.

      Adam unlocks the car remotely.

                    Sorry.

      A beat then Adam gets in the car.

                    Fine by me.

      They both stare forward. In silence Adam starts the car and 
      drives off.

      INT. PHARMAVOR FACTORY FLOOR - DAY 2. 1230

      Adam and Danny are walked through a gleaming, high tech pill 
      production line.  


                                  EXECUTIVE
                    You ve got to understand something.  
                    We produce over seven million of 
                    those pills every year, and have 
                    done for over twenty years.  This

                    couldn t have happened here at the 
                    factory.  What if someone tampered 
                    with them after they were shipped 
                    out?

      -- and over to a glass fronted COMPUTER CONTROL ROOM where 
      TECHNICIANS in white coats monitor the process.

                          (shaking his head)
                    The killer tablets were bought from 
                      widespread locations and came from 
                    different distributors.

                    It happened here.

                    That s impossible.  This factory is 
                    as good as it gets.  The production 
                    is completely automated and 
                      computerized, it s monitored 24/7 
                    by a team of technicians who are in 
                    turn supervised and...  No one can 
                    tamper with the process without 
                    being spotted, you need 
                      authorization codes and clearance 
                    levels...

      Adam nods, looking grim.  Doesn t like the idea.  He pulls 
      out his mobile phone.  Hits a speed dial key.

                    Yes.  Whoever did this simply 
                    messed around with the composition 
                                                                                              *

                    Not enough to affect a whole batch.

                                  COLIN
                    Hardly.  The odds are it would pass 
                      unnoticed.

                                  DANNY
                    How stupid is that?  Don t they 
                    have any firewalls on their 
                    systems?

                                  COLIN
                    They do.  Sadly, their servers use 
                    a rather popular model of router 
                    which is still set to its default 
                    password.

                                  DANNY
                    You mean  Password .  And we re 
                    supposed to protect these people?

      ANGLE on Harry who notes the remark but says nothing.

                                  COLIN
                    Normally, I wouldn t complain, it s 
                    been a great help in letting us 
                    into systems we ve wanted to sniff 
                    around in, but in this case ... 
                    rather more unfortunate.

                                  HARRY
                    Okay, so what you re saying is this 
                    wasn t hugely difficult to do.

                    Looks like we have ourselves a 
                    whole new gaggle of suspects.

                                  ADAM
                      Fundamentalist hackers.  They want 
                    to drag the world back a couple of 
                    thousand years, but they don t mind 
                    using technology to do it.

                    It s not about using medicine as a

                    We take hits, Danny.  And usually 
                    when we lose people, it s because 
                    they ve been killed.  It s part of 
                    the job.  My own wife ... my own 
                    wife is in some godforsaken place 
                    right now, probably flirting with 
                    some homicidal maniac as we speak. 

                          (beat, suddenly 
                            reassessing it)

                                  DANNY
                    Hey, whatever turns you on ...

                                  ADAM
                            (remembering her words)
                    It s what we do.  

                                  DANNY
                          (emphatic, low)
                    Look, I have no problem dying for 
                    my country, just as I m sure Zoe 
                    wouldn t either.  It s being 
                    stabbed in the back by our own 
                    people that I didn t sign up for.  

                                  ADAM
                    She did good, Danny.  The world is 
                    a better place for her having had 
                    that scumbag killed.  I bet if you 
                    asked her, she d do it again.  Even 
                    given the price.
                          (beat)
                    At least she s still alive.  And 
                    free.

                                  DANNY
                    Yeah, I m sure she s ecstatic. 
                          (beat)
                    She had a life here, you know?  She 
                    was going to get married, for God s 
                    sake.  Now what does she have?  

                                  ADAM
                          (beat. He agrees. Then.)
                    Did you speak to Will?

                                  DANNY
                    Yes.

                                  ADAM
                    How did it go?

                                  DANNY
                    How do you think?

      A beat.

                                  ADAM
                    Look, Harry didn t expect this to 
                    happen ... none of us did.  But 
                    that s the way it panned out and 
                    you re going to have to move on.

                                  DANNY
                    And as it happens, that s exactly 
                    what s been on my mind.
                          (beat)
                    Moving on.

      Adam looks at him.  Gets his drift.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                  ADAM
                    It s up to you.  You ve got to 
                    decide how much doing this means to 
                    you, what you re prepared to do, 
                    how far you re prepared to go.

                                  DANNY
                          (bitterly at Adam)
                    That was pretty much established on 
                    the ferry, don t you think?

      A beat.  Not one of Adam s fondest memories, coaching someone 
      on their first kill.  He gets up, looks him in the eye.

                                  ADAM
                    I need to know whether you re in or 
                    out, Danny.  

      And he leaves.

      INT. DANNY S FLAT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 2. 2300
1919

      Danny walks in to the darkened flat.  He flicks on the light.  
      Someone s already there.  WILL. 

                                  DANNY
                    Well this is turning into my lucky 
                    night.  How d you get in here?


      Will holds up a key and puts it down on the dresser.

                                  WILL
                    She gave it to me, remember.

      Danny nods.  Walks past him towards the kitchen alcove.

                                  WILL (cont d)
                    Where is she, Danny?

                                  DANNY
                    We ve been through this.  I can t 
                    tell you.

                                  WILL
                    I want to know.  I deserve to know.

                                  DANNY
                    It s not my decision.

                                  WILL
                    Oh, and I bet you re all broken up 
                    inside about that, aren t you?

                                  DANNY
                    What s that supposed to mean?





                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                  WILL
                    Come on.  That whole brooding thing 
                    ever since she and I got together.  
                    That s more than just a friend 
                    looking out for her, isn t it?  

      Danny doesn t answer him.

                                  WILL (cont d)
                    Where is she, Danny?

                    this thing s complicated enough

                    the life of the almighty secret 
                    service, but it s my life we re

                    So where is she?

                                  WILL (cont d)
                    I ve done some checking.  Wherever 
                    it is she s been sent to, she s not 
                    there under her own name.  If that 
                    is her real name.

                                  DANNY
                    It is.  Was.  

                                  WILL
                    I need to talk to her.  Just tell

                                  DANNY
                    You need to leave.

                                  WILL
                    Just tell me where.

      Danny grabs him and pushes him towards the door.

                                  DANNY
                    I can t talk about this, don t you 
                      understand?  You have to go.

      Will shoves him off, they wrestle.

                                  WILL
                    I ll go to the press.  I swear to 
                    God ...

                                  DANNY
                    Fine.

                                  WILL
                    I ll tell them everything, I ll 
                    blow this thing wide open.

                                  DANNY
                    I don t care!

      They shove each other off and let go.  The realization of her 
      condition hits Will hard.  He slides down to the floor.

                                  WILL
                    Ten years ...  My Zoe ...

      Danny sits on the floor, facing Will.  A beat. 

                                  DANNY
                    She s not in prison.

                    Just leave, will you? 

      Will gets up, heads for the door.  Holds it open, turns back 
      to Danny.

                                  WILL
                    Talk to them, Danny.  Tell them

                    safe, nothing s been lost.  This is

                    banks in this country, by law, have 
                    many safeguards and back-ups to 
                    ensure no data can ever be 
                      permanently lost.  They have hard 
                    drives that are updated every four 
                    hours and stored in multiple 
                    locations across the country.

      Harry looks at Danny, looks up at Adam and almost

      Harry and Danny.

                                  DANNY
                    I think he ll do it.

                                  HARRY
                    He ll be in breach of the Official 
                    Secrets Act.  He could go to 
                    prison.

                                  DANNY
                    I don t think he cares.  He really 
                    wants to talk to Zoe.

      Harry fumes for a beat.

                                  HARRY
                    Tell him to go ahead and do it.  He 
                    can hold a live press conference 
                    for all I care.  But tell him this:  
                    if he does that, if he breaks this 
                    story, all he ll have done is make 
                    damn sure Zoe really does end up in 
                    jail, because that s what would 
                    happen.  Is that what he wants?  


      Danny realizes he s right.  Frustrated.

                                  DANNY
                    Why not tell him?

                                  HARRY
                    It s for her own safety, Danny.  
                    You can t count on everyone s

      INT. THAMES HOUSE. THE GRID - DAY 3. 1400

      Ruth, walking with some files, bumps into TWO MEN walking 
      with Harry.  Ruth recognizes one of them, ANDREW FORRESTAL, 
      good looking if a little shy and bookish, more or less her 
      age.

                                  RUTH
                    Andrew?   What are you doing here.

                                  ANDREW
                    Ruth.  It s been ages.

                                  RUTH
                      I wouldn t go that far.

                                  HARRY
                    I see you two know each other.

                                  ANDREW
                    I was toiling at GCHQ at the same 
                    time as Ruth.

                                  HARRY
                          (to answer Ruth s 
                            quizzical look)
                    Andrew and John are with the 
                    National High Tech Crime Unit.  
                    They re going to help liaise

      Ruth, not minding it at all.

                                  RUTH
                    Good.

                    This way.

      They walk away, Andrew glancing back for an awkward smile at 
      Ruth.                                                                                              *

      INT. THAMES HOUSE. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT 3. 2100
2626*

      Colin, Andrew, John and a team of ANALYSTS are working 
                                                                                              *
      feverishly, trying to track down the intrusion.

      Colin spots something on the screen as Andrew, next to him, 
      types away.

                                  COLIN
                    Wait wait wait, go back, go back to 
                    this one.

      As Andrew hit a few keys, Ruth pops her head in to see how 
      they re doing.

                                  RUTH
                    Any luck tracing our hackers?
                                                                                              *

      But neither of them respond to her as Colin rises out of his 
      seat, pointing at the screen.

                                  COLIN
                    This node here.  Look at the time 
                    delay.  It looks too close to be 
                    just ...
                          (he types in some keys, 
                            reads results)
                    Yes!  See that?  It s also a Westar 
                    downlink.  Which could be that ...
                          (he types some more, 
                            then:)
                    Stop the presses.  He s routing 
                    through the same CMT host as the 
                    one from the second bank.  

      Ruth, lost by the tech-speak.  She walks off.

                                  RUTH
                    I ll come back later.

                                  JOHN
                                                                                              *
                          (checking it, then, 
                            frustrated)
                    Yes, but it s not enough.  We can t 
                      triangulate without INTX signature 
                    packets from a secondary root 
                    server.

                                  COLIN
                    We have one.  The first attack,  
                    the one on the pill factory.  It s 
                    also on Pharmavor.  
                                                                                              *

                                  ANDREW
                    Of course. We can triangulate back 
                    from there.  That should tell us 
                                                                                              *

      Adam and Danny, watching the screens.  Colin points at a 
      screen displaying the plans of the building, with a green 
      area highlighted.

                                  COLIN
                    The scans indicate high emission 
                    readings in this area here, which 
                      correlates with the wiring plans we 
                    found.  I d say that s their 
                    computer room.

                                  ADAM
                    You re sure of that?

                                  COLIN
                    No.  He could have a laptop with a 
                    wireless connection.  He could be 
                    sitting anywhere in there.

                                  ADAM
                    Great.
                          (beat, but:)
                    We have no choice.  We ll go in 
                    from here and from here.  Danny, 
                    you and Alpha unit use this access 
                    here, make sure this section here 
                    is covered, I ll take Charlie unit 
                    and cover the main staircase.

                                  DANNY
                    I can live with that.

      Adam looks at him, unsure about how to take it.

      ANGLE ON COLIN: something s distracted him on one of the 
      screens.  He watches, curiously.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                    We got a tip off that the mosque 
                    was about to be raided.

      Adam pushes his mike down ...

                                  ADAM
                    What part of get the hell out of 
                    here don t you understand?

      ... but the reporter relents.

                                  REPORTER
                    Is it true that the hacker attacks 
                    on the banks are the work of 
                    Islamic cyberterrorists linked to 
                    Al Qaeda?  Is that what you re 
                    doing here? 

      He drifts off, his eyes moving worriedly beyond the reporter, 
      towards the mosque.

      ADAM S POV: worshippers outside the mosque are looking at 
      them curiously, realizing something suspicious is going on.

                                  ADAM
                    Oh no.

      Adam s mind is racing, eyes darting back and forth from the 
      men outside the mosque, to the news crews, to the waiting 
      vans.

      He glares at the reporters, a murderous anger in his eyes ...

                    Oh, screw it.

      INT. MOSQUE. COMPUTER ROOM - DAY 4. 0816
4343

      A mini internet cafe, hardly high tech:  half a dozen 
      computers on cheap Formica tables and a mess of wires all 
      over the place.  THREE DARK HAIRED GUYS with beards working 
      there they leap out of their skin when Adam, Danny and the 
      others burst in.

                                  ADAM
                    Everyone up against the wall with 
                    your hands where I can see them.

      Two of them are quickly restrained by the goons -- but the 
      third guy keeps typing.  Adam spots him.

                                  ADAM (cont d)
                    YOU.  I said up against the wall 
                    NOW.


      But he keeps typing, looking up at them nervously.

      And before Adam can do anything about it, Danny flies over to 
      him, pulling him off his seat and throwing him violently at 
      the wall --

                                  DANNY
                    The man said up against the wall

                                  ADAM
                    Danny!

      The guy turns, struggling and protesting.

                    Stop, you have no right to ...

      Danny knees him in the groin before spinning him around and 
      slamming him back into the wall, pulling his arms back, 
      practically ripping them off their sockets.

                                  DANNY
                    Don t talk to me about rights.

                    Enough!

      Danny glares at Adam, shakes him off.

      And storms out of the room, brushing angrily past Colin who 
      does a double take, unsure about what happened.

      Danny reaches an intersection.  He s in a bit of a trance, 
      looking without seeing, then things slow down, it s almost as 
      if he senses something subconsciously.  He notices a man in a 
      car that s stopped at the red light.

      CLOSER ON THE MAN: he s on the phone, bothered, seemingly 
      having an heated argument. 

      DANNY: glances up at his light.  It s red.  He turns, 
      glancing at the other direction.  The light is green.  A big 
      TRUCK is hurtling down towards the intersection.

      He glances back at the man in the car.  Still arguing on his 
      phone.  Another car behind him, a TAXI.  

      He looks up at the light.  It goes from red to green, 
      straight through, no amber.


      The man in the car charges forward, as does the taxi --

      Danny looks back at the other direction, sensing something 
      wrong:

      The light is still green there too.

      He looks further: the truck is still bearing down, now almost 
      at the intersection.

      And before he can react, the truck s horn slices the air, its 
      brakes squealing for a split second but it s too late.

      THE MAN IN THE CAR: looks out his window, eyes wide, doesn t 
      even have time to brake as ...

      DANNY watches in horror as ...

      THE TRUCK PLOUGHS INTO THE CAR, sending it slamming against 
      the taxi, other cars behind them smashing into them in a 
      massive crash.

      PEDESTRIANS jump out of the way of the debris and sliding 
      cars.

      DANNY snaps back to reality, jumps into action, rushes into 
      the fray, fishing his mobile phone out.

      He dials 999 as he reaches the man in the car, who looks 
      mangled and bloodied, and trapped.

      Danny s phone rings a couple of times before a sultry voice 
      comes on the line.

      In a corner away from them, a fax machine whirs to life.  
      Ruth notices it.

      Ruth goes over to it, picks it up.  Reads it quizzically.

      CLOSE ON THE FAX:  the telltale signature at its bottom is 
      there again, only the message on it is in English and is 
      plain to understand.  It simply says:    100 MILLION AND THE

                    You ve got to understand something.  
                    We re talking about numbers that 
                    are two hundred digits long.  There 
                    are competitions with massive cash

                    jackpot.  We should look at anyone 
                    who s participated in these things.

                      programmers from around the world

      EXT. EMBANKMENT - DAY 4. 1800
5656

      Harry and Facer walk and talk, stoically courteous as always. 

                                  HARRY
                    Much as I ve found it a repugnant 
                    place to dwell, I ve tried to put 
                    myself inside your sordid mind in 
                    the hope of figuring out what 
                    loathsome move you re going to do 
                    next, but I have to say I never 
                    expected you to be that desperate.   
                    Alerting the press like that.  
                    People could have got hurt.
                                                                                              *

                    Believe me, we would have much 
                    rather avoided the potential 
                      embarrassment ourselves, had we 
                    known you were barking up the wrong 
                    tree.

                                  GUY
                    It wasn t a total loss.  Those 
                    pictures bought us some points.

                    You know that and I know that, but 
                    we don t need to let everyone in on 
                    our little secret just yet, do we?

      Andrew types away as Ruth observes.

                    ... and I want to cross-reference 
                    the search patterns for the 
                      historical background with book 
                    searches on Arabic writing.  See if 
                    we can find out where our pseudo-
                      fundamentalist is getting all his 
                    nifty lines from.

                                  ANDREW
                    Not a problem.

      He types away effortlessly, bringing up all kinds of screens.

                    Spend a few years sitting at a 
                    computer with no one around to 
                    distract you with the trivial 
                    things in life and you d be 
                    surprised at what you can do.

                                  RUTH
                    Trivial things?

                                  ANDREW
                      Friendship.  Family.  Open spaces, 
                    sunny skies.  You know... The 
                    things none of us ever has time 
                    for.

      She looks at Andrew.  She likes it.  

                                  ANDREW (cont d)
                    What about you?  How s life been

                                  RUTH
                    I suppose I have my health.

                    Come on.  Look around you.  Could

                    fuller way to live one s life?

                                  RUTH
                    Probably the same thing that s 
                    stopping you.
                          (beat)
                    Fear of change.  Habit.

                      I shouldn t complain really.  I 
                    suppose I also have my health...

      She chuckles with him, something s stirring there.  Colin 
      shows up, breaking the moment.  He peeks at the screen.

      It s late.  Danny s on his way out.  He passes Ruth s desk, 
      sees her working busily.

                    Okay.

      He turns to leave, then stops and turns back.

                    She was going to move out soon 
                    anyway.

                    I think you need to brush up on a

                    Another day, another manhunt.  

                          (beat)
                    There s something else we can throw 
                    into the mix.  The more I think 
                    about this guy, about the choices 
                                                                                              *
                    he s made, the way his mind works 
                                                                                              *
                    ... he really likes his history, 
                                                                                              *
                    it s not just something he s 
                    casually picked up.  And I m pretty 
                                                                                              **

                    He ll have used them before,

                            beat)
                    I think we should definitely look 
                    into that ... tomorrow.

      She smiles.  

                                  RUTH
                    You re right.  

      He turns to go, then has second thoughts about it and turns.

                                  ANDREW
                    I know it s late, but ... have you 
                    had dinner yet?

      She looks up at him.  He s asking her out.  She s tempted. 
      She checks her watch.

                                  RUTH
                    Can t imagine who would feed us at 
                    this hour.

                                  ANDREW
                    Well, if I may be so bold ... I 
                    make a pretty decent carbonara.

      She looks at him - the right offer at the right time.

                                  RUTH
                    Why not.

      Andrew smiles.

      INT. DANNY S FLAT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 4. 2300
6060

      Danny s home, sitting alone.  The doorbell rings.  He 
      shuffles over, looks through the peephole.  Sighs.  Opens the 
      door.  It s Will.  He walks back, raising his hands.  Will 
      follows.

                                  DANNY
                          (hardly thrilled)
                    Come on in ...

                                  WILL
                    Did you talk to them.

                                  DANNY
                    Yes.

                                  WILL
                    And ... ?

                                  DANNY
                    No deal.

                                  WILL
                          (shocked, in denial)
                    What?  You re not ...  no.  They 
                    wouldn t risk it.

                                  DANNY
                    You really have no idea who you re 
                    dealing with.

      He looks at him.  It s final.  Will nods.  His eyes harden.

                                  WILL
                    Fine.  

      He turns to leave.

                                  DANNY
                    You had to sign a piece of paper 
                    after you started seeing Zoe.  The 
                    Official Secrets Act.  Does that 
                    ring any bells? 

                                  WILL
                    I don t care.

                                  DANNY
                    Just forget about her.  She s 
                    probably better off anyway ... away 
                    from this insanity. 

                                  WILL
                    Is that what you re going to do?  
                    Forget about her?

      He turns to go again. Danny calls out after him

                                  DANNY
                    You ll just ruin your life.  And 
                    hers.

      Will stops.  Danny approaches him, hesitantly.

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                          (downbeat)
                    Talk to the press and all you ll do 
                    is make sure Zoe does end up 
                    spending ten years in some grotty 
                                                                                              *
                    cell at Brockhill.  Is that what 
                    you want?

      Will just looks at him.  The haunted look in his eyes leaves 
      no doubt about his knowing he s screwed.  He fixes Danny.

                                  WILL
                    I wonder what s given you more 
                    pleasure?  Telling her about the 
                    stolen pictures, or watching me 
                    here like this?
                          (beat)
                    If you really did love her, if you 
                    had any feelings for her, you d 
                    want her to be happy.  But that 
                    kind of selflessness is way beyond 
                    you people, isn t it?

                          (beat)
                    I don t know how you sleep at 
                    night.

      And he leaves.

      Danny just stares at the door.

                                  ADAM
                    Are you sure she s alright?

                                  BILL (O.S.)
                    She isn t due to come up for air 
                    for another seventeen hours.

                    Let me know when you hear from her, 
                    alright?

                                  BILL (O.S.)
                    Is anything wrong, Adam?

                                  ADAM
                    No.  Just let me know, will you?

                                  RUTH
                    That was just heavenly, Andrew.  
                    Thank you.

                                  ANDREW
                    It s a pleasure.

                    I have to tell you ... this house, 
                    the perfect carbonara ...  How is 
                    it you re still ... unattached.

                                  ANDREW
                    I could ask you the same thing.

      She smiles, chuffed.  Smirks.

                      Seriously.  How d you ever end up 
                    at GCHQ?  Someone with your talent.  
                    I d have imagined you cruising to 
                    your third floatation by now.  

                                  ANDREW
                    No.  Unfortunately, I ... I suppose 
                    I m not enough of an entrepreneur.  
                    Didn t have the killer instinct, 
                    you see.  

      Ruth just nods - she can see some hurt there and doesn t want 
      to explore further. 

                                  ANDREW (cont d)
                    That s all in the past.  I prefer 
                    to look ahead.

                    Really?  

                                  ANDREW
                    It s something I ve thought about a 
                    lot, and talking to you...

                                  RUTH
                          (pleasantly surprised)
                    What ... what are you going to do?

                                  ANDREW
                    I don t know.  See the world.  Find 
                    somewhere warm and slow.  Enjoy my

                    Sounds wonderful.

                                  ANDREW
                    The world ... it s all about greed 
                    now, it s all about lies and spin 
                    and corruption ... I don t want to 
                    have to think about that anymore.

                    Well when you find the spot, let me 
                    know.  

      He looks at her, pleased, but there s also pain in his eyes.  
      He raises his glass.

      He looks at her, something off in his look and suddenly, at 
      that very moment, it hits her.  She realizes it s him.  He s 
      behind the attacks.  He also realizes he s given it away, but 
      neither of them says anything for a beat.  Then she smiles 
      but she knows the game s up.

                                  RUTH (CONT D) (cont d)

      She reaches for her bag.  Andrew s calmly puts his hand on 
      hers, blocking her.  

                                  ANDREW
                    Don t.

      She looks into his eyes - it s that awful realization, her 
      mind rushing through different scenarios of what s about to 
      happen - then pulls away and gets up, rushing towards the 
      door.  

      He gets up, charges after her, she dodges a chair and flicks 
      it down behind her, he crashes onto it and gets up quickly, 
      flying after her, she s reaching into her bag, fumbling for 
      her phone, manages to fish it out.

                    He wants me to go to the roof. 

      He jumps into action, Malcolm stops him and hands him SHINY 
      BLACK GLOVES to put on.  He slips them on, grabs the 
      briefcase, and rushes out of the room.

                                  HARRY
                    I want all exits to the building

      Adam emerges on the roof.  It s quiet, no one there.

      The roof goes dark as the lights are killed.  Motors and 
      ventilation fans WHINE and CLUNK shut as the power cuts out 
      across the building.

      Darkness.  Voices scurrying around, a couple of flashlights 
      lighting up ...

      Adam looks around, then hears something.  A batting of 
      blades, and a faint buzz.  He squints, looks out.  In the

      Thames House, the roof.

      Now Adam sees it.  It s a small REMOTE CONTROLLED HELICOPTER.

      Danny finds Ruth.  Tied where she was, looking worn-down but 
                                                                                              *
      alive.  

      On the floor facing her, his arms outstretched towards her in 
      death - the body of Andrew.  And scattered on the floor 
      around him:  the diamonds.

      Danny quickly unties Ruth.  She sobs as he takes her in his 
      arms.

      INT. DANNY S FLAT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 7. 0700
109109

      A new day.  Morning.  Danny emerging, bleary eyed.  Shuffles 
      over to the kitchen, as we saw him early in the show.

      He s about to go behind the counter when he spots the mail by 
      the door.  Something grabs his attention.  

      He walks over, picks them up, finds the one he s spotted.

      CLOSE:  It s a postcard.  Innocuous, from Chile.  Very 
      touristy.  

      He turns it over.  It says simply:  Thanks .  

      He looks at it more closely, and gets it.  He peels off the 
      front.  There s a hidden picture underneath.
