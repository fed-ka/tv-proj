      CLOSE SHOT on A WINDOW in an imposing EDWARDIAN TOWER 
      BLOCK. A WOMAN is there in PYJAMAS nursing a MUG of TEA - 
      Kay - 31 years old, cropped hair - a face which has known 
      more pain than pleasure. 

                                  KAY (V.O.)
                    If you go to the cinema mid way 
                    through a film, you watch the 
                    second half first, don t you? So 
                    you see how the characters end up 
                    in the story - 
                          (then)
                    What happened to turn them into 
                    the people they would became - 
                    it s like a riddle you have to 
                    solve...

      CAPTION: 1947



      WORKMEN stacking SCAFFOLDING and BRICKS - Kay emerges from 
      the entrance of the FLATS, wearing mannish tailored slacks, 
      a jacket, her cropped hair licked down, walking shoes.  

      She stands a moment as if uncertain what direction to take - 
      sets off.



      A blur of PEDESTRIANS purposefully pushing to work.  The 
      figure of Kay approaches in the opposite direction - as 
      though she is out of sync with the rest of world - 



      The grumble of traffic, the clatter of more WORKMEN mending 
      roofs. A NEWS BOY shouts -   Ration book fraud - read all 
      about it!  

      Kay approaches up the road - something of the sleep walker 
      about her.                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       2.


      She passes a shabby YELLOW DOOR - a sign - WEST END 
        INTRODUCTION AGENCY -



      A FIRE-ESCAPE GANTRY outside the office window - Viv and 
      Helen sit dangling stockinged feet, sharing a cigarette.  

                                  VIV
                    What about our Forest Hill lady?

                                  HELEN
                    He s after someone younger. 

                                  VIV
                    Aren t they all?
                          (then)
                    I had one this morning. Ex-RAF, 
                    married the girl next door, comes 
                    home to a peroxide blonde chasing 
                    anything in trousers.

                                  HELEN
                    War changes people. Not always 
                    for the better.

      She says it like a statement of fact. A reflective silence 
      now: the sound of banging and reconstruction beyond-

                                  HELEN (CONT D)
                    What is it they re building over 
                    there anyway?

                                  VIV
                    More shops I think. Or offices.

                                  HELEN
                    ...You know what I wanted to be 
                    before the war? A stable girl! 
                    Can you believe it? Ever since I 
                    was a kid, it s all I wanted to 
                    do.  I had an imaginary horse 
                    called Fleet - I used to trot up 
                    and down the road making clippety 
                    clop noises. 
                          (then)
                    God knows what Freud would make 
                    of it.

      They laugh: Helen stubs out her cigarette.

                                  HELEN (CONT D)
                    Our two oclock will be along.  
                    Better see if we ve got anyone 
                    suitable.

      She s about to climb back through the window - 

                                  VIV
                    FOREVER AMBER is on at the Odeon.  
                    We should go one evening.  
                                  (MORE)                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       4.

                                  VIV (CONT'D)
                    I ll bring my brother, he could 
                    do with a night out. 
                          (then)
                    - And you can bring your chap. 
                    About time I got to meet him.

      A flicker in Helen s face - quickly camouflaged.

                                  HELEN
                    Sounds like fun.

      She swiftly clambers through the window.  Viv sits a 
      moment, cigarette in hand.   O.S. the sound of a wolf 
      whistle  Need some company up there, love?  

      Viv, smiling, momentarily gratified: but the moment passes - 
      her smile fades - a strangely haunted look replaces it.



      Modest Victorian terrace, drably respectable. The front 
      door opens, Duncan and Viv emerge. She briskly kisses him.

                                  VIV
                    See you next week.

      She starts to go, then turns back -

                                  VIV (CONT D)
                    - Even if you can t come home, 
                    Duncan, can you not at least find 
                    people your own age to live with?  
                          (sotto)
                    I mean, it s not like you owe him 
                    anything.  It s just not... 
                    healthy.

      She goes.  He uneasily watches her.  Mundy joins him, rests 
      a hand on his shoulder. 



      Falling light - Viv peering at her reflection in a shop 
      window, applying lipstick.  Signs in the window  NO 
      POTATOES.  NO FRUIT. 

      O.S. a CAR HORN toots:  A CAR pulls up by the kerb.  She 
      crosses to it - a rakishly handsome man at the wheel - the 
      glint of a gold tooth - a smile you could drown in - 

                                  REGGIE
                    Hello, gorgeous.

                                  VIV
                    How long do we have?


      EXT -DISUSED AMBULANCE STATION - LONDON - EVENING 19471313

      Padlocked weather stained GARAGE DOORS: a peeling sign 
      adjacent - DISTRICT 9, AUXILIARY AMBULANCE SERVICE. 

      WIDEN SHOT to reveal - a cobbled MEWS street - the ghostly 
      figure of Kay appears through the mist - she halts at the 
      mouth of the MEWS.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       8.


      Her gaze rests on the LOCKED GARAGE DOORS - sudden 
      confliction in her face - paralysed by the memories it 
      evokes.

      They prove too much - she hastens away - 



      A BACK DOOR to a SHABBY HOTEL. A parked VAN parked nearby 
      bearing an insignia  LONDON LAUNDRY COMPANY . Duncan, 
      wearing a grubby KITCHEN APRON, is loading crates of DIRTY 
      LINEN into it. 

      A YOUNG MAN approaches up the ALLEY beyond: checking 
      doorways. An easy confidence about him, hair longer than is 
      the fashion, an open necked shirt, tweed jacket - FRASER.  
      He halts, seeing Duncan.  A moment before he speaks -

                                  FRASER
                    ...Hello Duncan.

      Duncan spins to face him - scalded in recognition -

                                  DUNCAN
                      ...Fraser.

      Fraser crosses to grab his hand - pump it - punching his 
      shoulder with his other hand.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       10.


                                  FRASER
                    They said at front desk I d find 
                    you here... You ve not changed 
                    one iota! Not one bit!  

      Duncan, trying to gather himself -

                                  DUNCAN
                    ...How did you know where to -

                                  FRASER
                    - I went back to the Scrubs, 
                    chatted up a secretary in the 
                    parole office. She said to try 
                    here -

      Glancing at the HOTEL exterior -

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                    Hardly the Ritz is it?

                                  DUNCAN
                    I wasn t exactly spoilt for 
                    choice.

      Fraser briefly meets his eyes. He takes out a cigarette 
      case, offers Duncan one, cupping his hand around the 
      lighter flame.  Duncan, compelled by his proximity. 

                                  FRASER
                    ...She said you got out just 
                    after me. 

                                  DUNCAN
                    Six months after.

      Their gaze briefly locks again.

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    I never thought you d come 
                    looking for me --

                                  FRASER 
                    -- I wanted to see how you were 
                    getting on...
                          (then)
                    Give me your phone number, we can 
                    meet, catch up properly.

                                  DUNCAN
                    ...I m not on the phone.

      Fraser uncertain if this is an evasion - it doesn t deter 
      him. Duncan has a stub of PENCIL behind one ear.  Fraser 
      reaches to pluck it down, takes a scrap of paper from a 
      pocket - scribbles on it -                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       11.


                                  FRASER
                    - My address, phone number. Call 
                    or drop round, whatever suits.

      He hands Duncan the scrap of paper, replaces the PENCIL 
      behind his ear.  The familiarity of this impacts on Duncan -

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                    Don t leave it too long, okay?

      He starts to go, turns back -

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                    Glad I found you, Duncan. You ve 
                    been on my mind a lot.  
                          (then)
                    Call me!

      He goes.  Duncan gazing after him, splintered hope in his 
      face now.  



      - Sunlight splintering through trees - Viv gazing up at 
      them as Reggie s sports car races down country roads - 

      She s striking in a floral cotton dress, a silk scarf tied 
      beneath her chin. He puts his hand on her knee, slides it 
      up her thigh.  She playfully slaps it away, gazes back up 
      at the awning of trees overhead -



      A vista of fields fringed by trees.  Reggie chasing Viv 
      over the field. He catches her - twirls her in his arms.

                                                                          CUT TO

      Reggie and Viv stretched out on a rug, a FLASK of TEA and 
      SANDWICHES there.   He is grazing her arm with a blade of 
      grass.   He looks up at the sky.  A KESTREL circles there -

                                  REGGIE
                    See that? Kestrel.  Bird of prey.  
                    He s seen a mouse or -

                                  VIV
                    He can see a mouse from up there?

                                  REGGIE
                    He can see everything.

       He pulls over his KNAPSACK - pulls out a bottle of BEER.                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       12.


                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    The first place we ever went to 
                    together remember?  When I was 
                    home on leave that time -

      She doesn t respond.

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    ...You know it s coming up for 
                    six years for us? 

      He rests his hand on her knee -

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    When I first saw you on that 
                    train, it was like I d been 
                    carrying your face in my head all 
                    my life.  That I made you come to 
                    life, just by wishing it.
                          (a different tone)
                    I thought if I could make you 
                    real, maybe I could wish the crap 
                    in the rest of my life away too - 

      He reaches for her hand, spreads her fingers, kissing her 
      palm - sudden cogency in him now.

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    You re my life raft, Viv. It s 
                    only you keeps me afloat. 
                          (then)
                    If you hadn t forgiven me...  If 
                    you d walked out of my life...  
                          (beat)
                    I d have no life.  Not one worth 
                    living.

      She touched by this, but conflicted also. He kisses her:

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    My love, precious girl... 

      She, the urgency of his need touches her also -

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    God I forget how soft your skin 
                    is -

                                  VIV
                    Reggie - we can t - not out here -

                                  REGGIE
                    My dearest love - let me in  
                    please - 

      She, still conflicted. She slides a hand into his flies, 
      starts to masturbate him.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       13.


                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    Oh God, oh yes...

      He, his arousal escalating -

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    Say you ll never leave me - 
                    promise you ll never leave? ---

      She looks up - the Kestrel is still relentlessly circling 
      above them - all seeing and all knowing - 



      Reggie s car, halted at lights.  He, his composure 
      restored. He glances at Viv -

                                  REGGIE
                    Prezzie for you ...

      He gestures to the glove box. She takes out a TIN OF 
      PEACHES.

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    Peaches for a peach.

      She musters a smile. The lights change. Reggie is about to 
      pull off when A FIGURE strides into the road ahead.

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    Oy, watch it, Mister!

      The FIGURE glances towards the car - it s Kay.

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    Oops.  Miss I should say.

      Viv, skewing to look back at Kay as they drive off -

                                  VIV
                    Stop the car!  ...Stop!

      He brakes in alarm. She scrabbles for the door handle -

                                  REGGIE
                    What is it?

                                  VIV
                    I know her!  I m sure I do!

      She s out of it, doubling back after Kay -                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       14.



      Viv, skidding to a halt, scanning the street - inexplicable 
      rising distress in her now - there s no sign of Kay -  it s 
      like she was never there.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      Reggie, in the car, fingers impatiently rippling on the 
      steering wheel.   Viv returns - still fighting emotion - 
      reaches for her BAG. 

                                  VIV
                    You go on. I ll get the tube from 
                    here. 

      He, trying to fathom what s going on with her. She starts 
      to go - the tin of PEACHES is on the passenger seat -

                                  REGGIE
                    Don t forget your -

      She, tears spilling now - 

                                  VIV
                    ...Give them to your wife!

      She spins off.  His face -



      Falling light - an EDWARDIAN BUILDING split into flats.

      A WOMAN walks approaches - early thirties, a tumble of red 
      hair: once a head turner but an unkempt abstraction about 
      her now. This is NANCY.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       15.


      She s about to mount the steps to the FLATS - halts.  A 
      FIGURE sits there - it s Kay - Nancy halts in recognition - 

                                  NANCY
                    Glory be. Finally.

                                  KAY
                    ...Better late than never.

      A beat.

                                  NANCY
                    Two years late.  I swore, if you 
                    ignored my last letter, it would 
                    be the last I d send.  I d give 
                    you up as a lost cause.

      She steps forward, opens her arms -

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                    Tardy bitch.

      Kay concedes to the embrace - she is unused to human 
      contact - but cannot help reciprocating -



      - HOTEL WORKERS emerging from the hotel back door - Duncan 
      is trailing them. His face illuminates.  

      Fraser lounges against a wall opposite, waiting for him.



      A blur of raucous drinkers, some in UNIFORM, sitting on 
      BENCHES outside a BEAMED PUB.  The sound of music emanating 
      from the pub beyond.

      Duncan and Fraser at one of the benches, nursing beers.  
      Duncan is rolling a cigarette, he holds out the cigarette 
      to Fraser who lights it.  They glance at a nearby table - a 
      SOLDIER nearby is necking with A GIRL -

                                  FRASER
                    Ten to one he won t remember her 
                    name in the morning.

      A shared smile.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Do you ever think about it?  
                    ...The Scrubs, our life there?

                                  FRASER
                    Life?  Living death more like. 

      This wasn t the answer Duncan was hoping for.  He deflects:

                                  DUNCAN
                    How was it for you, after you got 
                    out?                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       19.


                                  FRASER
                    I sort of lost my bearings. It 
                    was like I d been plucked out of 
                    my own life into someone else s -  
                    I didn t know which way was up. 

      Duncan, this resonates with him.

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                    - I had to get away - I did a 
                    stint up North for a refugee 
                    charity.  Salving my conscience 
                    you might say.  
                          (then)
                    Jews mostly, from all over 
                    Europe...  God, what those people 
                    went through.  They told me 
                    terrible things, things you 
                    wouldn t believe human beings 
                    could do to each other. ...But 
                    they told me marvellous things 
                    too.  The unexpected goodness of 
                    people...  Their courage and -
                          (beat)
                    I started writing down their 
                    stories, sent them off to 
                      newspapers. I struck lucky, West 
                    London Gazette took me on as a 
                    reporter.

      Duncan, impressed by this - Fraser catches his expression.

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                    Nothing earth shattering - local 
                    stories mostly.  Pieces on local 
                    industry, Britain getting back on 
                    her feet, the old Bulldog spirit, 
                    all that malarky. 
                          (then)
                    Anyway, it s you I want to hear 
                    about.  How s that sister of 
                    yours doing?

      Duncan flashes him a look.

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                      I remember her from the prison 
                    visits.  ...Viv, isn t it?

                                  DUNCAN
                    She works in Soho now, one of 
                    those introduction agencies. I 
                    forget the name.

      Fraser, assimilating this.                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       20.


                                  FRASER
                    You still live at home with she 
                    and your Dad?

                                  DUNCAN
                          (dissents)
                    ...I m in digs just round the 
                    corner, off Wood Lane.

                                  FRASER
                    So near the Scrubs?  God, half 
                    the reason I left London was to 
                    get away from the stench of that 
                    bloody place.
                          (beat)
                    You should do the same, make a 
                    fresh start somewhere. Nothing to 
                    keep you here is there?

      Duncan makes no comment.

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                          (intrigued)
                    Ah-hah, so there is someone to 
                    keep you here?  You ll have to 
                    ask me back so I can meet them.

      Duncan, uneasy now. Fraser picks up on this -

                                  FRASER (CONT D)
                    I ll worm it out of you 
                      eventually.  Coaxing information 
                    out of people is my stock in 
                    trade now. I never take no for an 
                    answer. 
                          (beat)
                    Top up?

      He takes Duncan s glass, retreats to enter the pub. 

      Duncan, his unease escalating. He makes a decision, rises, 
      heads for the exit.  

      Fraser, about to enter the pub is forced to step back out 
      to allow AN INEBRIATED SOLDIER to emerge; he glances over, 
      catching sight of Duncan s retreating figure -



      - Duncan, sprinting down the road like the hounds of hell 
      are after him.  Fraser emerging into the street beyond -  

                                  FRASER
                      ...Duncan?  Duncan!

      He sets off after him -                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       21.



      The ominous contours of the PRISON capped with BARBED WIRE. 
      Duncan running passed it. 

      Fraser rounds the corner after him - 



      Duncan, running up the street, Fraser a breathless distance 
      behind. Duncan swings inside Mundy s house.

      Fraser halts to catch his breath - suddenly Mundy emerges 
      from the house, to place milk bottles on the step. 

      Fraser - scalded in recognition -



      The familiar yellow door of the INTRODUCTION AGENCY.  
      Fraser is hovering outside it -

                                  HELEN (O.S.)
                    How about this one?  Twenty six 
                    years old, ex Commando, awarded 
                    the Victoria Cross -



      - Kay, pushing down the side street - Viv running behind -

                                  VIV
                    Wait, please?

      Kay halts, turns.  Viv breathlessly reaches her.

                                  VIV (CONT D)
                    I knew it was you...

      Kay, trying to place her -

                                  VIV (CONT D)
                    Do you not remember me?  ...You 
                    did me a great kindness in the 
                    war.  You loaned me this? - 

      She pulls the RING off -

                                  VIV (CONT D)
                    I saw you near here last week. 
                    I ve been back every day, hoping 
                    to find you.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       26.


      A beat.

                                  KAY
                    You shouldn t have gone to the 
                    trouble.  ...I d forgotten all 
                    about it.

                                  VIV
                    I ll never forget it. Or what you 
                    did for me.

      This impacts on Kay. Their eyes briefly lock.  Viv quickly 
      kisses her.

                                  VIV (CONT D)
                    God bless you! 

      She spins around, goes.  Kay watches her - she looks down 
      at the RING - emotion she had long since buried surfaces -



      A marmalade haze of twilight.  Reggie is on a PARK BENCH -  

      He glances impatiently at his watch -


      TELEPHONE BOX - REGENTS PARK/VIV S HOUSE- EARLY EVE 19473737

      Reggie, pressing BUTTON A: 

                                  VIV (O.S. INTO PHONE)
                    Streatham 212?

                                  REGGIE (INTO PHONE)
                    Where are you, love?  I m here 
                    waiting for you! -

      Viv, in her HALL, phone in hand - turmoil there. She 
      carefully replaces the receiver.  

      She glances into the sitting room: her father is cleaning 
      the SILVER.  She reaches for her coat - quietly exits.  



      - A POSTER for FOREVER AMBER - a blur of people exiting 
      from the cinema - Kay is among them -

      She starts walking - O.S. AN AMBULANCE SIREN wails - she 
      halts listening to it.  It triggers something in her. She 
      turns back to go the opposite way  - she has a new 
      direction in mind - a purpose to her gait now -



      Lengthening shadows of the encroaching night. The PADLOCKED 
      Ambulance station doors.  O.S. the sound of footsteps. 

      Kay approaches. She halts by the padlocked doors, 
      impotently rattles them - wipes dust from the window, peers 
      inside. 

      She stands gazing at the locked doors as if they hold the 
      answer to an unspoken question. 

      A KALEIDOSCOPE OF IMAGES as we REWIND back in time - Kay 
      outside Nancy s flat - Duncan cleaning the clock dial - 
      Helen fighting with Julia - Viv with Fraser in the cafe -                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       32.


      THE PACE ACCELERATES - STACCATO FLASHING IMAGES - Kay 
      walking the streets - Viv and Helen in the dating agency - 
      HURTLING DEEPER INTO THE PAST - Kay at the wheel of an 
      Ambulance - Kay and Nancy trying to extinguish incendiaries 
      - Kay carried the dead body of a CHILD - Helen twirling in 
    red silk Pyjamas - Duncan cowering in his prison cell -  
    THE DIZZY ARRAY OF IMAGES screeches to a sudden halt -       



      The familiar cobbled street - the doors of the Ambulance 
      station - no longer neglected and padlocked but open and 
      functional - A PARKED AMBULANCE outside - another pulls up - 
      Kay alights in AMBULANCE CREW uniform - now aged 28 - a 
      mane of swept up hair - Nancy is with her.  She too looks 
      different, in spite of the uniform, a coiffured elegance 
      about her.

 CAPTION: THREE YEARS EARLIER - 1944



      A modest HOTEL: an illuminated VACANCY SIGN.   The kind of 
      place frequented by TRAVELLING SALESMEN before the war.

      Viv checks the hotel name - veiled anticipation about her -



      TWO AMBULANCES driving down an uncannily deserted street -
      O.S. the clatter of AK-AK GUNS - the ominous drone of ENEMY 
      AIRCRAFT.  Search lights sweep the sky. 

      Kay is at the wheel of the first ambulance, Nancy beside 
      her. Nancy is navigating with a street map and a torch.  
      Both wear helmets, their hair tucked inside them.

                                  NANCY
                    I booked us into the Grand at 
                    Brighton for his next leave - I d 
                    say for a second honeymoon except 
                    we never got to have a first one - 
                          (flinching)
                    Oh Jesus!                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       40.


      A shower of INCENDIARY BOMBS descends ahead, detonating 
      into fire bombs as they hit the ground.  Kay swerves to 
      avoid them - she slams on the brakes.  

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                    Come on, Kay - not again!

      But Kay is already signalling to Hughes in the second 
      ambulance to slow down.

                                  KAY
                          (shouting)
                    Go on ahead - we ll catch you up!

      She scrambles out of the ambulance - darts to a pile of 
      SANDBAGS, drags one over - drops it onto a fizzing, 
      frothing incendiary - 

                                  NANCY
                          (resigned)
                    Hells bells!

      She gets out - the two of them haul more sandbags to 
      extinguish the shoal of smouldering incendiaries littering 
      the street.  RESIDENTS appear out of the dark to help, zig-
      zagging around the street like crazy Whirling Dervishes - 



      Hughes at the wheel, Kay clambers in, he fires the engine:

                                  HUGHES
                    Maybe you are a bloody hero, 
                    letting O Neill off the hook that 
                    way.

      Kay: she knows it cost him to admit this. 

                                  KAY
                    Your engine is pinking. You 
                    should check the ignition.

      He flicks her a wry look - shoves the ambulance into gear - 



      VICTORIAN terraced houses. The strobe of POLICE LIGHTS, 
      NEIGHBOURS in night clothes clustered outside a HOUSE - 

      Hughes and Kay pull up in the AMBULANCE - A POLICE RESERVE 
      approaches - Kay winds down her window -                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       42.


                                  POLICE MAN
                    Direct hit on an Anderson 
                    shelter. We think now it was four 
                    kiddies, more limbs than we can 
                    account for.

      Hughes and Kay exchange a look -



      A Bruegal nightmare - shifting beams of TORCHES in an 
      overgrown rear garden. A vast crater is all that remains of 
      the ANDERSON SHELTER. Shards of CORRUGATED IRON and debris 
      hang from bushes -  A RAG DOLL amongst them. POLICE, and 
      ARP WARDENS search the undergrowth for REMAINS and BODY 
      PARTS. A YOUNG POLICE RESERVE is vomiting by the fence. 

      Kay appears out of the darkness carrying the armless body 
      of a CHILD.  She takes it over to Hughes, who helps lower 
      it onto a stretcher.  On another stretcher is the bloodied 
      dismembered torso of the MOTHER.  

      Kay trudges back down the garden, crossing a POLICE MAN 
      carrying a bloodied sheet around several CHILDREN S LIMBS -



      Tendrils of marmalade light smearing the night sky - O.S. 
      the fragile refrain of a dawn chorus - 



      - The dappled surface of the LAKE. Kay and Helen on a BENCH 
      by beside it in the PARK, sharing A FLASK and lunchtime 
      SANDWICHES.

      Kay - gazing at the lake - she looks up at the sunlight 
      filtering through the trees above them -

                                  KAY
                    I feel like one of those animals 
                    who only come out in the dark.  
                          (then)
                    The daylight scares them.

                                  HELEN
                    Nothing scares you, Kay.

      She says it simply, like a statement of fact.

                                  KAY
                    At night it doesn t.  I m someone 
                    else then.  
                          (beat)
                      I sometimes think I only started 
                    living when the war started...

      Helen glances at her -

                                  KAY (CONT D)
                      ...You know, grabbing happiness 
                    where you can, all that.  
                          (then)
                    Like blowing a raspberry in the 
                    face of chance.

                                  HELEN
                          (wry)
                    Is that what I am?  Your 
                      raspberry?

      Kay s gaze rests on her.

                                  KAY
                    You re my spoils of war, my love.  
                          (beat)
                    Finding you that night, amid all 
                    that devastation and...

      The memory overcomes her - tears threaten. She reaches to 
      touch Helen s face. Helen flinches - public displays of 
      affection unnerve her.

                                  KAY (CONT D)
                          (rueful)
                    That s why I hate the daylight.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       45.



      -  Julia, hair swept up in a turban, wearing dusty 
      dungarees walking up the path.  In spite of her attire, she 
      still looks striking.  She freezes, catching sight of Kay 
      and Helen crossing the grass to join the path, laughing 
      together - 

      Kay - her laughter draining as she too sees Julia.

                                  JULIA
                    Hello stranger. 

                                  KAY
                    ...Julia.

      Helen, curiously looking between them.

                                  KAY (CONT D)
                    You remember Julia?  We bumped 
                    into her at that Red Cross do at 
                      Christmas?

                                  HELEN
                    Of course, yes. ...Hello.

      An hiatus of mutual awkwardness.  She and Kay fall into 
      step with Julia walking along the path to the PARK ENTRANCE 
      - Julia slides a look at Kay -

                                  JULIA
                    Your hair is different.

      Kay makes no comment. 

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    I like it.

      She becomes aware of Helen watching her -

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                          (to Helen)
                    Do you work round here?

                                  HELEN
                    Town Hall, Housing Department, 
                      relocating bomb victims ...And 
                    you?

                                  JULIA
                    Helping survey bomb damaged 
                      buildings. Speed up 
                      reconstruction if and when this 
                    bloody war ever ends.

      They all walk on a moment:                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       46.


                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                          (to Kay)
                    I suppose you re still doing your 
                    trusty Ambulance bit every night? 
                          (to Helen: light)
                    Gets lonely, doesn t it?

      Helen, disconcerted at her insight. Kay deftly deflecting -

                                  KAY
                          (to Julia)
                    - How s the writing?  

                                  JULIA
                    Seems irrelevant frankly. Not to 
                    say pointless. So many terrible 
                    things going on in Europe - 

                                  HELEN
                    People still need entertaining, 
                    don t they?  Somewhere to escape. 
                    Now more than ever.

      Julia, surprised at her perspicacity. They ve reached the 
      PARK GATES now -

                                  KAY
                    Which way do you -

                                  JULIA
                    - Lavern Road.   
                          (to Helen)
                    We must meet up for lunch 
                    sometime, since we re close by.

                                  HELEN
                          (polite)
                    I d like that.

      Kay, watching their interaction. Julia turns to her -

                                  JULIA
                     Good seeing you again, Kay.

      She quickly strides off; they stand watching her -

                                  HELEN
                    ...Why will you never talk about 
                    what went wrong between you?

      Kay glances at her -

                                  HELEN (CONT D)
                    Whenever I ask about her, you 
                    change the subject. Don t pretend 
                      otherwise, Kay, because you do. 

      Kay concedes defeat.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       47.


                                  KAY
                    It was a  misaffection  that s 
                    all.

      Helen, puzzled.

                                  KAY (CONT D)
                    What we felt for each other 
                    wasn t entirely ...equal. 
                          (then)
                    That s how I know it s right with 
                    us.

      She kisses her fingers, touches Helen s lips with them - 
      sets off in the opposite direction to Julia. A moment later 
      she turns, her hand raised to wave at Helen: she s still 
      halted, looking at something.  

      Kay follows her gaze: she is fixed on the distantly 
      retreating figure of Julia. 

      Kay, a stab of unease there without knowing why.



      Julia, in dungarees, a scarf tied round her hair, sitting 
      on a wall outside the town hall smoking a cigarette.  

      Helen emerges. Julia flicks aside her cigarette, jumps off 
      the wall.

                                  JULIA
                    - I hope you like rabbit.

      Helen s face -



        A scattering of PEOPLE - many in uniforms. Helen and Julia 
      sit on a RUG under a tree - laughing - engrossed in each 
      other s company - Helen mesmerized by Julia s bright 
      lipsticks - her fluttering expressive hands - 

      Julia pours TEA from a flask, hands over a SANDWICH -                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       54.


                                  HELEN
                    Is it really rabbit?

                                  JULIA
                    My neighbour claims they re 
                    running wild all over London. 
                          (then)
                    He says he saw one on a platform 
                    at Victoria station the other 
                    day. Apparently it was fearfully 
                    het up. Kept looking at its 
                    pocket watch, saying it was late.

      Helen bursts out laughing - Julia glances at her, 
      captivated by her.

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    ...Things are going well for you 
                    and Kay, are they?  

      Helen flicks her a look, nods. Julia takes out her 
      cigarettes - offers one to Helen who declines.  TWO ATS 
      OFFICERS pass by - 

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    God, this passion everyone has 
                    now to parade around in uniform 
                    even off duty. As if war gives 
                    them a status they otherwise lack-

                                  HELEN
                    - They re just proud to wear 
                    them, surely?

      Julia, rueful.

                                  JULIA
                    I have a tendency towards 
                    cynicism.  ...It used to drive 
                    Kay mad.  I should be more 
                    generous and well adjusted, like 
                    you.

                                  HELEN
                    Me, well adjusted?  Hardly.

      Julia slides her a look.

                                  JULIA
                    You seem to handle the whole 
                    grisly  L  business pretty well.

                                  HELEN
                    ...I m still not used to it yet 
                    to be honest.  ...I mean, I never 
                    really thought about it before I 
                    met Kay.  It just never 
                      ...occurred to me.
                                  (MORE)                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       55.

                                  HELEN (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    From the moment we met, she was 
                    so certain we were meant to be 
                    together.  She said I was her 
                    destiny.

      She s said more than she intended; Julia, intently watching 
      her.

                                  HELEN (CONT D)
                    I ve enjoyed this - it s made a 
                    nice change.

      A beat.

                                  JULIA
                    I d forgotten, how underrated the 
                    word nice is. 

      Their eyes meet.



      Julia and Helen reaching the park entrance.  Helen puts out 
      her hand -

                                  HELEN
                    We must do it again.

                                  JULIA
                    I hope so.

      Their hands clasp - they turn to go - Julia turns back - 
      calls out -

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    Oh, if you ever need company when 
                    Kay s off doing her ambulance 
                    thing...  I m in the book.

      Their gaze briefly locks - she goes - leaving Helen gazing 
      after her like someone marooned on a beach when the tide 
      has gone out. 



      Through a glass darkly - or the stained glass window into 
      the downstairs hall.  

      The tormented figure of Viv, telephone in hand, struggling 
      for composure as she breaks her news to Reggie - 



      Viv, pacing on a street corner: pallid dread about her.   
      Reggie breathlessly approaches -

                                  REGGIE
                    Sorry - damn tube s up the spout.

      He pulls something from a pocket. 

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    Before I forget.  

      It s a cheap GOLD RING: he slides it on her finger.

                                  VIV
                    It s too big, Reggie!

                                  REGGIE
                    It s only for show, isn t it?

      She, fighting trepidation.  He takes her arm, steers her 
      down the road, checking out house numbers.  He halts at a 
      door.  A BRASS PLAQUE there - DENTAL SURGERY - he rings a 
      bell.  A moment later a spectacled, middle aged man opens 
      the door, wearing a dental gown.

                                  REGGIE (CONT D)
                    Mr and Mrs. Harrison?

      Imrie steps aside, scans the street, quickly closes the 
      door behind them.



      The cobbled MEWS - the DOORS to the ambulance station open, 
      the AMBULANCES parked within: a sign adjacent - AUXILIARY 
      AMBULANCE SERVICE. 

      The hood of one of the AMBULANCES is open: Kay is stooped 
      over the engine with Hughes.  She hears footsteps, glances 
      up:  Nancy is there, a grief laden defiance about her.  

                                  NANCY
                    Don t you dare say I shouldn t be 
                    here.  

      Kay, about to approach her -  Nancy halts her. 

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                    No sympathy!  I can t deal with 
                    it yet -

      She pushes into the station.  Hughes and Kay exchange a 
      glance.



      A TAXI pulls up outside the hotel, Reggie and Viv alight. 
      She leans on him weakly: a waxy, ashen pallor to her.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       62.


                                  REGGIE
                          (forced gaiety)
                    Home sweet home, eh?



      - Reggie, pacing and smoking outside the hotel.  He stamps 
      the cigarette out, skews his head listening - distantly, 
      the sound of AN AMBULANCE SIREN -

      He pushes a hand through his hair in confliction.  The 
      siren is getting closer. 

      He runs down the street - to be swallowed by the night.



      - The AMBULANCE hurtling down the deserted city streets, 
      siren blaring.  Nancy is at the wheel -



      The drone of AIR RAID SIRENS dying into the night - the 
      quivering beam of a torch,  Helen hurtling along with it - 
      she casts the torch beam onto HOUSE NUMBERS, halts at one.  
      She goes to the front door, beams the torch onto an array 
      of BELLS. 

      The door opens, startling her.  Julia is there, in a hat 
      and coat - she too is startled seeing Helen there.

                                  JULIA
                    Is it Kay?  Did something happen?

      Helen dissents.

                                  HELEN
                    I m taking you at your word - if 
                    I needed company?

      Their eyes briefly meet.

                                  JULIA
                    I prefer to be out in the open 
                    when there s a raid. I can t 
                    breathe in that bloody shelter -

                                  HELEN
                    - I m the same.

      She feels like she s on the edge of a precipice suddenly - 
      Julia pulls the door closed, ignites her torch.

                                  JULIA
                    Which way?                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       67.


                                  HELEN
                    You choose.

      Julia scans the darkened street.  They set off -



      A star strewn night sky, the sweep of search lights.  Two 
      torch beams quivering in the dark: the girls halt looking 
      at the sky.

                                  HELEN
                    It s like they re putting on a 
                    display just for us.

      Julia shouts at the sky, clapping and applauding -

                                  JULIA
                    Bravo!  Encore!

      Helen giggles.  They hear sounds, swing their torches onto 
      a wasteland of bomb rubble ahead.  A FOX is there, 
        motionlessly gazing at them.  The women exchange a smile of 
      complicity - set off once more -

                                                                          CUT TO:

      - Helen and Julia, now crossing the street.  A CYCLIST 
      comes out of nowhere - veers around them - 

                                    CYCLIST 
                    You got a death wish?  Wear 
                    something white - make yourself 
                    visible!

                                  JULIA
                          (calling to him)
                    Maybe we like being invisible!

      Helen s face.



      The dome of ST. PAUL S against the brooding canopy of night 
      sky - Julia and Helen beneath it, gazing up at it. 

                                  JULIA
                    After a raid, the first thing 
                    everyone asks is did St. Paul s 
                    make it?  Never mind the scores 
                    of families bombed to oblivion, 
                    so long as the symbol of our 
                      illustrious past survives.                      THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       68.


                                  HELEN
                    It reminds us why we re fighting, 
                    doesn t it? - 

      Julia glances at her.

                                  HELEN (CONT D)
                    - It s our history isn t it?  
                    ...Isn t that what we re 
                      defending?

                                  JULIA
                    And isn t that how Hitler 
                    justifies his actions too?  To 
                    preserve their culture and the 
                    rest of it? We like to think 
                    altruism and love are what define 
                    human nature. But savagery and 
                    hatred are part of it too.  In a 
                    war, that part of us wins.

                                  HELEN
                    Not always. Sometimes it can give 
                    you courage you never knew you 
                    had.

      Their eyes meet - on impulse Helen leans forward - kisses 
      Julia fully on the lips - they pull apart - gaze at each 
      other in the darkness -

      Julia extends a hand - Helen clasps it.



      Distantly a symphony of ACK ACK - Helen and Julia hastening 
      up another darkened street.  A bombed CHURCH is ahead - 



      The sweep of searchlights - the battery of ACK ACK and 
      bombs - the terror fuelled screams of PRISONERS within -



      Swirling dust - burning mountains of timber and mortar - 
      ATS, POLICE RESERVES, FIREMEN and distraught RELATIVES 
      pulling aside debris - a howl of anguish from one as the 
      bloodied corpse of a bomb victim is revealed -                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       73.


      Kay is feverishly scrabbling in the wreckage also - she 
      glimpses something - frantically flings aside debris - it s 
      a torn shred of red silk from the PYJAMAS she gave Helen -

      - She drops to her knees - scrabbling in the rubble - 
      eventually stooping - as distress and despair engulf her - 

      - A shout alerts her -  Kay?  FIGURES are approaching 
      through the mist - recognition splinters her distress -

                                  KAY
                    Oh thank God! Oh dear God!  

      She s weeping now - holding out her arms to Helen -

                                  KAY (CONT D)
                    ..I thought you were gone!  I 
                    thought I d lost you! 

      She struggles through the rubble to clasp her.  Then 
      becomes aware of a figure in the mist beyond - 

      - It s Julia - glistening defiance in her expression -

      Bafflement in Kay s face -giving way to brutal realization - 

      FREEZE on her face - A KALEIDOSCOPE OF IMAGES as we REWIND 
    in time again - Julia and Helen kissing in the doorway - 
      Helen in the red silk pyjamas - Duncan in Mundy s office - 
    Viv looking up at the kestrel poster in the dentist s chair 
      - Kay giving Viv the ring in the ambulance - Helen gazing 
      after Julia outside the park -

    THE PACE ACCELERATES DEEPER INTO THE PAST - A STACCATO OF 
      IMAGES - Kay with Nancy arriving outside Helen s boarding 
      house - Viv walking down the train corridor - Duncan 
      letting Alec into the kitchen - Julia watching Kay sewing - 
    THE ARRAY OF IMAGES SCREECH TO A HALT - 

      CAPTION:  THREE YEARS EARLIER - 1941



      The rumble of the city outside Kay s flat - hear a familiar 
      voice, O.S.

                                  KAY (O.S.)
                    The rota got changed again.



      O.S. the familiar clatter of ACK-ACK. The deathly drone 
      AEROPLANE ENGINES. A melee of RESCUE WORKERS outside a bomb 
      devastated HOUSE.  Kay and Nancy at the rear of the 
      AMBULANCE, getting out MEDICAL equipment and STRETCHERS.  



      - Duncan, easing the front door closed.  He quickly heads 
      off into the night, suit-case in hand -



      Duncan approaching up the street. He halts under a street 
      lamp, takes FRASER S ADDRESS from his pocket, checks the 
      house number. A gate is nearby: an overgrown front garden.   
      Duncan about to cross to the front door when he catches 
      sight of Fraser through a lit window.

      He s putting a record on the GRAMOPHONE.  He assumes a 
      Waltz position, arms holding an imaginary partner: he 
      counts the rhythm - sets off - steering his imaginary 
      partner round the room - 

      A door opens - Viv enters from a KITCHEN beyond with two 
      glasses of WINE.  Duncan, reeling at the sight of her.  
      Fraser crosses to her, sets down the wine, slides his arms 
      around her to dance with her.

      Duncan: the air is sucked out of him.  He reels away - 
      rests against the wall as if for gravity.  He rallies, 
      peers in the window once again.  Viv is smiling up at 
      Fraser - her happiness is palpable.  In spite of himself 
      the sight touches Duncan - replaced by ruefulness at the 
      inevitable futility of his mission -                       THE NIGHT WATCH - November 3rd 2010       86.



      Helen descending the steps with A SUITCASE - Julia in a 
      window watching -  Helen halts, turns to look back at her- 

      A complicated look is exchange - Julia lets the curtain 
      fall - Helen walks off and is swallowed by the night -
