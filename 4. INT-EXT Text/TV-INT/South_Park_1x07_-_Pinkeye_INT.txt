               Suddenly, a green-faced monster with 6 eyes pops out from 
               behind the control panel.

                                     MONSTER
                         Graah!!

                         Aieeee!

               The monster removes its mask, revealing it is actually 
               Cosmonaut #2.

                                     COSMONAUT #2

               A red light on the control panel starts to flash. Yet another

                                     COSMONAUT #1

               Kenny's dead body lies on an embalming table, surrounded by 
               tubes and medical instruments. The MORTICIAN and his ASSISTANT 
               stand nearby. On the wall behind them is a calendar which is 
               marked off up till the day "OCTOBER 30".

               The Assistant sets the bottle down on a nearby shelf. The 
               Mortician takes an IV needle and sticks it into Kenny.

                                     MORTICIAN
                              (Sighing)
                         You know... I think death is least 
                         funny when it happens to a child.

                                     ASSISTANT
                         Oh Yeah, I know what you mean.

               The Assistant pours some Worchestershire sauce onto a corn 
               dog and takes a bite.

                                     MORTICIAN
                         Marty, do you have to put that stuff 
                         on everything?

                                     ASSISTANT
                         I don't know. It just makes everything 
                         taste so... English!

                                     MORTICIAN
                         Well, let's let him drain.

               The Mortician and his Assistant leave the room. The syringe 
               drains Kenny's blood into a bucket.

               CREEPY MUSIC starts up as we see another tube which runs 
               embalming fluid into Kenny. We FOLLOW the tube up to a shelf, 
               past a row of bottles, up to a vat labeled "EMBALMING FLUID".

               We MOVE UP to see that on the shelf above the vat sits the 
               bottle of Worchestershire sauce. As the music gets LOUDER, 
               the bottle starts to rock back and forth.

               Suddenly, it FALLS over and begins to pour out into the vat 
               of embalming fluid!

               As the music reaches a CRESCENDO, Kenny's eyes pop open!


               The Mortician and his Assistant sit on a little hospital 
               bed. The DOCTOR uses his stethoscope on their chests. The 
               Assistant moans softly.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Very interesting...

                                     MORTICIAN
                         What is it Doc?

               The Doctor takes the stethoscope out of his ears.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Well, your temperature is only 55 
                         degrees, you have no pulse, no 
                         heartbeat, and your eyes are all 
                         puffy and sticky.

                                     MORTICIAN
                         Oh, no. You mean...

                                     DOCTOR
                         Yea, I'm afraid the two of you have 
                         pink eye.

               The Mortician and his Assistant gasp.

                                     DOCTOR
                         I'd give you topical medicine but I 
                         don't want to touch you.

                                     ASSISTANT
                         Oh I'm so hungry and all I can think 
                         about eating is is... BRAINS!

                                     DOCTOR
                         Yeah, well, for God's sake don't 
                         touch your eyes. I'll prescribe some 
                         antibiotics.


               The boys walk into the classroom.

                                     KYLE
                         Just wait till everyone sees my sweet

                         so jealous --

               The boys walk in and see:

               The entire class is dressed up like Chewbacca.

                                     STAN
                         Whoa dude!

                              (Incredulous)
                         EVERYONE came as Chewbacca?

                                     MR. GARRISON (O.S.)
                         It sure does seem to be a popular 
                         costume this year Kyle.

               The boys turn to see MR. GARRISON dressed up like MARILYN 
               MONROE. He lifts up his hands to reveal MR. HAT, who is 
               dressed as Chewbacca.

                                     MR. HAT
                              (WOOKIE GROWL)

               Kyle removes his mask and throws it down.

                                     KYLE
                         Dammit!

                         Wendy?

               The Chewbacca next to Stan takes off it's mask to reveal 
               that it's WENDY.

                                     WENDY
                         Hi Stan.

                                     STAN
                         You said we were going to be Raggedy 
                         Anne and Andy, remember?

                                     WENDY
                         Yeah.

                                     STAN
                         We were going to enter the costume 
                         contest as a pair!

                                     WENDY
                         I know, but then... I guess I just 
                         realized how stupid we would look.

               Stan blinks.

                                     STAN
                         You WHAT?!!

                                     WENDY
                         I thought you would reach the same 
                         conclusion, so I came as Chewbacca.

               Stan slams his head down on his desk.

                                     KID #1
                         Hey Stan, you look almost pretty 
                         enough to kiss.

                                     KID #2
                         Yeah, you want to be my girlfrind?

                         Dude, dressing up like Hitler is NOT 
                         bad ass!

                         go back to Endor, you stupid Wookie!

                         Okay now, all you little Chewbaccas 
                         take your seats.

               The boys sit down.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Children, since today is Halloween, 
                         I thought we should learn something 
                         about the great horror writer Jackie 
                         Collins. You see, when Jackie Collins 
                         first wrote her novel..

               Kenny's arm falls off and hits the floor.

                                     WENDY
                         Ew!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Is there a problem Kenny? Let's try 
                         to keep our hands and arms to 
                         ourselves, okay?

                                     KYLE
                         I'm never going to win that 2 tons 
                         of candy looking like everyone else!


               The boys eat lunch.

                                     KYLE
                         I'm gonna make a new costume during 
                         recess. I can STILL win that candy!

                         Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your 
                         pudding?

               Kenny sits there slumped over.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (in a different voice)
                         No, Eric, go ahead and take my pudding 
                         if you like.
                              (normal voice)
                         Why thank you, Kenny, how nice of 
                         you!

               Cartman takes Kenny's pudding.

               Kenny drools.

                         Oh, God bless America. You get into 
                         my office before anyone else sees 
                         you! I have to show you an educational 
                         video!

               She drags Cartman away from the table. He squeals like a 
               hungry pig.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Squueeee!! I don't want to see an 
                         educational video.

               Kenny leans over and bites into Clyde's arm -- CHOMP!

               Clyde SCREAMS in agony.

                                     CLYDE
                         OWWW! You bit my arm.

                                     STAN
                         Oh Good! Kenny's back to normal!


               Cartman sits in a tiny chair opposite the Principal's desk, 
               watching a video monitor.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Watch the video Eric.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Adolf Hitler was a very, very naughty 
                         man.

               The image on the TV becomes one of those famous shots from 
               WW2 footage of Hitler addressing a mass of Nazis.

                                     HITLER
                         Sfinen! Loobin der Bruce Leeben! Ala

                         vaus de modem stragal tout!

               Cartman's smile grows. He seems impressed and intrigued.

               He looks closely at the screen, but now the image of Hitler 
               has been replaced by Cartman on the stage.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Juden est forbideen! Est una scrava 
                         uts cafiga hoda!!

                                     HITLER
                         Juden est forbideen! goddamit!

               Now a little Smokey Bear type creature steps in front of the 
               camera.

                                     SMOKEY BEAR
                         So remember kids, dressing up like 
                         Hitler in school isn't cool.

               These words appear across the screen as Smokey Bear says 
               them. Principal Victoria shuts the TV off.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Now, do you have any questions?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Can I see that again? That was cool!

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         You must remove that costume 
                         immediately!

                                     CARTMAN
                         I can't, I have to win those two 
                         tons of candy.

                         Well how about we make you a new 
                         costume? Let's see now...

               She looks around the office and spots a white sheet on a 
               shelf.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Aha! Though of something. How about 
                         we make you a nice scary ghost 
                         costume?

                                     CARTMAN
                              (whiny)
                         I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost!

               ANGLE ON: Principal Victoria, as she throws the sheet over 
               Cartman and starts SNIPPING away with a pair of scissors.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                              (as she works)
                         And lemme just make a few quickie 
                         alterations and... there you go young 
                         man!

               FULL SHOT OF CARTMAN, WHO NOW LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE KLANSMAN 
               IN HIS WHITE ROBE AND HOOD.


               The gym is decorated for Halloween. A large banner reads 
               'Costume Contest!'.

               The Chewbacca children all stand in line. At the end are KKK 
               Cartman, Stan (still as Raggedy Andy) and Zombie Kenny.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Boo! I'm a ghost!

                                     STAN
                         Oh man, I feel like a total chode.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh c'mon Stan. Maybe that's just 
                         because you LOOK like a total chode.

                                     CHEF
                         Hello, children.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey Chef.

               Chef turns around and JUMPS when he sees Cartman.

                                     CHEF
                         AHH!!

               Chef runs away.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts 
                         huh!

                                     STAN
                         Hey, where's Kyle?

               Just then, the gym doors fly open and Kyle walks in wearing 
               a HUGE solar system costume.

                                     KYLE
                         Check THIS out!

                         Whoa, dude!

                                     CARTMAN
                         What is that?

                                     KYLE

                         planets even all revolve the right 
                         way! That tub of candy is as good as 
                         mine!

               Mr. Garrison tweets on a little whistle.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Okay children, let's get you lined 
                         up so the judge can get a good look 
                         at your stupid little costumes.

               The kids line up.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Children, this year we have a 
                         celebrity judge. The star of 'Family 
                         Ties'... Miss Tina Yothers!

               Tina Yothers prances out on stage. The kids are unimpressed.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Who?

                                     KYLE
                         Dude, I thought she was dead.

                                     STAN
                         Yea, me too.

               Tina Yothers approaches Mr. Garrison and hands him an 
               envelope.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Thank you, Miss Yothers.

               Mr. Garrison opens the envelope.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Okay, The Second Place award for 
                         best costume goes to... Kenny, for 
                         his Edward James Olmos costume!

               Tina Yothers pins a red ribbon on Kenny. He drools.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         And the award for the Very Best 
                         Costume goes to....

               Kyle's eyes widen.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         WENDY! For her Chewbacca costume!

               Wendy walks past all the other identical Chewbaccas and 
               receives the blue ribbon.

                                     KYLE
                         WHAT?! But she looks just like 
                         everybody else!

               Wendy receives her two tons of candy.

                                     KYLE
                         Up yours Tina Yothers!!!!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         And the award for the WORST costume 
                         this year goes to... STAN for his 
                         stupid little clown thing costume.

               Let's all point at Stan and laugh children.

               Everybody points and laughs at Stan.

               Wendy stands next to Stan.

                                     STAN
                              (muttering)
                         Thanks a lot, Wendy. You RUINED my 
                         Halloween!

                                     WENDY
                         Relax Stan, You'll feel better once 
                         we're out trick or treating.

               Stan can't believe it. He looks bitch-slapped.

                                     STAN
                         I don't want to trick or treat with 
                         you! You lied to me!!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Okay, children let's all gather around 
                         and bob for stupid apples now.

               The kids gather around a large barrel of water.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         You go first bebe...

               Bebe steps up and dunks her head in the water.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         That's good, just use those mouth 
                         muscles like the girls in Beijing.

               Just then, a little zombie Clyde steps up next to zombie 
               Kenny.

                                     CLYDE
                         Brains...

               Clyde dunks his head in after Bebe's head. Bebe screams in 
               pain.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Wait your turn, Clyde!!


               Chef sits in front of the TV, squeezing one of those 
               handmuscle things.

               Chef rushes into the office, where the Doctor is examining a

                         Think about it! Dead people getting 
                         up and walking around... and Tina 
                         Yothers comes to town! Coincidence? 
                         Oh I don't think so!

                                     DOCTOR
                         Chef, I think maybe the pink eye has 
                         made you a little delirious. Let me 
                         give you some topical cream --

                                     CHEF
                         Damnit! Don't you see? These people 
                         have been Zombified! They got no 
                         heartbeat, no feeling... I'll show 
                         you.

               Chef goes over to the patient and rips off his arm. Blood 
               spews everywhere as the patient SCREAMS in agony.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Uh Mr. Torres was here for a routine 
                         checkup, Chef.

               Mr. Torres collapses to the ground.

                                     CHEF
                         Oh. Sorry. But my point is that 
                         topical cream ain't gonna fix what's 
                         wrong here!

                                     DOCTOR
                         Hey... Hey now, there have been a 
                         lot of incredible advances in topical 
                         creams over the last few years!

               The patient passes out from loss of blood.

                                     CHEF
                         Doctor, who was the first person to 
                         come in here with the sickness?

                                     DOCTOR
                         Well, it was the Mortician and his 
                         assistant at the Morgue yea.

               Just then four Zombies burst into the office!!

                                     CHEF
                         AAGHHH!!!!

               Chef jumps out the window and escapes.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Now now, fellas, let's form a line. 
                         I've got enough topical cream for 
                         everybody!

               The Zombies attack the doctor, who SCREAMS out in pain.


               Chef bursts into the office.

                                     CHEF
                         Mayor, we've got a BIG problem --

               Barbrady stands in front of the desk in women's underwear. 
               The Mayor pops up from behind her desk.

                                     MAYOR
                         Why... Why Chef, what a surprise!

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         You're probably wondering why we're 
                         standing here with a pile of money 
                         and no pants on.

                                     CHEF
                         Actually, I...

                                     MAYOR
                         Well, I can assure you that it has 
                         ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the 
                         Japanese Mafia

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         Not a thingy dingy.

                                     CHEF
                         I don't really give a crap. We've 
                         got to do something about THE LIVING 
                         DEAD!

                                     MAYOR
                         You mean Tina Yothers?

               The Mayor and Officer Barbrady LAUGH hysterically.

                                     CHEF
                         No, dammit! I'm talking about the 
                         Zombies that have taken over South 
                         Park!

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         Well, Evil Knieval, why don't you 
                         jump over them with your rocket cycle?

               The Mayor and Officer Barbrady laugh even harder.

                                     CHEF
                         Aw, to hell with you both!

               Chef leaves, slamming the door behind him.

               The Mayor and Officer Barbrady laugh for a moment more, then 
               stop abruptly.

                                     MAYOR
                         Well, let's get back to it.

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         Righteeo.


               The boys sit on the couch while Chef talks to them.

                                     STAN
                         What are you talking about Chef?

                                     CHEF
                         Zombies, children! South Park is 
                         overrun with THE LIVING DEAD! Haven't 
                         you noticed anything strange lately?

                                     KYLE
                         Well, not really, except that Kenny 
                         keeps eating peoples' brains...

                                     CHEF
                         Don't you children see? Kenny's turned 
                         into a zombie, along with everyone 
                         else in town!

                                     STAN
                              (realizing)
                         Oh my God! That means...

                                     KYLE
                              (also realizing)
                         ...if everyone has been turned into 
                         Zombies...

                                     CARTMAN
                              (having an epiphany)
                         ...then there won't be anyone to 
                         give US CANDY!!!!!!!!!

               All the boys gasp at the same time.

                                     CARTMAN
                         AAHHHH!

                                     KYLE
                         Chef! You've got to help us!

                                     CHEF
                         I'm working on it, children.

               Chef throws a bunch of chainsaws and other assorted weapons 
               into a duffel bag.

                                     STAN
                         Wait, where are we going?

                                     CHEF
                         The Doctor said the first people he 
                         treated were the Mortician and his 
                         Assistant. Now, I've got a hunch 
                         we'll get to the bottom of this at... 
                         THE MORGUE!

               The children sit on the couch frightened until Cartman farts.

                                     CARTMAN
                         It was Kyle.

                                   COMMERCIAL BREAK #2


               Chef and the boys look around the room.

                                     STAN
                         What are we doing here, Chef?

                                     CHEF
                         Just look for anything suspicious.

               Everybody looks around.

                                     KYLE
                         I found it!! I found it!!!

               Kyle pulls out a porno magazine. Bold letters on the cover 
               read: "CRACK WHORE MAGAZINE". On the cover is Cartman's mom, 
               posing in lingerie with a glass pipe in one hand and a butane 
               torch in the other.

                                     STAN
                         What?

                                     KYLE
                         See Cartman?! Your mom IS on the 
                         cover!

               Cartman's eyes bug out.

                                     STAN
                         We TOLD you, dude!!

                                     CHEF
                              (grabbing magazine)
                         You better let me take that, Kyle.

                                     STAN
                         Hey Chef, look!

               Chef comes over to Stan, who stands by the embalming table.

               ANGLE ON: The plastic tubing. We FOLLOW it up onto the shelf, 
               past the row of bottles, up to the vat of embalming fluid, 
               then up to the empty bottle of Worchestershire sauce.

               Chef grabs the empty bottle and reads the label. It says:

               "WARNING: NOT TO BE USED AS EMBALMING FLUID. EMERGENCY 
               HOTLINE: 1-800-382-5633"

                                     CHEF
                         Uh oh... We gotta call this hotline 
                         number children!!

               Just then, a window CRASHES open!! It is ZOMBIE PIP!!

                                     PIP
                         PIIIINK EYYYEEE... PIIIINK EYYYEEE...

                                     CARTMAN
                         It's the British kid!! He's a little 
                         limy zombie now!!

               Several other windows crash in. A horde of zombies is breaking 
               into the room!!

                                     STAN
                         AAAGH!!!

                                     CHEF
                         LOOK OUT, CHILDREN!!!

               The zombies come at Stan and Kyle. Stan grabs a baseball bat 
               and smashes their heads in.

               (FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT)

                                     STAN
                         Okay, Chef, dial the hotline number!!

               Silence...

                                     STAN
                         Chef?

               WHIP PAN around the room and STOP on Chef -- who looks just 
               like Michael Jackson in 'Thriller'.

                                     KYLE
                         Chef!!

               Chef starts dancing and getting funky with the zombies.

                                     CHEF
                              (Singing)
                         I'm gonna make love, even when I'm 
                         dead. My body might get cold, but 
                         it's always hot in my bed! Make love, 
                         don't you be afraid. Just because my 
                         heart ain't beating don't mean you 
                         wont get laid.

                                     STAN
                         Let's get outta here!!

               The boys run away.

                                     CHEF
                         Ooooohhhh!


               ANGLE ON: A photograph of three lovely ladies fondling each 
               other on a king-sized bed.

               Zombie Chef sits at the table, quietly flipping through the 
               porno mag.


                                     OPERATOR
                         With the regular sauce, the first 
                         thing you need to do is make sure 
                         that you DO NOT just go out and start 
                         decapitating Zombies left and right, 
                         do you understand? DO NOT start 
                         decapitating Zombies left and right!


                                     OPERATOR
                         All you have to do is kill the 
                         original Zombie, the one that started 
                         the whole mess. Once you kill the 
                         original Zombie all the other Zombies 
                         will turn back to normal.
