      TWO HANDS thread the laces on the head of a lacrosse stick. 
      The work is slow and determined, fingers pulling each lace 
      into a diamond mesh pattern. Instructions lie on the desk 
      nearby.

      Knotting the last loop, sixteen year-old SCOTT MCCALL stands 
      with the re-threaded stick. Dressed in only a pair of 
      athletic shorts, his lithe frame may still have some filling 
      out to do but it s easy to see that he ll soon grow into a 
      strikingly handsome young man.

      Scooping a ball up from his bedroom floor, he gives the 
      lacrosse stick a spin, testing his handiwork. A voice comes 
      calling from outside the open door.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL (O.S.)
                          (yelling to be heard)
                    Scott, I m off to work. Dinner s in 
                    the fridge!

      Scott accidentally sends the ball CRASHING into a lamp.

                    Glue s in the cabinet!

      As Scott kneels to pick up the pieces, his mother, MELISSA 
      MCCALL, peers into his room.                  TEEN WOLF - Ep. 101 "Pilot" DBL Salmon - 10/15/102.

                    I thought you quit lacrosse.

                                  SCOTT
                    I didn t quit. I just kind of never 
                    play.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL

                    school should be fun. You should be

                            (considering this)
                    But not catching them. Just 
                    chasing.

                                  SCOTT
                    Well, I m not having much luck with 
                    that either.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL
                    Okay, I should go before I 
                      completely destroy your self 
                    esteem. Don t worry. Sophomore year 
                    is always better. I promise.

      As she leaves, Scott finishes picking up the pieces of the 
      broken lamp. Getting ready for bed, he pumps out a few chin-
      ups at the bar mounted in the doorway of his closet and then 
      brushes his teeth in the bathroom.

      BUT A SOUND--an odd cracking--spins him around.                  TEEN WOLF - Ep. 101 "Pilot" DBL Salmon - 10/15/103.

      First period English. Scott takes the desk next to Stiles as 
      the teacher, MR. CURTIS walks in.

                                  MR. CURTIS
                    As you all know, there was indeed a 
                    body found in the woods last night. 
                    I m sure your eager little minds 
                    are coming up with various macabre 
                    scenarios as to how it happened but 
                    I ve been told that the police have 
                    a suspect in custody.

      Scott looks to Stiles who shrugs, news to him as well.

                                  MR. CURTIS (CONT'D)
                    Which means your undivided 
                    attention can be given to the 
                    syllabus outlining the semester on 
                    your desks. Read it now. And by 
                    read I don t mean skim.

      The students begin reading. And then seemingly out of nowhere  
      A CELL PHONE RINGS.

      Scott glances up. The other students quietly read the 
      syllabus. Scott appears to be the only one noticing the 
      RINGING. Gazing about, he can t seem to find the source until 
      his eyes fall on the WINDOWS of the classroom...

      OUTSIDE - across the quad, Scott sees ALLISON ARGENT. Sixteen 
      and radiating with an innocent beauty. When she puts a cell 
      phone to her ear, it becomes obvious that, despite the closed 
      windows and the distance, this is the RINGING Scott is 
      somehow able to hear.

      More astonishingly, Scott can hear both Allison and her 
      caller, their VOICES echoing with a tinny effect.                TEEN WOLF - Ep. 101 "Pilot" DBL Salmon - 10/15/1012.

                    Mom, three calls on my first day is 
                    a little overdoing it.

                                  MRS. ARGENT (V.O.)
                    Just making sure you re there okay 
                    and you ve got everything you need.

      But Allison digs through her bag, becoming alarmed.

                                    ALLISON
                      Everything except a pen. Oh my God, 
                    I didn t actually forget a pen.

                                  MRS. ARGENT (V.O.)
                    Don t panic. I m sure you can 
                    borrow one from another student.

                                    ALLISON
                    Okay, okay, I gotta  go. Love ya.

      Unable to take his eyes off the extraordinary girl, Scott 
      watches the school s PRINCIPAL join her on the steps.

                                  PRINCIPAL
                    Sorry to keep you waiting.

      The Principal guides her across the quad, their conversation 
      becoming clearer to Scott with every step.

                                  PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
                    So you were saying San Francisco 
                    isn t where you grew up?

                                    ALLISON
                    No, but we stayed for more than a 
                    year which is unusual in my family. 
                    We kind of bounce around a lot 
                    because of my Dad s work.

      Even when Allison and the Principal disappear from view, 
      Scott hears the CLATTER of the building door opening, the 
      CLICKING of their heels on the tile floor of the hall.

                                  PRINCIPAL (O.S.)
                    Well, hopefully, Beacon Hills is 
                    your last stop for a while.

      The door opens, causing the rest of the class to look up.                TEEN WOLF - Ep. 101 "Pilot" DBL Salmon - 10/15/1013.

                    Class, this is our new student 
                    Allison Argent. Please do your best 
                    to make her feel welcome.

      Scott barely breathes as Allison heads for the one empty desk 
      left in the room. Right behind him. 

      She puts her notebook down, then glances up to see Scott 
      turned toward her. Holding out a PEN. With a relieved but 
      curious smile, she takes it from him.

                                    ALLISON
                    Thanks.

      Scott gives her a nod. Turning around, his gaze FOCUSES on 
      Stiles s desk where his friend s SUNGLASSES sit. In the 
      MIRRORED LENSES Scott can see Allison reflected behind him 
      and he can t take his eyes off her.

                                  MR. CURTIS
                    Okay, let s begin with Kafka...

      Scott, at his locker notices Allison just down the corridor. 
      They connect eyes. She starts to smile, recognizing the cute 
      guy who gave her the pen. But then Lydia Martin swoops in 
      front of her.

      A GIRL opens the locker next to hers and BOOKS SPILL OUT. As 
      Allison kneels down to help pick up the girl s books, her 
      eyes find Scott s.

      Somehow just this look from her seems to return his hearing 
      to normal. She starts to smile back, recognizing him. But 
      then as she stands, Lydia swoops in front of her.

                                  LYDIA
                    That jacket is absolutely killer.

      Taking Allison by the arm, she guides her to a clique 
      gathering at the end of the hall where JACKSON, Lydia s 
      boyfriend, tries to wrap his arm around her. She shrugs him 
      off to continue talking to Allison.

      Rebecca Harlowe, better known as HARLEY comes from an 
      adjacent hall to find Scott dialing in the combo on his own 
      locker. He keeps steals glances back, however.

                                  HARLEY
                    Can someone tell me how New Girl is 
                    here all of five minutes and she s 
                    already hanging with Lydia s crowd?

                                  STILES
                    Because she s hot. Beautiful people 
                    herd together.

      Stiles steps up to open his own locker next to Scott s.

                                  HARLEY
                    Is that why Lydia isn t herding 
                    with you?

                                  STILES
                    Lydia s a long term project, okay? 
                    And trust me, I ve got all the 
                    patience in the world for a high 
                    yield investment like her.

                                  HARLEY
                    Well, I don t think New Girl s that 
                    pretty. Scott, you think she s 
                    pretty? Scott?

      He doesn t even blink, attention consumed by Allison.

                    I d take that as a yes.

      Head cocked slightly, Scott TUNES in the conversation from 
      the other end of the corridor, VOICES coming into focus.

      With a few spare bandages in his hand, Scott approaches one 
      of the mirrors and lifts up his shirt.

      Fingertips at the edge of the bandage he braces himself. Then 
      RIPS it off. Sucking in a breath and shutting his eyes, he 
      finds himself looking at--

      NOTHING. The bite has completely healed. There s not a mark 
      on him. He lowers his shirt, slowly turning to his own 
      reflection in the mirror. To a look of shock.


      Scott backs down a corridor hauling a huge bag of kitty 
      litter. Setting it against the wall he takes out a set of 
      keys and unlocks the next door.              TEEN WOLF - Ep. 101 "Pilot" DBL Salmon - 10/15/1020A.

      The frightened felines suddenly bare their teeth, HISSING and 
      clawing frenetically at the cage doors. All of them focused 
      on Scott, their backs arched, struck with absolute terror.

      Retreating into the waiting room, Scott can still hear the 
      pandemonium coming from inside when a HAMMERING spins him 
      around.

      Standing outside and banging on the glass door with her fist 
      is Allison. Rain-soaked it s nevertheless easy to see that 
      she s crying and in a visible panic.

      FADE IN:


      Quickly unlocking the door, Scott lets her in as she tries to 
      explain through tears what happened. 

                                    ALLISON
                    I didn t see it. I took my eyes off 
                    the road for like two seconds to 
                    switch songs on my iPod and this 
                    dog--it came out of nowhere--

                                  SCOTT
                    Okay, it s all right. Do you 
                    remember where it happened so I can 
                    send out animal control to find it?

                                    ALLISON
                    No. I mean yes, I know where I hit 
                    it. But the dog--

      Inside, Scott gently lays the injured animal down on the 
      examining table. Allison stays back, watching him inspect the 
      dog while petting it, doing an expert job of calming it.

                                  SCOTT
                    I think his leg is broken. I ve 
                    seen the doctor do plenty of 
                    splints. I could try it myself and 
                    give him a painkiller for now.

      Allison steals glances at him, looking on with admiration as 
      he works. But Scott doesn t notice, terrified to glance at 
      the beautiful girl. When he finally does look up, he sees 
      she s hugging herself, soaked and obviously freezing.

                    Oh, I don t want to trouble you.

      But Scott is already reaching into his bag for the shirt. 
      Allison takes it with a smile and steps into the hall for 
      privacy. As she s pulling the wet shirt off, Scott catches 
      sight of her bare back. Quickly looking away, he notices the 
      dog staring up at him.

                                  SCOTT
                            (whispering)
                    What? I didn t see anything.                TEEN WOLF - Ep. 101 "Pilot" DBL Salmon - 10/15/1024.

      The dog doesn t look convinced. Allison comes back into the 
      room, now wearing his shirt and no longer shivering.

                                    ALLISON 
                    Thanks for doing this. I feel 
                    really stupid.

                                  SCOTT
                    How come?

                                    ALLISON
                    I don t know. For freaking out like 
                    a total girl.

                                  SCOTT
                    You are a girl.

                                    ALLISON
                    I freaked out like a girly girl. 
                    And I m not a girly girl.

                                  SCOTT
                    What kind of girl are you?

                                    ALLISON
                    Tougher than that. At least I 
                    thought I was.

                                  SCOTT
                    I d be freaked out too. In fact, 
                    I d probably cry. And not like a 
                    man. I d cry like the girliest 
                    girl. It would be pathetic.

                                    ALLISON
                          (laughing)
                    Yeah, right.

      Scott finishes wrapping the dog s leg.

                                  SCOTT 
                    So it looks like he s going to 
                    live. And I m pretty sure he ll 
                    even let you pet him if you want.

                                    ALLISON
                    I don t think so.

                                  SCOTT
                    Come on. You don t want him to sue. 
                    This breed is very litigious.                TEEN WOLF - Ep. 101 "Pilot" DBL Salmon - 10/15/1025.

      CONTINUED:1717

      Allison approaches, tentatively reaching out to stroke the 
      dog s neck. Calm now, the dog even licks her hand.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    See? He likes you.

      He watches Allison. Unable to take his eyes off her.

                                    ALLISON
                          (noticing his stare)
                    What?

                                  SCOTT
                    Sorry. You have an eyelash on your 
                    cheek.

                                    ALLISON
                    Oh. From the crying.

      She wipes at her cheek. But the lash is still there. Scott 
      shakes his head. She tries again. Still there. So Scott 
      reaches with his thumb to brush the lash from her cheek.

                                    ALLISON (CONT'D)
                    Thanks.

      He nods, hand coming down like he s not quite sure what to do 
      with it.


      Scott falls back onto his bed, head hitting the pillow. 
      Clearly exhausted, he nevertheless wears a huge grin on his 
      face. His eyelids slowly close as he falls instantly asleep. 

      Slowly he turns over on his side, rolling over and strangely 
      onto... A BED OF WET LEAVES, causing him to wake suddenly and 
      discover he s no longer in bed...


      In a pool. Gasping for breath, he twists around in the water 
      to find the OWNER of the house holding a garden hose and 
      staring at him.

                                  SCOTT
                    Uh... Good morning.

      And the Owner nods with a mystified smile.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      In an otherwise empty corridor, Scott--wearing his lacrosse 
        gear--shoves his bag into his locker and slams it shut. He 
      turns to find himself staring right at Jackson.

                                    JACKSON
                    All right, little man, how about 
                    you tell me where you re getting 
                    your juice?

                                  SCOTT
                    What?

                                    JACKSON
                    Where. Are. You. Getting your 
                    juice?

                                  SCOTT
                          (utterly bewildered)
                    My Mom does all the grocery 
                    shopping.

      Jackson stares at him for a moment as if trying to decide 
      whether the kid is screwing with him.

                                    JACKSON
                    Listen, McCall, you re going to 
                    tell me what it is and who you re 
                    buying from. Because there s no way 
                    in hell you re kicking ass like 
                    that on the field without some sort 
                    of chemical boost.

                                  SCOTT
                          (genuinely shocked)
                    You mean steroids? Are you on 
                    steroids?

      Jackson grabs him, shoving him against the locker.

                                    JACKSON
                    What the hell s going on with you, 
                    McCall?

        Overwhelmed, Scott snaps, words coming out in a torrent--                TEEN WOLF - Ep. 101 "Pilot" DBL Salmon - 10/15/1029.

      CONTINUED:2020

                                  SCOTT
                    What s going on with me? You really 
                    want to know? So would I. Because I 
                    can see, hear and smell things I 
                    shouldn t be able to see, hear or 
                    smell, do things that should be 
                      impossible, I m sleepwalking three 
                    miles out into the middle of the 
                    woods and am pretty much convinced 
                    I m going completely, totally out 
                    of my freaking mind.

                                    JACKSON
                    You think you re funny? I know 
                    you re hiding something. I m going 
                    to find out what it is. I don t 
                    care how long it takes.

      Jackson SLAMS his fist against the locker, leaving Scott 
      stunned as he heads out.


      Fingers click furiously over a keyboard. Eyes locked on his 
      laptop, Stiles bounces from one web page to the next. Words 
      and images pop up on the screen--

      Wolfsbane, Silver Bullets, Lycaon, Aconite, drawings of 
      werewolves in different forms, a PURPLE FLOWER with the word 
      WOLFSBANE underneath.

      As his room darkens under the setting sun, an increasingly 
      panicked Stiles watches a sheet of paper come out of his 
      printer.

      THE PRINTOUT - shows a detailed wood carving of a MEDIEVAL 
      HUNTER standing over the body of a werewolf, aiming a 
      CROSSBOW at the creature.

      He pulls the page out, staring at it with a look of 
      escalating fear when SOMEONE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR.

      Stiles practically leaps out of his chair. He rushes to the 
      door, unlocking it to find Scott standing out in the hall.

                                  STILES
                    Get in. You have to see this. I ve 
                    been reading. Websites, books, all 
                    this information.

      As Scott takes off his jacket, Stiles starts grabbing 
      printouts from his desk.

                                  SCOTT
                    How much Adderall have you had?

                                  STILES
                    A lot. Doesn t matter. Just listen.

                                  SCOTT
                    Is this about the body? Did they 
                    find who did it?

                                  STILES
                    No, they re still questioning 
                    people. Even Derek Hale--

                                  SCOTT
                    The guy from the woods--

                                  STILES
                    Yeah, but that s not it.                TEEN WOLF - Ep. 101 "Pilot" DBL Salmon - 10/15/1033.

      CONTINUED:2222

                                  SCOTT
                    What then?

                                  STILES
                    Remember the joke the other day? 
                    Not a joke anymore.
                          (off his look)
                    The wolf. The bite in the woods. I 
                    started doing all this reading and--
                    Do you even know why a wolf howls?

                                  SCOTT
                    Should I?

                                  STILES
                    It s a signal. When a wolf is alone 
                    it howls to signal its location to 
                    the rest of the pack. So if you 
                    heard it howling that mean there s 
                    others. Maybe a whole pack of them.

                                  SCOTT
                    A pack of wolves?

                                  STILES
                    No. Werewolves.

                                  SCOTT
                    You re seriously wasting my time 
                    with this? You know, I m picking 
                    Allison up in an hour.

                                  STILES
                    I saw you on the field, Scott. What 
                    you did wasn t just amazing. It was 
                      impossible.

                                  SCOTT
                    So I made a good shot.

                                  STILES
                    No, you made an incredible shot. 
                    The way you moved--the speed, your 
                      reflexes--people can t suddenly do  
                    that overnight. And then there s 
                    the hearing, the senses, and don t 
                    think I haven t noticed you don t 
                    need your inhaler anymore. You 
                    haven t used it since that night.

                                  SCOTT
                    I can t think about this now. We ll 
                    talk tomorrow, okay?                TEEN WOLF - Ep. 101 "Pilot" DBL Salmon - 10/15/1034.

                    full moon is tonight.

                                  SCOTT 
                    What are you trying to do? I just 
                    made first line on the team. I have 
                    a date with a girl I can t believe 
                    wants to go out with me. Everything 
                    in my life is somehow perfect. Why 
                    are you trying to ruin it?

                                  STILES
                    I m trying to help. With the full 
                    moon it s going to be too hard to 
                    resist and there s no going back. 
                    You re cursed, Scott. And it s not 
                    only that the moon causes you to 
                    change, it s also when your 
                    bloodlust will be at its peak.

                                  SCOTT
                      Bloodlust?

                    I m already starting to have an 
                    urge to kill, Stiles.

                                  STILES
                    You need to hear this. The change 
                    can be caused by anger or anything 
                    that raises your pulse. And I ve 
                    never seen anyone raise your pulse 
                    like Allison does. You have to call 
                    her and cancel the date.

      Stiles grabs Scott s jacket, pulling the cell phone out.

                                  SCOTT
                    What are you doing? Give me that.

                                  STILES
                    I m just finding her number--

                                  SCOTT
                    Give it to me.

      Scott yanks the phone out of Stiles s hand and SHOVES him 
      against the wall.                 TEEN WOLF - Ep. 101 "Pilot" DBL Salmon - 10/15/1035.

      Pulling back before striking him, Scott instead LASHES out at 
      the desk chair sending it flying across the room, tossed like 
      it weighed nothing. Then, shaking with anger, he gazes up.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    I didn t mean to do that.

      He starts to help Stiles up, but his friend flinches back.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    I m sorry. Really, I didn t mean 
                    it. I have to go. I have to get 
                    ready for the party. I m sorry.

      Grabbing his jacket, Scott hurries out.

      Still shaken, Stiles gradually stands. He slowly picks up the 
      desk chair, putting it back. But then he pauses. With a shaky 
      hand, he turns the chair around to reveal...

      CLAW MARKS. The chair s fabric slashed to ribbons.

                                        ACT FIVE

      FADE IN:


      Scott comes out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around 
      his waist when--

                                    MELISSA MCCALL
                    Is this a party or a date?

      Scott jumps, startled. His Mom has the car keys held out.

                                  SCOTT
                    Maybe both.

      He reaches for the keys, but she pulls back.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL
                    And her name is?*

                                  SCOTT
                    Allison.

      She hands him the keys.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL
                    We don t need to have a talk do we?

                                  SCOTT
                    Mom, I m not having the safe sex 
                    talk with you.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL
                          (freaked out)
                    I meant about keeping the tank 
                    full. Give me those back.

      She reaches for the keys in alarm as something begins to 
      happen to their VOICES. The quality starts to change. 
      Becoming TINNY as we pull back--                TEEN WOLF - Ep. 101 "Pilot" DBL Salmon - 10/15/1037.



      Scott pulls up to the curb outside Allison s house. He keeps 
      taking deep breaths. He pulls his inhaler out, shakes it up, 
      looks at it and then tosses it in the back.

      Finally, the front door of the house opens and Allison steps 
      out. Looking absolutely stunning under the glow of the 
      streetlights, she approaches the car while pushing a strand 
      of hair from her eyes.

      Suddenly realizing he s still in the car with his mouth 
      hanging open, Scott scrambles to get out and open the door 
      for her.


      Driving. Scott and Allison sit in silence. Absolute and 
      agonizing silence.

                                    ALLISON
                    Is it okay if I turn on the radio?                TEEN WOLF - Ep. 101 "Pilot" DBL BUFF - 10/29/1038.

        CONTINUED:22E22E

                                  SCOTT
                    Uh, yes. But you can t.
                          (off her confused look)
                    Sorry, it s broken. We ve been 
                    meaning to get it fixed.

                                    ALLISON
                    No worries. You mind if I put on 
                    some music anyway?

      Now it s Scott s turn to give a confused look. But Allison 
      has her phone out. She turns the volume up and puts it on 
      speaker.

                                  SCOTT
                          (surprised)
                    Nice taste in music.*

                                    ALLISON
                    What? You think all girls listen to  
                    is Lady Gaga?

                                  SCOTT
                          (under his breath)
                    I listen to Lady Gaga.

      She does a double take. He s serious. And she laughs.

                                    ALLISON
                    So do I.

      She puts her hand over his on the middle console, their 
      fingers intertwining. Scott tries to hide his smile to play 
      it cool. But he can t. For just a moment, everything is 
      absolutely perfect.


      Teeth clenched, a sudden wave of pain SLAMS Scott back 
      against the wall, tremors shuddering through his body. 
      Waiting in line for the bathroom, Harley notices him.

                                  HARLEY
                    Scott? You all right?

      But he doesn t answer, pushing through the crowd, trying to 
      find an exit out of the house. Finally, shoving past people, *
      he charges out the front door.                TEEN WOLF - Ep. 101 "Pilot" DBL Salmon - 10/15/1041.



      Scott stumbles into his darkened room, slamming the door shut 
      and flipping the lock.


      Sweat at his brow, Scott charges into the bathroom. He flips 
      the cold water knob on the shower, letting it pour over him. 
      And then he notices something... HIS FINGERNAILS. Seeming to 
      tear free, bone-like claws pushing them out from the tips.

      Terrified, he stumbles out and to the mirror where he wipes 
      away the steam to reveal rapidly growing fangs and TWO 
      GLOWING, YELLOW EYES staring back at him.

      Someone POUNDS on the door to his room.

                                  SCOTT
                    Go away!

                                  STILES (O.S.)
                    Scott, it s me.                TEEN WOLF - Ep. 101 "Pilot" DBL Salmon - 10/15/1042.

      CONTINUED:2727

      Hearing the panic in his friend s voice, he pulls himself up. 
      He unlocks the door but only allows it to open an inch.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Let me in, Scott I can help--

                                  SCOTT
                    No.

      Eyes burning YELLOW, he stays hidden behind the door, face 
      shrouded in darkness as Stiles tries to peer through.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    Listen, you have to find Allison.

                                  STILES
                    She s fine. I saw her get a ride. 
                    She s totally fine.

                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles, I think I know who it is.

                                  STILES
                    Just let me in and we can talk.

                                  SCOTT
                    It s Derek. Derek Hale s the 
                    werewolf. He s the one who bit me. 
                    He s the one who killed the girl in 
                    the woods.

      Stiles answers with shocked silence. Until--

                                  STILES
                    Scott... Derek s the one who drove 
                    Allison from the party.

      The weight of realization falling on him, Scott slams the 
      door shut, locking it.

                                  STILES (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Scott! Scott, wait--


      Stiles drives, Scott in the passenger seat with a jacket over 
      him now.

                                  SCOTT
                    You know what actually worries me 
                    most?

                                  STILES
                    If you say Allison, I m going to 
                    punch you in the head.

                                  SCOTT
                    She probably hates me now.

                                  STILES
                    I doubt that. But you might want to *
                    come up with a pretty amazing *
                    apology. Or just tell her the truth *
                    and revel in the awesomeness of the *
                    fact that you re a freaking *
                    werewolf.
                          (off his look)
                    Okay, bad idea. We ll get through 
                    this. If I have to, I ll chain you 
                    up myself on full moon nights and 
                    feed you live mice. I had a boa 
                    once. I can do it.

      And finally, Stiles coaxes the tiniest smile out of Scott.                TEEN WOLF - Ep. 101 "Pilot" DBL Salmon - 10/15/1049.
