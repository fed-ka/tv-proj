Three grimy looking fuckers are stuffed into the cab.
FUCKING DRIVER looks as though he may piss himself. FUCKING
MIDDLE twists around, glares through the back glass and
FUCKING PASSENGER white-knuckles a tire iron.
FUCKING DRIVER
Goddamned old man!
FUCKING PASSENGER
I thought he was dead! She said he
was dead!
FUCKING MIDDLE
I don't see him. Just go. I think
we lost him.
Covered in a thick layer of cooking grease, this is one of
those diners where white trash goes to die. Half a dozen
PATRONS sit at bar and booth as a young American Indian
couple, MARY and DALE, enter with their children 2, 4 and 7.
Two waitresses, PIPER (25) and NORMAJEAN (57) stand at the
kitchen pick-up window. Through which we can see the
joint's owner, FAT LOU, dripping sweat into a pile of
scrambled eggs. Fat Lou is fat. Holy fuck fat.
PIPER
So I tell him, I says, Frank,
that's it. No more free milk. You
gonna have to buy the cow you son
of a bitch.
5.
NORMAJEAN
But you're not fat, Piper
PIPER
Wha? No, NormaJean, buy the cow.
Marry me? He's got to marry me.
I'm sayin I cut him off.
NORMAJEAN
You cut him off?
PIPER
Not just yes but hell yes! No
tits, no ass. And I told him if I
see that big ol' dick of his
anywhere near my face I'm gonna
bite it in half.
Normajean giggles with embarrassment.
NORMAJEAN
You said that? How long's it been?
Piper frowns.
PIPER
Well, it's only been two days but
that's like a decade in horny
fucker years.
NORMAJEAN
So he bought you a diamond?
PIPER
A diamond? God no. If Frank had
money for a diamond I would have
jacked his sorry ass ages ago and
put this shithole life in the rear
view. But he did get down on his
knees and ask me to be his bride.
NORMAJEAN
No way.
PIPER
Yes way!
NormaJean grabs Piper in a great big hug.
NORMAJEAN
Oh! Piper!
6.
PIPER
I KNOW!
FF-FF-FFUMP!
Something yellow peppers them both. The girls look up as --
Fat Lou SLAMS two plates of food into the window.
PIPER
Did...did you just throw scrambled
eggs at us?
FAT LOU
I don't pay you bitches to stand
around. Now get the fuck back to work!
Piper snatches one of the plates.
She delivers it to a Patron sitting at the bar, then turns
toward the newly arrived customers.
The American Indian couple scans a menu...
...and Milton (the old guy from our opening) scans her...he
quickly looks down at an unfolded map of Colorado as --
NormaJean steps up to Milton.
NORMAJEAN
Hello beautiful, coffee?
MILTON
That'd be great. Tell me,
Stillwater Marsh around here?
NORMAJEAN
(shrugs) Stillwater...doesn't ring
a bell. I'll get that coffee.
But Milton makes eye contact with Mary, the Indian mother.
She quickly looks away. She knows something...
Milton opens his mouth to speak as--
--Piper approaches the American Indian couple.
PIPER
Hi guys, I'm Piper. Can I bring
you something to drink?
MOTHER MARY
We'll take this.
7.
Mary points to the menu, Piper leans in, reads.
PIPER
She's a Brickhouse breakfast.
Ten monster flapjacks for 4.99.
MOTHER MARY
And five waters.
PIPER
Five waters. And what can I get for...
Father averts his eyes. He's embarrassed.
MOTHER MARY
That's it. Just the pancakes. If
that's okay?
Piper stares at them as if for the first time. Shit...
they're hungry. And broke.
PIPER
Oh. Of course. Coming right up.
Piper shoots Milton a look as she crosses to the kitchen.
Milton rises slightly. He's clearly trying to get Mary's
attention. She's ignoring him.
Piper calls through the window to Fat Lou.
PIPER
One brickhouse.
She turns and stops suddenly. Stares at a pile of muffins
kept fresh within a glass cake stand.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Mary can no longer avoid Milton's stare.
MILTON
Stillwater Marsh? You know it?
Dale, the father, keeps his back to Milton as he speaks.
DALE
No. We don't.
MILTON
It's important.
8.
MOTHER MARY
You're in the wrong state.
DALE
Mary!
MILTON
And what state Should I be in?
Dale turns, glares at Milton.
DALE
Nevada. Catch the 50 and cut across.
It's a two day drive from here.
MILTON
And Wolf Deer Run?
DALE
Never heard of it.
The 7 year old LITTLE GIRL'S eyes brighten.
LITTLE GIRL
Yes you have daddy. Wolf Deer Run,
that's where The Smiling Man takes
the wicked children to see the
Mother of all things.
Mary SHUSHES her Little Girl and pulls her close.
MILTON
Mother of all things, that sounds
very interesting.
LITTLE GIRL
Oh it is! The Mother of all things
bleeds black tears unto those who
CUT HER--
Mother places her hand over her daughter's mouth.
MOTHER MARY
It's nothing. Just a story parents
tell to their children. Like the
boogey-man or the tooth-fairy.
A plate filled with muffins thumps down before them. Piper
leans in with three kiddie cups.
PIPER
And three milks.
9.
MOTHER MARY
But we didn't order--
PIPER
(whispers) --On the house.
She winks and moves away...eyeing the kitchen window. She
doesn't notice...
MILTON
staring at her again. An impressed smirk on his face.
Suddenly NormaJean steps in front of him.
NORMAJEAN
So, aren't you gonna ask what time
my shift ends? Full moon tonight.
I'm always a little randy' during
full moon.
MILTON
Full moon's three days off.
NORMAJEAN
(she touches his hand)
You sure bout that, sweetie?
MILTON
Pretty sure. (looks outside) Hell
of a ride out there. Yours?
NORMAJEAN
The GTO? I wish.
MILTON
(glances at Piper)
Hers?
NORMAJEAN
Sure but if you're lookin' for a
ride...
MILTON
And would you be gentle?
NORMAJEAN
Life's too short for that, sweetie.
Piper enters with two dirty plates, scrapes them and drops
them into a soapy sink. She turns right into --
10.
FAT LOU
He glares down at her.
PIPER
Jesus Lou, back the fuck off.
FAT LOU
On the house? On the fucking
house?
PIPER
Oh relax. We gotta toss them
muffins out today anyway.
She sidesteps him, exits the kitchen.
As Piper crosses toward the bar, Lou grabs her from behind,
spins her around.
PIPER
Get your hand off of me!
His fat fingers tighten around her shoulder.
FAT LOU
You get over there and you charge
them for those muff...
Piper strikes. Like a snake. Her hand reaches beneath the
fat of his belly and vice grips his balls. Hell, we even
hear the CRUNCH.
Fat Lou GASPS and doubles over allowing Piper to SLAM her
forehead into the bridge of his nose!
KER-RACK!
PIPER
I told you, you fat fuck son of a
bitch, never to touch me again!
His nose seeps blood.
FAT LOU
Let...go...of...my...
She SLAPS him across the face with her free hand.
11.
PIPER
Shut up.
She takes a step backwards, but keeps her hand clamped to his
nuts. He has no choice but follow.
She pulls him up to the American Indian family.
PIPER
Tell'em.
FAT LOU
Wha...what?
We see it in her face. She squeezes. Lou's eyes go
wide...flutter...he's about to pass out.
PIPER
Tell them...the muffins...are on
the house.
FAT LOU
On. The. House.
She lets go. Lou drops to his knees, then timbers to the
floor as Piper turns to the family.
The children are huddled, terrified against their parents.
PIPER
I'm sorry your kids had to see
that. Put some honey butter on
those bran muffins and they taste
an awful lot better.
Piper turns and crosses toward the door.
NormaJean is pale as she watches her go.
Piper brushes past Milton's booth. His cup is there but
Milton is gone.
Piper's French manicured hand wraps the floor-mounted gear
shift like a cock and SLAMS it into drive.
Piper SINGS. She's empowered. Then...
KA-THUNK.
She grips the wheel.
The RPMS drop.
Piper behind the wheel focuses on the road. Milton sits in
the passenger seat, hugs his duffle bag, glances at Piper.
Suddenly Piper turns on him.
PIPER
Get it straight old man. I ain't
sleeping with you.
Milton chuckles.
MILTON
Darlin, my days of bedding a gal ten
minutes after I meet her are over.
PIPER
Yeah. Well, that's good to hear.
MILTON
(TO HIMSELF)
For now, anyway.
First thing we see is MONA'S naked ass and back. Long red
hair, she is riding a naked FRANK. Neither realizes Piper
has opened the door.
MONA
Oh Frank, you know how long I've
wanted to feel you inside me?
FRANK
Faster.
MONA
Oh, you want it faster?
Mona thrusts her pelvic the tiniest bit faster.
Suddenly Piper's hand clinches a handful of red hair and
yanks! Mona SCREAMS in pain, Frank YELPS in fear as Piper
drags Mona backwards off the bed.
Piper stuffs a gym bag with clothes.
FRANK
Now baby, just hold on.
PIPER
I'm warning you, Frank. Don't come
near me.
16.
FRANK
Look, sooner you accept this is
your fault, the better.
Piper stops, turns, stares.
FRANK
Baby, I can't just turn it off.
Now you know that. I gotta have
it. At least once a day. It's in
the wiring. You did this. You
made me cheat on you. You're lucky
I'm not more pissed about it.
Piper stares for a moment. It's like she's been sucker
punched. Then she zips her bag and crosses to the door.
FRANK
Piper! Now cut it out. Enough
with the drama!
Milton watches Piper's room. It's clear the phone to his ear
is a fake out.
Suddenly a look crosses his face. He jerks around.
HIS POV
THE GAS STATION ACROSS HIGHWAY 70
...the garage. A grimy looking GREASE MONKEY is staring at
Milton, cell phone to his ear. He sees Milton see him,
quickly backs into the shadows.
FRANK (O.S.)
Piper!
NormaJean looks up as the Accountant enters.
NORMAJEAN
Have a seat sweetie. Mary there
will be right with you.
Indian Mother Mary turns. Piper's replacement. She stops in
her tracks. Stares at the Accountant.
He winks at her.
A shiver runs through Mother Mary. She backs away then
rushes from the diner.
NORMAJEAN
Mary?!
Fat Lou leans from the Kitchen window.
FAT LOU
Where's she going?
20.
The Accountant turns to Lou. Stares. Then --
ACCOUNTANT
You. Fat fuck. Come here.
Lou stares.
FAT LOU
What did you call me?
The Accountant smiles.
Fat Lou vanishes from the window then BURSTS from the kitchen.
FAT LOU
I said, what did you call--
ACCOUNTANT
--I called you fat fuck' and we had
better leave it at that unless you'd
prefer I call you dead fat fuck.'
FAT LOU
Wha-what?
ACCOUNTANT
I'm looking for someone. An old
man. White hair. Five-eleven.
The Accountant smells the air, embraces it.
ACCOUNTANT
He was here earlier. Traveling
light. Likely on foot.
FAT LOU
Who are you?
ACCOUNTANT
I'm the Accountant.
FAT LOU
That's supposed to mean something
to me?
ACCOUNTANT
It will if I add you to the books.
And if you don't tell me what I
want to know...
NormaJean opens her mouth to speak. Shuts it.
21.
The Accountant turns to her, quickly. So quickly she takes a
step back.
ACCOUNTANT
You had something to say?
NORMAJEAN
He was here. Earlier.
ACCOUNTANT
Yes. We've established that.
NORMAJEAN
Terrible tipper.
ACCOUNTANT
I'm sure he was. Where did he go?
She points.
NORMAJEAN
That way. West. On foot.
Piper is curled up in a fetal position in the big back seat.
She sits up slowly. Her eyes are blackened. But clearly
Milton has cleaned her up. She props herself on an elbow,
looks at the jacket covering her.
Milton is driving. He gazes out the window...up to the sky.
Piper looks.
The MOON hangs a few days from full.
Piper slides over the seat, drags Milton's jacket with her,
then slips into it, wrapping herself as if cold.
MILTON
Want me to roll the window up?
PIPER
You didn't kill him did you?
22.
MILTON
No but he'll likely piss blood for
a day or two.
PIPER
Thanks for that.
MILTON
Hungry?
He gestures through the windshield as they pass a Welcome to
Utah sign. Beyond, there are lights ahead.
PIPER
Utah?
MILTON
You mentioned San Francisco.
PIPER
Appreciate what you done for me
back there but I ain't takin you
all the way to--
MILTON
--My business is in Nevada. Can
you get me that far?
PIPER
What business?
MILTON
I'm looking for someone. You
hungry or not?
Piper considers for a moment, then--
PIPER
Yeah. I could eat.
MILTON
Name's Milton. You're Piper,
right?
PIPER
You try to kill me and dump me in
the desert I'll cut your nuts off.
MILTON
Fair enough.
23.
Pool tables, old pin ball machines and an odd mix of BIKERS,
COWBOYS and the SLUTS who love them.
Piper and Milton slide into a booth. Piper eyes a Latino
BUSBOY, nice biceps, jeans too tight.
ROY, a greasy fella in his fifties approaches, big happy
looking fucker, owns the joint.
GREASY FELLA
Greetings folks, welcome to the
Bull by the Balls...
He stops. Smile fades. Stares at Milton, mouth agape.
MILTON
Roy.
ROY
Milton?
Roy doesn't even try to hide his dislike of Milton.
ROY
Thought you were dead.
MILTON
You hoped I was dead. Not the same.
ROY
You planning on staying?
Milton eyes a door marked Motel Guests.
MILTON
Got a problem with that?
ROY
Your money's good as any Ispect.
But be gone by dawn.
With Roy turns his back on them and walks away.
PIPER
What was that all about?
MILTON
Back in another life I used to
drive a truck through these parts.
24.
PIPER
And you'd spend the night here?
MILTON
I'd spend the night here fucking
his wife.
Suddenly Milton twists around, stares toward the bar.
PIPER
What's wrong?
MILTON
I...nothing I guess.
A large breasted waitress, fuckin' hot for a woman in her
fifties, approaches with chips and salsa. Eyes Milton.
CANDY
Well, hello. I'm Candy. Start you
off with some drinks?
MILTON
Beer.
PIPER
Same.
Candy plops two pens and index cards on the table.
CANDY
And I'll need to see your IDs.
Piper pulls her license absently and slides it over, begins
filling out the card.
MILTON
What is this?
PIPER
Guess it's been awhile since you
drove that truck through here.
CANDY
You want a drink? You gotta be a
member. Dry county.
MILTON
You're kidding.
CANDY
Welcome to Utah, Mr...
25.
She takes his license.
MILTON
Call me Milton.
CANDY
This license isn't just expired.
It's an antique.
MILTON
Fine, then bring me a milk.
She tosses his card on the table.
CANDY
For you, gorgeous, we'll break the
rules. Shhhh, don't tell nobody.
Milton watches her go. Drinking her up.
PIPER
You gonna tap that?
MILTON
Tap what?
PIPER
Jeez, Milton, how long's it been?
Sounds like you used to stick it in
anything with a crack.
MILTON
Yeah. Well. I've been distracted.
PIPER
Suit yourself. But nobody reaches
the end and says, Wish I hadn't
fucked so much.
Milton's gaze returns to Candy. Even a man as driven as he
needs a reboot sometimes. Candy catches his look, smiles.
Piper slides from the booth.
MILTON
Where are you...?
PIPER
I'm gonna do my nails, take a hot
bath and sleep in a warm bed.
MILTON
What about your beer?
26.
PIPER
You drink it. See you at dawn.
But she walks right passed the Motel Guests door and
approaches the Busboy, who's already eyeing her.
As she does, our focus settles on a shadowy area at the back
of the bar. JONAH KING steps into the light. Ruggedly good
looking. He wears a necklace with something bulky hidden
beneath his shirt. There's an old scar under his left eye
but a scar on this guy simply adds to his fuckabilty factor.
He glances at Milton then --
JONAH KING
It's Roy isn't it?
Roy spins from the bar, smiles a friendly smile.
ROY
Sure is. Get you a drink friend?
JONAH KING
Fantastic place you have here. You
don't happen to rent it out for
parties do you?
ROY
We sure do. You planing a party?
Again Jonah glances at Milton.
JONAH KING
Oh yes. Tonight, in fact.
The Television chatters away with local nightly news. Frank
ignores it, paces on the phone. As he does, we see Jonah
King's face on the TV. The same guy from the bar. Archive
footage of him preaching, warm, friendly.
27.
FRANK TV NEWS

KNOCK KNOCK
FRANK
I gotta go.
Frank clicks his phone shut, jerks the door open to find --
The Accountant smiling at him.
ACCOUNTANT
There was an old man, yes?
FRANK
Wha?
The Accountant sniffs the air.
ACCOUNTANT
White hair. Angry with attitude.
FRANK
Sumbitch kicked me in the face.
Who are you?
ACCOUNTANT
I'm the Accountant.
FRANK
The wha? I called the cops, not a
bean-counter?
ACCOUNTANT
The old man? Where did he go?
FRANK
Fuck should I know where he went?
I woke up and all three were gone.
28.
ACCOUNTANT
All three?
FRANK
The bitch, the old man and my car!
ACCOUNTANT
What kind of car?
FRANK
You know what, fuck you. You ain't
no cop. I'm done talking.
Frank starts to close the door but the Accountant grabs his
wrist, twists him around and shoves him into the room!
Frank doesn't stumble forward. He flies. Lifted off the
ground his toes drag the floor, Frank SLAMS into the opposite
wall and bounces into the dresser.
FRANK
You son of a --
Frank staggers to his feet. Dazed. Mouth bleeding. He
wipes blood onto the back of his hand.
FRANK
You...you made me bleed.
Frank pulls a baseball bat from behind the dresser.
FRANK
You leave me no choice but to beat
you with this Louisville Slugger.
Frank takes a step, swings at the Accountant.
The Accountant dodges.
Bat SMASHES down on the TV. SPARKS & GLASS fly.
The Accountant STOMPS on the bat, SNAPS it in two.
SLOMO: The short end rips from Frank's hands, knocks him
backwards. The piece spins in the air - for a second, hangs
there until...
The Accountant snatches it, letting his follow-through gather
momentum.
Frank can only watch as the Accountant -
HURLS THE JAGGED TIP OF THE BAT RIGHT AT HIM --
29.
The tip STRIKES Frank in the shoulder with such force, it
impales him up to the knob. Drives him backwards where it
embeds into the wall!
The Accountant grabs the broken barrel end of the bat, tosses
it from hand to hand with a loud SLAP of flesh on wood.
ACCOUNTANT
What kind of car?
FRANK
(dazed) I...what?
ACCOUNTANT
Your car. What kind is it?
Frank stares down at the bat protruding from his shoulder.
FRANK
Wha...what did you do?
The Accountant reaches out and twists the bat. Frank SCREAMS
out in pain.
ACCOUNTANT
Answer the question.
FRANK
A 67 GTO! Arrgg!
The Accountant turns and walks toward the door. Stops to eye
a framed photo of Piper and Frank on the dresser.
FRANK
Hey! Just hold on!
The Accountant pivots and flings the barrel of the bat.
FRANK'S POV
It's coming right at his face. Frank tries to dodge...twists
his head...no good.
The other end of the broken bat RAMS through his face, PINS
his head to the wall. The words Louisville Slugger just
visible where Frank's face should be.
We're staring into two motel rooms. We're cheating...the
wall that divides the rooms...divides the screen. The beds
in each room butted up against the dividing wall.
On one side we see Piper, on her back. Still clothed. At
her feet, on his knees and completely naked, the Busboy.
He's painting her toenails.
On the other side we see Milton, on his back. Candy riding
him like a fucking big-tittied stallion. Candy is a SCREAMER.
The Busboy looks up, timidly. Then...
BUSBOY
Uh, are we gonna do it?
PIPER
Well, I don't know, baby. Depends
on how well you do those nails.
Now pay attention. You might need
to redo that one.
He hunches over and gets back to work. As Piper ties her
hair up with a pink bandanna. Candy's SEX SCREAMS are
starting to annoy the fuck out of her.
She twists around with frustration and POUNDS the wall.
PIPER
Shut the fuck up in there!
Milton twist and POUNDS the wall right back.
33.
MILTON
You shut the fuck up!
That's it!
Piper swings her legs off of the bed. Busboy wasn't prepared
and topples backwards to the floor.
PIPER
(giggles) Oh! Sorry, I didn't
mean...
She stops. Stares.
Movement. Someone stepped quickly away from the window.
Piper BURSTS into the room ready to kick ass and take names.
But...the place is...empty. Food still on the plates. Beer
in the mugs. The TV over the bar is still on.
We see footage of a Nevada Amber Alert. Baby Tabitha still
missing A photo of a baby in pink onesie. Then appearing
beside it...the photo of Jonah King.
TV NEWS
...issued an all points bulletin for
Jonah King's immediate detention in
connection with the murder of a young
married couple in Loveland, Colorado.
Their infant girl is believed to have
been abducted by this religious sect.
A nation-wide Amber Alert is now in
full effect.
Piper stares at the TV for a moment, then scans the bar.
What the fuck?
She eyes the EXIT sign where an assortment of athletic
equipment hangs from the wall.
Still empty. Piper turns toward the door marked Motel
Guests then hesitates.
Instead she dives under a booth table...as...
The back door opens.
PIPER'S POV
LEGS. Three sets. Beat up sneakers. Work boots. Cowboy
boots with a duct tape patch.
A door opens. Piper sucks in breath. More legs appear.
ANOTHER ANGLE
35.
Shadows approach the desk counter near the Motel Guests
door. There's an open guest book on the counter top.
CLOSE ON GUEST BOOK
As a weathered hand comes into view. A finger traces down to
the last two entries.
Piper Lee RM 111
John Milton RM 112
Candy's still on top. She is, as we say in the fuck
industry, close.
CANDY
Close'm'close'm'close'm'close.
Suddenly Milton's head jerks toward the door.
His hand shoots beneath his pillow as--
The door BURSTS OPEN!
MAN WITH AN IRON PIPE held high rushes into the room.
Milton comes up with a 357 hand cannon!
KAFOOM!
IRON PIPE is BLOWN backwards into MAN WITH MACHETE!
Milton thrusts upright, suddenly Candy finds herself beneath
him as --
Machete HEAVES Iron Pipe to the side and rushes toward Milton
as -- KAFOOM! He's blown off his feet!
KER-SMASH!
The window shatters as a MAN WITH BASEBALL BAT dives, hits,
rolls and comes up swinging!
Milton snakes an arm beneath Candy and rolls from the bed
with her! As they fall--
The bat SLAMS onto the mattress just missing them as --
KA-BOOM!
36.
Milton turns Baseball Bat's head into a canoe!
Milton on bottom again as they crash to the floor, still
intertwined.
FWOOM!
The door adjoining Milton and Piper's room EXPLODES open at
his feet!
MAN WITH AXE and MAN WITH SHOTGUN enter!
Milton, presses Candy's face into his chest, twisting his
body to shield her as his 357 THUNDERS twice!
Shotgun's eye vaporizes in a mist! He drops to his knees.
Man with Axe clutches his throat...blood gushing...turns and
flees back into the adjoining room as --
KUH-FWAM!
The bathroom door flies open!
MILTON'S POV
Staring under the bed, Cowboy boots with duct tape patch
appears.
Chamber opens. Shells drop to dirty carpet. Milton rolls
Candy over, still connected. Fumbles in his bag on the floor.
COWBOY with SLEDGE HAMMER freezes at the carnage. Can't see
Milton. Because he's hidden by the bed.
COWBOY WITH SLEDGE
Old Man. You know you can't stop
what's comin' That little girl's
as good as dead.
TWO BULLETS slide into the 357. Chamber SNICKS shut.
Milton aims under the bed. FIRES!
Half the man's foot is blown to hell! He hops then crashes
to the floor!
He and Milton make eye contact beneath the bed...a nanosecond
before Sledge Hammer's forehead implodes.
A NOISE
Milton rolls Candy beneath him again and raises his head just
in time to see--
37.
MAN WITH SICKLE enter!
He stares at his dead comrades in rage then glares at Milton.
The glare becomes fear.
Milton's already aiming the 357, then --
CLICK. CLICK-CLICK-CLICK
Sickle smiles, raises the bladed weapon and--
KUR-RUNCH!
The top of his head SPATTERS BLOOD as a hockey stick crashes
down from above and behind.
Sickle drops to the floor revealing Piper, white knuckling
the hockey stick...her face pale.
MILTON
Thanks. Apparently I shot my wad.
Milton stares down into Candy's face.
Her whole body QUAKES...CONVULSES. She sucks in breath and
opens her eyes.
CANDY
Jesus Christ. You're the best fuck
I've ever had.
Piper crosses to the adjoining room.
CANDY
Hello? Do you mind?! We're...
Candy sits up and suddenly takes in her surroundings. She
SCREAMS, wraps herself in a sheet and flees from the room.
PIPER'S POV INTO HER ROOM
Man with Axe is lying face down in his own blood. Dead. But
it's Busboy who draws Piper's attention. Lying beneath blood
drenched white sheets. He never saw it coming.
PIPER
Aw, hell.
Milton, in pants, pulls his shirt on, rolls Man with
Shotgun's face with his boot. Reloads the 357.
MILTON
I definitely got their attention.
38.
PIPER
What. The fuck? You know these people?
Milton flings his duffle over his shoulder.
MILTON
Come on. There are probably more.
The car RUMBLES to life!
PIPER
They were trying to kill us!
MILTON
Yes.
41.
PIPER
They were trying to kill you.
MILTON
Yes.
Milton floors it! As the GTO fishtails toward the highway--
THROUGH WINDSHIELD
The Accountant steps from the back door of the bar.
Hunter and Hunted glare.
MILTON
Christ.
Piper's attention is still on the dead cops.
PIPER
Christ is right! They start
shooting with no warning?! What
are you, a murderer? You escape
from prison or something?
The GTO tears onto the highway!
IN REARVIEW MIRROR
The Accountant just stands there...fading into the darkness.
PIPER
Well?! Which is it?!
MILTON
Both.
Piper raises the gun, points it at Milton.
PIPER
What have you gotten me into? I
should...I should...Jesus, I just
killed a cop! I'm going to prison.
Give me one good reason I shouldn't
shoot you in the face.
MILTON
Because I'm driving.
PIPER
You know what I mean!
42.
Milton gestures through the windshield, toward the distant
brake lights ahead.
MILTON
They took my grand-baby. Took my
grand-baby and killed my...
He breaks off. Looks away.
THROUGH WINDSHIELD
We see the lighted Amber Alert sign come into view and
quickly blur passed.
Piper stares at Milton.
PIPER
The little girl on the news? The
baby girl they're looking for?
Milton nods.
PIPER
But the news said the baby's
parents were...
Piper stops.
Milton's eyes glisten. He speaks in a whisper.
MILTON
Sons of bitches killed my daughter.
Piper stares. Milton steadies himself.
MILTON
So Yeah. I busted out. And I'm
gonna get my grand-baby back. I'm
gonna get her back and I'm gonna
kill every last one of the fuckers.
(A BEAT)
You want out, I'll understand.
Piper considers, then --
KUH-FWAM!
They both slam into their seats as the GTO is rear-ended.
43.
Milton fights with the wheel as the muscle car fishtails. He
mashes the accelerator pulling out of the spin!
MILTON
In the back seat. Now.
PIPER
What? Why?
MILTON
Now!
Piper scrambles into the back seat as Milton watches the
cruiser pull up along side him.
MILTON
Shotgun. It's already loaded.
Piper digs the shotgun from the duffle and heaves it into the
front seat.
MILTON
Have the other one ready. Not the
357. The OLD one.
THROUGH PASSENGER WINDOW
The cruiser pulls up and matches the GTO's speed. After a
beat the Accountant turns and smiles at Milton.
Milton smiles back, lifts the shotgun, shoves the barrel
through the passenger window.
BOOOM!
MILTON'S POV
44.
The Accountant brushes shattered glass from his shoulder.
When he looks back at Milton its with a face of arrogance. A
cat toying with a three-legged mouse. He pulls the cruiser
next to Milton. Matches the GTO's speed. Shouts across.
ACCOUNTANT
It's over, Milton. Stop the car.
MILTON
I can't do that.
ACCOUNTANT
Really? What makes you think you
have a choice?
MILTON
I got something I gotta do first.
ACCOUNTANT
Then you should have done it a long
time ago.
MILTON
I didn't have to do it a long time ago!
ACCOUNTANT
Milton, I will kill that nice woman
in the backseat to get to you.
MILTON
I won't let you do that.
ACCOUNTANT
Again. What makes you think you
have a choice?
MILTON
(TO PIPER)
Now.
Piper hands Milton the ancient Six Shooter. Milton snatches
it, points it across the gap between cars, pulls back the
hammer with a thunderous...KUH-THUNK.
MILTON
This does.
The Accountant's eyes widen.
SSHHU-BOOOM!
45.
It's as if God tripped, fell and the entire earth shook as a
result!
The recoil nearly rips Milton's arm off.
We travel with the slug, fire trailing it, as it SLOMOs
toward the Accountant...his eyes continuing to widen...the
muscles in his face contracting.
The Accountant cuts the wheel. Hard.
He wracks his head around as the slug just kisses his cheek.
Milton fights with the wheel as --
IN REARVIEW MIRROR
The Cruiser bucks up and over the guard rail.
Milton manages to stop the GTO before it slams into the rail.
The GTO BUCKS and STALLS.
He breathes a sigh, then turns and stares in the direction
they'd been going.
He can just make out the fleeing Cultist's tail lights.
46.
The back door opens. Piper leaps out.
MILTON
Piper! Wait!
Milton watches the taillights vanish over a distant ridge.
He starts the engine...then hesitates...
THROUGH BACK WINDOW
Piper approaches the destroyed guard rail.
CLOSE ON SPEEDOMETER
The needle hovers at 95 mph.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
Piper behind the wheel. Milton, shirtless, his stomach
wrapped in homemade bandages, grabs his shotgun, reloads.
MILTON
My daughter got mixed up with the son
of a bitch right out of college.
PIPER
She knew him? She knew Jonah King,
the man they think killed...
She stops herself.
MILTON
She knew him. The world was in a
fuckin tailspin and King was
preaching quiet revolution.
He places the shotgun on the dash, grabs the 357.
MILTON
It was four months before she
realized quiet' meant hiding in
the basement, cutting the heads off
chickens.
PIPER
Jonah King was into voodoo?
Milton reloads the 357, slowly, methodically.
MILTON
Voodoo, the occult, not much he
wasn't into. When she told him she
was leaving, he helped her pack.
Gassed up her car. Cooked her a
hot meal. Then while she slept he
broke her leg in three places with
a tire iron.
PIPER
Jesus.
She twists her pink bandanna nervously in her hands.
48.
MILTON
She learned her lessen. Was a good
little follower for eighteen
months. That's when they met with
some witch doctor bullshit artist
in Chinatown. It was Chinese New
Year so the place was wall to wall
slants. She saw her chance,
stabbed Jonah in the face with a
souvenir corkscrew and vanished
into the crowd.
PIPER
Milton. Your daughter was in a
cult for two years and you didn't
know? Why didn't you help her?
Milton grabs the ancient six shooter. It's got real weight.
His blood-stained fingers run down the scrolled steel. The
gun almost seems alive. Pops the chamber.
MILTON
I didn't find out about any of this
until...until I got locked up.
Only two bullets left. He SNAPS the gun shut.
Shoves it into his duffle.
PIPER
Not gonna reload?
MILTON
Only had three bullets to begin...
PIPER
Milton.
THROUGH WINDSHIELD
Lights ahead. Several. And road flares. There's been an
accident.
Milton eases the shotgun into his lap.
PIPER
That's his truck.
MILTON
Stay put. I won't be long.
Skanky tries to calm the crying baby. Tattoo shoves Piper
onto the travel couch then hands the gun to Business Woman.
BUSINESS WOMAN
Please. Try something.
53.
Jonah climbs into the RV, closes the door.
JONAH KING
Let's go.
PIPER
You killed him! You bastard you --
WHACK!
Piper's head rocks back as Business Woman pistol whips her.
BUSINESS WOMAN
Next time I shoot that mouth right
off your face.
Jonah gazes out the window as the RV pulls away, Piper's SOBS
rising behind him.
JONAH'S POV
Milton's body lays there. Unmoving. His one eye staring
skyward. Void of life as the RV pulls away, leaving the
cluster of cars, the wreck and body of Milton behind.
Milton falls heavily across the front seats. Ties Piper's
bandanna around his head, covers his now gaping eye.
The windshield SHATTERS. Glass splinters down on Milton. He
reaches for the keys.
Milton flips open the 357 as he FISHTAILS the GTO back onto
the highway. He dangles the 357 out the window.
Jonah glances through the back window. Double takes.
HIS POV
A rapidly growing black blotch on the road. In seconds that
blotch reveals itself as the GTO ripping up the highway,
gaining fast. The baby SCREAMS in the background. When
Jonah speaks...it is with wonder.
JONAH KING
Look at this. He's still coming.
57.
TATTOO
Who's still coming?
JONAH KING
The old man. He's alive.
TATTOO AND PIPER
What?
Piper tries to stand. Business Woman backhands her!
BUSINESS WOMAM
Stay down! That's impossible!
TATTOO
You shot him in the face! He can't--
JONAH KING
Don't you see? We stand at the
crossroads! Did you think we would
just idly change the world? The
forces of evil challenge us! This is
wonderful! We show ourselves to be
worthy. I'm so very proud of each
one of you.
Tattoo and Business Woman beam.
Skanky pulls her tit out, shoves it in the baby's face. The
kid goes quiet as --
The back glass SHATTERS.
Everyone ducks!
Milton struggles to pull the shotgun back inside...struggles
to keep the big GTO on the road.
Distracted by the newcomers...we see what Milton does not.
THROUGH WINDSHIELD
The RV pulls off the road to the left.
Milton looks up just as he passes the turn off.
MILTON
Shit!
He SLAMS on his brakes.
Leopardskin's eyes go wide. Survival kicks in. She jerks
the wheel.
Piper watches as the bucking RV forces Jonah and Business
Woman to turn their backs on her.
59.
Piper leaps from the couch, rushes up behind and shoves them
toward the shattered back window!
Jonah snatches a cabinet, drops his gun!
It slides beneath the foldout bed.
But Business Woman hits the giant opening and flips up and
out of the RV!
Milton looks up as Business Woman SLAMS into the ground and
TUMBLES just out of his path. She sits up...dazed. Alive.
Milton swerves...just enough...to...
KAFWAM!
What doesn't explode from the force KUH-THUMPS as the GTO
bucks over her body.
Milton grits through the pain. A bloody angry smile.
Jonah stares out the back glass in shock.
PIPER
Oops.
JONAH KING
I am patient and forgiving, but
that was wrong of you.
He turns to her.
JONAH KING
I'm going to kill you now. And
then I'm going to rape your corpse.
So that in the afterlife you might
consider your sin this day.
Piper CRACKS her knuckles.
PIPER
Great. Between now and then.
I'm'a fuck you up.
He takes a step and swings a punch.
60.
But she leaps at his face, closing the gap too quickly. Her
French Manicure digs in. Jonah screams. They both go down!
The baby WAILS.
Skanky crawls into the cramped sleeper-bunk above the driver.
Pulls the baby with her, tucks back into the corner, away
from the battle in the RV's cabin.
Milton is gaining when --
BOOM!
The back glass SHATTERS.
The radio and dash explode!
MILTON
Son of a bitch.
Milton snatches the 357, points it out the back glass and
opens fire.
BOOM!
Milton's POV
A white dot spider webs the Viper's windshield left.
BOOM!
Windshield middle!
BOOM!
The windshield suddenly turns red from the inside as a dot
appears in front of the driver.
The Viper jerks right drifts off of the dirt path!
FOOM
61.
The Lincoln bursts through the dust cloud behind it. Thin
Old Man leans from the driver's window, FIRES.
Slugs PEPPER the GTO.
Milton spins in his seat.
THROUGH WINDSHIELD
The RV has pulled ahead and vanishes over a hilltop.
Milton FLOORS it!
Piper on top, Jonah's face looks like he ran into a barbed
wire fence! He howls in pain and manages to slip a hand
around her throat!
Piper feels it. His fingers tighten. He shoves her away
from him...she can no longer dig into his face.
Her arms flail. Reaching for anything. Grasping.
Her face turns red. Eyes bulge. Fuck.
She claws his shirt open.
And there...hanging around his neck is a small corkscrew.
Chinese in design.
She snatches it and --
SHUNK!
Stabs it into Jonah's shoulder, twists it deeper in.
He SCREAMS. Releasing her!
Lady in Leopardskin's face drops.
THROUGH WINDSHIELD
The Lincoln fireball SLAMS into the ground before her!
Lady in Leopardskin shields her face as --
Milton kicks the car into drive, jerks a 180 and speeds off
toward the RV.
Jonah sits up...he pulls at the corkscrew and screams. It
won't budge.
He glares at Piper.
63.
She scans for a weapon. Nothing. She snatches an umbrella
from a coat rack. It'll have to do...
There's a machete hanging beneath it.
She drops the umbrella grabs the machete. Smiles at Jonah.
PIPER
Give me the baby and I'll make the
pain go away.
Suddenly everyone SLAMS into the side of the RV!
Piper clings to the old stove. She watches in horror as --
Jonah's gun slides from beneath the foldaway bed. It slides
right up to him.
He snatches it.
Piper leaps through the door.
Milton is gaining as --
THROUGH WINDSHIELD
Piper swings out, clinging to the door for dear life!
Milton jerks the wheel.
Lady in Leopardskin slows as Milton's GTO goes into a spin.
There's a smile on her face. She thinks he's lost control!
Until the GTO does a 180. Milton now driving in reverse.
His shotgun pointing through the remnants of windshield...
...directly at Lady in Leopardskin.
BOOM!
Her head goes buh-bye.
Several officers motion Cap behind the bar toward an open
cabinet. Cap crosses to the cabinet and kneels.
73.
Candy hides within. Naked, hugs her knees. Shivers.
CAP
(TO MEN)
Get me a blanket. And get a medic
in here.
He turns to Candy, offers a comforting smile.
CAP
You're gonna be okay now. I won't
let anything happen to you.
CANDY
He...he killed them. He killed all
of them.
CAP
Who did?
CANDY
No. You don't understand, we was
fuckin'. He killed them while we was
fuckin'. That's never happened to me
before, has it happened to you?
Cap turns to Sarge who is standing near.
CAP
Let's get a shrink in here too.
Engines dangle from assorted winches. Auto tools hang from
the walls. Stacks of tires, a pile of carburetors.
Webster throws a lever.
The wrecker winch lowers the GTO.
Piper crosses to the front, pops the hood. Webster joins
her, stares at the engine. Frowns.
WEBSTER
Engine's shot to hell.
74.
PIPER
Can you fix it?
He leans close, hands caress the engine, searching.
Somewhere near a fire CRACKLES. Piper turns.
HER POV
Milton stands just through the barn doors, stokes a fire
within a 50 gallon drum. Flames rising.
PIPER
I don't...how is this possible?
WEBSTER
He loved his daughter.
PIPER
Lots of daddy's love their
daughters, doesn't explain
shattering reality.
WEBSTER
That one loved his little girl
enough to make her hate him.
(off her stare)
Like Timmy yellin' at Lassie to go
home?
Piper looks even more confused.
WEBSTER
You never watched...forget it.
Milton was a bad husband but he was
a good father. Used to say it was
the only thing he was ever good at.
Then we went and got mixed up with
the wrong crowd. Power and money
and once you're in there ain't no
gettin' out. So to keep her safe
he vanished the year before she
went off to college.
PIPER
Obviously you got out.
Webster glances at Milton for a moment.
WEBSTER
The bastards we were workin' for, they
were gonna kill us when the job was
done.
(MORE)
75.
WEBSTER (CONT'D)
So the day before, Milton paid'em a
little visit. He went alone you see.
I didn't know. I would'a gone with him
but I didn't know.
Webster goes very quiet.
WEBSTER
Being a daddy wasn't the only thing
Milton was good at. Sumbitch was
good at being a friend.
A huge sliding barn door opens into a giant stall revealing a
1969 Chevrolet Nova 396 L-78 and a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro.
Milton and Piper stare. Webster smiles.
WEBSTER
Milt, if memory serves you were
always partial to the Nova, yes?
Milton crosses to the 69 Nova. Stops. Stares.
HIS POV
Piper is curled up beneath a quilt in the front seat.
MILTON
What are you doing?
Piper pops awake, sits up. Already angry.
PIPER
Fuck are you doing?!
Milton stares.
PIPER
Think you were gonna sneak off by
yourself?! Go it alone?!
MILTON
Uh, no. I need your help. If
you're still willing.
Piper stares for a moment.
PIPER
Oh.
A beat.
PIPER
Well if I'd known that I would have
slept in a bed!
78.
Milton behind the wheel, Piper has her bare feet on the
windshield as she loads shotgun shells into the slits on a
hunting vest.
PIPER
I never knew him. Momma said he
was a drifter.
MILTON
I ain't your daddy.
PIPER
Fuck you if you are.
Milton notices something in the rear view.
80.
MILTON
Shit.
Piper sits up, stares.
THROUGH BACK GLASS
There's a State Trooper's car way back there. Fuck. There
are two. No lights yet but they are coming up fast.
PIPER
What do we do?
MILTON
Nothing yet. Not until...
The lights come on.
PIPER
Oh shit. They know.
MILTON
We can't stop.
Milton mashes the peddle to the floor.
PIPER
Milton, this will never work.
MILTON
It'll work.
PIPER
No. It won't. Nobody gets away
anymore. In fifteen minutes there
will be choppers, we'll be all over
the news...
She breaks off. Her mouth drops.
THROUGH WINDSHIELD
As the NOVA tops a ridge, in the distance we see a police
barricade. Several State Trooper Cruisers line the roadway
in front of a bridge crossing a dry ravine. Cruisers line
the side of the road.
The barricade is approaching stupidly fast. For the first
time on this adventure, Milton looks...concerned.
PIPER
Just don't stop.
MILTON
Too many of them.
PIPER
Just keep driving.
MILTON
I'm...I'm sorry I got you into--
PIPER
--They took your granddaughter,
Milton, and now these badge-wearing
fuckers are trying to stop you.
You crawled out of the Goddamn
abyss...and a few fat-assed county
Mounties are giving you pause?
Your grand-baby needs you.
Milton nods. Turns back to the road.
PIPER
You know what happens to her if
they stop us.
(MORE)
82.
PIPER (CONT'D)
You lose the last connection you
will ever have to this world. You
gotta drive.
A scowl crosses his face.
PIPER
No. You don't just drive. Drive
angry! Drive with the motherfuckin'
rage that'll take us through that
motherfuckin' roadblock!
The Accountant is driving. Calm. Whistling.
Piper and Milton stare.
PIPER
Uh...what is that?
MILTON
Get down!
83.
Milton cuts the wheel hard as one of the Cruisers ROCKETS
right at them.
The Accountant smiles. Then cuts the wheel. Hard.
THROUGH WINDSHEILD
There's nowhere to go!
MILTON
Shotgun!
Piper shoves the shotgun in his hand. He quickly shoves it
out the window and --
84.
THROUGH WINDSHIELD
We can just make out the Accountant's face. He's smiling.
Piper stares through the back window.
PIPER
I don't think...why aren't they
following us?
Milton slips into his hunting vest. A scowl on his face.
MILTON
They're likely scared of you.
PIPER
Now what?
MILTON
Now we drive.
87.
We pull back...
Milton wears a mask of rage as he rips the Nova into a 180,
his 357 aimed out the window.
KABOOM! BOOM! KUHFWOOM!
He's shooting Cultists in a barrel.
But the Nova is the better weapon. He FLOORS it, then LOCKS
the brakes, fishtailing.
Milton is ROARING in anger as the NOVA is PEPPERED with
bullets and shotgun blasts. GLASS, SPARKS and CHAOS rain
down on him. Steam and oil SPEW from the engine.
Milton SCREAMS as the Nova's cab turns into a warzone. He
clambers deep inside the wreck. Praying they don't ignite
the leaking fuel. Then the firing stops.
