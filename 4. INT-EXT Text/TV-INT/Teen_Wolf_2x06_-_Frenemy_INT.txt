      Out of the haze of VIDEO STATIC, the face of Jackson 
      Whittemore comes into focus. Peering into the lens of Matt s 
      camera, he makes one last adjustment to its position.

      Lying back on his bed, a smile creeps over his face in 
        anticipation of his glorious transformation into a werewolf.

      A BLAST OF STATIC jumps the video to hours later. Now asleep, 
      Jackson stirs, slowly turning over.

      ANOTHER BURST OF STATIC jumps the footage further into the 
      night. Jackson sits up in bed. With a robotic stiffness, he 
      turns to face the camera as his eyes begin to GLOW.

      Lurching off the bed, his head snaps back, mouth falling open 
      to reveal a set of double-rowed teeth.

      It happens quickly and violently. Jackson s hands hit the 
      floor, body twisting and limbs wrenching, he transforms into 
      a reptilian shapeshifter now known as the Kanima.

      Launching up, he charges toward the video camera and then 
      right past it. The image cuts to BLACK.

      A NEW SCREEN appears and a message begins to type out 
      character by character: Ur video s done restoring. Call me.


      Allison pulls her car to the curb in front of the Martin home 
      and turns to Lydia.

                                    ALLISON
                    I need you to promise you won t say 
                    anything about what just happened.

                    How about you start with why Derek 
                    was there? Where Jackson went? What 
                    was wrong with Erica?

      Allison struggles in silence.

                    Part of the reason I m asking is 
                    because Scott and I aren t supposed

      Opening the door, she tries to get out, but Allison grabs 
      her, pulling her back.

                    None like that.

      She pulls free. Without another look back, she gets out and 
      slams the door shut as--


      Under the PULSING BOOM of house music and the flash of LASER 
      LIGHTS, Scott and Stiles try to blend in. Looking around, 
      however, Scott begins to notice something.

                                  SCOTT
                    Dude... Everyone in here is a dude. 
                    I think this is a gay club.

      He looks to Stiles who stands between two very tall DRAG *
      QUEENS.*

                    Nothing gets past those keen 
                    werewolf senses, does it?

      Only a few feet away, Danny takes a drink from the Bartender,  *
      NICK, and turns to survey the crowd. But the sight of his EX-*
      BOYFRIEND sends him turning back to the bar. Unable to *
      resist, he looks again and finds his Ex on the dance floor. 
      With someone else.

                                  NICK*
                    You re better off without him.

      Danny glances over. Nick gives an encouraging nod. So Danny *
      grabs his drink and walks off just as--

      Stiles and Scott push their way to the front of the bar.

                                  STILES

      Scott and Stiles drop down on the bar two of the worst

                                  NICK (CONT D)*
                    How about two cokes?

                    Coke s good. I m driving anyway.

      Nick slides the drinks over. Then points to Scott s.*

                    That one s paid for.

      Nick motions to a GUY down the bar, raising his drink in *
      cheers. Scott turns to Stiles, smiling with pride.

                                  STILES
                    Shut up.

                    I didn t say anything.

                                  STILES
                    Your face did.

      Stiles brings the soda to his lips, but pauses when he spots 
      someone in the crowd.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    I found Danny.

                    I found Jackson.

      Perched among light fixtures above, the Kanima moves like a 
      spider across the ceiling, stealthily making its way toward 
      the dance floor.

      And toward Danny.


      All humor gone, a now fearful Stiles shakily sets his drink 
      back on the bar next to Scott, who keeps his gaze on the 
      ceiling and the BLACK SHAPE perched there.

                                  SCOTT
                    Get Danny.

                                  STILES
                    What are you going to do?

      Without averting his eyes, Scott flicks open his fist, 
      unsheathing his CLAWS.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Works for me.*

      Scott steps into the crowd. The pounding MUSIC intensifies, *
      bodies twisting toward him while the Kanima creeps amid the 
      light fixtures above.

      Stiles presses through toward Danny, but quickly loses sight 
      of him.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Danny? Danny.

      Hearing Stiles, Scott takes his eyes off the ceiling to see 
      his friend struggling through the crowd. When he looks back 
      up--

      The creature is gone.

      Scott glances about the ceiling, searching every corner. But 
      he can t find it. As he begins to panic--

      Someone dancing bumps into him. Then another elbow jabs him 
      in the lower back, pushing him forward. The crowd packs 
      tighter, moving faster and faster with the beat of the music.

      PLUMES OF FOG BLAST out from a smoke machine, obscuring 
      Scott s view. STROBING LIGHTS create an almost nightmare 
      quality to the dancing bodies as--

      THE KANIMA S FACE appears, teeth bared. And then is gone just 
      as quickly. Scott whips around, trying to find it again. 

      In a FLASH of LIGHT he sees Danny. And with another FLASH - 
      the Kanima, right near him.

      IN ANOTHER FLASH - Derek appears, RED EYES blazing and fangs 
      bared.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/1212.

                    Derek--

      But he s gone in the next flash. Scott blinks, trying to find 
      him when SMOKE BILLOWS OUT again, laying a gray cloud over 
      the floor.

      Unable to see, Scott squeezes his eyes shut. When he opens 
      them they're GLOWING YELLOW. 

      Seeing now with the eyes of a WOLF, he focuses on HEAT 
      SIGNATURES coming off the dancing bodies. All except for 
      one...

      A sinewy, cold-blooded SILHOUETTE moving stealthily through 
      the crowd. Scott tries to push toward it, but the crowd edges 
      him back again. 

      Fog clearing, Stiles turns to see through the dancing crowd 
        as--one-by-one, people begin dropping.

      Bodies fall paralyzed to the floor in a path leading right 
      toward Danny. 

      Now elbowing back, Scott shoves through when--Danny s head 
      snaps forward. He falls. Blinking, not knowing what's 
      happening to his body as he collapses to the floor. 

      The Kanima rises, baring its fangs--

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Jackson.

      The creature blinks, hearing its name under the pulsing 
      music. For a brief second, its EYES return to those of 
      Jackson's HUMAN EYES, gazing on Scott in confusion. And then 
      looking at--

      Derek. 

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                      No--don t!

      But he swipes out with his claws, delivering a RUTHLESS SLASH 
      to the creature s throat. Staggering back, its hands clasp 
      over its throat as BLACK BLOOD spills across its fingers.

      People stop dancing amid the prostrate bodies on the floor. 
      The music stops. Witnesses look about, confused, shouts of 
      panic rising over the crowd.

                                  VOICE

      In the escalating panic, Scott can no longer see the Kanima 
      or Derek. But he does find--

      DROPS OF GLISTENING BLOOD on the dance floor, leading to an 
      open EXIT DOOR.


      Scott jumps into the passenger side while Stiles uses a 
      blanket to cover an unconscious Jackson in the backseat.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/1217.

      Off Scott s nod, Stiles hits the gas and heads for the exit. 
      But a SHERIFF S CAR swerves in to block them. As Scott and 
      Stiles stare in horror, the door clicks open and Sheriff

                    Well, do something.

      Stiles jumps out of the Jeep to face his father while Scott 
      turns to the backseat and a rapidly reviving Jackson.

      Frustrated, Stiles goes silent. Then looks up.

                                  STILES
                    I think I got something.

      Jackson's eyes flutter open. When he moves his head, he 
      winces in pain. Reaching up, his hand stops with the sound of 
      METAL CLANKING.

      He's now wearing pants. But he's also wearing CHAINS on both *
      his wrists and ankles in a van marked: BEACON HILLS SHERIFF S *
      DEPARTMENT PRISON TRANSPORT.

      Raising his shackled hands as realization hits him, Jackson 
      unclenches his teeth to spit out one name-- 

                                    JACKSON
                    Stiles.


      Stiles steps in while unzipping his backpack.*

                    Okay, I brought you some food--

      Two hands SNAP out, fingers grasping for his throat. Stiles *
      leans back just out of Jackson s reach as he swipes at him. 
      Gasping from exertion, he finally lowers his chained hands.

                                    JACKSON
                    Let me out. Now.

                    cheese or the turkey club?

      Stiles holds up two sandwiches from his backpack.

      Mr. Whittemore shows the same message to Sheriff Stilinski on

      onto her shoulders.

                    to you on the night of the first 
                    full moon.

      Jackson hesitates. For a moment all that can be heard is the 
      METALLIC CLINKING of the chains on his wrists and ankles.

                                    JACKSON
                    Nothing. Nothing happened.


      THE BELL RINGS sending students bolting from their seats. 
      Allison heads for the door, moving into the rush of teens 
      right behind Scott when--

                                  VICTORIA
                    Allison.

      She stops. While the other students leave, Allison turns to 
      face her mother in the empty classroom.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    We ve noticed quite a few calls

                      Stilinski.

                                    ALLISON
                    You told me to keep an eye on 
                    Lydia. Stiles has had a crush on 
                    her since the third grade. I m 
                    going to need to talk to him.

      Victoria nods. Taking the awkward silence as a cue to leave, 
      Allison goes for the door.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I know it s hard. Sitting here,

      With Allison sitting shotgun, Stiles quickly dials Mr. *

      Stiles tosses the phone out the open window and FLOORS IT.*


      Scott questions a now un-paralyzed and discharged Danny as he 
      dresses back into his regular clothes.

                    But we re good. I was actually 
                    doing him a favor.

      Bolting out of the patient room, Scott hurries for the doors. 
      But his mother, Melissa, steps in to block his exit.

      The Prison Transport Van now sits parked at Lookout Point. 
      Gathered just a few yards from the van, Scott, Stiles and 
      Allison discuss his latest discoveries.

                                  SCOTT (V.O.)
                    It doesn t matter. If we can save 
                    him, we have to try.

      Jackson rests back against the wall of the van. A weariness 
      settles over him, almost as if weighed down by the thought of 
      someone actually fighting to save him. Until he notices 
      something strange on his forearm...

      Raising it for a closer look, he finds the skin on his arm *
      slowly changing texture. Taking on the shape of SCALES. *
      Almost like the skin of a snake.

      FADE IN:


      Scott slides into Allison s car parked not far from the 
      Prison Transport Van and shuts the door.

                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles said he s going to check in 
                    on Lydia. She still hasn t forgiven 
                    him for promising to talk to her 
                    and then ditching her at her car.

                                    ALLISON
                    Not easy to explain.

      Scott turns to her with something else not easy to explain.

                                  SCOTT
                    How did your dad know where to be *
                    last night? He was there in the 
                    alley. Him and Gerard.

                                    ALLISON
                    They have people. Guys who monitor 
                    every camera in town. ATM s, 
                    traffic cameras. Have you seen the 
                    ones they put up in school?


      Nervously eyeing the scales rapidly forming on his arms, 
      Jackson can still hear Allison and Scott.

                                    ALLISON (V.O.)
                    You thought I told him?

                                  SCOTT (V.O.)
                    No. I didn t know. I was just...


      Allison turns to look Scott in the eyes.

                                    ALLISON
                    I m on your side, Scott. I m always 
                    on your side.

                                  SCOTT
                    I know. I m sorry. I just thought 
                    things would get back to normal.

                    Or at least normal enough so I 
                    could pass my classes.

                                    ALLISON
                    You ll pass.

      She slides into his arms and he pulls her close, breathing 
      her in as--


      Jackson begins to gasp. Breath becoming tighter and tighter 
      as his nails sharpen, forming into claws.

                                    JACKSON
                          (whispering to himself)
                    Stop. Please stop...


      Scott keeps his eyes on the Prison Transport Van nearby while 
      Allison s eyes begin to slip closed.

                                    ALLISON
                    Can you put some music on?

                                  SCOTT
                    Radio?

                                    ALLISON
                    Use Entune. It has Pandora.

      Scott taps on the screen bringing up the main Entune page 
      with its six apps. He hits Pandora and music begins to play.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Thanks. I felt like I was going to 
                    fall asleep in your arms.

                                  SCOTT
                    I like it when you fall asleep in 
                    my arms.

                                    ALLISON
                    I don t. When I wake up you re 
                    always gone.

                                  SCOTT
                    I only do that because I don t want 
                    to wake you.

                                    ALLISON
                    I d rather just wake up with you.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/1239.

                    You will. High school s only two *
                    more years.

                                    ALLISON
                    Which is hard enough for normal *
                    people to get through.*

      He nods, thinking for a moment.

                                  SCOTT
                    What if there was a way I could be 
                    normal?


      Shackles pulled taut, Jackson stands, teeth clenched. He 
      opens his mouth as if trying to shout for help, but then his 
      head snaps up in a violent jerk.


      Allison sits up to listen to Scott s explanation.

                                  SCOTT
                    I ve been thinking about this since *
                    we saw her in the hospital. Lydia *
                    was bitten by an Alpha, right? And *
                    Peter told Stiles if the bite 
                    doesn t turn you it ll kill you. 
                    But nothing happened to Lydia.*

                                    ALLISON
                    Meaning what? She s immune?*

                                  SCOTT
                    If she is, doesn t immunity mean 
                    you could be cured? Would you want 
                    that? If I could be cured?

                                    ALLISON
                    I want anything that lets me be 
                    with you. And not just for the rest 
                    of high school.

                    too good of a college. My grades *

      She pulls back so that he can clearly see her expression.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    I m serious.

                                  SCOTT
                    I know.

      Gently, he reaches up and brings her lips to his. They begin 
      kissing. But there s a difference this time. The kisses 
      aren t broken with smiles or moments of soft laughter typical 
      to young romance. It s urgent, serious.

      They pull each other closer and tighter, almost like two *
      people who know this might be the last time they ll be this 
      close. And as Scott s grip tightens around Allison s waist--


      The tendons in Jackson s neck press taut against the skin, 
      jaws snapping open as a second row of teeth pushes through 
      the gums in his mouth.

      His head wrenches to the side as--


      Allison's body presses against Scott s, each sensual and *
      perfect moment between them visually matched by a moment of 
      agonized, violent transformation for Jackson. Until finally--


      The doors of the Prison Transport Van SMASH OPEN. Eyes 
      burning with a murderous GLOW, the Kanima pushes off the 
      floor of the van and launches up into the moonlit sky.


      Half naked in the car, Allison and Scott sleep in perfect 
      peace. Until a HAND POUNDS against the window, jolting them 
      both awake.

      It s Stiles. Panic in his eyes.


      Scott, Allison and Stiles peer through the open doors of the 
      Prison Transport Van. The chains lie twisted and broken on 
      the floor amid Jackson s torn clothes.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/1241.

      With Allison peering over her shoulder, Lydia transcribes the 
      Bestiary pages from the desktop computer screen to a pad.
