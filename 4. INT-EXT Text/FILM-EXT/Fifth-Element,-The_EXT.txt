WRITTEN:	EGYPT 1913
OMAR and his mule zigzag along the bottom of sun scorched dunes.
TEMPLE
EXCAVATION - DAY
The mule and the boy finally reach a camp.
A few tents dwarfed by a huge
temple door jutting out of the sand.
The camp is deserted except for
some kids by the temple entrance holding large mirrors, reflecting light
into the temple.
Omar leaves his mule in the shade, seizes two goatskins and slips inside
the temple.
COLONNADE - DAY
A muffled SOUND grows steadily louder. Outside, a monstrous linear shadow
disturbs the kid's game and gradually darkens the temple entrance.
COLONNADE - DAY
The CLERK boards the ship carrying the case.
Omar hides in a corner,
frightened to death, hugging Billy's bag of drawings.
DESERT - DAY
The huge ship's main hatch closes.
TEMPLE - DAY
The ship lifts off and speeds away. Omar emerges from the temple gaping
at the ship as it vanishes in the sky.
PYRAMIDS
A gigantic shooting star flashes above the pyramids.
EARTH
ORBIT
The ship passes in front of us and heads for the stars disappearing at
unbelievable speed.
The background is a star-spattered cosmos.
WRITTEN:	500 YEARS LATER
Another, more modern, spaceship, fills the screen.
A warship belonging
to the Federal Army.
SPACE
In the middle of the shadows, a door to the nightmare has just opened.
Evil is back.
A round, moving mass, continually changing color.
CAPTAIN
(in awe)
What the hell can it be?
TECHNICIAN
Hook-up with the president in one
minute, General.
General Staedert remains calm.
STAEDERT
...Send out a probe.
SPACE.
Evil swallows the probe and immediately bubbles over with activity like a
furious volcano.
OUTSIDE
SPACESHIP
All of a sudden, outside the ship, the strange planet's activity ceases.
A black crust immediately covers it.
OUTSIDE
SPACESHIP
The missile explodes from the ship and penetrates its target.
The
explosion is swallowed like a fizzy pill in a small glass of water.
Nothing happens.
And then the mass grows larger.
SPACESHIP
A series of three missiles heads for the planet, which absorbs them all.
And literally doubles in size.
SCIENTIST
The planet's diameter has greatly
increased and it's moving toward the ship.
PRESIDENT
Staedert?
Get out of there immediately!
I don't want an incident, do you hear me,
Staedert?
STAEDERT
(worried)
...What do we have that's bigger than 240?
CAPTAIN
Nothing, General.
PRESIDENT
Staedert, get out of there!
That's an order!
A bead of sweat pearls Staedert's forehead. He is about to give an order
when a gigantic flame emerges from the planet and literally swallows
Staedert's spaceship.
STAEDERT
(eyes wide)
... Good God!
The flame fills the screen with a horrendous NOISE that....
SPACE
The Mondoshawan spaceship bursts through a star cluster and fills the
screen.

LABORATORY - DAWN
She has exited to a ledge on the 450th floor of a building, right in the
middle of Manhattan, which we discover for the first time.
The city has
become monstrous. Buildings rise 600 stories.
Cars fly.
Subways run
vertically...The girl edges along the narrow ledge, unfazed by the height.
The CHIEF leans out the vent, looking out into the void.
CHIEF
(to his men)
Go on follow her!
The COPS stare into the gaping void.
COP
...No way.
The CHIEF angrily pulls out his gun and shoots at the girl who ducks
around the corner of the building.
Unfortunately the other side in full of
cops as well.
A flying police car zooms up in front of her, sirens
blaring.
VOICE (O.S.)
This in the police.
Your status is illegal.
Please put up your hands and follow our
instructions!
The girl feels trapped.
She looks down into the endless 450 below and
all the cars flying underneath her.
Then she raises her arms... and dives
off.
NEW YORK
STREET
The police car roars up, sirens screaming then slows down and checks out
a dead-end flanked by a large vertical neon billboard. The dead-end is empty .
Korben's cab is hidden vertically behind the billboard.
Seeing nothing, the
police drive away.
KORBEN
We'll wait till things quiet down a bit.
You mind?
The girl grabs his shirt collar and pulls him close, whispers in his ear.
GIRL
(weak)
...Priest...
KORBEN
You're not that bad... Come on we'll
get you to a doctor.
The girl hands him the handle of the case, struck with the three Egyptian
suns.
GIRL
(weak)
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
KORBEN
Vito Cornelius?
The girl nods, then faints.
Korben is somewhat lost faced with so much
mystery.
OUTSIDE
ZORG'S
WAREHOUSE - DAY
Zorg walks along the street to his limo.
RIGHT ARM carries the empty
case.
ZORG
I don't like warriors!
They're too
narrow-minded, no sublety.
Worse,
they fight for hopeless causes..for honor!
Honor has killed millions of people but
hasn't saved a single one.
(pause)
You know what -- do I like though, I like killer.
A real dyed in the wool killer.
Cold-blooded.
Clean.
Methodical.
Thorough.
A killer, when
he picked up the ZF1, would've immediately
asked about the little red button on the bottom of
the gun.
OUTSIDE ZORG'S
WAREHOUSE - DAY
Behind Zorg, an ear-shattering explosion levels the warehouse.
ZORG
(impassive)
Bring the priest.

...The dark planet. Three warships are positioned in front of it.
Communication satellites arrive from all over the place, drawn to it like
a magnet.
CAPTAIN
(observing)
It's gobbling up all the communication
satellites in the galaxy!
LANDING
STRIP
TWO GROUND CREW MEMBERS stick an enormous, highly phosphorescant tube
into the opening.
GROUND CREW MEMBER
You're fueled and ready to go.
Have a nice flight.
LANDING
STRIP
The runway is now empty. A man slips out of the shadows. It's Cornelius.
He scurries over to the front landing gear. He pauses for an instant, the
climbs up the wheel well and disappears inside the shuttle.
LANDING
STRIP
On the ground, protective fire curtains rise slowly to contain the engine
exhaust on liftoff.
OUTERSPACE - NIGHT
The spaceship rockets past us, then suddenly vanishes with amazing speed.
Space is now empty and calm.
Billions of stars glow in perfect silence.
SPACE
The nefarious planet in still there, immobile, even larger now, writhing
like a serpent.
Then, suddenly, for no apparent reason, all activity stops
and it becomes gray and cold.
FHLOSTON
PARADISE
The space shuttle fills the screen.
It banks left and begins its descent
toward Fhloston, the turquoise planet.
Crystal blue water, perfect white sand
beaches.
A true paradise.
FHLOSTON
PARADISE
The spaceship descends through some clouds and glides over a vast
turquoise sea.
Fhloston Paradise looms into view.
An enormous oceanliner
floating a dozen yards above the water.
On closer inspection it is more
modern than a traditional oceanliner.
The shuttle draws near, looking
ridiculously small next to the monster.
Like a sardine next to a whale.
FHLOSTON
The tiny space shuttle clings to the huge oceanliner.

Zorg's ZFX200 speeds away from the boat.
Zorg is at the controls, a
devilish smile on his lips.

You want something done, do it yourself!

The ZFX 200 speeds back toward Fhloston Paradise.
FHLOSTON

The lifeboats launch from the hotel and fly out into space.

The ZFX200 jets away as the enormous oceanliner explodes behind it.
PLANET
FHLOSTON
A magnetic sarcophagus crosses the Fhloston sky and crashes into a
glacier.
FHLOSTON
Zorg appears in the middle of the ice.
He takes a portable phone out of
the ZF1.
ZORG
How's that? Can you hear me better
now?
SECRETARY (O.S.)
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly!
So, how was the concert?
ZORG
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to
listen to music! Listen up instead of
running off at the mouth!
The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
SECRETARY (O.S.)
Yes, Sir!
ZORG
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately.
Someone stole mine.
SECRETARY (O.S.)
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to
the hotel.
ZORG
I'm not at the hotel!
ZORG
Hello?...
BEEPER (O.S.)
Battery dead.
Zorg is all alone, lost, in the middle of the glacier.
ZORG
(to himself)
Stay calm.... stay calm...
SPACE
A ball of fire, all-powerful Evil, speeds across the screen with three
Federal Army warships following along behind it as best they can.
SPACE
The ZFX200 shifts to the speed of light and vanishes in the star-studded
cosmos.
DESERT - DAWN
The ZFX200 is parked in the middle of the desert.
Korben walks ahead carrying Leeloo.
Cornelius has the four Stones with
him.
Barely awake, Loc Rhod stumbles along.
David appears at the door of the
chapel.
DAVID
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
CORNELIUS
Later, David! Later!
There's not a minute to lose!
The small group enters the chapel.
SPACE
Earth is in view.
The Dark Planet fills the screen and heads for the
blue planet.
SPACE
The Dark Planet closes in on Earth rapidly.
SPACE
A mass of fire fills the screen.
The Earth is only a thousand miles
away.
SPACE
The Dark Planet hurtles toward Earth.
A hundred miles before impact.
The African continent is visible.
No doubt about it:	The fireball is
heading right for Egypt.
SPACE
The pure beam, the Light of Life, has finished its work.
The Dark Planet
nothing more than a dead planet.
Strangely enough, it looks like the moon.
Everything is calm around it.
NEW YORK
Outside the lab we see the President through the window, holding the
phone away from his ear.
PAN slowly across Manhattan.
Credits Roll as TWO full rising silver moons ascend in the dark blue sky.
