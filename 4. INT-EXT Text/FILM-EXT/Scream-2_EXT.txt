An old preserved movie theatre. The kind only found in
a small town. Very picturesque. The marquee in front
reads:
"SNEAK PREVIEW TONIGHT
'STAB'
Rated R"
A line has formed around the block, GUYS and GIRLS -
mostly college age.
CLOSE on a girl, MAUREEN, no more than 18. A friendly
face with innocent eyes. She stands in line with her
boyfriend PHIL, same age. A handsome counterpart.
MAUREEN
I hate scary movies.
PHIL
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your
hand.
MAUREEN
If we hurry, we can still catch the
Sandra Bullock movie.
PHIL
We got free tickets.
He pulls her close, snuggling with her.
Maureen and Phil reach the box office, presenting their
tickets.
They pass through the front doors where an USHER stands
randomly handing out GHOST MASKS. A Hollywood variation
of a most familiar one. Phil takes one.
MAUREEN
What's that?
USHER
The studio sent them.
Sid steps outside of her dorm. The morning sun shines
down as Sid breathes in, taking in the day just as
FIFTY NEWS REPORTERS NOB HER.
REPORTER #2
Sidney, did you know the victims?
REPORTER #1
Do you feel responsible for the
murders?
SIDNEY
What murders?
Microphones are shoved in her face as Sidney is seiged
upon by journalists and TV cameras. She starts to
panic.
REPORTER #3
Do you think there will be more
murders?
Sidney is mortified. She pushes and shoves but there is
no escape. The questions come at her like lightning.
She sees a whole in the crowd and goes for it as a
REPORTER, a flashy woman - all hair and teeth, thick
sunglasses, moves in her way.
FLASHY REPORTER
Did you kill them last night, Sid?
Has it gotten to you? Have you
finally snapped?
Sidney's eyes flare. Her fist starts to clench when...
BAM! Someone beats her to it. A fist flies out from the
crowd, connecting with the flashy woman's face. She
drops. Sid spins around to find...
GALE WEATHERS
Standing, tight-fisted. Their eyes meet. A quick
moment. Sidney is happy to see her.
The onslaught continues. Cameras flash, reporters
shove. Gale moves in front of Sid, holding the crowd at
bay. The reporters begin to throw questions at Gale.
GALE
(to Sid)
Quick, get outta here.
SIDNEY
What's going on?
GALE
Just go. l'll find you later.
Sid wastes no time. She takes off, running around the
side of the building. She stops, takes a breath, but
the reporters are on her tail. She looks up to see a...
SMALL CAMPUS SECURITY VEHICLE
Appear, moving towards her. It slows down.
MAN'S VOICE
(from the vehicle)
Hop on, Sid.
Sid goes for it as two hands reach out to help her. One
smooth move and Sidney is in the arms of...
DEWEY RILEY
She looks at him. Her face a book of questions.
SIDNEY
What's going on, Dewey?
He smiles at her. A safe, warm smile. His face as cute
as ever.
DEWEY
It'll be alright.
CUT TO:
The security cart trots along, passing STUDENTS coming
and going. Dressed smartly in a campus security outfit,
Dewey maneuvers the cart across the campus grounds.
Sidney rides beside him, horrified as she listens to
him.
SIDNEY
Three hundred people watched?
Nobody did anything?
DEWEY
They thought it was a publicity
stunt.
SIDNEY
Oh my God. How could it happen?
DEWEY
They don't know. It was carefully
planned. Earlier in the day the
victims received anonymous passes
to the movie.
SIDNEY
It's a copycat killer I knew this
would happen. That fucking movie.
The cart comes to a stop in front of a building.
DEWEY
As of now, they don't see any
relation. But they're checking it
out. The state, Special Task Force,
FBI - they're all here. They'll
find the guy.
SIDNEY
Yeah, right.
DEWEY
Look, Sid, why don't you take off?
Disappear for a few days. I'll come
with you.
SIDNEY
No. I will not crawl under a rock.
This is a fucked-up world and
people kill people all the time.
I'll just get used to it.
Dewey steps down off the security cart and helps Sid
off.
DEWEY
Nothing will happen to you. I
promise.
Sid's tough demeanor is cracking. She takes a deep
breath.
DEWEY
That's why I'm here, right? We take
care of each other. C'mon, I'll
walk you to class.
He starts off, for the first time, a severe limp is
visible as his left leg drags behind him.
SIDNEY
You go, it's all stairs, I can take
it from here.
DEWEY
Don't worry...
SIDNEY
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with
mace, alarm whistle, keyring,
knife, a degree in defensive
combat...
DEWEY
Just in case...
SIDNEY
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be
okay. Go back to work and let me
get back to my quasi pseudo-happy
existence.
Sidney reaches up and gives her pseudo-brother a kiss,
then takes off for the building. Dewey watches until
she disappears inside, then limps back to his security
cart.
CUT TO:
A newsvan pulls up and parks next to a trough of other
newsvans and REPORTERS. Some are doing live remotes,
others ready themselves for the next onslaught.
Gale gets out of the newsvan, her cellular affixed to
her ear.
GALE
I don't know... no one's talking.
What's the studio's position? Never
happen. They'd be stupid to pull
the movie. With all this free press
- they're gonna have huge numbers
this weekend. It'll break box
office records. Of course I have
bumps.
Gale's CAMERAMAN can be seen behind her, in the van
fussing with equipment.
GALE (CONT'D)
I need two minutes at six o'clock.
I wanna do a piece on the slain
kids - no sympathy shit - let's
stick with the movie angle. I wanna
pull a clip from an old film...
Gale turns to her cameraman, snapping her fingers.
GALE (CONT'D)
Hey, what was the name of that
movie?
The guy looks up at her. It's RANDY. Two years older
but still the charming jokester.
RANDY
HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. MGN/UA.
1980. Tom Hanks' first film.
GALE (CONT'D)
(into phone)
HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. Yeah, find
it. Don't worry, I've got it
covered... I have a plan. Yeah,
I'll get it. Give it a rest - I
said I'll get it. Later.
She hangs up, turning to Randy.
GALE (CONT'D)
Pressure's on. You ready for this?
RANDY
I'm there, man. No worries. I got
ya covered. I'm so there. That's
why I'm here - because I'm there.
Randy holds up his camera - stoked.
CUT TO:
The place is a circus. The front steps of the student
center have been roped off to form a platform. A podium
and mike have been placed center.
CROWDS have gathered for the press conference that is
being held by the university. Reporters and cameras
have been roped off to the side. On stage, DEAN FISHER,
a sharp looking woman in her forties is talking to
spectators.
DEAN FISHER
(reading from a
prepared statement)
"... and we feel this unfortunate
isolated tragedy in no way reflects
upon our fine school and we should
trust that the authorities and FBI
are acting quickly to bring us
answers..."
Beside her stand uniformed COPS, the local SHERIFF, FBI
AGENTS. She continues on...
IN THE ROPED OFF NEWS SECTION
Gale walks through the crowd, listening to the Dean.
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Gale? Can I have a second?
Gale spins around to find DEBBIE SALT, the flashy
reporter who she decked earlier, standing in front of
her.
GALE
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
DEBBIE SALT
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer -
NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
GALE
Fair enough.
DEBBIE SALT
What are you doing here? I thought
you had retired from field
reporting?
The woman has immediately put Gale on the defensive.
TWO OTHER REPORTERS have taken notice. Suddenly,
CAMERAS are on Gale.
GALE
Well, you know I'm dear to the
subject matter.
DEBBIE SALT
And much richer as a result.
GALE
Do I know you? You look familiar.
DEBBIE SALT
I took your vulture seminar seminar
at Berkeley last year.
GALE
Good for you.
And in seconds the vultures are upon her as Gale
Weathers is beseiged by REPORTERS. The questions spew
forth. "Why are you here?" "Is this the work of a
copycat killer?" "Have you talked to Sidney?" etc.
GALE
(ever smooth)
Guys, you're missing the show.
And with that Gale wanders off into the crowd.
ON STAGE
The LOCAL SHERIFF, a smart looking guy in his 50's is
fielding questions.
SHERIFF
No, we have no evidence of a serial
killer. We think the killer acted
deliberately and not at random...
ON THE LAWN
Students and concerned faculty stand. Among them are
Sidney, Derek, Hallie and Mickey. Next to them stand
JOEL, 20's, black, sensible and friendly. A very
intelligent face.
DEREK
But what are they doing? He's
talking but he's not saying
anything.
JOEL
Sounds like they don't know
anything.
HALLIE
Do you think they'll cancel Hell
Week?
MICKEY
You're getting nailed - you're not
getting out of it.
From across the way, two gorgeous sorority type girls,
LOIS and MURPHY stand with their FRATERNITY JOCK
BOYFRIENDS. All looks and attitude. Their eyes are on
Sidney as they huddle in a conspiratory stance.
JOEL
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
SIDNEY
This has nothing to do with me,
Joel. There's an estimated 270
serial killers currently active in
the US at any given time. I can't
control that. Who's hungry?
HALLIE
I have rehearsal.
MICKEY
I have to watch rehearsal.
Hallie kicks him. Joel moves to Sid.
JOEL
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy.
Some of us have real majors. You
gonna be okay, Sid?
SIDNEY
You're not allowed to ask that.
JOEL
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
SIDNEY
Thanks, Joel.
Joel smiles, heading out as the two sorority girls,
Lois and Murphy saunter over.
LOIS
Hello, pledges. Enjoying
yourselves?
Instantly, Hallie stands at attention. Sidney joins
begrudgingly.
HALLIE
Yes, sister Lois. Very much so.
Thank you for asking.
MURPHY
Good. We need your help, pledges.
Are you familiar with the Deltas TP
fundraiser?
The pledges shake their heads. Suspicious. Lois
withdraws two rolls of toilet paper from her book bag
and passes them out.
LOIS (CONT'D)
In our efforts to raise money for
our favorite cause...
MURPHY
... this week's TKE kegger...
LOIS
Ne ask that you sell individual
squares of toilet paper for a mere
nickel a piece.
MURPHY
We've set you each at a five dollar
quota.
MICKEY
Come on, guys. Uncool.
MURPHY
Am I getting fraternity
interference, Mickey?
SIDNEY
It's okay. I can peddle toilet
paper.
DEREK
Sid, you don't have to.
Sidney takes her toilet paper.
SIDNEY
No special treatment. I can do
this. C'mon Hallie.
She throws him a comforting glance. She's okay with
this. She heads off with Hallie. Derek watches.
DEREK
How do you put up with this Greek
shit?
MICKEY
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it,
I'm into Hallie...
ACROSS THE WAY
Gale moves through the crowd as the
press conference/rally continues.
She runs dead smack into...
DEWEY
Their eyes meet. A long moment. The silence between
them is revealing.
GALE
Hello, Dwight.
DEWEY
Miss Weathers.
GALE
I've been trying to reach you but
you haven't returned...
DEWEY
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers,
excuse me.
He tips his hat curtly, then starts off. She stops him.
GALE
The name's Gale, remember'?
He turns on her. His eyes on fire.
DEWEY
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is
embedded clearly between my ears.
GALE
I see you read the book.
DEWEY
Yes, I do retain reading skills.
Shock.
GALE
And an explanation is, of course,
out of the question.
DEWEY
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the
room with his dim-witted Barney
Fifish presence." I think you've
explained yourself.
GALE
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
DEWEY
No, what you are is a money hungry,
fame- seeking liar and - forgive me
for saying - mediocre writer who
has a cold storage shed where her
heart should be.
This stings Gale.
GALE
You have every right to be upset.
DEWEY
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with
inexperience."
GALE
I never meant to imply...
DEWEY
How do you know my dim-witted
inexperience isn't merely a subtle
form of manipulation used to lower
people's expectations thereby
enhancing my ability to effectively
maneuver within any given
situation?
Gale is at a loss.
GALE
I'm sorry. I don't know what else
to say except I'm sorry.
DEWEY
No, I'm the one who's sorry. I
misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse
me, I have some oozing to do.
Dewey turns and limps away, leaving Gale staring after
him. Her face smashed fiat.
ON STAGE
The sheriff continues fielding questions from
reporters.
SHERIFF
No, there has been no evidence that
more than one killer is
responsible...
ACROSS THE WAY
Sidney and Hallie have split up. They move through the
crowd selling toilet paper. Several STUDENTS make their
purchase.
Sidney pockets her change, looks up to see Gale,
standing alone. She goes to her.
SIDNEY
Hello, Gale.
GALE
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
SIDNEY
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't
stop calling but other than that...
GALE
I'm sorry.
SIDNEY
Yeah, well... you are the
definition of mixed emotions. I
really should hate you... I see
your movie's getting good reviews.
GALE
It seems to be causing a stir.
What's with the toilet paper?
SIDNEY
It's hell week. I'm pledging the
Deltas.
GALE
It's good to see you involved.
SIDNEY
My morn was a Delta.
Beat. People have begun to notice the two of them
talking. Reporters and spectators have slowly circled
them. Gale looks around. She spots Randy, who appears
behind Sid, with his camera. Gale gives him the nod. He
throws the camera up, hits the light.
Sid spins around, surprised to see him.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Randy? What are you doing here?
But then she sees someone else, standing off to the
side. A man she recognizes immediately. He looks at;
her, his face sullen, broken. Sidney loses her breath.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Cotton...
He moves to her.
COTTON
Hello, Sidney.
Gale motions to Randy. He maneuvers, getting the two of
them in frame. A long moment, Sidney just stares at
him. Completely off guard. She looks to Randy who aims
the camera directly at her... filming her.
SIDNEY
What are you doing?
She turns back to Gale, staring holes through her,
realizing she's been set up. She looks back to Cotton.
She doesn't know what to say. She turns back to Gale.
Eyes aflame.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
You BITCH!
Sidney storms off, disappearing in the crowd. Cotton
turns to Gale. His face pained.
COTTON
This was a mistake. I shouldn't be
here.
He takes off, pushing through the crowd. Randy stops
filming.
RANDY
Can you say backfire?
GALE
Did you get it?
RANDY
Yeah, I got it.
Randy is clearly not happy about his part in this. It's
in his voice.
GALE
You need to check your conscience
at the door. We're not here to be
loved.
Randy's face reveals otherwise.
AT THE PODIUM
The sheriff continues.
SHERIFF
No, we don't anticipate another
murder but we are taking every
precaution possible...
CUT TO:
A small street that dead-ends in a cul de sac. Large
old homes populate it. Greek signs adorn the place.
Welcome to Sorority Row.
A wooden porch with a bulb glowing overhead. She stands
on the porch steps, looking back, through the open
door, into the house. The phone starts to CRACKLE.
GIRL ON PHONE
You're breaking up. Where are you?
CICI
Outside.
GIRL ON PHONE
That's smart.
Cici looks up and down the street. A YOUNG GUY walks
along the sidewalk.
CICI
(calling out to him)
Hey, you? HELLO? HELL0?
The guy wears a headset, his head bobbing to the beat.
He doesn't see her. Cici looks up the street to a
sorority house down the block. Lights burn from within.
People come and go.
CICI (CONT'D)
There's something going on at the
Delta Zeta's. I'm gonna walk down.
Cici moves further down the porch steps. The phone
begins to CRACK severely.
GIRL ON PHONE
(phone begins to go
out)
Don't do that. Hang up... call...
(static)
CICI
What? I can't hear you...
GIRL ON PHONE
(major static)
Hang up... call...
CICI
I'm losing you.
GIRL ON PHONE
... campus security... send
someone... check out... place...
CICI
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll
call you back.
Cici hangs up the phone. She hits the "TALK" button.
Nothing but static. She tries again. She can't get a
dial tone. She looks back to the front door. She
hesitates quickly, debating, then she moves back up the
porch steps.
She tries the phone again. It still won't connect. She
moves back to the front porch. It connects. Major
static. She dials 511.
VOICE
(major static)
Campus Security.
CICI
Hello, I'm calling from the Chi
Omega...
VOICE
(too much static)
I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Hello?
Cici eyes the open front door. She inches back to it.
CICA (CONT'D)
Can you hear me now?
VOICE
We... bad..connec... call back.
The phone goes dead.
CICI
Shit.
Cici redials. The same static.
VOICE
Hello?
CICI
I'm calling...
VOICE
I can't hear you.
Cici peers through the front door, into the house. It's
completely empty. Cici steps back inside the house. The
connection becomes much clearer.
CICI
I'm calling from the Chi Omega
house. Someone is harassing me.
Hello?
There's no one on the line.
CICI (CONT'D)
Shit!
SUDDENLY, A FIGURE APPEARS BEHIND HER. A HAND GRABS
HER.
Cici spins around, SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER.
GIRL'S VOICE
Did the phone ring?
Standing before her is DAWNIE, a young girl, sweet, pre-
occupied.
CICI
Jesus, you scared me. What are you
doing here?
DAWNIE
I live here.
CICI
I thought you were going to the
mixer?
DAWNIE
I had to change. Did anyone call?
CICI
Just some asshole trying to scare
me.
The front door remains wide open. The phone RINGS. Cici
stares at it in her hand. She doesn't answer it.
DAWNIE
Are you okay?
Cici nods, answering the phone. ROCK MUSIC BLARES from
the receiver.
CICI
Hello?
DRUNK GIRL
(from phone)
We need a ride. Taxi! Taxi!
CICI
Where are you?
DRUNK GIRL
(from phone)
We're at Grogs and need a ride to
Acid Rain.
DAWNIE
Who is it? Is it Tina?
CICI
They're at Grogs.
Dawnie grabs the phone, moving into the living room.
She moves to a mirror and fusses with her hair.
DAWNIE
Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm on my way.
Cici follows her back into the
living room.
CICI
I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
Dawnie hangs up the phone, turning to Cici.
DAWNIE
Take the next one. You should set
the alarm. There's a killer on the
loose.
Reflected through the mirror is the foyer. Neither see
as a SHROUDED FIGURE appears through the front door.
Dawnie turns back to the mirror just as the Figure
sweeps into the dark dining room and out of sight.
Dawnie starts back for the front door. The phone RINGS.
Dawnie grabs it.
DAWNIE (CONT'D)
Hello?
MAN'S VOICE
Is Cici there?
DAWNIE
Who's calling?
MAN'S VOICE
Ted?
Dawnie throws her the phone and races out the door.
DAWNIE (CONT'D)
It's your ill-concieved boyfriend.
Seeya later. Set the alarm.
She SLAMS the door shut behind her. A second later we
hear it lock. Dawnie brings the phone up to her ear.
CICI
Hello? Ted?
MAN'S VOICE
No, it's me.
Cici nearly collapses. She's starting to lose it.
CICI
WHAAAATT?
MAN'S VOICE
Don't forget to set the alarm.
Cici hangs up, throwing the phone across the room. She
moves back to the foyer where an alarm panel is
positioned in the wail. She hits a coupla digits and a
BEEP is heard as she activates the alarm.
She checks the door, making sure it's locked, then she
turns and moves into the...
DARK DINING ROOM
Cici finds the light switch. CLICK! The room is
illuminated. Two long dining tables run the length of
the room. It's empty. Void of the Figure.
Two doors down from Chi Omega. A big, old Gothic home
serves as the Delta Zeta sorority. MUSIC PLAYS from
inside. It sounds like a party.
The room is filled with fifteen to twenty people.
SORORITY GIRLS and FRAT BOYS who SCREAM and CHEER as
they watch four girls who sit on their knees, hands
behind their back, in front of a coffee table devouring
plates of macaroni and cheese topped with whipped
cream.
Sidney, Hallie, and two other girls, TERI and LUCE tear
into the macaroni with all their might. Gobbling it up,
making a mess of themselves. Mickey is next to Hallie,
coaching her on. On Sid as she finishes her plate.
A whistle BLOWS.
MURPHY (CONT'D)
Looks like we have a winner.
Sid sits up. Macaroni and whipped cream is all over her
face. She smiles the victor. Everyone APPLAUDS.
MURPHY (CONT'D)
Sidney gets to skip the next round
of Bulimia bingo.
Hallie, a face full of grime, eyes Sid.
HALLIE
You bitch.
They crack up. Someone passes her a towel. She stands
wiping her face, looking across the room as Derek
enters through the front door. She waves at, him. He
hurries over.
SIDNEY
Where have you been'? You missed my
shining moment. I won the macaroni
sundae binge.
DEREK
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
ON HALLIE AND MICKEY
Mickey is cleaning off Hallie's face.
MICKEY
I don't want you to choke or
anything but you're trailing. You
need to pick the pace up.
She swats him.
ON SID AND DEREK
Sid and Derek stand arm in arm watching the next round.
SIDNEY
(complete throw away)
Any news?
DEREK
About what?
SIDNEY
The forbidden subject.
He shakes his head.
Suddenly, a FRAT BOY pops into the room.
FRAT BOY
Yo, guys, outside. Something's up
at the Chi Omega. Police are
everywhere.
People begin to stand, moving to the windows and front
door. Sidney looks to Derek.
Everyone comes flying out of the front door and into
the yard as POLICE CARS WHIP BY. SIRENS BLARING.
ANGLE ON STREET
Two doors down sits the Chi Omega house crawling with
police, ambulances, reporters...
"Yo - let's check it out." "C'mon." The entire crowd
takes off in droves down the street. All except for...
SIDNEY AND DEREK
They stand on the porch, watching as the street becomes
a circus.
CLOSE ON SIDNEY'S FACE
She knows.
A large, fenced in yard. Lots of big oak trees. Sid
flies down the back porch and into the yard. She moves
across it, passed trees and shrubs. She spots a closed
fence door in the back of the yard. She looks behind
her to find...
NOTHING
She scans the yard, the Ghost Figure has completely
disappeared. She moves behind a big tree, hiding behind
it.
Sid stops, catches her breath, then peers from behind
the tree. The yard is completely empty. She goes for
the fence door, slowly moving around the tree.
BUMP! A noise in the darkness. She spins around, still
making her way around the tree, moving backwards,
walking right into a FIGURE. She SCREAMS, spinning
around, finding herself face to face with...
CICI'S BODY
Hanging, dangling, hung from the tree, her stomach a
ripped, bloody mess. Sidney SCREAMS IN UNFORGETTABLE
HORROR. She steps back, falling right into the arms
of...
DEWEY
She turns, SCREAMING.
DEWEY
It's okay. It's okay. It's just me.
He takes her into his arms, comforting her, as she
holds on for dear life.
The early sun casts light upon an otherwise dark and
joyless morning as the blood stained campus slowly
comes to life.
The local campus security office has been converted
into a media event. News trucks, cameras and REPORTERS
stand guard outside while inside...
Sid and Randy walk up the steps to the school library.
The ever helping guards behind them.
SIDNEY
I don't know. I don't think Cotton
did it. It's too predictable.
RANDY
If he's innocent he'll have an
alibi.
SIDNEY
I guess Gale's going to be pissed
she missed her exclusive.
RANDY
I'll relay it. You sure you don't
wanna go home?
SIDNEY
I have this button I press. See? It
insulates me.
She mimes an air lock valve.
RANDY
I gotta coupla of those buttons
myself.
There's something sad about this exchange. These two
people understand each other
SIDNEY
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
RANDY
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just
had that been there done that
feeling.
Sidney watches as Randy shoves off, disappearing across
campus. Sid turns to find Derek leaning against a pole.
DEREK
I had the four o'clock shift. You
weren't there. You had us worried.
Is everything okay?
SIDNEY
No, it's not.
DEREK
I don't really know what happened
in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you
don't trust me.
SIDNEY
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust
myself. I tend to make big
selection errors when it comes to
men.
DEREK
Then I'll make this easy for you. I
like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid.
But I'm gonna stay away. Until you
say otherwise.
A long moment. He looks at her, hoping she'll say
otherwise.
SIDNEY
I'm sorry, Derek.
Derek nods. So that's how it's going to be. He turns
and wanders off, not looking back once.
CUT TO:
The newsvan is parked at a curb. It sits out of the way
overlooking the student commons area. A grassy area
where students sit and conjugate.
Gale walks back and forth with the cellular attached to
her ear. Dewey sits leans against the van, watching
her. He still has a crush but hides it as best he can.
GALE
(on phone)
The interview's not going to
happen. 1 changed my mind. I've
harassed the girl enough. It's in
poor taste and a bad idea.
FROM THE PHONE
Your entire career is in poor
taste...
GALE
Gotta go, call me when you have
something nice to say.
Gale hangs up, she looks to Dewey. Smiles.
DEWEY
So what made you change your mind
about Sidney?
GALE
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
DEWEY
You're a hard one to figure out.
GALE
It's that complex yet shallow
quality. It's deliberate.
DEWEY
I think you're all an act.
GALE
And deep down I'm a good person?
Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
DEWEY
I know that.
GALE
Yeah?
DEWEY
I also know that you're an aging TV
reporter slash writer who, despite
huge tabloid success, has some self
worth issues regarding your
personal life which directly
effects your professional life in a
non-positive manner. A coupla
failed relationships with - I'm
guessing balding, older men - have
turned you into this bitch with a
cell phone. But I bet sometimes,
late at night, when you're all
alone a sadness seeps to the
surface and in a moment of clarity
you know that all you really want
is to be touched and held and
fondled.
Gale stares at him, stunned. A moment as the tension
swirls about them.
GALE
And where did you gain all of your
Gale Weather's insight?
Dewey approaches her. Gale has never been more taken
with him. They stand incredibly close.
DEWEY
After my spinal cord was damaged I
was laid up for over a year. A lot
can happen when you're on your
back.
They're nearly touching now. Just then, Randy
approaches.
RANDY
What'd I miss?
Gale backs away from Dewey, breathless. Her cellular
phone RINGS. She eyes Dewey, then hands it to Randy.
GALE
I'm not here.
Randy takes the phone.
RANDY
Hello?
MAN'S VOICE
Gale?
RANDY
She's not here right now.
MAN'S VOICE
But she's standing right next to
you.
Shit! Randy motions to Gale and Dewey. It's him. He
points around campus, mouthing "He's watching." Gale
grabs Dewey.
GALE
C'mon.
(to Randy)
Keep him talking.
Gale and Dewey race off, across the grassy area where
STUDENTS come and go.
ON RANDY
He holds the phone, scared, not knowing what to say?
RANDY
So... what's your favorite scary
movie? No response. Silence.
MAN'S VOICE
They'll never find me.
Randy eyes Dewey and Gale, they move through Students,
searching.
RANDY
What do you care? Let 'em have
their fun. So, what's up?
MAN'S VOICE
What's your favorite scary movie?
RANDY
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening.
What's yours? Wait, let me guess.
THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL
EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT
DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY?
Am I close?
MAN'S VOICE
Closer than you think.
ON DEWEY AND GALE
They move through passing STUDENTS.
GALE
He has to be nearby. He likes the
game.
Dewey is on the his walkie. "I need back-up." He has a
hard time keeping up with Gale. He hobbles along.
BACK ON RANDY
He goes on a tirade pacing back and forth.
RANDY
So what's your deal? Can we talk
openly for a second? How does one
become a serial killer? Huh? Are
you psychopathic or merely
psychotic? And what is the
distinguishing feature'? Were you
slapped around as a child? Is it
hereditary? Did your Mom take test
drugs? You know, have you tried
getting laid? It's done wonders for
my homicidal tendencies.
MAN'S VOICE
Do you want to die?
RANDY
Gee, let me think. "Do you want
to... " Is that the best you can
do? Some tired hand me down rehash?
Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a
book about you. No movie rights.
Nothing. I've been through this
before and much better I might add.
ON GALE AND DEWEY
Gale spots a YOUNG MAN, sitting with some other KIDS.
He's talking on a cellular phone. She races to him and
rips it from his hands. He leaps up ready to pounce on
her.
Dewey appears.
DEWEY
It's okay. C'mon, Gale.
BACK ON RANDY
Randy won't let up. He continues dissing.
RANDY
And if you're such a brilliant
smart killer - why copycat? Why not
be original? Where's the
innovation? Let's pioneer some new
ground. Make a statement. Go down
in history. Now you'll always be
the Woodsboro copycat killer.
That's lame. It's like a bad
sequel. And why Woodsboro? What
about Manson, Bundy, Son of Sam?
Why imitate two high school loser-
ass dickheads - 1 knew the guys.
Stu was a wussy ass wet rag and
Billy - jesus - what a rat-looking
homo-repressed, mama's boy.
Suddenly the newsvan door RIPS OPEN, a GHOST MASKED
FIGURE lunges out grabbing Randy by the neck. The move
is quick and precise. A hard yank and Randy is wrenched
back into the newsvan. The door SLAMS shut.
ON DEWEY AND GALE
As they run back to the newsvan. SIRENS are heard in
the distant. Gale races up to find Randy nowhere.
GALE
Randy? Randy? Where did he go?
Dewey circles the van as Gale moves to the sliding side
door. She tears it open as...
RANDY'S BODY FALLS OUT. Blood everywhere. His throat
slit.
Gale's SCREAM is heard all over campus.
CUT TO:
Yellow tape has been placed around the newsvan. People
have gathered as Randy's body is taken out on a
stretcher.
Captain Tyler and Sheriff Hartley share frustrated
faces.
SHERIFF
He's broken his pattern.
CAPTAIN TYLER
They've broken their pattern.
SHERIFF
You're sure about this two person
thing?
CAPTAIN TYLER
Broad daylight, a crowded movie
theatre. This is too much fun for
one person.
Different UNIFORMS whirl by.
SHERIFF
I would say we are now officially
baffled.
CAPTAIN TYLER
On national television.
Sheriff Hartley looks up as REPORTERS flock them,
surrounding them in questions.
CUT TO:
Day turns to night and college life comes to a deadly
stand still as everyone observes the imposed campus
restrictions.
The fraternity house sits dark and quiet. A YOUNG MAN
walks up the walk to the front door. He TAPS on it
three times and it quietly opens as he's ushered in.
INT SIGMA PHI HOUSE - NIGHT - SAME
The young man makes his way down a long hallway, down a
spiral staircase, through a thick basement door and
into...
A RAGING PARTY
Music peels paint as YOUNG COLLEGE STUDENTS rock to
deafening tunes. A row of kegs line one wall as a the
party gears up for a drunken night ahead.
Derek is seen with his video camera. He's filming Lois
and Murphy. They talk into the camera. Both tipsy
chatty.
LOIS
It's all about sisterhood.
Everybody thinks its about partying
and blowjobs but...
MURPHY
... we only promote safe rubbered
sex.
LOIS
... it's really about family and
tradition...
MURPHY
... harmonica style is okay.
LOIS
I just love being a sister.
Mickey approaches as Derek finishes up.
DEREK
Thanks, ladies.
They take off to the kegs.
MICKEY
Are they aware of your not so
positive portrayal of Greek life?
DEREK
Not one bit.
MICKEY
Where's Sid?
DEREK
She dumped me.
MICKEY
No way.
DEREK
Yeah.
MICKEY
You freakin?
Derek shrugs. He's clearly upset by it when from out of
nowhere, SEVERAL FRAT BOYS appear, picking Mickey up,
lifting him over their heads. Everyone starts CHEERING
and CLAPPING.
FRATERNITY JOCK
He lavaliered. He's dead.
They carry him around the room, CHANTING. The frat boys
abduct Mickey, taking him up the stairs and out sight.
Others lookie loo's follow. Derek grabs his camera and
bolts.
CUT TO:
SPLAT! Gobs of gooey food goes flying through the air
exploding perfectly all over...
MICKEY
Who stands buck naked, tied... chained to a tree in the
back yard. The yard is crowded with FRAT BOYS and
SORORITY GIRLS who delight in torching him. Mounds of
syrup, eggs, and other wet and slimy food is plunged
upon him.
FRATERNITY JOCK
Who do you love?
MICKEY
Hallie.
FRATERNITY JOCK
Did you say "My TKE brothers"?
MICKEY
No, I said Hallie.
More food and slime come barreling at him. A drunk Lois
and Murphy pull the police tape down from the previous
night's crime scene and begin to Mayflower him. The
crowd goes crazy.
Mickey is still tied to the tree. He's so completely
covered in hardened gook it looks like he's wearing
clothes. The last of the crowd has left. They've gone
back to the party. He stands shivering in the cold.
He checks the chain that holds him secure. It's
composed of several bike locks and steel twine. He's
not going anywhere.
BUMP! He hears a noise. He looks to the nearby shrubs
and beyond. Nothing. Just a noise of the night.
MICKEY
(whispering)
Come on, Hallie, baby...
CUT TO:
A squad car makes it's way down the quiet campus
street.
The car makes its way down the deserted street
IN THE BACKSEAT
Sidney is beyond frantic. She eyes the Ghost through
the gate. She turns and twists looking for an escape.
Through the window, she sees approaching headlights.
She SCREAMS through the closed window as a car passes
by.
Sidney takes notice as the car turns onto another
campus street. Big, stone school buildings line each
side of a thin, road.
She eyes the Ghost through the rearview window. The
white masks turns as hidden eyes bore through her. The
Ghost hits the gas, picking up speed.
Sidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her.
She rips it open, rustling through it frantically. She
pulls books, pencils, paper... Sid grabs a long, yellow
No.2 pencil. She grips it hard, looking to the metal
grate just behind the driver's seat. The Ghost's neck
is right up against it.
Sid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the
Ghost's head, ready to attack.
Without pause, Sid RAMS the pencil through the grate,
into the Ghost's neck. It lodges there as the Ghost
falls forward in pain, losing control of the wheel for
a moment.
The car jumps the curb and SLAMS against a building.
The Ghost yanks the wheel, over correcting. He tries to
bring it back to the road but doesn't see the lamp post
that stands directly in the car's path.
The Squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post,
SLAMMING into it, bringing the car to a CRASHING HALT,
lodging it agaisnt the building's stone exterior.
Smoke rises from a bashed engine as it emits a fatal
rumbling.
INSIDE THE CAR
All is still. In the backseat, Sidney rises from the
floorboards. She looks up to see the Ghost Masked
figure slumped over the steering wheel. Out.
Sid quickly pulls herself together, looking about,
sizing up her options. She tugs on the door handle. It
won't budge. She looks to the passenger's side of the
car. It's flush against the building.
Then she notices the metal grate. The edge has been
pried apart in the crash. Sidney reaches for it,
pulling on it, bending it backwards...
CREAK!
Sid tries to stifle the noise it makes, all the while
eyeing the Ghost who remains unconscious. She creates
an opening large enough for her to crawl through. She
lifts herself up and pulls herself through to the...
FRONT SEAT
Sid falls down into the seat, her eyes never leaving
the Ghost. She lay crumpled up against the smashed
passenger's door, the only sound is her own TERRIFIED
BREATHING. She watches the Ghost Masked Figure. His
body doesn't move. She contemplates her next move.
The only way out is through the driver's door.
After what seems an eternity, she slowly reaches over
with her foot and nudges the Ghost. No movement.
Nothing.
She slides across the seat towards the Ghost, moving to
his side. She reaches with her hand and pushes on the
Ghost's shoulder. His body moves, slumping back against
the back of the seat. It clears space for her to pass
through.
She sits up on her feet, facing the Ghost. With her
leg, she reaches over him, straddling him. She leans
against the steering wheel, her arm quickly reaching
for the door knob.
HONK!
Her back brushes against the horn. Sid TENSES, her face
a little more than a foot from the Ghost Mask. He
doesn't move. He's completely out cold. Sid pushes the
car door open and starts to slide completely over the
Ghost when she stops.
She looks to the Ghost.
CLOSE ON HER FACE
As she fights with a decision. Then, with a fierce
determination, Sid reaches for the Ghost Mask. She
finds the edge and begins to peels the Mask away
when...
THE GHOST COMES TO LIFE
Lunging forward. Sidney SCREAMS, leaping, falling out
the car door.
OUTSIDE THE CAR
BAM!
Sid hits the pavement hard. She lifts herself up when
her entire body is YANKED VIOLENTLY BACKWARDS.
The Ghost has hold of her foot, pulling her back into
the car. Sidney KICKS and WRITHES breaking free. She
hops to her feet as the Ghost emerges from the car.
Sidney SLAMS the car door shut. It catches the Ghost,
knocking him backwards.
Sid tears off, down the street, running, burning up the
pavement.
CUT TO:
The film school sits in the still darkness.
Sidney races down the deserted street. Not a soul in
sight. She reaches a corner, moves off the road and
passes through a series of trees and shrubs, coming out
onto...
The houses have long since gone to sleep. The Delta
Zeta House stares at Sidney. Lights burn from within.
Sid goes for it.
Sid makes her way up the front porch. She POUNDS on the
front door, SCREAMING her lungs out.
SIDNEY
SOMEBODYPLEASEOPENUPSOMEBODY!
Sid wastes no time, she moves along the wraparound
porch, beating at the windows. But nothing. Everybody
is off partying. Suddenly, Sid hears something. A
WHIMPERING. She turns to find Murphy and Lois, laying,
strewn across the end of the porch. Passed out.
Sid runs to them.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Oh God, help me. We have to call
the police.
Sid kneels over Murphy, shaking her. Murphy's eyes open
and she GIGGLES. The girl is completely wasted. She has
no comprehension skills at all.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Do you have keys? I need to get
inside.
Sid looks to Lois. She's in worse shape.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Shit!
Sid contemplates, not knowing what to do. She leaves
them, moving down off the porch and around to the back
of the house. She gets to the back door, tries it. It's
locked too.
Sidney checks out the yard. Off to the side, she spots
a big tree with a...
BODY, lying next to it in a heap on the ground She
moves toward it.
As Sid approaches she sees clearly that it's Mickey. He
lay on his side, curled, knees to chest, his arm still
chained to the tree.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Mickey? Mickey?
A look of dread creeps across her face. He lay there
very much dead.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Oh God, no, Mickey...
She kneels over his body just as it stirs, lifting up,
rising. Mickey's face comes into view, coated in dried
funk, his eyes wide.
MICKEY
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've
been here all night.
SIDNEY
Listen to me. We've got to get
help. The Killer's here.
MICKEY
What are you talking about?
SIDNEY
He's after me.
Mickey pulls on his chained arm.
MICKEY
Shit! You've got to cut me down,
Sid.
Sid inspects the chain. It's meant to hold.
SIDNEY
I'll be right back.
MICKEY
Where you going?
Sidney moves to the shed that's attached to the garage.
Leaning against the side are a row of garden tools. Sid
settles on a shovel.
Sid returns to Mickey who has risen to his feet. He's
pulling and twisting the bike chain that binds him.
SIDNEY
Watch out.
Sid lifts the shovel up and brings it down directly on
the lock. It bends somewhat but stays in tact.
MICKEY
Do it again.
CLANK! A noise behind them. They both spin around
peering into the night.
MICKEY (CONT'D)
What was that?
SIDNEY
Don't panic.
Sidney, determined, raises the shovel high and brings
it down with great force. It CRACKS the lock, loosening
it.
Mickey pulls on it. It won't quite give.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Watch out.
Sid raises the shovel again, unfaltering. She doesn't
see the Ghost Masked Figure that slides down from the
tree branch behind her. The Figure moves quickly and
gracefully, coming to a stance directly behind Sid.
Mickey looks up, just in time.
MICKEY
SIDNEYWATCHOUT!
Sid turns just as the Killer strikes. But Sid is ready.
Without thought, she swings the shovel at the Ghost,
catching his mid-section, sending him flying.
Mickey goes ballistic chained to the tree. He pulls,
twists, squirms... anything to free himself.
The Ghost rises, moving on Mickey. Sidney sees this.
SIDNEY
Hey.
Sidney distracts the Ghost. She takes off, the Ghost
following her. She moves around the tree, sprinting
across the yard, running smack into...
THE GHOST MASKED KILLER
But Sidney spins around as two Ghosts appear on each
side of her. She stands THUNDERSTRUCK as the two
Killers descend on her. She dives between the two but
they counter, keeping her surrounded.
Sid watches as one of the Ghosts withdraws his knife.
She turns to the other. His knife is already poised.
They close in on her, ready to strike.
She looks for an escape. There's not one. BAM!
Suddenly, Mickey appears, barreling into one of the
Ghosts. They go sprawling across the grass.
MICKEY
Run, Sid...
Sidney makes her break, she runs passed them, towards
the front of the yard.
Mickey leaps to his feat. The Killer right behind him.
He now finds himself in Sid's predicament. He doesn't
know where to run. The two Killer's close in on him.
Sidney gets to the corner of the house. She stops...
she doesn't want to leave Mickey. She turns back around
just in time to see...
Mickey sandwiched in between the two Ghosts. They're
knives strike at the same time. One through the
stomach, the other through the back. They withdraw
their knives. Mickey's body suspends, momentarily
hanging in the air. Then collapses to a heap on the
ground.
Both Ghosts turn to Sid at the same time. She takes off
running, along the side of the house, through a row of
shrub that take her to...
Sid is back on the campus street, running down the
middle of it.
She spots a car stopped at a red light half a block up.
KIDS are inside, rock music BLARES. Sid SCREAMS and
SCREAMS but they don't hear her. She runs, feet
pounding, toward them but the light turns green and the
car takes off. It's taillights fading in the night.
She turns finding herself alone in a parking lot. The
theatre sits in the distance. She spots someone
entering the theatre. It looks like Hallie.
SIDNEY
Hallie?
But Hallie doesn't hear her. Sid races forward.
CUT TO:
Gale races down the empty campus street. She eyes an
emergency phone that's attached to a street lamp. She
goes for it.
Gale rips the phone from its cradle, presses the CALL
button.
VOICE
(from phone)
What is your emergency please?
GALE
Someone's trying to kill me. I need
the police.
VOICE
Are you in danger now?
GALE
Yes, goddammit!
VOICE
Where is your attacker?
GALE
I don't know.
VOICE
Stay under the safety light. Help
is on its way.
GALE
The safety what? Fuck that!
Just then, Gale hears a NOISE. A door opening. She
looks up to see Sidney disappear through the side
theatre door.
GALE
SIDNEY!
But Sidney has already disappeared inside. Gale yells
into the phone.
GALE (CONT'D)
Fuckin' hurry.
Gale throws the phone down and tears off for Sidney.
Gale approaches the side theatre door. She pulls on it.
It's locked.
GALE
Shit.
She moves down along the theatre to another door.
CUT TO:
