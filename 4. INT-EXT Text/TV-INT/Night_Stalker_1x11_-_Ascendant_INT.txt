    In CUTS:  TABLOID MAGAZINES (the Daily Star) neatly arrayed.
      Waxy VEGETABLES and FRUIT, set in perfect stacks.  Warholian 
      rows of CANNED GOODS.  The geometry of modern consumerism.

                    watch are the kind in magazines. 

      TRACKING WITH LEWIS, as he wheels his shopping cart, stopping
    to pick out ice cream in the freezer section.  We RACK TO:

      Another customer, STEVEN TEAGUE, pushing his cart in the
      other direction. 

      Steven and Lewis don t notice each other, and it s OK if we 
      don t notice they bear a STRIKING RESEMBLANCE:  Steven s also 
      40s, balding, heavyset, and casually dressed.

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    But a silent truth remains... 

      ANGLE - THE CHECKOUT STAND

      Steven puts his few items on the conveyor, among them, an
      issue of the Daily Star.  The MANAGER rings him up, Steven
      standing idly by, glancing at... 

      A multi-colored DISPLAY of horoscope scrolls, rolled inside 
      little plastic tubes.  Steven studies the  Capricorn  tube,
      then tosses it on the conveyor, too.  An impulse buy.

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    That we are connected to the 
                    infinite.  And that we ignore that
                      connection... at our danger.

    The Manager s done scanning his items.  To Steven:




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  3.

                    Club card?

      Steven forgot.

                                  STEVEN
                    Ah, right...

      Steven digs in his wallet, SLIDES it through the card reader. 

      CLOSE - REGISTER SCREEN:  Below the list of items, a NUMBER
      appears: 60118934.  Steven s savings toted for belonging to
    the market s  club. 

    And now we feature GEORGE CAWLEY, late 30s, who s been 
      bagging Steven s items up to now.

    We may sense he has the distant manner of an abled autistic.
      A person who lives inside his own head, rarely touching or
      looking at other people.

    But now George looks from the register to Steven, thinking.

      While Steven swipes his CREDIT CARD:

                          (not looking up)
                    Paper.

    But George isn t bagging his items anymore.  He s staring in
      Steven s direction.  Something disturbing him.  Repeating:

                                  GEORGE
                    Plastic.

                                  STEVEN
                          (good natured)
                    No...  Paper.  Please.

      George still looks toward Steven.  The Manager taking notice.

                    Plastic.

      George has a deeply troubled look on his face.  The Manager
      hands Steven his receipt to sign, reaches for a paper bag
      himself. 

                                  MANAGER
                          (to Steven, apologetic)
                    He s a little... slow.

                                  GEORGE
                          (insistent)
                    Plastic...  Gray...  Whale.

      Steven looks uncomfortable.  Doesn t know what to say to this
      intense, but seemingly nonsensical, remark.  Then, repeating
      each word as a distinctly separate thought:

                                  GEORGE
                    Plastic.  Gray.  Whale.

    The Manager finishes bagging Steven s purchase, which he
      takes with some relief. 

                                  STEVEN
                    Thanks.

    But before he can go, George stops him.  Speaking with deep,
      heart-rending meaning.

                                  GEORGE
                    You re... going to... die.

      George GRIPS Steven s shirt.  The Manager steps forward,
      pulling George away, shushing him as if he were a dog.

                                  MANAGER
                    George!
                          (to Steven)
                    He doesn t mean it, sir.  He 
                    doesn t know what he s saying.

      Steven, disturbed nonetheless, swallows.  Tries to rally an
      understanding attitude.

                                  STEVEN
                    Right.

    He takes his bag, heading off.  The Manager s eyes scold
      George, who looks down, terribly worried.       NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  5.




      Kolchak, Reed and McManus enter to find George sitting at a
      table, filling out his time card. 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    George Cawley?

      George pointedly avoids eye contact.

                                  REED
                    I m Perri Reed, this is Carl 
                    Kolchak and Jain McManus.  We re

                                  GEORGE
                    Punch out.

                                  REED
                    Excuse me?

    He rises, taking his time card to a PUNCH CLOCK.  Ka-chunk. 
      Still without making eye contact:

                                  GEORGE
                    Punch out.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    We d like to ask you a few
                    questions, Mr. Cawley.

                                  GEORGE
                    OK.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    You told the victim last night,
                    Steven Teague, he was going to die.

      George looks up, as though reading something imprinted on the
    air above their heads.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  11.

      Kolchak exchanges a look with Reed and McManus.  This is odd.

                    How did you know he was going to

      Another beat.  It s become increasingly obvious to them what

      George goes to his locker, takes out a windbreaker.  Getting
      ready to leave.  Reed looks to Kolchak, who s obviously
      getting nowhere.  She decides to try another tack.

    As she approaches George s locker, she notices a PHOTOGRAPH,
      circa 1970, of a loving COUPLE.  It s clipped inside the
      locker.  She speaks kindly but without condescension.

                                  REED

                    Who are they?

      George looks down, thinking for a beat.  Then:

                    They re waiting.

    He says it with heartfelt simplicity, then tucks the photo
      inside his jacket.  Reed wonders at his meaning. 

                                  ERIK (O.S.)
                    Who are you?

      Kolchak, Reed and McManus turn to see ERIK CAWLEY, 30s.  
      Solidly built, Erik has a blue-collar toughness about him. A 
    man whose youth was spent burdened with responsibilities.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Carl Kolchak.  I m a reporter.  You

                    C mon, George.

      George slams his locker shut, obeying.

                    You heard what happened here last

      Erik lets the door close behind him and George before Kolchak
    can finish.  McManus looks to the others.

                    I saw that one coming.


      CHERYL PARKS, late 30s, paces as she walks, talking in a low,
      insistent whisper.  Her eyes locked on something o.s. 

                                  CHERYL
                    You made a mistake.

                          (through the phone)

                    You shouldn t be calling me.

      Lewis gets up, heading toward the kitchen.  Cheryl hurries to
      finish her call.

                    Yeah.

    He hangs up the phone, pockets it.

      Cheryl rings off as Lewis passes her on the way to the
      freezer, reaching for some of the ice cream he bought.

                    Yeah.

      Lewis takes the carton and a spoon.  His wife looking after
    him with concealed hatred, biting her lip:


      George enters, wearing the same windbreaker as before.  The 
      Manager, bundling cash at a register, spots him coming in.

                    George.  I didn t expect you to

                    I know when you work, George.  But

                    Right.  OK.  Go on.

      George heads off.  Cheryl enters, approaching.

    we last saw it (the yellow police tape now gone).

    He takes KEYS from a drawer.  A CLUB CARD dangles.

                    George! -- I m so sorry, Mrs.

                    What does he want?

      George isn t meeting her eyes, but his intensity grows.

    He grabs Cheryl s sleeve, speaking low.

                                  GEORGE
                    You re going to die.

      Cheryl stares at him, not so much freaked for herself, as
      disturbed by his behavior.

                    Stop it, George!  Let go!

      Tears are shining in George s eyes.  The Manager pulls George 
      away.  George REACTS to the Manager s touch.

                                  MANAGER

    She leaves.  The Manager shakes his head at George, who
      watches Cheryl go.  Off George, mouthing  red miller plastic

                    It makes you think, though, doesn t

                    I m just saying, none of us knows

                                  REED

                    That s because I m not sure what it 
                    means yet.  Or that number he 
                    repeated.

                                  REED
                    I don t think the number means

                    Why not?

      Reed hands Kolchak the copy of the receipt.

                    repeating.

      Kolchak thinks about this.  It doesn t make a lot of sense.

                                  KOLCHAK

                    There s a reason for everything.
                    We just need to find what it is.

    As Kolchak hits the  Send  button, we go:


    The Manager finishes helping a CUSTOMER at the kiosk, looking

                    doing inventory.  He was better 
                    than any computer.  He could just
                    look and see the number.

      A MAN who slides in beside her.  He s got a hard face, dull

                                  CHERYL
                    You need to fix it.

                                  GLOVED MAN
                    Then you need to pay me.

                                  CHERYL
                    Pay you?!

                                  CHERYL (CONT'D)
                    I already paid you.

                                  GLOVED MAN
                    One payment, one job.  You want 
                    another job, you pay me again.

                                  CHERYL
                    You didn t do the job!  That 
                      sonofabitch is still alive!

                                  GLOVED MAN
                    Not my problem.


      A final set of mitter curtains part.

                                  CHERYL
                    I can t live like this.  So, you re
                    gonna do what I paid you to do. 

    The Gloved Man stares at her.  Like he could give a shit.

                                  CHERYL 
                    Or maybe the cops will get an
                    anonymous tip.  Yeah, you heard me.

                    I got nothing to do with that dead
                    guy, and believe me, I got nothing
                    to lose.

    The Gloved Man sets his jaw, his look becoming hard.  And 
      dangerous.  Cheryl swallows, slowly realizing she may have
      said the wrong thing, as we INTERCUT:

                                  LEWIS
                    Red...?

      CLOSE - A PROMINENT RED LIGHT begins to WHIRL, indicating the

                                  LEWIS
                      Plastic...?

      CLOSE - The Gloved Man grabs a PLASTIC KNIFE, swinging it
      toward Cheryl s THROAT.

      OUTSIDE THE CAR - HER HEAD

    Is banged against the inside of the driver s window by the
      impact of the Gloved Man s blow, as - 

      Lewis shrugs.

                                  LEWIS
                    Sorry, Charlie.

      Cheryl s lifeless body slumps down out of view.  THE BLOW 
      DRYER BLASTS DOWN on the vehicle. The sound of the hot air, 
      tiny beads of water sheeting off the car hood:


      Kolchak approaches Reed s desk, where she s just hanging up* 
    the phone. * 

                                  KOLCHAK

                    How do you know? 

                                  REED 
                    That was Jain. Mrs. Parks was * 
                    found dead in a car wash. Driving 
                    her husband s car. 

      Kolchak sighs.  Disappointed they were unable to save Cheryl.* 
    Off this, we GO:

      McManus hands her another photo, showing -

                    The brand name of the wash 
                    equipment.

      McManus goes back to his computer station, sets to work on
      something.

                                  REED
                    I have to admit, it seems too 
                    incredible to be a coincidence.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    George knew both of these deaths
                    would happen, before they happened. 

                                  REED
                    How can we prove that?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    By going back to the first murder
                    in the supermarket parking lot. 

                                  REED
                    What about it?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I realized it after we went to 
                    Parks  house looking for his wife.

                                  MCMANUS
                          (at the monitor)
                    Hey Kolchak, I got it!

      They cross to McManus  computer monitors, seeing... DMV
      PHOTOS of both Steven Teague and Lewis Parks.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Notice something?

                                  REED
                    This is Cheryl Parks  husband and the
                    guy who was killed in the parking lot.
                    They look alike.

                                  MCMANUS
                    So what s the point?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I think our victim was in the wrong
                    place, at the wrong time. 

    We FLASH TO: Lewis passing Steven in the frozen-foods 
      section... realizing he s at the wrong car in the parking 
      lot... the plastic bag looping around his neck.

                                  REED
                    The authorities can t find a motive 
                    for killing this man because - 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    There isn t one.  He died because 
                    he was mistaken for someone else.

                                  MCMANUS
                    Whoever killed him must not have 
                    known his intended victim too well. 
                    To make a mistake like that.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    It s possible George might have
                    overheard someone was about to be 
                    killed. But how could he have known 
                    it would be the wrong man?

                                  REED
                    Unless...?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Unless he can see the future.  He s 
                    psychic.

    Off Reed, intrigued:


      Kolchak and Reed approach Detective Tan, selecting something
      from a vending machine.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Detective Tan.

    Tan looks up.

                    Mr. Kolchak... I read your story in
                    the Beacon this morning.  You come 
                    here to un- baffle  me?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    We think we may have insight into
                    these murders at the supermarket
                    and the car wash.

                                  TAN
                    Is that right?

                                  REED
                    We think the first victim was 
                    killed by mistake.  That the 
                    intended target was Lewis Parks,
                    the husband of the woman killed at 
                    the car wash.

      Tan s eyes narrow, studying the both of them.  He doesn t 
      seem surprised.  Only surprised, perhaps, that they know it.

                                  TAN
                    You re right.

                                  REED
                    We are?

                                  TAN
                    Turns out Mrs. Parks had taken out 
                    $10,000 from her ATM over the past
                    8 weeks. 

                                  REED
                    What for?

                                  TAN
                    We think she paid someone to kill
                    her husband, Lewis. 

                                  REED
                    Have you established motive?

                                  TAN
                    She signed a pre-nup.  If she 
                    divorced him, she d be left high
                    and dry. 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    So your suspect?  He s a hit man?

                    You want to find the killer, 
                    Detective?  Isn t it worth at least 
                    asking for his help?

    Off Tan, reluctant:

      Detective Tan stands over George, who sits at a small metal
      table, a  SIX-PACK  of MUG SHOTS set in front of him.

                                  TAN
                    This is real easy, George.  We re 
                    going to show you a bunch of

                    They may or may not have had
                    anything to do with these deaths.

                    Thank you for bringing in your
                    brother.

                                  ERIK
                    Yeah, sure.  I can tell you right
                    now, this is a lot of nothin .

                                  REED
                    Why do you say that?

                                  ERIK
                    My brother can t tell you what s
                    going to happen.  He can t tell you
                    much of anything, really. 

                                  REED
                    We believe he may have said some
                    pretty extraordinary things the
                    last couple days.

                                  ERIK
                    Random words.  He says  em all the
                    time.  Nobody ever tried to read
                    anything into  em, that s all.

    We INTERCUT: George, looking at the various photos with
      interest.  Then, without looking up:

                                  GEORGE
                    Turn the page.

    Tan turns the page, Kolchak watching through the mirror:

                                  REED
                    George lives with you?

                                  ERIK
                    Yeah.  Always has. 

                                  REED
                    It must be hard for you, taking
                    care of him.

                                  ERIK
                    That s not the hard part.  It s the 
                    not knowing.

                                  REED
                    Not knowing...?

                                  ERIK
                    Who he is.  Really.
                          (beat)
                    They say George feels emotion, but you
                    know he won t let anybody touch him?
                    I ve never even seen him smile.

      ANGLE - THE INTERROGATION ROOM

                                  GEORGE

    As Tan does, we go CLOSE ON THE SIX-PACK, featuring a
      familiar face.  A MUG SHOT of THE GLOVED MAN.  Kolchak 
      watches as George stares at the face, studying it:

      RESUME - ERIK AND REED

      Sitting in the hallway.

                                  REED
                    I think your brother s a pretty
                    remarkable person.  Whether he can 
                    see the future or not.

                                  ERIK
                    Yeah.  Still, I d like to believe 
                    you re right.  About George being
                    able to see things.

                                  REED
                    It would be an incredible gift.

                                  ERIK
                    It would be more than that.  It 
                    would mean there s a reason. A 
                    reason George was born this way.

      CLOSE - GEORGE

      Studying the face of the Gloved Man.  His eyes darting back
    and forth.  But whether there is a glimmer of recognition in
      those eyes, we can t say for sure.  SLIGHT TIME CUT TO:

      ANGLE - THE INTERROGATION ROOM

    The door is opened, Detective Tan stepping out.  Making way
    for George.  Reed and Erik look up, as Kolchak comes over
      from the observation room.

                                  TAN
                          (to Erik)
                    I appreciate your bringing him in,
                    Mr. Cawley.

                                  ERIK
                    No luck?

                                  TAN
                    Not this time.  But thank you.

      Just what Erik thought.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  36.

                    Yeah.  C mon, George.

      Erik leads George down the hall, Reed looking after them.
      Knowing the disappointment Erik must be feeling.  Tan turns 
    to Kolchak.

                                  TAN
                          (dry)
                    And thank you, Mr. Kolchak...
                    you ve been a big help.

    Tan goes off, Reed looking to Kolchak, chagrined.


                                  END OF ACT THREE    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  37.


                                        ACT FOUR


      Kolchak is at his desk, working, as Reed approaches.

                                  REED
                    You still think George is some kind
                    of psychic, don t you?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I don t know why George couldn t ID
                    those mug shots.  But his other 
                      predictions remain.

      Reed sits on his desk.

                                  REED
                    OK.  Here s the one thing that
                    doesn t make sense.

      Kolchak smiles.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    The  one  thing...?

      Reed smiles back.

                                  REED
                    The main thing.  If George can
                    predict the future -- can see
                    details about what s going to
                    happen next -- that means the
                    future already exists, right? I 
                    mean, how else could he see it?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I ve been asking myself the same
                    question. 

      Kolchak picks up a book from his desk.ALBERT EINSTEIN s 
      face on the cover.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    You ever read Einstein?

                                  REED
                          (smiles)
                    I m a little rusty.






                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  38.

18 CONTINUED: 18


                                  KOLCHAK
                    Me, too.  But Einstein said space
                    and time exist in a continuum, 
                    which means the future exists -- as 
                    does the present and the past -- on
                    a plane we can t perceive.

                                  REED
                    So that means everything that s
                    going to happen has already
                    happened...? 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    That s one of way saying it.

                                  REED
                    So then George s gift can t really
                    be used to change anything?
                    Because the future already exists? 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    In theory.  A little discouraging,
                    isn t it?

                                  REED
                    Yeah.

      Reed thinks a beat longer.  Then:

                                  REED
                    I guess we have to try to change
                    fate, anyway.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    And why is that?

                                  REED
                    Because trying s what makes us
                    human.

      Kolchak looks at Reed, struck by the profundity of this.
      Smiling.

                                  REED
                          (not sure why)
                    What?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Just appreciating you, that s all.

      Reed smiles back, a moment shared between them, then broken 
    by the RINGING of his phone.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  38A.

                    help us with our story.

    Off Reed, surprised by this:


      George s sister-in-law, MARLA CAWLEY, 30s, trudges up the 
      stairs, Kolchak and Reed behind.

                                  REED
                    We were surprised to get your call,
                    Mrs. Cawley.

                                  MARLA
                    Yeah, well, Erik said you all
                    thought Georgie might have a gift - 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    That s right.

                                  MARLA
                    If he does, then we want to do our 
                    part.  For science and all.

    She doesn t sound terribly convincing.


      George sits in a straight back chair, staring out the window.
      Marla enters behind him with Kolchak and Reed.

                                  MARLA
                    Georgie.  The reporters are here.

      George doesn t answer.  Marla looks apologetic.

                                  MARLA
                    He doesn t have much in the way of 
                    manners - 

                                  REED
                    We understand.

    The room is spartan.  A twin bed, a bookshelf lined with 
      loose-leaf binders, a small desk. ASTRONOMICAL CHARTS are 
      neatly taped above it.

                    He s got it all right there in his
                    head.

      Reed kneels down beside George.  She follows his gaze out the
      window.  He s looking up at the night sky.

                                  REED
                    George, I m Perri.  We met before

                    Right.  Punch out...

      Reed notices the faded picture of the couple from George s
      locker.  Propped up on a table beside him.

                                  REED
                    There s that picture again.

                    visiting their grandparents. 

                                  GEORGE
                    They re waiting.

    The way George says it -- blankly -- you can t tell what he s
      referring to.

                                  REED
                    George... you said that before.
                    What does it mean?

      George doesn t answer. 

                                  MARLA
                    Drive yourself crazy trying to make
                    sense of most of what he says. 

      Kolchak is staring at an astronomical chart on the wall.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    George is interested in astronomy?

                                  MARLA
                    Like I say, anything to do with
                    numbers.  He writes  em all down in 
                    his notebooks. 

      Kolchak removes a notebook from the bookshelf, FLIPS through
    it.  It s filled with MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS and PLANETARY 
      SYMBOLS. 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    George, would you mind if I
                    borrowed this?

                                  MARLA
                    He doesn t mind, Mr. Kolchak. You 
                    go right ahead.

    Off Kolchak and Reed, feeling increasingly uncomfortable
      about all this:    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  42.




      Marla leads Kolchak and Reed back downstairs, Kolchak holding
      George s notebook in hand.

                                  MARLA
                    Listen, I think you re onto
                    something with this prediction
                    stuff.  I do.  A few Sundays ago,
                    I m thinking to myself, I oughta
                    make pancakes.  Out of the blue, 
                    Georgie says  maple syrup.   And 
                    when I went to find the syrup, lo
                    and behold, we were out.  I had to 
                    make a trip to the store.

                                  KOLCHAK
                      Impressive...

                                  MARLA
                    Isn t it, though?

      Reaching the front door:

                                  MARLA
                    So when s the article going to
                    appear?

                                  REED
                    The article?

                                  MARLA
                    You re reporters.  You re going to
                    write an article about Georgie,
                    aren t you?  His gift?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I m not sure we are, Mrs. Cawley.
                    Not just yet.

                                  MARLA
                    Well, heaven sake, why not?

                                  REED
                    We need some more facts first.

                                  MARLA
                    Facts, huh...

    She looks disappointed, thinking about this.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  43.

21 CONTINUED: 21


                                  REED
                    Mrs. Cawley, does your husband know 
                    we re here?

                                  MARLA
                    Erik wouldn t approve.  But I 
                    figure we ve done and done for
                    Georgie, it s time he did for us.

                                  REED
                    I m not sure I follow, Mrs. Cawley.

                                  MARLA
                    If Georgie has the gift you say he
                    does, it s gotta be worth
                    something, right?  People might
                    come, pay to hear what he says.
                    About the lottery and such.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Thank you for your help, Mrs.
                    Cawley.

    But Marla seems less friendly now.  Troubled they aren t
      writing a story.  At their insistence upon  facts. 

                                  MARLA
                    Yeah.

    As Kolchak and Reed exit, we HOLD ON Marla, thinking.

22 OMITTED 22


      Reed approaches Kolchak, who s got REFERENCE BOOKS spread out 
    on the table, as well as George s notebook.

                                  REED
                    I just spoke with Detective Tan.
                    He says they ve identified a
                    suspect Mrs. Parks contacted.
                    Someone George couldn t identify.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I think I may know why not. 

                                  REED
                    Why?

      Kolchak stands, indicating the notebook.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  44.

23 CONTINUED: 23


                                  KOLCHAK
                    This notebook, it s full of numeric 
                      calculations.  The alignment and
                    orbit of the planets, the stars,
                    the moons --

                                  REED
                    Yeah, he had astronomical charts 
                    all over his room.  He studies the 
                    stars.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    That s how he s doing it.  He s not 
                    psychic at all.  I think he s 
                    reading these people s horoscopes.

                                  REED
                    Kolchak, I read my horoscope every
                    morning.  It s never that specific. 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    It might be if George was the one
                    writing it.  Astrologers are
                    interpreters -- they take raw
                    numerical data about the stars and 
                    translate it into predictions.
                    What if George, because of his
                    unique mind, is able to translate
                    it more accurately than anyone
                    else?

                                  REED
                    OK.  But how does he even know 
                    these people s birth dates?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    They d given that information when
                    they applied for their club cards.
                    When he remembered their club card 
                    number, he remembered their birth 
                    date.  When he remembered their 
                    birth date, he saw their future - 

      McManus enters, carrying a folded tabloid in his hand. 

                                  MCMANUS
                    Hey.  I got some bad news.

                                  REED
                    What?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  45.

23 CONTINUED: (2) 23


                                  MCMANUS
                    Your story about George telling the
                    future?  You got scooped.

      McManus sets down a copy of an Enquirer-type tabloid, the
      Daily Star, a picture of George splashed across the front
      page, along with the headline  THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH.  A 
      sub-head reads:  Sister-in-Law Confirms Bagger Foresaw Bloody
      Murders. 

    Off Kolchak, looking to Reed:


      George sits at his window, the PHOTO of his parents in hand. 
      O.S., the sound of Marla and Erik arguing downstairs (see
      POCKET DIALOGUE).  His eyes are vacant -- we can t tell what,
    if any, emotion he feels about all this.

      After a moment, the arguing stops and George s door is opened
    by Erik.  He s still upset from his fight with his wife, and
      holds a copy of the tabloid in his hand.

                                  ERIK
                    I m sorry about this, George.  Marla 
                    shouldn t have done it.  You re not 
                    some kind of circus act -- you re my
                    brother.  But money s tight, you
                    know, and I guess she thought... I 
                    don t know what she thought.  It 
                    doesn t matter.

    His back s to his brother, but we see George s eyes go in his
      direction.  Erik takes a seat beside him, setting down the
      tabloid.  He notices the photo George holds.

                                  ERIK
                    You remember the day they had that
                    picture taken? 

                                  GEORGE
                    July 27, 1970.  Saturday.

                                  ERIK
                    No, George.  That s my birthday.
                    This was for their anniversary. 

                                  GEORGE
                    They re waiting. 

      Erik regards his brother.  The mystery of him.  He has no 
      idea why he keeps saying that phrase, but offers a guess.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  46.

A24 CONTINUED: A24


                                  ERIK
                    I know you miss them.  I do, too.
                          (beat)
                    George, I want you to know you got
                    nothing to be afraid of.  I m 
                    always gonna be here for you, OK?
                    I ll always take care of you.  You 
                    know that, right?

      George lowers his head.  Erik raises a hand, wanting to touch
    his brother s shoulder.  But knowing he can t.  When, softly:

                                  GEORGE
                    Plastic... 

                                  ERIK
                    Plastic?  What s plastic, George?

                                  GEORGE
                    Plastic.  Plastic.  Dark. 
                    Baseball.

                                  ERIK
                    I m sorry I don t understand you,
                    buddy - 

                                  GEORGE
                    Plastic dark baseball.

      Erik stares at his brother, at a loss.  Wondering why he s
      saying this. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Plastic dark baseball. You re 
                    going to die.

      Then George rises, going to his desk, leaving Erik staring
      after him, feeling like he s been punched in the stomach.
    Not knowing what to make of this disturbing warning, as:

                                        ACT FIVE


      Reed and Kolchak sit, keeping a watchful eye on...

      THEIR POV: Across the street, the Cawley house.  A PORCH 
      LIGHT shines.

      RESUME - REED

      Checks the time on her WRISTWATCH.  She s anxious.

                                  REED
                    Here we are, waiting on pins and
                    needles.  When if you re right,
                    it s already decided, isn t it?
                          (off Kolchak s look)
                    What happens, who lives, who dies.
                    It s all written in the stars. 

      Kolchak gives her a little smile.


      A NIGHT LIGHT glows near George s bed.  He lies there, awake. 
    His mind can t rest, knowing his brother s fate. 

                                  GEORGE
                          (soft, to himself)
                    Dark, baseball, plastic - 


      George turns to look at his NIGHT LIGHT, moments before... IT
      GOES OUT.  From the darkness...

                                  GEORGE
                          (a whisper)
                    Dark.  Dark, baseball, plastic...

                                                                          INTERCUT:


    The room is DARK.  Marla sleeps, while beside her, Erik is
    too uneasy to close his eyes.  Perhaps our reporters got
      through to him, after all. 


      Kolchak stares off toward the house.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Was that porch light just on a
                    second ago?

      From HIS POV, we see it has indeed gone DARK.

                                  REED
                    Maybe it s on a timer?

      They exchange a look.  Neither believes that in their gut. 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Maybe... or maybe this is what
                    George meant when he said  dark. 

      Reed looks to Kolchak.  She s not going to risk it.  They
      exit the car, Reed dialing her cell as Kolchak goes to the
      trunk, GRABBING FLASHLIGHTS.

    As they hasten toward the front door of the Cawley house:


      Marla awakens to Reed s KNOCKING. 

                                  MARLA
                    Who is that?

    She sits up, tries a LAMP.  Nothing.  Blackness. 

                                  MARLA
                    The light s not working.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  54.

39 CONTINUED: 39


      Erik s face expresses his mounting concern.


    The Gloved Man pulls a long, sharp KNIFE from a KNIFE BLOCK.
    The O.S. sound of Reed s POUNDING, prompts him to move on.


      Erik gets out of bed.  Flips the LIGHT SWITCH. Nothing. 

                                  MARLA (CONT D)
                    Erik... 

                                  ERIK 
                    It s OK.  Answer the door.  I m 
                    gonna go check on George. 

    As Erik exits the room, we go: 

      CLOSE - A BASEBALL BAT 

      Beside his bed.  As he lifts it out of frame: 


      George stares at the ceiling.  Under his breath:

                                  GEORGE
                    Baseball.  Dark, baseball, plastic.
                    Plastic.


      CLOSE ON THE GLOVED MAN s ARTIFICIAL HAND.  Plastic. 

    As soon as Marla is downstairs and out of sight, the Gloved
    Man ascends the staircase.


      Marla opens the front door to find Reed and Kolchak.

                                  KOLCHAK
                          (urgent)
                    You need to get out of the house - 

                                  MARLA
                    What are you talking about?

                                  REED
                    We think you re in danger --



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  55.

44 CONTINUED: 44


                                  KOLCHAK
                    -- Your power s been cut - 


      Erik enters.  He motions to George to keep quiet.

                                  ERIK
                          (a whisper)
                    George, we re gonna play a game.
                    Hide and seek, OK?

                                  GEORGE
                    OK.

      Erik guides George into a CLOSET, the door of which is
      already OPEN.

                                  ERIK
                    You hide in here and I ll come find 
                    you.

                                  GEORGE
                    Dark.  Dark, baseball, plastic.

                                  ERIK
                    I know.  Now you go hide.  I ll 
                    start counting.  One... two... 
                    three...

      George closes his eyes and starts quietly continuing the 
      count.  Erik tightens his grip on the baseball bat, turning
    to the door, preparing to defend his brother s life, as
      George CLOSES the closet door.

      REVEAL THE GLOVED MAN.  He s already in the room, hiding.
    And now his sights are set on an unsuspecting Erik, his back
      turned to him.  As the Gloved Man grips the knife tightly:


                                  KOLCHAK
                    Where s your husband?

                                  MARLA
                    Upstairs, why?

    As Kolchak and Reed push past her:    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  56.




      Just behind Erik, the Gloved Man holds the knife aloft, 
      poised to strike, as - 

      George BURSTS from the closet, leaping onto the Gloved Man. 

      Erik turns at the fracas. 

                                  ERIK
                    George!

    He rushes forward with the bat. 

      ANGLE - THE DOOR TO GEORGE S ROOM

      Kolchak and Reed appear as --CRACK! Erik strikes the Gloved 
    Man hard with the bat, knocking him to the ground. 

    At the doorway, Reed and Marla are overwhelmed with relief,
    as Erik crosses to his brother, rousing him.

                                  ERIK
                    George.

                                  GEORGE
                    Erik.

                                  ERIK
                    It s OK, George.  You re OK.

      George rises stiffly, a strange look on his face. A smile.
      Erik looks confused, then shocked as... GEORGE EMBRACES HIM. 
      Erik stands there, too stunned to respond at first. 

      Reed and Kolchak moved, as Erik reciprocates his brother s
      embrace.  Putting his arms around him.  Swallowing back his
    own emotion. 

      Only now a look of horror and confusion spreads across his
      face.  He takes his hands away from George, seeing his
      fingers WET WITH BLOOD.

                                  ERIK
                    Oh my god.  No!

      Erik looks into George s eyes.  His brother s face is pale,
      drained of blood.  George collapses to the floor, revealing a
      BLOODY PATCH IN HIS BACK.  Only now realizing... he s been 
      stabbed.

      Erik falls to his knees, overcome with emotion.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  57.

47 CONTINUED: 47


                                  ERIK
                    No, God!  No...

    He holds his brother, but he s dying fast.  There s nothing
      anyone can do to change it.  We hear the sound of DISTANT 
      SIRENS, growing louder:


      HARD CUTS of George s possessions: his grocery store NAME
      TAG... his NOTEBOOK, opened to thousands of NUMERICAL
      NOTATIONS... and the PHOTO of his parents.  No longer waiting.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    TBW.

                                  POCKET DIALOGUE

      SCENE A24

                                  ERIK
                    You had no right, Marla.

                                  MARLA
                    Did you even see the check?  It s 
                    enough for three car payments.

                                  ERIK
                    I don t want their money.  They re
                    making a joke out of George.

                                  MARLA
                    We ve had the burden of your
                    brother our entire married life. 
                    It s time we get something back.

                                  ERIK
                    Not by selling a bunch of malarkey
                    to a magazine.
