        A father-and-son tennis game is going on under mercury vapor 
      lights on a sticky June night.

      DAVID MYERS (lanky, 19) plays with dad SAM, (potbelly, 49).  
      Sam is huffing and puffing, David barely breaking a sweat.

      Pok-pok...

                                  DAVID
                    What s the big deal? I still 
                    passed. 

                                  SAM
                    Barely.

                                  DAVID
                    A  C  isn t barely passing. That s 
                    a  D.  A  C  is  satisfactory. 

                                  SAM
                    A  C  is a Jewish  F. 

                                  DAVID
                    Dad...

                                  SAM
                    I m not trying to be a ballbuster. 
                    I m just trying to understand how 
                    you can get an  A  in... What was 
                    it again?

                                  DAVID
                    Cinema of the French New Wave.

                                  SAM
                    An  A  in French Cinema, but a  C  
                    in your major?

                                  DAVID
                    It s not my major yet.

                                  SAM
                    And that s what I m worried about. 
                    How s it going to look this fall 
                    when you apply to the CPA program 
                    and they see you just squeaked by 
                    Intro Accounting?                                                                                      2.


      David makes a half-hearted attempt to return his dad s shot 
      and the ball whizzes past.

                                  DAVID
                          (glum)
                    Like I don t belong there...

      Sam comes around the net and puts a hand on David s shoulder.

                                  SAM
                    Look. I get it. I was your age 
                    once. The first couple of years at 
                    college are about having fun... 
                    Going to keggers. Smoking a little 
                    reefer. Figuring things out. But 
                    there comes a time when you have to 
                    knuckle down. Get serious about 
                    your future.

                                  DAVID
                    I know.

                                  SAM
                    This summer job is a terrific 
                    start. You ll network. Make a lot 
                    of new contacts. Meet some very 
                    wealthy people who will remember 
                    you down the road... when they need 
                    someone to do their taxes.

      A fatherly smile.  Utterly clueless.  David looks miserable.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    Now how about one more game before 
                    the mosquitoes get too bad?

                                  DAVID
                            (unenthusiastic)
                    You serve.

      Sam grins and starts jogging back to his side of the net.  
      David broods as he returns to his own baseline and gets into 
      position, limbering up, etc.  

      When he glances up he notices his dad just standing at the 
      far end of the tennis court with a funny look on his face.

                                  DAVID (CONT D)
                          (calling)
                    You going to serve or what? 

      Sam acts like he didn t hear him.                                                                                      3.


                                  DAVID (CONT D)
                    Dad? What s wrong?

                                  SAM
                          (in a fog)
                    Not sure... all of a sudden I... 

      His racquet drops from his hand and clatters to the ground.  
      He grabs his shoulder, grimacing in pain, white as a sheet.

      His knees start to buckle.

                                  DAVID
                    Dad!

      He races across the court, vaults the net, and catches Sam 
      just as he s collapsing... easing him down onto his back.  
      Sam looks up at his son with a mix of confusion and pain. 

                                  SAM
                    My chest... feels like...

                                  DAVID
                    Oh god. Oh shit. 

      He casts around frantically for help and sees a group of 
      SKATEBOARDERS goofing off just outside the cyclone fence.

                                  DAVID (CONT D)
                          (hollering)
                    CALL 9-1-1!

                                  SKATEBOARDER
                    Huh?

                                  DAVID
                    HE S HAVING A FUCKING HEART ATTACK! 

      Two of the skateboarders sprint off to find pay phone.  David 
      cradles his dad s head in his lap as Sam looks up at him and 
      struggles to speak.

                                  SAM
                    ... David... son... I m sorry... 
                    need you to know... how much I love 
                    you... How proud...

                                  DAVID
                    Jesus Christ! What are you doing? 
                    Don t say that! Okay? Just shut up! 
                    You are NOT allowed to do this!                                                                                      4.


                                  SAM
                    ... promise me... won t make...  
                    mistakes we did... 

                                  DAVID
                    Who?

                                  SAM
                    ... your mother and I... never 
                    loved each other... would have 
                    split years ago... if you hadn t 
                    come along...

                                  DAVID
                    What?!

                                  SAM
                    ... Should ve married Soon-hi... 

                                  DAVID
                    Who s Soon-hi?

                                  SAM
                    ... girl I knew in Korea... such 
                    beautiful eyes... always loved 
                      Orientals...

                                  DAVID
                    Okay.

                                  SAM
                    ... also... I m pretty sure your 
                    mother is a lesbian... or I guess 
                      technically  bisexual ...

                                  DAVID
                    Maybe you shouldn t try to talk.

      As he cradles his father...

      SLOWLY CRANE UP from the tennis courts as if rising with a 
      departing spirit casting off this mortal coil, until we are 
      gazing out over the rooftops and street lights of suburbia, 
      sultry on this humid night, sounds of cicadas and distant 
      SIRENS growing faint as all worldly concerns slip away... 

                                  VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                    Good news, folks...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                      5.



      MUSIC:  Robbie Dupree s  Steal Away  PLAYS over a MONTAGE.

      A new day dawns on the pampered links of a private golf and 
      tennis club in north Jersey, just across the G.W. Bridge from 
      Manhattan.

      Deer graze on the back nine.  Sprinklers water lush greens. 
      The staff (many of whom we ll meet by name soon) prepare for 
      the first day of the summer season. Maintenance men trim 
      hedges and touch-up paint the  Red Oaks Country Club  sign. 
      By the pool a male and female lifeguard, (clearly a couple) 
      slather each other in suntan lotion.                                                                                       6.


      In the empty parking lot two valets get high.  In an exercise 
      studio the aerobics instructor chooses mix tapes. In the 
      women s lounge a masseuse wipes down her pleather massage 
      table. In the clubhouse dining hall waitresses fold linen 
      napkins and fill salt shakers. (etc.)

                                                                  MUSIC & MONTAGE 
                                                                          ENDS ON:



      David watches while his boss, head tennis pro NASSER ( Nash,  
      East Indian, late 30 s) sets up a tennis ball machine.

                                  NASH
                    Base salary s three hundred a week. 
                    But of course the serious gelt is 
                    in private lessons. Your fee is $50 
                    an hour, which you split sixty-
                    forty with me.

                                  DAVID
                    Am I sixty or forty?

      Nash peers over the top of his Ray-Bans:   What do you 
      think? 

                                  NASH
                    If you hustle you can pocket nine 
                    bills a week... How s that compare 
                    to Video City?

                                  DAVID
                    Not bad...

                                  NASH
                    Damn right it s  not bad. 

                                  DAVID
                    Though I will miss the free porn.

                                  NASH
                    We ve got our perks too.

                                  DAVID
                    Like?

                                  NASH
                    We eat for free. Whatever you want. 
                    King crab, New York strip, chef s 
                    salad... Just sign for it.                                                                                      7.


                                  DAVID
                    They serve New York strip in the 
                    staff cafeteria?

                                  NASH
                    The fuck do I know? I m not staff.

                                  DAVID
                    You re not?

                                  NASH
                    Neither are you. We re tennis pros. 
                    We eat in the dining hall with the 
                    members. We shower in their locker 
                    room, take a steam in their saunas 
                    and a shit in their bathrooms. Only 
                      difference between them and us is 
                    we don t get to schtup their wives, 
                    even if they want us to and believe 
                    me boychik there will be some who 
                    will want you to... 

      He breaks off and beams at an over-tanned JERSEY WIFE in a 
      short tennis dress.

                                  NASH (CONT D)
                    Good morning, Mrs. Shapiro! Go 
                    ahead and warm up. I ll be right 
                    with you...

      After she s out of earshot he says to David, deadly serious:

                                  NASH (CONT D)
                    Case in point. I could hit that. 
                    But I don t. And do you know why?

                                  DAVID
                    Because you re married?

                                  NASH
                    Because of who she might be married 
                    to. You never know. Could be some 
                    schmuck makes a living doing knee 
                      replacements. Or busting kneecaps. 
                    Capice?

      David nods.

                                  NASH (CONT D)
                    Good...
                          (RE: tennis ball machine)
                    Take over for me. And don t forget 
                    you ve got a kids clinic starting 
                    in ten minutes.                                                                                       8.


      Nash hurries off to attend to Mrs. Shapiro.  David smiles and 
      kneels by the tennis ball machine.



      Head valet WHEELER (20, husky) is having a heated discussion 
      with his fellow VALETS.

                                    WHEELER
                    Boba Fett?!

                                  VALET
                    He s a badass.

                                    WHEELER
                    He wears cargo pants for chrissake! 
                    You want a badass? Try Scaramanga.

                                  VALET
                    Who?

                                    WHEELER
                    The Man With the Golden Gun, you 
                    fucking philistine...

      A FERRARI pulls up and Wheeler hurries to greet the driver.

                                    WHEELER (CONT D)
                    Welcome back, Judge Ferraro! 

      The JUDGE palms him a tip.

                                  JUDGE
                    Park it somewhere safe.

                                    WHEELER
                    Yes sir!

      Wheeler climbs inside...



      As the afternoon sun gets lower we begin a MONTAGE of match 
      between David and Getty.  David barely breaks a sweat as he 
      runs Getty around the court.  Getty gets increasingly pissed.  
      Worried, David starts letting Getty win a few points, and 
      even a game or two... but when David glances at his watch and 
      notices the hour is almost over he turns on the heat, scoring 
      point after point against a red-faced Getty.  

      Finally:

                                  DAVID
                    Match point Mr. Getty.

      He serves the ball, Getty returns, and they volley for a bit, 
      until finally David slams a crosscourt shot past Getty to end 
      the match.

                                  GETTY
                    Fuck.

      Instead of a tantrum, Getty just grabs his things and walks 
      off the court without a word or a glance in David s 
      direction. 

      Leaving David standing there wondering what just happened.



      Families arrive for visiting hour.



      The summer kickoff kegger is in full-swing on the back nine.

      The entire staff mingles on the moonlit greens, drinking from 
      plastic cups, passing joints, joy riding in golf carts.  
      MUSIC from someone s boombox floats on the humid night air, 
      mixing with the rasp of CICADAS and DRUNKEN LAUGHTER.



      Nash is playing  strip golf  with TWO GIRLS (mid 20s).  He s 
      down to his boxers and socks, and the girls are in bras and 
      panties.

      David strolls over.                                                                                    17.


                                  NASH
                    Boychick! When did you get here?

                                  DAVID
                    Just now.

                                  NASH
                    Flying solo?

                                  DAVID
                    Karen went to say hi to some 
                      friends...
                          (then)
                    Where s your wife?

      Nash looks at him, deadpans:

                                  NASH
                    Picking up the dry cleaning.

                                  GIRL #1
                    Hi. I m Dawn.

                                  NASH
                    Dawn is a massage therapist here, 
                    and Kimberly waitresses in the 
                    Grill.

                                  DAVID
                          (to Kimberly)
                    I thought you looked familiar.

                                  GIRL #1 (DAWN)
                    Want to play?

                                  DAVID
                    Too many mosquitos.

                                  NASH
                    No kidding...
                          (slaps at mosquito)
                    Little fuckers love me.

                                  GIRL #2 (KIMBERLY)
                          (seductive)
                    What do you taste like, Nash?

                                  NASH
                    Tikka masala and scotch.

      He lines up his shot, sinks his putt.  Looks up to give David 
      a wink and sees him leaving.                                                                                    18.


                                  NASH (CONT D)
                    Where are you going?

                                  DAVID
                    To get a beer. 

                                  NASH
                    Don t go far. We need to talk.   

                                  DAVID
                    About what?

                                  NASH
                    Work stuff...

      Just then the girls unhook their bras and suddenly whatever 
      it is becomes less urgent.

                                  NASH (CONT D)
                    It can wait. I ll come find you.

      David laughs as he walks away.



      A group of STONERS (valets, busboys, etc.) hang out under a 
      tree on the 14th hole by the kegs.

      Wheeler holds court.  He s wearing his valet vest over a Pink 
      Floyd t-shirt.  He takes a hit from a bong and resumes 
      speaking animatedly.

                                    WHEELER
                    ...You wanna know what s wrong with 
                    the world?  I ll tell you. One 
                    word: Plastic.

                                  STONER #1
                    Plastic?

                                    WHEELER
                    It s ruining porn. The country too. 
                      Everything s turning plastic. Tits. 
                    Money...

                                  STONER #2
                    I like fake tits.

                                    WHEELER
                    Because Dow Chemical wants you to. 
                    The same way Gillette wants you to 
                    like a tidy bush.                                                                                     19.


                                  STONER #1
                    What s wrong with a tidy bush?

                                    WHEELER
                    It s unnatural. Women aren t action 
                    figures. They re mammals. With fur. 
                    Big bushes are sexy. The bigger the 
                    better...

                                  STONER #2
                    Like a badger?

                                    WHEELER
                    In a Russian hat.

      The stoners laughter dies as they see someone approaching:  
      STEVE LEFEVRE (tank top and Jams, 20 s), the head lifeguard.  
      The stoners fall quiet in the presence of an Alpha male.

                                    LEFEVRE
                    Which one of you is Wheeler?

                                    WHEELER
                    The one you went to high school 
                    with...

                                    LEFEVRE
                    Huh?

                                    WHEELER
                    And junior high. Also our moms are 
                    best friends.

      Zero recognition.  LeFevre cuts to the chase.

                                    LEFEVRE
                    I hear you got weed.

                                    WHEELER
                      Depends... How much you need?

                                    LEFEVRE
                    Just a dime.

                                    WHEELER
                    I think I can help you out... 

      He digs in his pocket and produces a $10 baggie of pot.

                                    LEFEVRE
                          (inspects it; scowling)
                    This shit better not be all stems 
                    and seeds.                                                                                     20.


      Wheeler is stoned, but even if he wasn t, he could never be 
      on this guy s wavelength.

                                    WHEELER
                    (as LeFevre forks over the money)
                    How s Misty?

                                    LEFEVRE
                    Not my fucking problem any more.

      Wheeler is rocked by this, but tries to act nonchalant.

                                    WHEELER
                    You two broke up? Wow. I m sorry.

                                    LEFEVRE
                          (surly)
                    I m not.

      He collects his change, splits.  

                                  STONER #1
                    What a joystick.

                                  STONER #2
                    Yeah, why d you even sell him any, 
                    Wheeler?

      But Wheeler doesn t respond, still processing the huge news 
      of the Misty-LeFevre breakup.



      David goes in search of Karen, two plastic beer cups in hand.  
      He scans the moonlit fairway and spots her talking to a guy 
      in a Hawaiian shirt:  BARRY (Tom Sellick  stache, 28). 

      They look up as David arrives.

                                  KAREN
                    There you are!
                          (to Barry)
                    Barry, this is my boyfriend, David.

                                  BARRY
                    Hey.

      He barely acknowledges David, his eyes fixated on Karen. 

                                  KAREN
                    Barry s a freelance photographer. 
                    He shoots all the weddings and bar 
                    mitzvahs here.                                                                                    21.


                                  BARRY
                          (blas )
                    Obviously it s not why I went to 
                    art school. I m a photojournalist 
                    by training. But it pays my condo 
                    fees, know what I m saying? And 
                    gives me the freedom to pursue my 
                    real passion.

                                  DAVID
                      Spelunking?

      Barry shoots him a  Fuck you  look.

                                  BARRY
                    Fashion photography... 
                          (smiles at Karen)
                    Matter of fact I was just trying to 
                    convince your lady here to pose for 
                    me sometime.

                                  DAVID
                    Any luck?

                                  KAREN
                    No!

                                  BARRY
                    Give me one reason why not?

                                  KAREN
                    I ll give you two...

      She cups her small breasts.

                                  KAREN (CONT D)
                    Have you seen Kathy Ireland s boobs 
                    lately?

                                  BARRY
                    Kathy doesn t have your eyes.

      Is this guy for real?  David looks pissed.  But Karen seems 
      to be buying it.  

                                  BARRY (CONT D)
                    Think about it, sweetheart... 

      He looks at David.

                                  BARRY (CONT D)
                    Nice meeting you, Dan.                                                                                    22.


                                  DAVID
                    David.

                                  BARRY
                    Right.

      He gives Karen a final eye-grope before sauntering away.

                                  KAREN
                      Spelunking?

                                  DAVID
                    That guy is so full of shit.

                                  KAREN
                    You don t think I m pretty enough 
                    to model?

                                  DAVID
                    Stupid enough to by that line.

                                  KAREN
                    Barry s just a friend.

                                  DAVID
                    ...Who wants you to wear his balls 
                    like an eyemask.

                                  KAREN
                    You pervert.

      She gets a frisky look.

                                  KAREN (CONT D)
                    I ve never seen you jealous before. 

      And it s turning her on.  She kisses him.  Getting him hot.  
      She reaches to brush a hand against the front of his jeans.

                                  KAREN (CONT D)
                          (naughty smile)
                    I see someone brought his putter.

                                  DAVID
                      Nine-wood...

                                  KAREN
                          (teasing)
                    Try six.

      He gooses her and she yelps.                                                                                     23.


                                  KAREN (CONT D)
                          (seductive)
                    Feel like playing a round?

      She takes off her shirt and pulls him down on the soft grass.



      Lifeguard MISTY (Farrah hair, 20) sits alone in a GOLF CART 
      nursing a beer and a broken heart, the sounds of the party 
      quiet in the distance.

                                    WHEELER (O.S.)
                    Hey.

      She startles... Sees Wheeler... Doesn t recognize him.

                    Nice night, huh? 

                                  MISTY
                    No offense but I kinda want to be 
                    alone.

                                    WHEELER
                    Sorry.  Sure. 

      He starts to go.

                                  MISTY
                    Wait.

      Something familiar about him...

                                  MISTY (CONT D)
                    Why do I know you?

                                    WHEELER
                    I was your Drivers Ed partner.

      Her jaw drops.

                                  MISTY
                    Oh! I m sorry. God, what a total 
                    ditz I am...

                                    WHEELER
                    It was a long time ago. 

                                  MISTY
                    Sophomore year... feels like a 
                      lifetime...
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    24.

                                  MISTY (CONT'D)
                          (then)
                    I was still a brunette then.

                                    WHEELER
                    And I was still fat.

      This wins a laugh from her.  

                                  MISTY
                    You re funny... I remember that.

      Wheeler s heart soars.  Emboldened, he takes out a joint.

                                    WHEELER
                    Feel like...?
                          ( Getting high? )

      She hesitates, finally nods.  He climbs into the golf cart.  

                                  MISTY
                    You know I still don t know how to 
                    parallel park.

      They both crack up.



      A post-coital David and Karen lay in a sweaty tangle gazing 
      up at the starry sky.

                                  KAREN
                    What are you thinking?

                                  DAVID
                     I hope nothing crawls up my ass. 

                                  KAREN
                    Be serious.

                                  DAVID
                    I m not thinking about anything.

                                  KAREN
                          (sarcastic)
                    Your mind is a total blank?

                                  DAVID
                    It s taking some effort but yeah. 
                    And I m kinda digging it. In fact I 
                    I think I need to do it more often.

                                  KAREN
                    Not think?                                                                                    25.


                                  DAVID
                    Just... be.

      She props herself up on an elbow so she s looking at him.

                                  KAREN
                    Want to know what I was thinking?

                                  DAVID
                    What?

                                  KAREN
                          (smiles)
                    I was just imagining what it ll be 
                    like when you re done with NYU and 
                    I m finished nursing school and we 
                    both have good jobs and a cute 
                    little place together with curtains 
                    and a garbage disposal and a cat... 
                    and it suddenly occurred to me, 
                     Holy shit! Someday we could be 
                    members here! 

      David stares up at the night sky with the look of a guy who s 
      spotted an inbound asteroid.



      Wheeler and Misty sit in the golf cart sharing a joint and 
      talking quietly.

                                    WHEELER
                    Did he give a reason?

                                  MISTY
                    He said he  wasn t ready for the 
                    real thing.  Whatever that means.

                                    WHEELER
                    It s a douchier version of  It s 
                    not you, it s me. 

                                  MISTY
                    I just assumed it means he wants to 
                    screw other people.

                                    WHEELER
                    That too.

        A melancholy beat.                                                                                    26.


                                    WHEELER (CONT D)
                    I know you don t want to hear this 
                    right now but I think you re better 
                    off. He s a dick. Always has been. 
                          (heartfelt)
                    ...You deserve better.

                                  MISTY
                    Thanks.

      Wheeler looks over at her.  It pains him to see her so 
      heartsick and miserable.  

      Eager to cheer her up he suddenly turns the golf cart on and 
      grabs the steering wheel.

                                  MISTY (CONT D)
                    What are you doing?

                                    WHEELER
                    Taking a spin. For old time s sake. 
                      Drivers-ed class!

      The golf cart lurches into motion.



      David and Karen are getting dressed when they see the GOLF 
      CART careening toward them.  They jump clear of its path as 
      it goes barreling past.

      David scowls after the golf cart, recognizing its driver.

                                  DAVID
                    Wheeler?



      Nash checks his watch for the umpteenth time as Getty limbers 
      up for the re-match.

                                  GETTY
                    Looks like your guy is a no-show.

                                  NASH
                    Let s give him a few more minutes.

                                  GETTY
                    This is exactly what I m talking 
                    about, Nasser. It s not just skills 
                    the kid lacks. It s the maturity.  
                    Respect for the game. He s a punk. 
                    He doesn t belong here, he should 
                    be working a fry station at 
                      Mcdonalds...                                                                                    30.


      Just then David shows up.  He s wearing dark sunglasses to 
      hide his bloodshot eyes.

      Nash hands him a sports bottle.  David sips it and chokes.

                                  DAVID
                    What is this?!

                                  NASH
                    Hair of the dog. Absolut and 
                    Gatorade.

      He hands him a racquet, briefs him like a boxer s cornerman.

                                  NASH (CONT D)
                    You re serving against the wind so 
                    I strung it a little looser. Watch 
                    his backhand. He s a baseliner so 
                    keep the ball deep with plenty of 
                    topspin.

                                  DAVID
                    Ugh...I m hurting so bad....can t 
                    do this.

                                  NASH
                    You ARE GOING TO fucking do this.

                                  DAVID
                    Why?

      He looks at his boss.

                                  DAVID (CONT D)
                    Why do you care, Nash? I mean it 
                    can t be that hard to replace me. 
                    Must be dozens of guys good enough 
                    to work here.

      Nash gives this some thought.  His expression serious.

                                  NASH
                    I don t know, kid. I suppose you 
                    remind me of myself at your age... 
                    beige-r, not as well endowed... But 
                    gifted. Hard working. Lotta hustle. 
                    Lotta heart...
                          (then)
                    Also, none of the other guys I 
                      interviewed would accept the shitty 
                    split you agreed to on their hourly 
                    rate. Sixty-forty! Jesus! What a 
                    schmuck!                                                                                     31.


      David doesn t know whether to be touched or pissed by this.  
      Nash slaps him on the ass.

                                  NASH (CONT D)
                    Now go get him, Tiger.

      David and Getty walk to their respective baselines and ready 
      themselves to do battle.

      As the match gets underway... 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MONTAGE

      MUSIC:  Kiss s  I Was Made For Loving You  plays over SHOTS 
      of David fighting for his job - Clearly hurting, but still 
      hitting winner after winner. INTERCUT with the following:



      Wheeler is coming to visit Misty on his break when he sees 
      her canoodling by the lifeguard s stand with Steve LeFevre. 
      The two clearly reconciled.  

      Off Wheeler s crestfallen look...



      David calls a  time out  and walks over to the sidelines 
      where he pukes.

      Off Getty s disapproving look...



      David (who desperately wants to get this over with so he can 
      go to bed) scores another win.

      Off Getty s temper tantrum...                                                                                    32.



      A nurse wheels a newly discharged Sam outside where Judy is 
      waiting with their Honda. 

      Off Sam s efforts to tip the nurse...



      David is about to serve when he sees a surprise spectator 
      following the tennis match... 

      It s Skye, the dark-eyed beauty from the pool.  

      David s concentration is blown and he misses Getty s shot.

      Nash curses from the sidelines. 

      David takes a breath to settle his stomach and re-focus...

      And an eerie calm comes over him as the world drops away and 
      with it all worries... 

      As he lightly tosses the tennis ball up and watches with soft 
      eyes as it floats skyward and seems to hang there against the 
      brilliant blue for an eternity...

      Before David SLEDGEHAMMERS IT past Getty in a blazing blur.

      And wins the match.

                                  GETTY
                    FUCK! FUCK FUCK FUCK!

      Getty exits in a huff.  An ecstatic Nash bear-hugs David.

                                  NASH
                      Fantastic, kid! Fucking incredible! 

      He peels off three hundred dollar bills and gives it to him.

                                  DAVID
                    What s this?

                                  NASH
                    Your cut of the winnings.

                                  DAVID
                    You had money on me?

                                  NASH
                    Five hundred a game! You just made 
                    me three grand!                                                                                    33.


      He s so happy he kisses him David full on the mouth.

                                  NASH (CONT D)
                    Bloody Mary s at the Grill on me!

      David sees Skye waiting outside the cyclone fence for him.

                                  DAVID
                    I ll catch up.

      He walks over to talk to Skye.  

                                  SKYE
                    Good match.

                                  DAVID
                    Thanks. I m David, by the way.

                                  SKYE
                    I know.

      Her eyes mischievous.

                                  DAVID
                    You gonna tell me your name?

                                  SKYE
                    No.

                                  DAVID
                    Why not?

                                  SKYE
                          (sexy smile)
                    More fun to make you work for it.

      And she turns to go.

                                  DAVID
                    Wait.

                                  SKYE
                    Yes?

                                  DAVID
                    Why did you come to watch?

                                  SKYE
                    To see if you were any good. And to 
                    see you beat him.

                                  DAVID
                    You know that asshole?                                                                                    34.


      Another secret smile.

                                  SKYE
                    He s my father.

      She enjoys David s look of surprise, then turns and goes.   

      David is standing there, watching her walk away, when all of 
      a sudden --

                                  VOICE
                    Better watch out for that one...

      An impish OLD CLUB MEMBER (HERB, 70s, tennis whites) is 
      standing beside him.

                                  DAVID
                    Think so?

                                  HERB
                          (nods sagely)
                    Take it from me, son, the female of 
                    the species is deadlier than the 
                    male.

      David laughs.

                                  DAVID
                    I ll have to remember that, Mr....?

                                  HERB
                    Herb.

                                  DAVID
                    Any other advice?

                                  HERB
                    We ll talk.
                          (then)
                    Nice match, by the way...

      His eyes twinkle mischievously as he turns and toddles off.

      David stands there alone, exhausted, sweaty, hugely hungover. 
      And wondering what the hell to make of this strange place...

      And then he smiles.

                                  THE END
