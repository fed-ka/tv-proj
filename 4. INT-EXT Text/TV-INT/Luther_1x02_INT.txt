Reed sips coffee. He s watching a live VIDEO FEED FROM THE 
  INTERVIEW ROOM.

ANGLE ON SCREEN: MARK NORTH is being questioned by Rose Teller.


Mark and Teller. 

                                    TELLER
                  Thanks for coming in so early. As you 
                  know, DCILuther is facing a charge of 
                  assault occasioning actual bodily 
                  harm. These are matters we take very 
                  seriously indeed, but I need to hear 
                  from you, MrNorth, without prejudice, 
                  exactly what happened yesterday.

                                    MARK
                  Look, the truth is - Luther was 
                  defending himself. I m not proud of 
                  this, but I threw the first punch. And 
                  honestly - I do think the police went 
                in a bit heavy-handed.

                                    TELLER
                        (quietly flabbergasted)
                  Well, I thank you for your candour. I 
                  will ask you to sign a statement to 
                  this effect - 

                                    MARK
                  That s why I m here.


Reed phones Luther.


Reed gets voicemail.Mutters a curse to himself.


Mark exits - walks to his CAR, waiting at the kerb with Zoe at 
the wheel. He gets in. Exhales long and hard.          LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 3.


                                  ZOE
                  I know how hard that was for you. 

                                    MARK
                I m fine.
                          (checkswatch)
                  Although I might work from home today.

                                  ZOE
                        (kisses him)
                  Thank you.

She starts the engine, pulls away.


The SERIOUS CRIME UNIT is far busier than we ve yet seen it - 
PLAIN CLOTHED OFFICERS come and go, operate desk phones, 
computers. An air of grim purpose. 

  Ripleyis reviewing CCTV FOOTAGE. Luther approaches. 

                                    LUTHER
                  Anything?

                                    RIPLEY
                  Could be.

  Ripleyunfolds a PAPER MAP. He s drawn a bullseyeon it using a 
red marker pen - which he now uses as a pointing tool. 

                                    RIPLEY(cont d)
                  CobdenLane links NorthlightRoad and 
                  StockwoodHill...here to here. 

Ripley hits a key. We see CCTV FOOTAGE OF AN EMPTY STREET. Into 
frame walks a MAN IN A HOODY.RIPLEYhits PAUSE. The image is 
frozen, grainy, ghostly.

                                    RIPLEY(cont d)
                  Less than three minutes after the 
                  shooting, this man crossed the road 
                  half a kilometrefrom the Stockwood
                  Hill exit.

CCTV FOOTAGE: the man crosses the deserted street. 

                                    LUTHER
                  That s it? 

                                    RIPLEY
                  Lucky to get that. 

                                    LUTHER
                  Where does he go?

                                    RIPLEY
                  Ducks behind shops on Hamilton Row. 
                  Behind that, there s another lane. 
                  Gives onto allotments, gardens, a 
                  canal...          LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 8.


                                    LUTHER
                No more CCTV?

                                    RIPLEY
                  Coverage is spotty at best. Plus, most 
                  cameras in the area have been 
                  vandalised.

                                    LUTHER
                  Vandalisedwhen?

                                    RIPLEY
                        (checks paperwork)
                  Four were reported down -
                        (sees it)
                  - four went down Monday night. 

                                    LUTHER
                The shooter took them out. So we need 
                to go back, review footage taken seven 
                  days before the sabotage, see if we 
                  can t catch our man on a recce.Let me 
                  hear the 999 call again.

Ripley hits keys. Luther keeps watching the looped CCTV 
  footage.

                                  999 DESPATCH (RECORDED)
                  You re through to the police, caller.

                                    OWEN (RECORDED)
                  There s been a shooting. A man is 
                  lying face-down at the Northlightend 
                of CobdenLane. 

                                    LUTHER
                  That s an efficient call-  essential 
                  information, no ambiguity. Like he 
                  knows his Voice Procedure. 
                          (considersthe CCTV images)
                  People leaving scene of crime...they 
                  hunch, look at the ground, avoid eye-
                  contact. Or do that stupid alpha male 
                  swagger. This man - he s got a 
                  straight back, square shoulders. He s 
                  calm, alert, attentive to his 
                  surroundings. Like he s -
                        (grins as he sees it)
                  Pound to a penny, he s armed forces. 

                                    RIPLEY
                You get that from this?          LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 9.


                                    LUTHER
                You ever walk into a pub, cafe,  
                  whatever, know straight away the bloke 
                  next to you s a copper?

                                    RIPLEY
                  Sometimes, yeah.

                                    LUTHER
                  I grew up around soldiers. The way he 
                  shoots, the way he talks, the way he 
                  walks. He s a soldier. 

The predator s glee fades - Luther grabs a chair from a nearby 
desk - hauls it over - sits very close to Ripley. Low and fast.

                                    LUTHER(cont d)
                We need to look at armed forces 
                  personnel who vesuffered at the hands 
                of the police. Dig up aggravated 
                  arrest complaints - filed by veterans 
                on behalf of themselves, friends, 
                  family.

                                    RIPLEY
                  It ll be a long list. Soldiers back 
                  from war, they don t find it easy. 
                  They get depressed, they drink, they 
                  fight - they get arrested.

                                    LUTHER
                  Justin, this was an execution - but 
                the assassin can t have been targeting 
                  Gorman and Eppley.So what if that 
                  means he was targeting their uniforms?

A beat as this sinks in. Ripley glances round the busy unit.

                                    RIPLEY
                Got you. I m on it. 

  Luther s phone rings. He pats Ripley sshoulder, then stands, 
  checking it out. ALICE MORGAN.

He rolls his eyes - heads to his office, shuts the door.


Turns his back on the unit, paces as he talks.

                                    LUTHER
                  What do you want?


Henry Madsen. Deep in coma. Hooked up to an EEGthat shows 
minimal brainwave activity. 

Next to him sits Alice Morgan!        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 10.


She s wearing a WIG. CLOSE ON HER we notice her VISITOR S 
BADGE. A photo, the name INGRID JONES, a stamp identifying her 
as coming from CHRISTIAN MEDICAL OUTREACH.

  A POLICE OFFICER stands guard at the door. Drinking tea, 
reading a newspaper.

                                    ALICE
                  I ve been reading Bertrand Russell to 
                  a friend of yours. 
                        (reads)
                   Often the good suffer, and often the 
                  wicked prosper, and one hardly knows 
                  which of those is the more annoying. 

  INTERCUT LUTHER and ALICE

                                    LUTHER
                  What do you mean? Where are you?

                                    ALICE
                If only he could speak. What tales he 
                  could tell.

Out on her smile - and Luther s horror as he hangs up.


Luther strides back through to Ripley sdesk.

                                    LUTHER
                  What vewe got?

                                    RIPLEY
                  Half a dozen names hit key markers - 
                  mostly drunk and disorderly, 
                  aggravated assaults. But I m thinking, 
                  meh- not enough for our boy. 

                                    LUTHER
                So broaden the search parameters - 
                  include veterans of the first Gulf 
                  War, Northern Ireland. Go back to the 
                  Falklands - he s in there somewhere.

Ripley gets to work as Luther exits.


Luther strides down the corridor - badges the GUARD outside 
  Madsen s room. 

                                    LUTHER
                Get yourself a cup of coffee. I need 
                  five minutes.


Alice looks up and over her book as Luther enters.         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 11.


                                    LUTHER 
                  What are you doing? 

She stands. Folds over a page - puts down the book. They face  
each other over Madsen smotionless body. 

                                    ALICE
                  Investigating you. 

                                    LUTHER
                  I don t know what that means.

                                    ALICE
                It means I m curious about how Henry  
                  came to be here, like this.

                                    LUTHER
                  Well there s no need to be curious. He 
                  killed children. I caught him. He 
                  tried to run away. He fell.

                                    ALICE
                And who actually believes that?

                                    LUTHER
                  Everyone who matters.

                                    ALICE
                  Zoe, for example?

                                    LUTHER
                  Yes.

                                    ALICE
                  Because do you know what I think?

                                    LUTHER
                  I couldn t hope to guess, Alice, no. 

                                    ALICE
                  I think you gave in to your true 
                  nature - just for a second - and let 
                him fall. And you couldn t take it. 
                You gave in to guilt and self-
                  loathing. How am I doing? 

                                    LUTHER
                Not so well.

                                    ALICE
                But mostly, you were terrified that 
                Zoe might discover what you d done - 
                and learn what kind of man you 
                  actually are.

                                    ALICE(cont d)
                You don t know anything about me, let 
                  alone my marriage.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 12.


                                    ALICE(cont d)
                  I can always ask her myself. See what 
                she says. 

                                    LUTHER
                  Hand to God, Alice. I know this is 
                  sport to you. But you need to stop. 
                  Just stop. Stay away from Zoe. Don t 
                go near her. Don t say a word - not 
                  about any of this. Any of it.

                                    ALICE
                  Why, exactly? Are you scared of what 
                  I ll find out - or what she will?

SCENE 17 OMITTED1717


Long disused. Boards on the windows.

The KILLER, OWEN LYNCH, fills a kettle from a bottle of mineral 
water, puts it to boil on a PRIMUSSTOVE. 

On a rickety chair is balanced an OLD PORTABLE TV. It s plugged 
into a car battery. Owen turns it on.

Doing so, he passes a FORMICA TABLE. On it is laid a HUNTING 
KNIFE - and what could be BOMB MAKING EQUIPMENT.

He turns on the TV, volume low. Lays down the REVOLVER he used 
to kill Gorman and Eppley.

  Finally, he turns on the POLICE RADIO. Listens to the CHATTER 
as the kettle boils.


Owen pours hot water into the sink - washes - shaves - 
  meticulously combs short hair into a neat parting.


Owen takes the clothes from the dry cleaner s polytheneand 
begins to dress. Smart trousers, shirt, tie. 

His demeanourlike a nervous young man dressing for a job 
interview. Dressed, he sits at the table and begins to polish 
his shoes - black Kiwi wax, brushes. Like a soldier. 

On the table is a PRINTED SHEET OF A4, weighed down at the 
edges. As Owen polishes his shoes, he reads from the paper. 
  Silently mouths what s written there. Practising.

Also on the table is a CONSUMER VIDEO CAMERA.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 13.



  Ripley sdesk is piled high with paperwork: reports, memoranda, 
crime sheets, military records. 

Luther enters. Ripleyraises a hand like a referee, hands him a 
sheet of paper. Luther snatches it from his hand, scans it. 

                                    RIPLEY
                  Went back to 1975. Got three names - 

Luther scans the report. 

                                    LUTHER
                  This is him.


Luther, Teller and Ripley.

Luther passes Teller some ARMY RECORDS. Showing  -

                                    LUTHER
                  Terry Lynch. Ex-46Commando, Royal 
                  Marines. Decorated Veteran. Eighteen 
                  months ago he killed a police officer 
                  while resisting arrest. 

                                    TELLER
                  Yeah, I remember this. Dennis Sorrel. 
                  Decent bloke - he had one of those 
                  whatsitsin his attic - model train, 
                all the landscaping, the trees and the 
                  little people and whatnot. 

                                    RIPLEY
                  A diorama.

                                    TELLER
                  That s the chap.

                                    LUTHER
                  Lynch was drinking, got into an 
                  altercation about the war in 
                  Afghanistan. Dennis Sorrel s first 
                  responder, he tries to calm things

                  Yeah. Lynch pleaded combat stress.

                  That s maybe not so mad as it sounds. 
                  About ten per cent of the prison 
                  population s comprised of veterans -

                  through at Goose sodding Green, Desert

Luther passes her ANOTHER SET of MILITARY RECORDS. More recent. 
They show Owen Lynch.

                                    LUTHER
                  This is his son - Owen Lynch. Also 46 
                  Commando, Royal Marines. Returned from 
                  Afghanistan last year. Forced to leave 
                  under administrative discharge - 
                  meaning, he s got mental health issues 
                and the army left him high and dry.

                  Statement from his wife, Rachel. She

                  left.  

                                    LUTHER
                He takes it out on her once too often, 
                she throws him out. Which is the last 
                  time he shows on the radar - until 
                  Gorman and Eppleylast night.

                                    TELLER

2323SCENE 23 OMITTED 


Teller, Luther and Ripleyare interrupted by Reed, who s just 
arrived back at work. Still wearing his outdoor coat.

Teller sees his woeful expression. And knows before he speaks.

                                    TELLER
                  What is it?

                                    REED
                  Sorry, Boss. We ve got another officer 
                  down. HarthillEstate.


MUCH BUSTLE AND ACTIVITY - PHONES RINGING, being answered, 
  PERSONNEL in a hurry to be places. Ripley is at his desk, quiet 
in all the chaos. He s looking at PICTURES OF HANSON, EPPLEY
AND GORMAN. And listening to the RADIO.

                                    CORINNE DAY (V/OON RADIO)
                  Despite the Metropolitan Police s 
                  strident denials, there is a sense on 
                the streets of London that the police 
                  presence is being greatly reduced in 
                  response to these killings. And amid 
                the reassurances, a larger question 
                  remains unanswered: after an 
                  unprecedented six fatalities in less 
                  than 24 hours, can the emergency 
                  services afford to maintain their 999 
                  response commitment to the ordinary 
                  people of the capital? This is Corrine 
                  Day, BBCNews, London.

Reed approaches. Sees the state of Ripley. Pulls up a chair.

                                    REED
                You all right?

                  There s people you can speak to, these 
                  days. If you want to.

                Why not?

                                    RIPLEY
                My dad knew I d seen a counsellor, 
                  he d shoot me himself.

No. Just murmurs of unease.

                  Good. Now, this has been a bad day, 
                the worst day most of us have seen on 
                the job - and looking around, I m 
                  reminded that most of us are 
                  bedraggled old fossils with quite a 
                few bad days behind us. So what we do, 
                  ladies and gents, is sniff out this 
                  bastard. Then we show him and the rest 
                of the world that no-one gets to do 
                  this to us. So get out there and get 
                  him. 
                        (beat)
                  Let s have it, then!

Energised, they go to their jobs. Nobody notices the weariness 
at the corner of Teller s eyes. The fear, the loneliness.


Luther and Teller lost in their own meditations - as Ripley  
links up a VIDEO SCREEN. Hits play.

ANGLE ON SCREEN:

  A  YOUTUBE  VIDEO: Owen Lynch talks to camera. He s nervous, 
polite, weirdly personable. This is more like a TV charity 
appeal than an AL Quaidavideo.

                                    OWEN
                My name is Owen Lynch, ex 46 Commando 
                  Royal Marines.

He s replaced on screen by a photograph of TERRY LYNCH in 
  uniform. For a while, we hear Owen in voice over.

                                    OWEN(cont d)
                  This is my dad, Terry Lynch - also 46 
                  Commando, Royal Marines. He was at 
                  Bluff Cove when 46 Commando shot down 
                an Argentine jet - using rifles. After 
                  that, County Armagh. His final tour 
                was in Helmand Province. Last year, he 
                  went to prison for a crime that would 
                  never have been committed if his 
                  country had treated him with the 
                  respect he deserved. But that doesn t 
                  happen. More men who served in the 
                  Falklands have committed suicide since 
                  than died in the war itself. That may 
                  soon be true of men who served in Iraq 
                and Afghanistan.

More photographs of Terry as he talks.         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 20.


                                    OWEN(cont d)
                My dad was defending himself from a 
                  belligerent arrest. He shouldn t be in 
                  prison for murder. Police officers 
                  will continue to die until justice is 
                  done. No negotiations will be entered 
                  into and there will be no further 
                  communications from me. Freedom for 
                  Terry Lynch. 

BACK TO TELLER S OFFICE

                                    LUTHER
                How many views so far?

                                    RIPLEY
                  Thirty thousand and counting.

                All major news media outlets have 
                  picked up on it. It s out there, it s 
                not coming back.

Long beat. Luther studies Owen - frozen there on screen.

                                    LUTHER
                He barely mentions himself. That 
                  strike you as weird? He s back from 
                his war, his life s in shreds - but 
                  this declaration s entirely about his 
                  dad: what his dad achieved, where his 
                dad served -
                        (turns to Ripley)
                  I need to know if Owen visited Terry 
                  Lynch in prison. 

                                    RIPLEY
                        (already leaving)
                On it.

                                    TELLER
                How bad is this going to get?

                                    LUTHER
                  Pretty bad.

His phone rings. He checks it. 

                                    LUTHER(cont d)
                  Excuse me. I need to take this.


Alice looks out onto London, drinking coffee.

                                    ALICE
                  Yes, I heard about the dead policemen. 
                Do you know where your killer is yet?

                                    LUTHER

                                    ALICE
                Why - do you think we belong to a 
                  club?

                                    LUTHER
                It wouldn t surprise me. 

                                    ALICE
                  I know how hard men like you take the 
                  death of fellow officers. It must be 
                  like losing family.

                                    LUTHER
                I m not discussing cases with you. 

                                    ALICE
                Not even interesting ones? 

                                    LUTHER
                  This isn t  interesting . This is good 
                  police officers doing a good job, 
                  gunned down in the street like -  

                                    ALICE
                  Like what?

He can t answer.

                                    ALICE(cont d)
                  That s something we all do, isn t it - 
                in the end - judge who s worth more 
                  than whom. Hitleror Ghandi? The very 
                  young, the very old? 

                                    LUTHER
                  Well, to be fair - most of us don t do 
                it to the extent you do.

                                    ALICE
                But it does mean the difference 
                  between us is one of degree, not 
                  category. Ask Henry Madsen.

                                    LUTHER
                  Look - you win, all right? You re too 
                  clever for me.         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 22.


                                    ALICE
                  Flattery to appease the malignant 
                  narcissist. That s a frivolous tactic. 
                Are you afraid of me?

                                    LUTHER

                  Why?

                                    LUTHER
                You know why.

                                    ALICE
                Do you want me to leave you alone?

                                    LUTHER
                  Yes.

                To help with my investigation. I ve 
                got means, opportunity. You still 
                  haven t given me motive.

                                    LUTHER
                  I don t have a motive. What I ve got 
                is a job.

                                    ALICE
                  It s a bit more than a job, though, 
                  isn t it.

                                    LUTHER

                                    ALICE
                  Lying won t help.

                                    LUTHER
                  I can t say what you want to hear.

                                    ALICE
                Do you think Zoe could clarify the 
                  situation for me?

                                    LUTHER
                  Last time you met Zoe, you shoved a 
                  knife in her ear. I think she d be 
                  disinclined to chat.         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 23.


                                    ALICE
                It wasn t a knife. And I wasn t asking 
                  permission.

                                    LUTHER
                  I don t respond to threats.

                                    ALICE
                  Good for you. I don t make them. I m 
                  just speculating. Does this woman even 
                  know you?

Beat of frustration and despair.

                                    LUTHER
                  Look, punish me if you want, Alice - 
                I m really not sure I can stop you. 
                But you don t get to use Zoe to 
                  blackmail me. 

He hangs up. His hands are shaking. He thinks. Dials. Leaves 
the roof. 

Alice sips coffee. Her smile slowly fading. Becoming something 
serene and mysterious.


Zoe and Mark are working - piles of paperwork, laptops, mobile 
phones. Mark digs his knuckles into his back, stands.

                  Okay - you re looking at Owen Lynch s 
                  most recent visit to his dad. This 
                  would be just over two weeks ago. No 
                  audio, of course.

ANGLE ON SCREEN

Terry Lynch waits, impassive and intimidating, as Owen enters. 
Sits.Terry spreads his hands wide, palms flat, on the desk.

                  Receives Owen like a superior officer.         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 25.


                        (Terry sits back, crosses his 
                        arms)
                  That s ventral denial - powerful 
                  signal of disapproval - pure 
                  dominance. Owen s nervous - stroking 
                his throat, his face - pacifying 
                  gestures. Foot jiggling. Head bowed - 
                  Can t meet his dad s gaze. Whatever 
                  Terry s saying, Owen s finding it 
                  profoundly stressful.

                  When did Terry Lynch lose his appeal?

                So this meeting is what? Two weeks 
                  later. Dominant father. Submissive 
                  son. You see what this is? 
                        (beat)
                  This is Owen Lynch, receiving his 
                  orders.

ANGLE ON SCREEN: as Terry speaks, Owen shakes his head. Terry 
repeats what he s just said. 

And at last Owen nods. All right. All right.

Only now does Terry Lynch unfold his arms. Sit forward. Reach 
out. Touch his son s hand.

                  Listen to yourself. Listen to what

                up the phone, dial his boss, ask her 
                  about this threat. See what she says.  

He offers Zoe the phone - and his eyes soften at her obvious 
  reluctance. 

  Saddened, he puts the phone back in its cradle. Says nothing.

She crosses her arms, turns away. Mark leaves the room.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 27.



Owen eats beans from the tin, watches the news on the portable 
TV

ANGLE ON TV: 

                                    NEWS 24 REPORTER 
                  Police say Owen Lynch is armed and 
                  extremely dangerous. Members of the 
                  public who see him should not attempt 
                to apprehend him, but immediately dial 
                  999.


Terry Lynch is lying on his bunk. A hard man - not cocky,  
  assured. He listens to the rattle of keys in the lock. A PRISON 
OFFICER steps into the open door. 

                                    TERRY
                  Don t tell me. Visitor. 

He grins. Stands. 


TWO PRISON OFFICERS lead Terry down the long, echoing 
corridors, unlocking and locking doors as they go.


Reed enters Terry s cell, snapping on LATEX GLOVES. Ripley
watches from the doorway -

As Reed searches the cell - examines lights and fittings - runs 
hands across the ceiling - slides fingertips underside of the 
window, round the frame - removes bedding, runs blanket and 
sheets through their hands - checks pillow and mattress - 
thumbs through magazines, clothes, a toothpaste tube, a bar of 
soap - a solid deodorant stick -

What s this?

He removes the deodorant stick from its base. Crumbles the 
  deodorant away to reveal - a PLASTIC BAGGIEcontaining a SIM
card.

He produces his phone, disassembles it. Removes and pockets his 
own SIMcard - replaces it with Terry s. Reassembles the phone - 
turns it on.

Luther waits at the desk as TWO PRISON WARDENS lead TERRY LYNCH
into the room.Luther glares at him as he sits. Asserting 
dominance. Holds the glare for a long, challenging beat - 

- and subverts it by leaning forward - friendly - open.

                                    LUTHER
                So two little girls are walking home 
                  from Sunday school. One little girl 
                  says -  Do you believe in the Devil?  
                The other little girl says,  Don t be 
                  silly, of course not. The Devil s like 
                  Santa. It s just your dad. 

Luther shoves a PHOTOGRAPH OF OWEN IN UNIFORM across the table.

                                    LUTHER(cont d)
                The thing about little boys, they 
                  worship their dad like God. The more 
                  invisible he is, the more arbitrary in 
                his punishments and rewards, the more 
                  they crave his approval. 

Terry slides the photo back - face down, like a playing card.

                                    LUTHER(cont d)
                  I know how it must have been for Owen  
                  - my dad was a soldier. 

                                    TERRY
                He was, was he?

                                    TERRY
                  I bet he was a right hard bastard.

                                    LUTHER
                  Well, it was tough for him. Here I am, 
                big boy, eager to please, trying to 
                  care about what he cared about - the 
                  army, sport. But no, nothing there. He 
                  wanted me to box. I wanted to write 
                  lyrics, read books, go out with girls. 
                In the end I gave up trying to make 
                him proud because I knew it was never 
                  going to happen -
                        (leans closer)
                  - but Owen hasn t given up, has he?         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 29.


                  More than anything, Owen wants to make 
                his dad proud.

Terry sits back. Crosses his arms. Waits.

                                    LUTHER(cont d)
                  I know you gave Owen a job to do. But 
                I m not sure you appreciate the 
                  implications. In crimes like this - 
                  half the offenders end it by turning 
                  their gun on themselves. The other 
                  half are shot by police. Owen s going 
                to die, Terry. Unless you help him.

                                    TERRY
                By doing what?

                                    LUTHER
                We know he ll be monitoring the TV for 
                  news of the investigation.

                                    TERRY
                  Makes sense, yeah.

                                    LUTHER
                So go on camera. Ask him to stop. 
                  Rescind the order.

                                    TERRY
                  I could do that.

                                    LUTHER
                  But?

                                    TERRY
                I d need a reduction in sentence.

                                    LUTHER
                  That s not going to happen. You killed 
                  a police officer.

                                    TERRY
                I m not asking for a pardon - just a  
                  reduction. I got life for murder. It 
                  should ve been five years, 
                  manslaughter with diminished. I ll 
                  take that - with time served. 

                                    LUTHER
                  Even if there was a precedent, there d
                be no time. 

                                    TERRY
                  Well, I don t know about that. Owen 
                can look after himself. He could be 
                out there for weeks before you catch 
                  him. Weeks and weeks.         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 30.


                                    LUTHER
                  This is your child we re talking 
                  about.

                  You re killing him.

                                    TERRY
                Not if you give me what I want. 

                                    LUTHER
                You don t get what you want. We know 
                  where Owen is. 

                                    TERRY
                  I ve got faith in the boy. He s a good 
                  soldier. 

                                    LUTHER
                  He s outnumbered. He s completely 
                  alone.

                                    TERRY
                He knows when to hit hard and when to 
                lie low. Who knows what damage he can 
                do before you catch him? 

                                    LUTHER
                  Don t do this to him. 

                                    TERRY
                  Five years, including time served, and 
                  transfer to an open prison. You decide 
                you can do that for me - then come 
                  back and bring all the cameras you 
                  want.

Luther holds his gaze for a long, hate-filled moment. Then 
stands and exits.

SCENE 46 - 48 INCLUSIVE OMITTED


Luther strides down the corridor. Ripleyis waiting. They walk.  

                                    RIPLEY
                We found a SIMcard, one number listed 
                in the contacts. Belongs to a Pay-as- 
                  You-Go which we traced to 185 ELLWYN
                  MEWS. That s a vacant property, 
                  overlooked by a trading estate, 
                  commercial buildings. Makes a decent 
                  bolt hole.

                                    LUTHER
                  Owen Lynch won t let himself be 
                  arrested. He d rather die. 

                                    RIPLEY
                  Yeah. Nobody seem to be having much of 
                  a problem with that. 


Zoe on the phone.

                                  ZOE
                No. No, we re still here. 

  INTERCUT ZOE AND LUTHER.

                                    LUTHER
                  I don t believe it. Why? 

                                  ZOE
                  John, it s illegal to threaten 
                  someone s life.
                So if Alice Morgan has threatened me, 
                why don t you arrest her?

He glances at Ripley- who s blithely affecting to be unaware 
of the kind of conversation Luther s having.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 32.


                                    LUTHER
                  Because I can t.

                                  ZOE
                Why not?

                                    LUTHER
                  It s complicated.

                                  ZOE
                It always is. What has this woman got 
                on you? What have you done?

                                    LUTHER
                  I don t have time for this. Please - 
                  just trust me. 

Mark enters the room and listens quietly.

                                  ZOE
                  Thing is, I m not sure I do. If I 
                  called Rose Teller, would she know 
                  about this?

                                    LUTHER
                  Have you called her?

                                  ZOE
                Not yet. Should I?

                                    LUTHER
                No, don t do that. Don t call her.

Long beat.

                                  ZOE
                  That tells me everything, doesn t it? 
                So what s really going on? What have 
                you done?

                                    LUTHER
                  I really don t have time. At least - 
                  Christ, lock your doors and windows. 
                  Anything happens, call me.

He hangs up. 

                                    RIPLEY
                  Everything okay?

Luther doesn t answer. Just strides on. Frustrated beyond 
endurance. 


Zoe stands there, swearing softly. 

                                    MARK
                So - ?         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 33.


                                  ZOE
                So you were right - he was lying. When 
                do I learn, eh? Twenty years, and when 
                do I learn?

Mark steps forward, embraces her. Strokes her hair.

                                    MARK
                I m sorry. I really am. I m sorry.

Owen tests one mobile phone by calling it from another. 

In front of him is the table, TV on top, the detritus of his 
work station: ammo, gas cylinder etc.


- which is where Owen has moved his base to. He s at the table, 
MOBILE PHONE in one hand - it s the remote trigger. The STOLEN 
POLICE RADIO on the table before him.

                  hospitals on notice!

Owen smiles. Not without sadness. Puts down the phone. Turns on 
the TV. Fills the kettle from a plastic bottle.

SCENES 57 - 61 OMITTED


Luther enters. Reed and Ripleyare huddled miserably and 
  silently. 

                                    LUTHER
                  CO19?

                  Well, if there s one thing you ll pick 
                up in Iraq, it s how to make an 
                  improvised explosive device. Lynch?

                                    RIPLEY
                  Still searching. Helicopters, ground

                                    REED
                But it was a remote-detonated bomb. He 
                had to be close, watching. That puts 
                him inside - what? Five hundred 
                  metres, line of sight? I don t get it, 
                how he just slips away like that.

                  It s not your fault.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 36.


                                    REED
                He wanted us to find that SIMcard. I 
                bit down on it like a Mars Bar. Of 
                  course it s my fault.

Teller enters. Equally weary.

                                    TELLER
                  It s official. As of five minutes ago, 
                the Owen Lynch operation was passed up 
                to Anti-Terrorism. So it s out of our 
                  hands.

                                    LUTHER
                All they ll do is give Terry Lynch 
                  what he wants. More blood. More dead 
                  coppers. You can t let that happen.

                                    TELLER
                  Seeing as I left my magic wand at the 
                  repair shop I haven t got much sodding 
                  choice. Look, we don t have to like 
                  this - but we do have to accept it. 

Luther turns away, angry. He flicks through Owen Lynch s 
  MILITARY RECORDS, school photographs. Owen in uniform. Owen in 
combat gear - desert camo- webbing - helmet - goggles - rifle - 
  earpiece - microphone.

  Earpiece. Microphone.

  Earpiece - microphone.

  EARPIECE! He sees it. Owen wasn t watching. He was listening.

He shuts the file. Turns to exit. 

                                    TELLER(cont d)
                  Where you going?

                                    LUTHER
                I m done for the day.

He exits. The others watching.  


He s not going home. He strides to the evidence room.


On a BARE TABLE before him, Luther has EPPLEYand GORMAN S 
  UNIFORMS and DUTY BELTS. Every individual item in an evidence 
bag. 

He picks up one DUTY BELT. Examines it. Examines one RADIO. 
Then a second.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 37.


They re DIFFERENT. Very similar models. But not exactly the 
same.

He stands there, comparing them - as if weighing them up. Takes 
his own POLICE RADIO from his belt. Compares it to the two in 
  evidence. 

Finally reaches a decision. Walks away.


Luther charges back in with the two radios.

                                    TELLER
                  What s this now?

                We use Airwave, right? It s digital, 
                  secure. Impossible for civilians to 
                  pick up a scanner and listen in. 

                                    REED
                  And?

                                    LUTHER
                  These phones are different. Owen did a 
                  swap.
                        (shesnatches them from his 
                        hands)
                You need to call anti-terrorism. Warn 
                  them he s listening to everything we 
                  say. 

Teller gives him back the radios, lifts the desk phone.

                  this information, because this case is 
                no longer ours. Am I being transparent 
                  here? Tell me if I m being at all 
                  ambiguous. There is nothing we can do 
                  with this, except pass it on.

                                    LUTHER
                  Well, there s nothing anybody can do, 
                is there? Because nobody knows where 
                  Owen Lynch is. And he ll just keep on 
                  killing until someone finds him and 
                  stops him.         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 38.


                                    TELLER
                  They ll find him.

                                    LUTHER
                  Yeah? How?

A beat - a challenge -

                                    LUTHER(cont d)
                  Whatever. I m done.

He heads to the exit. On route he stops for a moment. Thinks. 
  Decides. Then opens a nearby desk drawer, takes out AN ENVELOPE 
and peeks inside. He pockets the envelope and leaves.


Luther sits down once more with Terry Lynch. 

                                    LUTHER
                  You re not getting what you want, 
                  Terry. But you ve known that from the 
                  start, I think.

Terry shrugs.

                                    LUTHER(cont d)
                  You re not a stupid man. You know 
                  you re never getting out of here. You 
                  just want to punish the people you 
                  blame for it. 

                                    TERRY
                  Think what you like.

                                    LUTHER
                  Always do, that s part of my problem. 
                So what s going to happen is this - 
                  Anti-Terrorism goes in big and noisy. 
                  Owen dies.

                                    TERRY
                  Then he dies happy, doing what he 
                  loves. That s more than most of us 
                  get.

                                    LUTHER
                  It s a damn sight more than you re 
                  going to get.

                                    LUTHER
                I m pretty sure you can take a slap.

                  Camera s off. 

                                    TERRY
                  I think I ll send my boy for you. Your 
                  doorbell rings, you re walking to the 
                  shops - and there he is. Bang. Right 
                  through the skull. So go on. Hit me. 
                  Doesn t matter. You re dead.

                                    LUTHER
                You and me both.

                                    TERRY
                  What - you re going to kill me, are 
                  you?

                                    LUTHER
                  Tell the truth, I do fancy it. But 
                  murdering people leads to so much fuss 
                and bother afterwards. So here s what 
                  I thought about doing. I know a lot of 
                  people in this prison - screws, 
                  inmates - a lot of really bad people. 

He takes something from his pocket - a length of thin rope. 
Lays it on the table. It s a noose.

Long beat. Eye contact.

                                    LUTHER (cont d)
                  Seemed to me, the best way to end this 
                is to have you commit suicide in your 
                  cell tonight. I don t think anybody 
                  would be surprised. History of 
                  depression, PTSD, blah blah blah.  
                      (off Terry s expression)
                  I ve done a lot worse.

Terry s eyes.

                                    TERRY
                  You ve done nothing, mate. 

                                    LUTHER
                        (sits back)
                  See, I knew you d say that. Because 
                the thing about you, Terry - you re a 
                  hard bastard aren t you?         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 40.


                  Being a hard bastard s all you ve got. 
                You can t give in to threats - because 
                  then you wouldn t be a hard bastard 
                any more. You d rather die than lose 
                the respect you ve earned in here. I 
                can see that. 

                                    TERRY
                So why are we here?

                                    LUTHER
                  Because I m going to strip that
                  dignity away. Make you the most 
                  reviled person in here.

                                    TERRY
                I d like to see you give it a go - 
                  give myself a little chuckle. It s 
                  little things like that break up the 
                  monotony of the day.

Luther grins - reaches into his pocket. Produces AN ENVELOPE. 

                                    LUTHER
                  Everyone in here knows we searched 
                  your cell. Easiest thing in the world 
                to let them know this is what we 
                  found.

Chucks the envelope to Terry. Who looks inside - then gives 
Luther a look of icy abhorrence.

                                    LUTHER(cont d)
                  I haven t been able to look at them, 
                  myself. But they tell me none of these 
                  little boys is older than nine.

                                    TERRY
                  This giving you a thrill, is it? 

                                    LUTHER
                  Terry Lynch, hard man - that s one 
                  thing. Terry Lynch, nonce - well, 
                  that s something else altogether. I 
                  don t think you could endure that. 

                                    TERRY
                  Nobody dbelieve it.

                                    LUTHER
                  Yeah? You sure? You get your son to go 
                  round doing whatever you tell him - 
                  even kill coppers. What kind of thing 
                do you have to do to a boy, eh?To 
                  give you that kind of control over 
                  him? 

A long, insinuating beat. Luther s grin.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 41.


                                    LUTHER(cont d)
                  What kind of thing did you have to do?

With an abrupt, violent gesture Terry sweeps all the photos 
into the corner. Then stands, kicking it away, showing his 
  absolute disgust. Turns to Luther with rage. 

                                    TERRY
                You really are a piece of shit, aren t 
                  you? You really are scum.

                                    LUTHER
                  I am. I really am. Now, this is a one 
                  time offer. So give me what I want. 


Reed brings in two cups of tea. Teller is watching ROLLING NEWS 
  COVERAGE OF THE SHOOTINGS.The clock counts from 10:09 to 10:10 
P.M. 

                                    NEWS 24 REPORTER 
                And as night falls on a stunned 
                  capital and police, ambulance and fire 
                  crews respond to 999 calls in full 
                  body armour, Corinne Day has been 
                  talking to Detective Chief Inspector 
                  John Luther, Senior Investigating 
                  Officer of the so-called 999 
                  Shootings.  

Teller looks up sharply.

                                    TELLER
                  What did he just say?        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 42.



Owen zips the assault rifle into the sportsbag.Follows it with 
a SNIPER S SCOPE. Extra rounds of ammunition. What looks like a 
pretty serious IED.

Opens the door. About to leave on another mission to kill -

- then HEARS LUTHER ON TV, TALKING ABOUT HIM. He turns, the 
open door in his hand. Watches. 

                                    CORINNE (ON TV)
                  Detective Chief Inspector Luther, what 
                do we know about Owen Lynch s 
                  motivations?


Reed and Teller, dumbfounded.

                                    LUTHER (ON TV)
                  Well, Lynch clearly prides himself on 
                  being a soldier from a long line of 
                  soldiers. But we ve interviewed his 
                  commanding officers, his military 
                  doctors - psychiatrists -

                                    REED
                  Holy shit.

                                    TELLER
                Oh no. Oh no, oh no, oh no.
                        (flings open door)
                  SERGEANT RIPLEY!


Owen is taken aback by what this man is saying. He sets down 
the sports bag. Closes the door. Tonight s mission has been 
postponed.

He stares at the portable TV with cold fury.

                                    LUTHER (ON TV)
                  - all of whom made it clear that, 
                  although Lynch has an impressive 
                  number of kills to his name, they were 
                  aware of certain - flaws in his 
                  character.Lynch was never really 
                  soldier material. He was a maladjusted 
                  child who grew up with too much TV, 
                too much Playstation. 

                                    OWEN
                  Liar. 


Ripley, Teller and Reed - watching the broadcast.         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 43.


                                    TELLER
                Is any of this even true?

                                    REED
                Not even slightly.

                                    LUTHER (on tv)
                We do know that, upon his return from 
                  Afghanistan, Owen developed severe 
                  sexual difficulties. 

Reed, Teller and Ripleygroan, wince, turn away - ouch - 

                                    RIPLEY
                  He s making himself into a target - 
                  drawing Lynch s fire from the police 
                  force in general.

                                    TELLER
                  This is suicide.


Owen watching with fury in his eyes.

                                    LUTHER (ON TV)
                  Despite claims he made about a so 
                  called  mission , it s likely these 
                  murders in fact represent a sexual 
                  release - a way to deal with feelings 
                of personal and sexual impotence -


Zoe and Mark are reading, drinking wine. TV is muted in the 
  background. Zoe looks up.And there s Luther. She turns it up.

                                    CORINNE (ON TV)
                  - and what leads you to these 
                  conclusions?

                                    LUTHER (ON TV)
                  Partly experience with killers of this 
                  nature, who do tend to be profoundly 
                  inadequate. And partly because Lynch s 
                  father wasn t the hero he d have you 
                  believe. He s an alcoholic, a wife 
                  beater. 
                        (steps back to reveal the 
                        prison in background)
                Who incidentally denies all knowledge 
                of his son s activities. 

                                  ZOE
                Oh God, what s he doing?

                How close are you to catching him? 

                                    LUTHER (ON TV)
                  Well, I ve just had a long 
                  conversation with his father, who 
                  provided a great deal of vital 
                  information. 
                        (direct to camera)
                So I ll be seeing you soon, Owen. 

The broadcast ends on LUTHER S EYES, staring from the screen. 
  Directly at Owen Lynch.

Owen stares back. Then goes to the sports bag. Unzips it. 

Removes the assault rifle. Checks the sighting mechanism.

Gets ready.

SCENE 77 OMITTED7777


Zoe and Mark - looking at the TV. Both of them aghast. 

Mark s about to say something when Zoe shushes him -

She s heard A NOISE. Just a small noise. A muted POP.She 
frowns, stands, slowly. Puts down her book. 

                                    MARK
                Wh-

                                  ZOE
                  Shhhh

He stands too. Laying down his book. Follows her from the room


They edge down the hallway. Zoe hesitates - at ANOTHER SMALL 
noise. A cupboard being softly opened. Shut again. Gentle chink 
of glass. 

Zoe moves forward -


  - enters the kitchen. To see ALICE MORGAN sitting at their 
table. A bottle of wine and three glasses before her.

                                  ZOE
                And you are?

                                    ALICE
                  A friend of John s. We ve met, 
                  actually.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 45.


                                    MARK
                All right. I don t care who you are. 
                  Leave, please. Right now.

                                    ALICE
                Or -?

Mark picks up the phone. 

                                    ALICE(cont d)
                Go ahead. But it won t be good for 
                  John.

                                    MARK
                  Well, bollocksto John. 

But Zoe places a hand on his forearm  - a long beat - and Mark 
lowers the phone. 

Zoe faces Alice. Cool challenge in her eyes.

                                  ZOE
                So. How can we help you?

                                    ALICE
                  I ve been wondering - why do you think 
                he does it? 

                                  ZOE
                Why does who do what?

                                    ALICE
                  John. His job. It takes such a toll. 
                Why does he put himself through it?

                                  ZOE
                  I don t see how this is relevant.

                                    ALICE
                  Well, it is. Right this second, you 
                  might actually be helping him. What do 
                you think compellshim to do it?

                                  ZOE
                  Duty.

                                    ALICE
                To what?

                                  ZOE
                The dead. Mock all you like.

                                    ALICE
                I m not mocking.

                                  ZOE
                He believes - one life is all we have. 
                  Life and love. Whoever takes life 
                  steals everything.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 46.


                                    ALICE
                And do you agree? 

                                  ZOE
                  I don t know. I think, if he d read a 
                  different book by a different writer 
                at just the right time in his life, 
                  he d have been a different man. He d 
                  have been happier as a priest than -

                                    ALICE
                  Than what? 

                                  ZOE
                  Than what he is.

                                    ALICE
                It must have been difficult for you. 
                  Impossible, really. How does anyone 
                  compete with a calling like that?

                                  ZOE
                He wasn t blind. He knew what it was 
                  costing him.

                                    ALICE
                  Like his marriage?

                                  ZOE
                  That s part of it, yeah.

                                    ALICE
                But you don t sound bitter.

                                  ZOE
                I m not bitter. I m proud of him.

                                    ALICE
                You just don t want to be married to 
                  him.

                                  ZOE
                Not any more. No.

                                    ALICE
                Why not?

                                  ZOE
                I m not going to answer that.

                                    ALICE
                Is it because he tried to kill Henry 
                  Madsen?

                                  ZOE
                No. 

                                    ALICE
                But that is what you think?         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 47.


                                  ZOE
                Do you know what Henry Madsendid? 

                                    ALICE
                  I have some idea, yes.

                                  ZOE
                He was a freak of nature. Anyone would 
                be tempted to - 

                                    ALICE
                  - but we re not talking about anyone, 
                  we re talking about John. Do you think 
                  John tried to kill him - on behalf of 
                the dead?

A long, long beat. Zoe refuses to break eye contact - and 
refuses to answer -

- While Mark looks on with quiet astonishment. 

                                    ALICE (cont d)
                  Well, I think that answers the 
                  question. 

She gives Zoe a dazzling smile. Open and radiant and lovely. 

                                    ALICE(cont d)
                It was nice to meet you properly. 
                  Thank you for your time.

She exits through the back door, the way she came in.

Zoe bolts and double-locks the door. Her hand is shaking. It 
takes three attempts. 

Then she turns to face Mark. Embraces him. Mark is still in 
shock. But he embraces her in return.


Luther speeds through London - focused on the task ahead.


Reed and Ripley exit Teller s office, stride through the unit.

                                    REED
                He seriously told you nothing?

                                    RIPLEY
                He seriously told me nothing.

                                    REED
                  Seriously?

                                    RIPLEY
                  Seriously.

                                    REED
                  Shit.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 48.


Ripley stops. Looks round himself, as if for some lost piece of 
  potentially useful equipment - or a door to leave through.

But he s interrupted by a A SLIGHTLY CONFUSED OFFICER who hands 
him a POLICE RADIO. Ripley frowns. Why are you giving me this?
Then hears:

                                    LUTHER (ON RADIO)
                  Detective Chief Inspector John Luther 
                to Control, over.   

Reed sprints to Teller s office.

                                    REED
                  Boss!

Teller rushes in. Listens, incredulous, to the police radio.

                                    LUTHER (ON RADIO)
                  Detective Chief Inspector John Luther 
                to Control, over.  

Teller snatches the radio from Ripley s hand.


Owen hears a NEWLY FAMILIAR VOICE on the STOLEN POLICE RADIO.

                                    LUTHER (ON RADIO)
                  Detective Chief Inspector John Luther 
                to Control, over. 

He snatches up the radio. Listens. 


Owen is listening.

                                    TELLER
                        (on radio, to Luther)
                  This is now a matter for 
                  antiterrorism. Do NOT proceed, repeat 
                do not proceed to the Kings Hill 
                  Estate. 

                                    LUTHER (ON RADIO)
                  Negative on that. I m three, repeat 
                  three minutes away, over. 

                                    OWEN
                  Right.

Face twisted with hate, he checks the breach on the assault 
rifle.


Teller, Ripley and Reed - 

                                    TELLER
                We cannot provide armed backup, over. 
                We are unable to provide backup. Do 
                you read?

Silence on the line. She TURNS TO REED.

                                    TELLER(cont d)
                        (low)
                Get CO19 out there.

Reed snatches up a phone.

                                    REED
                  This is DCIReed, we need a fast 
                  response Tactical Unit to the Kings 
                  Hill Estate... it s Owen Lynch... 
                  WE VE GOT AN UNARMED, UNASSISTED 
                  OFFICER GOING IN THERE. SO DO IT NOW!

As Reed SHOUTS, Teller turns to Ripley.

                                    TELLER
                He wanted to guarantee that Owen Lynch 
                  heard him when he made that call. He 
                  brought me Gorman and Eppley sradios 
                so I d warn Anti-Terrorism and they d 
                  shut down their comms. We cleared the 
                  airwaves for him!         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 50.


                                    RIPLEY
                  I realisethat now, Ma am, yes.

  INTERCUT with Luther walking into - the profound, sombre 
shadows of that VAST, DESERTED HIGH RISE HOUSING ESTATE. 

                                    TELLER
                  He s made Lynch hate him -

                                    RIPLEY
                  - it s like he s waving a white flag, 
                  before stepping onto enemy territory.  
                  Almost as if he s gone there to -

                                    TELLER
                  What?!

                                    REED
                  Boss?

                                    TELLER
                  What?

                                    REED
                  I found him on the roof this morning. 
                  Right on the edge.

                                    TELLER
                So?

                                    REED
                I m not completely sure he expects to 
                  walk away from this.

                                    TELLER
                  CO19?

                                    REED
                ETA thirteen minutes.

                                    TELLER
                  That s not quick enough. He s dead. 
                The bloody idiot. He s dead.


Luther scuttles to the corner - bleeding and scared - 

Owen slings the rifle over his shoulder. Advances with the 
  revolver.

                                    LUTHER
                  Terry gave you up, Owen.

                                    OWEN
                  Shut up.

                                    LUTHER
                  I threatened him and he cried like a 
                  girl. He sobbed and begged me not to 
                  hurt him. And he gave you up. Just 
                  like that. He gave you up.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 53.


                                    OWEN
                  Liar.

                                    LUTHER
                No, you re right. I m a liar. He 
                  didn t cry, he didn t sob. I was 
                  saying that to make you feel better. 
                He just gave you up because he was 
                  frightened.

A hurt beat - as that strikes home. Followed by angry resolve.

                                    LUTHER(cont d)
                  Come on. How d youthink I found you? 
                  This was a special place. Yours and 
                  his. Who else would know you were 
                  here?

                                    OWEN
                  Liar.

                                    LUTHER
                You didn t want to be a soldier. You 
                wet your bed until you were eleven. He 
                  used to hit you for it. The more he 
                hit you, the more you wet your bed. 
                You were scared of the dark. Scared of 
                the monster under your bed. Scared of 
                  Terry.

                                    OWEN
                  SHUT UP! 

Owen advances, bearing down with the gun - 

                                    OWEN(cont d)
                GET DOWN! DOWN! ON YOUR FACE! DOWN!

Grabs Luther by the collar.

                                    OWEN(cont d)
                On your knees.

                                    LUTHER
                No.

                                    OWEN
                ON YOUR KNEES! ON YOUR KNEES! GET ON 
                  YOUR KNEES!

Owen shoves Luther to his knees - puts the gun to the base of 
his skull. 

                                    LUTHER
                  I told him he was killing you. Know 
                  what he said? 

                                    OWEN
                  Shut it.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 54.


                                    LUTHER
                 At least he ll die doing something he 
                  loves . 

Beat.

                                    LUTHER (cont d)
                You recognise that? Heard him say it 
                  before?

Owen bellows with rage, drags Luther to his feet, slams him 
into the wall. Presses the barrel of the revolver to his head. 

Glares unblinking into Luther s eyes.

                                    LUTHER(cont d)
                  You re an embarrassment to him.

                                    OWEN
                  SHUT UP!
                        (strikeshim)
                  SHUT! UP!!

                                    LUTHER
                  He s ashamed of you. He asked you to 
                do one thing - ONE THING! And you 
                  couldn t do that right - 

                                    OWEN
                  SHUT UP!!

                                    LUTHER
                He surrendered all your secrets. 
                  Anything he thought I could use to 
                  humiliate you. Like the fact that when 
                you came home, you started wetting the 
                bed again. He laughed when he told me 
                  that. 

Owen LAUGHS TOO - IN PAIN - digs the gun into Luther s head.

                                    LUTHER(cont d)
                  That s why I m here. To tell you what 
                  kind of man he is. Don t die for him, 
                  Owen. Not for him. 

                                    OWEN
                  SHUT UP! 

Owen stands there. Lost. Hand shaking.

                                    OWEN(cont d)
                  God, what do I do?

                                    LUTHER
                  Come with me.        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 55.


                                    OWEN
                My dad killed one copper. Look what 
                  they did to him.

                                    LUTHER
                  You re not your dad.

                                    OWEN
                No, I m not.

He grins - savage - mad. Flips opens the cylinder - removes 
five bullets - leaving one - 

                                    OWEN(cont d)
                  Ever get the feeling you ve been 
                  cheated?

- he shuts the cylinder - spins it - DIGS THE BARREL INTO 
  LUTHER S HEAD- 

ANGLE on the GUN MECHANISM as OWEN PULLS THE TRIGGER: THE 
HAMMER PULLS BACK - SPRINGS FORWARD - STRIKES THE CYLINDER.

Click. 

Luther laughs. Half disappointed. 

Owen PUNCHES him. Laughs, fierce and mad. Then - abruptly - 

- puts the gun to his OWN HEAD and pulls the trigger. 

Click.

He laughs again, half disappointed - shoves Luther hard into 
the wall - puts the pistol to Luther s head. 

Pulls the trigger - Click- 

- then turns the gun on himself, pulls the trigger. 

Click.

                                    LUTHER
                  Four down. Two to go. Come on, Owen. 
                  Hurry up. Come on.

Owen puts the gun to Luther s head - more slowly now - long eye 
contact between them. 

Owen s FINGER SQUEEZES THE TRIGGER - THE HAMMER PULLS BACK - 
STRIKES THE CYLINDER - 

  Luther s eyes close -

Click.

Last bullet.

Owen puts the pistol to his own head, squeezes the trigger -        LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 56.


Luther CRIES OUT - produces his POLICE BATON - strikes at 
Owen s wrist - misses -

Owen steps back -turns the gun on Luther - point blank -

Luther steps into him - HEADBUTTShim - then steps back, 
  bringing up the baton in a WIDE CURVE, SMASHING it into OWEN S 
JAW. 

Owen spins - Luther strikes him hard on the BACK OF THE NECK.

Owen falls. Luther strikes him ONCE MORE- kicks the gun away -
pins Owen to the floor with one foot.

                                    LUTHER(cont d)
                  DON T MOVE!

With one hand, he produces some PLASTIC HANDCUFFS. Cuffs Owen.

                                    LUTHER(cont d)
                  You re okay. You re okay. You re okay. 

                                                                              FADE TO:


Teller and Reed are with Owen Lynch and his SOLICITOR. Owen is 
dressed in the blue police issue coverall. Hair slicked back 
post shower.

                                    REED
                All right, Owen. I know you re scared. 
                  I know that right now, you feel you re 
                in enemy territory. But that s not how 
                it is. You re protected by the law. 
                  Nobody s going to hurt you. You need 
                to understand that we re not your 
                  enemy.

  Silence. Owen flexes his jaw. Stares directly ahead. Teller and 
Reed exchange a glance.

                                    TELLER
                We know that you re not responsible 
                for what you did. Not really. I d like

                  Owen, as far as we re concerned, the 
                  ultimate responsibility for the death 
                of these officers lies with your dad. 
                And it s your dad we want.         LUTHER by NEIL CROSS Episode 2Page 57.


                But we need your help to do that. If 
                  we re going to punish this man for 
                  what he did to you, we need your help.

Angle on Owen s extreme internal conflict - his desire to 
assist, his fear... 

An agonising beat as Teller and Reed wait. Trying not to show 
their tension. But they almost jump when Owen opens his mouth - 

                                    OWEN
