INT. SPANISH CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS22

The STUDY GROUP listens as SR. CHANG addresses the class.

SR. CHANG
As you know, faculty at Greendale 
are required to give extra credit 
to students who organize class-
related events during what would 
otherwise be our...
(air quotes)
Free time.
(then)
No student in any department has 
ever exercised this option... until 
now.

Annie turns and gives everyone an enthusiastic wave.  

ANNIE
Tonight, in the library, I will be 
hosting a Dia de Los Muertos party.  
Dia de Los Muertos, or Day of the 
Dead, is sometimes referred to as 
Mexican Halloween, -- 

CHANG
A name quite offensive to people 
familiar with  Mexican Halloween  
as a sexual position.  At any rate, 
if you show up, you get extra 
credit.  Me, I don t even get paid.  
See you tonight.

Chang shuffles out.  People start to leave.

ANNIE
Um, most of you have responded to 
my E-vite, but some of you 
remain... E-Vasive, so..."Community" - #106 - "Introduction to Statistics" - Pink Revised  9/07/09  2.

My husband s been gone for six

JEFF
Okay, good, because one of my 
professors is really hot but I

Are you popular?!

JEFF (CONT D)*
Wait.  I need to be with you *
tonight.  And it s not about the *
sex, or about the taunting I may *

talk, watch a movie, cuddle, do *
that  Ghost  thing where we almost *
touch and that makes it hotter...*

If we re doing this there s going *
to be sex.*

EXT. LIBRARY - A FEW MINUTES LATER1717

Jeff heads with Professor Slater towards her car, his arm *
around her.  They pass our group and various lame party-goers *
are standing outside the doors, looking through the windows 
with concern.

TROY
Pierce, it s okay! Come out of *
there!*

TIGHT On Pierce in the classroom peering through some kind of *
desk fortress.*

PIERCE *
You re not getting me yet!  I m not *
ready to die!

JEFF
(to self)
Keep walking.  They can handle 
this.

TROY
There s no reason to fear death!  *
You ve lived a decent, moral life!  *
You re going to go to heaven, *
right?!*

PIERCE
(blood curdling)
Ahhhhhh!

Jeff reluctantly stops.  Britta notices a guy in a grim 
reeper outfit peering at Pierce through the window.  She 
pulls him away.

BRITTA
Dude.  Not helping.

TROY
(noticing Jeff)
Jeff, he s freaking out.  You re 
the only one who can help.

JEFF
What makes you think that?"Community" - #106 - "Introduction to Statistics" - Pink Revised  9/07/09  21.

PIERCE (O.S.)*
Is Jeff out there?!  He s the only

JEFF*
(to Prof. Slater)*
I can t believe I m doing this, but *
I think I have to say good night.*

PROFESSOR SLATER*
So, you re saying you d rather stay *
here with them than spend the night *
with me?*
(checking)*
Are you like a court appointed *
guardian for these people? *

JEFF
No.  They re my... Classmates.*

PROFESSOR SLATER
Good night, Jeff.*

She kisses him on the cheek and EXITS.  Jeff stares at the *
Comfort Inn Platinum card wistfully.  He heads in.  Chang *
mopeds by holding up an  L  on his helmet.*

INT. STUDY ROOM - LATER1818

Jeff enters to find Pierce has built a giant, precarious 
fortress incorporating props from the study room and party.

JEFF
What in the Pink Floyd?  Pierce. *
Come out of there. *

PIERCE
No. *

Jeff sighs, gets on his hands and knees and crawls into the *
fort.  He sits next to Pierce cross-legged on the floor.  A 
quiet beat.

(CONT D) PIERCE
 Jeff. old, I m*

JEFF
 not. you re No,*

PIERCE
People see me as youthful, fun *

away on a golf course or a cruise.  *
But you re here where the action *
is.  I hope I m half as young as *
you when I m your age.*

PIERCE
Yeah? *

JEFF
Dude.  You re the Beastmaster. *

PIERCE
 Beastmaster. the I m*

Pierce pumps a fist, accidentally knocking out a load bearing *
desk.  The fortress shudders and sways.  Pierce and Jeff 
react as it starts to collapse on them.  Suddenly, we see a 
caped, dark figure whoosh by.  As the fortress comes down we 
see Abed, as Batman, heroically pulling Jeff and Pierce to 
safety.  The dust settles and Abed runs off. *

JEFF
Who was that man? *

assembled in the room and are watching from a safe distance.  *
