      Dave walks with ANNA SOFIA ANTONIA GARC S-KELLER (42, chic)
      as she heads to her airport limo.  Dave carries her bags.

                                    DAVE
                    We need serious damage control.

                                      TONIA
                    David...

                                    DAVE
                    I'm really worried about the kids. 
                    Did you know that Ronnie doesn't
                    have a bedtime?

                                      TONIA
                    She has a bedtime.

                                    DAVE
                    Which is..?

                                      TONIA
                    When she goes to bed.
                          (reality check)
                    Honey, I know we have not been around. 
                    But it's not like they've been raised
                    by wolves... they've been raised by
                    absentee wolves.  Okay, wolves away
                    on business trips.
                          (off Dave's panic)
                    I'm sure you can handle it.

      They kiss.  Tonia's limo pulls away.

      OFF Dave waving, concerned --

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      ELI THE HERMIT (now 35, long dirty hair, a toothless wonder)
      pushes along his shopping cart of recyclables.

      Dakota Toyota (now 35, cardigan) is shocked at Eli's state.

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    Eli?  Eli Keller?
                          (off Eli's confusion)
                    When you stopped text messaging,
                    they said you died.

      Eli the Hermit experiences a moment of lucidity.

                                    ELI THE HERMIT
                    Dakota?  Dakota Toyota?  Without
                    wireless, I've been so alone.  Do
                    you... want to read my manifesto?      FAMILY BIZ:      DAMAGE CONTROL               20  May 08             18.
  

      Eli thrusts a ream of crumpled paper into Dakota's hands.

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    This isn't even typed, Dude.

                                    ELI
                    Yeah, I can't even read it myself
                    any more.

                                                                                FLASH TO:


      Avalon is in front of the house.  Eli trots down the walk.

                                    ELI
                    All clear!

                                      AVALON
                    It worked?

                                    ELI
                    Sound check's at three.

      YELLOW STAYNE'S EMO PUNK ANTHEM "In the Ghetto" (by Trip the
      Off) PLAYS over the action.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Dave and two CORPORATE EXECUTIVES stride up the street on
      the way to work.  Dave takes a deep breath.  This is it.  A
      new start.

      Dave slows.  Stops.  Considers his options and...

      Dave swerves off the sidewalk and into...


      Nowhere to go, Dave approaches an OLD MAN sitting at a chess
      table.

                                    OLD MAN
                    Five bucks a game - no credit.

      The Old Man takes out a chess clock.

      Dave takes off his jacket, takes his seat.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Eli waves in a huge EQUIPMENT TRUCK.

                                                                        JUMP CUTS TO:

      ROADIES jump out the parked truck.  Unload equipment.  Haul
      cables through the front door.

      A SECOND TRUCK backs in.  BEEPS as it goes.

      Mick Yellow and Simon Stayne step out from their limo.  As
      Mick Yellow surveys the house -

                                    MICK YELLOW
                    Well it's small...but authentic.

                                    MICK YELLOW (CONT'D)
                          (nostalgic)
                    Reminds of playing the Rock Cave.
                    That first gig... the smell and spit
                    of the crowd pressed against the
                    stage... the human connection...
                          (beat)
                    Rock and roll!

      MUSIC CONTINUES OVER -

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Dave plays chess with the Old Man. 

      In the background a PALE BOY in a hoodie, carrying a hockey
      stick like a scythe, watches the action.

                                    OLD MAN
                    You some sort of businessman?

      The Pale Boy heads closer for a better vantage point.

      Dave stares at him, Dad-like. 

                                    DAVE
                    I'm working it out. 
                          (to the Boy)
                    Shouldn't you be in school?  Or doing
                    something useful with your life?

                                    OLD MAN
                          (to Dave)
                    Shouldn't you?  Business.  Who needs
                    business?  It's all about...

                                    DAVE
                    Family.

                                    OLD MAN
                    No.  Chess.  Checkmate.  Pay.

      OFF Dave considering things -

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Ronnie hangs with Avalon.  Avalon puts a positive spin on
      events.

                                      AVALON
                    Best party ever.  Except for how it
                    ended of course.

                                      RONNIE
                    It was okay. But next time get loot
                    bags.

      OFF Avalon's smile -
