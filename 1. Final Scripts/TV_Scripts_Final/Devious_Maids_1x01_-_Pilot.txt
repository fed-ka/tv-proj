We OPEN on an elegant party in full swing. 

Stylish guests mill about, laughing and talking. A rock band 
plays music. Cater waiters walk around a LIT SWIMMING POOL 
with trays in their hands. Everyone is having a blast.

We then PUSH IN to see two shadowy figures in a window.

EVELYN (CONT D)
You spend your lives scrubbing and 
disinfecting the homes of silly rich 
people. All the while knowing we re 
no better than you. You take care of 
us and make our shallow, carefree 
lives possible. But you never seem to 
complain. Even though, at times, you 
must be desperately unhappy.

ACT ONE

FADE IN:

 MANSION - STREET - DAYEXT. ADRIAN POWELL S

A crowd is gathered outside the home. Various onlookers and 
paparazzi stand behind yellow crime scene tape watching as 
dozens of cops enter and exit the mansion. 

A reporter stands off to the side, talking into a camera.

REPORTER
... the victim was a domestic 
worker employed by renowned fashion 
designer, Adrian Powell. While 
police now have a suspect in 
custody, a motive for the stabbing 
remains unclear... 

As the reporting continues, we PAN to REVEAL four women of 
Latin descent, standing apart from the crowd, watching.

They are ROSIE FALTA, 35, SWEET and VULNERABLE, CARMEN VERDE, 
30, SEXY and AMBITIOUS, ZOILA DEL BARRIO, 44, TOUGH and SLY 
and VALENTINA DEL BARRIO, 18, BEAUTIFUL and SHY. 

They watch in silence for a beat. Then:

this would happen.

 family was poor. They couldn t

ZOILA

in Van Nuys, you think this many 
cops would show up to find out why?

Zoila gestures to the crowd of reporters and police swirling 
about. The women nod grimly in agreement.

FROM A DISTANCE we see the four women as they continue to 
stare at the crime scene.

REVEAL they are being watched by MARISOL, 39, INTELLIGENT and 
DIGNIFIED. She is clearly intrigued by the quartet. Her eyes 
narrow with a determination as she watches them.
