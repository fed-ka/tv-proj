Valjean stands waiting. The officer fastidiously writes down
the name of Valjean in his huge ledger and the name of the
town in his passport. The officer signs and stamps the
passport.
OFFICER
Valjean.
The officer hands back the passport. Valjean leaves.

Valjean sits in the corner, his hat low over his head. He
eyes hungrily a group of cart drivers tucking into a roast
meal by a roaring fire place. The innkeeper serves him a
beer. As he reaches for it his coat sleeve rides up to
reveal his wrist, calloused and scarred by manacles. The
innkeeper eyes him warily. He discusses Valjean with two
other men, then asks for his paper. Sees the phrase
"Extremely Dangerous".
VALJEAN'S POV - From the yellow paper in the innkeeper's
hands up to the innkeeper's face. A blank stare, a shrug of
refusal.
INNKEEPER
My inn is full.
7A
10
A simple table on which is laid out bread and wine, with
silver cutlery. Two silver candlesticks light the room,
illuminating walls painted with religious scenes. The Bishop
ushers the bewildered Valjean into the room. The bishop's
sister Madame Baptistine stands. Valjean hesitates.
BISHOP
There is wine here to revive you.
There is bread to make you
strong.
There's a bed to rest till
morning -
Rest from pain, and rest from
wrong.
BISHOP
Sit, my brother.
The Bishop gestures to the housekeeper Madame Magloire.
BISHOP
Madame, set one more place.
(to Valjean)
Please sit.
The Bishop gently takes his arm and draws him into a chair.
Valjean sits, and the Housekeeper lays food before him.
Famished, Valjean eats like an animal. The Bishop says a
short grace.
BISHOP
May the Lord bless the food we eat
today. Bless our dear sister and
our honoured guest.
(To Valjean)
Please, eat. Where are you
travelling to my brother?
VALJEAN
Pontarlier.
BISHOP
Is that where your family is?
VALJEAN
No. The destination is compulsory.
That is where the Law sends me. I
have no home.
BISHOP
Then let this be your home, for
as long as you need it.

The Bishop leads Valjean to a bedroom where the walls are
also painted with religious imagery. Across the passage,
Valjean sees the open door to the Bishop's own bedroom.
There the Housekeeper is putting the table silver away in a
cupboard.
He turns to see a bed made up with clean white linen
waiting for him. He hasn't slept in such a bed ever in his
life. But the Bishop is smiling, offering it to him.
BISHOP
Sleep well. Tomorrow morning
before you leave you will have a
cup of milk from our cows, nice
and hot.
The Bishop turns away to go to sleep.
VALJEAN
You let me sleep here next to you?
How do you know I'm not a murderer?
Valjean laughs a strange laugh.
BISHOP
God will take care of that.
LATER THAT NIGHT -
Valjean lies on the bed, fully dressed, deeply asleep.
Outside a dog barks.
Valjean's eyes snap open. The first thing he sees by the
light of the moon is an image of God the Father gazing down
on him from the painted ceiling. In panic, fearing
judgement, he sits bolt upright. Then he looks round, and
remembers. He gets out of bed, and opens the door.
There, across the narrow passage, the door stands open to
the Bishop's bedroom. In the moonlight, he sees the Bishop
lying asleep. Above his bed, the cupboard where the silver
is kept.
Valjean moves silently into the Bishop's room, holding a
metal miner's spike which he pulls from his bag. The floor
boards creak. He looks down at the old man, holding his
breath, but the bishop is peacefully and innocently asleep.
He reaches up to the cupboard. It is unlocked. The cupboard
door opens with a sharp cracking sound. The Bishop,
disturbed in his sleep, moves a little. At once Valjean is
over him, like a wild animal, spike raised to strike should
he wake. The Bishop sleeps on. The moon comes out and
lights up his beautific, smiling face. Valjean is thrown.
He turns back and opens the cupboard door fully: there is
the silver.
10.
Carefully he picks it out, fearful of every clink. One last
look at the sleeping old man, and he makes a run for the
door.
12
13
The Bishop is coming in from morning Mass in his vestments
when the door bursts open and two policemen drag Valjean
before him. Valjean hangs his head, unable to meet the
Bishop's eyes.
CONSTABLE
Monsignor, we caught the thief
red-handed! He has the nerve to
say you gave him all this!
He upends Valjean's kitbag, and the silver tumbles out.
The Bishop looks from the silver to Valjean.
BISHOP
That is right.
Amazed, Valjean looks up.
BISHOP
But my friend, you left so early,
You forgot I gave these also.
Would you leave the best behind?
The old Bishop is holding out the two silver candlesticks.
BISHOP
(to policemen)
Messieurs, release him.
For this man has spoken true.
I commend you for your duty
Now God's blessing go with you.
Silenced by the Bishop's gentle tones, the policemen turn
and leave.
Valjean, utterly bewildered, takes the silver candlesticks.
BISHOP
But remember this, my brother -
See in this some higher plan.
You must use this precious silver
To become an honest man.
By the witness of the martyrs,
(more)
11.
BISHOP (cont'd)
By the passion and the blood,
God has raised you out of
darkness -
I have bought your soul for God.
14

Valjean kneels in the church.
He takes out his yellow passport and stares at it.
He turns towards the altar, and the crucifix above it.
VALJEAN
What have I done?
Sweet Jesus, what have I done?
Become a thief in the night
Become a dog on the run!
And have I fallen so far
And is the hour so late
That nothing remains but the cry
of my hate?
The cries in the dark that nobody
hears
Here where I stand at the turning
of the years.
If there's another way to go
I missed it twenty long years
ago.
My life was a war that could
never be won.
They gave me a number and
murdered Valjean
When they chained me and left me
for dead
Just for stealing a mouthful of
bread!
Yet why did I allow this man
To touch my soul and teach me
love?
He treated me like any other
He gave me his trust
He called me brother.
My life he claims for God
above...
Can such things be?
For I had come to hate the world -
This world that always hated me!
Take an eye for an eye!
Turn your heart into stone!
This is all I have lived for!
This is all I have known!
One word from him and I'd be back
Beneath the lash, upon the rack.
Instead he offers me my freedom!
(more)
12.
VALJEAN (cont'd)
I feel my shame inside me like a
knife.
He told me that I have a soul...
How does he know?
What spirit comes to move my
life?
Is there another way to go?
Slowly, he examines the yellow passport and raises it high,
as if to the altar.
VALJEAN
I am reaching, but I fall
And the night is closing in...
As I stare into the void -
To the whirlpool of my sin.
Valjean stands and turns, walking fast to the door of the
church.
VALJEAN
I'll escape now from that world -
From the world of Jean Valjean.
Jean Valjean is nothing now!

19A
The foreman passes men packing boxes on tables and loading
boxes onto crates. He passes through a door under a first
floor office.
20-22
20-22
The long work space is full of tables at which
conservatively dressed women are working, making jewelry
out of shellac, a black resin which looks like jet. An
impressive sight: obviously a very successful business. A
wooden staircase climbs one wall to a glass-windowed
business office. The figure of a man within.
FOREMAN
(flirtatiously, to women)
At the end of the day you get
nothing for nothing!
Sitting flat on your bum doesn't
buy any bread!
FACTORY WOMAN 4
There are children back at home -
FACTORY WOMAN 2
And the children have got to be
fed.
15.
FACTORY WOMAN 7
And you're lucky to be in a job -
The Foreman has stopped beside FANTINE, a pretty young woman.
As he leans over to whisper in her ear Fantine, surprised,
pricks her finger with her needle.
FOREMAN
(quietly, to Fantine)
And in a bed!
FACTORY WOMAN 8
(to Fantine, as a warning)
And we're counting our blessings!
The Foreman continues his rounds, encouraging the women to
speed up their work.
FOREMAN
At the end of the day just be glad
to be working
For a master who cares for the
lives of the poor.
FACTORY WOMAN 7
He's a riddle..
FACTORY WOMAN 4
He's no fool..
FACTORY WOMAN 6
He's the answer to anyone's prayer
FACTORY WOMAN 8
And he paid for the brand new
school
FACTORY WOMAN 4
It's no wonder they made him the
mayor!
FACTORY WOMEN
Bless the man who leads the way!
At the end of the day!
They get on with their tasks, all glancing up at the boss in
the office above.
The Foreman returns to Fantine, trying to help her.
MAIN FACTORY WOMAN
Have you seen how the foreman is
fuming today
With his terrible breath and his
wandering hands?
16.
FACTORY WOMAN 3
It's because little Fantine won't
give him his way.
FACTORY WOMAN 5
Take a look at his trousers,
you'll see where he stands!
FACTORY WOMAN 2
And the boss, he never knows
That the foreman is always on
heat.
MAIN FACTORY WOMAN
If Fantine doesn't look out,
Watch how she goes,
She'll be out on the street!
The Foreman rings a bell, announcing the end of the work day.
The women start to take off their overalls and pack up their
tools for the day.
FACTORY WOMEN/FOREMAN
At the end of the day its another
day over
With enough in your pocket to last
for a week
Pay the landlord, pay the shop
Keep on working as long as you're
able
Keep on working till you drop
Or it's back to the crumbs off the
table
Well, you've got to pay your way
At the end of the day!
The women queue up to be paid by the Foreman at the door.
Fantine has taken out a letter. The main factory woman
snatches the letter away from Fantine.
MAIN FACTORY WOMAN
And what have we here, little
innocent sister?
The letter is passed surreptitiously down the line of women
workers.
MAIN FACTORY WOMAN
Come on, Fantine, let's have all
the news.
(reading)
`Dear Fantine, you must send us
more money,
Your child needs a doctor,
There's no time to lose.'
17.
FANTINE
Give that letter to me
It is none of your business.
With a husband at home
And a bit on the side!
Is there anyone here
Who can swear before God
She has nothing to fear?
She has nothing to hide?
The main factory woman starts to take Fantine's letter over
to the Foreman.
Fantine tries to get the letter back. The women scuffle.
The owner enters the factory floor. We see him only from
behind: a well-dressed prosperous man.
VALJEAN
What is this fighting all about?
Will someone tear these two
apart?
This is a factory, not a circus.
As he sings, the CAMERA MOVES ROUND to discover him. Clean-
shaven, well-fed, transformed: it's Valjean.
VALJEAN
Now come on, ladies, settle down.
I run a business of repute.
Suddenly Valjean sees Javert appear on the first floor
balcony of his office. His world drops away.
VALJEAN
(to the foreman)
Deal with this, Foreman.
Be as patient as you can.
He walks back to the stairs up to his office.
On the factory floor -
FOREMAN
Now someone say how this began!
The factory women all turn on Fantine.
FANTINE/FACTORY WOMAN 5
At the end of the day she's the
one who began it!
MAIN FACTORY WOMAN
There's a kid that she's hiding
in some little town.
FACTORY WOMAN 5
There's a man she has to pay
18.
MAIN FACTORY WOMAN
You can guess how she picks up
the extra -
You can bet she's earning her
keep
Sleeping around!
And the boss wouldn't like it.
FANTINE
Yes, it's true there's a child
And the child is my daughter
And her father abandoned us,
Leaving us flat.
Now she lives with an innkeeper
man and his wife
And I pay for the child.
What's the matter with that?
Fantine continues to defend herself to the Foreman, as the
women sing -
FACTORY WOMEN
At the end of the day she'll be
nothing but trouble
And there's trouble for all when
there's trouble for one!
While we're earning our daily
bread
She's the one with her hands in
the butter -
You must send the slut away
Or we're all going to end in the
gutter
And it's us who'll have to pay
At the end of the day!
The Foreman pulls Fantine away.
FOREMAN
I might have known the bitch
could bite!
I might have known the cat had
claws!
I might have guessed your little
secret!
Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine
Who keeps herself so pure and
clean -
You'd be the cause, I had no
doubt
Of any trouble hereabout.
You play a virgin in the light
But need no urging in the night!
MAIN FACTORY WOMAN
She's been laughing at you
While she's having her men!
19.
FACTORY WOMEN
She'll be nothing but trouble
again and again!
FACTORY WOMAN 5
You must sack her today!
FACTORY WOMEN
Sack the girl today!
FOREMAN
Right, my girl! On your way!
Below, Fantine turns and calls to Valjean in his office
above with a pitiful cry.
FANTINE
M'sieur Mayor, help me! I have a
child!
Valjean hears the cry, but he has other concerns. He turns
round to face Javert.
Javert stares at him.
On the factory floor below, the Foreman hustles Fantine
out, as she struggles against him.
23
23
Javert bows.
JAVERT
I introduce myself,
Inspector of Police.
I've come to take the watch
I'm here to keep the peace.
Please know me as Javert.
I'm here at your command
With honour due to each.
With justice in our hands
No man's beyond our reach.
Let all beware.
VALJEAN
Welcome, sir
Come guard our laws
I'm sure we're here
In common cause.
Javert turns to look through the high window onto the men's
factory floor below. The last men are leaving for the day.
JAVERT
You've done the city proud,
You've raised their banner high.
(more)
20.
JAVERT (cont'd)
You manufacture gems
That anyone can buy
Your people thrive.
Valjean shows some demonstration samples of their work.
VALJEAN
The dignity of toil
To stay alive.
Javert is puzzled. He's sure he recognises Valjean, but
from where?
JAVERT
It seems to me
We may have met.
Valjean throws him a sharp glance.
VALJEAN
Your face is not a face
I would forget.
A CRASH from outside in the yard - shouts -
24
27
Fantine, pale and frail, her bodice loosened, leads the
captain down to the damp dregs of the ship.
We see the rotting straw mattress within as they enter,
then Fantine lays down.
FANTINE
Easy money lying on a bed.
Just as well they never see
The hate that's in your head!
Don't they know they're making love
To one already dead?
28
28
CLOSE ON a man's hand leaving money. We hear him exit. MOVE
TO FIND Fantine lying alone on the mattress.
She pulls herself into a sitting position against the head
of the mattress. She draws her legs up and wraps her arms
round her knees, huddling against the misery of the world.
FANTINE
There was a time when men were
kind,
When their voices were soft
And their words inviting.
There was a time when love was
blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting.
There was a time...
Then it all went wrong.
I dreamed a dream in time gone
by,
When hope was high
And life worth living.
I dreamed that love would never
die.
I dreamed that God would be
forgiving.
(more)
29.
FANTINE (cont'd)
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and
wasted.
There was no ransom to be paid,
No song unsung, no wine untasted.
But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame.
He slept a summer by my side,
He filled my days with endless
wonder.
He took my childhood in his
stride
But he was gone when autumn came.
And still I dream he'll come to
me!
That we will live the years
together...
But there are dreams that cannot
be
And there are storms we cannot
weather...
I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm
living -
So different now from what it
seemed!
Now life has killed the dream I
dreamed.
As she ends her song, her next customer is waiting. The head
whore beyond.
29
31
Valjean is at his desk in his office, going through his
papers once everyone else has gone, when Javert enters and
stands before him. He looks up.
JAVERT
Monsieur le Mayor
I have a crime to declare!
I have disgraced
The uniform that I wear.
I've done you wrong,
Let no forgiveness be shown.
I've been as hard
On every rogue I have known.
I'll bear the blame,
I must be treated
Just the same.
VALJEAN
I don't understand.
What is this crime, Javert?
JAVERT
I mistook you for a convict,
I have made a false report.
Now I learn they've caught the
culprit -
He's about to face the court.
Valjean conceals his shock.
JAVERT
And of course the thief denies
it,
You'd expect that from a con.
But he couldn't run for ever,
No, not even Jean Valjean.
VALJEAN
You say this man denies it all,
And gives no sign of
understanding or repentance?
You say this man is going to
trial,
And that he's sure to be returned
to serve his sentence?
JAVERT
He will pay, and so must I.
Press charges against me, sir!
VALJEAN
You have only done your duty
It's a minor sin at most.
All of us have been mistaken
You'll return, sir, to your post.
35.
JAVERT
Must I do as you say?
VALJEAN
It's your duty to obey!
Javert is about to protest again, but Valjean raises one
commanding hand, to indicate his decision is made. Javert
gives an abrupt bow, and departs.
Left alone, Valjean paces his office, deeply disturbed.
VALJEAN
They think that man is me -
Without a second glance.
This stranger they have found -
This man could be my chance!
Why should I save his hide?
Why should I right this wrong?
When I have come so far
And struggled for so long?
If I speak I am condemned.
If I stay silent, I am damned!
He goes out onto the balcony that looks down on the empty
factory.
VALJEAN
I am the master of hundreds of
workers -
They all look to me.
Can I abandon them?
How would they live
If I am not free?
If I speak they are condemned.
If I stay silent, I am damned!
31A
31A
Valjean is sitting staring at the Bishop's candlesticks.
Who am I?
Can I condemn this man to
slavery?
Pretend I do not feel his agony?
This innocent who bears my face,
Who goes to judgement in my
place...
Who am I?
31B
31B
Valjean is furiously packing stuff up.
36.
VALJEAN
Can I conceal myself for ever
more?
Pretend I'm not the man I was
before?
And must my name until I die
Be no more than an alibi?
31C
31D
Valjean hesitates outside the courtroom and in the lobby of
the courtroom, pacing back and forth.
VALJEAN
My soul belongs to God, I know,
I made that bargain long ago.
He gave me hope when hope was
gone!
He gave me strength to journey
on!
Who am I?
Who am I?
I'm Jean Valjean!
Valjean pushes through the crowds at the back of the
courtroom.
32
32
The man accused of being Jean Valjean, a wretched down-and-
out, stands before the JUDGE. He looks uncannily like the
real Valjean. Before the judge has a chance to speak, the
doors open and Valjean bursts in. Sensation in the court.
VALJEAN
And so, your honour, you see it's
true
That man bears no more guilt than
you!
Who am I?
24601!
37.
The judge is too stunned to respond. The others in the
court can't believe what they've just heard. The Mayor of
Montreuil-sur-Mer, a convict!
VALJEAN
If you don't believe me ask
Inspector Javert. He knows where to
find me.
The judge goes over to Valjean and gently leads him out.
JUDGE
Monsieur le Mayor, you are not
well, you must come with me, do you
have a carriage outside? Monsieur
le Mayor, we must get you home to
bed immediately!!
33
33
The hospital is in the long attic of Valjean's factory.
Valjean hurries into the hospital, breathless. He sees a
nursing sister outside Fantine's room.
VALJEAN
Is her daughter with her?
NURSE
No, monsieur. Her guardian sent
this.
She gives Valjean a note. He reads it with mounting anger.
VALJEAN
`Money not enough. Send more.
Thenardier.' What sort of man is
this?
34
34
Fantine lies in bed, delirious. She is dressed in pure
white. Her eyes are closed.
FANTINE
Cosette, it's turned so cold!
Cosette, it's past your bedtime!
You've played the day away
And soon it will be night.
Fantine's eyes open and she sees Cosette, playing in the
room. She looks healthy and is dressed prettily.
Come to me, Cosette, the light is
fading.
(more)
38.
FANTINE (cont'd)
Don't you see, the evening star
appearing?
Come to me, and rest against my
shoulder,
How fast the minutes fly away and
every minute colder?
Valjean enters, and sees at once that Fantine is close to
the end. He drops to his knees by her bed.
VALJEAN
Dear Fantine, Cosette will be
here soon!
Dear Fantine, she will be by your
side
FANTINE
(trying to get out of bed)
Come Cosette, the night has grown
so cold!
VALJEAN
(putting her back in bed)
Be at peace! Be at peace ever
more.
FANTINE
My Cosette -
VALJEAN
- shall live in my protection.
FANTINE
Take her now!
She pushes into his hand a scrap of paper on which she's
written her wishes.
VALJEAN
Your child will want for nothing.
FANTINE
Good m'sieur, you come from God
in heaven.
VALJEAN
And none shall ever harm Cosette
as long as I am living.
Fantine has stopped looking towards the window. All her
fading strength is now directed towards Valjean. She tries
to reach up to him.
FANTINE
Take my hand...
The night grows ever colder.
39.
VALJEAN
Then I will keep you warm.
He wraps her in his arms.
FANTINE
Take my child
I give her to your keeping.
VALJEAN
Take shelter from the storm.
FANTINE
For God's sake, please stay till
I am sleeping...
And tell Cosette I love her
And I'll see her when I wake...
Fantine starts to spasm. She sees something over Valjean's
shoulder. Valjean doesn't realise. Her eyes go glassy as
she passes away. Valjean then hears the unforgettable voice
of Javert behind him.
JAVERT
Valjean, at last
We see each other plain!
`M'sieur le Mayor'
You'll wear a different chain!
Valjean stands to face Javert.
VALJEAN
Before you say another word,
Javert,
Before you chain me up like a
slave again,
Listen to me! There is something
I must do.
This woman leaves behind a
suffering child.
There is none but me who can
intercede -
In mercy's name, three days are
all I need,
Then I'll return, I pledge my
word!
Then I'll return...
Javert draws his sword and aims it at Valjean.
JAVERT
You must think me mad!
I've hunted you across the years.
Men like you can never change -
A man such as you!
Valjean breaks a section of timber beam from the roof.
40.
The men start to circle each other.
They sing at the same time, duelling in song.
VALJEAN
Believe of me what you will
There is a duty that I'm sworn to
do.
You know nothing of my life -
All I did was steal some bread.
You know nothing of the world -
You would sooner see me dead.
But not before I see this justice
done!
JAVERT
Men like me can never change.
Men like you can never change.
No, 24601!
My duty is to the law.
You have no rights.
Come with me, 24601!
The two men fight.
VALJEAN
I am warning you, Javert,
I'm a stronger man by far!
There is power in me yet!
My race is not yet run!
JAVERT
Now the wheel has turned around -
Jean Valjean is nothing now.
Dare you talk to me of crime
And the price you had to pay.
Every man is born in sin
Every man must choose his way.
Javert disarms Valjean and drives him backwards towards an
attic door.
You know nothing of Javert!
I was born inside a jail.
I was born with scum like you.
I am from the gutter too.
Valjean is pushed through the doors out onto a wooden
loading platform beneath a hoist. Below, the walls of the
factory lead straight down to the black sea at high tide.
Javert is triumphant.
Valjean glances down and pushes back, dropping into the
darkness of the ocean.
Javert goes to jump after him and cannot bring himself to do
it.
41.
Javert stares into the black sea - there is no sign of
Valjean.
34A
36
Cosette is in the process of sweeping the floor. She's come
to a stop, gazing out of the window, mesmerized by the
sight of the most beautiful doll in the display, and
jealous that Eponine can see it and touch it up close.
COSETTE
There is a castle on a cloud
I like to go there in my sleep.
Aren't any floors for me to
sweep,
Not in my castle on a cloud.
Cosette gets out from a hiding place in the wall a knotted
grimy rag - this is her "doll", the knot is the doll's head.
There is a lady all in white
Holds me and sings a lullaby.
She's nice to see and she's soft to
touch
(holding doll to her ear
and whispering)
She says, Cosette, I love you
very much.
I know
a place where no one's
lost
I know
a place where no one
cries.
Crying
at all is not allowed,
Not in
my castle on a cloud.
Madame Thenardier comes bustling down the stairs in a bad
mood. She glowers at little Cosette and changes the closed
sign from "closed" to "open".
MADAME THENARDIER
Now look who's here!
The little madam herself,
Pretending once again
She's been so awfully good!
Better not let me catch you
slacking!
Better not catch my eye!
Ten rotten francs your mother
sends me -
What is that going to buy?
Now take that pail,
My little Mademoiselle,
And go and draw some water from
the well.
We should never have taken you in
In the first place -
How stupid the things that we do!
Like mother, like daughter, the
scum of the street.
43.
Cosette goes to put the broom away.
Eponine comes in from outside.
MADAME THENARDIER
Eponine, come my dear.
Eponine, let me see you.
You look very well in that little
blue hat!
There's some little girls who
know how to behave
And they know what to wear
And I'm saying thank heaven for
that!
Madame Thenardier sees that Cosette far from going is
hiding behind the far wall. We see Cosette's frightened
eyes peering out from a tiny gap in this wall.
MADAME THENARDIER
Still there, Cosette?
Your tears will do you no good!
I told you to fetch some water
from the well in the wood.
COSETTE
(singing through the gap)
Please do not send me out alone.
Not in the darkness on my own.
Madame Thenardier imitates Cosette as she sings.
MADAME THENARDIER
(singing through the gap)
Enough of that, or I'll forget to
be nice!
You heard me ask for something,
And I never ask twice!
The innkeeper's gang posing as customers who have been
loitering outside come in, explaining to a fifth man who is a
newer recruit a story from Monsieur Thenardier's past. Madame
Thenardier goes outside to open up the rather pathetic frost
fair stall on the porch of the inn.
CUSTOMER 1
Mine host Thenardier
He was there, so they say,
At the field of Waterloo.
CUSTOMER 2
Got there, it's true,
When the fight was all through
But he knew just what to do.
CUSTOMER 3
Crawling through the mud,
So I've heard it said,
(more)
44.
CUSTOMER 3 (cont'd)
Picking through the pockets of
the English dead.
CUSTOMER 4
He made a tidy score from the
spoils of war.
We suddenly hear the voice of the landlord, Thenardier. He
has been there all the time, asleep on a bench. He wakes
from his drunken slumbers and roars out:
THENARDIER
My band of soaks,
My den of dissolutes,
My dirty jokes, my always pissed
as newts,
My sons of whores,
Spend their lives in my inn!
Homing pigeons homing in -
They fly through my doors,
And their money's as good as
yours!
36A
37
THENARDIER
Welcome, m'sieur!
Sit yourself down
And meet the best
Innkeeper in town!
Madame Thenardier pretends to accidentally drop a comb from
her hair and the customer helpfully picks it up, allowing
Madame Thenardier to pick his wallet from a back pocket as
he stands up. Monsieur Thenardier takes his coat which
allows the couple to see the customer transfer a pocket
watch from coat to jacket pocket.
THENARDIER
As for the rest -
All of them crooks
Rooking the guests
And cooking the books.
Seldom do you see
Honest men like me
A gent of good intent
Who's content to be -
He pours a strong drink for the new customer -
45.
THENARDIER
Master of the house!
Doling out the charm
Ready with a handshake
And an open palm
Thenardier has thieved the pocket watch using his handshake
as a distraction. He passes this off to Madame Thenardier.
THENARDIER
Tells a saucy tale
Makes a little stir
Customers appreciate a bon-viveur
Glad to do a friend a favour
Doesn't cost me to be nice
But nothing gets you nothing
Everything has got a little
price!
THENARDIER
Master of the house!
Keeper of the zoo!
Ready to relieve'em
Of a sou or two -
(serving wine)
Watering the wine
37A
37A
Thenardier is pissing into the very wine bottle he's using to
serve the customer.
37B
37B
THENARDIER
Making up the weight
Picking up their knick-knacks
When they can't see straight
Everybody loves a landlord
Everybody's bosom friend!
I do whatever pleases -
Jesus! Won't I bleed'em in the
end!
37C
37D
Again Madame Thenardier drops her comb in front of the new
customer but this time the thieving is foiled by little
Cosette who helpfully picks it up. Over the chorus she shouts
at little Cosette to get out.
THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS
Servant to the poor
Butler to the great
Comforter, philosopher and
lifelong mate
Everybody's boon companion
Everybody's chaperone -
THENARDIER
But lock up your valises -
Jesus! Won't I skin you to the
bone!
A FAMILY enters the inn. Thenardier fusses over them.
THENARDIER
Enter, messieurs!
Lay down yer load
Unlace yer boots
And rest from the road.
This weighs a ton
Travel's a curse
But here we strive
To lighten your purse.
He's got the father's purse out, and is removing notes.
THENARDIER
Here the goose is cooked
Here the fat is fried
And nothing's overlooked
Till I'm satisfied -
Food beyond compare
Food beyond belief
38
38
Thenardier shows off the secrets of the squalid kitchen -
every possible animal being used to make mince meat.
THENARDIER V/O
Mix it in a mincer
And pretend it's beef
Kidney of a horse
(more)
47.
THENARDIER V/O (cont'd)
Liver of a cat
Filling up the sausages
With this and that!

38A
Thenardier serves the disgusting food that we've seen him
create in the flashback to the family.
THENARDIER
Residents are more than welcome
Bridal suite is occupied
38B
38B
A groom and bride consummate their union.
Thenardier is going through the groom's trousers.
THENARDIER V/O
Reasonable charges
Plus some little extras on the
side.

38C
THENARDIER
Charge'em for the lice
Extra for the mice
Two percent for looking in the
mirror twice.
Here a little slice
There a little cut
Three percent for sleeping with
the window shut.
When it comes to fixing prices
There are lots of tricks he knows
How it all increases
All those bits and pieces -
Jesus! It's amazing how it grows.
39
39A
Madame Thenardier approaches a handsome soldier who is
drinking at a table by the fire in the inn. She sits on his
lap and gets him to look back at Thenardier, so allowing her
to see inside his coat and spot his wallet.
MADAME THENARDIER
I used to dream
That I would meet a prince
But God almighty
Have you seen what's happened
since?
`Master of the house'
Isn't worth my spit!
Comforter, philosopher
And lifelong shit!
Cunning little brain
Regular Voltaire
Thinks he's quite a lover
But there's not much there.
As Madame Thenardier reaches for the man's groin, she lifts
his wallet skillfully and hands it off to Monsieur
Thenardier.
THENARDIER
What a cruel trick of nature
Landed me with such a louse.
God knows how I've lasted
Living with this bastard in the
house!
She pulls the young man into a dance, enabling her to steal
everything else of value he has. Father Christmas has also
been lured from the frost fair and the Thenardiers slit his
presents sack and exchange it for a sack containing snow.
49.
THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS
Master of the house!
MADAME THENARDIER
Master and a half!
THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS
Comforter, philosopher -
MADAME THENARDIER
Don't make me laugh!

Valjean enters with Cosette. Madame Thenardier hurries
over. Madame and Monsieur Thenardier try to thieve from
Valjean using the same tricks established earlier, but he
evades every attempt. Eponine watches silently from a
corner.
VALJEAN
I found her wandering in the wood
This little child, I found her
trembling in the shadows.
And I am here to help Cosette,
And I will settle any debt you
may think proper.
I will pay what I must pay
To take Cosette away.
This is a duty I must heed.
There is a promise I have made.
For I was blind to one in need,
I did not see what stood before
me.
Now your mother is with God.
Her suffering is over,
And I speak here with her voice,
And I stand here in her place,
and from this day, and ever more -
MADAME THENARDIER
Let me take your coat, m'sieur!
VALJEAN
Cosette shall live in my
protection.
THENARDIER
You are very welcome here!
VALJEAN
I will not forget my vow.
51.
THENARDIER
Take a glass!
MADAME THENARDIER
Take a chair!
VALJEAN
Cosette shall have a father now.
Thenardier turns to his wife.
THENARDIER
What to do? What to say
Shall you carry our treasure
away?
What a gem! What a pearl!
Beyond rubies is our little girl!
How can we speak of debt?
Let's not haggle for darling
Colette!
MADAME THENARDIER
Cosette!
THENARDIER
Cosette -
Dear Fantine - gone to rest -
Have we done for her child what
is best?
Shared our bread - shared each
bone -
Treated her like she's one of our
own!
Like our own, m'sieur!
VALJEAN
Your feelings do you credit, sir.
And I will ease the parting blow.
Let us not talk of bargains and
bones and greed.
He gives Thenardier money.
VALJEAN
Now may I say we are agreed?
MADAME THENARDIER
That would quite fit the bill
If she hadn't so often been ill.
Little dear, cost us dear!
Medicines are expensive, m'sieur.
Not that we begrudged a sou -
It's no more than we Christians
must do.
Valjean gives more money.
52.
THENARDIERS
One thing more! One small doubt!
There are treacherous people
about!
No offence! Please reflect!
Your intentions may not be
correct!
Valjean hands over more money.
VALJEAN
No more! Here's your price!
Fifteen hundred for your
sacrifice.
Come, Cosette, say goodbye.
Let's seek out some friendlier
sky.
Thank you both for Cosette -
It won't take you too long to
forget.
He leads Cosette to the door.
44
45
Madame Thenardier takes the bunch of notes from her
husband's hand and inspects them.
THENARDIER
Not bad!
MADAME THENARDIER
Not enough!
Through the open door Thenardier sees a man on horseback
rattling up to the inn.
53.
MADAME THENARDIER
There's a copper at the door!
What the devil have you done?
Javert strides into the inn.
JAVERT
Where's the child Cosette?
MADAME THENARDIER
She's gone with a gent,
Didn't tell us where they went,
Didn't leave his home address.
JAVERT
Did you catch the fellow's name?
Both Thenardiers shake their heads.
Javert stares once, contemptuously, round the seedy inn,
and departs without a further word. Thenardier goes to the
doorway to watch him leave.
MADAME THENARDIER
You're a bloody fool
Look at what we got.
THENARDIER
Should have struck the iron,
Struck it while it's hot.
THENARDIER/MADAME THENARDIER
Next time round we'll be here
And we're gonna get the lot.
46
50
Valjean crouched low, with Cosette in his arms, holding her
still and quiet until Javert is gone.
Then he straightens up and looks round. He takes in the
sound of singing.
NUNS
Procul recedant somnia
Et noctium phantasmata
(more)
56.
NUNS (cont'd)
Hostemque nostrum comprime
Ne polluantur corpora...
He goes closer to the windows of the building. Through the
blurry glass he can make out a chapel, and a line of nuns
singing.
Valjean continues and sees a man filling in a new grave.
The man starts as he sees Valjean.
FAUCHELEVENT
Who's that?
Valjean jumps, takes Cosette protectively into his arms.
Turns to answer.
FAUCHELEVENT
Why, it's Monsieur Mayor!
It's Fauchelevent, now a gardener, still limping from his
injury.
VALJEAN
Who are you?
FAUCHELEVENT
Don't you remember? The cart fell
on me!
VALJEAN
Monsieur Fauchelevent!
FAUCHELEVENT
You saved my life! You got me
this job as a gardener!
Valjean gazes at him, and remembers.
VALJEAN
Now you can do the same for me.
We need a place of sanctuary.
This child and I, we need to
disappear.
FAUCHELEVENT
In this place of Holy Orders
You are brought to God's domain
May the sisters grant you shelter
May their prayers ease your pain.
Valjean and Cosette follow him to the convent.
VALJEAN
We'll give thanks for what is
granted
What the sisters may ordain
Here we pray for new beginnings -
Here our lives can start again.
57.
Valjean looks to the heavens. The camera soars into the air
and heads east as dawn breaks over Paris. We rush low over
Paris as the sun comes up, towards the Place de la Bastille.
51
54
Through a crack in a door, we see Marius sitting on a tatty
mattress in a tiny hovel of a room. He is taking out a
hunting rifle from under the mattress, wrapped in a rag. His
eye is caught by the ring on his finger.
CLOSE ON a signet ring, a family crest.
Marius stares at the ring then takes it off his finger.
We reveal EPONINE staring at him through the door.
EPONINE
Hey there Monsieur what's new
with you?
Haven't seen much of you of late.
Planning no doubt to change the
world?
Plotting to overthrow the state?
Still living here in this old sewer
Might as well doss down in a ditch
You still pretending to be poor
Everyone knows your Grandpa's rich
Marius rushes down the stairs of the slum, Eponine following.
We see glimpses of misery off the stairwell.
MARIUS
How did you...?
EPONINE
There's lots of things I know
MARIUS
Won't take a franc that I've not
earned
All of those bridges have been
burned.
EPONINE
I like the way you talk Monsieur!
MARIUS
I like the way you always tease.
62.
Eponine comes to a stop, looking wistfully after Marius.
EPONINE
Little he knows -
Little he sees.
55
64
Marius arrives at the first floor front room. Here a group
of students are cleaning rifles and sharing their
excitement at the coming revolution: ENJOLRAS, COMBEFERRE,
COURFEYRAC, JOLY, GRANTAIRE, FEUILLY, PROUVAIRE and others.
ENJOLRAS
Well, Courfeyrac! Do we have all
the guns?
Joly, Prouvaire! Our time is
running short!
COURFEYRAC
Students, workers, everyone!
There's a river on the run!
Like the flowing of the tide,
Paris is coming to our side!
COMBEFERRE
Enjolras! At Notre Dame
The sections are prepared!
68.
FEUILLY
At Rue du Bac
They're straining at the leash!
ENJOLRAS
Grantaire, put the bottle down!
Did we get the guns we need?
GRANTAIRE
Give me brandy on my breath
And I'll breathe them all to death!
ENJOLRAS
The time is near...
So near it's stirring the blood
in their veins.
And yet beware!
Don't let the wine go to your
brains.
For the army we fight is a
dangerous foe
With the men and the arms that we
never can match.
It is easy to sit here and swat
them like flies
But the National Guard will be
harder to catch.
We need a sign
To rally the people
To call them to arms
To bring them in line!
Joly turns goes over to Marius at the back, a faraway look
on his face.
JOLY
Marius, wake up!
What's wrong today?
You look as if you've seen a
ghost.
GRANTAIRE
Some wine, and say what's going
on!
They sit.
MARIUS
A ghost, you say? A ghost maybe!
She was like a ghost to me -
One minute there - then she was
gone!
GRANTAIRE
I am agog! I am aghast!
Is Marius in love at last?
I've never heard him Ooh and Aah.
You talk of battles to be won
(more)
69.
GRANTAIRE (cont'd)
And here he comes like Don Juan!
It is better than an opera!
They burst into laughter. But Enjolras isn't smiling.
ENJOLRAS
It is time for us all
To decide who we are.
Do we fight for the right
To a night at the opera now?
Have you asked yourselves
What's the price you might pay?
Is this simply a game
For rich young boys to play?
The colours of the world
Are changing day by day -
Red -
the blood of angry men!
Black
- the dark of ages past!
Red -
a world about to dawn!
Black
- the night that ends at
last!
MARIUS
Had you seen her today
You might know how it feels
To be struck to the bone
By a moment of breathless delight!
Had you been there today
You might also have known
How the world may be changed
In just one burst of light
And what was right seems wrong
And what was wrong seems right!
GRANTAIRE
Red!
MARIUS
I feel my soul on fire!
GRANTAIRE
Black!
MARIUS
My world if she's not there!
STUDENTS
Red!
MARIUS
The colour of desire!
STUDENTS
Black!
70.
MARIUS
The colour of despair!
ENJOLRAS
Marius, you're no longer a child -
I do not doubt you mean it well
But now there is a higher call!
Who cares about your lonely soul?
We strive towards a larger goal -
Our little lives don't count at
all!
ENJOLRAS
Red!
STUDENTS
The blood of angry men!
ENJOLRAS
Black!
STUDENTS
The dark of ages past!
Red - a world about to dawn!
Black - the night that ends at
last!
A scuffle at the door - Gavroche struggling with the
barman. Courfeyrac lets him through.
GAVROCHE
Listen! Listen to me!
COURFEYRAC
Listen, everybody!
GAVROCHE
General Lamarque is dead!
Enjolras turns to his companions.
ENJOLRAS
Lamarque is dead...
Lamarque... His death is the hour
of fate.
The people's man...
His death is the sign we await!
On his funeral day they will
honour his name
With the light of rebellion
ablaze in their eyes.
From their candles of grief we
will kindle our flame.
On the tomb of Lamarque shall our
barricades rise!
The time is here!
(more)
71.
ENJOLRAS (cont'd)
Let us welcome it gladly with
courage and cheer!
STUDENT
Let us take to the street with no
doubt in our hearts
COURFEYRAC
But a jubilant shout!
LESGLES
They will come one and all!
STUDENTS
They will come when we call!
As the students sing, Eponine enters wanting to talk to
Marius. Marius sees her.
65
65
Cosette is pacing in her bedroom. It's a pretty room, the
best room in this small summer house. Her shutters are
open, giving a view of a wild unkempt garden. She looks at
herself in a mirror, aware of her looks perhaps for the
first time.
COSETTE
How strange -
This feeling that my life's begun
at last!
This change -
Can people really fall in love so
fast?
What's the matter with you,
Cosette?
Have you been too much on your
own?
So many things unclear -
So many things unknown...
In my life
There are so many questions and
answers
That somehow seem wrong.
In my life
There are times when I catch in
the silence
The sigh of a faraway song
And it sings
Of a world that I long to see -
Out of reach
Just a whisper away
Waiting for me!
Does he know I'm alive?
Do I know if he's real?
(more)
72.
COSETTE (cont'd)
Does he see what I see?
Does he feel what I feel?
In my life
I'm no longer alone -
Now the love in my life
Is so near...
Find me now! Find me here!
Valjean knocks and opens her door. He closes her shutters.
VALJEAN
Dear Cosette,
You're such a lonely child.
How pensive, how sad you seem to
me.
Believe me, were it within my
power
I'd fill each passing hour.
How quiet it must be, I can see,
With only me for company.
COSETTE
There's so little I know
That I'm longing to know
Of the man that you were
In a time long ago...
There's so little you say
Of the life you have known,
Why you keep to yourself,
Why we're always alone.
So dark! So dark and deep,
The secrets that you keep!
In my life
Please forgive what I say
You are loving and gentle and
good.
But papa, dear papa,
In your eyes I am still like that
child
Who was lost in a wood.
VALJEAN
No more words -
No more words.
It's a time that is dead.
There are words
That are better unheard,
Better unsaid.
COSETTE
In my life
I'm no longer a child and I yearn
For the truth that you know
Of the years... Years ago!
73.
Valjean leaves and goes into his own bedroom. A simple wooden
shack at the back of the summerhouse, Valjean himself lives
with spartan simplicity - he has given the best room to
Cosette.
Cosette follows. Valjean sits on his bed, his back to
Cosette.
VALJEAN
You will learn.
Truth is given by God
To us all in our time,
In our turn.
66
68
Valjean, now in his own bedroom, hears the scream and turns
to the window.
69
70
Valjean comes running into Cosette's room. Valjean takes
her in his arms.
VALJEAN
My God, Cosette!
I heard a cry in the dark.
I heard the shout of angry voices
in the street.
COSETTE
Three men I saw beyond the
wall...
Three men in shadow moving fast!
VALJEAN
This is a warning to us all!
These are the shadows of the
past!
He moves away to his own bedroom.
VALJEAN
Must be Javert.
He's found my cover at last.
I've got to get Cosette away
Before he returns.
He comes back to Cosette.
VALJEAN
We must get away from shadows
That will never let us be.
Tonight we leave Cosette!
COSETTE
To where?
79.
VALJEAN
Rue de L'Homme Armee.
COSETTE
No! No!
VALJEAN
And then a ship across the sea.
VALJEAN
Hurry, Cosette! Prepare to leave,
And say no more.
Tonight we'll away!
COSETTE
(overlapping)
No! Please no! We can't go!
VALJEAN
Hurry, Cosette!
It's time to close another door
And live another day!
Valjean leaves to start packing.
Feverishly, Cosette scribbles a letter.
71
SCENE OMITTED
71
72
73A
Eponine stands outside Marius' door. She opens the letter,
reads it, then hides it in her pocket. She pushes open
Marius' door. Marius looks up.
EPONINE
I came to tell you she's gone.
MARIUS
Gone? What do you mean?
EPONINE
She's gone to England.
Marius sets off at a run towards the Rue Plumet.
74
76
Valjean and Cosette sit on either side of the carriage,
apart, staring out of their respective windows. A stark
contrast to the carriage scene when Valjean sang to Cosette
as a little girl.
VALJEAN
One day more!
Another day, another destiny.
This never-ending road to
Calvary.
These men who seem to know my
crime
Will surely come a second time -
One day more!
77
78
VALJEAN
One day more!
COSETTE
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away
And yet with you my world has
started!
79
79
INTERCUT between Eponine at the gate, Cosette and Valjean
in the carriage, and Marius in the dark garden.
EPONINE
One more day all on my own...
MARIUS/COSETTE
Will we ever meet again?
EPONINE
One more day with him not
caring...
MARIUS/COSETTE
I was born to be with you!
EPONINE
What a life I might have known...
MARIUS/COSETTE
And I swear I will be true!
EPONINE
But he never saw me there.

CHANVRERIE - NIGHT
Enjolras and the students have a production line under way
for making bullets. The rifles are now stacked and ready
for the uprising. Grantaire is downstairs flirting with a
BARMAID. MADAME HUCHELOUP the proprietress of the Cafe
Musain is sewing a red revolutionary flag to help the
students.
ENJOLRAS
One more day before the storm!
83.
INTERCUT WITH Marius walking back sadly through the Rue de
la Chanvrerie. Eponine follows him at a distance.
MARIUS
Do I follow where she goes?
ENJOLRAS
At the barricades of freedom!
MARIUS
Shall I join my brothers there?
ENJOLRAS
When our ranks begin to form -
MARIUS
Do I stay and do I dare?
ENJOLRAS
(from top of stairs, for
Grantaire's benefit)
Will you take your place with me?
Grantaire rather reluctantly goes upstairs.
ALL
The time is now!
The day is here!
One day more!
81
81
Javert is briefing a hundred uniformed police about the
coming day in a grand ornate old room at Police
Headquarters.
JAVERT
One day more to revolution.
We will nip it in the bud.
We'll be ready for these
schoolboys.
They will wet themselves with
blood!
82
82
VALJEAN
One day more!
83
83
Monsieur and Madame Thenardier are in the ground-floor bar,
slyly watching a student smuggling some rifles up the
stairs disguised in a piece of cloth.
84.
Joly takes a tray and collects empty tankards. As he
ascends the stairs, Madame Hucheloup tries to get him to
give the tankards back.
THENARDIERS
Watch'em run amuck!
Catch'em as they fall!
Never know your luck
When there's a free-for-all.
Here a little dip,
There a little touch -
Most of them are goners
So they won't miss much!
The drinkers in the bar raise their glasses to the students
with their rifles. The students appeal to them. Grantaire
is drunk already. Joly starts to melt the tankards in a pot
to make more bullets. Marius enters the ground floor and
takes the red flag from Madame Hucheloup that she has just
finished. The citizens on the ground floor join the
students.
STUDENTS/CROWD
One day to a new beginning!
Raise the flag of freedom high!
Every man will be a king!
Every man will be a king!
There's a new world for the
winning!
There's a new world to be won!
Do you hear the people sing?
Marius enters the first floor to join them at last.
MARIUS
My place is here!
I fight with you!
84

MUSAIN GROUND & 1ST FLOOR/POLICE STATION - NIGHT
Valjean and Cosette arrive at their new hideout -
Marius ties the red flag onto a flagpole -
VALJEAN
One day more!
COSETTE/MARIUS
I did not live until today
How can I live when we are
parted?
Eponine outside the caf, gazing longingly towards Marius -
EPONINE
One more day on my own...
85.
Javert in the police station to his men -
JAVERT
I will join these people's heroes
I will follow where they go.
I will learn their little
secrets,
I will know the things they know.
VALJEAN/JAVERT
One day more!
MARIUS/COSETTE
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away
And yet with you my world has
started.
JAVERT
One more day to revolution
We will nip it in the bud
We'll be ready for these
schoolboys -
THENARDIERS
Watch'em run amuck
Catch'em as they fall
Never know your luck
When there's a free-for-all!
VALJEAN
Tomorrow we'll be far away.
VALJEAN/JAVERT
Tomorrow is the judgement day.
ALL
Tomorrow we'll discover
What our God in heaven has in
store -
One more dawn!
One more day!
One day more!
We pull back from Enjolras and Marius holding their flag at
the first floor window with the students beyond them to see
that citizens have spilled out of the Cafe Musain into the
street and have all joined in the final chorus.
85
86
FOLLOW the students as they burst into their home street.
They have been joined by a motley collection of citizens
including burghers and an old eccentric man FATHER MABEUF
who works as hard as anyone. They raid a fencing shop and a
gun shop for weapons, they force wives to give up their
husbands' muskets and chalk up the debt to the revolution
on their front doors, they encourage homeowners to
contribute furniture sometimes appearing at high windows to
help overcome any reluctance. Soon the street is raining
tables, chairs, mattresses, sofas. They smash streetlamps.
They set to work to build their barricade. Students
commandeer an omnibus which is overturned to form the
barricade's heart. Three students arrive in the street
hauling an uprooted tree.
89.
They pull up paving stones, rip boards, timbers and front
doors from house and shop-fronts, pull down buttresses, and
raid the Cafe Musain, systematically stripping it of every
item of furniture despite the lamentations and
protestations of Madame Hucheloup and her barmaid.
As the barricade rises they bring down from the first floor
of the cafe the rifles and ammunition they've gathered, to
prepare to defend their chosen ground. A student stands on
a stone post distributing weapons. They line the first and
second floor front rooms with paving stones to create
protected shooting positions. The inside of the barricade
is built neatly with steps up made from paving stones. The
outside is a crazy knarled mess.
ENJOLRAS
Here upon these stones
We will build our barricade.
In the heart of the city
We claim as our own
Each man to his duty
And don't be afraid.
A man in worker's clothing is helping build the growing
barricade,. He wears the insignia of the rebels, and keeps
his head down.
ENJOLRAS
Wait!
I will need a report
On the strength of the foe.
The man who's just arrived looks up. It's Javert.
JAVERT
I can find out the truth!
I know their ways,
Fought their wars,
Served my time
In the days
Of my youth.
He slips away through the barricade, which is still rising.
PROUVAIRE
See! The people unite!
GRANTAIRE
Pray your right
COMBEFERRE
Dogs will bark!
GAVROCHE
Fleas will bite!
LESGLES
They will do what is right.
90.
87
89
The LANDLADY climbs the stairs, followed by Gavroche. The
landlady indicates the door, and Gavroche knocks boldly.
The door opens a crack to reveal a cautious Valjean.
GAVROCHE
Letter for Cosette.
VALJEAN
I'll take it.
Gavroche holds out the letter with one hand, not quite
giving it, the other hand open for a tip.
Valjean gives him a coin, which he pockets as he hands over
the letter.
GAVROCHE
Something for you, something for
me. Who needs charity?
90
90
ON VALJEAN - As he reads the note.
VALJEAN
`Dearest Cosette, you have
entered my soul
And soon you will be gone.
Can it be only a day since we met
And the world was reborn?
If I should fall in the battle to
come
Let this be my goodbye.
Now that I know you love me as
well
It is harder to die.
I pray that God will bring me
home
To be with you.
Pray for your Marius.
He prays for you.'
He looks up, deeply distressed. He can't bear the thought
of losing Cosette.
VALJEAN
They haven't got a chance, these
boys
They almost certainly will die
She'll be alone
And she will need me all the more
And we will go on as before
When he is gone
I dare not think like this
I must find this boy
98.
91
93
Look-outs keep watch at either end of the barricaded
street. Many of the rest of the rebels are sleeping.
Valjean paces, unable to sleep, inside the cafe. Dead
bodies are lined up on the ground floor. He comes to a
stop, and gazes on Marius as he sleeps through the window.
VALJEAN
God on high
Hear my prayer
(more)
103.
VALJEAN (cont'd)
In my need
You have always been there.
He is young
He's afraid
Let him rest
Heaven blessed.
Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home!
He's like the son I might have
known
If God had granted me a son.
The summers die
One by one
How soon they fly
On and on
And I am old
And will be gone.
Bring him peace
Bring him joy
He is young
He is only a boy.
You can take
You can give
Let him be
Let him live,
If I die, let me die
Let him live
Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home!
Valjean is now kneeling next to the sleeping Marius.
CRANE UP AND UP - Seeing the little world of the barricaded
street now surrounded by waiting soldiers - and the streets
round them packed with soldiers in their thousands, so many
that we know the little band can never win.
CRANE UP AND UP until the barricade and the army that
entraps it has become a small pool of darkness in the
centre of the bright lights of Paris.
94
95
Grantaire is fast asleep in the upstairs room, dead drunk.
104.
96
97
Students and soldiers fight in the caf, on the stairs, up
the stairs to the upper room. Students driving back the
pursuing soldiers hack away at the staircase, smashing it
to fragments - the soldiers below fire up at them -
students fall, their bodies caught on the jagged remnants
of the stairs. Grantaire is still unconscious from drink.
98
99
The students' ammunition has run out, they're hurling
sticks and bottles - but the soldiers have found a way to
clamber up, shooting as they come, and one by one the
students are falling.
100
101
The soldiers break through at last to the upper room, to find
there's only Enjolras still alive. He stands by the window,
knowing he will die now, proud and unafraid. Seeing him the
soldiers hesitate. The sudden silence wakes Grantaire from
his drunken slumber.
GRANTAIRE
Long live the republic!
He sees Enjolras with the muskets raised against him.
Grantaire goes and joins him. Enjolras smiles, and raises his
now-ragged red flag.
The rifles blaze. Grantaire drops back to the ground.
Enjolras falls back -
102
104
Valjean is pulling Marius after him down a tight sloping
pipe, where dark water races. Suddenly they start to slide,
then drop through a vent into a wide sewage tunnel. Faint
light reflecting off the slime of curving tunnel walls. The
skitter of rats. Sodden forms floating by: dead bodies.
Valjean carries Marius down the tunnel, moving as fast as
he can, losing strength all the time. He reaches an
intersection where four sewers meet. Light falls through
distant gratings. One of the four sewers is dry. Here he
lets his burden down, and himself sinks to the slimy ground
to rest. He lets his eyes close.
A voice echoes in the shadows.
109.
THENARDIER
Here's a hint of gold
Stuck into a tooth -
Pardon me, m'sieur,
You won't be needing it no more.
Shouldn't be too hard to sell.
A figure coming closer. A sewer thief, robbing corpses. No
sign of life in either Valjean or Marius.
THENARDIER
Well, someone's got to clean'em
up, my friends,
Before the little harvest
Disappears into the mud.
Someone's got to collect their
odds and ends
When the gutters run with blood.
Now we see the thief is Thenardier. He finds a ring on
Marius's finger and pulls it off.
THENARDIER
Here's a tasty ring
Pretty little thing
Heart's no longer going
And he's lived his little time,
But his watch is ticking yet.
It's a world where the dog eats
the dog.
Where they kill for the bones in
the street.
And God in his heaven,
He don't interfere
Cos he's dead as the stiff at my
feet!
I raise my eyes to see the
heavens
And only the moon looks down.
The harvest moon shines down!
Valjean wakes, rears up, seizes Thenardier by the arm,
slams him against the sewer wall.
VALJEAN
How do I get out of here?
THENARDIER
There! That way!
Valjean drops him, picks Marius up once more, and sets off.
Thenardier stares after them, grinning. He's sent then the
wrong way.
LATER - Valjean in the sewers, Marius on his back, and
they're sinking ever deeper into the slimy water.
110.
As he feels himself sink, Valjean holds Marius up in his
arms and forges on, chest deep, lifting the younger man
above his head. Still he sinks, until his face is half-
submerged and he's gagging in the filth. He stumbles, and
suddenly he's sunk beneath the surface, and Marius is
dropping -
Then up he bursts again, face black with slime, eyes
burning with his refusal to be beaten.
LATER - Valjean staggers down the endless sewers, Marius on
his back. But all the time he can hear, closer now, the
rushing sound of the river.
Round a bend and at last - moonlight ahead.
He drags himself on through the shallow running water
towards the moonlight.
He reaches the exit at last. Before him the river.
105
107
CLOSE ON MARIUS - He's waking from the nightmare, finding
himself in a fine bed, with clean linen. He looks round: a
handsome room.
GILLENORMAND
Marius! You've come back to us!
Marius recognises the old man anxiously watching him: his
grandfather, Monsieur GILLENORMAND.
MARIUS
Grandfather...
He struggles to rise, but he lacks the strength. His
grandfather's face shows only love and concern.
GILLENORMAND
Rest, Marius. No more harsh words
between us. I just thank God
you're alive.
Timidly the old man comes closer to the bed. Tears form in
Marius's eyes. Encouraged, the old man takes Marius's hand
in his.
GILLENORMAND
You've come home. To all of us.
The distant voices of the mourning women -
WOMEN (O.S.)
Round and round
And back where you began...
108
108
Marius makes his way slowly up the stairs to the upper
room. He's still weak from his wounds. He enters the room
where his friends died, and looks round. He sinks into a
chair.
MARIUS
There's a grief that can't be
spoken
There's a pain goes on and on
Empty chairs at empty tables
Now my friends are dead and gone.
He sees the bloodstain on the wall beneath the window sill.
The blood of Enjolras.
MARIUS
Here they talked of revolution
Here it was they lit the flame
Here they sang about tomorrow
(more)
115.
MARIUS (cont'd)
And tomorrow never came...
From the table in the corner
They could see a world reborn
And they rose with voices ringing
And I can hear them now!
The very words that they had sung
Became their last communion
On the lonely barricade at dawn.
He looks out of the window at what's left of the barricade.
He seems to see again the brave doomed defence, the smoke
and the gunfire, the young men falling.
MARIUS
Oh my friends, my friends,
forgive me
That I live and you are gone
There's a grief that can't be
spoken
There's a pain goes on and on...
Phantom faces at the window
Phantom shadows on the floor
Empty chairs at empty tables
Where my friends will meet no
more.
Oh my friends, my friends, don't
ask me
What your sacrifice was for
Empty chairs at empty tables
Where my friends will sing no
more.
Slowly he rises from the chair and turns to the doorway.
There stands Cosette, waiting for him.
109
109
Cosette holds Marius, supporting him, as he enters the
house.
COSETTE
Every day
You walk with stronger step,
You walk with longer step.
The worst is over.
MARIUS
Every day
I wonder every day
Who it was brought me here
From the barricade.
Cosette leads him into the room where Valjean and
Gillenormand wait.
116.
COSETTE
Don't think about it, Marius!
With all the years ahead of us!
I will never go away
And we will be together
Every day.
Every day
We'll remember that night
And the vow that we made.
As Valjean and Gillenormand look on, Marius and Cosette
sing their love to each other.
COSETTE
A heart full of love
A night full of you
The words are old
But always true.
VALJEAN
She was never mine to keep
She is youthful, she is free...
MARIUS
Cosette, Cosette!
COSETTE
I saw you waiting and I knew -
GILLENORMAND
Thank God, thank God you are here!
Thank God, thank God you are home!
MARIUS
Waiting for you!
At your feet!
COSETTE
At your call!
VALJEAN/GILLENORMAND
Love is the garden of the young
Let it be
Let it be!
A heart full of love
This I give you this day.
MARIUS/COSETTE
And it wasn't a dream
Not a dream after all.
110
110
Marius stands before Valjean, alone in this more private
room.
117.
MARIUS
M'sieur, this is a day
I never can forget.
Is gratitude enough
For giving me Cosette?
Your home shall be with us
And not a day shall pass
But we will prove our love
To you, whom we shall call
A father to us both,
A father to us all.
VALJEAN
Not another word, my son.
There's something now that must
be done...
He's prepared himself to make this confession, but it's
still hard.
VALJEAN
There lived a man whose name was
Jean Valjean.
He stole some bread to save his
sister's son
For nineteen winters served his
time
In sweat he washed away his
crime.
Marius hears this with shock.
VALJEAN
Years ago,
He broke parole and lived a life
apart...
How could he tell Cosette and
break her heart?
It's for Cosette this must be
faced:
If he is caught, she is
disgraced...
The time has come to journey on,
And from this day he must be
gone!
Who am I?
Who am I?
MARIUS
You're Jean Valjean!
Marius can't conceal that he's disturbed by this
revelation.
118.
MARIUS
Monsieur, you cannot leave!
Whatever I tell my beloved
Cosette
She will never believe me.
VALJEAN
Make her believe
I have gone on a journey
A long way away.
Tell her my heart was too full
for farewells -
It is better this way.
Promise me, Monsieur, Cosette
will never know...
MARIUS
I give my word.
VALJEAN
...What I have spoken, why I must
go.
MARIUS
For the sake of Cosette, it must
be so.
111
112
Cosette gazes at Marius, bewildered by what she has just
learned.
COSETTE
Where's he gone without a word
That wouldn't be his way to go
MARIUS
All he asked for me to
say
He's on a journey, far
away.
Dear Cosette, he loves
you so
Perhaps he will return
some day.
Cosette comes into Marius's arms, tears in her eyes.
COSETTE
He can't leave us now
What's our wedding day
Without him giving me away?

Waltz music plays as Marius and Cosette lead the dancing at
the wedding reception.
As the dance proceeds, two extraordinary figures enter, and
start helping themselves to the drink and the food. They
are Thenardier and his wife, dressed up for high society.
MAJORDOMO
The Baron and Baroness du Thenard
They look round as the dance continues, highly satisfied with
themselves and see Marius.
Thenardier makes a mock-formal bow.
THENARDIER
I forget where we met...
Was it not at the Chateau Lafarge
Where the Duke did that Puke
Down the Duchess's decolletage?
MARIUS
No, `Baron du Thenard',
The circles I move in are humbler
by far...
Go away, Thenardier!
Do you think I don't know who you
are?
MADAME THENARDIER
He's not fooled!
Told you so!
Show M'Sieur what you've come here
to show.
Tell the boy what you know!
"LES MISERABLES" BLUE REVISIONS 20.5.2012
119A.
THENARDIER
Pity to disturb you at a feast
like this
But 500 francs surely wouldn't
come amiss.
MARIUS
In God's name say what you have
to say.
MADAME THENARDIER
(to Thenardier)
He speaks.
(to Marius)
You pay!
THENARDIER
What I saw, clear as light,
Jean Valjean in the sewers that
night,
Had this corpse on his back
Some boy he'd killed in a viscious
attack.
I was there, never fear!
Even found me this fine souvenir!
He shows off his ring. Marius stares in astonishment.
MARIUS
I know this! This was mine!
This is surely some heavenly sign!
Thenardier steals the ring back.
THENARDIER
And there's more! Mark this well -
It was the night that the
barricades fell.
MARIUS
Then it's true! Then I'm right!
Jean Valjean was my saviour that
night!
Thenardier looks past Marius to where Cosette stands among
their friends. He lowers his voice.
THENARDIER
Jean Valjean - the old con.
You pay up and I'll say where he's
gone.
He takes out money and reluctantly presses it into
Thenardier's hands. Madame Thenardier takes the money before
Thenardier has safely pocketed it.
"LES MISERABLES" BLUE REVISIONS 20.5.2012
120.
MARIUS
Not so loud! Here's for you.
God forgive us the things that we
do.
MADAME THENARDIER
How's about some extra
On a day so glad
Our little orphan girl
She hasn't done so bad.
Raised in a convent
Cash to spare -
We want our share.
Marius hands over yet more money to Madame Thenardier.
THENARDIER
Quite the little nun, ain't she!
CRACK! Thenardier sinks to the ground, felled by a powerful
blow from an angered Marius. The band stops playing.
MARIUS
Where is he?
THENARDIER
(cowardly voice)
The convent.
Marius rushes to Cosette and we see him telling her where
Valjean is. They hurry away.
Thenardier clambers to his feet, helped by his wife. He
gestures to the band to continue. They stand by the tiered
wedding cake. As Thenardier recovers his composure, Madame
Thenardier steals one then two pillars from the cake so it
collapses on the floor. She then pushes it under the table
with her foot.
"LES MISERABLES" BLUE REVISIONS 20.5.2012
121.
THENARDIER
Ain't it a laugh?
Ain't it a treat?
Hob-nobbin' here
Among the elite?
Here comes a prince
There goes a Jew
This one's a queer
But what can you do?
(pulling Madame Thenardier
onto the dance floor)
Paris at my feet!
Paris in the dust!
And here's me breaking bread
With the upper crust -
As he pivots Madame Thenardier, stolen silver drops out from
Madame Thenardier's dress. The music stops dead in the
clatter. The Thenardiers look up, as if implying that the
silver dropped from the ceiling. The dance continues.
Monsieur Gillenormand motions to the Majordomo to remove
these unwanted guests.
THENARDIER
Beggar at the feast!
Master of the dance!
Life is easy pickings
If you grab your chance!
MADAME THENARDIER
Everywhere you go
Law-abiding folk
Doing what is decent
THENARDIER
But they're mostly broke!
MADAME THENARDIER
Singing to the Lord on Sundays
THENARDIER
Praying for the gifts he'll send -
THENARDIER/MADAME THENARDIER
But we're the ones who take it -
We're the ones who make it in the
end!
The Thenardiers are carried off, singing as they go.
THENARDIER
Watch the buggers dance
MADAME THENARDIER
Watch'em till they drop!
"LES MISERABLES" BLUE REVISIONS 20.5.2012
121A.
THENARDIER/MADAME THENARDIER
Keep your wits about you
And you stand on top!
THENARDIER
Masters of the land
MADAME THENARDIER
Always get our share
THENARDIER/MADAME THENARDIER
Clear away the barricades
And we're still there!
We know where the wind is blowing
Money is the stuff we smell -
And when we're rich as Croesus,
Jesus! Won't we see you all in
hell!
As they are thrown out, the Thenardiers steal a tiara and a
candlestick.

Valjean prays in the chapel, on his knees. He's very weak.
Next to the crucifix on the altar are Valjean's two silver
candlesticks, in which two candles burn.
VALJEAN
Alone I wait in the shadows
I count the hours till I can
sleep.
I dreamed a dream Cosette stood
by
It made her weep
To know I die...
Alone at the end of the day
Upon this wedding night I pray
Take these children, my Lord, to
thy embrace
And show them grace...
God on high
Hear my prayer
Take me now
To thy care
Where you are
Let me be
Take me now
Take me there
Bring me home
Bring me home!
VALJEAN is joined by the ghost of Fantine. She takes his hand
as he prays.
FANTINE
M'sieur I bless your name...
VALJEAN
I am ready, Fantine...
FANTINE
M'sieur lay down your burden...
123.
VALJEAN
At the end of my days...
FANTINE
You raised my child in love,
VALJEAN
She's the best of my life...
FANTINE
And you will be with God.
116A
116B
The sound of the door opening. Valjean looks round. It's
Cosette entering, followed by Marius.
VALJEAN
Cosette?
Tears form in his eyes. Cosette goes to him, kneels before
him, takes him in her arms.
COSETTE
Papa, papa, I do not understand -
Are you all right? Why did you go
away?
VALJEAN
Cosette, my child! Am I forgiven
now?
Thank God, thank God, I've lived
to see this day!
Marius comes to him.
MARIUS
It's you who must forgive a
thoughtless fool!
It's you who must forgive a
thankless man!
It's thanks to you that I am
living,
And again I lay down my life at
your feet.
Cosette, your father is a saint!
When they wounded me
He took me from the barricade,
Carried like a babe,
And brought me home to you!
124.
VALJEAN
Now you are here
Again beside me
Now I can die in peace
For now my life is blessed...
COSETTE
You will live, papa
You're going to live
It's too soon
Too soon to say goodbye.
VALJEAN
Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to
die!
I'll obey
I will try...
He holds out a letter for her.
VALJEAN
On this page
I write my last confession.
Read it well
When I at last am sleeping.
It's the story
Of one who turned from hating
A man who only learned to love
When you were in his keeping.
Cosette takes the letter and kisses it.
COSETTE
I know it, papa.
Valjean turns back, face shining, towards the table where
the candles burn in the silver candlesticks. There he sees
three ghosts waiting for him. The ghost of the Bishop. The
ghost of Fantine. And beyond her, watching Marius with
love, the ghost of Eponine.
Fantine comes towards him, reaching out her hands.
VALJEAN
I'm ready now, Fantine.
FANTINE
Come with me
Where chains will never bind you
All your grief
At last, at last behind you
Lord in heaven
Look down on him in mercy -
VALJEAN
Forgive me all my trespasses
And take me to your glory!
125.
Cosette embraces Valjean, weeping.
Valjean reaches up his hands, and lets the ghost of Fantine
take them.
FANTINE/EPONINE
Take my hand
I'll lead you to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting...
VALJEAN/FANTINE/EPONINE/BISHOP
And remember
The truth that once was spoken:
To love another person
Is to see the face of God...
Led by Fantine, Valjean walks out of the Chapel towards the
cloister.
What remains is Cosette, her head cradled in the lap of the
man who has just died.
The walls of the cloisters are covered in votive candles.
The Bishop of Digne waits in front of the candles. Now
Valjean's strong and young again. Before they reach the
wall of candles, all three are gone.
As they disappear we CRANE UP, high over the cloister, high
over the walls of the Convent and we see the Paris streets
outside. Fires are burning and debris is scattered in the
streets. Dawn is breaking.
From far away, the sound of an approaching crowd -
117
