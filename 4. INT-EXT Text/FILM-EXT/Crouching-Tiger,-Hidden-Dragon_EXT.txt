Security men and porters are loading wagons for a convoy.
As they work, we see across the lake a lone horseman entering
the village.
One of the men recognizes him.
WORKER
Master Li is here!
ANGLE ON: Li Mu Bai, thirties, powerful and handsome.
In the background, old Aunt Wu, at the sight of Li Mu Bai,
drops her parcels and runs excitedly into the building.
Customs officials have just finished checking the contents
in a row of carriages bearing the Sun Security insignia.
The caravan slowly passes through the checkpoint into the
boundaries of Peking.
Yu, riding a handsome horse and
clearly the leader, watches as her crew clears inspection.
GUARDS
Ok.
Pass.
YU
Thanks.
Let's go into the city.
Workers are busy unloading the contents from the carriages.
Boss Giao is checking off the merchandise -- a cargo of
medicinal herbs.
GIAO
Everything got here safely.
I'm
much obliged.
YU
Just doing my job.
GIAO
Sun Security has been the best
since your father started it.
You're a credit to his memory.
YU
Thank you.
GIAO
I mean it.
From a gray tiled roof, we can see Peking's magnificent grid
of houses extending miles and miles out, freshly painted by
the morning sun.
Dusty and congested as always, people, horses, and carriages
are fighting to get through the boulevards.
A group of jugglers perform at a corner.
Yu surveys the busy street from on top of her horse.
It's dusk and the sky is beautiful orange and purple.
Jen
is leaving the study escorted by her maid.
She turns to Yu
for a final good-bye.
Yu seems intrigued by the encounter.
Two lighted lanterns are raised up.
A wide shot of the compound.
A patrol man greets Master Bo,
Sir Te's head of security.
The place is serene.
MASTER BO
Chilly, eh?
NIGHTMAN
Yes, Master Bo.
As Bo walks on, shadows rustle in a treetop in the background.
A masked figure silently opens the window and enters the
room.
It moves swiftly to the sword case, opens it, and
wraps the sword.
Bo enters, sees the thief, who leaps up to the ceiling.
The
thief steps over Bo and out into the courtyard.
Bo tries to
stop the thief, who easily outwits him, jumping onto the
roof as Bo yells out.
BO
Someone help!
Stop him!
He's on
the roof!
The sword's been stolen!
Stop thief!
Stop him!
The thief skips a few times and jumps off to a side street.
Bo grabs a pole and runs, as gongs begin to sound, alerting
people to the theft.
People rush outside, Yu Shu Lien among
them.
Bo runs through the streets.
The thief is nowhere in sight.
Suddenly, there are sounds of weapons clashing.
Bo hurries
towards the source.
Bo is surprised to see the hooded figure battling with two
other fighters -- Tsai (male, 40s) and May, his daughter.
TSAI
It's Jade Fox!
MAY
We must avenge mother!
The hooded figure does a gravity defying flip and soars over
a wall, just as Bo arrives.
BO
Do something!
He's getting away!
The thief runs atop a roof -- right into Yu.
Yu and the
hooded figure face off.
YU
Return the sword, and I'll let you
go.
The figure just regards her, slightly shifting weight.
Yu attacks, but the figure repels her.
YU
You've been trained at Wudan?
The figure answers by leaping to another rooftop.
Yu
catches up, and resumes her attack with a relentless series
of lightning-quick blows.
Bo follows Tsai and May, who are quickly walking away.
TSAI
You're mistaken.
We're just street
performers.
We were rehearsing.
MAY
Father!
BO
You were rehearsing?
Who are you
trying to fool?
May wants to respond but is again cut off by Tsai.
They run
off.
BO
Where did that thief go?
Bo looks around and discovers he had chased the thief into
Governor Yu's compound.
BO
Governor Yu's house!
Yu and the Black Figure continue to fight.
YU
Get down here!
Give back the sword!
Yu slowly gets the upper hand in her fight with the thief.
A small arrow cuts across the night and flies toward Yu.
She catches it, but the masked figure takes the opportunity
to get away.
Yu pauses to feel the arrow in her hand, standing in the
empty courtyard.
De Lu escorts Yu into Te's.
DE LU
Sir Te awaits you.
Madam Yu is returning from temple.
The governess is helping
her out of the carriage.
Servants are peeling bills off a
wall across the street.
MADAM YU
What is it?
MAID
Madam Yu, someone's put up posters.
A partially torn flyer with the words "Jade Fox will not
escape justice!" is seen on the ground.
MADAM YU
Let me see.
GOVERNESS
Someone is after Jade Fox.
Preposterous, looking for her here!
Madam Yu nods and walks inside, as the Governess tosses the
flyer away and follows her.
A hand scoops up the flyer -- it is Yu.
She studies it,
then puts it in her pocket, and moves on.
Bo is searching for the Tsais.
The bridge is full of
jugglers.
But the two are nowhere to be found.
Bo quizzes a homeless man.
BO
Where are they?
HOMELESS MAN
I don't know.
I haven't seen them
in two days.
Bo is about to give up when he looks up and sees May walking
quickly into an alley.
Bo follows her.
May walks into a dilapidated house surrounded by a broken-
down bamboo fence.
Bo inches closer and sees May and Tsai
oiling their weapons.
The maid escorts Yu out.
Yu pauses, looks around, and sees
the profile of the Governess peering at her from around a
corner.
...the face of a younger, less sophisticated Jen, as she
lets the dry desert air flow through her hair.
She sits in
a carriage, part of a caravan, with guards on horseback,
that is traveling through the spectacular desert.
Across
from her sits her mother, of whom she is barely cognizant.
MADAM YU
What a godforsaken place!
Can't
your father be appointed closer to
civilization?
Jen... are you
listening to me?
Jen is still looking out the side of the carriage, at a
beautiful mountainside.
Tsai and May have been sitting, hidden in the branches of a
tree, watching Jen.
TSAI
Let's go!
They drop down silently and walk away.
From another rooftop,
Lo looks silently on.
Tsai and May enter the house.
Yu and Li Mu Bai sit together.
LI
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast
suspicion on Governor Yu.
YU
But something is going on at the Yu
household.
LI
What have you discovered?
From her sleeve, Yu removes the flyer.
Li takes it, his
face darkening.
LI
Jade Fox?
Impossible.
YU
You always suspected she'd fled to
the West.
LI
I didn't think she'd dare come back
to Peking!
YU
Is there any place safer than under
the nose of Governor Yu?
LI
So I shall avenge my master's death
after all.
YU
Be careful.
Sir Te requires
discretion.
Official business is
difficult enough.
Don't let
personal feelings make it worse.
And I don't know... even this
poster... could be some sort of trap.
LI
Did you see who posted it?
Yu pauses.
YU
No.
LI
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's.
On the night of the theft there was
a brawl near Yu's.
Were you
involved?
YU
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.
I hear he
followed the thief to the Yus'.
LI
Have you questioned him yet?
YU
No, not yet...
LI
But your men are watching over Yu's
compund?
YU
No, I'd already sent them home.
You can blame me for losing the
sword, but please trust that I'll
get it back soon using my own
methods.
LI
That's not what I meant.
I don't
care about the sword.
YU
What do you mean?
Didn't you come
back here for it?
LI
I don't know it was stolen until I
got here.
YU
Then, why did you come?
LI
Well, we had talked...
De Lu enters.
DE LU
Pardon my intrusion.
Master Li,
your room is ready.
LI
Thank you.
Please lead the way.
Tsai, Bo, and May wait under an ancient tree.
Bo stifles a
yawn.
BO
The fox doesn't care much for
punctuality.
Still no sign of her.
An old lady struggles up the hill, wearing a floppy hat over
her face, holding a cane.
The three exchange glances.
TSAI
Enough!
Show yourself.
The old woman shrinks in fear, but then throws off her
disguise and unveils herself -- the Governess.
FOX
Tsai... you dog!
You will pay for
your stubbornness.
BO
That's what you think, old witch!
TSAI
If you surrender now, you'll suffer
less.
But if you resist, I won't
stop until you're dead.
MAY
Father!
Let me avenge my mother's
death.
FOX
You'll soon end up like her, you
little whore!
BO
You'll pay for that!
A fierce battle begins, the main fighting between Tsai and
Fox, with May and Bo getting a stab in occasionally, when
the opportunity presents itself.
TSAI
(to Bo)
She's going to paralyze you!
Using acupressure, Fox disables Bo.
May shoots an arrow at
her, but she catches it and flings it back, hitting May.
TSAI
May!
Fox then disables Tsai, but just as she goes for the kill,
Li Mu Bai flies down from the treetops and steps between them.
FOX
Tsai, you filthy mongrel!
An ambush!
MAY
Father, are you all right?
Li addresses Fox.
LI
Wudan should have gotten rid of you
long ago.
It's been a long time,
Jade Fox!
You don't remember me...
But you should remember my master.
You infiltrated Wudan while I was
away.
You stole our master!
Now
it's time for you to pay!
FOX
Your master underestimated us women.
Sure, he'd sleep with me, but he
would never teach me.
He deserved
to die by a woman's hand!
LI
You stole the secrets of Wudan's
highest martial arts.
But after
ten years of training, your moves
are still undisciplined.
And
today, under a Wudan sword... you
will die!
Li easily brings Fox to the ground.
Li raises his sword to the prostrate Fox.
A figure masked
in black appears next to Fox, sword extended, saving her.
FOX
Disciple, we'll kill them all!
FIGURE IN BLACK
Let's go!
BO
Another one!
FOX
I must get rid of Tsai!
Fox fights Tsai, Bo, and May, as Li addresses the masked
figure.
LI
Who are you?
Why is the Green
Destiny in your possession?
FIGURE IN BLACK
What's it to you?
LI
My name is Li Mu Bai.
The Green
Destiny is mine.
Jade Fox can't be
your master.
Where did you learn
that "Xuan Piu" move?
FIGURE IN BLACK
I'm just playing around.
LI
Tell me, who is your master?
FIGURE IN BLACK
Let's go!
FOX
We must kill them!
Tsai throws his blade at Fox, who catches it and throws it
back, hitting him in the head.
Fox and the masked figure
leap away.
May drops to the ground, cradling her dead father's head.
Bo kneels beside her.
MAY
Father!
Te and a group of his men look down as a cloth is removed
from over the body of Tsai.
Bo and May stand before them.
TE
This is Tsai?
MAY
My father.
Police Inspector from
Shaan.
TE
This should be reported to Governor
Yu.
The victim is an officer.
You
believe the killer is hiding out in
his compound.
YU
I'd bet my life on it!
TE
(to Li and Yu)
Come with me.
He exits the room.
Yu sits with Madam Yu and Jen.
They busy themselves with
various items for her trousseau.
MADAM YU
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us
with these wedding gifts.
She's
being so considerate.
YU
I'm sorry she's not feeling well
enough to receive you today.
MADAM YU
I heard Sir Te lost something.
And
now Madame Te's not feeling well...
Jen sits silently reading.
YU
We know who stole the missing item.
If the thief returns it, I'm sure
Sir Te will pursue the matter no
further.
MADAM YU
That's good.
Sometimes the help
can't keep their hands to themselves.
It's very embarassing.
YU
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning
people can make mistakes... that
can bring ruin to themselves and
their families.
MADAM YU
But don't be too lenient.
YU
No mercy will be shown toward the
murderer who turned up in Peking.
MADAM YU
A murderer?
YU
Yes.
The very killer of Li Mu
Bai's own master.
Last night, she
killed a policeman who had tracked
her down.
MADAM YU
A female criminal!
Now that's news!
Jen becomes visibly upset.
JEN
You say she killed a policeman?
YU
Yes, from the West.
He went
undercover and and followed her
here,
MADAM YU
Maybe the murderer and the thief
are one and the same.
YU
I doubt it.
This thief... it very
unusual...
As Yu speaks, she lifts the tea pot to pour Jen some tea.
As she finishes speaking, she looks into Jen's face and the
pot slips from her hand.
Without even looking down, Jen
instinctively catches the pot with a lightning-fast move.
YU
...And most likely smarter than a
mere killer.
Sir Te and Li Mu Bai walk by.
JEN
(formal)
Greetings, Sir Te.
SIR TE
Hello, Madam Yu.
This is Li Mu
Bai, the renowned swordsman.
LI
Delighted to meet you.
Li sizes Jen up.
TE
Miss Yu is soon to be married.
LI
Congratulations.
May opens her door, only to find Bo standing guard.
MAY
Why don't you come in?
BO
I'm standing guard.
MAY
Come in.
It's cold.
She turns back inside, hesitates, then turns back to him.
MAY
Come in.
We don't have to fear
Jade Fox if we're together.
A still, dark night.
Something moves in the moonlight.
A hooded figure jumps down.
Li Mu Bai, who had been hiding in the shadows, comes forward.
LI
Isn't it a bit too late to be out?
You've brought me the sword?
FIGURE
I do as I please.
The masked figure lunges away, but Li Mu Bai leaps with
incredible speed and grabs the sword from her.
LI
Where's your master?
FIGURE
What's it to you?
The figure floats away.
Li chases after her.
The two fly over houses and bounce off of rooftops,
displaying amazing floating skills.
The figure leaps into the garden, but again, Li is ahead of
her.
The figure attacks Li, who uses his agility to evade her.
Frustrated, the figure intensifies her attack.
The figure, losing composure, attacks wildly.
Li gets even
more elusive, using a branch to repel her.
LI
No growth without assistant.
No
action without reaction.
No desire
without restraint.
Now give
yourself up and find yourself again.
There is a lesson for you.
Li now holds the stick to her mask, gently raising it
slightly.
FIGURE
Go ahead.
LI
Why should I?
You need practice.
I can teach you to fight with the
Green Destiny, but first you must
learn to hold it in stillness.
FIGURE
Why do you want to teach me?
LI
I've always wanted a disciple
worthy of Wudan's secrets.
FIGURE
And if I use them to kill you?
LI
That's a risk I'm willing to take.
Deep down, you're good.
Even Jade
Fox couldn't corrupt you.
The figure's eyes cloud with tears.
FIGURE
Wudan is a whorehouse!
Keep your
lessons!
The figure swirls and takes off, leaving a rueful Li standing
alone in the monastery.
The Governess leaves, a small sack over her back.
Li practices fluently with Green Destiny in hand, beautifully
at ease with the weapon.
He spins around to find Yu standing
in the doorway.
YU
The sword is back... are you happy?
Li smiles.
LI
I admit, getting it back makes me
realize how much I'd missed it.
YU
But it's not your sword anymore.
You gave it to Sir Te.
LI
True.
But I must borrow it for one
last mission.
Jade Fox must die at
its edge.
Did you know what you
were hiding when you covered for
that girl?
YU
My job was to get the sword back,
without embarassing anyone.
I
wasn't about to ruin her life, or
her father's.
LI
You did your job well.
But, this
girl... I saw her last night.
YU
I knew she would intrigue you.
LI
She needs direction... and training.
YU
She's an aristocrat's daughter.
She's not one of us.
In any case,
it will all be over soon.
You'll
kill Fox, and she'll marry.
LI
That's not for her.
She should
come to Wudan and become a disciple.
YU
But Wudan does not accept women.
LI
For her, they might make an
exception.
If not, I'm afraid
she'll become a poisoned dragon.
YU
It's not our affair.
Even if Wudan
accepts her, her husband might
object.
LI
I thought by giving away the sword,
I could escape the Giang Hu world.
But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
YU
I wish there were something more I
could do to help you.
LI
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
Jen holds up a comb, with daylight shining through it.
Jen
admires the piece, her most prized possession.
Madam Yu sits opposite her.
MADAM YU
Jen... stop playing with it.
Jen looks out over the desert, as the wind picks up and the
sky darkens.
JEN
I won't break it.
Lo and a group of armed bandits descend on the caravan.
GUARD A
It's Dark Cloud!
Dark Cloud is
coming!
His warning is useless.
From Jen's pov, we see the guards
slaughtered in a hail of arrows and swords.
MADAM YU
Lower the shade, don't let them see
you!
DARK CLOUD (LO)
Don't touch the women!
Though unharmed, Madam Yu immediately faints.
Lo approaches
the carriage and grabs the comb from Jen's hand.
She bolts from the carriage, and, once outside, bends down
and grabs a lance from the body of a dead guard, whose horse
flails beside him.
She looks up to see the gang of bandits already making their
escape on horseback.
LO
Let's go!
Jen and Lo ride across the desert floor at breakneck speed.
LO
Come get your comb.
She tries to jab him with the lance, but he grabs it and
flings her off her horse.
LO
Hurry back to your mother.
Lo rides on as she charges after her horse.
A group of bandits is dividing up the loot, as Jen rides up,
keeping a respectable distance.
They notice her and rise as
she dismounts.
One of them saunters over to her and stands, grinning, a few
feet away.
In a second, she's slammed his balls into his stomach and
knocked his nose into his face.
He crumples to the sand.
The other bandits stop laughing, quickly exchange glances,
and charge her at once.
In a matter of seconds, they're either on the ground or
dragging their fallen comrades back.
Lo calls out and stops the fight.
LO
She's mine.
Lo and Jen ride, if not side-by-side, then parallel, about
20 feet apart.
Their pace has slowed considerably.
In
fact, they're dead tired.
LO
Let's stop a moment.
JEN
Give it back!
LO
(shouting a bit)
You're tired.
You need rest.
Your
horse needs water.
There's a creek
up here.
He dismounts, looks down at the dry creek bed.
LO
Well, there used to be!
What's
your name?
I'm Lo.
The Hans call
me Dark Cloud.
I'm not that tall
or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
JEN
My comb!
She kicks him.
They fight ferociously until Lo, exhausted,
collapses.
She kicks him a few times, then collapses too.
Lo walks out into a barren mountain landscape.
A chicken
roasts over a fire.
Lo whistles.
Jen appears suddenly with a rock and knocks it over his head.
Lo passes out as Jen scurries away.
Jen tries to find her way among the treacherous stony
terrain, her lips chapped and fingers bloody and blistered.
But soon she passes out.
Lo and Jen ride across the desert.
Jen holds tightly to him.
Lo and Jen lie in the bath together.
LO
When I was a boy, one night, I saw
a thousand shooting stars.
I
thought, where did they all go?
I'm an orphan.
I used to look for
stars alone.
I thought if I rode
to the other end of the desert, I'd
find them.
I've been riding in the
desert ever since.
JEN
And so, the little boy became a
fearsome bandit.
He couldn't find
the stars, so he stole my comb.
Lo pauses.
LO
Out here, you always fight for
survival.
You have to be part of a
gang to stand a chance.
Slowly,
your gang becomes your family.
All
that Dark Cloud stuff is just to
scare people and make my life easier.
JEN
So you're still that little boy
looking for shooting stars.
LO
I am a man.
And now I've found the
brightest star of all.
Lo sees uniformed men through his binoculars.
LO
Your father's men are looking for
you.
Jen doesn't respond.
Lo and Jen ride through a mountain pass.
Lo and Jen stand at the crest of a cliff.
Lo looks over,
viewing the desert valley below, as Jen joins him.
They see
a troop of uniformed men riding by in the distance.
LO
Your father's men are still looking
for you.
They're still out there,
circling closer.
JEN
Let them look.
LO
It is trouble for me.
Jen bites her lip.
JEN
Don't send me back!
LO
You must decide.
You might get
tired of this life.
You might
begin to miss your family.
If it
were our daughter, we'd look for
her too.
She would miss us.
Jen...
I want you to be mine forever.
I
will make my mark on the world.
I
will earn your parents' respect.
We have a legend.
Anyone who dares
to jump from the mountain, God will
grant his wish.
Long ago, a young
man's parents were ill, so he
jumped.
He didn't die.
He wasn't
even hurt.
He floated away, far
away, never to return.
He knew his
wish had come true.
If you believe,
it will happen.
The elders say, "A
faithful heart makes wishes come
true."
Jen quietly walks out and stands sadly in the early morning
light.
End of flashback.
The noise and color of a wedding procession.
A marching
band heralds the occasion, as throngs of onlookers fight to
get a glimpse of the groom, Gou Jun Pei, who trots by on a
handsome white horse.
Li and Yu watch the festivities from a balcony of the city
gate.
YU
You think Jade Fox will show up?
LI
She's out there, but I doubt she'll
show herself.
We'll keep our eyes
open.
Sooner or later, she'll come
for the girl.
Lo leaps and lands right in front of Li Mu Bai, his fingers
pressed against Lo's neck.
Yu comes running around the
corner and sees them.
LI
Where is Jade Fox?
Yu jumps in and pushes Li away.
YU
(to Lo)
Come with me!
Hurry!
Yu and Li enter, as other men and women race through the
compound, a sense of panic in the air.
Yu gives Li a look.
Li shrugs.
Li and Yu pass a cup back and forth as Bo tends to the
horses in the background.
YU
Have some tea.
As Yu passes the cup to Li, their fingers touch.
Embarrassed, Li pulls back.
LI
Shu Lien... The things we touch
have no permanence.
My master
would say... there is nothing we
can hold on to in this world.
Only
by letting go can we truly possess
what is real.
YU
Not everything is an illusion.
My
hand... wasn't that real?
LI
Your hand, rough and callused from
machete practice... All this time,
I've never had the courage to touch
it.
Li takes Yu's hand and presses it to his face.
LI
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and
dragons, full of corruption... I
tried sincerely to give it up but I
have brought us only trouble.
YU
To repress one's feelings only
makes them stronger.
LI
You're right, but I don't know what
to do.
I want to be with you...
just like this.
It gives me a
sense of peace.
Li Mu Bai smiles.
Li and Yu ride together.
LI
(to Yu)
We're close to your headquarters.
Go home and check in.
YU
What about you?
LI
I'll look around and catch up later.
YU
Not a bad idea.
Tonight we'll get
a good night's sleep at headquarters.
Yu takes a fork off the road.
Thunder can be heard in the
darkening sky.
A group of security men are practicing Kung Fu in the front
yard of Sun Security.
They stop when Yu enters.
SECURITY MAN A
Mistress, you're back.
YU
It's you!
How's everything here?
CAPTAIN
Fine.
You've been gone a while.
YU
Yes, and I leave again tomorrow.
Your wife was due?
AH WAI
Yeah, a baby girl.
YU
Good!
AH WAI
I'll be happy if she's half as
strong as you.
YU
Mrs. Wu...
AUNT WU
You're back!
YU
How's the arm?
Still sore?
AUNT WU
Much better.
You've been gone so
long.
YU
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the
night.
AUNT WU
(excited)
I'll go and make up his room!
Aunt Wu hustles out.
Yu goes into her own room.
Jen floats over the lake, Li close behind.
Jen runs into a sea of bamboo.
She appears to have lost Li
but is not slowing down.
Her white clothes are now stained
with blood and mud.
The wind had picked up and every breeze
sounds like an air attack by Li.
The two leap onto the tips of the bamboo trees and begin
their dances and dodges.
They glance off bamboos and each
other while staying afloat.
Finally Jen lands on the same
stick of bamboo as Li.
The two hold their positions for a
while, as the bamboo bends.
LI
I only let you go because I wanted
to see the real you.
Jen tries to shake Li off the bamboo but Li recovers nicely.
JEN
What do you know about a true heart?
Li suddenly leaps off the bamboo tree.
The bamboo
straightens up and throws Jen toward the ground.
Jen
quickly pulls herself up and charges at Li.
Jen chases after Li, into a clearing, out of the bamboo
forest.
Jen finally catches up to Li, who is standing on a rock
about a few feet wide amid the rapids.
Jen vaults onto the
rock and scuffles with Li.
Jen loses her balance.
JEN
What do you want?
LI
What I've always wanted, to teach
you.
JEN
All right.
If you can take back
the sword in three moves, I'll go
with you.
Li takes the sword back.
JEN
Give it back!
LI
Kneel!
JEN
Never!
LI
Then you have no use for the sword.
Li throws the sword into the rapids.
Jen dives in to retrieve it.
He follows Jen downstream by
hopping from one rock to another.
Jen recovers the sword
but is herself drowning.
Suddenly Jade Fox swings into the
rapids and fishes Jen out.
Jade Fox carries the unconscious
Jen away.
Li gives chase, but loses them.
Fox scurries ahead in the rain.
Her eyes catch something,
but she keeps moving.
Jen walks out, raises her face into the rain, and drinks the
raindrops.
Thirst quenched, she turns around and finds Li
standing there.
Jen limps towards him while mumbling.
JEN
Is it me or the sword you want?
Jen falls into Li, who checks her pulse and looks at her eyes.
LI
You've been drugged!
Li carries her inside, kicking away the incense burner.
Bo is burying Fox in the rain.
The guards surround Jen.
She pushes past them.
JEN
Where is Mrs. Wu?
Aunt Wu comes running out.
AUNT WU
Stop it!
Jen pulls out Yu's comb.
JEN
Shu Lien told me to show you this.
AUNT WU
Let her in.
As the sun rises, Jen rides speedily, clutching the medicine
in her hands.
Jen climbs up toward the temple, finally reaching the temple
gate, and sees Lo standing there.
He runs to her.
She greets him.
Lo catches up to Jen, who stands on a bridge.
The gorges
below are shrouded in clouds.
She looks back at him.
JEN
Do you remember the legend of the
young man?
LO
"A faithful heart makes wishes come
true."
JEN
Make a wish, Lo.
Lo pauses.
LO
(closing his eyes)
To be back in the desert, together
again.
Jen smiles, turns, and leaps into the clouds.
They seem to
catch her gently, before she disappears into them.
Lo remains standing, a smile on his face, tears rolling down
his cheeks.
THE END.
