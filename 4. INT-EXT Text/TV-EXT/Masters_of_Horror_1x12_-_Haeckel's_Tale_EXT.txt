      It is a ramshackle, broken-down little HOUSE, almost 
      completely overrun by VINES and BRUSH, practically to the 
      point where it s completely hidden.  The GRASS is unruly, the 
      blistered WOOD not whitewashed in decades.

      In the FRONT YARD just outside the house lie THREE 
      splintered, weathered WOODEN GRAVE MARKERS.  The GRAVES 
      beneath them seem RAW and FRESH, despite the age of the 
      MARKERS.

      It is the Late Nineteenth Century in Connecticut, and a warm 
      FIRE flickers behind the WINDOW.

      Under the heavy-clouded SKY, a WELL-DRESSED MAN in his late 
      thirties, EDWARD RALSTON, arrives on horseback. He looks 
      completely out of place in this neighborhood.

      He checks the address on the SLIP of PAPER in his HAND, then, 
      taking a last look at these strange old GRAVES, dismounts and 
      heads up the path to the DOOR.  He RAPS gently.

      No answer, so, almost timidly, he raps again.

      An OLD WOMAN S VOICE calls out from within.

                                  OLD WOMAN (O.S.)
                    Enter if you must!  Just cease that 
                    damnable tapping!

      Ralston hesitates at the sound of her voice, then takes the 
      KNOB in hand and opens the door.



      A small CROWD has gathered under hand-painted BANNERS 
      surrounding an enclosed WOODEN WAGON.  They proclaim  The 
      Great Montesquino, Necromancer .  

      FERDINAND MONTESQUINO is a middle-aged, corpulent gent in a 
      frayed TOP HAT and long MOUSTACHE.  His SUIT was once fine, 
      but now is too tight, and stretched at the seams.

      Young Ernst Haeckel wends his way through the small crowd as 
      Montesquino waxes theatrical, his British accent mellifluous 
      and flowery.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    What is the line between life and 
                    death, between darkness and light, 
                    between existence and infinity?  I 
                    am here to tell you that the dead 
                    can live again!  I possess that 
                    mystical secret, held until now 
                    only by the sacred shaman of 
                    Zanzibar.  It came to me at great 
                    cost, and it is not a power I use 
                    lightly.  With power comes great 
                      responsibility.  Each life I grant 
                    takes a year off of my own.  But 
                    because of the sacred trust I hold, 
                    it is well worth it.

      He looks around the tiny audience, his eyes rimmed with last 
      night s debauchery.  His gaze falls upon the doubting face of 
      Haeckel.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    I sense disbelief among you.

      He grins, his eyes not leaving Haeckel, revealing a horribly 
      aligned, snaggled set of teeth.  




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   14.

        CONTINUED:66

      He leans right down in Haeckel s face, the stench of his 
      breath practically knocking him unconscious.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    You, sir.  I expect an educated 
                    young man like you would require 
                    proof of such a proclamation.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I would, indeed, sir.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    And what would convince you of my 
                    powers?

                                    HAECKEL
                    Not this sideshow, Professor 
                      Montesquino.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    I ask again.  What proof would you 
                    require that I tell the truth?

                                    HAECKEL
                    Nothing less than to see the dead 
                    revived before my own eyes.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    And so you shall have it, young 
                    man!

      He moves to the back of the little PLATFORM and drags a 
      WICKER BOX to the front of the little makeshift stage.

      The people in the crowd crane their necks to see what s 
      inside.  With a grand flourish, Montesquino reaches down to 
      the lid of the box.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Behold... DEATH!

      He PULLS the top off the box and leans it forward to reveal a 
      DEAD DOG within, obviously road kill, horribly mangled by the 
      wheels of a CART or WAGON.  The thing s a mess.

      The crowd GASPS and takes a step back.  All except for 
      Haeckel, who has seen more than his share of death up close.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                          (to Haeckel)
                    The miserable cur is dead, is it 
                    not?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   15.

                                    HAECKEL
                          (with a smile)
                    Quite dead, sir.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Just so.

      His hands gesture theatrically in florid and arcane 
      movements.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                          (chanting)
                    Vobiscum botanicum; terra firma 
                      romanticum.  Magicus validus; 
                    animus activus, funero exsanguinis.  
                    Miraculum spectaculum!

      A HUSH falls over the paltry crowd, and the silence that 
      ensues is long and expectant.  

      Nothing happens.

      The crowd moves in a little closer, and Haeckel SMILES, 
      enjoying the old fraud s act.

      And then, the wicker basket suddenly JERKS!

      The crowd pulls back, except for Haeckel.  Then it JERKS 
      AGAIN!

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Behold: LIFE AFTER DEATH!

      The wicker box SHIVERS and SHAKES, and then, from within it 
      comes a low, MOURNFUL HOWL.  It grows in intensity: hideous, 
      agonizing.

      CRIES from the crowd:  Kill it!    Put it out of its misery!   
       Poor beast!   Etc.

      The unbelieving Haeckel gets right up close to the basket. 

      As he starts to REACH for the LID, it suddenly JOLTS OPEN, 
      and the RE-ANIMATED DEAD DOG within LURCHES OUT, and SNAPS at 
      him with BLOODY, FROTHING TEETH, just missing getting hold of 
      his HAND!

      Haeckel LEAPS BACK as Montesquino KICKS the undead beast and 
      FIRES A BULLET into its brain.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   16.

      CONTINUED: (3)66


      The DEAD DOG flops back into the wicker basket, and 
      Montesquino drops the lid into place.  The basket, this time, 
      remains STILL.

      As Haeckel quakes from his close call, Montesquino leans down 
      and grabs him by his shoulders, bringing him face to fearsome 
      face.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Do you believe your own eyes, young 
                    man?

      This close, the necromancer s EYES are BLEARY and BLOODSHOT, 
      his stubble mottled with grey, and his BREATH muscular.  
      Haeckel cannot answer him.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                          (to the crowd)
                    To resurrect a simple beast is not 
                    so taxing as to bring back a human 
                    being, a man with a soul.  Compared 
                    to that, this is merely a parlor 
                    trick.  Man is far more complex.

                                    HAECKEL
                    So you re saying a dog doesn t have 
                    a soul?

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    I am, young sir.

      FARON and RACHEL MAYBERRY, a young couple of obviously meager 
      means, approach the front of Montesquino s platform, timid 
      and vulnerable.

                                  FARON
                    Professor Montesquino...

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    My good man...

                    My wife and I... we... we lost our 
                    little girl to diptheria in the 
                    summer.  She was but three years 
                    old.  And we... and we wondered if 
                    you could... if you might...

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    You want me to bring her back.

                    Do you have a hundred dollars?

                                  FARON
                    Oh, no, sir, nowhere near...

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    How much do you think a year of my 
                    life is worth?

                                  FARON
                    We wouldn t know, sir.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    I should say it s worth more than a 
                    hundred dollars.  Could you get a 
                    hundred dollars?

                                  RACHEL
                    Not in a million years, sir.  But 
                    we were hoping that as a good 
                    Christian you might find it in the 
                    goodness of your heart...

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    I m sorry.  Find one hundred 
                    dollars, and I can bring your 
                    little girl back to you.  I am not 
                      a charity.
                          (turning to the crowd)
                    Now, then; who else would like to 
                    have their late, bereaved loved 
                    ones back in their arms again?

      The crowd looks at one another.  Montesquino looks at 
      Haeckel.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    What about you, young man?

      Haeckel, for once, is speechless.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      THE SAME PLACE - THAT NIGHT77

      A CAMPFIRE is burning as Montesquino cooks a GAME FOWL for 
      his supper when Haeckel approaches.

                          (looking up)
                    Ah, the young Doubting Thomas.  A 
                    good evening to you.

                                    HAECKEL
                    And to you.  

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    As delighted as I am to see you, I 
                    am having my supper.  Perhaps you 
                    could return in the morning.

                                    HAECKEL
                    My name is Ernst Haeckel.  I am a 
                    medical student at the University, 
                    and I wish to inquire of your ways.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Ah, a man of science.  Well, 
                    perhaps a boy of science.  

      He LAUGHS.  That doesn t sit well with the already defensive 
      Haeckel.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    I am absolutely thrilled to meet 
                    you, Mr. Haeckel.  However, I am 
                    not here to instruct you.  My 
                    knowledge came over many years of 
                    intense instruction, at great risk 
                    to my own life and limb.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I am willing to take risks.

      He pulls a BOTTLE of WHISKEY out of a SACK and hands it to 
        Montesquino.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Are you, indeed?
                          (taking the bottle)
                    The costs are greater than a bottle 
                    of whiskey.  I know you do not 
                    believe in my ways.  You think 
                      necromancy is twaddle, a sideshow 
                    for the gullible.

                    The dog: an excellent trick.

      Montesquino just raises his eyebrows.

                    You threw your voice, did you not?  
                    And the movements of the dead

                    I see.  If you say it cannot, then 
                    surely it cannot.  Who could argue 
                    with the likes of such a brilliant, 
                    educated young man as yourself?

                                    HAECKEL
                    So you do not even argue with me?

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    I do not.  I am tired, and wish to 
                    sleep.  Sweet dreams, young man, 
                    and thanks for the bottle.

      He kicks dirt over the fire, and retires into the WAGON, and 
      Haeckel leaves in frustration.



      Ernst Haeckel makes his way through the verdant countryside, 
      carrying a CARPET DUFFEL of his belongings over his shoulder.  
      CLOUDS roil ominously overhead.

      The farmer s DOG BARKS ferociously at Haeckel, and the farmer 
      makes no move to shut him up.

      Haeckel walks to and past us; he has a long way to go.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:



      The sun is setting, and the DRIZZLE of RAIN is soaking 
      through Haeckel s COAT.  It s a miserable journey.

      There is a DRY SPOT up ahead, under the vast TREE that 
      overhangs the road.  Haeckel makes his way to the shelter of 
      the tree, and sits on the soft MOSS beneath it.

      Dark shadows of worry and sleeplessness are under his eyes as 
      he stares out at the long road before him.

      He opens his DUFFEL and takes out a large LOAF of BREAD.  He 
      TEARS OFF a HUNK, and takes a big bite.  Delicious.

      But there is a strange SMELL: Haeckel looks around to see 
      where it is coming from.  Seeing nothing, he digs back in, 
      famished.

      Just as he is about to take another bite, something DARK and 
      WET drips onto it, right before it enters his mouth.

      DRIP.  And another.  DRIP.

      A BREEZE has kicked up, and Haeckel looks up above him.


      ANGLE - HAECKEL S P.O.V.

      A BODY is HANGING by the NECK from a stout branch above him, 
      dripping castoff FLUIDS.  A hand-scrawled BOARD hangs from 
      his neck:  PEDERAST .


      ANGLE - OVER THE BODY, LOOKING DOWN ON HAECKEL

      Haeckel stares up in horror at the HANGED CRIMINAL leaking on 
      him from overhead.

      The ROPE and BRANCH GROAN in the breeze.

      RESUME HAECKEL S POV (THIS SHOT IS OPTIONAL)

      As a LARGE DRIP falls in SLOW MOTION and hits him in the eye.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   22.

      He leaps to his feet and casts the chunk of bread to the 
      ground.  Not the best place to set up camp, after all.  

      Pulling his coat up over his head, Haeckel sets back out on 
      the road.


      MONTAGE (2ND UNIT):1111

      Three angles of Haeckel s journey on foot: A COUNTRY ROAD, A 
      GREEN HILLSIDE, A RICKETY FOOTBRIDGE.  He is all alone, Man 
      vs. Nature.



      It is RAINING, and Haeckel is miserable.  

      He comes to a ROCK WALL against the GRAVEL ROAD, and sits to 
      rest on the soft grass against it.  He looks even worse than 
      before.  He is SNIFFLING and in a foul temper.  

      There is a protective natural OVERHANG that provides a dry 
      area for him to rest.

      It is dead silent as he unrolls a BLANKET from his DUFFEL.  
      He collects STICKS and BRANCHES, and proceeds to BUILD a 
      FIRE.

      He sits on the blanket and takes out a HUNK of the hard 
      BREAD.  He starts to eat it, starving.

      A DADDY LONG-LEGS SPIDER starts to crawl on his arm, and he 
      stares at it.  He lets it crawl the length of his arm and 
      onto his hand, watching it, bemused, as it crawls into his 
      palm.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Life...
                          (crushing it in his hand)
                    ... and death.

      He opens his hand and stares at the crumpled remains of the 
      creature.







                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   23.

                    And one day, I shall be able to 
                    bring you back...

      He takes a long PULL from the BLADDER filled with WATER, then 
      corks it and gathers MOSS for a pillow.

      The STORM is getting worse, and LIGHTNING is FLASHING.

      As he puts his MOSS into place, some of the ROCKS from the 
      WALL give way and TUMBLE to the ground, revealing:

      A small BAT S SKELETON, falling onto his new pillow!

      Haeckel backs away, into:

      An OLD MAN, standing right behind him!

                                    HAECKEL
                    Jesus!

                                    WOLFRAM
                    My deepest apologies, young sir.  I 
                    did not mean to cause you fright.

                                    HAECKEL
                          (calming down)
                    You startled me...

      The old man, WALTER WOLFRAM, is stubbled and shabby.  One EYE 
      is clouded with CATARACT, but his TEETH are clean and even.  
      WOODEN FALSIES, we might guess.  An enormous UMBRELLA keeps 
      the rain from dumping on him.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    It would not be wise for you to 
                    sleep here tonight.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I am tired, and I am not going to 
                    move an inch.  This is an open 
                    road.  I have every right to sleep 
                    here if I wish to.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Of course you do.  I did not say 
                    the right was not yours.  I simply 
                    said it was not wise.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I m sorry.  I m cold and I m tired 
                    and I m hungry.  I meant no insult.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   24.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    None taken.  I am Walter Wolfram.  
                      A pleasure to make your 
                      acquaintance.

      He reaches out his hand, and Haeckel clasps it.

                                    HAECKEL
                    My name is Ernst Haeckel.  I m on 
                    my way to Windsor.  My father is... 
                          (choking on it)
                    ... quite ill.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Please, come with me; I live 
                    nearby. I can offer you a warm, dry 
                    bed, a proper fire, some hot potato 
                    soup.

      Haeckel can t believe his good fortune.

                                    HAECKEL
                    An offer I shan t decline.  Many 
                    thanks to you, sir.

      Haeckel rolls up the blanket and stuffs it into his rucksack 
      with his other belongings as Wolfram watches him with an 
      inscrutable face.

      Haeckel looks up to see the man staring at him, and Wolfram 
      looks away.  As he finishes packing up:

                                    HAECKEL
                    Why do you think it unwise for me 
                    to sleep in this place?

      Wolfram gives him a deep, sorrowful, heart-breaking look.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    You are a young man, and no doubt 
                    you do not fear the workings of the 
                    world.  But please believe me when 
                    I tell you there are nights when it 
                    is good not to sleep next to a 
                    place where the dead are laid.

                                    HAECKEL
                    The dead?

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Aye.  Their home.  The necropolis.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   25.

      He motions to a view over the stone wall to reveal, in a 
      FLASH of blinding LIGHTNING:

      Laid out before them is a CEMETERY, filled with cockeyed 
      stone GRAVE MARKERS, twined with VINES.  It s the essence of 
      every creepy GRAVEYARD from the classic HORROR MOVIES.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I am a medical student.  I do not 
                    fear the dead.

      His expression says otherwise.

      The RAIN slows to a halt and the SKY begins to CLEAR, 
      revealing a MOON that illuminates the shining, wet GRAVEYARD 
      in all its glory.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Then I suppose you are a lucky man.  
                    Come.


      WIDE ANGLE - CEMETERY1313

      The old codger leads Haeckel out across the Necropolis in the 
      silvery MOONLIGHT, their BODIES and the GRAVESTONES casting 
      LONG SHADOWS.  The MOON frowns down on them from behind the 
      parting CLOUDS.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      The little FARMHOUSE is nestled in GREENERY, sparkling from 
      the RAIN that has just passed.  The moon s BLUE LIGHT makes 
      it particularly magical.

      The WINDOWS are WARM with FIRELIGHT as Wolfram leads Haeckel 
      to the door, leaving the GRAVEYARD far behind them.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    It is not much, but it is warm and 
                    dry.

      And he opens the door to their sanctuary.



      Haeckel comes charging out of the house into the night, the 
      landscape covered with the twinkling remains of the rain 
      shower that passed over in the moonlight.  A CURTAIN of CLOUD 
      has parted to grant the MOON a look.

      Walter comes out after him, and grabs his arm.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Come back into the house!  For 
                    pity s sake, leave this alone and 
                    come back into the house!

      We can hear Elise s SHRIEKS now, reaching across the 
      landscape from the CEMETERY in the distance.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   39.

                    No!  Someone has to help her!  
                    Listen to her cries!

      He yanks out of Wolfram s GRIP and heads down the path, 
      leaving Wolfram in his wake.

      Walter goes back into the house, and emerges with a MUSKET in 
      his hands.  Haeckel STARTS, afraid he s going to use it on 
      him, but Wolfram hands him the musket.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Take it!

                                    HAECKEL
                          (pushing it away)
                    I do not intend to kill anybody!  I 
                    just want to get Elise out of this 
                    damn Englishman s hands.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    She won t come, believe me.  Please 
                    take the musket!  You re a good 
                    fellow, I don t want any harm to 
                    come to you.

      Haeckel turns from him, ignoring him, and marches up the path 
      toward the GRAVEYARD.



      Walter comes behind him, wheezing, trying to keep up with the 
      young medical student.

      Haeckel imagines himself the knight in shining armor, out to 
      rescue the fair damsel in distress.  So why is Walter trying 
      to talk him out of it?

      Walter can barely speak as he tries to keep up, talking 
      between deep breaths.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Listen to me, Haeckel.  Elise... 
                    she has a sickness...  She had it 
                    when I met her...  What did I know?  
                    I loved her... I sold... everything 
                    I had to grant her this... I wanted 
                    her to be.... happy... 

      Another CRY rends the night.

                    Well, it is and it isn t.  Oh, God,

      Walter is practically in tears.

                    We couldn t begin to please her.

                    So you hire Montesquino to service 
                    her?  Jesus, man!

      He shoves Wolfram hard in the chest, and the old man tumbles 
      to the wet path, grabbing at Haeckel s LEGS, and PULLING 
      himself up, rising with MUDDY HANDS and SKINNED KNEES.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Stop, I beg of you!  Stay away from 
                    the Necropolis!

      There is a break in the cries, and the night goes silent as 
      Haeckel strikes back out on the PATH, with Wolfram straggling 
      behind him.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Bastard!  What kind of husband are 
                    you to her?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   41.

      A new SOUNDS joins the symphony: the damned, mournful HOWL of 
      the DOG again.  It sounds in complete agony.

      Haeckel follows the path over the gentle rise of the slope.  
      The NECROPOLIS is still out of sight, blocked by TREES and a 
      STONE WALL, and the CURVE of the PATH up the HILL.

      The agonized HOWL of the DOG is closer now, close enough to 
      stop Haeckel in his tracks.  Wolfram is right behind him.

      Something is emerging from the dripping SHADOWS of the TREES 
      that line the path.  It is making its way, slowly emerging 
      into the moonlight, WHIMPERING.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    I beg you cease, Mr. Haeckel.  You 
                    are stepping into a netherworld you 
                    should never enter.

      Haeckel ignores him, and slowly steps toward the silhouette 
      slowly emerging from the shadows.

      The damned thing whines and yowls in deep agony, dragging 
      itself into the MOONLIGHT.

      Haeckel, and Wolfram behind him, step closer.

      It is a DOG, and a familiar one at that.  It is lying on the 
      ground, pulling itself forward with its FRONT LEGS.

      There is a HOLE in its CROWN, and brownish black BLOOD covers 
      half its face.  Howling weakly in pain, it continues to pull 
      itself toward Haeckel, its glassy EYES on the young man.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Good lord... I know this pitiful 
                    cur!

      He bends down before it, as it drags itself along the path, 
      its hindquarters still hidden by the shadows.  Its FUR is 
      MATTED with DIRT and MUD and DRIED BLACK BLOOD.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Poor beast!

                                    WOLFRAM
                    I m begging you to stay away!

      As he crouches before the WOUNDED DOG, the pitiful CREATURE 
      pulls itself all the way out into the moonlight, revealing:

      HALF of its BODY is MISSING!



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   42.

      CONTINUED: (3)2323


      The poor dog s BODY ends halfway down its BACK; its SPINAL 
      COLUMN is trailing behind in the MUD.  The BEAST is ROTTING, 
      seemingly long DEAD.

      It LASHES OUT at Haeckel, SNAPPING at him with frothing, 
      gnashing JAWS.  The thing is pitifully ineffectual, but 
      trying as hard as it can to attack.  

      Hard to do without the back half of its body, though.

      The ZOMBIE HALF-DOG snaps and flails at Haeckel, who is 
      horrified and disgusted by the thing.  It is easy to avoid 
      its attack, however.

      Haeckel picks up a large, mossy ROCK, and SMASHES the UNDEAD 
      DOG S SKULL in.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Put the damned beast out of its 
                    misery.

      After moments of stillness, it SQUIRMS to  life  again, 
      trying to PULL itself out from under the rock that has 
      crushed its skull and pinned it to the ground.

      Haeckel picks up the rock, and bashes the flattened SKULL 
      again and again and again, as the beast bellows one mournful, 
      painful CRY after another.

      The thing WEAKENS with every blow, even seems to DIE each 
      time, but keeps coming back.

                                    HAECKEL
                          (fevered, perspiring)
                    Die, damn you!

                                    WOLFRAM
                    It is already dead, Haeckel.  You 
                    cannot kill it again.

                                    HAECKEL
                    That s impossible!

                                    WOLFRAM
                    No.  The filthy beast is dead.

                                    HAECKEL
                    But the poor thing suffers so!

                                    WOLFRAM
                    I tell you, there is nothing you 
                    can do!



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   43.

      CONTINUED: (4)2323




      The dog s broken, misshapen HEAD tries to BARK and HOWL, but 
      without its VOCAL CORDS, it just comes out in a WHISPERING 
      HUFF. 

      The wrecked beast keeps trying to pull itself along with its 
      withered FRONT LEGS.  The bony PAWS just dig little TRENCHES 
      in the muddy path.



      Walter GRABS him by his SHIRT FRONT, his face manic, his eyes 
      crazed.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Do you see now?  You have no idea 
                    the horrors that await you here!

                                    HAECKEL
                    All the more reason to go to your 
                    wife!

                                    WOLFRAM
                    All the more reason to stay away!

      And then... ELISE S CRIES begin again, closer than ever.

                                    HAECKEL
                    What kind of man are you?  You 
                    actually paid this Montesquino to 
                    bring back your wife s first 
                    husband from the dead, you damned 
                    fool!

      He leaves the crushed RE-ANIMATED DOG to WHEEZE and SCRATCH 
      in the dirt as he makes his way up the HILL to the GRAVEYARD.                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   44.





      The IRON GATES are OLD and RUSTED, and the STONE WALLS are 
      ANCIENT and falling apart.  VINES wind around the GATES and 
      the WALLS, sprouting lush, rotting BLOSSOMS that play in 
        counterpoint to the otherwise HORRIFIC TABLEAU.

      The MOON is fully revealed by the CURTAIN of DARK CLOUDS.  
      The GROUNDS are WET and SHINING.  Lush OAKS surround the 
      necropolis, guarding it from view.

      Mounted on the IRON GATES is a SKELETON, chained there to 
      keep away unwanted visitors as a SCARECROW would keep away 
      the birds.  The rotting remains of its clothing hang from the 
      bones in rags.

      The skeleton stares down at Haeckel with black, empty EYE 
      SOCKETS and a frozen GRIN.

      Haeckel reaches for the GATE, only to find that it is LOCKED 
      and CHAINED.  He turns to Wolfram.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Give me the musket.

      He grabs the GUN from Walter, and smashes it open with the 
      gun butt.

      The WINDS start to kick up as Haeckel struggles to pull the 
      GATE OPEN.  It fights him with a long, ragged SQUEAL as it 
      OPENS.

      The WIND BUILDS as Haeckel dramatically ENTERS the GRAVEYARD.  
      Walter stays behind, right outside the GATE.  

      Haeckel looks back.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Are you not coming?

                                    WOLFRAM
                    I dare not tread upon consecrated 
                    ground.  I dare not enter the place 
                    where Montesquino performs his dark 
                    magic.

                                    HAECKEL
                    So be it.

      Haeckel takes a tight grip on Walter s musket and makes his 
      way into the dark, shadowy CEMETERY.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   45.

      Wolfram watches helplessly from the gate for a few beats, his 
      EYES welling with TEARS.  He buries his head in his hands, 
      his shoulders quaking with SOBS.

      Then, we see something that neither one witnesses:

      The SKELETON slowly TURNS its SKULL and WATCHES Haeckel go...



      It s a meager GRAVEYARD: no massive tombs or towering stones, 
      merely coarsely carved HEADSTONES and WOODEN CROSSES.

      Haeckel makes his way through them toward the SOUNDS of some 
      sort of RITUAL... and the VOICE of ELISE...

      In the distance we hear a HOOTING OWL and CROAKING FROGS.  

      Haeckel rushes through, then TRIPS and FALLS into an OPEN 
      GRAVE.


      ANGLE - IN OPEN GRAVE

      Haeckel breaks his fall.  Beneath him in the OPEN WOUND of 
      the ground is an old, BROKEN WOOD COFFIN, broken open from 
      the inside, with no corpse within.


      RESUME GRAVEYARD

      Haeckel CLIMBS out of the OPEN GRAVE and continues his quest.  
      He doesn t even wonder why there is no body in the grave.

      In the distance, he sees:

      FIRELIGHT, and SHADOWY HUMAN FORMS.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Elise!

      And he charges through the graveyard toward the activity.

      Before the view is clear, he sees right up before him:

      Montesquino is SEATED on a TOMBSTONE, PUFFING on a long 
      TURKISH PIPE.

      Haeckel rushes up and PULLS the necromancer off the STONE and 
      KNOCKS him to the GROUND.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   46.

      CONTINUED:2525


                                    HAECKEL
                    Bastard!

      Montesquino recovers, and recognizes Haeckel.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Ah, the Doubting Thomas... come to 
                    save the maiden fair, no doubt.

                                    HAECKEL
                    What have you done to her, damn 
                    you!

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Not to her, young man... for her.  
                    See for yourself.

      Haeckel follows his gaze.

      Just across the GROUNDS, we can see ELISE, spectacularly, 
        voluptuously NAKED in the SILVER LIGHT of the MOON and the 
      GOLD FIRELIGHT of TORCHES that surround her in a ten-foot 
      CIRCLE, burnishing her fair skin.

      Haeckel is overwhelmed and embarrassed by her loveliness 
      revealed so completely... until he sees, as they say, what 
      lies beneath.



      At first it seems she is sitting on the wet grass, her face 
      and chest FLUSHED, her BREATH coming in GASPS.  Her CRIES are 
      not of anguish, but of PASSION.

      And her bouncing, rolling MOVEMENT betrays the source of her 
      passion:

      She is STRADDLING a MAN... but this man is DEAD.  He is 
      covered in desiccated FLESH; his rotting HANDS are pawing at 
      her BREASTS as she takes him within her.

      This is Elise s FIRST HUSBAND.  Despite the corruption of his 
      features in death, we can tell that he was a HANDSOME MAN.  
      Though they are CLOUDED, his EYES are a deep, pale, 
      penetrating BLUE.

      This is the HANDSOME YOUNG MAN in the MANTEL PORTRAIT!

      She WRITHES up and down on the corpse, passionately coupling 
      with the man she loves most.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   46A.

      The TORCHES are held aloft by another FOUR or FIVE of the 
      UNDEAD, surrounding this love act as if lighting a showgirl.

      In a mad corruption of Busby Berkeley s favorite overhead 
      angle, Elise is surrounded by TORCH-BEARING living CORPSES 
      and FRESHLY-OPENED GRAVES.

      As Haeckel watches in abject horror, Walter, flushed and out 
      of breath, comes up behind him.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    I warned you.

                                    HAECKEL
                          (horrified)
                    You knew this was happening?

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Of course I knew.  I fear it is the 
                    only way she is satisfied.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Good God, what is she?

                                    WOLFRAM
                    A woman.
                          (anguished tears leak from 
                          his eyes)
                    A woman in love with a dead man...

                                    HAECKEL
                    No natural woman would endure that.  
                    Jesus!  Jesus!

      He looks over at Elise, who, with her dead lover, is in the 
      throes of ecstasy.

      The HEAT is spreading to the CORPSES who stand guard.  They 
      are not completely dead.

      One of the DEAD GUARDS heads to the center of the CIRCLE and 
      stands over the coupling couple.  He cannot keep his rotting, 
      decaying hands off of the stunning and voluptuous Elise, and, 
      in the heat of this twisted passion, she doesn t fight him 
      off.

      The other UNDEAD approach the party, one at a time, and try 
      to shove the CORPSE GUARD away so that they can partake.  
      They push and shove at one another, dying to participate.

      Elise and her late husband barely notice.  Her CRIES reach 
      off into the night.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   47A.

      Outraged, Haeckel SHOUTS OUT:

                    Stop!!!

      Furiously, he GRABS the MUSKET from Walter and charges off 
      into the graveyard.

                          (calling after him)
                    Don t hurt her!  She is not to 
                    blame!

      He heads not for Elise, but for Montesquino.  He CLIMBS over 
      GRAVES and BRANCHES and the occasional FALLEN TREE.

                                    HAECKEL
                      Montesquino!  Montesquino!

      Montesquino is watching from his seat on the back of a 
      GRAVESTONE when Haeckel charges up to him and SLAMS him 
      across the FACE with the BARREL of the MUSKET.

      The necromancer falls to the ground, his FACE BLEEDING.

      Haeckel AIMS the GUN at him, and PULLS BACK the HAMMER.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    Do not blame me, young sir!  I am 
                    merely doing as I was paid to do!

                                    HAECKEL
                    Get to your feet!

      Montesquino rises, his hands raised in surrender, terrified 
      that he s going to be shot.  His entire demeanor has changed; 
      he s no longer the arrogant, confident magician.  He is now 
      in the thrall of something out of his control.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    I cannot, sir!  I cannot!

      Haeckel jams the MUZZLE of the MUSKET into Montesquino s 
      ample BELLY.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Stop it now, I command you!  I 
                    swear to God, I will shoot you 
                    dead!

      Montesquino can only shake his head, his eyes wild, his 
      composure gone.

                                    HAECKEL
                    Do it!

      Montesquino is shaking, and cannot speak.  Then:

                                    WOLFRAM (O.S.)
                    Elise!

      They turn to look.


      ANGLE - WITH WALTER WOLFRAM

      The pitiful Wolfram is CLAMBERING over GRAVESTONES and FALLEN 
      TREES toward his WIFE.

                                    WOLFRAM (cont d)
                    Elise... please, Elise... you 
                    should come home now...


      ANGLE ON ELISE

      She doesn t even hear him; she is overwhelmed with sexual 
      desire.


      ANGLE ON ONE OF THE (OBVIOUSLY) AROUSED DEAD

      It turns toward Walter.


      ANGLE - INCLUDE WALTER, ELISE, AND THE DEAD

      Walter stumbles through the necropolis to his naked wife, but 
      there are re-animated BODIES between them.  ONE of the DEAD 
      GUARDS stands and shambles toward Walter, WAVING him away.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   50.

      Walter continues toward her, TEARS running down his face.

                                    WOLFRAM
                    Elise, please... come home with 
                    me...


      ANGLE - INCLUDE HAECKEL

                                    HAECKEL
                    Walter, stay away!

      The CORPSE continues toward Walter, still shooing the man 
      away from his bride.  When Walter won t be shooed, the CORPSE 
      KNOCKS him to the GROUND.

      Walter FLAILS and gets back up, but the CORPSE-- and another-- 
      are on him.

      They knock him back to the ground, then fall upon him.

                                    HAECKEL
                          (to Montesquino)
                    Come with me!

      He heads across the grounds, leading with the gun, and 
      Montesquino follows.

                                    HAECKEL
                    I m coming, Walter!


      ANGLE - WITH HAECKEL AND MONTESQUINO

      Haeckel and Montesquino scramble over the obstacle course of 
      the graveyard toward Walter and Elise, Haeckel leading with 
      the MUSKET. 

      When they reach Walter, he is SCREAMING as TWO of the UNDEAD 
      are TEARING red, steaming VISCERA out of his OPEN CHEST and 
      ABDOMEN.

      Haeckel SWINGS the MUSKET and BATS one of the disintegrating 
      undead to the ground, but it just climbs back up and onto the 
      SCREAMING, DYING Walter.

      The other CORPSE bends down and FEEDS off of Walter s EYE 
      SOCKET.

      As Elise is being ravished on the other side of the GRAVE, 
      the LIVING DEAD GUARDS are dining on Walter as he DIES.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   51.

      Horrified by what he s wrought, Montesquino RUNS away.

                                    HAECKEL
                      Montesquino, stop!

      He keeps running.  Haeckel raises the gun and FIRES, and 
      Montesquino goes down, HOWLING in the wet GRASS.

      Haeckel goes to Montesquino, his musket now spent.  He GRABS 
      him by the COLLAR.

                                    HAECKEL
                    What does it take to make this 
                    stop?  What are the words?

      Montesquino is weak, wounded.  His TEETH are CHATTERING.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    No... no words...

                                    HAECKEL
                    How do we make it stop?

      The FIRE is FADING from Montesquino s EYES.

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    When... the... sun... comes... 
                    up...

                                    HAECKEL
                    You cannot stop it any other way?

                                    MONTESQUINO
                    No... no... other... way...

                                    HAECKEL
                          (shaking him)
                    Tell me, you bastard!

      Montesquino SHOVES BACK, and Haeckel SLIPS on the WET GRASS, 
      losing his footing, and FALLING hard onto a GRAVESTONE.  He 
      HITS it with a resounding SMACK, and falls unconscious.

      A FLASH of WHITE, then:

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

                                                                            FADE IN:                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   52.





      HIGH and WIDE.

      The first LIGHT of the SUN is just coming up over the 
      HORIZON, just leaking into the darkness.

      The DEAD are SLINKING and CRAWLING back into their GRAVES, 
      pulling the EARTH and SOD over them like BLANKETS.

      There is no sign of Elise, but WALTER S BODY lies GUTTED and 
      EMPTY on the grass.

      Montesquino s BODY lies DEAD at Haeckel s feet.

      Haeckel WAKES as a VULTURE (or CROW) tugs at his PANT LEG, 
      just in time to see the last of the DEAD retire.

      It is calm and quiet as Haeckel STANDS UP, reeling.  The DEAD 
      are a memory, and life slowly begins to spring up around us: 
      the distant calls of the MORNING BIRDS and the DRONE of the 
        DRAGONFLIES.


      WITH HAECKEL

      He looks all around him: at the evacuated corpse of Wolfram; 
      at the wide-eyed CORPSE of Montesquino at his feet.

      Life and death are not as he supposed.

      His head throbbing, Haeckel makes his way through the quiet 
      NECROPOLIS.



      Haeckel walks through the heavy iron gate, under the 
      unblinking gaze of the SKELETON that is chained to it.  He 
      pushes the gate closed behind him.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:



      Haeckel emerges before the house, and there is the sweet 
      SOUND of a WOMAN SINGING.  Haeckel stops to listen for a 
      moment, then goes to the door and OPENS it.                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   53.





      Haeckel s SCREAMS fill the otherwise calm and lonely air...

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

                                                                            FADE IN:



      The MOON is FULL and bright above, the OAKS casting long, 
      leering SHADOWS.

      The CAMERA CRANES up and over the GATES, just clearing the 
      watchful grin of the SKELETON.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:



      We make our way through the HEADSTONES and WOODEN CROSSES and 
      SHRUBBERY.  The NIGHT BIRDS are singing, the FROGS bellowing.  
      The NIGHT is coming to life.

      We move past OPEN GRAVES, MOUNDS of DIRT.

      As we move CLOSER, we can hear the distant, familiar, 
      passionate CRIES of Elise, building in intensity.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    "Haeckel's Tale", Pink, 10/17/05   56.

      CONTINUED:3737


      Finally, we drift over the low, crumbling ROCK WALL to find 
      the RING of TORCHES planted in the ground, and reveal the 
      night s RITUAL.

      We make our way up a line of the eager, aroused WAITING DEAD:

      We recognize them as we move past them: Elise s once-handsome 
      FIRST HUSBAND, the CORPSE who was mounting her on the other 
      night; MONTESQUINO, a MUSKET-HOLE in his CHEST; the GUTTED 
      CORPSE of WALTER WOLFRAM, reaching impatiently for his 
      beloved wife.

      But they ll have to wait: the lovely and voluptuous Elise is 
      coupling fervidly with the late, lamented ERNST HAECKEL... a 
      dream at long last realized.

      Haeckel s EYES are wide with sated desire, a dream fulfilled.

      Then: we move in TIGHT on Elise s eager, florid FACE, and 
      follow the simple GOLDEN CHAIN around her NECK to the 
        DISTINCTIVE, FILIGREED LOCKET, dangling at the end.



      Just like Miz Carnation s.

      The LOCKET has fallen open, and facing CAMEO PORTRAITS fill 
      both sides: one of Elise, and the other of her handsome 
      HUSBAND, together forever.

      So romantic.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      It sits calmly nestled in vines.  We now see for the first 
      time that this is the same little house as the WOLFRAM 
      FARMHOUSE, several DECADES later.  

      We CRANE UP and OUT to see the old, overgrown NECROPOLIS in 
      the distance, as MUSIC swells to carry us away into the 
      night.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

                                            THE END
