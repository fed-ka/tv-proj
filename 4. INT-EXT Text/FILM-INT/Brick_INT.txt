A single locker. That same arm, bracelets and all, slips a
note through the slats, then leaves quickly.
As the cage empties a lone figure slumps to the locker.
Opens it. The note falls to his feet.
The figure is Brendan. He unfolds the note (folded in a
triangle) -- "12:30 PICO & ALEXANDER".
A STREET SIGN
Pico and Alexander.2
A WRIST WATCH
12:43.
Brendan looks up from the watch.
Drama people sit on the floor facing the stage. Brendan
steps behind one, the sharp-eyed girl from the picture. She
holds a freshman boy's head in her lap. Pets it like a dog.
She looks back at Brendan, her face in shadow.
GIRL
(through a mocking smile)
Hello, Brendan.
BRENDAN
Kara.
KARA
Come to see the show?
Kisses the freshman's forehead, purring.
BRENDAN
No, I didn't.
(nudges the freshman with his
toe)
Lapdog, blow.
The freshman sits up, looks to Kara like a spooked puppy.
KARA
(to the lapdog)
Stay.
(to Brendan)
Don't be mean.
BRENDAN
I'm all friendly.
(to the lapdog)
Watch your head, kid - that thing bites.
The dog pops up again. Kara pulls him down and nuzzles his
ear.
BRENDAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
I need words.
KARA
I'm listening.
8
BRENDAN
About Emily Kostich.
She stops nuzzling a little too quickly.
KARA
(to the dog)
Get me my purse.
(he goes)
Hurry!
He breaks into a trot. Kara smiles at Brendan.
BRENDAN
Still picking your teeth with freshmen?
KARA
You were a freshman once.
She slides her fingers up his arm. He growls and pushes them
away.
BRENDAN
Way once, sister. You and Em were tight
for a bit. Who's she eating with now?
KARA
Eating with?
BRENDAN
Eating with. Lunch.
Who.
KARA
You're a cutie.
BRENDAN
You gonna tell me?
KARA
Guess you're up from the underneath
then. The whole Jerr thing blown over.
Lucky strikes, you and your partner get
bulled, you come up clean. But I guess
you were always the brains of the
outfit.1
1
One of many instances of an allusion to the Jerr backstory, most of which were
trimmed back in the editing process for clarity. The author has threatened to write it as
a stand alone short story, but probably never will, so in a nutshell: when Brendan and
Emily were still an item she started hanging out with Jerr, a small time dealer. Brendan
didn't approve, so he partnered up with Jerr then ratted him out to Trueman. Emily
found out, and that led to their breakup on the field, which we see in a flashback.
9
BRENDAN
Where's Emily?
KARA
Sometimes I wonder why I dumped you.
BRENDAN
(standing to go)
God.
KARA
I don't know where she's at, Brendan.
BRENDAN
I know you do, so why don't you want me
to find her?
KARA
Maybe I'm looking out for you.
BRENDAN
(going)
Well I appreciate that.
KARA
Brendan... you looking to get back into
things? I could use you.
He is gone.
Behind Kara, the play goes on.
The play is seen in shadow-play through the backdrop.
Brendan slips in through an exit door, crosses the backstage
area and enters the dressing rooms.
Cramped and empty. Pictures of Kara with friends are stuck
in the mirror. Brendan roughly searches drawers, bags,
pockets... nothing. He stops. A red edge behind one of the
photos - the same red card with a mask on it, but whole.
Across the bottom in small print: "Halloween in January -
Call for DETAILS - 555-2394"
Brendan pulls a phone across his desk and dials the number
on the flyer.
10
WOMAN'S VOICE
(over phone)
Hello?
Brendan hesitates.
BRENDAN
Hello, ma'am, this is Tom, I'm a friend
from school. Could I speak to...
He trails off.
WOMAN'S VOICE
(over phone)
Oh, hi Tom. Laura's here, hold on.
LAURA'S VOICE
(over phone)
Yes?
BRENDAN
I'm calling for details.
LAURA'S VOICE
For what?
BRENDAN
Details about the party.
LAURA'S VOICE
Who is this?
BRENDAN
I don't think we've met.
LAURA'S VOICE
Well then I don't think you're invited
to my party. It's a rather exclusive
gathering.
BRENDAN
I can imagine.
(she starts to speak, he cuts
her off)
You should really work on your invite
management. That might be a personal
'room for improvement' area in your
life. But discretion of your invite
sending aside, I have procured a certain
someone's invitation, and would like
details.
A beat of silence.
11
LAURA'S VOICE
You think you're cute, whoever you are.
BRENDAN
Wait'll you get a load of my felt fedora
and spats.
LAURA'S VOICE
Who are you? Or I'll hang up.
BRENDAN
You don't know me - I'll save you some
time.
LAURA'S VOICE
I know everyone and I've got all the
time in the world.
BRENDAN
Folly of youth. Ask whose invitation
I've got.
LAURA'S VOICE
(slightly)
What you said.
BRENDAN
Emily Kostich.
A beat.
LAURA'S VOICE
15 Bush street, up in Stockton Cove.
Buzz 42 at the gate. Nine o'clock. But
who-
Brendan hangs up. He folds his hands under his chin and
stares at the phone, perfectly still. The clock on his desk
says 4:53.
DISSOLVE TO:
7:37
Brendan at his desk, tapping away at Tetris.
DISSOLVE TO:
8:30
The desk is empty, Tetris paused. A shower runs behind an
ajar door in the background.
12
Large and clean, with a two story ceiling and a railed
staircase at one end. Fifteen or twenty clean people, some
in costumes, mill about in cliques. Brendan comes in as if
he doesn't mind who sees him coming in. He gets a couple odd
stares, but no one stops him.
With non obtrusive confidence he cuts through the crowd to
the beer keg in back and draws half a cup.
Richly adorned, crowded, lit with bright pools of light.
Brendan drifts in and stands in the back, deep in shadow.
The music comes from a baby grand piano set against one
wall. Laura Dannon leans against it. She wears a red
kimono, and is striking against the velvet black piano.
Laura's kid sister, 11 years old with glasses, sits at the
piano playing "All I do is Dream of You".
Laura sings, lovely and soft but with strength.1
Brendan watches from the back, his face obscured in shadow,
but his eyes gleam. Through the darkened window behind him
a match flares up, and someone standing outside lights a
cigarette.
Laura finishes the song. The room applauds, and she ruffles
her kid sister's hair.
Brendan ducks out, and into
1
By the time we got around to production this had changed to "Someone to Watch Over
Me," but the publishing rights proved too expensive (i.e. not free.) We chose the Gilbert
& Sullivan song, which besides being lovely was also in the public domain (i.e. free.)
13
Brad Bramish, the jock who was kissing Laura in the parking
lot, sits slouched on the couch in a dense crowd. He holds a
cup and speaks much too loudly to a guy named Biff at his
elbow.
BRAD
If the coach wants to play me I'll play,
but I can't put my best game in if I've
got to worry about whether I'm going to
be in there. Halftime last game, coach
is pissed I ran it on a pass play, out
on the field he says to me 'you gotta
think about the team and you gotta' you
know and 'if you run that ball again
you're out', and I said to him you gotta
let me play! I'm out there, let me play,
and he's saying 'no you're out' and I
kept saying 'Let me play! Let me play!
Let me play!', just right in his face-
BIFF
He was!
BRAD
Just 'Let me play! Let me play! Let me
play!' 'No you gotta' 'No, let me play!
Let me play! Let me play!'
Brad hunches forward, his face swollen purple, yelling that
over and over. Tom steps in front of Brendan, blocking his
line of sight.
Brendan scans the rest of the room. His eyes catch on Laura,
leaning against a divan. Her bright, sharp eyes cut through
the room, straight into Brendan.
He wags his eyebrows at her.
She looks away quickly. Brendan turns back to Brad, still
shouting 'let me play'. Tom stands between them.
BRENDAN
Tom!
Brad falls silent. Most of the room follows suit. Tom turns
around. Brendan smiles good naturedly.
BRENDAN (cont'd)
Could you step aside, please? I'm
trying to follow Brad's story, and it's
difficult when I can't see his face.
14
The room watches Brendan. Tom mumbles something and steps
aside. Brad stares at Brendan stupidly. Brendan flashes a
dopey grin and tips his glass.
BRAD
(stumbles)
He doesn't give me a play to make, what
can I do, you know?
He falls into awkward silence. Biff starts babbling.
Brendan looks at Brad, who is staring back at him.
Brendan then slowly drags his gaze over to Laura, staring at
him too, her eyes slightly amused. Brendan cocks an eyebrow.
The slightest hint of a smile takes the corner of her mouth,
and she wags her eyebrows once at him.
Brendan glances back at Brad, looking at Laura now, not
amused at all.
Brendan stands to go. Biff chatters on. Brad cuts him off.
BRAD (cont'd)
Hey. Hey! What are you doing here?
BRENDAN
Leaving.
BRAD
Oh yeah?
BRENDAN
Uh huh. Unless your anecdote's got a 2nd
act.
BRAD
Why don't you leave?
BRENDAN
(leaving)
That's what I was doing.
With a lit wet bar at one end. Brendan goes to the bar, puts
ice in a glass and cracks it with liquor.
LAURA
(O.S.)
Whiskey?
Brendan pauses, glass touching his lips.
15
BRENDAN
Jameson.
He downs half of it.
LAURA
I like a man who knows what he's
drinking.
BRENDAN
That's a pretty sick thing to be
attracted to.
LAURA
Brad's not a good guy to get on the
wrong side of.
BRENDAN
Uh huh.
They stare at each other in silence. She studies his face.
The broken light of the bar makes her features seem liquid.
LAURA
Fearless flyer. Quit your yappin and fix
me one.
and slips out a sliding glass door.
He fills another glass with whiskey and cuts his with water.
Brendan sits in the back, flipping through the address book.
The teacher drones on about the significance of the pig's
head in "Lord of the Flies".1
THE ADDRESS BOOK
Illegible scribbles, names, numbers, nothing that stops his
search - then the note Dode gave her, a corner of loose-leaf
paper which looks like this:
Brendan studies the paper intently.
Sparsely furnished. Brendan plays Tetris on his computer,
staring off into space. His mom's voice calls "Good night"
and the hallway light turns off.
LATER
10:30 by the clock radio on Brendan's nightstand. The slip
of paper rests beside it. Brendan lies in bed, staring at
the symbol on the paper. His eyes tense.
THE SYMBOL
Growing larger, burning with a searing intensity, then
folding into darkness. Water rushes overhead, over concrete,
concrete with a hole in it -- the runoff tunnel, just for an
instant, then back underwater, screaming. Brendan choking,
screaming, plunging upwards. A woman with no face falls from
the darkness and kisses him, her long hair sweeping around
him then pulling away. As the last strands slide off his
face he wakes up with a start.
The clock says 3:46. Brendan drips with sweat, breathing
raggedly. He takes the paper and a pencil from the
nightstand and shades the symbol to look like this:
FLASH CUT - The runoff tunnel, lining up perfectly with the
now shaded symbol.
BACK TO BRENDAN
28
His eyes turn uneasy as he removes his glasses and clicks
off the light.
Nearly pitch black. 2 sets of running footfalls. Brendan is
chasing, running full speed into the blackness, heart
pounding - we almost don't notice that Brendan's are now the
only footfalls.
Brendan notices. He stops. Silence in the darkness, except
for Brendan's breath... and someone near...
SLAM! Brendan takes a fist in the cheek and goes down. An
inky black figure steps from the shadows and kicks him in
the stomach. Brendan curls on the ground, the figure over
him.
FIGURE
(low whisper)
Your little Em.
The figure runs off. Brendan raises his head painfully - the
figure is silhouetted briefly against the distant bright end
of the tunnel, then is gone.
Warmly lit, sheltering the few souls scattered here and
there at tables. The Brain sits at one of them reading an
impossibly large book. He watches curiously as Brendan
approaches him.
THE BRAIN
Hey, Brendan.
Brendan falls into a chair. The Brain looks him over.
THE BRAIN (cont'd)
You're up early.
BRENDAN
(thick, distant)
I couldn't sleep.
THE BRAIN
(nods, back to his book)
Find Emily?
Brendan breathes out softly.
THE BRAIN (cont'd)
You alright?
BRENDAN
Yeah. What, are you here for zero?
THE BRAIN
Nah, I gotta take the early bus, cause
the others don't run by my street.
BRENDAN
Bad break.
THE BRAIN
Eh. Time to read's nice. So what's the
word with Em?
BRENDAN
She's gone.
THE BRAIN
Can't raise her?
BRENDAN
No, I can't.
THE BRAIN
So what now?
31
BRENDAN
Now. I don't know. I guess it's... I
don't know.
Brendan takes a long moment. He stares down at his glasses,
wet with condensation.
BRENDAN (cont'd)
Brain, I can't let her go. I was set to
but I can't. I don't think I can.
THE BRAIN
You think you can help her?
BRENDAN
No.
THE BRAIN
You think you can get the straight,
maybe break some deserving teeth?
BRENDAN
Yeah. I think I could.
THE BRAIN
Well.
Brendan rubs his forehead.
BRENDAN
Kara tried to rope me. She came right
out and asked. She was scared. Tell me
to walk from this, Brain. Tell me to
drop it.
THE BRAIN
Walk from it. Drop it.
(grins)
You're thick as what-all, Brendan.
BRENDAN
Yes I am.
Brendan cleans his glasses. He looks Brain in the eye, and
his mannerisms come back into focus.
BRENDAN (cont'd)
I'd need you to Op. Like on Jerr, but
that was cake to this. And unlike Jerr,
there's not much chance we'll come out
clean. Twenty four seven on this one.
You okay to op for me again?
32
The Brain barely smiles.
THE BRAIN
What first, tip the bulls?
Brendan puts on his glasses, stands to go.
BRENDAN
No, bulls would gum it. They'd flash
their dusty standards at the wide-eyes
and probably find some yegg to pin,
probably even the right one. But they'd
trample the real tracks and scare the
real players back into their holes, and
if we're doing this I want the whole
story. No cops, not for a bit.
THE BRAIN
So what first?
BRENDAN
I don't know. Your mom still have the
cell?
THE BRAIN
In her car.
BRENDAN
Borrow it for a few days, get me the
number.
(stands to go)
Wait for my word, and cover for me first
period. I'm going to be a little late.
1
Which Joe would not even consider, thank god.
34
Pitch back. Brendan lays the body down. Two beady eyes peer
at him from the darkness - he freezes. The eyes hop forward
- a gull. The two watch each other for a moment, then the
gull squawks and flutters out the bright mouth of the
tunnel. Brendan follows it without looking back at the
body.1
Brendan strides past forest scenery and drama geeks, through
another door and into sunlight.
He spins to see Kara's face just before the door closes.
She's worried.
Brendan sits with an ice pack against his head in a tiny
office. A man in his early thirties behind a wood colored
45
desk and name plate, "GARY TRUEMAN, ASSISTANT VICE
PRINCIPAL" plays with a pencil.
TRUEMAN
You didn't know this boy?
BRENDAN
No sir, never seen him.
TRUEMAN
And he just hit you?
BRENDAN
Like I said, he asked for my lunch money
first. Good thing I brown bagged it.
Trueman trains a good natured dubious eye on Brendan.
TRUEMAN
Alright Brendan. I've been looking to
talk to you.
Brendan doesn't react.
TRUEMAN (cont'd)
You've helped this office out before.
BRENDAN
No. I gave you Jerr to see him eaten,
not to see you fed.
TRUEMAN
Fine, and well put.
BRENDAN
Accelerated English, Mrs. Kasprzyk.
TRUEMAN
Tough teacher?
BRENDAN
Tough but fair.
TRUEMAN
Mm. Anyway then, we know you're clean,
and you've, despite your motives, you've
been an asset to us. I think you're a
good kid.
BRENDAN
Uh huh.
46
TRUEMAN
I want to run a couple names by you.
Brendan stands to go.
TRUEMAN (cont'd)
We're not done here.
BRENDAN
(angry)
I was done here three months ago. I told
you then I'd give you Jerr and that was
that, I'm not your inside line and I'm
not your boy.
TRUEMAN
That's not a very helpful-
BRENDAN
(anger builds)
You know what I'm in if the wrong yeg
saw me pulled in here?
TRUEMAN
What are you in?
BRENDAN
No. And no more of these informal chats
- if you've got a discipline issue with
me write me up or suspend me and I'll
see you at the parent conference.
TRUEMAN
Hold it, I could - hold it - could write
you up for talking back to a VP. For
looking at me in a threatening way. I'd
exercise a little more tact, Mr. Frye.
You can't pull a play like that unless I
need you for something. So do I?
BRENDAN
Maybe.
TRUEMAN
So maybe you're gonna need me too.
BRENDAN
Maybe. Alright, I need you off my back
completely for a few weeks. There might
be some heat soon.
47
TRUEMAN
(interested)
If it's something I can't cover, I won't
go to bat for you.
BRENDAN
If I get caught like that it's curtains
anyway - I couldn't have brass cutting
me favors in public. I'm just saying now
so you don't come kicking in my homeroom
door once trouble starts.
Trueman bites a thumbnail.
TRUEMAN
Okay, here's what I can do. I won't pin
you for anything you aren't caught at.
I'll ride it a little while, as long as
it doesn't get too rough. But if
anything comes up with your fingerprints
on it, I can't help you. Also, if I get
to the end of whatever this is and it
gets hot and you don't deliver, The Veep
will need someone to hand over, police-
wise. And I'll have you. There better be
some meat at the end of this like you
say, or at least a fall guy, or you're
it.
BRENDAN
Sure I am. Got one more favor to ask.
Tug is putting a tape in the deck, eyes down. Behind him
the trunk pops open, then pulls down out of sight just as he
looks back up.
Brendan holds the trunk about three inches open, just enough
to see which street signs pass by. Loud music plays from the
car -- "Sweet Baby James" by James Taylor.1
The car zooms on.
BRENDAN'S POV
Through the ajar trunk. The mustang slides to a stop beside
an elaborate wooden mailbox carved as an eagle's head.
Brendan closes the trunk.
A very dim narrow hall with a steep stairway at one end,
dark doors down the length of it and a lit door at the other
end. Tugger drags Brendan down the stairway, drops him and
goes into the lit room.
1
Unfortunately Mr. Taylor flatly refused, which, given the context, was probably wise.
51
Brendan lifts his head painfully. Surrounding him in the
darkened doorways are dozens of boys, some dressed like
Tugger, others dressed in black.
Tug pokes his head out.
TUGGER
Alright.
Arms pop out of the darkness and drag Brendan towards the
lit room.
A small room, amazingly messy. Clothes strewn about, groves
of empty bottles, precarious piles of books. The overall
impression though is not of jumbled chaos, but of a nest,
comfortably woven and very worn in.
A slim figure with wispy hair sits facing the wall at a
small desk, writing under a green bookkeeper's lamp.
Brendan is shoved into the center of the room. Tug and his
clones slump against the surrounding walls. Brendan watches
the thin figure's back. For a beat the only noise is the
scratching of the thin man's pencil. Then he sighs and
swivels around.
Mid to late twenties. Sallow features, tired eyes. His
clothes are so richly black it is difficult to make out
specific items -- he is just one inky black mass from the
neck down and eyebrows up.
BRENDAN
You the Pin?
PIN
Yeah.
(beat of silence)
So now I'm very very curious what you're
going to say next.
BRENDAN
Maybe I'll just sit and bleed at you.
The Pin shifts in his seat, bored.
PIN
Helled if you're gonna go breaking my
best clients' noses and expect me to
play sandbag. Anyway you've been
sniffing me out before then, sniffing
for me like a vampire bat for a horse
52
with a nick on its ear he can suck on.
They do that.
(Brendan blinks)
So now you got Tugger to bring you here,
which he never does, and you got me
listening, so I'm curious what you've
got to say that better be really, really
good.
BRENDAN
Call Ms. Dannon in from the hall first;
she oughta hear this.
PIN
(amused)
No dice, soldier. Would have been a neat
trick, though.
BRENDAN
(shrugs, then slowly)
I was going to make up some bit of
information or set up some phony deal,
anything so you'd let me walk. Then I
was going to go to the vice principal
and spill him the street address of the
biggest dope port in the burgh.
The Pin's eyes shoot to Tugger, who doesn't flinch.
TUGGER
He knows zippo.
BRENDAN
1250 Vista Blanca, the ink blotter at
the desk in the den in the basement of
the house with the tacky mailbox.
The world turns on its side as Tugger pushes Brendan's head
down into the carpet.
TUGGER
You gonna do what now?!
The Pin walks towards them. One of his shoes is twice the
size of the other.
PIN
No good, soldier.
The cronies around the room begin cackling. Tug's face is a
mask of rage. Brendan can't breath. His face swells.
53
PIN (cont'd)
Alright, let up.
But Tug doesn't let up. Brendan's world grows hazy, the
cackling laughter reverberates, then a clean voice pierces
the din.
LAURA
(OS)
Tug, stop.
Tug's face breaks for a moment, and he lets go. Brendan's
head lolls to the side. Laura stands in the dark doorway.
Brendan sees Tug's knuckles and a flash of white for a split
moment as Tug hits him in the face. The Pin's black body
spills out across the frame, leaving us in black.
FADE UP
SMALL DARK ROOM
Brendan wakes up curled on a mattress on the floor. A bare
light bulb hangs from the ceiling. Tugger sits five feet
away, watching him like a hungry dog. Brendan stares back at
him through thick, glazed eyes.
BRENDAN
Where are my glasses?
(Tugger grins)
Hell with ya then. Which wall's the door
in?
Tug points, amused. Brendan heaves himself up, and Tug
shoves him back down.
Brendan winks at him, stands and lurches towards the door
again.
Tugger grabs his shirt and slams him into the wall, but
freezes when he hears a door latch click. Sneering, he drops
Brendan back onto the mattress and sits against the opposite
wall.
Sounds of a door opening and closing come from the darkness.
Light footsteps clack on the cement floor. Suddenly Tug
vanishes -- the room's darkness just seems to swallow him.
The thin whispery voice of the Pin speaks softly.
PIN
Sorry about this kid, but what the hell
with what you said before.
54
His disembodied face appears a few feet about where Tug had
sat.
PIN (cont'd)
Where you were at, with all of us and
the Tug a fist away, you've got to use
your nut. Allay the situation, So yeah,
you're not scared of me, I got it, but
I'm also thinking you're a little nuts
now, so you've got that trade off with
your standing. But nuts isn't all bad,
so maybe it was a good play. I don't
know.
He is standing in front of Tug. His black clothes and broad
rimmed black hat blend perfectly with the dark room, such
that his face seems to bob about in space. Brendan stifles a
cough.
PIN (cont'd)
So, Laura talked me down. Let's get you
upstairs, back with the living.
Brendan sits at a breakfast table eating cornflakes. The
kitchen is on the first floor of the Pin's house, or rather
the Pin's mother's house. She is a soft old lady in a pastel
cotton dress, currently bent over the fridge mumbling.
MOTHER
I thought we had orange juice, Brendan,
I'm sorry. How about Tang, or that's
more like soda isn't it, or not soda but
it hasn't got any juice in it, it can't
be very fortifying.
BRENDAN
Water's fine, ma'am, thanks.
MOTHER
Now just a moment, we have apple juice
here, if you'd like that, or milk,
though you've got that in your
cornflakes, I don't know if drinking it
as well might be too much.
BRENDAN
Apple juice sounds terrific.
MOTHER
It's country style.
55
BRENDAN
That's perfect.
She shuts the fridge. Tugger and the Pin sit behind her,
looking comfortably bored. The Pin, a sharp black hole
against the soft yellow kitchen, eats oatmeal cookies with
small delicate bites.
MOTHER
I'll even give it to you in a country
glass, how'd that be? Boys?
TUGGER
I'm fine, Mrs. M.
PIN
Thanks, mom.
The Pin kisses her on the cheek.
MOTHER
Okay, well I'm going to go, um, do
something in the other room now...
She shuffles out.
PIN
(to Brendan)
So hows bout we take another snap at
hearing your tale?
BRENDAN
I don't know. It starts out same as
before, and this floor ain't carpeted.
PIN
We're cooled off.
BRENDAN
Yeah well, your muscle seemed plenty
cool putting his fist in my head. I want
him out.
The Pin grins thinly, uncomfortable.
PIN
Looky, soldier-
BRENDAN
The ape blows or I clam.
56
TUGGER
(stands violently)
So clam! What've you got I can't beat
out of you back in the basement?
The Pin and Brendan are perfectly still, watching each
other.
PIN
Give us a few minutes, Tug.
Tug turns to him, but Pin keeps his eyes on Brendan.
PIN (cont'd)
I'll call you if whatever.
Beat. Tug stomps off, slamming the narrow door hard behind
him. The Pin goes back to gnawing his cookie.
PIN (cont'd)
So?
Brendan sets down his spoon.
BRENDAN
About a year ago I had a small time
dealing partnership with Jerr Madison.
Know him?
PIN
Till he took the fall for you.
BRENDAN
Yeah well. I didn't ask him to, but he
was a straight player. I got out clean -
almost. Nothing on my official record,
but the VPs play it like I owe them one.
When I made it clear I wasn't playing
their hound dog, well they didn't like
it. They keep calling me in, badgering
me.
PIN
Gee that's tough.
BRENDAN
I don't like being told whose side I'm
on. So now they think I'm on your trail,
I'm in a nice spot to know their
movements and feed them yours.
PIN
I gotcha.
57
BRENDAN
You haven't got me yet.
PIN
What, price?
BRENDAN
Considering the benefits my services
could yield, I don't think that's
unreasonable.
PIN
And what are your services exactly, just
so I can be specific on the invoice?
BRENDAN
(shrugs)
Whatever serves your interests.
The Pin stands.
PIN
Fair enough. I'll have my boys check
your tale, and seeing how it stretches
we'll either rub or hire you. You'll
know which by end of the day tomorrow.
Brendan stands but doesn't follow as the Pin opens the
narrow door Tugger went through and descends the dark stairs
behind.
PIN (cont'd)
We're done.
The moment the Pin vanishes into the basement's murk Laura
comes up out of it. She takes Brendan's hand.
LAURA
I'll drive you back.
They zig zag though the twisty suburban streets. Brendan
stares sullenly into space.
BRENDAN
Just drop me at school.
(they take a hard turn)
How long was I out?
LAURA
Half an hour. It took all of it for me
to cool the Pin down.
58
BRENDAN
(flatly, but sincerely)
Thanks.
They drive on in silence.
Brendan pushes through the gloom, past forest scenery,
deeper and deeper until he comes to a door.
Hazy and cramped. Everything blends into the color of flesh.
No walls are visible; it is all billowy piles of costumes.
Brendan pushes in. Kara sits at the mirror, putting on
eyeliner.
KARA
(sing song)
Brendan Brendan Brendan!
BRENDAN
Where's Dode flopped?
(she makes a face)
I know you two are cozed up, so you'll
tell me or you won't.
KARA
Oooh, getting feisty.
(giggles)
Last time we talked you were giving
ultimate-tims.
60
BRENDAN
It worked. You went to Laura, didn't
you? Told her my tale.
KARA
All part of your plan?
BRENDAN
Turned out to be.
KARA
I feel so cheap and used.
BRENDAN
Gol, I must seem a real cad. Sometimes I
just hate myself.
Kara grins dreamily.
KARA
Whatever happened to us, Brendan?
BRENDAN
Where's Dode flopped?
She turns to face him.
KARA
We were a pair and a half for a few
months, weren't we? Sometimes I miss
having someone I can talk to. You ever
miss having someone? I guess you must.
Brendan's face is a mask.
BRENDAN
I need to hear Dode's tale about Emily.
It's important.
KARA
(darkly)
You better be sure you wanna know
whatcha wanna know.
Brendan stands, coughing.
BRENDAN
Uh huh. Laura's working with me now, and
I'll have the Pin and Tug in my corner
soon. The sooner I get the truth from
Dode or the truth about Dode from you,
the safer you'll both be. No? Pass it on
to Dode anyway. Maybe he'll have the
61
sense to get out from under you before
he gets hurt.
KARA
You didn't, did you?
Brendan leaves without looking back.
Brendan's at his desk, on the phone.
THE BRAIN
(on the phone)
So what happens now?
BRENDAN
Now we wait for the Pin's answer. Unless
his crew spotted VP Truman's social call
this morning, it'll be yes. I'd give us
70/30. If we're in I get under his skin
and see what's what. You stick to Kara,
keep your specs peeled for Dode and stay
away from Laura.
The Brain is quiet for a beat.
THE BRAIN
I think she's with us, Brendan.
BRENDAN
(too sharp)
I'll let you know when she is.
A beat of silence.
THE BRAIN
Okay.
Brendan gently replaces the receiver and sits for a moment
in silence.
Brendan sits beside the Pin. The windows are tinted and the
car is very dark. The seats are pink vinyl. The car lurches
forward.
Brendan and the Pin are silent for a beat, not looking at
each other.
BRENDAN
So?
PIN
So. Tangles.
A stocky kid in the front seat turns, and reaches into his
jacket. For a moment he stays like that, hand in his jacket,
eyes on Brendan. Brendan's face is placid.
Tangles pulls out an envelope and drops it in Brendan's lap.
PIN (cont'd)
That's what you'll get every week for
your services. Less of course there's a
specific job involved, in where you get
sliced in with my crew. Square?
BRENDAN
Yeah.
Silence. The Pin holds his hat in his hands, fingering the
rim.
PIN
We're doing a thing down at the Hole
tonight. Know it?
65
BRENDAN
South of T Street, yeah.
PIN
It's sort of a welcome you in thing.
Eight o'clock.
The car stops.
The clock radio blinks 5:34. The phone is ringing. Brendan
half wakes and puts it to his ear.
THE BRAIN
(on the phone)
Don't go to class.
BRENDAN
What?
THE BRAIN
Fifth period Trueman and the VP come in
asking for you.
BRENDAN
Agh.
THE BRAIN
Did they call your mom?
BRENDAN
Probably. I got home late.
THE BRAIN
Get out of there too, then. Meet me
behind the library. I've got some stuff.
Empty. Brendan crosses the warped linoleum and gently opens
the narrow basement door. He descends into inky gloom.
Deathly still and silent. Barely breathing, Brendan goes to
the lit doorway at the end of the hall.
Empty. Brendan floats through the room like a ghost, to the
Pin's desk.
Slowly, then with greater confidence he rifles through it -
papers and trinkets, meaningless.
He reaches beneath the desk, knocking it gently with his
knuckles. Quickly he removes the top drawer and reaches down
into the desk frame.
Brendan draws out a stack of hundred dollar bills two inches
thick. He pulls out another. Another. Another. Thumbing the
stacks -- pure hundreds.
Something creaks in the hallway.
Brendan freezes. Silently he replaces the money and drawer,
his eyes on the doorway. He creeps towards the door on the
balls of his feet.
Still empty. Brendan creeps towards the stairs, passing
other doorways, all open but for one. He stops for a moment,
listening - silence.
73
Brendan enters the room - pitch black but for a small high
window. Brendan pulls the curtains aside. A beam of sunlight
spills just enough light to reveal a figure in the dark.
Brendan jumps back, and his reflection in the large mirror
jumps as well.
A white bird nesting in the window flutters into the dark
room.
Brendan walks the large mirror into the beam of light,
reflecting it around the room like a flashlight. More junk,
a mattress, then a strangely bare corner with a single white
lump in it. The white bird stands behind the lump, its dark
eyes caught in the bare light.
The bird flies out the window.
Brendan goes to the white lump, a small brick of white
powder. White chalky residue patterns the floor -- there
were other bricks there before.
Behind Brendan, in the mirror, something moves. Someone
else, in the room.
Tugger. He throws Brendan across the room, then heaves him
into a wall.
TUGGER
What with the poking, genius?! Maybe
you're poking for your bull friends!
BRENDAN
Don't be a sap. I can't even face up at
school, the VP's so hot for me.
TUGGER
Yeah well. Maybe you're looking to make
good.
BRENDAN
I'm looking to find this big game the
Pin's played, not to gum it, but just so
when its tail jams in my back I'll know
who to bill for the embalming.
TUGGER
You oughta ask him what you wanna know.
BRENDAN
I did. He didn't tell me.
74
Tug loosens his grip. Brendan gasps for air.
BRENDAN (cont'd)
When a gee I'm paid to side with won't
give me the straight that makes me
nervous. Makes me angry.
Tug draws back a bit.
TUGGER
Yeah, well. That's understandable.
Tug sets a country glass of orange juice in front of
Brendan. He paces.
TUGGER
There was ten of them. I don't know
where he picked them, he didn't tell me.
BRENDAN
(sympathetic)
Huh.
TUGGER
So we get ten kils of brock, there aint
enough marks in the whole burgh to eat
that. So he unloads eight of em up way
north, even up to the docks. I don't
know who.
BRENDAN
Didn't tell you.
TUGGER
Yeah. That was eight. So that's the
tenth in there. We gotta break it into
doses, sell em off round the high, maybe
some by Shorecliffs.
BRENDAN
What about the ninth brick?
TUGGER
Ah yeah. There were problems with that.
BRENDAN
Yeah?
TUGGER
It, uh...
75
He stops, thinking harder than he's used to. His scar
reddens slightly, then he jerks out of his trance.
TUGGER (cont'd)
(quickly)
It disappeared. Someone skimmed it. We
started raising hell with all the likely
suspects, and whatayaknow, it came back.
But it came back bad. One of ours took a
dose off the top, and it laid him out.
BRENDAN
Frisco.
TUGGER
Yeah, poor Frisco. You heard about that.
We'll track down the rat. Just takes
time.
BRENDAN
I heard something fell with Emily
Kostich.
TUGGER
Emily who?
BRENDAN
Kostich.
TUGGER
Don't know her.
BRENDAN
Huh.
A quiet pause. Tug's scar reddens a bit more.
TUGGER
Has the Pin talked about her?
BRENDAN
Not to me.
TUGGER
Yeah, he might know something. Ask him.
Tell me what he says, cause if you heard
something, you know, I wanna check.
BRENDAN
Sure.
The screen door swings open -- enter the Pin. If he's
surprised he doesn't show it.
76
PIN
Pow wowing?
BRENDAN
Just shooting the shat.
TUGGER
Yeah, just shooting it.
PIN
Good.
His big foot clunks on the linoleum. He eyes a very sick
looking Brendan.
PIN (cont'd)
You alright, soldier?
Brendan moves a hand dismissively, sniffling.
PIN (cont'd)
So, Tug, I got a call. Someone who says
they know something about Emily.
TUGGER
Emily?
PIN
Emily Kostich. Where she's at now. Says
we'd want to know. Wants to meet.
TUGGER
(uncomfortable)
Yeah?
PIN
So we'll meet him. Four o'clock.
(to Brendan)
Emily was Tug's girl for awhile. You
know Emily, didn't you?
BRENDAN
A while back.
PIN
You've heard she's missing?
BRENDAN
Yeah, I heard that.
PIN
So maybe you want to come along too.
77
BRENDAN
What has Emily got to do with you?
PIN
(looks at Tugger)
Show, maybe we'll find out.
He gives a slip of paper to Tugger.
PIN (cont'd)
Four o'clock.
Tugger glances at the slip, then slides it to Brendan. It
has the symbol drawn in pencil:
A horn honks outside.
BRENDAN
That's my ride.
The Pin calls after him as he leaves.
PIN
Four o'clock.
and sits up with a jolt. Laid out in the back seat, Laura
dabbing his head with a wet napkin.
BRENDAN
(barks shakily)
What time is it?
LAURA
Lie down, Brendan-
BRENDAN
What time-
LAURA
You've got a fever, you've got to go to
the hospital or-
BRENDAN
What time is it?
LAURA
Three forty. You've got to rest, you're
feverish.
He throws himself out of the car.
Brendan sits up in the bed. Tugger sits in a chair bedside,
smoking. Brendan watches him for a long moment in the room's
dim light.
TUGGER
She sprung it on me, just. That's a hell
of a thing to spring on a guy. I don't
remember much. Laura talked me down
after, said whatever, she knew her, said
it wasn't true, but I still think
sometimes. I think bout it being true.
Bout it being mine. And maybe I did it
cause I thought it was true. A hell of a
thing.
Brendan stares at him through cold, empty eyes.
TUGGER (cont'd)
You up? You weren't doing too good there
for awhile. Laura said take you, you
know, hospital, but I couldn't.
BRENDAN
What's the stats?
86
TUGGER
Everyone's just laying low. You're here
with us, at my folks place. They're
gone. The bulls got Dode fore the tide
took his body.
BRENDAN
Tide?
TUGGER
Yeah, strong tide, would've taken the
body, like out to sea. It can do that.
But the fuzz got there first.
Brendan nods.
TUGGER (cont'd)
So everyone's assuming it's war, but no
one's said it yet. Everyone's lying low.
BRENDAN
War?
TUGGER
You're with us.
BRENDAN
The hell I am.
Brendan swings his legs over the bed. Tug steps in front of
him, staring him down.
BRENDAN (cont'd)
Alright, I'm with you.
TUGGER
So just lie low. Sleep some more. Laura,
she said you should sleep.
Tugger exits. Brendan runs his fingers through his hair,
steps into his shoes and hobbles out of the room.
About ten more kids dressed like Tug are cleaning guns.
Brendan nods to them.
BRENDAN
Hey.
87
They nod back, not paying much attention as he goes out the
front door.
Brendan kicks in the door. Kara sits in front of the mirror
in a soft pink robe, a boy on the floor beside her. She
gasps.
KARA
Brendan. Did you hear about Dode?
BRENDAN
You scheming tramp. You set that poor
kid up, you hid him, fed him your tale.
You got info from Laura and held Dode
like a card till you could play him. For
money!
Brendan throws a chair. The boy stands.
KARA
I don't know what you're talking about.
BRENDAN
You'd bury me at the same time, but it
was mostly for the money. You got Dode
thinking Em had his kid, thinking I did
it, and that was enough for him, but he
stuck to the money cause you had your
claws in him, cause he couldn't come
away from the deal without it and make
you happy.
KARA
Sit down, you're a mess. Russ, go get my
shoes from the wardrobe locker, would
you sweetie?
89
He goes, trying to look mean at Brendan. Brendan and Kara
watch each other like caged rats.
KARA (cont'd)
Still wish you knew what you wanted to
know? If it's any consolation, it
probably wasn't Dode's kid. It might
have been Tug's, but frankly I wouldn't
bet a horse - it was a crowded field
there at the end.
Brendan grabs a clock and throws it. Kara's mirror shatters,
revealing a grimy dark wall behind.
KARA (cont'd)
Meany. You want my tale, Brendan? I
still know what Dode was selling, but
I'd play it smart. A quick call from a
payphone to copland, they drag the
tunnel and you're through.
She comes very close to him. Her robe falls open slightly.
KARA (cont'd)
Five thousand. Cash. I know you can get
it from the Pin, but even if you can't I
want it by first period tomorrow, or I
play my hand and bury you.
She turns away, lets her robe fall.1
KARA (cont'd)
Now get out.
Brendan's eyes burn. He lunges at her.
Laura drives, Brendan stares at the passing lights.
LAURA
What's going to happen?
Brendan coughs.
92
LAURA (cont'd)
Do you feel better?
BRENDAN
(weak)
I don't know.
Brendan stumbles in. Tug's hands grab him roughly.
TUGGER
For a smart guy you aint too smart. I
said lay low.
Laura enters.
LAURA
Tug.
He drops Brendan. Laura kneels beside Brendan, feeling his
forehead.
BRENDAN
She was at the Pin's.
TUGGER
Yeah, she's our go-between.
BRENDAN
Uh huh. So here's the sit. You and the
Pin are going to pow wow, four o'clock
tonight, his place. Take all the muscle
you want, you won't need it. He wants to
talk straight, and you're going to work
with him for whatever he needs, cause
you don't want war.
TUGGER
Hell I don't.
BRENDAN
The Pin's sitting on the brick profits -
hitting him now would be post. Make
peace and wait for your chance.
LAURA
He's right, Tug. Smooth it out.
93
BRENDAN
(between coughs)
Besides, he's got you on the Dode thing.
War'll mean you vs. him and every bull
in the burgh.
Tugger turns away, thinking.
TUGGER
Yeah, we'll talk.
LAURA
(to Brendan)
You going?
BRENDAN
Yeah.
She nods. Brendan stumbles into the bedroom.
Brendan lies on his back. Sweat stands on his forehead.
THE FAN
Spinning dizzily from Brendan's POV. Then the fan is still
and the room is spinning, then the fan, then the room.
Brendan clamps his eyes shut. A door creaks open.
BRENDAN
(croaks)
Go away.
Laura floats across the room to him. Her hair falls around
him. Brendan shrinks back. She puts a pale hand on his
clammy forehead. Brendan tries to speak, but cannot.
He fingers slide over his face. She pulls off his glasses.
Her hands all over his face. Brendan's throat contorts in a
hard swallow. His eyes are wet.
Her hair, her hands all warm and gentle, touching him.
LAURA
I'm sorry Brendan.
Brendan breaks. In silent sobs first, then shivering with an
almighty release he cries like a baby in her arms.
THE FAN
94
Spinning above them.
Laura lights a cigarette. They lie beside each other.
LAURA
Don't go tonight.
BRENDAN
I've got to make sure it plays out
smooth.
LAURA
It'll play however it plays without you
there.
BRENDAN
I've got to make sure.
LAURA
Why?
BRENDAN
Cause if there's war, I'm in it too.
LAURA
Well let's just, I mean why not just run
away. Go somewhere. I've got a car.
(Brendan gives a wry look)
I've got an aunt in New Orleans, she
wouldn't care.
(Brendan grins)
Yeah, it's a stupid thing, but think
about it, why not? What, school? C'mon.
Family?
BRENDAN
Alright, stop.
Her smoke drifts into the fan.
LAURA
I wasn't serious, but we could go for
awhile. Just until everything clears.
Brendan watches the smoke. She stubs the butt out in an ash
tray on the table and curls against his chest.
Stretching his arm across the table, he nonchalantly spins
the ash tray around with his finger.
His glasses lay on the table. Through the left lens the
cigarette is magnified. Pale blue arrow on the filter.
95
Laura's arm stretches across his chest. He looks at it, then
up at the fan, spinning.
LATER
Brendan slips out of bed. A glowing clock radio reads
"3:16".
A swarm of silent activity. Tug's flunkies prepare various
weapons. Brendan goes to Tug.
BRENDAN
Tell your boys no knuckle business.
TUGGER
They're just ready.
BRENDAN
Your folks left a car here?
TUGGER
Yeah.
BRENDAN
Take it and Laura's.
(Brendan tosses Tug the keys)
I'll go first in yours.
TUGGER
The hell-
BRENDAN
I'll take the scenic route to draw off
any tailers. They'll think it's you,
they might even radio back that you're
alone. Get it?
TUGGER
Mr. Smarts.
He tosses Brendan his keys.
BRENDAN
Alright. Got a cigarette?
TUGGER
No. I don't smoke.
BRENDAN
I've seen you smoke.
96
TUGGER
I don't smoke cigarettes.
BRENDAN
Give me fifteen minutes, then go.
Crowded with tense looking punks, half dressed like the Pin
and half like Tugger. The Pin's mom is shuffling about,
pouring them milk.
Several more punks from both camps crowd the hall, and more
lean in the darkened doorways. Brendan passes through
quickly.
The Pin at his desk, flanked by two of his boys. Tug sits in
the center of the room, two of his punks beside him. Brendan
saunters between them and leans against the dresser.
BRENDAN
Talk.
PIN
I want full assurance that any heat from
Emily and Dode is gonna be on just you.
I don't even want my name pulled in the
shindig. Second, you owe me six Cs, no
rush, but I want your shake that it'll
come home in not too much time.
Tug's eyes burn, his scar reddens.
BRENDAN
(to Tug)
That's square. You did them after all.
Lay low it'll blow over. Stick on this,
one of you'll dish it to bury the other
and you'll both get the rap. As to the
six, did you borrow it?
TUGGER
Yeah.
BRENDAN
Then you owe it. Shouldn't need a shake
on that.
Tug looks at the Pin.
TUGGER
Alright to both.
98
BRENDAN
Good. Let's seal it up and blow for
keeps.
PIN
Third thing. The last brick.
Brendan looks up sharply, taken off guard.
BRENDAN
It's yours.
PIN
That aint the point. I'm gonna start
selling it. How do I know it aint bad?
BRENDAN
Why would it be?
PIN
Why was the last one? Cause someone got
greedy. Tug here's had the means to
swipe half and cut it bad for a long
time. Now we're splits my loss of
trust's retroactive.
BRENDAN
Did you, Tug?
TUGGER
(eyes hot on the Pin)
No.
BRENDAN
Alright, so let's shake and blow.
PIN
Not good enough.
Tug shoots to his feet, kicking away his chair.
BRENDAN
What would be good enough?
PIN
I wanna see him dose it. Just to prove
it. Then we're square.
TUGGER
Hell for that! I didn't touch your junk,
that's it.
99
PIN
I wanna see it.
TUGGER
To hell!
PIN
Your not wanting to dose it's telling me
something right here.
TUGGER
Yeah, it better be! It's telling that
I'm out from your thumb, that I aint
playing lapdog to no gothed up cripple
no more!
Everyone in the room is on their feet.
Brendan steps
forward.
BRENDAN
I'll dose it.
All eyes to him, unbelieving.
PIN
What?
BRENDAN
If it'll shut you two apes up I'll
take
the dose, and if I don't die we're
all
right as rain, and if I do die you
two
have your war, so long as you keep
it
off my grave. Deal?
PIN
Fine.
Tangles.
BRENDAN
Johnny, go with him.
They go.
Tug just stares at Brendan, then tosses his hands up
slightly and turns away.
They all wait.
CRASH! from the next room. Everyone freezes. More breaking,
then scuffling and shouting.
The two punks look at their bosses, then run out. Tug starts
to follow, but Brendan holds him back.
100
The noise through the wall grows tremendous, a full brawl.
The ceiling pounds and shudders with footfalls and bodies
hitting the ground.
Then, from not too far away, a gunshot.
The Pin stands and goes towards the door, but Brendan shouts
BRENDAN (cont'd)
No!
and slams it shut. A few tense seconds.
Another gunshot. Footfalls, then Tangles falls through the
door, his chest red. The Pin bends over him.
TANGLES
(gasping)
The brick, it's gone. The brick's gone.
Tangles stops gasping.
The Pin stands, eyes blazing at Tug.
PIN
Make peace, huh? Talk it out? Get your
boys in my den soes you could snag it
under my nose?
Tug's scar is fiery red. He coils his body, snarling.
TUGGER
Alright!
BRENDAN
No, that's not-
PIN
Was it bad, Tug? Snag it so I don't
know, or sell it off to flat the war
odds?
BRENDAN
(shouts)
Pin, think about it-
TUGGER
Alright, I did all that!
Tug blows past Brendan like a train and slams the Pin into
the ground with his fist. He punctuates his words with hard
straight blows into the Pin's face.
101
TUGGER (cont'd)
I cut the brick, I stole the money, I
faked a peace, I snagged your junk, I
did it all!
He pulls the gun.
Brendan shouts and throws himself on Tug's arm, wrenching it
sideways. The gun clunks onto the carpet.
The Pin flips Tug
over and for a moment Brendan is caught
between them, hit
and torn, rolling over the gun. Tug grabs
it, Brendan grabs
his wrist and the gun goes off, firing
into the ceiling.
Plaster sprays.
Brendan screams, thrashing wildly, and manages to slip out
of his bloodied jacket and out from between the two.
The Pin is on top, pinning Tug's gun hand to the carpet,
straining to keep it there.
Brendan leaps to his feet, staggers, then winds up and kicks
Tug in the wrist with all his strength.
A terrible crunching popping sound. Tug roars. Brendan takes
the gun from his limp hand.
PIN
Do him!
Brendan backs off a few steps. The Pin strains to keep Tug
down.
PIN (cont'd)
Do him now!
Brendan stumbles back. Tug roars, flips the Pin over and
beats his face mercilessly.
Brendan stumbles out into the hall.
Empty. From the darkened doorways and the thin ceiling
relentless sounds of fighting.
Brendan walks backwards as if in a trance, eyes glued to the
Pin's door. Inside wild shadows splay across the walls, and
the Pin shouts Brendan's name.
Light flashes from another darkened doorway and the wall
beside Brendan splinters. Brendan spins on his heel and
fires three shots into the darkness, which falls silent.
102
He turns the gun back on the Pin's doorway.
With a spray of sparks the doorway turns dark. They broke
the lamp.
The dark doorway looms up before Brendan, inky black.
Horrible sounds come from it, blows, breaking bone, screams.
The Pin screams Brendan's name over and over, calling for
help. Pleading. Brendan steps back.
Time slows down. Brendan drops the gun.
It thunks on the carpet.
In one motion Brendan kicks the gun down the hall into the
Pin's doorway, turns and runs into the room where he found
the brick.
Dark. Brendan runs through, clawing past dark fighting
shapes, running like a man possessed. He breaks through the
darkness and heaves himself up through the small window.
