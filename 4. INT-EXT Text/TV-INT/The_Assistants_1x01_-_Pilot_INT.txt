                                  MIKE

                Thanks again for this opportunity. 

                                  LIDDY

                Well, when I got your resume with the 

                Short Pump, PA address it just whoosh! 

                brought me back to when Ali and I lived 

                there.  Before Daddy uprooted us all to 

                chase Ali s dreams of stardom ha ha!

                                  MIKE

                I ve seen every movie your sister s been 

                in.  It s such an honor to be working for 

                her. (QUICKLY) And you.  Both of you.

                                  LIDDY

                No, I know Ali s the star.  People say, 

                oh you have to live in your sister's 

                shadow.  I say, no, I'm living in her 

                shade.  And it's very pleasant, thank 

                you!

      SHE LAUGHS.  MAYBE A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

      THEY LAUGH, BUT LIDDY TRAILS OFF AND MIKE FEELS OBLIGED TO SAY:

                Oh good.  Phew! (THEN) So, as I told you 

                in the interview, while ultimately you 

                work for Ali, your official title is

                I did have to work hard to convince Ali 

                and her husband Gale that I should have 

                my own assistant.  So I need you to make 

                me look good!  Don t screw up! 

      SHE LAUGHS, SO MIKE LAUGHS.

                                  LIDDY (CONT D)

                                  LIDDY

                Misses is upstairs.  She is loudly 

                  wondering where the new coffee is.

                It s not here?!  Where s Scott?

      MIKE WATCHES AS HE SNEAKS ACROSS THE ROOM, SURVEYING THE AREA

      BEANS, STANDS BACK, CONSIDERING, THEN PULLS THE DOOR NEXT TO 
      THE TABLE OPEN, HIDING THE BAGS.  SATISFIED, HE TURNS -- AND

      WHO S THIS?  SCOTT SHAKES HIM OFF: NOT NOW.  THEY DO THIS RIGHT 
      IN FRONT OF MIKE.  ACROSS THE ROOM, LIDDY FINDS THE BEANS.

                ticket.  Then I remembered my brother s 

                an orthopaedic surgeon and I have to 

                steal soup from my bosses.  Break break!

      SCOTT HAS TO PUT HIS WEIGHTS DOWN.  DJ JUST HOLDS HIS.  

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)

                  Twenty-six s gonna be my year, man: gonna 

                sell some of my photography to somebody 

                other than you or Tina.  Get people to 

                read my blog.  Other than you and Tina.  

                Have sex with that super-tall Persian 

                chick who lives below us.

                                  DJ

                Or even talk to her.

                                  SCOTT

                (LUSTY) Yeah.  Talk to her all night 

                long.  (THEN) Okay, you ready?

      SCOTT PICKS UP HIS WEIGHTS WITH A GRUNT AND THEY CONTINUE ON.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      MIKE IS PLUNGING.  TINA PASSES BY, NOTICES MIKE AND ENTERS.

                                  TINA

                Sorry, New Guy.  Want me to take over?  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        20.


                                  MIKE

                I don t mind.  Although I think there s 

                a Dora the Explorer jammed in there.  

                Kinda bumming me out. (INTO TOILET) I m 

                coming for ya, amiga!

      TINA LAUGHS.  MIKE LIKES MAKING HER LAUGH.  

                                  TINA

                So why d you move out here?  Other than to 

                tap into the thriving toilet care market.

                                  MIKE

                Hey, this is a step up from working for 

                my dad.  Asbestos and mold removal. 

                (SMOOTH) That s right, asbestos and mold.  

                Can I buy you a drink?

      TINA LAUGHS.

                                  MIKE (CONT D)

                Telling him I was quitting the family 

                business and moving out here was the 

                hardest thing I ve ever done.

                                  TINA

                How d he take it?

                                                                      FLASHBACK TO:


      TWO HAZMAT SUITED FIGURES ARE ON AN ASBESTOS REMOVAL JOB. 

                                  FIGURE ONE (DAD)

                                  FIGURE TWO (MIKE)

                People on the internet like my videos.  

                They literally hit a button that says 

                like.

      A THIRD, SMALLER, HAZMAT SUITED FIGURE STEPS UP.

                                  FIGURE THREE (MOM)

                He can move back when it doesn t work. 

                                  FIGURE ONE (MIKE)

                Thanks for the vote of confidence, Mom.

                                  FIGURE THREE (MOM)

                If.  If it doesn t work. (TO DAD) When.

      A DERISIVE LAUGH REVEALS A FOURTH HAZMAT SUITED FIGURE.

                                  FIGURE THREE (MOM) (CONT D)

                Don t you laugh at your brother, Duane!

      DUANE PUTS HIS HEAD DOWN.  MIKE S FAMILY EXITS.  MIKE PULLS 
      OFF HIS MASK, RUBS HIS FACE WEARILY, THEN REALIZES THERE'S 
      ASBESTOS ON HIS MOUTH, PANICS AND SPITS --

                                                                              BACK TO:


                                  MIKE

                  (TOUCHING LIP) Still tingles a little.

                                  TINA

                So you make comedy videos?

                                  MIKE

                I do!  That s why I m here.  Can t just 

                keep filming stuff in my parents  

                  basement.  Which, by the way?  Crawling 

                with mold.  I just figure, if I don t at 

                least try, I ll always regret it.

                And this, getting to work for Ali friggin 

                Vance, are you kidding me?  Connections, 

                a foot in the door.  I just, yeah, I m 

                doing it.  I m chasing the dream.

      A MOMENT AS MIKE S PASSION FILLS THE AIR, THEN:

                                  MIKE (CONT D)

                This would be a more rousing speech if I 

                wasn t trying to fish Dora s corpse out 

                of a toilet.

      LIDDY RUNS IN.  

                                  LIDDY

                I just heard Ali laughing!  We have our 

                window!  Let s go!  Let s go!

                                  MIKE

                Oh -- okay, (RE TOILET) I haven t --

                                  LIDDY

                That can wait!  Come on!

      MIKE RUNS OUT WITH LIDDY.

                                  TINA

                  (CALLING) Hey, uh, New Guy?

      MIKE RETURNS.  TINA TAKES THE PLUNGER FROM HIM. 

                                  MIKE

                Thanks!

                                                                              CUT TO:


      LIDDY AND MIKE RUNNING...

      GOING DOWN THE STAIRS TWO AT A TIME...

                                                                              CUT TO:


      HURRYING PAST DJ AND SCOTT, WHO ARE LUGGING MORE WEIGHTS.  
      LIDDY THEN STOPS ABRUPTLY AT A DOOR - HE ALMOST RUNS INTO HER.  

                                  LIDDY

                Okay.  Remember, you need to make us 

                both look good.  No pressure! (OFF HIS 

                NERVOUS STRAIGHTENING) You look great.  

                Just relax.  Smile. (OFF HIS SMILE) Oh, 

                not that much!

      HE SMILES LESS.  THEY ENTER A GYM WHERE ALI VANCE, 39, PRETTY 
      AND SELF-INVOLVED (THINK SARAH JESSICA PARKER), IS DOING YOGA.

                                  LIDDY (CONT D)

                  ( CASUAL ) Oh -- Ali.  I thought I heard 

                you laughing in here.

      CONCENTRATING ON HER YOGA, ALI BARELY LOOKS UP.

                                  ALI

                  Laughing?  Why would I be laughing?

      LIDDY BLANCHES AND TURNS TO MIKE.

                                  LIDDY

                (SOTTO) Window s closed!  Out!  Get out!

                                  ALI

                  (CALLING) Get me a water Scott.

      LIDDY CRINGES.  SHE TURNS BACK, PUTTING ON A SMILE.

                                  LIDDY

                Actually this is Mike, my new assistant.  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        24.


                                  ALI

                (LOOKS AGAIN, LAUGHS) Oh my god!  You 

                  assistants all look alike to me!  I mean 

                you don t look like Scott but it s just -- 

                (SIMPLY) assistant!  That is so funny!

      SHE LAUGHS AGAIN.  SO LIDDY LAUGHS.  SO MIKE LAUGHS. 

                                  LIDDY

                Mike s from Short Pump, remember?

                                  ALI

                Right.  How are things back in the Pump?

                                  MIKE

                You re definitely still loved there.

                                  ALI

                What do you mean, still?  Still like 

                 Her last movie bombed but we still love 

                her, the poor thing  still?

                                  MIKE

                Oh!  No!  No, no!   Still  like, Ali 

                left 20 years ago but we still brag 

                about her. (CELEBRATORY) Still!

      LIDDY AND MIKE WAIT TO SEE IF THIS ANSWER FLIES.  IT DOES.

                                  ALI

                Aww.  You tell the good people of Short 

                Pump I still love them, too. 

                                  MIKE

                I will!  And by the way your last movie 

                  definitely didn't bomb in Short Pump! 

                (THEN, REALIZING) Or anywhere!!  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        25.


      HE CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY.  ALI TURNS TO LIDDY.

                                  ALI

                He s so cute!  Can we keep him?

      LIDDY GIVES MIKE A SECRET THUMBS UP.  HE EXHALES, RELIEVED.

                                                                              CUT TO:

                Liddy, remember when we went back to 

                Short Pump and they had a parade?

                                  LIDDY

                You actually didn t bring me.  Which, 

                pssh, I was so fine with.

                                  MIKE

                I was there, got the day off from school.

                                  ALI

                  I thought you looked familiar!  Not 

                really -- there were so many people!  

      THEY LAUGH.  GALE ENTERS.  HE GIVES ALI A KISS ON THE CHEEK.

                with his Gale Force plans yet?

                No -- not boring, by the way -- but no.  

                (JUST TO ALI) Although I was gonna see if 

                you could maybe call that guy for me 

                today about lining up investors?

                                  ALI

                You'd think right now you'd be focused 

                on the 10th anniversary of AliCares.  

                But I guess after five years of marriage 

                you want to start doing your own thing.

                                  ALI

                  Actually, Liddy, you think it d be 

                alright if Mike drove me?  

                                  LIDDY

                You bet!  Whatever you want.

      MIKE SEES THE OTHER ASSISTANTS EXCHANGE SIDEWAYS GLANCES.

                let s go, grab my stuff, chop chop.

      MIKE CROSSES AND AWKWARDLY TAKES ALI S THINGS.  DJ DOESN T 
      LET GO OF IT EASILY.  MIKE HURRIES TO CATCH UP WITH ALI.  

                                  ALI (CONT D)

                You ever been in a car that costs more 

                than a hundred thousand dollars?

                                  MIKE

                Until today I d never been in a house 

                that costs more than a hundred thousand 

                dollars.

      ALI EXITS.  MIKE LOOKS BACK, THEN FOLLOWS HER OUT.

                                  LIDDY

                (TO DJ) Plunger s upstairs.  Get to it.

      ALI NOTICES MIKE S CAR OUT HER WINDOW.

                                  ALI

                Uch, look at that.  Someone abandoned 

                their car in front of my house.

                                  MIKE

                  Actually... that s mine, sorry.  I ll 

                park it down the block from now on.

                                  ALI

                Don t be silly.  You just keep doing the 

                job you re doing and you won t be driving 

                that car for long.

      MIKE CAN T HELP BUT BEAM.

                Good!  Clint Eastwood told me to get the 

                hell out of his parking space! (THEN) Or 

                it was just a mean old man.

                really are interested in what is  s up.   

                Just not sure.

      AND SHE EXITS.  DJ AND SCOTT GLARE AT MIKE.  HE MAKES SURE 
      THE COAST IS CLEAR, THEN:

                (SOTTO) Listen, I'm sorry I got you

                people who can help me do something with

      VARIOUSLY TITLED:  PURPLE,   A SORTA SMILEY FACE BUT NOT 
      REALLY,  AND  BLACK LINE WITH SMUDGE OF YOGURT.   SCOTT EXITS

                                  LIDDY

                Mike, I need you to pop over to the dry

                We probably shouldn t keep doing that.

      TOO LATE.  BEHIND ALI, PHILO S FIGURED OUT THE FINGER GUN.

                                  DJ

      LIDDY STANDS BEFORE ALI AND GALE, WHO ARE ON STAIRMASTERS.  

                                  ALI

                If he s introducing guns into my home, 

                what s he going to do next?

                                  LIDDY

                He didn t exactly --

                                  GALE

                Admit it, Lid, you picked a loose cannon!  

                Makes me question your judgment. (THEN) 

                Ali, I love your sister.  As a sister.  

                But as a house manager...?

      GALE SHRUGS SADLY, THEN GLANCES AT LIDDY, RELISHING THIS. 

                                  LIDDY

                Remember back in Short Pump, Ali-bun?  

                The day you lost the part of Eliza 

                  Doolittle to Vicky Parnell?   THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        43.

                (AS IF YESTERDAY) Oh, that bitch.

                                  LIDDY

                Yeah.  You came home and cried and 

                broke that key bowl?  

                                  ALI

                (UCH) Vicky Parnell.

                                  LIDDY

                But what happened next, Ali?

                                  ALI

                I broke that mirror in the kitchen.

                                  LIDDY

                  (PATIENTLY) But what happened next?

                                  ALI

                  (REMEMBERS) ...Mr. Topley-Griggs called.

      GALE WATCHES, WARILY.  WHERE S LIDDY GOING WITH THIS?

                                  LIDDY

                Your drama teacher called.  Lifted you up 

                when you were just starting out, when you 

                needed it most.  Ali, you can be that 

                someone for Mike.  He needs his Mr. 

                  Topley-Griggs. 

      A BEAT.  THE DRAMA OF THIS APPEALS TO ALI.

                                  ALI

                (SIGHS) I ll give him another shot.

                No, Ali, come on -- 

                                  ALI

                Gale, it seems like all you re doing 

                lately is thinking about yourself!  

                First with Gale Force and now with your 

                little competition with my sister.

      IT S LIDDY S TURN TO SNEAK GALE A LOOK WITH RELISH.

                                  GALE

                No, I -- Ali... if I m only thinking 

                about myself... then why am I planning a 

                thing here tonight to honor AliCares s 

                10th anniversary?  Hm?  Answer me that. 

                                  ALI

                (BEAT, TOUCHED) Really?

                                  GALE

                It was gonna be a surprise but Liddy 

                forced my hand.  Thanks, Lid.

                                  ALI

                Aww.  Come here, you...

                  ...Because I want Jose and Pilar to have 

                a piece of Scott s cake, too.

                                  DJ

                You really are too nice.  When you end 

                up snapping, it s gonna be awesome.

      MIKE ENTERS AS TINA PUTS THE CAKE IN THE FRIDGE.  THERE S 
      STILL TENSION FROM THE DAY BEFORE.

                (OFF THEIR LOOKS) Liddy told me I need to 

                get a win with Ali today so I want to get 

                her a certain bottle of Pinot Noir.

                A win? (SIGHS) New Guy.  

                                  DJ

                  (ANNOYED) There s no winning with them.  

                There s just... getting paid to lose. (TO 

                TINA) That s a good name for my band!

      GALE ENTERS, DICTATING TO SCOTT, WHO FOLLOWS BEHIND.

                                  GALE

                ...So round up a few of the poor bastards

                those charity cases getting drunk in the 

                house.  In fact, let s have it in the 

                  backyard. (TO OTHERS) Listen up.  I m 

                gonna need all of you to work late for a 

                thing I m doing for Ali.

      TINA TURNS AND MOUTHS  MINI GOLF?  TO SCOTT.  HE SHRUGS.  

                                  TINA

                  Actually, Gale, we have plans tonight.

                                  GALE

                Oh I wish you had told me earlier.  Then

                Looks like you dodged a bullet this 

                morning. (CHUCKLES) Dodged a bullet.

      HE FINGER SHOOTS MIKE AND EXITS.  TINA LOOKS AT SCOTT.

                                  TINA

                Why do you put up with that?

                                  SCOTT

                Because no one will buy my photography 

                yet and I m a dirty whore for money!

                                  DJ

                We ll go go-karting some other time.

      SCOTT NODS AND THEY START OUT ON THEIR DAYS. 

                                  TINA

                  (QUIETLY) No.

                What?

                                  TINA

                (WITH GROWING PASSION) No.  We re going 

                  go-karting.  Today.  You have to have 

                time that s yours!  That s not his!  Or 

                hers!  It s your birthday, Scott!  And on

                No!  This is me snapping!  Damnit! 

                                  DJ

                Still nice.

                                  TINA

                Philo has Mommy Time with Ali for 

                another 57 minutes. (TO DJ) Which means 

                we re both okay  til then. (TO SCOTT) 

                And Gale will think you re off getting 

                ready for tonight.  We re doing this.  

                Right now.  We have to do it fast, but 

                we have to do it.  So let s go!

      SCOTT TURNS TO DJ TO HELP TALK HER OUT OF THIS.  

                                  DJ

                Let s go, dude.

      SCOTT NODS TOWARD MIKE, WHO S TRYING TO STAY OUT OF IT.

                                  SCOTT

                How we gonna keep Ali and Gale from 

                finding out with Mikey-leaks over there?

                                  TINA

                New Guy won t say anything.  

                                  DJ

                He s gonna be too busy trying to get a 

                 win  with Ali.

      SCOTT DELIBERATES A BEAT, THEN:

                                  SCOTT

                  Gentlemen, start your engines! (RAISES 

                ARMS IN VICTORY, THEN) I am still sore!  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        49.


      THEY EXIT, HURRIEDLY BUT HAPPILY.  MIKE MAKES A CALL.

                                  MIKE

                Yes, I was wondering if you had a 2004 

                Calera Pinot Noir?...  Great!  How much 

                is it? (YIKES) How much is the 2005?...  

                2006?...  No -- it s fine.  I ll be by.  

      HE HANGS UP AND EXHALES: EXPENSIVE, BUT WORTH IT.  HE NODS, 
      FEELING A LITTLE BETTER.  HE LOOKS AROUND, FAMILIARIZING 
      HIMSELF A LITTLE, CHECKING OUT THE SECURITY MONITOR, OPENING 
      A CUPBOARD OR TWO.  HE COMES TO A DOOR OFF THE KITCHEN. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


      MIKE FLIPS ON A LIGHT, REVEALING A MASSIVE WINE CELLAR.  
      FLOOR TO CEILING BOTTLES.  LIKE THE END OF  RAIDERS,  BUT 
      WITH WINE.  MIKE JUST STANDS THERE, FEELING VERY SMALL, THE 
      GOOD FEELINGS OVER HIS  WIN  ALREADY EVAPORATING.

                                  GALE (O.S.)

                Scott!

      GALE IS AT THE BACK DOOR AS MIKE HURRIEDLY RETURNS.

                                  GALE

                Scott!  Strap on your man pants and get 

                those weights back outside!  I gotta get 

                me some color for tonight!

                                  MIKE

                Uh... he s not here.

                                  GALE

                What do you mean?  Where is he?

      MIKE TAKES A MOMENT, CONSIDERING WHAT TO SAY, THEN:  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        50.


                                  MIKE

                He s... in the bathroom.  So he s here, 

                just not right here, here.  But I ll 

                start moving the weights and he can join 

                me when he s... finished.

      MIKE HESITATES, WONDERING WHAT HE S GETTING INTO.

                                  GALE

                Well, get moving, Sissy Spacek!

      MIKE HURRIES OUT, PASSING ALI, WHO ENTERS, FOLLOWED BY PHILO.

                                  ALI

                Philo, I know this is our special time 

                but Mommy has to get ready for an extra 

                special night tonight.

      ALI TRIES TO LOOK THROUGH DRESSES BACK FROM THE CLEANERS.

                I m booored!

                will take you to the zoo today!  

      PHILO PULLS THE DRESSES DOWN.

                                  ALI (CONT D)

                No, honey -- zoo!  Today!  And tomorrow!  

                Zoo!! (CALLING) Tina!  I need to stop 

                Mommy and Me a little early!  Tina!

      MIKE HURRIES IN WITH WAY TOO MANY WEIGHTS, BARELY UPRIGHT.

      GALE RUNS IN AND SEES THE WEIGHTS ON THE FLOOR.

                                  GALE

                What did you do to my weights?!

                                  MIKE

                They re okay - my feet broke their fall!

      LIDDY HURRIES IN.

                                  ALI

                Where s Tina?  Where s DJ?  

                                  GALE

                Where s Scott?

                                                                      QUICK CUT TO:


                                  LIDDY

                (GLARING AT MIKE) Where are they?

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        52.



      THEY ENTER BUT STOP SHORT -- ALI, GALE AND LIDDY ARE STANDING 
      THERE, WAITING.  MIKE IS BEHIND THEM.  

                                  LIDDY

                Mike told us everything.

      THE ASSISTANTS CAN ONLY STAND THERE, SCREWED, BUT THEN --  

                                  ALI

                  (BURSTING) Thank you so much!

      AND SHE HUGS THEM!  THEY STAND THERE, FROZEN SMILES ON THEIR 
      FACES, NOT KNOWING WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING.

                                  MIKE

                They realized you guys were all out and 

                were wondering where the heck you were.

                                  GALE

                I called you a little jack-hole, Scott, 

                and for that I apologize.

                                  MIKE

                I tried to cover for you, but they 

                forced me to tell  em the truth.  That 

                you were out trying to find a gift for 

                the AliCares anniversary.

      THE ASSISTANTS TRY TO HIDE THEIR SURPRISE AND RELIEF.

                        TINASCOTT

      Oh, you told?You stinker.  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        53.


                                  ALI

                And I said a gift was so not necessary!  

                That you baked me a cake is gift enough!

      MIKE HOLDS UP SCOTT'S CAKE, WHICH READS  CONGRATS ON 10 YEARS 
      OF ALICARES!   THEY LOOK AT HIM WITH AWE AND APPRECIATION. 

                                  GALE

                And isn t it your birthday, Scott?

                                    DJ/TINA

                Is it?/Oh, Happy Birthday!

                                  ALI

                You deserve a big slice of my cake!

      A HAPPY MOMENT.  SMILES, LAUGHS... WHICH FADE, THEN: 

                                  ALI (CONT D)

                DJ, I need Ming to come over and walk on 

                my back.  This day s been so stressful.

                                  GALE

                Scott, (RE: MIKE) Petunia Party-Dress 

                here started moving my weights back 

                outside but I think he chipped a nail 

                so I need you to help him.

      ALI, GALE AND LIDDY START OUT.  BACK TO WORK.  AS SCOTT AND 
      DJ FOLLOW, THEY PASS MIKE AND WHISPER WITH APPRECIATION:

                                  SCOTT

                (SOTTO) We eat the caramels.

                                  DJ

                (SOTTO) The dogs don t mind if you take 

                a little nap on walkees.

      THEY EXIT, LEAVING MIKE WITH TINA.   THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        54.


                                  TINA

                Wow, where did that come from?

                                  MIKE

                I think I got my win.

      TINA SMILES, THEN REALIZES MIKE IS OUT OF SORTS.

                                  TINA

                What?

                                  MIKE

                This job, this is my only connection to 

                what I want to do, to where I want to 

                go.  But now I find out it s working for 

                a petty, insecure lunatic -- the hero of 

                my hometown! -- who actually looks good 

                compared to her steroidal psycho of a 

                husband who I also get to work for.

                                  TINA

                (SADLY SINGS) Hoo-ray for Hollywood...  

                (THEN) Yeah, you re working for 

                  psychopaths.  But you re working with us.

      SHE GIVES HIM A CUTE LITTLE FINGER SHOT.  A NICE MOMENT 
      BETWEEN THEM, THEN MIKE GRIMACES.

                                  TINA (CONT D)

                Now what?

                                  MIKE

                I m pretty sure I broke my feet.

      AS MIKE HOBBLES WITH HER OUT THE DOOR.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        55.



      SCOTT AND DJ ARE HEADING OUT FOR THE NIGHT.

                                  DJ

                C mon, you said it -- this is your year!

                                  SCOTT

                So, what, I just knock on her door and be 

                like  Hey, super-tall Persian chick, it s 

                your Facebook stalker, come on up for a 

                drink to celebrate my birthday.   

                                  DJ

                Yes!  Her status still says  It s 

                  Complicated  right?

                                  SCOTT

                As of eighteen minutes ago.

      MIKE ENTERS.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)

                Hey, we ll see you over at our place?  

                All the beer you can drink.  

                                  DJ

                Oh, on your way over, you should stop 

                and pick up all the beer you can drink.

                                  MIKE

                  Actually, I got this wine today. (HANDS 

                IT TO SCOTT) Happy Birthday. 

                                  SCOTT

                Cork.  Nice. (THEN) Thanks, man.  

                                  DJ

                Heads up, dude!  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        56.


      DJ THROWS A CARAMEL TO MIKE.  MIKE CATCHES THIS ONE.  SCOTT 
      AND DJ EXIT.  TINA CROSSES THROUGH.

                                  MIKE

                So I m going over to Scott and DJ s.

                                  TINA

                Cool, me too.

                                  MIKE

                Oh, good, me too. (SIGHS)

                                  TINA

                I ll see you there, New Guy.

      TINA EXITS.  MIKE WATCHES HER GO, A BIT MOONILY, THEN UNWRAPS 
      THE CARAMEL AND POPS IT IN HIS MOUTH.  HE STANDS THERE A 
      BEAT, ENJOYING IT.  

      UNBEKNOWNST TO HIM, ON THE SECURITY MONITOR BEHIND HIM WE SEE 
      TINA AND DJ ON THE STREET.  THEY GLANCE UP AT THE CAMERA AND, 
      THINKING THEY'RE OUT OF VIEW, SNEAK A QUICK KISS.  

      HAPPILY UNAWARE, MIKE PICKS UP HIS BAG AND EXITS.

                                        END OF SHOW
