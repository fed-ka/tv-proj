    A YOUNG BOY (eight years old, blonde hair) being rousted from 
      sleep by his MOM (late-twenties.)

      She s scared.  She levels her gaze at her son:

                                  MOM
                    He s here.

      The boy s face goes cold.  As he hurries out of bed, we hear 
      the muffled sounds of FRANTIC BANGING at the front door.

      We re in the BOY S BEDROOM -- it s small, simple.  Not a lot 
      of decorations -- nothing that would indicate time or place.

      Someone desperately wants in this house -- we hear his ANGRY 
      VOICE yelling offscreen --

                                  VOICE
                    Open the door --

      And this all plays FRANTIC -- the BANGING and the YELLING 
      continue throughout the scene, keeping tension at a fever 
      pitch.

      Mom looks around, trying to figure out what to do.  Her hands 
      shake slightly -- she s rattled.

      We re CLOSE ON THE BOY -- we see all this from his POV: his 
      Mom quickly makes the boy s bed.  As she does so:

                                  MOM
                    He ll think you re still with your 
                    grandparents...

      She looks at him:

                                  MOM (CONT D)
                    Get under the bed.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       2.
      (CONT'D):11


      He doesn t move.  She gets down on her knees, looks him in 
      the eyes.  Tries to speak to him in a calm voice.

                                  MOM (CONT D)
                    Listen to mommy.  Get under the 
                    bed.  Don t make a sound.  Don t 
                    come out.

      WHAM!  There it is again -- whoever it is, he s trying to 
      break down the front door.

                                  MOM (CONT D)
                          (still focused on her son)
                    No matter what happens -- don t 
                    come out.
                          (beat)
                    Okay?

      ON THE BOY as he steels himself, trying to be strong.  He 
      nods.  She kisses him.

                                  MOM (CONT D)
                    I love you.
                          (then)
                    Go.

      He scrambles under the bed.  WE STAY WITH HIM as he turns 
      around, looks out:

      HIS POV from under the bed -- his mom s bare feet walk across 
      the WOODEN FLOORBOARDS of his bedroom.  She walks out of the 
      room, closes the door.

      ON THE BOY

      He s breathing hard.  We plays this all on him as he listens 
      intently: WHAM!  He tenses at the sound.  WHAM!  He tenses 
      again.

      And then, with an earsplitting CRASH! the front door GIVES 
      WAY.  We hear the wood splinter as the man KICKS THE FRONT 
      DOOR IN.

      We hear a flurry of YELLING -- their MUFFLED VOICES 
      overlapping -- impossible to make out.  But he s SHOUTING.  
      She s PLEADING.  Then --

                                  MOM (O.S.) (CONT D)
                          (screaming)
                    What the hell are you --*

      BANG.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       3.
      (CONT'D): (2)11


      The boy jerks as a GUNSHOT RINGS OUT.  We hear his BREATH 
      CATCH in HORROR.

    A quick succession of shots follow -- bang bang bang bang.

      And then SILENCE.

      PUSH IN on the boy.  He s terrified -- we hear his sharp, 
      quick BREATHS.

      As he looks out from under his bed, we hear the sound of 
      BOOTS walking across the hardwood floor.  The boy s eyes go 
      wide.

      HIS POV -- as the door to his room opens -- CREEAAK -- and A 
      MAN steps into the room.  We see only HIS BOOTS, and as he 
      walks, each step RINGS OUT on the hardwood floor.

      The boots walk right up to the bed, then turn around, as the 
      man SITS DOWN on the bed.  CRREAK -- the bed sags under his 
      weight, forcing the boy even closer to the ground.

      He looks up toward the sagging bed above him as we hear --

      CLICK -- the sound of a gun being COCKED.

    A few tension-filled beats and then...

      BANG.


      SAWYER jerks awake.  He s in a COLD SWEAT.

      And we put it together: He was the boy.  We re CLOSE ON HIM 
      as he gasps for air at the intensity of the nightmare.

      We watch him go through the motions: looks around, breathing 
      hard, slowly realizes where he is.  It was a nightmare...

      And then -- something RUSTLES.

      Sawyer freezes.

      HIS POV -- the shadows around him START TO MOVE.

      Something is in his tent with him.

      Sawyer backs up against his tent.  In the shadows, we see the 
      DARK OUTLINE of his predator.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       4.
      (CONT'D):22


      Whatever it is, it s BIG.  Eight-hundred pounds of animal.  
      Slowly moving RIGHT TOWARDS HIM.

      Sawyer reaches out, grabs a FLASHLIGHT, SHINES it to see a 
      huge glimmering brown eye.  With his other hand he grabs a 
      HEAVY SCRAP of airplane wreckage -- some sort of HYDRAULIC 
      ROD, perhaps.  As the beast moves towards him, Sawyer SWINGS 
      with all his might.  CUT TO:


    A hotel room door crashes open as Sawyer and a WOMAN 
      (thirties, attractive) tumble into the dark room.  They re 
      ALL OVER each other, making out like horny teenagers.

                                  SAWYER
                      Sweetness, I ain t the one 
                    tremblin  here --

      And if this feels a bit familiar, it should.  Sawyer s in his 
        professional con man form.  As they kiss passionately, 
      crashing down on the bed:

                                  WOMAN
                    I can help with the investors --

                                  SAWYER
                    -- we re not talkin  about this --

      He kisses her, acting as though he wants nothing to do with 
      this conversation.  She kisses back, rolls on top of him:

                                  WOMAN
                      Seriously, baby -- look at me --
                          (beat)
                    How much money do you need, 
                    exactly?

      It s a beautiful moment for a con man and his prey.  But it s 
      interrupted when a VOICE across the room says:

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Okay, this is really awkward...

      Sawyer and the woman JUMP IN SURPRISE.  They turn toward the 
      voice...




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com          LOST      "Outlaws"         (PINK)          1/4/05        8.
      (CONT'D):66


      And FIND A MAN sitting across the room at the table.  He s 
      been there the whole time, sitting in the darkness.

      He TURNS THE LIGHT ON, and we get a better look at him: This 
      is HIBBS.  He s mid-thirties.  Tough, but not as tough as 
      Sawyer.*

                                  HIBBS
                    ...but if I don t say something 
                    now, things are liable to get 
                    downright embarrassing.

      Sawyer leaps to his feet, the woman huddles behind him.

                                  SAWYER
                          (eyes narrowing)
                    Hibbs --

                                  HIBBS
                    Hello Sawyer.
                          (to Woman)
                    Ma am -- I must apologize.  I 
                    figured my good friend Sawyer 
                    here d be alone.
                          (back to Sawyer/dead 
                            serious)
                    I just need a few minutes.

      Sawyer keeps his iron gaze locked on Hibbs.  It s clear -- 
      these guys have history.  After a beat, Sawyer turns toward 
      the woman, pulls her aside.  They speak in HUSHED TONES.

                      SAWYERWOMAN
      Listen ---- what s going on --

      Go down to the bar, get a -- Sawyer --
      drink --

      She looks over his shoulder -- Hibbs is admiring the hotel 
      artwork.  As Sawyer opens the door to the room:

                                  SAWYER
                    Soon as I get rid of him I ll find 
                    you and explain everything.  I 
                    promise.

      He kisses her, ushering her out the door.

      We re WITH HIBBS as the door shuts. He walks towards Sawyer --





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       9.
      (CONT'D): (2)66


                                  HIBBS
                    Gotta hand it to you, Sawbucks.  
                    How you find women that beautiful 
                    to work your --

      WHAM -- Sawyer GRABS HIBBS by the throat and SLAMS HIM up 
      against the wall.

                                  SAWYER
                    Now, if I m not mistaken, Hibbs --

      He SQUEEZES HARD.  Hibbs gasps in pain.  Whatever Sawyer s 
      doing, it looks like it hurts.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    I m fairly certain I said I d kill 
                    you if I ever saw you again.

                                  HIBBS
                          (between gasps)
                     s why I m here... make things 
                    right...

      Sawyer holds a beat -- then releases his grasp, shoves Hibbs 
      aside.  Hibbs shakes it off, clearly in pain.  As he regards 
      Sawyer.

                                  HIBBS (CONT D)
                     Sides -- we both know you ain t 
                    the killin  type...

      He composes himself, reaches into his jacket, pulls out a 
      LARGE ENVELOPE.  Tosses it on the table.

                                  HIBBS (CONT D)
                    There --
                          (points to envelope)
                    Figure that makes us even for the 
                    Tampa job.*

                                  SAWYER
                          (still fuming)
                    Now Hibbs.  What could possibly 
                    make us even for the Tampa job...*

                                  HIBBS
                    Oh, I don t know...

      Hibbs takes a beat, clearly enjoying the moment.

                    How  bout the known whereabouts of 
                    the man who ruined your life?

      Sawyer s face goes cold.  He looks at the envelope.

                                  HIBBS (CONT D)
                          (beat)
                    I m gonna make myself a drink.  You 
                    want one?

      Sawyer shakes his head, walks over to the table, sits down.  
      Hibbs opens the MINIBAR.  As he pours himself a drink, we  *
      notice Hibbs is missing his LEFT RING-FINGER just above the  *
      first knuckle (why?  That s another episode, my friends...) *

                                  HIBBS (CONT D)
                    You remember Old Man Parks, right -- 
                    ran capper for us on that gig in 
                    Atlanta.

                                  SAWYER
                    What about him?

                                  HIBBS

                          (beat)
                    So last week, one of his regulars 
                    gets a little too sauced, starts 
                    running his mouth about his glory 
                    days as a grifter...

      Sawyer opens the envelope -- pulls out a FILE.  On top of 
      which is a PHOTO.  A MAN IN HIS LATE-FIFTIES.  Shot with a 
      LONG LENS, SURVEILLANCE-STYLE.

      leafs through the file, we see various FORMS -- police

      CLOSE ON A VERITABLE ARSENAL of HANDGUNS spread out on a  *
      table in a private room in the back of the shop.*

      Sawyer pulls out an ENVELOPE, starts counting out AUSTRALIAN  *
      DOLLARS.  Into the hands of LAURENCE, a gun dealer.*

                                  LAURENCE*
                    -- nice enough fella.*

                                  SAWYER
                    He s a son of a bitch.

                                  LAURENCE
                    Right.  Indeed he is.

      Laurence nods, picks up a WEAPON.  Hands it to Sawyer.

                                  LAURENCE (CONT D)*
                    Few disclaimers.  First off -- 
                    Australia doesn t allow its 
                    citizenry to own handguns.  You get 
                    nicked with that --

                                  SAWYER
                          (without looking up)
                    I ain t gonna rat you out.

                                  LAURENCE
                    Secondly -- no refunds.  Even for 
                    dear friends a  mine such as 
                    yourself.  You decide you don t 
                    need a weapon -- not my bikker.

                                  SAWYER
                          (as he counts)
                    Won t be a problem.

                                  LAURENCE
                          (studying him)
                    Been doin  this a while... a man 
                    buys a compact .357 with hollow 
                    point loads -- he ain t lookin  to 
                    scare, or steal... he s lookin  to 
                    kill.

      And Sawyer stops counting for a moment, locks eyes with 
      Laurence.

                                  LAURENCE (CONT D)
                    And that s all well and good to 
                    talk about in the beautiful Sydney 
                    Harbor, but when it comes down to 
                    it he may find he doesn t have what 
                    it takes to do the job...

                                  SAWYER
                    Your sales pitch needs some work.

                                  LAURENCE
                    I m sayin  -- you point a gun at a 
                    man, you look him in the eye -- you 
                    find out who you are.
                          (beat)
                    And if you should find that you re 
                    not a killer -- well...

                    There s no refunds.

      Sawyer looks at Laurence for a beat, then hands him the 
      money.  As he picks up the weapon and the box of ammo:

                                  SAWYER
                    Won t be a problem.

      JACK AND CLAIRE in the caves.  Jack has his fingers on her  *

                                    CLAIRE*
                          (looks around)*

                    Next best thing.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I have a friend back home -- she s 
                    really into holistic medicine -- 
                    the whole  hospitals are evil, keep 
                    things natural  bit...
                          (beat)
                    She d love this place.

                                  JACK
                          (grins)
                    Any nausea?  Headaches?

      She shakes her head.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Has the baby been moving at all?

                                  CLAIRE
                          (nods)
                     S like he s running laps in there.

      Jack removes his fingers from her wrist.*

                                  JACK
                    Well if he s as strong as your *

                          (beat)
                    How are you holding up otherwise?

      And we re on Claire for a beat as she hesitates, then:

                                  CLAIRE
                    Okay.

                                  JACK
                    Memory coming back?

                                  CLAIRE
                    In bits and pieces.
                          (beat)
                    Certain people... seem familiar.  
                    Like I ve met them before in 
                    another life.

                    Helps, more I talk about it.  
                    Brings things into focus, you know.

      She shuffles a bit, getting at what s bothering her:

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    But... everyone s avoiding me.

                    I think I freak them out.  I m  the

                    Is that so?*

                                  JACK*
                    Minus the heroic part.*

      Claire smiles as Jack says in his most comforting tone -- *

                                  JACK (CONT D)*
                    Give  em time.
                          (beat)
                    They re just... confused.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yeah, well...
                          (beat)
                    I know how they feel.

      OFF CLAIRE, trying not to show how alone she feels --

      OVER BLACK WE HEAR:

                                  FEMALE VOICE*
                    Don t come out.  Don t make a 
                    sound.

      ON A GUNSHOT we CUT IN to the FLASHBACK we saw at the 
      beginning of the Teaser: Young Sawyer s under the bed, we 
      hear the quick succession of shots -- bang bang bang bang.

      And then SILENCE.

      PUSH IN on young Sawyer.  He s terrified -- we hear his 
      sharp, quick BREATHS.  As he looks out from under his bed, we 
      hear the sound of SOMETHING walking across the hardwood 
      floor.  The boy s eyes go wide.

      HIS POV -- as the door to his room opens -- CREEAAK -- just 
      like we saw before...*

                                  WHISPERED VOICE (O.S.)*
                    I was gonna pay...*

      But then, instead of boots, we see THE HOOVES OF A BOAR walk 
      in through the bedroom door.*

                                  KATE (O.S.)
                    -- Sawyer --


      CLOSE ON SAWYER as he TOSSES BACK A SHOT of something dark 
      and dirty --

                                  SAWYER
                    Again.

      WIDEN to find him bellied up to a BAR.  Dingy.  Sawdust on 
      the floor.  Immediately get the feeling that we are in the 
      armpit of Sydney -- You come to this place to DRINK.  Still, 
      THE AUSTRALIAN BARTENDER eyes Sawyer warily --

                                  BARTENDER
                    You sure about that, mate?




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Outlaws"    (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    12/10/04       43.

                                  SAWYER
                          (I m fucking sure)
                    Again.

      On Sawyer.  ANGER.  SELF-LOATHING -- more than usual.  And so 
      the bartender fills the shot glass again.  That s when --

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    You tell him, cowboy.  These 
                    bastards think Americans can t hold 
                    their liquor.

      The VOICE comes from the man sitting at the bar next to him 
      (who, at this point, is out of frame.)  Sawyer glances at 
      him, then tosses back his shot --

                                  SAWYER
                    Again.

      This time, the Bartender fills the glass without protest as 
      The VOICE (does it sound somehow familiar?) comes again --

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hate to put my hand out -- but I 
                    can t seem to find my wallet.  Any 
                    way you could...?

                                  SAWYER
                          (to the bartender)
                    Set him up.

      In the FOREGROUND, the Bartender sets up a glass.  POURS.  A 
      HAND reaches in (okay, why aren t we SHOWING this guy?), 
      folds around it, APPRECIATIVE --

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    I drink to you.  What s your name, 
                    cowboy?

                                  SAWYER
                    Sawyer.

      The hand raises the GLASS --

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    To Sawyer.  May he find whatever 
                    he s looking for at the bottom of a 
                    glass.

      And this -- hopefully -- is one of those moments where people 
      lose their FUCKING MIND.  Because we follow the glass up to 
      the lips of...

      CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD.  Jack s father.

      And for the loyal fans of the show with an astute enough 
      memory, we re probably realizing right now that this might be 
      Shephard s last day on Earth.

      For the rest of us?  Well, we ll figure it out eventually.

                                  SHEPHARD
                    So, Sawyer -- what brings you to 
                    Sydney?

                                  SAWYER
                    Business.

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Three PM on a Tuesday afternoon and 
                    you re throwing back bourbon.
                          (smiles)
                    That s my kind of business.

                                  SAWYER
                    What brings you to Sydney?

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Furthest I could run.
                          (beat; then)
                    Know why they call Australia  Down 
                    Under?    Cause it s as close to 
                    hell as you can get without getting 
                    burned.

      Sawyer actually SMILES at that one.  If this guy only knew.  
      To the Bartender --

                                  SAWYER
                    How about you leave the bottle, 
                    Slim.

      The Bartender obliges.  Sawyer pours two more shots.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    What s your handle -- back in the 
                    States?

                                  SHEPHARD
                    I...
                          (downs the shot)
                    Was a Chief of Surgery.

                        SAWYERSHEPHARD
      Was?
                                                  -- Was.

                                  SAWYER
                    So we re in hell, huh?

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Not in.  Just close.  Or maybe on 
                    our way.

      Sawyer shakes his head --

                                  SAWYER
                    Speak for yourself.

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Don t let the air conditioning fool 
                    you, son.  You re here, too.  And 
                    you re suffering.

      ON SAWYER.  Bingo.  And Shephard knows it.

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    Hey -- Don t beat yourself up about 
                    it.  It s fate.  Some people are 
                    supposed to suffer.  It s why the 
                    Red Sox ll never win the damn 
                    Series -- They re made to suffer.

                                  SAWYER
                          (defiant)
                    I ain t made to do anything.

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Okay.  Then let me ask you 
                      something, Sawyer -- Do you have 
                    the means to end it?

                        SAWYERSHEPHARD
      What the hell are you --?!?
                                                  -- Your suffering.  Do you 
                                                  have the means to put it to 
                                                  rest?  Make it go away?

      Sawyer is NAILED again.  His look says it all.

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    Yeah.  Me too.
                          (drinks)
                    But we don t end it, do we?

      Shephard slides a little closer.  And this does NOT play 
      drunk.  In fact, it s extremely lucid.  Plain.  And SAD.

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    I have a son -- about your age.  
                    He s not like me.  He keeps it 
                    simple, does what s in his heart.  
                    A good man.  Maybe a great one.
                          (beat)
                    Right now, he thinks I hate him.  
                    That I feel betrayed by him.  But 
                    what I really feel?
                          (hard to say)
                    Is gratitude.  And pride.  Because 
                    what he did to me?  For me?  It 
                    took more courage than... 
                          (there isn t a word; so)
                    There s a payphone over there.  I 
                    could pick it up, call my son.  And 
                    I could tell him all this.
                          (beat)
                    And I could tell him I love him.
                          (beat)
                    One simple phone call and I could 
                    fix... everything.  I could take 
                    away his suffering.

      ON SAWYER.  Taken by all this.  Affected by it.  So he asks 
      the question we all want the answer to --

                                  SAWYER
                    Why don t you?

      And Shephard knows the answer instantly --

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Because I m weak.

      Shephard picks up the bottle now.  Pours two more.

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    You close with your father?

      WE RE CLOSE ON SAWYER as that question lands --

                                  SAWYER
                    He died when I was a kid.

      Shephard nods.  Then --





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST      "Outlaws"         (BLUE)         12/13/04        47.
      (CONT'D): (5)2626


                                  SHEPHARD
                    This  business  you ve got.
                          (beat)
                    Will it ease your suffering?

                                  SAWYER
                          (thinks about it)
                    Yeah.

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Then what are you doing here?

                                  SAWYER
                    It s not that simple.

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Sure it is.
                          (downs his shot; then)
                    Unless you want to end up like me.

      ON SAWYER, wheels turning.  What this stranger has just told 
      him begins to sink in.  AND MAKES SENSE.  His face hardens...

                                  SAWYER
                    What s your name, Doc?

                                  SHEPHARD
                      Christian.

      And Sawyer gets up, throws some BILLS on the bar.  Turns to 
      Shephard, puts his hand out --

                                  SAWYER
                    Thank you, Christian.

      And as Jack s father shakes Sawyer s hand --

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Good luck, Sawyer.


      THE CAR STOPS.  No headlights.  Windshield wipers SLAP  *
      against a POURING RAIN.  Sawyer looks out the watery glass   *
      at the SHRIMP TRUCK, the lone beacon of light against the  *
      dark night.*

      Sawyer SEES the distant figure of Duckett in the truck  *
      working.  Sawyer opens the glove box, pulls out the .357. *

      In QUICK CUTS he SLAMS the magazine in place, ready to go,  *
      and stuffs it into his jeans.*
