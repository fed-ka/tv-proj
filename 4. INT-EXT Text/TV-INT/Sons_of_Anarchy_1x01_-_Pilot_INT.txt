        JOHN TELLER, 25, tall, strong, long hair, climbs on a 
          HARLEY.  Strapped to the bike is a bedroll, backpack, 
        life stuff.  He gives an uncomfortable nod to the camera.  
        FIRES up the bike.  As he rides away we see the back of 
        his sleeveless leather jacket, BLUE letters on a WHITE 
          background -- upper rocker reads: SONS OF ANARCHY, lower 
        rocker reads: REDWOOD.  In the center, the logo:  
          ANARCHIST SKULL, with two M-16 CROSSBONES.  

        CLAY MORROW, 21, PINEY WINSTON, 32, six other BIKERS, 
        same hippy-vibe, same jacket, follow in line.  A few of 
        them, CLEARLY STONED.  The original nine.  They disappear 
        down the highway.  The history begins --



        John, 44, Gemma, 28, JACKSON, 9 and TOMMY, 5, open 
          presents around a tree.  Tommy looks pale, feeble.  John 
        helps him open a package.  Something about John seems 
          different -- older, wiser, gentler.  Jax plays with a 
        Star Wars Toy.  Hans Solo.

          Through the windshield of the cruiser we see a jack-
        knifed SEMI on the side of the road.  A long skid mark, 
        black and red, stretches across east and westbound lanes.  
        At the end of it, a mangled HARLEY.  An ambulance slowly 
        pulls away.  



        Jax Teller, 33.  On a Harley.  In formation behind him, 
        five other SAMCRO MEMBERS.  

        They pass a sun-beaten wooden road sign that reads: 
          WELCOME TO CHARMING.  OUR NAME SAYS IT ALL.

        The young buck leads his troops.  They disappear down the 
          highway.  The history continues --

                                                                      SMASH TO BLACK.




                                            2THE MOTORCYCLE CLUB
Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original (SAMCRO)

Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club was founded in 1968 by John Teller and 
Piney Winston.  Ex-Paratroopers who returned from Vietnam feeling 
displaced, unwanted and unappreciated.  Heroes who never got a parade.  
The original charter was simply called "Redwood", because they had no 
home.  Nine men, six of them vets, began their rebellious quest for 
freedom and individuality on the open roads of Northern Cali.

THE WORLD

Charming, California.  Rural, primarily middle-class.  Redwood 
country.  Big Lumber.  Oakland, San Jose fifty miles in either 
direction.  Most members live in a quaint, suburban area they call Sam 
Crow's Corner.  It s idyllic, incestuous and oddly Americana.  

THE COLORS

The uniform of Sam Crow.  A sleeveless leather or denim jacket.  On the 
back, BLUE letters on a WHITE background, the upper rocker reads: SONS 
OF ANARCHY, lower rocker reads: REDWOOD.  In the center, the logo:  An 
angry SKULL, with an anarchist s  A  in the middle of its forehead.  
Two M-16s as its CROSSBONES.  Next to the skull, a prominent MC.  Below 
Redwood, a blue patch that reads: ORIGINAL.  Other patches and pins of 
merit are proudly displayed.  Signifying their renegade status among 
motorcyclists.  Colors are only worn by club members, it's an outlaw's 
identity.  They are sacred.

THE MOTORCYCLES

Harleys.  Dynas and Road Kings.  No imports, choppers or softails.

THE CLUBHOUSE

Homebase for the Sons of Anarchy.  The doors are thick and heavy.  
Bulletproof.  The windows, tinted and barred.  SECURITY CAMERAS watch 
every entrance and exit.  It's half fortress, half adult arcade.  

In the main room, a long redwood CONFERENCE TABLE fills half the 
space.  Leather chairs all around; some labeled: PRESIDENT, VICE 
PRESIDENT, TREASURER, etc.  Against the wall, a fully-stocked BAR.  In 
clear view, a bank of SECURITY MONITORS.  

In the back room, a piano on a small STAGE.  To the left, a full 
KITCHEN, to the right, a one-room APARTMENT.  Upstairs, pool tables, 
pinball machines, X-box and a WEIGHT ROOM.  

On the walls, hundreds of PHOTOS of Sons of Anarchy members.  The 
history of the club.  We also see PAINTINGS and other gifts of ART, 
interpreting the Sons of Anarchy logo and colors.  

One wall is filled with MUGSHOTS of club members.  



                                            3And there are plaques with slogans everywhere: 

- YOU DON'T RIDE, YOU DON'T VOTE.
- NO JUNKIES ALLOWED.
- TREAT ME GOOD, I TREAT YOU BETTER.  TREAT ME BAD, I TREAT YOU WORSE.   
- DON'T LET YOUR OLD LADY FIND OUT ABOUT YOUR MAMA.
- A CHILD IS "BORN" INTO A FAMILY.  A MAN "EARNS" HIS.
- LIVE SONS OF ANARCHY, DIE SONS OF ANARCHY.

                                            TEASER

      SMASH UP ON:



    We see WENDY CASE, 33, SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT, pretty, sexy in 
      a fragile way.  She enters from the Living Room carrying a 
      SMALL PURSE.  She looks frazzled.  IGNORES the RINGING PHONE.

    She opens a KITCHEN DRAWER, searches for a spoon.  None.  She 
      moves to the sink.  Full of DIRTY DISHES.  Spoons are gnarly.  
    She has a thought.  Opens the FREEZER, a SPOON sticks out of 
      a quart of H agen-Dazs.  She yanks it out, licks it clean.  

    The CAMERA STAYS on the front of the Amana.  Covered with 
      PHOTOS.  Jax and Wendy.  Wendy with Sam Crow.  There s a  One 
    Day at a Time  sticker in the center of the life collage.  

    The CAMERA MOVES back toward Wendy, we see the kitchen is a 
      MESS.  Empty pizza boxes, half-filled glasses, clutter.  We 
      find Wendy at the STOVE.  She holds the SPOON over a low GAS 
      FLAME.  In it, CRYSTALLINE ROCKS melt in a splash of water.  
      With her other hand, she pulls a clean DISPOSABLE SYRINGE 
      from the small purse.  She DRAWS the cooked mixture into the 
      syringe and drops in a chair at the kitchen table.

    She anxiously searches her hand for a clean place to pop.  
      Then, she places the same hand on her belly.  Hesitates.  
      Before the remorse can well up, she JAMS the needle between 
    her middle and ring finger. 



      Jax, Clay and Bobby knock on a door with a MANAGER sign.  
      NEETA, black, 60 s, opens the door.  They enter --



      Clay and Bobby give her a hug and a kiss --

                                          CLAY
                      Hey, beautiful.

                      He was.  Haven t seen him in over a 
                      week.  His kid s been crying in there 
                      all morning.  I knock, no one answers.  

    She hands Clay a set of KEYS.  Clay notices the CEILING FAN --

                      How re the new ceiling fans working?

                      Almost too good.  I like to sleep in 
                      the buff.

    Jax cozies up behind her, playfully grabs her --

                                        JAX
                      Don t tease me, sister.  I m only

                      No doubt.

      They share a LAUGH as the Sons of Anarchy head out --



    Jax KNOCKS on Lowell s door.  No answer.  No noise.   Clay 
      uses the key to open it.  Jax and Bobby enter --



    An old couch.  DJ EQUIPMENT -- turntables, mixers, vinyl. 
      There s an amplifier in a THOUSAND PIECES on the floor.  

                                        JAX

                      Shit.  

      Bobby sticks his head into the kitchen, sees --



      Sitting under a filthy table, eating Sugar Smacks out of a 
      box, is a five-year-old BOY.  He s dirty, tired and scared.  

                                                                            (CONTINUED)

    Jax and Clay join Bobby, see the kid. 

                                          BOBBY
                      Hey, how you doing, pal?  Where s your

                      He named his kid Moby?  Should shoot 
                      him just for that.  Take him to Neeta.  

      Bobby picks up the kid, carries him into --



    The boy struggles and CRIES, clearly overtired and scared.  
    He kicks Bobby as he carries him out --

                                          BOBBY
                      Hey.  Don t be a dick, Moby.

                      I do what I --

      Suddenly, GUNSHOTS.  Bullets WHIZ by Sam Crow.  Bobby, Jax 
    and Clay hit the floor.  Pull 9MM s.  Bobby shields the kid.

                                          CLAY
                      Where?

                      Get the kid out.

      Bobby crawls out with the kid.  Jax and Clay move on the 
      floor toward the bathroom.  Jax dives behind the couch, Clay 
      behind a bookshelf.  Jax peeks into the bathroom, the door 
      opens, a .45 peeks out.  Two more SHOTS whiz by Jax s head.

                                        JAX
                      Shit.

      Clay now sees the shooter -- LOWELL, 20 s, white, skinny.  
    All he wears is a pair of dirty white briefs.

    Jax rushes him, grabs his gun hand and SMASHES it against the 
      wall.  .45 drops.  Clay levels Lowell with a right hook.  
      Lowell hits the floor, bleeding.  Starts CRYING.

      what s left of a MUNITIONS FACTORY.  Trammel moves some

    Jax steps through a crowded 8X10 storage unit.  Filled with 
    old baby furniture, boxes, typewriter, memory-charged junk.   
    Jax lights up when he sees a DAISY AIR RIFLE.  Turns boy.  
      Takes the rifle, sticks the end in the muddy gravel outside 
    the space and PUMPS the gun.  Takes aim and FIRES at some 
      BOXES.  Dirt and gravel fly.  Jax laughs.  

    As he makes his way to the baby stuff, he sees the box that 
    he hit with the mud bullet, it s a LARGE CARDBOARD BOX 
      sitting on top of a CHANGING TABLE.  It s labeled: JOHN MISC. 

    Jax opens the box.  Inside -- dirty BINDERS filled with 
      HARLEY REPAIR MANUALS, SPOOLS of SUPER 8 FILM, VHS TAPES and 
      PHOTOS: John in Vietnam, Gemma and John s wedding.  History.  
    As Jax digs through the contents, some of the HARLEY BINDERS 
      fall to the floor.  From inside of one of them, a thick 
      MANILA ENVELOPE slides out.  Labeled: ORIGINAL. 3/15/1991. 

    Jax picks it up.  Breaks the seal and slides out a 
      MANUSCRIPT.  Typewritten.  The title page reads: 

                          THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SAM CROW.  
                    HOW THE SONS OF ANARCHY LOST THEIR WAY.  
                                BY JOHN THOMAS TELLER.

    Jax turns the page, reads the DEDICATION.  He hears his 
      father s voice in his head --

                                          JOHN TELLER (V.O.)
                      For my sons.  Thomas, who is already 
                      at peace.  And Jackson, may he never 
                      know this life of chaos.

    Jax drops into a BABY ROCKING CHAIR, stares at the page.

      SMASH UP ON:



      Wendy is LYING IN A HEAP on the kitchen floor.  BLOOD pools 
      under her pelvis.  USED SYRINGE near her head.  Dead?

      Gemma, freaked out, takes out her cell, dials 911 --

      Half-Sack and a HANG-AROUND, 20 s enter.  Half-Sack carries a 
      large CARDBOARD BOX.  Bobby, at the piano, rehearsing, IN THE 
      GHETTO, sees the prospect --

                                          BOBBY

                      Alright, big man.

      Half-Sack looks around for a place to put the box.  Rests it 
    on the floor, next to the stairwell.  

                                          HANG-AROUND
                      Where d you get the name, Half-Sack?

      Proudly, without hesitation, Half-Sack drops his pants.  
      Facing away from us, all we see is his ass.  

                                          HALF-SACK
                      Had my left nut blown off by an aper

      Half-Sack and the Hang-Around exit without the box.  Hawk 
      hands Clay a Bud.  Dublin heads toward the back.



    We see Jax s colors draped over a chair.  This is where he s 
      been living.  The contents of his father s box is spilled 
      onto his bed.  We see PHOTOS of a twenty-one-year-old Jax 
      with a pretty YOUNG WOMAN.  She s on the back of his Harley.  

    Jax sits on the edge of his bed.  Reading the MANUSCRIPT.  A 
    few pages in.  Then, A KNOCK on the door startles him --

    Jax waits a moment.  Then exits --



    Jax walks away, then decides to LOCK the apartment door.  

    As he passes the wall of MUGSHOTS, he glances up at JOHN 
      TELLER S POLICE PHOTO.  His dad was a bad-ass looking dude.



      Jax, Clay, Bobby, Hawk, Dublin, around the table.  Clay takes 
    two cell phones from his pocket.  An iPHONE and a cheap 
      PREPAID.  Tosses both into a CIGAR BOX, passes it around.  
    All phones go in the box.  Dublin takes the box out back.

    Jax heads down the long hallway, needing an exit.  His face, 
      a mix of fear, rage, determination.  His family fades into 
    the background, as his HAND PUSHES OPEN the hospital door --

      A GLOVED-HAND PUSHES OPEN the door of a high-tech INCUBATION

      Size of a Nerf football.  Tubes, wires coming and going from 
      nearly every orifice.  As the hand attaches an IV, his tiny 
      pink face contorts, a mix of fear, rage, determination --



    Jax walks into the bar.  Bobby and Dublin trail behind.  
      Local joint.  Day drinkers and barflies.  

    In the back room, three large WHITE GUYS eat, drink, shoot 
      pool.  INK on their arms -- NORDS.  Offshoot of the Aryans.  

    Jax SPOTS the one he s looking for.  Grabs a CUE STICK from a 
      rack, and enters --



      Lining up a shot, one of the Nords, IZZY, 30 s, prison-buff.  
      Without saying a word Jax CRACKS Izzy across the bridge of 
    the nose with the thick end of the stick.  The stick SPLITS, 
    so does Izzy s nose.  Blood.  Izzy drops to his knees.

    Jax KICKS Izzy in the chest, knocks him flat on his back.  He 
      picks up the BROKEN CUE STICK, drives the SHARP SPLINTERED end 
      into Izzy s GROIN.  The man MOANS in agony.  Dublin and Bobby 
      wince, then smile.  Dublin advises his brother --

    Jax snaps out of his rage.  Nods.  Stares at the chaos he s 
      created.  Walks out.  

      Bobby and Dublin back out, guns drawn.  Bobby smiles --

                      Thank you, Piney.  Thanks, guys.

      Clay puts a supportive hand on his stepson s shoulder.  Then, 
    he SLAMS the gavel.

    The members stand, walk to the bar.  The doors open, Half-
      Sack and several HANG-AROUNDS enter.  Clay joins Bobby.  
      Bobby notices that he s MASSAGING his hands, concerned --

      Dublin picks up Half-Sack s CARDBOARD BOX.  Heavy.  Puts it

    The club REACTS in disgust.  Half-Sack sees it, realizes --

    Jax shuts the door.  Hangs for a minute.  Then he opens a

      prison-buff.  Ice teas and a cheese platter on the table.  

                                          DARBY
                      Good to see ya, Clay.

                      You know my guy, Whistler.

      Uneasy handshakes as Sam Crow sits.  Clay takes a WOODEN CASE 
    out of the paper bag, slides it over to Darby --

                      Little welcome home gift.  

      Darby opens the box.  A silver-plated COLT REVOLVER.

                                          DARBY
                      That s some pretty iron.  Thanks.

                      I know what it s like looking at that 
                      bean slot day after day.  Can t wait 
                      to get out, make up for lost time.

                                          DARBY
                      Got that right.

      Clay makes his point --

                      But sometimes, you rush into shit 
                      without thinking it through.

                          (beat, borderline smug)
                      How s the family doing?

    Jax LUNGES at Darby.  Whistler jumps up, INTERCEPTS Jax, Hawk 
      grabs Whistler SLAMS him against the back of the booth.  
      Before guns come out, Clay, pissed off, calls for order --

                                          CLAY
                      Everybody, contain your shit!  

      Nearby CUSTOMERS evacuate their table.  The Sons of Anarchy 
    and the Nords settle back into their seats.  Decompress. 

      Clay address the neighboring booth --

                                          CLAY
                      Sorry, folks.  Won t happen again. 

    The Customers nervously re-seat themselves.  Darby tries to 
    buy some good will  --

      Gemma waits with LUANN DELANEY, 43.  Sexy, well put-together.  
      Tara joins them.  Officious.  Gemma stands, anxious.

                      Abel s stomach surgery went well, but

      Tara moves down the hall.  Gemma walks the other way. 



    In a far corner of the garage, Jax, Clay, Opie, Dublin, Hawk

                      They also wouldn t take a chance 
                      housing the guns there.

                      Means they d store them somewhere 
                      else,  til the heat was off.

    Jax throws down a DOCUMENT, with a smile --

                                        JAX
                      Alvarez's other parcel, one closer to 
                      Oaktown -- commercial storage units.

    The men nod, satisfied.  They have a plan --



    Jax stands before a mirror.  He slides a KNIFE into a sheath, 
      a 9MM into a shoulder holster, a .22 BERETTA into an ankle 
      harness.  As he zips up a KEVLAR VEST, he glances down at his 
      father s MANUSCRIPT on the bed.  Conflicted.  After a long 
      moment, he pulls a denim jacket and his colors over the 
      kevlar.  Slips on gloves, grabs his helmet.  To work. 



    On a work bench in the open garage, Opie loads a large DUFFLE 
      with detonators, wire, firing caps and sticks of construction 
      grade TNT.  We see his Harley in the driveway.  

    He hears the door into the house OPEN and quickly zips up the 
      bag.  DONNA LERNER, 30, pretty, no ink, joins him --

                                          DONNA
                      What re you doing?

                      Nothing.



    We see Jax walking up the driveway.  

      Opie grabs the duffle.  As he walks out, Donna grabs the bag.  
      Feels the WEIGHT.  Opie rips it from her hand.

                                          DONNA
                      You promised me you were done with

                      It s got nothing to do with you.

      Donna s fear turns rageful --

                                          DONNA
                      I m the one who gets shit on if you 
                      get caught again.

                      That s not gonna happen.

                                          DONNA
                      You sat in a cell for five years while 
                      Clay and the others got rich.  They 
                      sold you out.  You know that.  You re 
                      just too weak to stand up to them!

      Opie SLAMS her up against the wall.  Donna SLAPS him.  They 
      hear CRYING.  Opie s girls, SASHA, 9 and ELLIE, 6, are in the 
      doorway.  Traumatized.  Balling.

                                          OPIE
                      Shit.

      Donna runs inside, grabs the kids.  SLAMS the door.  Opie 
      PUNCHES his fist through the drywall.  

      Opie turns sees Jax standing in the driveway.  Watching.  
      Opie decompresses.  Picks up the duffle.  Joins him --



      Bobby and Half-Sack enter a near-empty performance lounge.  
    On stage, an ASIAN ELVIS IMPERSONATOR finishes a sound check.  
      Bobby, agitated, approaches SIMON, 60 s, the manager.

                                          BOBBY
                      Simon, who the hell s that?

                                          SIMON
                      Jesus, Bobby, what re you doing here?

                                          BOBBY
                      I m booked, tonight and tomorrow.  
                      Five shows.

      Simon reaches behind the bar and grabs a booking JOURNAL.  

                                          SIMON
                      Oh, shit.  Got a new girl in booking.  
                      Bitch doubled up my Elvises.  Sorry.

                                          BOBBY
                      Goddamn it, Simon.  

      Asian Elvis walks toward them.  Catches the conversation.

                                          HALF-SACK
                      Tell Chun King to take a hike.

                                          SIMON
                      Got six busloads of Korean tourists 
                      coming in.  They love Asian Elvis.  
                      I ll get you next month, Bobby. 

      Asian Elvis walks past, gives Bobby a pat on the back --

                                          ASIAN ELVIS
                      Better luck next time, killer.

    Off Half-Sack, is this guy fucking kidding me --



      A team of NURSES prep Abel for surgery.  Hooked up to hoses 
    and wires, they wipe him down with antibacterials.  He s got 
      a row of sutures across his tiny belly.



      Asian Elvis sits in front of a vanity, applying his porkchop 
      sideburns.  A KNOCK.  He stays in character --

                                          ASIAN ELVIS
                      Who is it?

                                          VOICE (O.S.)
                      The Colonel.

      Elvis, curious, opens the door -- Half-Sack.  Before he can 
      ask, the prospect answers.  Brutal RIGHT CROSS.  Asian Elvis 
      goes down.  Half-Sack locks the door.  Elvis, sans sneer --

                                          ASIAN ELVIS
                      What d hell s the matter with you?

                                          HALF-SACK
                      I m all shook up. 

      Half-Sack BEATS the living Presley out of the Asian.



      Clay and Jax enter to find the others standing over FOUR 
      CRATES of Mexican RELIGIOUS CANDLES -- Bleeding Heart of 
      Jesus.  Under the top row of the ornate glass candles, are a 
      dozen brand new MP-5's.  Clay smiles --

                                          CLAY
                      Praise Jesus.  It s a miracle.  
                          (to Jax)
                      Wire it up.

      Dublin and Hawk carry out the crates.  Jax unzips the duffle.

    We see a TEAM of SURGEONS operating on Abel.  Tara and the 
      surgical nurses attend.  Abel s heart is the size of a golf 
      ball.  They desperately try to heal this tiny human.



      Clay pulls the door shut.  The men arm up.  To the others --

                                          CLAY
                      Wait here.

    Jax and Clay slip out a back door.



      Mid-surgery.  Abel CRASHES.  His heart seizes.  Flatlines. 
      Nurses rush over with pediatric DEFIBRILLATORS.  Place the 
      tiny paddles on his open heart.  ZAP.  Nothing.  ZAP again --



    Jax pushes the Mayan to his knees.  Raises his 9MM to the 
      man s head.  Terrified, the Latino looks Jax in the eyes --

                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                          MAYAN 2
                      Please.  

    Jax hesitates.  UNABLE to pull the trigger.  Suddenly, a SHOT 
      rings out, Jax catches a bullet in the BACK.  STARTLED, Jax 
      HOWLS, then rips TWO SHOTS at the source -- The Sentry, in a 
      back doorway.  The Sentry takes both bullets in the belly.  

    In an instant, Mayan 2 pulls a BLADE from his boot, LUNGES at 
      Jax s throat.  Before the blade cuts, a SHOT blows the back of 
      Mayan 2 s head off.  Clay in the big doorway.  Smoking gun.

    Jax is SPRAYED in blood.  Clay studies his stepson.  Jax 
      realizes that Clay saw his hesitation.  

    The Sentry, not yet dead, struggles as he crawls to his gun.  

                                          CLAY
                      Finish it.

    Jax raises his gun, points it at the back of The Sentry s 
      head.  Slowly squeezes the trigger.  Before he fires, The 
      Sentry collapses.  Dead.  Jax lowers his gun --

                                        JAX
                      It s finished.

      Father-son intensity is interrupted by the others rushing in -- 

                                          DUBLIN
                      Shit.  You okay?

    Jax nods as he adjusts his KEVLAR vest.  Clay barks to Hawk -- 

                                          CLAY
                      Check his phone.
                          (to the others)
                      Don t have time to blow it all up.  
                      Load the bodies into the truck.  

      Hawk looks for the phone, turns over The Sentry -- 

                                          HAWK
                      Shit.  Clay.  

      Hawk rips off the hoodie.  They see -- it s WHISTLER.

      Dublin runs to Denim Shirt Guy.  Rosco checks the others.

                      jerking off in Chino.  Gave up the 
                      white bread, started sharing tacos 
                      with some new brown buddies.  

    All the guys now gather around Jax and Clay.

                      There goes the neighborhood. 



    The surgeons finish sewing up Abel s chest.  He s alive.  The 
      monitors are stable.  Tara, doctors and nurses, relieved.



    The fire SPREADS.  The PICKUP is parked inside the unit.  
      Flames lick the sides of the truck.  In the bed, three DEAD 
      MAYANS, two dead NORDS.  

      Whistler, his pants down to his ankles, has a six-pack of TNT 
      STUFFED IN HIS ASS -- fuse side out.  



      Gemma is there with Luann, the Sons of Anarchy MC and their 
      respective MATES.  Big family.  Tara, surgical gear still on, 
      joins them.  Her update is cautiously optimistic -- 

                                          TARA
                      The surgeons repaired the damage to 
                      Abel s heart.  He s stable.  The next 
                      twenty-four hours are gonna be tough.  
                      If he gets through it, he s got a 
                      pretty good shot at being a kid.

      Sighs of relief.  Gemma fights to match Tara s caution --

      Tara realizing maybe Gemma has changed.  Smiles and nods.

      They see Asian Elvis, BEATEN and BRUISED, wardrobe in hand, 
      slip out a side exit.  Bobby burns a look at Half-Sack --



      Bobby SLAMS Half-Sack against a wall.  Prospect MOANS.

                      out, I could lose all my gigs out 
                      here.  You gonna pay my alimonies?  
                      Put my kids through school?

      Silence.  Then, Half-Sack, remorseful --

                                          HALF-SACK
                      Should I leave?  Am I out?

      Gemma enters.  Finds Wendy, open Bible on her chest, staring 
      into space.  Gemma takes note of the good book.

                                          GEMMA
                      Looks like the boy might actually see 
                      his first birthday.

                                          GEMMA
                      Yes, thank you, god.  
                          (beat)
                      Maybe we should say a little prayer.  

      Wendy s taken aback, but under the circumstances --



                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                      Okay.  That d be good.

      Gemma places her hand on the Bible.  Shuts her eyes.  Wendy 
      does the same --

                                          GEMMA
                      Dear god, thank you for saving this 
                      boy from his murderous junkie mom, who 
                      cared more about a forty dollar rush 
                      than she did her own flesh and blood --

                      Don t you dare --

      Gemma rips the Bible from her --

                                          GEMMA
                      Don t Idare?  You pathetic whore.

                      Guess the DA was impressed by your 
                      Bible studies.  Hear they re not gonna 
                      press charges.

                      Another round of rehab.  Let s just 
                      throw money at those 12-step freaks.

      Gemma crosses into the BATHROOM.  Her back to Wendy and the 
      camera, she fishes something from her bag as she continues --

                                          GEMMA
                      How long s it gonna last this time?  
                      Six months, three?  Couple weeks?

                                          WENDY
                      It ll be different now.  I have my 
                      baby to live for.

      Gemma checks herself in the mirror, joins Wendy, with Bible.

                                          GEMMA
                      That s where you re wrong.

      Gemma reaches out and GRABS Wendy by the throat.  Death grip --

                                          GEMMA
                      You have no baby.  You lost that 
                      privilege.  

                                          WENDY
                      You re... choking... me...

                                          GEMMA
                      You so much as cast a shadow on this 
                      kid.  Try to turn some legal screw and 
                      get custody, I will finish this job.

                      He will nevercall you Mommy.  

    She lets go of her throat.  Places the Bible on her chest.  

                                          GEMMA
                      I suggest you turn to Jesus.  

      Wendy recovers as Gemma exits. 

      Wendy sees that something is propped inside the Bible.  Opens 
    it to reveal a FULL SYRINGE tucked in the BOOK OF JOHN.  
      Wendy stares at it.  Begins to CRY.  Then WHIPS the Bible 
      across the room.  NOT the syringe.  



    Jax rushes into the PICU.  Tara greets him.  

                                        JAX
                      He s gonna be okay?

                                          TARA
                          (smiles)
                      It looks good.

    Jax EMBRACES Tara.  Starts out as emotional relief, turns 
      into something intimate.  Familiar.  Almost sensual.  They 
      hold the embrace for a long moment.  Tara breaks out of it --

                                          TARA
                      Abel s a fighter.
                          (re: his EYE CUT)
                      Like his dad.

                                        JAX
                      I m fine.  Where is he?

                                          TARA
                      Recovery Two.  End of the hall.

    She hands him some surgical scrubs --

                                          TARA
                      Put these on.

    Jax unzips his colors.  Tara sees the Mayan BLOOD splattered 
    all over his shirt.  They share an uncomfortable look.  

                                          TARA
                      Clean yourself up, Jax. 

    Jax weighs her meaning.  Takes the scrubs.  Tara walks away.



      David burns the midnight oil.  On his desk, crime scene 
      PHOTOS of Rodrigo and an EVIDENCE BAG.  

                                                                            (CONTINUED)

    In the bag, a REVOLVER and a MUDDY CELL PHONE.  David pulls 
    out the phone, scrolls CONTACTS.  One reads: SAM.  He dials.



      Clay walks past the Chapel on his way to the ICU.  His pocket 
      BUZZES.  Takes out his iPhone, no call.  Removes his PREPAID, 
      incoming call, the ID reads: ROD.  Thinks about answering.  
      Hits IGNORE.  



    The lounge is full of Asian TOURISTS.  Bobby on stage, black 
      velvet tuxedo, porkchop sideburns, thick Elvis.  It works.  
    The crowd APPLAUDS as he finishes a song.

                                          BOBBY
                      Thank you.  Thank you, very much.

                      You know, sometimes we re quick to

                      odd.  But the good book tells us, 
                      before you criticize a man, you should

      MUSIC MONTAGE



    Jax is SCRUBBING his hands.  Studies himself in the mirror.  
      Sees something unfamiliar.



      A FIRE rages.  The roof has been blown off.  See the CHARRED 
      BODIES of Mayans and Nords cooking in the back of the truck.  



      Opie reads to a sleepy Sasha.  Donna, in the doorway, gives 
    him a relieved smile.  His family fixed, for now. 



      Tara looks through the window at the NEWBORNS.  A longing.

      Lowell, dressed, cleaned up, rocks anxiously on the couch.  
    TV on, he just stares at his kid, sleeping at the other end. 



      Wendy s hand drops limp, the EMPTY syringe hits the floor.  
    Her monitor FLATLINES.  ALARMS signal.



      Bobby sings.  Audience captivated.  Half-Sack nurses a drink.



    We see the MANUSCRIPT and PHOTOS of Jax s father on his bed.  
      Ghost of John Teller.  Undeniable.



    Jax enters the post-surgical room.  Abel is inside the 
      INCUBATION UNIT, hooked up to monitors and tubes.  Jax is 
      awed by the sight of him.  Tiny, fragile.  He places his 
      gloved hand on the unit.  As close to a touch as possible.  

    For the first and last time, we see Jackson Teller shed 
      TEARS.  The emotionality catches him off-guard.  He checks 
      himself, containing the overwhelm, just as --

      A HAND caresses his shoulder.  Gemma, in sterile gear, behind 
    him --

                                          GEMMA
                      He s perfect.

      Jackson stares at his perfect child.  A son of anarchy.

    The camera SLOWLY PANS to reveal, through the WINDOW behind 
      them, Clay and Tara, watching three generations of Tellers.  
      Neither one knowing the path that the family will take.

      Above Tara s head, barely in frame, is a red EXIT SIGN.

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK.
