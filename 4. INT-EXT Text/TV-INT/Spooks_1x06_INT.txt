 
  HARRY walks past JED, carrying a briefcase and what 
  appears to be some heavily-camouflaged flowers. TESSA 
  watches-- 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Page me if I m needed. I ll be back in an 
                                        hour. 
 
  HARRY departs. A freshfaced ASIAN RECRUIT looks up at 
  JED-- 
 
                                        JED 
                          Harry s on the go again. 
 
  HARRY glances back. JED and the RECRUIT look elsewhere. 
 
 
  DANNY puffs cushions. ZOE watches him from behind the 
  kitchen bar, amused, yet tense. Both are casually 
  dressed. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                        Vino. 
 
  ZOE brings out two bottles of wine onto the counter. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                              Check. Mood music? 
 
  DANNY flicks a remote--the stereo clicks on. Quiet 
  groove. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                          Check. Welcoming smile? 
 
  ZOE smiles welcomingly. DANNY smiles back. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 2
 

                                        ZOE 
                                  What s that? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                (still smiling) 
                                      Welcoming. 
 
                                        ZOE 
            I think you ll find that s village idiot. Try 
                            again. Less deranged. 
                                (he tries again) 
                                      Better. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                (psyching himself) 
              Ellie s going to love us. Maisie s going to 
            love us. They re both going to be blown away 
            and I m going to be charming and urbane and 
            witty and she s going to realise what a great 
            guy Tom is and move right back in with him. 
 
                                        ZOE 
            We re not on a legend tonight, Danny. Relax. 
                              Just be yourself. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                    Why d you think I m so nervous? 
 
  A doorbell. DANNY looks to ZOE--ready? She nods, heaves a 
  large carton of chocolate milk onto the counter. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                      Do it. 
 
  DANNY opens the door on: TOM, ELLIE, MAISIE. Casual 
  dress. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                          Well this is a surprise. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  No it isn t. 
 
    Smiles--greetings. DANNY and ZOE are welcoming hosts. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                              Hi--Ellie? Maisie? 
                                  (deep breath) 
                                    I m Danny. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 3
 

                                        ZOE 
                                  And I m Zoe. 
                                        (beat) 
                                      Really. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                  I believe you. 
 
  A moment. Then: TOM laughs. MAISIE, sensing a joke she s 
  not privy to, laughs too-- ELLIE can t help smiling 
  either. 
 
  MAISIE s laugh resolves into a wheezing cough. ELLIE 
  picks her up, carries her in--ZOE looks over with 
  concern. 
 
                                  ELLIE (CONT'D) 
            It s the new flat, I m sure, she s never had 
                                  it before-- 
 
  Close in: on MAISIE--she s coughing with one eye on TOM. 
  ELLIE strokes her hair. She stops. Breathes in. 
  Instantly-- 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                                      Chocolate! 
 
  She jumps up to investigate. 
 
 
  DANNY, ZOE, TOM, ELLIE, MAISIE--enjoying a party. 
  Drinkies for the adults, milk for MAISIE (and DANNY). 
  Biscuits. 
 
                                        DANNY 
              So why d you have to move in to this new 
              place? I thought you had a flat above your 
                                    restaurant-- 
 
                                        ELLIE 
              My leasehold s a little tenuous--and the 
                        landlord s a b-a-s-t-a-r-d. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                                      Bastard! 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 4
 

                                        ELLIE 
                                      Maisie! 
 
                                        ZOE 
                    It s so nice to finally meet you. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                      You too. 
                                        (beat) 
                  You all work in the same department? 
 
    A question normally fielded and dissembled--but: 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        ..Yes. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                        ..Yep. 
 
  TOM gets up to go to the loo. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                    What s he like to work for then? 
 
                                        DANNY 
              Slavedriver. We call him Attila the Tom. And 
              he could do with changing his aftershave. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                        He doesn t wear aftershave. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      (to Zoe) 
                            Oh. Must be you mate. 
 
  ZOE hits him with a cushion. MAISIE giggles and ELLIE 
  smiles. She knows what s being done here and she 
  appreciates it. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                              (softly, to ELLIE) 
            I really don t envy you. Being an outsider to 
                              all this nonsense. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                              It s not nonsense. 
                                        (beat) 
              Being from your world, I d imagine... it 
              changes things. I m amazed you ever feel 
                                        safe.

  TOM s come back to hear this. 
 
 
  OPERATOR sits at his terminal, on headset. Sounds 
    efficient. 
 
                                      OPERATOR 
                                    Go ahead. 
 
                            WOMAN S VOICE (MADGE) 
                                      (nerves) 
            Hello, this is Jodie from the Hancock Guest 
            House in Ealing? I need an urgent credit card 
                      check on a Mr. Patrick McCann. 
 
                                      OPERATOR 
                                    One moment. 
 
  He types  McCANN PATRICK  into the computer. A beep. On 
  screen, a large icon saying:  ENCRYPTYING--RED . 
 
                                OPERATOR (CONT'D) 
                            Encrypting, red channel. 
 
  We hear Madge s front door buzzer going. 
 
                            WOMAN S VOICE (MADGE) 
                        It really is quite urgent. 
 
  An I.D. page appears instantly--with a picture 
    (surveillance shots, NOT mugshot). 
 
                                      OPERATOR 
                  McCann, Patrick. Section commander in 
              splinter Republican group, Active Service 
                Unit leader for many years, personally 
              responsible for the torture and murder of 
                over 20 RUC policemen and two Security 
              Service operatives in the late 70s. Why? 
 
 
  A woman in her 60s (MADGE) is staring at a video feed. 
 
                                        MADGE 
                      Um, he s ringing the doorbell. 
 
  The feed shows McCANN up close to the intercom lens.

  DANNY produces a big plastic cup full of ice-cream. 
  MAISIE grins. 
 
                                        DANNY 
              And seeing as we have a special guest... 
 
  Suddenly--a buzzing sound. TOM, ZOE, DANNY--all check. 
  DANNY has to put the cup down. MAISIE eyes it with 
  longing. 
 
  They ve all been paged. ELLIE sees TOM s face. He looks 
  at her pleadingly. Hers goes cold. ZOE and DANNY grab 
  their coats. There s no need to explain-- 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                        Are we going somewhere now? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                    You can stay here if you like-- 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                              We ll take it to go. 
 
  Hold on TOM. 
 
  CUT TO TITLES: 
 
 
  JED has re-cornered the RECRUIT. He has his back to the 
  pods. The RECRUIT sees HARRY, horrified. JED continues, 
  unaware. 
 
                                        JED 
            Latest intelligence suggests Harry s seeing 
              some leggy redhead in the MOD. Lower rank. 
                                  Lovely stuff. 
 
                                      RECRUIT 
                                      (scared) 
                                    Oh. Good. 
 
  As JED continues, HARRY is approaching the other side of 
  the transparent pods - and at speed. 
 
                                        JED 
              Flowers every time. There was one in the 
                office of the Paymaster General but her 
                security clearance failed. That was the                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 7
 

                                  rumour anyway. 
 
  The RECRUIT flinches-- looks up to see HARRY behind JED. 
  Her mouth opens. JED is blithely unaware. 
 
                                  JED (CONT'D) 
          He s married with a kid. But we all do stupid 
                      stuff in here. It s the strain. 
 
  JED realises something s wrong. He whirls round. HARRY s 
  there. A withering look from HARRY then he s gone. 
 
                                  JED (CONT'D) 
                              Oh Harry ... Shite. 
 
  HARRY strides across the Grid--zinging tension and bad 
  temper swirls around him. People on the grid are 
    frightened to look. 
 
  He walks straight past his office and over to a computer 
  where the OPERATOR still sits. TESSA is staring over his 
  shoulder. On the computer screen, the CCTV of the safe 
  house. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    You went over Tom s head on this? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                Tom wasn t here. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                Tom deals with McCann. You know that. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                            I had to act at once. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            You let a known terrorist into a safe house. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            Asabiyah, Harry. He said Asabiyah. This isn t 
                                  about Ireland. 
 
  They peer at the small screen. CCTV of the man in the 
  baseball cap (PATRICK) sitting at a table in the safe 
  house. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                          This is live, I take it? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 8
 

  OPERATOR nods. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            How the hell did he find out about the safe 
                                        house? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              (hissing at Tessa) 
                  Never underestimate Patrick McCann. 
 
  He points at PATRICK. TESSA recoils at his aggressive 
  tone. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
          The consequences of this could be horrendous. 
              Everything will have to be sterilized? How 
          many safe houses will need to be closed down? 
                      House keepers retired ...   
 
  HARRY has clearly been rattled by seeing McCANN-- 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT D) 
            This could shove the budget over the abyss.

                              He said Asabiyah. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  I presume you ve called the cavalry? 
 
                                        TESSA 
          Anti Terror Unit and Special Branch should be 
                            there in six minutes. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                      What are they getting, a tram? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                  Six minutes across London is fast. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      (scoffing) 
              He ll be gone before then. All we ll have 
                      left is the smell of sulphur. 
 
  A beat. HARRY looks at her. His eyes have a slight, 
  watery wandering about them. She thinks  Is he losing 
  it?  She presses a button. They look at the screen. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
                What s that? On the table? Next to the                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 9
 

                              ashtray? Close in. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                  (peering--shock) 
                                      Grenade. 
 
 
  Grenade sits in the middle of the table. Sparsely 
    furnished, very old fashioned. MADGE is very frightened. 
  A camera above. PATRICK looks up at it. 
 
                                        MADGE 
                        If you want a cup of tea... 
 
                                      PATRICK 
                                (Ignoring that.) 
            I want to exchange information and I want a 
                favour in return. I want a face to face 
            meeting with a high ranking officer who knows 
            enough about Asabiyah to know what I ve got 
                        isn t a bunch of paddywhack. 
 
                                        MADGE 
            If you want some special terms I ll have to 
                            talk to the landlord. 
 
                                      PATRICK 
            You will. And you can tell him I know what 
                Asabiyah s been planning from the Sudan. 
 
                                        MADGE 
                Whatever it is ... I don t know if he d 
                                  believe you ... 
 
                                      PATRICK 
                He d better. Cos what they re planning 
              affects him and his employer. In a very big 
                                        way. 
                  (holds up a SIM card to the camera) 
            This is a SIM card. Stick it in a cellphone. 
            There s one number in the address book. Call 
                that number between 11.51 and midnight 
                        tonight. Nine minutes only. 
 
                                        MADGE 
                You said you wanted a favour in return.

  HARRY and TESSA looking at the screen. 
 
                                        MADGE 
                    Do you... Want to say what it is?

                          Let me out of here. Now! 
 
  Beat. She leaves. PATRICK follows, taking his grenade.

  PATRICK leaves and is out of shot. 
 
 
  TOM, ZOE and DANNY walk towards HARRY and TESSA. 
 
                                        ZOE 
            For what it s worth I think they both had a 
                                    great time. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    Nice try. 
                          (to HARRY as they arrive) 
                                What s going on? 
 
  HARRY and TESSA, grim and serious, look at him. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  Four hours til we do or do not call. 
 
  We pan up and find the  Section 1  clock reading  8 p.m.  
 
 
  HARRY, TESSA, TOM, DANNY, ZOE. HARRY is already seated, 
  the others are settling. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            This is an info dangle from a highly suspect 
            source. Not all of you have been need to know 
                about Asabiyah. With good reason. Tom? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 11
 

                                        TOM 
            Asabiyah is an ultra-extremist cell, hiding 
              out in the Sudan, a fragment from the Al 
              Qaeda fallout. The group has been yellow 
            tagged. The tagging has been effective. MPs, 
            the Foreign Office, most of Downing Street 
            and the press do not know repeat do not know 
            of the group s existence. No knowledge, no 
              leaks. So far they have been impenetrable, 
            they work in couples, family groups. How do 
            you come between brothers who write nothing 
              down? A CIA proxy agent got near but was 
              blown. What was left of his genitals was 
              posted to the American Embassy in Paris. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                        (Low.) 
                                        Jesus. 
 
                                        TOM 
            But as far as we know, Asabiyah has shown no 
              interest in planning any action in the UK. 
                      Yet. Mostly Indonesia, India. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                All chip in. The clock is against us. 
 
                                        TESSA 
              I think this offer s real. McCann wants to 
                                        trade. 
 
  On the word  trade , a look of worry from ZOE. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                But trade what? 
 
                                        DANNY 
              Got to be big to do a walk-in like that. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                    Even with a grenade in your hand. 
 
                                        TESSA 
              If there is any danger at all of a major 
              terrorist attack on the UK we must act and 
                                      act now. 
 
                                        TOM 
          He knew he was risking his life walking in to 
              that safe house. That has to mean he s got                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 12
 

                                      something. 
 
                                        DANNY 
              And the fact that he knows Asabiyah even 
                                      exists. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              So, what do we do? 
 
                                        TOM 
          What he s asked us to do. We try to deal with 
                                        him. 
 
    A silence. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  Come on, come on, group dynamics ... 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                    (blurts out) 
                              It s too dangerous. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                    Oh is it. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                        Why? 
 
                                        ZOE 
          He s way ahead, calling the shots. We may not 
                            be able to catch up. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                          It s our job to catch up. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              I agree with Tessa. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            Well I agree with Zoe. 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                              So we do nothing? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            Oh, we do something. 
                                (leans forward) 
          We set up the meeting with McCann and we kill                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 13
 

                                        him. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                          This isn t Guatemala...! 
 
                                        DANNY 
              Actually the CIA didn t kill terrorists in 
            Guatemala. They turned them over to the local 
                          heavies to torture them. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Let me rephrase for faint hearts. We bring 
                about a curtailment to his continuing 
                          existence through a proxy. 
 
                                        TESSA 
              What are you suggesting? We give McCann to 
          the provisional IRA. You know what they do to 
                        people who split from them. 
 
                                        DANNY 
          Yeah -- so let his old comrades beat the shit 
                out of him and get the truth about this 
                    Asabiyah thing. We win two times. 
 
                                        TESSA 
              So we liaise with the Provos while they 
                              torture a suspect? 
 
                                        DANNY 
              We ve got a Belfast officer liaising with 
                                them right now. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                              This is grotesque! 
 
                                        ZOE 
            No, grotesque is taking McCann at his word. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                      Zoe you are out of your depth. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Harry, he asked for an officer who knows the 
            Asabiyah material. If it concerns them it s 
            going to be in the critical list. Whatever 
                                the hell it is. 
 
  HARRY marshalls himself back into professional mode-- 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 14
 

                                        HARRY 
              This is not the truth. This is only their 
            truth. We have no means of verifying anything 
                                    objectively. 
 
                                        TOM 
                    Precisely why I need to meet him. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                  No. Not you. 
 
                                        TOM 
                Yes me. I know enough about Asabiyah to 
              confirm his intentions. No-one else can. 
 
  HARRY considers. They wait, uneasy at his withdrawal. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              I want this to be a collective decision. 
            We ve got to be at one on this. I say we burn 
                                        him. 
 
                                        TESSA 
              McCann s an old dog, he ll not let you get 
                                  near him ... 
 
                                        HARRY 
                        I m an old dog too. Danny? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                    (A beat.) 
                Meet him, see what info he s offering. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Even if the dangle s contaminated? Tessa?

                Danny s right. We can t afford not to.

                              (a flicker at ZOE) 
            So be it. This is eyes alpha, need to know,

                  McCann, no deals. Nothing. Strictly 
                              information gathering. 
                                  (He stands.) 
              I just hope you all realise what kind of 
                    bastard we are dealing with here. 
 
  HARRY goes. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                (meaning HARRY) 
                        I think that s very clear. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      (softly) 
                                    Work to do. 
 
 
  Close on a clock reading: as the second hand nears 
  midnight. Pan down to a Technician, who is typing a 
  telephone number into a computer near to TOM. 
 
  On screen: the numbers appear, next to  RECORDING . 
 
  Everyone is trying not to look at the screen or the phone 
  as, meanwhile, DANNY and ZOE sit close. Sniping in 
  whispers. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                            Tessa gave you money. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                      I didn t know what it was for. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            It was to shut you up! What do you think it 
                                      was for? 
 
                                        ZOE 
            I still don t know, I can t get my head round 
            it. Maybe it s part of something bigger, an 
            op. A big op. Or a test, maybe she s testing 
                                        me. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                    It s-a-scam! 
                                (spelling it out) 
                A senior officer. Sitting in this room. 
            Running false agents and trousering the cash. 
                  You ve got to pass it through Harry. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 16
 

                                        ZOE 
                                  I know, I know. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                So do it. Now. 
 
  TOM picks up the phone. Listens. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                      I can t. I ve left it too long. 
 
  Everyone sees what TOM s doing. Everyone stops. He 
  listens quietly, puts the phone down. Walks over to DANNY 
  and ZOE -- 
 
                                        TOM 
            Meet is rural. Tomorrow afternoon. Isolated. 
              Complicated. No doubt muddy. Plenty of open 
                    ground so no ambushes, no backup. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                  We ll send a messenger. Wire them. 
 
                                        ZOE 
            You can be puppetmaster, hang back with the 
                cans on, listening. Prompt him when the 
                        subject moves to Asabiyah-- 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    (impossible) 
                First thing he ll do is look for wires. 
 
  ZOE sees TESSA is watching her. TOM to ZOE: 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
              Can you sort out the transport tomorrow? 
                          (she nods, leaves--beat) 
                      And Danny, I need your help. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                              I m here aren t I? 
 
                                        TOM 
            I need you at my place first thing tomorrow. 
                          Please. Personal favour. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                  First thing? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 17
 

                                        TOM 
                Pretty please. Massive personal favour. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                              Seeing as it s you. 
 
 
  ZOE and DANNY sit picking over the remnants of a pizza. 
  Both are numbed, pre-occupied,working hard. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                      How s your side of the country? 
 
                                        ZOE 
            I ve been in touch with every contact we ve 
          got -- no mention of Asabiyah coming anywhere 
              near us. Some to-ing and fro-ing through 
            Heathrow - security cameras got a few shots 
              of Asabiyah members passing through the 
              transit lounge - but that s all. Buying a 
                dutyfree Toblerone hardly breaches Anti-
                        Terror laws. Not yet anyway. 
 
  ZOE s eyes glisten. She s trying very very hard. 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT'D) 
            Not that my word s anything to go by. I mean 
                              who am I after all? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                        (soft) 
            You re a brilliant spook. A messy flat mate. 
                              And a good friend. 
 
                                        ZOE 
              I m a junior officer. Tessa s a decorated 
              general. If she can co-ordinate straw men 
              agents, she ll have no trouble manipulating 
            real ones. Who do you think they re going to 
                                      believe? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                  That s why you ve kept this quiet? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                    I m scared. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                You ve made me part of this. So am I.

  DANNY and TOM are fitting bars to every window. Another 
  team are working on the front door. It s all in a rush. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                How re we doing? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                      In a tic. She not happy then? 
 
                                        TOM 
                          I want them to feel safe. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            You think Patrick s going to come for you? 
 
                                        TOM 
                  Any of them can come for any of us. 
                Security s in the mind. You know that. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                    You want Fort Knox, you got it. 
 
                                        TOM 
                          How about the front door? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      (excited) 
            Ah. Well. Now. You see. Swipe card, state of 
          the art, will not find this in Banham anytime 
              soon. No key code, it s all in the strip. 
            We ll keep a spare set in the lockers in case 
            you lock yourself out. This is the business. 
              Universal swipe. Central locking, all doors 
              and windows. Security glass. Think BMW in 
                      Jo burg. Go outside for a sec. 
 
 
  ZOE sits at her desk, working. TESSA arrives. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                              Zoe. Are you happy? 
 
  She means: do we understand each other? Pointed stare. 
 
                                  TESSA (CONT'D) 
                  I was tough on you in the briefing. 
                                        (beat) 
                                I may be again.                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 19
 

                                        (beat) 
                  But you re a big girl, aren t you? 
 
  ZOE looks at her closely. TESSA leaves. ZOE frowns. 
 
 
  ELLIE attends to MAISIE who is coughing. Knock at the 
  door--ELLIE opens it to reveal TOM. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
              I didn t mean to let you in, you know. My 
                                  hand slipped. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    How is she? 
 
  MAISIE sees TOM and her coughing increases in volume. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 20
 

                                        ELLIE 
                            Doctor s this afternoon. 
 
  TOM removes a card from his wallet. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    Take this. 
 
  ELLIE looks at it. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                        It s my new front door key. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                        At the Hilton now are you? 
 
  She tries to hand it back--he s not taking it. 
 
                                        TOM 
              I know how you feel about living with me. 
            About being safe. And that s why I ve changed 
              things. Please. Come back. This is no place 
                                      for you. 
 
                            (MAISIE coughs on cue) 
                              Go and have a look. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                  How do I...? 
 
                                        TOM 
            Card s just the same as a key on the outside. 
                Shove it in the slot. Light goes green, 
            you re in. Coming out it s the same, but you 
                swipe. Like a credit card. Go and see. 
                                      Please. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                          I d rather you showed me. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      I will... 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                    (anticipating) 
                                        But-- 
 
                                        TOM 
            But... I have an important project on right 
                                        now.

                                        ELLIE 
                                    What is it? 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                        Are you going to do spying? 
 
  MAISIE smiles. TOM goes to kiss ELLIE--she can t help but 
  accept. MAISIE runs to TOM, gives him a hug. 
 
                                MAISIE (CONT'D) 
                                  Be careful! 
 
  TOM smiles at her, tweaks her nose. Leaves. MAISIE 
  regards her Mum--the empty space--and starts coughing 
  again... 
 
 
  Clock reads: 1220. DANNY arrives to find ZOE perusing a 
  map. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                    Where now? 
 
  ZOE clicks a button on her computer. DANNY picks up a 
  small headset and listens--it s playback. We hear 
  PATRICK s voice: 
 
                                  PATRICK S VOICE 
            Drive north on the A13 in a brand new white 
          Ford Mondeo until the mileage reads 68.50. Go 
          to the first bus stop you see on that side of 
            the road and catch the first blue bus that 
                                      arrives. 
 
 
  Team is in conference: HARRY, TESSA, DANNY and ZOE. A 
    speakerphone broadcasts TOM s voice. Clock reads 1300. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            And you believed him.

            We have no option. And there s no time. We 
          need a footprint on that anti-tank weapon. We 
                need to look at port movements. Try the 
                            milkroute through Libya. 
 
                                        DANNY 
              Spaniards had a wobble last month. Libyan 
            freighter and a trawler offloading in the Bay 
                                    of Biscay. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                One month ago? Could mean they re here 
                      already. Could mean it s real. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Of course they re here. And if the weapons 
                    are here that means they re here. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    Stop this-- 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                    (he can t) 
                                    But where? 
 
                                        TOM 
          We have no idea where they are -- but we know 
                              where they re going. 
 
                                        ZOE 
              They ll have safe houses. Friendly faces in 
                                the north west. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Stop it!! How many times do I have to tell 
          you. This is contaminated truth! It s a hook. 
            And if we turn a blind eye on the activities 
            of McCann s group for thirty hours, you know 
                          what we would be doing. 
 
  He looks round the table, catching everyone s eye.

                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
              We would be trading a certain attack by a 
              splinter republican cell for some fantasy 
            about Sefton B! How many of those do we get a 
                                        week?! 
 
 
  TOM is driving like crazy, on the cellphone. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      I disagree. 
 
  INTERCUT CONVERSATION: 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                        Why? 
 
                                        TOM 
            The stakes are too high. A known dissident 
            IRA commander. Coming on his own. To a safe 
            house. Following up with a meeting. Keeping 
          to his word about backup. Keeping to his word 
              about time and place. We all know what a 
            breach of the nuclear material would mean for 
                Ireland. Their government does for sure. 
            Their Prime Minister took out a full page ad 
            in The Times for god s sake. Patrick told me 
            that he d keep to his side of the agreement. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                Tom. We both know the word of the IRA - 
            whatever faction - is as permanent as a fart 
                            in a wind machine... 
 
                                        TESSA 
                              We have no choice. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Tessa is right. We have to deal. And we have 
                      just under two hours to agree. 
 
  HARRY waits. Then he is very definite. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              We have a potential moral horror here. I 
              don t like moral horrors. I prefer facts. 
              Danny, Zoe ... Sefton B. How vulnerable is 
            it? And what anti-tank weapon could Asabiyah 
                    have possibly got their hands on? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 29
 

                                        ZOE 
                                        Right. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                        Right. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Meanwhile we do have one... ace in the Hole. 
            I ... have been less than honest with you, 
          Tom. When you met McCann you did have backup. 
 
  TOM goes silent on the speaker. 
 
                                        TOM 
            You had baby-sitters follow me, without my 
                                      knowledge? 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Worked rather well. You behaved exactly like 
            a man without backup. They followed you... 
              and then followed him. All the way to his 
            hideaway. Tom, thanks to you, and, indeed, to 
          me, we are now in a position to launch a raid 
          and capture a major, dissident IRA commander. 
            He s over here on his evil business. He must 
            be stopped. And that s exactly what s going 
                                    to happen. 
 
  He stands and goes from the room quickly. TESSA, ZOE and 
  DANNY sit - in shock - avoiding eye contact. Tom s 
    speakerphone goes silent. Jed rushes in -- 
 
                                        JED 
                                    Zoe. Call. 
 
 
  ZOE on the phone. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  Where are you? 
 
                                        TOM 
            I m almost there. But cover for me for forty 
                                minutes alright? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        Why? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 30
 

                                        TOM 
                                      Thanks. 
 
  She hangs up. Harry walks past -- 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              When s Tom due back? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                            Not for an hour or so. 
 
 
  TOM is sitting on a dark wood and green leather bench. He 
  stands in irritation and looks at a door. A plaque upon 
  it reads  THE DIRECTOR GENERAL  
 
  TOM decides against knocking and sits down on the bench. 
 
    A REGISTRY QUEEN comes out of the DG s Office. A kindly 
  looking woman, fifty, pretending to much older than she 
  is. She speaks in a near whisper. 
 
                                  REGISTRY QUEEN 
          Mr. Quinn, the DG has asked me to say that it 
                        is best he doesn t see you. 
 
                                        TOM 
                    But it s a matter of national ... 
 
  A touch of steel from her. 
 
                                  REGISTRY QUEEN 
                Please let me finish. Best he doesn t 
            actually see you. However at the moment there 
                    is a window. Would you follow me? 
 
  Puzzled by this subtlety TOM follows her through the 
  door. 
 
 
  DANNY and ZOE work on piecing together the 
     believability  of the IRA s claims. Clock nudging 3.45pm 
  now. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            Mate, I ve been to Sefton B. That place is 
                well hard. Four working reactors, two 
            reprocessing plants, Britain's main plutonium 
                stockpile. They ve not just put a sign                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 31
 

              outside saying  Beware Of The Sheep , you 
                know, it s protected. Razor wire. Armed 
                        Guards. All kinds of stuff. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                      I know. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            I mean you could fire an ICBM at the Visitor 
                  Centre and you d hardly make a dent. 
 
                                        ZOE 
              It s not the main site I m worried about. 
                              (takes the printout) 
                Area D421. It houses about twenty tanks 
            holding liquid high-level radioactive waste. 
            A breach in one of those tanks would release 
              a cloud 45 times as deadly as Chernobyl. No 
                wonder the Irish have been up in arms. 
 
                                        DANNY 
              Yeah, I know where you re talking about. 
              They ve got concrete coming out of their 
                arse. Three metres thick. You can t do 
            anything except from the air and the RAF have 
                          that covered these days. 
 
                                        ZOE 
            Normally half of these tanks are empty. But 
              there s been a glut of increased capacity 
                this year and the standby tanks are now 
              almost all full. Two of the intermediate 
                level tanks have the thinnest concrete 
              containment of the lot, about a metre or so. 
                    So not surprisingly they re being 
                  refurbished--in particular, their ROOF. 
 
  DANNY is taking this in. Grabs some paper, a pencil. Does 
  a rough drawing of the following - 
 
                                        DANNY 
              To hit the roof you d need something that 
            could fly up and then strike straight down. 
          Most mobile anti-tank units fire direct, they 
                      don t have a top attack mode. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  Some do, then. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      (sweating)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 32
 

                    I ll get the MOD on the blower. 
 
  DANNY glances at the clock. Speed dials. 
 
 
  The Registry Queen ushers Tom into a room. Behind a green 
  medical screen the DG - unseen throughout - is having a 
  medical. The Registry Queen stands by the edge of the 
  screen on guard. The DG s voice - a light tenor with a 
  hard edge - is heard from the behind the screen. 
 
                                  DG (UNSEEN) 
                So you are here to complain about your 
                            superior in the service. 
 
                                        TOM 
            I never thought I d have to talk about Harry 
                                in this way -- 
 
                                  DG (UNSEEN) 
            Why not? If he s going doolally then needs 
                                      must -- 
 
                                        TOM 
              Please, sir, this is difficult for me -- 
 
                                  DG (UNSEEN) 
          Oh, please don t emote. You re here to gripe. 
                                      So spit. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  No! I m not -- 
 
                                  DG (UNSEEN) 
              It s never my policy to listen to gripes. 
            That s why this meeting is not taking place. 
                                      (Snappy.) 
                        Yes Doctor! Get on with it! 
 
  TOM momentarily speechless -- ! 
 
                                DOCTOR (UNSEEN) 
                              Open wide. Say Ah. 
 
                                  DG (UNSEEN) 
                      Ah. You believe the Irishman? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Yes. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 33
 

                                  DG (UNSEEN) 
                                        Why? 
 
                                        TOM 
            Three reasons. The personal risk he is taking 
          by even talking to us. The credibility of his 
            story. The seriousness of what is at stake. 
 
                                DOCTOR (UNSEEN) 
                                  Cough please. 
 
  The DG coughs. 
 
                                DOCTOR (CONT D) 
                                        Again. 
 
  The DG coughs. 
 
                                  DG (UNSEEN) 
                So we give them thirty hours clear of 
            surveillance. What do you think they will do 
                                during that time? 
 
                                        TOM 
            I think they are going to keep to their word. 
 
                                          DG 
            That is what you want to happen. But as the 
                old KGB used to say, hope for the best, 
            expect the worst. Hence I ask, what is your 
                        worst fear in this scenario? 
 
                                        TOM 
                They launch an attack on the mainland. 
 
                                  DG (UNSEEN) 
          In which case we prevent a greater outrage, a 
                  possibility, by allowing a lesser, a 
                                      certainty? 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Yes. 
 
                                          DG 
            A moral twister. A terrible thing to decide. 
                        Head or heart? Brain or gut?

                                        DOCTOR 
                          Touch your toes please. 
 
                                  DG (UNSEEN) 
                            (With a little grunt.) 
                      Do you enjoy such decisions? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        No. 
 
                                  DG (UNSEEN) 
                Wrong answer. If you don t, you have no 
                business in the service. I am going to 
            approve your plan. Go ahead. Ring Rosie when 
                              you ve made contact. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  Thank you sir. 
 
                                          DG 
            Now it s finger up my prostate time, so I d 
                    be grateful if you could leave. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Sir. 
 
  The REGISTRY QUEEN ushers TOM out. 
 
 
  TOM, DANNY and ZOE. DANNY hands TOM an MI5-issue mobile 
  phone. It s a blue-fascia d phone, different to Tom s 
  personal cell. 
 
                                        DANNY 
              Work phone. We ve put McCann s SIM card in 
                        here. All teed up for you. 
 
                                        TOM 
                            How long do we have? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                    Four minutes before the cutoff. 
 
  TOM looks across at Harry s office. HARRY can be seen 
  reading. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                OK. Stay close.

                He presses a tape recorder. He lifts a 
                                      telephone. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                          King of the wild frontier 
 
                                      PATRICK 
              Davy Crockett I presume. Cutting it fine 
                                    aren t you? 
 
                                        TOM 
            I m going to give you a mobile phone number. 
              This is my number. 07700 900 002. Confirm. 
 
                                      PATRICK 
                07700 900 002. No contact  til sunrise 
                                      Thursday. 
 
  Rings off. TOM is ashen. The three look at each other. 
 
                                        DANNY 
              When they will give us the information on 
                                      Sefton B. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                    They say. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        He says. And I believe him. 
 
  TOM has dialled another number. 
 
 
  CLOSE UP on REGISTRY QUEEN s face. 
 
                                  REGISTRY QUEEN 
                                        Yes? 
 
                                  TOM (ON PHONE) 
                                    It s done. 
 
                                  REGISTRY QUEEN 
                                    Thank you. 
 
  She is putting the telephone down. 
 
 
  TOM is putting the telephone down. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 36
 

                                        TOM 
                              Brace for impact. 
 
  TOM turns towards HARRY s office. 
 
  From TOM s POV, HARRY takes a call. HARRY stands. He 
  shouts into the telephone. He slams the phone down. He 
  strides to his office s door and yanks it open. He leans 
  out and shouts: 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    Tom Quinn! 
 
  Everyone on the Grid stops working and looks up. TOM goes 
  to HARRY s office in measured steps. 
 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    You went over my head to the DG? 
 
                                        TOM 
                              I took a decision. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                  The wrong one. 
 
  He is breathing heavily - the tension is telling on every 
  one. He leans on the desk, hands apart, bracing himself. 
 
                            HARRY (CONTD) (CONT'D) 
              GCHQ just picked up a Pay As You Go mobile 
              keyword. Irish splinter group plans to hit 
            Euston railway station tomorrow morning. Rush 
                                  hour. A bomb. 
 
  DANNY comes into the office without knocking. 
 
                                        DANNY 
          MOD flash. Five pounds of semtex gone walkies 
            from an arms shipment in Newcastle. The MO s 
            got Patrick McCann s group written all over 
                                        it. 
 
                                        HARRY 
          And this is the man in whom you have put your 
                                        trust. 
                                        (beat) 
              You went over my head. Now I m going over 
              yours. No more deals. We re going to stop                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 37
 

                                    that bomb. 
 
  TOM has no reply. A silence. HARRY is not moving. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT D) 
              Smooth bureaucracy away from now on. Total 
              communication. We group hug this one or we 
                                  all fall down. 
 
  TOM looks at his watch -- there s just enough time to... 
 
 
  TOM lifts the mobile and crouches down close to his desk. 
  ZOE and DANNY crouch near to listen. 
 
                              PATRICK (ON PHONE) 
                            I told you no contact. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              There hasn t been. 
 
                              PATRICK (ON PHONE) 
              So why d you put a tail on me? Took me a 
                        bloody hour to shake them. 
 
  Shock, then rage on TOM S face. He glances up at HARRY. 
 
                                        TOM 
            I didn t want it. Sadly my branch chief had 
                                  other ideas. 
 
                              PATRICK (ON PHONE) 
                            Problems upstairs, Davy? 
 
                                        TOM 
            You said no acts of terror. You re planning 
                                to hit Euston. 
 
  Silence. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
            Keep to the agreement. No acts of terror ... 
 
                              PATRICK (ON PHONE) 
                                      (Angrily.) 
            We re at war with Britain. There's no such 
            thing as terrorism in wartime. We re striking 
              back, Mr. Crockett. Right at your throat. 
              We ve had enough of words. We re back in                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 38
 

                            business in a big way. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  No warning? 
 
                                      PATRICK 
            The rules have changed Davy. The gloves are 
            off. Try and stop our operation, the deal is 
                                      dead - 
 
 
  The crew again: HARRY, TOM, TESSA, ZOE, DANNY. And they 
  are all the worse for wear. A recording of the call 
  between PATRICK and TOM is playing: very loud, filling 
  the room. 
 
                                  PATRICK S VOICE 
            - and damn the consequences for all of us. 
 
  A silence that s hard for all of them to bear. Then HARRY 
  is speaking, quietly. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              I understand you think your boss is a little 
          ... emotional over Irish matters. Well, I am. 
            For the good of this team I want to tell you 
                                        why. 
                      (long pause--gathers himself) 
            I was in Ireland in 1978. My best friend was 
            a man called Bill Crombie. One day we found 
              ourselves in a Rebel pub looking for an IRA 
            brigade commander. Terrible mistake. I left, 
            he stayed. Bravado. They shoved him in the 
            boot of a car. I could do nothing, no field 
            telephone, no weapon. They dumped his body, 
            two weeks later. Very hard... To identify a 
              body when most of it has been melted away 
                              with a blowtorch. 
                                (Steel returning) 
              The Brigade commander was Patrick McCann. 
 
  Over the following he walks to the door and opens it, for 
  JED and the NEW RECRUIT s benefit -- they ve been 
    eavesdropping. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT D) 
                                      (pointedly) 
              I sometimes go to his grave with flowers. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 39
 

    A silence. He shuts the door. JED red-faced outside. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
              This has ... informed my judgement in this 
                    matter. I hope you all understand. 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                Absolutely, Harry. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                        Yes. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                    Yes Harry. 
 
  TESSA holds back for a moment. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                        Yes. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    Thank you. 
                            (He takes a breath.) 
            Their side we know. They will blow up Euston. 
                              So, we stop them. 
 
                                        TOM 
                We can t. They haven t given us enough 
            details about the Sefton B attack. If we stop 
                      them, they withhold everything. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                First principles. If we do not stop the 
                        Euston bomb it will explode. 
 
  Silence. TOM has a pen in his hand. Although his face is 
  calm, he s fiddling with it awkwardly. Gripping tight. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                But, we ve been in situations like this 
              before. A valued source tips us off about a 
            bomb. Stopping that bomb would compromise the 
              source. Letting it explode could help stop 
            twenty others. It s a balance sheet of risk. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            Exactly, Zoe. It s all about the long game. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 40
 

  A look to ZOE. Chills down her spine. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                Don t try and turn this into a textbook 
                      discussion. This is not a drill. 
 
  Still TOM with that pen. Squeezing tighter... 
 
                                        TOM 
                Lesser evil stops a greater evil. Every 
                                  single time. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                You think this. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Yes. 
 
  SNAP! The pen breaks in half, cutting TOM s hand. Blood 
  and ink on the table. It s ignored by HARRY. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Even though the greater evil exists only for 
                              now as a fiction? 
 
                                        TOM 
                      It s a chance we have to take. 
 
  ZOE passes TOM a tissue. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Not on my watch, I m afraid. We move. This 
                            bomb does not go off. 
 
 
  DANNY, ZOE, TOM--hushed tones. Stress. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                              Maybe he s right. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                Or he s flipped. 
 
  TOM stops. He s angry. They all stop. 
 
                                        TOM 
            You don t talk about Harry Pearce like that. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                I m sorry but what he went through in                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 41
 

                Belfast, it could warp your judgement. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                Drop it Zoe ... 
 
                                        ZOE 
            But if we think Sefton B s going to happen 
              we ve got to stop it. Even if there s the 
                      remotest chance--we ve got to. 
 
  TOM looks at them - these are my loyal troops ... 
 
                                        TOM 
                              And we re going to. 
 
  Lowers his voice -- conspiracy: 
 
                                  TOM (CONT D) 
              Zoe. Every hour you are going to rewrite 
              Special Ops reports on how we re supposedly 
              stopping McCann and his bomb. For Harry s 
                                        eyes. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                              Fiction? For Harry? 
 
                                        TOM 
            Harry must think we are stopping the Euston 
              bomb for real. Look at old ops cables for 
                    strategy if you like. Just make it 
              watertight. Harry is not an easy man to lie 
                                        to. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        (gulp) 
                                  I can imagine. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Danny. The weapon Asabiyah are going to use 
            against Sefton B. We need to know what it is. 
                        Make, model, serial number. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            I ve been screaming at the MOD but you know 
              what snobby bastards they are over there. 
 
                                        TOM 
          Then scream louder, pull files on their wives 
                but get the info. We have to know what 
                      Asabiyah s weapon is, in detail. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 42
 

                                        ZOE 
            Tom are we running an MI5 inside MI5 here? 
 
  ZOE and DANNY are frightened. 
 
                                        TOM 
          Two projects in tandem. The real one. And the 
              decoy. Decoy goes to Harry, reality stays 
            here. This is the DG s mandate. We have his 
            blessing. No-one here likes this one bit, so 
            let s get it over with as quickly as we can 
            alright? Anything, anything at all, you ring 
            my mobile. Mention the word bureaucracy I ll 
              know Harry s in earshot. But keep the info 
                                      coming. 
 
  They look at him. 
 
                                        ZOE 
            But if we stop the blast McCann s going to 
                                    cut us off. 
 
                                        TOM 
              We re not going to stop the blast. We re 
                going to smother it. No overt action. 
              Accidentally on purpose, the thing hurts no-
            one. It can be done, we ve all seen it done, 
                    it s what we re going to do here. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                    McCann will never believe that . 
 
                                        TOM 
              I don t need him to believe it, I just need 
            enough doubt in the equation for a barefaced 
            denial. We re giving him the crater, not the 
                              corpses. Get busy. 
 
 
  TOM walks in, overtly chirpy. HARRY appears. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                      Where the hell have you been? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  Personal call. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                        News? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 43
 

                                        TOM 
                Special ops are in the loop. Branch are 
                searching known Republican houses. We re 
                          going as fast as we can. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    They will not, WILL NOT bomb us. 
 
  HARRY going - turns back. 
 
                                        TOM 
                      Zoe to brief you on the hour. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                        Zoe? 
 
                                        TOM 
                          Smoothing bureaucracy away. 
 
  HARRY s own words but he doesn t quite trust them. He 
  nods. TOM goes. Massages his injured hand. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                                  (To himself.) 
                                    Oh Christ. 
 
  HARRY is staring at TOM S back. JED approaches -- 
 
                                        JED 
                                  Ellie for you? 
 
  TOM flinches -- walks over to take the call. JED lingers. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Hi. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                    I m home. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  I can t talk. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                          I thought you d be pleased. 
 
                                        TOM 
            I m sorry, I am, God, I m more than pleased. 
              More than you know. Don t leave. I ll be 
                              there. I love you. 
 
                                        ELLIE                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 44
 

                              Tell me to my face. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      I promise. 
 
  She hangs up. TOM locates DANNY -- conspiracy sotto voce: 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
            Double up the watchers on Euston. Expect them 
          to use the access conduit under the platform, 
                like they talked about in  96. Soon as 
              they ve left the package, page me and I ll 
            give the go code. We re not trying to win an 
            Oscar, remember. Just enough to be plausible. 
                                (looks at watch) 
                              I ll need an hour. 
 
 
  DANNY and ZOE on the phone, quietly actioning several 
  strands of plan. We cut in and out of their exciting 
  hushed machinations -- 
 
                                        DANNY 
            We need a roof collapse at Euston -- think 
            Heathrow tunnels in  94, exactly -- there you 
                                        go. 
 
                                        ZOE 
            On our signal all incoming trains divert to 
              London Bridge or stop at Clapham. The roof 
            will have gone at Euston. Never you mind how 
                                      I know. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      (ratty) 
          It s sixties architecture. Course it s fallen 
            down. You know the drill. Tarpaulin on the 
            ceiling, a load of cladding on the concourse, 
                            electrics going fizz -- 
 
                                        ZOE 
            Tubes must stop. Customer action. It needs to 
                          look and sound perfect. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            This is a national security issue I m afraid 
          -- if you haven t signed the Official Secrets 
            Act, you re going to. In about five minutes. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 45
 

                                        ZOE 
                            (having said the same) 
          You have? Oh good. You re signing it again in 
                              about five minutes. 
 
  A Messenger approaches, hands her an envelope. 
 
                                      MESSENGER 
                      By courier from Special Ops. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                    Oh thanks. 
 
  The pressure shows on ZOE s face. She looks across at 
  TESSA and at HARRY s office. She opens the envelope. It s 
  marked  D.O., Increment -- EYES ONLY N/5 . 
 
 
  TOM walks into the living room. ELLIE is there. MAISIE is 
  asleep on the sofa, ELLIE is sitting in a chair, a 
  blanket around her. There are suitcases unpacked, plastic 
  bags. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  You re here. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                            Didn t you believe me? 
 
                                        TOM 
              I didn t want to believe it til I saw it. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                              You look terrible. 
 
                                        TOM 
                  That s because I m a terrible man. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                          No you re not. Not much. 
 
                                        TOM 
                          God I m glad to see you-- 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 46
 

  They fall into each other s arms -- MAISIE opens her 
  eyes. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                  I ll never let you go. Never. Do you 
                                  understand me? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                    I understand. 
 
  They kiss -- part. TOM grabs MAISIE, hugs her too. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                You got in okay? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                        The lock s a little weird. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Just make sure the card sticks in properly. 
 
  MAISIE overhearing this. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                                      Sticky. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Exactly. 
 
  TOM puts MAISIE down. She s grinning back. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                                  Supper time! 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      No time. 
 
  TOM looks at them. It is against all his training to say: 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                Don t go anywhere near Euston Station. 
 
  ELLIE is stony faced. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                        What? 
 
                                        TOM 
            Don t go out. For the next two days. Please. 
                            Keep away from there. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 47
 

                                        ELLIE 
            Anywhere else not safe in London, to take my 
                                      daughter? 
 
  TOM is very conscious of MAISIE S bright and interested 
  gaze. He walks quickly over to the bookshelf. Gets the 
  London A-Z 
 
                                        TOM 
                        Don t go anywhere in here. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                        This house is in that book! 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  Here is safe. 
                                    (holds her) 
                                  But only here. 
 
  TOM S mobile goes. ELLIE looks at him. He takes the call, 
  heading to the door. 
 
                                    DANNY V.O. 
              Package is in place. From the look of it, 
                              delivery is 7:30am. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  Soon as I can. 
 
  Another look at ELLIE -- torn. She goes to him, kisses 
  him. 
 
 
  TOM and ZOE are bent over a map of Euston Station. Coffee 
  cups, stress -- they ve been working through the night. 
 
                                        ZOE 
              Infrastructure s fine, pedestrian routes fine 
                          ... Euston Road s closed.

  HARRY is coming out of his office. ZOE catches sight of 
  HARRY in the reflection on a computer monitor. Super 
  casual -- 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT'D) 
                  Apart from bureaucratic wranglings. 
 
  TOM folds the map away fast. HARRY is passing. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    (well done) 
                                      Absolutely. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    Latest ops? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    Yes -- Zoe? 
 
  ZOE hands an envelope to HARRY, who sweeps past to his 
  office without looking at them. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT D) 
          For the record I hate this as much as you do. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                        That the real record is it? 
 
  TOM S haggard face. Phone rings. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Yes. 
                              (Puts phone down.) 
                                So far so good. 
 
 
  TOM looks at his watch. Glances at ZOE -- DANNY. It s 
  time. 
 
 
  ZOE is on the phone. TOM close. DANNY at another desk. 
 
                                        ZOE 
              Structural damage... No casualties. Jesus. 
                              We re in the clear. 
 
  No time for celebration -- just a moment of relief. ZOE 
  puts the phone down. A look from TOM to ZOE: thanks. He 
  smiles as DANNY approaches -- but the smile turns to a 
  frown. DANNY s face is not happy. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                That anti-tank weapon. It s a Scimitar 
            missile. A batch of six were stolen, back in 
                              the mid nineties. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                      Stolen? 
 
                                        DANNY 
            That s why they were so clammed up. So I had 
              to tell them. When I said the magic words 
                           Sefton B  bowels opened. 
 
                                        TOM 
              A Scimitar. I ve fired one of them, up in 
                Scotland. This is not good. We ve been 
            thinking lorries. This thing can be handled. 
                            Operated by two people.                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 50
 

 
  TESSA, sensing conspriacy, approaches. TOM s about to 
  fill her in when HARRY stands in the middle of the grid. 
    A smouldering presence. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            My hourly reports tell me the bomb has not 
                been placed. Yet Euston is in pieces. 
                                Somebody speaks. 
 
  Fear. TOM glances at TESSA. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT D) 
                                      Now!!!!! 
 
  HARRY walks off towards the meeting room. They look at 
  each other, then move to follow HARRY. 
 
 
          TOM, ZOE, DANNY, TESSA, HARRY. Silence. Then: 
 
                                        TOM 
                    My department faked a cover up. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                Your department. 
 
                                        TOM 
            You were fed false reports. And it s not in 
              pieces, part of it s faked, the rest was 
              their work. Only damaged one side of the 
                                      concourse. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            Who was aware of this? 
 
  No one will look HARRY in the eye. 
 
  HARRY speechless. TOM adopts a jaunty manner, to get it 
  all out. But it hurts, it hurts, it hurts... 
 
                                        TOM 
                                Harry, I m sorry. 
                                      (silence) 
                I saw a mushroom cloud over the bloody 
                                  country. I -- 
                                        (beat) 
            You always taught me. Keep personal issues 
                      away of judgement. You didn t. 
                                        (beat)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 51
 

            I m sorry. The attack on Sefton B is looking 
            real. We even know the weapon they re going 
                                      to use. 
 
  HARRY looking at nothing. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT D) 
                              Shall we brief you? 
 
  The longest silence in the series. HARRY dead still. No 
  one else dare move. He meets every single person in the 
  room eye to eye. And then... implodes to a whisper. And 
  relaxes-- 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            Ah well. Needs must. 
                                      (brightens) 
            Did a similar thing to the DG once myself. 
                              (viciously to Tom) 
                  No corpses? You were lucky.     
                              (abruptly to Danny) 
                                  What weapon? 
 
  Relief all round--and a stunned silence. This man is rock 
  hard to his core. DANNY finds the spot light on him. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                What? Oh, yeah. 
                              (Flips open a pad.) 
            The Scimitar was actually a prototype built 
                                    for the ... 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            (Interrupting, alarmed.) 
                            Did you say Scimitar? 
 
                                        DANNY 
          ... built for the LFATGWS program, a horrible

            Light Forces Anti-Tank Guided Weapons System. 
 
  A beat, DANNY waiting. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT D) 
                                    Well go on!

  DANNY slides a CD into the display screen -- we see slo-
  motion footage, close up, of a missile hitting a tank. 
 
                                        DANNY 
          It s a variation on the Milan or the Javelin, 
          with two parts, a Command Launch Unit and the 
            round itself. It s light enough to be carried 
              by two people ... Range is just under one 
              point nine kilometres. This was filmed in 
                                      Kosovo. 
 
                                        HARRY 
          Two warheads, correct? One to breach reactive 
              armour and a main warhead to pulverise the 
              base armour. In this case the concrete and 
                            the steel tank inside. 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
                      How did they know about D421? 
 
  TOM, weary - partly with relief that HARRY is back in 
  charge.

              There s an Irish government-funded website. 
                  They monitor building at the plant. 
                    Understandable. It s open source. 
 
                                        ZOE 
          Just so happens their independent analysis is 
              accurate. As is their timing. Thanks guys. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            Asabiyah might also have someone inside, we 
            can t be sure til we re-vet everyone in the 
                plant. And we re only half way through. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              That concrete is heavily reinforced. It s 
              designed to maintain integrity, even under 
                                      blast-- 
 
                                        DANNY 
              We can t be sure the reinforcement s not 
                corroded. They re by the sea after all. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  I feel sick.

            I seem to remember CND saying much the same 
            thing twenty years ago. Though I doubt even 
              they had considered this as a possibility. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            How do we think they re going to deliver the 
                                      ordnance? 
 
                                        TOM 
            Land, sea, air. We don t know. It could come 
                from anywhere. That s where Patrick s 
                          information will come in. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                If it comes in. 
                                        (beat) 
            Presumably even McCann wouldn t screw us on 
            the timing. Which means tomorrow sunrise the 
            clock starts ticking and only he knows when 
          the alarm s been set. In the meantime we need 
                a buffer zone. Two klicks should do it. 
            Cleanse the area. And buzz every sympathizer 
              on the critical list for a hundred miles. 
              They ll have to eat breakfast somewhere. 
                                  (to the room) 
              We ve touched up every agent in the North 
                                West I take it? 
                              (suddenly to Tessa) 
              You once mentioned a potential source in 
                                      Bradford. 
 
  ZOE s face falls as TESSA nods. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT D) 
                                      Muslim?

              Well placed but sympathies very unstable. 
                                      Borderline. 
 
  ZOE might vomit any moment. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Don t care. No doubt you know his buttons.                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 54
 

                                    Push them. 
 
  ZOE now can t keep her eyes off TESSA.

                                (beat--a thought) 
            Oh, and call the Anti-Terrorism Committee. 
              Ask them to put the PM on standby. You ll 
                    forgive me if I don t hug you all. 
 
  HARRY gets up and leaves. Everyone looks at TOM bar ZOE, 
  who looks at the floor, white-faced. DANNY catches her 
  eye. 
 
                                        TOM 
                            Get me the News Room. 
 
 
    A NEWSREADER is given an extra piece. 
 
                                      NEWSREADER 
          And we re just getting reports of an isolated 
            outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease to a farm 
            in Holywell, very close to the nuclear power 
            facility, Sefton B. If confirmed, this would 
                            be a shocking blow... 
 
 
  They are leaving the Meeting Room. TESSA is a safe 
  distance away. ZOE is behind HARRY. 
 
                                        ZOE 
            Harry I know this might not be a good time 
                                        but  
 
 
  ZOE and HARRY. HARRY repeats what she just told him -- 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 55
 

                                        HARRY 
              Tessa has been running agents that do not 
                                        exist? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        Yes. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                      How long have you known this? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                For ... For ... 
 
  HARRY stands and blocks the view. Beyond, TESSA is 
  watching the office from her station. 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT'D) 
                      I was too frightened to tell. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            But you are telling. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                      (Whisper.) 
              She gave me money. It s in a safe place. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                          I m sure it is. How much? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                          Ten thousand pounds.   
                              (on Harry s look) 
            It s just that in the current situation, if 
              she brings anything to the table from her 
              agents, we can t really know... If it s the 
                                        truth. 
 
  A beat. HARRY is considering what to say. He turns to 
  her: soft-voiced, reassuring. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              You re at the frontier of this job, Zoe. 
            There s THE old question: who will watch the 
              watchers? Well, because of what we are, we 
          have to watch each other, painful though that 
                can be. Now, you leave this office, go 
            straight over to Tessa and chat, all bright 
                                    and shiny. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 56
 

                                        ZOE 
                                Chat about what? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            Oh ... me losing it? 
                          (Smiles, then he s stern.) 
                You ve done very well. Now get yourself 
                                      together. 
 
 
  Clock on the wall reads: fifteen seconds to five. 
 
  Everyone is here. Dawn glow. TOM is staring at the mobile 
  phone on the desk. Watches are checked. 
 
                                      OPERATOR 
            Definitely sunrise. Five minutes ago. He said 
                    he d call at sunrise, didn t he? 
 
  HARRY walks slowly towards his office. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      (to Tom) 
                                  Foolish youth. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    He ll call. 
 
  The crowd has started dispersing--maybe HARRY s right. 
  The phone rings. TOM grabs it. Listens briefly. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                                  (into phone) 
                                    I understand. 
 
  HARRY eyes him from his office. Their eyes meet as TOM 
  finishes the call. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 57
 

                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
              He wants to deliver by hand. No backup. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      Naturally. 
 
 
  The door is closed. A bag is put over TOM s head. 
 
                                        TOM 
                          This is not what we ... 
 
                                      PATRICK 
                          Keep your mouth closed. 
 
  A heavy hits TOM in the stomach. He gasps and burbles 
  beneath the bag. He is bundled into the back of the car. 
 
 
  TESSA closes the door and turns to HARRY, about to speak 
  -- 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      I know. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                    Know what? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 58
 

  They look at each other. A silence. TESSA sits. HARRY is 
  moved to revulsion. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              You re a brilliant woman, if you wanted to 
                get into treachery why couldn t it be 
              something ideological, Something grand? But 
              inventing bogus agents and pocketing their 
                                      payoffs? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                        They were very good agents. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            I know, they always told me what I wanted to 
                                        hear. 
 
  TESSA, very calm. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                They could ... retire. Have unfortunate 
                                      deaths. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                I m sorry Tessa. I know the service s 
                traditional policy towards wrongdoers is 
            smother them with kindness. But compare your 
            petty activities with what Tom is facing at 
            this very moment. I m going to throw you to 
                                    the wolves. 
 
                                        TESSA 
              You mean you only forgive sins if they re 
                                        large? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      Perhaps. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                And that s how you forgave yourself for 
                              cowardice in Ireland? 
 
  Deep, deep cold and utter stillness. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                  (A whisper.) 
                        What are you talking about? 
 
  TESSA leans forward and whispers back. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 59
 

                                        TESSA 
              Bill Crombie in 1978. You saw him die. You 
          did nothing. Despite the pistol in your hand. 
                                  (HARRY is ice) 
            Not that you ever mention you had a gun, of 
            course. But it came out in the enquiry. Until 
                            you buried it. Deep. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      (Whisper.) 
                          Are you threatening me? 
 
                                        TESSA 
            You threatened me from way up there, on your 
                  moral high ground - you hypocritical 
                                      arsehole. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Sounds to me like you have an ejector seat. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            Let s just say -- I think it would be better 
                          for you if I stay here. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                  Fair enough. 
 
  She stands and leaves. HARRY alone. His face sags. But a 
  thought comes:  interesting.  And he smiles to himself. 
  He presses the intercom. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
                                      George. 
 
                                  VOICE ON PHONE 
                                  Yes Mr Pearce. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Miss Tessa Phillips is to be paged to go to 
                  reception. She is to be met there and 
                escorted from the building at once, then 
                driven to safe house no 7 to await ... 
                further instructions. She is not to be 
              allowed any contact with any other officer. 
                                Do it at once. 
 
                                  VOICE ON PHONE 
            Yes Sir. Are you sending her to Narnia sir? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                  (clever chap)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 60
 

                    She deserves it. Goodbye George. 
 
  HARRY leans back. He looks out of his window at TESSA s 
  section. He sees her lift a telephone, say a few words, 
  look a little puzzled then stand and go towards the pods. 
 
  HARRY slides TESSA s personnel file in front of him as he 
  watches her go: 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
                                  (To himself) 
                              A fight. Oh goody. 
 
 
  We see TESSA exit the Pod and walk to the security door -
  - from out of shot two large men in suits join her. 
    Babysitters? 
 
 
  TOM is brutally dragged across the stone floor, getting 
  kicked along the way. He screams. He is sat in a chair. 
 
  PATRICK McCANN points a pistol at TOM s face. The bag is 
  pulled off his head. He recoils at the sight of the 
  pistol. 
 
                                      PATRICK 
                      You messed up our operation. 
 
                                        TOM 
                I don t know what you re talking about. 
 
  He tries to stand. He s held down. He struggles so 
    vigorously that TOM, the chair and his assailants all 
  fall over into a swearing heap. And PATRICK is laughing. 
  He puts the pistol away. 
 
                                      PATRICK 
              You ve got balls, Davy Crockett. Stop this 
                            stupidity, get him up. 
 
  They sort themselves out. All are breathless. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 61
 

                                PATRICK (CONT D) 
            I m keeping our side of the bargain. Lucky 
            for you it s both our countries are at risk. 
                                Give it to him. 
 
  One of the men hands TOM a computer bag. 
 
                          PATRICK (CONTD) (CONT'D) 
                                Undo his hands. 
 
  They release his hands. TOM opens the bag, gingerly, and 
  takes out a laptop. 
 
                          PATRICK (CONTD) (CONT'D) 
            All the info you need about the attack is on 
                the hard drive. There s a hidden camera 
            record of a meeting we had with the bastards. 
            Scanned photos, headshots, travel documents. 
          The targeted area. The whole shebang. This is 
                          one patriot to another. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Right. 
 
                                      PATRICK 
                              Now we must move. 
 
  The bag is taken away, his hands are tied again, the hood 
  is going on ... 
 
 
  DANNY and ZOE on the phones--JED and NEW RECRUIT zooming 
  around with messages, photocopies, faxes. Tannoy blares 
  every so often with a  Flash  message. A controlled 
  tornado is whirling. ZOE moves to a computerised map of 
  the area surrounding Sefton B. 
 
  A clock reads:  08.30 . 
 
                                        DANNY 
            Tell the armed guards to stay at home. If we 
            flood the countryside with uniforms they ll 
                                panic and fire. 
 
                                        ZOE 
            Wait, wait, they ve screwed up--look--for a 
              direct hit they need to be within this 40 
            degree arc of the compound-- and there s no 
                      way they can get that close-- 
 
                                        DANNY 
              Over the top, remember. They just have to 
              crosshair the target once. They can scarper 
              and fire it from anywhere else in range. 
            Look, McCann s group found these recce shots. 
            Three different angles of Sefton B, all with 
                              D421 in clear shot. 
 
  Phone rings. ZOE answers without a sound. 
 
                                        ZOE

                                      them up. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            From the recce shots and the dead ground map 
            there s three possible locations for optimum 
              firing. We need three teams to watch for 
              movement. And move in quick when they find 
                                        it. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  (sotto voce) 
                They re there. They re actually there. 
 
  It suddenly hits them that this is the proverbial it. 
 
 
  ZOE puts the phone down. She s just heard the news. DANNY 
  rubs her arm. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            Look, erm, correct me if I m wrong, but -- 
            did we just stop half the country from being 
                                        nuked? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                        Remember not to tell anyone. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                Can I tell you? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  You just have. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                            Can I tell you again?

  They hug. Holding her -- 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT D) 
                              So what do we do? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                Drink, I think. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                That, for sure.

                                    What if-- 
 
  He means: what if we hadn t stopped them...

                                        ZOE 
                                        Don t. 
 
  HARRY strides through. DANNY and ZOE break -- 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT'D) 
                Special Forces have disincentivized the 
                                      target. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                             Disincentivized , Zoe? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                    It s over. 
 
                                        HARRY 
          You know, Tom made the mistake of saying that 
          at the end of his first probation. And I told 
            him what I ll tell you. It s never over. We 
              may dance with the devil, Zoe... But it s 
                              always to his tune. 
 
 
  TOM, exhausted, is heading home with the laptop. Gets a 
  call. 
 
                                        TOM 
                            What s the atmosphere? 
 
 
  DANNY looks over at HARRY, who is staring intently close 
  at the OPERATOR s monitor. On it, we can see TESSA, 
  playing patience with MADGE in the safe house. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      (quietly) 
                            What s she playing...? 
 
  Pull back to DANNY. He is talking quietly into the 
  handset, a little fixated on HARRY s moving lips. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                Weird... Harry s acting really strange. 
            Something s gone down with Tessa. We re all a 
          bit a scared to be honest. I d stay away from 
                here. Go home, lay low. We ll take the 
                fallout for you mate. You ve earnt it.

  TOM ends the call. Torn. Looks at the laptop. 
 
 
  TOM in small home office. There s a filing cabinet. He 
  opens it, places the laptop inside. Locks it with a small 
  key. He then puts that key in another box. Locks that box 
  with another red key. Puts THAT key on his large keyring. 
 
  We hear the front door opening... TOM descends -- 
 
    DOWNSTAIRS 
 
  MAISIE runs in--sees TOM--and hugs his leg. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                          We made Melting Moments! 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Delicious! 
 
  ELLIE stares at TOM--bewildered. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                                      Surprise? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                    Er... to tell you the truth, yes. 
 
  They kiss. 
 
 
  TOM walks downstairs, having showered and changed. MAISIE 
  appears from the kitchen with a melting moment and his 
  work phone -- it s ringing. Melting moments are small, 
  thin gooey cookies. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                                  It s for you! 
 
                                        TOM 
                            Where d you find that? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 69
 

                                        MAISIE 
                              Your coat pocket. 
 
  TOM sees what phone it is. ELLIE comes to the bottom of 
  the stairs -- sees it s the work phone -- a glare. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                        Tom... 
 
                                        TOM 
                            I ll take it outside. 
 
  TOM grabs the phone, heads to the door. 
 
  MAISIE runs ahead, taking the swipe card from a table. 
  Swipes him out. The door stays locked. She tries twice 
  more, then succeeds--it unlocks. 
 
  TOM opens the door. As he crosses the threshold-- 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                                  (into phone) 
                                        Yes? 
                                        (beat) 
                        I can t hear you, hang on-- 
 
 
  Phone rings once--ELLIE grabs it. Tears everywhere. 
  MAISIE is sitting on the sofa, watching. A little numb. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                            Is it my fault? Mummy? 
 
  ELLIE runs up the stairs towards TOM s office. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                            Red key... red key... 
 
  She picks up his jacket, grabs his keys. Hands shaking, 
  phone nestled on shoulder, she finds the red key. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 76
 

                                      TOM (D) 
                          ..in the bottom drawer. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                        What? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      ..drawer! 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                You re breaking up! I can t hear you! 
 
                                        TOM 
                  Bottom drawer. Back (distortion)-- 
 
  She runs to the front door and screams through the 
  letterbox-- 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                  I can t hear you! You re breaking up! 
 
  TOM jams his face to the letterbox. Shouts through it as 
  ELLIE descends again. 
 
                            TOM (OUTSIDE THE DOOR) 
              Three steps. Red key opens the box in the 
            bottom right hand corner of the bottom drawer 
                                  in my office. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                  Bottom drawer. 
 
                                        TOM 
              In that box is a small key. That opens my 
                                filing cabinet. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                Filing cabinet. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Bottom drawer of filing cabinet is a bag. In 
          the bag is a laptop computer. Bring it to the 
                                        door. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                    What then? 
 
                                        TOM 
                            I ll tell you--get it! 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 77
 

  We follow ELLIE back to TOM s office. 
 
 
  ELLIE is on her knees, opening the filing cabinet. She 
  sees the bag. Hauls it up--drops it on the floor. THUNK! 
  The phone rings, she picks it up -- 
 
                                    TOM S VOICE 
            Be careful with it, keep it flat, no sudden 
                                      movements. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                Now you tell me. 
 
  She picks it up gingerly and moves downstairs to the 
  LOUNGE where MAISIE is standing by the door talking to                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 78
 

  TOM. She peeks through at his mouth. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Maisie, I want you to do something for me. I 
                          want you to play a game. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                              Piggy in the Middle! 
 
                                        TOM 
            No, hide and seek, I want you to go upstairs 
            to the bathroom and get all the towels and 
              clothes you can and wrap them round you and 
              curl up in the bath like you re a little 
                                    vole. Okay? 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                                        Why? 
 
                                        TOM 
                        Because I m telling you to! 
 
                                        MAISIE 
          But if you tell me where to hide, then you ll 
                            know where I m hiding. 
 
                                        TOM 
                But Mummy s going to try and find you. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                                        Okay. 
 
  She runs off up the stairs. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Ellie? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                    I m here. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Danny s on the line. He s going to talk you 
                                through it okay? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                            Take the computer out. 
 
  ELLIE slowly removes the ThinkPad. It s on the ground. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                              Shall I turn it on?                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 79
 

 
                                        TOM 
                    Just do only what he tells you-- 
 
                                        DANNY 
          You should be able to just lift the keyboard-
                                          - 
 
  ELLIE tries... Hands trembling. Yes. Keyboard lifts. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT'D) 
            There should be insulation under there. Lift 
                                      it up. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                  There s a metal plate or something. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                          That s it. Lift that too. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                              I m lifting-- hey! 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        What? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                    What is it? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                There s no bomb. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      No bomb? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                There s--it s fine. 
 
                                        TOM 
                          Ellie, how do you know? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            Look, I know a little about computers. Maisie 
          took my last one apart, I remember. There s a 
          hard drive. Memory chips. Motherboard. Clock. 
              It s all there. No wires, Tom. No wires at 
              all--it s a little LCD clock. Tiny little 
                                        thing.

                                        TOM 
              Clock--there s no clock on a motherboard-- 
 
                                        DANNY 
                    There s no clock on a motherboard. 
 
                                        TOM 
                          Ellie, where s the clock? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                      Right beside the motherboard. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                  There is no clock on a motherboard! 
 
                                        TOM 
                          What does the clock say? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
              It s just a clock, with the time, it s one 
                                      fifteen. 
                                      (terror) 
                      Fourteen... thirteen... twelve... 
                  Tom it s going backwards. It s going 
                                      backwards! 
 
  Behind TOM, a van screeches up -- police battering ram 
  team run out. 
 
  Three things now happening at once: the team setting up, 
  TOM on the phone to DANNY, and TOM shouting instructions 
  to ELLIE through the letterbox. He wants to see her as 
  well as speak to her on the line. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Okay they re going to bust the door, step 
                                        back! 
 
                                        DANNY 
            Don t touch that clock yet! We re working on 
                                        it! 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                            Let me move it away-- 
 
                                        TOM 
                      Do not touch it! Stand back! 
 
  The police try to bust the door down. It busts them.

                        Christ, what s this made of? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    (remembering) 
                Reinforced Steel. Cutters, where s the 
                        cutters? Where s the torch? 
 
  More men arrive. Equipped with serious kit. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                          Do the window bars! Go! 
                (a thought--why didn t I think of this 
                                      earlier) 
                                  Next door--! 
                                        (off) 
            Get a team next door-- try going through the 
                                        wall-- 
                                  (into phone) 
                              Speak to me Danny. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
              It s on forty six Tom... five... four...

                                  Stop counting! 
 
                                      POLICEMAN 
                    We ve got to clear the area, sir. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        No!

                  Zoe s come through with something. 
 
  ZOE has grabbed the phone off DANNY. 
 
                                      POLICEMAN 
              If that s C4 we HAVE to clear the area. 
 
                                        ZOE 
            The clock might have a separate battery to 
                the computer. If that s true she could 
                                  disconnect it-- 
 
                                        TOM 
              Ellie--has the clock got a screw anywhere?

                    What screw? I can t see a screw? 
 
                                        ZOE 
            If it s a separate LCD it s got a cover and 
                          the cover s got a screw-- 
 
                                        TOM 
                    There s got to be a screw, Ellie--

                                We re clearing.

                            Look! A screw! Ellie! 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                          (caught in a panic loop) 
                    What screw? I can t see a screw? 
 
                                      POLICEMAN 
              Listen to me sir. This goes off with all 
            these men, that s twenty dead. Pulling back 
            it s two. We re pulling back. Lesser of two 
                                    evils sir! 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  I m staying.

                    Your choice sir, we have to move. 
                                (shouting--CLAXON) 
                  Pull back! Fifty metres! Everyone! 
 
                                        TOM 
              Ellie--I love you--listen to me. There s a 
                            screw. On the clock-- 
 
  His face is plastered, bleeding, jammed against the 
    letterbox. He can see her leg. It s trembling. 
 
  INSIDE -- SAME TIME 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                  What screw? I can t SEE ANY SCREW! 
 
  And then it gets worse. Because appearing at the end of 
  the hall, walking down the stairs -- MAISIE.

  Wrapped head to foot in towels, blankets, a woolly hat, 
  earmuffs. TOM can see her. ELLIE turns to see her. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                      Aren t you coming to find me?
