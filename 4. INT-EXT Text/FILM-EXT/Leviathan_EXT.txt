A CAPTAIN watches the flare fade through his binoculars and
speaks to someone O.S.
CAPTAIN
I thought you said you'd
combed this area?
He lowers his binoculars AS WE WIDEN TO REVEAL MARTIN
standing on the bridge.
He also lowers his binoculars and
smiles coolly as he lies.
MARTIN
We did....Many times.
CAPTAIN
(looks at Martin
then to a Lieutenant)
Initiate rescue.
We hold on Martin's face as from
THE FORE DECK OF THE SHIP
A rescue chopper with pontoons lifts off the deck and banks
off toward the fading flare.
OCEAN - SAME
Jones, Willie and Beck stay bunched close together.
Suddenly Willie feels another bump.
WILLIE
(panicky)
It hit me!
Where are they?!
BECK
I can't see them!
Suddenly he is bumped by a shark.
Willie sees one only two
feet away.
They are surrounded.
Suddenly Jones stare to
taunt the sharks aggressively.
JONES
All right!
I've had enough
of this shit!
You want meat,
motherfucker?
Come on, eat
me, sucker, try some dark meat!
He pushes away from the group despite Beck's attempt to stop
him.
JONES(cont'd)
(taunting sharks)
What's wrong you snout-nosed
bastards?
My meat too tough
for you?!
Amazingly the sharks begin to disappear.
Willie and Beck
watch stunned.
Even Jones is surprised.
JONES(cont'd)
(to Willie and Beck)
Whoa!
Did you see those fools
run?
They know whose boss.
He jabs his arm upward in triumph and for the first time WE
SEE a gash across his forearm.
UNDERWATER POV
As Jones crows triumphantly, WE SUDDENLY SEE HIS WET SUIT
RIPPING ALONG HIS THIGHS!
SURFACE/OCEAN
Jones is chortling, suddenly his smile vanishes, something
is happening...
WE hear the DRONE OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER...THUMP,
THUMP, THUMP...The blades of the helicopter sound out over
the waves.
It's lights are visible.
Willie and Beck wave
frantically as Jones drifts closer to them!
UNDERWATER
JONES' LEGS
His wet suit is now completely split open and
WE SEE THE BLACK SCALES SPREADING!
THE HELICOPTER
hovers over the group below and lands on the water.
Its
blades beat the surface into waves.
The WINCH OPERATOR
hurls out a rescue harness and Beck helps Willie into the
ring.
He CLICKS the fastener and suddenly they both lock
eyes.
Before Willie can say anything Beck falls back and
signals the Winch operator who begins hauling her to safety.
Immediately Beck locks back at Jones and extends his arm.
BECK
Jonesy...Give me your hand!
WILLIE reaches the helicopter and quickly climbs out of the
harness.
The Winch operator throws it back across the water
where
BECK grabs the harness.
BECK
C'mon, Jones!
Jones reaches out his hand.
He is almost there WHEN
SUDDENLY RISING OUT OF THE WATER BEHIND THEM IS THE
SIXPACK/BOWMAN CREATURE IN ALL ITS HIDEOUS GLORY!
HUGE AND
GRUESOME, ITS LONG TEETH GLIMMER IN THE LIGHT.
IT GOES FOR
BECK BUT JONES MOVES BETWEEN THEM.
BECK
Jonesy, No!
JONES
Get out of here, Becky!
The Creature grabs Jones and pulls him violently under.
Beck watches horrified as his friend disappears.
Numbed he
clips the rescue harness around him when suddenly, WE SEE a
boiling of water where Jones disappeared...bubbles
rising...and then Jones' bloody and tattered life vest bobs
to the surface several feet away from Beck.
Beck reaches out for it just as the Creature appears again!
It turns and focuses on Beck.
Beck keeps going for the life
vest as the Creature starts for him.
ON HELICOPTER
The Winch operator and Willie watch in horror as the
Creature bears down on Beck.
WINCH OPERATOR
Is he in the harness!
CLOSE ON JONES' TATTERED VEST
Beck reaches it.
His fingers
wrap around the bicycle pump-like, seismic tool in Jones'
vest pocket.
The Creature is right on top of him!
CHUNK, CHUNK, Beck cocks it like a pump shotgun as tentacles
rise wickedly out of the water and wrap around Beck's body
in a death grip.
It's horrible mouth starts to open.
BECK
C'mon, motherfucker open up!
The Creature's mouth widens and as it starts to strike Beck
thrusts the seismic tool into its gaping maw and is suddenly
pulled from behind--out of the creature's grasp!
The rescue
cable is taut!
The helicopter is taking off!
BECK'S POV/ RISING SHOT.
Beck rises suddenly out of the
water, the Creature growing instantly smaller below him
until BOOM! the Seismic device explodes in the
Sixpack/Bowman Creature, blowing it to bits across the ocean
surface!
The shock wave sends the helicopter banking off
toward the ship with Beck safely attached by cable below it.
The winch operator pulls him in.
Beck, dressed now in crisp white clothes, stands on deck of
the ship.
He glances occasionally at a door nearby marked
INFIRMARY, then looks up as the Captain approaches and
shakes his hand.
CAPTAIN
Mr. Beck, I understand
you passed your physical with
flying colors.
And Ms. Williams?
BECK
(worried)
I don't know yet, she's still
in there.
CAPTAIN
Well, you'll be glad to know
you have a friend onboard.
Beck looks up surprised as suddenly Martin joins them.
MARTIN
(excitedly)
Beck!
I told them you'd
make it.
No one back at
TransOcean believed me, but
I never gave up on you once.
(smiling)
So, how are you feeling?
Beck looks at Martin for an instant then hauls off and in
one incredibly smooth punch knocks Martin on his can across
the deck.
BECK
Better...A lot better.
Just then the door to the infirmary opens and Willie appears
with a new outfit on.
Smiles at Beck.
WILLIE
I'm fine!
Beck lets out a slight sigh of relief as a STEWARD
approaches with a tray of WHOLE COOKED FISH, HIDEOUS LOOKING
THINGS LIKE ANGLERS, LOBSTERS, CRABS...MINIATURE LEVIATHAN.
The sight is almost too intense for Beck and Willie.
The
Captain notices.
CAPTAIN
I thought we might have some
wonderful seafood.
But, if there's
something else you'd rather have...
Willie stares at the tray of seafood uneasily then looks at
the Captain and smiles.
WILLIE
How about a burger and fries?
She and Beck laugh as they sit at a finely set table on the
deck with the Captain.
AS WE PULL BACK the ship becomes smaller and smaller in the
distance and WE ARE AT THE
SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
riding the swells, rising and falling before slipping
beneath the waves and descending again into the cold
depths.
