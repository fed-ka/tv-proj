      ON GEORGE AND SUSAN

      at check out counter, with a not-so-holpful teenage 
      newcomer CLERK. George is holding what looks like an exotic 
      plant.

                                  GEORGE
                    Maybe we should get one more rone pad as 
                    long as I'm charging --                                  SUSAN
                    --Maybe we should see what all this is 
                    going to cost us first.

                                  CLERK
                            (re: sales slip)
                    Suppose you want this stuff delivered.

                                  GEORGE
                    That would be nice.

      Clerk, irritated, takes a form, and proceeds to fill it 
      out.

                                  SUSAN
                    How long for delivery?

                                  CLERK
                    How would I know. Call the number on the 
                    invoice.

                                  GEORGE
                    I didn't see it. Sorry.

                                  CLERK
                    Explorer Card or cash?

      George hands the clerk his credit card. As she run the card 
      over the scanner, Susan pulls George aside.

                                  SUSAN
                            (under her breath)
                    Don't apologize. She's being rude. If Emily 
                    ever acted like that --

                                  GEORGE
                    Susan, those are low paying jobs, you have 
                    to expect it.

                                  SUSAN
                    No we don't. We just spent a fortune in 
                    here.

      ON CLERK

      Reacting to something on the scanner. She picks up the 
      phone.      SUSAN AND GEORGE

                                  GEORGE
                    I wish you would relax Neemu. We need those 
                    lounge chairs. And they're the first ones 
                    we've seen with graphite philo-flanges.

                                  SUSAN
                    It's just that we're putting out so much 
                    money to install this U.V. room...

                                  GEORGE
                            (affectionate)
                    We've waited a long time to do this. And 
                    now that we are, I want us to have the 
                    best. We deserve it. It's time we diapered 
                    ourselves --

                                  SUSAN
                      --pampered, neemu.

                                  GEORGE
                    Yes, well, then you agree with me.

                                  SUSAN
                            (giving in)
                    If you want, we'll look around.

                                  GEORGE
                            (re: clerk)
                    But she's already totaled everything.

                                  CLERK
                            (suddenly friendly, helpful)
                    Oh no. Take your time. I'm in no hurry, 
                    after all you're the customer.

      George and-Susan exchange looks, reacting to her new 
      attitude

                                  CLERK
                    And don't forget to check out those blue 
                    ticket items. They're thirty percent off.

      George and Susan start off to look. They're browsing, when 
      suddenly interrupted by a store detective.                                  DETECTIVE
                    Hold it right there.

                                  GEORGE / SUSAN
                    Excuse me? What?

                                  DETECTIVE
                            (quietly, but firm)
                    You heard me. Now come with me. You're 
                    under arrest.

      Before George can protest, he escorts them away.


                                  GEORGE
                    It was obviously a computer error.

                                  SIKES
                    I'd sue their butts off.

                                  GEORGE
                    That's not necessary, Matthew. A simple 
                    call placed to the proper channels will 
                    have this all cleared up.

      George, though still reeling from the experience, is trying 
      to be positive. Sikes can't believe his naivete.

                      Congratulate me. Today wasn't all bad. I 
                    was just put on the OmniCom account. You

      EMILY ENTERS from front door. She reacts unhappily to the       noise coming from the back bathroom.

                    Oh no. Why're we putting the U.V. room down

                    I'm proud. But if you had your way, we'd be 
                    back on the ship, cramped into some tiny 
                    little cubicle.

                    Us, hello. There was a mixup at a store 
                    this morning. My card was confiscated and-- 
                    hello?

      Another recording. George hands check to Kyle, then is 
      suddenly alert, hearing more rings and a click.

                                  GEORGE
                    Finally! Yes. Hello, I'm George Francisco.
                            (beat )
                    Oh great.

      And yet another recording. George responds by pressing 
      several numbers on the phone.

                                  KYLE
                    Thanks Mr. Francisco. Meanwhile, you'll 
                    have to keep the water off, back there.

      He starts to leave. George calls out after him.

                                  GEORGE
                    Wait! What about that noise?

                                  KYLE
                    Should be done once he finishes knocking 
                    out that wall.

      He's OUT.

                                  GEORGE
                    Wall? What wall?
                            (into phone)
                    What? Wait no--!

                    I'm sorry, Matthew. Just chocked Rampart 
                    Division. Jefferson and Banks haven't been 
                    contacted either.

      Sikes angrily takes off his jacket while throwing some 
      files on the desk. Zepeda notices his frustration.

                    contact one of us.

                                  GEORGE
                    I think you presented yourself admirably as 
                    a buyer, Matthew.

                    That's alright. Whatdaya think the odds are 
                    on the schmuck who takes the next call... I

                    Nothing. Not a damn thing.

      He slams a drawer, inadvertently knocking over a dirty 
      coffee cup from the night before. George studies his 
      partner for a moment, while Sikes awkwardly dabbles at the 
      mess on his desk

                    Zepeda was here, too?

                                  ZEPEDA
                    Yeah, so?

                    Okay, Just tell me who else was listening.                                  ZEPEDA
                    Listening to what?

                                  SIKES
                    My conversation. My private conversation. 
                    You know... the one coming in loud and 
                    clear from "the Matthew Channel"...

                                  ZEPEDA
                    Hey, we have a life Sikes, we don't need to 
                    listen to yours.

                                    ROTHMAN
                    Besides, that would be unethical

                                  ZEPEDA
                    Not to mention, boring. We're police 
                    officers, not voyeurs.

                                    ROTHMAN
                    It hurts our feelings you even suggested 
                    it.

                    okay, maybe I uh, I over reacted, I'm 
                    sorry. Sorry guys.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    You should be.

      Sikes walks off. Zepeda and Rothman wait a moment, then 
      suppressed smirks.

      ON SIKES at his phone, dialing. (In B.G. George is still on 
      the phone holding).

                    Cathy, it's Matt... how about trying dinner 
                    again tonight, my place... You know, maybe 
                    take up where we left off... ?

                                  GRAZER
                    Sikes!

      ON GRAZER approaching, motioning him to follow him.                                  GRAZER
                    Your line.

      George and Sikes both hang up. Sikes, George and Grazer 
      walk over to the phone booth, where the green light is 
      blinking.

                                  GRAZER
                    Okay, this is it. Zepeda, alert Yates to 
                    secure the surveillance truck and stand by. 
                      Francisco, you and Rothman are riding in 
                    the van.

      The room quiets, Sikes goes in.

      ZEPEDA AND GEORGE watch from outside the glass booth.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    You want backup?

                                  GEORGE
                    That won't be necessary, but thank you.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    C'mon, you need backup. I mean, none of us 
                    know this thing's gonna, work... The 
                      department's using Sikes like a lab rat.

                                  GEORGE
                    Yes. Well. We just have to have faith in 
                    the system then, don't we.

      Sikes motions a thumbs up to George while he continues 
      talking on the phone. George is not so sure of his own 
      words, however.


      The place is still a mess. George and Susan are sitting at 
      the dinner table eating Tenctonese take out. Susan is 
      sorting and reading their mail.

                                  GEORGE
                            (looking around)
                    I can't keep living like this.

                                  SUSAN
                            (re: note in hand)
                    Cheer up, according to this, you're not.

      Hands him the card.

                                  GEORGE
                            (reading it)
                    "With deepest sympathy... for your dearly 
                    departed husband"-
                          (to Susan)
                    Do we know a "William Sonoma"

                                  SUSAN
                    It's a store. And I got another one 
                    yesterday from the Sharper Image. Along 
                    with their catalogue.

                                  GEORGE
                    It's nice to know I'll be missed.

                                  SUSAN
                    I still don't understand why the bank 
                    couldn't correct the problem.

                                  GEORGE
                            (weary, frustrated)
                    They say they can't. The bank and Explorer 
                    card are subsidiaries of a company called 
                    Techmar. Then I learned THEY are managed by 
                      a conglomerate called Ryo-Tec Industries, 
                    so now I-                                  SUSAN
                    Ryo-Toc? That's owned by OmniCom.

      Off George's look-

                                  SUSAN
                    OmniCom George, the account I'm working on. 
                    You know, we're shooting one of their 
                      commercials tomorrow. Someone from the 
                    company might be there. I'll find out who 
                    we can talk to.

                                  GEORGE
                    Susan, I appreciate your trying to tug 
                    ropes on my behalf, but I am responsible 
                    for this predicament
                            (beat)
                      ...somehow. And I intend to resolve it in 
                    my own way.

                                  SUSAN
                    Your way doesn't seem to be working, Neemu.

                                  GEORGE
                            (the martyr)
                    I know, and I don't understand why? I've 
                    tried to assimilate into this culture. I've 
                    done everything they've told us to do. They 
                    told us to establish good credit, to carry 
                    their credit cards. I did all of that. I 
                    don't understand what it is that I have 
                    done wrong...

                                  SUSAN
                    George you're taking this much too 
                      personally.

                                  GEORGE
                    Losing one's buying power has a very 
                    profound effect on one's worth in this 
                    society, Susan.

                                  SUSAN
                    Then we'll open a new bank account in my 
                    name.                                  GEORGE
                    That won't be necessary.

                                  SUSAN
                              (analytical)
                    George, I believe I detect a human trait of 
                    male ego.

                                  GEORGE
                            (surprised)
                    You really think so?
                            (more thought)
                    Come to think of it, my droonal nodes are 
                    flagging. And the base of it does seem to 
                    stem from feelings of inadequacy to you. 
                    Hmm. Interesting. An interesting 
                      observation of human behavior...


      And another observation of human behavior. The candles and 
      light from the television are the only light source in the 
      room. Synthesized percussion and MOANS are HEARD coming

                    That? Well... it can arouse some people.

                    Yeah but, see that takes all the excitement 
                    out of it. It's like putting sex under a 
                      microscope or something.

                                  CATHY
                    I'm sorry, Matt. I had no idea your human 
                    sexuality was so fragile.
                            (looks to screen, loud

                    It doesn't look fragile.

                                  SIKES
                    Well, there's various ways of expressing 
                    physical arousal. Some are extraverted, 
                    like that ... others are simpler, softer...

                                  CATHY
                    In what way?

                                  SIKES
                    Well... more sensual. Maybe a touch, or-

                                  CATHY
                    What kind of touch? In the book it's not 
                    specific. In fact there's very few areas 
                    that are listed. And they're mostly for 
                    women. Not much for men.

      Matt is uncomfortable with this, but proceeds.                                  SIKES
                    Sure there is.

                    Your paycheck?

      REVEAL GEORGE opposite his desk, as Grazer dials the phone.                                  GRAZER
                    Should've said something sooner, 
                      Francisco. ...

                                  GEORGE
                    Yes. Well. I thought I could rectify the 
                    problem myself.

                    Grazer here. Run a check on Francisco, 
                    George. Says he never received his

                    Probably just a little computer glitch

                    Weird huh? That usually only happens when 
                    someone dies.

                                  GEORGE
                    Just tell me how I get my check.

                                  GRAZER
                    Well, they'll have to issue a now one, but 
                    they can't do that until you're programmed 
                    back onto the system. Means forms, 
                      department signatures, verifications...

      George is fuming.                                  GRAZER
                    Listen, if you need a small loan, I'd be 
                    happy to --

                    No. I'll take care of this myself.

      The last straw. He's finally had it. George walks out, 
      angry but determined.

                    Computer hacking. I see. How... how exactly

      Sikes enters the station from the other direction. He can't 
      help notice that everyone he passes turns their head and 
      tries to stifle jiggles. Grazer approaches him.

                    Yeah.

      Grazer starts off, then turns back.

                    Oh... there won't be any "hand shaking" 
                    going on in this deal, will there?

      Grazer Miles and walks of off. Sikes doesn't get it. He 
      walks over to his desk Prominently placed on top - a bottle 
      of hand lotion. He picks it up.

                    Now, lot's say that person wanted to change 
                    things to restore the account to it's 
                    original status. How much would you think a

                    Really?

      Sikes approaches, interrupting them.

                    I'll get Rothman and Studevant on backup 
                    and...

      George is drawn back to the Hacker, transfixed.

                                  SIKES
                    George?

                    Three or four hours, that person's credit 
                    problems would be history.

      George weighs it. He looks at the hacker, then at Sikes, 
      then the busy men around him. After a long pause, he calls 
      out to a nearby detective.

                                  GEORGE
                    Book him.

      As the two rush out, George notices Sikes seems very 
      uneasy.                                  GEORGE
                    You're nervous, Matt.

                    Why should I be nervous. Even if I got 
                    blown away, it's beats staying here.

      George is confused, but follows Sikes out of the station.

      SLAGTOWN STREET CORNER - DAY

      Sikes carrying a briefcase, keeps pace with the other 
      pedestrians as he walks along the busy sidewalk. He comes 
      to a trash bin and purposely crumbles a paper and drops it 
      in.


      George, Rothman and Studevant are in van. The tape is 
      going. We can HEAR Site's voice coming from the monitor, 
      but it's muffled. Studevant is fiddling with the levers.

      George is looking over the driver's (Studevant) shoulder, 
      trying to spot the limo.

                                  GEORGE

                    What happened? Where'd they go?

      ROTHMAN begins hitting the machine.

                      Reception's cutting out. We're losing him.

      George hurries over, grabs earphones from Rothman, starts 
      fiddling with nobs...

                                  GEORGE
                    We can't. It's all we've got now. We've 
                    lost visual. Come in Matthew... talk.

      inside car, as it slowly pulls into the warehouse. Car 
      stops. Driver stays by the car as Sikes and Rider get out. 
      Rider escorts him past a truck that's being unloaded with 
      crates. Sikes looks around, any moment expecting his people 
      to rush in. For their benefit, he chooses words carefully.

      She gets in limo and it pulls out, followed quickly by the 
      truck.

      ON SIKES, now alone with crates. He sits on them, takes out 
      a pack of antacids, pops a couple in his mouth, and waits.

                    Y'know Sikes, I don't remember your being 
                    such a cry baby-

      Sikes starts to go for Fuller, George holds him back, 
      looking Fuller firmly in the eyes.

                                  GEORGE
                    We trusted your product. It malfunctioned. 
                    It put a man's life in jeopardy. So you'll 
                      understand if we don't appreciate your 
                    cavalier attitude.

                                  GRAZER
                      Francisco's right. The department put its 
                    faith in you.

      Fuller thinks a moment, then,

                                  FULLER
                    I'm not going to sell 'em anymore.

      Sikes slam door on Fuller. The three exchange looks.       There's nothing left to say. Grazer's beaten. He dreads 
      tomorrow.

                                  GRAZER
                    How am I going to explain this to Internal

                    Well, we do have twenty crates of MPK's.


      determined, papers under his arm, steps off elevator and 
      walks over to the reception area. As George approaches, he 
      passes an electric eye, which activates a soothing 
      recording.

                                  RECORDING
                    Welcome to OmniCom Corporate offices.

      A machine resembling a ready teller, spits out a narrow

      George automatically takes it, begins to walk back toward 
      seating area then suddenly stops.

                                  GEORGE
                    No. No more.

      Others waiting, watch as Goorge turns around, and marches 
      past a sign saying "NO ADMITTANCE". He passes the 
      electronic eye setting off the recordinq again.

                                  RECORDING

      As George walks through, knocking on office doors as he 
      walks. No response. TRUCK WITH George down corridor.

                    This is absurd.

      Hs finally stops at am ornate mahogany door with a brass 
      plate READING "Executive Offices - Private"

                                  GEORGE
                    Finally.


      as he bursts, in, not looking up.

                                  GEORGE
                    I am not a man given to emotional 
                      outbursts... but what you've put me through 
                    -

      George suddenly realizes there's no one in the room, and 
      he's talking to a large computer. George stands there, 
      stunned.

                                  VOICE
                    Sir, you're not suppose to be back here.

                                  GEORGE
                    Well then where is everyone? The chairman 
                    of the board, the president...

                    I've filled out forms, I've written 
                    letters, I've been an hold, and I'm getting 
                    nowhere.
                          (at computer)
                    My life is falling apart all because of 
                    this. Now there is a computer error in 
                    there and no one seems to have the 
                    authority to fix it!

                                  YOUNG MAN
                            (backing away from George)
                    No one's suppose to tamper with this 
                    machine. It's tied into a international 
                    system.

                                  GEORGE
                    You're saying this can't be fixed? I'm 
                    dead, and nothing can be done about it?

      George, totally bewilderd what to do next; just stands 
      there.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                            (taking his papers)
                    Lemme see, those.
                            (reads)
                    Says you're dead alright.

      Young man goes over to the computer and types in some 
        information. As he types:

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    This only happened one other time... wiped 
                    out a whole family in Montreal --
                            (spots something)
                    Francisco - here you are.

                                  GEORGE
                            (hopeful)
                    I'm there? You found me?

      George looks on; amazed. He pushes one button on the       computer keyboard.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    That should do it.

                                  GEORGE
                    One button?

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    Don't tell anyone, okay?

                                  GEORGE
                            (nodding)
                    I'll try to erase this entire experience.

      At the computer, when George enters, looking pensive. One 
      of the weapons crates is on top of Sike's desk.

      While Sikes works with the computer, George studies the

                    who's making the guns. Look at the crate.

                    Freeze! Police!

      There's a scramble. Rider pulls his gun, darts behind 
      coffins, starts to shoot. Others take cover. Sikes gives 
      chase. More shooting. Sikes pulls up behind some boxes, 
      readies his gun, turns to find:

      MISS GRACE holding a gun on him.

                                  MISS GRACE
                    Tell your people to let us go. Tell them 
                    NOW!

      Sikes lays down his gun. She doesn't withdraw, instead she 
      cocks the gun, aiming, when:

                                  GEORGE
                      I wouldn't do that if I were you.

      REVEAL the barrel of a gun held at the back of her head, by 
      George.


      Everything is finally finished. The room looks like a 
      little bit of Tencton. George is lounging on one of his now 
      chairs, opening his mail, enjoying the U.V. rays, as Susan 
      enters.

                                  SUSAN
                    I can't believe it's finally finished.

                    just fine...

      She starts to protest, then says nothing.

                    Yes, but next time we should make it bigger 
                    - add more rone pods and strune stones --                                  SUSAN
