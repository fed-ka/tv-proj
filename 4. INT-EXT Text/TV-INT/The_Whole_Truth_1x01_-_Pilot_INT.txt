  A family eats breakfast.  GLEN SELLARDS (40s), his wife 
  JOLENE (30s), their twins BRIANNA and ZACH (15).  Jolene  *
  wears a head scarf.  Glen counts out her morning pills, pours  *
  her orange juice, sets down some cinnamon toast.   *

                                        JOLENE *
                Stop fussing over me, I m fine. *

  But she s obviously putting on a good face, and everyone s *
  gloomy.  Glen springs into action, folding his hands on the  *
  table and imitating his wife: *

                                        GLEN *
                 Stop fussing over me, Glen, I  *
                prefer cinnamon toast.  *

                                        JOLENE *
                              (giggling) *
                I do not sound like that. *

                                        ZACH *
                            (cracking up) *
                You totally do, Mom. *

                                        BRIANNA *
                Wait, wait, I can do Dad!   I teach  *
                                                school, and  *
                I m a total geek!  *


  This imitation is Michael KatcherHistory class in high spot on, and they all BUST OUT LAUGHING.   *
  Jolene leans in and kisses her husband gratefully; he s magic  *
  to her.  The moment is cut short by at KNOCK at the door.  At  *
  this hour?  Brianna goes off to see who it is.  She returns  *
  with TWO PATROLMEN. *

                                        PATROLMAN
                Glen Sellards, you are under  
                arrest for the murder of Maria 
                Covas.

  As Glen s cuffed and read his rights, his family silently  *
    implodes... *



  The giant window of a spartan living room shows SUNRISE OVER  *
    MANHATTAN.  KATHRYN PEALE (40s), a make-up-less beauty in a  *
  TJ Maxx pantsuit, stares out.  Her boyfriend JOSEPH (20s)  *
  ambles in and curls around her.

    Arraignment. JUDGE RAHIM (50s) presides.  We INTERCUT between  *

                In fact, it had been her family s  *
                dream that she would one day devote  *
                herself to religious life.   *

  Glen Sellards sits in the gallery, scared shitless, his  *
  FAMILY AND FRIENDS behind him.  The FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF  *
  MARIA COVAS are out in equal force across the aisle.  The  *
  Judge shuffles some papers.  Everyone in the courtroom sits  *

  Three floors above the courtroom.  SEVERAL HUNDRED ADAs are  *

                Chad Griffin s our third.  How can 
                the DA let that tiny trust fund

                Sorry, I forgot about your years in 
                the veddy fancy world of commercial 
                  litigation.

                You bet your ass you are.  Okay,  *
                these charges are bullcaca.  Glen 
                Sellards - a teacher who s 24/7 
                about his students - is an easy 
                mark.  He takes care of a sick 
                wife, tutors ESL kids on the 
                weekends - there s no room in his 
                schedule for murder.  So why is the  *
                DA is targeting Glen, and not a  *
                hundred other better suspects? *

                Only faculty had access to the area 
                where the body was found, and Glen 
                would sneak cigarettes there.

                                        JIMMY

                Similar ways, yes.  But not the  *
                same way. *

  The place is packed for summations.  Glen Sellards can barely 
  sit up.  His FAMILY AND FRIENDS cluster behind him.  Across  *
  the aisle, THE COVAS FAMILY AND FRIENDS cling to each other.   *

                Only one of these girls withstood *
                Glen Sellards  barrage of phone  *
                calls.  Only one of these girls  *

                  ritualistic markings on Maria s  *
                body.  When magnified, these  *
                markings turn out to be Native  *

                The Medical Examiner testified the 
                wounds were made with a small 
                  instrument.  I submit that 
                  instrument was Maria Covas  
                  Quincea os crucifix.  The crucifix  *
                Todd Engler mentioned as once being  *
                in Glen Sellards possession.  It  *
                  represented Maria s connection to  *
                the girl she was leaving behind,  *
                and the woman she was trying to  *
                become.  Sellards couldn t bear  *
                that transition, so at 3:30 PM on  *
                November 11th, he met her in the  *
