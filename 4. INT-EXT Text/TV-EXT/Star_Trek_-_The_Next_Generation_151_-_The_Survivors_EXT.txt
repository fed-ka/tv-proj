       Captain's log, Stardate 43042.3. 
       We are cautiously entering the 
       Delta Rana star system three 
       days after receiving a distress 
       call from the Federation colony 
       on its ninth planet.

     The house, a typical twenty-fourth century colonial structure, 
     stands alone on its plot of trees and grass surrounded 
     on all sides by scorched earth. There is no sign of 
     life, inside or out. 
 
      9    ANGLE ON FRONT OF HOUSE (OPTICAL) 
 
     As the away team MATERIALIZES in the protection of a 
     grove of trees near the house's front door. Riker 
     wants an instant survey. 
 
         RIKER 
       What can you tell me? 
 
         GEORDI 
       The house is a typical settlement 
       structure with adaptations. Its 
       thermal properties all seem to 
       conform to known materials.

       One individual is located at the 
       south end of the house, the other 
       toward the north. There is a 
       weapon -- a low-yield phaser, 
       nonfunctional -- in proximity to 
       the front-room individual. 
 
     Riker considers all of this. 
 
         RIKER 
       I guess a frontal assault is 
       unwarranted. Stay here. I'm 
       going to try an old-fashioned 
       knock on the door. 
 
      10   NEW ANGLE - RIKER 
 
     Riker leaves the cover of the trees and moves toward 
     the house. Suddenly Geordi sees something -- 
 
         GEORDI 
       Commander, there's a -- 
 
     Too late. Riker steps into a concealed snare that 
     hauls him up into a tree by one foot. The others leave 
     cover to help him. The noise and confusion is 
     considerable. 
 
      11   ANGLE - FRONT DOOR OF HOUSE 
 
     An elderly man, KEVIN UXBRIDGE, comes cautiously out 
     of the house, holding the phaser. 
 
         KEVIN 
       Who's there? Who are you people? 
 
     The away team stops in its effort to get Riker down 
     and faces the threat. Riker, still hanging, has the 
     presence to respond. 
 
         RIKER 
       Commander William Riker, USS 
       Enterprise, and crewmembers. May 
       I get down and approach you, sir? 
 
     Data and Geordi go back to helping Riker. 
 
         KEVIN 
       You leave him right where he is.

         RIKER 
       No. 
        (to Kevin) 
       We're a rescue party. We picked 
       up your colony's distress call 
       and came as fast as we could. 
 
     Just then an elderly woman, RISHON UXBRIDGE, appears 
     at the front door. While Kevin is a naturally 
     suspicious person, she is naturally trustful. She is 
     thrilled to see the rescuers. She gently scolds Kevin. 
 
         RISHON 
       Kevin, what are you doing? Can't 
       you see they're here to help us? 
       Can't you see they're human? 
 
         KEVIN

     As Rishon ignores Kevin and approaches the away team. 
     There are tears of joy in her eyes. Riker slips down 
     out of the tree. 
 
         RISHON 
       We'd just about given up hope. 
       We thought maybe the whole 
       Federation had been attacked.

       Do you know of any other 
       survivors? 
 
     Rishon looks at her with desperate eyes.

     shaky tone of voice --

       They came in a spaceship so big 
       you could see it up in orbit. 
       They took our world apart piece

         RIKER 
       Who? 
 
         KEVIN 
       We don't know. We never saw 
       their faces. 
 
         RIKER 
       You don't know where they came 
       from -- where they are now? 
 
         KEVIN 
        (shakes head) 
       I guess they've gone away. 
 
     Beverly takes out her medical tricorder and scans the 
     couple. They react. Beverly is apologetic. 
 
         BEVERLY 
       I'm sorry. I'm only performing 
       a physical. Could I have your 
       names please -- for the record.

       Mister Uxbridge, as far as we've 
       been able to determine, you and 
       your wife -- and this house -- 
       are all that survived the attack. 
       It was either a bizarre 
       coincidence or by design. I 
       don't favor the coincidence 
       theory. 
 
         KEVIN

       I'm not accusing you of anything,

       on Rana -- a matter replicator. 
       It has limited capabilities, but...
