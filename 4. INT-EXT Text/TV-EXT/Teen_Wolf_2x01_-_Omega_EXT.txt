      Beneath the nearly full moon, down past the winter-bare 
      branches of Beacon Hills s woods, not a blade of grass stirs 
      in the peculiar quiet. Until...

      DEER BURST out of the darkness.

      Hooves pounding leaves to dust, the frightened animals 
      scatter to reveal A DARK FIGURE behind them, moving with a 
      speed that can only be described as supernatural.

      Charging out of the woods and into shadowy streets, the 
      figure races faster and faster--


      Down through the dark, puddle-strewn alleys of the town s 
      industrial sector--


      Into a suburban backyard where a BARKING DOG races out, 
      snapping against its chain and then--


      Bounding toward the street, looking as if to collide with 
      oncoming cars. But then a FOOT touches down on the roof of a 
      truck. 

      Time slows as the figure launches into the moonlight to 
      reveal--

      SCOTT MCCALL. Werewolf. But not entirely a wolf tonight. 

      Untransformed, he lopes on bare hands, seemingly racing for 
      his life. But when his palms push off the ground, he blinks 
      and in a BRILLIANT WHITE FLASH-- 

      He sees himself. Somewhere in daylight. Kissing Allison 
      Argent. Lips moving from her mouth to her neck.

      Scott s feet hit the ground, yanking him back to the present. 
      But with another blink, he flashes again to the past.    TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/112.



      SLAMMING to the pavement, Scott barely has a moment to gasp 
      when a hand wraps around his throat.

      It s ARGENT, Allison s father, nearly strangling him with one 
      hand while the other aims the barrel of a Desert Eagle at his 
      head. Choking, Scott blinks--


      Back to the present, where he charges forward while the 
      memory of Allison s frightened protests ricochet through his 
      mind.

                                    ALLISON (V.O.)
                      No--don t--don t!


      Allison tries to pull her father back.

                                    ALLISON
                    You can t. He saved our lives. Your 
                    life. You can t do this.

      She pushes herself between Scott and the gun.*

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    If you kill him, you kill me. Do 
                    you get it?

      But Argent s grip on Scott s throat only seems to tighten.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Let him go and--I ll do whatever 
                    you want. I ll be what you want. 
                    And--and I won t see him again. I 
                    promise. I won t even look at him. 
                    Ever again.

      Finally withdrawing the gun, Argent releases Scott.

      Blinking back to the present, Scott bounds off the roof of a 
      garage and soars right through--

      She peers out while mere inches away, Scott holds still. 
      Finally, Victoria SLAMS the window shut.


      Still on the roof outside listening to Allison and her 
      mother, Scott s head snaps up when another SOUND comes 
      hurtling through the wind. 

      A SCREAM. One he recognizes immediately.

      FADE IN:


      THE MOON. Two, maybe three days from being full. Strangely, 
      the image of the glowing sphere ripples as if made out of 
      liquid.

      Then the reflection breaks apart and Jackson Whittemore *
      bursts up from the freezing cold water of a creek. 

      He sucks in gulps of air as he splashes about. Shirt ripped, *
      it hangs in tatters from his pale body.

      Then he seems to remember something. Hand moving to his side, 
      he twists around to feel the skin at his lower back. 

      It's there. A gaping, bloody wound. An Alpha Werewolf s bite.

      Water dripping from his moon-glistened torso, he rises to his 
      feet for a better look at the jagged tear in his skin. He *
      gazes on it with a kind of reverence, and then... *

      The beginnings of a smile.


      Beyond a wrought iron gate in the small Beacon Hills 
      Cemetery, a newly planted headstone reads: Katherine Argent.

      A BACKHOE LOADER eases past. With a HYDRAULIC HISS, it drops 
      a pile of dirt next to the grave.

      Operating the loader from the center of the glass-encased cab 
      is a sixteen year-old named ISAAC LAHEY. Headphones jammed in 
      his ears, hard crunching guitars pound through his head while 
      he works.

      With the grave digging nearly complete, he reaches for the 
      gear shift and glances in the REAR VIEW MIRROR to back up. 

      But then pauses to give a weary look at his BLACK EYE.

      Glancing away with more than a little shame at his own 
      reflection, Isaac shifts to REVERSE.

      The loader backs up. But just as it s rolling to a stop, 
      SOMETHING appears in the glass of the cab.

      A SILHOUETTED FIGURE crouches in between two nearby 
      headstones. It blinks with GLOWING YELLOW EYES.

      INSIDE THE CAB - Isaac shuts off the ignition and removes his 
      headphones. In the quiet, he holds still, as if feeling *
      something watching him...  TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/1113.

      CONTINUED:2828

      Turning to his right, his eyes jump from headstone to 
      headstone. Nothing there.

      He slowly lets his gaze wander over the cemetery while the 
      only sound in the cab seems to be his ever-shortening breath.

      And then he sees something...

      ILLUMINATED BY THE LOADER S HEADLIGHTS, he spots a HAND over 
      the top of the gravestone. Its fingers taper into animal-like 
      CLAWS. 

                                  ISAAC
                    What the hell...

      As he leans forward to get a better look, the hand slips away 
      from the grave. There s a flash of black behind the stone. A 
      dark figure moves lightning quick through the shadows.

      HEADED RIGHT FOR HIM. 

      It launches forward in a bounding lope. Moving incredibly 
      fast.

      Isaac goes for the ignition to turn the loader back on. But 
      not quickly enough.

      SOMETHING BARRELS right into the loader, sending it tipping 
      up on its tires. The machine SLAMS DOWN on its side right 
      over the open grave.

      The door to the cab clatters open, dropping Isaac into the 
      grave with a TERRIFIED CRY.

      He hits the bottom with a painful thud. Then rolls over to 
      look up at the backhoe loader covering the grave.

      SOMETHING LEAPS ONTO IT, rattling the machine. But then 
      bounds off just as quickly.

      Isaac tries to hold his breath, tries to halt his frightened 
      gasps. Pulling himself back against the dirt wall of the 
      grave, he listens.

      Strange, animal-like sounds come from nearby. A stream of 
      feral growls. Becoming more and more urgent.

      Gathering his courage, Isaac rises up, looking past the edge 
      to see--

      AT A NEARBY GRAVE - A hunched over figure quickly digs and 
      tears at the earth, pulling up a just buried CASKET.  TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/1114.

      CONTINUED:2828

      Isaac flinches at the thing s HIGH PITCHED, URGENT SHRIEKS. 
      Pulling back into the darkness, he hears the CRACKING and 
      SMASHING of WOOD, sounds of rending and tearing. Until the 
      sounds abruptly--

      STOP.

      Holding still, Isaac hears another GROWL. But this one s an 
      earth-shaking ROAR and clearly not the same animal.

      It's followed by the sound of quick movement. The first 
      creature racing away in terrified retreat, its breathless 
      WHIMPERS giving way to silence again.

      Then the backhoe loader begins to RISE. Incredibly, the 
      entire machine lifts up off the grave and tips back down onto 
      its tires, right side up.

      BLACK BOOTS walk slowly, purposefully around the grave.

      Cowering in the dark, Isaac finally raises his head to gaze 
      up at the powerful and intimidating figure of DEREK HALE 
      standing at the edge.

                                  DEREK

      Under an eerie quiet, Scott, Allison and Stiles approach the

      grave. Smashed pieces of a casket lie amid clumps of dirt, 
      barely concealing the remains of a just buried corpse.

                    It s Lahey. Isaac Lahey.

      Sheriff Stilinski looks up from his note pad to Isaac and his 
      father, MR. LAHEY who peers over his wire-rimmed GLASSES with 
      suspicious eyes.

                      I understand, but I ve got a 
                    missing girl and this is where our 
                    K9 unit led us. She s got no 
                    clothes and if she s still out here 
                    tonight when the temperature really 
                    drops...

                                  ISAAC
                    Sorry, but I didn t see anything.

                                  LAHEY
                    Trust me, if he d seen a naked girl 
                    outside of a computer screen, he d 
                    remember it.

      Lahey laughs derisively while Isaac stares at the ground. 
      Stilinski notices the bruise under the boy s eye.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Isaac, how did you get that black

      Lahey glares at Isaac, waiting for his answer. Stilinski, 
      however, keeps his eyes on the father, gauging his reaction.  TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/1120.

      For a brief moment, Isaac gazes past Stilinski to notice--

      Derek Hale. Watching and listening just beyond the cemetery s

      Stilinski notices he s lost Isaac s attention. But when he 
      follows the boy s gaze, Derek is gone.

      Past the smashed wood of the casket he can just glimpse the

      Distraught and exhausted, Scott and Stiles head to the

                    was missing. And if she did? So 
                    what? It s the most nutritious part

                    Yeah. But she was looking for 
                    Jackson.

      They both turn when they hear the familiar growl of a PORSCHE 
      CARRERA tearing into the parking lot.

      A HOMELESS MAN rifling through a school trash can looks up as 
      the Porsche whips into the space in front of him. 

      Aviators still on, Jackson steps out with his backpack and 
      lacrosse stick.

      With an exasperated sigh, Jackson pulls out his wallet.

      people with cameras behind A-Frame barricades. At the same 
      time, Argent attempts to lead his family to the funeral site.

      with cameras. She glances about, looking for Scott amid the 
      faces.

                    Just sit down, sweetheart.

      Someone with a camera manages to slip between two barricades. 
      It's Matt, the kid from school who complimented Allison's 
      dress.

      Snapping pictures, he doesn t see THE HAND reach up to grab 
      the lens. The camera comes right out of Matt's grasp and into 
      the hands of an older, rather menacing looking well-dressed 
      man named GERARD.

      Matt turns to see THREE OTHER WELL-DRESSED MEN also standing 
      around him. Practically surrounding him.

      With a click, the MEMORY CARD slips out of a slot in the

                    How expensive is this?

      He SNAPS the memory card in half. Then with a smile, he drops 
      the camera back into Matt s hands.

      While Allison watches, the older man walks over to Argent and 
      puts his arms around him in a warm embrace.

      Furious, he drags them away from the funeral proceedings and 
      to his patrol car.


      Shrouded by trees, Stiles s Jeep sits on a dirt path. A few 
      yards ahead, Scott and Stiles keep low to the ground as they 
      approach flashing RED and BLUE LIGHTS.*

      Peering out through the branches, they spot the AMBULANCE on 
      the opposite side of the road. Moving from tree to tree, 
      Scott and Stiles slowly catch a view of the blood-spattered 
      interior.

      A seriously freaked out AMBULANCE DRIVER appears to be trying 
      to explain what happened to an equally freaked out DEPUTY.

      Propelling himself through the darkness, the transformation 
      begins to take hold.

      His ears taper to points. Hair rises on his cheeks. Teeth *

      Racing so fast, the world around him blurs out of focus. He *
      goes down to lope on all fours. No longer just a teenager-- *

      But a werewolf.


      From the treetops above, Scott can be seen, a lone, dark 
      figure moving incredibly fast. Leaping over fallen trees, 
      darting around thick pines.

      SOMETHING appears in frame just ahead of him. Another loping *

      He lashes out at the dark figure ahead and both of them go 
      tumbling to the forest floor.

      Crashing and rolling to a stop through the leaves and brush, 
      Scott instantly leaps back to his feet as--

      The dark figure charges toward him.

      Barely able to see in the darkness, Scott, nevertheless, 
      moves with uncanny speed. Claws out, he pushes up, sending 
      the other werewolf right over his head.

      The monster crashes to the ground in a flurry of dust and 
      leaves. When it twists around to bare its teeth, Scott gets a 
      surprise.

      and darts into the shadows.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Wait--

      But the creature is already moving. And moving fast.


      The RED AND BLUE LIGHTS on the ambulance continue flashing. 
      But the perspective is from the woods. Moving slowly, 
      shakily, as if being drawn to the light.

      It approaches to see not only the Driver but several 
      Deputies, Stilinski and Stiles. All trying to make sense of 
      the bloodied interior of the vehicle.

      A pale, dirty HAND pulls down a branch to get past. Stiles is *
      the first to notice the shivering girl in the woods.*

                                  STILES
                    Lydia?

      The voice sounds far away at first. But when the call comes 
      again, the name crystallizes, hitting the girl like a shock.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Lydia?

      Arms covering herself, she blinks. With brush and tree leaves 
      barely concealing her lower half, she finds herself looking 
      at Stilinski, his Deputies, the Driver and a very wide-eyed 
      Stiles.

      Lydia stares at them in confusion. They stare back. Everyone 
      staring uncomfortably. Finally, Lydia throws up her arms, 
      revealing her frustration... among other things.

                                  LYDIA
                    Well? Anyone going to get me a 
                    coat?

      Grasping for his father's jacket as his knees go weak, Stiles 
      collapses out of frame.  TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/1138.



      Charging out of the darkness, Scott SPLASHES through the 
      creek where Jackson first woke. He spots the second werewolf 
      going up the bank.

                                  SCOTT
                    Wait! Stop!

      As the creature crests the hill it never notices--

      THE TRIPWIRE.

      CORD WHIPS THROUGH THE AIR. Yelping, the werewolf's head *
      snaps around in yellow-eyed terror as he goes up, hands 
      lassoed above him.

      When Scott starts forward to help him, TWO HANDS grab him by *
      his jacket and yank him back. Lifted right off his feet, 
      Scott goes flying.

      HE SLAMS INTO A TREE. Then falls, slumping into the dirt as 
      TWO GLOWING RED EYES seep out from the shadows.

      Derek pulls him to his feet, dragging him back into the cover 
      of the woods.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    What are you doing? I can help him.

                                  DEREK
                    They re already here--*

                                  SCOTT
                    I can help him--*

                    Quiet.

      Scott stops struggling. He hears movement. BOOTS crushing 
      leaves. Then he sees them...

      THE HUNTERS arrive, bursting through the mist to find their 
      prey caught and hanging helplessly.*

      Argent approaches with several men behind him. One in 
      particular takes his time: his father, Gerard.  TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/1139.

      Argent withdraws a STUN BATON. With a sharp flick of his 
      wrist it telescopes out, CRACKLING with BLUE BOLTS of 
        ELECTRICITY.

      The trapped werewolf SNARLS in fear as--

      Argent whips the baton up and connects the tip to its body. A 
      BLUE FLASH briefly LIGHTS the woods as the werewolf s CRY 
      turns to a very human SCREAM.

      In the blink of an eye, the wolf is transformed back into a 
      man. One immediately familiar to Scott...

      It s the Homeless Man who was rifling through the trash at 
      school. The one who told Jackson he had a nice car.

                                  ARGENT
                    Who are you?

      The Homeless Man simply sputters in fear.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    What are you doing here?

                                  HOMELESS MAN
                      Nothing--Nothing, I swear.

                                  ARGENT
                    You re not from here, are you? Are 
                    you?

      Terrified, the Homeless Man shakes his head.

                                  HOMELESS MAN
                    No. No, I came--I came looking for 
                    the Alpha.

      Argent and Gerard share a look.

                                  HOMELESS MAN (CONT D)
                    I heard rumors, I heard there was--
                    I heard he was here. That s all. I 
                    didn t do anything. I didn t hurt 
                    anyone. No one living. He wasn t 
                    alive in the ambulance. He wasn t, 
                    I swear.

      Gerard turns to the other hunters. 

                                  GERARD
                      Gentlemen, come a little closer and

                    The lone wolf.

      Gerard approaches another Hunter and pulls something from the 
      man s backpack. 

      FROM THE SHADOWS NEARBY - Scott focuses on the object which 
      appears to be some kind of sheathed LONG SWORD.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Possibly kicked out of his own 
                    pack. Or the survivor of a pack 
                    that was hunted down. Maybe even 
                    murdered.

      Gerard removes a razor-sharp BLADE from the scabbard.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Possibly alone by his own choice. *
                    Certainly not a wise choice.

      IN THE SHADOWS - Derek s grip on Scott tightens as Gerard s 
      words land with a heavy weight on him.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Because, as I m about to 
                      demonstrate...

      Gerard lifts the blade with both hands.

                    An Omega rarely survives on its 
                    own.

      With one swift and startlingly powerful movement, Gerard 
      whips the blade around. Right across the torso of the 
      Homeless Man.

      Scott LURCHES forward. With every ounce of his strength, 
      Derek pulls him back, arms wrapped around Scott as he gasps 
      at the shocking display of violence.

      The lower half of the Homeless Man s body falls to the 
      ground.

      Feet digging into the dirt and leaves, Scott tries to wrest 
      himself free of Derek.  TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/1141.

                    Look. Look at them. You see what 
                    they do? This is why you need me. 
                    Why we need each other. The only 
                    way to fight them is together. 

      Finally, Scott s own body goes slack as Derek holds him still 
      in the shadows.

      He stabs the blade into the ground.

      The wind seems to take Gerard s VOICE out of the woods and *
      into the town of Beacon Hills where--


      A troubled Scott gathers Allison into his arms as they sit 
      together on a rock face overlooking the light-dappled town.
