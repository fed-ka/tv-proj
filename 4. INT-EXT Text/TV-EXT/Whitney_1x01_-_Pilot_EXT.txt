      THE CREW SITS AT THE TABLE IN THE WAY BACK.   

                                    WHITNEY

                How was I supposed to know she was 

                going to wear yellow?! I mean, she 

                looks like a giant legal pad. 

                                  LILY

                It s not your fault. Weddings are 

                getting more and more modern. Last 

                month a friend of mine got married in 

                a barn.  

                                    ROXANNE

                In yellow?                                                                                      8.


                                  LILY

                Oh. No. Her dress was white. But, by 

                the end of the night it was more of 

                  a...beige-y brownish.  

      THE BRIDE AND GROOM (ABBEY, 30, JEFF, 30) COME OVER TO GREET 
      THE TABLE.  

                      WHITNEYALEX

      Hey! Congratulations. Congrats, guys. 

                                    WHITNEY

                Abbey, I m really sorry I wore yellow. 

                  I thought you were going to wear 

                  white...because that s what people 

                have been doing for hundreds of years. 

                In pretty much every culture. 

                                  ABBEY

                It s okay. It s not your fault.   

                                    WHITNEY

                I know. (THEN) So, how long are you 

                planning on being married for? 

                                  ALEX

                She s kidding. 

      SHE S HALF-KIDDING. THE COUPLE LAUGHS.  

                                  JEFF

                So, when are you guys going to tie the 

                knot? 

                                    WHITNEY

                Eh. We re good. 

                                  ALEX

                Whitney and I are basically married.                                                                                        9.


                                    WHITNEY

                I just feel like marriage is when all 

                the problems start. You see a 

                  perfectly happy couple, they get 

                married, then boom! All the fighting 

                begins. 

      THE COUPLE LOOKS CONCERNED.

                                    WHITNEY (CONT D)

                But not you two! You two are going to 

                beat the odds. (THEN) This is not 

                going well. (THEN) The chicken is 

                awesome-

                                  ALEX

                Whitney? 

                                    WHITNEY

                Yep. 

      THE BRIDE AND GROOM MOVE ON TO THE NEXT TABLE. 

                                    WHITNEY (CONT D)

                Please tell me you got them a good 

                present. 

                                  ALEX

                Not good enough to fix that. 

      MARK LOOKS AT NEAL. 

                                  MARK

                Dude, why the hell are you wearing a 

                pink shirt?

                                  NEAL

                It s Prada. Lily picked it out for me.                                                                                     10.


                                  MARK

                Bro, you can t wear things your 

                  girlfriend picks out for you. Next 

                thing you know you re going to wear a 

                condom just because a girl wants you 

                to. 

                                  NEAL

                I can t use condoms. I m allergic to 

                  spermicide. 

      BEAT. 

                                  MARK

                Dude, that s a good one. Thanks, man. 

                I m gonna use that.

                                  SARAH

                Right. You date that photographer girl 

                who hates everything and is really 

                nasal? 

                                  ALEX

                Yup. That s Whitney. 

      SHE SMILES. 

                                  SARAH

                Well, I don t see a ring. It must not 

                be that serious. 

      WHITNEY RETURNS, EATING A GIANT PIECE OF CAKE. SHE SITS ON 
      THE OTHER SIDE OF ALEX.  

                                    WHITNEY

                Alex, do you have the Beano or do I? I 

                can t find it and I m really gassy. 

      ALEX PULLS A BOTTLE OUT OF HIS JACKET AND GIVES IT TO 
      WHITNEY.

      DISGUSTED, SARAH GETS UP AND WALKS AWAY. ANOTHER WEDDING

                                    WEDDING GUEST

                You two are so cute. How long have you 

                two been together?

                                  ALEX

                About five years. 

                                    WHITNEY

                What? No. Four maybe. What?                                                                                    12.

                      (DOING THE MATH)

                Wait, five years next week. We met on 

                Labor day in 2005 because that s when 

                you shot our family Christmas card-

                                    WHITNEY
                      (FAKE EXHAUSTED)

                We get it, your parents are happily 

                married. 

                                    WEDDING GUEST

                What are you going to do for your 

                  anniversary? 

                                    WHITNEY

                We re not like that. 

                                    WEDDING GUEST

                You don t celebrate anniversaries?

                                    WHITNEY

                I have a bad back. 

                                  ALEX

                Last year Whitney took an Ambien at 

                noon by accident and the year before 

                she took Tylenol PM on purpose. Also 

                around noon. 

                                    WEDDING GUEST

                My marriage fell apart because we 

                stopped putting work into our 

                  relationship. 

                                    ROXANNE

                Same thing happened to me. Me and my 

                  ex-husband stopped having sex and 

                things got platonic.                                                                                      13.


                                    WEDDING GUEST

                Same here. Our therapist said healthy 

                couples should have sex at least four 

                or five times a week.  

      WHITNEY IS TAKEN ABACK. 

                                    WHITNEY

                With each other?!

      WHITNEY IS VISIBLY DISTURBED. THIS CLEARLY ISN T WHITNEY AND 
      ALEX S ROUTINE. 

                                    WHITNEY (CONT D)

                Five times a week?! Who has time for 

                that? 

      WHITNEY NERVOUSLY SHOVES THE REST OF THE CAKE INTO HER MOUTH. 

                                    WHITNEY (CONT D)

                I mean, people have jobs! 

      LILY RUNS OVER. 

                                  LILY

                C mon! They re going to cut the cake! 

      WHITNEY FREEZES. EVERYONE NOTICES THAT WHITNEY S OBVIOUSLY 
      BEEN EATING THE WEDDING CAKE THIS WHOLE TIME. JEFF AND 
      ABBEY S WEDDING CAKE. THE CAKE THAT IS ABOUT TO BE CUT. THAT 
      WAS ALREADY CUT. BY WHITNEY.  


      WHITNEY, LILY, AND ROXANNE STAND OUTSIDE A SEX SHOP. IN THE 
      WINDOW ARE BLOW UP DOLLS ARRANGED IN SEXUAL POSITIONS. 

                                    ROXANNE

                What are we doing here? I better not 

                run into anyone I know from work. 

                                    WHITNEY

                I m going to have amazing sex on my 

                  anniversary if it kills me. 


      ALEX, NEAL, AND MARK STAND OUTSIDE THE TIFFANY S WINDOW IN 
      THE EXACT FORMATION THE GIRLS WERE IN OUTSIDE THE SEX SHOP.                                                                                     27.


                                  MARK

                Why are we here? I better not run into 

                anyone I know from work.

                I m going to ask Lily to marry me. 

                                  ALEX

                Congrats again, man. That s so cool. 

                                  MARK

                Dude. You re getting engaged? That s 

                gay. 

                                  ALEX

                  Actually, it s the opposite of gay. 

                                  MARK

                As soon as a man gets engaged, he 

                turns gay: living in a house with 

                throw pillows everywhere, you start 

                wearing jewelry, you stop having sex 

                with women. Neal, you gotta snap out 

                of this. You ve been brainwashed by 

                society into buying Lily a cubic 

                  zerconia!  

                                  ALEX

                  diamonds.

                You re buying her a real diamond?! Are 

                you crazy?!
