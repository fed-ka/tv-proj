Evan walks out his front door. WE REVEAL he is walking
towards Seth's car.
EVAN
(still into phone)
Yeah. Just tell them your taking a class
on blow jobs.
They both hang up and Evan gets in the car. Seth is about to
pull away, when EVAN'S MOTHER comes out the front door.
EVAN'S MOM
Thanks for taking him, Seth.
Evan changes the radio station. Seth slaps his hand.
SETH
Don't touch that!
EVAN'S MOM
You two are so funny. I can't imagine
what you'll do without each other next
year. Evan told me you didn't get into
State.
SETH
Yeah, you know. I got some other places.
Good places. I think we'll be fine.
EVAN'S MOM
Are you going to miss each other?
EVAN
Miss each other? No!

That's disgusting.
MOM
Bye, boys.
Seth and Evan drive off.
SETH
I am truly, truly jealous that you got to
suck on those tits when you were a baby.
EVAN
Fuck you, man.

They drive up to Clark Secondary. There is a giant sign that
reads "Seniors - Two Glorious Weeks Until Graduation". Seth
turns into the STAFF parking lot.

Seth and Evan walk past a group of smokers, towards the 7-11.
EVAN
You're being an idiot, man. You really
shouldn't park there.
SETH
Fuck it. I'm a senior about to graduate.
They should be suckin' my balls. It's the
least they can do for stealing three
years of my life.
They walk past DIMITRI (18, big Native American guy) as they
enter the store. Dimitri aggressively bumps his shoulder into
Seth.
EVAN
What the hell's wrong with Dimitri?
SETH
Oh, yeah dude, I forgot to tell you. I
knocked the fuckin' shit out of him in
capture the flag last week.
EVAN
Good! 9th Grade Camp he gave me whiplash
in "King of the Ring." I fucking hate
that guy.
They go to the magazine rack and stare at a Maxim cover.

EVAN (CONT'D)
Look at those nipples.
SETH
They're like baby toes.
EVAN
It's not fair. I have to hide every
erection I get.
SETH
Sometimes I get boners so big I can't
hide them. And then I get nervous and my
heart starts pounding, and it all just,
like, feeds my boner. It just becomes
this...thing...that's attached to me. And
it won't go away.
EVAN
Just imagine if girls weren't weirded out
by our boners and they actually wanted to
see `em, like this shit.
SETH
You know it's been, like, a year and a
half since I've seen an actual human
female nipple. Besides my mom's. I saw it
last month, and it was sick.
EVAN
Holy shit. Liat was two years ago? I
guess so. She was insanely hot, though.
SETH
Exactly. Too hot. That's what sucks.
EVAN
How can that possibly suck? I'd be
fuckin' psyched if I'd gotten with a girl
that hot. You got, like, two dozen
handjobs!
SETH
And three quarters of a blowjob, But that
was fuckin' it. It was the peak of my ass-
gettin' career, and it happened way, way,
way too early.
EVAN
You're like Orson Welles.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

SETH
Exactly! If I'd built up to it, I'd
probably at least be having steady sex
with a mediocre-looking girl at this
point. I honestly now see why Orson
Welles ate his fat ass to death.
EVAN
You'll have sex in college. Everyone
does. And if not, you'll have the Bang
Bus.
SETH
But the key is to be good at sex by the
time you're in college. You don't want
girls to think you suck dick at fucking.
EVAN
I still think you've got a chance with
Jules. She got mad hot over last summer,
and clearly hasn't realized it, `cause
she still flirts with you.
SETH
Are you joking, man? Let's see here...she
dated Dan Remick, Matt Muir, Josh Corber
and what's-his-face. All of those were
cool guys. She's been hot way longer than
you think. Why would she end her high
school career with me?
EVAN
Well, Helen got with Ariel Shafir.
SETH
Yeah, and he was a complete fucking
loser. You're a step up from that. Which
is why you should stop being a pussy and
do her! You could nailthe shit out of
her for, like, two months before you
leave. That bitch looks like a good
fucker.
EVAN
Hey! I'm sick of you talking about her
like that, man!
Evan starts to walk out. Seth follows.
SETH
What, you can talk about that bitch all
day every single day, but I can't say one
thing about her?
(CONTINUED)

EVAN
I don't constantly insult her.
SETH
I didn't insult her! I said she looks
like a good fucker! She looks like she
can take a dick. That's a good thing.
Some women pride themselves on their dick-
taking abilities.

Seth and Evan come out the front doors. TERRY, one of the
rough-looking smokers, calls out.
TERRY
Yo. Seth. Did you hear I'm having the big
grad party?
Evan, a little scared, keeps his distance.
SETH
No.
TERRY
Yeah.
Terry spits on Seth's shirt.
TERRY (CONT'D)
And you're not coming. Tell your fucking
faggot friend he can't come either.
Seth wipes the spit off. He looks at Terry and seems as
though he's about to say something, but is interrupted when
Terry starts hocking up more spit. Seth runs away as Terry
and his friends laugh. He catches up to Evan and they head
back to school.
EVAN
Wow. You really bitched out on that one.
SETH
I bitched out? You bitched out! You were
across the street before I even realized
what was going on.

BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF A P.E. CLASS
There are 30 guys standing behind the starting line of the
school's track. We hear a TEACHER yell "Go!" and the boys
start running.
We FOLLOW them from above. All the boys keep pretty much the
same pace except for one runner who slowly lags behind. The
group gets so far ahead of the him that he is alone in the
frame. He stops.
CLOSE UP OF THE RUNNER:
Kneeling on the track breathing heavily. It's Seth.
SETH
(panting)
This...is...bullshit.
A moment later a KID with prosthetic leg jogs by.
KID
(as he passes Seth)
Poo-say.

The bouncer of a dirty strip club rejects them.
EVAN
...and then we pretty much called it a
night and went home...

Students file into the home economics room. The blackboard
reads, TODAY: TIRAMISU. The ingredients are listed below.
Seth is talking to the cooking teacher.
SETH
Mrs. Grier, I joined this class because I
thought I'd be cooking with a partner.
It's not fair. She's never here. I don't
get twice the marks for doing all the
work.
MRS. GREIR
I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.
SETH
Look at Evan.
Evan is playfully throwing flour at a tiny Japanese boy. They
both laugh hard.
SETH (CONT'D)
While I'm over in my unit, isolated and
alone, eating my terrible-tasting food
because I can't even properly mix
ingredients by myself, I gotta look over
at that.

The Japanese boy ties Evan's apron. Evan then turns around
and ties the boy's apron. They both look happy.
SETH (CONT'D)
I wash and dry. And that is B.S. I'm like
a single mother.
MRS. GREIR
Well, save it for next week. Today Jules'
partner isn't here either. Pair up with
her. Station four.
SETH
Jules?
The teacher walks away. Seth looks over to station four,
nervous as hell.
ANGLE ON: Jules, well-dressed and "popular" looking.
She
stands alone at station four, laying out utensils.
Seth musters his courage and walks towards Jules. He stops,
unsure of what to say.
JULES
Hey Seth, your partner didn't come again?
SETH
That's kind of a personal question.
JULES
What?
SETH
(nervous)
Nothing. It was my attempt at humour.
JULES
Well, uh, maybe I kidnapped her so you'd
be forced to work with me. There's my
attempt at humour.
SETH
Well, I would call that a success.
(reading recipe sheet)
Marscampone... scamponee cheese? Is that
some kind of new cheese or something?
JULES
All cheese tastes the same to me anyway.
SETH
Except blue cheese. That stuff is sick.

JULES
Thank you! Yes! My older brother always
eats blue cheese. You know that stuff is
actually moldy. Like, they tell you it's
moldy, then they tell you to eat it
anyway.
SETH
Well whoever "they" are, they can eat my
dick.

Evan is standing alone amidst the rest of his gym class as
they play soccer.
GYM TEACHER
Evan, get into the game.
Evan says nothing and the teacher soon redirects his
attention elsewhere. Evan sees Seth jogging towards him.
SETH
(out of breath, worked up)
Man, just - Evan, listen to me. You know
Jules? You know what she just did? She
came up to me and asked me if I would buy
her alcohol. Not just her, her whole
party. Do you know what that means? It
means that by some miracle, we were
paired up, we talked, and she actually
thought of me afterwards. Thought of me
enough to decide that I was the guy that
she was going to trust the fun-ness of
her party with. She wants me! She fucking
wants my dick!
(CONTINUED)

EVAN
Did you ever think maybe she's just using
you to get her alcohol?
SETH
Of course I thought of that! LISTEN TO
THIS!
33

SETH
She has an older brother! She could have
asked him, but she asked me! She looked
me straight in the face and asked me. She
wants to fuck me, man. Do you understand
that? Fucking! Today is the day that
fucking has become possible.
EVAN
Are you stupid? You're not going to be
able to sleep with her tonight.
SETH
She's going to be at the party, she's
gonna be drunk, and she likes me at least
a little, so I can get with her. Then, I
make her my girlfriend, and then I fuck
her all summer long! Then, by the time
college rolls around, I'm the fuckin'
fucking master, man!
EVAN
Make her your girlfriend? Of course!
That's good. So, hypnosis, love potion,
or mind-control helmet?
SETH
Once I've gotten with her, I write her
love letters, flowers, I'll do anything -
I'll be the most pussy-whipped guy in the
universe - what chick wouldn't go out
with a guy like that?

Evan shrugs back.
CLASSMATE (CONT'D)
Fuck you, man.

Fuck off, Greg. Why don't you piss your
pants again?
CLASSMATE
That was, like, eight years ago, asshole!
He runs off.
SETH
(to Evan)
Wanna hear the best part?
EVAN
(sarcastic)
Oh, I haven't?
SETH
Helen!
Evan looks upset, assuming that Seth is about to trash-talk
Helen, as usual.
SETH (CONT'D)
You do the same thing, man! Buy Helen her
alcohol. Then, tonight, when you guys are
both drunk, get with her! This is the
last party we're ever going to go to as
high school people! I've fully ignored my
hatred for Helen in coming up with this,
which is a big ass deal. We need to stop
being pussy and for once just goes balls
out, man!
Evan seems to be swayed.
EVAN
I should get Helen alcohol?
SETH
Of course! It'll be pimp, and then you
know she'll be drunk.

Seth is waiting angrily in front of the school. Evan comes
out the front doors.
SETH
That douche bag isn't back yet, I've been
standing here with my thumb up my ass.
EVAN
I did it, dude. I even offered to pay for
it. It was pimp.
SETH
Whoa. That is fucking pimp. Why didn't I
do that? Shit.
The bell rings.
37
37
Seth and Evan walk out the front door.
SETH
I mean, what are we going to tell the
girls? "Sorry, we couldn't do what we
promised because we're dickless
incompetents!" We'll never get laid
because of that little ass-fuck. How did
he get in to State?! He's got shit for
brains! Shit! How else can we get liquor?

EVAN
Where have you been?
SETH
Yeah! You almost gave me a goddamn heart
attack! You better fucking have it, where
is it?
FOGELL
I got it. It's flawless! It's great, man,
look.
Fogell reaches into his pocket and pulls out the fake ID.
Evan grabs it.
EVAN
(reading the card)
Okay Mr..."McLovin"? What kind of a
stupid name is that? What are you
trying to be, an Irish R&B; singer?
FOGELL
Well, they let you pick any name you want
when you get there.
SETH
So you picked McLovin?
FOGELL
It was between that or Muhammad.
SETH
Why was it between that or Muhammad? Why
didn't you just pick a common name?
FOGELL
Actually, Seth, Muhammad is the most
commonly used name on earth.
EVAN
Have you ever actually met a guy named
Muhammad?
FOGELL
Have you actually ever met a guy named
McLovin?
SETH
No! That's why you picked a bad name.

EVAN
You probably have federal agents tracking
you for even considering the name
Muhammad on a fake ID!
SETH
Look at this shit man, you don't even
have a first name. It just says "NAME:
MCLOVIN"
EVAN
One name?
FOGELL
I just thought McLovin sounded old, and
the chicks would dig it.
EVAN
Under what circumstances would you ever
have to show a chick your ID?
FOGELL
She could ask. Or, I could just show it
to her.
SETH
Holy shit! I don't believe this. This
says you're fucking 25! Why didn't you
just put 21?
FOGELL
I knew you would ask that. Look, every
day, dozens of kids roll into the liquor
store with fake ID's trying to act like
Joe Casual. Each and every one of these
kids just so happens to be 21 years old.
Just how many 21 year-olds do you think
there are?
SETH
Fool!
EVAN
Calm down! It's not terrible! This might
work, but it's up to you, Fogell. They'll
either think, "Oh, it's another punk kid
with a fake ID." Or, "Look, it's McLovin,
the twenty five year-old organ donor".
What's it gonna be?
Fogell takes a deep breath.

FOGELL
I am McLovin.
SETH
You're not McLovin. No one's McLovin and
this is never going to work. We need a
new way to get alcohol. Could we drive to
Canada or something?
FOGELL
I still think it's going to work.
They walk into the staff parking lot. Seth stops.
SETH
What the fuck? Where's my car?
EVAN
I told you, man! What did I say? I told
you that was a dumb idea.
FOGELL
Why would you park in the staff-
SETH
Shut up, Fogell.
FOGELL
`Cause you're not staff.
SETH
I am aware of that, Fagell.
Seth storms off. Evan follows him.
FOGELL
(yelling)
Will you still pick me up from work?
Evan and Seth round the corner, leaving Fogell behind.
SETH
Let's go to your house.

Evan and Seth triumphantly walk away. Seth holds up the gin.
SETH
Look at this mother. Smell it's glory.
He opens it up and takes a whiff.
SETH (CONT'D)
Mmm. It's good. Barely a scent.
He takes a crazy big swig.
SETH (CONT'D)
See that? I always said I had the highest
alcohol tolerance. I'm like Superman.
Seth taste another swig, but makes a strange face. Evan grabs
the bottle and takes a swig.

Fuck. Your brother beat us to the punch.
We have to go back!
EVAN
We can't go back! She totally knew,
she'll bust us for sure, and we have to
meet Fogell.
SETH
Well, fuck...fine. Text your brother he's
a stupid piece of crap.
Evan pulls out his cell and chuckles as he types.

Evan and Seth walk off the bus. They see Fogell walking
towards them. He's in his uniform holding a hanger with a
shirt and a vest.
SETH
What the hell is that?
FOGELL
A vest.
SETH
You're gonna look like a Pinocchio.
EVAN
What? It's just a vest.
FOGELL
Yeah. How many high schoolers you see in
vests?
SETH
(eyeing Shopwell's)
You know, they got a ton of liquor right
in there. If we get it now we can get to
the party faster with all of Jules' shit.
FOGELL
No way! I work there. They know I'm not
twenty-five.
SETH
Nobody said anything about you, dick-
mouth. You have one name on your ID. It's
out of the equation!

And now I'm gonna have to take drastic
measures. I'm gonna steal the booze.
FOGELL
What?! No! Hell no! You can't do that!
EVAN
(mocking)
Yeah, right!
SETH
That's right. And that way I give Jules
back her money, like you did with Helen.
That was good thinking, that's fucking
pimp. That's how you seal a deal. It
won't be hard. Remember Dan Vertlieb
stole a keg from here and he's got, like,
really bad scoliosis!
EVAN
You're not gonna steal it. Fogell, he's
not going to steal it.
FOGELL
Please. Don't do this! I promise. I'll
get the liquor later.
SETH
I'm stepping up. And once I'm up, I don't
step back down. Maybe you "State" boys
don't understand that.
Seth walks to the store.

FOGELL
Oh, and, uh, my Mom said we can have the

three lava-lamps and one strobe light, so
like, we can have that in the room-
Evan sees Seth coming out of Shopwell's.
EVAN
Shh. Seth's coming.

Seth heads towards the bus stop.
FOGELL
Wait! I'm gonna put my vest back in my
locker!

The bus stops in front of the liquor store and the guys get

EVAN
Well, here we are. Fogell, are you ready?
SETH
Here's the list.
FOGELL
A list? Why?
SETH
We're getting girls their booze so
they'll get with us. I put a lot of
thought into that list. It's the perfect
party bar, so don't mess it up and get
Sambuca again.
Fogell reads the list. A worried look sweeps across his face.
FOGELL
Ouzo, Drambuie, Jager, Gold-shlay-ger-

FOGELL
I don't know, man. I'm getting, like,
really nervous.
Fogell starts breathing very hard and making an ODD NOISE
while doing so.
EVAN
Are you okay?
SETH
What the hell are you doing?
FOGELL
I don't know if I want to do this.
SETH
What are you talking about? You just
promised you would. What is this shit?
FOGELL
What if they turn me down?
SETH
Then we're in the same place that we're
in right now!
FOGELL
It's fucking humiliating! Everyone in the
store sees them kicking me out. What if
they make me put all the liquor back on
the shelf? I can't do that!
SETH
This whole thing is bigger than you,
asshead! Just go in there and buy the
damn alcohol!
FOGELL
What if I don't feel like it anymore?

Killing me won't get you any alcohol,
jerkoff! I'm the one with the ID!
SETH
Then I will kill you, cut off your ugly
face, put it over mine, and buy it my
fucking self.
FOGELL
You don't have the technology or the
steady hands to pull off a procedure like
that!
Seth stands for a moment, then suddenly rushes Fogell. Evan
stands between them and breaks it up.
EVAN
Seth, calm down! Fogell, stop being a
baby and go buy the alcohol! You said
you'd do it, so do it. It's why you
bought the ID, so just go do it.
FOGELL

I'll try.
Fogell walks into the store.

Seth and Evan peek through one of the store's front windows.

It's a good ID, right? Mike Snider never
had a problem. It's fine. Right?
EVAN
Calm down.

Did you remember a condom?
SETH
You brought a condom?
EVAN
Yeah, I figured, you know, might as well.
I brought one of those little things of
spermicidal lube too.

I said we'd be having sex tonight.

No. That wasn't the plan! We had a plan!
I can't believe you did that without even
consulting me about it!
EVAN
I don't really even understand what your
plan is.
SETH
I'm gonna go down on her for, like,
hours. She'll love that. She'll want to
go out with that.
EVAN
Yeah, but I figured there's no harm in
bringing just one little condom.
SETH
And one little bottle of spermicidal
lube. That's nuts. You can't let her know
you brought that! These girls are 18, not
dried up old ladies. They're ready to go.
EVAN
Fine. I won't bring the lube.
56

Seth and Evan are still leaning against the window.
EVAN
Do you think I could get Helen to do some
kind of long distance thing?
Seth looks as if he sees something in the distance. He stands
upright.
SETH
Holy Shit! It's Cary Hutchins!
EVAN
I haven't seen her since she switched
schools.
SETH
She had the biggest tits in the universe.
Down the block there is a girl walking a dog.
EVAN
I heard she had breast-reduction surgery.
Her tits must be crazy perfect now.
SETH
I gotta see these bastards. Let's check
`em out.
Seth and Evan run off towards the girl.
SETH (CONT'D)
Man, I'm gonna pretend to trip and grab
`em.

I hope they've healed.
CUT BACK TO:

Seth and Evan walk down the street towards the liquor store.
EVAN
That was a waste.
SETH
But she fully looked way better before. I
thought when they reduced them, they just
kind of reshaped them nicer. Made them
more supple.
EVAN
I can't even begin to imagine the
justification for making breasts smaller.

It's like me making my nuts saggier.

Shocked, Seth and Evan walk away from the window. Seth starts

out of jail? I don't even know where jail
is! What we need is the alcohol, which is
impossible because we don't have any
fucking money!
Seth steps into the driveway leading to the parking lot.
EVAN
Fine. Just...calm down. We need to think.
We need to think.
SETH
Fuck thinking! We need to act!
Suddenly, a car pulls out of the lot going 10 mph and knocks
Seth down!!!

The driver is pleading with Seth and Evan.
DRIVER
I'm so sorry, man! I'm so sorry! I didn't
see you at all. Are you okay? Are you
okay? I'm sorry, man. Look, what can I
do? Are you okay?
The driver glances at the cop car.
DRIVER (CONT'D)
I mean, please don't report me, we can
figure this out, okay?
SETH
Why wouldn't I report you?
DRIVER
Because I'll do anything! Please!
Anything! What can I do?
SETH
You have any money?

EVAN
(quietly to Seth)
What are you doing?
DRIVER
(beat)
Fine. Just take it.
The driver reaches into his pocket and hands Seth some money.
Seth looks at it. It's seven dollars.
SETH
What is this? This isn't enough.
Seth stuffs the money in his pocket.
DRIVER
It's all I have.
SETH
Well, you just came from the liquor
store, give us your liquor.
DRIVER
I didn't get any. They're not letting
anyone in. They're arresting someone or
something.
SETH
Well, they'll be arresting somebody else
if you don't do something quick. Ow! My
shoulder! It's killing me.
Seth, acting poorly, pretends he's way more hurt than he is.
DRIVER
No! Wait! Okay, you want alcohol?
I can
get you alcohol. I'm on my way to
this
party right now. There's gonna be
tons of
liquor. I will definitely get you
plenty.
SETH
You better.
EVAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Come here.
Seth goes over to Evan.
EVAN (CONT'D)
What are you doing?

SETH
What? Jules' money is gone, Fogell's out,
we've got no other option. Let's go.
EVAN
I don't....I don't like this idea at all.
I'm just not feeling it. That guy's
fucking creepy. Just look at him.
They look at the Driver, who is staring at Evan with a dumb
expression on his face.
DRIVER
(to Evan)
You know a guy named Jimmy, perchance?
Cause you totally look like his brother.
SETH
He's an idiot. And he's our only hope.
Come on, don't break your promise to
Helen.
63
63
The Driver's car pulls away with Seth and Evan sitting in the
back seat. A few moments later, the cops walk out with Fogell
right behind them carrying the bags of liquor.
OFFICER SLATER
(to Fogell)
Man, that lady just wouldn't stop crying,
huh? And you're the one that got punched.
Did you hear her say she has an exam
tomorrow? Boo-fuckin'-hoo. Am I right?
FOGELL
(afraid)
Heh. Good one.
OFFICER MICHEALS
Could we have taken her in? Just to scare
the shit out of her?
OFFICER SLATER
Hah. Probably could have found a way. But
a good general rule is only take people
in you want to ride with. And whiny
bitches don't make that cut.
The cops chuckle as they all get in the cop car.

The Driver's car pulls up in front of a house. The three get
out.
EVAN
Hey, are you sure that it's cool we're
here?
DRIVER
Oh, definitely. I'm essentially best
friends with this guy. A whole bunch of
my buddies are coming. Come on!
The Driver runs into the house happily, Seth and Evan
following closely behind.

The Driver get pushed out of the door and lands on the front
lawn. Seth and Evan watch from the doorway of the house, a
group of people in front of them.

Mark steps on the Driver's hand.
DRIVER (CONT'D)
Ahhhh! Fuck!
The Driver takes his hand out from under Mark's foot. He
stands up.
DRIVER (CONT'D)
Fuck you, man. I'll fucking do this!
Suddenly, Mark becomes enraged. He takes a big step forward
and brutally KICKS the Driver square in the nuts!
The Driver clutches his nuts and falls to the ground.
MARK
Francis, you and your idiot friends stay
the away from me and mine or I'll
flipping shiv your ass!
Mark and his buddies head back in, leading them towards Seth
and Evan, who quickly duck back into the party.

Evan is walking down an alley, mad as hell, when, suddenly,
he jumps up and starts squirming.
EVAN
Whaa! What the...oh..
He takes out his vibrating cell phone and looks at the
callers name...it's Helen.
EVAN (CONT'D)
Oh dude. Oh dude. Oh dude.
He looks intensely at the cell as it continues vibrating.
EVAN (CONT'D)
Okay. Okay. Here we go...
He presses talk.
HELEN (O.S.)
(through the phone with
horrible static)
Eva...lo.................
EVAN
Helen? Helen?!?
The phone cuts out. Evan sees that he has no reception. He
looks back at the party, then at his cell phone. He shakes
his head and turns back towards the party.

The cops and Fogell get out of the car and walk towards the
Bailey's. They stop before they enter.
OFFICER SLATER
Alright McLovin, this will only take a
few minutes. Just grab a beer at the bar
and we'll be done before you know it.
FOGELL
(a little scared)
Well...what's goin' on in there?
The Officers chuckle as they lead Fogell into the bar.

Evan nervously walks back into the house to look for a
telephone.

The cops and Fogell stand beside the car. The Homeless Guy is
sleeping in the back. Michaels has his gun drawn and is
carefully aiming at a distant stop sign.
OFFICER SLATER
You've been saying some bold words, my
friend. Better not mess up.
FOGELL
You can do it, officer.
BLAM!!! Michaels blasts off a round, which punches a hole
right through the center of the "O" in the stop sign.
OFFICER MICHAELS
Boo-yaka-sha!!! Suck it, Slater. Suck my
nuts. Long, but gentle.
FOGELL
Yeah! And eat his ass!
They all laugh hysterically.
FOGELL (CONT'D)
Can I shoot one?
The cops look at each other and shrug.
OFFICER SLATER
Yeah. Sure. Here. Go nuts.
Slater hands Fogell the gun, when suddenly a SIREN can be
heard in the distance getting closer.
OFFICER MICHAELS
Fuck. The cops!
OFFICER SLATER
Let's bail! Shotgun!
Slater grabs the gun out of the disappointed Fogell's hand
and holsters it. They all hop into the car.

Seth and Evan are running down the sidewalk. They both slow
to a stop to catch their breath. The party is nowhere in

SETH

You...huff...bailed on me...huff...man.

EVAN
No I didn't!
SETH
Of course you did! We were supposed to do
something and you left instead of doing
it! That's the definition of bailing!
EVAN
If you said we should burn our dicks off
and I didn't, that's not bailing!
SETH
It is bailing, if you promised to burn
your dick off!
EVAN
What?!
SETH
The bottom line is
you're a bailer. You
just bailed on me,
you bailed on me this
morning when Terry
spat on me, and you're
bailing on me next
year!
EVAN
Oh! Okay! There it is! It finally comes
out!
SETH
We were supposed to go to college
together! Since elementary school! What
ever happened to that!
EVAN
What happened to that, is that you're too
stupid to get into the schools I did!
SETH
I was not too stupid, I was too lazy!
EVAN
You've wasted all my time, you selfish
bastard!!! Instead of chasing girls and
making friends, I threw away the last
three years talking bullshit with you!
And now, because of you, I'm going to
college a fucking friendless virgin!
Seth can't believe it. He's extremely hurt.

Seth drops one of the tide bottles and shoves Evan hard. Evan
shoves him back.

We see the COP CAR going down the street. Evan and Seth are a
block down, shoving each other.
99

Seth swings at Evan with the giant detergent jug. Evan dodges
it and shoves Seth hard. Seth stumbles onto the road and gets
HIT by the COP CAR!!! Seth flies up onto the hood, SMASHING
the windshield. The car screeches to a halt and Seth slides
off the front of the car.
Seth lies motionless, still holding one of the detergent
jugs. The cap is knocked loose and beer is spilling all over
the place.
101

The cops get out of the car and walk over to a now sitting up
Seth. He's dazed, but okay.
EVAN
I'm sorry! You pushed me first.
SETH
I didn't push you into fucking oncoming
traffic!
The boys notice the cops.
OFFICER MICHAELS
Is everyone alright?
SETH
(sarcastic)
We're great.
OFFICER SLATER
Well, you should be careful boys. That's
how accidents happen.
SETH
What, when cops drive like maniacs and
hop the fucking curb?
OFFICER SLATER

Pardon?
EVAN
Nothing.

Evan looks like he's about to shit himself. The cops notice
one of the detergent jugs in the middle of a puddle of beer.
Slater dips his finger in rubs it against his gums like it
was cocaine.
OFFICER SLATER
Pabst. You boys been doing a bit of
drinking?
EVAN
No officer. Not at all.
OFFICER SLATER
(pointing to the other jug)
Is that more beer you got over there?
SETH
Umm, no sir, detergent.
OFFICER MICHAELS
Detergent?
SETH
My clothes are dirty.
The cops look at each other, then at the boys.
OFFICER MICHAELS
You boys stay right here.

The cops turn away and start to whisper to one another. Seth
and Evan look on, nervous.
OFFICER SLATER
Alright, Michaels. The car is completely
fucked, and you're the one who fucked it
up, so you've got to fix it.
OFFICER MICHAELS
What do I do?
OFFICER SLATER
We arrest these little crap stains and
dump it on them, I'll take care of that.
You go make sure McLovin is good to play

OFFICER MICHAELS
Yeah, I'm cool.
The cops nod to each other. Michaels goes back to the car and
gets in. Slater walks back over to the boys. He puts his hand
on his gun and pulls out his club, scaring the shit out of
Evan and Seth.
OFFICER SLATER
Get on the ground. Now! Spread your shit!
Evan and Seth lie down on their stomachs and spread their
arms and legs out, terrified.
EVAN
Puh...please don't shoot.
OFFICER SLATER

Puh- Puh- Please shut the fuck up!

Slater stands above the boys.
OFFICER SLATER
How tall are you?
EVAN
Uh...I don't know, five-foot-ten, eleven?
OFFICER SLATER
And you said those were "Pumas?"
Seth nods. Officer Michaels and Fogell get out of the car.
Seth and Evan see Fogell and stare in shock as he takes a
drag of a cigarette and then flicks it aside.

Evan starts to look really nervous, like he might literally
explode. He starts to stand up.
The cops are still talking when suddenly, Evan BOLTS!
OFFICER MICHAELS
Shit!
The cops run after Evan! Seth and Fogell look at each other.
Seth grabs the remaining detergent jug and runs off in the
opposite direction of Evan! Fogell reaches into the cop car,
grabs the bags of booze, and follows Seth.
FOGELL
Seth! Wait up!
Officer Slater looks back to see Seth and Fogell running.
OFFICER SLATER
Shit! Shit! McLovin bailed!
The cops run back into their car.
107

The cops get out of the car and
run off after Seth and
Fogell. As they run, we see the
Homeless Guy slump out of the
car, landing on his face with a
muffled groan. He stands up,
grabs the jug of detergent that
was left on the ground, and
runs off.
108

Fogell and an exhausted Seth are running together. Seth grabs
Fogell and takes him around a house and towards a backyard. A
second later, the cops run by the house and continue up the
block.

KIDS

Help/ It's a monster!/ Daddy!
Fogell helps Seth get up. They try to run, but Seth is caught
on the tent! He drags it a couple feet as the kids start
clawing to get out.
KIDS (CONT'D)
AAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
The zipper opens and a KID hops out. The Kid looks at Seth.
KID
AHHH!!! NO!!! DADDY!!!!
FOGELL
Holy shit! Little kids!!!
A little GIRL runs out and books it into the house. From
inside the tent, another kid starts kicking at Seth.
SETH
Ow!
Seth manages to free himself from the tent and he and Fogell
fall to the ground. The kids continue to scream.
FATHER(O.S.)
Get away from my children!
The guys turn and see a crazed, slightly overweight FATHER in
his underwear running at them with a baseball bat. Fogell and
Seth scramble to their feet as the Dad takes a swing at them,
narrowly missing them.
FATHER(CONT'D)
You sick sons-of-bitches!
Fogell throws his shoulder into the guy, knocking him down.
Seth and Fogell run to the backyard gate and try to open it.
They can't.
FOGELL
Help!
Fogell starts banging as Seth looks back to see the Dad
coming for them. Seth swings the detergent jug at the Father,
knocking him on his ass. He quickly gets up and charges,

He gets up and the keeps running.

Evan is nestled inside a large bush, frantically trying to
reverse his clothes so as to disguise himself. He keeps
looking out for the cops, when suddenly he hears a gunshot -
BLAM!!!
EVAN

Oh god. Oh god. Fuck. Fuck.

They turn onto a main street and are exuberant at the sight
of an oncoming bus. It stops at a nearby stop. They haul ass

Seth and Evan are looking at one another coldly as the bus

EVAN
I can't believe Helen's bottle broke.
FOGELL
I'm sure it'll be fine.
SETH

What's the difference? I thought you
didn't need it anyways. I thought you
were just going to tell her how you feel,
you fucking pussy.
EVAN
Yeah? Well, good luck getting Jule's
drunk enough to have sex with you.
FOGELL
What's wrong with you guys?

Evan walks out onto the back porch, looking for Helen. He

EVAN
Becca! Hey.
BECCA
Where have you been, you almost blew it.
EVAN
What?
BECCA
Helen. She's been waiting for you. She's
right over there. She's been yammering
about you all night.
EVAN
What? What did she say? Does she think
I'm a good guy? What did she say?
BECCA
It was something like, "I'll fully blow
him tonight."
EVAN
What?!?
Evan looks over and sees Helen standing on the balcony with a
big group of people. He gets really nervous.

EVAN
What? Oh man...
(so nervous)
But...she's totally hammered. If I get
with her, and I'm not drunk, isn't that,
like, date rape?
BECCA
It's not date rape if you're drunk, too.
EVAN
I guess.
Evan looks at Helen and takes a deep breath.

Evan walks out on the balcony. He spots the circle of people
Helen was standing in, only now Helen is laying on the
ground, laughing hysterically. Everyone in the circle is
looking at her and laughing as well. Evan is extremely
nervous. Helen looks up and spots him.
HELEN
(laughing)
Evan!!! Hey! Come here!!!
Evan takes a deep breath walks up to where she's laying. She
extends her arms.
HELEN (CONT'D)
Help me up! None of these people will
help me up!
Evan notices that she seems a little drunk. He helps her up
and she collapses onto him, forcing him to hold her up.
EVAN
Hey, Helen. Sorry I was-
Helen laughs hysterically as she latches onto Evan. He smells
her breath. It reeks of alcohol.
Evan's drunk, but Helen is completely fucking shit-faced!

HELEN

EVAN
I'm already pretty wasted.
But...uh...here's to you.
Evan takes a much-unwanted drink and gags.

Jules instantly pulls back.
JULES
Whoa! Whoa! Slow down.
SETH

JULES
Well, you're drunk. Like, really, really
drunk.
SETH
So? So are you.
JULES
I'm not drunk at all. I don't even drink.
Seth is absolutely shocked. It takes his remarkably drunk
mind a moment to process this information.

SETH
No! Yeah, so what if I am? I'm a fucking

JULES
Last chance to do what?

They throw Fogell into the back of the cop car.

Seth and Evan sit at the back of the empty bus together.
EVAN
Is the bang bus anything like this?
Seth cracks up laughing.

The cop car is spinning donuts in the middle of the empty
lot. It stops. Fogell and Officer Michaels get out, both
smiling. The driver side window rolls down, reveal Slater.
OFFICER SLATER
Alright, boys. What I'm about to show you
is pretty much the greatest move in donut-
spinning history. Behold: the reverse
figure-eight.
Slater drives to the other side of the lot.
FOGELL
So, like, what's your official position?
OFFICER MICHAELS
If you were in, you were in. You are no
longer a virgin, end of story. Screw
cumming.
Suddenly, Slater guns it and speeds across the lot, slamming
the breaks, spinning wildly in several erratic donuts
backward donuts.
Slater completely loses control of the car. He smashes
through a bunch of shopping carts and slams into a light
post, completely fucking up the cruiser.
Slater tries to open his door, but it won't budge. He crawls
out the missing windshield, slumping onto the ground.
OFFICER SLATER
Alright. I think that's all the fun we're
gettin' out of this one.

Slater hands Fogell his note pad.

OFFICER SLATER
...and by signing this you are officially
saying that as we stopped you from being
mugged, a crack-head stole our cruiser
and did God knows what with it.
FOGELL
Of course. That mugger had nothing but
murder in his eyes. I owe you my life.
Fogell signs the pad.
OFFICER MICHAELS
Can we do this already?
The cops and Fogell push the cruiser towards a small, but
steep, hill. They shove it over the edge and watch it roll.
It gains speed and smashes into a tree, shattering the
windows and crushing the front of the car.
OFFICER MICHAELS (CONT'D)
Can we shoot at it?
OFFICER SLATER
I don't know, can you?
They whip out their guns.
OFFICER SLATER (CONT'D)
I'm throwin' down the gauntlet. 50 bucks.
Whoever hits the gas tank.
OFFICER MICHAELS
You are so fucking on.
FOGELL
Can I get a shot?
Slater hands Fogell his gun. With a huge smile, Fogell raises
the gun, aims it at the police cruiser, and BLASTS off round
after round.

Evan wakes up and looks over at Seth, who is also waking.
They look at each other extremely awkwardly, almost as though
they drunkenly had sex with each other last night.
EVAN
Oh...uh...hey. Morning.
SETH
Uh...morning.
They stare at each other, uncomfortable.
EVAN
You sleep good?
SETH
Yeah. This is a really good pillow.
EVAN
Um...
Seth looks at his watch.
SETH
Maybe I should get going.
EVAN
You don't have to. I'm not, like, doing
anything.
Beat.

SETH
Oh...do you want to hang out? I
was...gonna go to the mall, actually.
EVAN
Oh. Cool, well, can I come? I need a
comforter. For college.
SETH
Yeah. That'd be nice. I'd really like
that.

Evan is standing in the pants section of a department store.
Seth walks out of the dressing room wearing jeans that are
way too small.
EVAN
Don't ask me. I don't give a shit if your
pants look good.
SETH
Well, I need someone's opinion.
EVAN
Fine. They're way too small.
SETH
Yeah, but when I was wearing your dad's
pants last night I realized that if I buy
pants that are too small it'll encourage
me to lose weight. And in tight pants
chicks'll kind of see my dick a little.
EVAN
Yeah, the male camel toe look is really
big this year.
Seth goes back into the dressing room and wriggles out of the
pants. He walks out.
SETH
These pants suck. Let's the get the fuck
out of here.
