  DON and CHARLIE and EDGERTON watch a

  SECURITY VIDEO -- FBI PARKING LOT

  as MEGAN gets in her car and drives out of the lot --

  -- we see a MINIVAN pull out of the shadows, across the 
  street, and follow.

  COLBY ENTERS --

                              COLBY
                Hoyle ditched Megan s phone in a 
                garbage can off Alameda -- we ve 
                got roadblocks up all across --

  Don FREEZES FRAME -- ENLARGES

  On CRYSTAL, visible behind the wheel.

                              EDGERTON
                That's her.

                              DON
                Let's see how long she waited for 
                us.

  Don REWINDS --

  So that the MINIVAN backs into its spot, in the shadows.  The 
  TIME CODE rolls back -- quickly -- until we see

  BUCK AND MEGAN AND COLBY

  Backing out of the FBI doors, into a car, which moves 
  backward out of the lot...




                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS    #302/39    "Two Daughters"   GOLDENROD REV   7-26-06   8.

  ... and we see the MINIVAN "following" it -- but in reverse.

                              COLBY
                She didn t wait -- she followed.

                              DON
                Okay, Crystal wakes up, Buck s 
                gone. 

                              EDGERTON
                They ve already killed one old 
                  boyfriend -- Pierce Brenner --

                              DON
                -- and he s out looking for Old 
                  Boyfriend Number Two -- Billy 
                Rivers --

                              COLBY
                She must ve gotten there just in 
                time to see us lock Buck up --

                              EDGERTON
                -- and followed us straight back 
                here.

                              DON
                      (pissed)
                We're looking all over the city -- 
                she's parked across the street.

                              CHARLIE
                What kind of person takes that kind 
                of risk?

                              EDGERTON
                The scariest kind; too crazy to 
                care, smart enough not to get 
                caught.


  DAVID talking to a shaken LARRY.

                              LARRY
                We had breakfast, said goodbye...

                              DAVID
                What time was that?

                Four thirty, perhaps quarter to 
                five.

                              DAVID
                Did you notice anyone else -- maybe 
                a car --

                              LARRY
                No, I... of course, I was focused 
                on Megan --
                        (self-recriminating)
                -- no, that s not true. I was 
                  preoccupied with my own narrow, 
                  self-centered agenda. In a oh-so-
                important hurry to return to my 
                   intellectual orbit  --
                      (beat)
                What the hell is wrong with me?

                              DAVID
                We re going to get her back.  As 
                much as she means to you -- she's 
                one of ours.

  Larry barely hears -- going on --

                              LARRY
                If I d given her fifteen minutes 
                more of my precious time, if I'd 
                insisted on following her home...

                              DAVID
                Larry, Megan is a decorated FBI 
                agent, a black belt in Krav Maga, 
                and one of the best shots in this 
                office.

                              LARRY
                      (angrily)
                Is that your artless way of saying 
                that I was not competent to protect 
                her?

                              DAVID
                      (calmly)
                It s my way of saying that, on the 
                right day, anyone can be gotten to -
                - even Megan.

  Curtains drawn and fluttering, minimal light seeping in...

  ... and MEGAN -- HANDCUFFED TO A STANDPIPE.  

  HER POV -- ACROSS THE ROOM --

  A small arsenal; PISTOLS, an AK-47, several HAND GRENADES.

  HER POV -- THE WINDOW

  and CRYSTAL outside, visible through the fluttering curtains, 
  TALKING ON A PAY PHONE. 

  Megan tests the handcuffs --

                              CRYSTAL (O.S.)
                Bolted to the floor.  But go ahead 
                and satisfy yourself.

  -- as CRYSTAL enters the hotel room, closes the door behind 
  her.

                              MEGAN
                  Kidnapping a federal agent --

                              CRYSTAL
                I'm wanted for murder, assault, 
                enough robberies to lose track --
                you really want to tell me how I m 
                supposed to let you go before I get 
                into big trouble?

                              MEGAN
                No... you re smart enough to know 
                what you're doing. I was about to 
                ask why.

                              CRYSTAL
                I told them I'd trade you for Buck.  
                That keeps you breathing -- until 
                8PM, at least.

                              MEGAN
                You believe they'll negotiate with 
                you?

  Crystal smiles opaquely.

                              MEGAN (CONT'D)
                No... you're not stupid -- and 
                you re not crazy either.

                              CRYSTAL
                Throwing away the life I had -- 
                there are those who would disagree.

                              MEGAN
                They don t know what it s like to 
                live a life that isn t yours. No 
                matter how good it looks from the 
                outside -- it s a cage.

                              CRYSTAL
                Read a few files, you figure you 
                  understand me.

                              MEGAN
                Maybe a little more than you think. 
                I left home at 16.

                              CRYSTAL
                How long did it take them to drag 
                you back?

                              MEGAN
                      (pause)
                I never went back home. But things 
                got a little crazy -- 
                      (beat)
                -- then there was a wakeup call. I 
                had to make some hard decisions 
                about what I wanted from the rest 
                of my life.

  Crystal smiles.  They're making a small connection.

                              CRYSTAL
                You ever miss crazy?

                              MEGAN
                Sixteen and waking up every day 
                free... no idea what the day was 
                going to be... 
                      (beat)
                Sure. All the time.

  Crystal regards Megan cautiously.

                              CRYSTAL
                Is there some reason you re telling 
                me all of this?

                              MEGAN
                The more you know about me, the 
                less likely you are to kill me.

  Crystal laughs.

                              CRYSTAL
                Gold star for honesty.

                              MEGAN
                Honesty is the one thing that might 
                keep us alive.


  DON and BUCK.

                              DON
                  Crystal s taken a hostage. 

                              BUCK
                So?

                              DON
                  A federal agent. She thinks we ll 
                trade you back.

                              BUCK
                You want your agent back? You d 
                better.

                              DON
                You re not leaving this room before 
                you tell me what I need to know.

                              DON
                But I don t.  And that should worry 
                you.

                              BUCK
                Yeah? Why?

  Don gets up, and walks around the room -- closing the blinds 
  as he talks -- unnervingly calm:

                              DON
                Because nothing matters to me 
                except getting my agent back.  I am 
                now a man who will do anything to 
                save her life.
                      (beat)
                And right now -- I have very little 
                time, and you re my only lead.

                              BUCK
                So what -- you're going to beat me 
                up?

                              DON
                I've never beaten a prisoner in my 
                life, Buck.  

  Buck watches Don carefully.  Getting nervous.

                              DON (CONT'D)
                But if you don't tell me where 
                Crystal is by the time I close this 
                last blind, I'm going to walk out 
                the door.  And then it's out of my 
                hands.

  Don looks at Buck -- a moment of poker --

                              BUCK
                I m not telling you --

  -- and Don shuts the last blind.  Buck falls silent, visibly 
  rattled...

  ... as Don walks out of the room.  Letting EDGERTON enter as 
  he does.


  DON exits the room... Colby is working outside...

                cross certain lines... it can be

  Colby s words have some impact, but Don shakes it off,  
  focuses.

                What I need to find -- is my agent.

  CHARLIE and DAVID walking and talking.

                              CHARLIE
                What we have is really a bargaining 
                game with incomplete information; 
                one player offers something the 
                second player wants, but in 
                exchange for something the second 
                player is unable to relinquish.
                      (beat)
                The trick, I think, is to alter the 
                  parameters of the game.

                              DAVID
                Like... sudden death overtime to 
                break a tie score? 

                              CHARLIE
                That s not a bad example.
                      (David pleased; but only 
                      for a second...)
                But... it s more like --

  ENTER AUDIENCE VISION --

  of a TIC-TAC-TOE GAME.  It plays out to a draw over and over 
  again, through every variation --

                              CHARLIE (CONT D)
                -- two people playing tic-tac-toe.  
                If both play rationally, and 
                neither one makes a mistake, the 
                games will always end in a draw.

                In order for one side to win, you 
                have to alter the rules of the game 
                -- allow X to make two consecutive 
                moves, or prohibit O from choosing 
                a crucial square...

  -- with the above new rules, the games go to ALL X victories.

  BACK TO SCENE

                              DAVID
                You mean cheat.

                              CHARLIE
                Well... yeah, you could put it that 
                way.
                      (beat)
                Our ability to alter the game stems 
                from the fact that Crystal Hoyle 
                wants more than one thing --

                              DAVID
                -- they were looking for Billy 
                Rivers before Buck got caught.  But 
                Rivers has been pretty successful 
                at hiding -- from her and us.

                              CHARLIE
                Well, we can apply some forward 
                  induction to that problem, as 
                well...
                      (off David)
                Rivers  criminal history contains 
                one striking commonality -- the 
                same attorney appears on 81.25% of 
                his arrest records. Explain to the 
                attorney that his client derives a 
                greater benefit from Crystal 
                Hoyle's apprehension than having to 
                hide for an indeterminate amount of 
                time.

                              DAVID 
                You really think he ll go for that?

                              CHARLIE
                Well... sure.  Even a lawyer can't 
                argue with math.

                The solution to the Trawler problem 
                is for the fast boat to assume that

                back toward us.

                Ian, she s bleeding out -- we've 
                got to get her to the hospital!

  Edgerton pausing a beat, looking

  OUTSIDE --

  at Don's car -- and the SMOLDERING WRECK of David and Colby's 
  --

                She can't afford two minutes -- and 
                we ve got one car!

  Rage and frustration on his face, Edgerton nods, helps the 
  agents get Megan up and to the car...

                                  ACT THREE


  A groggy MEGAN in hospital bed, talking to DON and COLBY and 
  DAVID.

                              MEGAN
                Pierce Brenner got Crystal 
                  pregnant. He found a lawyer sleazy 
                enough to take care of it for him --

                              DON
                -- Adam Benton. We know that 
                Brenner paid him $50,000 --

                              COLBY
                Benton was too smart to leave a 
                straight trail to a pregnant 15 year-
                old. He farmed out the dirty work to 
                one of his regular clients --

                              DAVID
                Billy Rivers. Who knows where the 
                kid ended up -- it wasn t about 
                payback after all.

                              MEGAN
                Killing Brenner was Crystal s way 
                of symbolically making room for 
                Buck to become a surrogate father.
                      (beat)
                Once her affair with Buck was 
                  discovered -- an affair that 
                  definitely has its roots in her 
                  childhood traumas -- everything 
                  triggered. She s chasing after a 16 
                  year-old s fantasy about having a 
                family. 

                              COLBY
                Well, Rivers is thoroughly lawyered 
                up... and we re gonna' have a hell 
                of a time finding a 15 year-old 
                black market baby.

                              DAVID
                We don t have enough to take Benton 
                head on, either -- judge ll never 
                give us a warrant with this little.

                Doesn t mean we shouldn t be 
                digging --

                              MEGAN
                Hey guys...
                      (beat)
                Thanks for the good timing.

                              DON
                You made your own break with that 
                gunshot.

                              MEGAN
                It seemed like the appropriate time 
                for a Hail Mary.  Lucky thing the 
                two of you were in the area --

                              COLBY
                Not so much luck as --

                              MEGAN
                -- Charlie?

                              DAVID
                He invented a new search pattern 
                today.  Said he was going to call 
                it a "Reeves Variation."

                              MEGAN
                Get kidnapped for a day, you miss a 
                lot.

                              DAVID
                I still don t see what Crystal 
                expected to get from grabbing you.  
                She knew we wouldn t release Buck --

                              MEGAN
                She feels like she failed to 
                protect one child -- maybe it was a 
                symbolic gesture toward saving 
                another one.
                      (beat)
                Or maybe, unconsciously, she just 
                wanted her story told.
                      (thinks)
                Don, she was making phone calls 
                from a payphone, outside the motel 
                room --

                              DON
                We're already on the phone dump.  
                And you need to get some rest.  NUMB3RS    #302/39    "Two Daughters"   GOLDENROD REV   7-26-06   36.




  As DON and COLBY and DAVID walk out -- CHARLIE and LARRY 
  waiting anxiously outside the room.

                              CHARLIE
                Is she --

                              DON
                -- okay.  But keep it short -- 
                she's still pretty beat.

  Charlie goes in -- Larry pauses with David --

                              LARRY
                David, earlier today -- in the 
                throes of an unprecedented sense of 
                fear, and anxiety, I said some 
                things... called you --

                              DAVID
                "Artless?"

                              LARRY
                  I apologize for -- and thoroughly 
                renounce -- the harshness of both 
                language and underlying sentiment. 

                              DAVID
                Have to admit, I thought I d been 
                called every name there was, but 
                that was a new one.

  David offers his hand -- they shake. Larry goes in to see 
  Megan --

  -- as EDGERTON approaches.

                              EDGERTON
                The Pontiac was dumped by the L.A. 
                River.  I'm going to take a run 
                out, see what there is to see.

                              DON
                      (to Colby and David)
                You guys go ahead -- I'm on the 
                cell if anything breaks.

                              DAVID
                      (to Edgerton)
                Megan's awake -- you want to stick 
                your head in first?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS    #302/39    "Two Daughters"   GOLDENROD REV   7-26-06   37.

                I'll send her a fruit basket.

  Edgerton on the move.  Don shrugs; Colby and David look at 
  each other, then follow.


  ALAN, in bathrobe, comes down the stairs to a darkened living 
  room --

  -- and DON, sitting on the sofa, watching TV.

                              DON
                Hey, Dad.  I only have maybe four 
                hours before I have to get back, 
                and my apartment is all the way 
                across town...

                              ALAN
                How's Megan doing?

                              DON
                Fine... you can visit in the 
                morning.

  Don pauses, then --

                              DON (CONT'D)
                The whole day, I wondered how far 
                I d go to get her back... 

                              ALAN
                And how far did you go?
                      (off Don s expression)
                Oh.

                              DON
                What scares me is, I d do it again 
                tomorrow.

  Alan considers, then:

                              ALAN
                Do you remember in little league -- 
                when you got beaned?

                              DON
                John Kinsella said I was crowding 
                the plate.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS    #302/39    "Two Daughters"   GOLDENROD REV   7-26-06   38.

    CONTINUED:4040


                              ALAN
                You were crowding the plate.  I 
                blamed myself for not telling you 
                to back off.
                      (beat)
                Then I took it out on your coach.  
                Told him to meet me out in the 
                parking lot.

                              DON
                I didn't know that.

                              ALAN
                You were unconscious.
                      (beat)
                My point is, if you care for 
                people, feel responsible for them, 
                it can blind your good sense. 

                              DON
                Yeah? When does good sense come 
                back?

                              ALAN
                In my case, it was around the same 
                time I remembered that Coach 
                  McGuinness was a Golden Gloves 
                boxer.
                      (beat)
                As long as you wrestle with your 
                choices, we can take it as a sign 
                that sense will return -- sooner or 
                later. 

  Don smiles thinly -- changes the subject --

                              DON 
                How's the condo hunt going?

                              ALAN
                I've got it narrowed down to two.

  Don considers, then -- 

                              DON
                You know... I hate my apartment.

                              ALAN

                courts --

                No, what I mean is...
                      (beat)
                ... you might not have noticed 
                this, but I make a lot of excuses 
                to come over here --

                              ALAN
                No.

                              DON
                The problem with frozen TV dinners 
                is, one's never enough, and two's 
                usually too many.  And I've got 
                this one extra room, I feel like I 
                should use it for something, but 
                two years later it's still filled 
                with boxes I haven't even opened...

                              ALAN
                Is this your way of suggesting that 
                I not move out?

                              DON
                All I'm saying is that you don't 
                know how great it is to come home 
                and have someone to talk to... 
                until you don't.

  Alan considers this as Don stretches out on the sofa and 
  closes his eyes.

  CHARLIE contemplates a translucent GALTON BOARD (ask Andy 
  Black).  Dropping metal balls into it... one after another... 
  they've amassed in the bottom compartments as a near-perfect 
  bell curve.

  ... as LARRY looks on.

                              LARRY
                Ah... the Galton Board.  Drop 
                enough balls through it...
                      (re: the bottom)
                ... and you have a bell curve 
                  distribution.

                              CHARLIE
                I can sit and drop balls through it 
                for hours.  Just to watch their 
                paths.


  CRYSTAL driving, eyes tearing...

  OVERLAY THE BALLS5858

  Dropping through the Galton Board, over CRYSTAL DRIVING...

                              CHARLIE
                And consider what happens when you 
                begin to block the paths...

  ... some of the paths becoming blocked, then more, steering 
  the dropping balls off to one side...

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                The distribution changes, the

  As DON S CAR and COLBY S CAR join the flashing lights and 
  myriad CHP and FBI cruisers... Getting out and getting 
  ready...

  IN THE OVERLAY --6060

  we see ALL OF THE BALLS FALL INTO A SINGLE CHANNEL --

                              CHARLIE
                ... the ball no longer has a choice 
                where to fall.

                There's no reason to end it this 
                way.

                              CRYSTAL
                Can't think of another way.
                      (beat)
                Could you tell my daughter...

  Crystal pauses, thinking:

                              MEGAN
                Tell her what?

                              CRYSTAL
                Nothing. It s like I never was.

  Crystal hangs up and opens her

  BAG --

  pulling out a HAND GRENADE, pulling the pin with her teeth 
  and clutching it in her hands.

  And then she hits the accelerator.


  As a GUNSHOT splinters the windshield -- a thick hole --

  -- and Crystal sits up quickly, then slumps forward over the 
  wheel --

  -- her foot sliding off the gas pedal...

  ... the GRENADE falling out of her hand, to the floor...


  A downbeat DON enters...

  ... to find CHARLIE sitting on the sofa, playing a VIDEO 
  GAME.

                              CHARLIE

                      (off Don s terseness)
                Bad, huh.

  Don plops down on the sofa next to him --

                One of those days I wish it ended

                physical aspect first, maybe I 
                could --
