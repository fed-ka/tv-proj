      Virginia's car drives down the road.  There are skis tied to
      the roof with rope.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      We see a wide shot of the whole family awkwardly making their
      way down the road in their ski suits and boots and carrying
      skis.*

      Jimmy is playing with Hope.  Virginia comes out on the deck. 
      She has curlers in her hair.

                                      VIRGINIA
                      Tomorrow's picture day.  You got a*
                    shower schedule?  We've only got*
                    twelve minutes of warm water.*

                                      JIMMY
                    Yeah, we're not gonna rush in the*
                    morning.  I didn't want everybody*
                    freaking out about being late so I*
                    figured we'd just get over there*
                    when we got over there.*

                                      VIRGINIA
                          (beat)
                    You know we get a dishwasher safe
                    portrait plate if we get there before
                    eight.

                                      JIMMY
                    Yeah, I know.  But since it's kind
                    of creepy seeing the whole family
                    staring at you through a plate of
                      spaghetti, I figured it didn't matter.

      Virginia stares for a long beat.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Okey, doke.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Virginia is sitting on the open tailgate of the truck.  Her
      head is in her hands.  Burt approaches cautiously.

                                    BURT
                    Hey.  You okay?

                                      VIRGINIA
                    No.

      Burt sits next to her on the tailgate.

                                    BURT
                    Jimmy's paying and then we can get
                    out of here.  I think the one picture
                    the guy took could be alright.  It's
                    not the worst one we ever had. 

      Virginia doesn't smile.  They sit for a beat.

                                    BURT (CONT'D)
                    Why does the picture have to be
                    perfect?

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Because everyone else's is.  

                                    BURT
                    Who?

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Everyone.  You don't understand. 
                    You clean people's pools, cut their
                    grass...  you're outside.  I'm
                    cleaning the inside.  And every house
                    I clean has these perfect family
                      portraits.  Everyone's happy,
                      smiling...  I just wanted one perfect
                    portrait to fool people into thinking*
                    we had whatever those other families*
                    had.  But we don't.  We're a rag tag
                    bunch of idiots who can't even fake
                    it long enough to pose for one lousy
                    picture.      

      They sit for a beat.      Raising Hope           1ARY03      "Say Cheese"27.*

                    Well, you've made me feel terrible.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      The truck goes through a red light and a traffic camera
      flashes.
