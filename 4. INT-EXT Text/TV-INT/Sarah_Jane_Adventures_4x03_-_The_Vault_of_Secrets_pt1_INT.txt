      GILL is coming through a window.  Still wary, exploring.
      On edge.

      This place doesn't look like anyone has set foot in it in
      decades.

      She continues to explore.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      GILL moves cautiously down another corridor.  From her
      jacket pocket she takes something - a small ACTIVATOR DISC,
      its covered in alien runes. 

      FX SHOT: It starts to glow, dimly.

      She's found what she's looking for.  She holds the device
      out in front of her. 

      FX SHOT: The disc glows brighter

      Suddenly a whole section of wall slides aside - revealing
      a massive VAULT DOOR.

      Gill smiles.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      A subterranean chamber somewhere in the asylum.  Dark,
      filled with alien technology - but it's dusty, covered in
      cobwebs.  No-one has set foot here in a very long time.



                                                                (CONTINUED)        SJA 4 Ep 3 PINKS 29/03/10   BBC 2010 CONFIDENTIAL page 2

      At one side of the room - three man-sized metal caskets. 
      Cables and pipes running into them.

      Suddenly a light begins to flash above each casket.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      GILL closes on the vault door - it's massive, the kind of
      thing they'd keep gold bullion in.  She strokes the door -
      almost reverential.

      Gill then takes the disc and fits it into a recess clearly
      made for it.

      It begins to revolve.  Lights begin to come on around the
      door.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      With a burst of gas the locks on the three caskets release
      and the lids open just a little.

      CLOSE on one of them - as a man's hand extends from the
      casket.  A flash of white cuff and black jacket sleeve -
      as the lid is pushed aside.  Lots of gas.

      Black shoes hit the floor.  Three pairs - making their way
      out of there.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      On GILL's face - we can see that she's ready for a big
      moment.  Something she's been waiting for.

      Anxious, she pulls on the door - won't open.

                                    GILL
                    What?!

      She tries again.  Still nothing.  She starts to lose it.

                                    GILL (CONT'D)
                    Open!  You've got to open!

      And then she sees a second recess...

      She looks at the alien disc in the door, realizing with
      horror -

                                    GILL (CONT'D)
                    Two access discs?*

      And then a noise - she turns around -


                                                                (CONTINUED)        SJA 4 Ep 3 PINKS 29/03/10   BBC 2010 CONFIDENTIAL page 3

      Three men at the end of the corridor all dressed in black
      suits, white shirts and black ties.  All with dark glasses. 
      All tall, thin, with whitish skin.  Two have dark hair,
      their leader is ash blond.

      MISTER DREAD and his MEN IN BLACK.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    Prepare to be incinerated.

      And the three raise their left hands - and remove them.

      Revealing laser blasters.

      Gill grabs the disc and runs for it!

                                                                            CUT TO:

      And we find SARAH JANE and CLYDE watching the Mars footage
      on MISTER SMITH's screen. It's a split screen, one side 
      shows the footage from NASA's PoV with numbers and text 
      etc, the other side the clean footage direct from the probe 
      to Mister Smith.

      GITA is on her feet.

                                    GITA
                    My name is Gita Chandra.  And I've
                    seen aliens.

      There's an explosion of applause from around her.  And we
      see that Gita is on her feet.  There's a horseshoe of chairs
      taken by a whole range of regular people, all ages, some a
      little stiff, some a little geeky.  But they're all
      applauding.  And Gita feels the love.  Beside her sits
      HARESH, arms crossed, barely hiding his grumpiness - can't
      believe he's here.

      The group leader is a librarian-like woman in her sixties -
      OCEAN WATERS.  She smiles broadly.

                                      OCEAN
                    Welcome to the British UFO Research
                    and Paranormal Studies Society.

      And behind Ocean we see the society's banner - the BURPSS
      acronym is unmistakable.

      the JUDOON escort ANDROVAX past.

      Gita still on her feet, Ocean and the others, listening
      keenly.

                                    GITA (CONT'D)
                    This is my husband Haresh.  We
                    both saw them.

      Haresh really doesn't want to be here.

                                      HARESH
                    Hello.

                                    GITA

      Ocean takes the offered card.  Is friendly.

                                      OCEAN*
                    I do love fresh flowers.*

                                    GITA
                    I do home deliveries. I've got a*
                    new ad in the Echo - I was checking*
                    it, when I saw your group advertised*
                    and I had to come, Miss Waters,*
                    and tell you what I'd - we'd -
                    seen.

                                      OCEAN
                    Oh, call me Ocean.  So many people
                    feel awkward - even embarrassed -
                    admitting to a close encounter. 
                    But we at BURPSS believe you should
                    let it all out.

      And Haresh has to stifle a burst of laughter.  Gita notices,
      elbows.

                                    GITA
                    Oh, I feel so much better for it.

                    Ealing is the centre of so much

      HARESH turns off the ignition.  He and GITA are in the

                    Gita, they're called BURPSS. 
                    They're a bunch of windbags.

                                    GITA
                    Why do you refuse to believe what
                    you've seen with your own eyes?

                                      HARESH
                    I'm not denying aliens exist.  
                    But whatever they were doing here,
                    it was a one-off.  You're not going
                    to see them again.

      As Haresh turns to get out of the car - and Gita turns to
      see stealthy ANDROVAX across the road.

      She screams.

      Androvax runs out of sight into Sarah Jane's garden - as

                    Mister Smith, I need you.  Now!

      MISTER SMITH emerges with grinding brickwork, steam and
      fanfare.  And if he could do a double-take he would.

                                      MISTER SMITH
                    Aaaah, Rani.  I sense that you are
                    not quite yourself today.

                                    RANI
                    You're just as annoying as you
                    were last time I was here.

      As SARAH JANE and CLYDE burst in.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    And I hoped we'd seen the last of
                    you then.

                                    RANI
                    I don't mean you harm.

                    What?!  And that's why you jumped
                    inside Rani, is it?  Get out of

                    I didn't expect a warm welcome.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    You were right!  Whatever you want,
                      I remember exactly what it's like
                    having you under my skin.  Now,

                    I'm going to salvage what's left
                    of my Saturday at badminton.  Are
                    you coming, or sticking to space
                    shuttles instead of shuttlecocks?

                                    GITA

                    Maybe the answer is through here.

      They've come to a door.  She opens it - a flight of steps

                    We could do with some light down

                    If you ask me the other side of a

                    Uh-oh I think we just found where

                    and Baby Bear.

      And we see the caskets in the room.  They investigate -*

                                      SARAH JANE
                    The question is - where are their*

                                      CLYDE

                    Or maybe something woke them up. 

      Rani is examining some of the equipment.

                    I'm sure this is a transmat device. 
                    But there's no power to it.  It's
                    been shut down.  And has been for
                    a long time.

      Meanwhile Clyde has found something else -

                                      CLYDE
                    Somebody needs to get a scrapbook.

      It's a wall covered in newspaper clippings.  All very old
      and yellowing.  All of them with headlines about Flying
      Saucer sightings, or people being abducted by aliens.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Some of these go back to the
                      nineteen-fifties.

                                    RANI
                    Why do aliens keep newspaper
                    clippings about UFO sightings?

                                      CLYDE
                    ETs with big egos?

      But one clipping has caught Sarah Jane's attention - a
      picture of a woman in her 20s.  Under the headline SPACEMEN
      KIDNAPPED ME.  It's a much younger Ocean Waters.  Sarah
      Jane takes it from the wall.

                        Nineteen-seventy-two.  That's Ocean
                    Waters from BURPSS.

                                    RANI
                    Mum's friend?  She was abducted by
                    aliens?

      Sarah Jane is a little saddened.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    That must be why she started BURPSS. 
                    If only she'd had a better name
                    for it, people might have taken
                    her more seriously.

                                      CLYDE
                    But what does this have to do with
                    Androvax and an alien vault?

      Sarah Jane puts the newspaper clipping in her pocket.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    I don't know.  But we need to find
                    that vault.  Come on.

                    You know, I'm thinking - is this a

                    race of body-popping aliens is
                    something the universe really needs?

                    Androvax did some terrible things. 
                    But that doesn't mean his entire
                    species is better off extinct.
                    Earth has had its fair share of

                    But all I'm interested in is the
                    activator disc.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Well, unlike you I prefer to know
                    who I'm dealing with.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    My name is Dread.  Mister Dread.

                                    RANI
                    Well, you don't look like any bundle
                    of laughs.  That's for sure.



                                                                (CONTINUED)SJA 4 Ep 3 Shooting Script 22/03/10   BBC 2010 CONFIDENTIAL page 24

      Mister Dread removes the scanning device from his pocket -
      notes its readings -

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    The Veil is not among you.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    The Veil, Androvax, says this could
                    save his species.  That the last
                    of them were in stasis aboard a
                    ship that crashed here.  That they
                    are held here in a hyper-dimensional
                    vault.  Would you know anything
                    about that, Mister Dread?

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    These are off-world matters.  Humans
                    are irrelevant.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Earth is my planet and, believe
                    me, that makes me very relevant. 
                    And if you have the second vault
                    activator disc you have the survival
                    of an entire species in your hands. 
                    Whoever you are, I won't let you
                    ignore that.  Where is the other
                    disc?

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    We do not have it.  It's security
                    is assured.  One alone is useless. 
                    Give me the activator disc and
                    bring me the Veil.  Or prepare to
                    be incinerated.

      As one, Mister Dread and the Men in Black remove their
      left hands - revealing their blasters.

                                      CLYDE
                    That's handy.

                                    RANI
                    They're androids.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Run!

      Sarah Jane, Rani and Clyde make a run for it.

      FX SHOT: Mister Dread and the Men in black fire.

      Sarah Jane and the kids hide around a corner.  She takes
      out the sonic and smiles.

                                      SARAH JANE (CONT'D)
                    If they're androids, I've got just
                    the shade to slow them down.



                                                                (CONTINUED)SJA 4 Ep 3 Shooting Script 22/03/10   BBC 2010 CONFIDENTIAL page 25

      And Sarah Jane jumps into the corridor - sonic at the ready
      as MISTER DREAD and the MEN IN BLACK head towards her.

      Sarah Jane zaps with the sonic.

      FX SHOT: Electricity seems to arc around Mister Dread and
      the Men in Black - like a suddenly visible force field.

      The sonic doesn't touch them.

      Sarah Jane is horrified.

      FX SHOT: Mister Dread fires.

      Sarah Jane just gets out of the way in time.

                                      SARAH JANE (CONT'D)
                    It doesn't work!  Run! 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      SARAH JANE, CLYDE and RANI burst back in.  MISTER SMITH is
      out - keeping watch over ANDROVAX, still held in the
      containment vortex.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    We just met your friend, Mister
                    Dread.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    The man in black?

                                      CLYDE
                    Yeah.  He's an android with a laser
                    blaster up his sleeve.  Thanks for
                      mentioning that.

                                      MISTER SMITH
                    Androids dressed in black?  They
                    were instruments of the Alliance
                    of Shades.

                                    RANI
                    Which is what?

                                      MISTER SMITH
                    An alien initiative to inhibit
                    human awareness of extra-
                      terrestrial life.  The Men in Black
                    operated in the period of 1953 to
                    1972,  when the Alliance was
                      disbanded.  During this time they
                    reputedly wiped the memories of
                    people who encountered aliens and
                      engineered the disposal of off-
                    world debris.

                                      SARAH JANE
                      Apparently into a hyper-dimensional
                    vault.  Which the Men in Black are
                    still guarding.

                                      CLYDE
                          (to Androvax)
                    You woke them up when you tried to
                    bust into it.  Thanks, mate.

                                    RANI
                      Seventy-two?  That's when Ocean
                    Waters was abducted.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    We need to find out everything we
                    can about Mister Dread.  We should
                    talk to Miss Waters.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    If Dread wiped her memory you will
                    learn nothing.  But if I come with
                    you...

                                      SARAH JANE
                    No, Androvax.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    My species is at stake.  If I take
                    her body I will find her memories
                    of the Men in Black.   She will be
                    unharmed.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    I can't ask anyone to let you take
                    them over.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    It will be her choice.

                    I know what I'd say.  Anyway, I'd
                    freak the minute I saw him.

      Sarah Jane makes a big decision.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Mister Smith, deactivate the
                      containment vortex.

                    What are you doing?

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Androvax will have to travel there
                    in me.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    Old friends reunited.

      Sarah Jane steels herself, as Androvax reaches towards her -
      but Clyde grabs her, draws her aside.

                                      CLYDE
                    No.  If something goes wrong with
                    this, we need you.  Take me,
                    Androvax.  Do it now!

      FX SHOT: Clyde closes his eyes tight as Androvax takes
      him.

      Clyde justs stands there.  Unmoving.  Eyes closed.

                                    RANI
                    Clyde?

      Clyde opens his eyes.

      FX SHOT: Androvax's tongue snaps out.

      MISTER DREAD stands before the wall of newspaper cuttings. 
      He has seen the missing clipping.  Touching the empty space.

      by OCEAN - MINTY is at the table with his alien detector
      in bits, working on it.

                    Well, this is a surprise, Miss
                    Smith.  I'm afraid our alien hunt
                    was something of a lost cause.

                                      MINTY
                    A minor malfunction.  Don't really
                      understand it.  The bi-conductor
                    is working.

      He touches something in there.  Cries out with pain as he
      gets a small electric shock.

                                      MINTY (CONT'D)
                    Yes.  That's working all right.

      Rani and Sarah Jane try to hide their amusement.  Clyde
      just stares.  Unnatural.

      Minty gets back to work on his contraption as -

                                      SARAH JANE
                    My visit is more of a professional
                    nature.  I'm a journalist.  Given
                    your "expertise" in the field of
                    ufology, I wondered what you could
                    tell me about Men in Black?  For
                    instance, have you ever met someone
                    called Mister Dread?

      Ocean can't hide her shock.

                                      OCEAN
                    Where did you hear that name?

                                    RANI
                    Coming out of his face.

      And suddenly Ocean is over-joyed -

                                      OCEAN
                    You've seen him?  I - I don't
                    believe it!  This - this is -

      She can barely get the words out for her excitement.  She
      grabs Minty, hugs him so tight he might pop.

                                      OCEAN (CONT'D)
                    This is amazing!  You've seen him!

      Then...

                    But - but he must be so old now.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    He's surprisingly sprightly.  But
                    Ocean, I need you to tell me what
                    you know about him... And why you're
                    so pleased.

                    Because it proves he exists!  That
                    I'm not mad!  No-one would ever
                    believe me.  About the abduction,
                    or about them - the Men in Black. 
                    It's been almost forty years.  How
                    many times do you think I've even
                    asked myself if I was mad?

                                    RANI
                    But you remember them?

      Ocean is anguished.

                                      OCEAN
                    Not the details.  Nothing you could
                    call evidence.  That's what they
                    do to you.  Every time I've tried
                    to remember - my head, it's just
                    filled with this bright green glow. 
                    But I remember him.  Mister Dread. 
                    Nothing could wipe out that face.

      Ocean looks somehow lost...

                    That's why she founded BURPSS -
                    it's been her life.  Trying to
                    find some way of proving what
                    happened to her.  That aliens exist.

      And a light starts to pulse under Ocean's top.

                                    RANI
                    Sarah Jane, look!

      And Sarah Jane takes the activator from her pocket - it
      too pulses with PRAC light.  Ocean stares in disbelief.

                                      OCEAN
                    Oh... my...

      Ocean removes a chain from around her neck - another alien
      disc.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    I don't think Mister Dread just
                    wiped your memory, Ocean - I think
                    he left something with you for
                      safe-keeping in 1972.

      Ocean looks at it, tears in her eyes.

                                      OCEAN
                    Something has always told me this
                    was special.  I had no idea where
                    it came from.  When I bought it,
                    or found it.  It's just always
