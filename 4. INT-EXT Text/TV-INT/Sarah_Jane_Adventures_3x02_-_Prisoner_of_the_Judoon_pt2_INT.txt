      LUKE, CLYDE, RANI before MR SMITH.  TYBO in the background.

                      Detonation in fifty five seconds. 
                    You must run!  Now!

                                    RANI
                    Mr Smith, stop it!

                                    MR SMITH
                    I cannot cancel Sarah Jane's order.

                                      CLYDE
                    But Sarah Jane didn't order you to*
                    explode.  It was some freaky alien
                    inside her!

                                    MR SMITH
                      Detonation in forty seconds.  
                    Only she can command me to disarm.

      Tybo steps forward with his raised gun.

      Luke pushes the gun aside, angrily.

 
                                    LUKE
                    No!  We need Mr Smith to find mum!

                                      TYBO*
                    Then do something.  Now.*

                                    MR SMITH
                    You have thirty four seconds.

      More hydraulic steam bursts from Mr Smith, his screen goes
      crazy with graphics.  The bang is getting close...

                                    RANI
                    Come on, Luke.  You can do this.

                                    LUKE
                    I'm trying to think...

                                      CLYDE
                    You haven't got time to think.   
                    You're a genius.  What would
                    Einstein do?

                                    RANI
                    He never had an alien computer in
                    his attic that turned into a bomb.

                    Twenty two seconds.  Please.  Run. 

      Luke suddenly gets it -

                                    LUKE
                    Mr Smith, you're a Xylok and what
                    is most important to a Xylok?

                                    MR SMITH
                    Purpose.

                                      CLYDE
                    I was expecting wire cutters here, 
                    not chit-chat.

                                    LUKE
                    And what is your Purpose?  What
                    did Mum tell you was your Purpose?

                                    MR SMITH
                    To defend and protect Earth.

                                    LUKE
                    And that Purpose over-rides all
                    other protocols.

                                    LUKE
                    Mum's orders endanger Earth.  Your
                    Purpose over-rides her command. 
                    You have to stop the detonation.

                                    MR SMITH
                    Your point seems logical.  I must
                      consider...

                                    RANI
                    No!  Just do it!

      SARAH JANE is covering YORKE with the sonic.*

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Now, Mr Yorke, input the nanoform
                      activation codes.  I don't have
                    much time.

                                      YORKE
                    You're mad!  You said yourself the
                    nanoforms can't do more than push
                    a few atoms together!

      Sarah Jane inserts a flashdrive into one of the computer*
      terminals. Strange alien symbols flood across the monitor
      screens.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    I think you'll find they've just
                    been upgraded.  Now enter the codes!

      She pushes Yorke into a seat at a computer with surprising
      strength.  Yorke does as he's told.

      LUKE, CLYDE, RANI and TYBO are before MR SMITH - who has
      diagrams of a classic Roswell UFO on his screen.

                                    MR SMITH
                    In 1947 a spacecraft crash-landed
                    in New Mexico -

                                    RANI
                    You're talking about Roswell.

      Clyde throws her a look...

                                      CLYDE
                    You mean that really happened?

                    Come on.  Try to keep up.

                    The US military re-engineered a
                    craft from the wreckage.  Sarah
                    Jane had me acquire the schematics
                    from the computer system at their 
                    Dreamland base in Nevada.

                                    LUKE
                    And she's taken them to Genetec. 
                    Of course.  Nanoform technology
                    could build it from raw atoms.

                    What are you talking about?*

                                      LUKE*
                    Mum was doing an article about*
                    nanoforms - tiny robots who can*
                    build anything.  Androvax is going*
                    to get them to build him a spaceship

                                      CLYDE
                    Before the Judoon get here in thirty
                    minutes?  Don't those things take
                    tea breaks?

                                    LUKE
                    Nanoforms have to be stored dormant

                                    TYBO
                    Must hurry.  Stop Androvax escaping.

                                    MR SMITH
                    Sarah Jane - or Androvax - knew
                    you would follow.  So my self-
                    destruct protocols were engaged.

                                      CLYDE
                    Yeah.  Well Androvax isn't going
                    to leg it with Sarah Jane.  We're
                    going to stop him, and before
                    Captain Tybo's space-plods get
                    here.
                          (to Tybo)
                    No offence.

                                    MR SMITH
                    The matter is more pressing than
                    that, Clyde.

                                                                            CUT TO:        THE SARAH JANE ADVENTURES 3 Ep 2 PINKS 17/04/09 page 4A.




      Computer screens across the lab are lighting up with streams
      of alien text.  YORKE, still at the computer, looks about 
      him, shocked.  SARAH JANE regards with a big smile.

      lab taking it in.  In one corner of the lab there is a
      large glass walled chamber with a heavy, wheel-lock door
      bearing warning logos - NO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS.

      Tybo's communicator beeps.He gets it.

                    I'm no maths genius.  But that
                    means trouble just got squared to

                    If Androvax has still got Sarah
                    Jane the Judoon will take them
                    both!

      Luke's eye is on the chamber.

                                    LUKE
                    We have to slow them down.  And I
                    think I know how.

      And he pulls open the chamber door, as Tybo finishes his
      communication.  Clyde gets it.  Bounds into the chamber. 
      Pretends to find something.

                                      CLYDE
                    Captain Tybo.  Look at this.

      Tybo follows Clyde into the chamber.

                                    TYBO
                    What?

      Luke and Rani shove Tybo hard from behind.

      Clyde leaps back out of the chamber.  They slam the heavy
              SJA 3 Ep 2 PINKS
      door shut on him.

                                      CLYDE

                    You're nicked, mate.

      Tybo turns, enraged.  Tries to fire his gun at the door
 
      but nothing happens.  The kids watch through the glass
      wall.

                                    LUKE
                    It's an electro-dampening chamber. 
                    Nothing electronic will work in
                    there.  Not Tybo's gun or his radio. 
                    Now the Judoon will have to find
                    him as well as mum.

      Within the sound-proofed chamber, angry Tybo is hammering
      on the glass wall.

                                    RANI
                    But, boy, are we in trouble when
                    he gets out of there.

      Clyde gives Tybo a salute as they rush out of there.

                                                                            CUT TO:      THE SARAH JANE ADVENTURES 3 Ep 2 PINKS 17/04/09 page 15A.

      Smiling.  Menacing.  She opens her arms wide, a parody of

                                      INNER SARAH JANE
                    Oh, I don't think so!

      Sarah Jane glowers at the screen.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    You can't stop me!

      And suddenly CLYDE and RANI are on the flight deck.

                                      CLYDE
                    We can have a pretty good try!

                    How did you get in here?

                                    RANI
                    Someone left the door open.

                                    LUKE
                    Mr Smith showed me the ship's
                      schematics.  I know everything
                    about it.  Where the door controls
                    are.  And that you can't take it
                    anywhere without this.

      From behind his back he produces a short bar of (PRAC)
      glowing material.

                    You can have it, Androvax.  But
                    you have to come and get it.  Not
                    my mum.

              SJA 3 Ep 2 PINKS
      Sarah Jane stares at him, frightened and out-manoeuvred.

      On the monitor screen she can see Tybo and the Judoon

                    Release my mum and you can take
                    off.  After you've disabled the

                    No wonder Sarah Jane is so proud
                    of you, it makes me want to be
                    sick.

      FX SHOT: Sarah Jane shimmers, and ANDROVAX steps out of
      her. 

      Sarah Jane drops to the floor.*

      Clyde and Rani go to her...

      As Androvax approaches Luke for the ionic fusion bar.

      Two Judoon guards slip either side of Androvax, guns on

      Another, stronger tremor.

                    No.  First you have to let him
                    disable the nanoforms.

      Another tremor - it's getting worse.

      The whole place is shaking now.

                    You're wrong, Androvax.  There may
                    be destruction in the universe,
                    there has been for billions of
                    years.  Without it the universe
                    wouldn't evolve. And that's what
                    the universe is really about. 
                    Survival!  Just watch!

      And Luke launches himself at the spacecraft's computer. 
      It's weird.  Unlike any earth computer - but Luke knows
      his way around it, because he's seen the schematics.

      Clyde joins him.

                    I know this is a stupid question,

                    do you know what you're doing?

      Luke doesn't look up from the computer as he works.

                                    LUKE
                    The nanoforms built this computer,
