FOREST - DAY
Germania.
The far reaches of the Roman Empire.
Winter 180 A.D.
Incongruously enough, the first sound we hear is a
beautiful tenor voice.
Singing.
A boy's voice.
CREDITS as we hear the haunting song float through dense
forests.
We finally come to a rough, muddy road slashing
through the forest.
On the road a GERMAN PEASANT FATHER
is herding along three sickly looking cows.
His two SONS
are with him.
His youngest son sits on one of the cows
and sings a soft, plaintive song.
They become aware of another sound behind them on the road
-- the creak of wood, the slap of metal on leather.
The
Father immediately leads his cattle and his sons off the
road.
They stand-still, eyes down:
the familiar posture
of subjugated peoples throughout history.
A wagon train rumbles past them.
Three ornate wagons
followed by a mounted cohort of fifty heavily-armed
PRAETORIAN GUARDS.
The young boy dares to glance up at the passing Romans.
His eyes burn with hatred.
WAGON - OUTPOST - DAY
Three Roman SOLDIERS guard an outpost, a watchtower, on
the roadside.
COMMODUS
Why have we stopped?
PRAETORIAN GUARD MEMBER
We're here, sir.
COMMODUS
(to Soldier #1)
Where is my father?
SOLDIER #1
He's at the front, sir.
COMMODUS
Is the battle won?
SOLDIER #1
Don't know, sir.
They've been gone
for eight days.
Commodus tosses off his furs -- beneath them he wears a
beautiful set of Lorica Segmentata -- the traditional
formed armor of Rome.
He moves to a horse as:
COMMODUS
(to Soldier #1)
My sister wants a bath, take her to
the camp.
(to Soldier #2)
Take me to my father.
He leaps onto the horse and canters back to the Praetorian
Guard unit.
Soldier #2 climbs on his horse and leads them.
Commodus
rides off with most of the Praetorian Guard unit.
Lucilla peeks her head from the wagon.
She glances at the
remaining soldiers.
Distinctly unpromising.
LUCILLA
(dry)
Civilization at last.
Gods preserve
us.
HILL - TWILIGHT
The mighty catapults dwarf the humans.
Soldiers from the
elite Felix Regiment -- a legion of the Roman Army -- haul
the monstrous machines up a hill.
The commanding General of the Felix Regiment, MAXIMUS,
walks between two of the catapults.
He is a striking and
intense man in his 30's.
Like all the soldiers who
surround him, he is caked with mud and exhausted.
He trudges up the hill with his two lieutenants, TITUS and
QUINTUS.
TITUS
You would do as well to read the
mind of a rhinoceros.
QUINTUS
These barbarians would rather drown
in blood than yield an inch.
If I
didn't hate them so much I would
admire them.
They have reached the top of the hill.
Stunning martial
preparations are underway.
The catapults join ten others.
Archers are taking up position.
Brutal "Scorpions" --
devices for firing multiple crossbow bolts -- are being
loaded.
Soldiers are also loading the catapults with
enormous "Greek fire pots" -- large, round terra cotta
pots.
Maximus and his lieutenants gaze down from the hilltop.
Below them they can see a German encampment.
TITUS
They simply will not surrender.
A beat as Maximus gazes down at the German position.
MAXIMUS
(quietly)
A people should know when they are
conquered.
A beat.
MAXIMUS
At the first signal release the
catapults.
We'll use the cavalry to
cut off the retreat.
QUINTUS
General, I don't recommend that.
Our cavalry might be caught in the
flames.
MAXIMUS
I hope not, because I'm going to be
leading them.
A beat as he gazes down at the enemy.
MAXIMUS
Why don't they know they're already
dead?
TREES - TWILIGHT
Maximus and Titus are on their horses, the cavalry of two
hundred Felix Regiment warriors surrounds them.
Steam
flares from their horses' nostrils.
They wait in a thick
stand of trees -- the German position can be seen across a
muddy plain.
A large wolf -- "The Wolf of Rome" -- waits at Maximus'
side.
Maximus nods to an archer.
The archer lights the tip of
an arrow and sends it flaming into the night sky.
HILLTOP - TWILIGHT
Quintus waits.
The catapults are loaded and waiting.
So
too the Scorpions.
So too the 200 archers of the Felix
Regiment.
He sees the flaming arrow flying up from below.
QUINTUS
Now!
The mighty catapults are released.
The Greek fire pots
arc dramatically through the air.
A moment later soldiers
release the Scorpions and hundreds of bolts streak through
the sky.
The archers fire a murderous barrage of flaming
arrows.
TREES - TWILIGHT
The screaming is almost immediate.
Maximus and his cavalry watch as the fire pots crash down
into the German encampment.
GERMAN CAMP - TWILIGHT
The fire pots shatter -- pitch splashes everywhere --
seconds later the bolts and flaming arrows slice down and
ignite the pitch -- FLAME EXPLODES -- it is a hellish,
napalm-like vision -- the conflagration illuminating the
twilight.
The deadly rain of flaming arrows spreads terror through
the German camp --
TREES - TWILIGHT
Maximus watches the German camp.
MAXIMUS
(to his men)
Hold steady... steady...
He can see the nightmare destruction of the encampment
continuing -- fire pots and Scorpion bolts and flaming
arrows -- panic in the German encampment.
MAXIMUS
Steady...
He sees the Germans begin fleeing across the plain.
He
quickly raises his sword and whispers a prayer, then turns
to his men:
MAXIMUS
Brothers -- I salute you!
For Rome!
He spurs his horse and races out of the trees to the
plain...
PLAIN - BATTLEGROUND - TWILIGHT
Maximus leads the terrifying and relentless cavalry charge
-- Titus at his side -- the Felix Regiment screams out
fearsome war cries as they gallop across the muddy plain
toward the Germans --
Fire pots and flaming arrows are crashing down everywhere
around them --
The cavalry SLAMS into the Germans at full gallop --
It is carnage.
The Felix Regiment warriors slash ruthlessly with short
swords -- slicing a path of sheer destruction through the
Germans -- but the Germans fight with equal brutality --
and the Germans also fight with the desperation of a
hopeless last chance -- they pull and spear Roman soldiers
off horses whenever they can --
Maximus spins his horse and swings his sword with expert
efficiency -- a spear stabs through the neck of his horse
and it immediately collapses forward --
Maximus sails over the horse's head and crashes to the
muddy ground -- he jumps up and is in the midst of the
battle --
The flaming arrows and exploding fire pots create a
ferocious inferno everywhere around the battle -- the
flames silhouetting the fighting --
On the ground, Maximus proves his absolute worth as a
warrior -- he hacks and dodges -- ghastly images of true
ancient warfare -- Maximus' eyes burn with a zealous fire
as he fights for his life --
He finds he is momentarily at a terrible disadvantage --
Germans are surrounding him from all sides -- as he fights
he looks for an advantage -- for his soldiers -- for
anything -- he is doomed --
Then -- an almost mystical image -- Maximus' wolf leaps
through a wall of flame --
"The Wolf of Rome" savages several Germans around Maximus
-- giving him the help he needed.
The wolf and his master fight, side-by-side.
HILLTOP - TWILIGHT
We see an old man's face, staring down at the battle.
The
face is weather-beaten, ailing.
The roaring flames from
the battlefield below flicker in his sad eyes.
MARCUS AURELIUS, the Emperor of Rome, is on a horse.
A
metal brace extends from the back of his saddle.
He is
strapped to the brace with thick, leather straps.
He watches as the Felix Regiment below concludes the
battle.
The cheering of the Regiment can be heard as the
final, isolated pockets of Germans are cut down.
Behind Marcus the sun is setting, painting the world blood
red.
BATTLEFIELD - SUNSET
Maximus, bloody and spent, walks through the aftermath of
the carnage.
The Wolf of Rome is at his side.
Dead and
dying by the hundreds are scattered everywhere.
Roman
surgeons are attending to the wounded.
Marcus walks to him, embraces him warmly.
MAXIMUS
Caesar.
MARCUS
Maximus, you prove your valor again.
Let us hope for the final time here.
MAXIMUS
I don't think there's anyone left to
fight.
MARCUS
There are always people left to
fight...
Marcus takes Maximus' arm and they walk through the masses
of bodies.
Maximus holds Marcus' arm firmly, quietly
supporting him as they walk.
MARCUS
But this night, at least, Germania
is at last defeated... What will you
do now, my friend?
MAXIMUS
Should Caesar permit, I'll go home.
I've been away too long.
I've
forgotten my wife's face and I
barely know my son.
Suddenly, a tethered GERMAN PRISONER they are passing
calls out to them:
GERMAN PRISONER
THIS BLOOD MEANS NOTHING, CONQUEROR!
Maximus and Marcus stop.
A soldier moves quickly to
silence the German Prisoner.
MARCUS
(to Soldier)
Stop...
(to Prisoner)
... You speak our language?
GERMAN PRISONER
You have been in my homeland for
twelve years.
Of course I speak
your language.
So did my son, who
you murdered.
So did my daughter,
who you raped.
MAXIMUS
(to Marcus)
Come, Caesar...
MARCUS
No.
Let him speak...
(to Prisoner)
... I am Rome, what would you say to
me?
GERMAN PRISONER
(points to sunset)
You are that sun, Rome, and your
time is over... You can slit a
thousand throats here, and you can
put a thousand babies to the sword,
but it will always be our home.
MARCUS
Now it is Rome.
GERMAN PRISONER
It will never be Rome.
Not as long
as one German breathes.
The soldier moves to kill the insolent Prisoner.
MARCUS
No... Release him.
Give him safe
passage.
Let him go to his family.
The soldier leads the German Prisoner away.
Maximus and Marcus continue walking in silence for a beat.
Then:
MARCUS
Tell me again, Maximus, why are we
here?
MAXIMUS
For the glory of the empire, sire.
MARCUS
(quietly)
Yes.
I remember.
They continue walking through the mountains of bodies...
ROAD - SUNSET
Maximus and Marcus are now walking along a road through
the dense forest.
Slaves follow behind them, leading
their horses.
Both sides of the road are filled with the men of the
Felix Regiment.
As Maximus and Marcus pass, the battered
and bloody soldiers drag themselves to their feet, raising
their swords, paying silent homage.
MAXIMUS
They honor you, Caesar.
MARCUS
I don't think they're standing for
me, Maximus.
They honor you.
Just then Commodus canters into view with his Praetorian
Guard escort.
He watches the army honor Maximus with rank
envy as he nears.
He rides up to Maximus and Marcus.
COMMODUS
Have I missed it?
He leaps from his horse.
COMMODUS
Have I missed the battle?
MARCUS
You've missed the war.
We're done
here.
Commodus embraces him, awkward.
COMMODUS
Father.
Congratulations.
I shall
sacrifice a thousand doves to honor
your triumph.
MARCUS
Spare the doves and honor Maximus,
he won the battle.
Commodus embraces Maximus, even more awkward.
COMMODUS
General, Rome salutes you and I
embrace you as a brother.
MAXIMUS
Highness.
They walk, Maximus still supporting Marcus, as:
COMMODUS
Your Spaniards seem invincible.
May
the Gods favor the Felix Regiment
now and always...
(to his father)
Here, Father, take my arm.
MARCUS
(ignores this)
Where's your sister?
COMMODUS
She's at the camp.
She had no
desire to see the gore of the
battlefield.
MARCUS
(smiles)
Lucilla would eat every corpse here
if it brought her one step closer to
the throne.
Maximus laughs.
MAXIMUS
(smiles)
Caesar, you do the lady injustice.
MARCUS
It's a foolish old cobra who doesn't
recognize his own off-spring...
(he suddenly stops,
not feeling well)
I think... I should ride now.
Maximus waves for Marcus' horse.
It is brought up.
Several soldiers carefully help the old man into the
saddle.
He is then tethered to the brace on his saddle.
It is a slow, graceful and embarrassing ordeal for the
Emperor of Rome.
When at last he is strapped in, he looks to Maximus.
MARCUS
So much for the glory of Rome.
Without a word to his son, Marcus nods and the horse is
slowly lead away.
Commodus and Maximus watch him go.
COMMODUS
(neutral)
He's dying.
A beat.
COMMODUS
Poor old man.
MAXIMUS
(terse)
If you'll excuse me, Highness.
He turns and stalks away.
TENT CITY - NIGHT
We see the Roman encampment, a sea of tents.
Hundreds of
campfires burn before the tents.
TENT CITY - DAWN
Maximus is slogging through the mud and snow that blankets
the Rome camp.
He stops to observe an unusual sight.
Commodus is stripped almost naked, his chiseled body
covered in a fine sheen of sweat.
He and his six
CENTURION BODY GUARDS are going through their daily
ritual.
They defy the sub-zero temperatures and hack at
small trees with swords.
It is an eerie, zen-like workout.
Commodus' intense
concentration is unnerving.
Maximus watches for a moment then moves on.
He approaches
a large network of tents.
He enters.
TENT CITY - NIGHT
Dead of night.
Maximus and Quintus stride quickly through
the sleeping camp toward Marcus' tent.
MAXIMUS
What is it?
Is he ill?
QUINTUS
I don't know...
They continue on toward Marcus' tent.
MAXIMUS' TENT - TENT CITY - NIGHT
Five horses are waiting.
MAXIMUS
Quintus, what -- ?
QUINTUS
(anguish)
I have no choice --
They are almost run over by a stern cohort of twenty
Praetorians who gallop past.
Maximus knows immediately
what this means.
MAXIMUS
(suddenly)
My family?!
A beat.
MAXIMUS
What about my family, Quintus?
QUINTUS
(quietly)
They will greet you in the
afterlife.
Maximus lunges at him -- the Praetorians subdue him --
slamming him with a sword hilt -- knocking him
unconscious.
QUINTUS
(quietly, to
assassins)
Take him as far as the sunrise and
then kill him.
FOREST ROAD - DAWN
The four Praetorian assassins lead Maximus along a road.
He sits slumped in his saddle, drained.
ASSASSIN #1
All right, this is far enough.
The three other assassins climb from their horses.
Assassin #2 pushes Maximus from his horse.
He falls to
the ground hard.
ASSASSIN #1
You two take him down there where no
one will find him.
ASSASSIN #3
Come on, General...
Assassin #3 and Assassin #4 drag Maximus down a densely
forested hill along the road.
Maximus' hands are still
bound in front of him.
He seems totally lacking in any
resistance.
FOREST - BELOW THE ROAD - DAWN
Maximus eyes the two assassins as they troop down the
hill away from the road, he notes their sparkling armor.
The armor of men who have never seen real battle.
MAXIMUS
Have you ever done this before?
ASSASSIN #3
What?
MAXIMUS
Killed a man with a sword?
ASSASSIN #3
Not like this, exactly... this is
good, you can stop.
They stop.
They are far down the hill, out of sight of
the road.
MAXIMUS
It can be very messy -- you could
get blood all over your armor.
You
don't want to hack me up now.
You
want one clean stroke.
ASSASSIN #3
Would you kneel, General?
Maximus kneels, his whole body secretly coiling.
Assassin
#3 stands over him as:
MAXIMUS
One good stroke -- you do know
where, don't you?
ASSASSIN #4
Be quiet.
MAXIMUS
If you miss the spot there'll be
blood everywhere.
Quite a spray.
ASSASSINS #3
All right, where?
MAXIMUS
Here -- you don't want to hit the
vein on the neck --
Maximus points his bound hands at a spot on the back of
his neck.
MAXIMUS
Put the point of your sword here...
you want one, good blow right at
this spot --
Assassin #3 dutifully puts the point of his sword on the
spot on Maximus' neck.
A grave mistake.
Maximus instantly grabs the blade of the sword with his
hands and yanks it from Assassin #3 -- EXPLODING up -- his
hands are bleeding but he tosses the sword into the air
and catches it -- swings the sword with brutal efficiency
-- decapitating both assassins --
FOREST ROAD - DAWN
On the road above, the other two Assassins are on their
horses, waiting.
They hear a quick yelp from below.
And then nothing.
Assassin #1 nods for Assassin #2 to check on the
execution.
Assassin #2 canters off the road and down the
hill...
FOREST - BELOW THE ROAD - DAWN
Assassin #2 canters down the hillside.
He senses movement behind him -- spins around, drawing his
sword -- too late --
Maximus throws a sword -- it flashes through the air --
and into Assassin #2.
FOREST ROAD - DAWN
Assassin #1 waits on his horse.
He hears the commotion
below -- spins his horse around just as Maximus bursts to
the road.
He stands with a sword.
Assassin #1 spurs his horse and gallops toward Maximus at
full speed -- Maximus crouches and prepares --
Assassin #1 and Maximus swirl together for an instant --
both slashing brutally --
Assassin #1 continues to gallop past Maximus.
He stops.
He looks down.
A wound in his stomach.
He falls off his
horse.
Dead.
Maximus has also been wounded -- a deep gash on his side.
He fights the pain as he moves toward the horses...
FOREST ROAD - DAY
Maximus is galloping through the forest at lightning
speed, leading four horses behind him.
The gash in his
side bleeding.
TENT CITY - DAY
A gloomy day.
Emperor Commodus stands before the
assembled Felix Regiment.
The soldiers are already uneasy.
They note Quintus
standing by Commodus, wearing Maximus' seal of office.
Where is Maximus?
COMMODUS
Even as the Gods curse this dark day
with clouds, so too does the sun
begin to shine forth on a promised
tomorrow.
Even as we mourn the
passing of our father, so too do we
celebrate the coming of a bright,
new age for Rome.
At my side,
brothers, you shall pull fresh
glories from the heavens.
At my
side, brothers, you shall know the
adoration of the Gods.
Doubly-dark
is this day because my friend, your
noble commander Maximus Meridas, has
been called to Rome to deal with
urgent matters of state...
Titus glances quickly to Gallus, whose hand is bandaged
from surgery.
They know this cannot be true.
COMMODUS
Until his promised return I
appointed Quintus Domitian to serve
in his stead.
I salute you,
Legionnaires!
QUINTUS
(raising his sword)
Hail, Caesar!
The Felix Regiment responds, many unsure.
FELIX REGIMENT
Hail, Caesar!
Commodus strides off and the Felix Regiment slowly
disbands, muttering to one another in confusion.
Titus and Gallus go to Quintus.
TITUS
Quintus, what is -- ?
QUINTUS
(firmly)
Don't speak of it.
Never speak of
it.
He stalks off.
Titus and Gallus, concerned, watch him
follow after Commodus.
HILLSIDE - NIGHT
Maximus continues to gallop, he is on a different horse.
He leads only two horses now.
VINEYARD - DAY
Maximus' home in Spain is beautiful beyond measure.
We see verdant farmlands and vineyards and a spacious
house nestled amid gently rolling hills.
Maximus' eight-year-old SON is in a paddock playing with
his pony.
He stops, sees something.
Over a hill, he can
just glimpse a battle flag, approaching.
He screams with joy and runs toward the flag as he calls:
MAXIMUS' SON
MOTHER!
MOTHER!
FATHER'S HOME!
Maximus' WIFE emerges from the house, drying her hands on
a cloth and smiles.
Maximus' Son races toward the flag.
He can just see the
soldiers beginning to appear over the hill.
Not a Roman
Legion at all.
Twenty Praetorians canter over the hill.
Maximus' Son stops, confused.
OLIVE GROVE - DAY
Maximus is galloping up a hill, leading only one horse
now.
The horse he is on is exhausted, spent, foam coats
its neck.
It can't make it.
The horse collapses and Maximus falls.
He immediately
leaps onto the remaining horse and continues riding up the
hill.
HILLS AROUND VINEYARD - SUNSET
Maximus is racing over the countryside, galloping in a
frenzy.
His wound is bleeding profusely, coating the side
of his horse.
He rears the horse to a stop for a moment.
Over a hill he
can see thick black smoke rising.
He spurs the horse and
gallops over the hill...
VINEYARD - SUNSET
And his worst nightmares are realized.
His home and his vineyards have been destroyed.
The earth
has been scorched and his house is still smoldering.
He
rides up to the house and practically falls off the horse.
He pulls himself up and walks past the smoldering debris
of his house, fearing what he knows he will find.
He sees the bodies of servants scattered about in the
ruins.
He sees a Praetorian battle flag.
He continues on, his wound bleeding more with every
tortured step.
He finally stops.
He stares up.
His wife and his son have been crucified and burnt.
They
are nothing more than grotesquely twisted, charred shapes.
Maximus instantly collapses to his knees -- he howls out
his torment in a heartrending keen of despair as he coats
his face in the ashes of his dead world.
He sinks into
unconsciousness, praying for death.
VINEYARD - DAY
An unusual jingling sound is heard.
Maximus appears to be
dead, his gaping wound beginning to fester.
The source of the jingling becomes clear when we see the
feet of Bedouin brigands, with delicate anklets, shuffling
around him.
A hand touches his sandals.
Rich sandals.
Another touches his tunic.
Good cloth.
Suddenly Maximus groans.
The hands stop.
He's alive.
A
bit of quick language in an unknown tongue.
Then the hands grab Maximus and drag him away.
SLAVE WAGON TRAIN - DAY
Maximus' eyes slowly open --
Inches away from his face -- a lion roars --
Maximus lurches back.
He looks around to realize he is in a filthy slave wagon.
Three other wagons slowly move over the desert landscape.
Exotic animals are caged in pens or led alongside the
wagons:
lions, panthers, zebras, a giraffe.
A dozen
slaves are chained together alongside sacks of spices and
other cargo.
Bedouin slave traders jabber in a surreal
babel of foreign tongues.
And someone is looking at him.
JUBA, a striking African,
is gazing at him impassively as he chews something.
Juba
is also chained.
MAXIMUS
(weakly)
Am I in Hades?
JUBA
Yes.
Juba spits what he has been chewing into his hands and
moves to Maximus.
JUBA
For your wound...
Maximus stares at him.
JUBA
(nods)
For your wound.
Maximus looks down -- the bloody wound at his side.
Juba carefully places his poultice over the wound --
Maximus hisses in pain -- Juba massages the poultice into
the wound gently as:
JUBA
If you die in the wagons they feed
you to the lions... The lions are
worth more than we are.
I think we
are worth more than the zebras
though.
So they don't feed us to
them.
Maximus stares at him.
Juba looks down at him with the
barest hint of a smile.
JUBA
I'm not sure about the giraffe.
SLAVE MARKET - DAY
The heat of Morocco is unlike anything Maximus has ever
known.
Shimmering heat waves undulate over the sand.
The provincial market is bustling like the proverbial
anthill.
Slave traders and dealers and merchants move
around, all talking very quickly and very emphatically.
Maximus, Juba and a number of other slaves are on display,
poked and prodded and fondled.
Their BEDOUIN SLAVE TRADER
sings out their praises to any passers.
The crowd parts almost magically for the dramatic arrival
of PROXIMO.
Proximo is a large man of immense appetites.
He has the ferocious appearance of a true pirate.
Two
slaves follow behind him and impotently swat at flies with
switches.
SLAVE TRADER
Proximo, my old friend, see what I
have for you today -- !
Proximo SLAMS a fist into the Slave Trader's face.
The
Slave Trader sails back.
PROXIMO
Those giraffes you sold me won't
mate!
All they do is run around not
mating!
YOU SOLD ME EUNUCH
GIRAFFES!!
The Slave Trader pulls himself up, hugely obsequious.
SLAVE TRADER
I will make it up to you, Master.
It's bargain day for you!
Look,
look, look -- I have two lions and a
panther -- hear how they roar for
you!
"Bring me home, Proximo!"
Proximo examines the animals.
PROXIMO
How much for the lot?
SLAVE TRADER
For you -- 8,000 sesterces.
PROXIMO
For me -- 6,000 sesterces and I want
to see their balls first.
And you
throw in those two slaves.
SLAVE TRADER
(moves to Maximus)
What about this one?
Look at the
arms!
Proximo moves to Maximus.
The Slave Trader forces open
Maximus' mouth.
PROXIMO
Good teeth --
Proximo notes the many old battle scars on Maximus' body.
PROXIMO
Where did you get those scars?
Maximus doesn't respond.
PROXIMO
Are you a soldier?
Maximus doesn't respond.
PROXIMO
Do you speak? --
(he roars back to a
slave)
KEEP THOSE DAMN FLIES OFF ME!
(back to Maximus)
He's dying.
SLAVE TRADER
1,000 sesterces.
PROXIMO
My ass...
(moves to Juba)
You throw in this one and we'll make
it 7,000 sesterces for the whole
lot.
SLAVE TRADER
I have to eat, Master!
He's my
finest, I couldn't let him go as
part of the lot for less than 9,000
total...
(back to Maximus)
I tell you this one is prime.
He's
a Spaniard and killed fourteen of my
men before he could be subdued!
Proximo looks at Maximus, notes the many battle scars
again.
The scars, and something he senses in Maximus'
eyes, is enough for Proximo to consider it.
PROXIMO
(to trader)
All right, let's see.
The Slave Trader and his colleagues grab Maximus and
bustle him across the market, unlocking his chains.
Maximus has no idea what's going on.
In the center of the market place, a veritable GIANT of a
man sits on a small stool, a wooden sword in his hand.
He
is hunched over and chained to the ground by a ten foot
chain shackled to his ankle.
A think metal helmet is
riveted around his entire head, only long turfs of hair
emerging.
His dim eyes stare listlessly through a slot in
the helmet.
The Slave Trader puts a wooden sword in Maximus' hand and
shoves him toward the Giant.
The Giant stands.
He towers
over Maximus.
The Giant suddenly swings his sword -- he moves with
remarkable quickness -- Maximus makes no attempt to block
the blow -- it sends him flying to the ground.
Maximus pulls himself up.
The Giant moves in and hits him again -- Maximus recoils
-- the Giant hits him again -- Maximus falls.
Maximus pulls himself up.
The Giant moves in again -- he slams him a few more times
-- Maximus makes no attempt to protect himself -- he
falls.
Maximus pulls himself up.
The Giant is about to attack again --
PROXIMO
(to Slave Trader)
That's enough.
SLAVE TRADER
STOP!
STOP!
His colleagues race into the ring and haul the Giant away
from Maximus.
The Giant quietly sits back on his stool.
Proximo studies Maximus for a moment and then glances to
the Slave Trader.
PROXIMO
I'll give you 500 sesterces.
SLAVE TRADER
No -- no -- 1,000!
PROXIMO
(laughs)
Come, don't quibble with your old
friend.
I'll take the lions, the
panther, the Numidian and this one
for 7,000.
And I'll buy you the
best whore in the town for two
nights.
She's an enormous mountain
of flesh who craves a stern hand.
SLAVE TRADER
How could I say no to my old friend
Proximo?
PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - DAY
Maximus and Juba are crammed into a wagon with about ten
other slaves, including a very scared and reedy SCRIBE.
Other wagons are filled with exotic animals, including
several lions.
The wagons move through a crowded casbah and are taken
through an imposing set of gates to...
PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - COMPOUND - DAY
An open compound in Proximo's school.
On one side of the
compound is a series of cages filled with wild animals of
every description -- including Proximo's two hapless
giraffes.
Proximo's house slaves begin unloading the newly purchased
exotic animals into cages as Maximus and the new slaves
are unloaded.
Heavily armed guards supervise everything.
But Proximo's slaves are having a bit of a problem with
one of the new lions -- it growls and resists them.
Without the slightest hesitation, Proximo thunders to the
lion and grabs it by the mane -- manhandling it into a
cage.
PROXIMO
COME ON, YOU FILTHY BEAST!
He kicks the lion in the rear as he shoves it into the
cage.
Proximo's provincial school resembles nothing so much as a
seedy prison.
The fading grandeur of the decaying
battlements and the sweeping North African architecture
only slightly mitigate the brutal feel of the place.
And if Maximus had any doubts as to Proximo's profession
-- all doubts are washed away when he sees the compound.
Twenty GLADIATORS are working out in the compound --
hacking at practice dummies and sparring.
The many
heavily armed guards oversee everything.
The gladiators
stop working out as they see the new slaves enter.
They
eye their potential new opponents warily.
One huge, glowering gladiator -- VIBIUS -- watches with
particular interest.
His eye is quickly drawn to the most
obvious athlete:
Juba.
The new slaves are herded to the middle of the compound
and house slaves immediately begin throwing buckets of
water on them, cleaning them.
Meanwhile, Proximo shrugs off his cloak.
A slave brings
him wine as he give his "welcoming speech" to the new
slaves:
PROXIMO
Slaves.
I am Proximo, trainer of
gladiators.
You live and die at my
pleasure.
Fight well and you will
live.
Fight poorly and you will
die.
It is better to live.
Slaves now toss thick handfuls of powdered lime on the new
slaves -- they cough and clench their eyes shut, the lime
coats and stings their wet bodies.
PROXIMO
Here you will be trained in the art
of combat.
Here you will be given
the tools to survive.
Please my
patrons in the arena and all the
gifts of the world will be showered
upon you.
Imagine riches beyond
your paltry dreams of riches!
Imagine fame beyond your rude
understanding of the word!
All this
can belong to the select few who
prove their worth in the arena.
Slaves throw more water on the new slaves -- washing off
the lime.
PROXIMO
If... on the other hand... you
disappoint me... you will be
dismembered and fed to my jackals
limb by limb.
He gazes evenly at his new acquisitions.
PROXIMO
And my jackals are always hungry.
He strides off and the guards shove the new gladiators
toward their cells.
PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - COMPOUND - NIGHT
Maximus and Juba are being observed.
Proximo stands in
the shadows of the compound and watches intently.
SLAVE WAGON - PROVINCIAL STREETS - DAY
Blood appears to be flowing across an oxen's back.
But
the blood is too rich, too red.
The oxen are pulling an open slave wagon through the
crowded streets of the town.
Hanging above the street is
dyed wool drying in the sun.
Vermilion and crimson dyes
drip down and splash across the oxen -- and splash across
the gladiators.
Maximus, Juba, the formidable Vibius are chained in the
back of the wagon.
Also the frightened Scribe.
Proximo and a few of his guards drive the wagon.
Proximo
has an umbrella over him, colored with years of dripping
dyes.
They pass a banner honoring Vibius, the star of Proximo's
stable.
Meanwhile, the terrified Scribe is almost weeping,
chattering nervously to Vibius, chained next to him:
SCRIBE
I know nothing of armaments and
warfare!
I'm a scribe -- I write
down words!
I can write down seven
languages --
VIBIUS
Be still.
SCRIBE
I don't -- how do you hold the
sword?!
I've never held a sword!
VIBIUS
You point the sharp end at your
opponent and you shove it in his
guts.
SCRIBE
I can't -- I --
He suddenly vomits.
VIBIUS
(calling to Proximo)
Proximo!
You insult me with this
carrion!
Chain him to someone else!
PROXIMO
(calling back)
Don't worry, noble Vibius, he won't
be bothering you for long.
The Scribe begins to weep.
The crowds in the street jeer at the passing gladiators.
Occasionally throwing trash at them.
A pack of children
run alongside the wagon, chanting:
CHILDREN
Dead guts!
Dead guts!
Dead guts!
Maximus watches the children for a moment and then another
sight draws his attention.
Over some buildings he can see
vultures circling in the distance.
PROVINCIAL ARENA - DUGOUT - DAY
In the cramped holding area of the arena, a dugout beneath
the stands, Maximus and the other gladiators are waiting.
Proximo walks before them, giving a final "pep talk."
He
gazes at them evenly, his eyes going from face to face.
PROXIMO
Some of you say you can't fight, you
won't fight... They all say that...
But one day you will pick up a sword
and thrust it into another man.
And
the crowd will cheer you and love
you.
And you will love them for it.
On that day... you will be a
gladiator.
He stops at Maximus.
PROXIMO
In this life, we all die.
All we
can choose is how we die.
And how
we are remembered.
Be remembered
proudly.
Drums are heard from the arena.
Proximo nods to a waiting
blacksmith.
The blacksmith begins slamming shackles on the gladiator's
wrists -- chaining them together in teams of two by a
chain about four feet long.
The blacksmith is about to chain Maximus to the Scribe.
PROXIMO
No...
(he points to Juba)
... give the Spaniard to him.
Give
the Scribe to Vibius.
Proximo nods to Vibius, who, for reasons we shall soon
see, makes no protest to being chained to the whimpering
Scribe.
Proximo watches the blacksmith shackle Maximus and Juba
together and then strides off.
JUBA
(to Maximus)
Are we going to fight each other?
PROVINCIAL ARENA - DAY
Proximo sits in a box with several other GLADIATOR
TRAINERS.
They drink wine and eat constantly.
A
perpetual chatter of wagers and odds and side bets.
The arena is only sparsely attended this day.
PROXIMO
Make it 600 sesterces for each
decapitation.
TRAINER #1
How many strokes?
PROXIMO
Two.
TRAINER #1
For the great Vibius, one stroke.
PROXIMO
Done.
400 sesterces for two
strokes.
In the arena:
Proximo's chained teams enter the arena, five teams.
Maximus and Juba are chained together.
Some of the small
crowd cheers for Vibius.
He acknowledges the cheers.
He
is chained to the weeping Scribe.
In the box:
Trainer #1 laughs.
TRAINER #1
(re: Vibius)
Who's he with?
PROXIMO
A Greek Scribe.
TRAINER #1
I'll raise the wager.
PROXIMO
(smiles)
Give me odds, friend.
In the arena:
From the opposite end of the arena a dozen armored, very
scary Andabatae thunder into the arena.
Some of the crowd
cheers.
The Andabatae immediately race for the chained teams and
the battle is on.
Vibius spins into action -- dragging the weeping Scribe
after him as he circles opponents and fights -- the Scribe
is almost instantly killed -- Vibius immediately hacks
through the Scribe's wrist and frees himself, as Proximo
surely intended.
Vibius is now free to fight alone,
swinging the chain as an additional weapon.
Juba's eyes dart everywhere as he tries to move with
Maximus -- Maximus neither helps nor hinders -- allowing
Juba to pull him along --
Proximo, now that his star Vibius is safe, watched Maximus
and Juba closely.
Juba fights well, with a strange elegance, his body
flowing like liquid -- but he is inexperienced.
He
strikes a few blows and then tries to move away -- finally
he is in trouble -- cornered -- a huge Andabata is slicing
at him -- it is a desperate battle -- Juba is losing --
his sword is slammed away -- the Andabata raises his sword
for the kill --
And Maximus strikes.
With a sudden roar he EXPLODES into action -- he swings
past Juba and blocks the blow meant for Juba -- then he
slashes the Andabata -- killing him -- he pulls Juba after
him as he fights --
It is a dazzling display of Maximus' skill -- he moves
through the Andabatae at amazing speed -- spinning around
Juba and protecting him -- slashing ruthlessly -- pulling
Juba after him and commanding the battle -- Juba recovers
a sword and they fight together.
In the box:
Proximo watches, smiles.
A gladiator is born.
ROME - WAGON - DAY
SENATOR GRACCHUS, an imposing, moral and corpulent man in
his 60's, is riding in a luxurious wagon with Senator
Gaius.
And CAPTAIN MARCELLUS, the handsome Head of the Roman City
Guard.
Their wagon slowly maneuvers through the crowded streets
of Rome.
The cosmopolitan bustle of the great urban
center is everywhere around them.
GRACCHUS
We have plague in the Hebrew Quarter
and it is spreading... we have
looting at the granaries... we have
so much filth in the Tiber that the
water is undrinkable... we have
Praetorian Guard units that are
demanding protection payments from
the merchants at the exchange --
MARCELLUS
My City Guard units have tried to
curtail these excesses but no
constabulary can police the entire
city.
And the Praetorians outnumber
us two to one.
GRACCHUS
Rome dies as the Emperor plays at
beneficence.
At least Nero gave us
music!
GAIUS
Do you think he'll listen to us?
GRACCHUS
It is his duty to hear the will of
the Senate.
Their wagon stops -- hopelessly stuck in a massive traffic
jam of chariots, wagons and sedan chairs.
GRACCHUS
Not to mention the damn traffic!
PROVINCIAL ARENA - DAY
We continue with Maximus as he strides into the roaring
arena.
We finally see him in the blazing sunlight -- he wears
traditional gladiator armor and now has longer hair and a
beard --
A battle is already in progress, fighting and dead and
dying gladiators crowd the arena --
We stay with Maximus as he wades through his opponents,
fighting them heroically, slashing through them without
stopping --
The large crowd cheers mightily -- chants of "Spaniard!
Spaniard!
Spaniard!"
We stay with Maximus as he cuts through the four Celts
like a scythe through wheat and then we dramatically pull
up and away --
Taking in the roaring arena and the hero.
PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - COMPOUND - NIGHT
A large mess area has been set up.
The tables around the
compound are crowded with gladiators.
Guards everywhere.
Maximus and Juba enter.
Move to get food.
All
conversation gradually drains away as the other gladiators
watch them.
Silence.
Maximus and Juba note the strange silence as they move to
a large table.
Vibius is at the table with a number of other gladiators.
There are no places for Maximus and Juba.
Vibius stands and kicks two other gladiators off their
bench.
VIBIUS
MOVE ASIDE!
THIS IS A TABLE FOR
MEN!
Maximus and Juba sit.
Vibius remains standing.
He begins to pound on the table
with his fist.
Soon all the gladiators are pounding on
their tables.
It is a cacophonous din honoring Maximus.
SLAVE WAGON - OUTSIDE ROME - EVENING
Maximus is crouched in the back of an enclosed slave wagon
with Vibius, Juba and a few other gladiators.
In the distance, Rome.
ROMAN STREETS - SLAVE WAGON - NIGHT
Maximus cranes for a sight of the Eternal City through a
hole in the wooden slats that cover the slave cart.
He can see only glimpses of Rome as they pass.
But the
images are not what he expected.
Alongside the undeniable
glory of the city, the madness and disease Marcus Aurelius
spoke of are readily apparent.
Maximus sees flashes of plague victims being tossed on
carts heaped with bodies -- he sees getting and spending
and commerce everywhere -- he sees fascist Praetorian
Guard units trooping past -- he sees the magnificent
architecture of the city -- he sees starving children
begging from filthy gutters -- he sees rich citizens out
for a stroll -- he sees a swirling combination of
sophistication and depravity, of civilization and
corruption.
He sits back in the cart, deep in thought.
Vibius looks
at him.
VIBIUS
Not what you expected?
MAXIMUS
No.
VIBIUS
Rome is nothing but a slaughter
house.
And we are the meat.
PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT
The slave wagon pulls up to Proximo's rather grand Roman
compound.
Guards unlock imposing gates and the wagon
drives in...
PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - COURTYARD - NIGHT
Inside the gates is a large courtyard, much like Proximo's
Moroccan school but much more impressive.
A fountain with
an enormous statue of the war god Mars is central in the
courtyard.
The gladiators climb from the wagon, stretching after the
long journey.
Vibius leads Maximus and Juba to the
statue.
He wades through the fountain and kisses the toe
of Mars.
VIBIUS
Tradition.
He watches over us.
Juba steps up and kisses the toe.
VIBIUS
(to Maximus)
Oh go on, it won't kill you.
Maximus kisses the toe as well.
PROXIMO
(calling to them)
Stop that!
You'll get some
monstrous disease and then you'll be
worth nothing to me!
Guards come and lead them to their cells, which line one
side of the courtyard.
COLOSSEUM - DAY
A flurry of images from around the Colosseum, the energy
mounting.
At this point we see practically nothing of the
inside of the Colosseum:
Slaves are balancing high above the empty arena.
They are
on ropes unrolling huge rolls of muslin; sun tarps that
provide shade below...
Merchants open stalls in the curved arcade around outside
of the Colosseum.
They sell everything from food to magic
elixirs, from toys to aphrodisiacs.
They immediately
start declaiming and demonstrating the virtues of their
products...
Gangs of whores of both sexes trawl the streets.
They
have bizarrely-colored hair and elaborate makeup...
Citizens begin arriving, pushing past the vendors and the
pickpockets.
We see whole families with picnic lunches...
Ferocious animals are brought into the Colosseum in barred
cages...
In the busy arcade, barbers and blood-letters practice
their craft alongside exotic alchemists, fire eaters and
contortionists...
Richer citizens arrive in sedan chairs and chariots, they
feign indifference to the hooting mob...
Mounted City Guard police units try to retain some
order...
Gamblers crowd betting booths and haggle mercilessly...
Finally, we see Maximus and the other gladiators in a
slave cart.
Maximus watches everything as the slave cart
disappears into the Colosseum...
COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY
At last we see it.
The mighty Colosseum Arena.
Nothing we could have possibly imagined could have
prepared us for the sight of the thousands and thousands
of screaming spectators, the row after row of cheering
faces.
It is staggering.
But for Maximus none of this exists.
His full attention
is focused on one spot alone.
The Imperial Box.
He can see Commodus and Lucilla sitting in the box.
The
box is elevated fifteen feet above the arena floor at the
top of a sheer black marble wall.
A cohort of fifty
imposing Praetorian Guard Archers surround the box.
Commodus' personal Body Guard of six Centurions actually
stand in the box itself, eyes constantly watching like
modern Secret Service agents.
Commodus is untouchable.
Meanwhile, three teams move from different entrances to
the arena.
As Cassius orates to the crowd:
CASSIUS
This day we reach back to hallowed
antiquity to bring you... THE FALL
OF MIGHTY CARTHAGE...!
(the crowd cheers)
... On the barren armies of the
barbarian Hannibal!
Ferocious
mercenaries and warriors of all
brute nations bent on merciless
conquest!
Your Emperor is pleased
to give you... THE BARBARIAN HORDE!
He gestures to the gladiators in the arena.
The crowd
laughs, jeering the "barbarians."
The drummers begin pounding out a more insistent, heroic
beat.
CASSIUS
But on that illustrious day the Gods
sent against them Rome's greatest
warriors...!
The very life-image of
nobility and glorious valor... who
would on this day, and on these same
arid Numidian deserts, decide THE
FATE OF THE EMPIRE... Your Emperor
is pleased to give you... THE
LEGIONNAIRES OF SCIPIO AFRICANUS!!
The crowd EXPLODES in cheers as the huge doors at one end
of the arena suddenly burst open and ten chariots thunder
in --
Each chariot has a driver and an archer, both dressed in
theatrical versions of the familiar Roman Lorica
Segmentata.
A chaos of dust -- and the battle is on --
The chariots zoom around the arena -- the archers keeping
up a deadly hail of arrows.
Maximus immediately dives onto a passing chariot and kills
the charioteer and archer -- he dramatically leaps from
the front of the chariot to a lead horse and cuts it free.
And Maximus takes control, we see the General of the Felix
Regiment gloriously alive again as he barks out orders and
leads his gladiators in battle.
They follow him
faithfully, his stern commands unquestioned.
His strategies are quick and smart, he makes the
gladiators work together.
This kind of slaughter could last for hours...
We see flashes of the endless battle... Maximus races on
his horse past another chariot, kills the driver, the
chariot smashes into a wall... the sun sinks lower, the
shadows on the sand lengthen... areas of the sand are
swamps of blood, Juba slips, pulls himself up fighting...
Maximus uses Vibius to create a diversion, two chariots
collide... the crowd roars... a gladiator is dragged
between a chariot and the side wall of the arena... the
drummers pound out their relentless tattoo...
Finally...
Maximus is on his horse across from the final chariot.
We can see that Juba and Vibius and a few other gladiators
are still alive.
The rest of the arena is polluted with
the dead and injured.
Maximus spurs his horse and gallops toward the final
chariot -- the charioteer whips his horses and zooms
toward Maximus --
The crowd is breathless -- watching the final battle --
Maximus and the chariot speed toward each other -- like
Medieval jousters --
And collide in a flashing explosion of steel --
Maximus sails from his horse -- as the charioteer sails
from his chariot --
Maximus lands hard but quickly pulls himself up, he races
to the final charioteer.
The charioteer is defeated but
not dead.
Maximus glances around, all his opponents are defeated.
He stands over the final charioteer.
Then he simply
tosses down his sword.
The crowd is stunned by this strange act of mercy.
But
then an enormous roar grows from the crowd -- wave after
wave of adulation for the hero of the day.
Maximus looks around, taking it all in.
Then he turns to the Imperial Box.
Maximus slowly walks to before the the Imperial Box.
The
Praetorian Archers immediately raise their bows, pointing
down at him.
Maximus glares up at Commodus through his helmet mask.
Commodus returns his gaze, curious.
The crowd is intrigued, growing quiet.
What is going on?
Then Maximus simply turns and begins walking away.
COMMODUS
Slave!
Who are you?
The Colosseum is suddenly silent.
The Emperor is speaking
to a gladiator.
Maximus keeps walking.
COMMODUS
SLAVE!
WHO ARE YOU?
Maximus keeps walking, his fists clenched now.
Commodus suddenly grabs a spear from a nearby Praetorian
and hurls it with perfect aim -- the crowd gasps -- the
spear sails past Maximus -- actually nicking his shoulder
-- it slices into the sand ahead of Maximus.
Maximus stops.
COMMODUS
SLAVE!
WHO ARE YOU?!
Maximus can hold it no longer.
He spins to Commodus --
ripping off his helmet mask -- and THUNDERING:
MAXIMUS
I AM MAXIMUS MERIDAS, GENERAL OF THE
FELIX REGIMENT OF THE ROMAN ARMY AND
SERVANT TO THE EMPEROR MARCUS
AURELIUS!
Commodus eyes shoot wide -- Lucilla bolts up -- Gracchus
leans forward -- Proximo is stunned -- the crowd is
mystified --
MAXIMUS
I AM FATHER TO A MURDERED SON AND
HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE AND
LANDLORD TO A MURDERED WORLD -- AND
I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE!
The Praetorian Archers tense their bows -- ready to kill
the defiant slave --
But something extraordinary stops them.
Almost as one
being the crowd roars -- they leaps to their feet and
thrust their thumbs up!
They cheer and stomp their
approval of Maximus.
Commodus looks around at the people of Rome, amazed.
He finally plasters on a benevolent smile and thrusts his
thumb up!
The Praetorians lower their bows.
And the crowd cheers.
Never in the long, long history of
the Colosseum have they ever seen such a thing.
Maximus leads his gladiators out of the arena.
COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY
The Colosseum is again packed.
Commodus, Lucilla and her
son Lucius are in the Imperial Box.
It is late in the day and teams of slaves are cleaning the
arena after a bout.
They haul off carcasses and toss down
fresh sand.
Meanwhile, Cassius is orating to the crowd:
CASSIUS
... in his majestic charity the
Emperor has deigned to this day
favor the people of Rome with an
historical final match.
Returning
to the Colosseum today... after five
years in retirement... Caesar is
pleased to bring you... THE ONLY
UNDEFEATED CHAMPION IN ROMAN
HISTORY...
(the crowd is going
mad)
... THE LEGENDARY... TIGER OF GAUL!!
The crowd erupts in paroxysms of joy as TIGER explodes
into the arena in an ornate chariot.
Tiger is a fierce
man in his 40's, his brutal, scarred face and hugely
muscled body a testament to his many years in the arena.
Tiger speeds around the rim of the arena in his chariot,
raising an arm in triumph.
The crowd roars.
COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY
Maximus is fighting an opponent.
The drums continue...
COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY
Maximus defeats his opponent.
He stands over him.
He
does not kill him.
He tosses his sword down and walks away.
The crowd goes
crazy, roaring their approval of Maximus.
Senator Falco, sits in the stands and watches with some
alarm.
He glances around as the crowd exalts Maximus.
He
is becoming a hero to the people.
The drums continue...
SLAVE WAGON - ROMAN STREETS - DAY
Maximus and the other gladiators are in a slave cart on
the way from the arena.
A gang of children run alongside
the cart, cheering and chanting:
KIDS
Maximus the Merciful!
Maximus the
Merciful!
The drums continue...
COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY
Vibius defeats an opponent -- he stands over him.
He
looks around at the crowd.
Then he tosses down his sword
and walks off.
The crowd goes mad with pleasure.
Vibius eats it up,
raising his arms and soaking up the applause.
Maximus watches from the holding cells.
He smiles.
The drums continue...
STREET - NIGHT
Proximo supervises as a huge banner is unfurled.
It
covers the side of a tall building.
It shows a dramatic painting of Maximus.
Proximo supervises happily as torches and braziers are lit
to illuminate the mammoth banner.
The drums continue...
COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY
The ending of a group fight -- Proximo's gladiators
triumphant.
The crowd waits for the delicious act of defiance.
We
note many placard and banners honoring "MAXIMUS THE
MERCIFUL."
Maximus, Vibius, Juba and a few other gladiators toss down
their weapons and walk off, leaving their opponents alive.
The crowd roars.
They have completely embraced Maximus
and his fellow gladiators.
Gracchus, in the stands, laughs.
The drums finally conclude.
COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY
Maximus is fighting a thick GIANT of a man.
A few quick
blows and the Giant falls -- like a mighty tree he crashes
to the sand.
The arena cheers their hero.
Maximus stands over the beaten Giant.
The crowd waits for
the famous act.
Maximus salutes the Giant and tosses down his sword,
refusing to kill.
He walks away.
The arena explodes in cheers -- a chant of "Maximus the
Merciful" grows to deafening proportions.
Suddenly the arena is filled with Praetorians -- they
block Maximus' exit from the arena -- the crowd boos --
horrified --
The Praetorians surround Maximus.
He is unarmed, but
coils for the inevitable battle.
Then the Praetorians part...
And Commodus walks through them.
He carries something
wrapped in a rich cloth.
Maximus glares at him.
The Praetorians move back and the crowd watches eagerly.
The Emperor and the Gladiator, at last.
Maximus and Commodus stare at each other.
The crowd
cannot hear what is said, but strain to observe this
incredible confrontation.
COMMODUS
Brother... we've taken a sad path
since we were children at Capri,
have we not?
Maximus doesn't answer.
COMMODUS
For my own part... I am sorry it
came to this.
And to you alone of
all men, I acknowledge my errors.
And my regret.
I shall live with my
sin for all my days.
MAXIMUS
As will I, Commodus.
As will I.
Commodus unwraps the cloth bundle.
Inside is a small
wooden sword.
He holds it up so the crowd can see.
A collective gasp.
The wooden sword, prized by all
gladiators above all else.
Freedom.
COMMODUS
As the first act of my contrition I
offer you the wooden sword of
freedom.
He holds out the wooden sword.
A beat.
COMMODUS
Take it, brother.
Stand at my side
as a free man worthy of your
ancestors.
MAXIMUS
I only have ancestors because of
you, brother.
You killed everything
that ever lived alongside me.
A beat.
COMMODUS
Take it, Maximus.
Let us heal that
fatal wound together.
MAXIMUS
This is the new home you cursed me
to.
And I am safer here from your
treachery than I could ever be
outside.
COMMODUS
Will you always mistrust me?
MAXIMUS
Why don't you ask your father that?
Commodus visibly flinches at that, but still holds the
wooden sword out.
The crowd is breathless.
MAXIMUS
I have more power as a slave in the
arena than I could ever have as a
free man.
As the Colosseum goes,
the people go.
As the people go,
the Empire goes.
COMMODUS
(tense)
You think this is power?
I could
show you power, slave --
MAXIMUS
No, Caesar... I will show you.
With that, Maximus does the unimaginable.
He simply turns
his back on the Emperor and walks away.
And the crowd goes mad.
They cheer the defiant gladiator,
their champion.
And, equally, they deride the Emperor.
They mock him by
holding out food and trash like Commodus is holding out
the wooden sword.
They laugh and jeer.
Commodus glances around at his children, lost.
Then he turns to the Imperial Box.
He sees Lucilla
slipping out the back of the box.
He watches her go.
And the crowd continues to jeer.
STREET THEATER - NIGHT
The crowd laughs riotously as Roman Actors perform a
typically ribald comedy in a secluded street:
An outrageously dressed version of Maximus is parading
around on an outrageously dressed version of Commodus,
riding him like a donkey and slapping his rear with a
wooden sword.
The "Commodus" actor mews and brays and
wails like an infant.
Captain Marcellus of the City Guard gallops past them, on
his way out of Rome.
PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - COURTYARD - DAY
Maximus stands with Juba and Vibius.
He draws a circle in
the sand with a stick.
He draws a line to the circle.
MAXIMUS
The Felix Regiment will come from
here.
We'll face the body of the
Praetorians outside -- here.
Once
inside, my archers will take up
position to counter opposition
inside the Colosseum.
I'll enter
and join you -- we'll attack here --
Maximus draws a line to the Imperial Box.
MAXIMUS
-- a covert assault from within.
VIBIUS
We'll be killed.
MAXIMUS
Probably.
A beat.
MAXIMUS
But if we aren't... think of the
glory.
Do you remember glory,
Gladiator?
JUBA
And if we die that day -- we die
free men worthy of our ancestors.
VIBIUS
You didn't know my ancestors.
A
rotten bunch.
Maximus points to the huge statue of Mars.
MAXIMUS
Then be worthy of him.
The old
Titan who would rather die bravely
in a just battle than slink off to
grow old and fat.
JUBA
And impotent.
A beat.
Vibius thinks about it.
VIBIUS
If I die, I want a hundred whores at
my funeral.
PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT
With cool military precision the Praetorians take up
position at the gates before Proximo's compound, an
unassailable line.
They quickly prepare their bows.
Meanwhile, another Praetorian unit has taken up position
at the other end of Proximo's compound -- sealing that
entrance as well.
PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - COURTYARD - NIGHT
Proximo is hurrying across his open courtyard when the
first flaming arrow arches into the compound -- it is
followed by hundreds more --
The Praetorians on either end of his compound keep up a
ceaseless hail of flaming arrows -- everything begins to
burn -- the caged gladiators are stirring now --
shouting --
Proximo races to his panicked guards --
PROXIMO
Release them!
Release them all!
ARM THEM!
The guards sprint to the cells -- unlocking the gladiators
as quickly as they can --
Not quick enough for many -- Praetorians are now pouring
pitch through the gutter that runs along the bottom of the
cells -- igniting it and incinerating all those trapped
inside --
The compound is soon a raging inferno --
Proximo releases Maximus and Juba --
PROXIMO
Come --
MAXIMUS
But --
PROXIMO
If you want to live -- follow me --
VIBIUS
(calling to them)
Go, Spaniard!
We'll show these
Roman dogs how gladiators fight!
Proximo hauls Maximus and Juba off as Vibius and the other
gladiators arm themselves --
PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT
Vibius hoped to die fighting -- he never got the chance.
It is not a battle, it is a slaughter.
The Praetorians ruthlessly shoot anyone even approaching
the gates -- all the walls are covered -- most of the
gladiators die in the hellish inferno -- the relentless
rain of flaming arrows continues --
Vibius coughs in the thick smoke and rages for someone to
fight -- Praetorian snipers cut him down -- he dies
reaching for the statue of Mars.
STREET OUTSIDE PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT
They emerge through a sewer entrance -- right into the
arms of the Praetorian Guard.
Proximo and Juba are bound.
Proximo sees his compound burning.
Sees the Praetorian
archers taking out any last survivors.
Hears the screams.
VARIOUS LOCATIONS - ARREST MONTAGE - NIGHT
A quick sequence of brutal arrests as Praetorian Guard
units round up many associated with the plot.
And many
that are not.
GAIUS' BEDROOM:
Gaius and his wife are yanked awake and
hauled out.
CHRISTIAN HOME:
A congregation of Christians is chained
together, their secret altar smashed.
CAFE:
Greek Scholars are hauled away from their scrolls.
STREET THEATER:
Actors are dragged off in the midst of a
performance.
GRACCHUS' STEAM ROOM:
Gracchus is enjoying grapes with
his handsome catamite.
A unit of Praetorian bursts in.
Gracchus looks at them.
Sighs.
TIBER RIVER - NIGHT
Maximus splashes to the surface of the filthy Tiber,
gasping for air.
Animal carcasses float up next to him.
He grabs onto one
and floats down the gently flowing river.
ITALIAN FRONT - CAMP - DAWN
The Wolf of Rome sleeps.
Then its ears rise.
Then its
head.
It sniffs the air.
The wolf slowly rises and
begins loping through the camp.
It passes slumbering soldiers and tents, smoke lazily
drifting up from campfires.
The wolf finally stops and looks up.
Maximus is on a horse.
He climbs down.
The wolf goes to
him and licks his hand.
Maximus begins marching through the camp, the wolf at his
side.
Soldiers stir, amazed to see their General is
alive.
Gallus leaps up, stunned, and goes to Maximus.
They
continue to march through the camp, more and more
astonished soldiers joining them.
They march toward the large tents at the center of the
encampment.
Titus emerges from his tent.
Slams to a stop --
TITUS
By all the Gods...
He goes to Maximus and embraces him.
MAXIMUS
Old friend...
TITUS
You're returned from Hades!
By all
the Gods!
MAXIMUS
Where is he?
Just then Quintus emerges from the largest tent.
He
stares at Maximus, unbelieving.
A long beat as they look at each other.
Quintus knows his destiny.
With quiet dignity he begins
whispering a prayer.
Maximus moves to him, embracing him:
MAXIMUS
I forgive you.
He stabs Quintus with a dagger as he embraces him.
Quintus falls.
A beat.
Titus goes to the dead Quintus and pulls the seal of
office from his uniform.
He hands it to Maximus.
An enormous roar of celebration from the Felix Regiment.
OUTSIDE THE COLOSSEUM - DAY
The hymn is all we hear as we see crowds moving into the
Colosseum...
It seems that all of Rome is here for this great day.
Huge throngs of citizens move like a massive wave toward
the Colosseum entrances.
Vendors are doing brisk
business.
Praetorian units in full dress uniform canter
past.
We elegantly float up along the outer tiers of the
Colosseum and then glide over the edge to see the arena
stands...
COLOSSEUM - DAY
The hymn is all we hear as we see...
The stands are filling.
We see the rich and poor alike.
We see the orator Cassius.
We see Senator Falco and most
of the Senate.
We see the cohort of fifty Praetorian
taking up position around the Imperial Box.
A golden platform, with stairs down to the arena sand, now
extends about twenty feet from the Imperial Box to a spot
over the arena.
We float down the stairs and then we see the arena
itself...
It is stunning in its simplicity.
The days victims are tied to posts in the center of the
arena.
Suspended above them is an enormous cloud.
A
thick, tumescent bladder painted to look like a
threatening rain cloud.
We see Proximo and Juba.
We see Senators Gracchus and
Gaius.
We see Gaius' wife and Gracchus catamite and
Christian families and scholars and actors.
Seven stylized hills surround them.
The hymn comes to its soaring conclusion as we see the
damned.
TIME CUT:
Later.
By now, the Colosseum is packed.
All fifty-five
thousand seats are taken.
Another ten thousand stand
wherever they can.
A feral anticipation buzzes through
the crowd.
Outside the Colosseum, the streets are crowded with
thousands more who couldn't get in.
Trumpets blare.
Commodus' six Centurion Body Guards stride into the
Imperial Box.
Then Commodus enters.
He is shrouded in a full lion's
skin, the head of the lion concealing his own.
His head
is down, he does not look up.
Lucilla and Lucius enter after him and sit.
Lucilla's
face is drained, her eyes defeated.
Lucius is wearing a
miniature set of Lorica Segmentata, complete with
ceremonial dagger.
ROMAN STREET - DAY
A mangy dog is slowly crossing a dusty street on the
outskirts of Rome.
The street is deserted.
It seems that
almost everyone is at the Colosseum.
The dog stops.
Looks up.
Then a sound is heard.
The steady cadence of horses'
hooves.
The Felix Regiment rounds a corner.
Maximus leads the
cavalry.
He wears Lorica Segmentata.
His corps of
archers and soldiers follow.
They troop down the dusty
street.
Maximus and the cavalry canter past the mystified dog.
QUICK CUTS:
The Felix Regiment moves through the streets.
The few
pedestrians quickly disappear into shops and around
corners.
The roar of the Colosseum can be heard far in
the distance...
Arrows slice into isolated Praetorian sentries.
The Felix
Regiment continues its stealth invasion...
Finally, Maximus reins his horse and his troops stop.
The mounted City Guard are waiting.
Without a word, the City Guard joins Maximus and the two
combined forces continue their inexorable march to the
Colosseum.
COLOSSEUM - DAY
Commodus, still swathed in the lion skin, his head down,
slowly walks out on the platform that now extends from the
Imperial Box.
The crowd grows hushed.
Commodus reaches the end of the platform and waits for a
moment.
Then he dramatically flings off the lion skin.
The crowd gasps.
He is almost naked, his entire chiseled body is painted in
gold.
His eyes are lost in an eerie reverie as he looks
around at his people.
He finally speaks:
COMMODUS
(serene)
Rome... This is the day that was
foretold.
This is the day when your
father takes away all fear...
(he holds up his
hands)
With these hands I shall destroy
your enemies so that you may sleep
always and forever in peace.
From
this day forth let it be known that
I, Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus,
have surmounted mortality.
That I,
Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus,
assume my destined place... at the
side of the Gods.
The crowd is stunned.
A few scattered laughs.
Lucilla stares at him, disbelieving.
COMMODUS
And as a righteous God, I shall ever
protect you.
I shall cradle the
world on my benevolent hands and
clasp it to my heart.
So I have
spoken!
And let the heavens tremble
at my might!
ROMAN STREETS - DAY
Maximus continues to lead the combined Felix Regiment and
City Guard cavalry through the streets.
The roaring is
closer now.
They are nearing the Colosseum, they can just
glimpse the edge of the top tier over some building.
COLOSSEUM - DAY
Commodus continues:
COMMODUS
This day I reclaim Rome for her
people.
I shall give you the
rebirth of your Empire!
Reborn and
cleansed of her enemies!
He raises his arms.
At his cue the Praetorian archers
raise their bows, ready, aiming at the victims.
COMMODUS
I will make a new Rome!
Founded as
it was at the beginning!
Archers --
GIVE US BLOOD!
The Praetorians suddenly point their bows higher and
fire --
They shoot the cloud -- the bladder EXPLODES and thick
blood rains down on the victims -- the blood splashes over
them, coating them.
OUTSIDE COLOSSEUM - DAY
The roar from the Colosseum is now deafening as Maximus
and the City Guard round the final corner -- the Colosseum
is before them -- the massive Praetorian Guard force is
caught of guard -- with crisp military efficiency the
Felix Regiment and the City Guard quickly canter into
place, an unbroken line of seasoned warriors facing the
Praetorians.
The huge mob outside the Colosseum is confused, intrigued,
watching the face-off.
The mounted archers of the Felix
Regiment have drawn their bows.
Maximus looks down from his horse at a Praetorian Officer.
MAXIMUS
Throw down your weapons or we will
kill you.
A beat.
The Praetorian Officer glances at the formidable force
against him.
He drops his sword.
His men follow suit.
MAXIMUS
(he turns to his men)
FELIX REGIMENT!
DO HONOR TO YOUR
ANCESTORS!
I SALUTE YOU!
He spurs his horse and the Felix Regiment roars, springing
into action -- they gallop through the crowd and to the
Colosseum -- meanwhile the City Guard disarm and guard the
Praetorian --
COLOSSEUM - DAY
Commodus continues:
COMMODUS
As it was at the beginning so is it
now.
The great She-Wolf of Rome
will again suckle us, again ravage
our enemies -- AND BRING US A WORLD
REBORN!
At his cue, two elevator platforms rumble into view,
rising from the bowels of the Colosseum to the arena sand.
On each platform is a cage full of ferocious wolves, they
snap and growl, straining to be released.
COMMODUS
So it was for Romulus and Remus,
sons of Mars, so shall it be for us!
The great She-Wolf will --
Suddenly -- the huge wooden doors of the arena burst open
and Maximus leads the Felix Regiment cavalry thundering
into the arena.
The crowd is stunned -- Commodus is stunned -- Lucilla
bolts up --
Commodus immediately spins to Lucilla, his eyes burning --
His Praetorian are momentarily confused --
At Gallus' command the Felix Regiment archers let fly --
multiple arrows and bolts cut through most of the
Praetorians -- some confusing skirmishes as the remaining
Praetorians fire back --
Maximus leaps from his horse and begins cutting the
prisoners free --
Meanwhile, Commodus strides back down the platform toward
Lucilla in the Imperial Box, murder in his eyes --
She suddenly hugs Lucius quickly and kisses him --
LUCILLA
Remember your mother.
She pulls the ceremonial dagger from his little uniform
and pushes him to his attendant -- his attendant pulls him
away as --
Lucilla spins to Commodus -- he grabs her into an embrace
-- he turns the knife on her -- thrusting deeply as he
kisses her --
A long kiss as he holds her tightly to him.
Then he
gently sits her down on her throne.
Her eyes wide, dying.
One of Commodus' Body Guards grabs him:
CENTURION BODY GUARD
Caesar -- we must go -- !
Commodus' six Centurion Body Guards begin hustling him out
of the Imperial Box --
COMMODUS
GET THE BOY!
He grabs Lucius from his attendant and drags him off --
They try to escape out the back of the Imperial Box -- but
Felix Regiment troops are blocking their way -- racing up
toward them --
CENTURION BODY GUARD
THIS WAY, CAESAR!
Below, through the confusion, Maximus sees Commodus
escaping with Lucius down through a side tunnel.
Maximus cuts Juba and Proximo free.
Juba immediately
snatches up a sword.
Maximus quickly offers a sword to
Proximo.
MAXIMUS
Captain?
Proximo takes the sword.
MAXIMUS
(re: Commodus and
the others)
Where are they going?!
PROXIMO
This way!
They race across the arena and into a tunnel...
COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY
A trap door springs open and the elevator platform rises
to the sand of the arena.
Maximus stands above the dead
Emperor.
The crowd stares in amazement -- and then begins to cheer
in joy at the return of their hero.
A chant begins...
"Maximus the Merciful... Maximus the Merciful... Maximus
the Merciful..." which then grows to a refrain of
"Caesar... Caesar... Caesar..."
Maximus ignores them, his eyes drawn to one sight:
Lucilla.
He goes to the steps of the platform leading to the
Imperial Box.
He slowly climbs the steps.
In the Imperial Box, Senator Gracchus is standing.
So too
Juba and others.
Lucius is kneeling by his mother, holding her hand, his
head down.
Lucilla is dead.
Lucius mourns with quiet
dignity.
Maximus looks at Lucilla and kneels.
He takes her other
hand.
A long moment.
He looks at Lucius.
Then he slowly bends forward and kisses Lucilla deeply,
the ritual farewell.
He stands.
Senator Gracchus steps to him:
GRACCHUS
General, the purple is yours if you
so desire.
The Senate will support
you.
Maximus looks at him.
And then at the people.
The chant
of "Caesar... Caesar... Caesar..." is like a powerful
beating heart.
Maximus moves to the edge of the Imperial Box to address
the people.
The crowd grows silent.
Maximus looks around at the blood of the arena.
MAXIMUS
Rome... you are better than this.
Look inside yourselves.
I challenge
you to find your true voice.
Help
the Senate speak for you.
Make them
your champion... And dare to think
what could be.
A beat.
MAXIMUS
I give you back the dream.
With that he slowly turns and walks down the steps to the
arena sand.
The crowd is absolutely silent.
He goes to Titus:
MAXIMUS
When everything has calmed down,
lead an orderly withdrawal.
Take
them home.
Titus salutes.
Maximus return the salute and then leaps onto his horse.
As he canters toward the exit he turns for one final look
at Lucilla.
He sees that Lucius is now at the foot of the stairs, on
the arena sand, gazing at him.
Maximus stops his horse.
He canters back to Lucius.
The boy looks up at him.
A
moment between them.
Lucius thrusts up his hand.
Maximus grabs his hand and
swings him onto the horse behind him.
A look to Juba.
Juba bows his head with respect.
Farewell.
Maximus spins the horse around and begins cantering out of
the Colosseum.
Juba disappears into the crowd.
Maximus and Lucius canter across the arena and through the
huge doors...
COLOSSEUM - DAY
From high above we see Maximus and Lucius riding out of
the Colosseum and disappearing into the streets of Rome.
FADE TO:
VINEYARD - DAWN
Maximus stands with Lucius at his old vineyard.
It is still scorched and dead, weeds overgrowing the
vineyards, the house ruined.
Maximus puts a hand on the boy's shoulder, this boy so
like his own son.
MAXIMUS
It doesn't look it now... but soon
we'll have it growing again... Next
year there will be vines, and then
there will be grapes... It will be
alive.
We leave them, dreaming of the future.
FADE OUT.
THE END
