      A NOTE slips out from the top vent of a locker in the busy 
      corridor. Jackson slowly unfolds the piece of paper to read 
      an unseen message scrawled on it. As he crumples up the note--


      A phone VIBRATES across the top of a desk. Jackson snatches 
      it up to look at the screen. Then begins thumbing a reply.


      Slipping into his car, Jackson brings up the navigation 
      system and starts inputting an address, copying it from the 
      text on his phone. The open car door CHIMES as--


      Pushing through a door, Jackson steps into an almost pitch 
      black corridor. Eerily quiet, except for the creak of 
      floorboards beneath his feet.

      He starts walking. When he rounds a corner, he pauses, 
      hearing VOICES. Like whispers drifting toward him. He starts 
      forward again, reaching up in the darkness to push open a 
      door into--


      A crowded corridor. A lineup of TEENS and TWENTY-SOMETHINGS 
      glance momentarily back at Jackson. None particularly 
      surprised to see him, they return to impatient chatting.

      Inching around, Jackson peers ahead to see the line ends at 
      an old WOOD-SLATTED ELEVATOR.                      TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/122.

      Dark figures quickly trade CASH for TICKETS through the 
      slats. Two teenage girls step from the head of the line and 
      hurry off past--

      Matt. Nervously staring at Jackson.

                                  MATT
                    Hey... Jackson. You re not going to 
                    punch me again, are you?

      Jackson cocks his head as if confused. Almost like he doesn t 
      even recognize Matt.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    You want to go ahead of me?

      Jackson nods. Matt steps aside and lets him in. Breathing in 
      relief, he notices someone else behind the crowd.

      Scott. Except he s not stepping into line. He s watching. 
      Keeping his eyes on Jackson.

      Matt throws him a questioning glance, but Scott shakes his 
      head, a surreptitious request to act normal. Finally, Matt 
      looks forward again while Scott pulls back into the shadows,  
      into the darkness where--


      A DESK LAMP clicks on. Under the glow, Sheriff Stilinski 
      pulls off the wrapper from a burger. But when he takes a 
      bite, he nearly chokes on it.

      Ahead, Jackson inches toward the front of the line. He leans 
      out, trying to see the ticket seller behind the wood slats. 
      But is able to catch only glimpses of faces.


      Faces of the Kanima victims--Sean, Jessica, the Mechanic and

      Moments later - HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOKS and PACKED TRANSCRIPT 
      FOLDERS drop down onto the desk. Stiles flips one open while 
      Stilinski quickly pours over transcripts and paperwork.

      Stiles snaps up the 2006 yearbook. Pages flipping forward, 
      black and white high school photos rise into focus. The faces 
      of young men and girls. One smiling girl in particular--


      THE PROMOTER of the underground show. Flanked by TWO 
      BODYGUARDS in the elevator, she s now 24, far tougher and 
      wiser looking than her high school picture.

      tickets, she peers through the wood slats at Jackson.

      Jackson responds by slowly raising a single finger. Unnerved, 
      the Promoter slides one TICKET through the slats. Jackson 
      reaches up with his money and--

      Briefly touches hands with the Promoter as ticket and 
      twenties are exchanged.

      Scott peers out from the line to see the exchange and to 
      notice the disturbed look on the Promoter s face as she 
      retreats back a step behind the wood-slats.

      Under a chorus of sighs from those in line who didn t get 
      tickets, the elevator s MOTOR sputters into action.

      From below, Jackson watches the Promoter rise in the 
      elevator. Eyes fixed on her with the calculation and coldness 
      of a predator staring down its next prey.

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF


        Dark-clothed figures move urgently down the hospital 
      corridor. Leading them is the same EMT who was at the 
      aftermath of the attack at the night club.

      He glances back to Argent and Allison. Then motions for both 
      to follow around a corner.


      The door clicks open and the EMT pulls his keys out of the 
      lock. Argent gives him a nod and shuts the door behind him. 
      Alone, he and Allison face steel tables with two sheet-
      covered BODIES lying on them.

                    calls it the Kanima.

      Allison nods, trying to seem as if it s a word she s heard 
      for the first time. Argent watches her closely, gauging the 
      reaction. Then moves to the second body.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    This one... Jessica. She was 
                    smothered to death after giving 
                    birth. The police think it was done 
                    by someone else. We think it s a 
                    person who controls the other 
                      shapeshifter. That means two 
                    killers, Allison. One human. One 
                    not.

                                    ALLISON

                    way.

      He steps around the body, fingers skirting the edge of the 
      sheet as if threatening to tear it off.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    You know the question I had when 
                    Gerard first told me about our 
                    family? Why us? He quoted me 
                    Winston Churchill: The price of 
                    greatness is responsibility.

      His gloved hand grips the sheet. Allison tenses for the 
      reveal of the body. But instead, Argent straightens the 
      sheet, gently smoothing it out.

                    It s an interrogation. Am I right?

                                  ARGENT
                    That depends on what you know. 
                    Gerard showed me the library. The 
                    cameras didn t catch everything, 
                    but do you really think a little 
                    high school fight can explain that 
                    amount of damage?

                                    ALLISON
                    Does he... Does he know about 
                    Scott?

                                  ARGENT
                    No. But he suspects. We understand 
                    you re trying to protect your 
                    friends. But people are dying. A 
                    child was orphaned. What you know 
                    makes you responsible.

      Argent yanks the sheet from Jessica s body. Allison holds 
      still as she looks, trying not to react.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    It makes you responsible for this.

      And finally, Allison meets his eyes.

                                    ALLISON
                    What do you want me to tell you?

                                  ARGENT
                    Anything you know. Anything that 
                    can lead us to answering the one 
                    question that might mean 
                      everything...

      He steps forward, leveling a glare on her she rarely sees as 
      he emphasizes each word.

      THE DEAD BOLT clicks back on the front door. Scott steps 
      aside to let Derek and Isaac in.

                    And Derek doesn t care. Now where s 
                    the vet and is he going to help us 
                    or not?

                                  DEATON (O.S.)
                    That depends.

      They turn to see Deaton watching them from just beyond the 
      examining room.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    Your friend Jackson. Are we

                          (reassuring Deaton)
                    Save him.


      Deaton unlocks a drawer to reveal dozens of GLASS JARS, 
      different grains and petals inside. 

      Most interesting to Derek s eyes are the Celtic symbols on 
      each jar s lid - a TRIQUETA, an AWEN, TARANIS WHEEL and 
      others. Isaac reaches for a jar but Derek grabs him by the 
      wrist.

                                  DEREK
                    Watch what you touch.

      Deaton takes one jar with the symbol of a SHIELD KNOT on it 
      and views the contents inside.

      He places the jar back with a look of dissatisfaction.

                      Unfortunately, I m not sure if

                                  ISAAC
                    How about an effective offense?

                    We tried.
                          (to Deaton)
                    I nearly ripped its head off and 
                    Argent emptied an entire clip into 
                    it. The thing just gets back up. If 
                    anything, I think it s getting 
                    stronger.

                                  DEATON
                    Has it shown any weaknesses?

                                  DEREK
                    One. It s either afraid of water or 
                    it can t swim.

                                  DEATON
                    Does that go for Jackson as well?

                                  SCOTT
                    No. He s a perfect swimmer.

      Deaton thinks a moment. Then removes a new item from the 
      drawer. A old, scratched steel PENDANT.

                                  DEATON
                      Essentially you re trying to catch 
                    two people. A puppet and puppeteer.

      He places the odd piece on the table. It s the symbol of 
      CERNUNNOS, a horned God seated in a meditative position. He s 
      encircled by a snake which he grasps at the throat in his 
      right hand.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/1212.

                    I don t think Jackson could do it. 
                    His mother died pregnant too. She 
                    might have been murdered. I think 
                    he couldn t let the same thing 
                    happen to someone else.

                                  ISAAC
                    How do you know it s not part of 
                    the rules? The Kanima kills 
                      murderers. If Jackson killed the 
                    wife, the baby would have died too.

                                  SCOTT
                    Then doesn t that mean your father 
                    was a murderer?

                                  DEATON
                    Hold on. The book says they re 
                    bonded. What if the fear of water 
                    isn t coming from Jackson, but from 
                    the person controlling him?

      He pulls another jar from the drawer, this one filled with a 
      gray ash. The symbol on it is for ROWAN. Deaton unscrews the 
      lid and begins lightly pouring out the contents around the 
      amulet with Cernunnos on it.

                    that affect a creature like the

      A nervous Allison turns around in the dark and empty

                    What?

                                    ALLISON
                    Well, I m not sure how it happened 
                    or how I said yes, but I m actually 
                    supposed to hang out with Matt.

                                  SCOTT
                    That s great. It s perfect. Go out 
                    with him.

                                    ALLISON
                      Seriously?

                                  SCOTT
                    Yeah. Make a big deal of it in 
                    front of your Mom. Even kiss him if 
                    you have to.

                                    ALLISON
                    Kiss him? You sure about that?

                                  SCOTT
                    Totally.

                                    ALLISON
                    Like really kiss him?

                                  SCOTT
                    Well, what s really kiss him?

                                    ALLISON
                    Like this.

      Allison pulls him closer to demonstrate. Lips opening to his, 
      body pushing into his. She leaves him momentarily breathless.

                                  SCOTT
                    Yeah, not like that.

      She smiles. But it fades quickly.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/1219.

                    What is it?

                                    ALLISON
                    Nothing. I better go.

      Scott nods. She starts toward the door. Both seeming to want 
      to say something else, neither able to find the words. Until 
      Scott remembers to whisper three important ones:

                                  SCOTT
                    I love you.

      She pauses. Her response comes quickly. Too quickly.

                                    ALLISON
                    You too.

      Turning again, she slips into the rush of students. A 
      troubled Scott waits for a moment and then falls into the 
      crowd as well, letting the door close behind him.

      If either of them had turned around to look at the door to 
      the adjoining room, they might have spotted a FACE at its 
      center window.

      Allison's mother, Victoria, who does not look pleased. Not 
      pleased at all.

      FADE IN:


      Deaton holds up a VIAL of CLEAR LIQUID to the light. Scott 
      and Stiles step forward for a closer look.

                                  SCOTT
                    Ketamine?

                                  DEATON
                    Same thing we use on the dogs. Just 
                    a higher dosage.

      Deaton hands Scott the vial and a HYPODERMIC.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    If you can get close enough to 
                    Jackson, it should slow him down 
                    enough to buy you some time.

                                  STILES
                    Ketamine for the Kanima.
                          (off their looks)
                    Yeah, that wasn t funny.

      Deaton places a glass JAR in front of Stiles filled with gray 
      ash. The symbol on the top of the jar is for Rowan.

                                  DEATON
                    This is a sample of what you ll use 
                    to create the barrier. Now, this 
                    part is for you, Stiles. And only 
                    you.

                                  STILES
                    That sounds like a lot of pressure. 
                    Could we find a slightly less 
                      pressure-filled task for me?

      Deaton pours a touch of the ash into his hand to show him.

                                  DEATON
                    It s from a mountain ash tree which 
                    is believed by many cultures to 
                    protect against the supernatural. 
                    This office is lined with mountain 
                    ash wood which makes it difficult 
                    for someone like Scott to cause me 
                    any trouble.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/1221.

                    So I spread this around the whole 
                    building and neither Jackson or 
                    whoever s controlling him won t be 
                    able to cross it?

                                  DEATON
                          (nodding)
                    They ll be trapped.

                                  SCOTT
                    That doesn t sound too hard.

                                  DEATON
                    That s not all there is. Think of 
                    it like gunpowder. It s just powder 
                    until a spark ignites it. You need 
                    to be that spark, Stiles.

                                  STILES
                    If you mean light myself on fire, 
                    I m not sure I m up for that.

                                  DEATON
                    Let me try a different analogy. I 
                    used to play golf. What s 
                      interesting about the best golfers 
                    is they never swing without first 
                    imagining where they want the ball 
                    to go. They see it in their mind. 
                    And their mind takes over. It can 
                    be pretty extraordinary what the 
                    force of your own will can 
                      accomplish.

                                  STILES
                    Force of will.

                                  DEATON
                    If this is going to work, Stiles, 
                    you have to believe it.

      Stiles nods. Then lowers his worried eyes to the jar on the 
      table with its simple yet mysterious symbol for Rowan.


      Gerard and Argent gather with SEVERAL HUNTERS in the 
      basement, which serves as their armory and mission control. 
      Allison watches the men arm up like a SWAT TEAM preparing for 
      a dangerous assault.

      Argent RACKS A SHOTGUN, gathering their attention.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/1222.

                                  ARGENT
                    All right. The concert s in a 
                    warehouse just inside the 
                      industrial sector. Allison has 
                    learned that Jackson Whittemore 
                    will be there and is very likely 
                    seeking his next target out of the 
                    crowd. Since we still have little 
                    clue as to just how strong he is, 
                    we need to remain extremely 
                    cautious. 

      He glances to Gerard who nods in agreement while casually 
      swallowing a handful of capsules from a PILL BOX.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    When Allison has Jackson s location 
                    and determines him to be at the 
                    optimal point where we can take him 
                    down, she ll signal me. Optimal 
                    meaning as far away from the crowd 
                    as possible. There will be no 
                      collateral damage tonight.
                          (to Allison)
                    Go ahead.

      All eyes on her, Allison steps back and heads for the stairs. 
      When Gerard hears the door click shut, he looks to Argent.

                                  GERARD
                    As willing a participant as she 
                    seems, your young proteg  there 
                    also appears to be under the 
                      impression that we re planning a 
                    trap.

                                  ARGENT
                    True. But she doesn t need to know 
                    anymore than that.

      From the table full of weapons, Gerard pulls a TACTICAL 
      SWITCHBLADE KNIFE.

                                  GERARD
                    For the rest of us then, let me 
                    make it perfectly clear. You don t 
                    trap a creature this dangerous.

      Thumbing the button, the black blade springs up before his 
      eyes.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)

      A crowd surges into the corridor, hurriedly turning one 
      corner after another toward the muffled BEAT of HOUSE MUSIC.

      Among them, Isaac s cold-blooded eyes provide a stark 
      contrast to the excited young faces. 

      Following just behind, an increasingly less confident Erica 
      throws nervous glances about as the crowd pushes down into--


      An old, winding stairwell. The concert-goers charge down with 
      rising excitement.                     TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/1226.

      The BEAT shakes the walls, pounding harder and harder as they 
      reach the last step, bodies disappearing into almost complete 
      darkness.

      Hands dart up, grasping at DIRTY PLASTIC SHEETS hanging from 
      the ceiling, pushing through as--


      THE MUSIC HITS LIKE A CLAP OF THUNDER. Beats slamming down 
      and almost seeming to lift the dancing bodies off the floor.

      A FIELD OF LASERS descend over the bodies in the packed main 
      room. The most devoted fans push up against a CAGED DJ BOOTH.

      Watching from behind security gates, the Promoter nods her 
      head to the frenetic beat while all too unaware of someone 
      else in the crowd--

      Jackson.

      Everything about him seems different. Calm and calculated, he 
      moves like a snake. Slow turns of the head. Unblinking stare. 
      A group of girls pass by, enveloping him in the crowd while--

      Matt and Allison step into view. She smiles at him, trying to 
      act normal. But then a look of alarm crosses her face when 
      she finds Scott staring at her from the shadows.

                                    ALLISON
                    Matt, give me a second. Okay?

      He barely nods before she s off, hurrying toward Scott.

      equally unaware of a miserable, frightened Allison Argent, 
      pushing back tears at her eyes.

      While the DJ brings his audience to new sonic highs, off in 
      the shadows among plastic sheets and mesh cages, Scott hands 
      the ampule of Ketamine to Isaac.

                    Right. Then turn the needle around 
                    and push on the plunger just a tiny 
                    bit to force the air out. Find a 
                    vein and go for it.

      He hands Isaac the syringe.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/1229.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    And be careful.

                                  ISAAC
                    I doubt I m going to even slightly 
                    hurt him.

                                  SCOTT
                    I meant you. Don t you get hurt.

      Isaac looks at him as if he can t quite understand why he 
      would care. But Scott doesn t wait to notice. With a few 
      steps, he disappears into the crowd, hurrying for the exit.


      Eyes sweeping the crowd, Jackson searches for the Promoter. 
      Strangely entranced by the music, his head nods to the beat. 
      Like a cobra mesmerized by a snake charmer.

      Fingers brush against his arm. He turns to find Erica dancing 
      near him. Moving closer, she brings her body to his, dancing 
      with him.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/1230.

      Her fingers lightly guide his hands to her hips.

      Grinding her body against his, she appears to have stolen his 
      attention, music and movement hypnotizing him as they come 
      closer and closer.

      Isaac slips in behind Erica, his closed hand turning to 
      reveal the uncapped SYRINGE, its point GLINTING in the light.

      As their three bodies press tightly together under the 
      pounding music, Isaac inches the syringe closer, preparing to 
      strike.

      But then Jackson s head snaps up. CLAWS OUT, he jams his 
      hands in, one DIGGING into Erica s back, the other CUTTING 
      right into Isaac s stomach.

      The music buries Isaac and Erica s CRIES OF PAIN while 
      Jackson jerks them closer to him. The pupils disappear from 
      his eyes, replaced by a WHITE GLOW. His voice drops to an 
      echoed, almost otherworldly rasp.

                                    JACKSON
                    He belongs... to me.

      Ripping his claws out, Jackson lets them go. Injured and 
      bloody, Erica and Isaac stagger back. 

      THE SYRINGE slips out of Isaac s weakened grip and drops to 
      the floor, rolling right into the crowd.


      Navigating the crowd with renewed urgency, Jackson finally 
      spots the Promoter.

      She stands off to the side of the stage just behind a row of 
      metal security barricades.

      Sights set, he begins pushing people aside to get to her.


      Pressing a hand to his still healing torso, Isaac scrambles 
      to find the hypodermic.

      It rolls between high tops, past sneakers and through boots. 
      Struggling to keep his sights on it, Isaac reaches out to 
      grab it only to get bumped aside.

      Just nearby, Jackson inches closer to the Promoter.                     TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/1232.

      She keeps her position at the edge of the stage just beyond a 
      security barricade. Never seeming to notice Jackson coming at 
      her. Never seeing--

      THE NEEDLE PLUNGE INTO HIS NECK.

      Isaac jams the syringe in and presses the plunger down with 
      his thumb. With a shocked GASP, Jackson fall into Isaac s 
      arms.

      Dropping the needle to hold him up, Isaac looks to Erica with 
        a triumphant smile. It worked.


      Slowly drifting back to consciousness, Scott notices he s 
      lying on a concrete floor. The BEAT of the music can still be 
      heard, but distant.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/1234.

      Victoria peers down to find Scott waking up. On a crate in 
      front of her is a conical-shaped DIGITAL VAPORIZER.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I m sure you recognize this device. 

      Blinking away his blurred vision, Scott tries to focus on it.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    When we smoked pot it was in a 
                    rolled up piece of paper. These 
                    days it seems like all you kids get 
                    a free digital vaporizer with your 
                    medicinal marijuana card.

      She takes out a VIAL, crushed PURPLE LEAVES inside it.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    Here s the unfortunate truth, 
                    though. Just because you call it an 
                    herb, doesn t make it healthy.

      Victoria carefully empties the contents of the vial into the 
      top of the vaporizer.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    This type of wolfsbane is one of my 
                      favorites, actually. Lovely smell. 
                    You probably won t like it, 
                    however.

      Victoria hits the start button and the vaporizer begins to 
      hum softly as a soft cloud puffs out of it.

                                  SCOTT
                    What... what are you... doing?

                    What am I doing? Isn t it obvious? 
                    I m killing you.


      In a small supply room, Erica and Isaac prop Jackson in a 
      chair. The door swings open and Stiles whips inside, 
      surprising them.

                                  STILES
                    Just me, just me. Is he okay?

      Turning back to Jackson, Isaac flicks open his hand to reveal 
      CLAWS at his fingertips.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/1235.

                    Let s find out.

      He slashes down. But without moving his head or even opening 
      his eyes, Jackson s hand instantly wraps around Isaac s, 
      catching him by the wrist in mid-strike.

      Breath held, Erica and Stiles watch, waiting for the worst. 
      But Jackson s hand slowly relaxes and lets go of Isaac. 
      Everyone breathes.

                                  STILES
                    Let s not try anything like that

                    I thought the Ketamine was supposed 
                    to put him out?

                                    JACKSON
                    I m here.

      The three of them turn to look at Jackson. Head hanging to 
      the side, his lips move.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Right here with you.


      Victoria adjusts the vaporizer, aiming it more clearly at 
      Scott.

                                  VICTORIA
                    It s going to look like an 
                    accident. Like you had an asthma 
                    attack and couldn t get to your 
                    inhaler in time.

      As the vapor begins to drift over Scott, he moves, as if 
      trying to lift himself back to his feet.

                    Too late. Looks like it s working.

      Scott s eyes now turned a brilliant yellow, the 
      transformation appears to be happening slowly but surely.

                    Hard for Allison too. But I think 
                    this is easier than her seeing you 
                      eventually get shot in the head by 
                    her own father. Really, it s all 
                    for the best.

      Scott s clawed hands SCRAPE against the cement floor as he 
      looks up to show he s now fully transformed. Pushing himself 
      up from the floor, it looks as though he might actually get 
      to his feet.

      Victoria digs a heel into his back and shoves him down to the 
      floor with a smile.


      Allison dances with Matt in the middle of the crowd. He 
      watches her while she lets her eyes wander from one face to 
      the next, trying to spot Jackson.

      She nods and he takes her hand to pull her further into the 
      crowd. With her free hand she hits SEND on a text to her 
      father that reads: I can t find him.

      When she looks up from the phone, she almost SLAMS right into 
      Mr. Harris. She blinks, shocked to see him.                     TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/1237.

      Stiles, Erica and Isaac cautiously inch back from Jackson 
      while scales rapidly begin forming on his arms, skin changing

      to packing up sound equipment. Latching a steel case, she 
      lifts it up and--

      CLAWS GO RIGHT INTO HER THROAT.

      Mouth open, eyes wide in terror she gazes at the snarling 
      Kanima as blood pours over her lips.

      The clawed hand rips back and the Promoter drops to the 
      floor. Her body jerks in dying spasms while the fast-paced 
      BEAT of the music begins to change, pounding drums becoming 
      the one-two thump of a HEARTBEAT.

      A beat that slows. And eventually stops.


      Scott lurches onto his back, sucking in a pained gasp while 
      Victoria watches with amusement, almost relishing his last 
      moments.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/1241.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Alpha, Beta... But what are you 
                    Scott? Omega. Don t you know the 
                    lone wolf never survives without a 
                    pack? I remember hearing the cry of 
                    an Omega once. It s a miserable 
                    sound. The howl of a lone wolf.

      Scott s eyes fall closed as his breathing slows to a deathly 
      gasp. But then the words of his best friend drift up from his 
      memory to remind him of something crucial.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    Do you even know why a wolf howls?

      Strength seems to surge back into Scott s clawed hands as 
      they push up against the floor.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    It s a signal. When a wolf s alone 
                    it howls to signal its location to 
                    the rest of the pack.

      Alarmed, Victoria rises, noticing his eyes blinking open.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m not...

                                  VICTORIA
                    What? What s that?

                                  SCOTT
                    I m not... alone.

      Scott s eyes flare with a YELLOW GLOW as he pushes himself 
      up, mouth opening wide. And with his last breath--HE HOWLS.


      Lying still as the wolfsbane vapor fills the room, Scott s 
      eyes turn from YELLOW to BROWN and slowly close.

                                  SCOTT
                      Allison...

      Unable to open his eyes, he tries to make his lips move.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Please... please tell her... I m 
                    sorry.

      As Scott stops breathing--the door BURSTS OPEN.

      Derek CRASHES in, eyes darting across the room. Scott on the 
      floor. The vaporizer. But no Victoria.

      Because she s behind him. Raising up a TACTICAL KNIFE, she 
      plunges it right into his back. Derek s eyes FLARE RED as he 
      ROARS in pain.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/1243.

      With an animal ferocity of her own, Victoria rips the knife 
      out, preparing to stab again. But Derek spins to defend 
      himself, teeth and claws SLASHING out.

      Victoria staggers off him, knife clattering to the floor. 
      Their bodies move fast, impossible to tell what s happening.

      Gasping for his own life, Derek finds Scott on the cement 
      floor and--with his last bit of strength--he lifts him up.

      Victoria is gone. The music stopped, replaced by a new sound 
      rising in the distance... POLICE SIRENS.


      Sheriff's Deputies surround the backstage. Behind the 
      security gates, the DJ s crew and other witnesses look on the 
      BODY OF THE PROMOTER. Face down in a pool of blood. 

      The shoe of one civilian carefully steps around the blood. 
      Former Sheriff, Stilinski. He does not go unnoticed by the 
      District Attorney and Jackson s father, Mr. Whittemore.

                                  MR. WHITTEMORE
                    Really think it s a good idea being 
                    here?                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/1244.

                                  STILINSKI
                    You going to ask me to leave?

                                  MR. WHITTEMORE
                    What do you want, Stilinski?

      The former Sheriff unfolds a piece of paper from his coat.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Her name.

      Whittemore looks at him for a moment, then gives in.

                                  MR. WHITTEMORE
                    It was Kara. Kara Simmons.

      Stilinski peers down at the list of names for Mr. Harris s 
      2006 Intermediate Chemistry.

                                  STILINSKI
                          (a whisper to himself)
                    She s not here.

      Crumpling the paper in his hands he peers up at Kara 
      Simmons s body and the mystery surrounding it.

                                  STILINSKI (CONT D)
                    She s not on the list.


      Deaton pulls a syringe out of Scott's arm and eases him back 
      onto the table. Scott s weary eyes close and he passes out. 

      Slumped on the floor against the brick wall, Derek wheezes 
      with difficulty.

                                  DEREK
                    Thank you.

      Still gasping, Derek closes his own eyes. Deaton drops the 
      syringe into a safety bin and steps out of the examining 
      room.


      In the moonlit front of the clinic, Deaton moves for his desk 
      but then pauses when he notices someone seated in the waiting 
      area, half in shadow.

                                  MS. MORRELL
                    I can t decide if I admire your 
                      sentimentality. Or despise it.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/1245.

                                  DEATON
                    If I want your opinion I ll make an 
                      appointment with the Guidance 
                    office.

                                  MS. MORRELL
                    From the state of things I think 
                    you could use a little guidance. 
                    Are you really going to leave all 
                    of this up to a couple of kids?

                                  DEATON
                    They re more capable than you 
                    think.

                                  MS. MORRELL
                    And are you going to tell them 
                    what s coming?

      Eyes on the examining room, he shakes his head.

                                  DEATON
                    They ve got enough to worry about.
