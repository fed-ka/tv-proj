TILLEY
Who's sick?
NORA
Who do ya think I'm screaming at?
How many of you are there up there?
There's only you, and you're a sick
human being.
TILLEY
(quietly, coming
down a few steps)
Where's my white on white shirt?
The nice one, you know.
NORA
It's like yelling through a wall
to you. I'm carrying on about
what a disgusting human being you
are, and all you want to know is
where your white on white shirt is.
TILLEY
Yes, the one with the permanent
stays.

He drives along, mumbling to himself.

He starts moving his head -- stretching his neck from
right to left.
TILLEY
It's not even eleven o'clock

He juts his jaw out.

Seated at a booth are three aluminum siding salesmen
having their late morning breakfast. SAM PICKLES, a

GIL
Ben Cartwright had a colored guy
stay overnight at the Ponderosa?
MOUSE, who is picking his teeth with a matchbook, squints
at Sam with an investigative look.
MOUSE
Did he know this guy personally?
SAM
No... he was just passing through,
asked if he could stay over, and
Ben Cartwright said 'sure thing.'
It doesn't make any sense... he
invites a strange colored guy in...
invited him in to stay. Is that
crazy or what? If a colored guy
came to my door and said 'can I
stay the night,' I'd tell him
'get the fuck out of here'! It's
nothing personal, mind you.
MOUSE
You're not a bigot, is that what
you're telling us?
SAM
Me?
No, I'm not a bigot.
GIL
If you're not, how come you're
making such a big thing out of it?
SAM
It's the fact the Ben Cartwright's
on the Ponderosa... he's in the
middle of nowhere. It's not like
he's living on Reisterstown Road
with houses all around... we're
talking about the West here. It's
the idea that a strange guy comes
to the door in the middle of the
West. It doesn't make sense,
that's all I'm saying.

to Tilley.
FLORENCE
Not too gooey.
Coffee right

She trails the last word. Sam is still talking about
his problem with "Bonanza."
SAM
I just don't believe that 'Bonanza'
is an accurate description of the
West. I say no more.
Tilley slips into the booth next to Sam.
He indicates

toast)
Did ya live?

TILLEY
Yeah, I got his name. The police

the guy's an idiot.
He pulls a piece of paper from his pocket.
TILLEY
Yeah, here it is... some Polish
name... Babowski... Bill Babowski

GIL
I know the guy... they call him
BB.
TILLEY
You know the son of a bitch?
GIL
Yeah, he works with Bagel.
TILLEY
He sells aluminum siding? I
don't believe it... of all the
people that could run into me, it
has to be a fucking tin man. How

corner of the room there are two or three GIRLS working
the telephones -- canvassing -- talking to people on the

the benefits of aluminum siding. They all speak in a
very congenial tone of voice.

MOE

Sure you wanna get into the tin
game?
STANLEY
Money's good, I understand.
LOONEY
Lot of crazy people you're gonna
run into when you're knocking on
those doors. Hermits that don't
see the outside world, Jehovah's
Witnesses that try and sell you
the Bible at the same time you're
trying to sell them tin. People
that are just lonely and want to
have conversations.
CARLY
Every time you step in that door,
you've got to be fast on your feet.
STANLEY
Interesting.
MOE
(quizzing Stanley)
What's the best way to qualify
a mark?
STANLEY
What?
MOE
How do you know if you can get the
upper hand? How do you know if
you're dealing with a guy who's in
an inferior position to you, or
superior position? How do you

Guy bends down to pick up the
matches for you, you got a mark...
you got this guy in your pocket.
If he looks to you to pick it up,
you've got a long, hard, tough
sell on your hands.
BB walks over to the guys, having just poured himself
some coffee.
BB
You want to get in good with these
people... you want to win their
confidence? Good thing to try...
get a five dollar bill, take it
out when the guy's not looking,
drop it on the ground. Guy looks
back, pick it up, hand it to him
and say, 'Mr. Blah blah, you
musta dropped this five dollar
bill on the ground.' Two things
happen... he says, 'It's not
mine,' you say, 'Musta been, 'cos
it's certainly not mine,' or the
guy takes it. Right away this
guy is thinking you must be one
hell of a nice guy... you're in.
You start chipping away... you

left it with my other bills. I
wonder what it is?
SAM
Maybe it's a refund check.
Tilley opens the envelope and looks at the document.
TILLEY
Hum... says here that they haven't
received my 1962 taxes. They seem
to be saying that they didn't
get my check for four thousand
dollars.
SAM
What? It must be a clerical
error.
TILLEY
I can't believe they spend all
that time and energy to write to
me... to single me out.

Let's look at it this way, what
if I can sell you this job at a

the burden. The big boss won't get

They dance for a bit and look at one another. He leans
toward her, holds her tight and kisses her. Then the
RECORD STICKS on the words "that's the time"... "that's
the time"... "that's the time"... BB slips off one of his
loafers, while still embracing Nora, kicks it so that it
hits the side of the record table. The RECORD SLIPS
a little and continues to play correctly.

You've got a pretty good aim.

The Barman calls over to Tilley who we see sitting at a

Hey, Tilley, somebody wants ya on

Tilley gets up from the table and goes over to the phone.

Tilley slams the phone down.

He opens the door, flips on the lights and looks around.
He races upstairs and starts rifling through the closet
and drawers, pulling out Nora's clothes -- her dresses,
skirts, blouses, and coats -- and he opens the window
wide and throws them out. He screams as he tosses
underwear and the rest of her clothes.

He grabs Nora's shoes and throws them out onto the
street. Then he goes into the bathroom and piles all of
her toiletries in his arms, tosses them into a trash can.
Takes a suitcase from a shelf in the bedroom, opens it,
throws in the trash can. He clears out her underwear
drawers and empties them into the suitcase, closes the
suitcase and then throws that out of the window. He's
out of breath, exhausted and sweating. He goes down-
stairs into the kitchen to get himself a drink. He
sees a pair of Nora's slippers under the kitchen table,
he picks them up, opens the back door and tosses them
outside. Locks the door. He stands there as if a
motor is running inside of him. Walks out of the
kitchen.

Tilley is driving.

A voice calls out.
VOICE (O.S.)
Tilley!
Let me see you.
Tilley walks over to the coffee machine.
TILLEY
Wing, give me a minute to get
a cup of coffee here.
Tilley passes Sam on the way to the coffee machine. Sam
is looking through the sports page of the newspaper,
along with Mouse and Gil.
SAM
What about 'Super Highway' in the
seventh... it's paying 7 to 1.
Ran well in its last race.
Gil looking at the newspaper.
GIL
'Super Highway'...

Number four in the fourth -- 'Rider's

Why don't you just throw the
twenty dollars in the trash can
right now.
TILLEY
'Rider's Revenge'... I like that
name. I've gotta go and see Wing.
(a little pissed off)
Look, we can be scientific from
now to doomsday, but we gotta be
gutsy and go for the big one.
Tilley goes through the door into Wing's office.

His office
is equally messy and thrown together as
everything
else in the Gibraltar offices. As Tilley
closes the
door, his coffee, which is filled to the top
of his cup,
spills over the top and starts to burn his
hand.
TILLEY
Ah!
Ah!
He jumps back, and puts his coffee down on a desk, and
wipes his hand on the back of his jacket.
TILLEY
What's up, Wing?
Wing is sitting at his desk which is cluttered with
papers.
WING
You lost a sale, Tilley. The
Hudsons' loan didn't go through.
TILLEY
What do ya mean? They wouldn't
clear the loan?

charges, failure to pay child
support from a previous marriage
... guy's overdue on his mortgage,
overdue on his car loan, and he
was fired from his last job for
misappropriation of funds.
TILLEY
What's wrong with this world?
There are sick people out there!
Thievin' son of a bitch like that
takes up my time... cuts into
the amount of hours I have
available to deal with other
people interested in my wares!
There's no fucking sympathy for
the working man in this country.
WING
They don't make our job easy,
Tilley.
TILLEY
(lamenting)
Wing, it was such a beautiful
thing... you shoulda seen how I
worked. Like a magician... 'this
job is free'! It was my best...
my best! There's no fucking
justice in this world... there
ain't no justice.
Tilley goes to pick up his coffee off the desk.
WING
Did you see the paper?
TILLEY
What section?
WING
Take a look at this.
He hands the newspaper to Tilley.
TILLEY

An area has been set up for hearings to take place. This
seems to be a temporary headquarters until something sub-
stantial can be worked out. There are boxes and crates
all over. There's a long table with a number of commis-
sioners behind it, and a defense table a little way
across the room. MICROPHONES are being used, and the
sound BOOMS -- ECHOING off the walls. A small gallery of
people are watching the proceedings.
ANGLE ON JOHN MASTERS
who is presiding over the hearings. Even though he wears
a tie and a vest, he is nonetheless very sloppily dressed.
To his left and right are two other home improvement
commissioners.
MASTERS
Now,
when you made your initial
sales
pitch, did you indicate
that
you would be giving free
storm
windows with the job?
ANGLE ON MURRAY BANKS
A typical aluminum sidings salesman, in his early 40's.
He leans into the microphone.
MURRAY
Free storm windows?
MASTERS
Yes. That you would provide a
free set of storm windows with
the sale of aluminum siding.
MURRAY
No, sir. I wouldn't be able to
make any money if I was giving
away storm windows. My cost of a
storm window is somewhere like...

MASTERS

The point being that you had no
intention of giving away the storm
windows.
ANGLE ON BB AND MOE
Standing by the door at the back of the warehouse.
MURRAY (O.S.)
The storm windows, as I can recall,
was not an issue. I mentioned
that I thought the storm windows
would cut down on their heating
bill, and that they would obviously
enhance the look of the house with
the aluminum siding work we were
going to do.
MASTERS (O.S.)
So, you weren't dangling a free
set of storm windows as a come-on
to selling them the aluminum siding
job? Because it says here, and
I'm reading from a statement from
Mr. Tabaleri...
MOE
(to BB)
What do ya make of all this?
BB
It's the future, Moe... it's the

storm windows were included in the

poked my wife! I gotta come up
with something ingenious...
something ingenious.
Sam sees a WAITER approaching and indicates to Tilley to
get off the subject. Waiter arrives at their table.
SAM

So, what do ya think?
TILLEY
I think I'll take some meatloaf.
WAITER

Meatloaf.
TILLEY
No, I think I'll have some fish.
No, no... fish doesn't fill you

I'm thinking one. Whose one?
SAM
Mr. Motor.
TILLEY
Then that's it, I'm going with one.
SAM
Tilley, this is insane. You're

you're clairvoyant or something.
TILLEY
Sam, I'm

checking
the stats, so why not.
I put my

Third race, I see a six... I see

verdict's in on that one yet.
Tilley stands up and is going through his money and race

You take Thrifty's Delight -- 20

Wing's got a hundred on Night
Fire. What's the odds on Night
Fire?
SAM
Twenty to one.

I don't see Night Fire winning.
Fuck it, I'm not gonna even

The whole idea of being with a
girl on consecutive nights is
new to me. It's one thing when
they're with you for a night,
but when they live with ya, it's

BB
What?! Did we just meet? How
long we been partners? No, I've
never lived with a girl!
MOE
Boy, oh boy! Did you wake up on
the wrong side of the bed today?
BB
Yes, I did. I came in
last night,
she was sleeping on my side of
the bed. In my life I
never got
out of bed on the left side...
in my life, never from the left.
(beat; he looks
out of the car
window)
I got close once up in the
Catskills. I met this
girl,
Dorian. For a week we
were
together, but it wasn't the
same because she always went to
her room to change and do all
that stuff. She didn't
have

Hard to explain... very hard.
NORA
Well, try.

As an example... I came home
last night, I get undressed, and
I realize you're sleeping on my

slept on that side... it's
something I've always done.
NORA
Then why didn't you just nudge
me a bit and tell me to go and
sleep on the other side?

the side of your house... that's
how confident I feel.
SHUBNER
You think that many people are
going to...
MOE
(interrupting
Shubner)
I'm certain of it. I'm not giving
away four hundred dollars for my
health... I'm a businessman, and
I'm a good businessman. This is
good business for me. I'm giving
it away 'cos I believe in this
house, believe that it will refer
me to other jobs which means money
in my pocket, which means money in
your pocket.
SHUBNER
You got a deal, Mr. Gable.
BB smiles.
Suddenly Moe winces in pain.

Something wrong, sir?
Moe collapses to the floor.

MOE
Did they sign?
Did they sign?
BB
Don't worry about it now.
MOE
Goddamn it, BB! Did you sign

BB
Don't worry... don't worry.
I'll
take care of it tomorrow.
MOE
Goddamn, my chest hurts.
(beat)
I always taught you, BB, never
walk out of a place without a
signed contract. Somebody's

They'll sign, Moe.

TILLEY
No way! He's a pig! He always
eats more than anyone else. Why
should I pay for his food?
MOUSE
What're you talking about?
Today I happened to have eggs and
flapjacks, some cantalope, some
juice and then another juice.
TILLEY
Like an animal! Like an animal!
MOUSE
But yesterday, what did I have?
TILLEY
What did he have?
(turning to Sam)
Sam, what did he have?
SAM
Let me get out my notebook. How
the fuck do I know what he had?
TILLEY
Well I don't remember what he
had. Gil, what did he have?

Pancakes?

TILLEY
He said he didn't have pancakes.

TILLEY
I don't give a shit.

French toast.
There's a KNOCK at the window of the diner.
TILLEY
French toast?
He had more than
French toast.

Nora and Tilley are sitting alone at a table drinking

TILLEY
Was not long ago you never would

NORA
You don't have to tell me. How
many nights did you drop me off
and come up here all the time?
TILLEY
I know. I was just trying to
be congenial... you know, start
a conversation off, on a nice
kind of light level, you know.
So, what's the scoop, Nora?
NORA
Well you know, I think we really
should get divorced.
TILLEY
Makes sense.
You want some more
coffee?
NORA
Yeah, I'll have some.

TILLEY
So you like this guy?
NORA
Yeah, I like him.
TILLEY
All in all I guess it'll all work
out for the best.
NORA
I'm glad you feel that way.
TILLEY
Yeah, can you figure it out? A
guy bangs into my car, thinks I
did him in, tries to get even with
me by stealing my wife, you two
people fall in love... can you
figure that out?
NORA
What?
TILLEY
You telling me you didn't know
this was the guy?

at the end of the week for some
sun and fun. Let Stanley work
with you, and when I get back,
we'll see how Moe's doing.
BB
I don't know. To be honest with
you, I think I'd rather work alone
... he's too green. Is he a pain
in the ass?
LOONEY
No. He don't talk much; he's a
good listener, so he can't really

trusted JUKEBOX, belting out his favorite Harry Belafonte
song. In b.g.:
TILLEY

Why can't they get rid of that
fucking record? It's not a hit

TILLEY

Yes, sir... yes, sir!

He comes out of the back room into the pool hall, and
walks over to the table where Tilley and Gil are playing
pool. He drops an open envelope onto the pool table.
SAM
(to Tilley)
Take a look at this crap.
TILLEY
IRS? They're not gonna leave me
alone!
SAM
Home Improvement Commission.
With those words there's a genuine moment of concern from
all of the tin men -- even Mouse stops singing. Tilley
picks up the envelope and pulls out the letter.
TILLEY
We've got to appear?
SAM
I think that's the gist of what
they're saying.

What the hell's going on here?
I'm just this guy. What's the
big deal? They can't get along
without me? The government can't
operate unless they've got Tilley's
money... the Commission's after
my job! This shit's driving me
insane! All the lying, thieving,
stealing corporations in this

Harry Apel... Dandy Flynn... those

burned themselves out too fast.
Best? Moe's the best... the best

closer ever.

the refrigerator in the kitchen of his home. He is
putting eggs and rotten tomatoes from the refrigerator
into a bowl. He looks at a piece of celery, but it's
so wilted and has no strength for his purpose that he
throws it down. He picks up other vegetables, but
settles for the eggs and tomatoes. He closes the re-
frigerator door and makes his way to the living room.
We see BB lying on the floor, unconscious. Tilley sits
down across from him with the bowl in his lap... he
watches BB. BB starts to come to.

makes no sense...
POLICE OFFICER

Let's get it down right. The guy
broke into your house, you hit him
in the head with a gun, went to
the refrigerator, took out eggs
and tomatoes and threw them at
him.
TILLEY
I was defending myself... he was
stealing from me.
POLICE OFFICER
It doesn't sound like defense to
me.
TILLEY
I wanted to humiliate the guy.
Here I am, out busting my ass all
day making a decent living, I come
home, and some schmuck is trying
to steal from me.
POLICE OFFICER
So you hit him with a gun, and
pelted him with eggs and tomatoes?
TILLEY
If I had some soup I would have
thrown soup at him... is there
any law you can't throw eggs?

TILLEY
On second thought, instead of the

boiled eggs do you take them out
of the shell or leave them in the
shells?
We can see that BB is getting a little irritable.
WAITRESS
We leave them in the shell.
TILLEY
I don't like them that way because
they get hot in the hand and it's
hard to scoop the stuff out...
it's not good... and you get
little bits of shell in there and
it doesn't taste good.
BB
Why don't you just order some
scrambled eggs and be done with
it... all right?
TILLEY
If I'm going to order, at least I
ought to be content with my food.
BB
I'm getting a little hungry...
I've got a headache as it is.
Just order some eggs so some other

MOE
A lot of good times, but I can't

You know, my brother-in-law has
offered me a job at Hess Shoes.
I think maybe I should do it. You

manager.
BB
That's it, Moe? You're gonna
spend the day measuring people's
feet? 'You're an "E" fit...
you're a "D" wide... you got a
high arch... I'll show you

Sam is driving and Tilley is in the passenger seat.
SAM
You know, when I saw 'Bonanza' the
other day, something occurred to
me. There's those three guys
living on the Ponderosa and you
never hear them say anything about
wanting to get laid. You never
hear Hoss turn to Little Joe and
say 'I had such a hard-on when I
woke up this morning.' You know
... they never talk about broads
... nothing. Ya never hear Little
Joe say 'Hey, Hoss, I went into
Virginia City and saw a girl with
the greatest ass I ever saw in my
life.' Ya just see 'em walking
around the Ponderosa saying, 'Yes,
Pa,' and 'Where's Little Joe?'
Nothing about broads. I don't
think I'm being too picky... at
least once if they talked about
getting horny. I don't care if
you're living on the Ponderosa or
right here in Baltimore, guys talk
about getting laid.

I'm beginning to think that show
doesn't have too much realism.

The Home Improvement Commission is in session. Tilley
and Sam sit at the defense table. Masters presides over
the commission table where four or five other commis-
sioners sit.
MASTERS
(into microphone
to Tilley & Sam)
Didn't you approach Mr. Boloshevski
August 18, 1961, while he was
cutting his front lawn and tell
him that his house had been
selected, as one of only 16 homes
in the state of Maryland, for a
free aluminum siding job?
TILLEY
What's the name again?
MASTERS
Boloshevski.
TILLEY
Doesn't ring a bell.
(to Sam)
Sam, does it ring a bell to you?
SAM
(leans into microphone)
It doesn't ring a bell to me either,
sir.
MASTERS
Didn't you suggest that for a
nominal labor charge, he would
receive over five thousand dollars'
worth of aluminum siding?
(CONTINUED)
118.
125
CONTINUED:
125
TILLEY
That's an awful lot for nothing.
Doesn't sound like good business
to me.
MASTERS
Mr. Boloshevski was ultimately
charged twenty-four hundred
dollars for labor, which according
to our figures is about the average
cost of an aluminum siding job.
SAM
(leans into the
microphone)
I don't get the point of this.
MASTERS
Twenty-four hundred dollars that
you charged for labor, is the same
as if Mr. Boloshevski had purchased
the aluminum siding and had the
labor done.
TILLEY
Maybe I'm missing the point here,
but if he paid twenty-four hundred,
which is the cost of the job, I
can't see anything wrong with that.
I don't know the guy, but I don't
quite get the problem.
MASTERS
What we're getting at here... what
we're trying to stress, is that
the job was sold under false
terms. The man didn't win any
award... he was not getting
aluminum siding at a special price.
A clear case of deception was
involved here.
TILLEY
(to Sam)
What's he talking about? The man
got the job for twenty-four hundred
dollars, and that's what it costs
in aluminum siding.

TILLEY (CONT'D)
(leans into

Um... I don't know... we have no
recollection of this particular
job, but I don't know if this is
deception. Look, if you work in a
clothing store, some guy tries on
a suit, it looks like shit, but
you tell him it looks wonderful.
The guy's standing there looking
like a sack of shit, the salesman
says what a great suit and the man
buys it. That's deception as far
as I can see, but I don't
understand the deceptiveness that
you say we're responsible for...
if I make myself clear.
SAM
(leaning into
the microphone)
I'd go along with that as well.
MASTERS
What we're trying to establish
are the principles that have been
laid down as part of the Home
Improvement code of ethics...
that you cannot mislead someone
intentionally, and I think that's
the principle that applies to this.
TILLEY
Did somebody put a gun to this
guy's head and make him spend
twenty-four hundred dollars? I
don't get the point here. I
don't know the specifics of this
case, not being privy to all the
information, but all I can say is
this guy got a fair price for a
fair job.
Another commissioner, BUD DELANEY, takes the microphone.
DELANEY

Do you know Mr. and Mrs. Rayburn
of 156 Aberdeen Avenue, Essex?

TILLEY

and shrugs his
shoulders; then

I think you'd have to familiarize
me.
DELANEY
The couple purchased twenty-eight
hundred dollars' worth of aluminum
siding and the two of you were the
salesmen on record. They say, and
I quote here, 'that they would
have received one hundred and
fifty dollars per home for every
person in the neighborhood who
saw their house and decided to
buy aluminum siding.'
(looking up from
paper)
Is that true?
TILLEY
It sounds right.
DELANEY
Are you aware that, according to
the Home Improvement code, you
are not allowed to exceed a
twenty dollar limit in
incentives?
TILLEY
(shrugs his shoulders)
We wanted to be a little more
generous, that's all.
DELANEY
The couple said that they never
did receive any money from any
other jobs, as you had promised.
SAM
(leaning into
microphone)
We didn't get any leads from them.
Their house was not the showplace
that we thought it would be. It
didn't generate the activity that
we had hoped.

TILLEY
(interrupting)
But should a referral turn up in
the community, we'd be more than
happy to give them twenty dollars
instead of the hundred and fifty.
MASTERS
(leaning into
microphone)
Excuse us for one moment.
He then leans over to Delaney, and they start to confer.
Tilley and Sam watch, wondering what's going on. Masters
leans in the other direction, holding his hand over the
microphone, and he talks to the other commissioners.
They nod in approval, then Masters leans back into the
microphone.
MASTERS
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
Should there be a reason in the
future to call you back, we would
like to reserve that right.

Ya know, Tilley, we been working

TILLEY
Yeah, must be about that.

I've been thinking that sometimes
a different combination makes for
better luck. Ya know what I mean?
I mean, maybe the two of us ain't

SAM
Let's face it, we're not exactly

You know something, Stanley, I

STANLEY
Well, we just started out, and if
we had some really good hard facts
of some infractions, it would give
us a lot of credibility in the
community.
BB walks closer to Stanley, looks at him for a second,
grabs him by his tie and pushes him backwards. Stanley
crashes into the filing cabinet.
BB
You know what your big problem

you want to find out stuff, then
you dig... you get on the phone...
you canvas... 'We're from the
Home Improvement Commission...'
Go find your leads... that's what
we do all the time. You're just
lazy, Stanley. If we're doing
something wrong, you should
collect all your evidence.
Instead, you snoop around...
steal files. What is this?
Undercover time? You think
you're breaking up some big drug
ring? Is this the Mafia you've
infiltrated? All you've got here
is a bunch of guys selling tin

He eyes the eight ball carefully. Tilley's nervous. A
couple of the tin men make private side bets whether the
ball goes or doesn't. BB lines up the shot; he shoots,

this right?
WING
I'm up front with you about this...
I'm up front with ya, Tilley.
I've got my balls in a vice...
what am I gonna do?
TILLEY
Is this about the money I owe
you? Are you just pissed? You
want to get even because of the
horse race? I told ya it was an
accident.
WING
Tilley, it's got nothing to do
with the money.
TILLEY
You're selling me out? You're
gonna let them bury me? Jesus
Christ, Wing... Jesus Christ!
I'm not gonna be able to work in
this business? Wing, this was
my chosen field!
WING
Masters was gonna take this
company apart. You're the low man
on the totem pole, Tilley. There's
a lot of guys earning a good

He takes out his wallet from his pocket, and peels off
a few notes.
WING
Here's a thou until you get
yourself set up. I can do no
better than that.
TILLEY

money)
You'd sell me out for a lousy
three thousand dollars? Three
thousand dollars and I got to go
down the toilet? Jesus Christ,
Wing, how long the two of us
been busting our asses together
... Jesus Christ! We got some
history to this relationship for
Christ sake. Masters puts a
little squeeze on you, you just
sell out. Three thousand
dollars?!
WING
The bottom line is, I'm running
a business, Tilley.
(he peels off another
couple of hundred
dollars from his
wallet)
Here's another deuce. I carried
you a long time, Tilley. I've
done a damn sight more than a

things like this and casually eat
your eggs?! What does this mean,

Well, I'm supposed to give you
up as part of honoring that
agreement, but I'm not that
honorable a guy.
He smiles, takes a quick sip of his coffee.

261?

MASTERS (O.S.)
Was it the heat of the sales pitch
on February 23rd of this year that
made you write across a contract
'This Job Is Free'?
ON TILLEY
who is falling apart.
TILLEY
As I remember, no sale was made
concerning those customers.
MASTERS
It fell out because a loan couldn't
be arranged, but the people did
agree in principle.
(beat)
The point that we'd like to stress,
is that you misled these people.
Told them the job was free. Then
you sent in your closer with some
cover story about how you had
suffered a nervous breakdown, and
a sale was ultimately made for
twenty-three hundred and seventy-
seven dollars. That is misleading
and deceptive sales practice.
TILLEY
It was
temporary insanity. I
don't
know... it just came over me
... it
might have been something
I ate.
I don't know... it was

We have other specific examples of
deceptive sales practices on your
behalf concerning a job carried
out on December 11, 1962. You
violated sections 241 and 247.
And concerning a job sold to Mr.
and Mrs. DeFranco on October 9,
1962, violations of sections 251
and 257 took place.

What are all these numbers here?
I'm not familiar with all these
section violations.

that these infractions are severe
violations of the Home Improvement
Laws, and therefore constitute
misuse of the license to sell
aluminum siding as approved by this
state.

It is the decision of this
commission to revoke your license
