        The U.S.S. Enterprise NCC 1701-D traveling at warp speed 
        through space. 

                PICARD V.O. 
            Captain's log, stardate 42353.7. 
            Our destination is planet Cygnus 
            IV, beyond which lies the great 
            unexplored mass of the galaxy. 

      2    OTHER INTRODUCTORY ANGLES (OPTICAL) 

        on the gigantic new Enterprise NCC 1701-D. 

                PICARD V.O. 
            My orders are to examine Farpoint, 
            a starbase built there by the 
            inhabitants of that world. 
            Meanwhile ... 


        Emphasizing the incredibly SHINING GRID which the 
        Enterprise is approaching. Seeming impossibly large, 
        yet in some ways as delicate as a spiderweb, it is 
        composed of interlocking geometrical shapes. 


        Appropriate THEME MUSIC with spaceship hanging 
        motionless, still facing the mysterious SHIMMERING GRID 
        that stretches in front of it from galaxy horizon to 
        horizon. 

      16   INTO. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING CONN'S FORM 

        In the b.g. on a floating stretcher Conn is being taken 
        to the turbolift, advanced medical emergency aids are 
        attached to his body. 

                PICARD 
            Is he still alive? 

                MEDIC 
            For now. We'll do our best, sir. 

      17   EMPHASIZING "Q" (OPTICAL) 

        Ignoring the previous, intent instead on inspecting his 
        Elizabethan costume as Picard comes up to him. 

                "Q" (ELIZABETHAN) 
            Your little centuries go by so 
            rapidly, Captain. Perhaps you'll 
            understand this better. 

        The Visitor moves his hand slightly. We hear the same 
        ROLLING THUNDER SOUND. Another BLINDING LIGHT FLASH 
        and his body remains the same humanoid face and figure 
        as with the Elizabethan dress, but now the green 
        officer's uniform of the U.S. Marine Corps. Over his 
        jacket pocket three rows of medals and his narrow 
        garrison cap shows the bars of a Captain. 

                "Q" (MARINE CAPTAIN) 
            Actually, the issue at stake is 
            patriotism. You must return to 
            your world and put an end to the 
            communists. All it takes is a 
            few good men. 

                PICARD 
            What? That nonsense is centuries 
            behind us!       17   CONTINUED: 

                "Q" (MARINE CAPTAIN) 
            But you can't deny Captain, that 
            you're still a dangerous, savage 
            child-race. 

                PICARD 
            Most certainly I deny it. I agree 
            that we still were when ... 
              (indicating) 
            ... humans wore costumes like that 
            four hundred years ago... 

                "Q" (MARINE CAPTAIN) 
            At which time you slaughtered 
            millions in silly arguments about 
            how to divide the resources of 
            your little world. And four 
            hundred years before that you were 
            murdering each other in quarrels 
            over tribal god-images. And since 
            there have been no indications 
            that humans will ever change 
            ..... 

                PICARD 
            But even as far back as... ! 
              (indicates) 
            ... that costume, we had begun to 
            make rapid progress. 

                "Q" (MARINE CAPTAIN) 
            Oh? Shall we review your "rapid 
            progress"? 

      18   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) 

        The "Q" visitor moves a hand again to create THE SAME 
        SOUNDS and the SAME BLINDING FLASH, producing the same 
        human image but this time unshaven and with an UGLY 
        AUTOMATION LOOK AND IN THE UNIFORM OF A MILITARY OFFICER 
        FROM THE MID 21st CENTURY WARS. Q's voice sounds a bit 
        drugged now as he eyes his new costume. 

                "Q" (21ST CENTURY) 
              (interrupting) 
            Rapid progress to where humans 
            learned to control their military 
            with drugs. 

      19   ANGLE INCLUDING OPS POSITION 

        As Worf gets a message and turns toward Picard.       19   CONTINUED: 

                WORF 
            Sir, sickbay reports that 
            Lieutenant Graham's condition is 
            better. 

        All have turned toward Worf, showing relief. 

                "Q" (21ST CENTURY) 
            Concern for one's comrade. How 
            touching. 

                WORF 
              (indicates "Q") 
            And now, sir, a personal request. 
            Permission to clean up the bridge? 

        Picard shakes head, stares Worf down when he seems about 
        to protest. Meanwhile Tasha has come to her feet too: 
 
                TASHA 
            Lieutenant Worf is right, sir. 
            As Security Chief I can't just 
            stand here and .... 

                PICARD 
            Yes, you can, Tasha. 

        During this, "Q" has withdrawn a slender tube attached 
        to his 21st Century uniform, makes an adjustment which 
        lets a round pill roll into his mouth and bites down 
        on it with a "POP" SOUND. 

                "Q" (21ST CENTURY) 
            Ah, yes... better! 
              (deep breath, feeling 
               it) 
            Then later, on finally reaching 
            deep space, humans of course found 
            enemies to fight out there too. 
            And to broaden those struggles.... 
              (indicating Worf and 
               Tasha) 
            .... you again found allies to 
            permit still more murdering and 
            all over again the same old story.  
      19   CONTINUED: (2) 

                PICARD 
              (interrupting; angry) 
            No! The most dangerous 'same old 
            story' is the one we're meeting 
            now! Those who go on 
            misinformation, half-information, 
            self-righteous life forms who are 
            eager not to learn but to 
            prosecute, to judge anything they 
            don't understand or can't 
            tolerate. 

                "Q" (21ST CENTURY) 
            What an interesting idea. 
            Prosecute and judge? 

        CAMERA CENTERS ON "Q" as he absorbs what Picard has 
        said. He takes a step or two, turns. 

                "Q" (21ST CENTURY) 
              (continuing) 
            And suppose it turns out we 
            understand you humans only too 
            well? 

                PICARD 
            We've no fear of what the true 
            facts about us will reveal. 

                "Q" (21ST CENTURY) 
            The facts about you? Splendid, 
            splendid! You are a veritable 
            fountain of good ideas. 
              (smiling; pleasant) 
            There are preparations to make, 
            Captain, but when I return... 

        "Q" gives a 21st Century salute to Picard. 

                "Q" (21ST CENTURY) 
              (continuing) 
            ... we will proceed exactly as you 
            suggest! 

        A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT and the alien visitor is gone. 
 
      20   WIDE ANGLE ON BRIDGE 

        It takes a moment to accept the fact "Q" is really gone 
        then Worf turns to Picard.       20   CONTINUED: 

                WORF 
            Sir... respectfully submit our only 
            choice is to fight. If we 
            Klingons understand anything, it 
            is the meaning of that kind of 
            talk. 

                TASHA 
            My sentiments too, sir. Fight or 
            try to escape. 

      21   ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD 

        Turning to Troi: 

                PICARD 
            Sense anything, Commander? 

                TROI 
              (shakes head) 
            Its mind is much too powerful, 
            sir. And frightening. Concur we 
            avoid further contact if possible! 

      22   ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD 

        Clearly he has to come up with something. He reflects 
        for a moment more, then makes up his mind, turns to 
        Troi. 

                PICARD 
            From this point, no station 
            aboard, repeat no station, for 
            any reason will make use of 
            signals, transmission or intercom. 
              (crossing quickly to 
               Ops and Conn) 
            We'll try to take them by 
            surprise. 
              (to Worf) 
            Inform engineering to make ready 
            for maximum acceleration. We'll 
            find out what this Galaxy Class 
            can do. 

                WORF 
            Aye, sir. 

        As Worf stands and hurries off, Picard turns to Data. 
       22   CONTINUED: 

                PICARD 
            Records search, Data. Results 
            of detaching the Saucer Section 
            at high warp speeds. 

        Data quickly draws on his memory. 

                DATA 
            Inadvisable at any warp speed, 
            sir. 

                PICARD 
            Search theoretical. 

                DATA 
              (thinking; then) 
            It is possible, sir. But 
            absolutely no error margin. 

        Picard nods and stands, RAISES VOICE: 

                PICARD 
            Attention bridge crew! 

      23   VARIOUS ANGLES 

        Picard waits until all are turned toward him. 

                PICARD 
              (continuing) 
            Using print-out only, notify all 
            decks to prepare for maximum 
            acceleration. Maximum, you're 
            entitled to know, means we'll be 
            pushing our engines well past 
            safety limits. Our hope is to 
            surprise whatever that is out 
            there, try to outrun it. 
              (looks around, then) 
            Our only other option would be 
            to put tail between our legs and 
            return to Earth as they demand. 


        Showing both the Enterprise and the mysterious grid. 
 

        Suddenly into maximum warp, the energy release 
        momentarily DISTORTING BOTH THE ALIEN GRID AND THE STARS 
        IN SIGHT AROUND IT. When the EFFECT is over, the 
        starship has turned, seeming to almost brush against 
        the mysterious grid, and is then racing away from it. 
       29   ANGLE EMPHASIZING GRID (OPTICAL) 

        With Enterprise in b.g. at warp speed, escaping. Then 
        the 'grid' suddenly shrinks in size, growing brighter 
        as it coalesces together INTO THE SHAPE OF A BRIGHTLY 
        COLORED SPINNING SHAPE which now races after the 
        Enterprise. 


        Still at high warp. We cannot see the image of the 
        following "hostile" (which is not magnified in this 
        ANGLE). 

                PICARD V.O. 
            Captain's log, stardate 42354.1. 
            Preparing to detach saucer 
            section. 


        Traveling through space for a moment, then photon 
        torpedoes blasting out of the starship's aft tubes. 
        The torpedo pattern disappears into the distance behind 
        the vessel. 

 
        As we see the largest of the assemblies begin to move, 
        yawning open. Other mechanisms are doing their jobs 
        too.... and THE MONOLITHIC STARSHIP DIVIDES INTO ITS TWO 
        SECTIONS.... STARDRIVE AND SAUCER MOVING APART. 

                PICARD V.O. 
            Ship's log, exact moment of 
            separation, stardate 42354.22. 

        As the Stardrive Section gets safely clear of the 
        saucer, it begins turning, doubling back to face the 
        "Q" menace. And now in the direction of that threat, 
        we begin to see PHOTON EXPLOSIONS in the far, far 

        As the HOSTILE IMAGE rushes down on the starship, THE 
        COALESCENT SHAPE OPENING UP INTO SOMETHING LIKE THE 
        SHIMMERING GRID WE'VE SEEN, but now as if to enclose 
        (and perhaps crush) the starship. A FURY OF SOUNDS like 
        CLANKING-SCREAMS OF METAL BEING STRESSED BEYOND ITS 
        LIMITS. 


        moving in on a yellowish ball of a planet glowing 
        against the black backdrop of starry space in the 
        reflected light of its sun. There is some cloud layer. 
        At this distance, the planet's land masses are vague 
        and indistinct.

            Riker, Star Date 42354.4, at 
            Farpoint Station. 

      66   CLOSER - ON THE PLANETS AND THE USS HOOD (OPTICAL) 
 
        An older class starship (the USS Hood) lies in 
        geosynchronous orbit above the planet. 

                RIKER'S VOICE 
            ... U.S.S. Hood has dropped me 
            off at Farpoint Station where I 
            await the arrival of the new 
            U.S.S. Enterprise... 

      67   CLOSER - ON THE OLD CITY/STATION (SPEC.FX) 

        AN AERIAL VIEW of the small, obviously old Bandi city 
        connected to the modern sprawling spaceport/station, 
        both set in the middle of a harsh and forbidding 
        landscape. This is Farpoint Station. CAMERA PUSHES 
        IN on the Old City portion.       67   CONTINUED: 

                RIKER'S VOICE 
            ... to which I have been assigned 
            as first officer. Meanwhile... 


        The Enterprise stardrive module in orbit of the Farpoint 
        planet. 

 
        As before, the Saucer Section is above and ahead of the 
        battle section. The battle section is SLOWLY moving 
        ahead toward the Saucer Section for link-up. 

 
        The battle section is seen rising, angling forward 
        slightly, still moving slowly toward the saucer. 

 
        The two are level now, quite close together, the battle 
        section still moving slowly forward. 

 
        The two glide together smoothly. 


        The reverse of disconnecting SHOTS we saw earlier -- 
        huge STARDRIVE SECTION and SAUCER MODULE MECHANISMS 
        MAKING FINAL HOOK-UP. 


        The docking complete. 


        Both the Enterprise and the Hood in orbit close 
        together. CAMERA ANGLE shows how much LARGER the 
        Enterprise is. 

 
        Again, EMPHASIZING the considerable difference in the 
        sizes of the two starships as we SEE that the USS Hood 
        is PULLING AWAY, LEAVING ORBIT. 


        U.S.S. Enterprise in orbit of planet Cygnus IV. 

                PICARD V.O. 
            Captain's log, stardate 42372.5. 
            Of the twenty-four hours "Q" 
            allotted us to prove ourselves... 


        ESTABLISHING SHOT as: 

                PICARD'S VOICE 
            My crew and I need a bit more 
            information... 


        The U.S.S. Enterprise still in orbit over Cygnus IV. 
 

        The Parkland hidden at this moment by a WILD SECTION 
        OF CORRIDOR WALL AND HATCHWAY which, when the hatch is 
        opened, will REVEAL PARKLAND. 

                COMPUTER VOICE 
              (continuing without 
               delay) 
            And if you care to enter, 
            Commander... 

                RIKER 
              (snaps; interrupting) 
            I do. 

        Immediately, the hatch slides open and we SEE THE 
        PARKLAND (LOCATION). It looks (and is) real, including 
        land contours, trees, and even a small stream nearby. 
        Beyond that the Parkland stretches off for what appears 
        to be miles and miles away to the horizon. 

      134  ANGLE BACK TOWARD HATCHWAY 

        As Riker ENTERS through it and stands inspecting the 
        Parkland scene with genuine appreciation and then HEARS 
        SOMEONE WHISTLING A MELODY, but doing it rather badly 
        and laboriously.       135  ANGLE PAST RIKER INTO PARKLAND 

        As he MOVES AWAY, seeking the source of the WHISTLING 
        which will begin to grow LOUDER now. 

      136  ANGLE AT STREAM 

        As Riker crosses, stepping from rock to rock. He makes 
        a misstep, almost falls, then recovers and gets across. 
        He looks back at the stone which caused it. 

      137  CLOSER ON RIKER 

        As he walks, the WHISTLING is nearby now. He stops, 
        calls: 

                RIKER 
            Hello! 

        The WHISTLING has continued without pause, Riker cocks 
        his ear, corrects his direction slightly. 


        Riker ENTERS SHOT through shrubbery, sees something and 
        stops. 

      139  ANGLE ON DATA 

        Lying there, cushioned by deep grass. He's totally 
        absorbed in certain melody notes he's attempting -- and 
        keeps missing. 

      140  PANNING RIKER 

        Moving onto TWO SHOT where he stops, and WHISTLES the 
        same melody, hitting the correct notes. A startled Data 
        looks up blankly, then comes quickly to his feet, but 
        Riker waves him back down, sits beside him. 

                DATA 
            Marvelous how easily humans do 
            that, sir. I still need much 
            practice. 

        Riker, acting uncomfortable, avoids the subject. He 
        hesitates, then: 

                RIKER 
            There are some puzzles down on 
            the planet that Captain Picard 
            wants answered. He suggests I 
            put you on the away team I'll be 
            using.       140  CONTINUED: 

                DATA 
            I shall endeavor to give 
            satisfaction, sir. 

        Riker hesitates, wanting to say something but not sure 
        how to begin. 

                RIKER 
            Uh, yes. And when the captain 
            suggested you I, uh, looked up 
            your record... 
              (hesitates) 

                DATA 
            Yes sir, a wise procedure always. 

                RIKER 
            Your rank of lieutenant commander, 
            I assume now must be honorary. 

                DATA 
            No, sir. Starfleet Class of '78; 
            honors in quantum mathematics 
            and exobiology. 

                RIKER 
            But your files... they say you're 
            a... 

                DATA 
              (waits, then) 
            Machine? Correct, sir. Does that 
            trouble you? 

                RIKER 
              (hesitates) 
            To be honest... yes, a little. 

                DATA 
            Understood, sir. Prejudice is 
            very human. 

                RIKER 
            Now that troubles me. Do you 
            consider yourself superior to us? 

                DATA 
            I am superior in many ways. But 
            I would gladly give it up to be 
            human. 

                RIKER 
              (studies Data, then) 
            Nice to meet you, Pinocchio,       140  CONTINUED: (2) 

        Data seems confused by this. 

                RIKER 
              (continuing; explains) 
            A joke. 

                DATA 
              (straight-faced) 
            Ah! Intriguing. 

                RIKER 
              (big grin) 
            You're going to be an interesting 
            companion, Mister Data. 

                        FADE OUT.                                 PART SEVEN                             
 
        FADE IN: 


        We HEAR A VOICE (Wesley) and Riker gets to his feet, 
        looks off in that direction. 

                DATA 
            This pattern is quite popular, 
            sir. Perhaps because it 
            duplicates Earth so well, Coming 
            here, 
              (apologetically) 
            makes me feel as if I'm human too. 

                RIKER 
              (taking it all in) 
            I didn't believe these could be 
            so real. 

                DATA 
            Much of it is real, sir. If the 
            transporters can convert our 
            bodies to an energy beam, then 
            back to the original pattern 
            again... 

                RIKER 
            Yes, of course. 
              (indicates) 
            And all these have much simpler 
            patterns. 


        Data leading the way, then indicates. 

                DATA 
            The rear wall. 

                RIKER 
              (peers) 
            I can't see it. 

                DATA 
            You will. 

        PANNING RIKER TOWARD US 

        He's squinting hard now. Then he stops, reacts at 
        something he can now make out. 

                RIKER 

        Where, of course, the wall blend is no longer visible. 
 
                WESLEY'S VOICE 
              (calling) 
            Mister Riker, isn't this great? 

        MEDIUM ON RIKER 

        Turning, then grinning, waving. 

        RIKER'S P.O.V. - THE ROCK CROSSING AT STREAM 

        Where Wes Crusher is hurrying toward us, bouncing from 
        rock to rock. 

                WESLEY 
            This is one of the simpler 
            patterns, Mister Riker. They've 
            got thousands more, some you just 
            can't believe. 

        ANGLE TO INCLUDE RIKER AND DATA 

        Moving down the stream. 

                RIKER 
            Careful, that next rock is 
            loose... ! 

        WIDER ANGLE 

        As that rock moves underfoot, tumbling Wes into the 
        stream. 

        PANNING DATA IN, demonstrating his enormous strength 
        as he easily lifts Wesley completely out of the water. 
        An amazed Wesley looks at Data. 

                WESLEY 
 
        As the hatchway smoothly SLIDES OPEN AGAIN. Through 
        it is REVEALED THE PARKLAND, through which Riker, Data 
        and a very wet Wesley make their way to the HATCHWAY. 
        As they MOVE THROUGH HATCHWAY, the bulkhead BEGINS 
        CLOSING. 

 

        As before, in geosynchronous orbit. 


        The Enterprise in orbit. 

 
        The mystery vessel approaches and settles into 
        geosynchronous orbit. It is positioned slightly above 
        and to the side of the Enterprise -- and it is a great 
        deal larger than the Enterprise. Suddenly, A GLOWING 
        PULSE OF LIGHT throbs out from the mystery vessel toward 
        the Enterprise. 

 
        The mystery vessel clearly larger than the Enterprise 
        and moving near it in orbit. 

 
        As another phaser-like BEAM STRIKES DOWN AT THE PLANET. 
 

        Rather than being nervous over the arrival of "Q" 
        (JUDGE), Picard has become coldly angry. 

                PICARD 
            Get off my bridge! 

      196  ANOTHER ANGLE 

        "Q" stepping toward Picard, smiling sadly. 

                "Q" (JUDGE) 
            Also interesting, that order about 
            phasers. 

                TASHA 
              (ignoring "Q"; to 
               Picard) 
            Still standing by on phasers, 
            Captain. 

                "Q" (JUDGE) 
              (turning to Picard) 
            Please don't let me interfere. 
            Use your weapons. 

                PICARD 
            You're the one who has a lot to 
            learn, "Q". With no idea of who's 
            on that vessel, my order was a 
            routine safety precaution. 

                "Q" (JUDGE) 
              (breaking into LAUGHTER) 
            Really? No idea of what it 
            represents? The meaning of that 
            vessel is as plain as... 
              (then taps his nose) 
            ... as plain as the noses on your 
            ugly little primate faces.       196  CONTINUED: 

        LOUDER LAUGHTER. 

                "Q" (JUDGE) 
              (trying to control it) 
            And if you were truly civilized, 
            Captain, wouldn't you be doing 
            something about the casualties 
            happening down there? 

        In answer, Picard touches the communications control on 
        his uniform. 

                PICARD 
            Captain to CMO, are you reading 
            any of this? 

 
        In orbit over the planet. 


        Enterprise and the mystery vessel still in orbit. 


        HIGH DOWNWARD SHOT SHOWING THE ENERGY BEAM terminating 
        and being absorbed into Farpoint Station. 


        The city/station miniature -- the Farpoint Station part 
        of it GROWING SOFT, SHIMMERING, SLOWLY BECOMES A 
        CREATURE OF GOSSAMER, FEATHERY LIGHTNESS -- now 
        gracefully rising up from its captivity. 

      239  ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) 

        Where what was once the "mystery vessel" but now an 
        increasingly beautiful COLORFUL, FEATHERY TENDRIL SHAPE 
        is descending closer and closer to what was once the 
        Farpoint Station part of city/station (miniature).

        THE TWO CREATURES (OPTICAL) 

        The smaller one rising up toward its mate. They touch 
        -- delicate matter/energy tendrils twining -- and then 
        together they move upwards out of sight.
