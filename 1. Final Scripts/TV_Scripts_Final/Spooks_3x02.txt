      Tom walks along a corridor in the block of flats.

      We see the block of flats from a low angle.

      Graduates have just received their degrees.  They and their 

      families are milling around the Clock quadrangle.  It is a 
      very happy occasion.  The parents are dressed up, the 
      graduates are in gowns.  Champagne is being popped, plastic

      One family in particular is very happy.  PROFESSOR FREDERICK 
      ROBERTS and his wife HELEN are with their oldest daughter,

      Liz is in a very London phase.  The girls flirt with their 
      father outrageously.  He loves it.

                    I did.  I was a young M.I.5 
                    Officer.  You were the first 
                    sleeper I recruited.  

                                  FRED
                    But I never heard from you again  
                    ...

                                  HARRY
                    We never contact sleepers until we 
                    wake them.

                                  FRED
                    No. No.  Whatever it is you want me 
                    to do, no.  My life s set.   

                                  HARRY
                    Nobel Prize winner? But did you 
                    really deserve it?

      Fred looks at him, shocked.  Harry sails on.

                                  FRED
                    What the hell are you suggesting?

                                  HARRY
                    The work that won you the Nobel?  
                    Your discovery of the chemical 
                    imbalance between neurons in the 
                    brain?   The basic research for 
                    that came from nerve gas 
                      experiments at Porton Down.  Which 
                    we made sure you were given.


      Fred is struggling to come to terms with this enormity about 
      his life.

                                  FRED 
                    Are you saying M.I.5 manufactured

      INT. THE ROBERTS  FAMILY HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY 1. 1500
44

      A warm family kitchen, with a big refectory table in the 
      middle full of ceramics and clutter. Evidence of preparing 
      party food.

        A television is on. An excited CHILD run passed it ignoring 
      it.  

      ON THE TELEVISION:

      A un-uniformed DEPUTY ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER is standing in 
                                                                                              **
      front of the block destroyed in the explosion, speaking to 
      the camera, giving a press conference.  Reporters surround 
      him.

                                  DEPUTY ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
                                                                                              *
                    All the indications are that the 
                    device exploded at around 8.15 this 
                    morning.  It is believed that two 
                    people perished in the explosion.

                                  REPORTER (O.S.)
                    So this was a bomb?  

                                  DEPUTY ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
                                                                                              *
                    The first indications are  ...  
                    yes.

                                  REPORTER (O.S.)
                    The two dead persons were 
                      terrorists?
                                                                                              *

                                  DEPUTY ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
                                                                                              *
                    Again enquiries are at a very early 
                    stage.  

      THE CAMERA follows the child who runs out toward the living 
      room.

      INT. THE ROBERTS  FAMILY HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - DAY 1. 1501
55

      The same child runs into the living room.  A big room of many 
      colours, books, cushions on fat sofas.  Very comfortable, 
      lived in.  There are plants, pictures.    

      A few guests and the family are going in and out.  It is a 
      very happy party.

      Helen, helping distribute the drink, frowns.  She is looking 
      at Harry and Fred on the balcony.  Harry has a plate of food.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)

      HARRY and FRED talk quietly.  

                                  FRED
                    Course I thought, maybe you ll ask 
                    me to do something.  First I was 
                    prepared for it.  Then as the years 
                    went by   ...  I forgot.  In pity s 
                    name Harry, I retire next year.  

                                  HARRY
                    You re one of the most famous

                    will believe you ve done it.

                                  FRED 
                    Done what?

                                  HARRY
                    Made Red Mercury.

      Fred scoffs.

                                  FRED
                    Red Mercury is a scientific 
                      impossibility.  It doesn t exist!

                                  HARRY
                    There are rumours it does.  

                                  FRED
                    Look I have heard about this stuff 
                    and it s poppycock, science 
                    fiction, right?  It s meant to be 
                    an explosive trigger that can fire 
                    a nuclear reaction in Plutonium.  
                      Incredibly efficient.  

                                  HARRY
                    Why doesn t it work?

                                  FRED
                    It s technical but it s meant to be 
                      a compound of a very high density, 
                    all the electrons stripped off a 
                    mercury atom.  But there s no way 
                    of doing that.
                          (angry)
                    I mean is M.I.5 reading comics or 
                                                                                              *
                    what?  You can t believe this.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                    With pleasure.

      THE CAMERA follows Harry as he walks through the house to the 
      front door, he opens it. Police cars have pulled up in front 
      of the house, police officers get out of their cars and walk 
      towards the house.  Harry points towards the living room 
      where Fred is standing.

      Table.  Recording device.  White walls.  Light from a glass 
      brick window.  Neon strip lighting above.  It s uncomfortably 
      bright.  

      Fred Roberts sits facing the Inspector.  There are two other 
      POLICE OFFICERS in the room.  Fred, more Yorkshire under 
      tension.  His throat is dry.

                                  FRED

                    An explosion took place yesterday 
                    in Mortimer Street, EC22.  We

                    That s just the  top  story.  For

                                  FRED
                    So no one died.  It s a big lie.

                                  DANNY
                    No the big lie is the  bottom  
                    story, which we put out as a rumour 
                    - left wing magazines, the net.  

      Fred rallies.

                                  FRED
                    So there s a false story on top, 
                    which people won t believe, then 
                      underneath there s another false 
                    story, which people will think is 
                    true.

                                  DANNY
                    Right.

      ON THE LAPTOP SCREEN:

      A video clip begins of MEN armed and in radiation protection 
      suits breaking into the back of the house.

      The protected men rushing down narrow stairs into a basement.  
      A shaft of light from a high narrow window.  It has been a 
      workshop: there is a metal-working jig on a bench.  One of

      DANNY slides a big colour photograph over the table.  It

                    End to start a rumour on the

      The curtains are closed.  Fred is peeking through them.  His 
      wife Helen comes into the room.

      she lifts the telephone.

      Later.

      Helen is sitting quietly in the dark room, the curtains still 
      pulled.

      Fred comes in and stops.  She looks at him.  We see she has 
      been crying.  And she is afraid of him.

      Tom is waiting, feet still up on the desk.  Danny looks at

      Harry, Tom, Adam, Danny, Zoe, Ruth are in the meeting room.  
      The photographs Adam took are showing up on laptop screens 
      and on the plasma screen at the end of the room.

                                  ADAM
                    They looked like a professional 
                    team.

                                  ZOE
                    The car had false number plates.  

                                  DANNY
                      A surveillance team means serious 
                      organisation.

                                  HARRY
                    We ve got to know who these people 
                    are.

                                  DANNY
                    Lift them and ask them.

                                  TOM
                    No.  No: they can see we re 
                    crawling all over Fred Roberts.  
                    That s what attracts them.  Our 
                    interest makes it seem that Fred 
                    really can make Red Mercury. We 
                    carry on baby-sitting him.   

                                  ZOE
                    And the family in Leeds ... do we 
                    get them to a safe house?

                                  ADAM
                    No, I don t think so.  We have to 
                    leave the family hanging out to 
                    dry?  Don t we Tom?

                                  TOM
                    Yes.  That s the trap.

                                  HARRY
                    Fred s cover, it s fully back-
                    stopped?

                                  ZOE

                      everything.

      EXT. STREET IN EAST LONDON - DAY 2. 1700
   
2222

      A distance from the explosion site which is taped off with 
      uniformed police guarding it.  

      A car.  Zoe and Danny sit in it.

      INT. CAR - DAY 2. 1700
2323

                                  DANNY
                    Nothing.  Nothing at all.

                                  ZOE
                    No.

      SHOT:  

      THROUGH THE WINDSCREEN a forlorn group of people are seen 
      hanging around in the middle distance: a WOMAN with a child 
      in a buggy, a HOMELESS MAN, a couple of YOUTHS staring at the 
      site.  A couple of REPORTERS.

                                  DANNY
                      Photographed them? (O.S)

                                  ZOE (O.S.)
                    Yeah.

                                  DANNY (O.S.)
                    Don t look like the local branch of 
                    Al Qaeda to me.

                                  ZOE (O.S.)
                    Trouble is these days anyone could 
                    be anyone.

      IN THE CAR:

      Zoe presses a small device in her hand.  Tissue box sitting 
      on the dashboard clicks.  It takes a photo.

                                  DANNY
                    How do you think Tom is?

                          (A beat)
                    All right how do you think he is?

                                  DANNY
                    He kind of sets my teeth on edge.

                    wrong?  I mean after what we went

                    He s gamekeeping the op fine.   

      Danny sees something.

                                  DANNY
                    Hello who s this?

      THROUGH THE WINDSCREEN:

      Zoe sees a press photographer has arrived.  It is WILL NORTH.  
      They watch him taking photographs of the bomb site.

                                  ZOE (O.S.)
                    More press.

      Will crouches elegantly to take a shot.  Zoe is taken aback.

                                  ZOE (cont d)
                    Oh.

      IN THE CAR:

                                  DANNY
                    What?

      Zoe shrugs.

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                    What s he doing?

      THROUGH THE WINDSCREEN:  Will is looking at them and taking 
      out a long lens from his camera.

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                                                                                              **
                    I think he s spotted us.

      Will has screwed the lens on to his camera and is taking 
      shots.

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                    Can t have that!

                                  DANNY
                    I will  ...

      But she s out of the car.  Danny sighs.

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                    Call of the wild, Zoe?

      INT. THAMES HOUSE. THE GRID - DAY 2. 1830

      Zoe is sitting at her computer.  

      ON HER SCREEN:  she is going through a security site giving 
      information about journalists.   She comes to one with Will 
      North s photograph on it, giving his name.

      Malcolm comes past her desk.

                                    MALCOLM
                    One camera and pics.  

      He sweeps off.  Zoe picks up the pictures.

      CLOSE TO the photographs as Zoe looks through them.  They are 
      of the bombsite.  Then of Danny and Zoe in the car.  The 
      final one is of Zoe when she approached him: it is a fabulous 
      shot.

      Danny leans over the desk.

      INT. LECTURE ROOM - DAY 4. 0900

      The room is old fashioned: seats banked steeply above a 
      platform, a large white screen on the wall.  It is packed 
      with students.  Danny sits in a corner.

      A babble of excited talk.  

      Fred walks onto the platform.  The talk stops.  Silence.  
      Everyone is dead still.

                                  FRED 
                    Well.  I see the molecular transfer 
                    of energy is suddenly wildly 
                    popular.

      A few giggles.

                                  FRED (cont d)
                    I m sorry to disappoint anyone 
                    who s here to be stunned by details 
                    of my criminal career.  Because in 
                    this lecture I will be considering 
                    questions of solid absorption or 
                    selective absorption in reactors 
                    operating in a periodic way or at a 
                    steady state.  First let us 
                    consider catalytically active 
                    material on a non-catalytic 
                    absorbing support  ...

      Some students stand and begin to make their way out.

      Six students are left.  Lawrence Sayle amongst them.  He is 
      white, slight frame, a pasty face.  A serious demeanor, short-
      haired, conventionally dressed.  He is 24 years old.  Danny 
      is at the back devastated with boredom.

                                  FRED (cont d)
                    Therefore one has to conclude that 
                    we are looking at a novel biphasic 
                    process, immisciable when cold yet 
                      homogenising when heated allowing 
                    acylation to take place.  And next 
                    week could you please read up on 
                    Lewis acids, typically aluminium 
                    oxide with reference to the 
                    quenching of reactions.  Thank you 
                    all very much.

      Students are leaving.  As they go Lawrence approaches Fred.  
      Danny sighs and leans forward to hear.

                                  LAWRENCE

      Then they ignore Lawrence.  They do not realise he is 
      special.

      Fred comes out, flustered, trying to close his case walking 
      fast.

      GO TO Danny.  He sees Lawrence Sayle leaving the gatehouse of 
      the University.

                    I ve got a visual.  Do you want me 
                    to track him?

      GO TO Tom, who hesitates.

                    Tom, do I track him?

      Tom walks away from Fred.

      Fred is walking up and down holding a bottle of whiskey.  He 
      is in the midst of a debriefing session with Tom.

                                  FRED
                    I tried to ring Helen.  The phone 
                    didn t work.  I tried her mobile, 
                    that didn t work either.  Is that 
                    you?

                                  TOM

                    Don t you think of us as human 
                    beings at all?

      A moment.  This has touched Tom more than Fred knows.

                                  TOM
                    Fred ... this is difficult for you 
                    ... but can we go through exactly 
                    what this young man said to you.

                                  FRED
                    He wants the Red Mercury in three 
                    days.  He ll let me know how it ll 
                    be collected.  Mike, what about my 
                    family?

                                  TOM
                    They will be all right.

                                  FRED

      ceramic dogs and cats.

      Mrs Sayle is very worried.

                    groups.  Some make up a mini-
                      terrorist s handbook: how to handle 
                      detonators, explosives.  The others 
                    are ideological.  They look forward 
                    to the over throw of Saudi Arabia 
                    and the establishment of the House 
                    of Islam with a Caliphate in

                    It s a funny thing with science.  
                    You predict something exists.  Do

                    Why?

                                  TOM
                    We re totally in the dark about how 
                    this group are going to collect.  
                    And since Lawrence Sayle is a post-
                    grad with a first class degree in 
                    chemistry  ...   aren t they going 
                    to know Fred is selling them curry 
                    powder?  We re asking this man to 
                    walk off a cliff!  

                                  HARRY
                    Tom what is the matter?

                                  TOM
                    I don t have faith in the 
                      operation.

                                  HARRY
                    Then you don t have faith in

                    What?

                    Fly trap is working better than we 
                    dared hope.  We ve flushed out a

                    Tom.  When did you last sleep?

      Tom, a dismissive wave.

                    I m relieving you for eight hours.  
                    Go home, have a glass or two of a 
                    decent Medoc or whatever.  Sleep 
                    and be back in the morning.

      Tom is still for a moment, staring at him.

                                  TOM
                    Right.  Yes.

                                  TOM
                    Yes.

      Tom goes.  Harry sits for a while.  Then he presses a button 
      on his phone.

                                  HARRY

      INT. DANNY AND ZOE S FLAT - NIGHT 5. 2130
6060

      The doorbell rings and Danny answers.  Tom comes in quickly.  

                                  DANNY
                    Boss?  What s  ...

                    Where s Zoe?

                                  DANNY
                    Thames House of course.  What s up?

                                  TOM
                    I think Harry s going to take me 
                    off the operation.  Probably put in 
                    Adam to run it.

                                  DANNY
                    Why?

                                  TOM
                    Because I want to close it down.

                                  DANNY
                    But it s going like clockwork.

                                  TOM
                    It s going to end with everything 
                    shot to bits.  Innocent people 
                    dead.  I don t know what we re 
                    doing any more!

                                  DANNY
                    Running an entrapment scam. 

                                  TOM
                    It s immoral. 

                                  DANNY
                    We ve done it often enough.

                                  TOM
                    It stinks!

      Danny is angry.

                                  DANNY
                    But you were really hot for it.  
                    You worked the Prof hard, wound him 
                    up set him running.  You had me 
                    ring his wife and tell her he d 
                    done her credit card in!  Come on, 
                    immoral?  What is this?

      Tom goes.  The door closes.  Danny turns away and looks at 
      the telephone.  His hand goes out to it.  He changes his mind 
      and sits down.  He rubs his face.

      Tom checks no one is around then enters the box.

      INT. UNIVERSITY LABORATORY - NIGHT 5. 0000

      Fred is working.

      Tom comes into view beside him.

                                  FRED
                          (Very preoccupied)
                    You know it could have some of the 
                      properties of Tritium.  But that 
                    would make it very unstable.
                          (Realises who is beside 
                            him)
                    Oh, Mike.

                    Your family are still in Leeds.

                    You told me you had them in a 
                      safehouse.

                                  TOM
                    It was thought that if we moved 
                    them the Aleph Command would know 
                    that you were working for us.

                                  FRED
                    You bastard. I trusted you.  

                                  TOM
                    I ll take you to them.

                    You ll what?

                                  TOM
                    Then you can all go to some place 
                                                                                              *
                    really safe.  

                                  FRED

                    It s a bolt hole of mine.  In

                    What is this?  Some kind of crisis 
                    of conscience?  I thought you left

                    Yes er, look.  Something came in 
                    the post.

                    I didn t know whether to  ...  
                    anyway.

      She takes a postcard from her bag.  Adam and Zoe peer at it 
      beneath a small light.  It reads  Sunny Bognor Regis.   On 
      the other side is written:  Dear All.  Wish you were here. 

      Zoe runs her thumb nail on the edge.  Peels the picture away.  
      Beneath is written  Not Bognor.  Love, Tom.

                    The music s stopped.  They re 
                    talking.

      They all grab headphones.  The postcard falls to the floor of 
      the van.
