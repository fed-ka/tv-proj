    As they get out of the car-

                                CLARK
                  I understand those things so well I 
                  was actually at the office at the 
                  agreed upon time.

                                ROSS
                  In a way my absence is directly 
                  attributable to you.

                                CLARK
                  I never remotely suggested you use the 
                  research to pick up women.

                                ROSS
                  You should have. 
                          (dawning)
                  God, maybe that s what we should be 
                  selling.

    As Clark walks and talks FAST Ross struggles to keep up.

                                CLARK
                  The studies show you re judged to be 
                  more likable if you begin by admitting 
                  to your faults rather than waiting. In 
                  fact, it actually makes you more 
                  likable than someone with no faults at 
                  all. We d be better off making up 
                  things to admit to than appearing to 
                  be perfect.

                                ROSS
                  I highly doubt we have to worry about 
                  appearing perfect.
                        (grabs, stops Clark)
                  Are we racing?

                                CLARK
                  I m excited. 

                                ROSS
                  Is there an excitement level just 
                  below jogging into the meeting?

                                CLARK
                  I m not jogging. This is jogging.

    Before he can begin actually jogging, Ross grabs him.                                                                                      6.

                                ROSS
                  Why aren t you sleeping at home?

                                CLARK
                  Well, I wasn t sleeping, so it didn t 
                  make sense to-

                                ROSS
                  You know what I mean.

                                CLARK
                  There s still a lot of Beth s stuff 
                  there, and I can t get rid of it 
                  because I m not ready to get rid of it 
                  but I can t be around it-

                                ROSS
                  Clark, you ve got to stop this. She 
                  was just some girl. You ve had other-

                                CLARK
                  No. No, not like this, not like-
                        (quick beat)
                  You re killing my mojo here, Ross. 
                  This is killing it. So let s do this 
                  later because right now I m ready to 
                  shake the money tree. I m ready to 
                  dominate. Can we go dominate? Let s go 
                  dominate.

    Clark heads in. Ross stands, concerned.

                                ROSS
                  Is there a level just below dominate?


    Charles waits for the bus. Megan sits on the other end of the 
    bench. They smile briefly at one another.


    Latrell, nervous, makes his way toward the bus stop. He 
    hesitates. He speaks into a mic we can t see.

                                  LATRELL
                  Guys, seriously, I don t think I can-


    Clark, Claire, and Ross watch from the end of the block.

                                CLARK
                        (into walkie)
                  Stop whining and just do it!
                        (to Claire and Ross)
                  Sudden negative reinforcement can help 
                  alleviate reluctance and-

                                ROSS
                  I m familiar with  yelling at 
                  someone . You don t really have to 
                  explain it.

                                CLAIRE
                  I wouldn t have thought one of your 
                  ponzi scheme jockeys would have so 
                  much trouble playing a bad guy. 

                                ROSS
                  Latrell s not like that. He was only 
                  good because he never knew the 
                    investments we were selling weren t 
                  real.

                                CLAIRE
                  Ah. So you lied to him too. We should 
                  start a support group. 

    As Clark watches, Ross pulls Claire a couple steps away.

                                ROSS
                  Is that why you re here? To keep 
                  raking me over the coals? 

                                CLAIRE
                  Nice to see you still assume 
                  everything revolves around you.                                                                                      29.

    CONTINUED:

                                ROSS
                  Then what it is? You want more money? 
                  The lawyers took everything that-

                                CLAIRE
                  I never cared about money. That was 
                  you. 

                                ROSS
                  Look, let s just be honest. This isn t 
                  going to work. Stop filling his head 
                  with this crap about needing you and 
                  let s just leave each other alone.

                                CLAIRE
                  He does need me. If you want to be 
                  left alone, maybe you should go.

                                ROSS
                  Me? This whole thing was my idea.

                                CLAIRE
                  Exactly. Your ideas tend to end in 
                  depositions. 

                                ROSS
                  I had that under control. I was making 
                  it legitimate when my wife turned me 
                  in-

                                CLAIRE
                  I didn t turn you in. You told me our 
                  whole life was a lie two days before a 
                  man with a badge started asking me 
                  questions. What was I supposed to say?

                                ROSS
                  Nothing!

    ON LATRELL who s made it to the bus stop, but just stands in 
    front of Megan, frozen. She looks at him, eyes pleading. 

                                  LATRELL
                        (weakly)
                  Hey. You re uh... you...

    But he just trails off. As Megan stares up at him-

    ON CLARK-

                                CLARK
                        (into walkie)
                  Come on Latrell. Come on.


    Miles sees THE BUS coming down the block.

                                MILES

                  Guys. Bus incoming. Time to go.                                                                                      30.

    CONTINUED:

    LATRELL GLANCES up, sees the bus. Still he can t do it.

    BACK ON CLAIRE AND ROSS who continue fighting, oblivious.

                                CLAIRE
                  You know what the most insulting part 
                  was? Not that they hauled me in for 
                    questioning a hundred times. But that 
                  they just couldn t believe I didn t 
                  know the whole time. That someone 
                  could really lie to their wife about 
                  almost every aspect of their life 
                  together. They didn t think that was 
                  possible. I told them obviously they 
                  hadn t spent enough time with you.

                                ROSS
                  I was trying to protect you. I didn t-

    Suddenly CLARK STARTS to come unglued.

                                CLARK
                  Will you two stop it! We re right in 
                  the middle of a delicate- and Latrell 
                  won t - and the bus is-

    Clark suddenly turns around and starts to KICK the van. Over 
    and over. Hard.

                                CLARK
                        (into walkie)
                  Latrell! DO IT! NOW! What is wrong 
                  with you! Why won t you- NOW! Latrell! 
                  Now! Now! Now! Now!

    Suddenly Claire hugs him, pinning his arms to his side. She 
    puts her lips right next to his ear. It s almost intimate.

                                CLAIRE
                        (whispering)
                  Hey. It s okay. It s okay. Relax.

    Ross watches, surprised, somewhat jealous, that this actually 
    seems to bring Clark down. 

    MEGAN LOOKS UP, sees the bus is almost there. She locks eyes 
    with Latrell. She gives him a tiny smile and confident nod. 
    Latrell absorbs that and then suddenly...

                                  LATRELL
                  HEY!

    Both Megan and Charles jump at the sound of Latrell s voice.

    ON CLARK as he looks up, buoyed by the sound of Latrell 
    through the walkie, actually doing it.

    BACK ON LATRELL-

                                  LATRELL
                  You re on my bench! That s my bench!                                                                                       31.

    CONTINUED: (2)

                                MEGAN
                  I m sorry, I - 

    She starts to get up, but Latrell pushes her back down. That 
    causes Charles to speak up, although meekly.

                                  CHARLES
                  Hey, there s no need to-

    Latrell suddenly wheels on him.

                                  LATRELL
                  What! What did you say!

    Charles freezes, intimidated. Latrell waits, unsure.

    CLARK, CLAIRE, and ROSS are watching.

                                CLARK
                        (calmed, into walkie)
                  Don t let up, Latrell. He ll snap. I 
                  promise. Just keep going.

    AS THE BUS BEARS DOWN, Latrell decides to go for it. He steps 
    closer to Charles.

                                  LATRELL
                  You have a problem?! Huh?!

                                  CHARLES
                  No. I was just saying that-

    Latrell SHOVES Charles. And with that... Charles snaps. He 
    SHOVES Latrell back and comes after him like a rabid dog.

                                  CHARLES
                  DON T TOUCH ME! YOU HEAR ME! I WILL-

    SLOW MOTION for a beat as Charles screams, veins popping, 
    spittle flying. Latrell doing the same as he backs away.

    RESUME as the bus stops-

                                  CHARLES
                  GET OUT OF HERE! GO! NOW!

    Latrell turns, moves down the block. The BUS DRIVER sticks his 
    head out of the bus.

                                BUS DRIVER
                  Everything okay?

    As Charles turns back toward the bus, shaking with adrenaline, 
    Megan looks at him admiringly.

                                MEGAN
                  Yeah. We re fine now.

    As they step toward the bus, she puts a hand on Charles  arm.

                                MEGAN
                  Thank you.                                                                                      32.

    CONTINUED: (3)

    Charles looks at her, nods.


    Claire steps out.

                                CLAIRE
                  Clark?

    She looks up and down the street. Clark s gone.


    Clark jogs across campus until he comes to some two story 
      apartments. He rushes to a bottom door and begins KNOCKING.

                                CLARK
                  Beth! Beth it s me. Beth we just need 
                  to talk. Come on. Please!

    More KNOCKING as he dials his phone. He gets voicemail.

                                CLARK
                  Beth, come on! Please. I love you 
                  Beth! Can I say that to your face? Can 
                  I say it to your face and if you don t 
                  feel anything, if you don t love me, 
                  if it doesn t make any difference then-

    A GIRL steps out of an apartment above.

                                GIRL
                  Professor Edwards?

    He looks up.

                                CLARK
                  Oh. Hi. Yes. I m sorry. I didn t mean 
                  to be a disturbance. I m just trying-                                                                                      39.

    CONTINUED:

                                GIRL
                  She moved out. Like, two weeks ago.

    Clark is stunned.

                                CLARK
                  No.

                                GIRL
                  Yeah. 

                                CLARK
                  Where?

                                GIRL
                  I don t know. I just saw movers and-

                                CLARK
                  NO!

    The girl recoils. He rushes back to the door, BEATING on it.

                                CLARK
                  No, no, no, no, no, no, no! BETH!

    He steps away from the door, looks around, spots a large rock. 
    He picks it up, HEAVES it through a window. The Girl rushes 
    back into her apartment. Clark reaches through the broken 
    glass, unlocks Beth s door.


    Claire and Clark are rushing in when they run into Latrell.

                                  LATRELL
                  What s going on?

                                CLAIRE
                  You really don t know?

                                  LATRELL
                  Know what? I had a lunch in Long Beach 
                  but the guy stood me up.

                  Ross set that?

                                  LATRELL
                  Yes...

                  Probably wanted to keep you clean in 
                  case it went wrong.

    As they jump into a waiting elevator-

                                  LATRELL
                  What  it ? What s going on?                                                                                      53.

                  She keeps saying extortion, but I m 
                  pretty sure it s covered by false 
                  pretenses statutes.


    Ross is reading Beth the riot act.

                                ROSS
                  You cannot be here, Beth. This was NOT 
                  the agreement. I paid you a small 
                  fortune to walk away never to be-

                                BETH
                        (holding out a check)
                  That s all of it. I don t want it.
                        (off Ross s stunned silence)
                  I know it was just supposed to be an 
                  act, but something happened. I 
                  really... I like him. I tried to go 
                  away like we said, but... I want to 
                  see if maybe we could make it work.

                                ROSS
                  It did work. You got him fired! That s 
                  all I asked for. That was the 
                  agreement! You can t come back now!

                                BETH
                  I m sorry. But I can t let him go. And 
                  he obviously can t let me go either.
                  Look, I m not going to tell him about 
                  our deal. I swear. It would be as bad 
                  for me as it would you.

                                ROSS
                  Oh really? Are you his brother?
