WADE WHITEHOUSE, driving, sits beside JILL, his daughter,
ten years-old, wearing a black-and-yellow tiger plastic mask.
WADE
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I
couldn't help it it's too late to go
trick-or-treating now. I couldn't
help it I had to stop at Penny's for
the costume. And you were hungry,
remember.
JILL
Who's fault is it then if it's not
yours? You're the one in charge,
Daddy.
WADE
(shakes cigarette
from pack)
Yeah.
JILL
Look. Those kids are still trick-or-
treating. They're still out.
Wade watches boys in the headlights, lights cigarette.
WADE
Those are the Hoyts.
JILL
I don't care. They're out.
WADE
Can't you see... look out there.
Nobody's got their porch lights on
anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt
kids are just out to get in trouble.
See, they put shaving cream all over
that mailbox there. They chopped
down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little
bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
Wade grimaces, holds his jaw. The Fairlane swerves around
broken pumpkins under a caution light.
JILL
Why do they do that?
WADE
Do what?
JILL
You know.
WADE
Break stuff?
JILL
Yeah. It's stupid.
WADE
I guess they're stupid.
JILL
Did you do that when you were a kid?
WADE
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really
mean. Me and my pals, me and my
brothers. It was kind of funny then.
Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows.
Stuff like that.
JILL
Was it funny?
WADE
To us it was.
JILL
But it's not funny now.
WADE
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I
gotta listen to all the complaints
people make. I'm not a kid anymore.
You change.
JILL
I bet you did lots of bad things.
WADE
What are you talking about?
JILL
I just think you used to be bad.
WADE
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir.
Where do you get this stuff? From
your mother?
JILL
No. She doesn't talk about you
anymore.
Wade looks at her, wanting to lift her mask, see her face.
CUT TO:
The Fairlane approaches Town Hall, a square two-story building
on the north side of the Common. Exhaust billows from idling
cars as parents and children come and go.
CUT TO:
Wade steps outside, lights a cigarette. JACK HEWITT, 23,
clean-cut, handsome, cocky, stands with CHICK WARD and FRANKIE
LACOY, local boys.
WADE
What are you boys up to?
CHICK
Same old shit.
FRANKIE
You see the damage these little sons-
of bitches been raising tonight?
WADE
(to Jack)
You're going to have to move your
pickup.
JACK
I know.
CHICK
(offers whiskey pint)
Take a bite.
WADE
Don't mind if I do.
JACK
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time
in there. Master of fucking
ceremonies.
WADE
Where's that gun you were bragging
on today?
Jack stops over to his double-parked burgandy pickup, removes
a Browning BAR .30/06 with a scope, hands it to Wade.
JACK
No brag. Just fact.
WADE
(admires gun)
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?
(passes it to Frankie)
FRANKIE
Nice.
JACK
(to Wade)
See you got Jill tonight. How'd you
manage that?
WADE
(turns)
Don't forget to move your truck.
(walks inside)
CUT TO:
Wade leads her to a frosted-glass door reading "POLICE",
enters. Inside, he flips on flourescent light, dials the
desk phone. More utility room than office.
He waits. There's no answer. Jill looks down.
WADE
She's gone already!
(hangs up)
Gone already! Couldn't wait.
JILL
Yes.
WADE
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
JILL
Yes.
WADE
She won't be here for a half hour.
Think you can stand it that long?
JILL
Yes.
WADE
Where do you expect to wait for her?
Obviously downstairs with the other
kids isn't good enough.
Jill sits in a chair facing the dark window pane.
WADE
Sit right there by yourself if you
want. Wait for her by yourself. That's
fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going
downstairs.
JILL
That's fine with me too. When Mommy
comes, tell her I'm up here.
Wade Whitehouse stalks out.
CUT TO:
Wade steps outside, notices Jack Hewitt and his kewpie-doll
girlfriend HETTIE, 20, sitting in the cab of his double-parked
pickup, sharing a joint, talking to LaCoy alongside.
WADE
I thought I told you to move that
truck!
JACK
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You
wanna toke?
WADE
(steps over)
You gotta be more careful about that
shit. Gordon or one of those guys
sees you smoking that wacky tabacky
around me they'll expect me to bust
you. And I'll be outta a job.
JACK
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be
such a hardass. I know you got
problems, but everybody's got
problems.
(offers joint)
WADE
Not here.
LaCoy laughs: that Jack Hewitt, some guy. Wade holds his
aching jaw. He looks at Jack's young athletic body, his pretty
girlfriend, envies him.
JACK
Well, c'mon, then. Get in and we'll
take a little ride, my man.
Wade looks up to the window where Jill waits, walks around
the front of the truck, gets in.
CUT TO:
Jack's high-bodied pickup growls in low gear as it drives
past Merritt's Shell station toward Saddleback Ridge. Jack
lowers the radio as Wade asks him about deer season; Hettie
leans forward to hear the music.
JACK
Got a job first thing in the morning,
first day of season. Saturday I'll
hunt for myself. Twombley something. -
Er --
WADE
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official
from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
JACK
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a
full-blown asshole. Pay's good,
though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee
a kill, of course. Which I can do.
There's some monster bucks hiding
out up there.
WADE
How'd you get the job?
JACK
Gordon, he's always got some angle
working. He wants to keep Twombley
happy, I'm his boy.
Wade grimaces as he passes the joint back.
HETTIE
What's wrong with you?
WADE
Toothache.
(to Jack)
You should get close to him. Make
yourself irreplaceable. Guy's loaded.
JACK
Like you and Gordon?
WADE
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get
along without me.
JACK
(laughs)
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you
quit him.
WADE
(laughs)
Right!
A car flashes past.
JACK
Bastard's got his high beams on.
WADE
(watching)
Shit.
HETTIE
What?
WADE
My ex-wife Lillian and her husband.
That was them in the Audi that just
passed us.
JACK
Audi's a good car.
HETTIE
What's she up here for?
WADE
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me
and Jill had a little argument. Jack,
I got to get back, get back to town.
Move this thing, will you? See if
you can get back to the Town Hall
before they get there, okay?
JACK
Piece of fucking cake.
Jack brakes, wheels the 4x4 around, heads back to town.
CUT TO:
Most parents have left or are leaving with their costumed
children. Hewitt's burgundy pickup breaks alongside the Audi.
Wade swings open the passenger door, jumps to the ground:
WADE
Lillian!
LILLIAN
Where's Jill?
LILLIAN, 40, attractive in an ankle-length hooded coat.
Whatever pose Wade strikes, she strikes the opposite. Her
dress and demeanor set her apart.
WADE
Me and Jill, we just had a little
spat. She felt kind of left out, I
guess, from not knowing some of the
new kids --
LILLIAN
Where is she now? Is she in the truck
with your friends?
Jack and Hettie neck inside the cab.
WADE
She told me she wanted to wait for
you. Inside.
Jill at the window in her tiger mask. Lillian waves; Jill
motions she'll be down.
LILLIAN
While you went off for a few beers
with your friends? Is that Hettie
Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
WADE
Yeah.
LILLIAN
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
WADE
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It
looks like you've won this fucking
round already, so lay off a little,
for Christ's sake.
HORNER, 45, Lillian's new husband, thin with thinning hair
and a Tyrolean hat, sees Jill at the entrance and heads toward
her.
WADE
Horner! Leave her be. This's got
nothing to do with you, so just act
like the chauffeur. Got it?
HORNER
Wade. Nobody wants any trouble.
Horner greets Jill, walks her to the silver Audi. Passing
parents, listening, give Wade a wide berth.
WADE
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
LILLIAN
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying
to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it
any worse.
WADE
I'm not making it any worse. You
are. Me and Jill could've worked
this thing out. It's normal, it's
even normal for me to get a little
touchy about it. Believe it or not.
How do you think this makes me look,
treating her like some tragic victim
or something?
Horner opens the car door for Jill, shuts it. Wade shoves
him:
WADE
Just wait till we're through,
goddamnit!
Horner's hat falls. Lillian, icy, stares at Wade. He backs
off. Wade sometimes wonders: how'd Lillian Pittman of Lawford,
N.H., get so much class?
WADE
Don't you say a word. I didn't hit
him. I'm not going to hit anybody.
Horner sits behind the wheel. Lillian silently stares Wade
up and down, gets in the car beside Jill. The automatic locks
latch as the Audi drives away. Its taillights merge with
vanishing traffic.
Wade looks down, picks up Horner's dark green Tyrolean hat,
examines it, as if unsure of its function.
Wade walks toward Town Hall. MARGIE FOGG, exiting, greets
him:
MARGIE
New hat?
(no answer)
Jill's up, I see.
WADE
(vague)
For a while.
MARGIE
How's she doing?
WADE
Okay. She's fine.
MARGIE
You two want to do anything tomorrow
and need a third party, give me a
call, okay? I'm off.
NICK WICKHAM, 45, Marg's boss, passes by:
WICKHAM
Like hell you are. Tomorrow's first
day of deer season. I'll need you at
least in the morning.
MARGIE
(shrugs)
Well, that's that.
NICK
(walks off)
Take care, Wade.
WADE
You be careful of that little bastard.
He's dying to get in your pants, you
know.
MARGIE
(laughs)
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue.
I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
WADE
See you tomorrow, maybe.
MARGIE
You okay?
WADE
Yeah.
Wade, lost in thought, continues toward Town Hall. At the
door, LaRiviere, one of the last to leave, eyes him. Wade
tosses Horner's hat inside.
WADE
Tomorrow, Gordon.
LARIVIERE
Watch this snow. It's coming down
tonight.
Wade nods as he lights a cigarette. Alone, he watches the
last cars pull out. He holds his jaw.
CUT TO:
Pre-dawn light silhouettes a dozen weather-beaten mobile
homes set off Route 29. Snow continues to fall. A sheet of
white stretches down Parker mountain.
CUT TO:
Jack Hewitt's 4x4 passes Wade's trailer, continues up 29.
Tire chains splice the path.
CUT TO:
Jack behind the wheel. Beside him EVAN TWOMBLEY, 60, fleshy,
Irish, wearing brand new scarlet wool pants, jacket and cap.
He feeds on the misfortunes of others.
TWOMBLEY
It's not enough snow, not for tracking
the bastards. No advantage there,
kid.
JACK
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know
where those suckers are. Rain or
shine, snow or no snow. I know deer.
We'll kill us a buck today.
Guaranteed. Before ten.
TWOMBLEY
Guaranteed, eh?
JACK
Yep. Right about now the does are
holing up in the brush piles. The
bucks are right behind them and we're
right behind the bucks.
(gestures to gun rack)
This gun gets fired before ten
o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or
not is more less up to you. I'll put
you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck
the first four hours of the season.
That's what you're paying me for,
ain't it?
TWOMBLEY
Damn straight!
Hewitt looks at Twombley's rifle: a Winchester M-94 pump-
action, custom carved stock and not a scratch on it. Never
fired, at least not by Twombley.
JACK
Done much shooting with that rifle
yet?
TWOMBLEY
(eyes him)
Tell you what. You get me close to a
big buck by ten, kid, there's another
hundred bucks in it.
JACK
If you get it?
TWOMBLEY
Yeah.
JACK
You might not kill it.
TWOMBLEY
You think so.
JACK
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it
for somebody else to find and tag.
Can't guarantee that won't happen,
especially with a new gun. I may
have to shoot it.
TWOMBLEY
You take care of your end, kid, I'll
take care of mine.
JACK
Mmm.
TWOMBLEY
You understand what I'm saying? I
want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple
or whatthefuck.
JACK
I get it.
(disdain)
No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer
and you'll get him dead. And you'll
have him by coffee time.
TWOMBLEY
And you'll get your extra hundred
bucks.
JACK
(smiles)
Wonderful!
The pickup disappears behind a curve of pine and spruce trees.
CUT TO:
Wade Whitehouse, wearing a reflective vest, waves a district
school bus into the parking lot. Noisy, jostling grade
schoolers emerge from the bus. Jill's former classmates.
Straight as a statue, Wade holds back traffic. Cars and trucks
are backed up on the unplowed road. Horns honk and bleat; a
woman's voice yells, "Whitehouse, we 'ain't got all day!"
Wade, daydreaming, seems oblivious to the commotion. Oblivious --
or just plum contrary.
A shiny black BMW approaches, speeding, passing traffic on
the shoulder. A man and a woman in a fur coat sit in front,
two children in back. Whitehouse waves for it to stop.
The BMW accelerates through the intersection, ignoring Wade
and the traffic. It whizzes past, spinning Wade, and is
quickly up the road, spewing ice and exhaust. Wade slips to
one knee. Honking ensues; every car goes where it wishes.
Wade, brushing off snow, follows the last bus as it pulls
in. LUGENE BROOKS, 60, school principal, rushes over:
LUGENE
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong?
Why were you holding everyone up?
WADE
Did you see that sonofabitch in the
BMW? He could've killed somebody.
LUGENE
Did you get his number?
WADE
I know who it is.
LUGENE
Good. Who?
WADE
Mel Gordon.
LUGENE
I still don't understand --
WADE
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in-
law -- he was driving. I know where
they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway.
The old man's out deer hunting with
Jack Hewitt, so they probably got
some big weekend party planned.
Wade sets his face, thinking.
CUT TO:
Snowprints lead from Jack's pickup to where he and Twombley
walk, guns pointed skyward. They enter a line of trees.
Jack watches Twombley walk ahead of him, wrapped like a huge
infant in red bunting, crunching twigs underfoot. He looks
from side to side, checks his gun, returns to watching
Twombley. They're alone.
JACK
Safety on?
Twombley nods, slips, thumps to the ground. His rifle lands
silently.
Jack sprints over, helps him up, safety latches the
Winchester. Hands it back.
TWOMBLEY
I'm okay.
JACK
Follow close. We'll cross the next
meadow.
Jack finds a path, one eye on Twombley:
JACK
I used to play ball.
TWOMBLEY
Yeah?
JACK
Drafted by the Red Sox.
TWOMBLEY
You played for the Sox?
JACK
Double A. New Britain.
TWOMBLEY
Oh.
JACK
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come
out of New Hampshire since Carlton
Fisk."
TWOMBLEY
Really.
JACK
They said.
TWOMBLEY
Hmm.
JACK
The only difference between me and
that Clemens on TV is luck, shit
luck.
TWOMBLEY
What happened?
JACK
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too
fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking
arm, I used to think. Then I realized
it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
Jack waits for Twombley as they enter a meadow. Jack aims
his rifle at Twombley as he approaches.
TWOMBLEY
Hey, Hewitt! Slow the fuck down!
Jack aims away, following an imaginary bird. Twombley steps
alongside.
JACK
Safety on?
TWOMBLEY
Yeah.
JACK
This way.
TWOMBLEY
(walking loudly)
Sun's gettin high.
JACK
(fingers to lips)
Deers have ears too.
CUT TO:
Milky sky flatters LaRiviere Co., a sprawl of well-digging,
septic and snow plow equipment. Billboard declaimes:
"LARIVIERE CO. -- OUR BUSINESS IS GOING IN THE HOLE!" a motto
repeated on every truck and piece of equipment. Wade's green
Fairlane is parked outside the office.
CUT TO:
Jack and Twombley walk through fresh snow. The hillside's
thick with pine trees. Twombley, red-faced, puffing, leans
to speak to Hewitt. Jack lifts a finger to his lips:
JACK
Stay here, stand where I am.
Twombley peers over a slight cliff at a lumber trail twenty
feet below. Jack points:
JACK
Fresh tracks.
(sniffs)
Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck,
Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
TWOMBLEY
You only got a little while if you
want your hundred bucks.
Jack zig-zags down the incline, while Twombley, gun poised,
waddles along the edge.
Jack stops fifty feet away, watches Twombley, a cartoon
character. A stag pokes his nose through the pines, steps
into a clearing. Jack aims his rifle, looks at Twombley.
Twombley turns to see the buck, loses his footing, TUMBLES
down the twenty-foot cliff.
CUT TO:
An open cab grader ("Our Business Is Going In The Hole")
sits in the rutted lot outside Toby's, a beer joint with
fake wood siding and 24-hour neon sign.
A four-wheel drive plow with the LaRiviere motto pulls in,
parks beside the blue grader. JIMMY DAME, 40, gets out,
glances at the grader as he enters.
CUT TO:
Thirty years before. GLEN WHITEHOUSE ("POP"), 42, pushes his
boys, Wade (13) and Rolfe (10), toward snow-covered lumps of
firewood behind the barn. He's drunk. The boys carry shovels
and a pickaxe.
POP
Move it! Daylight in the swamps!
ROLFE
Pop, the kids are waiting for us.
WADE
(reproving)
Rolfe.
POP
A lesson in work and its rewards.
You'll thank me for this one day.
(to house)
Sally, turn off that TV!
His sons chip at the wood. Hopeless. Frozen solid.
WADE
(to Rolfe)
Just do it.
POP
Atta-go.
ROLFE
Please, Pop. Let's go back.
Wade notices his mother, SALLY, watching from the window.
POP
What are you, a quitter?
CUT TO:
Wade, shivering in the open grader, plows a narrow winding
road. He lights a cigarette, exhales steamy smoke. LaCoy's
laugh triggers a memory:
CUT TO:
The town's 24-hour restaurant. A bright new sign reads: "Home
Made Cooking." Wade's grader out front.
CUT TO:
Elaine looks up from her desk as Wade pulls the grader into
the lot, jumps out, heads for his car. Laviviere stands
outside.
LARIVIERE
What's the hurry?
WADE
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
LARIVIERE
Huh?
WADE
I figured you already heard.
LARIVIERE
(urgent)
Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving:
I got to get up there. How would I
know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take
my truck.
They head for LaRiviere's blue 4x4 Dodge.
CUT TO:
Gordon and Wade drive up the same road Jack took Twombley.
Wade fiddles with the CB. No use: static.
LARIVIERE
Fuck. Turn it off.
(Wade does)
All you heard was there was some
kinda accident?
WADE
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not
Jack. He's okay, I assume.
LARIVIERE
Fuck. You don't know how bad or
anything?
WADE
You mean Twombley?
LARIVIERE
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out
that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
LaRiviere grunts disapproval as Wade slips the butt out his
window.
WADE
He more than likely just shot himself
in the foot or something. That's
what usually happens.
LARIVIERE
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
WADE
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer
hunting instead of freezing my ass
on that fucking grader.
LARIVIERE
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he
can't drive the grader worth shit.
WADE
Like hell.
Ahead, they see flashing lights and cars. A white emergency
vehicle passes, jolting the pickup.
LARIVIERE
(frightened)
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I
bet that was Twombley.
WADE
You want me to follow them to
Littleton?
LARIVIERE
Let's get to the top and talk to
Jack first. He'll know what happened.
He fucking better. If this coulda
been avoided, I'll put that kid's
ass in a sling.
CUT TO:
Wade pulls behind three state trooper cars. Jack stands joking
with the TROOPERS, one of whom holds a German shepherd on a
leash. LaRiviere and Wade jump out. Jack, suddenly serious,
turns to LaRiviere:
JACK
You heard the news.
LARIVIERE
I hear Twombley got shot.
JACK
Yeah.
Wade walks over to trooper ASA BROWN, pets the shepherd.
BROWN
Watch the dog, Wade. Takes a mind
to, he'll tear your fucking head
off.
LARIVIERE
(to Jack)
Bad?
BROWN
Thirty-thirty at close range.
LARIVIERE
Jesus.
WADE
Will he make it?
BROWN
(shakes head)
D.O.A. Blew the bastard wide open.
Had a hole in back you could put
your head into. Pretty big hole in
front too. You could've put your
fist into that one.
LARIVIERE
(to Jack)
You see it?
JACK
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart.
I spotted this buck, then I heard
the gun go off and Twombley was gone.
I looked over the little cliff we
was using for a stand and there the
fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it
right in.
LARIVIERE
This is gonna be one fucking mess to
clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and
daughter are up the weekend. Didn't
you say you'd seen him, Wade?
WADE
I seen 'em. Near ran me over.
BROWN
You wanna tell 'em, Gordon? You knew
the old man.
LARIVIERE
What the fuck. My day's already
ruined.
(to Wade)
Give me the keys. You can go back
with Jack. You still got a shitload
of plowing to do.
WADE
It ain't done, if that's what you
mean.
LARIVIERE
Something bugging you?
WADE
Yeah. A few things.
LARIVIERE
Well, right now we're not too
interested. Finish up what you gotta
do, then you can get bugged on your
own time.
Brown walks off with shepherd.
LARIVIERE
(to Jack)
Might as well take the rest of the
day off. You look sort of fucked up.
You've been paid for the day, anyhow,
right?
JACK
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid
me.
LARIVIERE
You'll get your money. Don't talk to
any newspapers about this. Twombley's
a big deal down in Massachusetts,
you know. Tell them your lawyer says
you shouldn't comment.
JACK
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do
I?
LARIVIERE
No, of course not. Just say it, that's
all.
Wade watches LaRiviere get into his pickup, drive off.
WADE
Where'd Twombley get shot?
JACK
In the chest.
WADE
(offers cigarette)
No, I mean whereabouts.
JACK
(points)
A half mile in, along the old lumber
road.
WADE
You bring him up yourself? That's a
steep climb.
JACK
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
WADE
You stayed away?
JACK
Yeah.
WADE
Where'd you get the blood?
JACK
What blood?
WADE
On your sleeve.
JACK
Musta... How'd I know? What're you
doing, playing cop?
WADE
I gotta make a report to Fish and
Game. I was just wondering, that's
all. What'd he do, to shoot himself,
I mean?
JACK
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or
something. I just heard the gun go
off.
WADE
I never seen a man shot before. Not
even in the service. Must be
something.
JACK
Well, I didn't actually see him do
it. Like I said.
WADE
Sure you did.
JACK
What?
WADE
Saw him do it?
JACK
What the fuck you telling me, Wade?
I never seen the guy get shot, I
told you that.
WADE
You musta seen him get shot. I know
you did.
JACK
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're
not making any sense, man.
They walk over to Jack's burgundy pickup. Wade eyes the rifles
in the gun rack.
WADE
There's your old twenty-gauge, and
that there's the new Browning you
was showing me last night. This must
be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very
fancy tooling. Probably fired one
time. It's a beautiful piece of work.
(touches it)
But what the hell, Jack, I guess you
deserve it. Right's right.
JACK
(starts engine)
Yeah.
WADE
Twombley sure as hell won't be
shooting it again.
JACK
He sure as hell won't.
CUT TO:
Wade's theory -- in black-and-white: Twombley's footing slips.
Jack turns to watch. Twombley's gun hits frozen rocks, fires,
blows a hole through his chest.
CUT TO:
Another theory: Black-and-white. Jack sees a figure run from
Twombley's body.
CUT TO:
TIMECUT: mobile homes.
CUT TO:
Wade's bubble-top Fairlane drives through snow covered hills.
CUT TO:
The Fairlane is parked outside a substantial summer house
with a wide porch and frozen pond. The "speeding" BMW in the
drive. Wade knocks on the front door. An 8 year-old boy
answers the door. Wade speaks; the boy goes back inside.
MRS. GORDON, 30, delicate, beautiful, wearing a dark green
robe, comes to the door. Her eyes are red-rimmed. Wade has
seen her before, but not this close. He feels awkward.
MRS. GORDON
Who are you?
WADE
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was
wondering, is your husband here?
MRS. GORDON
He's asleep. We were up very late.
WADE
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that
I'm real sorry about your father,
Mrs. Twombley.
MRS. GORDON
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
WADE
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just
had a little business to settle with
Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police
officer.
MRS. GORDON
Something about my father?
WADE
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic
thing. No big deal.
MRS. GORDON
Can't it wait, then?
MEL GORDON, 40, dark-eyed, wearing a tartan robe, steps behind
his wife.
MEL GORDON
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
WADE
How's that?
Mel folds his arms. His wife goes inside.
MEL GORDON
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
WADE
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I
come all the way to serve somebody a
summons, I don't call ahead for an
appointment.
MEL GORDON
What the hell are you talking about?
WADE
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving
violation.
MEL GORDON
Moving violation! I just got out of
bed and you're telling me you're
giving me a goddamn speeding ticket?
Now? Are you nuts? Is that it,
Whitehouse? You're nuts?
WADE
(writing)
Yesterday morning, you passed a
stopped school bus, which was flashing
its lights, then you--
MEL GORDON
(stops Wade's arm)
Hold on!
WADE
(wrenches hand free)
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr.
Gordon.
MEL GORDON
You're talking about a goddamned
ticket, from when I passed you at
the school where you were deciding
to hold up traffic while dreaming of
becoming a traffic cop or something?
WADE
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon.
I'm just --
MEL GORDON
Doing your fucking job. I know. I
watch television too.
WADE
Yes. Here's your ticket.
MEL GORDON
(refusing ticket)
You get the hell out of my house
now, asshole. And know this -- you
are going to be a lucky asshole if I
haven't got you fired before the day
is out. I can do it with one phone
call, and I'm pissed enough to do it
now!
Mel Gordon moves Wade out of the door, slams it. Wade steps
away, looks back at the house. Mrs. Gordon watches him from
the window.
CUT TO:
A wood frame house off the main drag. Snowing.
CUT TO:
Black-and-white. A further theory: Jack bends over the fallen
Twombley, holds a tarp to protect his chest from blood spray.
He shoots Twombley with his own gun.
CUT TO:
Margie gets into Wade's idling Ford.
CUT TO:
Wade, washed and changed, drives; Marg sits beside him. They
head north. Deer rifles echo from the woods.
MARGIE
Did you tell them?
(no answer)
That we were coming?
WADE
Don't you think it's proper for a
fella to introduce his girl to his
parents?
MARGIE
I know your parents.
WADE
I just want to pick up my divorce
papers. For the lawyer. It won't
take long.
CUT TO:
Sun slants over Parker Mountain; they pull up. The house,
once white, is peeling. Polyurethane flaps over dark windows.
The 1960 red Ford pickup sits long frozen in the open barn.
MARGIE
(getting out)
Are you sure they're home? Did you
call?
WADE
The truck's here. Looks like they've
stayed inside since the snow started.
They stamp their feet on the porch; Wade turns the knob.
Locked. It seems abandoned.
WADE
Strange.
MARGIE
Think they're alright?
WADE
Of course! I would've heard.
MARGIE
How?
WADE
I don't know for Christ's sake!
They round the house, try the back door. Wade knocks loudly.
GLEN WHITEHOUSE, 70, opens the door, stands inside. He wears
long underwear, stained woolen trousers, slippers.
CUT TO:
ROLFE WHITEHOUSE, 38, drives his four-door Toyota west:
through Massachusetts, toward New Hampshire. His face bespeaks
tolerance, objectivity -- in short, education. It's also
Wade's face.
ROLFE (V.O.)
Wade called me, as usual, late at
night. I knew it was Wade -- no one
else calls me at that hour -- and I
was ready to listen to another chapter
in one of his ongoing sagas. There
was the detective story concerning
the shooting of Evan Twombley and
the family melodrama about Wade's
custody fight with Lillian. But not
this time.
CUT TO:
Rolfe's Toyota sits with other cars.
ROLFE (V.O.)
Wade was telling a different story,
or so it seemed then, one in which I
myself was a character. He had called
to tell me that sometime the previous
night our mother had died, and he
had discovered the body when he'd
gone over to visit her and our father
with Margie Fogg. Pop was okay, but
kind of out of it. Worse than usual,
maybe, though no drunker than usual.
CUT TO:
Townspeople and friends cluster around the gravesite: Pop,
LaRiviere, Jack and Hettie, LaCoy, Chub Merritt, Nick, Jimmy,
Lillian, Jill and Horner, Rolfe, Wade and Margie.
ROLFE (V.O.)
The day of the funeral was almost
springlike. The snowline crossed New
Hampshire west to east, retreating
northward to Concord where it melted
by midmorning.
Rev. Doughty finishes. The mourners exchange farewells. Wade
looks at Lillian. Margie and Rolfe, escorting Wade's father,
let him be. He walks over, hugs Jill.
JILL
Dad.
WADE
(to Lillian)
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay
for a while?
Lillian hesitates, shakes her head 'no.'
WADE
You ever come to your father's grave
anymore?
LILLIAN
No, not anymore. It's too... it's
too far.
WADE
We should talk.
LILLIAN
We've done all our talking, Wade.
WADE
It's just...
LILLIAN
Let the past be.
(beat)
I'm sorry about your mother. I liked
her. You never know how much women
like that suffer. It's like they
live their lives with the sound turned
off -- and then they're gone.
JILL
(tugging at Lillian)
Mom.
LILLIAN
She has an ice-skating lesson at
four.
JILL
I'm taking ice-skating, Daddy!
He kisses Jill, says goodbyes, walks back to Rolfe and Margie.
Ahead, LaRiviere walks with Jack.
CUT TO:
Wade and Rolfe leave Margie and Pop in the kitchen as they
step out back.
WADE
Let's dig out Pop's truck before the
skin of the snow freezes up.
They grab snow shovels propped against the porch, walk to
the barn. Firewood's stacked alongside.
CUT TO:
Wade walks in as Jack and Jimmy prepare to head out, their
drilling rig loaded with pipe. Gordon yells at Jack:
LARIVIERE
Put out that fucking cigarette!
Jack opens the truck ashtray.
LARIVIERE
Not there, asshole. Flush it!
Hewitt trudges to the john.
WADE
Morning, Gordon.
LaRiviere smiles, goes to his office as Wade hangs his coat
in his locker. Jack cruises over.
JACK
I'm fucking out of here.
WADE
Lawford?
JACK
Out of this fucking job. This job
sucks. Working outside in the winter
sucks.
Jack gets in the cab of the drilling truck. Wade follows.
JACK
Open the door, will ya?
WADE
Why don't you quit now, you want out
so bad?
JACK
Open the door. We're late.
WADE
I mean it -- you got enough money
now. Head out for California. Surf's
up, Jack, and you're digging wells
in the snow.
JACK
What do you mean I got money? I'm as
broke as you.
Wade grins, goes to activate the door.
WADE
Looney Tunes, Jack. Fucking Looney
Tunes!
The drilling truck pulls out the garage, onto the road. From
the opposite direction a black BMW slows, enters. Mel Gordon.
Wade, all eyes and ears, watches. Mel Gordon parks in front
of the office, gets out. Elaine calls:
ELAINE (O.S.)
Mr. Gordon!
MEL GORDON
The boss in?
ELAINE (O.S.)
Yes indeedy!
Wade flips the door switch. Mel Gordon and LaRiviere talk.
Yeah.
CUT TO:
The South Main Street office of J. Battle Hand, lawyer.
Concord is a real town, with traffic, stores, people with
places to go.
CUT TO:
Fairlane squad car in its customary spot.
CUT TO:
Wade, driving Gordon's 4x4 with running lights and roll bar,
takes 29 toward Pop's farm.
A pickup passes him: Jack Hewitt's burgundy Ford. Wade stops.
Jack turns up Parker Mountain -- the road to the accident
scene. Something's up.
Wade turns and follows. Jack's fresh tracks lead the way.
Hewitt is driving fast. Wade keeps up.
Jack, far ahead, approaches the accident scene. Stops. Night
has fallen.
Wade comes over a low rise, spots Jack's pickup. He kills
the lights, parks to block Jack's exit.
Silence. Footsteps in the snow. Wade watches, listens. What's
he doing? Looking for evidence?
The burgundy pickup engine suddenly ROARS -- Jack's back and
at the wheel -- the tires squeal, spit snow as he spins past
Wade.
Wade starts his engine, gives pursuit. The pickups gun their
engines, bumper to bumper, down mountain roads, lumber roads,
rocky trails. Wild headlamps their only guide.
CUT TO:
A trail turns sharply past a shallow beaver pond -- too
sharply for Jack. He crashes through a stand of skinny birches
straight out onto the pond. The pickup's momentum carries it
across the pond.
Wade drops into first gear, follows, his headlights reflecting
ice. He drives directly to Jack, bumper to bumper, headlight
to headlight. Jack sticks his head out:
JACK
You crazy sonofabitch! You'll sink
us both! Get off the fucking ice!
Get off!
Wade doesn't budge. Jack backs away; Wade inches forward.
Hewitt's trapped. Trees behind him. Neither truck has traction
on ice.
Jack steps out, swinging his fists wildly. Wade gets out.
Jacks grabs his rifle, points it:
JACK
I'll shoot you, Wade, I swear it!
I'll fucking shoot you dead if you
don't move away from that truck!
Wade backs off.
JACK
Don't move! I'll shoot you dead if
you move!
Jack gets back in his pickup, maneuvers it slowly around the
Dodge, crosses the ice and is gone.
Wade stands in darkness. The only sound his idling truck,
the wind. Then a third sound -- the snap of ice. Ice cracks
ripple from the middle of the pond. Ice planes tip around
the truck.
LaRiviere's snazzy Dodge slips, descends, disappears.
Headlights glow under water, then go out. "Our Business Is
Going In The Hole."
Wade, alone in darkness, plops into the water, paddles to
shore. Freezing, he finds Jack's tire tracks in the snow. He
bangs his jaw.
CUT TO:
A car drops Wade off. "Home Made Cooking."
CUT TO:
Wade drives Margie's car toward LaRiviere's. In his rear
view window he spots Chick Ward driving Chub Merritt's tow
truck, lights blinking, pulling LaRiviere's pickup like a
dead fish.
He pulls over, lets it pass. He's parked in front of Alma
Pittman's house. A sign on the lawn reads, "Alma Pittman,
Town Clerk."
He looks at the house, decides to go in. Wade walks up the
shoveled steps, knocks on the door. ALMA, 60, wearing plaid
shirt and slacks, greets him with a smile:
ALMA
Wade! Come in! Have a cup of coffee.
CUT TO:
Gordon LaRiviere examines his damaged pickup outside the
Shell station.
CUT TO:
Phone conversation continues as Wade drives to Merritt's
Shell station.
WADE (O.S.)
To help, Jack, of course -- and to
nail those sonsofbitches, the Two
Gordons. That's what Alma calls them.
Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
ROLFE (O.S.)
Take care of the little things first,
the things that are distracting you
from taking care of the big things.
Call Chub Merritt, get your car back,
call a dentist, for God's sake, and
get your tooth pulled, don't trust
the locals, get your facts straight
and go straight to the state police.
Let them work on this.
CHICK WARD, 30, Chub Merritt's mechanic, greets Wade outside
the station. We join their conversation:
CHICK
The good news is we haven't got to
your car yet. The bad news --
WADE
Just tell me when you'll have it
fixed.
CHICK
-- the bad news is there's a problem
with Gordon's truck what somebody
drove through the ice last night.
Figured you'd know something about
that, Wade.
WADE
(beat)
Yeah. I know about that.
CHICK
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay
for the fixin' of your car. A couple
hundred for the clutch. I got some
more bad news. Wanna hear it?
WADE
Tell me.
CHICK
Chub says you're fired.
WADE
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already
did that this morning.
CHICK
He's a Selectman. The town. He said
to tell you to turn your badge in
and clean out your office. I'm
supposed to pull the CB and police
light out of your car. They're town
property.
CUT TO:
Wade spits blood into the snow as he grabs a gallon can of
gasoline from under the porch.
He crosses to the barn, prepares to pour the gas into the
beat-up red truck.
CUT TO:
Wade's Ford pickup passes J. Battle Hand's office, keeps
going. Grass peeks through the snow at this lower altitude.
CUT TO:
Wade parks the truck, walks past leafless bushes to a charcoal-
gray split-level with pink shutters. He pushes the door bell;
the first notes of "Frere Jacques" play.
Lillian opens the door; Jill's footsteps approach.
LILLIAN
Wait there. She'll be right out.
(looks back)
Is there snow on the ground up in
Lawford?
WADE
Yeah, lots.
LILLIAN
(to Jill)
See. Get your boots.
WADE
Hi honey.
JILL
(going back inside)
Hi.
LILLIAN
Have her back tomorrow night by six.
WADE
No problem. Look, I...
LILLIAN
You make me sick. I can't believe
you've sunk so low.
WADE
Low as what? What have I done? It's
bad to want to see your own daughter?
LILLIAN
You know what I'm talking about. For
what you're doing to me and to the
child you say you love so much. Love.
You won't get away with it.
Jill returns, wearing parka and boots, heads out with her
father.
LILLIAN
Bye, honey! Call me tonight if you
want.
Wade and Jill approach the truck.
JILL
Are we going in this?
WADE
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll
be fine.
JILL
It's pretty old.
WADE
It belongs to Pop.
JILL
Pop?
WADE
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
JILL
Oh.
Wade opens the truck door. Jill climbs in with her overnight
bag, looks back to the door where Lillian watches.
CUT TO:
The Ford heads north.
WADE
(winking)
How about a Big Mac?
JILL
Mommy won't let me eat fast food.
You know that. It's bad for you.
WADE
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big
Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your
favorite. What do you say?
JILL
No.
WADE
What do you want, then?
JILL
Nothing.
WADE
You can't have nothing, Jill. We
need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
JILL
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
WADE
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge
today, though.
JILL
Okay. So we'll get what you want.
What do you want?
They stop for a light. Silence.
WADE
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait
till we get home. Maybe we'll stop
by Wickham's for a hamburger when we
get to Lawford. That suit you? You
always like Wickham's.
JILL
(looking ahead)
Okay.
WADE
Fine.
Pause. Wade looks over at Jill and realizes she is crying.
WADE
Oh, Jesus, Jill, I'm sorry. What's
the matter, honey?
She shoves her clenched fists hard against her legs.
WADE
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
JILL
(regains composure)
What are you sorry for?
WADE
I don't know. For the food business.
I guess. I just thought, you know,
we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like
we used to.
JILL
I want to go home.
WADE
(quick)
You can't.
Jill looks away. Wade pulls a six-pack from under the seat,
pulls off a beer, takes a swig.
JILL
(quiet)
That's illegal, you know.
WADE
I know.
JILL
You're a policeman.
WADE
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing
anymore.
JILL
Oh.
CUT TO:
Jill waits in the old red truck parked outside.
Wade emerges with cardboard boxes of office miscellany, rifles
laid across top. He shoves the boxes and guns into the back
of the pickup, gets in and drives off.
CUT TO:
Wade and Jill pull up the drive, past Margie's car, into the
barn. Her trunk and two side doors are open.
Margie comes out back with a battered suitcase, goes to her
car. She's leaving. A plastic bag of clothes sits in the
trunk.
Wade and Jill get out, approach:
WADE
Going somewhere, Margie?
MARGIE
I'm just cleaning out some of this
stuff that's built up. For the rummage
sale. And some things for the
cleaners. And the laundromat.
WADE
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me,
I can see that.
MARGIE
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
Jill, suitcase in hand, looking pathetic, tries to smile. A
sadness passes over Wade's face.
WADE
(hurt)
Marg.
Margie, watching him, quivers, starts to cry. She drops her
suitcase, out of nowhere bawling like a baby.
Wade goes over, puts his arms around her, pats her back. His
face is racked. He, too, seems about to cry -- if he could.
In his arms Margie feels trapped, overwhelmed by Wade's
circumstances and terrible sadness. She pushes:
MARGIE
(crying)
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!
She struggles in Wade's grasp. Jill, frightened, wildly hits
him from behind:
JILL
Leave her alone! Leave her alone!
Wade moves back like a bear, covering his face and arms.
Jill, near hysterical, keeps after him, arms and fists flying.
Wade stumbles backwards into the snow. Jill still swings.
Margie dashes to intervene as Wade swings his arms wide.
Jill flies into Marg. Her nose is bleeding. Wade's caught
her across the mouth and nose. She takes cover behind Margie,
crying.
Margie and Jill stand side by side, saying nothing. Wade
looks up stunned, as if hit by a rock. Marg slowly backs
away, her arms behind her holding Jill.
MARGIE
(to Jill)
Get in.
Marg eases Jill into the front seat, closes the door, edges
around the car slamming the trunk and gets into the driver's
seat. Wade stands.
JILL
I want to go home. Will you take me
home?
MARGIE
Yes.
She closes the front door, starts the car. She backs out the
drive.
In her rear view mirror she sees the image of Wade receding,
standing frozen, staring down at the snow. Pop emerges from
the house, looks at his son, grinning.
Wade looks at his old man, that dumb devilish grin plastered
on his father's face. Glen Whitehouse holds an empty whiskey
bottle like a pistol.
Hunters' gunshots echo in the distance.
POP
(Satanic delight)
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.
(points bottle)
Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I
know you. You're a goddamn fucking
piece of my heart!
WADE
(dead)
You don't know me. You don't know
me!
(beat)
So fuck you. Fuck you.
POP
Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally
done it! Like a man done it. Done it
right. I love you, you mean
sonofabitch!
Pop holds up the bottle, pretends to fire it at Wade.
WADE
Love! What the fuck do you know about
love?
POP
Love! I'm made of love!
WADE
Call it what you want.
POP
Everything you know is from me.
WADE
Yeah.
POP
Bang!
WADE
You and me.
Wade waves his old man off, trudges toward the barn.
POP
Where the Christ you going? You
sonofabitch, you leave my fucking
truck where it is! I need... Give me
the Goddamn keys! I need to get me
to town!
WADE
Crawl!
POP
Nothing in the fucking house to drink.
Not a fucking thing. My house, my
money, my truck -- stolen!
WADE
I don't know you. My goddamn father
and I don't know you.
Wade walks from the glistening snow into the dark barn.
CUT TO:
Wade stands in snow and sunlight. The entire barn is engulfed
in flames. Black smoke billows through the clear winter sky.
Inside Glen Whitehouse, a pyre, burns.
ROLFE (V.O.)
The historical facts are known by
everyone -- all of Lawford, all of
New Hampshire, some of Massachusetts.
Facts do not make history. Our
stories, Wade's and mine, describe
the lives of boys and men for
thousands of years, boys who were
beaten by their fathers, whose
capacity for love and trust was
crippled almost at birth and whose
best hope, if any, for connection
with other human beings lay in an
elegiac detachment, as if life were
over.
CUT TO:
Pop's red truck is parked behind Jack Hewitt's 4x4 on a snow-
banked road. Wade, hunting rifle pointed up, traces Jack's
footsteps down the slope of the mountain.
ROLFE (V.O.)
It's how we keep from destroying in
turn our own children and terrorizing
the women who have the misfortune to
love us; how we absent ourselves
from the tradition of male violence;
how we decline the seduction of
revenge.
Wade spots Jack poised in a spruce grove, watching for deer.
Wade bolts his rifle, releases the safety, aims and FIRES.
Jack, hit in the chest, falls bleeding between trees. Blood
stains the snow.
ROLFE (V.O.)
Jack's truck turned up three days
later in a shopping mall in Toronto.
Even without the footprints, the
bullet, Wade's utter disappearance
seemed evidence enough of his guilt.
CUT TO:
