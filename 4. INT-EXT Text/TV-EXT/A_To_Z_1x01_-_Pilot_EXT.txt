      MAIN TITLES. The ALPHABET fills the screen. Then the 
        multicolored letters scramble and shift. Letters POP forward, 
      and with each pop we see a brief glimpse of Andrew and 
      Zelda s relationship - the embraces and fights, the highs and 
      lows, finally landing on this week s episode:  A  

       A IS FOR ACQUAINTANCES 


      You know the Water Garden in Santa Monica? It s like that. 


      Andrew walks quickly up the sidewalk.

                                  ANDREW S THOUGHTS (V.O.)
                    Don t come on too strong. You don t 
                    want to scare her off. 

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:

      Zelda, moving the opposite direction on the same street.                                                                                     13.


                                    ZELDA S THOUGHTS (V.O.)
                    Don t get all controlly. Don t want 
                    to freak him out. 

      - On Andrew.

                                  ANDREW S THOUGHTS (V.O.)
                    First thing, don t insist on buying 
                    her drinks. That s a slippery slope 
                    all the way to Smotherville.

      - On Zelda.

                                    ZELDA S THOUGHTS (V.O.)
                    And don t do that thing where you 
                    insist on buying your drinks. Let 
                    him do it. It doesn t mean he s 
                    running your life. 


      A duplex off Fairfax that looks awfully familiar...

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    Stephie and Zelda are roomies in 
                    the same building where Laverne and 
                    Shirley lived when they moved to 
                    Los Angeles.

      Zelda and Stephie walk down the steps in unison and run away 
      ala Laverne & Shirley.

                    This never gets old to them. 


      Only two lights on in two windows.


      Andrew and Zelda are visible at the bar, enjoy themselves as 
      many in the bar sing along. They pull closer. We pull back...
