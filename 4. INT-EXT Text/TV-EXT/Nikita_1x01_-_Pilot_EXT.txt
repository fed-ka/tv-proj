      We reveal the legs and lips belong to NIKITA (27), who 
      reclines in a chaise lounge, her swimwear drawing gazes as 
      she stares out over an infinity pool.  She sets down her 
      mojito and picks up a camera, looking every inch the exotic 
      resort beauty promised in travel and leisure magazines.  

      In fact, the whole scene looks like it s out of a magazine - 
      glossy, saturated, hyper-real.  

      Nikita wanders near the pool taking pictures.  She dazzles in 
      a haute couture sunhat, Prada shades, and bikini by Sauvage. 
      An iPod nano is strapped to her arm.

      Nikita FRAMES a shot of a swarthy BILLIONAIRE in a hot-tub.  
      We say Billionaire because that s how much he d need to 
      afford the bathing BEAUTIES that flank his grossness.    

      Nikita snaps the pic, but before she knows it, a BODYGUARD 
      accosts her.  We say Bodyguard because he is toned, terse, 
      and dressed a little too warm for the heat.  He says 
      something in a foreign tongue (Belgian) and takes her camera, 
      deletes the picture she just took.

                                  NIKITA
                    Hey!  Give me that!

                                    BILLIONAIRE
                    Bresso.  Bresso.

      Bodyguard turns.  Billionaire trades some Belgian with him.

                                  NIKITA
                    Um, could I get security here?

      Billionaire laughs, rises from the tub against the protest of 
      his concubines.  He approaches Nikita, smiling and dripping.                                                                                      6.


                                    BILLIONAIRE
                    No need for that.  Bresso is 
                    security.  Just doing his job.

                                  NIKITA
                    Taking cameras from strangers?

                                    BILLIONAIRE
                    Only ones with pictures of me. Ms..

                                  NIKITA
                    Nikita.  I was just trying to get a 
                    picture of the ocean.

                                    BILLIONAIRE
                    Nikita.  Herge.  See, we re no 
                    longer strangers.

      He hands her camera back.  Nikita flashes a sheepish smile.

                                  NIKITA
                    I m sorry, I never recognize 
                      celebrities.  The whole flight down 
                    here I was sitting next to some 
                    rock star and we kept talking like 
                    I knew who he was, but I didn t.  
                    Still don t.   

      Herge smiles, says something to his bodyguard in Belgian, we 
      can pick out the words,  rock star. 

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    Anyway, I ll just...

                                  HERGE
                    No, no, you re right.  This is the 
                    best view.  Let us take a picture 
                    of you and the ocean.

                                  NIKITA
                    That s okay...

                                  HERGE
                    Nikita.  I insist.

      She laughs, flirty.  Herge says something to Bresso, who 
      forces a tight smile and extends his hand.  Nikita fiddles 
      the settings on her camera and hands it back to him with good 
      humor.  Herge s eyes take her in as she walks and turns back, 
      striking a sexy pose against the ocean.  Bresso frames her.

                                  HERGE (CONT D)
                    Perfect.                                                                                      7.


      Bresso presses the button.  Camera EXPLODES, knocking his 
      head back like he was cracked with a bat, killing him 
      instantly.  

      Nikita takes two deliberate strides toward a shell-shocked 
      Herge, STRAIGHT-ARMS his face, CUPS it, turns and BREAKS HIS 
      NECK over her shoulder.  Herge s body hits the ground by 
      Bresso s.  Nikita checks his pulse to make sure he s dead, 
      ignoring the screams of the girls in the hot tub.   

      Nikita runs for the edge of the infinity pool.  A steep slope 
      runs down the other side.  Waiting there are a pair of Tevas-
      like climbing shoes and a cable to help her descend.  

      She grabs the cable with one hand while inserting the 
      earpiece from her nano with the other and pressing a button.      

                                  NIKITA
                    This is Nikita, target is down!  I 
                    need extraction.

                                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
                          (filtered through radio)
                    Negative.  Extraction impossible.

                                  NIKITA
                    What?  Say again!

                                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
                          (filtered through radio)
                    You always had trouble listening, 
                    didn t you?  

                                  NIKITA
                    Michael, please!  I need to get out 
                    of here now!

                                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
                    You still don t hear me.  I told 
                    you-

      His voice is no longer over the radio.  Nikita looks up to 
      see Michael looking very out of place in a heavy black coat, 
      balancing on the edge of the infinity pool.  The way he is 
      balancing there is surreal and impossible.  

      He is pointing a gun at her.  He whispers, but the sound 
      ECHOES across the sky, deafening.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    There is no out.

      The blue sky above Michael SHIFTS into dark, nightmarish 
      STORM CLOUDS.  He pulls the trigger. BLAM!                                                                                      8.



      Title: Roselle, New Jersey -- Nikita.  

      Nikita gets off the bus.  She walks off with no bag.


      One step above a trailer park.  Nikita collects herself on 
      the porch and rings the doorbell.


      Nikita s shoes tromp through the grass around headstones.  

      She slows as she finds the headstone she is looking for.  
      Daniel Monroe, Beloved Son, 1981-2007.  

      Nikita steadies herself.  She has never been here before.  
      There are week-old flowers resting on the grave.  Nikita 
      kneels, and picks one up.  Thumbs the petals. 

                                  DANIEL (V.O. PRE-LAP)
                    I m not asking annoying questions, 
                    okay?  I m giving annoying advice.

      A bittersweet POP SONG lulls us into...


      Nikita, tears in her eyes, takes off her ring. 

      She begins to bury the ring in the grass.


      Without sound, a Soccer-Mom looking Chevy Trailblazer pulls 
      up to the entrance and five AGENTS alight, weapons concealed 
      beneath plain clothes.  

                                  AMANDA (V.O.)
                    Sometimes you need to be soft.


      ALPHA TEAM (we recognize them from the izod crew) move 
      through the cemetery like wraiths, closing in on Nikita from 
      45 degree angles.  Hand signals - target is low.    

      They rise above the gravestones, weapons spitting silent FIRE 
      and ventilating the BLOW UP-DOLL draped in Nikita s jacket.

      The doll wheezes out its death rattle through puncture holes.

                                  BIRKHOFF (V.O.)
                          (over radio)
                    Target on the move!  North Gate!  
                    North Gate!

      Alpha team breaks into a charge to the North.


      The Trailblazer blazes out of the exit and down the road.

      FADE OUT


                                      END ACT TWO                                                                                    27.


                                      ACT THREE


      A shadow is slumped on top of a spring rider rocking horse.

      High beams illuminate Birkhoff as two S.U.V. s roll up quick 
      onto the deserted playground.  Birkhoff, alive and super duct-
      taped to the horsie, winces under the blinding glare.  Again. 

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    Ow.  Bright. 

      Michael and two teams of Agents fan out from the vehicles.

                                  BIRKHOFF (CONT D)
                    She s long gone, guys.                                                                                    33.


      They ignore Birkhoff, securing the area first and scanning 
      with nightvision goggles, searching for Nikita.

                                  BIRKHOFF (CONT D)
                    HELLO! Get me offa this thing!

      He angrily rocks back and forth.


      To establish.  35 floors of stylish hotel.


      The Bodyguards frisk the ROOM SERVICE GUY, check the food 
      before wheeling the table in themselves.  

      Room Service Guy reaches into his vest and 3 GUNS come out. 
      He freezes.  He was just going for the check.

      WAY DOWN THE HALLWAY

      ROAN, disguised as a Maintenance Man, steps into the alcove 
      by the Ice Machine, keys a mic in his shirt cuff.

                                  ROAN
                    Food s in.  Move them.


      Roan runs down the street.  He can see Safwani s limo.  It s 
      already turning on Broadway.  He ll never catch up.  

      He keeps running.


        Dramatically lit at night.  Safwani s Limo pulls to the curb.


      Our nation s capitol, case you didn t know.


      A long line of town cars are parked in the oval driveway/lot.  

      Michael walks past a cluster of chatting DRIVERS, approaches 
      a door where SECURITY GUARDS wand formally dressed GUESTS.  


      BOOM!  A parked TOWN CAR EXPLODES, shattering windows and 
      setting off car alarms. 

      Inside, lights FLICKER and SPRINKLERS ERUPT.  Guests SCREAM 
      and hit the floor.

      Michael picks himself up, looks to see Percy doing the same.  
      They look to the exit - fleeing guests are stampeding 
      through, overwhelming the covert agents.  Nikita is NOWHERE.

      Outside, People spill out across the street.


      A BLOCK DOWN, a Metro PD CRUISER sirens down the street, 
      cherries flashing.  SQUEALS to a stop as a woman stumbles out 
      in front of it.

                                  NIKITA
                    Help!  Help me!

      Nikita is limping, shoes off, dress torn, victim of a bomb 
      blast.  The OFFICER jumps out in first responder mode.    

                                    OFFICER
                    Ma am, are you alright?

                                  NIKITA
                    No, I m not!  Someone set off a 
                    bomb, and this dress was a rental!  
                    Now look at it!                                                                                    55.


      He looks down at her body as he enters trapping range and 
      Nikita STRIKES, disarming his MAGLITE and knocking him out 
      with it.  She takes his radio, leaves everything else.

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  I ll make sure this gets 
                    back to you...

      She hops in his car, reverses it, 180 s, and drives off!


      The town car is on fire, people running everywhere.  Michael 
      is not running.  He scans the scene deliberately, watching 
      AGENTS checking behind bushes, shining lights under cars.

                                  AGENT
                    Can t have gone far.  Metro PD is 
                    forming a ten block perimeter.  She 
                    won t get through.

      Michael nods, Agent exits.  Michael looks at METRO CRUISER 
      pulling up, then another one.  He pulls his cell phone.


      Nikita s police car pulls into an alley and goes dark.  She 
      gets out, closes the door, walks fast to a DUMPSTER.  Reaches 
      in and pulls out a garbage bag.  Inside is a change of 
      clothes.  First thing she takes out are running shoes.

      She is just getting the second one on when a CAR whips into 
      the alley from the opposite end, and brakes.  

      Nikita heads to the cop car.  We can see the shotgun inside, 
      courtesy of the headlights behind her.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Nikita.

      She stops.  Turns, knowing what she is going to see:

      Michael, alone, pointing a gun at her.

      FADE OUT.

                                        ACT SIX


      The headlights from Michael s car dramatically cast his 
      shadow over Nikita, and throws hers up against the wall.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Get down on the ground.  Slowly.  
                    Spread your arms and legs.

                                  NIKITA
                    Just like old times, huh?

      She doesn t move.  Michael shakes his head.

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    Just admit it, you re a little 
                    proud right now.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Of you, yeah.  Some impressive 
                    moves back there.

                                  NIKITA
                    Yay for me.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m serious, Nikita.  You may be 
                    the best we ever trained.

                                  NIKITA
                    Guess you should ve thought about 
                    that before you murdered my 
                    boyfriend in his sleep.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I didn t know anything about that.  
                    That was Division...

                                  NIKITA
                    No!  You don t get to do that.  He 
                    was innocent.  And if I blame *
                    anyone I blame you, because you  *
                    knew that.  You knew how it would  *
                    destroy my life. *

                                    MICHAEL *
                    It wasn t your life, it was your  *
                    cover.  You were allowed to have  *
                    your  boyfriend  because it helped  *
                    the cover seem real.                                                                                    58.


                                  NIKITA
                    You promised as long as he didn t 
                    know anything, he would be safe. *

                                    MICHAEL *
                      I promised nothing.  I warned you 
                    not to get emotionally attached.

                                  NIKITA
                    You mean the way you did?  With me?

      Nikita moves toward him, gently.  He thumbs the hammer back. *

                                    MICHAEL
                    Don t.

      She stops.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Percy never asked me about Daniel, 
                     cause he knew I would warn you. I 
                    did warn you when it was time to 
                    run.  I m trying to protect you, 
                    can t you see that?

                                    NIKITA*
                    Then why are you standing in my 
                    way?  Protecting them.

                                  MICHAEL*
                    Because attacking them is suicide.  
                    Play that game, you will lose.

                                    NIKITA*
                    Not if you play it with me.  I know    *
                    you re not blind to what Division s  *
                    become.  It used to be the lesser  *
                    evil, now Percy s driven it into  *
                    the lead.  *

                                  MICHAEL*
                    I thought you were in this for  *
                      revenge... *

                                  NIKITA
                    I m doing this because no one else  *
                    can.  Daniel being gone just means  *
                    I ve got nothing to lose.  Revenge  *
                    won t bring him back, just like it  *
                    won t bring your family back.  *

                                    MICHAEL
                    Leave my family out of this. *                                                                                    59.


                                  NIKITA *
                    But isn t that why you re in this?   *
                    To avenge them?

                                    MICHAEL *
                    This isn t about me. *

      But Michael is wavering.  Nikita softens, takes another step. *

                                  NIKITA
                    You were good to me, Michael. We 
                    were good... together.  Whatever 
                    hold Percy has over you, whatever 
                    you feel you owe him... let it go.

      Michael considers her for a long beat.

                                    MICHAEL
                    You know I can t.

                                  NIKITA
                    Then let me go.  Or stop me now.*

      Michael lowers his gun.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I ll let you get a head start.  If 
                    we meet again... I can t promise 
                    what ll happen.

                                  NIKITA
                    I can.

      Nikita pulls a .25 strapped to her thigh and SHOOTS Michael 
      just under the shoulder.  He s knocked to his knees. 

      Nikita walks up, keeping him in her sights.

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    It s a good wound.  They ll believe 
                    you tried to stop me.

      She picks up his gun from the ground.  Shrugs.

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    Just trying to protect you.

      Nikita runs to Michael s car, gets in and reverses it out of 
      the alley as he slowly stands.  The headlights pull out, 
      dropping him into darkness.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                    60.
