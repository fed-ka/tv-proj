Sam, still in his white apron, walks down the busy street.
He has a fast, loping gait that doesn't slow or hesitate for
anyone. A COUPLE argue on the sidewalk.
Sam WALKS RIGHT
BETWEEN THEM.
SAM
It's time.
It's time.
Sam keeps moving, he crosses the street without stopping.
Traffic SCREECHES to a HALT!
Cars HONK, a taxi driver YELLS.
SAM (CONT'D)
It's time, it's time for you to go.
Sam, holding the baby, and Becca, having just checked out,
walk down the steps of the hospital holding their
complimentary plastic baby bag.
Sam is nervous haling the
precious cargo and Becca is agitated.
They see the bus
pulling up and down the street and Sam moves quickly so they
can hurry and catch it.
As he approaches the bus, he looks
to Becca by his side, but she is not there.
He looks around
and no sign of her.
Frantically turning in a full circle, he sees the fabric of
her dress disappearing into the crowd down the street.
He
screams.
SAM
Becca!
Becca!
The more he screams the faster she moves away.
Till there's
no trace of her.
Sam stands in the middle of the busy block
holding Lucy to his chest, devastated.
We hear, "Look for the girl with the clouds in her eyes, but
she's gone."
SMASH CUT TO:
ANNIE has her door open a crack.
Annie feels the baby's
forehead.
Lucy stares up at her, quiet now, fascinated.
ANNIE
She's overheated and not eating enough.
How often are you feeding her?
SAM
A lot, Gerber, Carnation, Gerber.
ANNIE
What's a lot?
SAM
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Three
squares hot.
ANNIE
Babies need food every two hours, Sam.
SAM
Oh.
I'm sorry Lucy Diamond.
ANNIE
What time does the little diamond wake
up?
SAM
She never really goes to sleep.
ANNIE
Okaaaay.
Well, let's assume she's up at
six.
Keep your TV on Nickelodeon.
I
want you to feed her first while
"Bewitched" is on.
Then again, when
"Hogan's Heroes" starts.
After that,
well until "Father Knows Best..."
CUT:
An empty bus makes its way through the city at night.
A beautiful blue sky.
And "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"
continues as Lucy's THREE YEAR OLD laughing face SWINGS INTO
FRAME on a swing then DISAPPEARS out THE OTHER END OF FRAME.
Now Lucy SWINGS BACK DOWN and out of the other end again...
Sam's FACE, glowing with delight, APPEARS AGAINST THE SKY and
then disappears.
Sam and Lucy are on swings surrounded by
MOTHERS and KIDS at the park.
LUCY (V.O.)
Daddy, where does the sky end?
SAM (V.O.)
Let me see, let me see.
I've never been
there but they say it's somewhere near
China.
Lucy FLIES INTO FRAME, now FOUR, sitting on Sam's lap,
swinging.
LUCY (V.O.)
Are lady bugs only girls or are there
boys, too.
And if there are, what are
they called?
SAM (V.O.)
The Beatles.
Then Lucy FLIES INTO FRAME, now FIVE, followed by Sam.
LUCY (V.O.)
Do I look more like you or Mommy?
ON SAM'S FACE
He knew this moment would come.
Those new little brown shoes walking in between four pairs of
man's shoes.
We move up from those shoes to see FIVE PAIR OF
HANDS tightly clasping their balloons as they march
victoriously down the street.
We MOVE IN on Lucy's little
brown shoes skipping with joy and --
DISSOLVE TO:
Those same little shoes in the midst of a mass of black
soccer cleats.
We move up and see Lucy in the middle of a
fierce kids soccer game.
Score's tied.
The ball comes to Lucy.
She kicks and misses.
From the sidelines we hear:
SAM
Beautiful kick!
Very close!
Lucy looks up at her dad proudly.
The ball comes again.
Nobody could miss this one.
But Lucy does.
SAM (CONT'D)
Thatta girl!
Thatta girl!
They're
getting scared now!
The game continues.
The GOALIE'S FATHER, DUNCAN RHODES,
handsome, commanding and dressed in a suit, calls to his son:
MR. RHODES
C'mon, Conner!
On your toes!
They're
all counting on you!
Conner tenses up, alert under the pressure.
Meanwhile, down
at the other end, the ball heads toward Lucy.
She kicks it!
Hard.
Right into her team's own goal.
The crowd GROANS.
SAM
Hurray, Lucy!
You're getting the hang
of it now!
You've got them scared now!
Lucy's bursting with confidence, plows toward the ball and
NAILS IT!
The ball goes flying.
The parents in the stand
are completely baffled!
Sam is completely ecstatic!
SAM (CONT'D)
L-u-c-y!
That's our battlecry!
The ball heads into the goal, just passing the goalie,
Conner.
Sam runs to embrace Lucy when he hears Duncan
reaming his son --
MR. RHODES
The whole game was right in front of
your nose!
I leave work early to watch
you blow the whole game!?
Conner slouches against the fence as his father walks away.
Seeing this, Sam whispers to Lucy.
Sam, in sunglasses, waits for the BUS.
A YOUNG WOMAN, LILY,
sits down next to him.
The WIND CATCHES her floral dress
that's just left of innocent; just right of alluring.
She
reads a TABLOID.
LILY
Look here.
"Premature baby claims he's
cupid - has the arrow to prove it."
Do
you believe that?
SAM
Well, if he has the arrow.
LILY
Yeah.
You got a good point.
She crosses her legs.
A tuft of pink dress falls on Sam's
knee.
SAM
You're a good reader.
LILY
Yeah, I've always been smart.
SAM
You're lucky.
I'm looking for a smart,
good mother.
LILY
I can be a mother.
A real good mother.
SAM
Oh, good.
Good.
LILY
I could even spank you.
SAM
Oh no no no.
I don't believe in that.
LILY
Okay okay.
I can be very gentle.
SAM
Gentle.
Gentle.
Yes.
Do you tell
stories?
LILY
I got stories up the wazoo.
Why don't
you come with me.
I'll tell you a nice
story.
SAM
I have to pick up Lucy at Annie's first.
LILY
A menage a toi?
SAM
French, French the language of France.
You could teach my daughter, Lucy.
LILY
Your daughter?!
Can't you pick her up
after?!
SAM
After?!
No no, Lucy comes too.
LILY
Whatever.
She takes Sam's hand, they move to get on the bus JUST AS
ANOTHER HAND brusquely lands on theirs.
COP
Not so fast.
You're under arrest.
Solicitation.
LILY
He wanted to bring his kid, I said no.
A lightbulb flashes and we --
SMASH CUT TO:
A police car pulls into the parking lot.
Sam and Margaret in
the back.
Sam and Margaret see Lucy's little feet dangling
from beneath the curtain of the photo booth.
SAM
I'll go get her.
MARGARET BROWN
It would be better if you stay here.
I'm sorry to say this, Mr. Dawson, it's
clear how much you love your daughter,
but we're going to have to remove Lucy
from your home.
Sam's baffled.
One cop places his hand on Sam's shoulder,
restraining him.
The OTHER heads toward the photo booth.
SAM
No, no no no.
It's her birthday!
It's
her birthday!
MARGARET BROWN
I know how hard this must be...
(cell phone rings)
...Hello, Betsy.
I'm scheduled to come
to your apartment at four.
No, not five
every two hours.
It's two every five
hours.
She only weighs thirty pounds
for chrissakes...
(back to Sam)
The city has given me the difficult task
of deciding when to intervene on behalf
of the child.
Unfortunately, I've
learned the hard way that it's better
too soon than too late.
For now the
court will decide what's in Lucy's best
interest.
Sam watches the cop's legs meet Lucy's under the curtain.
Suddenly, Sam screams from the deepest core of his being.
SAM
Run, Lucy, run!
We see LUCY'S FEET KICK the COP'S LEGS and wrestle out of his
grasp.
She flies out the booth, holding that balloon.
She
runs down the street, the balloon soaring into the sky - a
cop follows.
Sam struggles.
ON SAM
Reeling, devastated, we HEAR A JUDGE speaking:
JUDGE (O.S.)
Given the fact that the father was
arrested for solicitation, did not
cooperate with the police...
Sam waits for his transfer.
He sets the cake down on the
bench and takes out a piece of paper with directions written
on it.
The number 43 bus pull sup and Sam consults his paper
once more before jumping on, forgetting the cake.
The bus goes half a block before it SCREECHES to a halt.
Sam
jumps off and runs back for the cake, but the bus continues
on its way.
Moments later, the NUMBER 34 bus pulls up.
Flustered and worried about being late, Sam jumps on.
He
feels something cold on his hand, looks down, the box is
starting to leak ice cream.
Ifty sits across from Rita who attempts to take notes.
IFTY
Sam is a very concerned father.
He
always saves his money at Bank of
America.
Last year there was a lion on
the calendar.
This year a gazelle.
The
gazelle is national bird of Tunisia.
We
have clients, not customers.
At Bank of
America.
Bank on us.
He looks up at her, lost.
So is she.
IFTY (CONT'D)
What was the question again, please?
CUT TO:
Rita stands next to her Porsche.
There are Starbucks in
every direction she looks.
Sam, totally disoriented, walks in circles around the plastic
tunnels and jungle gym.
A flashlight shines in Sam's face.
COP
Hey, buddy.
No loitering.
Move it.
SAM
Not yet not yet not yet.
COP
You want me to get a black and white
down here?
He moves toward Sam.
SUDDENLY THE SPRINKLER SYSTEM goes on.
The cop backs off, but Sam doesn't move, standing in the
middle of the park and getting totally wet.
SAM
Not yet not yet not yet.
He shines the flashlight in Sam's face and we see INSIDE THE
PLASTIC TUNNEL where LUCY SLEEPS PEACEFULLY on a bed of
coats, holding a discarded stuffed animal.
COP
Jesus Christ.
SAM
She hasn't been sleeping well.
She
needs a good night's rest.
Let her
sleep, let her sleep.
(the cop moves toward Sam)
NO!
COP
What are you, crazy?
All the cop sees is a lunatic walking in protective circles
in the downpour of the sprinklers with a kid in a plastic
tunnel.
SMASH CUT TO:
Rita sits in her Porsche with Annie and Sam.
Annie is curled
into a tight ball in the passenger seat.
Sam is tucked into
the shelf in the back.
His legs kick Rita in the face with
every gear shift.
RITA
Thank you again, Annie.
You were truly
extraordinary.
SAM
Extraordinary.
Truly extraordinary.
Annie doesn't move.
RITA
Okay okay okay okay.
Well, Sam has his
big day on the stand tomorrow and we
need to work a little bit so that he's
as effective as you were.
SAM
Effective.
Very effective.
RITA
On a Porsche, the, uh, the door handle
is a little hidden by that thingamajig,
so if you're having a hard time finding
it I'll just --
Rita reaches across to open Annie's door when she SCREAMS!
ANNIE
Noooooooo!
SAM
Annie's not quite ready to go outside
yet.
RITA
Okay, we'll just take our time.
Rita and Sam enter.
Walking a hundred miles an hour, Sam barrels down the street
out of his mind.
Cars are jammed up.
He walks over them, a
man possessed.
Sam, broken, walks down the long hallway with Rita toward
Margaret Brown's office.
Suddenly, Rita stops as she and Sam
both see -
LUCY
Sitting, hopeful on the bench.
She searches Sam's face for
the verdict.
The minute she sees sorrow in his eyes, she
knows.
She runs to him, gluing herself to his chest.
LUCY
No Daddy!
No Daddy!
No Daddy!
In a SERIES OF WORDLESS DISSOLVES, they hold each other in
the hallway through the entire forty five minute visit.
The
only thing moving is the hands of a large wall clock in the
background.
Pained, Margaret reaches for Lucy.
MARGARET BROWN
C'mon, Lucy.
It's time to say goodbye.
LUCY
NOOOO!
Don't let go don't let go don't
let go -
Sam's tears mix with Lucy's as they sob, clinging to each
other.
With such fierce love; a parent and a child.
LUCY (CONT'D)
Don't let them Daddy don't let them!
Don't ever let me go!
He can't let her go.
That he can't do.
Margaret, steel
herself, turns to Rita, no matter how many times she's done
this.
MARGARET BROWN
Please help me.
Rita, aching from a place she thought she buried long ago,
shakes her head, NO.
Now, Margaret literally has to wrench
Lucy away from her father's arms.
Lucy bellowing as she
pulls her down the hallway.
Sam is frozen in incalculable
pain.
We hear "Fool on the Hill".
We follow a trail of PINK LIQUID
melting down the hall and come to Annie's door where a pile
of grocery bags and newspapers sit in a PUDDLE OF STRAWBERRY
ICE CREAM.
Suddenly, the needle SCRAPES LOUDLY across the
record, followed by a mysterious POUNDING against the wall.
Saturday in idyllic suburbia.
Sam, directions and a map in
his hands, tentatively rounds the corner.
A small bouquet of
flowers in his hands when he stops - STARING AHEAD AT --
REVERSE ANGLE
Lucy looking absolutely radiant in a new spring dress.
She
stands on the front porch with RANDY, who wears a red smock
and is setting up TWO EASELS AND PAINTS.
There's a tiny
chair for Lucy and a tiny chair for her.
CLOSE ON LUCY AND RANDY
The tension in Lucy's face, Randy straining to connect with
her.
RANDY
Your teacher told me you were an artist.
LUCY
You wear too much perfume.
You're
trying too hard.
RANDY
I am, aren't I.
Maybe you could teach
me how to paint.
LUCY
My daddy's coming today.
We're going to
open my birthday presents.
Why don't
you just go do something.
BACK TO SAM
From where he stands, all he sees is Lucy getting everything
she deserves.
He looks down at the tiny bouquet in his hand -
feeling profoundly inadequate, he reaches for some flowers
from a garden he's passing.
Puts them in his bouquet.
Then
stops.
Feels guilty.
Tries to put the flowers BACK.
He
stares up at Lucy on the porch a few houses away.
Lucy sits on the steps.
Randy sits right next to her.
BACK ON SAM
Where he WAS standing, but is now GONE.
The flowers lay in
the dirt.
From the porch, Lucy looks out and waits.
And
waits.
And waits.
Paints and brushes go FLYING across the porch as Lucy KNOCKS
THEM OVER.
Totally out of control.
LUCY
You gave him the wrong address!
You're
hiding me from him!
As Randy reaches for her, Lucy pours black paint on her.
Lucy sits in a ball on the corner of the porch.
Her eyes
swollen from crying.
Finally, she gets up and moves to the
tiny chair that Randy put out for her.
Straightens the easel
and begins to paint.
The front door opens and Randy comes out having washed her
face and hair.
Without speaking, Randy straightens her easel
and sits down next to Lucy and begins to paint.
Randy and
Lucy paint in silence for a long time.
Then -
LUCY
You're going to send me away now, aren't
you?
RANDY
(tenderly)
No.
We hear what sounds like a child's hand playing the song
"Here, There and Everywhere..."
With Lucy and Randy's hands as they PAINT side by side to
Sam's sad melody.
Lucy's pictures start ANGRY, angular with
blacks and blues, then GRADUALLY soften and the dark figures
recede.
By the END, there is a BRUSHSTROKE of the red of
Randy's smock peeking into the corner of Lucy's picture.
Rita stands there impatiently.
RITA
I don't have time for this!
You were
supposed to show up for your first
evaluation.
And I leave work early to
get there and where the hell are you?!
Open the door!
Sam!
Open the goddamn
door!
(nothing)
Alright.
If you don't care enough to
open the goddamn door I'm outta here!
I've ruined my practice, I've alienated
my colleagues - I sent my kid off on a
fishing trip with his father so I could
work with you and you won't open your
goddman door for me?!
Fine!
THAT'S IT!
I've had enough!
She starts down the hall when suddenly she turns and - with
the mastery of a karate black belt - RUNS AND KICKS the door
down.
Sam rounds the corner walking - or rather being walked by SIX
DOGS, all shapes, all sizes.
He heads up the walkway to
Randy's house.
She comes out of the house and shuts the door
behind her, stopping him.
RANDY
You're early.
SAM
All the lights were green.
RANDY
There's a reason for the court schedule.
You stopped showing up.
Lucy has had to
rebuild her life.
SAM
I want her back.
I can do it.
I know I
can.
RANDY
That's not up to me, but I'm telling
you, I will do everything in my power to
prevent Lucy from getting hurt again.
Sam hangs his head.
A dog barks at Randy.
RANDY (CONT'D)
Whose dogs are these?
SAM
Supplemental income supplemental income -
bathe, walk and feed.
Sam Dawson meets
your canine needs.
(to dogs)
Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit!
All the dogs sit but a BIG BLACK LAB.
Randy heads into the
house.
The front door opens and Lucy comes out.
She runs
down the stares to Sam.
Thrilled, Sam opens his arms to her.
She leaps into them and begins slugging his chest with pent
up fury.
LUCY
You never came!
You never even called!
You forgot about me!
How could you
forget me!
SAM
I never forgot you.
I forgot me.
SAM (CONT'D)
I hate you I hate you I hate you!
Lucy pulls away.
A long charged silence.
Lucy refusing to
even look at her father.
SAM (CONT'D)
Lucy, I tried to write you a letter last
night...
A BASSET HOUND SNEEZES.
SAM (CONT'D)
Gesundheit, Buster.
Buster has a cold.
But the letter had too many big words.
Pokey, sit.
The black lab has begun eating Randy's flowers.
Lucy stares
forward.
Sam speaks tentatively, carefully:
SAM (CONT'D)
Dear Lucy.
Pokey sit.
Dear Lucy, I'm
sorry that I hurt you.
Every moment of
the day I thought about you.
Lucy in
the hammock, Lucy at school.
Lucy in
the sky...XXOO.
Daddy.
P.S. I love
you, recorded September 11th, the day
you took your first step.
Lucy raises her head and looks at Sam for the first time.
Randy kisses Lucy goodbye as she heads toward school.
We
follow Lucy - suddenly a BIRD SAILS THROUGH THE SKY and LANDS
IN FRONT OF LUCY.
It's an ORIGAMI BIRD.
She looks around -
but doesn't see Sam anywhere.
But she feels him.
She walks
toward school, clutching the bird, past a tree and we move up
that tree and see Sam nestled in the branches.
There.
They
made contact.
It's later that week.
Lucy walks proudly down the street in
a GIRL SCOUT UNIFORM, selling cookies.
Randy is by her side,
beaming.
LUCY
We've made $22.36.
That's seven
dollars, 64 cents less than thirty.
RANDY
Well that's one way of looking at it.
DISSOLVE as they move through the neighborhood.
Finally we
see her bound up the steps to an apartment building.
She
knocks on the door.
It opens - and Lucy and Randy's JAW
DROPS.
REVERSE ANGLE
Sam stands there.
Holding three kittens.
WE see various
dogs in arm chairs, the couch...
LUCY
Daddy?!
RANDY
What are you doing here?
SAM
I live here.
This is where I live.
LUCY
This is where you live?
So close to me?
SAM
I wanted to be close to you.
I wanted
to be closer.
Look at my apartment
number.
(it's number 9)
John was born on October 9th.
His son
was born on October 9th.
LUCY
John met Yoko on November 9th.
SAM
His mother lived at 9 Newcastle,
Liverpool.
LUCY
Newcastle.
9 letters.
Liverpool - 9
letters...
RANDY
Lucy, give me one minute with your
father.
Sam, I consider myself an
understanding person but I don't
understand this.
You can't close the
distance between you and Lucy with a new
address.
We go to court in a week -
SAM
I don't want to spend half my visit with
Lucy on the bus getting to Lucy.
I
don't want to waste one more minute.
Buster sneezes.
LUCY
(from the doorway)
Does Buster still have his cold?
SAM
He's better, much better.
Now I'll have
one box of mint chocolate cookies.
LUCY
That'll be three-eighty six.
LUCY & SAM
(in unison)
Let me see let me see let me see...
That's one dollar and 14 cents less than
five.
Randy watches with a mixture of jealousy and fear as Lucy
effortlessly enters her and Sam's universe.
From the window, Randy watches as Sam hands Lucy four leashes
and the two of them get pulled down the street by the dogs.
"The night grows teeth..." stray dogs fight over garbage - a
wino talks to himself and in the midst of it all walks Lucy
in her pj's.
Mr. Jeeters tucked under her arm.
Lucy crosses
the street.
HONK!
the screeching of tires...
We're looking at an old fashioned fire escape when suddenly
we make out a figure climbing higher and higher.
It's Lucy.
We catch glimpses of her and then lose her as the neon sign
across the street blinks on and off.
Lucy climbing the fire escape!
Sam opens the window and
reaches for her.
SAM
Lucy Lucy.
What are you doing?!
You
could have really hurt yourself.
What
are you doing?
LUCY
I couldn't sleep.
Daddy, did you know
that Warren G. Harding was the twenty
ninth President of the United States?
SAM
No.
LUCY
Remember - the twenty-ninth President.
In case the Judge asks.
Sam, in his pajamas, holds a sleeping Lucy in his arms.
He
turns a corner and heads up the walkway to Randy's house.
He
knocks on the door.
Finally the door opens and we see Randy
and Bill in their pajamas SHOCKED at seeing Sam and Lucy.
SAM
She couldn't sleep.
RANDY
Give me my daugh -
(she stops herself)
Give me - I'll take Lucy.
SAM
Maybe if you rub her tummy twenty-three
times, tell her two stories and give her
half a Denny's blueberry muffin and a
third of a glass of milk she'll sleep.
Good night.
Randy and BILL, her husband, watch as Sam turns and walks
purposely down the walkway - his houseslippers scuffling on
the quiet street.
SERIES OF SHOTS AT 3:00 A.M. --
Lucy in her pj's walks down the middle of the street.
Lucy knocks on Sam's window.
Lucy and Sam walk back down the street to Randy's house.
Lucy lugs encyclopedias to Sam's windowsill.
Lucy in a blanket being carried by Sam toward Randy's house.
A glorious sunny day.
Lucy and her team are in the middle of
a fierce game.
A foul is called when we hear -
SAM
Penalty!
Rules broken.
Penalty,
please!
Sam, wearing a UNIFORM and whistle around his neck, walking
his inimitable walk, races up the field, COACHING THE TEAM.
Ifty, Robert and Brad sit in the bleachers.
Robert, in
sunglasses, paranoid, looking behind him.
Brad follows
around an attractive YOUNG WOMAN as close as he can get to
her.
Sam runs by the water stand, manned by Randy and Bill.
They share a look - a moment of intense parental pride.
Lucy
and a kid named PHILLIP go after the ball.
OBNOXIOUS MOM
Get her!
Phillip, you get her!
ROBERT
I saw that!
You gave him a secret
signal!
Didn't you?
IFTY
Keep both eyes on the ball, Lucy - balls
are round - on sale at Kmart.
The earth
is a ball, too...
Phillip steps in front of Lucy and shoves her as hard as he
can.
Sam blows his whistle repeatedly and races over.
SAM
Penalty!
Repeat!
Rules broken!
Penalty!
RITA (O.S.)
Penalty?!
Sue him!
Kick his ass outta
the game!
It's RITA!
With Danny - hollering from the stands.
ON LUCY
Looks over at her father.
Sam does every coaching gesture,
and referee hand signal from every sport known to man.
It
looks like a bizarre TWYLA THARP DANCE.
ON LUCY
She does it right back at him.
Their secret code.
The code
that will bind them for the rest of their lives.
ON THE CROWD AND PLAYERS
All watching.
What the hell was that?
Sam blows his
whistle.
SAM
Play ball!
Play ball!
The game heats up.
Lucy's team gets the ball and is headed
toward the goal.
Sam is running right alongside them, so
excited, until he can't hold himself back anymore and
intercepts the ball!
Sam runs valiantly down the field with
it!
We hear "Here Comes the Sun"...
Little darlin', it's been a long, cold lonely winter.
Little
darlin', it feels like years since you've been here.
Here
comes the Sun...Here comes the sun...And I say, "It's
alright..."
And the CREDITS ROLL.
FADE TO BLACK.
I am Sam
