Winter. Silence on the forest floor. Snow falling. Then the
sound of breathing. The soft footfall of a person running.
HANNA, fourteen years old, long hair, eyes like blue ice,
glides through the trees, a bow strapped to her shoulder. She
is dressed in animal skins and fur shoes. She blends almost
completely into the landscape of trees and snow.
She stops dead. Her breath visible in the freezing air.
Suddenly alert, she has spotted her prey. A REINDEER nuzzling
the snow, trying to unearth a patch of grass to eat. Its head
pops up - danger. Too late. The sudden swoosh and the snap of
an arrow piercing its skin.
The deer flops to the ground with a thud. It whines, its feet
dig at the earth. Its mouth gnaws at the icy air. Steam
pouring from its nostrils.
HANNA approaches, removes a fur glove. She bends to her
knees.
She reaches out and gently pets the animals frightened face.
She runs her hand down along its neck, in towards the wound.
HANNA
I just missed your heart.
She stands and pulls out an old pistol from her waist
holster.
She fires two shots directly at CAMERA.
CUT TO TITLE: HANNA
A knife enters the deer near its anus.
HANNA
(WHISPER)
Remove the penis and scrotum, make
a deep, circular cut around the
rectum.
HANNA pulls the knife up towards the brisket.
HANNA (CONT'D)
(WHISPER)
Cut from the rear to the brisket.
She works calmly without expression.
2.
The deer lies on it's side.
HANNA breaths hard. She reaches deep into the body cavity
and pulls out intestine, stomach, liver.
She freezes, sensing danger.
Her hand deep inside the animal. She listens. She looks out
into the still forest. No sound.
ERIK, mid forties, a mammoth with leathery face, stands
behind her like a ghost.
ERIK
You're dead. Right now. I've
killed you.
HANNA spins spraying deer-blood on to the snow and brings
her fist right to ERIK's face. He blocks and thumps an open
palm on to HANNA's shoulder sending her sprawling into the
snow.
She leaps to her feet, as ERIK aims a kick at her head. She
dodges, punches below his knee cap, and goes for her
pistol. ERIK slaps the hand away.
ERIK (CONT'D)
Use your hands!
She goes for the gun again and again he stops her.
He moves in tight, pulling the gun from its holster and
tossing it deep into the forest.
HANNA clips ERIK'S temple sending him to the ground.
She wraps her arms around his neck preparing to snap...
... but she can't.
He throws her over his shoulder into a pile of snow.
ERIK stands and wipes the snow from his pants. His face shows
a touch of frustration.
He plods into the forest.
ERIK (CONT'D)
Drag it back yourself.
HANNA drags herself to the deer's side. She stares at its
dead face.
3.
HANNA clears the kill site. Wipes the last dots of blood on
to a stick. No sign she was ever there.
HANNA drags the 200 lb deer on a makeshift sled. She lifts
her knees high and moves at a steady pace.
Hidden among the trees, a little way off, ERIK is watching
her.
A log cabin built around an ancient tree surrounded by the
thick forest. HANNA is standing in the snow, stripping the
deer with a knife. It's a tough job but she does it no fuss.
The morning sunlight slants through the forest.
ERIK is walking through the trees. He stops, raises his
pistol at a tree trunk some distance away and fires.
The tree breaks apart.
Another GUNSHOT breaks a tree apart.
Hanna fires. Another tree breaks apart. She rolls and
fires.
She rolls and fires. She reloads. And fires.
ERIK watching.
HANNA attacks ERIK. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. He defends
easily.
ERIK
Again.
They reset. She repeats the motion. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist.
ERIK (CONT'D)
Again.
Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. She's getting faster. Her strikes
are solid.
8.
A medium size log nailed along two pillars of the cabin
acts as a chin-up bar.
Erik and Hanna do chin-ups. Both are fit. Neither will give
up. ERIK observing HANNA's power. Both have the sense that
he is judging her. HANNA's face fiercely determined.
ERIK and HANNA sit with their backs to a tree in the huge
forest as they breathlessly recover from the exhaustion of
the exercise. HANNA speaks fast, reciting.
HANNA
I live in Leipzig. German city.
Population 0.7 Million people. We
live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I
go to school at the Klaus Kohle
Gymnasium and my best friends are
Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I
like literature and sport, in
particular tennis and athletics. I
have a dog called Trudi.
HANNA is running, racing ERIK. Fierce determination, almost
anger in her eyes. They reach the river and dive in.
HANNA and ERIK are swimming hard against the current of the
fast-flowing river, working at full pelt just to stay still.
They swim and swim, their muscles busting, their lungs
bursting.
ERIK
Don't give up! Don't give up!
HANNA's arms flails as she fights against the stream and she
screams in pain. She is grabbed under by the undertow and is
pulled downwards. For a second she is underwater and in
darkness but ERIK's hand pulls her back up and she breaks the
surface with a gasp of relief.
On the bank, HANNA climbs out. ERIK approaches her but
moodily, even angrily, she pushes him away.
HANNA
I didn't need your help.
9.
Her face sullen, she walks away into the forest. He stares
after her.
Outside, ERIK stands alone, thinking. An OWL swoops down to
catch a mouse then flies back up into the tree tops.
ERIK takes long lunging strides straight out from the cabin.
He counts his paces.
ERIK
One, two, three, four...
ERIK and HANNA are racing through the forest.
Over this we continue to hear ERIK counting his paces from
the previous scene.
ERIK (V.O.)
...five, six, seven, eight...
ERIK
...nine, ten.
After 10 paces, ERIK makes a 90 degree turn and enters the
tree line. The snow and mud crunch under his boots.
We continue to inter-cut the following with more close-ups of
HANNA training: climbing, fighting, chin-ups, shooting. All
the while we continue to hear ERIK counting out his paces.
After 40 paces, with the cabin light distant, ERIK falls to
his knees. He unsheathes a large knife and jams it into the
frozen earth.
HANNA comes out of the cabin, rubbing her eyes and yawning,
eating a hunk of cold meat.
She looks up to see a snow fox staring at her from the tree
line. She crouches and holds out what's left of her
breakfast.
The fox approaches gingerly, delicately.
HANNA
Hello little foxy... foxy loxy...
come on... come and share my
breakfast.
The fox comes to her and nervously accepts the scrap,
withdrawing a few feet to eat it. HANNA shuffles forward
carefully and gently pats the snow fox - it is only a cub.
11.
As the fox eats it makes low grunting noises which HANNA
expertly mimics - causing the fox to look up, puzzled - they
seem to have a genuine connection - as if they've done this
before.
Suddenly the snow fox freezes, pricks up its ears, looks up,
HANNA looks up too.
An aeroplane is approaching overhead. The fox darts back into
the undergrowth as the roar of the plane reverberates through
the forest.
HANNA jumps to her feet and with incredible speed and
dexterity climbs to the very top of a near by tree. The plane
roars over her head and disappears over the snowy wilderness,
oblivious to HANNA'S tiny presence.
It's only now that we see the full extent of HANNA'S
isolation.
HANNA comes out of the cabin and sits down on a tree trunk.
She sees the snow fox cub but says nothing. It comes over and
noses around the cabin, but HANNA'S mind is elsewhere.
HANNA
(whispering to herself)
Marissa Wiegler.
MARISSA, wearing a sharp business suit, drives a black Acura
into her designated spot in the CIA HQ's car park.
As she gets out, we see the parking space is designated for
MARISSA WIEGLER.
Her young male PA and TECH ONE are already waiting for her.
15.
TECH ONE
Ma'am. We've had a signal reported
by Interpol. We think it's Eric
Heller.
An unusual expression of shock on MARISSA'S face.
MARISSA
Well I'll be.
TECH ONE
It seems he's in Sweden. Jokkmokk.
40 miles out.
MARISSA
What the fuck is he doing there?
TECH ONE
Living in the middle of nowhere,
like the frigging Una Bomber.
MARISSA
The son of a bitch. Sweden?
Sweden?!
The PA hands her a coffee and she hands him some files.
TECH ONE
Apparently he turned on his
locator.
MARISSA
He's not an idiot.
TECH ONE
I know... I mean I believe so. But
that's what happened.
MARISSA
After 14 years in Jokkmokk, maybe
he'd rather go to prison.
ERIK comes out of the cabin carrying a small rucksack. He
closes the door behind him and takes a deep breath.
HANNA gets out of bed and goes to the small window.
19.
She watches as ERIK walks away from the cabin for the last
time.
Dusk in the forest as the flickering sun goes down. As
peaceful a place as you could imagine. A calm blueness of
impending night on the snow.
Then a series of ropes break the top frame and FIFTY US
SPECIAL FORCES dressed in white snow gear silently abseil
down to the ground.
Infra-red POV as the SPECIAL OPS TEAM head through the forest
wearing night vision-goggles. The Leader of the Operation
follows the tracker signal.
SPECIAL OPS
Is this guy one of ours?
HEAD OF OPS
Used to be. Tread carefully, he's
been in there a long time, he's
damaged goods, and he knows we're
coming.
We see through the infra-red vision the endless trees in the
pitch blackness.
The SPECIAL OPS FORCES get closer. They see the cabin in the
night. They approach. Silence in the darkness. Just the
breathing of men in the icy cold.
The HEAD OF OPS waves TWO SPECIAL OPERATIVES forward. The
rest of the forces surround the cabin, but at a distance.
The two men approach the cabin. One opens the door and the
other steps in. Then the first follows close behind. Both are
engulfed by darkness.
The rest of the forces wait in silence for a radio signal.
The HEAD of SPECIAL OPS looses patience and picks up the
radio.
HEAD OF OPS
McCullum? Do you read me?
No response.
HEAD OF OPS (CONT'D)
I repeat, do you read me?
The HEAD of OPS waves all thirty of his men closer to the
cabin. Guns at the ready.
The HEAD of OPS and five other men storm the cabin.
BLAZING SUN - HANNA's pale face appears, eyes crinkled shut.
Wider - HANNA emerges from a hole in the ground in the middle
of a sandblasted desert and slams the cover closed. Total
silence now, except for the whistle of the wind on sand. It
takes her eyes a moment to adjust to the blinding light.
Blearily she looks out across this alien environment.
After a moment her ears prick up. She turns just in time to
see a column of Military Jeeps rise over a sand dune in the
distance behind her. The jeeps are crawling straight towards
her, ominously shimmering in the desert heat. She quickly
ducks back down into her rabbit hole and waits.
In the middle of the desert the soldiers convene, looking for
HANNA. A military truck is stationery. Nothing around for
miles. We hear a military voice on a radio.
MILITARY VOICE (V.O.)
473 are you receiving me? Can you
confirm your position. Subject has
escaped.
The truck moves off a short distance and stops again.
Meanwhile a large convoy of Military Vehicles passes right
over HANNA. When it has past she sees the first vehicle
crawling to a halt right near the hole - just yards away.
One of the MILITARY PERSONNEL in the jeep gets out and goes
over to the hole, lifts the lid, inspects the darkness.
The Truck radio is on and we hear the voice.
MILITARY VOICE
Can you confirm your position 473?
Banks? Banks can you hear me?
32.
Once BANKS is satisfied he walks away a few paces, gets out a
pair of high powered binoculars, looks this way and that.
He walks up a dune and scans the dunes with his binoculars.
Finally he walks back and climbs into the Jeep, gets on the
radio.
BANKS.
I'm at a perimeter opening at the
far east wing. Something's not
quite right...
He doesn't notice but the lid is open now and the air-
conditioning duct is empty.
CUT TO:
As the Jeep moves off we see HANNA is clinging to the axle,
hanging upside down underneath. Her face is pressed to the
oily metal, her back just an inch from the desert floor
flashing beneath her.
The jeeps now take a track along the edge of a steep dune.
HANNA takes her chance and lets go of her grip. She clenches
her eyes shut as the jeep passes over her. As soon as the
jeeps clears she rolls herself over the edge of the dune.
HANNA rolls down the sand dune at speed until finally she
slows and stops. She lies still and shocked by the quiet as
the Jeep disappears into the distance. Then she sits up and
looks around herself. She has no conception of this
landscape, no idea where she might be.
FLASHBACK to 1995.
A much younger MARISSA watching a very fast-moving car on a
deserted forest road. She takes from her pocket a small
detonating device and as the car approaches a bend, presses
it.
33.
There is a small explosion and the car swerves off the road
and smashes headlong into a post. The horn starts to blare.
MARISSA approaches the car. The road is empty. MARISSA looks
through binoculars at the car.
She sees a woman, on the passenger side, head thrust forward.
JOHANNA ZADEK. Blood everywhere. MARISSA shoots her in the
head just to be sure. But the driver's seat is empty. MARISSA
stops dead.
Then the back door opens on the other side. A man, a younger
ERIK HELLER crawls out. He is holding a two year old child in
his hands. The child's coat is covered in blood.
MARISSA stares at the shocked child and takes the rifle to
her eye to shoot again. As she does, ERIK senses her movement
and throws himself to the ground.
Through the rifle viewfinder we see just a glimpse of ERIK
and the red glare of the coat covered in blood, ERIK HELLER
grabbing the child and sprinting for the forest,
MARISSA taking aim at HELLER, and then firing as HELLER dives
into the forest.
The sun has dipped a little now, the shadows of the dunes are
longer, but the heat is still intense.
HANNA's throat is parched by the dry heat, her pale eyes
scorched by the angry sun. She walks purposefully but with a
growing awareness of her tiny scale in this seemingly endless
sea of sand. She has no conception of this landscape, no idea
where she might be.
HANNA
(MUTTERING)
I live in Leipzig. German city...
0.7 Million people... I go to
school at the Klaus Kohle
Gymnasium... literature and
sport... I have a dog called Trudi.
34.
HANNA climbs a steep dune, eyes down, feet pounding. A shadow
falls across her path and she looks up to see the shape of a
GIRL standing at the top of the dune silhouetted by the sun.
HANNA's hand goes to the concealed gun.
The GIRL stares at HANNA. They must be about the same age
but there the resemblance ends. HANNA, dusty, bloodied and
bruised in military top, trousers and boots stares at this
perfect image of western adolescence. Dressed head to toe
in pink and drinking a can of coke, no concession to where
she is whatsoever. This is SOPHIE LYALL.
SOPHIE
Hello.
HANNA stares at her, then abruptly turns to walk in opposite
direction until she sees another convoy of US military trucks
in the distance.
SOPHIE (CONT'D)
All right?
HANNA turns back. Looks at SOPHIE. Like a wary animal.
SOPHIE (CONT'D)
Don't you speak English?
HANNA is unsure how to speak to this strange person.
SOPHIE (CONT'D)
That can't be helped. You look
terrible.
At that moment SOPHIE'S brother, MILES, eight years old,
rises over the dune and stands by SOPHIE'S side. In his hand
is a stills camera, not digital, film. MILES stares at HANNA
while talking to SOPHIE.
MILES
Who's she?
SOPHIE
I don't know. I just found her.
MILES
What's her name?
SOPHIE
She can't talk.
HANNA
Hanna.
MILES
She talked.
35.
HANNA
I live in Leipzig. German city.
Population 0.7 Million people. We
live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I
go to school at the Klaus Kohle
Gymnasium and my best friends are
Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I
like literature and sport, in
particular tennis and athletics.
MILES
(RE' HANNA)
She's weird.
HANNA
I also have a dog called Trudi.
MILES
We had a dog called Vincent, but he
went mad and died.
SOPHIE
I'm Sophie and this is my brother,
Shit for Brains.
From over the dune comes the voice of SOPHIE and MILES'S
mother, RACHEL LYALL.
RACHEL (O.S.)
Come on, Sophie! We'll miss the
light.
MILES raises his camera to his eye and snaps a picture of
HANNA.
MILES
Bye.
SOPHIE
See you.
SOPHIE takes one more puzzled look at HANNA, then turns and
disappears over the sand dune.
HANNA rises to the top of the dune. SOPHIE turns back to
HANNA.
SOPHIE (CONT'D)
Do you need a lift somewhere?
HANNA
No. I prefer to walk.
SOPHIE
Suit yourself.
36.
SOPHIE and MILES head back towards their nouveau hippy
parents, RACHEL and SEBASTIAN LYALL who are waiting for them
beside an old VAN parked by a tarmac road that cuts straight
through the desert.
HANNA walking along the side of a tarmac desert road,
approaching a dusty oasis town.
HANNA enters the outskirts, teaming with scooters, trucks,
taxis, mules and goats. The impact knocks HANNA backwards,
assailed by the smells of dried fruit, meat tagines, couscous
cooking at market stalls, fresh fish and meat, still bloody
and twitching, hanging in the sun for the flies. She listens
to the babble of Arabic, her ears, nose and eyes sensitive to
every conversation and twitch of life. It all overpoweringly
exotic and visceral to her.
An old broken-backed woman inches her way to market. HANNA
stares at her in astonishment. Her wrinkled skin.
She eyes the abundance of animals - animals she's never seen
before in her life: Chickens. Goats. A camel, which Hanna
finds bizarre and hilarious.
The Reeperbaln, the main street of Hamburg's red light
district. Tough and unglamorous. MARISSA WIEGLER gets out of
a taxi, checks the sign of the strip club and crosses the
road. She is on the phone and we hear.
LEWIS (O.S.)
The Swedish borders are sealed. I
have Swedish, Norwegian and Danish
border patrols on high alert and
Interpol have briefed the police.
MARISSA
I don't want any bad news Lewis.
Neither of us can afford a fuck up.
MARISSA hangs up. She enters a converted car park which is
now a lap dancing bar. It's early in the day and the patrons
are as scarce as the clothes on the dancers.
At the far end of the room is the reason Marissa is there,
MICHAEL ISAACS. Mid fifties. Rumpled suit, bleary, unshaven
and drinking a scotch.
ISAACS smiles coldly at MARISSA.
ISAACS
I didn't think they let women in
here.
MARISSA
They let them in, they just don't
let them get dressed.
He smiles, drinks, she eyes the scotch.
MARISSA (CONT'D)
Still drinking on the job. You
haven't changed.
ISAACS
You have.
42.
MARISSA
Adapt or die.
ISAACS
You want a drink?
MARISSA
I'll wait until I really need one.
He grins and drinks. She sits, with a sigh, looks him in the
eye.
MARISSA (CONT'D)
Erik Heller's still alive.
ISAACS glances up from his drink.
ISAACS
You don't say.
MARISSA
There's more.
MARISSA passes him a newspaper. He opens it. Hidden inside is
a picture of Hanna. He looks it over, surprised.
ISAACS (IRONIC)
Wow. All grown up.
MARISSA
He did a good job.
ISAACS
Did she turn out like you hoped?
MARISSA
She just tried to kill me.
ISAACS
Isn't it always the way?
MARISSA
The fuck does that mean?
ISAACS
You bring them into this world,
teach them how to kill and maim...
and then they turn against you.
MARISSA
I didn't teach her.
ISAACS
No, it's better than that. You bred
her from a test tube.
MARISSA turns to the BARMAN and signals for a round of the
scotches, Two of these...
43.
MARISSA
Here's the problem: She thinks we
killed her mother.
He smiles wryly.
ISAACS
Just get her sectioned or
something.
MARISSA
Sure, just as soon as she's done
breaking peoples necks. You get her
sectioned, if you can catch her.
The drinks arrive, MARISSA drinks.
MARISSA (CONT'D)
Right now she's in Morocco but
she'll be trying to get out of the
country. Find her and bring her to
me. Quietly.
ISAACS
I'll need funds.
MARISSA slides an envelope of bills across the table.
MARISSA
Don't spend it all on candy.
She glances meaningfully at the STRIPPERS, who have been
eyeing up ISAACS as a potential mark.
ISAACS looks at the money. When he looks back up MARISSA is
already walking out the door.
HANNA is sitting at a table with the FAMILY who are all
eating falafel while HANNA eats meat.
SOPHIE and MILES parents, RACHEL and SEB, have some
difficulty relating to their daughters attitudes. They belong
to a generation of counter cultural radicals whose priorities
have, over the past decade, shifted and they're now trying to
assimilate into mainstream society whilst still holding on to
their ideals of autonomy and social liberation.
SOPHIE is describing a recent cultural phenomenon while she
picks at her food.
SOPHIE
She's beautiful. I wish I had a
body like hers. She's really cool
too. She's married to a footballer
and really loves him -
44.
Meanwhile HANNA eyes the crowd, constantly on the look out.
SOPHIE (CONT'D)
- only the papers found out he was
shagging like loads of other girls
so she went and got all successful
in her own right and now does a
make-over show where she turns
right dogs into real babes. I could
do you a make-over if you'd like?
RACHEL
Perhaps Hanna doesn't want a make-
over, sweetie.
SOPHIE ignores RACHEL and addresses all her responses to
HANNA.
SOPHIE
Rachel doesn't believe in making
the best of yourself.
RACHEL
No Sophie, I just don't believe
fourteen year-old girls should be
dressing to look like porn stars.
It objectifies them.
SOPHIE
(TO HANNA)
Do you shave your armpits yet?
HANNA
I don't think so.
RACHEL
Good. Keep it that way.
SOPHIE
That's SOOO gross.
RACHEL
Do you often travel on your own,
Hanna?
HANNA
My father encourages me to be
independent.
SEB
And your mother?
HANNA
She's dead.
SEB
Oh, I'm sorry.
45.
SOPHIE
Nice one, Dad.
HANNA
People die.
MILES
What did she die of?
HANNA
Three bullets.
RACHEL
Oh. God. How terrible.
SOPHIE is weirdly impressed.
ERIK HELLER, still wearing his three piece suit, enters a
tiny provincial Swedish butchers shop and walks up to the
counter. He checks around to make sure no one is following
him before approaching the BUTCHER and slapping some cash on
the counter.
HELLER
Three pounds of goose fat if you
please.
The music continues over -
47.
A barren rocky outcrop on the South Swedish coast. HELLER
arrives. He has a rucksack on his back.
HELLER undresses and puts his suit in a plastic bag that he
knots tight. He puts the bag into the rucksack and puts it on
his back.
Then HELLER starts to cover his body in the goose fat he
bought in the butcher's. He stares across the water towards
DENMARK in the distance.
HANNA appears in the blue morning light and stalks around the
car park looking for the family van.
When she finds it, she tries the doors but they're locked.
She tries the back door but that's also locked.
She gets her foot onto a wheel and another foot onto a
doorhandle and climbs up onto the roof.
She studies the sun roof of the recreational vehicle. It has
been left open a few inches for air.
She gets her hands in there and tries to prise it open
further but it's mechanised and won't budge.
She looks around the car park for an implement.
She spies a fire escape with a caretaker's nook next to it.
She climbs back down off the van and goes to the caretaker's
room.
A busy bustling ferry-port, cars in both directions.
ISAACS looks round, makes silent contact with other men. His
men. Four of them dotted around the ferryport.
ISAACS approaches a BORDER GUARD. The GUARD is looking at a
photocopied photo of HANNA from her holding cell. The GUARD
pockets the photocopy as ISAACS passes him a wad of cash.
48.
ISAACS watches closely every car that approaches the ferry
from behind his dark glasses.
He sees the FAMILY have joined a cue of vehicles and are
having their papers checked. Then they're waved on board. He
scrutinises them but has no reason to suspect anything.
HANNA walks out on deck and sees the sea, the sight of it
takes her breath away. She walks to the railings and looks
over the edge. Then up at the seagulls following the boat.
A little way off the FAMILY are sitting eating ice-creams.
SOPHIE lies out on a bench sunning herself.
RACHEL
What has got into you? Oh my God,
look over there.
They all look where she is pointing - at HANNA.
SOPHIE
It's her.
SEB
You think she... you don't think
she... Rachel, the sunroof?
RACHEL
You think we should say something?
SEB
What's there to say?
RACHEL
Maybe she's in trouble.
SEB
Maybe she's a hooker. Or a
terrorist. There's a lot of them in
Germany.
SOPHIE
Hookers or terrorists?
RACHEL
I'll go over.
50.
SEB
Rachel, walk away. I'm insisting
here. I'm putting my foot down...
RACHEL heads off towards HANNA, SOPHIE follows.
CUT TO:
SOPHIE and RACHEL approach HANNA and move to positions either
side of her.
SOPHIE
All right?
HANNA
Did you know that 71 percent of the
earths surface is covered in water?
SOPHIE
My father thinks you're a stowaway.
He thinks you broke our sunroof
too, which puts you in deep shit.
RACHEL
Sophie just - I'll handle this.
(TO HANNA)
Where's your father?
No reply.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
I really think it might help if you
told us the, you know, the truth
and all that. Have you run away
from somewhere?
SOPHIE
Are you okay?
HANNA
I'm fine.
RACHEL
I'm worried about you.
SOPHIE
She said she's fine.
RACHEL
You have to understand this really
is a problem for us.
51.
SOPHIE
You know what? Why don't I stay
here with her and you go off and be
with dad? He's looking kind of
tense.
CUT TO:
RACHEL rejoins SEB and MILES.
SEB
Has she even got a passport?!
RACHEL
I don't think I handled that very
well.
SEB
How do you know she's not some kind
of illegal immigrant?
ISAACS searches the upper deck. Through the bar on the other
side of the ferry he sees one of his men searching the
opposite deck.
A CHILD knocks into ISAACS and the few photocopied
photographs he has of HANNA fall from his pocket and are
blown along the deck.
ISAACS scrambles to pick-up the photocopies.
HANNA and SOPHIE are still standing at the railings. SOPHIE
offers HANNA some of her ice-cream.
SOPHIE
Would you like some?
HANNA looks curiously at the ice-cream.
HANNA
Please.
She tries it.
HANNA (CONT'D)
It tastes like music.
SOPHIE
You're so weird, aren't you? Did
you have a fight with your dad or
something?
52.
HANNA
Yes.
SOPHIE
Was it bad?
HANNA
No. I won.
HANNA studies the sea.
HANNA (CONT'D)
Can you help me get home?
At that moment one of ISAACS photocopied pictures of HANNA
rolls across the deck and catches on the railings.
HANNA looks down at it, recognizes herself and quickly
pockets it. She looks across the deck, too many people, she
shouldn't have let herself be so exposed.
HANNA (CONT'D)
You could do me a make-over if you
like?
The FERRY is docked, the huge doors are open and cars are
starting to drive out, halting on the dock to have passports
checked.
Dark rain pours down on to a beach on the Danish coast.
A figure struggles to land. Then, like a monster from the
deep, ERIK emerges out of the surf. His lungs bursting with
the exertion. Water dripping from his body.
He collapses for a while then stumbles up the beach. He
approaches the beach car park.
A POLICE CAR swings into the car park.
ERIK tries to run, but it's too late. The POLICE CAR is on
him.
He stops and turns towards the police car.
TWO POLICEMEN get out of the car and approach ERIK. He
watches them very carefully.
The FAMILY'S van speeds along the E-15 up from the Bay of
Gibraltar, heading north east towards the mountains.
55.
MARISSA walks along the desolate patch of coastline. She
approaches a Crime Scene. Dogs, markings on the ground. Two
DANISH POLICEMEN lie inert on the pebbles, their throats
freshly sliced.
LEWIS
The Danish authorities are taking
this very seriously. They've
doubled the number of officers on
the ground. We've sent up spotter
planes over the channel.
(MORE)
56.
LEWIS (CONT'D)
They're appealing for witnesses
through the local media...
MARISSA nods and looks out at the roiling grey sea. The
reality of ERIK'S determination unnerving her.
LEWIS (CONT'D)
You think he really swam it?
MARISSA knows he did. She calls over her shoulder as she
walks away.
MARISSA
Keep me posted.
The campsite is heaving with humanity, thousands of EUROPEAN
CAMPERS who have turned the site into what amounts to a
shanty town - a small city with its own shops, drainage,
borders and rules. Families come here from cities across
Europe and bring their whole lives with them.
The LYALL FAMILY van is squeezed in between a GERMAN family
walking around in skimpy swimming costumes - and a serious
looking FRENCH family with quad bikes.
SOPHIE, MILES and HANNA stare at the other families a moment.
GERMAN CAMPER.
Guten tag.
HANNA
Guten Morgen.
GERMAN CAMPER.
Wie geht es Ihnen?
HANNA
Gutm und Ihnen?
GERMAN CAMPER.
Jah, gut, gut...
A FRENCH CAMPER nods at them.
FRENCH CAMPER.
Bonjour. Ca va?
HANNA
Ca va. Oui. Bien...
HANNA starts efficiently helping SEB erect the children's
tent. He's watches impressed as HANNA expertly ties
complicated knots.
RACHEL and MILES start blowing up two inflatable mattresses.
57.
RACHEL
Maybe we could all go for a walk
when we've put the tent up.
SOPHIE
No thanks.
HANNA looks off to the tree line. In the distance she spots a
couple of RABBITS in a pool of sunlight.
HANNA sits on a low wall writing her postcard:
Mission accomplished'
HANNA gets up and posts the card.
RACHEL and HANNA are walking in the woods together. Above
them the evening chorus is in full song.
RACHEL
I just feel connected when I'm in
the countryside. The city stifles
me... emotionally, creatively.
HANNA'S attention is elsewhere, she's spotted something in
the undergrowth.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
Anyway, I was very young when I...
Seb and I.... He was so impressive.
HANNA suddenly runs into the woods.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
Hanna?!
58.
The FAMILY are sitting in fold-out chairs eating charred
veggie sausages.
SOPHIE
It's probably just a bunch of
Spanish farmers, mum. We're hardly
going to be out all night.
RACHEL
You're not going, Sophie. No way,
Jose.
HANNA appears from the woods carrying TWO SKINNED RABBITS.
She lays them in front of the family.
HANNA
Food.
SOPHIE lets out a shriek of nervous laughter, while SEB and
RACHEL are confused as to what the appropriate reaction might
be.
MILES
That's gross.
SOPHIE and HANNA sneak through the campsite together and move
secretly between the parked cars. HANNA is dressed in some of
SOPHIE's clothes and has the make-up on. They are excited,
SOPHIE alive with the thrill of disobedience.
HANNA
I can't walk in this.
SOPHIE
You look hot.
HANNA
Where are we going?
SOPHIE
Shhhhh!
HANNA uncomfortable with the situation.
HANNA
I shouldn't take unnecessary risks.
SOPHIE
Says who?
SOPHIE heads off down the road.
HANNA weighs the situation and then quickens her pace to
catch up with SOPHIE.
A loud out door rave in a Roman amphitheatre.
SOPHIE and HANNA stand at the top of the amphitheatre looking
down on the thrilling spectacle, soaking up the bass, the
abstract sounds, the sheer volume, the pulsing lights and
electric atmosphere - HANNA is thrilled and startled.
Many of the crowd seem to be wearing fancy dress. HANNA
stares at a girl dressed as a red ladybird.
CUT TO:
The girls approach a bar and SOPHIE goes to order. She's
forced to mime and shout her order over the music.
SOPHIE
Vodka. Two.
60.
The bartender shakes his head and holds up two bottles of
water.
BARTENDER
Water only. No booze.
Meanwhile HANNA spots FELICIANO, the handsome SPANISH BOY
from the camp site shop, across the dance floor. He is
staring at her again.
SOPHIE comes back with two bottles of water and hands one to
HANNA.
HANNA
What do they call this music?
SOPHIE
Banging.
HANNA stares at the dancers, people losing themselves in it -
SOPHIE just grins, starts to move to the music.
HANNA smiles awkwardly, tries to copy SOPHIE.
CUT TO:
ISAACS enters the rave followed by two of his HENCHMEN. They
split up and start to survey the crowd.
Over in a secluded corner ISAACS sees a drug deal taking
place.
ISAACS sidles over to the DEALER and his PUNTER. The PUNTER,
thinking ISAACS is probably a cop, makes a hasty getaway.
ISAACS
What you got?
DEALER
(in Spanish w/ English
SUBTITLES)
Nothing man. That guys just a
friend.
ISAACS frisks the DEALER, nothing. He turns the DEALER
against the wall and checks his socks where he finds a stash
of tiny baggies each containing a gram or two of white
powder.
ISAACS samples the powder and pockets the lot.
DEALER (CONT'D)
(in Spanish w/ English
SUBTITLES)
Hey, you're not police. What the
fuck?
ISAACS turns as he walks away and puts a finger to his lips.
61.
ISAACS
Ssh.
CUT TO:
Back near the bar HANNA and SOPHIE are approached by a couple
of scrawny SPANISH BOYS in day-glow tops.
SPANISH BOY
(in Spanish w/ English
SUBTITLES)
Where are you from?
The girls just look at each other.
SPANISH BOY (CONT'D)
English? American? You like to
party?
They watch, puzzled, as SOPHIE smiles disinterestedly and
leads HANNA away.
HANNA
Will you teach me to do dancing?
SOPHIE
It's easy.
HANNA and SOPHIE walk onto the dance floor and begin to
dance.
HANNA starts by dancing like a five year-old, swinging her
arms jerkily and lifting her feet as if walking through a
field. But soon her movements become more sophisticated and
expressive.
CUT TO:
ISAACS is searching through the crowd. He eyes the bodies
around him greedily.
He takes another dab of the white powder and rubs it into his
gums.
CUT TO:
Back on the dance floor, HANNA and SOPHIE are dancing.
FELICIANO approaches through the crowd followed by a FRIEND.
THEY start to circle HANNA and SOPHIE, dancing, insinuating
their way in.
SOPHIE (CONT'D)
He's after you.
HANNA
How can you tell?
62.
SOPHIE
Duh, look at the way he's looking
at you. He's gorgeous.
FELICIANO'S FRIEND approaches SOPHIE, he's not bad looking
either.
FELICIANO'S FRIEND
What's your name?
SOPHIE
Sophie.
FELICIANO'S FRIEND
Have you come here before?
SOPHIE
All the time.
FELICIANO'S FRIEND
Really? You dance well.
SOPHIE
So do you.
HANNA and FELICIANO hold eye contact.
The music rises and now they're lit only by the intermittent
flashes of a strobe light.
HANNA and FELICIANO begin to dance around each other, their
movements caught in still flashes.
CUT TO:
From some distance away ISAACS spots HANNA. He smiles and
starts to move through the crowds towards her.
CUT TO:
SOPHIE and the FRIEND are kissing. HANNA sees this and
laughs.
The crowd is jumping.
HANNA feels FELICIANO'S hand take hers, she flinches a
moment, then lets him draw her towards him. Their eyes still
locked.
ISAACS is getting closer, his eyes flashing eerily in the
strobe lighting.
HANNA and FELICIANO are in a world of their own.
His fingers trace the lines of her arms, shoulders and neck.
He draws her face towards his.
63.
HANNA
Are we going to kiss now?
FELICIANO
Would you like to?
HANNA
Kissing requires a total of thirty-
four facial muscles.
Their lips are almost touching.
HANNA (CONT'D)
The most important muscle involved
is the orbicularis oris muscle,
which is used to pucker the lips -
He kisses her.
HANNA closes her eyes.
ISAACS moves in.
FELICIANO becomes more ardent, puts his arms around her
waist, she doesn't like it. He tries to open her mouth with
his.
HANNA snaps.
In a few swift moves, HANNA pulls FELICIANO round and throws
him to the ground. She falls to his side and, with one knee
on his back, she holds his head, about to snap his neck.
SOPHIE turns and sees them on the ground. A few of the
closest DANCERS also stop dancing and stare.
ISAACS backs off, watching from a safe distance.
SOPHIE
Hanna! Holy crap...
FELICIANO
Please, don't hurt me.
(TO SOPHIE)
Please, tell your friend...
HANNA looks up at SOPHIE. Now that she has FELICIANO on the
ground she doesn't know what to do with him.
HANNA
Should I let him go?
SOPHIE
As opposed to what? Yes, you should
let him go.
HANNA leans in to whisper into FELICIANO'S ear.
64.
HANNA
I'm going to go now.
FELICIANO
Sure.
HANNA
It was nice.
And she's gone, pulling SOPHIE away through the crowd.
ISAACS jumps into action. But he's lost sight of the girls
among the mass of dancing bodies.
HANNA and SOPHIE move quickly through the crowds towards the
exit.
SOPHIE
Oh, my God, Hanna. I thought you
were going to kill him. Where d'you
learn to do that?
HANNA
My father taught me.
They escape through a hole in the perimeter fence.
129 129
NIGHT
An immaculately tidy lounge in a small apartment on the
ground floor of a run down East Berlin housing project.
A well-dressed woman in her 60's, KATRIN, is sitting alone
listening to music on an old casette machine.
The door buzzer rings. KATRIN gets up slowly and approaches
the door.
KATRIN
Who is it?
No reply. KATRIN puts the safety chain across the door and
opens it a small amount.
MARISSA
Hello Katrin.
KATRIN slams the door shut in fright and double locks it.
Fear racing through her veins, she rushes her way through the
lounge, knocking furniture as she goes.
The FAMILY van passes through the campsite gates to reveal
ISAACS coming out of the reception hut.
He sees the van, recognises it. He sees the kids in the back.
Bingo. He runs to a black BMW where two of his HENCHMEN are
waiting for him.
ISAACS
Wake up. It's them.
He jumps in the passenger seat whilst the driver revs the
engine.
The BMW pulls out in front of an oncoming truck narrowly
avoiding a collision.
A commuter train pulls into the vast station. Amongst the
morning commuters alighting the train is ERIK HELLER. He
looks furtively around, and tries to blend in with the crowd.
71.
POV - from a walkway above the station - someone is watching
HELLER as he tries to conceal himself within the throng. A
DANISH AGENT, hidden on a metal walkway above the platform.
On the platform HELLER walks amongst the commuters, past the
ticket collectors, past another DANISH AGENT posing as a
commuter - he stops and lingers by him, noting something not
right.
He moves off and enters a small bar.
The second AGENT immediately follows and from the walkway,
the other rushes downstairs to give chase too.
HELLER walks through the bar into the toilets, finds a FIRE
EXIT and walks out through it.
HELLER finds himself in a goods yard adjoining the train
station. He walks through the goods yard, then suddenly, and
apparently for no reason, stops dead, then throws himself
behind a skip of empty bottles.
As he does two new men, AMERICAN SPECIAL OPS, run round the
corner into the goods yard.
From the fire exit, the DANISH AGENTS EMERGE and after
signalling to each other, head off to the perimeter.
The various agents scour the yard. The SPECIAL OPS get closer
to HELLER's hiding place. HELLER suddenly emerges from his
hiding place and sticks an elbow in the face of one, a knee
in the groin of another.
There's a brief exchange of blows.
One of the SPECIAL OPS draws his hand gun.
HELLER produces a knife out of nowhere and launches at the
man, cutting him on the hand, making him drop his gun.
He stabs the other in the eye and the man falls to the ground
squealing.
HELLER leans in and takes from the man's pocket his
CELLPHONE.
HELLER makes a run for it. One of the SPECIAL OPS lets off a
shot, the bullet clipping HELLER in the leg.
He falters but limps off behind the towering containers.
The FAMILY van is making its way up through France.
72.
Following in the black BMW, a few cars behind, ISAACS and his
HENCHMEN are biding their time.
A phone booth in a city park. ERIK shivering in the cold as
icy rain falls around him, he's holding the CELLPHONE he
stole from the dead SPECIAL OPS. HELLER'S leg is bleeding
profusely.
ERIK
Well, here we are.
MARISSA
How did you know I was here?
ERIK
I killed one of your men. Got his
cellphone. You've gotten soft.
MARISSA (O.S.)
No, I just grew up. The world's
changed since you died.
ERIK
You got kids?
The FAMILY'S van drives - behind ISAACS BMW tails it, lights
on high beam.
JOANNA (V.O.)
I wonder who she'll be? I hope
she's smart. I hope she's a
stronger person than I am.
The van slowly pulls in at the side of the road.
RACHEL waits for the BMW behind to pass but instead it pulls
in behind the van.
On either side of the road is an enormous container park. The
containers are piled on top of each other like a giant baby's
building blocks.
76.
RACHEL
Why won't that car pass? He has his
lights on high beam, I was doing
everything I could to get out of
the way...
SOPHIE wakes up in the back.
SOPHIE
Are we stopped? I need to pee.
RACHEL
Well, I don't want you going too
far right now.
HANNA
I think you should stay where you
are, Sophie.
HANNA doesn't take her eyes off the mirror. She can see the
silhouettes of ISAACS and his MEN. They don't move and
neither does HANNA. Both are waiting for the other to make
the first move.
RACHEL
Hanna, what's going on. Seb wake
up.
HANNA
Please.
SOPHIE
This is creepy. You're creeping me
out.
SEB
(GROGGY)
Are we in Lille?
HANNA
I'm sorry. But you really mustn't
get out of the van.
HANNA climbs into the back of the van and comes very close to
SOPHIE.
HANNA (CONT'D)
What ever you do, don't follow me.
Promise not to follow me.
SOPHIE
I promise.
RACHEL
Hanna, tell me what's going on or
Seb will go over to that car and
find out.
77.
SEB
Like fuck I will. Everyone stay
put. Where's my phone?
HANNA
(TO SOPHIE)
Thank you for being my friend.
HANNA looks back at the BMW. All at once all four of the car
doors open.
In a flash, HANNA pulls open the van's side door and bolts
from the van.
RACHEL
Hanna!
RACHEL sees ISAACS and one of the HENCHMEN chase after HANNA.
The SECOND HENCHMAN appears at her drivers window aiming his
gun at her head. RACHEL screams.
HANNA sprints across hard tarmac heading for the relative
safety of the container park.
ISAACS and his HENCHMAN follow at speed.
HANNA enters a dark gully between two enormous containers.
ISAACS slips around the other side to block her off. He
signals to the HENCHMAN to loop around and flank HANNA.
HANNA moves quietly between the containers, turning this way
and that.
ISAACS voice comes echoing through the maze.
ISAACS (O.S.)
Don't be a silly girl, Hanna. You
need to come with me now. I know
where your papa is.
She listens.
CUT TO:
ISAACS, his gun in hand, calls out again.
ISAACS (CONT'D)
He wants to talk to you, Hanna. He
misses you.
CUT TO:
The HENCHMAN appears directly behind HANNA. HANNA double-
kicks him in the chest.
78.
HANNA pulls herself up the side of the containers and
scrambles on top of them and runs, jumping between the
containers when she reaches a gap.
The HENCHMAN appears having climbed up too.
A chase ensues. HANNA, followed by the HENCHMAN climbing up
higher, now four containers high.
ISAACS follow below.
HANNA jumps an enormous gap between two containers and right
over the head of ISAACS.
HANNA slips and tumbles but catches the edge of one of the
containers on her way down. She hangs there a moment, then
pushes herself off the side of the container and manages to
land on a lower container on the other side.
HANNA running across the tops of the containers sees the
HENCHMAN appear at the far edge. She grabs a discarded wrench
and throws it at the man, catching him in the side of the
head - a perfect aim - and he tumbles to the ground.
She descends the containers with nimble leaps and comes to
the ground.
She's running now through a maze of tight alleys between the
containers. She stops at a T' junction, unsure which way to
go. Suddenly ISAACS appears at the end of one alley, HENCHMAN
ONE at the end of another, and HENCHMAN TWO at the end of the
third.
She's trapped.
ISAACS (CONT'D)
Just take it easy.
HANNA makes her decision and runs straight at ISAACS.
He stretches out his arms in an attempt to catch her.
She hits him like a bowling ball hitting the last pin and he
crashes to the ground.
She rolls and springs to her feet.
The HENCHMEN follow but HANNA is too quick.
HANNA sprints full tilt out of the container park and through
a scrap metal yard. Either side of her rise mountains of
waste.
HANNA reaches the edge of an industrial canal from where the
scrap metal is unloaded.
79.
A large industrial barge is passing beneath. HANNA jumps and
lands on the moving barge. Then quickly takes cover under a
tarpaulin.
HANNA watches as the sun rises over the misty fields either
side be the canal. It's a beautiful sight. HANNA is strangely
peaceful.
HANNA'S sits on the prow of the barge as it makes it's slow
progress into Berlin.
MARISSA looks out at a school playground as she waits in the
back of her car.
The passenger door next to her opens and ISAACS gets in.
ISAACS
I've looked through Heller's
contacts from the 1980's. There's
no one called Wilhelm.
MARISSA
Wilhelm Grimm wrote fairy-tales. He
died two hundred years ago.
MARISSA hands ISAACS a brown envelope containing one of the
photographs she took from KATRIN'S apartment.
The photograph shows a happy looking JOANNA and ERIK at a
busy family amusement park. Between ERIK and JOANNA is a
clown, his arms around both of them. This we will come to
understand is KLAUS KNEPFLER. Behind them is a GRIMM'S
BROTHERS HOUSE OF FUN.
83.
ISAACS
What the hell is this?
MARISSA smiles slightly.
MARISSA
Wilhelm's house.
(to the DRIVER)
Drive on.
HANNA wanders through the skyscrapers and glass constructions
of Berlin.
People swarm around her but pay her no mind.
HANNA walks beside a wire mesh fence that separates her from
an abandoned amusement park. Behind her is an enormous steel
works from which great industrial plumes of steam rise.
HANNA climbs under the fence and walks through this surreal
playground long since reclaimed by nature. There are huge
fibreglass dinosaurs toppled over with heads missing and
abandoned dinosaur legs. Rising above the park, surrounded by
a muddy moat, is the big wheel now standing at a vertiginous
angle. In front of the big wheel is the WILHELM GRIMM HOUSE.
The house is a Grimm Brothers fairytale theme Fun House'.
It's windows long since shuttered, vines growing through its
roof.
HANNA stands in front of the house in deep anticipation. She
walks up the small steps that lead to the front door and
knocks. She waits, heart sinking at the thought of there
being no-one home. Then, ever so slightly the door opens and
peering out at her is a man with the sad face of an out of
work clown.
KNEPFLER
Excuse me young lady?
It is the man from the photo, but twenty years older. Small,
with a wiry intensity.
HANNA
Are you Wilhelm Grimm?
84.
KNEPFLER
Not exactly, but it'll do for now.
Come this way.
He leads her inside.
The driver of the second car gets out and opens the back door
for MARISSA. She gets out and looks up at the house.
87.
HANNA lands having jumped from the window.
She looks around quickly. Then, out of sight from the cars at
the front of the house, she runs for dear life.
HANNA walking fast, in total shock and confusion. Who is she?
She walks head down, determined not to be seen. Not knowing
where she is going. Her world turned upside down. She sees an
internet cafe. Ducks into it.
90.
ERIK HELLER limps, head bowed, through the Amusement Park.
He suddenly stops dead and ducks behind a fallen fibreglass
dinosaur as he sees two CIA AGENTS sitting in a car outside
the house.
HELLER watches for a moment or two.
Then, keeping low, he makes a painful run towards the house.
HELLER throws himself against the back wall of the kitchen.
He breathes heavily for a moment, clutching his wounded leg.
He turns and rises to look through the kitchen window.
Inside he sees KNEPFLER, stripped to the waist his body
bloodied, hanging upside down from a meat hook. He's
obviously dead.
91.
HELLER crouches back down against the wall, thinking
furiously. Then, decision made, he checks sight lines and
runs back across the Amusement Park away from the house.
PROJECTS - DAY
HANNA gets out of the taxi and looks up at an enormous grey
housing block - the Heizinger building.
She approaches the entrance and looks on all the buzzers.
Sees a name scrawled on one - Number 14. Zadek.
She presses the buzzer. Waits. No answer.
A GANG OF KURDISH YOUTHS come out the block and HANNA catches
the door and enters.
PROJECT - DAY
HANNA walks round to the back door of the apartment and
approaches the kitchen window. She peers through.
On first inspection the kitchen seems undisturbed. Then HANNA
sees the framed photograph of JOANNA on the wall. Blood
splattered across the glass.
93.
HANNA quickly moves to the door, tries to force it. She looks
around, no-one's coming. With a sharp kick she smashes the
glass.
HELLER sprints fast across the wasteland. Incredible
athleticism. He dives down a side alley, losing his pursuers
for a second. Takes out a gun, looking for Marissa. Looking
to finish it off.
Just as he has done this ISAACS' HENCHMAN approach from the
end of the street. HELLER fires in their direction, starts to
run down an alley. He vaults a dividing wall, scratching
himself on barbed wire. He sprints round a corner and sees a
doorway ahead of him. He walks towards the doorway.
MARISSA (O.C.)
Drop it.
MARISSA steps out of the doorway, her gun trained on him.
There are men at the end of the alleyway. No escape. HELLER
drops his gun.
Silence between them. He turns to look her in the eye.
98.
ERIK
So go ahead.
She stares at him. Wants to make this as painful as she can
for him.
MARISSA
You know I'll find her.
ERIK
Don't under estimate what you
created.
MARISSA
What we created, together.
HANNA is walking fast across the grim grey estate to a main
road.
MARISSA with her gun still at ERIK.
MARISSA
Truth is I was always very fond of
you.
CLOSE ON - HANNA continuing to walk away.
She hears a single gun shot. Stops dead. Knows what it means.
An intense conflict of emotions inside her. Her breathing
stops for a moment, her world seems to go silent.
Then a car flies by on the main road, almost running her
over, and she is woken. She sees a bus stop ahead. On auto-
pilot she runs to it, a bus coming, she beckons. It stops and
she is on board.
MARISSA stands over the dead body of ERIK HELLER.
MARISSA
Leave him here.
And they all walk away leaving him alone in the East Berlin
dirt.
99.
The train entering a Polish train station. The town is called
Ostrovska. Freezing cold. The town is in the North of Poland
and it's very poor. Industrial. Bleak. HANNA exits,
approaches a station guard.
100.
HANNA
I am looking for a train to
Galinka.
GUARD
Galinka is a small village. No
trains. You must wait for bus in
the morning.
HANNA
Where can I stay?
He points. HANNA sees the hotel.
Shaking in shock, HANNAH walks out of the hotel and down the
street, in a daze, no idea where she is going. She starts to
run, faster and faster, just running to run out of herself.
Finally she stops and is sick. She looks up. A taxi's yellow
light blinks in the darkness. She looks at the businessman's
wallet to see how much money is in there. She approaches the
taxi.
HANNA
I have this much. Can you take me
to Galinka?
HANNA is in the taxi as it travels a lonely Polish forest
road through undulating snow-covered hills. Cold dawn is
arriving. Grey skies lightening through the windscreen. Tall
snowy pines tower above the car. No one else on the road,
just a horse drawn cart guiding cows to pasture. It is as if
from a different age. Quiet, solitary. HANNA checks the
paper in her pocket. Still there. Blood on her hands from the
businessman. A cut in her arm. Carefully, secretly, she wipes
it clean.
Suddenly the taxi stops.
DRIVER
This is as far as the money gets
you.
HANNA looks out. Middle of nowhere.
HANNA
How much further?
DRIVER
Twelve miles.
HANNA
Please.
But no smile from him, nothing. HANNA gets out. Starts to
walk as the taxi turns and drives back the way it came.
103.
She is alone in the forest, freezing, shattered, hungry. Just
about dawn. Cold as hell.
She hears a car approach. Tries to hail it but it flies past
fast. Blows icy air in her face.
She continues in the freezing cold - sees the road ahead.
It's hilly, winding, she isn't going to make it. Too tired.
Too shattered.
Time passes. Still she walks. Dead on her feet. Gathering
every ounce of energy.
Then the sounds of another car. But it too just flies by,
ignoring her waves and cries.
HANNA almost collapses in frustration. But carries on.
Carries on walking.
Time passes. Freezing cold. HANNA alone on the road. Can she
make it?
Then another car. HANNA turns, waves, cries out. And, almost
magically, the car slows and stops. The window winds down.
HANNA (CONT'D)
I'm going to Galinka. Can you help
me?
A woman's voice, German, in German.
WOMAN (V.O.)
Yes I can take you there.
And as HANNA gets in, she looks at the comforting, smiling
face of MARISSA WIEGLER.
Soft dawn light as MARISSA drives on a narrow rural road.
MARISSA's car slows as it enters a tiny deserted hamlet.
MARISSA (V.O.)
This is it.
HANNA looks around at the grey desolation, rural poverty, the
ends of the earth. In the car MARISSA stares at her, then
drives off.
HANNA walks through the trees along a track. Overgrown, not
used for many years.
She reaches a hidden entrance off the track. By the entrance
there is an old battered sign. GALINKA. HANNA looks at the
old iron gate. Rusted, locked. It has not been opened in a
long time.
She stares at the sign, tries the gate - yes, locked. Then
she climbs the gate. She nearly tears her clothes on the
spikes at the top of the gate, then leaps over and,
exhausted, four days without real sleep, begins to walk up
the narrow tree-lined driveway.
107.
HANNA approaches the gaping mouth of an underground bunker.
She stops, looks down at the torch in her hand, switches it
on and walks into the darkness.
HANNA runs back through the tunnels.
HANNA
No more. No more.
Tears are streaming down her face as she reaches sight of the
tunnel mouth and the daylight beyond. Standing in silhouette
is MARISSA. HANNA slows her pace and stops when she can see
the white of MARISSA'S eyes and the finger on MARISSA'S
trigger.
MARISSA raises the gun and aims at HANNA - but HANNA comes
forward again, walking calmly towards her.
She stops and drops her gun to the ground.
HANNA (CONT'D)
Everything I see is nothing I want.
MARISSA looks at HANNA, her gentle, childlike countenance.
She smiles.
MARISSA
Let me take care of you?
HANNA
No. I don't want that.
HANNA turns her back on MARISSA and starts to walks in the
opposite direction.
MARISSA watches her walk away.
HANNA walks waiting for the shot to come.
MARISSA
Hanna.
HANNA spins, fires directly at CAMERA.
CUT TO BLACK.
FADE UP:
The sun spreads its golden fingers through the trees catching
the early morning dew.
113.
A wide shot of the HANNA'S cabin, wisps of smoke rise from
it's chimney.
HANNA steps out of the cabin. She's back wearing her furs
again. In her hands she carries a cup of hot milk and a small
wooden bowl.
In VOICE-OVER we hear HANNA reading from her beloved
Encyclopaedia.
HANNA (V.O.)
The Earth is the third planet from
the Sun, and the fifth-largest of
the eight planets in the Solar
System.
HANNA sits down on a tree trunk outside the cabin and pours
some milk into the bowl, then drinks a little for herself.
HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Home to millions of species,
including humans, Earth is the only
place in the universe where life is
known to exist.
She raises her head and makes a small clicking sound. Her
friend, the snow fox, appears from the trees. The fox now has
a small family of cubs.
HANNA watches as the cubs approach the milk and begin to
drink.
HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
The planet formed over four and a
half billion years ago, and life
appeared on its surface within a
billion years.
HANNA sits back and feels the sunlight on her face. Above her
the trees are beginning to leaf.
HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It is expected to continue
supporting life for another one and
a half billion years, after which
the rising luminosity of the Sun
will eliminate it all.
HANNA surveys her beautiful world.
