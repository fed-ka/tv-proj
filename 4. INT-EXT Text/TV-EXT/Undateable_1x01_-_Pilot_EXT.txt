      JUSTIN ENTERS WITH A SUITCASE.  DANNY FOLLOWS CARRYING 
      JUSTIN S MANGLED BICYCLE.

                                  DANNY

                Welcome to the Dan Cave.

                                  JUSTIN

                Did you rob the Skymiles catalog?

                                  DANNY

                Pretty sweet, huh?  That s you.

      JUSTIN PEEKS HIS HEAD INTO HIS ROOM. 

                                  JUSTIN

                It ll work.  Good Feng Shui.

                                  DANNY

                Right, because Feng Shui is a real 

                thing. (AS JUSTIN WRITES A CHECK) And 

                the wall is already wired for a flat 

                screen, so you re good to go.

                                  JUSTIN

                Oh, no, I don t watch TV in bed.  All 

                research suggests that it negatively 

                affects sleep patterns.

                                  DANNY

                Really?  That s interesting. (BEFORE 

                JUSTIN CAN RESPOND) Not really.  That 

                was sarcasm. (THEN) So your gang...

                                  JUSTIN

                They re nice guys."UNDATEABLE", Sztykiel, 1/18/1318.


                                  DANNY

                They re sweethearts.  But they re like 

                the non-super hero version of The 

                  Avengers.  They re  The Undateables .  

                They each have their own unique power 

                and together they can repel any member 

                of the opposite sex.  You ve got 

                  Inappropriate Guy, Picky Gay Man, and 

                The Church Mouse.

                                  JUSTIN

                Well, then you re lucky,  cause I m 

                  certainly not gonna force you to hang 

                out with us.

                                  DANNY

                No, I m excited to get to know you 

                guys.  But did you see how awestruck 

                they were when Maddy and I were 

                vibing?

                                  JUSTIN

                About that.  I don t want it to get 

                weird, but Maddy and I are kind of...

      JUSTIN NODS, IMPLYING HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH MADDY.

                                  DANNY

                Really?  You and Maddy? (OFF JUSTIN S 

                SHRUG)  I knew you had hidden game!  I 

                was worried about you with the Lauper 

                and the bike shorts and Black Guys--"UNDATEABLE", Sztykiel, 1/18/1319.


                                  JUSTIN

                Black Eye s.

                                  DANNY

                But now I see you were just playin  it 

                cool.  The Iceman.  Cometh.  On Maddy.

                                  JUSTIN

                Oh, no.  It s not like that.  

                                  DANNY

                It s okay, your wins are my wins, now.  

                We re Lobos.

                                  JUSTIN

                Or just roommates. Kinda how I see it.

                                  DANNY

                So you and Maddy?  As the ancients 

                used to say: Washing each other s 

                feet.  As they said in the 70 s, 

                makin  whoopie.  As the Amish say, 

                doin  a little candle-makin -- 

                                  JUSTIN

                Okay, I got it.  But we re not, 

                like... together.

                                  DANNY

                Cool.  Casual.  Dating, but no labels.

                                  JUSTIN

                Yes.  No labels.  (LONG BEAT, THEN)  

                And no dating.  I m kinda still 

                waiting to make my move."UNDATEABLE", Sztykiel, 1/18/1320.


                                  DANNY

                How long have you been waiting?

                                  JUSTIN

                Since I opened the bar and hired her.  

                  Couple... years ago. (OFF A LOOK) It 

                needs to be the right moment, okay?

                                  DANNY

                Which is what?  A solar eclipse?

                                  JUSTIN

                I don t know... (THEN, JUMPING IN) It 

                needs to be earlier in the week so she 

                doesn t have plans yet, but not so 

                early that it seems desperate.  Like 

                maybe a Tuesday. In the fall, because 

                that s when my wardrobe is the 

                  strongest.  I look great in earth-

                toney sweaters.  But early fall, so 

                I m still kinda tan.  Around dusk.  

                Magic hour.  I d be standing behind 

                the bar washing glasses, she d come 

                over to help, Take On Me starts 

                playing, I sing along, casually, and 

                hit the high note because I can, then 

                we laugh about it, she drops a glass--

                                  DANNY

                Stop. (REALIZING) Oh my god, you re 

                one of the Undateables, aren t you?  

                                  (MORE)"UNDATEABLE", Sztykiel, 1/18/1321.

                                  DANNY (CONT'D)

                You re their leader.  The Captain 

                America of failing with women.  You re 

                  Never-Make-A-Move Man.

                                  JUSTIN

                Well, Danny, not everyone is born with 

                your misplaced confidence with women.

                                  DANNY

                Who me?  You think I just came out the 

                womb crushing ass?

                                  JUSTIN

                That s a very disturbing image. (BEAT)  

                For anyone who has a mother.

                                  DANNY

                I had many teachers over many years.  

                Seventh grade.  Jay Tuck taught me how 

                to remove a bra.  Turns out he was 

                just looking for an excuse to wear a 

                bra, but still, his issues aside, I 

                don t know where I d be without him.  

                And there were others, in high-school 

                and college, all passing along what 

                they d learned from their 

                  predecessors, shaping the man you see 

                standing before you. 

                                  JUSTIN

                You re aware of how douchey everything 

                you re saying right now sounds, right?"UNDATEABLE", Sztykiel, 1/18/1322.


                                  DANNY

                I blow by negative thoughts.  Who were 

                your teachers?  Any big brothers?  

                Family or fraternity?

                                  JUSTIN

                No one.  No one taught me anything.

                                  DANNY

                My sister was right.  It all happens 

                for a reason.  And you need me.

                                  JUSTIN

                Words cannot express how strongly I 

                disagree with that statement.

                                  DANNY

                Change is hard.  I get it.  But I m 

                trading in my beer helmet for a 

                  professor s cap.  Consider this your 

                  acceptance letter to Danny Beeman

                                  JUSTIN

                What the hell are you talking about?

                                  DANNY

                I need a purpose, Justin, and that 

                purpose is you.  Congratulations, kid, 

                you just got yourself a mentor.  

      DANNY CLAPS JUSTIN ON THE BACK.  JUSTIN IS NOT THRILLED.

                Perfect timing.  She was getting 

                clingy. (REALIZES) Wait, are you just 

                getting home from last night?

                Leslie.  Sorry, I just came to talk to 

                Danny. (OFF HER SILENCE) Just so you

                of a very buzzy, very pretty woman.

                                  LESLIE

                Very pretty? (SMILES, THEN) You wanna
