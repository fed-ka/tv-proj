      FADE IN:

      EXT. CROCKER MEMORIAL STATE PARK. SAN ANGELO - DAY (D/1)11

      A STONE MEMORIAL and flagpoles flying Old Glory and the 
      California Bear are the focal points of a fenced half-acre 
      patch of grass and trees and neat flowerbeds at the center of 
      San Angelo, an old farming town.  The usually quiet park is a 
      hive of activity -- POLICEMEN, CSI TECHS, NEWS CREWS, GAWKERS 
      behind yellow tape; that whole scene.  All revolving around a 
      crime scene that is, so far, just out of our view.    

      RIGSBY and CHO are waiting at the park entrance. 

                                  RIGSBY
                          (grumpy)
                    Any place.  Suspect can leave the 
                    body any place.  And they dump it 
                    on the only state land within a 
                    hundred miles.  Making it ours.

                                  CHO
                    Why is that a bad thing? 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Come on.  You saw the body.

                                  CHO
                    It's a coincidence.

                                  RIGSBY
                    If there's one thing Jane's taught 
                    me...

      He stops because JANE and LISBON and VAN PELT approach.

                                  LISBON
                    Hi.  What have we got?

      They walk and talk toward the crime scene.

                                  CHO
                    Victim's name is Emma Plaskett.  
                    Nineteen.  Local girl.  First 
                    responder knew her from high 
                    school.  

      He points out an ASHEN YOUNG DEPUTY sitting on the hood of a 
      Sheriff's Department Cruiser.

      CONTINUED:11

                                  CHO (CONT'D)
                    Lives at home with her parents, has 
                    an older brother and a twin sister, 
                    Maya, who went missing at the same 
                    time last night.

      The others react.  Oh crap.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Their car was found abandoned on 
                    the roadside last night.  Ten miles 
                    north of here.

                                  LISBON
                    Who's coordinating search teams 
                    locally?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Sheriff Hardy here is in charge. 

      This last as they come up on SHERIFF HARDY (30's), who is 
      gazing sadly at the crime scene, chewing gum.

                                    SHERIFF HARDY
                    Hi.  Ed Hardy.  Good to meetcha.   

      He puts out his hand to Lisbon.

                                  LISBON
                    Lisbon, Van Pelt, Jane.

      Hardy nods politely to them.  Jane goes to look at the body.

                                    SHERIFF HARDY 
                    I've called in all my people and 
                    we've got volunteers rendezvousing 
                    at the football field.  We'll grid 
                    up and have 'em in the field 
                    shortly.  

      We see Jane react strongly, but we don't see the body.

                                  JANE
                    Lisbon.  Look.

      She senses the urgency in his voice, and does as he asks.  
      POV -- a quick impressionistic look at the body.  

                                  LISBON
                    Oh damn.

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Footsteps"    GREEN 4/03/09    3.

                                  LISBON
                    No.  It's a coincidence.

                                  CHO
                    That's what I said.

                                  JANE
                    There's no such thing as 
                      coincidences.  Not with him. 

      Rigsby looks to Cho -- exactly.

                                    SHERIFF HARDY
                    What are you all talking about?  
                    Who's him?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Red John.  He's a serial killer.  
                    This is his style of, of cutting.

                                  CHO
                    The rest of his MO is absent.  Red 
                    John works indoors.  He doesn't 
                    move the body post mortem.  And 
                    where's the smiley face?  

                                  VAN PELT
                    It's a trademark.  He wouldn't drop 
                    that.

      Jane and Lisbon step aside, so that Sheriff Hardy doesn't 
      hear.  Made easier by the DRONE OF A PLANE in the sky 
      overhead.

                                  JANE
                    It's him.  Look at her toenails.

                                  LISBON
                    I see them.

                                  JANE
                    Painted with her blood.  Just like 
                    my wife.  This is Red John, and he 
                    wanted to make sure I'd be on the 
                    case.  

                                  LISBON
                    Look, it's strange.  I'll give you 
                    that.  But you're jumping to 
                      conclusions.  There's no way to 
                    tell for sure who... 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Footsteps"    GREEN 4/03/09    4.

      CONTINUED: (3)11

      One by one, Van Pelt, Cho, Rigsby and Hardy all look up at 
      the sky.  Lisbon and Jane see this and look up also.  

      POV -- In the clear blue sky, a LIGHT PLANE IS SKYWRITING, 
      with smoke, finishing up a wide circle, and then creating two 
      dots for eyes.  Jane and the CBI team are silenced.  Holy 
      fuck. 

                                    SHERIFF HARDY
                    What the hell?

      The little PLANE DRAWS the curve of a smile, five hundred 
      yards wide.  The predatory look on Jane  s face is almost 
      sinister.  The hunt is on. 

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. PLASKETT HOUSE - DAY (D/1 CONT'D)22

      A Victorian farmhouse in the country.  Two cars and a 
      sheriff's department cruiser outside.  Jane and Lisbon and 
      Hardy get out of Hardy's vehicle and approach the Plaskett 
      front door, where a DEPUTY is standing. 

      Hardy takes a wad of gum from his mouth, tosses it.  

                                    SHERIFF HARDY
                    Man, this nicotine gum is like 
                    chewing on a tire. 

                                  LISBON
                    Tell us about the family.

                                    SHERIFF HARDY
                    Old money.  Mr. Plaskett's an 
                      architect.  Mom's a sculptor.  
                    There's been Plasketts in the 
                    county since before there was a 
                    county.  Which counts around here. 
                    I've been in town ten years and I'm 
                    still the new guy.   

      The Sheriff is interrupted by ARDEN PLASKETT as they enter... 

33INT. ENTRANCE HALL. PLASKETT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 

      Jane, Lisbon and Hardy meet Arden and NOAH, (both 50's). 

      Arden's a Diane Lane type with a drinking problem.  Noah is a 
      Bill Hurt type with a beard, pious spectacles, and a songlike 
      calm that hovers on the edge of irritating. 

                                  ARDEN
                    Maya, where's Maya?  Is Maya 
                    alright?  Where is she?

                                  LISBON
                    We don't know as yet, ma'am.  
                    But every effort is --

                                  ARDEN
                    -- Where is she?  Where is she?!

      Noah takes Arden's hand, tries to calm her.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Footsteps"    GREEN 4/03/09    6.

      CONTINUED:33

                                  NOAH
                    Arden, they don't know where she 
                    is.  We must let them do their 
                    jobs.

      He helps her sit down, where she subsides into quiet sobbing.

                                  JANE
                    There's a brother, isn't there?  
                    Where's he?

                                  NOAH
                    On his way here.  He lives up in 
                      Parkersville.

                                  JANE 
                    Can we see the girls' bedroom?

                                  NOAH
                    Uh, sure.  Of course.

      INT. TWINS' BEDROOM - DAY44

      Noah leads Jane and Lisbon into a large room with two beds 
      one at either end.

                                  NOAH
                    ...We tried having them sleep in 
                    separate bedrooms, but it never 
                    took.  They prefer to be together.

      From the doorway, Jane and Lisbon look around the room.  A 
      typical teenage girl's room, doubled.

                                  NOAH (CONT'D)
                    In your professional judgment, do 
                    you think that Maya is dead also?

                                  JANE
                    Yes. 

      Lisbon shoots him an admonishing glance.

                                  LISBON
                    We keep an open mind and assume 
                    she s alive.  There's always hope.

                                  JANE
                    Not much.

                                  NOAH
                    I see.  Thank you for your candor.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Footsteps"    GREEN 4/03/09    7.

      Beat.

                                  LISBON
                    Perhaps your wife needs you with 
                    her, Mr. Plaskett.

      Noah perceives Lisbon's meaning -- she'd rather they look 
      around the room without his presence.

                                  NOAH
                    Yes of course.

      Noah exits.  Jane and Lisbon move around the room, gently 
      scanning the contents by touch and sight.  The following 
      dialogue covers that scanning -- PHOTOS, sports trophies, pop 
      stars, cuddly toys.  (The distinctions are very subtle, but 
      Emma is the darker, risk-taking twin.  Maya more sunny and 
        conventional...)    

                                  LISBON
                    Why so cruel?  And since when do 
                    you care about statistics?

                      Statistically, it's Dad that did 
                    it.  I wanted to raise his pulse a 
                    little.

                    Hold on.  This is a Red John case 
                    now.  The cutting style, the 
                    painted toenails, the skywriting, 
                    put them together, it s hard to 
                    dismiss.

                                  JANE
                    Yes, it s Red John alright.  But   
                    someone else is involved.  Else why 
                    has he changed his MO so radically?  
                      Skywriting? 

                                  LISBON
                    He wanted to be sure that the CBI, 
                    that you would be on the case.  
                    He's luring you into some kind of 
                    trap, obviously. 

      Jane seems to think that's a good thing.

                    Yes, that's part of it.  But why 
                    take them from a car, instead of 
                    catching them home alone like he s 
                    always done before?  And why two 
                    victims at once?  Why twins?  Why 
                    break pattern?

                                  LISBON
                    He broke pattern once before.

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  He broke pattern because it 
                    was personal.  He wanted to punish 
                    me.

      Hardy bangs on the front door.  No reply.

      MACE GUTHRIE comes out of a window, hits an oncoming DEPUTY 
      with a length of wood; and books it down the alleyway.  The 
      second Deputy appears only in time to draw his gun and aim 
      before Guthrie dodges around a corner and out of our sight.  
      The Deputy gives chase.  Lisbon and Jane and Hardy come from

      The Deputy nods, a little shamefaced.  The other Deputy 
      returns limping, telegraphing a shrug to say "lost him."  
      Guthrie's dog comes out into the yard and barks at them all 
      through the fence.

      Cho and Rigsby talking to a middle-aged Asian Lady 
      OWNER/MANAGER behind the counter.  Copy machines, stationery 
      supplies, a wall of mailboxes.

      The Store Owner smiles at officialdom as she knows she 
      must... 

                                  STORE OWNER
                    Yes?  Okay.

                    A suite is like, a room.  
                    An office.

                                  STORE OWNER
                    A suite is a box.  You have a small 
                    company, you look big. 

                                  CHO
                    Okay, we need to open box 121.  And 
                    we need all the information you 
                    have on who rented it.

                                  STORE OWNER
                    No problem.  You have a warrant?

                    Ma'am, this is a murder 
                      investigation.  

      This usually makes people sit up and cooperate, but the Store 
      Owner merely nods cordially.

                                  RIGSBY
                    We can get a warrant, but it takes 
                    time and time is of the essence.

                          (still smiling amenably)
                    No problem.  Go get a warrant.  
                    I'll be here.  Following the law.  

      Cho and Rigsby stare at her a moment, stymied.  She studies 
      Cho appraisingly.

      EXT. ALLEYWAY. GUTHRIE'S PLACE - A MOMENT LATER1212

      One of the Deputies is poised, ready to open the door to the 
      yard, with a stick in his hand.  Hardy is at the wheel of his 
      cruiser, Lisbon next to him.  Jane in the backseat.  Hardy 
      nods.  The Deputy opens the gate.  The dog streaks out of the 
      yard and down the alleyway in the same direction that Guthrie 
      went.  Hardy's cruiser follows.  

      EXT. SAN ANGELO STREET - DAY1313

      VARIOUS SHOTS:  Guthrie's dog comes at a steady trot, 
      snuffling, following a scent.  Half a block back comes 
      Hardy's cruiser, following the dog.

      EXT. HOUSE CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY1414

      A half renovated house surrounded by a chain link fence.  
      Guthrie's dog leans up against the fence on its hind legs, 
      looking in.  Hardy's cruiser pulls up.  Jane et al get out.

      EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE SHED - DAY1515

      Hardy and Lisbon have guns drawn as they open the shed door.  
      Inside, standing against the back wall looking awkward with 
      nowhere to hide, is Mace Guthrie.

      FADE IN:

      INT. CBI HQ. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT (N/1)1616

      Guthrie seated, cuffed, restless.  Jane enters, pulls up a 
      chair, sits down.  Jane studies Guthrie for a moment.

                                    GUTHRIE
                    What?

                                  JANE
                    Emma and Maya Plaskett.

      Guthrie looks wary all of a sudden.  

                                    GUTHRIE
                    What about them?

                                  JANE
                    You didn't hear?  It's all over the 
                    TV news.  

                                    GUTHRIE
                          (like I watch the news)
                    TV news.  What?

                                  JANE
                    Emma was found horribly murdered 
                    this morning.  Maya's missing. 

      Guthrie reacts with horrified surprise.

                                    GUTHRIE
                    Oh no.  Oh God.

                                  JANE
                    Were you in a sexual relationship 
                    with either of them?

                                    GUTHRIE
                    No.  No.

                    Really.

                                    GUTHRIE
                    No.  Never.  Maybe hung with them a 
                    couple or so times.  That's it. 

      Jane studies him.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Footsteps"    GREEN 4/03/09    18.

                    Mace, I see that you cared for Emma 
                    and Maya, and I see that you're 
                    lying to me.  That's a bad idea.  

                                    GUTHRIE
                    I got nothing to do with this.

                                  JANE
                    Please understand something.        
                    I have a deeply personal interest 
                    in this case.  I will do whatever 
                    it takes.  I will have you framed 
                    for murder, I will torture you,    
                    I will kill you myself.  Whatever 
                    it takes.   

      Guthrie's taken aback.  Unseen by Guthrie, Jane wags a finger 
      for the benefit of those in the observation room.  "I'm just 
      kidding."

      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS1717

                    straight.  He would do all that he 
                    said, and more, if you let him.

                    Emma and me had a thing.  She ah, I 
                    don't know what she saw in me, but 
                    she liked me, you know?  Both those

                    So me and Emma had been hooking up 
                    for a month or so, and I get a 
                    phone call.  Some guy I don't know 
                    says stay away from her or else, 
                    and hangs up before I can tell him 
                    to eat it. 

                                  JANE
                    Describe his voice.

                                    GUTHRIE

                    No.  Course not.  I kept on seeing 
                    her.  
                          (beat)
                    But then one morning couple weeks

                    pig's head on the pillow next to 
                    me.  I lock and bolt the doors at 
                    night.  There s no way someone gets 
                    in.  But they did.  Mental, yeah?  
                    Spooked the hell out of me.  I'm 
                    into Emma and all, but I've been 
                    staying away from her since then.

                    No.  Thing is, me and Emma were on 
                    the down low.  Nobody knew.  She 
                    insisted on that.  So how did he 
                    know?  He must have been spying on 
                    her real close. 
                          (beat, thinks)
                    How did you people know?

      EXT. SAN ANGELO - DAY (D/2)2020

      A gorgeous day amid rolling fertile green fields, the sun 
      just risen over mountains clear on the horizon.  

      EXT. PLASKETT HOUSE - DAY2121

      Jane and Lisbon walk up to the front door.  DRAKE PLASKETT 
      (late 20's) comes out to meet them.  He's a tall earnest Ivy 
      Leaguer of the Saab-driving eco-liberal, good friends with 
      one of the young Kennedys, variety.  Right now, he's looking 
      tired and anguished, but putting up a good stoic front. 

                                  DRAKE
                    Good morning.  I'm Drake Plaskett.  
                    Maya and Emma's brother.

                    Agent Lisbon, Jane.

      Arden Plaskett comes from the house, looking like a long 
      day's journey into night.

                                  ARDEN
                    Have you found Maya?  

                                  LISBON
                    No, ma'am.  But the search for her 
                    is continuing with every available 
                    resource, I assure you.

                                  ARDEN
                    Where have you looked for her?

                                  LISBON
                      I couldn't tell you exactly, ma'am.

      Lisbon, Jane with Noah, Arden, and Drake...

                                  LISBON 
                    You said it was Drake who told you 
                    about Guthrie, yes?

                                  NOAH
                    Yes.

                          (to Drake)
                    How did you know about him?

      Drake clears his throat.

                                  DRAKE
                    Around a month ago, I'd say, I was 
                    staying the weekend, and I 
                    overheard the girls talking, Maya 
                    telling Emma that this Guthrie 
                    character was dangerous and she 
                    should be careful.  Naturally, I 
                    was very concerned.  I told my 
                    parents. 

                                  NOAH
                    And we decided to confront Emma 
                    about it.

                                  LISBON
                    I see.  If we can sit down and take 
                      a statement from you, Drake, that 
                    would be helpful.

                                  DRAKE 
                    Of course.  Anything you need.

      Jane enters.  Jane stands still and gazes about for a long 
      moment, closes his eyes, breathes in deep via his nose.  Then 
      starts roaming the room, humming gently as searches.

      INT. LIVING ROOM. PLASKETT HOUSE - DAY2424

      Lisbon talks with Drake.

                                  DRAKE
                    I live in Parkersville.  About

                    You're a teacher, is it?

                                  DRAKE
                    Yes.  English and Classics at the 
                    Enright Academy. 

                                  LISBON 
                    Married?  Single?

                                  DRAKE
                    Single.  Mother says I'm too picky.   

      He glances upstairs off footsteps.  Is he nervous?

2525INT. TWINS' BEDROOM. PLASKETT HOUSE - DAY 

      Jane sits down at a large and cluttered vanity table, that 
      serves as a kind of general work station for the girls.  Jane 
      looks at himself in the mirror, looks up.  Sees something.  

      POV -- On top of the wall moulding, something that glints.   

      He uses the chair to climb up onto the table, and looks 
      closer.  He reaches up and feels around and pulls a tiny 
      CAMERA and MICROPHONE UNIT from concealment.   

                                  JANE
                    Lisbon!

      There's a very thin wire attached.  Jane pulls on the wire 
      and follows it around the room, peeling it away off the top 
      of the wall moulding until it disappears behind a heavy 
      wardrobe. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Lisbon!

      CONTINUED:2525

      Jane pushes the wardrobe away from the wall.  The camera wire 
      goes into a hole in the skirting board, a section of which 
      seems loose.  He levers the skirting board away from the 
      wall, and using the wire, lifts out a very small TRANSMITTER. 
      Lisbon and the Plaskett family enter.  Jane holds up what 
      he s found.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Camera, microphone, and 
                      transmitter. 

      Jane pokes out his tongue at the little camera and pulls the 
      wire out of the transmitter.

      Arden groans with disgust and horror.

                                  NOAH
                    Someone was spying on our 
                      daughters?  

                                  LISBON
                    Who had access to the room?  

                                  ARDEN
                    Nobody.  Just us.  And Janine, the 
                      housekeeper.

                                  LISBON
                    Nobody else?

                                  NOAH
                    No.  Nobody.

      Beat.  Jane and Lisbon settle their gaze on Drake.

                                  JANE
                    Drake, how are your electronics 
                    skills?

                                  DRAKE
                    You're accusing me of this?  

                                  JANE
                    No need to sound so outraged. 
                    Let's be fair, you are the 
                    likeliest suspect.  You can see 
                    that.

                                  LISBON
                    You said yourself, you overheard an 
                    intimate private conversation 
                    between them.

                    sisters.  I love them. 

                                  JANE
                    Nobody doubts that.

                                  LISBON 
                    No one else had access to their 
                    room, did they?

                                  DRAKE
                    You people spend too much time in 
                    the gutters, dredging up filth.  
                    You begin to think the whole world 
                    is dirty.  But it's not.  It's you 
                    that's become dirty. 

                                  JANE
                    True.  Sad but true.  But that 
                    doesn't make you clean.

                                  ARDEN
                    That's right.

                                  NOAH
                    They broke the kitchen door to get 
                    in.  Took some cash and liquor and 
                    broke a few vases.  We assumed it 
                    was teenagers on a spree.  

                                  LISBON
                    That would make a good cover.  Did

                    We got the warrant and we're about 
                    to open the mail box.  Jane said he 
                    wanted to be on the line when we

      Cho nods.  They wait.  The Store Owner enters from back of 
      store, gives Cho a PHOTO.  Cho takes it very reluctantly.

                                  STORE OWNER
                    My niece.  Beautiful like a movie 
                    star.  Only well behaved.

      Cho's actually kind of struck by the photo.  Rigsby has a 
      look at her too, and is impressed.

                                  CHO
                    Yes.  She's attractive.

      Behind Cho's back, still with phone to ear, Rigsby pantomimes 
      his intention to give the Store Owner Cho's name and number, 
      then speaks into phone...

      CBI car moving through idyllic countryside toward the

                    Dear Roy, I found this address on a 
                    business card of yours that I 
                      discovered down the back of the

                    may find you.  If it does, and you 
                    are reading this, I just want to 
                    say that I still love you very much 
                    despite the very cruel way you 
                    treated me, and I hope you will 
                    come back to me one day.  With all

                    It's him.  I know it.  This Roy 
                      Tagliaferro is Red John.

                    We don't know that.

                    We know it was Red John killed 
                    Emma.  So we can assume it was Red 
                    John hired the skywriter.  
                    The skywriter got the order from   
                    R-Jay Solutions, and R-Jay 
                    Solutions is Roy Tagliaferro.  
                    Hence Roy Tagliaferro is Red John.

                                  LISBON
                    Maybe.

                    We're close.  We're very close.

                    You've thought that before now.   
                    And you had that exact same bright 
                    look in your eye.  Red John was a 
                    step ahead of us the whole time.

                    Yes, but this time, I don't think 
                    so.  I think he's made a mistake.  
                    He can't possibly have known 
                    Rosalind would write to him, or 
                    that we'd find the letter.  It's 
                    luck.  One in a million luck.  This 
                    woman Rosalind has seen Red John,

2929EXT. ROSALIND HARKER'S HOUSE. HATTIESBURG - DAY 

      A nice ordinary little house on an ordinary SMALL TOWN 
      STREET.  Jane and Lisbon approach the front door. 

      Inside, A BACH FUGUE IS BEING PLAYED EXPERTLY ON A GOOD 
      PIANO.  Lisbon RINGS THE DOORBELL.  The MUSIC STOPS.

                                  JANE
                    We're sure this is the right

                    There are only two Rosalinds in the 
                      Hattiesburg phone book.  The other 
                    one is seventy-three, married.

      The door is opened by a luminously beautiful woman, (30's) 
      ROSALIND HARKER.  There's an eerie grace about her.

      EXT. ROSALIND'S HOUSE - DAY (D/2 CONT'D)3030

      Rosalind stands in the doorway opposite Jane and Lisbon.

                                  ROSALIND
                    Roy Tagliaferro?  Yes, I know a man 
                    of that name.  What about him?  
                    What's happened?  How did you find

                                  LISBON
                    You sent him a letter last 
                      Christmas.  It surfaced during an 
                      investigation we're conducting. 

                                  ROSALIND
                    You read my letter. 

                                  LISBON

                    What are you investigating?

                                  ROSALIND
                    Not a thing.  Until you tell me why 
                    you want to know.

      Jane and Lisbon look at each other.

                                  JANE
                    We believe he could be a serial 
                    murderer named Red John.  

      Rosalind lets that sink in without displaying her feelings.

                    so in the letter.

      Rosalind tries to shut the door, but Jane blocks it with his 
      foot.  Rosalind retreats upstairs.

      Jane climbs the stairs.

      Beat.  Jane waits for a response.  Gets none.

                    This same man, Red John, killed my

                    That's okay.  Everybody makes

                                  JANE
                    Maybe what it is, Red John is using 
                    Roy's identity somehow, as a cover.  
                    If we could find Roy, he might help 
                    us find Red John. 

      Rosalind thinks about that.

                    cruel to you.

                                  ROSALIND
                    Very cruel.  He left one day and he 
                    just never came back.  Never told 
                    me goodbye, or why he was leaving. 
                    Or where he was going.

                    Just vanished.  It's been nearly 
                    six months now.   

                                  JANE
                    Describe him. 

                                  ROSALIND
                    Just under six feet tall.  Not 
                    muscular, but not soft either. 
                    Short straight hair.  A gentle 
                    voice.  Rough strong hands.  He 
                    smelt of pine and nails and earth.  
                    He liked to listen to me play the 
                    piano.  

                                  JANE
                    What was his favorite music?

                                  ROSALIND
                    Bach.  He admired his rigor.

                                  LISBON
                    Did anyone else ever see him?  The 
                    mailman, a cleaning lady?

                                  ROSALIND
                    No.  I lead a fairly solitary life. 

                                  LISBON
                    Did he mention any of his friends?  
                    People he worked with?  

                                  ROSALIND
                    No.  But he did bring a friend of 
                    his over once.  For Thanksgiving. 
                    Dumar.

                                  ROSALIND
                    Just Dumar.  Somewhat of a rube, 
                    but amiable.  Couldn't believe a 
                    blind woman could cook.  Came

                    He smoked a lot.  Said he was 
                    trying to quit, but he smoked so 
                    much he had to run out to the store 
                    to buy more cigarettes.  
                          (smiles)
                    When he came back, he'd bought a 
                    stuffed toy elephant as a gift for me.  
                          (beat, recalling)
                    That was a good day.  Roy came a 
                    couple more times, and that was it.  
                    Gone.

                    Yes.  I do.

      She points.  The stuffed TOY ELEPHANT has its own spot on a 
      shelf.

                    someone will remember selling the 
                    elephant and cigarettes together. 
                    It was Thanksgiving.  

                                  CHO
                    Will do.

                                  LISBON 
                    Don't lose the elephant.  She wants 
                    it back.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Nope.  There's nobody named Roy 
                      Tagliaferro anyplace in the 
                    database.  It must be an alias.  

                                    MINELLI
                    Keep digging.  Maybe it's a company 
                    name.  Or it's listed abroad 
                      somewhere.  And try the name in 
                    English.  Tagliaferro means Cut

                                  VAN PELT
                    Thank you, sir.  That's a good 
                    idea.

                                  LISBON
                    Nope.  The Sheriff confirmed there 
                    was a break-in at the Plaskett 
                    House.  The camera probably went in 
                    then.  But they got no prints, no 
                    leads.  Sheriff figured it was 
                      teenagers, like Mr. Plaskett said.

                    Still, it could have been the

                                  JANE
                    Keep us for what?

                                    SHERIFF HARDY
                    Oh you'll have to wait and see. 
                    It's going to be so much fun. 

                                  LISBON
                    Hardy, put the gun down.

      Lisbon's behind Hardy!  Her gun pointed at his head.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    Put it down.  Slowly.

                                    SHERIFF HARDY
                    Crap.  Listen...

                                  LISBON
                    Do it!

      Hardy puts down the shotgun.  

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    Put your hands behind your head.

      Hardy puts his hands behind his head.  But doesn't seem as 
      worried as he should be.  

                                    SHERIFF HARDY
                    Bravo.  Fooled us uh?  You never 
                    did go see the judge.  

      Jane's annoyed with Lisbon.

                                  JANE
                    Dammit, Lisbon.  You were supposed 
                    to wait until Red John shows 
                    himself.

      Lisbon's on high alert, tense...

                    Couldn't take the chance.  Red 
                    John's long gone anyhow.  Don't 
                    move!

      Hardy stops moving...

                                    SHERIFF HARDY
                    You faked that warrant argument 
                    huh?  To lure me into the open. 
                    Slick.  How did you know it was me? 

                                  JANE
                    Rosalind mentioned that Dumar was a 
                    heavy smoker, who was trying to 
                    quit.  And you chew that nicotine 
                    gum all the time.  And it was you 
                    that staged a break-in at the 
                    Plaskett house, so you could plant 
                    the camera.

                                    SHERIFF HARDY

                                  JANE
                    I'm a good guesser.

      Hardy spits out his gum.

                                    SHERIFF HARDY
                    Yeah.  You must think you're pretty 
                    cool right now, huh?

      Lisbon approaches very carefully to put cuffs on Hardy.

                                  LISBON
                    Stay very still.

                    I tell you what, girly, if you 
                    surrender now, I'll try and 
                    persuade Red John to kill you quick 
                    and clean, not slow and nasty.

                    Shut up...

      She's reaching out to put cuffs on Hardy's wrists, when the 
      LIGHTS GO OUT, and the hatch at the end of the passage is 
      slammed shut, plunging the room into COMPLETE DARKNESS. 
      SOUNDS of a fierce struggle between Lisbon and Hardy.    THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Footsteps"    GREEN 4/03/09    50.

5353EXT. SPARROW PEAK FARM - CONTINUOUS 

      The CBI van, driven by Rigsby, with Cho in passenger side, 
      goes crashing through the front gate.  Speeds up the driveway 
      to the front door of the farmhouse.  A couple hundred yards 
      back come two CHP MOTORCYCLE COPS.

      INT. SPARROW PEAK FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS5454

      Rigsby and Cho come in fast, but careful, with guns and 
      flashlights up.

      THEIR POV - As they move through...

      The once locked room is open, the door wide.  Inside we can 
      see that the TV is off.  

      CLOSE ANGLE -- The BACK DOOR IS STILL VIBRATING SLIGHTLY, and 
      we catch a glimpse of a man's shadow.  But Cho and Rigsby 
      don't see it because...

      Jane blinking in the light.

      INT. UNDERGROUND ROOM - A FEW MOMENTS LATER5555

      Hardy lies unconscious and cuffed on the floor, bleeding from 
      a head wound.

      Jane takes the key off the nail and unlocks the door to Maya 
      Plaskett's cell.  Lisbon opens the door.     THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Footsteps"    GREEN 4/03/09    51.

      Maya's staring at the door eyes wide, but her eyes go wider 
      still at sight of Lisbon, Jane just behind her.  Lisbon shows 
      her badge. 

                                  LISBON
                    You're safe, Maya.  

      Maya stares at them.  She stands up slowly and moves toward 
      them and Lisbon goes to her -- they come together in an 
      awkward, but heartfelt embrace.

      Jane and Lisbon alone for a moment.  Outside, the noise and 
      bustle of Cops and Forensics arriving.

                    He was here.  Red John was right 
                    here.  We were this close to 
                    catching him.

                    You think?  You should have waited.  
                    We agreed.

      Jane feels bad for criticizing Lisbon so fiercely, and backs

      Lisbon wants to say more, but Two Forensics Techs in WHITE 
      JUMPSUITS and masks go up through the hatch, carrying amongst 
      other evidence, Hardy's SHOTGUN.  Lisbon follows them out

      custody before being loaded onto an ambulance.

      Walking away toward the road, Cho and Rigsby herding away TWO 
      DEPUTIES -- subordinates of Hardy's who can't believe what 
      they're hearing --

                    Your boss was obsessed with Maya 
                    Plaskett.  Staged a break-in at her 
                    house so that he could plant a 
                    camera in her bedroom.  Watched her 
                    for months and schemed with Red 
                    John to abduct her and her sister 
                    and use them as bait to catch Jane 
                    as well.

      Cho and Rigsby get in their car and drive off.

      CLOSE ON Hardy -- He's very very slowly using his free hand 
      to pull a HANDCUFF KEY from a hiding place in the back of his 
      belt.

      Lisbon approaches Maya who is sitting in the backseat of a 
      POLICE CAR, wrapped in a blanket.

                    Maya, I have to sign some paperwork 
                    with the forensics people, and then 
                    we'll take you home.  Okay?

                    I'm good.  Thank you.

      Maya's face turns ashen and her eyes go wide -- Lisbon turns 
      to see what Maya's reacting to... 

      HER POV -- Hardy uses the CHP Officer's own gun to shoot him 
      dead.  BLAAAM!  And then Hardy TURNS AND COMES AT LISBON AND 
      MAYA.  Cho and Rigsby and the other Officers are out of 
      sight.  Lisbon's gun is holstered.

      Lisbon's unharmed.

      MOS -- BACH'S PRELUDE in C major from the well tempered 
      clavier plays over....

      Jane stands by the evidence table, shotgun smoking in his 
      hands.  He puts down the gun and goes to Hardy, as does 
      Lisbon.  They kneel on either side of the dying man.  Hardy 
      smiles at Jane, makes a lip-zipping gesture and dies.  Jane 
      and Lisbon look at each other...

      MOS -- Maya gets out of the Marshal's car as Arden, Noah and 
      Drake come running to greet her.  They embrace joyfully, 
      filled with love and deep relief.  Jane and Lisbon get out of 
      the car.   

      After a moment, Arden breaks away to go to Lisbon and thank 
      her effusively.
