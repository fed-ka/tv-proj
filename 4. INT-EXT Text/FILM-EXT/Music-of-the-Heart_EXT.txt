ASSUNTA GUASPARI (58), Roberta's slender, tired Italian-
American mother, stands in the doorway of a well-tended
working-class home, addressing a young NAVAL OFFICER who
holds a lengthy delivery inventory. It's a gray day with
ominous storm clouds. Late 70's CARS are parked on the street.
ASSUNTA
But I have no room for this!
OFFICER
I'm sorry, M'am. We have orders to
deliver these.
Assunta looks beyond the man, dismayed.
HER POV
Large wooden CRATES cover her front lawn, and TWO MOVERS
plant down another. They hurry back to the TRUCK, grabbing
the next crate too quickly this time. It slips from their
hands, CRASHES to the ground and splinters open. Several
VIOLIN CASES spill out. The crate looks like it holds a whole
lot more.
BACK TO SCENE
Instantly a second-story window is flung open, and Roberta
sticks her head out, a hundred times more energized than
we've seen her so far.
ROBERTA
Watch it, you idiots! Be careful
with those!
The men scramble to pick them up. Assunta looks at all the
violins, then up at Roberta.
ASSUNTA
Why so many?
Roberta disappears inside and slams the window shut.
A SALSA SONG PLAYS OVER as we see stores with Spanish names
and signs; Black and Latino elementary school children walking
home from school; some burned-out buildings; Black and Latino
teens playing basketball on a cement court; Spanish graffiti
on walls; elderly women buying fruit at a produce stand.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL this is the POV of Roberta from the back
seat of a cab. The SALSA SONG plays on the cab's radio.
Roberta looks scared shitless.
Suddenly, two YOUNG MEN flash down the middle of the street,
dart IN FRONT of the cab and the driver SLAMS on the brakes,
jerking Roberta forward.
TAXI DRIVER
Welcome to East Harlem.
HARLEM - ESTABLISHING - DAY
Roberta knocks on Janet's door.
JANET (O.S.)
Yes?
As Roberta opens the door, we see that Nick and Lexi are
with her. All three have violins. INSIDE, Janet's in
conversation with DENNIS RAUSCH (38), an uptight man with a
tie that doesn't match his suit jacket. He's showing Janet a
large scheduling chart.
ROBERTA
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I wanted
you to meet my sons -- Nick, Lexi...
They enter.
Roberta walks through a school yard filled with kids and
parents picking them up. She sees Naeem and crosses to him.
ROBERTA
Where were you today, Naeem?
NAEEM
I can't be in violin class anymore.
ROBERTA
Why not?
NAEEM
My mother won't let me.
ROBERTA
What?
NAEEM'S MOTHER, MRS. ADISA, steps INTO FRAME. She's an
attractive Black woman in a dress and head scarf made of
African fabric.
MRS. ADISA
My son's got more important things
to do than learn dead white men's
music.
ROBERTA
They're gonna learn "Twinkle Twinkle
Little Star"!
MRS. ADISA
How many Black classical composers
can you name? How many Black classical
violinists do you know?
ROBERTA
That doesn't mean it's the way it
should be. Naeem's learning to play
music -- and that makes him feel
good about himself. Why should it
matter who wrote it?
NAEEM
Please, Mom? Can't I be in the class?
Mrs. Adisa puts a protective arm around her son, then
addresses Roberta.
MRS. ADISA
Look. I've seen this before. You
white women come up here and think
you can rescue our poor inner city
children who never asked to be rescued
in the first place. No thank you.
She walks off with Naeem. He glances back at Roberta, then
turns away quickly. Roberta watches after them.
Lots of noise and chaos as kids run wild during lunch recess.
Janet rushes through the throngs while Roberta tries to keep
up.
ROBERTA
I thought all the teachers agreed to
this.
JANET
In theory.
(to a student)
Adam! I want you in my office right
after lunch, you understand?
ADAM
What'd I do?
JANET
Think about it!
(to Roberta)
Whenever you pull kids out, it's a
disruption, plus it's extra work for
the teacher 'cause they have to fill
the kids in on what they missed.
Some teachers resent it.
ROBERTA
Well, can't you talk to them?
Janet stops walking and pulls a box cutter out of her pocket.
JANET
I took this off a second-grader this
morning. I'll help you Roberta --
but I can't hold your hand here.
Janet starts to walk away, then turns.
JANET
A word of advice? When you're picking
up your students, go to Alice's
classroom first.
Roberta stands there as Janet walks on ahead.
Roberta enters the yard from inside the school. It's filled
with kids playing, including Nick and Lexi. She waves to
them and Lexi runs up to her, carrying a piece of artwork.
LEXI
Look what I made you, Mommy!
He gives her a tempera PAINTING of a man's face, the
background decorated with glued-on macaroni. It says DADDY.
ROBERTA
(covering her
discomfort)
That is so beautiful!
He runs off. Roberta exhales, sits down alone on a bench and
takes out her lunch. She smiles at ALICE CROWLEY and another
TEACHER but they cross to another bench. ISABEL VASQUEZ (25)
approaches, a lively Puerto Rican woman with a strong New
York accent.
ISABEL
Whatsa matter -- you got cooties?
ROBERTA
Apparently.
ISABEL
I'll take my chances.
(extends a hand)
Isabel Vasquez. Second grade.
ROBERTA
Roberta Demetras. I'm the --
ISABEL
Violin teacher. I know.
She sits down beside Roberta, takes out her lunch.
ROBERTA
Is it my imagination, or does everyone
hate me?
ISABEL
It's hard to fit in when you're doing
a special program. People figure
you're not gonna be here very long,
so why make the effort?
(beat)
It may take a while for folks to
warm up, but nobody hates you.
ROBERTA
(sotto)
What about Alice Crowley?
ISABEL
(sotto)
A) she thinks the violin's a waste
of time... and B) -- she's a bitch.
Roberta laughs.
ROBERTA
And then there's Dennis.
ISABEL
The Music Man. You've had the bodacity
to threaten his private little empire --
not to mention the fact that you
messed up his sacred scheduling chart.
ROBERTA
How come you're being nice to me?
ISABEL
Ulterior motives. I want my daughter
in your class next year.
Roberta smiles.
ROBERTA
If I'm here next year.
ISABEL
You will be.
A group of kids stand together with their violins and chat.
Roberta exits the building and they greet her. She waves
back, but she's clearly still upset by her interaction with
Lucy. She sees Naeem and his mother and approaches them.
NAEEM
Hi, Roberta.
ROBERTA
Hi, Naeem. Can I talk to your mom
for a minute?
Naeem nods and moves off.
ROBERTA
Look, I didn't come up here to rescue
anybody. I'm a single mother and I
needed a job. And I know you think
you're protecting your son, but you're
not. I mean, what if Arthur Ashe's
mother had stopped him from playing
tennis because it's a "white man's
game"?
(beat)
The important thing is that when
Naeem plays music, his whole face
lights up. You should see him.
Mrs. Adisa takes this in. Roberta exits. Mrs. Adisa looks
for Naeem and sees him watching the violin students, longing
to be among them. She watches her son with compassion.
Roberta and the boys shop in a colorful outdoor produce market
in their neighborhood.
The boys suddenly rush over to A MAN sitting on the ground
with mixed-breed PUPPIES in a cardboard box. The boys pet
them excitedly. Roberta watches her sons; they're happier
than she's seen them in ages.
A mild winter day. Roberta, covered with plaster dust and
overheated from working, leans against a car and drinks a
beer. The three-story brick building has some graffiti on it
and is badly in need of a paint job; there are a few broken
windows, and the front stairs need repairing. WORKMEN file
in and out. We can see from the STREET SIGNS that we're on
118th STREET, a few houses off FIRST AVENUE.
Brian (also dust-covered), Nick and Lexi toss around a
football. LAWRENCE (6), a Black boy who lives next door,
joins them. Brian crosses to Roberta, sweaty and out of
breath. He takes a swig of her beer.
ROBERTA
O.K., enough goofing off -- back to
work.
BRIAN
You trying to kill me?
She laughs and they kiss.
ASSUNTA comes up the street with a bag of take-out food. She
casts a dubious glance at the lovers.
ASSUNTA
I was the only person in the whole
coffee shop not speaking Spanish.
Roberta rolls her eyes. O.S. a car BACKFIRES.
ASSUNTA
You hear that? Gunshots! How you
gonna live here by yourself?
(calling)
Boys, come eat!
ROBERTA
I work in this neighborhood, Mama. I
want to live here.
The boys approach and Assunta hands them sandwiches. Lawrence
hangs back. Assunta calls to him.
ASSUNTA
What's your name?
LAWRENCE
Lawrence.
ASSUNTA
You hungry, Lawrence?
Lawrence nods and she hands him a sandwich. Roberta smiles
at her mother's gesture. The kids move off to Lawrence's
front steps and Assunta gives Roberta and Brian sandwiches.
ASSUNTA
(to Brian)
Why did you let her buy this house?
BRIAN
Hey, your daughter does what she
wants -- or haven't you noticed?
ASSUNTA
I've noticed.
Lots of screaming and commotion as the kids crowd around a
fight in progress. As we move through the crowd we see that
NICK's in a fight with another boy; Nick's nose is bleeding
and he has the boy in a headlock. TWO TEACHERS run over to
break it up.
Brian, Nick and Lexi laugh as they play frisbee alongside a
DUCK POND. Roberta watches, relieved to see Nick enjoying
himself.
BRIAN
Good catch Nick!
Nick throws it back to Brian and it lands in the WATER.
BRIAN
(mock sternly)
Uh-oh. You know what that means?
He stalks towards Nick menacingly, picks him up and pretends
he's going to throw him into the water. Nick laughs
hysterically.
NICK
(through laughter)
Don't! Don't throw me in!
BRIAN
Whatsa matter? Afraid of a little
water? The ducks aren't afraid! Are
you a chicken or a duck?
NICK
Don't! Don't throw me!
BRIAN
Looks like you got yourself a chicken,
Roberta!
NICK
I'm not a chicken!
BRIAN
Well then you must be a duck!
He pretends again to throw Nick in, then puts him down. Lexi
holds out his arms to Brian.
LEXI
Throw me in the water, Brian! Do it
to me!
Brian swoops him up and Lexi starts laughing. Roberta laughs
along, happy to see the affection between Brian and her sons.
Brian and Roberta speak as they stroll; the boys run ahead
of them, dragging sticks along the pavement. In the b.g. we
see HARLEM STREETS bordering the park.
ROBERTA
You seem to be the only one who can
get Nick to laugh these days.
BRIAN
He misses his dad. I'm just a
surrogate.
ROBERTA
No -- I think Nick really likes you.
(taking his arm)
You know... we're all hoping you'll
move into the new house with us.
BRIAN
Whoa. Can we just slow down here a
minute? It's too much like getting
married.
ROBERTA
What's so bad about that?
BRIAN
That kind of commitment just isn't
realistic. I mean, how can we know
that you and I will even be able to
stand each other in five years?
ROBERTA
Well, we don't. But if two people
care about each other, they take a
chance.
BRIAN
And look what happened to you and
Charles.
ROBERTA
I'm not talking about Charles. I'm
talking about us.
BRIAN
Look, Roberta. Marriage is based on
a belief that one person can
completely meet another person's
needs. I just don't buy that.
This is making her nervous. She looks at him, afraid of what
he might be saying.
ROBERTA
(carefully)
What are you saying? If there's some
need you have that I don't meet,
you'd go and get it "met" by someone
else?
He heaves a sigh of frustration, not wanting to answer the
question.
BRIAN
I'm saying that it's the 80's and
it's a fantasy to think of marriage
lasting these days. One out of two
marriages ends in divorce!
ROBERTA
You didn't answer my question.
(beat)
If I don't meet all your needs, and
we're in a committed relationship --
forget marriage for a minute; I'm
just talking about a relationship --
would you go to someone else?
A beat.
BRIAN
In theory, yes.
ROBERTA
In theory.
Roberta looks very disheartened. Brian feels badly.
BRIAN
Roberta, we've got something good
right now -- that's the important
thing. Let's just keep it that way,
O.K.?
He pulls her to him, kissing her neck, but she pulls away
from him. ON NICK, observing with an anxious expression.
The side of the building now has an impressive mural: an
urban landscape with three super heroes -- Puerto Rican,
Black, and white -- rising up out of the street. It reads
ONLY THE STRONG SHALL SURVIVE.
The brownstone looks a lot better than when we last saw it.
Graffiti's been removed, the stairs have been repaired, the
windows have security bars, and there are flowers blooming
in pots in front of the building. Roberta steps INTO FRAME,
walking Allegra, now a 10-year-old dog.
Lexi plays basketball with a group of Black and Latino guys.
Despite his small stature, he's a great athlete, and an
accepted part of the group. The game ends. He and his buddy
Lawrence (now 16), both all sweaty, cross to a water fountain.
As Lexi takes a drink --
MALE VOICE (O.S.)
Can I try your bike?
Lexi wipes his mouth and looks up at HENRY (18), a tall,
intimidating Black teenager who towers over him. Lawrence
watches tensely.
LEXI
I'm gonna be leaving pretty soon.
HENRY
Just wanna take it for a spin.
LAWRENCE
C'mon, Henry -- he don't want to
loan you his bike.
HENRY
I didn't hear him say that.
(to Lexi)
Is that true? Did you say that?
Lexi looks at him, knowing there's only one right answer.
Roberta drives with Nick in the front, Lexi and Lawrence in
the back. They're in a dangerous looking part of East Harlem.
LEXI
Mom, please. Don't do this to me!
NICK
C'mon, Mom -- why don't you let me
handle this?
ROBERTA
Are we getting closer, Lawrence?
LAWRENCE
It's the next block up.
LEXI
(to Roberta)
You don't have to do this. I'll pay
you back.
ROBERTA
How? It took me six months to save
up for it.
NICK
I'll help him, O.K.? We'll both pay
you back.
LEXI
Or we'll ask Dad -- he'll help us
out.
ROBERTA
Yeah, right.
LAWRENCE
O.K., slow down. It's the second one
on the right.
Roberta slows the car down next to a HOUSING PROJECT.
Not a place you'd want to go into, even in the day time.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL this is their POV from INSIDE THE CAR.
The boys look frightened, but Roberta's on a mission.
NICK
C'mon Mom, let's get out of here.
ROBERTA
Lock the doors.
And she exits. The boys watch as she heads for the building,
then Lexi shakes his head and covers his face.
LEXI
I'm dead. She's gonna get me killed.
Nick jumps out of the car and heads after her.
NICK
I'm coming with you!
ROBERTA
No. Get back in the car and stay
with the boys.
Nick hesitates and heads back. Roberta presses on. Lawrence
opens the window and calls to her.
LAWRENCE
Don't take the stairs!
Roberta, Nick, Lexi and Lawrence sit on the front steps of
the school. The street is deserted.
LEXI
You're crazy. He's not gonna show.
Roberta sits confidently.
NICK
You think he actually cares that
you're a teacher? You think he even
goes to school?
LEXI
C'mon, Mom -- let's just go.
ROBERTA
It's only five after eleven.
Nick and Lexi roll their eyes and exchange a look: she's
nuts. Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a bicycle. Nick, Lexi
and Lawrence look towards the sound, incredulous. Lexi stands.
Henry rides up on the bike and dismounts. Lexi looks directly
at him as he takes the bike from him.
HENRY
I was just borrowing it.
He glances at Roberta, then walks off.
As Roberta walks through the yard, she sees kids excitedly
showing acceptance letters to their moms.
SHANDRA and MYESHA hold hands as they run to Shandra's mom,
BEVERLY WILSON, pushing a stroller. She looks at the letter
and hugs Shandra.
ANGLE - RAMON reads his letter to his mother, CONCEPCION
(45), whose eyes tell you that she's lived through a lot.
She speaks with a Puerto Rican accent.
RAMON
This is to inform you that your child,
Ramon Olivas, has been chosen by
lottery to be in the violin program.
CONCEPCION
You happy?
Ramon spins round and round with the letter in his hand.
CONCEPCION
I think you're happy.
Roberta illegally parks her old Honda, rushes out of the
car, grabs her book bags and three violins, pulls a parking
ticket from her pocket and puts it on the windshield.
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
(German accent)
Does that really work?
Roberta turns. It's DOROTHEA, the PHOTOGRAPHER we saw in the
classroom.
ROBERTA
No. But I keep trying. And maybe
someday the school will give me a
parking space!
She rushes towards the school and Dorothea follows her.
DOROTHEA
Wait --
She hands Roberta a thin box. Roberta puts down her violins,
glances inside it and forgets about being late.
INSERT
-- Terrific black and white shots of Roberta's advanced
classes playing violin.
ROBERTA (O.S.)
God, these are great.
BACK TO SCENE
DOROTHEA
Those copies are for you.
ROBERTA
Thank you. Can I... pay for you them?
DOROTHEA
Don't be silly. Besides -- you'll
need your money for parking tickets.
They smile at each other.
DOROTHEA
What you're doing for these children
is wonderful. My husband's a violinist --
he was quite impressed when I told
him about you.
ROBERTA
What's his name?
DOROTHEA
Arnold Steinhardt.
ROBERTA
Of the Guarneri String Quartet?
Dorothea nods, and hands Roberta a card.
DOROTHEA
Stay in touch. Let us know when the
kids have a concert.
RACHEL, heading for school, calls out to Roberta.
RACHEL
Don't be late for violin class! I
hear the teacher's really mean.
Roberta smiles, slips the card in her pocket, nods to Dorothea
and follows Rachel.
It's upstairs from a grocery store on a busy street.
Rachel steps off a city bus, carrying her violin. She passes
two sixth-grade boys and a girl.
BOY #1
(loudly)
Ooh, check out little Miss Violinhead.
GIRL
She carry that violin with her all
the time 'cause she think she special.
Rachel turns to them.
RACHEL
I am special.
She proudly continues on, then sees Roberta walking towards
the school and catches up to her.
RACHEL
(nonchalant)
So I heard from Julliard.
Roberta stops and looks at her.
ROBERTA
And?
RACHEL
They said yes!
Roberta gives her a big hug.
As Roberta heads for her car, she sees Vanessa being helped
into a car by her FATHER, his suit wrinkled and tie loosened.
There's SNOW on the ground.
ROBERTA
Mr. Klein? I'm gonna have to drop
Vanessa from the class if she keeps
forgetting her violin.
MR. KLEIN
(sotto)
She's going back and forth between
houses. My wife and I split up.
ROBERTA
(softening)
Oh. I'm sorry.
Roberta leans into the car window.
ROBERTA
Vanessa, maybe you could write down
for your Mom and Dad which days are
violin days.
VANESSA
(almost in tears)
The tape doesn't stick.
ROBERTA
What?
VANESSA
I taped the music to the wall at my
Mom's house and then I took it to my
Dad's house and it doesn't stick
anymore.
Mr. Klein's eyes tear up and he quickly wipes them.
ROBERTA
Well you know what? That's an easy
problem to solve.
She looks through her book bag, takes out a piece of music
and gives it to her.
ROBERTA
Now you have two, O.K.? One for each
house.
Vanessa nods, clutching the piece of music. Roberta and Mr.
Klein exchange a look. She touches his arm, then walks off.
Roberta approaches the school on a winter morning. She smiles
as she sees Vanessa get out of her MOTHER'S car with her
violin. Roberta nears the front door and finds Isabel and
some teachers huddled in conversation. A few students are
crying.
ROBERTA
(to Isabel)
What happened?
Janet and Dennis talk outside Janet's office. Roberta storms
over to them. Janet looks at her, alarmed.
ROBERTA
Is it true?
JANET
Why don't you come in my office?
ROBERTA
It's true? You're firing me?
JANET
It's not me, Roberta. The Board of
Ed. cut the budget, the District had
to comply, and as of the end of this
term, the violin program has been...
excessed.
Roberta takes this in, momentarily speechless. In the b.g.,
the beginners slip into the hall to watch.
ROBERTA
Excessed.
(beat)
They specifically said that my violin
program has to go.
JANET
They've slashed the budget -- music
and art programs got hit the worst.
ROBERTA
What about Dennis' classes?
DENNIS
I'm tenured, Roberta.
Roberta looks at him, then back to Janet.
ROBERTA
When was this decided?
JANET
Things happened very quickly... I
wanted to tell you myself --
ROBERTA
(reeling)
I just... I can't even believe this
is happening!
DENNIS
Why not? You're a sub. Your position
has never been permanent.
JANET
Shut up, Dennis! You're not helping!
(softly, to Roberta)
Come into my office, please.
They leave Dennis standing there, looking as if he's had his
face slapped.
Roberta's dazed and in pain as she walks through the crowds
of children, oblivious to kids calling her name and waving.
Roberta, Nick and Lexi walk Allegra in their neighborhood.
Roberta looks worn out.
ROBERTA
I'm a good teacher. I've worked so
hard to give these kids something to
be proud of.
Lexi moves to comfort her.
LEXI
I'm so sorry, Mom. I can't believe
they did this to you.
ROBERTA
It's like when my father got killed.
For twenty years, he followed every
safety rule the factory had, and
then someone else flips the wrong
switch...
(she chokes up)
It's not fair. You do everything
right and then...
NICK
It's the wrong analogy. You couldn't
do anything about Grandpa's death.
It was irreversible. This isn't.
ROBERTA
Tell that to the Board of Education.
NICK
Let me ask you something. Why did
you risk your life for a bicycle?
Roberta and Lexi look at Nick, baffled as to the relevance
of the question.
ROBERTA
I did not risk my life.
NICK
Of course you did! That building?
Threatening Henry? And for what --
two hundred dollars?
ROBERTA
No. Not for that.
LEXI
Then why?
ROBERTA
When someone steals something that
belongs to my kids, I'm not gonna
sit back and let that happen!
A beat as she realizes what she's just said. The boys look
at her and the three of them stop walking.
ROBERTA
Guys -- you need to think about this.
If I try to fight this -- with no
salary coming in -- I could lose the
house, screw up your college plans...
It would be a lot safer to just go
out tomorrow and get a job in a
private school.
LEXI
Yeah, but is that where you really
want to be?
School's letting out; Carlos' sister exits, carrying Carlos'
violin. A few beats later, Carlos quickly exits, checking
his watch. He sees his LOS LEONES teammates standing in a
group, and tries to bypass them without being noticed, but
they spot him.
TEAMMATE #1
Hey Carlos! Where ya goin'? We got a
game, remember?
CARLOS
Yeah, I know, but... I can't make
it.
TEAMMATE #1
What you talkin' about?
CARLOS
I just can't make it.
TEAMMATE #2
You got a date with the violin
teacher?
A beat.
CARLOS
Yeah. I do.
He dashes off, a barrage of Spanish and English curses behind
him, and crosses to his sister, waiting for him DOWN THE
STREET. He takes the violin from her and carries it himself.
Roberta pours nervous energy into her cappuccino, adding
cinnamon, chocolate, and sugar, stirring loudly. Dan sits
across from her, observing.
ROBERTA
I just don't see how I'm gonna do
this. It's huge. It's gigantic! It's
Carnegie Hall! And listen to this:
now Isaac Stern wants to play with
us -- Diane Monroe, Michael Tree --
there's other people calling --
DAN
That's fantastic!
ROBERTA
Fantastic? I'll never get the kids
up to speed in time, I'll never get
myself up to speed. I'm gonna be
playing side by side with the world's
greatest violinists.
DAN
And "the world's greatest violinists"
are playing side by side with you
because they want to help you win
this fight.
He offers her a forkful of some decadent-looking chocolate
cake, but she shakes her head.
ROBERTA
Yes, but... you don't understand.
Maybe there's a good reason why I
never made it as a violinist -- maybe
I just can't cut it. I keep blaming
it on not having enough early
training, but if I were talented, if
I had a gift --
DAN
But you do have a gift. You're gonna
put thirty East Harlem kids on stage
at Carnegie Hall not because they're
prodigies, but because you got them
to stick with something that's hard
as hell and to strive for excellence --
which, by the way, I certainly wasn't
striving for when I was their age.
Not to mention the other ten years'
worth of students whose lives were
changed because of you. That's your
talent, Roberta.
She takes this in, looks at him gratefully and puts her hand
over his. He strokes her hand.
ROBERTA
I'm scared.
DAN
I know.
(beat)
And by the way, I happen to think
you're a pretty good violinist too.
ROBERTA
You've barely heard me play.
DAN
I've heard enough to know you're
gonna do just fine.
Roberta looks at him with trepidation. Dan takes another
forkful of his cake.
DAN
Besides, no one's gonna be paying
attention to your playing anyway.
Roberta laughs. Dan smiles, glad he got her to lighten up.
The Fiddlefest kids (including Ramon, Shandra, Vanessa, De
Sean, Naeem, Guadalupe, Lucy, Simon, Stephanie, Amanda and
Kenny -- but RACHEL is absent) stand outside the locked school
gate, waiting for Roberta. Some of the kids have their violins
out of the cases, tuning them.
CARLOS
Teacher's late. I think she should
be dropped, don't you?
Kids laugh.
RAMON
Yeah. I don't think we should let
her play in Fiddlefest!
A few kids start playing "CAN-CAN." It catches on, and more
of them join in. PASSERSBY stop to listen, and some drop
change into the open cases. RAMON and a couple of other kids
grin at this.
CARLOS steps in front of the kids as he plays, and begins an
uncanny imitation of Roberta:
CARLOS
More bow! To the frog! You sound
terrible! I can't believe how terrible
you sound!
The kids crack up, but a few spot ROBERTA heading quickly up
the street. Carlos is oblivious to this -- and no one signals
him that Roberta's watching.
CARLOS
You're gonna make everyone in Carnegie
Hall sick to their stomachs! That's
right, they're gonna pay a thousand
dollars a ticket and you're gonna
make them throw up on their gowns
and tuxedos!
Carlos senses a presence and turns to see Roberta. A tense
beat as he awaits her reaction.
ROBERTA
(in all seriousness)
If you're gonna imitate me, do it
right.
(corrects his posture)
Shoulders back. Violin higher. Check
your feet. There.
(beat)
G'head, Carlos. Continue.
Carlos freezes.
CARLOS
No, that's O.K. You can take it from
here.
Roberta nods, and addresses the kids as she unlocks the gate.
ROBERTA
He's right, by the way. You do sound
terrible, and you are gonna make
everyone in Carnegie Hall sick to
their stomachs.
The kids start filing in. Rachel comes up the street and
catches up to Roberta.
RACHEL
I need to talk to you.
Roberta sees how distressed Rachel looks.
ROBERTA
(to kids)
I'll be right in. Start on Minuet
One.
(to Rachel)
What's wrong?
RACHEL
We're moving away.
ROBERTA
What? Where are you moving?
RACHEL
(looking downward)
It's a secret... My father... he's
been hurting my mom... We have to
leave.
ROBERTA
(gently)
Has he been hurting you too?
Rachel shakes her head no, then starts to cry a little.
RACHEL
I'm sorry about Julliard... and the
concert.
She hands Roberta her violin.
ROBERTA
Keep it. Take it with you.
RACHEL
No... I don't want to play anymore.
ROBERTA
What?! You can't give up violin,
Rachel -- it's a part of you. A very
important part.
Rachel looks anguished. Roberta moves closer and touches her
arm.
ROBERTA
Please honey. Just take it.
RACHEL
I don't want to.
Roberta looks at her, pained, then hugs her. Rachel quickly
kisses Roberta goodbye and exits. Roberta watches her.
Roberta, Assunta and the boys step outside, amazed to see a
STRETCH LIMOUSINE double-parked in front, a CHAUFFEUR waiting.
LEXI
See? I told you they'd send a car.
Roberta's open-mouthed. She leads her entourage towards the
limo. THE NEIGHBORS come out of their houses to watch. Some
lean out windows, gawking. Ad libs... "Who's that?" "It's
the Violin Lady!" LAWRENCE, dressed in a tux, gives Lexi a
high sign.
The chauffeur helps Roberta and Assunta into the limo while
Nick and Lexi start to load the instruments into the trunk.
