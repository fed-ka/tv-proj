      INT.  BIG FIVE SPORTING GOODS - MORNING IN TUCSON

      RON SNUFFKIN (30, scruffy, does he cut his own hair?) stands 
      behind the customer service desk, TALKING ON THE PHONE.

      A long line has formed in front of him.  DISGRUNTLED 
      CUSTOMERS clutch a variety of sporting goods.  Ron s not in 
      too much of a hurry to meet their needs. 

      The CUSTOMER in front holds an armload of SLEEPING BAGS. 

                                  RON
                          (into phone)
                    Look Tony, they must have been 
                    damaged during shipping.  All of my 
                    items are in mint condition when 
                    they leave my collection. (Beat)  
                    Okay, well I m out of the serving 
                    trays with the floral inlay, but 
                    how about I send you a gravy boat 
                    from the Truman White House?  
                    (Beat) What about porcelain dolls?  
                    (Beat) Fine, are you into 
                      fireworks? 

      The customer in front reaches the end of his rope.

                                  CUSTOMER
                    This is ridiculous!

      Ron covers the phone receiver.

                    I would like to speak to your 
                    manager.  Now.

      Ron and the customer lock eyes for a moment.                                                                                        2.

                    What s up?  Trouble in the woods?  

      OVER TO THE STORE S FRONT ENTRANCE:

      GARY GUNDERSON (14) enters the store ahead of brothers ROBBY 
      GUNDERSON (8) and BRANDON GUNDERSON (16).

      Gary, their articulate leader, blazes a trail through 
      browsing CUSTOMERS as the impish Robby races to catch up.  
      Brandon wanders in slowly, captivated by the overabundance of 
      sporting goods.

      They gather near the service counter and stare at Ron.  

                                  GARY
                            (whispering)

                    people, Robby.  We can t search 
                    forever.  Let s just spread out, 
                    watch him for a bit.  You ll see.

      The boys move apart, trying to monitor Ron surreptitiously:

      Robby tests PUNCHING BAGS, Gary checks out TENNIS RACKETS, 
      and Brandon tries to put on a SWIM CAP.  They all keep an eye 
      on Ron.

                    Just wanted to let you know: Gary, 
                    I called the school, gave my 
                      permission for you to stay late for 
                    debate team.

                                  GARY
                    Really?  Thanks.

                                  RON
                    Grabbed this for Brandon.

      He hands Brandon A HANDFUL OF THE TOY SOLDIERS.

                                    BRANDON
                          (wide-eyed)
                    Awesome.  Are you sure?  

                                  RON
                    It s just one regiment.

      Ron tosses something to Robby.

                                  RON
                    And I bought Robby here a T-shirt.

      Robby unfolds it, revealing a PINK UNICORN on the front.

                                  ROBBY
                    Jerk.

      Brandon walks over to Ron.

                                    BRANDON
                    Thanks.

      He gives Ron a CLUMSY, UNCOMFORTABLE HUG through the window.  
      Ron drops away quickly:

                                  RON
                    Yeah, well...goodnight, boys.


      INT. TOOL SHED - MOMENTS LATER

      Ron enters the shed.  He has transformed it into an 
         apartment : half-bachelor pad, half-warehouse jammed with 
      antique collectibles, porcelain dolls, sporting goods, etc.  
      He picks up  The Art of War  by Sun Tzu, turns on some 
      CLASSIC ROCK.                                                                                    36.


      Before he can sit down and relax, A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

      Ron opens it, revealing the NASAL NEIGHBOR from the day 
      before.  She glares at him.

                                  RON
                    Hello neighbor.  My boys take care 
                    of your window?

                                  NEIGHBOR
                    If you think for a second that I am 
                    going to let three boys with 
                    childhood arthritis perform manual 
                    labor, you re sorely mistaken.

                                  RON
                    What?

                                  NEIGHBOR
                    They told me everything, Mr. 
                    Johnson.  About your drinking, your 
                      gambling--

                                  RON
                    Who told you all that?  The middle 
                    one?  He has a vivid imagination.

                                  NEIGHBOR
                    My window still needs fixing, so 
                    I ll expect you tomorrow morning.   

      Beat.  Ron grits his teeth, decides not to fight this one.

                                  RON
                    Sounds good.  See you then.

                                  NEIGHBOR
                    And Mr. Johnson...I ll be watching 
                    you.

      As she leaves, we see Gary on the back porch, arms crossed, 
      holding back a laugh.

                                  GARY
                    Have fun with that!

      Ron shakes his head, retreats into his shed, and SLAMS THE 
      DOOR.
