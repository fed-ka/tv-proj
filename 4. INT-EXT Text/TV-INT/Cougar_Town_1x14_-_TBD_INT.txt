                    No, no, no!  I can t afford another

                    on a pillow wrong, and I had a line 
                    on my cheek for two weeks.

                    I m off to my tennis lesson.  But 
                    when I get back, clear your schedule 
                    for  Ellie Day .  Where team Ellie

                    days, and you wait in line while I 
                    shop.  After that, we ll expose Stan 
                    to the kid next door so he can get 
                      chickenpox out of the way.  And then 
                    if there s time, we ll take my duvet 
                    to dry cleaners.

  Ellie s phone rings and a picture of CHRISTIAN pops up.

  Jules scrolls through pictures, then sees a saucy one.  She 
  erects her fingers like nipples hardening.

                    Why wouldn t I be?  The Jules thing?  
                      I appreciate the concern, but I m a

                              GRAYSON
                    I think it was official before.

                              BOBBY
                    But now it s officially legal.

                    tennis boy.  But I bet you want some

                    Dibs on a boy is easy to settle.  So,

                      (then, off looks)
                    Hmm, that s gonna make this tricky.

                    Oh... so you re not mad?  Fabulous.

                              JULES
                    Andy, did you know that Ellie flirts

                              ELLIE
                    Jules is trying to steal him from me.

                    Because when Ellie comes home from 
                    tennis lessons she s very... excited. 
                    Do you know what I get to do?  I

                              JULES
                    Exactly.  And, I m sorry for being a 
                    B-word before.  Tennis is supposed to 
                    be fun, so can we both agree to just 
                    have a good time tomorrow?

                    When you put it that way, I suppose 
                    this sort of is my bad. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Ellie is sipping wine when Jules bursts in.  Ellie, icily:   

                              ELLIE
                    Oh, hello there.  

                              JULES
                    So, you strand me at the tennis court 
                    but you re going to play it all, 
                     Ellie been done wrong.   Well say 
                    hello to,  Jules been done right.   
                    Not  done  as in  sex  done, 
                    Christian just gave me a ride home.  
                    He actually doesn t have a car, so we 
                    rode the bus.  But he held my hand 
                    the whole way, so there.

                              ELLIE
                    I don t think I m talking to you yet.  

                              JULES
                    Come on, Ellie, we both know if you 
                    weren t married Christian would ve 
                    asked you out a long time ago.  
                    You re hot.  Plus, you ve got, like, 
                    perfect calves.  From the knees down 
                    you re like a Caucasian Eva Mendes.

                              ELLIE
                    I know that.  But I m still mad.  

                              JULES
                    If it makes you feel better I won t 
                    go out with Christian.

                              ELLIE
                    Don t you get it?  This isn t about 
                      Christian.  This is about us, but the 
                    fact that you don t see it is exactly 
                    what s wrong with our friendship.  

  Ellie stands up to go, but Jules blocks her.

                              JULES
                    Oh, no, no, no.  You can t drop a 
                    bomb like that and then just run off.  

  Ellie BOLTS out of the room.  Jules hauls gluteus after her.  

                                                                              CUT TO:  Cougar Town            "TBD"  [114]                   23.

  Travis and Laurie replace Dale s stuff.  The place is full 
  of punching bags, ninja weapons and posters of bikini girls.

                                TRAVIS
                    This is the first time I ve ever 
                    broken into a place to return stuff.  
                      (then, noticing)
                    Dale has a lot of hurting equipment.

                                LAURIE
                    Yeah, he has the third biggest 
                    nunchuck collection in Gulfhaven.   

                                TRAVIS
                    And here I am wasting my money on 
                    hair product and skinny jeans. 

                                LAURIE
                      (hearing something)
                    Crap, Dale s here.  We have to hide!

                                TRAVIS
                    Can t you just talk to him?

                                LAURIE
                    I can, but you ll get nunchucked.  

  Laurie and Travis dive into the nearest closet. 


  Laurie and Travis whisper as WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS outside. 

                                TRAVIS
                    So, how long do we have to wait here?  

                                LAURIE
                    Don t worry, we re fine unless he 
                    starts punching a speed bag.
                      (hearing speed bagging)
                    I hope you don t have anywhere to be.  

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Travis whispers on his phone.  INTERCUT with Jules:

                                TRAVIS
                    Mom, did Kylie call? 

                              JULES
                    What?  No, I don t think so.  

                                TRAVIS
                    Why are you out of breath?

                              JULES
                    I m chasing Mrs. Torres through the 
                      neighborhood.  Where are you?

                                TRAVIS
                    I m hiding in someone s closet.

  Just then, Jules sees Ellie sneaking back toward her house.  

                              JULES
                    Sounds fun, gotta go.

                                                                              CUT TO:  Cougar Town            "TBD"  [114]                   26.

  Still dripping wet, Jules and Ellie sit in the kitchen.  

                              ELLIE
                    I can t believe you pushed me into a 
                    pool.  This top is dry-clean only.  

                              JULES
                    I was there when you bought it.  

                              ELLIE
                    Not this top.  You were  too busy  so 
                    nobody was around to tell me that my 
                    birthmark peeks out when I raise my 
                    arms.

                              JULES
                      (as Ellie demonstrates)
                    Yeah, you shouldn t do that. 

                              ELLIE
                    Jules, you haven t been around for a 
                    lot of stuff lately.  Ever since you 
                    got divorced, everything has been all 
                    about you.  

                              JULES
                    Ellie, I m sorry.  But you don t 
                      understand what it s like to be a 
                    woman my age back out in the world--

                              ELLIE
                    Oh my God, enough!  No one wants to 
                    hear about how you re forty and 
                    single anymore!  Can I kiss a guy in 
                    public?  Can I have my twenties in my 
                    forties?  We re tired of it!

                              JULES
                    Totally tired?

                              ELLIE
                    Fine, not totally.  It s fun to live 
                    through you when you re trying to 
                    figure out, say, which sex position 
                    is the best for not getting pregnant.

                              ELLIE
                    My point is, lately I feel like I m 
                    just a participant in your life.  You 
                    use to always be there for everybody.  
                    But yesterday I asked you to do an 
                     Ellie Day  with me, and you blew it 
                    off.  Old Jules wouldn t have done 
                    that.  New Jules only wanted to hang 
                    out when she found out a guy was 
                    involved.  I get that it s hard to be 
                    where you re at in your life right 
                    now, but I have to be honest, its 
                    turned you a little--

                              JULES
                    Don t say the  J  word.  I hate it.

                              ELLIE
                    It s turned you a little selfish. 
                      (then)
                    There, I ve said my peace.  You can t 
                    say I ran away and didn t finish. 

  Ellie exits, squishing in her shoes, leaving Jules alone.   

                                                                              CUT TO:

                    This isn t even the first time I ve 
                    had to hide in Dale s closet.  One 
                    time it was to catch Dale cheating, 
                    another time it was because Dale came 
                    home when I was cheating.  I m in 
                    here so much, I stashed granola bars.

                    No thanks.  Mostly because your 
                    hiding place is a hunting boot.

                                TRAVIS
                    I should clarify -- being in here is 
                      terrifying, but you could have just 
                    sold Dale s stuff, or thrown it away.   

                                LAURIE
                    I usually burn it.

                                TRAVIS
                    Also an option.  But you brought it 
                    back.  That s close to making a good 
                    decision.  You re making progress.
