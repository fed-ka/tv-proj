      Scott quietly slips down the side of the balcony to the 
      ground. From above, Allison gives a quick wave. He responds 
      with a smile, but it s half-hearted at best. 

      On the sidewalk, he pulls his mother s car keys from his 
      jacket. But then pauses, ears twitching up. He turns back.

      SOMETHING MOVES in the shadows under the trees.

                                  SCOTT
                    Derek?

      He hears it again. A quick movement. Leaves rustling.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Okay, I know I said I would stay 
                    away, but you broke my phone and I 
                    had to at least tell her I wasn t 
                    going to be answering...            TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/119.

      He trails off as no response comes. Scott holds very still.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Derek?

      In the blackness, Scott s eyes focus on a vague shape. A 
      vague but very large shape. It blinks with GLOWING RED EYES.

      Scott steps back. Then turns. Then runs for his life.

      Behind him come the SOUNDS of something huge and powerful 
      right on his heels. He runs, breath gasping out of him as he 
      races for his mother s car. 


      Scott jumps into the car and slams the door shut. He pounds 
      his palm down on the lock and jams the keys into the 
      ignition. But before turning it, he stops to look up.

      IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR - Those glowing EYES approach.

      The dark shape of the Alpha moves slowly and deliberately 
      around the car while Scott sits there, hand still on the 
      ignition.

                                  SCOTT
                          (barely a whisper)
                    What do you want?

      The creature comes toward the driver s side window, its 
      breath STEAMING the glass before Scott can get a look at it.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    What do you want from me?

      Something presses against the steamed window causing Scott to 
      flinch back. It s a clawed fingertip. It begins to move, 
      drawing something in the moisture.

      Scott watches, staring through the window as the hand pulls 
      back into the darkness. A moment later the Alpha is gone, 
      having left a simple yet mysterious sign in the condensation.

      Drawn into the steamed glass is a perfect SPIRAL...

      Stiles and Scott walk out to the field with their lacrosse 
      equipment. At the benches, Stiles pulls out a black strap 
      with a digital display at its center.

                    tied to learning to control your

                    Shut up and put the strap on.

      MOMENTS LATER - Scott stands with his hands behind his back 
      as Stiles duct tapes his wrists together.

                                  SCOTT
                    This is not exactly how I planned 
                    to spend my free period.

      Stiles picks up a lacrosse stick and glances down at his 
      phone to look at the heart monitor.

                                  STILES
                    Ready?

                    Remember. Don t get angry.

      Stiles drops a handful of lacrosse balls at his feet and 
      picks up his lacrosse stick.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m starting to think this is a 
                    really bad--

      A LACROSSE BALL soars right into Scott s leg.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Ow.

      With a slight smile, Stiles picks up another ball and tosses 
      it. This one NAILS Scott in the shoulder.          TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/1119.

                    Quiet. You should be thinking about 
                    your heart rate. About staying 
                    calm.

      Stiles holds up his phone to show Scott s rising heart rate.

                                  SCOTT
                    Okay, stay calm. Staying calm. 
                    Staying totally calm...

      A lacrosse ball WHACKS him in the KNEE.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Son of a bitch.

      Scott staggers, nearly falling. As he attempts to right 
      himself--

      SOMEONE APPROACHES the field from a distance... Jackson. He 
      steps underneath the bleachers, remaining hidden while 
      watching them with a suspicious but interested eye.

      Stiles twirls the lacrosse stick in his hands.

                                  STILES
                    I think my aim is improving.

                    I m not getting angry--

      Another ball flies, whacking Scott right in the stomach. He 
      gasps for breath, doubling over. Then another shot nails him 
      in the thigh. 

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    All right, hold on. Just stop.

      But the next ball hits him right in the neck. Scott stumbles. 
      With his hands taped behind him, he falls to his knees.

      Stiles moves to pick up another ball with the lacrosse stick, 
      but he pauses at the SOUND of gravelly RUMBLING coming 
      towards him. A GROWL.

      THEN A BEEPING SOUND catches his attention. It s the HEART 
      RATE MONITOR on his phone. Stiles picks it up to see the 
      numbers climbing at an alarming speed.

                    Scott?

      He looks from his phone to see Scott kneeling on the grass. 
      Both of his hands digging into the dirt, strands of torn duct 
      tape around his wrists. He ripped the duct tape apart.

                    Stay back.

      AT THE BLEACHERS - Jackson watches, clearly unsure of what 
      he s seeing.

      And then Scott looks up, sweat dripping down his forehead.

      parking lot where several large dumpsters sit concealing a  
      FEW SENIORS. They hang out there laughing and talking while 
      smoking.

      One SENIOR climbs out of a smoke filled truck to join the 
      others.

                                  STILES
                          (to Scott)
                    Over here.

                                  SCOTT
                    What are we doing?

                                  STILES
                    You ll see. Stand right here. Do 
                    you have your keys?

      Scott takes out his house keys.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Hold them up. Like this. Now, 
                    whatever happens I want you to 
                    think about Allison. Find her voice 
                    like you did at the game? Got it?

      Scott nods.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Good. Keep holding the keys.

      Stiles walks over to the Senior s truck and takes out his own 
      car keys. Then in a quick few seconds, Stiles drags his key 
      across the side of the Senior s truck, digging a HIDEOUS 
      SCRATCH into the paint.

      As Scott watches in horror, Stiles pockets his keys and turns 
      to him.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                          (to Scott)
                    Dude. What do you think you re 
                    doing to that truck?

      The Seniors turn around to see Scott holding his car keys up.          TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/1131.

                                  SENIOR
                    What the hell?

      Scott steps back as Stiles gives him a devilish smile. The 
      Seniors are on him in a nanosecond. Scott puts up his arms 
      trying to protect himself. But they literally start beating 
      the ever-loving crap out of him.

      Stiles eyes his phone to note the rising heart rate while 
      Scott crumbles to the pavement under the merciless pummeling. 

      But then OUR POV begins moving fast--

        Backtracking from the parking lot, tearing into the halls of 
      the school, whipping through classrooms. We hear VOICES, bits 
      of conversations, laughter, people talking on phones. And 
      then...

                                    ALLISON (V.O.)
                    Hey Mom, it s me. Just calling to 
                    let you know I ll be home late 
                    tonight. Studying with a friend. 
                    Yes, that friend. We re lab 
                      partners...

      Until another voice interrupts--

                                  MR. HARRIS
                    Stop! Stop right now! What do you 
                    idiots think you re doing?

      BACK AT THE DUMPSTERS - Mr. Harris breaks up the fight. Scott 
      lies on the ground, blood dripping from his nose. He slowly 
      turns to Stiles who holds his phone up. 

      THE SCREEN shows a steady and normal heartbeat. 

      It worked...


      Derek quickly heads to his Camaro in the parking lot of the 
      hospital. Unlocking it, he reaches for the door when he 
      notices A PIECE OF PAPER slipped under the windshield wiper.

      He pulls it out, slowly unfolding it, then reading with 
      interest. He looks up, turning back to the hospital as if 
      trying to find someone watching him. 

      Then crumpling the paper in his hand, he moves quickly, 
      faster than ever.

      A second later, his car ROARS out of the lot and into the 
      street.


      Pedaling as fast as he can, Scott hurtles down the road on 
      his bike.

                                  SCOTT
                          (under his breath)
                    Had to break my phone...          TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/1136.



      Stiles s Jeep ROARS into the lot. He and Scott get out.

                                  STILES
                    This is a terrible idea.

                                  SCOTT
                    I know.

                                  STILES
                    And we re still going to do it.

                                  SCOTT
                    Can you think of something better?

                                  STILES
                      Personally, I m a big fan of 
                    ignoring a problem and hoping it 
                    goes away.

                                  SCOTT
                    Just make sure we can get inside.

      Stiles yanks out a set of BOLT CUTTERS.

      A pair of headlights approach as Derek s Camaro parks in a 
      nearby space. Derek kills the engine and steps out from 
      behind the wheel. Scott and Stiles approach him.         TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/1139A.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Where s my boss?

      Scott and Stiles peek inside the Camaro to see Deaton BOUND, 
      GAGGED and BLINDFOLDED.

                                  STILES
                    He looks comfortable.

      Scott and Stiles start for the school building.

                                  DEREK
                    Where are you going?

                                  SCOTT
                    You said I m linked with the Alpha. 
                    I m going to see if you re right. 


      Derek stands in front of his car, eyes still on Deaton 
      through the windshield. He doesn t move a muscle, poised like 
      a cobra ready to strike. That is until he hears--

      A PATHETIC HOWL ringing over the PA SYSTEM. Derek slowly 
      turns around in shock. 

                                  DEREK
                    You got to be kidding me...


      The howl echoes across the buildings, bellowing out from the 
      speakers, over the trees and into the night sky.

      Derek turns back, now actually impressed. But clearly not 
      happy. 


      Waiting outside her house, Allison clicks on her phone to 
      check the time: 8:35. 

      The faint cry of Scott s howl soars to her in the wind. She 
      glances up at the odd sound.


      Scott and Stiles bang through the doors of the school and out 
      into the parking lot.

                                  DEREK
                    I m going to kill the two of you 
                    myself. Are you trying to attract 
                    the entire state to this school?

                                  SCOTT
                    I didn t know it would be that 
                    loud.

                                  STILES
                    It was loud. And it was awesome.

      But Scott is no longer paying attention to either of them. 
      Instead he s looking at Derek s Camaro. The door is open. 
      Ripped bindings lying on the pavement.

      Derek steps forward, surprised.          TEEN WOLF EP#106 "EPISODE 106"PINK DRAFT 2/27/1143.

                                  SCOTT
                    What did you do with him?

                                  DEREK
                    I didn t do anything...

      Derek jerks forward. Blood SPURTS from his mouth as he rises 
      up into the air, held aloft by something dark and large 
      behind him.

      SCREAMING, Stiles and Scott stagger back.

      Derek s body goes flying, SLAMMING into the brick wall of the 
      school and dropping down.

      Tripping over their own feet, Scott and Stiles run for it, 
      racing for the school.
