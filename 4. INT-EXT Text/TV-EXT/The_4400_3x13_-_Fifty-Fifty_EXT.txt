33*OMITTED


      Tom and Diana have pulled Shawn aside for a private
      conversation.  Shawn looks out at the landscape, giving them
      his back as Tom makes an impassioned plea.

                                  TOM
                    You do realize that, don't you? 
                    Handing out promicin like candy
                    will change everything.  Nobody
                    will be able to enforce the law. 
                    It'll be chaos.

                                  DIANA
                    Nobody can predict what's going to
                    happen once people everywhere start
                      developing abilities.  Not you. 
                    Not Jordan Collier.  And it's hard
                    for me to see how that's going to
                    lead to a better world.

                                  TOM
                    So Shawn... you need to tell us
                    where he's keeping this stuff. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)THE 4400     "Fifty-Fifty"      (SHOOTING SCRIPT)       07/11/06          8.

      Beat.  Shawn still has his back to them, so we have no idea
      if their entreaty is making an impression.  But when he turns
      to face them, his face is grim with determination --

                                  SHAWN
                    I really don't get you guys
                      sometimes.  All along, you've said
                    we're on the same side.  Whatever
                    our differences, we have the same
                    goals.  For things to change.  Get
                    better.
                          (and then)
                    Now a man is back from the dead to
                    show us how to get there... and you
                    two are trying to stop him?  Well,
                    guess what -- you can't.  Our phone
                    lines have been tied up all morning. 
                    People are dying to know how they
                    can get their hands on the shots. 

                                  TOM
                    So what do you tell them?

                                  SHAWN
                    I tell them we've got nothing to do
                    with this.  And I wish them good
                    luck.

      And Shawn's gone, heading back toward the Center.  Tom watches
      him go, dismayed to see his nephew once again so deeply in
      Collier's sway.  He turns to Diana --

                                  TOM
                    If he's the voice of moderation...
                    we're in a lot of trouble.

      Tom moves to walk off down the path.  But Diana calls after
      him --

                                  DIANA
                    Tom.  I need a minute.  There's
                    something I have to do.


      An NTAC Tactical Team, led by Tom and Diana, advances onto
      the porch.  At Tom's signal, one of the team hits the front
      door with a portable battering ram.  As it flies open --


      BOOM!  Ryland, who's standing at the fore of a caravan of
      parked vehicles, is blasted off his feet as an explosion
      rocks the hangar.  As the flames consume everything inside --

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                            ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      Moments later.  Ryland staggers to his feet, taking in the
      smoldering hangar.  A moment as he just looks at the smoke
      billowing out --

      -- And then Isabelle emerges.  Her clothes are seared, her
      body covered in soot, but she's otherwise unscathed.  She
      walks up to Ryland.

                                  RYLAND
                    What happened in there?  Where's
                    Collier?

                                  ISABELLE
                    Somewhere else.
                          (and then)
                    It was all fake.  No Collier.  No
                    promicin.

                                  RYLAND
                    ... My men?

                                  ISABELLE
                    They're all dead.  He wanted us to
                    find this place.  He had it wired
                    with explosives.
                          (and then)
                    He thought he could kill me.  He
                    was wrong.

      Isabelle, determination in her eyes, walks past Ryland,
      bumping him on the shoulder as she passes.  Ryland calls
      after her --

                                  RYLAND
                    Where are you going?
                          (no response)
                    Where the hell is the promicin?


      CLOSE ON: the graffiti portrait of Jordan Collier, last seen
      in Ep.  30, "The Gospel According to Collier."  We HEAR --

                                  JORDAN COLLIER (O.S.)
                    Each of you gets one bag.

      And we TILT DOWN to REVEAL: Collier, standing directly beneath
      his portrait.

                                                                (CONTINUED)THE 4400     "Fifty-Fifty"      (SHOOTING SCRIPT)       07/11/06          36.

      He's surrounded by two dozen or so HOMELESS MEN.  They're
      led by WILL [NOTE: this is the homeless man last seen throwing
      NTAC off Collier's scent in Episode 30].

      Collier is holding a canvas knapsack, the flap of which is
      open.  The bag is filled with syringes loaded with promicin,
      carefully packed with protective padding.

                                  JORDAN COLLIER (CONT'D)
                    You'll also get an envelope.  It
                    has money for travel, and the name
                    of your destination.
                          (and then)
                    Go.  These shots are free.  Give
                    the shots to anyone who wants them. 
                    But make sure you explain the risks.

      And as we realize that Collier is using the network of
      homeless acolytes he built up while wandering the country to
      distribute the promicin, Will steps forward, addressing this
      army of the disenfranchised --

                                  WILL
                    Okay.  Come on up.  One bag for
                    each man.

      The men begin to step forward, one by one.  Will passes each
      of them a bag, as Collier wraps up his address --

                                  JORDAN COLLIER
                    Thank you all.  No matter what your
                    lives have been up to now, you're
                    about to make an impact on the world
                    that will never be forgotten.  Good
                    luck.

      Collier looks on proudly as the bags are distributed, his
      plan for global change very close to coming to fruition.


      Isabelle's still walking away from the little caravan of
      parked military vehicles, the same expression of grim purpose
      on her face.  Ryland follows her --

                                  RYLAND
                    Isabelle.  Where are you going?
                          (no response; and
                            then)
                    Stop.  We need to find Collier.

      She keeps walking as she responds to Ryland --

                                  ISABELLE
                    That's what I'm going to do.  I'm
                    going to draw him out.  Make him
                    come to me.

                                  RYLAND
                    How do you plan on doing that?

                                  ISABELLE
                    I'm going to the Center.  He cares
                    about that place.  I'm going to
                    bring it down.  And everyone in it
                    if I have to.

                                  RYLAND
                    No.  You work for the United States
                      government.  You can't walk in there
                    and start killing people in broad
                    daylight.

                                  ISABELLE
                    But it's all right if we kill them
                    covertly.

      Ryland's had enough.  He raises his voice, trying to bring
      his charge in line --

                                  RYLAND
                    Stop.  This is not open for
                      discussion.  I am ordering you to
                    stop.

      And she does.  For a moment, Ryland thinks the disagreement
      is over.  But then she slowly turns to look at him --

                                  ISABELLE
                    It's funny.  There's something about
                    men in suits.  They always think
                    they can tell me what to do.

      She just keeps looking at Ryland.  And after a moment, Ryland
      begins to fidget in discomfort, as though he's experiencing
      what he believes to be a temporary hot flash.

                                  RYLAND
                    -- My skin.  It's so hot --

      Ryland raises a hand INTO FRAME -- and is staggered to see
      that his hand is emitting SMOKE.  [NOTE: we intend this to
      be a practical rather than an optical effect.]

      Ryland's expression curdles further as the pain worsens. 
      Isabelle looks at him with that disturbing clinical expression
      as he drops to his knees.

                                                                (CONTINUED)THE 4400     "Fifty-Fifty"      (SHOOTING SCRIPT)       07/11/06          38.

      Ryland cries out in pain.  Isabelle would clearly stand here
      until he was dead -- except that she hears the sound of SIRENS
      APPROACHING in the distance.

      Isabelle turns her back on Ryland, walking away from him at
      a quick clip.  Off Ryland, the WHISPS OF SMOKE beginning to
      dissipate off his body --

                                                                          TIME CUT TO:

4040THE HANGAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      Tom and Diana's car pulls up to the scene.  They rush out,
      passing a couple N.D. MEN IN FIREMEN'S UNIFORMS as they
      approach --

      Ryland, who sits on the bumper of a POLICE SEDAN.  He doesn't
      even look up as they approach, deeply shaken by his brush
      with Isabelle.

                                  TOM
                    What the hell happened here?

                                  RYLAND
                    ... She would have done it.  She
                    was going to kill me.

                                  DIANA
                    Where's Isabelle?

      Ryland doesn't respond to the question.  He's still lost in
      his own train of thought --

                                  RYLAND
                    She's too powerful.  I can't control
                    her.  No one can.

                                  TOM
                    Dennis.

      Ryland finally looks up at them, his gaze drawn by Tom's
      sharp tone.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Tell us where she went.

      Beat.  Then Ryland responds --

                                  RYLAND
                    The 4400 Center.

      Diana's car, heavily packed with travel bags, is parked on
      the curb outside Tom's house.  It's a bright, sunny day. *
      Alana's leaning in to the passenger window.  Maia sits in*
      the back seat; Ben's behind the wheel.  Alana smiles at Maia --*

                                  ALANA
                    Be sure to send me emails, okay? 
                    And take lots of pictures.

                                  BEN
                    Don't worry.  I guarantee you
                    there'll be plenty of pictures.

                    No, we won't.  We'll be back.  But*

      And as Alana reacts to that...*

      THE SIDEWALK NEARBY*

      Tom and Diana stand a few feet away, taking a private moment. 
      An awkward beat as they fumble for an appropriate goodbye.

                                  DIANA
                    So.  Do you hate me?

                    up.  But I can't leave.  I'm in it
                    'til the end.
                          (beat; and then)
                    Lucky me, huh?

      Diana smiles -- and then HUGS Tom.  He returns it.  For a
      moment, they hold onto each other, a silent acknowledgment
      of all they've been through.  When they part, Diana's misty.

                                  DIANA
                    'Bye, Tom.

      He gives her a wave as she heads to the car and gets in the*
      passenger seat.  As Diana pulls the door shut, Alana moves
      to Tom, who puts an arm around her.

      The song "LONELY PLANET BOY" by the New York Dolls RISES
      softly in the b.g. as Diana's car pulls away.  And as the
      car recedes, we HEAR Jordan Collier's voice.*

      We're not yet sure where he is, or whom he's speaking to,
      but his thoughts tie together the season's final images.

                                  JORDAN COLLIER (V.O.)
                    The end of one journey is always
                    the beginning of another.


      We're looking on from a distance as a couple of NTAC
      OFFICIALS, led by Jarvis, put a heavy padlock on a chain
      that is wrapped around the front doors of the Center.

                    Change is always painful, and it
                    always comes with a cost.

      REVERSE to REVEAL: Richard, wearing a hat and sitting behind
      the wheel of a car, looking on as the Center is shut down. 
      A moment, then he puts his car in gear and drives away.


      Alana's walking down the front path, towards her car.  She*
      fumbles with her keys, then looks up, noticing something.*

                                  JORDAN COLLIER (V.O.)*
                    Tomorrow is always a mystery.  The*
                    only thing we can do is face it*
                    with resolve.*

      And, from above, a familiar WHITE LIGHT blooms on Alana's*
      face.  As it grows brighter, her expression shifts from*
      confusion to dread.  And as it BLOTS HER OUT entirely --*


      CLOSE ON: a journal.  Someone is writing in it, and we realize
      that we're looking at the words we're hearing spoken.

                                                                (CONTINUED)THE 4400     "Fifty-Fifty"      (SHOOTING SCRIPT)       07/11/06          49.

                    We make a choice.  We act on that
                    choice.

      Another angle REVEALS: Collier, sitting on the steps of this
      remote outpost.  He finishes his journal entry...

                                  JORDAN COLLIER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    And then all that's left... is to
                    live in hope.

      Collier shuts the journal.  He takes a moment to look out
      over the landscape.  And then we HEAR the door open behind
      him.  He turns.  Kevin and Tess are standing there.

                                  KEVIN
                    I got the TV working.  They're saying
                    a woman in El Paso just checked her
                    father out of a hospice.

                                  TESS
                    He had Alzheimer's.  Until she
                    visited him this morning.

                                  KEVIN
                    Come on.  They're talking about us. 
                    Let's go watch it happen.

      Kevin and Tess turn and head inside.  Collier SMILES.  The
      news is a moment of relief and triumph for him.  And as he
      stands and follows them in, the music FADES DOWN.


      A line of people is gathered under the portrait of Collier. 
      Some look like burnouts; others are comfortable middle class.*

      Will stands facing them.  He's placing a promicin shot into
      a brown paper bag.  As he does it, he talks to the woman in
      the front of the line, whose back is to us.

                                  WILL
                    You understand what you're about to
                    do, right?  There are no guarantees.

      REVERSE to REVEAL: The woman he's talking to is none other
      than April.  She nods as she takes the bag from Will --

                                  APRIL
                    There never are.

      April moves off.  Will reaches for another syringe, then
      looks up.  He's speaking to the next person in line, but
      CAMERA is positioned right in front of him.

      It's as though he's speaking directly to us.

                                  WILL
                    How about you?  Fifty-fifty.  You
                    want the shot?

                                                                SMASH CUT TO BLACK.
