Walter walks across the campus.
Walter pulls into the driveway of his house. He gets out,
grabs his belongings out of the back seat and walks inside.
Two cars are parked in Walter's driveway.
Walter sits at a table and eats lunch alone.

Walter walks across the parking lot and gets into his car.
Walter's car drives down the F.D.R Highway.
Walter pulls into a parking garage. He gets out and takes a
ticket from the attendant. He grabs his bag and briefcase
from the back seat.
He walks down the street, taking in the sights and sounds of
the city.
Walter walks out of a liquor store with a SMALL BROWN BAG.
Walter arrives at a classic tenement building. He looks up at
the building as if inspecting it.
He takes out his keys. He opens the door and walks in.
Tarek has set his bags down in front of a closed store. He is
talking in a very agitated tone on his cell phone. Zainab
stands by silently.

TAREK
(In Arabic)
Look I know. Come on man, it'll
just be for a night or two until we
figure something out. OK.
ZAINAB
Tarek?
TAREK
(In Arabic)
Can you check and call me back?
OK. Thanks.
ZAINAB
Tarek?
TAREK
What!?
Zainab points. Walter is standing there holding the framed
photograph.
WALTER
You left this at the apartment.
Tarek walks over and takes it.
TAREK
Thanks.
Walter nods.
WALTER
Do you know where you're going to
stay tonight?
TAREK
Yeah.
The lie is obvious. They are stuck. Walter just nods again.
Jacob walks outside with Sprinkles.
The Kimmel Center towers over Washington Square Park.
Walter buys a newspaper.
Walter is sitting in the park and eating some Indian food
from a local cart vendor. He finishes and drops it into the
garbage can. He checks his watch and starts to head back
toward the conference when a SOUND catches his attention.
Walter watches two young AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN drumming on
BUCKETS with reckless abandon.
MALE VOICE (O.S.)
We should have them come play
inside.
Walter turns. THREE COLLEAGUES from the conference are
standing next to him.
COLLEAGUE #1
Coming in?
25
WALTER
Yes. In a minute.
(Holding up his cell
phone)
I have to make a call.
COLLEAGUE #1
See you inside.
Walter nods as the guys walk off. Walter watches them go. He
turns and watches the drumming again.
Walter and Zainab are standing outside on the empty street.
There's an awkward silence.
WALTER
He's very good.
ZAINAB
Yes.
WALTER
The whole band is very good.
ZAINAB
Yes.
And then nothing. Finally Tarek emerges.
TAREK
Sorry guys. Let's go.
They walk down the street.
Walter is sitting in the park and eating PIZZA. This time he
is sitting directly across from the two African American
drummers.
Zainab is closing up her booth. Another VENDOR walks by and
says good bye. Zainab smiles and nods good bye.
Zainab is walking home with her supplies. Two NEW YORK POLICE
OFFICERS are talking to THREE YOUNG HISPANIC KIDS. Zainab
hesitates for the slightest moment before lowering her head
and walking past.
Walter is walks out of the building talking to a FEMALE
COLLEAGUE.
TAREK (O.S.)
Hey, Walter!
Walter and the Female Colleague turn. Tarek is standing a few
feet away holding both drums.
Walter nods and says good bye to the Colleague who looks a
bit confused. Walter walks over to Tarek.
TAREK (CONT'D)
How did the presentation go?
WALTER
Fine. Thanks.
TAREK
Cool. Guess what? I found an
apartment in Brooklyn. We can move
in on Monday.
WALTER
That's good.
TAREK
Yeah. It's small but it's a nice
building. I just hope Zainab likes
it.
WALTER
I think she will as long as no else
lives there.
Tarek laughs.
TAREK
I think you're right. Come on,
let's go. You should take off the
name tag.
WALTER
Oh. Yeah. Thanks.
37
Walter takes off his name tag and they start to walk.
WALTER (CONT'D)
Are you hungry?
TAREK
Yeah. I'm starving. Do you like
shwarmas?
WALTER
Uh...yeah. I like sharmas.
TAREK
Shwarmas.
WALTER
Yeah.
They walk across the park.
NEW YORK STREET FAIR - LATER
Zainab is talking to two UPPER EAST SIDE WOMEN who have
stopped at her stall.
39
ZAINAB
Yes. I made it.
UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
How much?
ZAINAB
Thirty-five dollars.
UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
Will you take thirty?
ZAINAB
No. thiry-five.
UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
OK. I know my daughter will think
it's "cool". Here.
She hands her the money. Zainab takes it and drops it into a
small pouch.
UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN (CONT'D)
Where are you from?
ZAINAB
Senegal.
UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
Oh. I was in Cape Town two winters
ago. It was just beautiful.
ZAINAB
(Handing her the bag)
Thank you very much.
UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
Thank you.
The Woman walks away. A young Israeli man, ZEV is sitting at
a nearby stall selling T-shirts.
ZEV
How far is Senegal from Cape Town?
ZAINAB
Far.
ZEV
I told a guy I was from Israel
yesterday and he asked if I had
ever visited the Holy Land.
40
Zainab smiles. Zev sees someone over Zainab's shoulder.
ZEV (CONT'D)
Hey, look who it is. What's up
Tarek?
Tarek and Walter are approaching.
TAREK
Zev!
How are you?
ZEV
Good man.
TAREK
Hey honey.
He kisses Zainab.
ZAINAB
Hello. Hi, Walter.
WALTER
Hi.
TAREK
How's business?
ZEV
Ahh. You know.
Walter looks at the Zainab's jewelry.
TAREK
Her stuff is great, right? She made
me this?
Tarek holds up his wrist, revealing a bracelet.
TAREK (CONT'D)
You should make one for Walter.
Zainab nods noncommittally.
TAREK (CONT'D)
So Walter and I are going up to the
park to play for a little bit. OK?
ZAINAB
Tarek, I told you we have to pick
up my new table today. He said he
would only hold it for today.
41
TAREK
I know. I know. No problem.
ZAINAB
Tarek. You always say "no problem"
and then you are late or you
forget.
Tarek smiles.
TAREK
I know. I will not be long. We'll
go up and play and then we'll come
back to help you. I promise,
habibti.
He kisses her and starts to walk away.
ZAINAB
Yes. It's always "habibti" when you
want your way. It closes at five
p.m. Not Arab time, Tarek.
TAREK
No. Not Arab time. Real time,
habibti.
ZAINAB
Don't "habibti" me.
They turn and start to leave.
WALTER
What does habibti mean?
TAREK
Habibti? It means "beloved one".
WALTER
Does she know that?
Tarek laughs.
Walter and Tarek stand in front of the DRUM CIRCLE
in
Central Park.
TAREK
What do you think?
Walter sizes it up and makes his assessment.
WALTER
I think I'll just watch.
TAREK
Come on, Walter.
TAREK (CONT'D)
It's easy. You just wait until you
feel it. Let's go.
Tarek joins the drum circle. Walter lingers.
Walter is on the edge of the Drum Circle, waiting to "feel
it". Tarek is next to him playing away.
Tarek looks at Walter and nods. Finally Walter starts to
play. Slowly at first, but then he starts to really commit.
Tarek encourages him with a smile.
43
Tarek and Walter are leaving the park. Tarek checks his
watch.
TAREK
Shit, we have to get home. Zainab
is gonna kill me. I'm on Arab time
again.
WALTER
What is Arab time?
TAREK
It means I'm late by an hour. All
Arabs are late by an hour. It's
genetic. We can't help it.
72ND STREET SUBWAY STATION - LATER
Tarek and Walter hurry down the stairs of the subway station.
Walter walks out of the police station. He crosses the
street. Zainab is standing there.
ZAINAB
Well?
48
WALTER
They've moved him.
ZAINAB
To where?
WALTER
To a detention center in Queens. He
was turned over to immigration.
They said we can see him during
visiting hours tomorrow night from
five to ten.
Zainab shakes her head.
ZAINAB
I can't visit him or I will end up
in that place too.
Zainab fights to restrain her emotions. She turns and walks
away. Walter watches her go.
Zainab's bedroom light is on.
A sea of skyscrapers near One Center Street.
Walter emerges from the subway into a very industrial
neighborhood. Factories and fences. He checks his piece of
paper and starts walking.
52
Walter is still walking. The area is very deserted. He stops
and tries to locate a street address amongst the anonymous
factories. He checks his sheet of paper and continues
walking.
Walter is standing in front of the DETENTION CENTER. It looks
like most of the other factories around it but perhaps with a
bit more barbed wire.
He presses a button and the automated door slowly opens. He
walks inside.
Zainab walks away from the apartment.
57
Jacob walks Sprinkles in front of the apartment building.
Walter walks outside and waves hello as he walks past.
Walter buys the morning paper from a kiosk. He walks to the
corner and waits to cross the street. A large group of
CHINESE TOURISTS led by a TOUR GUIDE step up next to him. He
is surrounded by them.
Walter and Mouna exit the subway station and walk down the
empty street.
WALTER
Have you been to New York before,
Mrs. Khalil?
MOUNA
No. Tarek wanted to come to New
York to play music. I did not want
him to go but...do you have
children, Mr. Vale?
WALTER
I have a son. He lives in London.
MOUNA
And your wife?
WALTER
My wife passed away.
MOUNA
I'm sorry.
64
Walter and Mouna stop across the street from the detention
Center.
WALTER
That's it.
MOUNA
This is where the prison is?
WALTER
Yes. That's it.
Walter points to the Detention Center.
MOUNA
It does not look like a prison.
WALTER
I think that's the point.
MOUNA
How many people are in there?
WALTER
Tarek said about three hundred.
WALTER (CONT'D)
There is a coffee shop on that
corner. It's not very nice but...
MOUNA
I'll wait there. Here.
She takes a letter out of her bag and hands it to Walter.
MOUNA (CONT'D)
Thank you.
Walter turns and walks into the facility. Mouna lingers,
taking in the building.
Walter and Mouna arrive back at Walter's apartment building.
Jacob emerges from the front door with Sprinkles.
JACOB
Oh. Hello, Mr. Vale.
WALTER
Hello, Jacob.
He sees Mouna.
JACOB
Oh, hello again. Did you find your
son?
MOUNA
Yes. Thank you.
JACOB
(To Walter)
I let her in earlier.
(To Mouna)
I'm Jacob, by the way. I live on
the third floor. And this is
Sprinkles.
MOUNA
Nice to meet you, Jacob. I'm Mouna.
JACOB
So you two know each other?
There is an awkward pause.
MOUNA
Yes. Mr. Vale knows my son.
JACOB
Oh. Who is that?
MOUNA
Tarek.
69
JACOB
Oh. Tarek. He is very nice. And so
is his girlfriend. They are both so
polite.
MOUNA
Thank you.
JACOB
My mother and I are planning a trip
to go to Israel next summer. She's
always wanted to go.
MOUNA
I hope you enjoy it. Now if you'll
excuse me.
Mouna nods and heads into the building.
JACOB
Oh sure. We need to go on our walk
and do our business. Very nice to
meet you, Mouna.
MOUNA
You too, Jacob.
Mouna continues up the stairs. Walter follows her.
JACOB
Goodbye, Mr. Vale.
WALTER
Goodbye.
Mouna walks down the stairs.
WALTER
Mrs. Khalil?
She turns. Walter is standing at the top of the stairway.
WALTER (CONT'D)
Please. I was with Tarek when he
was arrested. He was in the subway
in the first place because of me.
Please. Stay. Even if it's just for
the night.
Walter's plea is heartfelt. Mouna looks at him and then she
looks down the stairs for a long moment, considering her
options.
Desolate streets. The sound of an airplane taking off breaks
the night quiet.
A large office building in downtown Manhattan.
Walter and Mouna are standing at the fair.
MOUNA
Which one is she?
WALTER
There. In the middle.
MOUNA
(surprised)
The black woman? That is Zainab?
WALTER
Yes.
MOUNA
She is very black.
Zainab is sitting at her table when Walter approaches. Zainab
smiles. She is genuinely surprised and happy to see him.
ZAINAB
Walter?
WALTER
Hi Zainab. This is Mouna Khalil.
Tarek's mother.
Zainab blanches.
ZAINAB
Oh.
She quickly stands up.
MOUNA
Hello, Zainab.
77
ZAINAB
It is a pleasure to meet you, Mrs.
Khalil.
MOUNA
Please. Call me Mouna.
ZAINAB
OK. I'm sorry. I did not know you
were coming.
MOUNA
Neither did I.
Mouna looks at her for a long moment. Then she inspects her
jewelry. Zainab is uncharacteristically nervous.
MOUNA (CONT'D)
Your jewelry is very beautiful.
ZAINAB
Thank you.
MOUNA
Do you have time for coffee or a
walk?
Zainab looks around at her table.
ZAINAB
Yes. I would like that. But I have
to watch my table.
Mouna and Zainab both turn to look at Walter.
Walter is sitting behind Zainab's table in the fair. It's a
long way from the classroom. A FEW YOUNG WOMEN walk past and
browse Zainab's jewelry. They look at Walter who just nods.
Walter and Mouna walk down the street listening to Zainab who
is wheeling her jewelry supplies behind her.
Walter, Mouna and Zainab are standing at the railing of the
Ferry which is making its way across the harbor.
The STATUE OF LIBERTY looms large; the ferry route providing
a perfect vantage point.
MOUNA
So what is in Staten Island?
ZAINAB
I don't know. We never got off. We
just would go to the other side and
then come back.
WALTER
Why?
80
ZAINAB
It's free. And it felt like we were
going somewhere.
Mouna smiles.
ZAINAB (CONT'D)
That is where the towers were. I
never saw them but Tarek did.
Zainab crosses to the other railing and points.
ZAINAB (CONT'D)
And over there is the Statue.
And
behind that is Ellis Island.
Zainab smiles.
ZAINAB (CONT'D)
Sometimes Tarek would point at the
statue and jump up and down like we
were arriving to New York for the
first time. It was very funny.
MOUNA
Can you go up in the Statue?
WALTER
Yes. I think so.
MOUNA
You haven't been?
WALTER
No.
MOUNA
Oh.
Walter's cell phone rings. He looks at it.
WALTER
Excuse me.
(Into the phone)
Hello? Oh. Hi Charles.
He walks away from the Mouna and Zainab.
WALTER (CONT'D)
What's that? Yes. I'm still in New
York actually. I stayed down here
to do some research. What's that?
Oh. I'm on a boat. Yes, a boat.
(MORE)
81
WALTER (CONT'D)
Listen Charles, I'll explain when I
see you but I have to go right now.
I'll call you back. Goodbye.
Walter hangs up the phone and rejoins Mouna and Zainab.
Walter and Mouna are walking home.
WALTER
Are you hungry, Mouna? We can stop
for dinner.
MOUNA
I would prefer to cook if you don't
mind?
WALTER
OK.
MOUNA
Should we stop at a market?
WALTER
Yeah. That's probably a good idea.
83
An empty New York street. Mouna and Walter round the corner
walking together. She is holding his briefcase. Walter is
carrying the drum and his duffle bag.
They arrive at the Parking Garage. Walter hands a ticket to
the GARAGE ATTENDANT. He takes his briefcase from Mouna.
86
WALTER
Thank you. You have my number if
you need anything.
MOUNA
I'll be fine. Thank you. Have a
safe trip.
WALTER
Well good bye.
MOUNA
Goodbye.
Mouna turns and walks down the street. Walter's car arrives.
Walter pulls into his driveway. He gets out of the car. He
opens the trunk and takes out his bag and then his drum.
Walter is stopped at a traffic light in town.
Walter walks onto the front lawn and looks around the sleepy
neighborhood. He listens to the quiet. It's a stark contrast
from New York.
Three MOVERS are carefully removing the piano from Walter's
house as Walter and Barbara Watson look on.
Walter, Mouna and Zainab are sitting at a cafe. Walter is on
his cell phone.
91
WALTER
(Into the phone)
OK. OK. Please do. Thank you. Bye.
He hangs up.
MOUNA
What did he say?
WALTER
He would make some calls but they
can move him to another facility at
their discretion.
ZAINAB
What facility? Where?
WALTER
He said it could be anywhere.
Upstate. Pennsylvania. There is
even one in Louisiana.
ZAINAB
Louisiana? Where they had the
floods?
WALTER
Yes.
MOUNA
That's so far.
WALTER
Yeah.
MOUNA
Did the lawyer say anything else?
WALTER
No. No he didn't know anything
else.
MOUNA
No one seems to know anything. It
feels like Syria.
Walter buys two newspapers. One in English and one in Arabic.
Mouna walks along the street. She stops at a small CLOTHING
STORE and looks into the window. She walks into the store.
Walter pays the Cab Driver and turns to Mouna.
WALTER
Ready?
MOUNA
For what?
Walter points to the "Phantom of the Opera" marquee behind
her.
MOUNA (CONT'D)
Really? The Phantom? Are we seeing
it?
WALTER
Yes.
MOUNA
Now?
WALTER
Yes. Is that OK?
MOUNA
That's wonderful. Thank you. I am
so excited.
Walter smiles as he and Mouna walk toward the theatre.
The lights and sounds of Times Square. Walter and Mouna walk
through the throngs of tourists after the play. Walter hails
a cab and they jump in.
Walter and Mouna get out of the cab. Walter rushes in. Mouna
waits outside.
Walter watches as Mouna tells Zainab. Zainab buckles and hugs
Mouna.
102
Walter walks quickly along the street with his drum.
Walter approaches the subway and enters.
Zainab sits behind her table, staring straight ahead. We hold
on her for a long moment and then...
