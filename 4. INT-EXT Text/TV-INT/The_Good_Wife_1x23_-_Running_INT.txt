                    No hello?

                                  KALINDA
                    Hello.

      Kalinda opens a freight elevator door.  


      Lana and Kalinda crowd into the elevator stuffed with plastic-
      wrapped office furniture.  Just room enough for a cozy two.   

                                  LANA
                    This is all just an elaborate plan 
                    to get me alone, isn t it?

                                  KALINDA
                    You found me out.

      Lana smiles as they start up.  Lana reaches toward Kalinda s 
      forehead, moves a hair off it.

                                  LANA
                    Do you ever let your hair down?

                                  KALINDA
                    No.  

                                  LANA
                    Even in the shower?

                                  KALINDA
                    No.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #122    "Running"   YELLOW COLLATED    4/27/10      2.

      Lana smiles when-- ding-- they get off into... 


      ...ananonymous hallway, turning the corner toward reception, 
      a SECURITY GUARD blocking their way:

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    We re redoing the floors.

                    It s her.

    The guard nods, lets them through.  The floor empty, except 
    for two people.  Will and Diane.  In the large conference 
      room.  Not even assistants.  Kalinda leads Lana in, as...

      ...a tan suburban VAN pulls up to the loading dock, ALICIA 
      waiting there now.  The van doors open.  JACK ARKIN (32) gets 
      out.  A cop.  Intelligent.  Think Harvard Grad who joined the 
      Academy.  Baseball cap down.  Trying to hide his face. 

      Alicia motions him inside as his wife gets out the passenger 
      door.  TRISHARKIN (28).  Pretty.  Open-faced.  Optimistic.  
    One year off a Wisconsin farm.  She smiles at Alicia. 

                                  ALICIA
                    How are you?

                                  TRISH
                    Trying to be open-minded.

      Alicia nods: understands.  Motions her inside too. 


    And we re making the same path Kalinda and Lana took.    

                                  ALICIA
                    You re supposed to turn off your

      ...thesame freight elevator.  Alicia, Jack, Trish.

                                  TRISH
                    I can t believe we re doing this.

                                  JACK
                    We could still turn back.

      Alicia watches this exchange between husband/wife.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    I love you.

      Trishleans forward, kisses him, as-- ding.

                    We re redoing the floors.

    The guard again, but he sees Alicia, Trish, Jack.  He nods.  


      Silence.  Trishand Jack sit on one side of the conference 
      table.  Lana on the other.  Will, Diane, Alicia observe.   
      Kalinda standing.

                    Okay, I ll go first.  Due to agency-
                    wide budget cuts, the FBI has to be 
                    very selective with Federal Witness

                    Okay, maybe this was a mistake.

                    Internal Affairs is looking into

                                  WILL
                    Because the State s Attorney wants

                      embarrassment?

      Lana looks toward Alicia.  So do Will, Diane, Kalinda.

                    I ll step out.

                    your case.  

      Lana turns to Kalinda.  Interesting.  Kalinda never protects 
      anyone, and yet she jumped on that.

                                  LANA
                    If you don t mind, Mrs. Florrick.  
                    I think it s better to avoid any 
                    appearance of a conflict.

      Will nods to Alicia...

      Giada watches her go, eyes her.  That was interesting.  As

    The kids laugh-- there it is again  Pete.   Alicia shoots 
      them a friendly hush look as Raymond leans toward Peter, 
      whispers in his ear.  The two chuckle.  And Ray starts off.

                    landing, then someone flipped him 
                    over onto his back. 

      Will and Diane trade a look.

                                  DIANE
                    It was staged.  

                                  WILL
                    We ll need ballistics.

                                  DIANE
                    I m on it.

      Will shoots a quick look toward Diane who rolls her eyes.

                                  WILL
                    Okay, so our story is this.  The 
                    task force discovered Jack was 
                    going to testify, killed Gorman, 
                    then used Gorman s gun to kill 
                    Jack.  

                                  DIANE
                    Let s finish this off in 
                    depositions.  Cook County won t 
                    want this in the press.   


      Alicia accompanies Kalinda down the stairs...

                                  ALICIA
                    You seem hot on this.

                    I m friends with a lot of cops.  
                    The bad ones hurt the good ones.

                          (stares at her)
                    It s a job.  And a job I ll do 
                    well.

    And that s it, Kalinda starts off.  Alicia nods,  starts 
      toward her office, sees Eli sitting on her couch.  Oh, happy 
      days.  She starts to slump, quickly puts on a smile.


                                  ELI GOLD
                    Notice I m here as an invited guest 
                    now-- being a client of your firm.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.  Welcome.

                    Do you mind if I m blunt, Mrs. 
                    Florrick?

                    Always a pleasure.  

                                  ELI GOLD
                    I brought my business here.  I 
                    didn t have to.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Do you mind if I mblunt, Mr. Gold?
                          (Eli smiles, nods)
                    You brought your business here 
                    because we re a good firm.  And 
                    let s agree right now: there s a 
                    statute of limitations on playing 
                    that card. 

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Fair enough.  This is Mimi Collins. 
                      24-year-old art student at Whitley.  
                          (photos)
                    Two years ago she was raped and 
                    brutally beaten by her ex-
                    boyfriend, a Michael Placedo.

                                  ALICIA
                    If this is a criminal matter, Mr. 
                    Gold, you should take it upstairs.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    No, it s more like an allegory.  
                    Mr. Placedo was sent to prison for 
                    20 years by the State s Attorney at 
                    the time: your husband.

    Ah, Alicia starts to get it, nods.

                                  ELI GOLD (CONT D)
                    Mimi Collins went back to Art 
                    School, a happy and healthy young 
                    co-ed in fear of nothing.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Somehow I think this is going to 
                    end badly.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Glenn Childs, in a general review 
                    of your husband s cases, argued 
                    that Mr. Placedo be released with 
                    time served.  And...
                          (one last photo)
                    That is Mimi Collins s body. 
                    Discovered two weeks ago in a Chicago 
                    landfill.  

      Alicia is moved by the photo, but hates that Eli is using it.

                                  ALICIA
                    It sounds like your first campaign 
                    ad.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Yes, and it would be-- if it 
                    weren t for the fact that Peter has 
                    decided to wait four years to run.  

      Alicia looks up, surprised:

                                  ALICIA
                    Really?

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Yes, he said, while at dinner with 
                    you and the kids, he worried about 
                    the  seductive allure of power.   

                                  ALICIA
                    Mr. Gold.  Who does the  seductive 
                    allure of power  sound like?

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Yes, I know, the good pastor 
                    Isaiah.  I want you to talk to him.  
                          (Alicia smiles)
                    He thinks he s helping you restore 
                    your marriage.  Tell him you don t 
                    need it.

      Alicia smiles.  She s up, escorting him to the door:

                                  ALICIA
                    Always good to see you, Mr. Gold.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Peter can t win without you. 

      There it is.  Alicia and Eli pause over that. 

                                  ELI GOLD (CONT D)
                    You know it s true.  Peter only wins 
                    if he gets your Good Housekeeping 
                    seal of approval.  Voters need to 
                    see you together.  On that stage 
                    holding hands.  

      Alicia collects the photos, hands them back to Eli.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Good-bye, Mr. Gold.


      ...BOOOOOOM!---The second shot rings loud as KURT MCVEIGH, 
      stands at the top of a barn s wooden stairwell, firing a gun 
      held on a C-stand at a ballistics dummy at the bottom of the 
      stairs, sand bags behind it.  Diane beside McVeigh.

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Mr. Gorman got off three rapid 
                    shots at the task force lead man, 
                    Mr. Arkin.  All hit their target, 
                    center, two high, one low.

                                  DIANE 
                    This matches the crime scene?

                                  MCVEIGH
                    No.  My stairwell is two steps 
                    taller.  I ve adjusted by lowering 
                    the C-stand.  

      McVeigh positions another ballistic dummy at the top of the 
      stairs, then starts down, Diane beside him...

                                  MCVEIGH (CONT D)
                    Mr. Arkin had his gun out, but was 
                    surprised by the assault.  He fell 
                    as he was firing, here on the 
                    landing as another member of the 
                    task force, Mr. Hunter, rushed in, 
                    and fired three shots from here... 

      Another gun on C-stand below the landing.  He positions it. 

                                  MCVEIGH (CONT D)
                    This will be inexact here.  
                    Covering up.

      McVeigh aims up the stairwell, and BOOOOOM-BOOOM-BOOM-three 
      shots in quick secession.  Hit the ballistic dummy.  

                                  MCVEIGH (CONT D)
                    You alright?

                                  DIANE
                    Yes.  What s it say about me that I 
                    find this exhilarating?

                                  MCVEIGH
                          (smiles)
                    You re human.  The first shot hit 
                    Mr. Gorman in the arm.  Second shot 
                    went past him, hit the bathroom 
                    door.  Third shot hit Mr. Gorman in 
                    the jaw, to his right.  The whole 
                    trade of fire took approximately 
                    eight seconds.

                                  DIANE
                    And are we saying the task force 
                    then planted a drop gun on Mr. 
                    Gorman?  Or was it his?

      McVeigh looks at her awkwardly.  

                                  MCVEIGH
                    It was his.

    But Diane pauses, looks at him, reads his manner.

                                  DIANE (CONT D)

                                  MCVEIGH
                    I think Mr. Arkin was in a 
                    dangerous line of work, and took 
                    his life into his hands every time 
                    he executed a search warrant.   

                                  DIANE

                    You don t think Mr. Arkin was 
                    flipped over on his back?

                                  MCVEIGH
                    My guess is that, in the extremity 
                    of the moment, one of Mr. Arkin s 
                    partners turned him on his back to 
                    check his vitals; and failed to 
                    report this during the 
                      investigation.

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Because you approached me first.  
                    And, given our connection, it would 
                    be a conflict of interest.

      Diane takes a second, considers it.

                                  DIANE
                    I think you should do what you 
                    want, Kurt.  I think you should 
                    testify for the State s Attorney s 
                    office.  I wouldn t hesitate to 
                    argue against you.

                                  MCVEIGH
                    I think it would... complicate 
                    matters.

                    Matters are complicated already.  
                    There are only so many employers, 
                    and it s a bad economy, so I think 
                    you should never hesitate to take a 
                    job.  I won t.  

                                  MCVEIGH 
                          (studies her)

                    I am a big girl.

      McVeigh smiles.  Loves her at that moment.  A phone rings in 
    his lab.  Starting out:

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Let me think about it.    

                                  DIANE
                    Good.  I ll just get my coat.

      McVeigh nods, exits, and Diane immediately takes out her 
      cellphone, snaps dozens of pictures of the stairwell, the 
      dummies, the markings on the wall.


      A beautiful restaurant overlooking the nighttime city.

                    Okay, so here we are.  Dinner.  

      Across from him sits not Alicia, but Giada...

                                  GIADA
                    And I m treating.

                                  WILL

                                  WILL
                    Yes, and a very talented lawyer.

                                  GIADA
                    I m sure.  I felt like I was 
                    intruding.

                                  WILL
                    You felt like you were intruding?  
                    I don t understand that.

                                  GIADA
                    I felt like I was being checked out 
                    by someone who had skin in the 
                    game.

      Will looks up at her, smiles.

                                  WILL
                    Do you ever blink?  Even at night 
                    at home when people aren t looking?

    She smiles as a Spanish WAITER comes up, talks fluently and 
      happily in Spanish with Giada.  She talks fluently back.  As 
      Will watches, sees he s being referred to.  Sits back, folds 
    his arms, waits for it to end.  It does; the waiter leaves.

                                  GIADA
                    He likes you.

                                  WILL
                    I m so glad.

                                  GIADA
                    Do you want me to translate?

                                  WILL
                    No.  Understood every word.

      Giada laughs.  Will looks up, notices other patrons holding 
    up glasses, nodding to Giada.  Giada nods slightly back.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    So do you come here a lot?

      Will smiles at that.  Raises a hand for the waiter.

                    There s no pressure in this.  It s

    She stands, crosses toward the door.THE GOOD WIFE #122    "Running"   YELLOW COLLATED    4/27/10      27.

                    Last year?  I don t know.  My guess

      Jackie stares at Eli.  As different as two people could be.

    Eli almost laughs, keeps it straight.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    No, I m sorry, I wish I were.  
                    Pastor Isaiah talked to him.

      Jackie pauses, studies Eli... 

                                  JACKIE
                    Who introduced him to this Pastor?

                                  ELI GOLD
                    I did, but not with that intention.

                                  JACKIE
                    Mr. Gold, there is one thing you 
                    need to know about my son.  He is 
                    easily moved.  You need to pre-
                    screen the people who see him. 

    Eli Gold: surprisingly good advice.  He nods.

                                  JACKIE (CONT D)
                    And I will talk to this man.  Plan on 
                    announcing by the end of the week.  

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Thank you.

                                  JACKIE
                    Are you good, Mr. Gold?

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Am I good?  I m the best, ma am.

                                  JACKIE
                    I will need you to be. 

    Eli nods, turns, starts out, smiling to himself.  Sees old 
      ladies staring at him as they pass.  He nods:

      Diane smiles across at Cary.

                                  DIANE
                    That seems more like a reason you
                    shouldn t hire him than I shouldn t 
                    question him.

      back, feeling like a peer.  Cary, Diane, the outside council, 
      a court reporter, and McVeigh. 

                                  DIANE
                    Mr. McVeigh, on Tuesday last, did you 
                    conduct an experiment duplicating the 
                    April 16th officer shooting?

                                  MCVEIGH
                    I did.

                                  DIANE
                    And this experiment was conducted 
                    at your farm?

                                  MCVEIGH
                    It was.

                                  DIANE
                    In your barn?

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Yes.

                                  DIANE
                    And this experiment led to your 
                    conclusion that the police 
                      investigation was accurate?

                                  MCVEIGH
                    That s correct.

                                  DIANE
                    Are you familiar with the FBI 
                    standards for ballistic investigation?

      McVeigh looks across at her: where is this is going?

                                  MCVEIGH
                    I am.

                    Was this investigation in your barn 
                    in accordance with those standards?

      McVeigh takes a second.  Shifts in his chair.  The one area 
    in his whole life that makes him uncomfortable being 
      questioned.  His expertise.

                                  MCVEIGH
                    In most respects.

                                  DIANE
                    So in some respects it wasn t?

                                  MCVEIGH
                    That would follow.

                                  DIANE
                    So that would be a yes?

      McVeigh looks straight at Diane.  Eyes glued to her.

                                  MCVEIGH
                    You are correct.

      Cary makes a note.  Not happy with this.

                                  DIANE
                    The assailant s firearm was lowered 
                    through the use of a C-stand?

                                  MCVEIGH
                    Yes.

                                  DIANE
                    And the FBI standards caution that 
                    a C-stand is not a steady base for 
                    a firearm? 

                                  MCVEIGH
                    I believe that s correct.

                                  DIANE
                    You believe?

                    Do you need a minute, Mr. McVeigh?


    The deposition-- now seen from outside the conference room. 
    It comes to a conclusion.  McVeigh starts out-- we can t read 
    his face.  But we can read Cary s, as he follows.  It did not 
    go well.  

      Diane stays in the room, seated, taking her time, 
      contemplative.  The Court Reporter folds up her steno 
      machine, puts it away.  Diane stands, exits the room, crosses 
    to her office.  Will sees her...

    And that s it.  Diane enters her office, closes her door, 
      sits.  Stares at her desk.

      Kalinda reaches past her to open the garage door, but Lana 
      stops it halfway up.

                                  LANA
                    According to Mr. Arkin, there were 
                    three other corrupt cops.  We 
                      immediately put them under 
                      surveillance.  

      Lana takes out a surveillance photo.  Places it in front of  
      Kalinda.  It s of her and Burton at the hotel bar.

                    five of us in that room for that 
                    proffer.  And one of us leaked.

      card.  Will opens the card as he talks on his phone...

                                  WILL
                    Good job, Kalinda.  Anything you can 
                    find to tie it to the task force 
                    would help.  You alright?  You sound 
                    like you ve been running.  Okay.

      Will hangs up, shoots a look across the hall toward the 
      conference room where Alicia is deposing Hunter.  Will opens 
    the card, reads:  How s your masculinity now?   He smiles.

                                  DIANE
                    You got a secret admirer now?

      Diane at his door.  Will distracted, opening the box:

                                  WILL
                    It appears so.

      Will finds a bottle of wine inside.  Blinks.  

                                  DIANE
                    Something special?

                    You just said the opposite.

                                  HUNTER
                    No, I did not, ma am.

                                  ALICIA
                    Then I don t understand--

                    Well, I can t help you with that--

                    photos.  How did Mr. Arkin s saliva 
                    end up on the landing two feet from 
                    his head?

                    Why don t we take a break--

                                  ALICIA
                    No, we re fine.

      Cary looks toward Hunter, worried.  Hunter looking more shifty.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Do you have an answer, Mr. Hunter?  
                    You say you didn t touch the body?  
                    So how did he end up on his back?

                                  HUNTER
                    I want to confer with counsel.

                                  ALICIA
                    If that helps you with the truth, sure.

      Hunter stares angrily at Alicia, then leans toward Cary, 
      conferring in whispers.  Alicia looks out toward Will s 
      office, sees him talking with Diane over a bottle of wine.  

                                  CARY
                    Mr. Hunter would like to... adjust

                                  HUNTER
                    Jack was shot and fell face 
                    forward.  I then, after firing upon 
                    and killing Mr. Gorman, proceeded 
                    to turn Jack over on his back 
                    because he was wearing a wire. 
                    Trying to nail us. 

      Alicia stares at him.  Oh shit.

                                  ALICIA
                    And what happened to this wire?

                                  HUNTER
                    We gave it to Internal Affairs.

      Alicia looks toward Cary who smiles.

                    This wire will be supplied to you

                    And guess what, lady?  That wire-- 
                    the wire that was supposed to catch

      Cary leans in toward Alicia, smiles...

                    You know what I would do if I were

      A recording playing on a computer.  Listening are Will, 
      Diane, Kalinda, ten associates, all crowded in Will s office.  
    The sound of five loud gunshots.  A man s yell.  Then a 
      rustled microphone, a falling body.  More yells.  Gunfire.    

                                  WILL
                    They re saying this supports their

                    Hate to say it, but I think it does.

      Alicia notices the bottle of wine and gift box behind Will.  

                                  KALINDA
                    It doesn t matter if it supports it.

                    What do you mean?  

                                  KALINDA
                    Look at the incident report.  Gorman 
                    was lying in wait, gun in hand.   
                          (nodsto the recording)
                    And within seconds of Arkin coming 
                    through the door, Gorman was firing.

                                  ALICIA
                    You think he was set up?

                                  KALINDA
                    The task force knew Arkin was the 
                    first one through the door.  They 
                    didn t need to kill Arkin.  They 
                    just needed Gorman to do it.  

      Will studies Kalinda, nods.  

                                  WILL
                    Okay, wrongful death is wrongful 
                    death. So let s look at Gorman.  
                    Did someone contact him?  Check 
                    phone records.  Any acquaintance in

                    is? 

                                  KALINDA
                    Or why he was urgently phoning a 
                    meth dealer an hour before he 
                    killed a cop.

                                  ALICIA
                    Well, it doesn t look like an 
                    addict s house.

                    I don t think there isa look to an 
                    addict s house.  So what were you 
                    doing with Will?

                                  ALICIA
                          (smiles)
                    Having dinner.

      Kalinda starts to say more, but a woman enters the foyer.  
      HEATHER (29).  

                                  HEATHER
                    Thank you for waiting.  Mr. Lydell 
                    is right this way.


      HANK LYDELL.  An 85-year-old in a wheelchair.  Staring at a TV.

                                  HEATHER
                    That s very unlikely.  Hank has 
                    some good days, but his arthritis 
                    keeps him from dialing the phone.

                                  ALICIA
                    And you ve never heard him talk 
                    about a man named Gorman?

                                  HEATHER
                    No.

                                  KALINDA
                    Who else would have access to the 
                    phone?

                                  HEATHER
                    Here?  Well, any of us.

                                  KALINDA
                     Us? 

                                  HEATHER
                    Nursing care.  Hank has 24 hour 
                    nursing care.  I have the graveyard 
                    shift.

                                  ALICIA
                    Is there any way to tell who was 
                    the nurse here on the night of this 
                    killing?  May 15th.

      Heather nods, flips through a clipboard by the refrigerator.  
      Runs her finger down the list.

                                  HEATHER
                    That was Trish. TrishArkin.

      Kalinda and Alicia trade a stunned look.

                                  HEATHER (CONT D)
                    Did I say something wrong?

                                  KALINDA
                    No.  That s just the wife of the 
                    deceased.

                                        ACT FOUR


      Will closes the door of Diane s office.  A private meeting.  
      Just Kalinda, Alicia, Will, Diane.  


                                  WILL
                    So... our client did it?

                                  ALICIA
                    She apparently warned the meth dealer 
                    her husband was coming to arrest him.

                                  DIANE
                    How did she even know him?

      Alicia looks to Kalinda to answer, but she s distracted, 
      bothered.  A feeling she isn t familiar with: guilt.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Apparently through her husband.  He 
                    was selling confiscated meth back to 
                    the dealer.

                                  WILL
                    And the rest of the task force?

                                  KALINDA
                    Innocent.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Well, we don t know that for sure, but 
                    it does look like it was just Arkin 
                    who was stashing weapons and drugs.  
                    He realized Internal Affairs was 
                    looking into him, so he thought he d 
                    make a deal and turn on his partners.

                                  DIANE
                    And Trish...?

                                  ALICIA
                    There were 40 calls between Trish
                    and Gorman.  His neighbors say they 
                    frequently saw her car there.  We 
                    think they were having an affair 
                    and Trishtried to save Gorman from 
                    the bust.     




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #122    "Running"   YELLOW COLLATED    4/27/10      50.

                    So she wasn t mourning Jack?  She 
                    was mourning Gorman.

                                  WILL
                    Well, that explains the leak.  When 
                    we counted who was in the room, we 
                    didn t count the wife.

                                  KALINDA
                    Yep.  

      They all look toward Kalinda.  

                                  DIANE
                    And you want to hear an even 
                    greater irony?  Cook County wants 
                    to avoid embarrassment.  We just 
                    got an offer to drop the case.  

                                  WILL
                    How much?

                                  DIANE
                    A half million.

      Will just shakes his head, chuckles.

                                  WILL
                    So Trishgets her husband killed, 
                    blames the police, and makes a cool 
                    $500,000.

      Kalinda gets up, leaves the room. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Are we taking it?  

                                  WILL
                    Well, I don t think we can get them 
                    any higher.

                                  ALICIA
                    No, I mean, are we taking anything?  
                    She s guilty, and she ll get off.

      Diane and Will trade a look.  A novice s hesitation.  

                                  WILL
                    She s our client.  It s our job.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #122    "Running"   YELLOW COLLATED    4/27/10      51.

                                  ALICIA
                    And at what point is our job... wrong?  

                                  WILL
                    When it fails our client.

      Silence.  Alicia staring at Will.  

                                  DIANE
                    Okay, let s advise the client to 
                    take the offer.

    And Diane gets up, exits the office.  After a second, Alicia 
      gets up and leaves too.


      ...McVeigh fires away at a ballistic dummy-- work, not fun. 
    He glances up, sees a red light blinking.  Sees on a video 
      monitor Diane waiting at his door, ringing his bell.  

      McVeigh considers it, starts to aim at the ballistics dummy 
      again... stops.  Looks over at Diane.  Still there.  Now 
      looking up at the surveillance camera.  McVeigh takes off his 
    ear protection.


      Kalinda sits at the bar, two shots ready.  She sees Burton 
      approach.  Nods to him relieved.  He doesn t nod back, stands 
    at the bar with her.  She slides the shot toward him.   

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    So I seem to be a suspect. Apparently, 
                    Internal Affairs is looking into my 
                    connection with this Arkin shooting.

                                  KALINDA
                    I heard.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #122    "Running"   YELLOW COLLATED    4/27/10      52.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    This stuff seems to be coming from 
                    your lawsuit.

                                  KALINDA
                    That s right.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    That s why all your questions about 
                    what I do for friends-- you thought 
                    I did it?  

                                  KALINDA
                    Yes.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    Well, you know what?  Go to hell.

    And he leaves.  Kalinda watches him go, pauses a second, then 
      starts after him.  Stops him in the middle of the room.  
      Grabs his arm.  

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  KALINDA
                    Nothing, I just...

      Kalinda looks around.  The hardest words for her.

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    I m sorry.

      Kalinda slips him an envelope.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    What s this?

                                  KALINDA
                    Who really tipped off Gorman.  

      Burton looks at her, nods, starts off.  Leaving Kalinda alone 
    in the bar.  And...


      ...a press conference being set up.  Lectern.  Raised 
      platform.  In a small hotel ballroom.  Very similar to the 
      ballroom at the opening of the season.

      find... 


      ...Alicia seated in a green room backstage, staring straight 
      ahead.  Deep in thought.  Peter across from her.

                                  PETER
                    I don t know.

                    They re not going to leave us 
                    alone.  The press.

      Peter nods, looks off.

                                  PETER
                    I was reading about these murals in 
                    Sienna.  One showing good 
                      government.  People happy.  
                    Buildings going up.  Courts making 
                    good decisions.  On the opposite 
                    wall-- bad government.  The same 
                    people, but injured, unhappy, making 
                    bad decisions.  And I was thinking: 
                    it only works if people step up.  If 
                    people sacrifice. 

      Alicia studies him.

      as... 


      ...pop-- the cork is pulled from the $8,000 wine.  

      Will takes a paper cup, blows some dust out of it, sits, 
      pours himself a cup, takes a sip.  Not bad.  Not great.  He 
      stares at the bottle.  Really, $8,000?  

    He puts the bottle down.  Thinks about it.  Looks off.  Out 
    the window into the night.  It takes him a second and another 
      sip.  But he stands.  Buttons his coat.  Grabs the phone.

    The press conference.  Flashes.  A few TV cameras.  Not as 
      crowded as the first time around, but clearly there is 
      interest.  Peter alone at the lectern.  Four grinning LOCAL 
      POLITICIANS behind him.

      Meanwhile...


      ...Alicia watches, off-stage, feels her cellphone buzz.  
      Takes it out, sees the caller ID.  She answers...

                                  ALICIA
                    Hello.  Will?

      INTERCUT with...THE GOOD WIFE #122    "Running"   YELLOW COLLATED    4/27/10      55.




      ...Will in his office, hearing the noise of the hall:

                                  WILL
                    Alicia.  Hi.  Where are you? 

                                  ALICIA
                    Peter s press conference.  Is 
                    everything alright?

      Will takes a second.  This complicates matters.

                                  WILL
                    Yes.  I was just thinking: I don t 
                    want to go through life and think 
                    something didn t happen just 
                    because I didn t make myself clear.

                                  ALICIA
                    I can t hear you.

      Fuck.  Will frowns.  Hard to find that same emotional tone.

                                  WILL
                    I said... I want to make something 
                    clear.

                                  ALICIA
                    Hold on.

      Alicia moves down the hall, away from the noise of Peter s 
      speech, passing Eli who eyes her.  What s she up to?  Where s 
    she going?  He watches her turn a corner.   

    In Will s office.

                                  WILL
                    Okay, I just need to say it.  We ve 
                    been up and down, back and forth, 
                    and I look at you, Alicia, and I 
                    think--

                                  ALICIA
                    Will--

                                  WILL
                    I just need to say it.

                                  ALICIA
                    No.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #122    "Running"   YELLOW COLLATED    4/27/10      56.

      A firm Alicia.  Stopping it.  Will surprised.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Show me the plan.

                                  WILL
                    The...?

                                  ALICIA
                    Plan.  I get the romance.  Show me 
                    the plan.

                                  WILL
                    Not everything needs a plan.

                                  ALICIA
                    Everything that matters does.  I have 
                    two kids who mean the world to me.  I 
                    have the press waiting for any whiff of 
                    a new scandal.  And I have a husband.  
                    So if you want to cut through that 
                    noise, show me a plan.  Poetry is easy, 
                      parent-teacher conferences are hard.  

      Alicia hears Peter s voice-- an emphatic part of his speech.  
      Some cheers. 

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    I have to go now.  

      Will stumped.  Nothing to say.

                                  WILL
                    I--  Okay.

    But Alicia hangs up, starts toward Eli, who s waving to her-- 
      hurry.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    You re going to make my life hard, 
                    aren t you?  

      Alicia nods, starts toward the end of the hall, the stage 
      beyond, hearing Peter s voice getting louder:  

                                  PETER (O.S.)
                    Chicago once again needs a change.  A 
                    new beginning.  And I believe I am that 
                    change.  I am that new beginning.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #122    "Running"   YELLOW COLLATED    4/27/10      57.

    And that s it.  Spattered claps.  Yelled questions from 
      reporters.  The other politicians hug him, shake his hands as 
      Peter smiles, motions toward...

      ...Alicia in the hall.  She looks out at him and pauses.  She 
      takes a step toward the door when she hears a cellphone ring.  
    She takes it out of her pocket studies the caller ID.  

       Will. 

    She stands there a second.  And looks back up at Peter.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Alicia.

    And she looks back at the cell, frozen there.
