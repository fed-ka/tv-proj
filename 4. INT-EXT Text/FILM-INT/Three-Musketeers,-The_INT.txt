D'Artagnan steps through the country manor, calls out:
D'ARTAGNAN
Mother...?
But he does not see her.
D'Artagnan continues, chatter-
ing proudly as he goes.
D'ARTAGNAN
Did you see us? You heard us,
I'll bet. Girard finally
surrendered a compliment...
though I almost had to kill him
to get it... Mother...?
D'Artagnan comes upon an open door, a small room beyond.
He pauses, then steps inside.

A piece of parchment, on it the words: "All For One, and

gold tunic. Below it, the Handsome Woman, d'Artagnan's
mother, kneels at an open chest. She turns back to him.
MOTHER (HANDSOME WOMAN)
Sit down.
D'ARTAGNAN
Didn't you hear me? Girard --
MOTHER
Sit.
D'Artagnan sighs, sits in a large wooden chair. A beat.
His mother speaks quietly, eyes turned back to the open
chest.
MOTHER
Your father was a proud man. And
he had a right to be. I never
knew one as brave or as kind. He
knew that his strength was a gift
to be given in the service of
honor. That is why he dedicated
his life to his country and his
King. That is why he gave his
life, for both.
She reaches into the chest, carefully extracts a
beautiful saber.
MOTHER
I watched you this morning and
saw someone I knew. You have
your father's heart, his will to
fight, his courage. But these
gifts have no value unless they
are given.
She rises, holds the sword out to him.
MOTHER
It's time for you find your
fortune with men as brave and
as bold as you are. In Paris.
With the King's Musketeers.

You'll need this.

D'Artagnan can't help it, his eager reply leavens the
nobility of the moment with warm humor, youthful inno-
cence. His mother smiles as she repeats.
MOTHER
Yes, son.
And now to you.
With that, she holds out the beautiful saber.
D'Artagnan

Jussac and his company burst in and discover the room in
a shambles, the aftermath of a violent fight. But for
now, all is calm.
A group of the Cardinal's Guards is seated around a big
table littered with flagons and bottles. On the floor
around them are their swords and rifles. It appears the
Gruards are celebrating a victory. But wait. There's
something wrong with this picture. On closer inspection,
we see that the Guards have been stripped to their under-
clothes and tied to their chairs with ropes. They are
all bruised and bloody. Some are unconscious.
Presiding over the "celebration" are two Musketeers.
They sit at the head of the table, relaxing with their
boots up.

One of them casually cleans his sword with a lace hand-
kerchief. He is ARAMIS, the most handsome and dashing of
the Musketeers -- a poet and idealist -- a gentleman of
great personal charm and style.
His companion is
ATHOS, the Musketeers' deadliest and
most charismatic
member -- also its most mysterious and
tortured. Athos
is the unofficial leader of the Three
Musketeers, their
planner and strategist. At the moment,
he's sewing up a
nasty gash on his right arm.
JUSSAC
(approaching)
What is this?
Athos greets him with a dark smile.
ATHOS
A private party. Go away.
ARAMIS
Athos -- is that any way to greet
our guests?
Aramis leaps to his feet and bows graciously.
He is the
epitome of politeness.
ARAMIS
Don't be shy, gentlemen. Come
in. Your friends have been
expecting you.
Jussac is not amused.
JUSSAC
Your presence is requested at
Musketeer Headquarters by Captain
Rochefort.
Athos and Aramis exchange looks.
ATHOS
The Cyclops is a Captain? He
must've made a pact with the
Devil.
ARAMIS
Or the Cardinal.
ATHOS
What's the difference?

Jussac takes a step forward, fingering his saber.
JUSSAC
You're instructed to come with
me and surrender your tunics.
With a sweeping gesture, Athos indicates the bloody
Guards around him.
ATHOS
These gentlemen made a similar
request.
JUSSAC
Are you refusing to come
peaceably?
ATHOS
Probably. But I'll leave it up
to my companions. Aramis?
ARAMIS
We can't refuse Rochefort's
invitation. It would be
impolite.
Athos tips back in his chair and gazes upward.
ATHOS
And what do you say, Porthos?
To the Guards' surprise, Porthos is balancing on the
balcony rail above, just about even with a large wagon
wheel chandelier.
PORTHOS
I'll be right down!
With the grace of an aerialist, Porthos jumps from the
balcony and lands atop the chandelier. His weight causes
the chains suspending it to break. With a whoop of
pleasure, Porthos rides the chandelier down as it lands
squarely atop Jussac's Guards, squashing them.
When the dust clears, only Jussac has been spared. He
looks on in disbelief as Porthos extricates himself from
the wreckage and calmly brushes his clothes off.

wrap their capes around them and cross the room to join
Porthos.
ARAMIS
Congratulations, Porthos.
You
brought down the house.
PORTHOS
My aim was off. I was trying to
hit Jussac.
Athos fixes Jussac with a dark, threatening look.
ATHOS
Now.
About those tunics...
Jussac turns to watch Athos, Porthos, and Aramis step to
the street. He mutters as if to curse:
JUSSAC

Athos, Aramis, and Porthos sweep into the now deserted
courtyard. Silence -- the last thing they expected --
stops them in their tracks. The place is a cemetery,
haunted by the ghosts of generations of Musketeers.
Porthos is visibly distraught. Rochefort enters from
behind an archway.
ROCHEFORT
I'll take those tunics,
Musketeers.
PORTHOS
(to Aramis)
What did he say?
ARAMIS
He said he'll take those tunics.
PORTHOS
Tunics?
Coming right up.
Porthos reaches inside his cloak and takes out a crumpled
red tunic he took from one of the Cardinal's guards. He
drops it on the ground, digs into a pocket and takes out
another. He finds another in his boot and another up his
sleeve. There's one in his hat. Like a magician, he
keeps pulling red tunics out of the most bizarre places.
Athos and Aramis have a few guard tunics themselves.
They pull them out and drop them into the growing pile.
ATHOS
I was trying to remember the last
time I saw you here. I know. It
was the day you were kicked out of
the Musketeers.
ARAMIS
Conduct Unbecoming a Musketeer.
Wasn't that the charge?
ROCHEFORT
You ought to know. Three witnesses
stood against me.

ATHOS
And if we refuse?
ROCHEFORT
You will become outlaws.
Hunted

PORTHOS
It doesn't matter where I go or
what I do. Sooner or later
somebody's calling me 'outlaw.'
Athos cuts him off with a look. He's familiar with
Porthos' propensity for tall tales. But not here, not
now. Athos turns back to the balcony. Rochefort lobs a
taunt.
ROCHEFORT
Are you refusing to serve your
King?
ARAMIS
We are refusing to serve the
Cardinal.
PORTHOS
Same thing, these days.
ARAMIS
France has one King too many.
ROCHEFORT
I'll tell him you said that.
Athos, who has remained silent, speaks with quiet power:
ATHOS
Do that, Rochefort. Tell his
Emminence the Cardinal that we

Rochefort picks it up with
glee.
ROCHEFORT
I'll make sure His Emminence the
Cardinal gets the message. But I
can't promise he'll be pleased.
Rochefort steps back, disappears into the shadows.
A

PORTHOS
Well, if we're going to be
outlaws, I suppose we'll have to
get our affairs in order.
ARAMIS
Are you going to visit them
alphabetically or in order of
preference?
PORTHOS
Alphabetically seems... fair.
ARAMIS
When it comes to you and women,
fairness rarely applies.

BEAUTIFUL DAMSEL sharing a love seat with the third
Musketeer, the dashing Aramis. Aramis has a book open
and is reading from it.
The Damsel suddenly grabs Aramis and kisses him on the
mouth. Aramis politely extricates himself. He's not the
least bit embarrassed, only slightly amused.

DAMSEL
Excuse me, Monsieur Aramis. But
when you started talking about
Original Sin, I lost control and
became impassioned. It won't
happen again.
ARAMIS
There's nothing unholy about
expressing one's emotions. On
the contrary. Religion should be
experienced in a passionate, all-
embracing way. We should feel
free to express our spirituality.
DAMSEL
Yes, darling!
The Damsel attacks him again.
Suddenly, a pounding on
the door.
MAN (O.S.)
Open up!
DAMSEL
(a gasp of fear)
My husband!
ARAMIS
Your husband!?
DAMSEL
Aramis -- run!
But Aramis' heart is too noble.
He gets down on his
knees.
ARAMIS
First we must pray to God for
forgiveness.
That's when the door bursts open and the lady's husband,
an irate MARQUIS enters with a pistol. His eyes blaze
with madness. He aims the pistol at Aramis' head.
ARAMIS
On second thought, God's often
busy.
Aramis leaps to his feet and sprints for the open window.
As the Marquis aims and FIRES, Aramis puts one foot on
the ledge and leaps into space. The shot misses him by
inches.

D'Artagnan pushes Aramis aside. Aramis grabs d'Artagnan
by the scruff of his neck and pulls him back.
ARAMIS
If there's one thing I can't
abide, it's rudeness.
D'ARTAGNAN
You fell on me!
ARAMIS
And I apologized for it.
D'ARTAGNAN
I suppose you'd like to teach me a
lesson in manners, too.
ARAMIS
I'd be honored.
D'Artagnan brightens.
Another duel!

Anne, or rather, Queen Anne, steps into the throne room,
a massive cathedral-like chamber. Twin thrones occupy
a raised dais. An entire wall is covered with a spectac-
ular map of the world. The map contains every known
country and continent, including the New World. The
SENESCHAL exits, closing the doors with a resounding boom.
Anne pauses, all alone in the big, drafty chamber. And
for the first time, she looks and acts her age. Barely
a woman, chilled by the ghosts of all the French kings
and queens who came before her. And a long way from
home. Anne steps to the great map of the world. She
reaches out to touch her own country, Austria, feels a
pang of separation. We hear:
MAN (O.S.)
Your Majesty...
Anne reacts with a start. A tall, powerfully built man
stands in the shadows, a spectre in red.
ANNE
Cardinal Richelieu, you surprised
me.
Cardinal Richelieu steps out of the darkness.
He smiles.
RICHELIEU
How was your ride?
Richelieu's question takes her by surprise. He bows
before Anne. Considering a reply, she extends her hand.
The Cardinal kisses it.

ANNE
Thank you.
Richelieu turns to the great map, speaks gently.
RICHELIEU
You're homesick.

Lonely. Is that the same thing?
RICHELIEU

Richelieu brings his eyes back to Anne, continues:
RICHELIEU
Austria's loss is France's gain.
ANNE
I'm not sure my new husband shares
your opinion.
RICHELIEU
Nonsense.
He's young, not blind.
ANNE
Mostly, he is absent. I've barely
seen His Majesty since our wedding,
and that was three months ago.
Whenever he's around me, he has

Countries align more swiftly than

RICHELIEU
May I advise you?
He says it with seeming humility, not condescension.
Anne
nods assent.
RICHELIEU
Louis was only nine years old
when his father was assassinated.
He lost his childhood forever that
day. I have watched him grow
toward manhood, seen the toll his
life demands. A boy who is not
allowed to be a boy sometimes has
difficulty becoming a man. He is
shy, yet boastful. Giving, yet
stubborn. But most of all, he is
not yet sure exactly who he is.
The boy who lost his father. Or
the King of France.
ANNE
But how can I...?
RICHELIEU
Flatter him. Make the boy feel
like a King. So that the King
may be your husband.
Anne considers his eloquent advice, formulates a reply...
when the huge doors to the throne room open with a dull
boom, the Seneschal chants:
SENESCHAL
His Majesty, the King.
The Seneschal steps aside as LOUIS XIII enters. He is
surprisingly young, no older than d'Artagnan. His face
is handsome and intelligent.
RICHELIEU

behind a formal veneer. Anne, emboldened by Richelieu's
confidences, replies:
ANNE
Would you like me to go?
Louis suddenly remembers the reason he's here.
Determin-
ation breeds a more capable attitude.
LOUIS
No.
Please, stay.
(to Richelieu, aware
that she is watching
him)
Your Eminence, I demand an answer.

Perhaps if I knew the question...
LOUIS
I've just been told that you went
ahead and disbanded my Musketeers.
RICHELIEU
You approved the decision.

But not the timing of the matter.
I intended to address them myself,
explain the situation...

He says it with newfound resolve. Richelieu receives the
rebuke with quiet grace. Anne watches the latter closely,
suppresses a smile. The boy is nearer to King than
Richelieu imagined.
RICHELIEU
Of course.

LOUIS

humor)
I have no idea.
RICHELIEU
The course of love is full of
frightful turns. But, no matter
how you feel, no matter how
hopelessly afraid... never let
her know that you are anything
other than the bravest and most
confident man in France. Make
that your starting point, and
everything else will fall... into
place.

D'Artagnan wakes with a start, springs back into action.
As if he was still battling Jussac at the Carmes-Deschaux.
He slaps the sword away, leaps to his feet, and reaches
for his own. But it is gone.
D'ARTAGNAN

Rochefort steps INTO VIEW, the familiar eyepatch, admiring

Bold words, bad timing. Rochefort snarls, slams the hilt
of the sword into d'Artagnan's head. The youth slumps
from the wooden stool to the floor, unconscious.
ROCHEFORT
Fool.

Rochefort storms from the cell. He nods at a grizzled
jailer on his way out, indicates the chains and manacles
on the cell wall. The jailer scurries over to d'Artagnan,
inert in a shallow puddle of foul water. He lifts, drags
him toward the chains -- but d'Artagnan's eyes pop open,
the jailer reacts with surprise, and...

The jailer exits from d'Artagnan's cell, closes the heavy

He seeks exit, finds only a labyrinth. Two jailers con-

doorway, allows them to pass. Suddenly: scabrous hands
reach from inside the cell, grab d'Artagnan by the throat.
He shudders, leaps free. And continues.
D'Artagnan steps
deeper in the labyrinth. Frustrated,
no way out. Just
then: more FOOTSTEPS heading toward
him. D'Artagnan
seeks refuge, watches as a cloaked
figure steps INTO

sullen jailers.
D'Artagnan thinks fast... and joins them.

escorted up a long stairway, into another hall, and
toward a pristine wooden door. D'Artagnan watches as
the door opens, revealing... Cardinal Richelieu, a fear-
some apparition in red, the most powerful man in France.
D'Artagnan's jaw drops. The cloaked figure steps inside.
The jailers disperse. D'Artagnan takes steps as if to
join them... then turns back, eyes the door, the Cardinal
and the cloaked figure now behind it.

The cloaked figure bows to the Cardinal. Richelieu
smiles, concupiscent. Rochefort stands in a corner,
ignored for the moment.
RICHELIEU
I have an errand that requires
your singular talents.
The figure rises. The hood falls back... revealing the
unforgettable features of Milady de Winter. She answers
the Cardinal's smile with a seductive expression.
MILADY
I was beginning to think you'd
forgotten me.
RICHELIEU
Forget you?
Impossible.
Richelieu and Milady share a look of intimacy, two vipers
from the same pit.

OUTSIDE DOOR

D'Artagnan slips closer, reaches for the handle, finds it
unlocked. He opens the door a fraction, holds an ear
close...
55
BACK TO SCENE

Richelieu produces a sealed document from his sleeve,
and hands it to Milady.
RICHELIEU
Carry this to the Duke of
Buckingham.

MILADY
(impressed)
You did it. An alliance with
Buckingham.
RICHELIEU
The King left me no choice. Now
that he's come of age, the boy
believes he should rule France.
Instead of me.
Rochefort knows what this portends.
He steps from the
corner.
ROCHEFORT
You're going to go through with
... everything?
RICHELIEU
(silences him with
a glance)
Yes. Everything.
(to Milady)
You're to leave for Calais at
once. A ship called the
Persephone will carry you to
England. It sails Tuesday,
midnight. I want Buckingham's
signature next to mine before the
King's birthday. Friday.
MILADY
Consider it done.
RICHELIEU
And doing so, shall earn you the
gratitude of... a King.
Richelieu's not talking about Louis.
He's talking about
himself.

D'Artagnan leaps back from the door as it opens, head
down, shuffles to join the retinue of jailers as they
RETURN TO VIEW. Milady, unrecognizable behind her cloak,
steps into the corridor, the retinue escorts her forward.
D'Artagnan falls into place, eyes down, eager for escape.
Just then: a hand slams down upon his shoulder.
D'Artagnan looks up into the face of Captain Rochefort.
51.
57
58
D'Artagnan lands with a thud at Richelieu's feet.
Rochefort hisses:
ROCHEFORT
On your knees.
When d'Artagnan fails to respond, Rochefort gives him a
mighty kick. D'Artagnan scrambles into the correct
posture of supplication. Rochefort continues:
ROCHEFORT
This is the boy who killed
Jussac.
D'ARTAGNAN
I can explain that --
ROCHEFORT
Silence!
Rochefort punches d'Artagnan in the head, knocking him to
the floor. The Cardinal frowns.
RICHELIEU
Rochefort. Violence solves
nothing. Leave him to me.
D'Artagnan reacts to the Cardinal's reasonable tone.
Rochefort makes a sullen exit. The Cardinal smiles.
RICHELIEU
Please.
Sit down.
D'Artagnan reacts with perceptible awe, as if seeing his
first movie star. He sits in a finely brocaded chair,
looks at the Cardinal, an apparition in red. The Cardinal
speaks, his manner casual, friendly.
RICHELIEU
How much did you hear?
D'ARTAGNAN
(busted)
Not a word, Your Eminence. I
stepped from my cell for a breath
of air, and became lost in the
corridors, it's dark as you know,
but then I saw a light up ahead,
the light over your door, I...

Richelieu smiles, dismisses d'Artagnan's tale with a
wave of his hand.
RICHELIEU
You may have many talents, my
young friend. But guile is not
one of them. Do you have a name?
D'ARTAGNAN
D'Artagnan.
RICHELIEU
I've heard that name before.
Are
you a Gascon?
D'ARTAGNAN
Yes, Your Eminence.
RICHELIEU
Tell me. What brought you to
Paris. And don't say 'a horse.'
D'ARTAGNAN
I came to join the King's
Musketeers.
RICHELIEU
Bad timing.
D'ARTAGNAN
So I've heard.
RICHELIEU
D'Artagnan, I like you. I could
use a capable young man like you
in my Guards.
D'ARTAGNAN
I'm honored, Your Eminence, but I
don't think I would be very
popular with the other men. Not
after today.
RICHELIEU
I suppose not. Your heart is set
on being a Musketeer.
(off his look)
When I was your age, I too had
dreams of joining the Musketeers.
D'ARTAGNAN
(surprised)
You, Your Eminence?
(CONTINUED)
53.
58
CONTINUED:

58
RICHELIEU
Why not? Becoming a Musketeer is
the fantasy of every young
Frenchman. Or should I say it
was...
(with seeming
kindness, reason)
Like the Knights of the Round
Table, the Musketeers have
outlived their usefulness. They
are a thing of the past.
(beat)
And so have your three friends.
Tell me where they are, d'Artagnan,
and I will spare your life.
Richelieu's seeming kindness conceals a heart of ice.
D'Artagnan sees it now, replies quietly. No longer in
awe, but in opposition.
D'ARTAGNAN
I'm sorry. But I can't tell you
what I do not know.
RICHELIEU
In that case, give my regards to
the headsman.
D'ARTAGNAN
What about my trial?
RICHELIEU
You've just had it.
Richelieu turns for the door, means to dismiss him.
D'Artagnan calls after.
D'ARTAGNAN
Wait --
RICHELIEU
Why? Do you object to losing
your head?
D'ARTAGNAN
Yes.
I like it where it is.
RICHELIEU
Then tell me what I want to know,
and perhaps you will keep it there
a few years longer.
(beat)
Where are the three Musketeers?
(CONTINUED)
54.
58
CONTINUED:

58
D'ARTAGNAN
I don't know.
RICHELIEU
And if you did?
D'ARTAGNAN
(after a beat)
I wouldn't tell you.
RICHELIEU
I admire your courage, young man.
You might have made a fine
Musketeer after all.
Richelieu opens the door.
Rochefort waits on the other
side.
RICHELIEU
But we'll never know, will we?
Rochefort steps into the room, grabs d'Artagnan roughly
by the arm, hurls him from the chair to the floor. This
time Richelieu does not utter protest. Instead, he
turns to the Captain, commands:
RICHELIEU
Find the three Musketeers and kill
them.
ROCHEFORT
They'll be dead by dawn.
RICHELIEU
A comforting thought. Good night,
d'Artagnan. Enjoy it. Morning
comes quickly.
With that, Cardinal Richelieu sweeps into the dark.
HOLD
ON d'Artagnan for a beat. History's pawn.

Aramis and Porthos have settled in comfortably.
Porthos
spies a wicker hamper on the floor.
PORTHOS
Well, what have we here?
Porthos lifts the lid. Inside: bottles of wine, champagne,
and a wide assortment of foods.
PORTHOS
How considerate of the Cardinal
to provide us with a snack.

Porthos extracts a bottle of wine, grabs a turkey leg.
Aramis looks about the interior, spies a small ornate
box.
ARAMIS
Hello.
Aramis opens the box, reacts.
It is filled with gold
coins, jewelry.
ARAMIS
How is it that a man of God
becomes a man of gold?
PORTHOS
(looks on, grins)
Trinkets for the ladies.
ARAMIS
Let's share.

STREETS OF PARIS - CARRIAGE

Aramis sticks his head through the hole in the fabric
roof, hands the ornate box to d'Artagnan.
ARAMIS
Would you be so good as to
distribute these? Your generosity
will be greatly appreciated.
D'ARTAGNAN
(open the box, reacts)
But...?
ARAMIS
(to the point)
Throw the coins, boy.
The people
are hungry.
D'Artagnan grabs a handful of coins, and tosses them into
the air. Aramis smiles approval, drops back to the
carriage interior. Pedestrians see the gold, shout, and
leap after. Their hurried steps impede the Guards' pro-
gress, horses rear up, soldiers tumble. But several of
the Guards manage to avoid the obstacle, pursue the
carriage with renewed determination. D'Artagnan hears a
LOUD POPPING sound, ducks.
D'ARTAGNAN
They're firing at us!
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Porthos sticks his head INTO VIEW, offers them a bubbling
bottle of champagne, the source of the popping sound.
PORTHOS
Champagne?
ATHOS
You know I prefer wine.
PORTHOS
Don't go away.
Porthos ducks down, returns with a new bottle.
PORTHOS
May I recommend this find
Cabernet?
Porthos hands
the bottle to Athos. Athos hands the reins
to d'Artagnan.
D'Artagnan struggles with the reins, tries
to control the
horses. And beams, taking delight from
every instant
of adventure. Athos SMASHES the top of the
BOTTLE, drinks
deeply, settles back to enjoy himself.
ATHOS
Turn right at the next street.
D'ARTAGNAN
The next right...?
ATHOS
Turn.
Athos growls, d'Artagnan jerks at the reins. The carriage
careens around the corner, tipping on two wheels.

A large warm tavern with a ROARING FIRE.

Present are the INNKEEPER, his wife, a few benighted tra-
velers and THREE BARMAIDS. They turn as the door flies
open and the Musketeers and d'Artagnan enter from a RAGING
STORM. They keep their cloaks drawn about them and wear
the brims of their hats pulled low to cover their faces.
The occupants of the inn regard the new arrivals with
suspicion. Outisde, the STORM BLOWS. D'Artagnan closes
the heavy door. Fearful, the Innkeeper comes forward to
meet the four ominous travelers.
INNKEEPER
Good evening.
ATHOS
See to our horses and bring us
some food.
INNKEEPER
(apologetic)
I'm sorry but we have little to
spare. The Cardinal's Guards were
here today. They helped
themselves to our food and then
refused to pay.
ARAMIS
(bitter)
In the name of God, I'm sure.
Porthos is on the lookout for danger. He reaches inside
his cloak for a weapon and, in doing so, accidentally
exposes his Musketeer tunic.
BARMAID #1
(crying out)
Musketeers!
The sound of SLIDING STEEL as Athos, Porthos, Aramis and
d'Artagnan draw their swords, ready to fight. They stand
back to back in a circle, ready for attack.
But there is no attack. Quite the contrary.
The people
here are thrilled to see them.
INNKEEPER
(honored)
Musketeers in my house! Gentlemen,
put away your swords and come in.
Anyone who fights the Cardinal is
welcome here.
The Musketeers lower their swords.

ARAMIS
I think we've found a home.
The Musketeers return their swords to their sheathes and
take off their dripping hats and capes. The pretty
Barmaids crowd around them to collect their gear and car-
ry it to the fire.
INNKEEPER
We don't have much but what we
have is yours.
Porthos rubs his hands together, eager to indulge himself.
He follows the Barmaids, booming in his loud, friendly
voice.
PORTHOS
Ladies, you're in for a treat
tonight. Allow me to introduce
myself. I'm the Musketeer they
call Porthos.
Porthos beams, waiting for a big response but nothing
happens. The Barmaids look at each other.
PORTHOS
(repeating; louder)
Porthos.
Still no response.
Aramis and d'Artagnan hide smiles.
ARAMIS
It's hard to believe they haven't
heard of the great Porthos.
PORTHOS
Oh, shut up, Aramis.
The three Barmaids perk up.
BARMAIDS
(with excitement)
Aramis? Did you say Aramis?
And with that, the three Barmaids desert Porthos and
scurry across the room to attach themselves to Aramis.
Porthos shakes his head and flops down in a chair.
PORTHOS
I don't get it. I just don't
get it.

Moments later.
Porthos regales the Barmaids with a tale.
PORTHOS
I said, 'A Queen is no different
than a barmaid in the dark. Though
less... practiced in the arts of
pleasure...'
The Barmaids accept his leering compliment with glee.
But d'Artagnan isn't so sure. Porthos, with two Barmaids,
bellows a reply.
PORTHOS
If you're going to be a proper
Musketeer, you'll have to learn
the manly art of wenching. Right,
ladies?
The Barmaids heartily concur. D'Artagnan looks over
Porthos' shoulder, to the dark-haired Barmaid seen previ-
ously. Porthos follows his gaze, grins.
PORTHOS
Ahh, very good. Your first
subject. But you'll need
instruction. Watch closely.
Porthos pulls one of the Barmaids to his chest, brings
her lips toward his.
PORTHOS
The secret to wenching is the
first kiss. For in that kiss, a
lasting impression is made. If it
is weak, she will think you are
weak. And if it is comical, she
will think you are a clown. With
me?
D'ARTAGNAN
Weak... weak.
Comical... clown.
PORTHOS
Very good.
And as a Musketeer is
never weak,
and only rarely a
clown, your
first kiss must be all
the things
that you are. Like
this...
Porthos gives the Barmaid a powerful kiss.
He breaks it,
turns to d'Artagnan with a grin.
(CONTINUED)
73.
83
CONTINUED:

PORTHOS
You may speak first if you like,
your name, her name, an endearment
or two. But words are usually a
waste of time.
ARAMIS
Only if you don't know which words
to say.
All turn to regard Aramis. He'll play along too.
Porthos reacts with delight. D'Artagnan with interest.
Aramis continues:
ARAMIS
Words may make a more lasting
impression than a thousand of
Porthos' kisses.
BARMAID
(still reeling)
Not likely.
ARAMIS
I'll demonstrate. Please.
Sit
beside me.
Aramis' courtly behavior is as out of place in these en-
virons as it is persuasive. The Barmaid slips from
Porthos' lap, sits down on the bench beside him.
Aramis does not touch her. He simply looks into her
eyes... and begins to speak.
ARAMIS
'Shall I compare thee to a
summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more
temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling
buds of May,
And summer's leash hath all too
short a date;
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven
shines,
And often is his gold complexion
dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometimes
declines,
By chance, or nature's changing
course untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not
fade.

ARAMIS (CONT'D)
Nor lose possession of that fair
thou owest,
Nor shall death brag thou
wanderest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou
growest;
So long as men can breathe, or eyes
can see.
So long lives this, and this gives
life to thee.'
The Barmaid, once skeptical, sits silently. Her face
covered with tears. Aramis pauses, almost embarrassed by
the outcome. He turns to d'Artagnan, cites:
ARAMIS
Shakespeare.
PORTHOS
That's cheating.
The Barmaid on his lap disagrees.
BARMAID
It's beautiful.
D'Artagnan looks at the dark-haired Barmaid across the
room. Porthos urges him on.
PORTHOS
Come on, d'Artagnan. We haven't
got all night.
D'Artagnan steps forward. The dark-haired Barmaid sees
him coming and smiles. D'Artagnan stands before her,
hesitates, not sure where to start. Then, remembering as
best he can:
D'ARTAGNAN
'Shall I compare thee to a summer's
day?
Thou are move lovely and more
tempest, er, more tempered...'
(beat)
Ahh, to hell with it --
D'Artagnan takes the Barmaid into his arms, delivers a
powerful kiss. As previously demonstrated. Porthos and
Aramis smile proudly. The Barmaids cheer.
PORTHOS
The boy's a natural.

ARAMIS
So little time, so much to learn.
D'Artagnan drains his flagon, indicates Athos sitting at
a table by himself, scowling, working on his third bottle
of Burgundy.
ARAMIS
In all the years I've know him...
I have never seen Athos smile.
D'ARTAGNAN
Why is he sitting by himself?
PORTHOS
Athos takes his drinking seriously.
Ignore him. He'll be his usual
warm, charming self by morning.
(calls out)
Service! My lap is cold!
A Barmaid scurries INTO
VIEW. Porthos grabs her by the
waist, adds the Barmaid
to the one already sitting on his
lap. The chair breaks
beneath them, and all three go
sprawling on the floor,
laughing heartily.
84
ATHOS
84
He remains lost in drink. D'Artagnan appears beside him.
He hides his concern behind a cheerful attitude.
D'ARTAGNAN
Come join us.
Athos pulls d'Artagnan down with a dark smile.
He fills
his flagon for him.
ATHOS
You fight like a Musketeer. Let's
see if you can drink like one.
D'ARTAGNAN
I'll drink anything you put in
front of me.
ATHOS
Famous last words.
(raising his flagon)
What shall we drink to?
D'Artagnan notices the dark-haired Barmaid eyeing him
across the room.
(CONTINUED)
76.

CONTINUED:
84
D'ARTAGNAN
Love?
The word nearly makes Athos grimace. He stares at
d'Artagnan for a long beat, then beyond. As if to look
into another time and place. Finally:
ATHOS
Love.
(beat)
Would you like to hear a story,
d'Artagnan? A love story?
Athos' voice reveals unexpected vulnerability, the pain
he keeps inside. D'Artagnan is fascinated, moved. He
nearly whispers:
D'ARTAGNAN
Yes.
Athos takes a long pull from the bottle of burgundy,
wipes the blood red wine from his lips.
ATHOS
I once knew a man... one of the
Counts of Berry. My native
province. When the good Count was
about your age, he fell in love
with a visitor from Paris. A
breathtaking girl of seventeen.
She was more than beautiful,
d'Artagnan. She was...
intoxicating. And this man, the
poor idiot, he married her.
D'ARTAGNAN
Isn't that what people do when
they fall in love?
ATHOS
(sharply)
Be quiet and listen.
(beat)
The Count took her to his castle
and made her the first lady of the
province. They were happy for a
time, as happy as a man and a
woman can be. Then one day, while
riding in the woods, the girl was
thrown from her horse, and knocked
unconscious. The Count hurried to
help her. Her dress was torn.

ATHOS (CONT'D)
On her her arm, the woman wore a
gold band in the shape of a
serpent. It was the only article
of clothing she refused to remove.
The Count's curiosity got the best
of him. He reached over and slid
down the gold band. He saw
something on her arm... something
she'd kept hidden 'til then...
D'ARTAGNAN
What?
ATHOS
The fleur d'lis. She'd been
branded...
85
ANOTHER ANGLE
85
D'Artagnan reacts with shock.
ATHOS
The Count's angel turned out to be
a murderess who escaped the
Executioner's blade. She swore
that she loved him. Swore that
she had changed. And if he would
just keep her secret, they would
live a long life together.
Athos pauses, imagines that life.
The Count and his
angel.
ATHOS
But the Count was young and he was
stupid. He was tormented by the
ridicule of his social class. And
so he rejected her. For her lies
and for her past.
(beat)
And turned her over to the
authorities to be executed for the
crime.
Athos now turns his unflinching gaze on d'Artagnan.
ATHOS
But you see... his heart did not
agree.
The Count soon realized
what she had meant to him. And
what he had done.

ATHOS (CONT'D)
That his... betrayal was far
greater than her own.
(beat)
Soon after he foreswore the
society that shaped him. Gave up
his title. And was never seen
again.
D'ARTAGNAN
He loved her.
ATHOS
He killed her. It seemed like the
same thing after a while.
HOLD ON Athos for a long time.
As he gathers up his pain,
and puts it back again.
Athos SMASHES open another BOTTLE. But the story has
made d'Artagnan quite sober and a little sick to his
stomach. He refuses another drink.
ATHOS
Good.
More for me.
PORTHOS
Aramis -- play something with some
blood in it! I feel like dancing!
Aramis launches into something appropriate. Porthos and
a Barmaid get up and begin a festive folk dance.
Porthos is damned good. His joie de vivre is infectious
and soon everyone in the inn is clapping and encouraging
him. Every once in awhile, another WEAPON -- a dagger or
something -- drops out of Porthos' clothing and hits the
floor with a CLATTER.
That's when Porthos, dancing with abandon, spins out of
control, trips and falls on Athos' table, crushing it to
the floor.
Porthos lies in the wreckage, staring up. Athos, totally
unperturbed, looks down and offers him the bottle.
PORTHOS
Care to dance, Athos?
ATHOS
Only if I can lead.
Porthos blinks in amazement at Athos' grim face, then
breaks out laughing.
PORTHOS
Aramis!
Athos made a joke!

The Innkeeper comes down the stairs wearing a nightshirt
and a sleepy expression.
INNKEEPER
Excuse me, gentlemen.
D'ARTAGNAN
Were we making too much noise?
INNKEEPER
You told me to wake you at dawn.
ATHOS
Well?
INNKEEPER
It's dawn.
They turn in disbelief to the shuttered windows. Sure
enough. Sunlight is peeking in through the cracks.

A room heavy with mist and steam. Behind a maze of gauze
screens, we discover Anne reclining in a large tiled bath,
Constance attending. Constance replenishes the bath with
pitchers of hot water drawn from a boiling cauldron.
In mid-conversation, as confidantes and friends:
CONSTANCE
But how, your Majesty? How can
you tell if you're really in love?
ANNE
Do you think about him all the
time?
CONSTANCE
(considers; replies)
Yes.
ANNE
And when he's around, do your
knees feel as weak as water?
CONSTANCE
Yes.
ANNE
And when he looks at you, do you
suddenly forget how to breathe?

CONSTANCE
Yes.
ANNE
Then you're in love.
CONSTANCE

knowledge; knew it

Anne turns to Constance, soap and water swirl about her
naked body. She wonders:
ANNE
Who is he?
CONSTANCE
You'll never believe it.
ANNE
Of course I will.
CONSTANCE
You won't.
ANNE
Who?
CONSTANCE
The young man who rescued us from
the bandit.
ANNE
The young man on the scaffold?
CONSTANCE
Yes.
ANNE
(turns back in the
water, peers ahead)
You're right. I don't believe it.

Constance teases:
CONSTANCE
Do you think about him all the
time?
ANNE
(playing along)
As Queen, my mind touches on many
subjects.
CONSTANCE
Do your knees feel as weak as
water?
ANNE
Never.
CONSTANCE
When he looks at you, do you
forget how to breathe?
A beat. And Anne is a girl of eighteen again, not Queen.
Wistful, she replies:
ANNE
I hope he will someday.
I hope
I will too.
HOLD ON Anne for a beat.

ANNE
On what matter?
RICHELIEU

Your King.
Richelieu allows the jest, remains silent, watchful.
Anne resumes, chooses her words with care.
ANNE
Of course. As Your Eminence has
been kind enough to advise me...
(nods assent)
It's the least I can do.
Richelieu reacts with quiet pleasure.
He steps closer.
RICHELIEU
I am worried about the King's...
happiness.
ANNE
What do you mean?
RICHELIEU

in the Antilles and Cayenne. The
coming war with France. These are
not the usual hobbies of youth.
ANNE
No.

RICHELIEU
He feels it is not... appropriate.
ANNE
It sounds as though he is

matters.
RICHELIEU
Which is exactly why we must
celebrate.
(off her look)
To show the world that the King of
France is strong enough to face
any enemy on any field. To show
France... that he is King.
(beat)
He will listen to you. If you
will speak.
Richelieu makes his case with forceful eloquence, seeming
loyalty. Anne considers, replies, noncommittal:
ANNE
I will speak to him.
Anne senses hidden agenda, intrigues below the surface.
The conversation's conspiratorial tone begins to disturb
her.
ANNE
Now, if you'll excuse me, I...

Of course.
Anne nods, turns back toward the chambers.
Richelieu

And that I wish for you to
consider -- in fact, to know --
all that you and I might

For France.
Richelieu steps away, his red cape swirling behind him.
Anne feels a chill, pulls her robe more tightly about
her body.

Louis watches from a balcony. Richelieu appears, fresh
from his encounter with the Queen.
RICHELIEU
I'm sorry to be late, Your
Majesty, but I was wrestling with
an important matter of state.
Richelieu never allows the mask to slip. Even for an
instant. Louis glances at the throne room, the increasing
number of Cardinal's Guards on duty. They make him feel
uncomfortable. Louis speaks with renewed determination.
LOUIS
Why is it I don't see any of my
Musketeers?
RICHELIEU
I'm afraid... that's impossible.
LOUIS
Why?

RICHELIEU
They have become outlaws. They
are terrorizing the countryside,
robbing and killing innocent
people.
Louis can't believe it.
LOUIS
There must be some mistake.
RICHELIEU
No mistake. I have reports from
the local constables involved.
Richelieu, ever prepared, produces a sheaf of papers. No
doubt counterfeit. But Louis has no way of knowing. He
takes the papers into his hands, reacts with sadness.
LOUIS
Musketeers...
RICHELIEU
They are better off disbanded.
Louis turns back to the balcony, the soldiers marching
below. His mood glum and lonely. He sighs, moves on to
another matter of business.
LOUIS
Your Eminence, I've been hearing
some very troubling rumors about
you.
Richelieu nods, not the least bit concerned.
RICHELIEU
There are so many to choose from.
Is it the one about my alleged
alliance with Buckingham? Let's
see if I remember it correctly.
While the English attack from
without, I'll undermine the throne
from within -- depose you -- and
become sovereign of France myself.
That rumor, Your Majesty?
Richelieu smiles, his face a mask of innocence.
LOUIS
It does seem rather farfetched.

RICHELIEU
If there are any doubts of my
loyalty, they'll be put to rest

birthday celebration.
LOUIS
I've been thinking about that. A
birthday celebration when we're
on the brink of war...
RICHELIEU
(alert, ready for
this as well)
Your subjects are eager to
celebrate the birth of their King
at a time like this.
LOUIS
I'm not so eager.
RICHELIEU
I have an idea. Why don't you
discuss the matter with your
Queen?
Louis looks up, wonders. As Richelieu draws him deeper
into his spider's strategems.

A room as cold as the man who owns it. Behind
Richelieu's desk, there is a life-sized portrait of the
King. Rochefort occupies a window seat, cleaning
d'Artagnan's sword. He lifts it to the light, and
slashes the air. He stands, duels with an imaginary
opponent. Richelieu enters with the message.
RICHELIEU
(dry; re: Rochefort's
fencing)
The wonderful thing about an
imaginary opponent is that he is
always greatly skilled, and always
easily defeated. The pride of
victory, without the risk of loss.
If only life were like that.
Richelieu sits at his desk, peers at the message.
He
looks up, pleased.

ROCHEFORT
I told you not to worry about the

RICHELIEU
Buckingham's signature will be on
the treaty by morning.
ROCHEFORT
The King's birthday celebration...?
RICHELIEU
Will proceed as planned. Thanks
to the kind intercession of Queen
Anne.
Rochefort steps closer, speaks quietly.
ROCHEFORT
And our plans...?
RICHELIEU
(knowingly)
Will proceed as well.
Richelieu pours two glasses of port, offers one to
Rochefort. They turn, raise their glasses to the
King's portrait. And drink.

D'Artagnan and Milady face each other on a rug in front
of the roaring fire. The plate of food between them is
empty. They drink wine from goblets. D'Artagnan drains
his cup, and stares into the burning embers. Milady
speaks quietly, with seeming compassion:
MILADY
You are sad.
D'ARTAGNAN
I was thinking about my friends.
Milady knows when to speak, and when to listen. She
looks at d'Artagnan with gentle expression, allows him to
continue. The warm room, the wine, her kindness. All
conspire to loosen his tongue. D'Artagnan speaks
quietly, from the heart:

D'ARTAGNAN
The three best friends a man could
have. We were separated on our
way to Calais. I'm afraid I'll
never see them again.
MILADY
What brings you here?
D'ARTAGNAN
I'd like to tell you. But I can't.
MILADY
'Important business.'
D'Artagnan nods. He wants to impress her. He wants her
to know how brave he is. And Milady is well aware of it.
She looks down, assumes a more vulnerable pose.
MILADY
I understand. Men make bold plans
in secret. And women wait... to
mourn, or to celebrate the outcome.
I know from experience, it's a
lonely vigil.
D'ARTAGNAN
(after a beat)
All I can tell you is... I'm on a
mission for the King.
MILADY
(looks up; laughs
lightly)
I've heard that one before.
D'ARTAGNAN
I'm serious.
MILADY
You are a young man. And young
men are given to exaggeration.
However, if you would like to
entertain me with a story, I'm
eager to hear it. And please,
make it very brave, filled with
handsome knights and beautiful
ladies. I know, a dragon --
There is nothing a man is more loathe to experience than
a woman who does not take him seriously. D'Artagnan acts
accordingly, and reveals:

MILADY

d'Artagnan doesn't
see it)
A spy...?
D'ARTAGNAN
Yes.
MILADY
I believe you...
(beat)
Aren't you afraid?
D'ARTAGNAN
Musketeers are not afraid of
anything.
MILADY
I knew it. I knew you were a
Musketeer the moment I saw you.
D'ARTAGNAN
You did?
MILADY
Of course.
(with sudden concern)
But, d'Artagnan, if this spy was
to find out you are here, your
life could be in grave danger.
D'ARTAGNAN
A Musketeer is not afriad of
danger.
MILADY
I'm dangerous. You're not afraid
of me?
Her tone heralds a sudden shift. D'Artagnan sees the
look in her eyes, can almost feel her lips upon him.
But he resists. There is Constance's memory to consider.
And midnight as it approaches.
D'ARTAGNAN
You're not dangerous.
MILADY
Then what am I?

D'ARTAGNAN
You're... beautiful.
Milady covers him with caresses. D'Artagnan resists
slightly, but she presses closer, she will not be denied.
Milady leans close, runs a fingertip along
the line of
his jaw. Her dressing gown falls open at
the top, enough
for d'Artagnan to see her breasts as they
press against
the silk beneath it. Milady speaks as her
finger traces.
MILADY
Beauty, danger. They are the same.
And with that, she reaches up to her hair, an ivory
comb...
111
ON D'ARTAGNAN
111
He cannot continue.
Constance, the hour, a confusion he
cannot deny.
D'ARTAGNAN
I'm sorry --
D'Artagnan pulls back -- just as Milady's arm arcs down
toward his neck, holding a long sharp stick pin, almost a
dagger, attached to an ivory comb. D'Artagnan sees it in
the nick of time, parries with his free hand, knocking
the dagger to the rug. Milady leaps after it, hands out-
stretched. D'Artagnan follows, battles for the dagger,
stunned with fear and surprise:
D'ARTAGNAN
What're you doing?! Have you lost
your mind?!
MILADY
You came to Calais to stop a spy
from sailing to England.
D'Artagnan nearly chokes on the knowledge. Milady is the
messenger he is seeking. He grabs the dagger, rolls to
the side. Milady staggers after, the shoulder of her
negligee rips open. D'Artagnan sees the soft white flesh,
reacts with shock, recognition -- she bears the brand of
the fleur de lis. The infamous mark of the murderess.
Just as Athos told it to him.
Not so long ago.
D'ARTAGNAN
My God...

MILADY
(crying out)
Parker!!
The chamber door flies open. Henri and Parker, the Indo-
Chinese bodyguard, appear. Parker faces d'Artagnan with
a half-smile. He holds out his hands, both empty. And
steps toward him. D'Artagnan looks at the dagger in his
right hand. Then, unwilling to fight the man with an un-
fair advantage, he tosses the dagger to the side, steps
forward to meet him.
Parker disposes of d'Artagnan with lightning speed. A
series of unexpected kicks, brutally efficient blows.
The young man is unfamiliar with, and no match for, the
martial arts. Parker hoists d'Artagnan to his feet,
dazed. Henri picks up the dagger with bad intentions.
Milady straightens her dressing gown, adjusts her hair,
and commands:
MILADY
Kill him.
Parker holds him fast. Henri steps forward.
And
d'Artagnan thinks fast.
D'ARTAGNAN
You can kill me. But a surprise
waits for you in England. That
even Buckingham can't prevent.
MILADY
(stops Henri with
a gesture)
What... surprise?
D'ARTAGNAN
That's one thing I'll never tell
you.
MILADY
D'Artagnan. You are young, vain,
and foolish. But I do not know
if you are clever.
D'Artagnan's expression reveals nothing. Except to
suggest the existence of a secret he is bravely keeping.
Duly deceived, though she doesn't know it, Milady changes
her mind.
MILADY
We'll take him with us.

Milady emerges from her room, dressed for travel. She is
followed by d'Artagnan, now clothed. He is flanked by
Henri and Parker. Henri presses the blade of a knife
against d'Artagnan's side.
HENRI
The bodyguards are waiting outside.
Milady leads them down the hall. But when she reaches
the landing, and looks at the tavern below... she draws
back with surprise.
113
ANGLE TO INCLUDE MILADY AND HER POV
113
The innkeeper, roused
from sleep, and wearing a night-
shirt, is engaged in
urgent conversation with Armand de
Winter -- the son of
the man Milady killed in Paris. The
innkeeper shakes his
head. Armand grabs him by the
collar.
D'Artagnan sees Milady's reaction -- surprise, impatience,
and just a hint of fear. Milady commands:
MILADY
The back stairs. Hurry!
They change directions. As he is pulled away, d'Artagnan
catches a glimpse of Armand de Winter below.
CUT TO:
114
115
D'Artagnan and Parker
sit across from Milady. Her face
betrays faint doubt,
apprehension. Emotions she is not
used to feeling, let
alone displaying to the world around
her. D'Artagnan sees
his opening... and speaks:
D'ARTAGNAN
The man at the inn... what did
he want?
MILADY
(hollow laugh)
Justice. Honor. Revenge.
D'ARTAGNAN
Why?
MILADY
He is the brother of my late
husband, Lord de Winter. He
blames me for de Winter's death.
He thinks I murdered him.
D'ARTAGNAN
Did you murder your husband,
Milady?
MILADY
What do you think?
A beat. D'Artagnan studies her pale, beautiful face.
Remembers Athos' tale of love and loss.
D'ARTAGNAN
I think he's not the first husband
you killed.
(off her look)
I once knew a man, one of the
Counts of Berry. He told me a
story... of beauty and danger.
He was the bravest man I've ever
known. And the saddest.
MILADY
I know...
The truth strikes home. Milady cannot conceal it. But
she does not react with anger or scorn. D'Artagnan has
reminded her of the one thing in the world that still
touches her heart. D'Artagnan looks at her with a steady
gaze. Milady cannot hold it, she turns to the carriage
window.

The public room is empty, save for d'Artagnan and the

ARAMIS
The treaty outlines Richelieu's
plan to forge an alliance with
Buckingham.
PORTHOS
What about the King?
ARAMIS
He is not mentioned directly. But
the agreement is contingent on a
'demonstration' of the Cardinal's
power.
D'ARTAGNAN
A demonstration? What does that
mean?
ARAMIS
I don't know.
Athos' face grows dark. He has been silent throughout.
Now he rises to his feet.
ATHOS
I know someone who does.
D'Artagnan, Aramis, and Porthos watch in grim silence as
Athos crosses the room to an imposing door.

A fire burns in the grate. Milady sits beside it in a
chair, staring into the glowing embers. Their hot re-
flection dances in her pale blue eyes. There is a KNOCK
at the door. Armand de Winter emerges from a dark corner
of the room where he has been standing guard with an
impassive executioner. He crosses to the door, opens it.
And Athos steps inside.
ATHOS
I'd like a word with your
prisoner.
ARMAND

She dies at dawn.
Athos nods, and steps to Milady, stands before her.
Milady stares at the fire, speaks softly, her eyes on the
flames.

There was a time when I would've
given my life for a kind word.
ATHOS
I could not give it, Sabine.
I was... a fool.
Milady hears the regret in his voice, holds his gaze.
Athos indicates Armand in the corner.
ATHOS
Did you kill his brother and his
father as he says?
MILADY
(a long beat,
honest at the
last)
I have become... the nightmare
you once thought me to be.
ATHOS
But not before. Not us.
MILADY
No. The memory will keep me
company.
Athos kneels at her side, near to pleading:
ATHOS
Do you know the Cardinal's plans?
MILADY
Yes.
ATHOS
Tell me.

Will you spare my life?
ATHOS
I can't.

crimes. Nothing can stop that.
But how you leave this world is
up to you.
Milady offers a half-smile, takes his hand in hers.

A gathering of nobles and ladies, all in full ceremonial
dress. Rochefort is there as well, the familiar eye
patch, in command of the Cardinal's Guards. A Seneschal

The trumpeteers raise their instruments and blow a royal
blast.

ENTRANCE DOORS
138
Louis, Queen Anne, and their retinue enter from a
corridor, proceed slowly across the room toward the
balcony that overlooks the waiting crowd outside.
Noblemen bow, and their ladies curtsy as the King and
Queen pass. Constance, dressed for the occasion, looks
on from the sidelines, smiles. The King and Queen
proceed, two teenagers with the world at the feet.
LOUIS
They look... happy.
ANNE
Hungry, more likely.
LOUIS
Still, you were right about the
celebration. And when the Cardinal
told me how much it meant to you...
ANNE
I said nothing.
LOUIS
But... ?
ANNE
The Cardinal expressed in
confidence how much the celebration
would mean to you...
Both pause to consider the manipulation.

Richelieu stands in an anteroom just off the procession,
he watches the King and Queen as they walk, speaks
quietly, to himself:
RICHELIEU
I'm not sure which is sadder... to
die so young. Or to die a King.
Richelieu turns from the procession. Speaks to Rochefort
who pauses in the shadowy alcove behind him.
RICHELIEU
France will not go wanting. A new
King will sit on the throne. The
true King after all...
He says it quiet fervor, the dream at long last within
reach. Then, as if to reassure:

Louis and Anne continue toward the balcony. Richelieu
trails the royal couple. He nods to Rochefort in
passing. They exchange significant smiles. Anne spots
the smirk on Rochefort's face. He resumes a supplicant
pose. Anne glances back, Richelieu behind them.
ANNE
I do not trust him.
LOUIS
I'm not sure who to trust.
ANNE
Then we will discover the truth
together.
Louis likes the sound of that.
They step side by side
toward the balcony.

Bell ropes, hundreds of feet long, dangle down the
vertiginous shaft. D'Artagnan races up the narrow,

tower. He catches a glimpse of the marksman, back
turned, taking aim.

IN CROWD BELOW

Athos, Porthos, and Aramis push their way through the
crowd, trying desperately to reach the Palace entrance.
But the throng is impenetrable. Athos turns, wonders.
And shoots a worried look at the bell tower of the
Carmes-Deschaux, looming against the sky, as if to intuit
the danger lurking there.
CUT TO:
148
150
D'Artagnan hears the click of the musket's hammer, and
knows he must act now. He
looks around and sees his
chance. D'Artagnan leaps
off the stairs and grabs a
handful of rope, using his weight to RING the BELL
overhead.
CUT TO:
151
153
Pandemonium, inside and outside the Palace. Athos,
Porthos, and Aramis emerge from the crowd at the entrance,
draw their swords, and prepare to rush the long line of
Guards protecting the doors. The Guards cannot believe
what they are seeing. Three men against a hundred. It's
ridiculous. But then... the looks on Guards' faces begin
to change, subtly at first, from amusement to horror.
154
THEIR POV
154
Behind Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, something incredible
happens. Musketeers appear from every direction. Some
from the surrounding crowd. Some from buildings, roof-
tops. Others appear on horseback, a few disguised as
monks. And all defiantly wearing their blue and gold
tunics.
The murmur of the crowd becomes an excited roar. The
corps of Musketeers line up behind Athos, Porthos, and
Aramis. Porthos and Aramis exchange a smile. Athos
keeps his usually dour expression. But his eyes are
charged with excitement. They raise their arms, and
face the long line of Guards. A hundred sabers flash in
the sunlight.
ATHOS
Save the King!!
The Musketeers charge.
It is a glorious sight.
CUT TO:
155
156
Pandemonium reigns. Rochefort instructs his Guards to
close the huge door to the great hall. The members of
the King's royal court run in panicked circles, convinced
the palace is under seige. Constance pauses amid the
riot, seeks the Queen.
But Richelieu has found her first. He steps to Anne,
assumes an air of priestly innocence.
RICHELIEU
Your Majesty...
But Louis steps INTO VIEW, puts a protecting arm around
his wife, speaks stern command:
LOUIS
Leave us... alone.
That's when a loud BOOM rocks the room.
157
ANOTHER ANGLE
157
The great door shudders under the impact of a terrific
blow. Another BOOM and the great hall is plunged into
further chaos. The regiment of Guards rush forward,
press their bodies against the door to secure it.
BOOM -- the great door threatens to split in half.
Richelieu huddles with Rochefort amid the rising panic.
His eyes narrow to mean slits, he gestures toward Louis
and Anne across the room.
RICHELIEU
(a cold whisper)
Kill him. Kill her, too.
Rochefort draws d'Artagnan's sword from its sheath. He
advances on Louis and Anne. Louis has witnessed the
latter, treason confirmed. He raises his own sword,
prepared to protect his Queen. To die for her if
necessary.
LOUIS
(to Anne)
Get behind me.
Rochefort takes confident steps toward the King. But
one last BOOM and the great DOOR comes CRASHING down on
the Guards, revealing a tide of Musketeers on the other
side. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis at the lead.
(CONTINUED)

157

157
Louis breaks into a wide grin. The Musketeers wade into
the Guards, and the great hall is transformed into a bat-
tlefield. Rochefort turns, sees Athos charging at him.
ATHOS
Greetings, Monsieur Cyclops.
Are
we interrupting?
ROCHEFORT
Not for long.
Athos and Rochefort lock swords and duel.
158
BATTLE
158
Musketeers surround Louis and Anne to ward off attack.
But the young King has no intention of being protected.
He wades to the fore, fights side by side with his
Musketeers. Anne watches him with a host of emotions.
Respect, admiration... love. Louis pauses to return her
gaze, then returns to battle.
Constance dashes through the fray. She sees a Guard
slip behind a curtain, approach the Queen. She grabs a
heavy goblet, shouts:
CONSTANCE
Look out!
Anne looks up. Constance tosses the goblet to her. Anne
catches it neatly, brings it down on the head of the
hapless Guard. Constance smiles, leaps forward.
Aramis cuts down a Guard. As another man comes at him
from behind, Porthos intervenes, runs the man through.
The two Musketeers pause to exchange deadpan thanks,
and continue.
Athos and Rochefort slash at each other. It is a mighty
confrontation. But Athos soon gains the upper hand.
Rochefort shouts to a nearby Guard for help. Now it's
two on one. Athos receives a wound in the shoulder, he
staggers... and the treaty falls from his tunic to the
floor. Rochefort reacts with a start, he grabs the
treaty, stuffs it into his doublet. Athos shakes off
the sudden pain, disposes of the Guard. Rochefort and
Athos face each other a second time. Athos wounded,
Rochefort confident he can finish the injured Musketeer.
But Athos merely changes sword hands. Rochefort reacts.
Their SABERS CLASH as they draw together. Rochefort
grabs a dagger from his belt with his free hand. But
Athos sees it coming, and smashes Rochefort across the
face with his fist.

Rochefort goes sprawling. He loses his sword, it slides
across the floor until someone's foot stops it.
Rochefort looks up... and sees d'Artagnan standing on
the blade.
D'ARTAGNAN
This sword belongs to me.
D'Artagnan stoops to pick up his long-lost sword. He
tosses his other saber to Rochefort, who catches it
neatly. Athos watches from a short distance, knows
this moment belongs to d'Artagnan. He will not intervene.
But he shouts:
ARAMIS
D'Artagnan.
Kill him where he
stands.
These are d'Artagnan's words. A son vowing to avenge the
death of his father. D'Artagnan wonders. Rochefort
confirms.
ROCHEFORT
By all means. Let's discover if
you are as brave a man as your
father was. And as foolish.
D'ARTAGNAN
(stunned by the
revelation as it
unfolds)
What...?
ROCHEFORT
He died for his King and for
France. But most of all... he
died on the end of my sword.
(the final curse)
As will you.
Rochefort smiles a taunt.
D'Artagnan raises his sword,
whispers to heaven.
D'ARTAGNAN
This is for you, Father.
Then, eyes blazing, d'Artagnan attacks Rochefort with
everything he's got, driving him into an adjoining
chamber.

A FIRE ROARS in a great stone hearth. Its light pro-

Rochefort duel, slashing at each other.

Athos, Porthos, and Aramis take the fight to the
Cardinal's Guards. Each with his by-now familiar
tradmarks. King Louis fighting beside them.
161
D'ARTAGNAN AND ROCHEFORT
161
They battle before the blazing fire, sweat covers their
faces. Rochefort wears a wolfish grin. But d'Artagnan
has learned his lessons well. He attacks with gusto.
Rochefort's grin soon turns toward desperation. He
cannot match the boy's vengeful steel. So he drives a
knee into d'Artagnan's groin. D'Artagnan falls to the
floor. Rochefort means to finish him there. But
d'Artagnan rolls away from the blade, leaps back to his
feet. Undaunted, he hurls himself at his hated opponent.
Rochefort sidesteps, throws d'Artagnan against a wall.
He pins him there, stunning the youth. And hisses with
superior disdain:
ROCHEFORT
One thing's certain. You're no
Musketeer.
But d'Artagnan remembers Athos' advice. "Always find
your enemy's weakness." He shoves a thumb into
Rochefort's good eye. Rochefort stumbles backward.
D'Artagnan plunges his sword into Monsieur Cyclops's
heart.
D'ARTAGNAN
Take it back...?
ROCHEFORT
I might... have been... mistaken.
Rochefort crumples to the floor, dead. D'Artagnan looks
at Rochefort's blood on his sword. His father's death
finally avenged. That's when he hears the RUSTLE of a
SILKEN ROBE. D'Artagnan pivots, sees Richelieu kneeling
at Rochefort's body... extracting the treaty from his
doublet.
D'ARTAGNAN
No!!
Richelieu smiles,
hurls the treaty into the blazing
fireplace. As the
flames begin to lick at the parchment
paper, d'Artagnan
flies past the Cardinal, and dives
after to retrieve
it.

Athos, Porthos, and Aramis enter the room. D'Artagnan
stumbles out of the fireplace, covered with soot,
clutching the treaty. He grins. ON d'Artagnan's look
of triumph...

A short time later. The battle is over. The Musketeers
have won. On the dais, Louis and Anne confront Richelieu
who is a prisoner now, guarded by several Musketeers.
Louis holds the recovered treaty in his hands.
D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers stand nearby.
RICHELIEU
Your Majesty, that document is an
obvious forgery. I am clearly the
victim of a conspiracy designed
and perpetuated by these three
Musketeers.
Richelieu assumes a trustworthy pose, one familiar to
both King and Queen.
LOUIS
This is a complicated matter,
Your Eminence, affecting both
France and the crown...
A beat. As all wonder if Richelieu will manage to elude
blame after all. But Louis continues with quiet author-
ity, just a trace of humor. As King, and as a man.
LOUIS
And so, until such time as I and
my advisors --
(gestures toward
Anne; the
Musketeers)
-- can determine the whole truth
of the matter. I invite you to
await our decision in the comfort
of... the Bastille.
Musketeers close in around the Cardinal.
He fumes,
protests.
RICHELIEU
You can't do this to me.
I'm the
Cardinal of France.

LOUIS
(never more certain)
And I am its King.
Shouts of "Long live the King!
Long live the King!"
LOUIS
And as King... I hereby reinstate
the Musketeers.
A tremendous cheer is heard from all. Richelieu is led
from the room. He pauses in front of d'Artagnan.
RICHELIEU
Congratulations, Monsieur
d'Artagnan. I'll be keeping an
eye on you.
D'ARTAGNAN
(unphased)
Thank you, Your Eminence.
I'll
be watching you, too.
Richelieu smiles his crocodile smile. Followed by
guards, he turns and strides away, hands clasped behind
his back, scarlet robes billowing behind him.
Louis turns to the Musketeers.
He indicates d'Artagnan.
LOUIS
Is this the young man who saved
my life?
Porthos puts a hand on d'Artagnan's shoulder.
PORTHOS
His name's d'Artagnan, Sire.
LOUIS
Approach, d'Artagnan.
D'Artagnan's heart pounds as he draws closer to King and
Queen. Then he remembers, reaches into his doublet. And
turns to the Queen.
D'ARTAGNAN
I have something that belongs to
... Your Majesty...
D'Artagnan produces the bracelet he found on the country
road. He holds it out to her. The King wonders, the
Queen smiles.

ANNE
Thank you, d'Artagnan. But the
bracelet does not belong to me.
(off his look)
It belongs to her.
Anne indicates Constance, who steps forward, INTO VIEW.
D'Artagnan and Constance lock eyes for the third time.
The thrill of recognition, the promise of romance,
charges between. D'Artagnan slips the bracelet around
her wrist. Constance kisses him on the cheek. Louis
continues:
LOUIS
D'Artagnan, I am in your debt.
What can I do to repay the courage
you've shown me? Anything,
D'Artagnan.
Whatever your heart
desires...
D'Artagnan knows what he wants. But he is tongue-tied,
unable to ask for it. Athos asks for him.
ATHOS
Majesty, his heart has only one
desire. To become a Musketeer.
D'Artagnan looks at Athos, thankful for the intercession.
Louis answers with pleasure.
LOUIS
Then kneel, d'Artagnan.
D'Artagnan drops to his knees. Louis lays the blade of
his sword on each of his shoulders.
LOUIS
The world is an uncertain realm,
filled with danger. Truth
despoiled by broken promises.
Honor undermined by the pursuit
of gold. Freedom sacrificed when
the weak are oppressed by the
strong. But there are those who
oppose these powerful forces.
Those who dedicate their lives to
truth, honor, and freedom. They
are a constant reminder to all of
us. That such a life is not just
possible, but necessary to our
continued survival. As a country,
as a King. These men are known as
the Musketeers...

As Louis speaks, D'Artagnan closes his eyes; countless
images rush through his mind. His home in Gascony,
Constance and Queen Anne on the country road, his first
encounters with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, their
adventures together, the face of Milady. It's been a
busy week.
LOUIS
Rise, d'Artagnan. And join them.
Musketeer.
D'Artagnan stands, transformed from boy to man. BELLS
RING in the distance. Constance smiles brightly, tears
gleam in her eyes. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis surround
their young friend, and happily present him with the
bright blue tunic of the Musketeers. They slip the tunic
over d'Artagnan's head, react with a cheer. D'Artagnan
hugs each of the three. For each has given him gifts
more valuable than gold.
Porthos, Aramis, and last... Athos.
Who, to the surprise
of all who know him... smiles.
PORTHOS
Do my eyes deceive me?
ARAMIS
I find it hard to believe myself.
PORTHOS
His lips, unused as they are to
such a contortion, twisted and
stretched... into a smile.
ARAMIS
It was spectacular. And what
teeth.
D'Artagnan basks in their company, wonders aloud.
D'ARTAGNAN
I know this is a stupid question.
But what exactly does a Musketeer
do?
Porthos and Aramis exchange a glance.
They're not so
sure themselves.
PORTHOS
Truth... honor...
ARAMIS
(helpfully suggests
a third)
And freedom.

The Three Musketeers -- no, make that the four
Musketeers -- raise their swords, and clash blades
together, causing them to give off sparks.
D'ARTAGNAN
All for one...
OTHERS
... And one for all!!
MUSIC SOARS.
The curtain falls.
FADE OUT.
