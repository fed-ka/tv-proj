                    We didn t really have that much 
                    money growing up but we did have a 
                    pool in our back yard and my 
                    brother and I would stay in it all 
                    summer making up dives.  My 
                    signature was the Banana Split and 
                    Dive.                                                                                        5


                                  DR. TODD
                    Sounds fun.

                                  CATHY
                    Except when Sean would hold me 
                    under the water and fart on my 
                    face.  

    She glances down to see that her paper robe is slightly open 
    in the front.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Oh, hello breast.  How long has 
                    that been happening?

                                  DR. TODD
                    I didn t notice.

                                  CATHY
                    Well, screw you.  Anyway, in regard 
                    to your question, I don t think I 
                    want to do that.

                                  DR. TODD
                    Not at all?

                                  CATHY
                    I just have always liked my hair.  
                    I cry every time I get it cut. 

                                  DR. TODD
                    You won t necessarily lose your 
                    hair.

                                  CATHY
                    My nose is another story.  If you 
                    told me I was going to lose my nose-

                    What s this?

                                  DR. TODD
                    Some information on alternative 
                      treatments.

                                  CATHY
                    Oh, crap.  I thought it was a cure.

                                  DR. TODD
                    How does your husband feel?                                                                                      6


                                  CATHY
                    He has a knot in his back from 
                    sleeping weird.  He s using a 
                    heating pad. Is that what you d 
                    recommend? (offDr. Todd s look)  I 
                    haven t told him yet.

    Dr. Todd is clearly taken aback.

                                  DR. TODD
                    I grew up with parents who 
                    perfected the art of talking about 
                    each other in front of each other 
                    but not actually to each other, and 
                    still, you ve shocked me.  

                                  CATHY
                    I m just kind of a private person.  
                    Except around you.  I can t seem to 
                    shut up around you.

                                  DR. TODD
                    Here are some tips on how to tell 
                    your loved ones.  A lot of people 
                    find it difficult.  

                                  CATHY
                    Are you married?

                                  DR. TODD 
                    No.  But I think I d want to know.

                                  CATHY
                    I planned to tell him.  But when I 
                    got home that day, he had trapped a 
                    mouse under a skillet and was 
                    standing there waiting for me to 
                    come do something about it and I 
                    just found myself saying  I need to 
                    be alone for a while.

                                  DR. TODD
                    Some support groups you might be 
                    interested in. 

                                  CATHY
                    I just got an image of when you do 
                    get married, you and your bride 
                    standing at the altar passing 
                    brochures back and forth.                                                                                      7


                                  DR. TODD
                    Don t you think you should be 
                    honest with your family?  

                                  CATHY
                    Honesty is overrated.  White lies 
                    can really keep a marriage 
                    together.  You re single so you 
                    still romanticize the idea of a 
                    symbiotic relationship with no 
                    secrets.

                                  DR. TODD
                    Can you tell your brother?

                                  CATHY
                    I m afraid he d just try to squeeze 
                    in one last attempt to fart on my 
                    face for old times sake.

                                  DR. TODD
                    I don t have a brochure for that.

                                  CATHY
                    Then are we done?

    He hands her a prescription.

                                  DR. TODD
                    As needed for discomfort.  

                                  CATHY
                    Wow.  I should get in touch with my 
                    college boyfriend and see if he 
                    still has his bong.

                                  DR. TODD
                    You don t have to.  You can get it 
                    in cigarettes, tea, cookies, 
                      brownies...

                                  CATHY
                    Can I mix and match?

                                  DR. TODD
                    I believe you can.

                                  CATHY
                    I believe I will.

                                  DR. TODD

                                  CATHY
                    Can I tell you?

    Dr. Todd smiles and exits.  Cathy looks at the prescription 
    in her hand.

                    Cookies, huh?

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      Cathy eats A BIG POT COOKIE as she drives and sings DELTA 
      DAWNalong with the radio.  


      Sean waits calmly next to a trash can as a DAD WITH THREE 
      KIDSapproaches with their garbage.

                                  SEAN
                    I ll take that for you, sir.

                    (confused)  Oh.  Okay, thanks.

    He hands over their trays and exits with his kids.  Sean 
      picks up a half eaten burger and shoves it in his mouth as he 
      joins Cathy at a table.  She has a mountain of food in front 
      her.

                                  CATHY
                    Gross. 

                                  SEAN
                    I know you are.  

                                  CATHY
                    I would have bought you a meal.

                    (re: Cathy s tray)  Besides, I 
                    wouldn t want to take food out of 
                    the mouths of all those tape worms 
                    you re feeding.  

                                  CATHY
                    Never comment on a woman s meal.

                    You ve never been a woman to me, 
                    Cathy. (then)  So what did you want 
                    to tell me?

      Cathy stares at him for a beat.

                                  CATHY
                    You re an asshole.

      Cathy takes a check out of her purse and hands it across the 
      table.

                    Fine.  If you don t want it I ll 
                    keep it.

    She takes the money order back.

                                  SEAN
                    Okay, wait a minute. So you want me 
                    to have it as long as I do what you 
                    want me to do with it.

                    I want you to be happy.

                                  SEAN
                    No, YOU want to be happy and you 
                    think this will do it for you.  
                    This isn t about me.  I mfriggin  
                    ecstatic.  I wish you knew what 
                    that felt like.

                                  CATHY
                    What does that mean?  You don t 
                    think I m happy?

                    eight out of the ten times I saw 
                    you last year all you could talk 
                    about was whether you were going to 
                    buy a couch from Crate and Barrel 
                    or Pottery Farm--

                    Like I care.  One was cheaper but 
                    the other one had a nicer fabric 
                    and ultimately you decided to stick 
                    with the one you already had 
                    because it s a safe neutral with a 
                    few good years still left in it and 
                    the cushions are reversible so if 
                    you turned them over you really 
                    couldn t see that stain.  Oh God am 
                    I glad you worked through that!  
                    Meanwhile, I still close my eyes at 
                    night and see color swatches with 
                    names like Harvest Light and 
                    Crimson Rose!   

                                  CATHY
                    That doesn t mean I m not happy.

                                  SEAN
                    Oh, good, then you re just really 
                    fucking boring. 

                                  CATHY
                    Well, at least I don t smell like 
                    feet.

                                  SEAN
                    I know you re embarrassed of me, 
                    Cathy.  You don t have to make 
                    little jabs about it because they 
                    hurt you more than they do me.  But 
                    I m embarrassed of you, too.  
                    Because somewhere along the way my 
                    fun, interesting, kooky sister got 
                    boring.  And even more than 
                      embarrassed that makes me sad.

      Cathy is speechless as she takes this in. Suddenly, Sean 
      jumps up and cuts off a GUY HEADED TO THE TRASH.  Sean takes 
    a drink out of his hand.   

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    May I have this if you re just 
                    going to throw it away?

    The guy hands it over as Cathy quietly passes them and exits.


      Cathy stares at Paul as the WAITRESS writes on her pad.                                                                                    13


                                  WAITRESS
                    Great.  I ll be right back with 
                    those drinks.

    She exits.  Paul looks through the menu.

                                  PAUL
                    I m craving pasta but I also love 
                    their chicken so if you were going 
                    to get pasta, maybe I ll get the 
                    chicken so we can share--

      Paul looks up to see Cathy staring at him.

                                  PAUL (CONT D)
                    What?  I know you wanted to tell me 
                    something but I thought we d order 
                      first--unlessyou want to tell me 
                    now.

                                  CATHY
                    I wanted a new couch because you 
                    spilled fruit punch while you were 
                    bouncing on the cushions.

                                  PAUL
                    Not bouncing.  Dancing.  Do you 
                    want me to just order for both of 
                    us?  

                                  CATHY
                    What forty year old man dances on a 
                    couch sober?

                                  PAUL
                    I can t be the only one.

                                  CATHY
                    And now I have to reverse the 
                    cushions to hide the stain and I 
                    used to lie awake at night upset 
                    about that because even though you 
                    couldn t see the stains I knew they 
                    were there.

                                  PAUL
                    I told you to go ahead and pick out 
                    a new couch.

                                  CATHY
                    I don t want to be the one who 
                    picks out the new couch.  I want to 
                    be the one who spills the Fruit 
                    Punch.                                                                                    14


                                  PAUL
                    You re not the Fruit Punch type.

                                  CATHY
                    Because I read that high fructose 
                    corn syrup is so bad for you.  
                    (then) Do you think I m boring? 

                                  PAUL
                          (hesitant)
                    Just tell me how to get back in the 
                    house.  

                                  CATHY
                    You do.  You think I m boring.

                                  PAUL
                    It s not a bad thing.  It s just 
                    the way our personalities break 
                    down.  I like to do fun things and 
                    you like to do things that some, 
                    let s say a majority people might, 
                    if they were forced to categorize 
                    them, might consider boring.

                                  CATHY
                    Like what?

                                  PAUL
                    Like clean and organize. 

                                  CATHY
                    That s what I like to do?

                                  PAUL
                    You live for it.

                                  CATHY
                          (getting angry)
                    I tried to be the fun one.  I 
                    wanted to buy the house with the 
                    pool so I could teach Adam the 
                    Banana Split and Dive but you 
                    wanted to be closer to your job so 
                    you could Vespa to work.

                                  PAUL
                    You said that was probably a better 
                    idea because so many people die in 
                    pools.                                                                                    15


                                  CATHY
                    People die everywhere.  I said it 
                    was a better idea because you threw 
                    a tantrum in front of our realtor.  

                                  PAUL
                    I made my point in an emotional 
                    way, sure.

                                  CATHY
                    You made your point in a childish 
                    way.  

                                  PAUL
                          (getting annoyed)
                    Well, it s hard not to act like a 
                    kid when every time we leave the 
                    house you ask me if I need to pee.  

                                  CATHY
                    Well it s hard not to treat you 
                    like a child when every time I make 
                    you a sandwich you ask me to cut 
                    the crusts off your bread.

                                  PAUL
                    Oh sue me.  I love a crustless
                    sandwich.

                                  CATHY
                    Well, I love onions but I haven t 
                    been able to eat them for five 
                    years because you say they re 
                    stinky poopoo.And now Adam 
                    doesn t like onions and he s never 
                    even tried them.

                                  PAUL
                    They are stinky poopoo.Stinky 
                    poopooyuck yuck!(laughing; 
                    then)  Come on, Cathy, am I really 
                    sleeping at my sister s because you 
                    want to start cooking with onions?

                                  CATHY
                    Yes, Paul. That s it.  I want 
                    onions to be a major part of my 
                    life in the next year.   

                                  PAUL
                    Well, first of all, you re whacked 
                    and second of all, I hope you feel 
                    better because I feel like shit.                                                                                    16


    The Waitress returns with drinks.

                                  WAITRESS
                    Are you ready to order?

                                  CATHY
                    I m just doing desserts.


    She enters the dark house and turns on a light.  As she does,  
      someone, out of nowhere, screams and jumps on top of her.

                                  MUFFLED MALE VOICE
                    Your money or your life!

      Cathy yells and flails and runs into the corner of the room.

                                  CATHY
                    Don t kill me don t kill me don t 
                    kill me!  Jewelry s in the bedroom!  
                    I have a child!

      Laughter.

                                  MALE VOICE
                    Hey, Mom.  Did you miss me?

      ADAM, CATHY AND PAUL S THIRTEEN YEAR OLD SON (GOING ON EIGHT)
      turns on another light.

                                  CATHY
                    Adam!   I told you!  Stop doing 
                    that!  Stop it stop it stop it!  
                    That s not funny!

                                  ADAM
                    It was kind of funny from this 
                    side.  Awman, I should have taped 
                    it.  I could send it in and win 
                    something.  Aw, man.

                                  CATHY
                    Why are you home?  

                                  ADAM
                    Brent s parents just drove really 
                    fast.  Some vacation.  They fought 
                    the whole time.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    17

                                  ADAM (CONT'D)
                    Brent thinks they re going to get a 
                    divorce.  He s all, fine, twice the 
                    stuff.

                                  CATHY
                    Why didn t you call and tell me you 
                    were coming?

                                  ADAM
                    I didn t think of it.  We taped a 
                    bunch of their fights.  Brent s 
                    going to make a documentary about 
                    his life.

      Cathy shakes her head in bewilderment.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Where s Dad?

                                  CATHY
                    Um...he s staying at Aunt Lisa s.

                                  ADAM
                    Why?  

                                  CATHY
                    We re just--sometimesadults just 
                    need a little breathing space. 

                                  ADAM
                    Jesus, what did you do?  

                                  CATHY
                    What does that mean?  And don t say 
                    Jesus. 

                                  ADAM
                    Jesus.  Are you getting a divorce, 
                    too?  

                                  CATHY
                    Honey, it s going to be fine.  
                    We re building a deck on the house 
                    with a hot tub so you and your 
                    friends--

                                  ADAM
                    I don t like hot tubs.

                                  CATHY
                    You don t?                                                                                    18


                                  ADAM
                    You said they re like sitting in a 
                      petriedish, everybody s germs 
                    crawling up in your butthole. 

                                  CATHY
                    I m pretty sure I didn t say 
                    butthole.(then)  But speaking of 
                    butthole, what s that smell?

    She tracks the smell over to his duffel bag.  

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    What s in there?

                                  ADAM
                    I don t now.  My clothes.

                                  CATHY
                    You were gone a month, they didn t 
                    have a place for you to do laundry?  

                                  ADAM
                    They said something about it.  But 
                    I didn t see anything.  

                                  CATHY
                    You re tired.  Go to bed.

                                  ADAM
                    Geez.

    He goes to his room.  Cathy opens his duffel bag and gags.


      Cathy sits at her desk eating a POT BROWNIE.She s shops 
      online at her computer looking at CAMPING EQUIPMENT, TENTS, 
      SLEEPING BAGS, ETC. The high school students sit at their 
      desks staring at her, confused.  

                                  STUDENT
                    Are you going to teach us anything 
                    today?

      Beat.  Cathy looks up at them.  

                                  CATHY
                    Have I ever taught you anything?  
                    Really?  This is summer school so I 
                    guess the answer is obvious. 

    She gets a DVD out of a file cabinet and holds it up.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Anybody ever seen The Patriot?

                                  STUDENT 2
                    I think I saw that.  Oh, wait, no.

    She puts the DVD into the player.

                                  CATHY
                    It s depiction of the American 
                    Revolution is about twenty per cent 
                    accurate at best but if you 
                    understood this version as truth 
                    you d still know more about that 
                    time in history than ninety nine 
                    per cent of Americans.  And Mel 
                    Gibson is medium good.  Enjoy.

    She presses play as the door opens and her OVERWEIGHT STUDENT 
      ANDREA ENTERS.Andrea has a tough, don t mess with me 
      attitude about her and the size to back to up.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    You re late again, Andrea.

                                  ANDREA
                    Yeah, sorry about that.  But I 
                    figured that since you usually 
                    spend the first ten minutes of 
                    every class trying to get to your 
                    point, I probably didn t miss 
                    anything.                                                                                    21


      Andrea launches into a dead on impression of Cathy saying a 
      series of  I m sorry  that has the class in stitches. 

                                  CATHY
                    Funny.  Come get your test.

      While the class fixates on Mel Gibson, Andrea meets Cathy at 
    her desk.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                          (Soto)
                    You can t be fat AND mean, Andrea.

                                  ANDREA
                          (taken aback)
                    What?

                                  CATHY
                    You heard me.  If you can dish it 
                    out you gotta be ready to lick it 
                    up.  Fat people are jolly for a 
                    reason.  Fat repels people but joy 
                    attracts them.  Get it?  I know 
                    these people are laughing at your 
                    cruel jokes but nobody s asking you 
                    to prom.  So you can either be fat 
                    and joyous or a skinny bitch.  It s 
                    up to you.  I know what I d choose.    

      Andrea just stares at her in shocked silence.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Sit down.  We re watching a movie.

      Andrea sits.  Cathy goes back to her online shopping.  She 
      pulls up a picture of a sleeping bag.  She reaches for a pen 
      when something outside catches her eye.  She looks out the 
      window and has to turn her head to see PAUL standing up 
      against the side of the school, staring at her with puppy dog 
      eyes that are pouring with tears as he eats a GIANT RED ONION 
      like an apple.  Cathy breaks into a smile and immediately 
      exits her class.


      Cathy heads down the empty hallway toward the exit.

                                  PAUL
                    Wanna bite?  

    She turns to see Paul, still eating the onion, standing in an 
      empty classroom.                                                                                      22


                                  CATHY
                    You re a freak.

                                  PAUL
                    Uh huh.

    He takes a bite.

                                  CATHY
                    Stop that!  I get it.

    She takes the onion away and he pulls her to him.


                                  PAUL
                    Please kiss my big onion mouth.

                                  CATHY
                    Oooh, no.

                                  PAUL
                    See, they re stinky, aren t they?  
                    Admit it.

      They kiss.

                                  CATHY
                          (through kisses; laughing)
                    They are.  They re stinky poopoo
                    yuck yuck.

                                  PAUL
                          (spitting out onion)
                    It s going to be all about you now 
                    Cathy.  For as long as it takes, 
                    forever, it s all about you.

    He shuts the door and locks it and kisses her neck.

                                  CATHY
                    I m at school.

                                  PAUL
                    Good.  I m going to teach you 
                    something.  How to have fun. 

    He sits her on the teacher s desk and kisses down her body as 
    we FADE OUT.


      Freshly showered, hair still wet and in a robe, Cathy is in 
    the kitchen cutting up vegetables when Adam enters.  

                                  ADAM
                    I m starving my face off.

                                  CATHY
                    Help me cut.  I m making chili.  
                    Your favorite.   

                                  ADAM
                    Chili s not my favorite anymore.  
                    We had sushi on vacation.  It was 
                    awesome.  

    She hands him a knife and some carrots.  He wields the knife 
      around in a figure eight.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                          (weird voice)
                    I am a warrior.  This is my weapon.    
                    I will teach you many things.

                                  CATHY
                    Dad s coming over for dinner.    

                                  ADAM
                    Ew.Are you guys dating now?                                                                                      25


                                  CATHY
                    Adam, everything s going to be 
                    okay.  We all love each other and 
                    that s what matters.

      Suddenly Adam screams and grabs his hand.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    What s wrong?

                                  ADAM
                    I cut my damn finger off!  Oh my 
                    Jesus!  I cut it off!  

      Cathy looks at the cutting board and sees the SLIGHTLY BLOODY 
      FINGER TIP.  She flies into action, handing Adam a tea towel 
    and grabbing ice from the freezer.

                                  CATHY
                    Hold your finger tight with this.  
                    Get in the car.  I ll put the tip 
                    on ice and they can sew it at the 
                    hospital!  Go go go!

    She puts the finger in a baggy with ice and heads out the 
      door.  Beat.  She re-enters and stares at Adam who is 
      laughing his head off and holds up his finger--intact.She 
      looks at the rubber finger in the baggy, then throws the 
      whole thing at him.  

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    That wasn t funny.

                                  ADAM
                    Let s take a vote.

                                  CATHY
                    We re going to discuss your 
                    punishment with your dad at dinner 
                    tonight.

                                  ADAM
                    I don t want to be a third wheel on 
                    your stupid date.  

      Cathy walks into the bathroom, then comes right back out.

                                  CATHY
                    Did you not flush the toilet?

                                  ADAM
                    It won t flush.                                                                                    26


                                  CATHY
                    Did you try to plunge it?

                                  ADAM
                    No.

                                  CATHY
                    Well, plunge it.

                                  ADAM
                    You plunge it.  I m going to eat at 
                    Brent s.  

    He exits.  Cathy stares after him.  Suddenly she hears 
      sirens.



    She sees the old woman sitting in front of the TV. As Cathy 
      crosses the threshold into the living room, she trips on the 
      basset hound lying there.

                                  CATHY
                          (to dog)
                    Oh, God!  Are you okay?

                                  OLD WOMAN
                    You can t just walk into my house.

                                  CATHY
                    You have no idea what I can do.

                                  OLD WOMAN
                    You re a pain in the ass.

                                  CATHY
                    You re a fucking cunt. 

                                  OLD WOMAN
                    Get out.

                                  CATHY
                    You have never said hello to me, 
                    you have never even smiled even a 
                    little bit.  You sit out there 
                    scowling at everybody who goes by 
                    in your run down house that looks 
                    like shit and smells like chicken 
                    that you fried twenty three years 
                    ago.  And then I do one small 
                    construction project, and you have 
                    to go behind my back...(getting 
                    suddenly emotional) And I really 
                    wanted to teach my son the Banana 
                    Split and Dive and I have very 
                    little time left...because summer 
                    in Minneapolis isn t very long.  
                    It s here and then it s over.  It s 
                    just over.  And that makes me so 
                    fucking mad I can t even tell you!  

      Beat.  She turns to go and trips over the dog again.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Oh God!  I am sooosorry!                                                                                    28


                                  OLD WOMAN
                    My husband built this house. 

      This gets Cathy s attention and she turns back.

                                  OLD WOMAN (CONT D)
                    And he just loved puttering around, 
                    putting a new coat of paint on this 
                    or that and working in the yard.  I 
                    accused him of loving that lawn 
                    more than me once. 

                                  CATHY
                    Let me guess--

                                  OLD WOMAN
                    --he died five years ago.  And all 
                    my friends are dead.  So I just sit 
                    out there and wait until I can see 
                    them again.  Sorry I m not in a 
                    better mood.  

      Beat.

                                  CATHY
                    Well, if you think you re going to 
                    be waiting at least another day 
                    then do your neighbors a favor and 
                    mow your fucking grass.

      Cathy exits.


      Cathy gets the first aid kit and tends to Paul s knee.                                                                                     29


                                  PAUL
                    Do you remember Angel from work?

                                  CATHY
                    Yep.

                                  PAUL
                    He got engaged to that girl who we 
                    met at that party and she made that 
                    snotty face when you talked to her 
                    that made you feel like you had bad 
                    breath.  I took him out for a drink 
                    to celebrate but then the game was 
                    on and it was really close so I 
                    stayed til the end. (re: knee)  On 
                    behalf of all the soldiers, thank 
                    you so much Mrs. Nightingale.  
                    Where s Adam?

                                  CATHY
                    Doing his charity work.

                                  PAUL
                    That s nice.

      SFX. The PHONE RINGS.  Cathy puts the first aid kit away and 
      let s the machine get it.  

                                  PAUL (CONT D)
                    What charity is it again?  

                                  DR. TODD (V.O.)
                    Hi Cathy, it s Dr...Smilovic.Dr. 
                    ...Todd.  It s Todd.  This isn t 
                    business it s, just personal.  
                    Anyway, I was thinking 
                      about...you...  I can t seem to 
                    stop thinking about you actually.  
                    If I m being honest.  I know you go 
                    either way on honesty (he 
                    chuckles)... Anyway, I want to make 
                    sure you have my cell number--

                                  PAUL
                            (suspicious)
                    Who s that?

                                  CATHY
                    I ve been meaning to talk to you 
                    about something--

                                  PAUL
                    Are you fucking kidding me?  So 
                    this is why you need your space?  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    30

                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                    But what, you want to see if it 
                    works out before you let me go 
                      completely?  What, a computer geek
                    with a heart of gold doesn t do it 
                    for you anymore?  What kind of fun 
                    were you really looking for, Cathy?  
                    Trips to the Riviera?  Well, am I 
                    right?  (beat; emotional)  Are you 
                    having an affair?   

    She doesn t respond.

                                  PAUL (CONT D)
                    I need to be alone for a while.

    He grabs his jacket and exits.  She stares after him for a 
      moment, then turns to the phone and plays Dr. Todd s message 
      again. 


      Cathy presses play on another Mel Gibson movie.  

                                  STUDENT
                    Wow.  This went from being my least 
                    favorite class to my most favorite.

                                  CATHY
                    Oh, good.  Another dream came true 
                    for me this week.

      Cathy takes something out of her desk drawer and leaves the 
      classroom.


      Through a series of DISSOLVES we see Cathy at home.

      *She smokes a pot cigarette and watches a funny movie.                                                                                    36


      *She puts a stack of hundred dollar bills into an envelope 
    and labels it  Andrea .

      *She writes something on a Post It and sticks it to the front 
      door.  


      Paul pulls up to Cathy s house with Adam.  Adam is in the 
      passenger seat playing a video game on an iphone.

                                  PAUL
                    It doesn t matter if I m at work, 
                    any time of day, call me whenever 
                    you want to.  Call me when we re 
                    together if you want to.  Call me 
                    right now. 

      Adam ignores him and continues to play the game.

                                  PAUL (CONT D)
                    It s a phone, too, you know.

                                  ADAM
                    I know.

      Adam gets out of the car and heads to the house.

                                  PAUL
                    I love you, buddy.

      Adam ignores him and heads to the house.  


    The house is mostly dark.

                                  ADAM
                    Mom!  (beat)  Mom!

    He glances in the kitchen.  Not there.  He sees the light on 
    in the bathroom and the door half open.  He opens the door 
      completely and looks in.


    In the brightly lit bathroom, Cathy is lying in the bathtub, 
      filled with water bright red with blood.                                                                                      37


    One arm hangs over the tub revealing a slit wrist and the 
      blood from that wound drips onto the floor.  

                                  ADAM
                          (in shock; Sotto)
                    Mom?  Mom?

      Adam goes ballistic.  He starts screaming like a lady and 
      running in panicked circles.  He looks for the phone, but 
      it s not on it s base.  He starts to run out the front door 
      when Cathy, in a robe, appears at the bathroom door.

                                  CATHY
                    Why aren t you laughing?

      This stops Adam.  Then he instantly goes ballistic again.

                                  ADAM
                    No!  No!  No way!  You suck!  You 
                    suck!  You suck!

    She grabs him and pushes him against the wall.

                                  CATHY
                    Someday I am going to be dead and 
                    as a courtesy to the world, I don t 
                    want to leave them the guy who 
                    doesn t know how to get his shitto 
                    flush.  And let me be clear, your 
                    dad isn t living here because I 
                    only wanted to raise one kid, and I 
                    chose you.  So from now on, I m 
                    going to raise you so hard your 
                    head s going to spin.  Now come 
                    here.

    She pulls him into the bathroom where she has a crock pot of 
    the leftover chili sitting in the sink.  She dumps its 
      contents into the toilet.  

                                  ADAM
                    What are you doing?  

                                  CATHY
                    Sorry it s not sushi.

    She hands him the plunger.  

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    The instructions are in the name.  
                      (enunciating) PLUNGE-HER.

    She exits the bathroom and holds the door shut.                                                                                    38


                                  ADAM (O.S.)
                    Let me out!

    She pulls a heavy trunk in front of the door.  She then 
      notices Adam s iphone.  

                                  CATHY
                    Where did you get this phone?

                                  ADAM (O.S.)
                    Dad bought it for me.

                                  CATHY
                    Yeah, I don t think so.

    She takes the phone with her and exits.
