It is winter in Ohio. A house sits isolated beside a barren
field. The field stretches beyond, until a line of distant
woods stops it. Around the back of the house stands a rundown
STORAGE SHED, a cold house, a privy and a water pump. A porch
with a single door serves as the only entrance.
Camera begins a slow move toward the house as we;
SUPER - OHIO, 1865
WE HEAR SOUNDS from inside the house - BUMPS, A CHAIR FALLING
OVER...and FEET RUNNING on wooden floor boards.
CUT TO:
THE VOICE OF SETHE HUMMING A MELODY carries over the images
of:
The two boys running for their lives towards the train,
holding hands all the way.
Howard is the first to reach it.
As it passes by, he throws his bag upon it and jumps in.
Bulgar races beside it as Howard reaches for him.
C.U. - HOWARD'S HAND reaching for BULGAR's...They connect.
WIDE SHOT - The boys are on the train as it leaves town.
On it's route, the train passes a ramshackle GRAVEYARD.
CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY INTO THE GRAVEYARD until it reaches A
HEADSTONE, made with flecked pink stone. Upon the headstone
is only one word:
BELOVED.
Camera moves slowly towards the side exterior of 124, into a
Close-Up of a WOMAN looking out of a second floor bedroom
window. It is SETHE, mother of the two boys and Denver. She
hums her melody, softly, sadly, with a resigned understanding
of why her boys are running away...and a deep pain that is
too constant to notice.
FADE OUT;
FADE IN:
Denver is playing in the front yard by herself.
Sethe is pumping water into a bucket for clothes washing. A
gentle breeze carries a LEAF into the bucket. Sethe sees it
floating atop the water for a moment, then picks it up.
C.U. of SETHE as the image triggers a feeling - and the
feeling a memory - from long ago.
Sethe looks around her and finds she is no longer standing in
the barren field of 124...but rather-
MEMORY;
A stunning vista of the plantation SWEET HOME - sun beating
down on groves and rows of gorgeous sycamores for as far as
the eye can see. Sethe's figure dwarfed by the majestic
landscape.
Sethe looks frightened. Her breathing grows shallow. She
hears something;
THE SOUND OF A WAGON'S WHEELS - rolling over a road, growing
louder, coming towards her
INTERCUT;
C.U. OF A WAGON WHEEL MOVING RAPIDLY ON A ROAD. CAMERA PANS
UP TO THE MAN DRIVING THE WAGON - A STERN WHITE MAN WEARING A
DISTINCTIVE HAT...
SETHE TURNS away from the sycamores towards the road to see;
END OF MEMORY;
A MAN driving a horse and wagon with two children in the
back, coming up Bluestone Road. He wears no hat.
Sethe breathes easily. She looks around her -the reality of
124's barren field has returned. The memory of Sweet Home's
sycamores have vanished.
Denver is playing near the road. As the wagon nears 124,
Denver looks up and smiles. The Man whips the horse hard so
as to ride past the house faster. The children stare at
Denver and 124, with horror and curiosity.
The stares of the children destroy Denver's smile. She
watches them go, then turns to hide her upset and sees her
mother watching her.
Sethe looks to Denver with empathy and impotence: wanting to
ease her daughter's pain and knowing full well she cannot.
Hurt and angry, Denver runs past Sethe, towards the woods.
Denver runs with a purpose, knowing exactly where she is
going.
She reaches FIVE BOXWOOD BUSHES planted in a ring. The tall
bushes stretch toward each other four feet off the ground,
forming a round, emerald room in the center, seven feet high,
with walls fifty inches thick of murmuring leaves.
This is Denver's private place. She bends low and crawls
through the leaves into the center. Once there, this lonely
child wipes away her tears and tries to pull herself
together. She lays her face against the cool earth.
C.U. - PAUL D. GARNER.
Paul stands on the road, gazing up at the house. Grateful
he's arrived, cautious about what he'll find, he steps
towards the porch. His clothes are ragged. His feet sore and
blistering in his shoes.
Off to the side of the house, Sethe washes her feet and legs
at the pump. She looks up and sees Paul's figure walking
towards the house. The sun blazes in her eyes. She can't make
out who it is, or whether or not he's even real. As he
reaches the porch, Paul disappears from view.
Sethe walks towards the front of the house. When she is
little more than forty feet away, she stops - still not
certain Paul is a real man or an hallucination of the past.
SETHE
Paul? Paul D.? Is that you?
PAUL
(smiles)
What's left.
(He rises)
How you been girl, besides barefoot?
Sethe jams her balled up stockings into her pocket. She
smiles like a little girl, not able to believe her eyes.
SETHE
You looking good.
PAUL
Devil's confusion. He lets me look good
long as I feel bad.
SETHE
How long has it been?
PAUL
'Bout eighteen years, I figure.
SETHE
Eighteen years.
PAUL
And I swear I been walking every one of
them. Mind if I join you?
He begins taking off his shoes.
SETHE
You want to soak them? Let me get you
some water.
PAUL
No, uh, uh. Can't baby feet. A whole more
tramping they got to do yet.
SETHE
You're not leaving right away, are you?
You stay awhile.
PAUL
Well, long enough to see Baby Suggs,
you..Where is she?
SETHE
Dead.
PAUL
Aw no. When?
SETHE
Eight years now. Almost nine.
PAUL
Was it hard? I hope she didn't die hard.
SETHE
Soft as cream. Being alive was the hard
part. Sorry you missed her though. Is
that what you came by for?
PAUL
That's some of what I came for. The rest
is you.
Sethe doesn't know what to do with her eyes when he says
this..she looks away instinctively. Paul realizes that may
have sounded too intimate so he leans back and sighs:
PAUL
The truth be known, I go anywhere these
days. Anywhere they let me sit down.
SETHE
Come on inside.
PAUL
Porch is fine. Cool out here. Sit with
me.
Like a nervous little girl, Sethe takes a sit beside a man
for the first time in years, folding her sweat stained skirt
beneath her.
PAUL
So Baby Suggs is gone. Somehow never
thought death would find her.
SETHE
It finds everyone.
PAUL
We managed well enough without meeting
it.
SETHE
I suppose.
Awkward pause. Sethe tries to find the words to a difficult
question - but one that is foremost in her mind;
SETHE
I wouldn't have to ask about him, would
I?...You'd tell me if there was anything
to tell, wouldn't you?
Paul knows instantly she is asking about Halle.
PAUL
You know I would. But I don't know any
more about what happened to Halle now
than I did then.
Something about Paul's expression might suggest he's keeping
something from her. He turns his gaze outward as he says;
PAUL
You must think he's still alive.
SETHE
No. I think he's dead. It's just not
being sure that keeps him alive.
PAUL
What did Baby Suggs think?
SETHE
Same. Ha, listen to her, all her children
dead and she felt each one go the very
day and hour it happened.
PAUL
When she say Halle went?
SETHE
1855. Same day my baby was born.
PAUL
You had that baby, did you? Damn, never
thought you'd make it. Running off
pregnant.
SETHE
Had to. Couldn't be no waiting.
PAUL
All by yourself too.
SETHE
Almost. A white girl helped me.
PAUL
Then she helped herself, God bless her.
Awkward silence.
SETHE
We got spare rooms. You could stay the
night, if you had a mind to.
PAUL
You don't sound too steady in the offer.
SETHE
Oh it's..it's truly meant. I just hope
you'll pardon my house.
Paul smiles a warm, touched smile that after all that they've
survived, Sethe is worried about what he'll think of her
home.
PAUL
My house. I like the sound of that.
Sethe smiles, then rises to escort him in.
A shirtless Paul D. is by the water pump washing himself.
Denver sits on the porch steps, alone once again. Miserably
eating the biscuit and jelly off of a half broken plate.
A brilliant bright yellow and green corn stalks in a tiny
corn field.
Sethe and a slightly older HALLE - handsome, strong - run
through the field until Halle stops them at an isolated spot.
HALLE
How's this?
SETHE
Here?! out in the open?!
HALLE
Look around - can you see anybody?
Sethe looks and can see nothing through the corn stalks. She
shakes her head no.
HALLE
Then nothing can see us neither.
He takes off his shirt. Seethe giggles as she gets on the
ground, keeping her ankles crossed.
Halle lays her back and gently separates her legs. She
giggles. Halle pauses before laying on top of her.
HALLE
You are a beautiful sight.
SETHE
Don't talk stupid.
HALLE
You're my wife now! I can talk as stupid
as I like about you!
(she giggles)
I ain't never loved nothing like you
before, Sethe.
(Sethe is moved)
And after I get mama out...then I get us
out too. And you'll see, baby girl...
(smiles)
we're gonna have us a liiife..
He sings the word "life", so that Sethe laughs. Then, Halle
lowers himself slowly to her and they begin to make love. As
camera pans up to a HILL above the field, we hear Sethe ask;
SETHE (O.S.)
You sure nobody can see?
We hear Halle grunt "uh-huh" as we arrive on the hill where a
GREAT TREE sits.
Beneath the tree, PAUL D, SIXO and Paul's brothers Paul A.
and Paul P. are pouring water over heads and watching;
POV; Unbeknownst to Halle and Sethe, their lovemaking is in
clear view to anyone on the hill...
PAUL A
Damn. I don't get why she picked him.
PAUL D
Halle's got that way about him. That way
a woman feels he's doing it all for her,
not for himself at all.
PAUL A
I can't see nothing so special about Halle.
PAUL F
What about what he's doing for his mama?
PAUL A
Fool thing, if you ask me. By the time he
buys it, freedom won't mean a thing to
somebody that old and worn.
SIXO
Freedom mean something anytime it come.
The men watch the corn stalks swaying to the lovemaking.
A YOUNG PAUL D., in particular, watches with tender yearning.
We see the house now. No creaking or sounds of breaking
furniture. Just the sound of Paul D. singing.
Paul and Sethe sit on the porch together. Sethe is sewing.
Paul nervously gets up his nerve to ask:
PAUL
Sethe.
(she stops and looks)
I was thinking of looking for work around
here. What do you think?
SETHE
Ain't much. River mostly. And hogs.
PAUL
Hogs is fine.
Paul moves to where Sethe is sitting.
PAUL
I don't need much, Sethe. Eat, sleep,
sing a little when it strikes me. I don't
ask for more to..to live somewhere.
Sethe realizes what he is asking and tentatively responds:
SETHE
All right. It's...it's fine with me.
PAUL
Your girl Denver. Seems she's of a
different mind.
SETHE
Don't worry about her. She's a charmed
child. Nothing ever touch her too bad.
From the beginning. Everybody I knew dead
or gone, but not her.
(pause)
You got to know something, though - this
here ain't no better life. It's just not
that other one. What I do here - all I
ever do - is keep Denver from that
other..So if you stay, there's no more
talk about Sweet Home or anything else. I
won't let the past in my yard again.
Getting me and Denver through this here
life is all that matters. You understand?
PAUL
Dangerous to love anything that much,
Sethe. Best thing is to love everything
just a little bit..that way, when it
breaks or runs off or gets taken, well
maybe you'd have a little love left over
for the next one.
SETHE
Don't be asking me to choose, Paul D.
There ain't no choice here.
PAUL
That's the whole point. I'm not asking
you to choose. Just want to know if
there's some space for me. Want to know
if it's more than "you can stay", "it's
fine"..more like, "I want you here Paul".
Beat. Sethe is frightened by the prospect of feeling for him.
SETHE
Maybe we should leave things the way they
are.
Sethe rises to enter the house when Paul's words stop her:
PAUL
How are they?
SETHE
We get along.
PAUL
What about inside?
SETHE
I don't go inside.
PAUL
Sethe, if I'm here with you, with Denver,
you can go anywhere you want. Jump, if
you want to, 'cause I'll catch you. Go as
far inside as you need - I'll hold your
ankles. Make sure you get back out. I'm
not saying this because I need a place to
stay. I told you, I'm a walking man, but
I been heading in this direction for
seven years. When I got here and sat out
there on the porch, waiting for you,
well, I knew it wasn't the place I was
heading toward. It was you. We can make a
life girl. A life.
SETHE
(scared)
I don't know. I don't know.
PAUL
Leave it to me. See how it goes. No
promises, if you don't want to make any.
Just see how it goes, all right?
Sethe's heart is twisted. She wants to cry...because she
feels hope...and because she feels fear.
SETHE
All right. We'll see how it goes.
PAUL
You willing to leave it to me?
SETHE
Well..some of it.
PAUL
(smiles)
Some?...Well okay...some.
Sethe manages a smile.
Paul and Sethe and Denver walk among the hundreds of black
townspeople gathered for the carnival.
A sign reads COLORED THURSDAY...TWO PENNIES ENTRANCE FEE.
Paul is in high spirits. Saying hello to anyone whose eye he
catches. Willing, eager to get anything for Denver she wants.
Feeling a little more like a normal van in a normal life.
Denver is excited but worried. She doesn't want to like Paul
but can't help the thrill she's feeling. And when one or two
passersby shout out;
VARIOUS PASSERS-
BY
Hey Denver!...Hi there Denver!
Denver heart almost weeps with joy.
Sethe walks cautiously. Overdressed for the occasion, it is
her first outing among neighborhood folk in many years.
She catches the eyes of some of the women she knows...ELLA
and LADY JONES..good Christian women who nod in their
acknowledgement yet are holding back something. A judgement?
A repulsion?
Paul doesn't notice them and for this Sethe is glad.
MONTAGE of SCENES...the various carnival acts, all performed
by a WHITE TROUPE; magic, clowning, fire swallowing, spitting
ribbons, acrobats forming pyramids...
Our trio take it all in like water to the thirsty.
At one point, A WHITE CARNIVAL BARKER shouts to the children;
CARNIVAL BARKER
All Pickaninnies free!!
The phrase stabs Sethe and Paul a bit. But Paul whispers;
PAUL
Two pennies and an insult well spent in
my opinion to see the spectacle of
whitefolks making a spectacle of
themselves.
Sethe can't help but let out a small laugh - and with that
laugh, a sudden sensation of relief...
Paul buys Denver some licorice, peppermint and lemonade.
Holding the lemonade for her, Paul asks;
PAUL
Mind if I take a sip?
Denver agrees. Paul takes some lemonade then wipes the rim
where he sipped with a small napkin and gently hands it back
to her. Denver, in spite of herself, is starting to like him.
END MONTAGE.
Our trio are leaving the carnival, walking three astride with
distance in between each. The sunlight casts strong shadows.
Sethe's eyes glance towards the ground behind them and sees;
THEIR THREE SHADOWS ARE HOLDING HANDS.....as they walk home.
FADE OUT;
FADE- IN.
WIDE ANGLE of a BEAUTIFUL, WIDE STREAM (more like a small
river) with a MULBERRY TREE standing tall on the bank before
it. There is not a soul in sight as the stream moves
gracefully beneath the sun.
SUDDENLY;
A FULLY DRESSED YOUNG BLACK WOMAN EMERGES FROM THE MIDDLE OF
THE STREAM LIKE A GODDESS ARISING OUT OF SPIRITUAL WATERS...
SHE WEARS A STRAW HATT A WHITE DRESS WITH BUTTONS, A LACE
COLLAR AND NEW SHOES. SHE WALKS OUT OF THE WATER TO THE BANK.
Exhausted, sopping wet and breathing heavily as if from
asthma, she sits, leaning against the mulberry tree. She
seems too tired to even hold her head upon her neck. Yet her
skin is like new lineless and smooth. Glowing.
Although racked with pain, SHE IS SMILING. Smiling the way
travellers smile when they have finally arrived after a long
and arduous journey.
The Young Black Woman makes her way through the woods. She
passes by Denver's BOXWOOD BUSH secret place. Then continues
forward, as if with a specific direction in mind.
Sethe, Paul and Denver approach 124. Denver is the first to
see.
DENVER
Look. What is that?
All three look to see;
THE YOUNG BLACK WOMAN sitting on a stump not far from the
steps of 124.
As the three approach, the Young Woman lifts her head and
stares directly at Sethe.
The two women exchange a moment in their eyes - Sethe,
curious yet warm...The Young Woman, happy yet there is a
hunger in her stare.
Denver places sugar between two pieces of bread and gives the
sandwich to Beloved, who, no longer feeling sickly, accepts
it with a bright smile.
Denver explains how to pack mud in the cracks of the hen
house as Beloved listens attentively, eating jelly out of a
jar.
Everyone is sitting on the porch after dinner.
Beloved, looking strong and fit, eats a cane stick - gnawing
at it to the flax, keeping the strings in her mouth long
after the syrup had been sucked off. It makes Denver laugh,
as she licks her cane stick. It makes Sethe smile, to see
them both happy.
It makes Paul disgusted.
Sethe talks to the HEADSTONE ENGRAVER as he works in the hot
sun. His YOUNG SON helps him.
SETHE
She need a marker. Somethin' to tell me
where she is. But I ain't got no money.
The Engraver eyes her body.
ENGRAVER
What you got then?
Sethe is embarrassed by his lascivious tone, especially in
front of the young boy.
The Engraver rises, takes a step toward Sethe and touches her
hip, curling his hand around to her back.
ENGRAVER
What you want it to say?
SETHE
I was thinking what the preacher say at
the funeral. Dearly Beloved.
ENGRAVER
(touching her)
For ten minutes I give you one word for
free.
His hand glides down to her buttocks. Sethe can't help but
see the Young Boy watching the scene.
END of MEMORY.
Beloved waits anxiously at the window for the sight of Sethe
coming home from work....
When she sees her, she runs through the house, out the door
to meet her.
Denver appears at the door, upset by Beloved's loss of
attention in her.
C.U. - SETHE, as she leans her tired head against the porch,
sitting on the step. She closes her eyes and is about to
drift off, when;
BELOVED'S HAND gently touches her shoulder, settling there.
Sethe looks up and smiles, patting her hand. Beloved stands
above her as Denver takes a seat on the step.
Beloved searches Sethe's eyes and asks;
BELOVED
Where your diamonds?
The question surprises Sethe...and startles Denver.
SETHE
Diamonds? What would I be doing with diamonds?
BELOVED
On your ears.
SETHE
Wish I did.
(beat)
Hmm..come to think of it, I had some
crystal once. A present from Mrs. Garner -
woman I worked for at Sweet Home.
DENVER
I never saw you with no earrings.
SETHE
Gone. Long gone.
BELOVED
Tell me...Tell me about your diamonds...
Sethe hesitates. Beloved kneels at her feet.
DENVER
(to Beloved)
Ma'am don't talk about Sweet Home.
BELOVED
(ignoring her)
Tell me...Tell me about your diamonds.
Denver awaits her mother's reaction with great interest.
Sethe looks at Beloved sweet, innocent expression and
something in her resistance, eases:
SETHE
Well..this lady I worked for in Kentucky
gave them to me when I got married..
Denver is both interested and slightly hurt at her mother's
willingness to tell Beloved what she'd never tell her:
SETHE
..What they called married back then. I
remember going up to her in the kitchen
to tell her. I'd help her make ink for
Mr. Garner in the kitchen. I was fool
enough to think I was going have some
kind of ceremony...maybe even a new
dress..
(CONTINUES AS WE CUT TO;)
Sethe's continues telling Beloved, an attentive audience...
Denver, more attuned to Beloved's interest than the story, is
disturbed at her mother's telling of it.
A CROWD of people surround a tree. SEVERAL WHITE MEN are
preparing to hang a group of black men and women standing in
line, awaiting their turn.
Among the crowd is A CHILD (SETHE) holding the hand of an
OLDER BLACK SLAVE WOMAN (NAN). Nan is pointing to a WOMAN
(SETHE'S MOTHER), who is one of the people waiting in line to
be hanged. Nan whispers to Sethe:
NAN
That's your mama - right there.
Little Sethe looks up and sees her mother - her face a mask
of courage and rage and tears. She looks straight ahead - not
at anyone in particular, especially not her daughter.
NAN
..I'm telling you, small girl Sethe...Me
and your Mama was taken by the men many
times..She threw them other babies
away..the others from the whites, without
names, she threw them away..But you she
gave the name of the black man. She had
her arms around him, child. The others,
she did not put her arms around.
Never...Never...
The child Sethe listens, watching her mother move further
down the line.
END of MEMORY as WE CUT BACK TO:
PAUL HAS A BIT IN HIS MOUTH CHAINED TO A WAGON.
He is being lead away from Sweet Home with other black men,
by Three white Men. The bit jerks his head back, saliva
spills uncontrollably out of his mouth. His hands are chained
behind him. His feet chained together at the
ankles....Another chain is connected to an iron belt and
stretches to a wagon. He is being lead away with forty five
other prisoners...
PAUL (VO)
I tried to kill Brandywine - man
Schoolteacher sold me to. Don't know what
possessed me...Me and about 45 other
prisoners were being walked from Kentucky
to Virginia...then on to Georgia. Two
places I don't ever want to see again.
He is lead past the milk shed, when he sees:
HALLE, alone with a crazed faraway look in his eyes, sitting
by the butter churn. HALLE'S FACE IS COVERED WITH BUTTER AND
CLABBER. He sticks his hands in the churn and continues to
cover his face with the sticky, slippery, white substance
covering his face and head, squeezing it through his hands.
The White Men laugh. Paul is aching to scream out to him but
the iron bit holds down his tongue.
As Paul is lead past Halle, A ROOSTER named MISTER is SITTING
ON A TUB in the sun shrieks with an almost arrogant glee.
WHITE MAN
Look at Mister there...
(referring to the rooster)
You go tell these niggers where to go
there Mister! Crow'em right outta here!
Mister crows and the white men laugh.
Tears of rage and humiliation stream down Paul's face. He
struggles to keep a view of Halle, until he is out of sight.
END OF MEMORY.
Paul approaches Sethe, touching her gently.
PAUL
I didn't mean to tell you that.
SETHE
I didn't plan on hearing it.
PAUL
I can't take it back but I can leave it
alone.
Sethe, instead of collapsing from the information, she seems
hardened.
PAUL
Let's do that..let's leave it alone now.
SETHE
(more to herself)
Let it alone. Just sit down and leave it
be! Yeah that would be nice. Would be
even nicer to lose it altogether - if I
had my choice. Halle did. Other people's
brains stopped, went crazy. How sweet
that would have been. Me and Halle
squatting by that churn, smashing cold
lumpy butter in our faces, not a care in
the world..
PAUL
Sethe, don't do this..
SETHE
What a relief to just stop it all right
there, huh?!! Close it shut! Squeeze that
butter...But I had three children on
their way to Ohio and nothing would have
changed that! And you tell me he didn't
leave me!!
Sethe exits O.S. Paul is left alone on the porch until
Beloved runs out of the house giggling with Denver in
pursuit. As Denver passes, Paul sarcastically remarks;
PAUL
Guess she's feeling better, huh?
Denver gives him a quick, disdainful look, then continues
after Beloved.
The two girls run towards the woods.
Beloved is dancing beneath a bright moon. Denver is an
attentive, grateful audience.
DENVER
Where'd you learn to dance?
BELOVED
Nowhere. Look at me do this!
She puts her fists on her hips and skips.
BELOVED
Now you! Come on! Come on!
She takes Denver's hand and places another on her shoulder.
As they dance, Denver laughs harder and harder - a giddiness
from the dizziness and the gratitude she feels for Beloved's
attention.
They spin and fall to the ground, like two lovers nestled.
Beloved catches her breath as Denver asks;
DENVER
Why you call yourself Beloved?
BELOVED
In the dark my name is Beloved.
DENVER
What's it like where you were before?
BELOVED
(a thoughtful expression)
Dark. I'm small in that place. I'm like
this here.
DENVER
Were you cold?
BELOVED
Hot. Nothing to breathe there. No room to
move.
DENVER
How did you get here?
BELOVED
I wait; then I got on the bridge. I stay
there in the dark, in the daytime, in the
dark in the daytime. Long time.
DENVER
All this time you were on the bridge?
BELOVED
No. After. When I got out.
DENVER
Why'd you come here?
BELOVED
To see her face.
DENVER
Ma'am's? Sethe's?
BELOVED
Yes. Sethe.
And with that, Denver takes a breath of courage to ask the
question she's been longing to ask:
DENVER
You my sister, ain't you? You really are.
Beloved looks at her and smiles. They are so close she leans
in curiously and - touching Denver's face - kisses her on the
lips.
DENVER
You won't leave us, will you?
BELOVED
No. Never. This is where I am.
DENVER
I knew it. I knew. First time I saw you
and you said your name. And when you
touched me - real gentle. And familiar.
Like I'd felt that touch before.
Smiling, Beloved moves to touch Denver's cheek when suddenly,
Denver sits up cross legged and urges Beloved;
DENVER
Don't tell mama. You musn't tell her who
you really are. I don't know what she'd
do! Please, you hear?
Suddenly, Beloved's face turns to rage as she rises up as
well;
BELOVED
Don't tell me what to do? Don't never
tell me what to do!?
DENVER
But..but I'm on your side. I want to
protect you...
BELOVED
(stands above Denver)
She's the one! She's the one I need! You
can go but she's the one I have to have!
Beloved abruptly drops to her knees and crawls out the
boxwood bush room as Denver's pleads;
DENVER
No. Beloved please! Don't go! I didn't do
nothing! We were dancing! Don't go!....
Sethe is dressed as if for church as she makes her way through
the woods with a specific destination in mind.
Soon, she comes upon;
Sethe steps out of the woods and into an open clearing. A
LARGE ROCK sits in the clearing like a pulpit above the pew's
of grass and weeds.
Sethe remembers the place as it was... She hears the VOICES
OF A CROWD...a gathering of people though the clearing
remains empty. She crosses to the rock and sits. Camera moves
up to reveal -
MEMORY:
BABY SUGGS, vital and strong, standing on the rock,
preaching:
BABY SUGGS
I'm not here to tell you all to clean up
your lives and sin no more....I'm not
here to tell you we're the blessed meek
and are glorybound!...I'm here to tell
you that the only grace we can have, is
the grace we can imagine...And if you
cannot see it, then you shall not have
it...
END OF MEMORY.
C.U. on SETHE as she remembers Baby Suggs words, sitting
alone in the clearing - the images of the past gone.
Beloved has found her and watches from a hidden place...
Camera moves beyond her to find;
Denver, having followed Beloved, watches her from a distance.
Sethe remembers Baby Suggs advice:
BABY SUGGS (V.O.)
..God lead you home... So now, lay'em
down, child. Sword and shield..Don't
study war no more. Lay all that mess
down. Sword and shield...
SETHE
Lay'em down...sword and shield.
Sethe weeps...She slides to the ground and holds her head to
weep. She covers her head from God and cries AS SHE LETS THE
MEMORIES COME..memories she can no longer fight from coming;
CUT TO:
SETHE'S MEMORIES;
SETHE IS IN THE SAME BENT OVER POSITION only here, her back
is exposed and she is being beaten by the Schoolteacher's
boys. The BOY BEATING SETHE never stops with the whip for a
second as he rants;
BOY BEATING SETHE
NIGGER TRASH..OPENING YOUR MOUTH...
SECOND BOY
YOU GONNA KILL HER! YOU BETTER STOP!
BOY BEATING SETHE
I'LL KILL HER ALL RIGHT...NEVER OPEN HER
MOUTH 'BOUT ME AGIN....
They beat her mercilessly.
Sethe, tear stained, bloody and very pregnant fights her way
through a corn field as she makes her escape..
Her dress hangs torn at the back - her wounds open and
bleeding. Her feet already swollen and blistered. She is in
agonizing pain. She moves like a figure in a nightmare.
CUT TO:
A SERIES OF IMAGES IN WHICH WE SEE SETHE STRUGGLING THROUGH
DAYS AND NIGHTS OF WALKING AND HIDING, IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS
AS SHE MAKES HER WAY ACROSS THE STATE.
THE FINAL IMAGE IS:
Sethe falls to the ground unable to move - her contractions
have started and the pain is unbearable.
Her breasts are leaking on her sweat stained body. Her legs
are scratched and bleeding from moving through broken twigs
and rock. On her back, the tree is starting to form.
She lays there waiting for death. Until a VOICE ASKS:
AMY (OS)
WHO THAT BACK THERE!
Sethe can not answer as she hears TWO FEET moving through the
field. She clutches her pregnant stomach as if somehow she
might hide it from whoever might be coming to harm her.
A RAGGEDLY LOOKING WHITE GIRL with arms like cane stalks and
enough hair for five heads steps through into view.
AMY
Look there. A nigger. If that don't beat
all...
Sethe can not speak for fear.
AMY
Man, you 'bout the scariest looking
something I ever seen. What you doing
back up here?
Sethe manages to control her breath and push out the word;
SETHE
Running.
Amy looks at Sethe's swollen, bloody flesh at the end of her
legs.
AMY
Them the feet you running on? My Jesus
my...
SETHE
(semi-delerious)
Am I in Ohio?
AMY
Ohio! Fool girl - you in Kentucky. You
'bout a thousand miles from Ohio.
SETHE
(murmurs to herself)
I'm still in Kentucky.
AMY
You got anything on you, gal, pass for
food?
SETHE
No, ma'am.
AMY
I like to die I'm so hungry. Thought
there might be huckleberries. That's why
I come up here. You having a baby?
SETHE
I expect this baby ma'am is gonna die in
these wild onions.
Amy doesn't know what to do with that information. So..
AMY
Well, I got to eat something.
Any stands and looks as if she's about to leave when Sethe,
feeling the girl is safe, stops her with a question.
SETHE
Where you on your way to, miss?
AMY
(eager to tell)
Boston. Get me some velvet. It's a store
called Wilson. I seen pictures and they
have the prettiest velvet.
SETHE
Boston - is that far?
AMY
Farther than Ohio.
SETHE
Must be velvet closer by.
AMY
Not like in Boston. Be so pretty on me.
You ever touch velvet? Or even seen it?
SETHE
If I did, I didn't know it. What's it like?
Sethe desperately wants her to stay - to not be alone. Amy
kneels back down to her, curious now;
AMY
What they call you?
SETHE
(lies)
Lu.
AMY
What you gonna do, just lay there and
foal?
SETHE
I can't get up.
AMY
What?
SETHE
I can't get up.
Amy wipes her nose and looks up beyond Sethe.
AMY
There's a house back yonder. Well, not a
house with people in it - more like a
lean-to near the river.
SETHE
How far?
AMY
Make a difference, does it? You stay
here, snake might get you.
SETHE
Well, he may come but I can't stand up,
let alone walk...and God help me, I can't
crawl.
AMY
Sure you can Lu..come on..
Amy helps Sethe turn over onto all fours.
Amy walks beside Sethe as the latter painfully crawls, taking
moments to stop and let the pain go through her.
AMY
Come on Lu! You got to move faster than
that. You won't get to Ohio til you
ninety years old, you keep moving that
ways.
Sethe is trying to walk, holding on to Amy at first, then a
tree.
AMY
Cause of me, you up and walking. See,
Jesus - Lu made it through..I'm good at
sick things, ain't I?
SETHE
Yeah, you good...
AMY
What's that all over your dress?
SETHE
Milk..Got to get my milk to my baby girl.
AMY
You got another baby waiting for you?
SETHE
(stops and touches belly)
I think this one is dead.
Amy doesn't know what to say, so she says:
AMY
You hungry?
Sethe keeps trying to walk;
SETHE
I ain't nothing but in a hurry, miss. Got
to meet someone...help bring me and my
milk to my baby girl...
AMY
You want shoes?
SETHE
Say what?
AMY
I figured how...
CUT TO:
Amy cutting two pieces form Sethe shawl then filling them
with leaves and tying them over her feet -
CUT TO:
Sethe and Amy walk towards the river when then see:
A SMALL, ABANDONED ROWBOAT with oars.
AMY
Jesus looking at you, girl!
Sethe can't believe her eyes. She walks right into the water
when suddenly, her own water breaks and her labor begins...
She doubles up in pain;
AMY
What you doing that for!? Ain't you got a
brain in your head? Stop that right now!
I said stop it, Lu. You the dumbest thing
on this here earth, LU!..LU!
Sethe, on her knees, crawls into the boat and props her feet
up. Water leaks in wherever it can, rising up as high as her
waist. Amy takes her position to assist.
AMY
Oh Jesus, I'm awful sorry 'bout the
braggin...I need you here now..Come on
Jesus...don't be getting lost on me now.
Sethe screams in agony as the child pushes through. Amy curses;
AMY
Damn daddies never around 'cept for the
fun part. Biggest joke God made on woman
was giving men the planters 'stead of the
soil...!! PUSH!
SETHE
(gasping)
PULL!!
Amy's strong hands pull Denver's head out and up, to meet
Sethe's eyes. Sethe cannot believe this creature made it
through..Amy rinses it with water then, wrapping it in her
skirt, holds it up to Sethe..
AMY
My Lord...She's never gonna know who I
am. You gonna tell her? Who brought her
into this world. You better tell her, you
hear! You say MISS AMY DENVER. Of Boston.
SETHE
That's pretty. Denver. Real pretty.
Sethe awakens, mud-caked, on the banks of the river. Her baby
girl crying beside her. Amy is gone. She rises, painfully,
picks up her child and continues on her way.
CUT TO:
MONTAGE - MORE DAYS AND NIGHTS OF SETHE, NOW WITHOUT AMY - A
NEW BABY STRAPPED TO HER BODY - MAKING HER AWAY ALONG THE
OHIO RIVER...THROUGH HOT SUNNY DAYS AND RAINY NIGHTS WITHOUT
PROTECTION...SEARCHING FOR FOOD AND SHELTER...
FINAL IMAGE IS:
A thunderstorm cracks across the sky and floods the river.
Sethe is sitting beneath the oak - the rain soaking her as
she breast feeds her baby. She cries out loud - but her sobs
and tears are lost in the rain and thunder.
Sethe walks downriver with Denver tied to her chest. She
stops when she sees:
A FLATBED gliding down river. She can't make out if they're
white people or not, so she hides behind a tree until it
passes;
Waiting behind the tree, we see that Sethe is sweating a
fever. But Denver seems to be doing fine.
She sees the flatbed pass her and continues on her way. She
sees;
THREE COLORED PEOPLE - AN OLDER MAN and two boys - fishing.
She approaches cautiously.
One of the boys is the first to see her. Sethe's bloody and
torn clothes and her feverish face make her quite a sight to
the young boy. He taps the Old Man on the shoulder and
motions for him to turn around.
The Old Man takes in Sethe and instantly knows where she's
been and why she's there.
STAMP PAID
Headin cross?
SETHE
Yes sir.
STAMP PAID
Anybody know you coming?
SETHE
Yes sir. My mother-in-law over in...
Stamp Paid raises his hand to stop her. He looks around to
see that no one else is in sight, then motions for her to sit
on a rock. As she does, he gets a water jug and hands it to
her - she drinks like a madman in the desert. The Boys watch
in fascination. Stamp Paid turns to one of them and says:
STAMP PAID
Take off that coat?
BOY
Why?
STAMP PAID
You heard me?
The Boy slips out of his jacket, complaining.
BOY
What am I gonna wear?
STAMP PAID
You want it back...
He unties the baby from Sethe and wraps it in the coat.
STAMP PAID
..then you go head and take it off this
baby. And if you can do that, then go
'way somewhere and don't come back.
On a flatbed, Stamp Paid crosses the river with Sethe, her
baby and the two boys.
Stamp Paid helps Sethe walk up a very steep bank while the
Boy without a jacket, carries the baby who wears it.
Baby Suggs rises off the bench on the porch when she sees
Sethe coming up the walk. She runs to her and embraces Sethe
and the baby, tears in her eyes.
BABY SUGGS
Oh my Lord...My sweet Lord thank you.
Baby Suggs welcomes Sethe into the house, kissing her hard on
the lips....Sethe can't believe she's in her arms.
BABY SUGGS
Where's Halle?
Sethe looks at her with confusion and exhaustion.
SETHE
He wasn't there.
A flash of fear is quickly transformed into pragmatism.
BABY SUGGS
Well, he be along presently, I'm sure.
SETHE
Where are the children?
BABY SUGGS
Not now. You too ugly looking to wake 'em
up in the night. First we get you well..
Sethe is remembering these last images, she eases her own
hand up to her neck - rubbing herself the way Baby Suggs did.
She realizes how much she misses her...and wonder who can
touch her now and help her "lay it all down". And then, quite
suddenly;
AN IMAGE FLASHES ACROSS HER MIND;
- PAUL GENTLY EASING HIS HANDS AROUND SETHE FROM
BEHIND...TENDERLY KISSING SETHE'S BACK
Paul...There is Paul. Sethe realizes, as IMAGES FLASH ACROSS
HER MIND'S EYE:
- PAUL SITTING ON THE PORCH THE FIRST DAY HE ARRIVED.
- PAUL BATTLING THE BABY GHOST.
- PAUL SINGING AS HE FIXES THE KITCHEN TABLE.
- SETHE WRAPPED IN PAUL'S BIG ARMS AS THEY LAY IN BED.
Sethe rises from the ground, as if with a new realization.
She begins to walk out of the clearing and into the woods,
her pace increasing with each image....
Sethe walks through the woods, passing Beloved unawares - who
has fallen asleep by a tree. Beloved is awakened as Sethe
walks by, and gets to her feet to follow.
Further on, Sethe passes a sleeping Denver, who also awakens
upon hearing the footsteps of her mother, followed by
Beloved. Sethe walks on, unaware of them following her.
Wide angle of Sethe walking well ahead of Beloved and Denver.
Sethe is walking with great purpose and energy.
Beloved runs out of the house and heads back for the woods.
She passes Denver as if she weren't there.
Beloved reaches the stream and steps in. She begins to
violently hit the water around her, then begins hitting her
own face and head, clawing at it as if to escape from the
boundaries of flesh. Suddenly she submerges herself
underwater and holds herself there, as if to drown herself...
She bursts out of the water, gasping for air...Slowly, her
rage subsides, replaced with a calm, ruthless understanding
Beloved is walking back toward the house. She stops.
She looks back at the house to the kitchen window - knowing
Paul and Sethe are in there. She approaches the kitchen
window and looks in.
POV - Sethe is drying off Paul's body and rebuttoning her
dress.
Camera moves slowly into a C.U. of Beloved, this time her
focus is on Paul.
Paul is chained by the ankles to forty-five other men. He
hands are shackled. In his mouth, an iron bit...
The men are being led by WHITE GUARDS with rifles.
Camera follows them under a burning sun as they approach;
A TRENCH. One thousand feet long. Five feet deep. Five feet
wide.
Camera tilts down to reveal, within the trench;
WOODEN BOXES, with scrap limber roofs and a door of bars
fitted on them like a cage that opens up to a wall of red
dirt stretching two feet above the top of the bars themselves.
Paul D. walks across the field with a thin blanket over his
nightclothes - walking toward the storeroom.
In the window of her bedroom, Sethe watches him - sensing he
is moving further and further away from her.
In the window of Denver's room, Beloved watches Paul as well -
with a pleased expression.
CUT TO:
PAUL'S MEMORIES;
A RIFLE SHOT. A WHITE GUARD SHOUTS;
WHITE GUARD
Hiiiiiii!
Three white Men walk along the trench unlocking the cage
doors one by one...
One by one, the Black men emerge and stand in a line in the
trench.
When all are assembled, A SECOND RIFLE SHOT signals them to
climb out of the trench to the ground above.
Waiting for them above the trench, is one thousand feet of
chain. Each Black Man bends over and waits as the First Man
on line threads the chain through his leg iron, passing it to
the second and so on...
As they connect each other to the chain, Camera Pans down the
line of men and while not a word is spoken, WE HEAR THEIR
THOUGHTS...thoughts to themselves, or, if possible, through
their eyes to the man beside them:
BLACK MAN ONE
(VO)
I'm a make it..
BLACK MAN TWO
(VO)
New man. New man...
BLACK MAN THREE
(VO)
Steady now, steady.
BLACK MAN FOUR
(VO)
Help me... this mornin's bad.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE BLACK MEN ARE CHAINED AND KNEELING IN A STRAIGHT LINE.
The White Guards walk passed them. one White Guard stops in
front of the man beside Paul D. He turns to him.
WHITE GUARD
Breakfast? Want some breakfast nigger?
BLACK MAN ONE
Yes sir.
WHITE GUARD
Hungry nigger?
BLACK MAN ONE
Yes sir.
WHITE GUARD
Here you go.
The White Guard unzips his fly and undoes his pants and moves
a step closer to the Black Man's mouth.
Paul D. looks ahead, trembling...He vomits...The Guard steps
away as another Guard steps in and hits Paul on the shoulder
with a rifle..
The Black Men work...sledge hammers in hand...
As they work, miraculously, THEY SING.."They sing about the
women they knew, the children they had been...they sing of
bosses and masters and misses...of mules and dogs and the
shamelessness of life...They sing of sisters long gone. They
sing love songs to Death."
Denver sits outside the cold house - and listens to the
sounds of lovemaking. And cries.
Paul waits outside in the cold, cupping his hands and
breathing inside to keep them warm. He is rehearsing:
PAUL
Look here Sethe..You ain't gonna like
what I got to say but I got to say
it...See, it's not the..a man
can't...what I mean is, it ain't really
me..see, it ain't weakness, the kind of
weakness I can fight, that girl is doing
it. I know you think I never liked her
nohow, still don't, but she is doing it
to me anyway. Fixing me, Sethe, she's
fixed me and I can't break it...
Sethe appears, exiting the back door of the restaurant with a
scrap pan in the crook of her arm. To her surprise. she finds
Paul waiting for her.
SETHE
Man, you make me feel like a young girl,
you coming by to pick me up after work.
Nobody ever did that before. Better watch
out, I might start looking forward to it.
She tosses the bones and skins from the scrap pan into a heap
before four dogs who wait there as if by appointment.
SETHE
Got to rinse this out.
She enters the restaurant. Paul watches the dogs eat -
watching them getting what they wanted. Sethe re-appears with
a cloth over her head.
SETHE
You get off early or what?
PAUL
I took off early.
SETHE
Anything the matter?
PAUL
In a way of speaking.
SETHE
Not cut back?
PAUL
No, no. They got plenty of work with them
pigs..More they can handle. I just..
(Sethe waits)
You ain't gonna like what I'm about to
say, Sethe.
Sethe steps forward to hear what Paul came to tell her. There
is no apprehension or anger in her look. Instead, a calm
resolve - as if she were already able to accept whatever he
had to tell her without it being anyone's fault. As if she
already knew he cane to say he was leaving her. She smiles.
SETHE
Well say it, Paul D...whether I like it
or not.
Paul knows what she's expecting. And when he sees her
diminished expectation, the melancholy without blame in her
eyes....he can't tell her about Beloved. He is filled with
respect and admiration for her in that moment. Something pops
into his head and out of his mouth that wasn't planned;
PAUL
I want you pregnant, Sethe. Would you do
that for me?
Sethe breaks up with laughter. Paul joins in.
SETHE
You came by here to ask me that!? You are
one crazy-headed man. You right; I don't
like it!...Don't you think I'm a little
too old to start that all over again?
She slips her fingers into his.
PAUL
Think about it.
Paul lifts them, putting the tips of her fingers on his
cheek. He smiles broadly;
She laughs, shaking her head. A burden transformed into a
gift, so suddenly. They begin walking.
Sethe and Paul catch and snatch each other's fingers,
stealing quick pats on the behind, joyfully. Paul throws his
arm around Sethe and squeezes. She lets her head touch his
chest. They stop and stay that way for a moment - not
breathing. Sethe closes her eyes. Paul looks up to the trees
lining the roadside like defending arms against attack.
Softly, suddenly, it begins to snow. Sethe opens her eyes:
SETHE
Mercy.
On the road towards 124, Paul and Sethe run hand in hand.
Snow falling all around them.
SETHE
I been on my feet all day, Paul D.
PAUL
Where I been? Sitting down!?
SETHE
Stop! I don't have the legs for this!
They slow to a walk.
PAUL
Then give'em to me.
Before she can stop him, Paul hoists Sethe up over his
shoulders.
SETHE
You need some babies..somebody to play
with in the snow.
PAUL
I sure would like to give it a try. Need
a willing partner though.
SETHE
I'll say..Very, very willing.
They continue laughing and moving down Bluestone Road when
they are jolted by the appearance of;
Beloved. Waiting in her usual place for Sethe. Her hands
wrapped in a long shawl, waiting to be given to Sethe. Her
eyes only on Sethe, not even acknowledging Paul's presence.
Sethe gets herself down from Paul.
SETHE
Crazy girl. You out here with nothing on.
She takes the shawl from Beloved's hands and wraps it around
her shoulders.
SETHE
You got to learn more sense than that.
She walks on ahead with Beloved. Paul, suddenly icy cold and
filled with anger, walks behind.
Denver waits on the porch. Sethe and Beloved walk by her.
SETHE
Evening, girl.
Sethe and Beloved enter the house. As Paul approaches, he
stops before Denver. Their eyes meet. Paul stares at her, as
if to ask - "Who's ally are you?"...Denver, unnerved by his
look, runs into the house. Paul waits on the porch until, a
moment later, Sethe re-appears.
SETHE
Now I know you not sleeping out there
tonight, are you Paul D.?
(Paul doesn't reply)
You come upstairs tonight. Where you
belong...and stay there.
As if healed by her strength, Paul's face melts into relief.
We see Sethe and Paul united as the snow begins to pile up.
Sethe carries a big basket of berries as young Howard and
Bulgar run ahead of her. She turns in the opposite direction
and walks along the side of the house to the back entrance of
the kitchen.
She passes the open window of the classroom and hears;
SCHOOLTEACHER
(OS)
Which one are you doing?
BOY (OS)
Sethe?
Hearing her name, Sethe stops and peeks through the window.
Schoolteacher is standing over the student, who has been
writing in a notebook. Schoolteacher licks his finger and
thumbs a couple of pages before saying;
SCHOOLTEACHER
No, no. That's not the way. I told you to
put her human characteristics on the
left; her animal ones on the right. And
don't forget to line them up.
Although Sethe doesn't entirely understand, something about
the words disturb her. She looks to her children.
Sethe carried her baby girl in one arm, her two boys by the
hand with the other...They move as fast as they can.
They arrive at the meeting place where A WOMAN crouching in
the field is waiting.
WOMAN
Hurry up. You're late.
SETHE
(hands her the children)
Here!
HOWARD
But ma'am...
SETHE
Just go with her! Do what I tell ya!
Sethe carefully hands her baby girl to the woman.
SETHE
Put sugar water on that cloth for her to
suck so she won't forget me til I come.
WOMAN
Where you going?
SETHE
Halle wasn't there. I gotta go back.
WOMAN
You crazy..
SETHE
Take em out. Now! I'll get there myself.
I got her milk...I'll get there...Don't
worry.
She kisses her baby girl, a little too hard perhaps, waking
her...along with the boys...
SETHE
Go..Go! Now!
Sethe disappears back into the corn field leaving the Woman
holding the baby girl... as Bulgar cries out.
BULGAR
Mama?
Sethe exits the corn field and heads for her living quarters
when suddenly;
THE FOUR BOYS appears from out of nowhere..two restraining
her, one holding a horsewhip....
BOY WITH HORSEWHIP
You nigger bastard..
Sethe struggles and is about to scream out when she is
slapped and muffled and dragged into the corn field to be
beaten.....
END OF MEMORY;
Pigs are crying in the chute as Paul, Stamp Paid and twenty
other workers push and prod them towards the slaughterhouse.
Although steeped in pig shit on a wintry day - his hands numb
from the cold - Paul D. is in high spirits. HE SINGS as he
works much to the amusement of his fellow co-workers.
CO-WORKER 1
Hey - you like this work so much maybe
you best get in the chute with the
others. You ain't got much more sense
than they do.
The men laugh. Paul smiles and brushes it off.
PAUL
Ain't just a job reason to sing. Other
things a man's got to look forward to
that a job just a way to spend your day
til the good times arrive.
CO-WORKER 2
Good times? Ain't no such day.
STAMP PAID
Now, now...it's all a state a mind, right
Paul D. If you can think it, it can
happen.
PAUL
More than that. When a man can make plans
then a man can make good times happen.
CO-WORKER 1
Oh the man's got plans! You saving up for
a gold mine, boy.
(more laughter)
PAUL
Better then gold, my friend. Me and my
woman's planning on starting a family.
Stamp Paid's face registers sudden concern.
PAUL
New life. Born free, hear! Now if that
don't define a good tine, I don't know
what does.
CO-WORKER 2
Nothing born free ever again.
PAUL
What you talkin? Nobody owns us no more.
Nobody gonna own my children neither.
CO-WORKER 2
Children inherit what come before'em.
Just cause you can't see no chains, don't
mean they not there. We're not free men.
We're somewhere between freedom and
chains. And as long as the world is
white, that's where we're stayin.
The truth of this causes the men to be silent as they
continue working. Stamp Paid looks at Paul, confused by what
he should do.
The men are on break. Paul sits alone enjoying a lunch packed
by Sethe...Stamp Paid approaches and sits beside him.
STAMP PAID
May I?
PAUL
Free country. No matter what anybody says.
STAMP PAID
I like the way you think, boy. Good. Good
to think that way. Friend of mine, Baby
Suggs was her name...sort of became a
preacher in these parts..that was her way
of thinking too. When she was at her
best, that is.
PAUL
You knew Baby Suggs?
STAMP PAID
Oh yes...You're not one of her Sweet Home
men, now are you?
PAUL
Yes sir...Me and my brothers and her son.
STAMP PAID
Oh, I see now.
PAUL
Sethe told me she died soft as cream.
STAMP PAID
Well...maybe on the outside.
PAUL
Why is that?
Stamp Paid looks at him with sympathetic, sudden
understanding.
STAMP PAID
You don't know, son, do you? See I had to
figure that out first.
PAUL
Know what?
Stamp Paid pulls out AN OLD NEWSPAPER CLIPPING from a bag he
carries with him all the time. He hands it to Paul who looks
to see:
A DRAWING OF A YOUNG BLACK WOMAN beneath a HEADLINE; MURDER!
RUNAWAY SLAVE KILLS CHILD....
PAUL
Who is it?
STAMP PAID
That there's a picture of Sethe.
PAUL
Sethe?
(studies it)
Nah, that ain't her mouth. I can see
where you might think it around the eyes
but that there ain't her mouth. Besides,
why would some black woman's picture be
in the paper?
STAMP PAID
You don't read son, do you?
(Paul shakes head NO)
You want me to read to you?
Paul senses something terribly wrong...and doesn't know
whether to say yes or no.
Sethe is sweeping the porch.
Paul appears on the road. When he sees Sethe on the porch in
the distance, he stops.
Sethe sees him and smiles - but something about his slow
approach to the house sends off an alarm within her.
Paul makes his way to the porch. He stops before her.
SETHE
Already fed the girls. You eat?
(he shakes NO)
Want something?
Paul doesn't answer. Instead, he steps up to her as he
removes the clipping from his pocket and hands it to her.
Sethe's heart stops beating for a moment - not having seen
this image for many years. But she's survived worse than the
telling so she faces him.
SETHE
Best you come inside.
She rises and enters the house. Paul follows.
Sethe is carrying a bucket of water to the house. She sees:
Bulgar and Howard running and playing. Howard tackles his
brother and starts tickling him. The two boys laugh hard.
Sethe watches, a moment of fear across her face;
SETHE (VO)
I'd hear my boys laughing a laugh I ain't
never heard. And for a second I'd get
scared - scared someone might hear them
and get mad...
Sethe realizes, placing down the bucket:
SETHE (VO)
Then I remembered...and if they laughed
that hard til it hurt, that would be the
only hurt they had all day....
Sethe sobs, uncontrollably.
Another woman teaches Sethe the alphabet, as Sethe cradles
Denver and the Little Girl (Beloved) crawls around her feet.
As folks gather to hear Baby Suggs preach, she introduces a
smiling, shy Sethe to each one.
SETHE (VO)
...And when everyone would gather to hear
Baby Suggs, I saw something I ain't never
seen before in my whole life...
Alone for a moment, Sethe looks around at the crowd of faces;
Sethe's Melody stops as Baby Suggs stands on her rock and
calls to the crowd:
BABY SUGGS
Let the children come!
FROM OUT OF THE WOODS, CHILDREN RUN INTO THE CLEARING.
Camera follows the joyous exodus to reveal:
THE CLEARING IS FILLED WITH ADULTS the entire black
community of the days when Sethe first arrived. The children
run to their respective families;
BABY SUGGS
(with joy)
Let your mother's hear you laugh!!
The children, loving the game, laugh hard. The adults get a
kick out of it.
Sethe watches her boys and hides her laughter.
BABY SUGGS
Let the grown men come!!
OUT OF THE WOODS, A GROUP OF GROWN MEN COME INTO THE CLEARING.
BABY SUGGS
LET YOUR WIVES AND YOUR CHILDREN SEE YOU
DANCE!
The men form a circle and dance as the crowd supports them
with a clapping rhythm. A SONG arises from the women to
accompany to dance....
BABY SUGGS
Now...you women...I want you to cry. For
the living. For the dead....Just cry.
Camera follows those women who are not singing as one by one,
they remember and weep...
Sethe watches...and weeps.
SETHE
....Something in me knew Halle was never
gonna knock on our door. He was never
gonna see what I saw that day. I saw what
men look like...and I saw mothers, for
the first time.
Stamp Paid walks up to the porch carrying a TWO BIG BASKETS
OF BLACKBERRIES ... his body dirty, scratched and bleeding.
SETHE (VO)
I think it was Stamp Paid who started it.
He walked six miles to the riverbank,
slid into a ravine, reached through blood
drawing thorns, suffered mosquitoes,
wasps and the meanest lady spiders in the
State just to bring us those berries.
He places the baskets on the porch in front of Baby Suggs,
Sethe who is holding Denver..and the Little Girl (Beloved).
BABY SUGGS
(laughs)
What a sight you are, Stamp.
STAMP PAID
Worth it though. Just one bite of these
berries and you feel down right anointed.
He puts one into Denver's mouth.
SETHE
She's too little for that, Stamp. Her
bowels be soup.
BABY SUGGS
It'll sickify her stomach..Now go wash up
round back...crazy fool..
Stamp exits.
SETHE
It was real nice of him.
BABY SUGGS
He's a good one, no doubt of that. I can
get three, maybe four pies out of this.
Seems a shame just for us though. I'm
gonna invite Ella and John over...
SETHE
How 'bout if I make a couple of chickens
to back it up?
SETHE (VO)
And that's how it began...
Various images of people gathered enjoying food and
drink...laughing and singing...
SETHE (VO)
...and Ella and John turned into almost
ninety others...
- Women serving up the food...
- Older men sitting and talking as they eat...
- Younger men playing with the children. Chasing them with
sheets on their backs, scaring them into laughter..
- A Man with a guitar playing a blues song and singing.
While Sethe enjoys her free life and, most of all, her
children - the boys running around her..Denver in her
arms..Her Little Girl (Beloved) by her side.. Baby Sugg's
visits with various guests, serving up the food...
SETHE (VO)
... Everybody ate so well and laughed so
much...
INTERCUT; Images of whispers exchanged between some of the
women:
SETHE (VO)
...it made them angry...
Women head to head with a remark or an eye of disapproval
towards Baby Suggs as she continues cooking and feeding....
SETHE (VO)
The pies, the turkeys...the bread pudding
and shortbread..the one whole block of
ice brought all the way from Cincinnati -
it made 'em mad...Loaves and fishes were
Jesus's powers...they did not belong to
an ex-slave who never had a white boy
beat her, who had her freedom bought, who
rented a house from white folks that
hated slavery worse than they hated
slaves...It made'em furious - her
thoughtless generosity and un-called for
pride...She had over stepped...offended
them by giving too much...and they left
their disapproval there so's you could
smell in the air the whole next day...
Baby Suggs works the field, not far from Stamp Paid...
SETHE (VO)
Later on I wondered why no one warned
us...why no one saw them coming and ran
to 124 to tell us...
She chops at the soil over the roots of the pepper plants.
She stops - sensing something is wrong. She looks up at a
clear blue sky...She hears the birds and the stream way down
beyond the woods..
She looks around and sees Bulgar, Howard and the Little Girl
(Beloved) playing with loud voices by the side of the house.
She sees Sethe squatted in the pole beans with Denver in a
bushel basket beside her.
The clok, clok of wood being chopped causes her to look over
to Stamp Paid, helping out with the axe...
She returns to her work...but something is deeply wrong.
And then she hears it;
THE SOUND OF HORSES and A HORSE DRAWN WAGON coming from the
distance. (The same sound Sethe heard in her first memory of
the sycamores earlier on)
She rises up and looks;
POV;
Far in the distance, FOUR HORSEMEN ARE RIDING TOWARD THEM.
ONE DRIVES A WAGON and IS WEARING A DISTINCTIVE HAT - IT IS
SCHOOLTEACHER.....
CUT BACK TO:
Sethe continues working until she notices peripherally that
Baby Suggs is standing stock still, staring at something.
Sethe rises and looks in the same direction;
CUT BACK TO:
The Four Horsemen are closer...
CUT BACK TO:
Sethe's face freezes in terror as ...
Stamp Paid, in between chops, looks up and sees the two
women..then turns his face to see the men.
BUT IT IS SETHE'S FACE WE CONCENTRATE ON - AS WE INTERCUT THE
ONCOMING APPROACH OF THE FOUR HORSEMEN and HEAR HER WORDS:
SETHE (VO)
...There's a Look whitefolks get..a Look
every Negro learns to recognize along
with his ma'am's tit..That righteous Look
that's like a flag going up the pole..the
righteousness that announces the whip,
the fist, the burning, the lie...long
before it happens in the open...
Over the above speech, we see in Sethe's expression a death
of soul - an instantaneous loss of hope for possibilities of
joy and life. And with it, an insane rage.
Sethe grabs Denver out of the basket, then scrambles after
the crawling Little Girl (Beloved), scooping her under her
free arm...
SETHE
Howard!...Bulgar!
The tone of her voice cause the boys to freeze. She runs
towards them, grabbing one by the hand and ordering the other
to run in front of them. She moves and speaks with efficient
clarity.
SETHE
The shed!...Get in the shed!...Run!
Baby Suggs and Stamp Paid watch helplessly -
The Four Horsemen - Schoolteacher, his Nephew, a Slave
Catcher and a Sheriff - arrive at the house and dismount,
tying their horses to the front gate (which is no longer
there).
The Nephew scampers to the front of the house and peers in
the window - he listens. Hearing nothing he motions for them
to go round the side of the house.
Camera follows them as it reveals Baby Suggs and Stamp Paid
standing exactly where we left them...Except;
They are both staring at the shed - out of which strange
noises, thuds and the FRIGHTENED CRIES OF CHILDREN are heard....
Two Black Boys and several Woman are coming up the road. The
Slave Catcher motions with his rifle for them to stop - and
they do.
The men move towards the shed, meeting up with the Nephew as
he runs past Baby Suggs and Stamp Paid...
POV;
Camera moves closer towards the shed, the sounds coning from
within more audible now...
Sethe, clutching the dead baby to her chest, is led out of
the shed by Stamp Paid,
Outside, a throng of black faces have gathered who stop
murmuring the second they see her. Among them are Ella and
Lady Jones. They are shocked and pained.
Sethe is led past them to a waiting cart - in total silence.
Baby Suggs, at the same time, is getting the boys up the
porch into the house. When Denver cries in Stamp Paid's arms,
she stops..lets the boys sit and runs towards the cart.
Sethe is seated in the cart beside the Sheriff. Baby Suggs
takes the crying Denver from Stamp Paid..She tells the
Sheriff.
BABY SUGGS
Excuse me..but the child needs
nursin..needs the mother's milk..
SHERIFF
Then she's best come too.
Baby Suggs approaches Sethe who sees Denver crying and
reaches for her without letting the baby go. Baby Suggs
resists;
BABY SUGGS
One at a time!...And you gotta clean
yourself up!
But Sethe only wants her living child. The two women struggle
as Stamp Paid does what he can..Finally, Sethe wins and takes
Denver with her free hand, undoes her dress and nurse's her
with a bloody breast..
Baby Suggs breaks inside. Breaks right in two, although from
outwards appearances, she looks merely numbed by shock.
A WHITE BOY makes his way through the crowd with a pair of
shoes and hands them to her..
WHITE BOY
Mama says Wednesday. She says you got to
have them fixed by Wednesday.
Baby Suggs looks at him not understanding..
WHITE BOY
You hear, Baby? She says Wednesday.
BABY SUGGS
(taking the shoes)
I beg your pardon..Lord, I beg your
pardon..I sure do....
CUT TO:
PRESENT DAY (END OF MEMORY) :
A bright, cold winter day. Beloved wears a pair of old
skates. Denver wears the second pair and Sethe has one skate
and one shoe..The two girls giggle and fall as they try to
skate on the ice... helping each other up. Their skirts
whirling...their laughter mingled with screams of delight.
Sethe, wearing only shoes, watches them and laughs.
DENVER
Come on, ma'am...try!
Sethe steps onto the ice and takes a few strides and promptly
falls on her rear. The girls scream with laughter. Sethe
tries to get up and falls, their laughter infecting her as
well. The girls try to help her and fall over each other in
the trying.
Denver rises and tries an independent glide. The tip of her
skate hits a bump and she falls, flapping her arms wildly.
All three laugh so hard, they start coughing. Beloved goes to
Denver's aid.
Sethe rises up on her hands and knees, her laughter shaking
her chest and causing her eyes to tear in the cold air.
Beloved helps Denver, and falls as well. The two girls see
Sethe laughing and play it up even more, a few more times...
Until, Denver notices something and motions Beloved to stop
and look.
The two glide back to Sethe. Her laughter has stopped, but
her tears have not... They gently, comfortingly, touch her
shoulder.
A conflicted and contrite Stamp Paid walks through the snow
down Bluestone road towards 124.
As he does, he remembers his last conversation with Baby
Suggs;
MEMORY:
A fall day. Leaves ankle high. Stamp Paid is walking when he
sees baby Suggs carrying a carpetbag full of repaired shoes.
He crosses over to her as he gets her attention;
STAMP PAID
You missed the Clearing meeting three
Saturdays running.
Baby Suggs turns to her old friend - but there is no sign of
welcome or recognition. There is a noticeable change in her
demeanor. She continues walking. He follows;
STAMP PAID
Folks came.
BABY SUGGS
Folks come. Folks go.
STAMP PAID
Here, let me carry that.
He reaches for the carpetbag but Baby Suggs pulls it away.
BABY SUGGS
I got a delivery around here. Name of
Tucker.
STAMP PAID
(points)
Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.
They walk a bit, until;
STAMP PAID
Well?
BABY SUGGS
Well what?
STAMP PAID
This Saturday - you coming to Call or
what?
BABY SUGGS
If I call them, and they come what on
earth am I going to say to them.
STAMP PAID
Say the Word!
Two whitemen raking leaves look up at the sound of Stamp
Paid's voice, which was too loud. So he whispers;
STAMP PAID
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
BABY SUGGS
That's the last thing they took from me.
STAMP PAID
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't
nobody Call like you. You have to be
there.
BABY SUGGS
What I have to do is get in my bed and
lay down. I want to fix on something
harmless in this world.
STAMP PAID
What world are you talking about? Ain't
nothing harmless down here.
BABY SUGGS
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow
neither.
STAMP PAID
You getting into bed to think about
yellow?
BABY SUGGS
I likes yellow.
STAMP PAID
Then what? When you get through with blue
and yellow, then what?
BABY SUGGS
Can't say. It's something can't be
planned.
STAMP PAID
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
BABY SUGGS
No, Stamp. I ain't.
STAMP PAID
You saying whitefolks won. That what you
saying?
BABY SUGGS
Those white things have taken all I had
or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck
in this world 'cept for white folks..They
just don't know when to stop.
STAMP PAID
You saying nothing counts?
BABY SUGGS
I'm saying they came into my yard.
STAMP PAID
You saying God give up? Nothing left for
us but pour out our own blood?
BABY SUGGS
I'm saying they came into my yard.
STAMP PAID
You punishing Him, ain't you?
BABY SUGGS
Not like He punished me.
STAMP PAID
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
BABY SUGGS
Was a time I knew what was.
STAMP PAID
You still know.
BABY SUGGS
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman
hauling shoes.
STAMP PAID
Aw, Baby.
He stops her, before the Twin Chestnuts of the Tucker house.
STAMP PAID
We have to be steady. "These things too
will pass". What you looking for? A
miracle?
BABY SUGGS
No. I'm looking for what I was put here
to look for: the back door.
They exchange a look of silence and finality. She turns and
walks to the back door of the house and knocks. A moment
later a White Woman appears, takes the carpetbag and keeps
Baby waiting on the back steps while she goes in for a dime.
Baby rests on the railing until the whitewoman returns.
MEMORY END.
Now, Stamp Paid feels the need to find out what's going on
inside 124 since he caused Paul to leave. He approaches the
porch, then the front door. He raises his hands to knock -
but he can't bring himself to do it.
He turns to walk away then stops. He turns back and with a
force of will, KNOCKS LOUDLY upon the door. No answer. He
KNOCKS AGAIN. Still no answer.
He steps back, trying to sense if anyone's there. He turns to
leave when he sees;
TWO HEADS in the window. Denver and Beloved. Denver bolts
away, but Beloved remains a moment longer - looking in Stamp
Paid's eye, then disappearing into the house.
Stamp Paid is unnerved by her look.
Sethe is walking home to her daughters. There is a serene,
introverted expression on her face...as if she were detached
from the world around her, safe inside. We hear her thoughts:
SETHE (VO)
Beloved, she my daughter...She mine. She
come back to me of her own free will and
I don't have to explain a thing.. She had
to be safe and I put her where I knew she
would be. But my love was tough and she
back now. She come back to me in the
flesh...I won't never let her go. I'll
explain to her, even though I don't have
to. Why I did it. How if I hadn't killed
her she would have died and that is
something I couldn't let happen to her.
When I explain she'll understand, cause
she understands everything already..And
she ain't even mad...When I put that
headstone up I wanted to lay in there
with you, put your head on my shoulder
and keep you warm and I would have if
Bulgar and Howard and Denver didn't need
me, because my mind was homeless then. I
couldn't lay down with you then. No
matter how much I wanted to. I couldn't
lay down nowhere in peace, back then. Now
I can. I can sleep like the drowned, have
mercy. She come back to me, my daughter,
DENVER'S VOICE OVER FADES IN OVER SETHE'S....
SETHE (VO)
DENVER
my Beloved and she
Beloved is my
is mine....
sister...
DENVER (VO)
..and she is mine...
FADE TO;
Beloved, waiting for Sethe to come home, sees her
approaching. We hear her thoughts:
BELOVED (VO)
I am not separate from her. There is no
place where I stop. Her face is my own
and I want to be there in the place where
her face is and to be looking at it
too...a hot thing..In the beginning I
could see her. I could not help her
because the clouds were in the way. But I
could see her. The shining in her ears. I
look hard at her so she will know that
the clouds are in the way..I cannot lose
her again. I see her face which is mine.
It is the face that was going to smile at
me in the place where we crouched before
I come up out of the blue water. Sethe's
is the face that left me. Sethe's sees me
in her and I see the smile. She is my
face smiling at me. It is the face I
lost. Now we can join..a hot thing.
Sethe comes to the waiting Beloved and smiles. She offers her
hand and Beloved rises. Denver exits to them and smiles. She
extends her hand to Beloved's free hand. The three women
stand astride each other, arms around each other's waist as
they walk toward the porch...
The dusk sunlight creates THREE SHADOWS - three figures
holding each other the way Sethe saw the shadows at the
carnival...Only they weren't Hers, Denver's and Paul's...They
were Hers, Denver's and Beloved's....
CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM THE FRONT DOOR, NOW LOCKED AGAINST THE
WORLD, IN A SLOW MOVE....AS WE HEAR A BLEND OF THE THREE
WOMEN'S VOICES - THE OVERLAPPING, HAUNTED THOUGHTS OF THE
LIVING...
THREE WOMAN (VO)
BELOVED..YOU ARE MY SISTER..YOU ARE MY
DAUGHTER. YOU ARE MY FACE..YOU ARE ME..I
HAVE FOUND YOU AGAIN..I WAITED FOR
YOU..YOU ARE MY BELOVED. DON'T LOVE HER
TOO MUCH...YOU MY BEST THING.. YOU ARE
MINE..YOU ARE MINE..YOU ARE MINE...
BY THE TIME THE CAMERA REACHES BLUESTONE ROAD, THE VOICES ARE
MIXED, UNDECIPHERABLE YET AUDIBLE...
...AUDIBLE TO STAMP PAID, WHO STANDS ON BLUESTONE RD.
LISTENING TO THE HAUNTED VOICES OF 124.
HE IS FRIGHTENED.
FADE -OUT.
FADE- IN:
A cold day. Paul D. sits against the church drinking from a
bottle when a voice causes him to look up;
STAMP PAID
Howdy.
Stamp has his hands in his pockets, moving about.
PAUL
You got any more newspaper in that pocket
for me, just a waste of time. Ain't
interested.
Stamp sits beside him.
STAMP PAID
This is hard for me. But I got to do it.
Two things I got to say to you. I'm a
take the easy one first.
PAUL
(laughs)
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead.
(he drinks)
STAMP PAID
I come looking for you to ask your
pardon. Apologize.
PAUL
For what?
STAMP PAID
You pick any house, any house where
colored live. Pick any one and you
welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing
'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But
you welcome anywhere you want to be. My
house. John and Ella. Miss Lady
Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got
to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for
each and every night.
PAUL
Well I...I did get offered one place but
I just wanted to be off by myself a
spell.
STAMP PAID
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought
everybody gone crazy.
PAUL
Just me.
STAMP PAID
You planning to do anything about it?
PAUL
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
He drinks from the bottle like an angry, broken man. It stabs
at Stamp's heart to see him like this.
A WHITE MAN in a horse and wagon drives up the path leading
to the church. He leans stops before them and leans forward;
WHITE MAN
Hey!!
STAMP PAID
(on his feet)
Yes sir.
WHITE MAN
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works
over by the slaughterhouse. Said she
lived on Plank Road.
STAMP PAID
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways.
Mile, maybe.
WHITE MAN
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the
slaughterhouse.
STAMP PAID
No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road.
'Bout a mile up thataway.
Paul drinks from the bottle. The White Man addresses him.
WHITE MAN
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I
guess this here's a church or used to be.
Seems to me like you ought to show it
some respect, you follow me?
STAMP PAID
Yes sir..You right about that. That's
just what I come over to talk to him
about. Just that..
Paul offers no response. The White Man clicks his tongue and
drives off. Stamp breathes a sigh of relief.
PAUL
You remember your price, Stamp?
STAMP PAID
Never found out.
PAUL
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always
wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for
my brother Paul F. Must of been more than
nine hundred dollars cause she use that
money for Sweet Home for almost two
years. But then they hung my other
brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess
he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what
was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't
surprised when I found out they tracked
down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her
price must have been higher than all of
us - her being property that reproduced
itself without cost. A breeder.
STAMP PAID
No use thinking these things now.
PAUL
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our
price in the future? How are children's
children's children gonna know what they
cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are
they gonna pay for us, if we free?
STAMP PAID
Children ain't gonna need to know that
kind of thing.
PAUL
They'll know. They'll know as soon as
they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp.
It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down.
Schoolteacher didn't just change the
outside, he changed the mind..and the
blood..and what it carries...and what
it's worth..
STAMP PAID
I don't believe that. I won't.
PAUL
There was a rooster named Mister down at
Sweet Home. Last time I saw Halle, with
that butter all over his face and me with
an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister -
sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like
king on a throne. He was a hateful thing.
Bloody and evil..But he was better than
me.
Mister was allowed to be and stay
what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd
be cooking a rooster named Mister. But
wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D.
again..Schoolteacher changed me. Was
never no beating under Mr. Garner.
Schoolteacher changed that. Why wouldn't
a man run from that? Why wouldn't a man
not work, kill, starve, pull out his own
heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling
that? And it strikes me, it's got to be
cause we were something else. And that
something was less than a chicken sitting
in the sun on a tub.
He drinks.
STAMP PAID
I said I had two things to say to you. I
only told you one. I have to tell you the
other.
PAUL
I don't want to know.
STAMP PAID
I was there Paul D...There in the yard.
When she did it.
PAUL
What yard? When who-
And then Paul realizes he's talking of Sethe.
PAUL
Jesus.
STAMP PAID
It ain't what you think.
PAUL
You don't know what I think.
STAMP PAID
She ain't crazy. She love those children.
She was trying to outhurt the hurter's
all.
PAUL
Leave off..
STAMP PAID
She was only-
PAUL
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when
she was a girl. She scares me and I knew
her when she was a girl...
STAMP PAID
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't
believe you.
PAUL
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl
in her house scares me.
STAMP PAID
Who is she? Where she come from?
PAUL
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a
stump.
STAMP PAID
She what run you off? Not what I told you
'bout Sethe?
Paul thinks a moment. Then, tears brimming in his eyes:
PAUL
Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this
one thing. How much is a nigger supposed
to take?
STAMP PAID
All he can. All he can.
PAUL
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
FADE OUT;
FADE IN;
SPRING.
The sun shines on a warm April day..a day abundant with
growth and renewed hope.
But a shadow appears to be hovering over 124. It looks more
worn than before...neglected, abused.
A broken window...the front door off it's hinge...a front
step splintered and dangerous.
Denver opens the door, then pushes the broken screen door off
it's hinge. She closes the door behind her.
She begins her walk from the porch to the road. The first
time she's ever gone alone..not knowing what she will face
beyond the perimeters of her home.
She reaches Bluestone Road and stops. She looks in either
direction and sees not a soul. She takes a breath.
She begins to walk - to get help.
A block from the house, TWO BLACK MEN turn a corner and walk
towards her.
Denver stops, frightened, not knowing what to do.
The TWO BLACK MEN pass her, tipping their hats, saying;
TWO BLACK MAN
Morning...Morning..
And they walk by. Denver's eyes speak the gratitude she never
got her mouth open in time to reply. Heartened by the
encounter, she picks up speed.
LADY JONES - a light-skinned black woman with gray eyes and
yellow woolly hair - opens the door to find Denver.
LADY JONES
Why Denver..Look at you.
Denver manages to smile.
LADY JONES
It's been so long. It's so nice of you to
come see me. What brings you?
Unfortunately, Denver can't manage anything beyond the smile.
LADY JONES
Well, never mind - nobody needs a reason
to visit. Let me make us some tea. Come
on.
Lady Jones takes her by the hand and leads her inside.
Denver exits the house because she sees something unusual in
the yard;
POV - THE STUMP;
On the same stump that Beloved first appeared, sits A BASKET
OF EGGS. Denver crosses to it, lifts it and a PAPER flutters
to the ground. She reads it;
M. LUCILLE WILLIAMS...
Denver returns the empty basket to M. Lucille Williams.
DENVER
Thank you.
M. LUCILLE
WILLIAMS
Your welcome..
Upon the stump, sits a plate of cold rabbit meat, which
Denver brings inside.
A white family home in a white Ohio neighborhood.
JANEY WAGON, a benevolent black servant woman, opens the back
door for Denver.
JANEY
Yes?
DENVER
May I come in?
JANEY
What you want?
DENVER
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
JANEY
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister,
darlin.
DENVER
Oh.
JANEY
What you want'em for?
DENVER
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they
might know of some.
JANEY
(smiles)
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
DENVER
Yes ma'am.
JANEY
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
DENVER
Yes ma'am..
JANEY
Well, come on in. You letting in flies.
Denver is sitting on the stump waiting for Mr. Bodwin when
she hears;
THIRTY WOMEN, gathered together, walking up Bluestone Rd.
towards 124, SINGING A HOLY SONG;
Denver is amazed by the sight as the women position
themselves right in front of 124 - armed with bibles,
crucifixes and whatever other symbols of heavenly power they
could find.
The women continue singing.
CUT TO:
MR. BODWIN, sitting on a wagon pulled by a horse, is riding
toward 124 when he hears the singing as well.
WE NOTICE THAT MR. BODWIN IS WEARING A HAT SIMILAR TO THE ONE
SCHOOLTEACHER WORE on that fateful day.
CUT BACK TO:
The women continue singing as:
Sethe and Beloved, her belly as big as a pregnant woman's,
exit the house.
The women are stunned by the sight and slightly confused by
the lack of fear between the women.
Sethe is holding Beloved's hand. Beloved is smiling brightly
at the beautiful singing.
Denver looks to her mother;
Tears run down Sethe's face but she is not crying. The sound
of the women's voices wash over her like a baptism. She looks
to all the women, faces she remembers, faces she has missed
although up until this moment was not conscious of missing.
Then, Sethe looks beyond the women and sees:
MR. BODWIN APPROACHING IN HIS WAGON. SHE SEES MR. BODWIN
WEARING A HAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SCHOOLTEACHERS.
Sethe's expression turns to fear, then rage. In her ravaged
mind, she thinks it is Schoolteacher coming back...
SETHE
No...No, he's not coming into my yard. He
not taking my best thing...No..
She releases Beloved's hand and moves forward...
SETHE
No...no...no..
DENVER
Mama?
She passes Denver, feeling for the ICE PICK IN HER APRON.
SETHE
No...NO..NO..NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
As Mr. Bodwin reaches the thirty women who separate him from
124. HIS EYES FOCUS IN WONDER ON THE NAKED BELOVED AS;
SETHE RUNS TOWARDS HIM AND THE WOMEN, HER HAND EXTENDED
HOLDING THE ICE PICK..
DENVER
MAMA...NOOOOOOO!
DENVER RUNS AFTER HER. SETHE REACHES THE WOMEN AND LUNGES FOR
BODWIN BUT THE WOMEN SEIZE HER, CREATING A HILL OF BLACK
PEOPLE. SETHE RISING TO THE TOP, HER HAND EXTENDED. DENVER
REACHING HER FROM BEHIND, PULLING HER BACK AND PUNCHING HER
OUT COLD AS THE BODIES FALL AROUND THEM....
Beloved watches from the house - watches Sethe attack and
defend with the ice pick.
And something within her is
resolved. For a moment, we see a calm spirit instead of a
wild animal. And a tear upon her face..
Then, just as quickly, she sprints around the side of the
house and disappears from view.
The Women try to help Sethe as Denver cries for her mother.
Mr. Bodwin looks on stunned.
WIDE ANGLE - OF A NAKED BLACK WOMAN WITH A FULL BELLY RUNNING
THROUGH AN OPEN FIELD, REACHING THE WOODS THEN DISAPPEARING
INTO THE TREES......
FADE OUT;
FADE IN:
Paul D. is on his way to work when he sees;
A poised, confident Denver walking in the opposite direction.
She spots him and smiles;
DENVER
Good morning, Paul D.
Paul is clearly impressed by the sight of her.
PAUL
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
DENVER
Don't pay to complain.
PAUL
You on your way home?
DENVER
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt
factory. Figure between that and my night
work at the Bodwins I might be able to
put something away for me and mama.
PAUL
They treating you right over at the
Bodwins?
DENVER
More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she
teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I
might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting
on me.
Paul smiles - wanting to warn her but deciding not to spoil
the possibilities that lay before her.
PAUL
Your mother all right?
DENVER
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten
out of bed since that day.
PAUL
You think I should stop by? Think she'd
welcome it?
DENVER
I don't know. I think I've lost my
mother, Paul D.
Silence.
PAUL
That girl...You know, Beloved...
DENVER
Yes?
PAUL
She gone like they say?
DENVER
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella
thinks she might be waiting in the woods
for another chance but..I don't think so.
Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she
can feel it.
PAUL
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
DENVER
At times. At other times I think she
was...more. But who would know that
better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough
you her.
She levels her eyes at him and he knows what she means.
PAUL
Well, if you want my opinion...
DENVER
I don't. I have my own.
PAUL
You grown.
DENVER
Yes sir
PAUL
Well, good luck with the job.
DENVER
Thank you.
They pass each other until Denver turns back;
DENVER
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way,
but be careful how you talk to my mama,
hear?
PAUL
I will.
Paul watches her walk away. He watches as a YOUNG BLACK MAN
runs towards her shouting;
YOUNG MAN
Hey, Miss Denver..Wait up!
He watches as the two young people, the future, walk
together.
A beautiful, sunny day. The clearing is full. Everyone looks
bright and hopeful. Dressed in bright, summer clothes...
A robust Baby Suggs is on her rock giving her best Call, as
camera pans the crowd of faces eager to believe ....
BABY SUGGS
..The only grace we can have, is the
grace we can imagine. If you cannot see
it, you will not have it...Here, in this
place, we are flesh. Flesh that weeps,
laughs, dances on bare feet in the grass.
Love it. Love it hard. Yonder they do not
love your flesh. They despise it. They
flay it. O, my people, they do not love
your hands. Those they only use, tie,
bind, chop off and leave empty, Love your
hands. Love them. Raise them up and kiss
them. Touch others with them, put them
together, stroke them on your face 'cause
they don't love that either. You
got to
love it. You. Yonder out there, they
ain't in love with your moth. They will
see it broken and break it again. What
you say out of it, they will not heed.
What you scream from it they do not hear.
No, they don't love your mother. You got
to love it. And the feet that need to
rest and to dance. The backs that needs
support. The shoulders that need arms,
strong arms I'm telling you! O my people,
out yonder they don't love your neck
unnoosed and straight. So love your neck;
put a hand on it, grace it, stroke it and
hold it up. Love all your inside parts,
love 'em..and the beating heart, love
that too. More than eyes or feet. More
than lungs that have yet to draw free
air, love your heart. For this is the
prize.
And with her twisted, broken old body BABY SUGGS BEGINS TO
DANCE AND TWIRL UP ON HER ROCK.
And the crowd gives her music, SINGING IN FOUR PART HARMONY.
CAMERA PANS THE CROWD OF BEAUTIFUL FACES singing together.
Among the crowd, we see FAMILIAR FACES...
WE SEE THE WOMEN WHO SANG AT 124...
WE STAMP PAID, ELLA, JOHN, and LADY JONES...
AND WE SEE SETHE, SURROUNDED BY ALL HER CHILDREN.
FADE OUT.
THE END
Beloved
