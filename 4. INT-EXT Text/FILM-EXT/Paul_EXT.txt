Caption: Bethlehem Creek, Wyoming 10:19pm 28/07/47
The air is filled with the sounds of a warm, summer night. A
light comes on in a FARMHOUSE window. The door opens, a small
dog and a young girl emerge.
GIRL
Go on now Paul, don't be long.
The dog trots out across the property. It stops to scratch.
The sounds of night cease. The dog stops scratching, sniffing
the air, cocking its head, sensing something. We hear a low
humming sounds. The dog looks up. We see a soft orange glow
reflected in its eyes. The dog whimpers
Back at the farmhouse, a deep, dull thud shakes the ground,
bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda. An orange
glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness.
GIRL
Paul... Paul?
The girl draws near, illuminated by the orange glow.
GIRL
Paul?!
The glow fades again.
MUSIC: "The Boy In The Bubble" by Paul Simon.
TITLE: PAUL
GRAHAM WILLY (32) and CLIVE GOLLINGS (33) stand in the
blazing San Diego sunshine, waiting to cross the road. GRAHAM
is thin but his clothes seem too small. He has long greasy
hair, buck teeth and thick glasses. CLIVE is bigger and wears
a long black leather coat, Red Dwarf T-shirt and boots. His
hair is densely curly and shaped like a pyramid.
Four people dressed as BORG from Star Trek pass by. GRAHAM
and CLIVE shrug derisively. The cross-walk beeps.
As the music kicks in, GRAHAM and CLIVE set off across the
road towards the San Diego Convention Centre. They make their
way through a throng of costumed Comic-Con attendees.
The boys stand, waiting for their transport. We see them from
across the road. A tiny old car splutters up to the curb. A
valet gets out and hands the keys to CLIVE.
VALET
There you go.
GRAHAM
That's not ours.
VALET
No?
CLIVE
No, that's ours.
A large RV pulls up. A 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial. Top of
the range in its day. Still looks good.
VALET
Oh.
GRAHAM and CLIVE run off toward the RV. The four BORG from
the previous day approach the VALET and exchange the key to
the car for some small change. The BORG drive off.
VALET
Fucking Borg.
(giving the finger)
Assimilate this!
The RV speeds past the disgruntled VALET. GRAHAM and CLIVE
can be heard whooping within.
9.
They drive in silence, surveying the landscape.
11.
CLIVE
Amazing, isn't it? There are
295,734,134 people in this country
and we haven't seen a soul for a
hundred miles. Where is everybody?
GRAHAM
What about that old woman on
crutches we saw hitchhiking?
CLIVE
Apart from her. I suppose that's
why they established the Dreamland
facility out here.
GRAHAM
Far from prying eyes.
CLIVE
Did you know the site was selected
in the mid-1950s for testing of the
U-2 spyplane, due to its
remoteness, proximity to existing
facilities and presence of a dry
lake bad for landings?
GRAHAM
Yes.
CLIVE
Oh.
GRAHAM
Shall we have a bite before or
after we hit the Black Mailbox?
CLIVE
Before.
GRAHAM boards the RV. CLIVE is in the driver's seat. The
engine is running.
CLIVE
What took you so long?
GRAHAM
I was putting the sticker on.
CLIVE
They were an odd pair, weren't
they?
GRAHAM
Definitely didn't speak Bocci.
CLIVE fires up the engine and jams it into reverse. CRUNCH.
GRAHAM (CONT'D)
That wasn't their truck was it?
CLIVE
No.
The RV roars off, leaving the car park and the black Lincoln
Escalade, shiny, mean, dented.
GRAHAM looks at a map. CLIVE drives, continually checking his
rear view.
GRAHAM
What's the matter?
CLIVE
Nothing. How we doing?
GRAHAM
We should be just about there.
They scan the roadside for a few seconds.
CLIVE
I've found it.
GRAHAM
Where?
17.
CLIVE
THERE!!!
The RV comes to a screeching halt. It sits in the road for a
moment, before it trundles onto the hard shoulder. The door
opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE appear wearing head mounted torches.
They wander over to a WHITE mailbox.
GRAHAM/CLIVE
(REVERENTIALLY)
The Black Mailbox.
GRAHAM and CLIVE marvel at it. The silence of the night and
the size of the landscape dawns on them. They look up.
CLIVE
It's amazing, isn't it? We're
actually here.
GRAHAM
Area 51.
CLIVE
Dreamland.
GRAHAM
The Groom Lake Military Test
Facility.
CLIVE
MacArthur's Black Mile.
GRAHAM
Is that a real one?
CLIVE
No, I made it up myself.
GRAHAM
I like it.
CLIVE
Be great if we saw something.
GRAHAM
Yes, imagine if we got buzzed up by
a craft.
CLIVE
That would be incredible. It just
sort of stops in the air and hovers
then just goes up really fast.
Whoosh.
18.
GRAHAM
What would you do if they actually
landed?
CLIVE
Keep it together. First contact is
a big responsibility. They come in
peace, we go to pieces? That's not
how I roll.
CLIVE looks at GRAHAM who is staring off, wide eyed.
CLIVE
What's wrong?
GRAHAM points off into the distance. HEADLIGHTS.
GRAHAM
It's them. They found us. I don't
know how but they found us.
CLIVE
Who? Who's found us?
GRAHAM
The Libyans!
CLIVE
Run for it Marty!
GRAHAM and CLIVE scramble for the RV.
GRAHAM and CLIVE step out of the RV and approach the car.
Inside are three unconscious men. One door is open.
CLIVE
Hello?
They wait for a few seconds. Nothing.
GRAHAM
Maybe you should call for help.
GRAHAM pulls out a cell phone and starts to dial.
VOICE (O.S.)
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
GRAHAM and CLIVE spin round to see an indistinct figure
sitting on a rock in the nearby darkness. The glow of a
cigarette briefly lights up what appear to be two large,
black eyes. GRAHAM and CLIVE gawp.
CLIVE
I rather think these men need help.
Graham, give me the phone.
GRAHAM passes the phone over.
VOICE
Seriously, I wouldn't do that.
GRAHAM's mouth falls open, CLIVE continues to hold the phone
to his ear. We hear the operator.
OPERATOR
911 Emergency. How may I direct
your call? Hello? Hello?
GRAHAM and CLIVE continue to gawp. The shape stand and steps
into the light. GRAHAM and CLIVE go slack. Standing in front
of them, clad only in cut-off short and flip-flops... is an
ALIEN.
ALIEN
Put - the phone - down.
Without the slightest change of expression CLIVE rocks
backwards in a dead faint. He hits the ground with a bump.
GRAHAM looks at CLIVE then back at the ALIEN. When GRAHAM
speaks his voice quivers with hysterical panic.
GRAHAM
What have you done to him?
21.
ALIEN
I didn't do anything. He fainted.
GRAHAM
Yes but you made him faint.
ALIEN
I did not. Okay I did, but it's not
like i set my phaser to "Faint'.
GRAHAM
You've got a phaser!?
ALIEN
No! Look, I need you to help. Can
you get this guy back onto your
wagon?
GRAHAM
Are you going to probe us?
ALIEN
No! Where does that come from? Why
do people always assume we want to
stick something up their ass?
GRAHAM
Don't you?
ALIEN
No. There's certainly nothing about
it in the encounter manual. As a
rule, we don't even abduct. Maybe
people find it easier to deal with
earthly transgressions if they
suppress it with absurd fantasies
about alien probing.
GRAHAM
What?
ALIEN
It's just a theory. Listen, focus
okay? I promise you I won't hurt
you, I just need your help.
GRAHAM
You need my help?
ALIEN
Yes.
GRAHAM
How come I can understand you? Are
you using some sort of neural
language router?
22.
ALIEN
No, I'm speaking English you prick.
(off GRAHAM's expression)
Sorry, I'm tense. Look, what's your
name?
GRAHAM
Graham Willy.
ALIEN
What about him?
GRAHAM
That's the writer, Clive Gollings.
ALIEN
Well, let's get Clive into the RV
and get going. I'll explain
everything on the way. Please.
GRAHAM
Where are we going?
ALIEN
North.
GRAHAM
The RV's gotta be back in 2 days.
ALIEN
Well, then we're gonna have to
hustle, aren't we?
GRAHAM
BUT-
ALIEN
Look Graham, you're just gonna have
to trust me, okay?
GRAHAM looks at the ALIEN. It stands at roughly 3 feet tall.
His black almond shaped eye glint. His large head tilts to
one side, his small mouth opens slightly, his long fingers
clasp together, pleading.
ALIEN
Please man, I need you.
GRAHAM considers the ALIEN for a moment.
GRAHAM
Okay then.
ALIEN
Great. Thank you.
GRAHAM
What's your name?
23.
ALIEN
I'm Paul.
GRAHAM
Paul?
PAUL
Yeah. Now let's get Cloverfield
onto the recreational vehicle and
get the fuck off MacArthur's Black
Mile.
They attempt to move CLIVE. PAUL senses something.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Oh man, has he...?
GRAHAM
I told him he should have gone.
PAUL
Could have been worse. Know what
I'm saying?
They drag him into the RV. The door shuts, a few seconds
later, GRAHAM appears and runs round to the back of the RV.
He rips the bumper sticker off and gets back on board. The RV
starts up and drives off.
GRAHAM drives, agitated. He looks behind him a couple of
times. PAUL is hunting around in the fridge.
PAUL
Can I have this ham?
GRAHAM
Uh... yes.
PAUL
Great!
PAUL starts to dangle strips of sandwich ham into his mouth,
wolfing it down hungrily.
GRAHAM
Paul? Where am I going again?
PAUL
I told you, North. Do you have a
map?
GRAHAM pulls the map. It obscures the wind shield.
PAUL
Not when we're driving, Graham.
24.
The map disappears back up into the roller.
GRAHAM
Sorry.
PAUL
Just head North. We need to get as
much distance as we can between us
and them.
GRAHAM
Them? Who's them?
We hear the noise of engines, then boots on concrete as a
dozen soldiers rush the area, attending the crash. A suited
man gets out of a Sedan car. We don't see his face at first.
The shot remains at his hip. He reaches into his pocket and
pulls out a Twinkie. He unwraps it and brings it up to his
mouth. We follow and see his face for the first time.
Chiselled, focused, confident. This is SPECIAL AGENT ZOIL. A
SOLDIER approaches.
CAPTAIN
Sir?
ZOIL
Talk to me.
CAPTAIN
Three survivors, company men, hurt
but alive.
ZOIL
Anyone else?
CAPTAIN
No sir.
ZOIL looks into the sky and breathes in the night air.
CAPTAIN
What's this?
The CAPTAIN motions to a patch of moisture near his feet.
ZOIL touches the wet patch and licks his finger.
CAPTAIN
What is it sir? Brake fluid? Gas?
ZOIL
No. It's neither of those things.
He looks around, then notices tire tracks in the dust by the
side of the road. ZOIL stands, full of purpose. He returns to
his car and hits a button on the dash.
25.
VOICE
What's the situation?
ZOIL
We have a guest who's left the
hotel without paying, sir.
VOICE
Damn it! Do you think he's "left'
left?
ZOIL
Doubtful. NORAD would have picked
up a bogie. Those guys can track
Santa. No sir, he's still here.
Question is, for how long?
VOICE
Don't you think this is all a bit
of a coincidence?
ZOIL
How so?
VOICE
I signed the red document this
morning, Zoil. Don't you think it's
odd that he chooses today to go
AWOL? How did he know?
ZOIL
Are you suggesting he has someone
on the inside.
VOICE
Maybe.
ZOIL
Well he's definitely got someone on
the outside.
VOICE
What?
ZOIL
Tire tracks, sir. Tire tracks...
among other things. I'd bet my left
nut that little bastard's hitched a
ride.
VOICE
Lock down the area. Road blocks,
spot checks, the whole nine yards.
You're going to handle this
personally, Zoil. I want this
wrapped up before Letterman.
26.
Close on the wheel. Pull out to reveal the RV.
Inside, CLIVE's eyes open. From the bathroom, CLIVE can hear
the sound of someone noisily emptying their bladder. He
notices his jeans have been pegged up to dry. He leans out to
see GRAHAM in the driving seat, then looks back at the
bathroom door. The toilet flushes.
CLIVE pretends to be asleep as the door opens. A pair of
skinny grey legs in cut-off shorts pass the bunk.
PAUL
The bulb's gone in there.
CLIVE gets up silently and wraps his black towel around his
middle. He creeps toward the front of the RV. GRAHAM drives,
PAUL sits in the Chewie seat eating pistachios.
PAUL
I hate it when you get the closed
ones, right?
GRAHAM
I usually bite them open.
PAUL
Are you fucking insane? You gotta
tap "em and if they don't open you
throw them away.
GRAHAM
That's molluscs.
PAUL
Shut up.
GRAHAM
It's true.
(NOTICES CLIVE)
Hello Clive! How are you feeling?
CLIVE
I'm feeling like I've gone MENTAL
MAD, Graham. If that is your name?
You're happily sitting there
chatting to... to... that, like
it's the most natural thing in the
world. The two of you laughing away
like you haven't seen each other
since 1990.
PAUL spits a shell out into a cup.
27.
CLIVE (CONT'D)
So forgive me if I seem a little
rattled but from where I'm standing
it would appear you are trading nut
knowledge with an alien life form.
GRAHAM
His name is Paul.
CLIVE
Oh, Paul is it? Paul what? Paul
Verhoven? Paul Freeman? Paul
Reiser?
PAUL
Just Paul. You know, like Madonna
or Dracula.
GRAHAM
Paul's from a small planet in the
northern spiral arm of the
Andromeda Galaxy.
CLIVE
No he is not!
PAUL
I am man, seriously.
CLIVE
How could he possibly have
travelled that distance?
PAUL
Wormhole.
CLIVE
Balls! Graham, this isn't what it
seems. What about Ocham's Razor?
GRAHAM
The hairdressers?
CLIVE
Yes, the old man who owns it told
me that, in unbelievable
circumstances, the most plausible
explanation is usually the truth.
PAUL
And what's the most plausible
explanation, Clive?
CLIVE
That you're a thin midget in an
alien costume.
28.
PAUL
There's no such thing as a thin
midget? Those guys are built. Have
you not seen The Station Agent?
GRAHAM
He's right. I think that's less
believable than Paul being form a
planet in the norther spiral arm of
the Andromeda Galaxy.
CLIVE (CONT'D)
Oh really?
With this CLIVE grabs at PAUL. He pulls at the alien's skin,
trying to gain a hold of a mask.
PAUL
Ow! Get off me!
CLIVE
You're not real. You're not real!
GRAHAM
Excuse me.
PAUL
Get off me, you fucking psycho!
GRAHAM
EXCUSE ME!
CLIVE releases PAUL and looks out of the RV to see the
flashing lights of a road block. GRAHAM slows down.
CLIVE
Oh shit!
CLIVE looks round to discover that PAUL has vanished. GRAHAM
pulls the RV onto the hard shoulder.
CLIVE
Where's he gone?
GRAHAM
Maybe he beamed up.
CLIVE
As if. We would have seen the
classic shimmer and hum.
GRAHAM
Good point.
BANG, BANG, BANG!
GRAHAM and CLIVE look to the door. Both terrified.
29.
GRAHAM and CLIVE stand outside the RV being questioned by an
AGENT dressed like ZOIL. We can hear noise and activity from
the RV. Another AGENT is aboard the RV.
AGENT 1
Where you boys from? Australia?
CLIVE
Britain.
AGENT 1
Ah. G'day mate.
The AGENT smiles. GRAHAM and CLIVE look terrified.
AGENT 1
Whatcha doin' in the US fellas?
CLIVE/GRAHAM
Comic-con.
AGENT 1
You're a long way from San Diego.
CLIVE
We were having a little drive.
AGENT 1
Is that right?
AGENT 2 (O.S.)
Hey Haggard?!
HAGGARD
Yeah?
O'REILLY appears at the door waving a 10x8" photograph.
O'REILLY
These guys have met Michael Biehn.
HAGGARD
No shit! How was he?
CLIVE
He was a good egg.
GRAHAM
Very unaffected.
HAGGARD
That's nice to hear.
(TO AGENT 2)
O'Reilly? Anything else?
30.
O'REILLY
Just some pissy jeans.
HAGGARD looks down at the towel wrapped around CLIVE's waits.
CLIVE look embarrassed.
HAGGARD
Okay, you guys can go.
CLIVE
Thank you. May I ask what you're
searching for?
HAGGARD
Of course you may.
There is a slight pause. GRAHAM and CLIVE board the RV.
GRAHAM and CLIVE pull away in silence. They are both confused
and shaken.
CLIVE
Well, it's pretty obvious what
happened there, isn't it?
GRAHAM
Is it?
CLIVE
Yes, the government used some sort
of neurotoxic paint on the Black
Mailbox, which was white by the
way, and it caused us to suffer a
shared hallucination about an
alien. I mean, it's what we've
always wanted, isn't it?
GRAHAM
I suppose so.
CLIVE
Than that's what happened.
PAUL materializes from thin air behind them.
PAUL
WRONG!
The sound of screeching tires draws the attention of the two
AGENTS. They see the RV swerve across the road in the
distance before righting itself and continuing on its way.
31.
We hear GRAHAM squeal with delight. The RV guns up the road
into the night.
The door to the RV opens, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out onto the
forecourt, trying to look as casual as they can.
CLIVE
Ready?
GRAHAM
Ready.
HOOOONNNNNKKKK! GRAHAM and CLIVE jump.
PAUL (O.S.)
Get me some more peanut M&Ms.;
GRAHAM goes into the store, CLIVE to the pumps. A POLICE
CRUISER pulls onto the forecourt. CLIVE goes pale and fumbles
the nozzle back into the pump. He walks toward the checkout
as a STATE TROOPER exits his car. No matter how hard he
tries, CLIVE cannot avoid reaching the door at the same time
as the STATE TROOPER. He is tall, wide and bald.
STATE TROOPER
After you.
CLIVE
Thanks.
38.
Close up on O'REILLY. He covers his face with his hands.
O'REILLY
Coming... ready or not!
O'REILLY uncovers his eyes and comes face to face with ZOIL.
ZOIL is eating an orange, he offers a segment to O'REILLY.
ZOIL
Orange?
O'REILLY
No thanks.
ZOIL
Nice and juicy.
O'REILLY
I don't want to spoil breakfast.
ZOIL
Do you mind telling me what's going
on, Agent?
O'REILLY
Just keeping ourselves occupied
sir. Things are pretty slow.
ZOIL
Where's the other one?
O'REILLY
I don't know, let's see. Haggard?
HAGGARD steps out from behind the only man shaped cactus on
the entire desert plain. O'REILLY can't help but let out a
snort of delighted surprise. HAGGARD hurries over.
HAGGARD
Sorry, I was just... hiding.
ZOIL
I see. You fellas had much traffic
through here?
HAGGARD
Just a big RV driven by a couple of
nerds.
ZOIL
Nerds, huh?
HAGGARD
Yeah, they'd been to Comic-Con and
met Michael Biehn.
39.
ZOIL
I've heard he's nice.
HAGGARD
Good egg.
O'REILLY
Very unaffected.
ZOIL
Did you search the vehicle
thoroughly?
O'REILLY
Yes sir.
ZOIL
Find anything?
O'REILLY
Not really. Just Michael Biehn's
autograph and some pissy jeans.
Close in on ZOIL. He seems suddenly motivated.
ZOIL
Did you get the license plate?
HAGGARD and O'REILLY look sheepish.
ZOIL
Make?
More sheepishness.
HAGGARD
It was big.
ZOIL
I want everything you can remember.
Descriptions of the occupants,
height, hair, distinguishing
features. We can do it on the way.
HAGGARD
On the way?
ZOIL
You're coming with me.
O'REILLY
What about the road block sir?
ZOIL
It didn't work.
40.
The boys hurry across the forecourt past the cop car, we hear
the radio spring to life as they pass.
POLICE CONTROLLER
All units, be on the lookout for a
cream and brown Recreational
Vehicle, no plate number at this
time. Officers are advised to
contain but not board. Dean, if you
still at Gas and Go, bring back a
quart a milk and a box of doughnut
holes? Dean?
GRAHAM and CLIVE stop and stare, listening intently.
HOOOOOOONNNNNNKKKKK!
The door to the RV swings open, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out.
The desert road is silent. We can see for miles. On the road
lies a yellow and black bird, it is very dead.
PAUL
Fuck, that made me jump.
CLIVE
Ah yes, the waspish markings of a
Scott's Oriole. Unmistakable.
PAUL
What a waste.
GRAHAM
Poor thing.
CLIVE
Nothing anyone could've done.
PAUL looks at them, then scoops the bird up in his hands.
GRAHAM
What are you doing?
PAUL closes his eyes. His skin ripples with color as he sways
slightly. The bird's eyes flicker, its head lifts, it opens
its beak and tweets. GRAHAM and CLIVE are astounded by what
they are seeing.
GRAHAM
It's a miracle!
43.
PAUL stuff the bird in his mouth with a grotesque crunch.
PAUL
I'll miss these.
CLIVE
Why would you do that?
PAUL
I'm not gonna eat a dead bird, am
I?
ZOIL and his men are parked on the forecourt of the gas
station. ZOIL is talking to the STATE TROOPER and CHRIS.
STATE TROOPER
By the time I got the bulletin,
they were long gone. Seemed like
nice fellas to me.
CHRIS
Is it true they was Muslims?
STATE TROOPER
They said they were British.
ZOIL
I think you can be both.
CHRIS
Jesus Cheeeeerist!
HAGGARD
Agent Zoil?
ZOIL
Excuse me gentlemen.
ZOIL leaves with the two men and returns to his vehicle. The
voice of ZOIL's superior cuts the air.
VOICE
Report.
ZOIL
We've tracked them down to a gas
station in Ely.
VOICE
So why am I not witting with my
feet up, smoking a jay, watching
Erin Brockovich?
ZOIL
We think he may be travelling in an
RV with two British men sir.
44.
VOICE
Goddamnit, I knew we should have
gone ahead with invasion in "44.
What are they, MI6?
ZOIL
No, sir. Just a couple of nerds on
the lamb from Comic-Con.
VOICE
Shit. My sister's kid went to that.
Little Manga faggot.
ZOIL
I still think this stinks, sir.
VOICE
Like fat man doo-doo. It's too much
of a coincidence. He sits tight for
60 years and then suddenly now he
decides to take off. If he wanted
to go home so bad, he could've just
given us the slip when he was
playing golf with J. Edgar Hoover.
ZOIL
Someone must have told him. We need
to find the rat.
VOICE
Leave that to me. In the meantime,
if E.T. is still M.I.A. in the P.M.
then F.Y.I. I'm tearing someone a
new A. O.K.?
ZOIL
Yes sir.
RUTH is walking back to a static mobile home. From the RV we
hear GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp. RUTH furrows her brow, turns
back, and goes inside.
QUICK CUTS as GRAHAM and CLIVE hook up power and water to the
RV and prepare a small BBQ.
CLIVE is squirting lighter fluid over a fire. He flicks his
tongue out, summoning the flames higher. PAUL materializes
nearby, making CLIVE jump. He composes himself.
52.
PAUL
Hello Clive. From the squirting of
the gas and the flicking of the
tongue, am I do assume you're a
Hendrix fan?
CLIVE
I am actually, yes.
PAUL
I met him once.
CLIVE
Really?
PAUL
Yeah. Nice man, really soft, He
thought I was a hallucination.
Shame what happened to him.
CLIVE
All the good ones die.
PAUL
Meanwhile Bryan Adams releases
album seventeen.
PAUL and CLIVE share a laugh.
CLIVE
So you've been here for 60 years?
PAUL
I know, right? Time flies when
you're confined to a U.S. military
installation.
CLIVE
Why did you come to earth?
PAUL
I'm the vanguard of a highly
aggressive invading force.
CLIVE
What?!
PAUL
I'm fucking with you, man. I was on
a science mission actually.
Meteorological reconnaissance. We
were surveying atmospheric
conditions on CO2 spiking, M-Class
planets. My specialist subject is
tornadoes right? So I'm buzzing
around the mid-west, looking for
twisters and all of a sudden my
A.G.G. goes offline and I crash in
the middle of some field.
(MORE)
53.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Next thing I know, this little girl
is pulling me out of the wreck and
then a bunch of army guys come
along and cart me off to Area 52.
CLIVE
51.
PAUL
No, it's 52. Area 51 is just full
of old Pan Am jets and mini disc
players and shit. It's another
"clever subterfuge."
GRAHAM joins them with the food.
PAUL
Just telling him about Area 52.
GRAHAM
Ha ha yeah.
PAUL
So, with my cover blown and the
natives cautious but friendly, I
figured we might as well indulge in
a little file sharing.
CLIVE
Mulder was right!
PAUL
Mulder was my idea.
They chuckle. CLIVE gives PAUL the bottle of gas.
CLIVE
Would you like a go?
PAUL takes the bottle and squirts it on the fire, making the
Hendrix face. They laugh loudly.
RUTH watches through her window. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL are
on the other side of the RV. Nevertheless, RUTH can see three
pairs of dancing legs underneath the vehicle, silhouetted
against the campfire. She frowns.
MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
RUTH!
RUTH backs away into the shadows.
54.
PAUL burst out of the BEHE RESIDENCE, pursued by MOSES who is
loading a shotgun.
PAUL
GO! GO! GO!
The RV start to move forward. The door swings open and GRAHAM
appears, beckoning to PAUL. PAUL reaches the door, just as
MOSES levels the gun at his target. PAUL leaps into GRAHAM's
arms, disappearing inside the RV, as MOSES fires off a
booming shot. The BEHE mailbox explodes into pieces, as the
RV careens off out of the trailer park.
THREE BLACK SEDANS are parked in the BEHE RV park.
MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
I didn't call the government. I
called the po-lice.
ZOIL's radio crackles to life.
HAGGARD (O.S.)
Man, that way was one fat freak!
O'REILLY (O.S.)
If I was that girl, I think I'd
rather take my chances with the
alien.
HAGGARD and O'REILLY hoot with laughter.
ZOIL
Can it, you two! How many times do
I have to tell you?
MOSES in his pick up truck, screams off in pursuit.
64.
RUTH is storming up the road.
GRAHAM
Ruth!
RUTH
Leave me alone!
GRAHAM
Ruth, please stop, I've got shin
splints.
RUTH stops. GRAHAM catches up to her.
65.
GRAHAM
Are you alright?
RUTH
He can't be from space. It's not
possible.
GRAHAM
Ruth, you saw for yourself. It's
not just possible, it's probably.
There's probably millions of
intelligent civilizations.
RUTH
So, where is everybody?
GRAHAM
Well, one of them is right there.
RUTH and GRAHAM look back at the RV. PAUL is stood on the
dashboard with his bare buttocks pressed against the window.
CLIVE is trying not to laugh.
RUTH
Everything I've ever been told is a
lie. My purpose. My truth. All
false. DO you know how that feels?
To suddenly have nothing?
GRAHAM
Just because your truth wasn't the
truth, it doesn't mean there is no
truth, Ruth.
RUTH
Huh?
GRAHAM
I understand you're probably
feeling very confused right now.
Religious belief systems are
devised to give us context and
security. To stop us feeling lonely
and unimportant.
RUTH
I do feel lonely and unimportant!
How can this all be an accident? It
doesn't make sense. Did you know
the reason we have solar eclipses
is because the sun is exactly 400
times bigger than the moon and the
moon is exactly 400 times closer to
the earth?
GRAHAM considers saying "yes' but decides against it.
RUTH
How can that be an accident.
66.
GRAHAM
It isn't, it's a coincidence. Or it
probably is. That's the beauty of
the universe.
RUTH
But what's the point? If there's
nothing afterwards, what's the
point in living?
GRAHAM
This is the point, Ruth. Right now.
This conversation. That tree, your
next cheeseburger. Life is a
miracle. People spend so much time
focusing on rescuing the princess,
they forget how much fun it is to
fight the dragon.
RUTH
Huh?
GRAHAM
Carl Sagan said "A religion, old or
new, that stressed the magnificence
of the universe as revealed by
modern science might be able to
draw forth reserves of reverence
and awe hardly tapped by the
conventional faiths.'
RUTH
Huh?
GRAHAM
It's okay not to know, Ruth. It's
wonderful because it means we still
have things to learn. We still have
life to live.
RUTH
I'm frightened.
GRAHAM
So am I, but it passes, sort of.
Ruth, we're on an amazing adventure
and I think you should come with
us. I know you feel confused and
lost but if you get back on board
that RV, you might just find the
very thing you're looking for.
RUTH
I... I'm not sure.
67.
GRAHAM
I'm sure Ruth. I'm sure because I
can honestly say, I have never
talked to a woman for this long
without blushing.
RUTH
That's so sweet.
GRAHAM blushes, deep, dark, red.
The RV drives across the rugged countryside. GRAHAM, CLIVE,
RUTH and PAUL appear in various combinations.
GRAHAM drives with PAUL in the Chewie seat, CLIVE sleeps on
the sofa, RUTH can be seen sitting on the bed at the back.
CLIVE drives with GRAHAM in the Chewie seat. PAUL just
behind, RUTH on the sofa. She is staring at PAUL. PAUL turns
round, she looks away.
PAUL drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat, GRAHAM and RUTH
just behind. The RV weaves from side to side.
CLIVE
Small corrections! Small
corrections!
RUTH drives. Everyone else is asleep.
68.
We see ZOIL's convoy. ZOIL drives, his eyes intent on the
road, searching. He reaches down out of shot, then brings a
taco to hi mouth and takes a bit. A truck passes. We see
HAGGARD in his car, talking animatedly on his cell phone. The
truck passes. We see O'REILLY in his car, he is asleep at the
wheel. The truck passes, horn blaring. O'REILLY wakes up
suddenly, looking rattled.
The RV is parked up. It is a little speck on an enormous
landscape. Next to the highway is a sign which reads "YOU ARE
NOW LEAVING UTAH.' Underneath this a separate sign reads
"LEAVING PACIFIC TIME ZONE ENTERING MOUNTAIN TIME ZONE.' PAUL
leaps back and forth over the line.
PAUL
11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock,
12 o'clock, 11 o'clock. Come on!
It's fun.
We see CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH standing in the middle of the
road watching PAUL.
RUTH
This is the furthest I've ever
been.
ZOIL's convoy pulls into an Arby's. The three AGENTS leap out
of their cars and run in. After a short pause MOSES BEHE's
pick up truck passes through shout; "Onward Christian
Soldiers' blares from the radio.
GRAHAM, CLIVE and RUTH step out of the RV.
70.
CLIVE
Okay, in and out, yes? Don't talk
to anyone unless you have to and
try to look inconspicuous.
Angle on the most conspicuous threesome in America.
HOOOOOOOONNNK.
CLIVE
I wish he'd stop doing that!
They enter the bar. Parked nearby, is a black Lincoln
Escalade, shiny, mean, dented.
CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH explode out of the bar and run toward
the RV. The MEATHEADS crash out after them.
RUTH
What about Papa?!
JAKE
Hey, we ain't finished with you.
75.
CLIVE
Graham, take Ruth into the RV and
lock the door. I don't want either
of you to see this.
CLIVE turns back to the MEATHEADS. BANG! CLIVE is struck in
the face, he falls, nose bleeding.
They turn to RUTH and GRAHAM, who back up against the RV. The
MEATHEADS approach ominously. The RV door bursts open. PAUL
stands silhouetted against the interior lights.
PAUL
Yo fucknuts!
The MEATHEADS freeze. PAUL vanishes, then reappears a few
feet from them, their eyes bulge.
PAUL
So, who wants to get probed first?
The MEATHEADS swoon and simultaneously hit the deck.
GRAHAM
Ha! Only one of us fainted!
PAUL
Tell me you got the food?
CLIVE gets up and opens his coat revealing bags of food.
Sirens wail in distance. RUTH turns white.
RUTH
It's them.
GRAHAM
Who?
RUTH
It wasn't my fault. They answered
the phone. He knew all about us.
CLIVE
Who? Who are you talking about?
PAUL
Get in the RV!
SMASH CUT. The RV roars to life, backing up at speed into the
MEATHEAD's vehicle. MOSES BEHE bursts out of the bar, just as
the RV passes. RUTH sees him out of the window. MOSES locks
eye with his daughter. He runs to his pick up but realises he
doesn't have his keys. The RV tears off into the night,
leaving MOSES BEHE bellowing with anger and the Lincoln
Escalade, shiny, mean, fucked.
76.
GRAHAM and PAUL stand outside a liquor store on the main drag
of a quiet town. Next door is a Western themed clothing
store. PAUL looks in the window.
PAUL
Hey Graham. Check this out. What
d'ya think?
PAUL indicates to a small cowboy outfit, big enough for a
child, displayed in the window.
PAUL
I'd look pretty hot, right?
GRAHAM
Space cowboy.
PAUL
Steve Miller Band. I love that
song. Speaking of midnight tokers,
I got a littler herbal refreshment
in my pants. Do you guys partake?
GRAHAM
No.
PAUL
Shame. I get it from the military.
This is the shit that killed Dylan.
78.
GRAHAM
Bob Dylan's still alive.
PAUL
Is he?
CLIVE comes out of the liquor store clutching bags of beer.
CLIVE
Let's party!
GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL have made a camp fire in a woodland
clearing on the other side of town. They sit round drinking
beers and chatting. PAUL rolls a joint.
GRAHAM
So why "Paul'? It's not very, you
know, alien.
CLIVE
Is it spelt like, P-'-a-w-l-l or
something?
PAUL
No.
GRAHAM
P-o-o-u-r-l?
PAUL
No, it's Paul. Like Paul Newman or
the little guy from Simon and
Garfunkel.
CLIVE
Paul Simon.
PAUL
Paul Simon. Paul's not my real
name. It's a name I got given.
GRAHAM
What's your real name?
PAUL
You won't be able to pronounce it.
CLIVE
I can speak Klingon.
PAUL
What a geek.
CLIVE
Hey!
79.
GRAHAM
Come on, what's your real name.
PAUL opens his mouth and screeches.
PAUL
Roooooootttchaaaaaaaaaaa.
CLIVE
Roooooootttttttccchhaaaa.
PAUL
That's pretty good.
GRAHAM
Rootchaa? That sounds like Roger.
PAUL
Fuck you!
CLIVE
Calm down, Rog.
More laughter. Even PAUL. He lights his joint.
GRAHAM
You look like a poster on a
student's wall.
PAUL
That was my gag! "Take me to your
dealer' right? Yeah, that was mine.
Never saw a dime.
GRAHAM
You never answered my question. Why
Paul? Who called you Paul?
PAUL
The little girl who found me when I
crashed. It was terrible actually.
I killed her dog. I didn't mean to!
My ship sort of landed on it. When
the military arrived I was
delirious; I kept saying "Paul?
Paul?" It was the only English I
knew, because I'd heard the little
girl saying it over and over.
Spooks thought it was my name.
CLIVE
She called her dog Paul?
PAUL
Least it wasn't Mr. Muggles.
GRAHAM
What happened to the little girl?
80.
PAUL
Who knows? Never saw her again.
Think about her everyday though.
PAUL offers the joint round. CLIVE and GRAHAM decline. PAUL
takes a deep drag. During the following exchange, GRAHAM,
CLIVE and PAUL start to move simultaneously as though
governed by some kind of psychic link.
CLIVE
It's strange, isn't it? Ordinarily
in this situation Graham and I
would be looking up at the stars,
wondering about life on other
planets but we know now, don't we?
It's a bit of an anti-climax.
PAUL
Thanks a bunch, Hurley.
CLIVE
I don't mean that in a bad way.
They all scratch their noses.
GRAHAM
Paul, can I ask you something?
PAUL
Shoot.
GRAHAM
Why are you in such a hurry to
leave?
PAUL
I've outlived my usefulness.
CLIVE
How so?
PAUL
There's only so much knowledge I
can share about the universe and
quantum theory and how to make a
really nice meatball sandwich. The
only thing I have to offer them now
are my abilities.
GRAHAM
So?
PAUL
So the only way they're going to
get hold of them is by obtaining
some of somatic stem cells.
81.
GRAHAM
So what, do they take a swab from
your cheek?
PAUL
Negative.
CLIVE
Stool?
PAUL
Sadly, not that simple.
GRAHAM
Blood?! Oh my god, I hate needles.
PAUL
Believe me, a needle would be a
picnic compared to what they had in
store for me.
CLIVE
I don't follow.
PAUL
Stem cells are multipotent.
GRAHAM and CLIVE look blank.
PAUL
Lineage defined?
GRAHAM and CLIVE still look blank.
PAUL (CONT'D)
The camouflage response, the memory
transfer, the revivification, they
all originate in my cerebellum. In
order to cultivate them in a
laboratory they would have to...
GRAHAM/CLIVE
Cut your brain out.
PAUL
Bingo! Fortunately, someone was
kind enough to give me the heads
up, if you'll pardon the pun. So,
when they were transferring me to
the medical facility and I noticed
the bumper sticker on your RV, I
figured you might be sympathetic
types. I zapped the spooks, grabbed
the wheel and took my chance.
CLIVE
I thought the crash was our fault.
82.
PAUL
Well it was, kinda.
GRAHAM
So, you're saying if they catch
you...
PAUL draws his thumb across his neck. GRAHAM and CLIVE look
at PAUL in horror. All three scratch their heads.
PAUL
So tell me, are you guys virgins or
what?
GRAHAM/CLIVE
No.
They all cough.
PAUL
Alright then, Clive, when was the
last time you got laid.
CLIVE
Comic-Con 2005. Ewok chick.
PAUL
Three years ago you had sex with a
midget?
CLIVE
She was an Ewok!
Sniff.
PAUL
There are only two types of person
small enough to fit inside an Ewok
costume.
CLIVE
She was a midget.
PAUL
I can't believe you thought boning
a space bear sounded less
embarrassing than a person of short
stature.
CLIVE
I know. I'm sorry.
PAUL
Was it nice?
CLIVE
WONDERFUL
83.
PAUL
You sly dog!
PAUL rolls onto his back, clapping. GRAHAM snorts into his
beer, laughing. CLIVE joins in. Before long, the three
friends are rolling around in hysterics, utterly out of
control. After about thirty seconds of this, they pass out.
The sun has just risen. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL lie round the
smoldering camp fire sleeping soundly. PAUL is very white.
His eyes open. He looks around.
PAUL
Oh shit! Hey, wake up. Wake up. We
fell asleep.
CLIVE
How did that happen?
PAUL
Sorry, I get this thing when I get
high. It's called "projective
empathy'. You feel what I feel.
GRAHAM
Like in E.T.?
PAUL
Exactly.
CLIVE
Oh, thank God. For a second there I
thought I'd got drunk on Lite beer.
The guys gather their stuff and walk to the edge of the wood.
Looking through the tree line they realize that the quiet
town of last night has become very busy indeed.
GRAHAM
Oh dear!
PAUL
I can't walk through there.
CLIVE
How are we going to get back?
Close in on GRAHAM having the best idea of his life.
GRAHAM and CLIVE walk down the busy main street, between them
is PAUL. He is dressed in the little cowboy suit from the
shop window, his hat pulled down low over his face.
84.
GRAHAM
Maybe we should hold hands, so that
we look like a family.
PAUL
That's great! Two grown men who
look like sex offenders holding
hands with a child cowboy.
CLIVE
You could be a midget.
PAUL
You're obsessed with midgets!
They continue on, trying to look as if nothing is strange.
GRAHAM
Seem to be working, Clive. Clive?
GRAHAM notices that CLIVE is no longer with them. He looks
back to see CLIVE, gawping thought the window of a COMIC
SHOP, at a sword resembling the one they saw at Comic-Con.
The tag reads "Genuine "BLADE' Katana'. $299.99.
GRAHAM
Clive, no.
CLIVE walks into the shop. GRAHAM and PAUL follow quickly
behind. As they enter the COMIC SHOP, MOSES BEHE emerges from
the adjacent Drug Store. He takes a couple of pain killers
and flexes his sore shoulders. He wanders up the road,
scanning the passers by.
Close on RUTH's watch. She paces, worried.
KNOCK KNOCK.
85.
RUTH
Where have you been? I was worried.
She opens the door. AGENT ZOIL flashes his badge.
ZOIL
Good morning, Ma'am. Sorry to
trouble you. Agent Zoil, Secret
Service. Your wagon here matches
the description of a recreational
vehicle we're currently looking
for. May I ask, are you alone?
RUTH pauses a second.
RUTH
Yes, I'm alone.
ZOIL
Do you mind taking a look at these
pictures?
ZOIL pulls out three pictures and hands them to RUTH. CCTV
shots of GRAHAM and CLIVE at the gas station and MOSES's pic
of RUTH, looking younger, with dark hair and no glasses.
ZOIL
Do you recognise any of these
people, Miss?
She lingers on the picture of herself.
ZOIL
Miss?
RUTH
No, sorry I don't.
ZOIL
Where are you coming from, Ma'am?
RUTH
Christian ministry in Seattle. I've
been driving for 5 days.
ZOIL
Going far?
RUTH
Austin.
ZOIL
Great town.
RUTH
Oh yes. It has an impressive bat
population you know?
(MORE)
86.
RUTH (CONT'D)
Folks gather by the rive in the
evening to watch them fly out. Turn
the sky black. Quite a sight.
ZOIL
Is that so?
RUTH
Uh-huh. Well, I really should be
getting along.
ZOIL
Of course. Thanks for your time,
Miss...?
Beat.
RUTH
Darwin, Charlotte Darwin.
ZOIL smiles and nods. He laves.
GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL exit the comic shop. PAUL waves to
KEITH NASH, who now sits outside, on a bench, with his
MOTHER. The boys walk up the street, seconds later, HAGGARD
and O'REILLY step out of a store, eating bags of candy.
MRS. NASH
Don't lie, Keith.
KEITH NASH
I'm not lying.
MRS. NASH
Oh, come on now, Keith. If you
carry on like this, you'll have to
come with me to Dress Barn.
KEITH NASH
Honestly Mommy, he was an alien and
his name was Paul!
MRS. NASH
Whoever hard of an alien called
Paul?
89.
HAGGARD is suddenly kneeling at KEITH NASH's side. O'REILLY
stands nearby.
HAGGARD
What did you say, kid?
MRS. NASH
Excuse me. Who are you?
HAGGARD
Agent Haggard Ma'am, Secret
Service.
MRS. NASH
Secret Service?!
HAGGARD
Kid?
KEITH NASH
He was in the shop.
HAGGARD
Is he still in there?
KEITH shakes his head.
O'REILLY
Did he say where he was going?
KEITH looks at his comic. The ZOIL style agent, shooting the
PAUL style alien. He looks back at HAGGARD and points him in
the entirely wrong direction.
HAGGARD
South. Toward New Mexico, huh?
KEITH nods. HAGGARD stands, his mind racing. He looks
meaningfully at O'REILLY not noticing the RV rumbling up the
street behind him with CLIVE at the wheel.
O'REILLY
We've got him man! We're going to
get a fucking promotion.
HAGGARD
You did good kid. Want a candy?
KEITH NASH
No thanks.
HAGGARD
Let's go.
The two agents rush off.
O'REILLY
What about Zoil?
90.
HAGGARD
Screw Zoil!
MOSES BEHE kicks at the remains of the campfire. He bends
down and picks something up. It is Ruth's handkerchief, now
stained with dirt and blood. He screws it into his shaking
hand. An engine roars. He looks up to see the RV rumbling up
the road. It turns onto the Eastbound Highway. MOSES' pick up
is parked about 200 yards away. MOSES starts to lumber
towards it as fast as he can, which isn't very fast.
HAGGARD and O'REILLY sprint up to their vehicles.
ZOIL (O.S.)
Where the hell do you think you're
going?
HAGGARD can't hide his frustration.
HAGGARD
We picked up a lead, sir. Little
kid in the town said he saw an
alien. Said he was heading toward
New Mexico.
ZOIL
And you were just gonna take off?
HAGGARD
Thought it best to take the
initiative, sir. We were going to
radio you.
ZOIL
Well now, that's mighty civil of
you. We have a chain of command. I
expect you to abide by it. Where
d'you say he was headed?
HAGGARD
New Mexico sir.
ZOIL
Well, then let's move it.
They scramble.
ZOIL
Oh, and Haggard? Don't go getting
ideas about your station again.
ZOIL gets into his car leaving HAGGARD looking pissed.
91.
MOSES BEHE's pick up roars through shot, revealing a large
roadside sign proclaiming LUCIFER'S CUT PRICE FIREWORK
WAREHOUSE. Creep in on the sign.
ZOIL's motorcade pulls a spectacular U-turn and heads back up
the highway in the opposite direction.
MOSES BEHE's pick-up truck pulls a similarly spectacular turn
and heads in a different direction.
Caption: Bethlehem Creek, Wyoming
GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL stare through the window of the
RV at the farmhouse glimpsed in the first scene.
GRAHAM
You don't think she's still there
do you?
PAUL
That's what you're going to find
out for me.
CLIVE
Us?
PAUL
I can't just knock can I? What if
she's moved on and someone else
answers? I'm sick of people
fainting on me. I'll hang back with
my buddy Ruth, you two make first
contact. Just enjoy it.
CLIVE
What shall we say if it's her?
We're here with the alien that
killed your dog sixty years ago?
PAUL
Yes. Hurry up, there's going to be
a really big storm in exactly 34
minutes.
RUTH
How do you know?
PAUL
It's my job to know.
GRAHAM knocks on the door.
GRAHAM
Hello?
CLIVE
Knock again.
96.
VOICE (O.S.)
Who's there?
CLIVE
Tara Walton?
VOICE (O.S.)
Leave me alone!
GRAHAM
Okay.
GRAHAM goes to leave. CLIVE stops him.
CLIVE
Miss Walton, I'm the writer, Clive
Gollings and this is my friend and
colleague, Graham Willy. We're from
England and we're here with the
alien that killed your dog 60 years
ago.
Silence. The sound of multiple locks. The door opens to
reveal a woman (68). Grey, dishevelled but with fire in her
eyes. She scowls at GRAHAM and CLIVE.
TARA
What is this, some kind of joke?
CLIVE
It's no joke.
PAUL materializes between GRAHAM and CLIVE.
PAUL
Hello Tara.
TARA's faces sickens. She falls backwards into the house.
PAUL
Aw nuts.
TEAM PAUL climb out of the cellar and start to run towards
the RV, PAUL still in CLIVE's arms. It starts to rain.
PAUL
Come on!
GRAHAM
Ow, my shins!
TEAM PAUL reach the RV and start to board, just as MOSES BEHE
lumbers into view.
MOSES BEHE
RUTH!
RUTH
Papa?
PAUL grabs RUTH's hand.
PAUL
Come on.
MOSES BEHE
(levelling his shotgun)
Take your hands off her, devil!
The farmhouse explodes. ZOIL and HAGGARD who are only just
clear, hit the deck, covering their heads. MOSES is knocked
off his feet as flaming wood and debris rain down.
ZOIL is blackened and dazed, draped over HAGGARD's shoulder.
His eyes focus on a figure in the near distance. MOSES BEHE
picks himself up and lumbers off towards his truck. HAGGARD
drops ZOIL and runs to his car.
ZOIL
Damnit Haggard, wait!
HAGGARD takes off. ZOIL staggers to his car and with great
difficulty, takes off in pursuit, narrowly avoiding MOSES
BEHE's truck. Lightening flashes. Loud thunder.
HAGGARD, ZOIL and MOSES follow the RV across the scrub.
We see the chase from above, the RV is in the lead, gaining
behind them, is HAGGARD, followed by ZOIL, then MOSES.
HAGGARD draws level. He looks up into CLIVE's eyes.
The RV nudges the BLACK SEDAN which spins out of control and
skids to a stop, ZOIL and MOSES scream past. HAGGARD turns
the engine over. Nothing. He yells. Lightening explodes
overhead, hail pings and bounces off the hood.
A massive black funnel extends from the sky about half a mile
ahead of the chase. It rakes the ground, reducing a small
farm building to a million splinters.
The grain silo bounces close to ZOIL's car, he swerves to
avoid it and stops. MOSES pulls up just ahead. MOSES and ZOIL
get out of the vehicles, almost unable to stand against the
wind and debris. They watch the RV, now a good distance in
front, heading for the heart of the tornado.
105.
ZOIL
He's insane!
MOSES BEHE
RUTH!
HAGGARD's car screams past. ZOIL grabs his radio.
ZOIL
Haggard, stand down. Stand down!
HAGGARD (O.S.)
He's mine. I can do this!
ZOIL
Haggard, it's suicide.
CLIVE
PAUL?
PAUL
NOW!
The funnel suddenly evaporates into the sky, leaving the path
ahead clear and oddly calm.
GRAHAM
It's gone!
CLIVE
Where did it go?
ZOIL watches amazed. He almost smiles.
ZOIL
Son of a bitch!
ZOIL looks at the sky. His face drops.
ZOIL
Haggard. Wait a minute!
An engine revs nearby. ZOIL turns to see MOSES BEHE pull off
in pursuit.
ZOIL
MR. BEHE!
(into is radio)
Damnit, hang back, hang back!
106.
HAGGARD (O.S.)
You're not running this show any
more Zoil. You had your chance.
ZOIL
Haggard, he knows what he's doing.
HAGGARD (O.S.)
So do I.
ZOIL
It's a trap!
The tornado touches down hear HAGGARD's car. He barely has
time to scream before his is lifted into the vortex.
MOSES's truck hurtles past ZOIL's car.
MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus!
ZOIL looks back toward the no unreachable RV.
The RV splutters to a halt. Steam rises from the radiator. It
whines, coughs and dies. Cut to TEAM PAUL stood around
surveying their fallen companion. A single bullet hold in the
grill, reveals the cause of her downfall.
GRAHAM
There goes the deposit.
CLIVE
Fare thee well friend. You were a
faithful and mighty steed.
TARA
She rode that storm with a bullet
in her heart and didn't stop until
we we're safe.
RUTH
If there is a benevolent creator
watching over everything then may
he, she or it bless the 1985
Holiday Rambler, Imperial.
Everyone looks to PAUL for his comment but he is not there.
GRAHAM
Paul?
PAUL (O.S.)
We're here.
PAUL is stood away from the RV at the foot of a small hill.
He starts to climb. The others follow. Crane up as TEAM PAUL
climb the hill to reveal a sight familiar to anyone who has
seen Close Encounters Of The Third Kind...
DEVIL's TOWER
GRAHAM/CLIVE
Of course!
109.
TEAM PAUL hike towards the tower.
RUTH
What you may not know is on the
outside of the tower they bolted a
series of ladders, all the way to
the top, put there by William
Rogers in 1893. He was the first
man to climb the tower.
TARA
I climbed up there in 1976. Thought
it would make a good site for some
UFO spotting. Turns out I wasn't
the only one.
PAUL
We call them IFOs.
TARA
Cute.
110.
PAUL
I-thank-you.
ZOIL opens the trunk of his car. He pulls out a large piston,
spare ammo and a webbing pack which he slings around his
shoulder. He sets off up the hill.
TEAM PAUL are walking round the tower. As they round the
corner the landscape changes, the trees give way to a piece
of open pasture flanked by pine forest, the tower opens
itself up slightly, a perfect natural amphitheatre.
PAUL
This is it.
PAUL takes out the firework, Zippo and cigarettes from his
back pack. He lights his last cigarette and takes a drag.
PAUL
I'll miss these.
PAUL takes the firework a little way off and sticks it in the
ground. He crouches down and lights the touch paper with the
cigarette, then scampers back to the gang. Beat. The firework
rises into the sky. It explodes. The star-burst is massive
and bright red, it illuminates the tower.
TARA
Pretty.
GRAHAM
What now?
PAUL
We wait.
A light appears in the sky some way off.
PAUL (CONT'D)
(FROWNING)
That was quick.
ZOIL runs through the bush, fast, like a wild animal. His
face fixed with serious intent, gun in one hand, torch in the
other.
111.
TEAM PAUL watch as the ethereal light draws nearer.
Spotlights cut through the night, searching beneath.
ZOIL leaps a fallen tree. Ahead, through the trees, he sees
an ethereal glow. He pulls the slide back on his pistol.
The lights are really close now. They are accompanied by a
deep rumble. A very earthly sound. Rotor blades.
PAUL
Wait a minute...
A HELICOPTER swoops in to land, kicking dust and debris into
the air. TEAM PAUL turn back to the woods but are stopped by
the sight of a torch getting nearer.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Oh shit.
Behind them, the HELICOPTER powers down. The door opens.
VOICE
Well, whaddya know? Small world.
VOICE appears flanked by two faceless, heavily armed
SOLDIERS. They level their weapons, just as ZOIL bursts
through the trees behind them.
ZOIL
PAUL!
PAUL
Lorenzo?!
PAUL spins round. We go into slow motion. ZOIL fires. The
bullet explodes from the gun, straight at us. Angle on the
bullet as it passes in ECU. The shot moves round behind the
bullet to reveal PAUL, looking shocked. The bullet whizzes
past him, slamming into one of the soldiers.
ZOIL rolls, coming to rest on one knee. He fires a second
shot into the leg of the other soldier who collapses. He
leaves his gun at VOICE just as the PILOT bursts from the
cockpit. The PILOT fires but misses ZOIL. ZOIL takes out his
shoulder, spinning him off his feet. VOICE steps forward,
holding a smoking gun.
VOICE
It was you! You told him. I
should've known.
(MORE)
112.
VOICE (CONT'D)
You've never made a mistake in your
life. That's why I put you in
charge of this fucking mission.
ZOIL
He's my friend! I've known him for
twenty years. He introduced me to
my wife damnit!
VOICE
You stupid son of a bitch. In five
years, you could have been where I
am.
ZOIL
I don't want to be where you are.
VOICE
Too bad, seeing as I'm the one
hold'ng all the cards and when I
say "cards", I of course mean big
fucking gun.
VOICE points his gun at PAUL.
PAUL
How'd you find me?
VOICE
It was pretty easy once we got a
fix on the geek-mobile. Wasn't hard
to figure out where you were
headed. You always did have a flare
for the dramatic.
PAUL nods, a sad smile creeping across his mouth.
VOICE
Let's go.
TARA stands in front of PAUL, then RUTH, then GRAHAM then
CLIVE, who summons every ounce of bravery in his body.
CLIVE
He's not going anywhere.
VOICE
Be honest with yourself, two
scoops. What is it that you think
you can possibly bring to the table
at this stage in the game?
CLIVE reaches beyond his back and produces his KATANA SWORD,
he holds it like a proud Samurai.
CLIVE
Blind fury.
The blade falls off.
113.
CLIVE
Bloody low grade Turkish alloy.
VOICE
Step aside, you fat nerd.
CLIVE
(IN KLINGON)
Graham, his this man.
CLIVE steps aside. GRAHAM slams his fist into the face of the
unsuspecting VOICE. He staggers back but rallies quickly,
blocking GRAHAM's second blow and delivering a heavy rebuke.
RUTH leaps onto VOICE's back and starts pummeling his head.
RUTH
Leave him alone!
VOICE hits out at RUTH. GRAHAM renews his attack.
GRAHAM
Leave her alone!
VOICE throws them off and comes face to face with TARA.
TARA
Leave them alone.
WHAM! She whacks VOICE across the face with a large stick.
TARA
You're not taking him away again.
He staggers backwards and falls to the ground, unconscious.
PAUL
Thank you, Tara.
TARA
Don't mention it.
PAUL rushes to ZOIL who lies on the ground, wounded.
ZOIL
The things I do for you, huh?
PAUL
You know I appreciate it.
ZOIL
Do you have any idea how difficult
it was to catch you guys?
PAUL
(LAUGHS)
Let me take a look at that. Ruth,
shine the torch down here?
RUTH grabs a torch and steps in behind PAUL.
114.
BLAM! RUTH lurches forward, suddenly limp. Everyone turns to
see MOSES BEHE, shotgun smoking in his and. His face white,
his eyes wide.
MOSES BEHE
Oh Lord, Ruth. My little Ruth.
GRAHAM
Noooooooooo!
GRAHAM gathers RUTH up in his arms. She coughs, flecks of
blood around her mouth.
MOSES BEHE
I...I never meant to shoot her. I
was aiming for the goblin.
CLIVE
He's not a goblin he's from another
planet.
MOSES BEHE
But he can't be. He... he...
GRAHAM
He's an alien you stupid man! Oh
Ruth, Ruth I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
I should have never persuaded you
to come with us.
RUTH focuses on GRAHAM. She smiles, weakly.
RUTH
What, and miss all this? Graham,
I've lived more in the last 48
hours that I ever did in that
trailer park. Isn't that what you
said living was all about? Right
now? This conversation? That tree?
My next cheeseburger? I'm not
afraid anymore Graham. I'm cold
though. Hey, where is everybody?
RUTH shudders and dies. TARA and ZOIL look aghast. GRAHAM
buries his head in RUTH's hair. CLIVE, his eyes are filled
with tears, puts his and on GRAHAM's shoulder.
MOSES BEHE
What have I done? I'm sorry. I'm so
sorry.
A shadow is cast across RUTH. Everyone looks up to see PAUL,
silhouetted against the moon. His eyes glint.
PAUL
There is no way this thing isn't
gonna end happy.
115.
PAUL drops to his knee and places his hands on RUTH's chest.
MOSES drops his shotgun and lumbers over, distraught.
MOSES BEHE
Get away from her! Don't you touch
my little girl.
CLIVE holds out a hand to stop MOSES. He obeys. The air hums,
charged with static. PAUL's skin ripples with color. Everyone
watches transfixed. RUTH's eye flickers and opens. With some
difficulty, she sits up and takes off her glasses. She blinks
both shining, healthy eyes.
GRAHAM
Ruth, are you okay?
RUTH
I think so. Is anyone hungry? I
really feel like a cheese burger.
Relief and joy spreads through group. MOSES falls to his
knees and sobs. He feels a hand on his shoulder and looks up
to see PAUL.
MOSES BEHE
Thank you.
RUTH and GRAHAM hug. She smiles at him.
RUTH
You can kiss me now.
They kiss with awkward passion. Everyone smiles then after a
bit become uncomfortable and a bit grossed out.
PAUL
Looks like the geek shall inherit
the earth.
CLICK CLICK.
The group turn to see VOICE, upright, pointing his gun.
VOICE
I wouldn't say-
SPLAT.
A large spaceship lands hard on top of VOICE. Everyone looks
shocked. PAUL, GRAHAM and CLIVE exchange a look.
PAUL
Happens to the best of us.
Some time has passed, a number of PAUL style aliens are now
present.
116.
One of them uses a big hose to clean the remains of VOICE
from the hull of the ship. Another two help the now healed
soldier to their feet, patting them on the back and shaking
their hands. The atmosphere is amiable.
TEAM PAUL look at one another. ZOIL and MOSES have joined
them. PAUL kisses and hugs RUTH.
PAUL
I'm sorry I frightened you so much
your hair turned white.
RUTH
You didn't frighten me. You freed
me. You helped me see the light.
PAUL
(TO MOSES)
Take care of her big man.
MOSES BEHE
I will sir. God be with you.
PAUL
Whatever dude.
They high five. PAUL turns to ZOIL, whose arm is in a
makeshift sling and shakes his hand.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Lorenzo Zoil, you're a good man.
Say bye to Karen for me.
ZOIL
Safe trip Short Round.
PAUL turns to GRAHAM and CLIVE. He pulls JELVA - ALIEN QUEEN
OF THE VARVAK from his pocket and hands it to them.
CLIVE
You can keep it.
PAUL
Cool. Okay.
GRAHAM
What did you think?
PAUL
Yeah. Three tits, awesome. Although
you know what? Sometimes, less is
more.
The boys nod.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Thank you.
GRAHAM
No, thank you.
117.
CLIVE
You are, and always will be, our
friend.
PAUL
Come here you fucking geeks.
They hug. He takes in incandescent orb from his pocket.
PAUL (CONT'D)
This is a self-sustaining light
orb. Might come in handy, you know,
if a bulb goes.
TARA is waiting for her goodbye but PAUL ignores her. He face
drops as he walks to his ship. He turns to her.
PAUL (CONT'D)
You coming?
TARA
What?
PAUL
I ruined your life Tara. Think I
owe you a new one.
TARA takes PAUL's hand.
TARA
I don't have my toothbrush.
PAUL
Baby, where we're going, you won't
need teeth.
TARA frowns then follows PAUL aboard. PAUL and TARA stand in
the doorway. One of the other ALIENS comes out of a small
room behind them, speaking in a strange tongue.
Subtitle: THE BULB'S GONE IN THERE.
As the door slowly closes, GRAHAM and CLIVE give PAUL the
CE3K salute. PAUL gives them the finger. The boys laugh,
tears in their eyes. The ship lifts off into the sky. GRAHAM,
CLIVE, RUTH, MOSES and ZOIL watch them go. The light form the
ship gradually fades, leaving them in darkness. Pause.
GRAHAM
That was good, wasn't it?
