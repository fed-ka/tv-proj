DISTANT GUN AND MORTAR FIRE
Muffled by the wet green forest.
The very earth seems to tremble.
A RABBIT
Darts out of a log, lifts itself on its hind legs and sniffs
the air.
LOBBED GRENADE EXPLODES
VOICES and SHOUTS, closer now, mix with the rumbling WAR
SOUNDS in a veritable symphony of violence and confusion.
A DEAD AMERICAN GI lays splayed out, careless in death.
A pair of SOLDIERS flash among the trees, running hunched
over and low, and disappear into the gray blooms of SMOKE.
For a moment the forest takes a breath.
Nothing but trembling leaves. Then - The RATTLE of a Jeep
Coming closer in fits and starts, GRINDING through low gears.
A Willys MB appears, CRASHING through the undergrowth.
It's driven by Private First Class KELLY ERNSWILER.
Eighteen, if that. Not much meat on him. His insignias
indicate he's in the 29th Infantry.
His face might be attractive, under other conditions.
He pauses and pulls a map from the pocket of his M41 standard-
issue field jacket.
KELLY
Where the hell are those Krauts?
To give himself courage, he SINGS Tommy Dorsey's "I'll Be
Seeing You [in all the old familiar places]" while maneuvering
the Jeep through the bushes and rocks.
He drives straight for a fallen LOG, GUNS the engine and
tries to go over it.
The Jeep's FRONT WHEELS catch on the log.
The BACK TIRES spin.
Kelly gets out. Takes off his M1 combat helmet and wipes his
face. Assesses the situation.
He grabs a BRANCH. Jams it under the wheel, trying to lever
the Jeep free. When --
The STUTTER of a nearby MACHINE GUN startles him.
The branch SNAPS against Kelly's weight. He slips and falls
in the mud.
KELLY
Shit.
Determined, he grabs his pack and carbine and sets off on
foot through the forest.
Kelly strides purposefully out of the woods. Pauses against
a split-rail fence beneath the innocent sun.
Across the clearing stands a seemingly abandoned BARN.
But not for long, as TWO GERMAN INFANTRYMEN appear around
the corner of it.
Kelly moves behind a tree to assess the situation.
Unaware, the Germans smoke and talk. Kelly's too far away to
hear them but he watches their every move.
They're relaxed, not as on guard as they should be. Their
Karabiners rest slung across their backs.
KELLY
Bingo.
AGAINST THE TREE
Kelly focuses himself.
Then he shoulders his carbine.
Pulls out his dog tags and kisses them grimly.
KELLY
"And so they buried Hector, breaker
of horses."
He takes his Smith & Wesson 1917 PISTOL from his pistol belt
and steps out into the SUNLIGHT FIELD in plain sight of the
guards.
Surely he knows they can see him. He must want them to see
him.
But they don't. Too busy passing nudie wallet photos.
Halfway across the open grass, Kelly raises the pistol but
does not aim it.
Just strides steadily closer, arms spread out, making himself
an easy target.
Crazy as it seems, Private Kelly Ernswiler is trying to get
himself killed.
Kelly pauses not twenty feet from the Germans, FIRES into
the air and waves --
-- when from behind him comes a voice.
GERMAN OFFICER
(O.S.)
Eine maus findet den kase.
Kelly whips around to face a third German, the OFFICER.
His pistol points right into the Officer's shocked pink young
face. Point blank range.
Only - Kelly doesn't fire.
He just lowers the pistol.
The German smiles.
KELLY
Kill me Adolf.
GERMAN OFFICER
Mien Prisoner!
The Infantrymen have recovered from their idle and come
running.
One of them yanks Kelly's hands behind his back and pushes
him into the barn roughly.
Kelly doesn't struggle.
KELLY
Hey, Siegfreid and Roy. What are you
waiting for? Kill me.
The DEAD GI gets up and walks off with the GERMANS and some
other SOLDIERS, done for the day.
Bart and Kelly walk back to the stranded Jeep.
BART
That Willys yours?
KELLY
Yup. Just got her. Three summers
packing out at Shop Rite.
Bart unfolds an entrenching tool from his belt and digs under
the back wheels, building up dirt.
Then he goes around to the front and puts his shoulder against
the hood. Bart rocks the Jeep while Kelly pumps the gas.
The Jeep finally pulls free and SPRAYS Bart with mud.
KELLY
My bad. Thanks though.
Kelly looks over his shoulder and starts backing away.
KELLY
See you.
Bart stands there, dripping with mud, shocked.
About a hundred feet away Kelly stops.
KELLY
Well, come on.
Bart walks towards the Jeep. Kelly backs it up again.
KELLY
I couldn't resist.
Bart climbs in.
BART
Real funny, Ernswiler. You might
still get your chance to die today.
Kelly pulls up into the circular gravel drive. Bart's house
is fancy. A nice yard and a pool. Bart hops out.
BART
You should come over some time.
Service our lawnmower.
KELLY
I would, but then I might soil my
croquet whites. You understand.
BART
How bourgeois. Cheerio then.
Kelly watches Bart go into his house and smiles in spite of
himself.
Kelly's house is a also pretty nice, nothing to be ashamed
of. It is smaller and weirder. The flowers and bushes are
overgrown and strange sculptures dot the yard, some leaning
at precarious angles.
Kelly washes his Jeep in the driveway.
Kelly buffs the headlamps with a chamois. The Jeep looks
good as new. He pulls a canvas cover over it.
KELLY
Sleep tight Hot Lips.
School's been out for a while. The first rush had already
left.
Kelly comes down the front steps and starts across the parking
lot to his Jeep.
Lance steps out from behind an SUV and intercepts him.
LANCE
You upset Bridget.
Kelly hardly stops walking.
KELLY
Give me a break.
LANCE
You need to apologize.
KELLY
What are you going to do, make out
with me?
Lance runs and grabs Kelly's backpack.
LANCE
Why are you fucking with me? You
little fucker. Want to play, fuckface?
KELLY
You just used fuck as a verb, noun,
and adjective. Impressive.
Kelly tries to start walking again but Lance has hold of
him.
LANCE
Let's see what Beetle Bailey's got
in his knapsack.
Lance grabs Kelly's arm and yanks it back. Kelly still seems
unconcerned.
Suddenly he pulls away, but Lance keeps hold of his backpack.
Lance holds the backpack up next to his head and points at
it, gleeful.
Lance walks away towards his car. Kelly runs after him.
Lance holds Kelly off easily with one hand and throws the
backpack into his SUV. They STRUGGLE for a minute, until
Lance pushes Kelly away, gets in the car.
Kelly runs next to the car and pounds on the window as Lance
drives off.
Finally, Kelly gives up. Lance turns out of the parking lot
and HONKS the horn.
Kelly shakes his head.
KELLY
Rim job.
Kelly hops out of his Jeep and walks towards the front of
the school.
Lance is there, hanging out with Bridget and some of his Cro-
Magnon FRIENDS.
He wears a WW II CAP, overseas airborne style, obviously
Kelly's.
LANCE
Hey fuckface. Like my new hat? I
just joined the Boy Scouts.
The Cro-Magnons grunt approvingly at this witty repartee.
KELLY
If you stay in it long enough, maybe
you'll get your fudgepacker badge.
Ooh. The Cro-Magnons laugh at Lance and EGG him on - "You
gonna take that?"/"He just called you a fag", etc.
Lance frowns and grabs Kelly.
LANCE
You're a regular Howie Mandel.
Still holding on to him with one arm, he SLAPS Kelly hard
across the face with the other.
Kelly's knees give a bit. Lance holds him up.
BRIDGET
Lance!
Lance looks over at her and releases Kelly.
LANCE
Okay babe.
(to Kelly)
One day you and me will be alone.
And won't that be nice?
Kelly is hurt but covering.
KELLY
Too bad my mom won't let me date
yet.
Kelly frowns and adjusts his clothes. Tries to re-wet the
dry inside of his mouth with his tongue.
He turns slowly and trudges up the stairs.
Sarah has been watching the whole thing from the door.
SARAH
Why do you mess with him?
KELLY
You're right. I should give him a
break.
Kelly pulls up in his Jeep. He turns off the engine but
doesn't get out. Just sits there. He doesn't want to go in.
Colored plastic flags droop in the sun.
MILITARY STALL
Bart sweeps his eye over everything. A SKINNY GUY wearing a
wife beater has some not half-bad stuff.
Kelly, bruise faded to yellow and green, examines a glass
mason jar of what seems to be dirt.
SKINNY GUY
(to Kelly)
That there's actual sand from Iwo
Jima.
BART
Or your sister's sandbox.
The guy shrugs.
SKINNY GUY
Well, it don't come with no
certificate of authenticity.
(considers)
I could write one up for you, I
suppose. Get it notarized.
BART
No, that's quite all right. Actually,
I'm in the market for medals.
SKINNY GUY
Sure. I got a couple purple hearts.
A Silver Star. DSC. Can't sell them
to you though. They were gramp's.
(wink)
Bart acts casual, hands clasped behind his back.
BART
Are you sure?
SKINNY
They have a lot of sentimental value
-
BART
Yeah. How much?
SKINNY GUY
A lot.
Bart pulls out a paper bag and offers it to the skinny guy,
who looks inside.
SKINNY GUY
What's this?
BART
General Ulysses S. Grant's field
flask, my friend.
Kelly is shocked. The skinny guy looks at his suspiciously.
BART
Throw in one of those backpacks and
we'll call it even.
The skinny guy looks at Bart, and in the bag again. He goes
to get the backpack. Kelly's impressed by this smooth
exchange.
FLEA MARKET - BETWEEN ROWS
Kelly and Bart weave through the maze of stands. Kelly now
holds the backpack.
KELLY
Buying and selling US service medals
is illegal.
BART
Exactly. That's why the resale value
is so high.
KELLY
Is that what they teach you at
Langely?
BART
Don't be so nave. We all have our
skeletons. Some of them just pay
more than others.
KELLY
And I'm not even going to ask about
the flask.
BART
Don't ask, don't tell. The army gets
everything right, don't they?
CAMPAIGN PIN STALL
A frowsy WOMAN in a muumuu sits fanning herself in front of
an extensive display of pins and buttons.
WOMAN
You boys look like Goldwater fans.
KELLY
I've never been accused of that
before.
WOMAN
Well jeez, you don't have to be
insulted.
BART
Anything military?
The woman considers this, her fan working back and forth
lazily.
WOMAN
Fish around in that cigar box.
Bart paws through the box. Acts casual.
BART
What do you want for the box?
WOMAN
Twenty dollars.
BART
Fifteen.
WOMAN
Don't be so hasty.
(fanning)
I got a few Geraldine Ferraro pins
I'm looking to unload.
FLEA MARKET FOOD COURT
Kelly and Bart, now wearing the smiling black & white face
of Geraldine Ferraro, eat disgusting yet delicious flea market
food and watch a slow-motion bingo game.
KELLY
Goldwater fan. I think that's some
kind of insult.
BART
Not at Dartmouth. Where are you going
to go to school?
KELLY
I'm not.
BART
Ah, you have that luxury.
KELLY
You don't?
BART
(shrugs)
I didn't have much say in the matter.
Everything has been decided for me
since birth. I'm not whining about
it. Play the hand you're dealt, right?
KELLY
Easy for you to say. You got a royal
flush.
BART
Are you crazy? My life sucks.
Everyone's always telling me what to
do. You can't fight it. Go with the
flow.
They eat for a minute to the soothing sounds of the BINGO
CALLER: TWENTY-ONE, THIRTEEN, FOUR, SEVENTY-EIGHT.
KELLY
What about Tabby?
BART
She got to go where she wanted. Sarah
Lawrence. Six years. She's almost
done with grad school. Yale.
KELLY
I didn't think people actually went
to Yale.
BART
(thinking)
I don't know. I mean, she drives off
in her car in September. For all we
know, she could just pull her car
over in Albany and sleep there until
May.
KELLY
What do you mean?
BART
It was a joke. Joke?
Bart does some fake sign language to help Kelly out.
KELLY
Oh. Is that what one of those sounds
like? Somehow, I always imagined
they would be funnier.
Bart pushes Kelly, who grabs his arm like it got hurt.
KELLY
Sarah Lawrence? Isn't that for
lesbians?
Bart shrugs.
BART
What happened to your face?
KELLY
Remember the backpack incident?
BART
Same guy?
KELLY
The one with mad cow-diseased
hamburger meat for brains? That would
be the one.
Interested, Bart leans forward.
BART
What are you going to do about it?
KELLY
I'm not going to lower myself to his
level.
BART
Of course not. But there are
alternatives
KELLY
Alternatives?
BART
Haven't you ever heard of the 193rd
Special Operations Wing?
Kelly shakes his head.
BART
Well do you want to get this guy or
what?
KELLY
Yes.
BART
All right. Let's get the fuck out of
here, then.
Bart tosses his wrapper at the trashcan. Kelly watches it
hit the rim and go in.
BART
(on the move)
I have some things to show you.
Bart and Kelly walk across the yard.
BART
So, you have a thing for my sister?
KELLY
What? No, no.
BART
Everybody does.
They skirt around the pool.
KELLY
We just have a few things in common.
BART
Oh really, like what?
KELLY
I can't tell you. It's my feminine
side.
BART
You don't wear women's clothes when
you're alone, do you?
Abe sits on a lawn chair.
Kelly comes out, unfolds another chair and sits next to his
dad - a good distance away.
They both look up at the sky.
ABE
Keller. There's a meteor shower.
Kelly frowns.
KELLY
A funny thing just happened. A little
trip down memory lane. I thought you
were on our couch, dead.
Abe laughs.
ABE
Oh, you mean Emmett? They didn't
have an empty bed for him at Care
House.
Kelly nods, considering this.
KELLY
Well that's one of your more brilliant
ideas.
(anger rising)
Have you thought about the fact that
it might be dangerous? That he might
steal something, or go into cardiac
arrest? Drink all our cooking wine?
Which he seems to have done.
ABE
He just needs a place to sleep for
the night.
KELLY
You're right. Besides, having him
here makes it feel like home.
Abe slams his hands down on the arms of his chair.
ABE
I've been straight for four years,
almost five. A third of your life.
Kelly claps slowly.
KELLY
Big whoop. I've been straight the
whole time.
Abe closes his eyes.
ABE
I hate to tell you this, but I'm not
your problem anymore.
Kelly gets up.
KELLY
No. That's the one thing I get to
decide.
Abe looks at Kelly.
ABE
Let me know. I can wait.
They look at each other. Kelly shakes his head and goes
inside. Abe looks up at the sky.
ABE
(to himself)
Keller, there's a meteor shower.
In a backyard tree house next door sit Kelly and Bart, Kelly
looking through a pair of M3 field glasses.
KELLY
I have the target in sight.
BINOCULAR MATTE
Through the twin circles Lance gets into his car in front of
his house.
KELLY
I think he's leaving.
BART
Let me see. Don't be a farb, give
them up.
Kelly hands the glasses over. Bart looks through them. Then
he puts them down.
BART
The coast is clear.
The boys looks at each other.
BART
Let me prepare to deploy.
Bart opens up a duffel bag and pulls out a yellow jumpsuit
which he puts on. Kelly looks through the binoculars.
KELLY
Is this going to work?
BART
We've planned for every contingency
using the tried and true techniques
of the last great world power.
KELLY
Save it for the press conference.
THE LAWN
The boys climb down out of the tree house.
Bart is dressed in an official-looking yellow jumpsuit with
telephone repairmen's tool hanging from his belt and a hard
hat on. Kelly carries a toolbox.
BART
Stay low. On my signal.
He looks at Kelly. Then he holds up one finger and gestures
"go." They sneak hunched over towards the fence. A LITTLE
GIRL comes out of the house and stops when she sees them.
Bart and Kelly look at each other. Bart takes the toolbox
and gestures to Kelly by pointing at the girl and covering
his mouth.
Kelly peels off towards the girl while Bart continues across
the lawn.
The girl starts to SCREAM. Kelly swoops up and covers her
mouth with his hand. He tucks her under his arm and runs
towards the opposite side of the house.
He puts the girl down, still covering her mouth.
KELLY
We're the good guys. If you scream,
the bad guys are going to come and
burn down your house. Okay? So stay
here and be quiet.
The girl nods. Kelly takes his hand off her mouth and starts
to sneak away.
GIRL
My dad has a gun.
Kelly runs across the street to get a view of the front door.
IN FRONT OF LANCE'S HOUSE
Bart turns up the driveway and RINGS the doorbell.
LANCE'S MOTHER opens the door. Bart confers with her briefly
and steps inside. The door closes behind him.
Kelly stares so hard at the door he doesn't see the NEIGHBOR
come up behind him.
NEIGHBOR
Can I help you, young man?
Kelly starts and turns.
KELLY
I was just inspecting your lawn.
Kelly grabs a few blades of grass.
KELLY
Have you thought about Astroturf? It
takes a lot less water to keep green.
I mean, no water, technically.
NEIGHBOR
I'm not interested.
KELLY
Oh. I see. Okay then.
Kelly gets up and starts to walk down the street, only -
Lance PULLS UP in his SUV.
Kelly darts behind a parked car and watches Lance go into
the house.
KELLY
Oh, shit.
Lance comes right back out. He forgot something in his car.
KELLY
Oh, shit.
Kelly moves around the car, trying to keep it between him
and Lance.
Bart comes down the front walk whistling and eating a cookie.
He smiles at Lance, now coming back up the walk.
LANCE
Smile worker bee. I'll be your boss
some day.
Bart nods and tips his HARD HAT.
Kelly follows him on the other side of the row of cars until
Lance's house is out of sight.
Then he gets in step beside Bart.
BART
What an asshole. His mom gave me
cookies, though.
KELLY
Did you get it done?
BART
Don't ask stupid questions. Let's go
home and listen.
Bart wears his school uniform and sits in the passenger seat
next to Kelly.
LANCE
(V.O. cont'd)
-- Baby will be waiting where Daddy
least expects her. Love, Bridgie."
Yes!
BART
Do you have everything?
Kelly just looks at him. Bart's already asked this question.
BART
We can't afford any errors.
KELLY
You don't need to tell me. It's my
ass on the line.
Kelly pulls up in front of Bart's school.
Bart turns to him and puts a hand on his shoulder.
BART
I wish I could be there to see it.
KELLY
You'll get the de-brief.
BART
It's a day that will live in infamy.
KELLY
You couldn't do any better than that?
BART
I don't hear you coming up with
anything.
Bart hops out and salutes Kelly, who give him the thumbs up
in response and pulls away.
Kelly stands awkwardly on the front stoop with his backpack.
Minnie opens the door.
MINNIE
Kelly? Bart's not here, he -
KELLY
Oh, that's all right. Actually, I'm
here to see Tabby. Just to do a little
painting with her.
MINNIE
She's out back in her studio.
KELLY
Thanks.
Kelly smoothes the cover over his Jeep. Bart pulls up to the
curb in his BMW.
KELLY
What are you doing here?
BART
I tracked you down. There's someone
I'd like you to meet.
Kelly sits in the car. Bart pumps gas. They talk through the
window.
BART
I met him when my mom made me go
around caroling with the Youth Group.
KELLY
You don't really believe that stuff
about Berlin? And Hitler's compound?
BART
Does it matter?
KELLY
Of course it matters. Doesn't the
truth matter?
Bart grins.
BART
I don't know. You tell me.
Kelly avoids this by getting out of the car.
KELLY
I want a drink. Let me borrow a couple
bucks.
BART
I told you not to play him for money.
KELLY
I was trying to be nice. He's your
friend.
Bart returns the pump and screws in the gas cap.
BART
Exactly. You should know better.
What do you want.
KELLY
Mountain Dew -
Just then he glances towards the gas station and sees EVE,
set up in the adjacent abandoned lot. She's got the van parked
there with the sliding door open and paintings propped around
on display.
KELLY
-- Oh shit.
But Eve has seen him. She shields her eyes with her hand and
calls to him.
EVE
Kelly!
Kelly backtracks towards the car.
BART
That woman's calling you.
Eve walks over to them. Kelly can't get out of it.
KELLY
(low)
Bart. Meet my mom.
Eve smiles brightly.
EVE
What a nice surprise. It's so nice
to finally meet you.
Bart is surprised but recovers his manners quickly, just
like he's been taught to.
BART
Likewise. So, doing a little business?
EVE
A little is right. But I work it as
much as I can.
Eve laughs.
Kelly shifts his weight from foot to foot. Eve looks at both
of them.
EVE
So, what have you boys been up to?
KELLY
Bart took me to meet his friend
Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home.
EVE
Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home?
KELLY
You don't know him.
EVE
You boys should swing by Care House.
There are some Vets there.
KELLY
We can't.
EVE
Oh. Well - okay.
Eve watches a car pull into the lot next to the van.
EVE
I should go. But you boys should
come over to our house some time.
(to Bart)
I know your family must get tired of
him.
Kelly visibly bristles at the thought of his parents
entertaining Bart.
BART
Not at all. But I'd love to, anyway.
Eve looks at Kelly. Then she runs back over to the van.
KELLY
There you go. Now you know everything.
BART
What's your problem? She's pretty
cute.
Kelly rolls his eyes and gets back in the car.
BART
Don't you want your soda?
KELLY
Forget it.
Kelly waves to Minnie and goes out the front door.
There he pauses, trying to decide what to do. Then he scowls.
He goes around the corner. Towards Tabby's studio.
BART
(O.S.)
All right, all right. I'm going.
Bart comes out in his pajamas to turn off the sprinkler. He
looks up and freezes.
Kelly comes out of Tabby's studio. He shuts the door carefully
and walks around the pool.
Kelly doesn't see Bart.
Bart doesn't say anything. He just watches Kelly go.
An ASSISTANT DIRECTOR and CAMERAMAN unload equipment from a
van.
The DIRECTOR looks off into the distance, trying to visualize.
Kelly pulls up next to the van. He wears a spotlessly clean
uniform.
DIRECTOR
Are you with the 101st or the 82nd?
KELLY
Well, 82nd today. It's not my usual
division. Technically, my patches
indicate -
DIRECTOR
Whatever. Make yourself comfortable.
We'll be a while setting up. Some of
the other boys are over by craft
service.
KELLY
Oh?
Kelly doesn't go anywhere.
DIRECTOR
The snack table. It's over there.
Someone will come get you when we're
ready.
KELLY
Right. Is Bart Bowland here yet?
DIRECTOR
Bart? Oh, Harrison's son. I don't
know.
KELLY
Ok. Thanks.
CRAFT SERVICE
Kelly and a half dozen other SOLDIERS stand or sit in the
grass around the table. They talk and rest on their backpacks.
A MAKEUP ARTIST makes the rounds.
MAKEUP ARTIST
(to Kelly)
And you are?
KELLY
Kelly Ernswiler, private first class.
MAKEUP ARTIST
All right, Kelly. Let's take a look
at you.
She gets out some pomade and runs a comb through his hair,
slicking it back.
MAKEUP ARTIST
That's it, handsome.
Kelly grins. When she walks away he messes up his hair again.
He scans the crowd. No Bart.
The A.D. walks over.
A.D.
Okay, everyone. We're going to start
positioning. Then we'll go through a
few rehearsals.
(points at soldiers)
You, you and you - go over there by
that tree. You and you guys, behind
the hill.
(looks at clipboard)
Okay, who's got the Jeep?
KELLY
That MG? She's mine.
A.D.
Great. We'd like to use it. Can you
drive it beyond the hill over there?
Kelly tries to act casual.
KELLY
Sure. I don't think that would be a
problem.
He walks towards his Jeep and pauses.
KELLY
Have you seen Bart Bowland? Has he
checked in?
A.D.
Don't know. We've got enough people.
It doesn't matter.
Kelly nods, wondering a bit. But it's soon forgotten.
KELLY
(to Jeep)
Hot Lips, old girl, you're going to
be famous.
A.D.
(yells)
Okay people. Listen to my voice.
From now on, you do whatever this
voice says. Take your place.
BEHIND THE HILL
Kelly waits with his rifle next to his Jeep, bored.
He sees a FIGURE in the shadows of the trees.
He raises his rifle and points it at the figure.
KELLY
Password.
Bart steps out of the barn.
KELLY
Hey! Where the hell have you been?
BART
No where.
KELLY
They put you over here with me? That's
great. I think we'll get some close-
ups. They want me to drive old Lippy.
Isn't that awesome?
Bart doesn't say anything.
KELLY
What the hell's your problem?
BART
I ought to fucking kill you.
KELLY
What?
BART
You had to do it.
Kelly shakes his head, avoiding Bart's eyes, trying to keep
it normal.
KELLY
What are you talking about?
BART
You just do whatever the fuck you
want. And consequences don't matter,
do they?
KELLY
Are you out of your mind?
Bart looks at Kelly. Sees nothing but a kid in an old Army
uniform.
BART
What the fuck do you think she's
going to do, run off with you?
The blood rises to Kelly's face.
But he still won't look at Bart.
BART
You're a seventeen-year-old bag boy.
She's a Yale grad student. Talk about
living in a fucking fantasy world.
Kelly's hands turn white around the rifle.
KELLY
No. You'd rather have me be miserable
like you are.
Bart comes closer. Uncomfortably close.
BART
(biting sarcasm)
Once again, you've displayed your
uncanny ability to nail the truth of
a character.
Kelly finally raises his head.
And looks Bart right in the eyes.
KELLY
Stop talking out your dad's mouth
and use your own for once.
Bart lunges at Kelly.
The camera's set up.
The groups are in position.
The A.D. stands by the cameraman.
A.D.
Standby for rehearsal. Cue the
explosion.
GRAY CLOUD EXPLODES
In the field. Soldiers leap out of trenches.
A.D.
Cue the Jeep.
Nothing happens.
A.D.
Cue the Jeep. Cue the fucking Jeep!
The A.D. shakes his head.
BEHIND THE BARN
The A.D. comes around the corner followed by the cameraman.
Bart and Kelly roll around on the ground.
A.D.
What the H. Christ is going on over
here?
Bart and Kelly continue to fight.
A.D.
(to cameraman)
Hey, roll this. Get this. Are you
getting this?
The cameraman puts his camera up to his eye and films.
Kelly finally pushes Bart off him, gets in his Jeep and drives
away.
A.D.
(to cameraman)
Follow him. Are you getting it?
Bart sits on the ground, out of breath.
A.D.
We can use this. We'll cut it
together.
The A.D. directs the camera at Bart.
A.D.
Get close on him.
Bart pushes the camera away.
Tabby follows Kelly across the yard.
TABBY
Hey.
Kelly stops and turns around.
KELLY
I guess the wedding's back on.
TABBY
We talked.
Tabby smiles sadly.
TABBY
I'm really sorry.
KELLY
Don't be.
They stand there in the yard. Tabby wraps her arms around
herself.
KELLY
My dad's got cancer.
Tabby looks at Kelly, pained.
TABBY
Oh, Kelly.
She takes a step towards him. He backs up.
KELLY
I guess we all get what we deserve.
Kelly looks at Tabby for a second, then turns and walks away.
Kelly drives along an open stretch of road. He throws the
painting out of the Jeep.
He comes to a turn and takes it much too fast.
The Jeep SKIDS, teeters on two wheels, and goes over the
embankment.
BOTTOM OF DITCH
Steam trails up from the Jeep's radiator. The front end is
completely smashed.
Kelly bangs his fist against the steering wheel.
KELLY
Stupid bitch.
Then he calm himself, gets out, and starts walking.
Kelly rides an old bike up to the bike rack and locks it.
On his knees Kelly fumbles with his bike lock, getting madder
and madder. Just as he's about to get it undone --
Lance appears.
LANCE
What, they re-assign you to the
bicycle brigade?
Kelly frowns at the lock.
KELLY
I'm busy.
LANCE
Too bad, cause I'm not. Remember
that little show I put on for the
school?
KELLY
I don't know what you're talking
about.
LANCE
Oh, come on. Pants down? Doll? Hard
on?
Kelly looks up at Lance.
KELLY
Oh that. I heard about it.
LANCE
And did you hear me and Bridget aren't
going out anymore because of it?
KELLY
I haven't been following the story.
LANCE
Yeah well, let's get this over with.
KELLY
It is over.
Lance pushes Kelly away from his bike. Kelly falls back on
his hands.
He squints up at Lance and moves back towards his bike.
Lance KICKS him back with his foot and looks at him.
KELLY
Just let me go home.
LANCE
Did you call me a homo?
Lance KICKS him again. Kelly breathes hard.
KELLY
This isn't a good time for me. Let's
re-schedule.
LANCE
No time like the present.
Lance picks Kelly up and SLAPS him hard on the face.
KELLY
First you should probably get me to
write home to my mother.
Lance PUNCHES Kelly and he reels. Then Kelly lunges for him
and they fall to the ground. Kelly swings wildly but Lance
pins him down and gives him a few good ones.
Then Mr. Norman comes out.
MR. NORMAN
Stop it!
Mr. Norman rushes over to them.
Kelly scrambles up and rips at his bike lock, gets on his
bike and rides away.
Mr. Norman tries to take a panting Lance by the arm but Lance
shakes him off.
LANCE
Get off me.
Kelly rides by his house and keeps going.
Kelly stops and looks up at the hospital but can't bring
himself to go in. He pedals on.
Kelly sits on the loading dock of an abandoned factory.
He watches the rusty barges glitter on the water. The wind
ruffles his sweaty hair.
Kelly's at the front door.
MINNIE
Bart's not here. Sorry.
She closes the door. Kelly wheels his bike down the driveway.
He sees Bart sitting out by the pool with a couple of LANGELY
BOYS.
Bart sees Kelly and ignores him, laughs at something one of
the guys says.
It's decorated for a wedding. Flower garlands trail up the
banisters.
GUESTS trickle in.
Harrison, dressed in a suit with a boutonniere on his lapel,
talks to an USHER.
HARRISON
Don't sit any of Mathilda's sisters
next to me if you can help it.
(to guest)
Oh, hello. So nice to see you. Thank
you for coming.
Bart comes outside, also dressed as an usher.
HARRISON
(to Bart)
Where's the priest?
BART
He should be here any minute. Calm
down.
Bart walks down the steps and looks down the street.
Kelly's walking towards him. IN HIS DRESS UNIFORM.
Bart walks down the street to meet him.
BART
What the fuck are you doing?
Kelly looks down. He can't meet Bart's eyes.
KELLY
I was invited.
BART
I uninvited you.
KELLY
It's not your wedding.
Bart looks at Kelly and shakes his head.
BART
Why are you wearing that?
Kelly doesn't answer.
BART
(softening)
I can't let you come in.
KELLY
Why?
BART
Because you know why. Just go home.
Kelly finally looks up at Bart and nods.
A Town Car pulls up.
Tabby gets out in her wedding dress. Has there even been a
more glorious woman? Will there ever be again?
Her MAID OF HONOR leads her around to the side of the church.
Kelly watches every step.
KELLY
She looks beautiful. Tell her - give
her my congratulations.
Kelly walks off.
Bart watches him go.
Kelly rides his bike past the house and stops when he sees
the car packed up in front.
Bart comes out with a box of stuff.
BART
Hey.
KELLY
Hey. You going away already?
BART
Yeah. The have this intensive summer
orientation thing.
KELLY
Is that good?
Bart puts the box in the car.
BART
Well, it's optional, but dad thinks
it would be "a good way to meet
people."
KELLY
He's probably right.
BART
He usually is.
They stand there.
KELLY
Well, go Big Green.
Kelly gives him a little ra-ra with one hand. Bart smiles.
Kelly's been doing his research.
BART
Thanks.
Kelly lifts his foot up to the pedal of his bike.
KELLY
Have fun. And get laid, will ya?
Bart laughs a little and shakes his head. Kelly is gone.
Harrison comes out.
HARRISON
Is that everything?
BART
Everything you'd let me bring.
Harrison checks the ties on the roof.
HARRISON
Give me a break.
Eve waits while Kelly and Sarah walk out to Sarah's car.
Kelly helps Sarah into it and closes the door for her.
KELLY
I still don't understand how you did
that.
SARAH
I spent my summers with my grandma
in the Catskills. She didn't give me
any spending money.
(shrugs)
So I played the bones for ice cream.
She pulls away. He watches her go.
KELLY
Hot damn.
