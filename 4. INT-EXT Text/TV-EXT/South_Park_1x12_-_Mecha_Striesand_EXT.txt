               dig site. A plain looking Anthropologist talks to the boys 
               and girls.

                         And so, these ancient arrowheads are 
                         buried deep down in the Earth's crust! 
                         We dig 'em up, polish 'em off and 
                         find over twelve new arrowheads every 
                         month!

               The kids all laugh.

                         Eric, keep quiet! I'm trying to sleep!

               Garrison is lying on rock with a newspaper over his face.

                                     ANTHROPOLOGIST
                         Now, can anybody tell me WHO left 
                         these arrowheads here?

                                     ANTHROPOLOGIST
                         Well, yes, but I want to see if you're 
                         learning anything.

                                     STAN
                              (This is new)
                         Oh.

                                     ANTHROPOLOGIST
                         Okay, I tell you what, why don't we 
                         all grab our little anthropology pic 
                         axes that were handed out, and we'll 
                         dig for our very own Indian 
                         Arrowheads!!

               The kids all cheer and start digging.

               As Cartman swings his pic axe, he immediately starts to sing.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Singing)

                         Some day masa set me free...

                                     STAN
                         Dude, shut up, Cartman!

                                     PIP
                         OOH! OOH! I think I found one!!

               But Cartman has hold of the other end.

                                     CARTMAN
                         No, I found it!

               Cartman and Pip hold the large arrowhead by opposite ends.

                                     PIP
                         Oh, I do believe I found it first.

                                     CARTMAN
                         No, I did, Pip!!

                                     PIP
                         Oh, dear...

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, guess we'll have to Roshambo 
                         for it.

                                     PIP
                         What do you mean?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, first I kick you in the nuts 
                         as hard as I can. Then you kick ME 
                         in the nuts as hard as YOU can. And 
                         we keep going back and forth until 
                         somebody falls. Last one standing 
                         gets the arrowhead.

                                     PIP
                         Oh, my. Well, I suppose if I must...

                                     CARTMAN
                         Okay, ready? I'll go first.

               Cartman takes a step and hauls off, kicking Pip square in 
               the balls. Pip immediately turns blue and falls to the ground 
               coughing.

               Cartman looks pleased.

               After Pip stops coughing, he finally manages to speak.

                                     PIP
                         Well, I guess you win.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh, I don't care, you can have the 
                         stupid arrowhead. I don't want it.

               Cartman tosses the arrowhead down to Pip, who is still lying 
               painfully in the dirt.

               The kids all go back to digging.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Day is never finished 
                         Masa got me working... Oh, look I 
                         found another one!

               Cartman cleans off the dirt, and sees that he is actually 
               holding a large, stone triangle with ancient symbols and 
               writing on it.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Aw, this is just a stupid triangle!

               Cartman tosses the triangle over his shoulder. It hits the 
               ground and Kyle picks it up.

                                     KYLE
                         Woa, check it out, dude. It's got 
                         little drawings on it.

               Kyle holds up the large, stone triangle revealing that it 
               does have a strange symbol on it.

                                     STAN

                         I don't know.

               Suddenly, the triangle lets out a small yellow glow.

                                     STAN

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey, give me that back!

                                     KYLE
                         You threw it away, Cartman! It's 
                         MINE now!

                         Thanks Tom, the little eight year 
                         old was very shocked indeed when he 
                         came across a very ancient triangular 
                         object.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE UP on Kyle with a mic in his face.

                                     KYLE
                         Well, I was just digging around and 
                         I was all like 'Dude, I found this 
                         triangle'. And my friends were all 
                         like, 'dude'. And I was all 'Dude'.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE UP on Cartman with the mic on him.

                                     CARTMAN
                         And I told him I said Kyle, I will 
                         kick you in the nuts. But he didn't 
                         give it back to me. So I kicked him 
                         square in the nuts... And he cried 
                         like Nancy Kerrigan.

                         And so the little boy will take his 
                         discovery home, and perhaps donate 
                         it to science... A little later.

                         No!

                         Oh, so you're really famous and 
                         important but you don't know John 
                         Elway.

               Babs looks ready to kill. But she takes a deep breath and 
               tries another approach.

                                     MS. STREISAND
                         Look, little boy, I understand that 
                         you found a neat little triangle 
                         near here. You know what I'm talking 
                         about?

                         Yeah...

                                     CARTMAN
                         No, I found it, HE stole it!

                                     KYLE
                         YOU THREW IT AWAY, CARTMAN!!!

                              (To Streisand)
                         I'm not talking to him, because he's 
                         a dirty thief.

               Babs ignores this and kneels down next to Kyle.

                                     MS. STREISAND
                              (Excited)
                         Little boy, does the triangle have a 
                         symbol of two snakes joined at the 
                         middle?

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, how'd you know?

               Bab's eyes get huge. She takes in a deep breath, and looks 
               into Kyle's eyes.

                                     MS. STREISAND
                         Okay, now this is VERY important... 
                         Where is the Triangle of Zinthar 
                         now?

                         I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU, YOU PISSANT 
                         LITTLE HICK!!!

               Stan reels back. Babs grabs Kyle's arms and shakes him.

                                     MS. STREISAND
                         WHERE IS THE TRIANGLE, DAMMIT?

               Just then Officer Barbrady steps up.

                         What seems to be the problemo, here?

               Babs let's go of Kyle, stands up and fixes her hair.

                                     MS. STREISAND
                         Problemo? There's no problemo, 
                         Officer. I was just introducing myself 
                         to these... CHARMING little boys.

                         Nu-uh! She was being a total bitch!

               Babs gets pissed again, but contains herself.

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         Boys shouldn't you be in school?

               The boys all look at each other and walk away. Babs and 
               Barbrady are left alone.

                                     MS. STREISAND
                         Well?

               Barbrady looks her up and down.

               Chef knocks on Kyle's door with Leonard Maltin.

                         I guess he's not home, Leonard Maltin.

                         news report I did, then those boys

                         be right now?

                         Mrs. Streisand had her own four 
                         million dollar condominium up near 
                         the ski slope.

               A huge, all glass immaculate condo sits perched on a mountain

               Chef's family car drives up the snowpacked mountain road.


               The boys are waiting for the bus to come.

                         MY triangle, now that it is MY 
                         triangle...

                         you would SHUT UP!!

               Just then, a nice, tan Honda Accord four door pulls up, and 
               a strange looking person gets out.

               Actually, it's just Barbara Streisand wearing groucho glasses 
               with a mustache. She talks with a ridiculously disguised 
               voice.

                                     DISGUISED BABS

                         you today?

                         And I am a very friendly, nice person.

               The boys don't respond.

                                     DISGUISED BABS
                         I hear that one of you found my 
                         triangle.

                         Yes. You see, that triangle is part 
                         of my Kidney Dialysis machine. I'm 
                         so glad you found it, because without 
                         it, I was sure to die within hours.

                         Well I guess we'll have to Roshambo 
                         for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as 
                         hard as I can, then you kick me square 
                         in the nuts as hard as you can.

                                     DISGUISED BABS

                         for finding it. It's worth a lot of 
                         money to me.

                                     CARTMAN
                         It is?!

                         Hey, no wonder that Barbara Streisand 
                         lady wanted it!

               Babs eyes get wide.

                                     DISGUISED BABS
                         Oh, ha, ha... Who is that?

                         lady who wishes she was still only 
                         forty-five.

               The boys all laugh. Babs gets furious.

                         Stealth Bombers on!

               The boys laugh harder. Babs starts shaking with anger.

                         to my condo where I'll kill you -- I 
                         mean -- give you money for the 
                         triangle.

                         wish you wouldn't have given me back 
                         that triangle NOW, huh, Kyle! DUMBASS!

               Cartman follows Barbara to her car. The other boys shrug and 
               follow too.

                         Oh, goddammit not again...

               Barbara easily destroys the buildings on South Park avenue. 
               People run screaming as a Japanese-style song takes over the 
               audio.

               The national guard has turned out to try and fight Mecha 
               Babs.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Alright, men!! Give her everything 
                         you've got!!

               A row of tanks pulls up in front of Mecha-Babs and starts 
               firing missles at her.

               They seem to have no effect.

               Five army helicopters fly in front of Mecha-Streisand's face.


               Mecha-Babs looks at the helicopter with Jimbo and Ned inside 
               just as Jimbo fires his rocket launcher.

               Babs reels back only slightly from the rocket's impact, then 
               with a huge ROAR swings her large mechanical arm at the 
               helicopter, sending it spinning to the ground.

                         It's no use!! Our firepower has no 
                         effect!!

               Suddenly, Kyle's mother comes running up.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Oh my God! It IS YOU!!!

               Mecha-Barbara looks down.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Oh I am SUCH a huge fan, Ms. 
                         Streisand!! I never thought I'd live 
                         to see you in person!!

                                     MECHA STREISAND
                         KRAGHGHGH!!!!

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         I hate to ask this, but, could I get 
                         an autograph? My sister would DIE!

                         KRAGHGHG!!!

               Mecha-Streisand leans down, picks up the small pen and head 
               shot from kyle's mother, signs it, and hands it back.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Oh thank you, Ms. Streisand!!

                         GRAGHGHGH!!!!

               Mecha Streisand stomps on a couple more buildings and lays 
               waste to the entire town of South Park!

               Buildings, cars and trains are thrown around like toys.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         We're doomed!! Goodbye, Mr. Hat!

                         BA-BOO-RA!!! BA-BOO-RA!!!

               Mecha-Babs lets out a huge cry, then continues through the 
               town.

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         BARBARA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

               Babs stops and looks down at the ground, where Leonard Maltin 
               stands in front of her. BABS almost looks scared for a 
               moment... Then lets out a loud cry.

               Leonard Maltin crosses his arms over his chest.

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         KITTE! KITTE! CHURI-PU!!!

               Suddenly, Leonard Maltin starts to grow!! Babs watches in 
               shock as Leonard Maltin becomes ULTRA-LEONARD MALTIN!!

                                     JAPANESE VOICE
                              (Out of nowhere)
                         ULLLTURAAA MARUTIN!!!!

               Finally, when Leonard is the same size as Babs, he gets in a 
               Kung-Fu fighting stance.

               Babs gets in a stance of her own, and the two start fighting 
               each other.


               Chef and the boys come running in to see Mecha-Streisand and 
               Ultra-Maltin fighting.

               Everything around them is burning and crashing to the ground.

                                     CHEF
                         Look out, children!!

               Mecha-Streisand's huge foot crashes down next to Kenny and 
               smashes a car. People run through frame, screaming.

               A flaming storefront then crashes down, the boys jump out of 
               the way, just in time.

               Just then, Kenny walks over to a Tetherball pole and boredly 
               hits the ball. The rope to the ball gets caught around Kenny's 
               neck, and Kenny gets strangled up next to the pole.

               Kenny turns blue, then purple, then pink.

               Mecha-Streisand hits Ultra-Maltin and his huge body falls to 
               the ground, just missing Chef and the boys.

               Kyle turns around and sees Kenny, wrapped around the 
               Tetherball pole.

                                     STAN
                         Oh my God!! They killed Kenny!!

                                     KYLE
                         You bastards!!

               Suddenly, an older black man flies down next to Chef.

                                     SIDNEY POITIER
                         What's going on, here?!

                                     CHEF
                         Sidney Poitier?!?!

                                     SIDNEY POITIER
                         That's right, I'm Sidney Poitier.

                                     CHEF
                         Damn man, it's nice to meet you! THE 
                         Sidney Poitier in MY home town!!

                                     SIDNEY POITIER
                         Barbara Streisand has found the 
                         triangle of Zinthar?

                                     CHEF
                         Yup. She's made the diamond of 
                         Pantheos, alright.

                                     SIDNEY POITIER
                         KOO_RA KOO RA SUKI!!!

               Sidney Poitier turns into a Gamera-turtle thing Sidney Poitier 
               and flies over to help Leonard Maltin do battle.

                                     JAPANESE SINGER
                         MEGA POITIER!! MEGA POITIER!! SUGOI 
                         KUROI DA NE!!! MEGA POITIER!! MEGA 
                         POITIER!!

               Chef looks to his right, where we actually see the Japanese 
               singer, in a suit, singing into a microphone.

                                     CHEF
                         Is that really necessary?


               Now shit is REALLY going down.

               The boys watch in awe as Helicopters, tanks and missles fly 
               at Mecha-Babs as she wrestles and fights with both Ultra 
               Maltin and Mega-Poitier.

               Mecha-Streisand is the obvious stronger, as she picks up 
               Mega Poitier, spins him over her head and throws him over 
               the mountains.

               Ultra-Maltin tries his eye lasers, but Mecha-Babs just puts 
               out her hand, and stops them easily.

               Then she tilts her head back, and shoots BIGGER lasers out 
               her nose, which strike Leonard Maltin and send him flying 
               backwards in pain.

               Mecha-Babs throws her arms up in victory.

                                     CHEF
                         It's over... She's too strong for 
                         them children. We'll have to leave 
                         town.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Make it go away!! I hate Barbara 
                         Streisand! I hate her!!

                                     STAN
                         My mom always said there are no 
                         monsters, but there are, aren't there, 
                         Chef...

                                     CHEF
                         We have to say goodbye to South 
                         Park...

               Mecha-Babs continues her havoc.

               Just then, Robert Smith walks up to Chef and the boys.

                                     ROBERT SMITH
                         Am I too late?

                                     CHEF
                         Who are you?

                                     STAN
                         Dude! That's Robert Smith of The 
                         Cure!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Sweet!!

                                     ROBERT SMITH
                         Here, you boys hold this walkie. You 
                         can help me fight her.

               Robert hands the boys a small walkie talkie.

                                     CHEF
                         You can try Robert Smith, but that 
                         thing just beat the crap out of 
                         Leonard Maltin AND Sidney Poitier!!

                                     ROBERT SMITH
                         I have to try. I can't let Barbara 
                         Streisand do this to the entire world.

               Robert Smith spins around...

                                     JAPANESE SINGER
                         ROB-ATO SUMISU!! ROB-ATO SUMISU!!

               Mecha-Babs turns around and sees the thriving metropolis of 
               Denver in the distance. She smiles a big mechanical smile 
               and heads towards it.

               But then, behind her another huge figure appears. It is 
               Mothora Robert Smith!!!

               Now Babs looks really, really scared.

               Robert opens his huge mouth and lets out one of his high 
               pitched screams.

               Babs tries to cover her ears as windows all over the buildings 
               still standing shatter.

               Mecha-Babs retaliates with her own high pitched note. Robert 
               covers his ears and even more windows break.

               Stan has the little talkie around his wrist. Leonard Maltin, 
               back to normal size and looking severely beaten, walks up 
               next to the boys.

                                     LEONARD MALTIN
                         We must tell him that her weak point 
                         is the nose...

               Stan talks into the walkie.

                                     STAN
                         Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot 
                         punch!

               The huge Robert Smith looks down at Stan and nods.

               Just then Mecha-Babs charges Smith!! But Smith hits a switch 
               on his arm which sends the end of his arm flying!!

               It hits Babs square in the nose.

               Babs reels back with a horrific scream. The Diamond of 
               Pantheos flies out of her nose and lands right at Kyle's 
               feet.

                                     KYLE
                         The diamond of Pantheos!! She must 
                         be powerless now!!

                                     STAN
                              (Into walkie)
                         Quickly, Robert Smith, she's 
                         powerless!!

               Robert runs up to the Dazed Mecha-Streisand and grabs her by 
               the mechanical tail.

               He spins her round and round and round...

                                     JAPANESE SINGER
                         ROBAT-O SUMISU!! ROBAT-O SUMISU!!!

               Finally, after gaining enough momentum, Robert lets go. And 
               Mecha-Streisand goes flying into outer space.


               Mecha-Streisand flies outward from Earth and continues on 
               past the moon.

               She lets out a horrific cry. As her huge body gets past the 
               moon, it explodes like a nuclear bomb. Body pieces flying 
               everywhere.


               The explosion in the sky looks beautiful from South Park. 
               Like a huge firework.

                                     STAN
                         He DID IT!!!

                         NO MORE BARBARA STREISAND EVER!!!

                                     STAN
                         Wow, Robert Smith is the greatest 
                         person that ever lived!!

                         Our Savior!!

               Robert Smith shrinks back to normal size.

                                     ROBERT SMITH
                         Can I have my walkie talkie back 
                         now, please?

               Cartman is holding it now.

                         Well, that whole experience sure did 
                         suck.

                         But you know, I've learned something 
                         today. I've learned that people who 
                         want power, a lot of power, always... 
                         end up dead.

                                     STAN
                         Yeah.

                         Yes, and I've learned something too. 
                         Robert Smith kicks ass.

               The ground rumbles. The boys look around in panic.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh, no!! She's back!!!

                                     STAN
                         Oh my God! LOOK!!

               A HUGE, HUGE IKE steps out from behind the house.

                                     BOYS
                         AGHGHGH!!!!! MECHA-IKE!!!!
