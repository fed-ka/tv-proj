                                          "PLAYING GOD"

                                              TEASER

          FADE IN:

  11INT. SMITH HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

          Johnny has brewed two different pots of coffee. 

          JOHNNY opens a cupboard and begins to take out various
          colored mugs with logos or cartoon characters.  He stops,
          regards a mug in his hand, reconsidering.


  22INT. SMITH HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Johnny opens a cabinet, revealing Vera Smith's fine china.

                                                                              TIME CUT:


  33JOHNNY

          has set out five saucers and cups on the dining room table. 
          Again, he hesitates, unsure.

          The doorbell rings.


  44INT. SMITH HOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

          Door opens, SARAH stands there with a boxed deli platter.

                                        SARAH
                        Hey.  Is anyone here yet?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're the first.  That from Sam's?

          He steps aside as Sarah enters, heads for the kitchen,
          passing through the dining room.

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah, bagels and smoked salmon.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I made coffee.  Regular, and decaf
                        for Jason.  Do you think that's...

          Sarah stops upon seeing the table setting.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: PLAYING GOD - TEASER - 1/17/03 WHITE        2.


    4CONTINUED:4

                                        SARAH
                        What's with the fine china?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I... wasn't sure what the etiquette
                        for this kind of thing was.

                                        SARAH
                        Etiquette?  These are your best
                          friends, Johnny.  And mine.  Are
                        you nervous? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's been seven years since they've
                        seen me, and about fifteen since
                        we've been "best friends."  Don't
                        tell me this'll be just like old
                        times.  Especially with Jason's
                        medical condition...

          The doorbell rings.  Sarah sighs. 

                                        SARAH
                        Regular mugs.  And let's set up
                        in the living room.

          Sarah opens the door to reveal two very different women. 
          KATE MOORE, 35, dressed California Casual and laid-back,
          an eager grin on her face, and ERIN MOORE, 37, the
            estranged wife of Kate's brother.  Erin is buttoned tight
          into a Donna Karan suit, insecure and out of her element.

          Sarah breaks into a grin that mirrors Kate's, and they
          embrace like they were back in 12th grade.

                                        KATE
                        You look like hell...

                                        SARAH
                        You're a beast... 

          Erin reacts to the exchange with surprise.  Sarah notices.

                                        SARAH
                        Just a joke, we used to-

                                        ERIN
                        Got it.
                                (extends hand)
                        I'm Erin, Jason's wife...

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah, we met at your wedding.  It
                        must've been a blur...


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: PLAYING GOD - TEASER - 1/17/03 WHITE        3.


  4CONTINUED: (2)4

          Erin nods as if she remembers, which makes it clear she
          doesn't. 

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        Hi, Kate.

          Kate turns to see Johnny standing off to the side.

                                        KATE
                        Johnny.

          She takes in the cane, then approaches to hug him. 
          Johnny's body language says no, and Kate hears it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've kind of adopted a general,
                        no-hugs policy...

                                        KATE
                        Oh, my God, that's right, I'm
                        sorry. I knew, I just forgot . 

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's okay.

                                        KATE
                        If I touch you, you see my future.

                                        SARAH
                                (keeping it light)
                        Or your past.

          Kate chuckles, then sets about disarming Johnny.

                                        KATE
                        Well, that's already covered. 
                        You've seen the blue hair, junior
                        year, it doesn't get any worse
                        than that.  And as for the
                          future... I haven't told anyone
                        yet, but I'm planning on switching
                        yoga instructors.  I also believe
                        I'm gonna get screwed on my tax
                        return, and I anticipate not
                          learning Golf or flying to Thailand
                        or about half of my other New
                        Years resolutions...

          Johnny smiles broadly and cuts her off with a hug.  No
          ramp in, no vision sound, because he doesn't get a vision. 

                                        KATE
                        Was I right?



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: PLAYING GOD - TEASER - 1/17/03 WHITE        4.


  4CONTINUED: (3)4

                                        JOHNNY
                        Doesn't work every time.

                                        KATE
                          Buzzkill, after all that.  Here...

          She pulls out a banner from a plastic party store bag. 
          It has sequins and reads "WELCOME HOME!"

                                        KATE
                        Touch this and describe Jason's
                        face when he sees it.

                                        ERIN
                        Kate, I really don't think it's a
                        good idea to surprise Jason in
                        his condition.

                                        KATE
                        C'mon, you know he's gonna love
                        it...


  55INT. TOWN CAR - DAY

          JASON MOORE, 37, sits in the back seat, staring out the
          window.  Cleaves Mills rolls by in the reflective surface
          of his sunglasses.  He's not smiling.


  66EXT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY

          The town car pulls up and parks.  Jason steps out, wearing
          an expensive suit and overcoat.  He walks to the house.


  77INT. SMITH HOUSE FOYER - DAY

          Johnny opens the door.  Jason is still wearing sunglasses. 
          They regard each other in silence for a moment.  Then...

                                        JASON
                        Still living with your folks,
                        huh?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, and they left me the key to
                        the liquor cabinet.  Step inside.

          Jason smiles and steps in, but his smile drops as he sees
          the "WELCOME HOME" banner hung across the living room
          archway.  He takes off his sunglasses.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: PLAYING GOD - TEASER - 1/17/03 WHITE        5.

                                        JASON
                        What the...

          Kate peeks her head around the corner.

                                        KATE
                                  (whispering)
                          Surprise...

          Sarah and Erin step out as well.  Sarah grins, and Erin
          looks nervous, with good reason.  Jason is stone-faced.

                                        JASON
                        What the hell is this?  Some kind
                        of joke?

                                        KATE
                        Jason, this is for you...

                                        JASON
                                (venom directed at
                                Kate)
                        I flew back here to talk to
                        Johnny, not sit in a healing circle
                        and hold hands.

          Jason shakes his head, steps forward and with one swift
          motion pulls the Welcome Home banner down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey!  You want to talk, let's
                        talk.

          Off Jason, letting the banner drop.


  88INT. SMITH HOUSE - BASEMENT

          Jason clomps down the stairs.  Johnny follows.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Come on man, it's just the four
                        of us, what's the deal?

          Jason stops and turns to face Johnny. 

                                        JASON
                        What's the deal?  I'm dying, that's
                        the deal.  I'm dying and everyone's
                          throwing a party.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wait a minute, I thought you were
                        in rehabilitation...

                        over.  It got worse.

                                        JASON (CONT'D)
                        They put me on the waiting list
                        for a transplant.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?

          Jason talks fast, releasing his anger.

                                        JASON
                        My heart's done.  Finished.  I
                        need a new one, or...  so I'm on
                        a list.  I'm taking these tests,
                        they're telling me I have a high
                        chance of rejection so even if
                        they FIND a heart in time it
                          probably won't work with me.  I
                        mean, I pulled down two million
                        dollars last year, Johnny.  I'm
                        37 years old do I look like a guy
                        who's not gonna make it through
                        the month?

          Jason stands there, catching his breath, reflexively
          touching his chest.  Johnny is stunned. 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (softly)
                        Jason, if that's the case... what
                        the hell are you doing here? 
                        Don't you have to wait near your
                          hospital, in case they call?

                                        JASON
                        I'm sick of waiting, that's all I
                        do, everyday...
                                (takes out his BEEPER)
                        That's all I am.  I need to know. 
                        That's why I called you, Johnny. 
                        I need to know. 

          Johnny shakes his head, he hadn't even considered that...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to himself)
                        That's why you called me.

                                        JASON
                        I know it's been a long time,
                        it's awkward, maybe selfish, I
                        don't care.  I don't even care
                        what I believe any more...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Jason, I can't do that. 

          Jason takes off his sunglasses, stares at Johnny. 

                                        JASON
                        I read that article about you,
                        and that kid.  The hockey player. 
                        Did you really see his heart was
                        gonna stop? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can't just... do you know how
                        many letters I get, from people
                        in hospitals, begging me to touch
                        them and tell if they're gonna
                        make it, or how long they've got?

                                        JASON
                        I'm not "people in hospitals"
                        Johnny, I'm your friend.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  And that's why I thought
                        you wanted to see me.

                                        JASON
                        If this ends our friendship or
                        ends my life, what's the
                          difference?  I can't keep going
                        like this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's that supposed to mean...

                                        JASON
                        It means all things considered
                        I'd rather go out surrounded by
                        women and drugs.  I'm sure Erin
                          wouldn't mind the insurance payoff.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't even think that.  There's
                        still time. 

          Jason holds out his right hand, palm up. 

                                        JASON
                        Can you promise me that?

          Johnny stares at Jason's outstretched hand.

                                        JASON
                        I'm not asking for hope.  Just
                        peace.  That's all I want.  And
                          whatever you tell me, that's all
                        I'm gonna take away.

          Johnny's stare shifts from Jason's hand to his eyes. 
          Raw, unwavering, and expectant.  After a long beat, Johnny
          looks back down at Jason's palm. 

          CLOSE ON JASON'S PALM - open... waiting... until Johnny's
          hand grasps it with an audible CLAP.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

  99INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 

          Double doors BURST OPEN as two MALE NURSES rush a red and
          white COOLER down the hallway.  TRACK with it... 


  1010INT. HOSPITAL O.R. - DAY

            A SURGEON and his OPERATING TEAM are hard at work on a
          heart transplant, their PATIENT is Jason, his face half-
          covered by a respirator, and drained of color. 

                                        SURGEON
                        Prep for shock...


  1111CLOSE ON THE HEART (STOCK FOOTAGE)

          as an electric shock is administered to start it beating. 
          And beat it does. 


  1212CLOSE ON THE EKG

          as the flat-line begins rhythmically spiking, along with
          the familiar beeps. 

          BACK on the operating team.  The Surgeon nods. 

                                        SURGEON
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a
                        winner.  Get ready to close...

          PAN OFF the Surgeon to find JOHNNY standing in the room,
          wearing his normal clothes.  He smiles and we WHITE-BLUR --

          OUT OF THE VISION:


  1313EXT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY

          The same grin on Johnny's face as he releases Jason's
          hand.  Jason can tell Johnny experienced something.  We
          can tell Johnny is hugely relieved.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a
                        winner.

          Jason doesn't understand at first, then his eyes widen.          DEAD ZONE: PLAYING GOD - ACT ONE - 1/17/03 WHITE      10.


  1414INT. SMITH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Sarah is handing Erin a cup of coffee from a regular mug,
          and Kate is taking down the "Welcome Home" banner when
          they hear a HOLLER from outside, somewhat like a cheering
          football fan. 

          Sarah and Erin head to the door to see what's happened. 
          Kate does not.  Instead, she smiles to herself.


  1515EXT. CLEAVES MILLS HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT

          Most of the windows are darkened, but multi-colored lights
          flash from some of the windows on the first floor.  We
          can hear the dull throb of bass from inside.  

          Three GIRLS in their twenties, dressed for a night out,
          move past us and toward the main entrance.  We move down
          to reveal signage: "CLEAVES MILLS HIGH SCHOOL."


  1616INT. SCHOOL LIBRARY - NIGHT

          It's a PARTY.  Fifty-plus PEOPLE dance, grab drinks off
          an open bar, sit cross-legged on tables and talk.  A DJ
          spins 80's music from a turntable set-up behind the
          librarian's desk.  The whole sight is rather surreal. 

          JASON, dressed in expensive party clothes, double-fisting
          blinis, makes his way through some revelers and up to the
          DJ.  He hands the DJ a blini and takes the microphone. 
          The music winds to a halt and everyone turns to Jason.

                                        JASON
                        May I have your attention please! 
                        My name's Jason Moore, and I'll
                        be your host for this evening.
                        Some of you here tonight are
                        family, some of you are friends,
                        some of you are wondering... who
                        the hell is this guy?  Well, I'm
                        the guy who paid for this party!

            Laughter, applause, and mild hooting from the party.  We
          now see JOHNNY, talking to two twentysomethings, probably
          former students of his.  We also see Erin, standing near
          Sarah, carefully watching Jason with a look of concern.

                                        JASON
                        Good ol' Cleaves Mills.  All you
                        gotta say is "free drinks, spread
                        the word," and half the town shows
                        up.

                                (laughter from room)
                        Let's take a survey.  How many of
                        you here tonight attended this
                        fine educational institution?

          CHEERS go up from both the younger and older crowd.

                                        JASON
                        Me, too.  Class of '84, on account
                        of being held back in '82.  Best
                        five years of my life.  But that's
                        not why I'm here, it's not why
                        you're here, this ain't a reunion
                        this is a party.  So enjoy
                          yourselves.  We're all here for
                        the hell of it and I wouldn't
                        want it any other way!  

          And with that the MUSIC kicks back in.  People begin
          dancing.  Jason downs his drink and jumps down off the
          desk.  Johnny approaches him with a smile.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't believe you were able to
                        rent out the school library.

                                        JASON
                        Could you think of a better place
                        to celebrate my secret good news?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just can't see how you got Pelson
                        to agree to it.

          Jason smiles and whispers to Johnny.

                                        JASON
                        'Tis better to ask forgiveness
                        than permission. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Glad to see some people can change.

          Jason grins, and then is SPRAYED by champagne by a nearby
          REVELER.  Jason laughs and wrestles the bottle away from
          the guy, making sure the last spritz goes into the
          prankster's face.  Johnny wipes some off his shirt.

                                        SARAH
                        My students aren't going to believe
                        this.

          Erin is troubled, looking at Jason across the room.

                                        ERIN
                        I'm having trouble believing it
                        now.

                                        SARAH
                        I know this has gotta be hard for
                        you.  If you ever need to talk...
                        I've actually been through a
                        similar situation. 

                                        ERIN
                        You have?

                                        SARAH
                          Intensive care units,
                          rehabilitation, trying to explain
                        it all to your kids.  And also
                        just what you go through,
                          personally...

                                        ERIN
                                (distant)
                        Jason and I don't have kids. 
                                (beat)
                        I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sound
                        short or... will you please excuse
                        me for a second?

          Sarah nods, watches Erin cross toward Jason.

          ON JOHNNY

          Making his way around the perimeter of the "dance floor,"
          a carpeted area of cleared away tables.

          On the dance floor, looking great in a simple dress.  She
          slows down as she spots Johnny heading toward the doors.

          Johnny steps out into the hallway to get some fresh air. 
          Kate steps out a beat later.

                                        KATE
                        High school friends approaching
                        middle age and serious health
                          problems throw a party on the
                        sacred spot where they once swore
                        to never grow old. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I fail to see the irony.

                                        KATE
                        Me too.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Though now I wish we swore to
                        never have serious health problems.

          Johnny nods to his cane.  Kate smiles.

                                        KATE
                        Well, a car accident's not
                          something you can really prevent...

          An awkward beat... how did they get on this subject? 
          Kate decides to change it.

                                        KATE
                        So, I want to thank you... for
                        Jason. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you mean?

                                        KATE
                        He told me what you saw, Johnny.

          This seems to really upset Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He wasn't supposed to tell
                          anybody.

                                        KATE
                        Well, he had to tell me.  I'm the
                        reason he came to see you.

          Johnny looks at Kate, surprised and curious.

          Jason is by the DJ, making a request.  He turns around to
          head back to the party proper, and comes face to face
          with Erin, who doesn't look happy.

                          yourself?

                        What did you and John Smith talk
                        about on his driveway?

                        Johnny Smith.

                        I want to know what's going on.

                                        JASON
                        Is there some rule against having
                        fun?

                                        ERIN
                        With terminal heart disease, yeah,
                        we can probably find a rule
                        somewhere.

          This seems to sober Jason up a bit.

                                        JASON
                        Lemme ask you something, if I do
                        get a new heart, are we just gonna
                        resume the divorce talk?

                                        ERIN
                        What kind of question...

                                        JASON
                        I'm just wondering.  I need an
                        operation, and suddenly you're
                        saying let's work things out. 
                        You're here for me when times are
                        bad, but let's say they get good
                        again.  You gonna stick around?

                                        ERIN
                          Jason... since when did you like
                        to spend your good times with me?

          Jason's silence gives us a pretty good picture of where
          the problems in this marriage stem from.

                        Well, I can't read minds.  I
                        usually just see what happened,

  2424INT. HOSPITAL E.R. - DAY

          (Re-dressed Hospital O.R.).  Blood seeping through hospital
          sheets, blood on the E.R. DOCTOR's scrubs.  Weak beeps
          from an EKG.  Scrambling NURSES (cannot see PATIENT)...

                                        E.R. DOCTOR
                        See if we can save the heart...

          Again we begin to REWIND at blinding speeds, watching the
          E.R. team UN-SCRAMBLE to save this person's life...

          2 EMTs appear and help the E.R. TEAM put the body back
          onto a gurney.


  2525THE EMTS WHEEL THE GURNEY BACKWARDS

          through the admission area out to a waiting AMBULANCE,
          which they load the gurney onto (one EMT back-stepping
          into the cab).

                                                                                FLASH TO:


  2626EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY

          The Ambulance drives in reverse up to an ACCIDENT SCENE -
          a FIRE TRUCK and several POLICE CARS are here.  A flipped
          over SMALL CAR has been smashed by a FORD F-150 truck. 
          In fast motion, the MET's hop out of the ambulance, open
          the back doors and drag a gurney back over to the car. 

                                                                                FLASH TO:


  2727EXT. INTERSECTION - SOME TIME BEFORE

          We watch the accident UN-HAPPEN in SLOW MOTION - The SMALL
          CAR flips back up, GLASS flies back into the driver's
          side window as the F-150 reverses away...

          And then the vision speeds up, the F-150 darts back out
          of the intersection (we see it ran a RED LIGHT), and the
          VISION FREEZES. 

          Pan around to see JOHNNY SMITH.

    27CONTINUED:27

          As he steps out we come around to see what he's looking
          at: The DRIVER of the SMALL CAR, about to be hit, eyes
          wide with fear...    

          Kate.

                                                                                FLASH TO:


  2828INT. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

          The entire vision took place within one shutter flash of
          Sarah's camera.  Sarah checks the tiny digital screen.

          INSERT - DIGITAL SCREEN


  2929KATE AND JASON

          are smiling, but Johnny's face is tranced.

                                        SARAH
                        Wait, let's do another, Johnny
                        you have to smile...

          But Johnny has stepped away from Kate and Jason,
            disorientated, dizzy from what he's seen.

                                        KATE
                        Johnny?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I... I'll be right back...

          Johnny heads for the exit.  Kate shrugs, and Sarah looks
          concerned.  But not as concerned as Jason, who stares
          after Johnny.

                        That's an unusual request, Johnny.


  3131INT. PURDY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Johnny sits across from Purdy at his desk.

                                        PURDY
                        How do you know your friend isn't
                        going to receive a donor heart in
                        time?  Did you foresee this?

    31CONTINUED:31

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, you don't understand, he's
                        going to have a successful
                          transplant.  But at the cost of
                        his Sister's life.

                                        PURDY
                        How?

                                        JOHNNY
                        My vision followed the heart back
                        to Kate, to an accident, sometime
                        in the near future I don't know
                        when.  It looked like she was hit
                        by a drunk driver, but I don't
                        know.

                                        PURDY
                        Surely you can find out, if you
                        put yourself to the task.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, but if I prevent the
                          accident, Jason won't get a heart,
                        and he'll die.

                                        PURDY
                        You don't know that.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're right, but... I do know he
                        runs a high risk of organ
                        rejection, so receiving Kate's
                        heart makes a sick kind of sense.

          Purdy nods, taking a deep breath.

                                        PURDY
                        You were right to come to me about
                        this.  It's not a dilemma you
                        should have to face on your own.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I didn't come here seeking
                          guidance, Gene.  I need another
                        heart.  I don't plan on choosing
                        which one of my friends to save,
                        and which one to let die.

                                        PURDY
                        Good.  Because I don't think that's
                        your choice to make.

                        I can't just sit and do nothing. 
                        Your organization has the power
                        to cut through the red tape, get

                        it takes to find another heart
                        besides Kate's. 

          Purdy is silent, looking out his window.

                                        PURDY
                        I don't think it's going to be
                        that easy..
                                (turns to Johnny)
                        You may be challenging a fate
                        that God has intended.

                                (shakes his head)
                        I thought, according to you, that's
                        exactly what God intended me to
                        do.

  3232INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

          Sarah and Kate lunch at a booth, Kate fawning over a photo
          of JOHNNY JR.

                                        KATE
                        He's gorgeous, Sarah.  Face it,
                        you have a gorgeous son.

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah, he's a little lady-killer
                        in waiting.

          Kate hands the photo back to Sarah.*

                                        SARAH
                        So... what's up?

                                        KATE
                        Huh?

                                        SARAH
                        On the phone, you said you had
                          something important to ask me.
                                (off Kate's nod)
                        Well, come on, the suspense is
                          unbearable.

                                        KATE
                        It's about Johnny.

          Sarah didn't expect to hear that.

                                        SARAH
                        Oh.  What is it, do you "like"
                        him or something? 

          Sarah meant it as a joke, but Kate's not laughing.

                                        KATE
                        We were talking last night, at
                        the party, and, I felt something
                        between us.  An attraction.  I
                        guess, yeah, I like him.  I mean
                        I know I do. 

                                        SARAH
                        You...
                                (beat)
                        Johnny?

                                        KATE
                        I know, believe me, it's not
                          something I expected, really, or
                        even planned, but it's there.
                                (beat)
                        But before I even allow myself to
                        think about it, I needed to talk
                        to you, to see how you felt.

                                        SARAH
                        About what?

          Kate doesn't answer, as Sarah didn't need to ask.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm married, Kate.  For over five
                        years, I mean, Johnny's his own
                        person.  He's not something for
                        me to keep or give away...

                                        KATE
                        I know.  But I'm asking you anyway.

          Sarah looks down, unable to respond.


          ANGLE ON - DOORWAY

          Johnny enters and stops, sees Sarah and Kate at their
          booth.  They do not see him yet. 

          BOOTH - Sarah takes a long look at the photo of Johnny
          Jr.  Maybe it is time to finally let go, all the way. 
          She turns to Kate.

                                        SARAH
                        I couldn't imagine anyone better
                        for him, than you.

          And for a moment Kate sees in Sarah's face just how
          brutally difficult this last year has been for her, these
          last six years.  Kate reaches out and puts her hand over
          Sarah's.  Johnny walks up. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey. 

                          KATESARAH
              Hi.Hey.

          Awkward pause.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry I'm late... who wants to
                        scooch over?

                                        SARAH
                          Actually, you know what, I think
                        I'm gonna scooch out.  I kind of
                        have to run.

          Johnny and Kate ad-lib overlapping protestations, "no,
          c'mon," etc.

                                        SARAH
                        No, really, it's... I gotta pick
                        up J.J. from soccer practice.
                                (to Johnny)
                        You have lunch.
                                (to Kate)
                        You have dessert.  I'll see both
                        of you for dinner tomorrow.

          Johnny sits as Sarah exits.  Kate turns to watch her go,
          conflicted.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What were you two talking about
                        before I showed up?

          Kate turns back to him.

                        That was a serious, heart-to-heart
                        moment I just walked into.

          Kate smiles to herself.

                                        KATE
                        Yeah, well, the good news is we're
                        all adults now, so we're allowed
                        to have more serious heart to
                        heart moments. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that a fact?

                                        KATE
                        Yeah.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So... what was this one about?

          And Kate may be thinking, "Guess now's as good a time as
          any..."

                                        KATE
                        I like you, Johnny.  I don't know
                        what that means to you in the
                        context of everything that's going
                        on, but I've always liked you.

          Kate worries as Johnny takes a deep breath.

                                        KATE
                        And first, before you say anything,
                        I have to say that I'm sorry...
                        for not coming to see you after
                        you recovered.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Kate, that's not important --

                                        KATE
                        It's important to me.  It matters
                        to me because I think it was wrong. 
                        They said you were crippled, you
                        had brain damage... I was afraid
                        to see you, and that was wrong. 
                        And then when I read about you
                        helping the police, and that you
                        were having psychic visions, I
                        didn't know what to think about
                        that.  At the time I felt, that
                        wasn't you anymore.  That the
                        person I knew before was gone.

                                (beat)
                        But I didn't ask you that.  I
                        didn't call you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That was over a year ago.  A lot's
                        changed since then.

                                        KATE
                        I just need you to know, it wasn't
                        because I didn't care.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know.

                                        KATE
                        Maybe this is crazy, it's been
                        too long, everyone's changed... I
                        just had it in my head that we
                        could start over somehow.  It's
                        like so much time's gone by but
                        so what?  What've we got to lose?

          Partly to comfort her, partly because he really wants to,
          Johnny reaches over and takes Kate's hand.

          Just as he does we hear a HORN.  Johnny WHIPS HIS HEAD TO
          THE LEFT (Kate doesn't notice)...

    3535JOHNNY/KATE'S POV - DAY

          As a red FORD F-150 screams at us, headlights BLINDING...


  3636EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY (VISION)

          In an impressive VFX shot, The F-150 slams into the
          driver's side of Kate's compact in AGONIZING SLOW MOTION.

          SHARDS OF WINDOW GLASS radiate out toward us, almost
            beautiful in the way they spread out, twinkling.  ONE
          SHARD flips super-close, filling the frame, twisting past
          us and we PAN with it to REVEAL JOHNNY SMITH, watching
          the (now-offscreen) crash in horror, as the tiny glass
          shards fly through and around his form.

          SHIFT TO NORMAL SPEED, we hear the offscreen accident
          SCREECH to a bloody halt.  Johnny continues to stare for
          a beat, then summons his courage and walks over.

































                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: PLAYING GOD - ACT TWO - 1/29/03 GREEN      28.


    36CONTINUED:36

          We PAN with him to reveal the final resting place of both
          cars. 

          Johnny circles the frozen wreck.  Bits of glass and debris
          still hang in the air.  The HEADLIGHTS from the F-150
          still blind him, the DRIVER's face buried in an airbag. 
          The front grill is buried in the compact's caved in body.

          JOHNNY'S POV - TRUCK LICENSE PLATE

          Only half of the plate is visible, twisted and jutting
          out from crushed metal.  "488///"

          Suddenly Johnny becomes very conscious of something in
          his periphery.  He knows what it is, and is reluctant to
          see it, but also feels compelled to at the same time.

          It's Kate.  Wedged in her car, head bowed, hair matted
          with blood.  Johnny is struck by the sight.  Suddenly
          Kate's bloody face snaps up, eyes filled with surprise.

                                        KATE
                        Johnny.


  3737INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

          Johnny snaps out of his vision, dropping her hand.

          Kate's looking at him with the same surprised expression.

                        What is it?  What's wrong?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Nothing, I just... I was just
                          thinking I need more time.  To
                        think. 

          Kate's amused by his stumbling.

                                        KATE
                        Hey, no rush, no pressure.  Far
                        as I'm concerned, we have all the
                        time in the world to think about
                          thinking.

                        By his willingness to sacrifice
                        Isaac, Abraham gave definition to
                        faith.  But did he really pass
                        the test God had set before him? 
                        Or did he in fact fail it damn it
                        I have to start over.

                        Will you excuse us for a moment?

          The TV people leave as Purdy approaches Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry to interrupt.  Did you have
                        any luck yet?

          Purdy waits till the door is shut.  He whispers.

                                        PURDY
                        There exists an un-official network
                        of eyes and ears whose purpose is
                        to identify and monitor potential
                        donors.

                                (nods)
                        They're doing some advanced
                          scouting based on the information
                        you've given me.  They have
                        confidence a match can be located.

          Johnny breathes a sigh of relief.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you, Gene.

          Purdy nods, uneasy.  Seems like he's holding back.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not sure what you thought
                        before, but the last thing I wanted
                        to do is to play God.

                                        PURDY
                        Johnny, don't you see?  You already
                        are.  Finding one heart for Jason
                        means taking it away from someone
                        else.  Someone who, due to our
                          intervention, may not live long
                        enough to get another chance. 

          Johnny shakes his head, he hadn't considered that.  His
          cell phone RINGS from his jacket pocket.

          Johnny, frustrated, digs for his phone.  Except when he
          touches it, his heart sinks.  It's Kate's voice, shaking.

          Johnny hurries out.  Purdy watches him go with a sad,
          almost knowing expression.

          Johnny moves as quickly as he can down the hallway. 
          Reaching double doors, he pounds the hand-plate.

          The doors open and 2 MALE NURSES rush past him with a red
          and white cooler.  Crossing HOSPITAL STAFF take no notice,

          Kate runs up from further down the hall.  She hugs Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What happened?

          Kate leads him down the hall.

                                        KATE
                        I don't know.  Erin said he was
                        fine at lunch, and then when they
                        got back to the hotel he just
                        passed out in the elevator. 

          Up ahead, Johnny sees Erin pacing by the door to the CCU
            (Coronary Care Unit).  She spots Kate and Johnny, and
          heads toward them.  Then, behind her, the door opens and
          DR. HITSKY (same Surgeon from transplant vision) steps
          out.  Erin turns around and Kate speeds up to get there.

                                        ERIN
                        Is he alright?

                                        DR. HITSKY
                                (glancing at others)
                        Perhaps we should talk in my
                        office.

                                        ERIN
                          Whatever you have to say, you can
                        say in front of them.

                                        KATE
                        I'm Jason's sister.

                                        DR. HITSKY
                        For the time being, Jason's been
                          stabilized.  He's breathing
                          normally, he'll be regaining
                          consciousness in a few minutes.

                                        ERIN
                        What do you mean "for the time
                        being?"




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: PLAYING GOD - ACT TWO - 1/17/03 WHITE      33.


    43CONTINUED:43

                                        DR. HITSKY
                        The condition of his heart is
                          deteriorating rapidly, and it's
                        not something we can reverse.  We
                        can only keep it going with
                        medication for a short time.  I
                        just got off the phone with Jason's
                        transplant coordinator in New
                        York, and we've moved him to Status
                          1 effective immediately-

                                        JOHNNY
                        How much time.

          Hitsky stares at Johnny, who is forcing him to the really
          bad news.  He looks back to Erin. 

                                        DR. HITSKY
                          A viable heart has to be located
                        within the next 24 hours.  It's
                        the only real option.  

                                        ERIN
                        Twenty four hours?

          Erin releases an involuntary laugh of disbelief.  She
          takes a step backward, steadies herself against the wall
          with a wobbly arm. 

          Kate turns to Johnny, and the look in her eye is clear:
          she believes everything is going to be alright.   Johnny
          nods, trying to send back a silent reassurance. 

          Kate moves to comfort Erin, helping her to a nearby chair.

                                        KATE
                        Here.  Breathe deep.  Take a deep
                        breath.  Listen to me, it's going
                        to be fine.  This is not over.

          Off Johnny, the only one present who knows the truth:
          that it's Kate who has less than 24 hours to live...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:

  4444INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

          Johnny is hunched over in one of the chairs, head in his
          hands, one of which is pressing a cell phone to his ear.

                                        SECRETARY (PHONE)
                          Reverend Purdy is in a meeting
                        right now.  May I have him return
                        your call, Mr. Smith?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, Mary, I'll call back.

          Erin enters the room, nervous.  Johnny looks up at her.

                                        ERIN
                        Jason's awake.  He's asking for
                        you.


  4545INT. C.C.U. - DAY

          Johnny enters the room.  Kate is sitting by Jason, who's
          hooked up to an IV, and receiving oxygen.  He's weak, but
          his eyes spark up upon seeing Johnny. 

                                        JASON
                        There he is.  The great seer. 
                        Hiya doin', Johnny?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That depends on you.  How are you
                        doin'? 

                                        JASON
                        Can't you tell?  Or do you need
                        to shake my hand again?  Go ahead,
                        I don't need to know "if" anymore
                        and I don't care about "when."  I
                        just want you to tell me why you
                        lied.

                                        ERIN
                        What are you talking about?

          Johnny and Kate look at each other.

                                        JASON
                        You married a chump, Erin.  I
                          actually believed my friend wasn't
                        lying about his psychic powers.

                                        JASON (CONT'D)
                        I even believed him when he told
                        me he had a vision that I was
                        gonna get a heart in time.

                                        ERIN
                          A vision?

                                        KATE
                                (to Jason)
                        Don't get upset, you have to stay
                        calm.

                                        JASON
                        I am calm.

                                        ERIN
                                (turns to Johnny)
                        What did you do to him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He asked me to...

                                        JASON
                        I asked you for the truth.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And that's what I told you.

                                        JASON
                        No, you told me what I wanted to
                        hear because I was talking about
                          suicide. 

                                        KATE
                        What?

                                        JASON
                        You know, Johnny, when I said I'd
                        rather go out surrounded by women
                        and drugs I didn't mean nurses
                        and morphine.

          Jason laughs sickly, weakly to himself.

                                        JASON
                        That sounded pretty awful, didn't
                        it?  Maybe you were right to lie. 
                        Maybe I deserve this. 
                                (to Erin)
                        For the way I've been to you, at
                        least.

                                        KATE
                        You do not deserve this.

                                        JASON
                        Thanks, Sis, that's sweet, but
                        you know it doesn't mean jack. 
                        Only Johnny can tell me the truth.

                                        KATE
                        Leave him alone, he's your friend.

                                        JASON
                        How about it, Johnny?  Do I deserve
                        this?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe I should go.

                                        JASON
                        Know who you look like with that
                        coat and that cane?  You look
                        like Death.  On three legs.

                                        KATE
                        Shut up, Jason.

          Jason calmly turns his head to look at Kate.

                                        JASON
                        Sure, Kate.  After all, you got
                        what you wanted.  Right?

                                        KATE
                        What I wanted?

                                        JASON
                        You wanted to see Johnny.  That's
                        why you showed me that article on
                        him.  It wasn't for me, it was
                        for you.  My only question is, 
                        was he worth it? 

          Kate stands up, upset, and for a moment she looks like
          she's about to say something.  Instead she quickly walks
          out of the room, right past Erin and Johnny.

                                        JASON
                        Hey, where are you going?  Kate!

          Johnny heads out after her.  Jason's EKG beeps begin to
          quicken.  Erin crosses to him.  He looks up at her with
          eyes that are plainly scared to death of dying.

                                        JASON
                        I'm sorry.

                                        ERIN
                          I know...

                                        JASON
                        Will you tell everyone I'm sorry?

          He extends his hand to her and she takes it, now seeing
          his tears welling up.


  4646INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

          Kate, distressed, walks down the hall, heading to no
          particular destination.  Johnny steps out of the C.C.U.
          ward and follows her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Kate.  Stop.
                                (she doesn't)
                        Come on, I can't catch up.

          Kate stops, but doesn't turn around.  Johnny nears.

                                        KATE
                        Maybe he's right.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, he's scared out of his mind. 
                        And he's expressing it the only
                        way he knows how. 

                                        KATE
                        I did show him that article.  I
                        did pressure him to call you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We make our own decisions, Kate. 
                          I didn't have to do what he asked
                        me to do.

          Kate turns to him.

                                        KATE
                        Yes you did.  And he knew that. 
                        And so did I.  That's why this is
                        my fault.

          Johnny wants to comfort her, he wants to reach out.

                          I didn't think of the consequences. 
                        I just followed by stupid heart
                          wherever it wanted to go.  And
                        now look, now look...

          Kate is losing it.  Johnny pulls her close, holding a
          kiss to her forehead as she cries into his coat.

          We quickly begin a 360 turn around them, bringing us to...


  4747INT. SMITH HOUSE FOYER - DAY (VISION)

          Continue the 360 as Johnny and Kate are pulled apart,
          changing positions but not clothes.  They are in the middle
          of a fight.

                                        KATE
                        Hey!  Don't shout at me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then don't lie to me!

          Kate backs away, shaking her head.  She heads out the
          door.


    47A47AP.O.V. - SMITH HOUSE DRIVEWAY

          Looking out his window to watch Kate's car drive away.


  4848EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY

          BAM!  The F-150 smashes into Kate's car, minutes later.


  4949INT. HOSPITAL

          Johnny pulls back, shaken.  Kate looks at him, pleading.

                                        KATE
                        Just tell me, honestly, that you
                        didn't lie to Jason because you
                        thought it was the right thing. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I told him exactly what I saw. 
                        That he's going to get a heart.

                                        KATE
                        And do you still see that?

          Johnny nods, very pained.  But it seems to comfort Kate.

                        me.  He needs you, too, you know.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll be back soon.  I have to
                        take care of something.

                        We'll be here.

          Off Johnny, hoping that will be the case.


  5050EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

          Johnny walks to the parking lot, on his cell phone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can save her, Gene.  I can save
                        Kate, the visions showed me how. 
                        All I have to do is not get into
                        a fight with her tonight.


  5151INT. PURDY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS (INTERCUT PHONE)

          Purdy sits like stone, regarding his speakerphone.

                        There's a possible match in
                          Philadelphia.  They just harvested,
                        it could be flown up here in less
                        than two hours.

          Johnny punches the air.

                        That's good, that's great, that's
                        exactly what I want to hear. 
                        Now, you have the number of Jason's
                        transplant coordinator.  He's

                        Just another name I thought you
                        should hear.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who is she, the donor?

                                        PURDY
                        No.  She's a twenty eight year
                        old teacher who was diagnosed
                        with severe cardiomyopathy
                          following the birth of her second
                        child.  She's been waiting sixteen
                        months for a transplant.  Been
                          hospitalized for the last two. 

          During this, Johnny's heart has been slowly sinking, and
          he's been slowly sitting down onto the curb.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's the next name on the list.

                        I'd do anything to help you,
                        Johnny, you know that.  But I
                        don't know if I can do this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Have you found any other matches?

                                        PURDY
                        They're still looking.  But for
                        every match, there's another name.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Call me when you find another
                        match.

          Johnny hangs up.  He stares out into nowhere, struggling
          to see a way out of this.  He looks up into the sky.  The
          sun is rapidly setting, turning the clouds blood red. 
          The cell phone chatters in Johnny's cupped hands.  "Psychic
          Caller Id" tingles through his spine.  He picks up.

          Patrick Hanchin finishes his drink, and taps it on the
          bar.  He's not what we might have expected; in another
            universe, he might be a charming, successful guy.  But
          we're not in another universe.

          Hanchin fixes Johnny with a tired look.

                        What about bar stool philosophy?

          Patrick ignores Johnny, drains half his drink.  Johnny
          toys with his empty glass.  Talking out loud.

                        Guess I do have a problem, though.

                        are a bitch.

          Hanchin chuckles to Robbie, who shakes his head, grinning.

                        I wish it were that easy.

                                        HANCHIN
                        Aww, gee.  Are you depressed?  Is
                        that the problem, are you a sad
                        and lonely man in a bar?

          Johnny looks evenly at Patrick, studying him.

          He slides his drink out between he and Johnny.

                        Look at this glass.  Is it half
                        empty, or half full?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you think?

                        What do I think?

          Hanchin takes the glass, downs the rest of it in one tip,
          and smiles at Johnny. 

          Johnny can't help but smile back, and Patrick lets loose
          with a genuine laugh.  He extends his hand to Johnny.

                        Can't talk... you're dying to
                        talk about it.  Come on now, let
                        me help you.  The doctor is in.

                                        BARTENDER
                        Hope you have insurance.

                                        HANCHIN
                        Don't listen to him. 

          Johnny looks around, wonders what he's doing here.

                                        HANCHIN
                        How about this, just talk about
                        it in abstract terms.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Abstract terms.

                                        HANCHIN
                        Utterly abstract.

          Johnny looks down at the bar for a long time.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have two friends.  One of them
                        is going to die, and I have to
                        choose which one it's going to
                        be.

                                        HANCHIN
                        Is this a custody thing?  Sorry,
                          abstract, right.  You know I like
                        this, this reminds me of these
                        story riddles we used to do in
                        school.  You know in fifth grade,
                        I was marked as a gifted student.
                                (taps drink on bar)
                        Robbie, I need a thinking cap.

          As the Bartender comes over to refill.

                                        HANCHIN
                        Okay, tell me about my two friends.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you need to know?

                                        HANCHIN
                        Enough to make a decision.  Who
                        lives, who dies.

                                        JOHNNY
                          A decision.  You think you can...
                        okay, one's married, the other's
                        not.  One doesn't know she's gonna
                        die, the other thinks he is.

                                        HANCHIN
                        Uh-huh, go on...

          And Johnny does, growing more angry.

                                        JOHNNY
                        One of them's gentle, sweet,
                          outgoing...  The other, married
                        one has a good heart but needs to
                          seriously turn his life around. 
                          Actually, he doesn't have a good
                        heart.  She has a good heart, but
                        if she keeps it then someone else
                        in Philadelphia might die...

                                        HANCHIN
                        Whoa, wait, you're losing me...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Am I?  I'm sorry, I forgot to
                        mention that they both have brown
                        eyes.  Do you have enough criteria
                        yet?

                                        HANCHIN
                        Well you're leaving out a very
                          important component.  Me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You?  Well, you survive...

          Hanchin moves to the stool next to Johnny.

                                        HANCHIN
                        Yeah, I know I survive but how do
                        I feel?  Which one do I like
                        better?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's that easy, huh?  Just play
                        God, and go with what suits us
                        best.

    56CONTINUED: (4)56

                                        HANCHIN
                        First of all, don't bring God
                        into it, okay?  That asshole has
                        nothing to do with this.  This is
                        about you.  Making your own
                          choices, and not letting anyone
                        tell you what to do.  No preacher,
                        cop, mother, father, God, no. 
                        Your answer is right in front of
                        you.  You choose what you want. 

          Johnny stares into Hanchin's sad, angry eyes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe you're right.

          Johnny grabs a fistful of Hanchin's shirt and rears back
          to punch him.  But before he can we RAMP INTO HIS FACE--


  5757EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY (VISION)

          Johnny stands in the empty intersection.  Hanchin's Ford
          F-150 comes speeding up to the light, which clicks red
          above Johnny. 

          The F-150 runs the red light, roaring through the
            intersection without incident.

          Johnny seems satisfied, but then the camera begins to arc
          around him, and as it does the landscape around us begins
          to shift into...


  5858EXT. ANOTHER INTERSECTION - DAY (YEARS LATER)

          Johnny looks around.  Why is he here?  A pneumatic HISS
          attracts his attention.  Johnny turns to see a SCHOOL BUS
          dropping off a few KIDS.  The bus is still half full.  It
          starts up and Johnny whirls around to see the FORD F-150
          bearing down on the intersection.

          PUNCH IN TO SEE PATRICK HANCHIN, a few years older, some
          hair on his face and some grey in his hair, but still
          clearly drunk, muttering along to a classic rock song
          that's BLASTING from his speakers.

          Johnny, standing in front of the slow staring bus, throws
          his hands out in front of him, useless, as the...

          JOHNNY'S POV - F-150

          Drives straight into the CAMERA.          DEAD ZONE: PLAYING GOD - ACT FOUR - 1/17/03 WHITE     48.


  5959INT. BAR - RESUME

          The sounds of the COLLISION play over Johnny's face.  His
          punch stalls out as the sounds of screaming children and
          classic rock fade away into the scene.

          Hanchin, alarmed, swat's Johnny's arm away.

                                        HANCHIN
                        What are you doing?  Get off me!

                                        BARTENDER
                                (to Johnny)
                        That's it.  Out.  I want you out
                        of here right now.

          Johnny staggers back, tipping over his stool in the
          process.  He backs away, staring at Patrick in fear, then
          turns and hurries out.

          Patrick straightens his shirt, freaked out.

                                        HANCHIN
                        God damn.  We were just having a
                          conversation.  Psycho.  Robbie, I
                        spilled my drink...

          As Robbie, keeping an eye on the door, fills another one...


  6060EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Johnny's Jeep drives by camera.

          now close on Johnny's eyes...


  6868INT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY

          Johnny walks into his house, weary.  He throws his keys
          on the table, and that's when he hears the sound of a
          car, KATE'S CAR, pulling up outside (offscreen).

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

          He turns and heads for the door, flinging it open just as
          KATE is about to knock.  She's alarmed, then relieved to
          see him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you doing here?

                                        KATE
                        I was looking for you!  At the
                          hospital you said you'd come back,
                        and when you didn't, I got this
                        really horrible feeling...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why didn't you call me?

                                        KATE
                        I did.  You must've turned your
                        phone off.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (taking out his cell)
                        No, I've been using it-
                                (beat, realizing)
                        ...All day...

          Johnny looks at his phone, battery needing to recharge.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: PLAYING GOD - ACT FOUR - 1/17/03 WHITE     50.


    68CONTINUED:68

          He looks at Kate, looks around at the scene.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to himself)
                        This is how it happens.

          Furious, he hurls his cell phone against the wall,
          shattering it.

                                        KATE
                        Whoa!  What are you doing?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't see a way out of it, Kate. 
                        I can't see a way out.

          Kate watches Johnny pace, flirting with panic.

                                        KATE
                        He's not going to get a heart in
                        time, is he?

          Johnny leans into the wall with both of his hands.

                                        KATE
                          Jason... he's not going to make
                        it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't change what's going to
                        happen.

                                        KATE
                        I never asked you to change it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Things will be worse, I can't see
                        all the consequences.

          Kate walks up behind Johnny.

                                        KATE
                        I'm sorry I brought you into this. 
                          I thought that... I had a crazy
                        thought that I could save my
                          brother's life.

          Johnny closes his eyes, summoning the will to say the
          most difficult thing he's ever had to say.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't believe you.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: PLAYING GOD - ACT FOUR - 1/17/03 WHITE     51.


    68CONTINUED: (2)68

                                        KATE
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't believe you.  I think you
                        brought me into this for yourself.

          Kate is seriously caught off guard and wounded by that.

                                        KATE
                        How can you say something like
                        that?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (almost in disbelief)
                        Because it is the only thing I am
                        allowed to say...

                                        KATE
                        I don't understand.

          Johnny turns on her, tears in his eyes, shouting.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Neither do I!  Now GO!

                                        KATE
                        Hey! Don't shout at me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then don't lie to me!

          Kate looks at Johnny like he's possessed. 

                                        KATE
                        Don't lie? 

          Kate's wounded laugh reminds us of Jason's, when he saw
          the "Welcome Home" sign.

                                        KATE
                        I never told you what I was
                          thinking, I just thought you knew
                        how I felt about you.  Maybe I
                        didn't come out and say I loved
                        you, Johnny, but that doesn't
                        mean I lied.

          She backs away, walks out the door.  Johnny's legs suddenly
          feel very weak, and he leans back against the wall, sinking
          down to the floor, dropping his cane.

          As we hear the sound of Kate's CAR starting from right
          outside, Johnny covers his head with his hands, virtually

          crushed by fate.  Broken...

          We hear the sound of Kate's car pulling out the driveway...

                                                                                FADE TO:

  70A70AEXT. CEMETERY - DAY - CLOSE ON A STONE ENGRAVING

          of the word "MOORE."  We pull back to reveal a HEADSTONE
          with the full inscription: "KATE MOORE (1967-2003)"

          Johnny stands alone by her grave site.  Tons of flowers
          are still set around, remnants of the funeral and visits
          from other mourners. 

          Johnny looks up to see a figure approaching from afar. 
          It's Jason, wearing casual clothes.  Johnny doesn't move,
          looking down as Jason walks up.

          They stand in silence for a long beat.

                                        JASON
                          Sarah... told me you'd be here.

          Johnny nods.

                                        JASON
                        She read to me, what you said at
                        the funeral.  Your eulogy...

          Johnny, unable to hold it in, cuts him off.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I knew.

                                        JASON
                        I know.

                                        JASON (CONT'D)
                                (beat)
                        I realized that after... you
                        must've seen this from the
                        beginning.  I try to imagine what
                        that must have felt like...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I tried to stop it.  I tried to
                        save her.  Believe me, Jason, I
                          tried...

                                        JASON
                        Don't.  I know, Johnny.  I know
                        you.  And uh, Reverend Purdy,
                        he...

                                        JOHNNY
                        He talked to you?

          Johnny turns around, angry with Purdy's interference,
          even if it was on his behalf.

                                        JASON
                        Don't be mad, he did a good thing. 
                        He explained what happened, and I
                        needed that.  Because after the
                        doctor told me it was Kate who...
                          I wanted to die.

          Johnny turns to Jason, looks him in the eye.

                                        JASON
                        Then I thought, how selfish that
                        would be, and that's when I decided
                        that I'm gonna change.  I have to
                        change.  For Erin.  For Kate.

          All Johnny can do is nod.

                                        JASON
                        What do you have to do?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I... what do you mean?

                                        JASON
                        I mean I want to change.  What do
                        you want?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Nothing.  I want nothing.

          Johnny looks away, but Jason stares at him, waiting.

                        I don't want her to forgive me. 
                        I know that can't happen, I just...
                                (beat)
                        I just want her to know.  I want
                        her to know.

          Know why he had to do it, know that her heart was going
          to save Jason's life, know how Johnny felt about her,
          know everything that was kept from her.  Jason watches
          his friend suffering, and then, he does something
          completely out of character for the man he used to be. 
          He reaches out, and takes Johnny's hand.  And then, as if
          he's pledging allegiance, he presses Johnny's hand to his
          own heart, closing his own fist over it. 

          We PUSH IN to their hands...
