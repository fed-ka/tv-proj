  TIGHT ON CRIXUS as he spars with another MAN. He pauses, 
  glancing over at

  SPARTACUS

  carrying a litter burdened with Varro's body. Helping him as 
  pallbearers are HAMILCAR, RHASKOS, and an ND GLADIATOR. 
  Doctore leads them.

  THE OTHER GLADIATORS

  in the training square pause to pay their respects. DURO and 
  AGRON trade a somber look.

  VARRO'S BODY

  is carried to the gate where his wife AURELIA and young son 
  JANUS await. Varro's body is loaded onto the back of a cart. 
  Doctore nods to Aurelia. He and the other men then return to 
  the square. Spartacus lingers, attempting to find words to 
  express his sorrow.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Aurelia --

  She tears her shell-shocked gaze from her husband's face to 
  meet Spartacus' eyes.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.
  CONTINUED:

                                          AURELIA
                      Is it true? That he perished by 
                        your sword?

  Face wracked with anguish, Spartacus nods. Tears spill down 
  Aurelia's face.

                                          AURELIA(cont'd)
                      He loved you as a brother.

  Spartacus can muster no response. As Aurelia turns away, 
  ANGLE UP TO --

  THE BALCONY

  LUCRETIA and BATIATUS gaze down at the proceedings. NAEVIA 
  attends in the background.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Spartacus will not take this loss 
                        well.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And who's to fucking blame him?

  Batiatus turns, angrily exits into --



  SWORDS CLASH. The day's training is in full swing. Agron 
  trades blows with Spartacus. The champion is distracted and 
  unusually winded. His moves sloppy.

  CRIXUS

  glares at the lackluster display from across the square as 
  he hacks at a training palus. He grunts his disapproval to 
  Doctore nearby.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Behold, the mighty Champion of 
                        Capua.

                                          DOCTORE
                        A heavy heart weighs a man's sword.

  Spartacus breaks off from sparring with Agron. He crosses to 
  the water barrel, out of breath.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The loss of a brother is felt by 
                        every gladiator. We honor him not 
                        with tears, but with blood spilled 
                      in the arena.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Spoken as a true champion.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The games against Pompeii approach. 
                        Years I have been robbed of the 
                        primus by Solonius and his bribes. 
                        Finally it is secured by our 
                        Dominus, and who fights? Spartacus. 
                        The woman who grieves.

  BACK ON SPARTACUS

  as he drinks his water, sweat dripping from his increasingly 
  pallid skin. HECTOR appears, the burns on his face (from his 
  run-in with Spartacus in episode 110) still red and 
  inflamed. He glares, hating Spartacus almost as much as 
  Crixus.

                                        HECTOR
                        Spartacus. You are summoned.

  Spartacus follows Hector out of the square, WIPING US TO --



  Spartacus slows to a stop out on the sand. Confusion creases 
  his face as we reveal the TRAINING SQUARE IS EMPTY. 
  Spartacus blinks the sweat from his eyes, not comprehending.

  A HAND

  touches his shoulder, startling him. He whirls around to 
  find Mira has appeared behind him, her escort GUARD 
  lingering nearby. She regards Spartacus with concern.

                                        MIRA
                        Apologies. I called your name...

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  absently)(
                        I did not hear.

  She notes his pale features, his red-rimmed eyes.

                                        MIRA
                        You do not appear yourself.

                                          SPARTACUS

                        Did Dominus send you?

                                  nods)(
                      He would see your spirits raised.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        They do not deserve it.

                                        MIRA
                        Spartacus --

  He starts to turn away. Her hand reaches out to stop him, 
    accidentally grazing the wound on his side. He winces in 
  pain.

                                          MIRA(cont'd)
                        Your wound...

                        A scratch. Varro suffered worse.

                                        MIRA
                        I will help you to your cell.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You are not needed.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    13.

  She turns to go.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Mira.

  She stops, hopeful.

                        The man I saw you with...

  She flushes with shame, launching into explanation.

                                        MIRA
                        I was ordered to tend to his needs. 
                      He means nothing to me.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Such is not my concern. The man was 
                        wounded trying to protect my wife. 
                        Next you lie with him, I would have 
                        you offer my gratitude.

  Spartacus then turns and heads for his cell. Mira watches 
  him go, longing for a spark of jealously or desire from the 
  champion. As Spartacus closes the cell door shut, SMASH CUT 
  TO --



  Doctore CRACKS his whip, shouting to the men as they train.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    17.

  Crixus fumes as he works the palus with his sword. He shoots 
  a venomous look over to --

  SPARTACUS

  who spars with Agron. Spartacus' condition has worsened. 
  Sweat drips off him. Breaths come in ragged gasps.

                                        AGRON
                      My brother... meant nothing by his 
                        remarks.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      He spoke his mind. Thoughts... 
                        shared by many.

  Spartacus steps back, winded, half doubled over to catch his 
  breath.

                                        AGRON
                        You wish to rest?

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  hardening)(
                      If I do, I shall tell you.

  Spartacus attacks. Agron is forced back, but Spartacus 
  quickly tires. Agron counters, his wooden sword accidentally 
  landing a blow against Spartacus' wounded side. Spartacus 
  staggers back, agony shocking through him.

                                        DEAD VARRO (O.S.)
                        Did I hurt you...

  Startled, Spartacus looks up and sees Dead Varro standing in 
  Agron's place, practice sword in hand.

                                        DEAD VARRO
                        ... Champion?

  Spartacus blinks the sweat from his eyes. Now it is Agron 
  facing him. With a FERAL GROWL, Spartacus attacks with a 
  wild frenzy. Each time their swords clash,

  DEAD VARRO BRIEFLY FLASHES INTO EXISTENCE,

  taking Agron's place. Spartacus and Agron smash together, 
  locking swords. As Spartacus draws close, Agron is replaced 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    18.
  CONTINUED:

  by Dead Varro. Spartacus stares into his dead friend's eyes, 
  devastated by the sight. Dead Varro smiles mirthlessly, 
  blood leaking from his mouth.

                                        DEAD VARRO(cont'd)

                        Spartacus!

  Spartacus glances over to Doctore, joined by Crixus.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Does he intend to fight, or kiss 
                        the man?

  The other men laugh. Spartacus turns back to find Dead Varro 
  gone. Agron stands in his place, concern constricting his 
  face as he looks down at Spartacus' wound.

                                        AGRON
                        Spartacus...

  Spartacus gazes down. BLACK BLOOD streaked with PUS streams 
  down his leg from the wound in his side. He shoves Agron 
  back and starts to walk away, favoring his side. He only 
  makes it a few steps before his eyes unfocus and his legs 
  give out. As he hits the ground, SMASH TO --



  TIGHT ON A SMALL PURSE OF COINS being dropped into a hand. 
  POP WIDE to reveal SOLONIUS half in the shadows, paying 
  Ashur his weekly bribe. Ashur's hood is pulled up to conceal 
  his face from prying eyes.

  Solonius smiles, hoping for the worst.

                        What plagues good Batiatus to such 
                        distraction?

                        Confide, and lift your burden.

  Ashur hesitates, gives in to the temptation.

                                        ASHUR
                      He has grown reckless. His thirst 
                        for power and vengeance clouds 
                        judgement.

                        How so?

  Ashur realizes he has said too much already.

                        meeting with you this night. I must 
                      to the apothecary, before I am 
                        overdue.

  Ashur starts off. Solonius takes his arm, halting him.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        One day, very soon, the House of 
                        Batiatus will come crashing down. 
                      Do not find yourself buried in the 
                        rubble.

  Solonius disappears into the night. OFF ASHUR, the warning 
  striking a deep cord... 


  OMITTED



  The CROWD roars as a HOPLOMACHUS collapses to the sand, 
  SCREAMING, blood gushing from his helmet.

  AGRON

  slams his sword through the Hoplomachus' back, his blade 
  coming out through the man's chest in a spray of blood. 
  Agron rips his own damaged helmet off, spotting

  DURO

  on his knees, a PROVOCATOR close to finishing him off as he 
  SLAMS his sword against Duro's shield.

                                        AGRON
                        Duro!

  He realizes he'll never reach him in time. In one fluid 
  movement, he grabs the dead Hoplomachus' spear and hurls it 
  with all his might.

  THE SPEAR

  slices through the air and SLAMS into the Provocator's 
  helmet in an explosion of blood and brains. He goes down, 
  twitches, lays still. The crowd roars.

  DURO

  wrenches off his helmet and rises, looking toward his 
  brother. Gratitude -- and shame -- well in his eyes. 

  PULVINUS

  Batiatus, Lucretia, NUMERIUS, DOMITIA and several other 
    distinguished CAPUANS clap excitedly. The POMPEII MAGISTRATE 
  and his ENTOURAGE look on, faces dour. Batiatus gloats.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    25.

                        find itself in Pompeii's shadow.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Perhaps Crixus shall bring light to 
                        the matter.

  Lucretia dabs at the sweat building on her brow, motions for 
  Naevia to bring her wine.

                                          POMPEII MAGISTRATE
                        Crixus, yes. The crowd will be 
                        amazed... that the Gaul is still 
                        alive.

                                          DOMITIA
                        Batiatus assures us he has 
                        recovered from his injuries.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        That he survived at all is 
                        impressive. No gladiator from 
                        Pompeii ever lived against 
                        Theokoles.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  laughs)(
                        Young Numerius cuts to the truth.

  He indicates the seat of prominence, standing empty.

                        Does good Calavius intend to grace 
                      us with his presence? The day grows 
                        short.

  Domitia shifts uncomfortably, forcing a smile.

                      on his return.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I am certain he will turn up 
                        presently.

  OFF Batiatus' double-edged smile...



  The sands are absent gladiators. The crowd BOOS and throws 
  garbage at the lack of action.



  The Pompeii Magistrate huffs at the din of the crowd.

                                          POMPEII MAGISTRATE
                        The crowd threatens riot. We can 
                        await Calavius no longer.

  Domitia tries to hide the concern for her absent husband as 
  she turns to Batiatus.

                                          DOMITIA
                        Good Batiatus. Would you present 
                        the Primus in my husband's place?

                                        BATIATUS
                      If you think it proper...

                                          DOMITIA
                        Please.

  Batiatus catches Lucretia's eye, a twinkle sparkling in his 
  own. He rises, holds up his hands for silence. The CHANTING 
  dies down.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Capua! In honor of Magistrate 
                        Calavius, who is absent attending 
                        vital business on your behalf, I 
                        present the Primus against Pompeii!

  The CROWD roars in excitement. The Capuans begin chanting 
  Spartacus' name. Batiatus shifts nervously, puts on his best 
  smile.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Yes! Yes, we all desire to see 
                        Spartacus, the Bringer of Rain, 
                        take the sands in victory! But 
                        sadly this day shall not see him 
                        with sword in hand!

  The crowd reacts with shock, BABBLING CONFUSION.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Yet there is cause to rejoice! This 
                      is a glorious moment, much 
                        anticipated! For it marks the 
                        return to the arena of Capua's 
                        favored son... Crixus! Murmillo!

  A wave of dismay washes across the crowd, erupting in BOOS 
  THAT CARRY US INTO...                                                                                    30.



  Crixus takes the sand. He's greeted with a rousing chorus of 
  BOOS.

  PULVINUS

  The Pompeii Magistrate chuckles.

                                          POMPEII MAGISTRATE
                      It appears Capua does not care for 
                        your selection.

  Lucretia forces a smile, looking somewhat ill. Batiatus 
  glares at the remark, returns to the crowd.

                                        BATIATUS
                      He faces a most vile opponent, 
                        belched from the bowels of Pompeii. 
                        I give you Pericles! Thraex!

  ARENA

  PERICLES enters. A huge, chiseled GREEK (or Numidian god, 
  depending on casting). He raises his sword in honor to the 
  Pompeii Magistrate.

  PULVINUS

  The Pompeii Magistrate waves to Pericles, delighted.

                                          POMPEII MAGISTRATE
                        I pray the match will be overly 
                        brief!

                        I would see his fat smirk removed. 
                        Give the command.

  Batiatus gives the signal to Crixus and Pericles.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Begin!

  ARENA

  Crixus attacks, driving Pericles back. The Crowd cheers and 
  groans, depending on which side they're rooting for. Crixus 
  assaults Pericles like a man possessed, landing devastating 
  blows.

  PERICLES COUNTERS,

  redirecting the assault back on Crixus. Crixus goes on the 
  defensive. Pericles swings around and slams his shield into 
  Crixus' helmet. BLOOD FLIES from Crixus' face plate.

  CRIXUS STAGGERS BACK

  ss Pericles presses his attack. His sword slices through 
  Crixus' manica (forearm guard), the SPLASH OF BLOOD WIPING 
  US TO --



  A CLASH OF STEEL as Pericles and Crixus trade thunderous 
  blows. TIME SLOWS as Pericles lands a devastating blow. 
  Crixus slams to the ground, his helmet dislodging from the 
  impact. Pericles struts for the Crowd, milking the moment.

  PULVINUS

  The Pompeii Magistrate laughs at the display.

                        Crixus has the heart of a lion. 
                        Look! He yet rises --

  Lucretia herself rises from her chair, only to stagger, her 
  legs betraying her.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Lucretia!

  He eases her back into her chair, calls to Naevia.

                        slaughtered.

  Batiatus throws him a toxic glance. He takes the water from 
  Naevia, holds it to Lucretia's lips.

                                          DOMITIA
                        Slowly.

  Lucretia swallows, gaining her bearing.

                        Apologies. The heat...

                      No argument. I will join you 
                        afterwards.

  He gives her a pointed look. Lucretia nods, reluctantly 
  giving in.

                        Naevia.

  Naevia helps Lucretia up, throwing a desperate glance at her 
  love battling for his life down in the arena as she exits.

  ARENA

  Crixus is getting hammered. Pericles again sends him to the 
  ground. The crowd boos, throwing garbage. Crixus gets 
  pelted. His eyes narrow, the crowd's mockery igniting him. 
  He spits blood, rises to lock eyes with Pericles with a look 
  that says: "Is that all you got?" 

  PERICLES

  nods at the challenge, charges. They slam into each other, 
  titans clashing in a fight for the ages. Crixus spins and 
  deflects, counters and attacks. Pericles is forced on the 
  defensive as he's hammered back.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.
  CONTINUED:

  THE CROWD ROARS,

  sensing the shift in momentum. The Capuan fans begin 
  CHANTING Crixus name. He gains strength from it, a grim 
  smile forming.

  TIME SLOWS

  as Crixus executes a full 180 degree spin, his blade slicing 
  Pericles' stomach open in a CASCADE OF BLOOD. 

  PERICLES

  drops hard to his knees, VISCERA SPILLING from the yawning 
  wound and SLAPPING THE SAND. He looks up at Crixus for a 
  stunned beat before collapsing to the sand. Crixus raises 
  his boot and brings it down hard,

  CRUSHING PERICLES' HELMET

  in an explosion of GORE AND BRAINS. The Crowd goes insane. 
  Crixus thrusts his arms up in victory, beaming -- but his 
  smile fades as he looks up to...

  THE PULVINUS

  ...and discovers Naevia is absent. Batiatus steps into the 
  FRAME, roaring his approval at Crixus' victory.

  Batiatus laughs. The Pompeii Magistrate scowls, rising.

  Batiatus is interrupted by a MESSENGER, escorted by a GUARD.

  The Pompeii entourage chuckles. Batiatus tenses at what he

  Batiatus throws an accusatory glance at the Pompeii 
  Magistrate, who bristles at the implication.

  The Pompeii Magistrate bows, exits with his entourage.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I shall gather my men to aid in the 
                        search. Numerius, your presence is 
                        welcome.

                                          DOMITIA
                        No. I would have him safely at my 
                        side.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        Mother.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I will never let him from my sight, 
                        Domitia. You have my oath on it.

  Domitia hesitates, gives in with a nod.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Come, Numerius. Let us to your 
                        father.

  OFF BATIATUS, his eyes barely masking the sinister intent of 
  his words...



  A CITY SEARCH PARTY (not Batiatus) passes by with torches. 
  Ashur disengages from the shadows, maneuvering down the 
  street to where Solonius awaits.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        You send message, yet I wait as a 
                        common slave.

                                        ASHUR
                        Apologies. It was difficult to move 
                        without notice.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        The alarm is up across the city. 
                        Speak quickly. I join the search 
                        for good Calavius. He has gone 
                        missing.

                                        ASHUR
                        I am aware of his absence. The very 
                        matter I wish to broach.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    37.
  CONTINUED:

  Ashur presses something into Solonius' hand. He examines it, 
  stunned to find the BLOODY SIGNET RING OF CALAVIUS.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Calavius' ring!

                                        ASHUR
                        Softly!

  Solonius pulls Ashur into the shadows, lowering his voice.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        How did you come by this?

                                        ASHUR
                        Through means pressing upon your 
                        desires. Batiatus holds him 
                        captive, with intent of murder.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Madness, even for Batiatus.

                                        ASHUR
                        Magistrate Calavius insults him, 
                        obstructs his ambitions. I have 
                        never seen Batiatus so unhinged. I 
                        would sever bonds, least I find 
                        myself upon the cross beside him.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Calavius. He yet lives?

                                        ASHUR
                        For the briefest of moments.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Where is he held?

  Ashur hesitates.

                                          SOLONIUS(cont'd)
                        You speak of severing bonds, yet 
                        remain firmly tethered!

                                        ASHUR
                        I hold no love for old loyalties, 
                        yet Calavius has seen my face! I 
                        must flee this city, and would have 
                        proper means to do so.

  Solonius tears off his purse and shoves it into Ashur's 
  hands.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Take it. And more, once Batiatus 
                        and his treachery are laid to rest. 
                        Come, we must gather men.

                                        ASHUR
                        Calavius will be dead before you 
                        do. Batiatus already moves towards 
                        his plan. Are you armed?

                                        SOLONIUS
                        A simple dagger --

                                        ASHUR
                        Enough to cut the ropes. Quickly! 
                      Or see opportunity fade!

  Ashur hustles off, fear flashing across his face. Solonius 
  follows with an excited grin, WIPING US TO --



  Spartacus, wearing his ORNATE SNAKE ARMOR, cradles DYING 
  SURA in his arms near the back of the transport wagon 
  (replaying the end of episode 106).

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Please... Do not leave me again...

                                        DYING SURA
                                  a whisper)(
                      It was you... who left...

  The life fades from her eyes. Spartacus sobs, holding her 
  close. A light wind kicks up. Spartacus' heart cracks as he 
  realizes he's no longer holding Sura in his arms, only her 
  DEATH SHROUD. It slips from his fingers, the wind taking it. 
  ADJUST TO FIND Dead Varro standing behind Spartacus.

                                        DEAD VARRO
                        You must tend to the wound.

  Spartacus looks up as Batiatus passes him (dressed as he was 
  at the end of 106). Batiatus steps up onto the wagon wheel 
  to consult with the DRIVER. Spartacus rises to follow. 
  Batiatus steps away, revealing a BLOOD-SPLATTERED AULUS 
  clutching his wounded side.

                                        AULUS
                        Attacked... on the road...

  Spartacus is suddenly roughly shoved by DEAD VARRO, now 
  dressed as Hector the guard, propelling us to --



  Batiatus, Numerius and a knot of Batiatus' ARMED GUARDS 
  (including Hector) move through the streets.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        There is no sign of him. My father 
                        could be held anywhere.

                                        BATIATUS
                      He is a man much esteemed, and 
                        easily recognized.

  Batiatus artfully pauses across from the gated entrance to 
  the cisterns. An ancient corbel arch of crumbling stone, 
  flanked by two iron TORCH SCONCES, flagstone steps leading 
  down into darkness.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        How could he be moved through the 
                        streets without notice?

                                        NUMERIUS
                                (frustrated, near 
                                  tears)
                        I do not know.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Think. There must be a way...

  Numerius' eyes fall on the entrance to the cisterns.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        The cisterns! They run beneath the 
                        city and beyond!

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    43.

                                to his men)(
                        Torches! Wrest the gate open!

  The Guards hustle to comply. Batiatus clasps Numerius' 
  shoulder in reassurance.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You will soon be with your father, 
                        Numerius. You have my word.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        Your part in this shall not be 
                        forgotten.

  Numerius pushes his fears aside as he heads down into the 
  cisterns.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  softly, to himself)(
                        No, it shall not.

  Batiatus and his Guards follow Numerius down into the bowels 
  of the city, WIPING US TO --



  Aulus' body is SLAMMED into the bed of a CART (the same one 
  Sura arrived on in Ep. 106). PULL WIDE to REVEAL several 
  GUARDS stepping away, done with taking out the trash. ANGLE 
  ON --

  THE BALCONY

  Where Batiatus and Ashur bear witness to Aulus' final exit.

                                        ASHUR
                        The wound did not appear fatal.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The damage was deeper than the eye 
                        could perceive. Medicus tells he 
                        drowned in his own blood.

                                        ASHUR
                        A loose end. No longer needing to 
                      be tied.

  Batiatus grins at that, his mood bright.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You have played your part well, 
                        Ashur.

                                        ASHUR
                      It was a greater hand than mine 
                        that conceived it.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Solonius was easily deceived by 
                        your offer to betray me. As I knew 
                      he would be.

                                        ASHUR
                      He never suspected my loyalty 
                        always lay with you, Dominus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A man who has no honor cannot 
                        imagine such a trait in others. But 
                        you, you possess the quality above 
                        all others. And shall be rewarded 
                      in kind.

                                        ASHUR
                        Your will, Dominus.

  Ashur smiles, in his element. Something draws Batiatus' 
  attention down in the square.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The gods truly favor the House of 
                        Batiatus! Behold! Spartacus has 
                        risen from the dead!

  Ashur follows his gaze down to --

  THE TRAINING SQUARE

  Spartacus, looking pale but much better, has taken to the 
  sand. Crixus and the other men are already training. 
  Spartacus arms himself with practice swords, pausing as 
  Batiatus calls to him.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Spartacus! The heart stirs to see 
                        you among the living! You are well?

  TIGHT PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS as he REPLIES:

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Yes, Dominus. I am myself again.
