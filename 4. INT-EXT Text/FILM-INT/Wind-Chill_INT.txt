A GIRL'S FACE
fills the screen, twenty-one years old, pensive, pretty.
Camera lingers on her in CLOSE UP, noticing details: hair
worn stylishly messy, no makeup, double-pierced ears (though
no earrings today), the corner of her bottom lip a little
frayed where she's been chewing it ruminatively.
She's the kind of beauty who can withstand such bad lighting:
institutional lighting, florescents HUMMING overhead, joining
the chorus of ambient noises: a COUGH, papers RUSTLING, the
SCRIBBLE of a pen, someone SHIFTING in their chair, etc. The
shot lingers until it becomes uncomfortable, invasive,
scrutinizing this unhappy girl in an unguarded moment, then -
A new sound breaks her reverie, a muted BUZZING o.s., and her
eyes cut down to -
HER CELLPHONE
skittering sideways across the closed cover of her blue final
exam book, like a bug. She has an INCOMING TEXT MESSAGE.

There's a collective GROAN and the sound of two hundred
panicked asses twisting in their seats.
Our girl feels her phone buzz, looks down to see a final text
message from her friend:

A slow smile lights up her face at the idea, as all around
her students rise and begin stampeding out.

She gathers her things, begins to make her way down the
stairs when -
GIRL
Hey!
- she's JOSTLED from behind by a CLASSMATE bolting past her.
She hands in her exam book, waves to her friend, and exits.

He darkens, mutters under his breath:

heads off in search of the ladies bathroom.
Meanwhile, our guy saunters up toward the front of the

exit. But when she grips the doorknob she finds it LOCKED.
She frowns. Rattles the doorknob a few times.
A look of panic crosses her face, and she starts rattling the
doorknob harder. Did someone lock her in?
Suddenly the doorknob comes off in her hand.
She pounds on the door with the heel of her palm, shouts:
GIRL
HEY. HEY, I'M LOCKED IN HERE!
Nothing.
She turns, scanning the filthy bathroom, notices something.

A VENT above the sink, near the ceiling.

HEY. CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME?! HEY!
Her voice ECHOES weirdly. When the echoes die down she hears

condensate. It's too dark to see much beyond the car's hood.
She reaches shaking fingers toward the steering column.
Flicks on the headlights.
A STRANGER is walking away down the middle of the dark road.
She screams, reaches instinctively to check the power locks.
The stranger, a black man dressed in a dirty suit, walks with
hunched shoulders. Snow swirling around him in the darkness.
Who the hell takes a stroll in the middle of a snowstorm?
Over her initial shock now, she reaches for the door handle.

He looks over as the door wrenches open and she climbs in.
She pulls the door shut behind her, then huddles against it.
Eyeing him warily.
He starts to reach toward her and she brandishes the scissors-

Relax.
- and switches off the overhead interior lights, explaining:
GUY (cont'd)
We need to conserve the battery.
With the interior light off the car fills with an otherwordly
blue glow reflected off the snow. She pulls her knees up as
if trying to make herself as small as she can, to position
herself as far away from him as is humanly possible on a
bench seat.
Her eyes cut to the DASHBOARD CLOCK.
She frowns.
GIRL
That's not right. The clock...
GUY

Huh? No, it's not. It should

He frowns, looking down at his watch.
He holds it to his

Suddenly she notices a trickle of blood coming from his head.
GIRL
Hey.
GUY
What?
GIRL
You're bleeding.
He touches two fingers to the left side of his head. They
come away bloody. As he lifts his watch cap we see the left
side of his head is matted with frozen blood, now beginning
to melt. The collar of his coat is soaked with it.
GUY
It's nothing...
GIRL
It doesn't look like nothing.
GUY
Scalp wounds bleed a lot. Head
wounds in general. That's why, if
you're ever in a bar fight, the
thing to do is pick up a bottle and
smash the other guy across the
bridge of his nose. It'll make his
eyes fill with blood and snot, and
buy you enough time to run away.
GIRL
(softening, amused)
That's really useful, thanks.
A tense silence fills the car. He closes his eyes and leans
his head back, as if trying to catch a few Z's.

- Who bolts from his seat the instant class is dismissed.
- Who turns out to be the one who jostled her on his way out.
- He races across the empty quad, scribbling on the run.
- Tears the improvised notice out of his spiral notebook.
- Slaps it up on the RIDE BOARD just in the nick of time.

Not if things worked out between

He leans over the seatback, begins rummaging in the back.
GUY (cont'd)
Did you see a bag of groceries in

At mention of groceries she temporarily drops the topic of
the gas station. Remembers:
GIRL
No. Oh, shit. I think I might've
left it in the parking lot.
GUY
What?!
GIRL
I'm sorry. It was an accident-

She's still huddled up front, still holding her scissors.
He's in the back seat, scouring the car for anything edible,
scrounging Tic Tacs, stale pretzel nibs, a candy bar, etc.
GUY
I think I remember losing pack of
Big Red down the back seat cushions
last week...
He thrusts his hand between the seat cushions like a scuba
diver feeling for lobster under a coral reef.
DOWN THE BACK SEAT:
His hand fumbles in the dark space below the seat cushions,
among the seatbelts, lost nickels and dimes, lint.
BACK TO SCENE
Suddenly his eyes go wide as something lurking under the
seats seizes his hand and jerks him in hard.
She GASPS.
His face contorts in agony.
Then changes to a smile, as he pulls his hand free, unhurt,
holding a stick of gum.
GUY (cont'd)
Kidding.
She looks at him in mute fury and disbelief. He shrugs,
unwraps a stick of Big Red and pops it into his mouth.
GIRL
Asshole.
Suddenly his hand shoots out and seizes her wrist holding the
scissors. Her eyes go wide in terror and she starts to

With the blade of the open scissors he divides a stale candy

He slips on his woefully inadequate shirts and pants. It's

He hears her sigh, restless.

She looks at him, too embarrassed to ask him to hold her. It

But she's already digging cash out of her purse.

The car interior flooded with red.
Our guy terrified.
GIRL
What's happening!?
GUY
It's him! Hurry! Help me!
She climbs up front to help our guy frantically taping over
the vents. A shadow moves by the WINDSHIELD and she gasps-
As another shadow goes by in a blur past the BACK WINDOW and
he gasps-
The assault coming from everywhere at once now, the cop an
elemental force, like the storm itself. Skittering along the
undercarriage one moment, across the metal roof the next.
Even appearing -- fleetingly, impossibly -- in the snow on
the blocked driver's side window.
All the electronics in the car start going crazy, power locks
opening and closing, the interior light flickering, the
dashboard clock hands spinning wildly, the windshield wipers
sweeping back and forth, etc.
Then stop all at once.
Even the radio SNAPS OFF.
Dead silence for a beat.
Then an odd SCUTTLING SOUND underfoot, something crawling
along the undercarriage of the car.
Our guy sits there frozen with fear, too scared to move, to
even breathe.
Likewise, the girl sits nervously, watching her breath in the
cold. Her eyes happen to wander to the rear view mirror-
A blue-faced DEAD BABY stares back at her from the rear
window ledge.
She SWINGS around, looks back at the window.
But nothing's
there.

She turns back, he looks at her with concern. Unsure of her
own senses, she shakes him off. Exhales slowly.
Beat.
Suddenly the scuttling noises outside EXPLODE into to a full-
blown assault.
There's the shriek of RENDING METAL, the thing outside begins
HAMMERING at the car's hood, doors, etc.
The car gives a violent shudder side-to-side tosses our kids
around like plastic flakes in a snow globe.
The radio snaps back on: the saxophone solo in the Brenda Lee
song, accompanying the violent CLANGS and GROANS of metal
being torn asunder as the thing under the car rips away
muffler, brake lines, wrenches the handles from the doors,
etc.
BRENDA LEE
Rockin' around, the Christmas tree,
Have a happy hol-i-day...
Our guy claps hands over his ears so he can't hear the sound
of the cop's rage as he attacks the car, fury growing and
growing until it's indistinguishable from the HOWLING wind
outside.
The attack ends.
The red police light in the rear window FADES.
Leaving them sitting there in the dark in stunned silence.
GIRL
What happened?
GUY
I think... he's gone. I guess when
he couldn't get in he gave up.
(suddenly grinning)
I told you these `88 Olds were
built like tanks!
He turns around in the front seat to shake a bandaged fist at
the rear window.

waiting-
GUY
He's not! Listen!
They sit in silence, listening, but hear only the wind.
GIRL
But what if he comes back..?
GUY
We just have to stay in the car
until morning. Then we'll be safe.
That can't be more than, like, a
few more hours... Someone's bound
to come along once the sun comes
up... Someone human I mean. Think
you can hold on until then?
GIRL
(shy)
What if, you know. We have to pee?
GUY
We can use the empty water bottles.
From this point on, the back seat
is a co-ed bathroom. Sound like a
plan?
Sounds like a plan.
GUY (cont'd)
Why don't you try to get some

She shakes her head, eyes full of fear.

The interior of the car is eerily QUIET, cocooned in snow.
The kids sit in silence in the front seat, fighting to stay
awake. His face is pale, skull visible beneath the skin.
She stares at the black, snow-covered windshield.
GIRL
I gotta pee...
GUY
Again?!
She climbs over into the back seat and crouches down,
urinating as demurely as possible into an empty bottle.
GUY (cont'd)

I swear, I never met anyone who had

GIRL
No. But it's not something I
usually do until much later in a
relationship...
She catches herself at the last second, but it's too late:
the word "relationship" hangs in the air. Beat.
Finished peeing, she twists the cap on the water bottle.
Sets it on the floor with the other URINE-FILLED BOTTLES.
Noticing ONE BOTTLE that doesn't look like the others.
She climbs over into the front to confront him with the urine
bottle, which is tinged with PINK.
Blood.
GIRL (cont'd)
What the hell is this? Is this
blood?
No answer.
GIRL (cont'd)
How badly were you hurt in the

No big deal. Just your average day

You won't make it to morning. I'm

gas station-
GUY
How far do you think you'd get out
there before running into Mr.
Freeze?
GIRL
I'm not going to just sit here and
watch you die!
They sit there a moment in silence. She digs out her
cellphone and checks for a signal: NO SIGNAL BARS.
GIRL (cont'd)
(to herself)
Damn it! We need a land line ...
A long beat.
Then she's struck by an idea.
She switches on the wipers to clear snow from the windshield.
Wipes at the foggy glass until she's got enough of a peephole
to peek out.
GUY
What are you looking at?
GIRL
Telephone poles. They must have a
junction box or something to test
the lines ... There! See that one?
She indicates a TELEPHONE POLE twenty yards up from them.
There's a SMALL GREY STEEL JUNCTION BOX near the top.
GUY
So?
She turns, leaning over the seatback to rummage among his
junk in the back. She retrieves his old wall TELEPHONE,
examines the jack at end of its cord.

Of course I don't want to! But it's
got rungs. Can't be any harder than
the climbing wall at my gym. Big
fat repair guys do it all the time,

Trying to convince herself.
GUY
But you're forgetting one thing...
GIRL
What?
GUY
He's out there.
They both go quiet.
She sits there with the phone in her lap, brooding on this.
Until something clicks.
GIRL
The song! That old Christmas song
on the radio. It always comes on
just before he shows up...
She switches on the RADIO.
They hear Elvis Presley's 1957 "Blue Christmas" playing.
GIRL (cont'd)
Keep listening. If `Rockin' Around
the Christmas Tree' comes on, yell
like hell.

herself)
Hopefully I'll have enough time to

He watches her prep for her mission out into the bitter cold.
She disconnects the TELEPHONE RECEIVER from it's base, wraps
it in its chord, stows it for safekeeping under her sweater.
She's ready.
GUY

I've been thinking...
GIRL
What about?

Eternal recurrence. Maybe it

They fall silent, both thinking about this.
GUY
Know what I'd do different? Next
time I'd just to walk up to you
after class... and say "Hey."
GIRL
(smiles)
You should. Definitely. Do that.
She uses her sweater cuff to make clean spot on his cheek.
Kisses him tenderly.
The kiss working it's way to his mouth, lingering a beat.
Their lips part.
He catches her arm as she reaches for the power window
switch, holds tight.
GUY
(urgently)
Don't let me die out here-
She looks at him with fierce eyes full of determination.
The
look calms him, at least a little.
She keys the ignition, lowers the passenger side window.
The duct tape rips away as the window glides down, admitting
a mini-avalanche of powdery snow and a frigid blast of cold.
She climbs out.

Teeth chattering, he watches through the windshield as she
begins her long trek across the MOONLIT EXPANSE OF WHITE.
He turns up the VOLUME on the radio, which is now playing a
funereal church-organ instrumental of "Silent Night."

She sits there, out of breath. She glances over quickly at
our guy, gravely pale, slumped unconscious behind the
steering wheel.
She chafes her hands to get the circulation going again.
She turns down the volume on the radio.
GIRL

- I did it - got through - but I
don't know how much she understood -
the operator I mean -
He doesn't respond.
GIRL (cont'd)
- Just have to hope - maybe - they
can trace the line -
When this too gets no response from him she looks over,
frowning. She scoots a little closer across the front seat
toward him.
Which is when WE SEE -
HIS GHOST
standing outside the car, slack-expressioned and staring.
He stands there a beat, then drifts off into the night.

One touch confirms her

She reaches up to switch on the INTERIOR LIGHT, to get a
better look at him.
GIRL (cont'd)
Oh god!
Her reaction is so sudden and violent and overwhelming it
seems for a moment she's going to be sick. She covers her
mouth, muffling a cry of raw-throated terror.
Then shakes him again, harder this time, desperate to wake
him.
GIRL (cont'd)
No! Please! Don't leave me alone!
Tears spill down her cheeks as she fights hysteria. She
shakes him harder. His inert body spills to one side,
slumping against her.
Her grief turns to something else, instinctive and immediate:
revulsion, at the feel of his cold dead weight against her.
She scrambles across the front seat to put as much distance
as she can between herself and the corpse.
Cowers against the passenger door.
The INTERIOR LIGHT flickers out as the battery finally dies.

Inside the cab it's blessedly warm. The dashboard panel, GPS
and CB radio are lit up like a Christmas tree.
While the snowplow driver tests the front tire chains, our

The snowplow driver climbs up behind the wheel, gives her a
sympathetic look. Picks up the C.B. microphone.
