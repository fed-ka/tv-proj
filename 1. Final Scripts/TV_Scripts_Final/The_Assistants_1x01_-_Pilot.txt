                                    COLD OPENING

      EXT. STREET - BRENTWOOD, CA - MORNING

    A BEAT UP  92 FORD FIESTA SPUTTERS DOWN AN UPSCALE SUBURBAN 
      STREET, SQUEAKING TO A STOP BY AN IMPOSING IVY-COVERED WALL AND 
      GATE.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. CAR

      MIKE BEADLE, 23, (A YOUNG PAUL RUDD), CHECKS HIS WATCH, THEN 
      ADJUSTS THE REAR VIEW MIRROR TO LOOK AT HIMSELF.

                                  MIKE

                Who s gonna kick ass?  You.  You are.

      THE REAR VIEW MIRROR COMES OFF IN HIS HAND.  MIKE SIGHS.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      EXT. STREET

      MIKE IS TALKING INTO THE DRIVEWAY GATE INTERCOM.

                                  MIKE

                Hi, yes, hi.  It s Mike?  Beadle?

      HE STEPS BACK, WAITING FOR THE GATE TO OPEN.  FULL OF NERVOUS 
      ENERGY, HE EXHALES AND DOES A FEW BOXING PUNCHES.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      EXT. FRONT YARD

      THE DRIVEWAY GATE SLOWLY SWINGS OPEN.  MIKE HEADS IN TOWARD AN 
      IMPRESSIVE HOUSE, CHECKING OUT THE PERFECTLY MANICURED GROUNDS 
      AND LINE OF EXPENSIVE CARS.  A GARDENER, JOSE FOX, 50, RAKES 
      LEAVES NEARBY.

                                  MIKE

                Hey, I m Mike.      THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        2.

                Jose.

                                  MIKE

                I m starting today as an assistant for 

                Ali Vance.

      JOSE SMILES AS THEY SHAKE HANDS, THEN SAYS, IN SPANISH:

                                  JOSE (SUBTITLE)

                They will eat you alive, blondie.

      A BEAT.

                                  MIKE (SUBTITLE)

                (IN SPANISH) What do you mean?

                                  JOSE

                Oh no.

                                  MIKE

                They ll eat me alive?

                                  JOSE

                It is... an old Mexican expression.  It 

                means they will welcome you... into the 

                belly... of their love.

                                  MIKE

                Jose.

                                  JOSE

                No!  Really!  My grandmother always said 

                this to me when I was a boy.   Come to 

                me, Joselito.  Let me eat you alive. 

      JOSE SMILES HOPEFULLY.  LIDDY GRIBBLE, 34, (THINK KRISTEN WIIG) 
      FRIENDLY IF A BIT MANIC AND SOCIALLY AWKWARD, IS AT THE DOOR.    THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        3.


                                  LIDDY

                  (CALLING) Mike!  Hi!  Welcome!

                                  JOSE

                (TO MIKE, SOTTO) Be cool.

      MIKE CROSSES TO LIDDY, SUDDENLY A LITTLE UNEASY.

                                  LIDDY

                My sister and her husband are so excited 

                to meet you!  Come on in!

      AS MIKE FOLLOWS LIDDY IN, HE LOOKS BACK AT JOSE, WHO GIVES 
      HIM A SAD LITTLE WAVE GOODBYE.  THE DOOR CLOSES ON MIKE --

                                                                              CUT TO:

                                  MIKE

                Thanks again for this opportunity. 

                                  LIDDY

                Well, when I got your resume with the 

                Short Pump, PA address it just whoosh! 

                brought me back to when Ali and I lived 

                there.  Before Daddy uprooted us all to 

                chase Ali s dreams of stardom ha ha!

                                  MIKE

                I ve seen every movie your sister s been 

                in.  It s such an honor to be working for 

                her. (QUICKLY) And you.  Both of you.

                                  LIDDY

                No, I know Ali s the star.  People say, 

                oh you have to live in your sister's 

                shadow.  I say, no, I'm living in her 

                shade.  And it's very pleasant, thank 

                you!

      SHE LAUGHS.  MAYBE A LITTLE TOO MUCH.  

                                                                            RESET TO:

                                  LIDDY

                You really know your stuff.

                                  MIKE

                Well, back home Ali s like a hero -- but 

                I don t have to tell you that.

                                  LIDDY

                (BIG SMILE) No you do not!

                                  MIKE

                So when I got the job I boned up on all 

                things Ali.  Her movies, charity work.  

                Likes: 2004 Calera Pinot Noir, Obama; 

                  dislikes: paparazzi, wind-up cymbal

                                  LIDDY

                Wow. (THEN) We re not all gonna end up 

                buried in the desert are we? 

      THEY LAUGH, BUT LIDDY TRAILS OFF AND MIKE FEELS OBLIGED TO SAY:

                                  MIKE

                No.

                                  LIDDY

                Oh good.  Phew! (THEN) So, as I told you 

                in the interview, while ultimately you 

                work for Ali, your official title is 

                  Assistant to the House Manager.  AKA, my 

                slave!  Not really.

                                  LIDDY (CONT'D)

                I did have to work hard to convince Ali 

                and her husband Gale that I should have 

                my own assistant.  So I need you to make 

                me look good!  Don t screw up! 

      SHE LAUGHS, SO MIKE LAUGHS.

                                  LIDDY (CONT D)

                ...But yeah don t. 

      MIKE STOPS LAUGHING.

                And I think someone slipped me something. 

                  (REMEMBERS) Oh, no, wait, I slipped me 

                  something. (THEN) So where were you? 

                                  SCOTT

                up coffee beans from that spa Ali and Gale

                based coffee is no longer fit for rich 

                human consumption.  Which means one of us 

                has to drive down there to pick up fresh 

                beans every single week.

                Yep. (THEN) Or, I could pick up a three 

                month supply, store it in our freezer 

                and then we can just pretend to go on 

                weekly four hour coffee runs when in 

                reality we re using that time to plan 

                our bosses  deaths by lava, or bees.

                Problem is, I was supposed to drop these 

                beans off last night, but I stopped at 

                our place to take a leak, I closed my 

                eyes for like one second and then it was

      BEANS, STANDS BACK, CONSIDERING, THEN PULLS THE DOOR NEXT TO 
      THE TABLE OPEN, HIDING THE BAGS.  SATISFIED, HE TURNS -- AND 
      THERE S MIKE.

                                  SCOTT

                  (STARTLED) Gah!  Who are you?

                                  MIKE

                I m Mike.  The new assistant.

      SCOTT GRIMACES, THEN NERVOUSLY GLANCES UP THE STAIRS.

                                  SCOTT

                You have to be cool.  Can you be cool?

      MIKE TRIES TO AFFECT A CASUAL POSE.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)

                (SIGHS) I m screwed...

      HE HEARS LIDDY RETURNING AND HURRIES TO THE BACK DOOR, MOUTHS 
       BE COOL  TO MIKE AND EXITS JUST AS LIDDY ENTERS.

                                  LIDDY

                (OFF MIKE S POSE) Everything alright?

                  Everything is all cool.

                                  LIDDY

                Then where is it?!

                                  SCOTT

                I don t -- Are you messing with me?!

      DJ ENTERS WITH THE DOGS.

                Huh.  I was here when he dropped  em off.

      MIKE REACTS, WHAT?  AS LIDDY SEARCHES, DJ NUDGES SCOTT RE MIKE: 
      WHO S THIS?  SCOTT SHAKES HIM OFF: NOT NOW.  THEY DO THIS RIGHT 
      IN FRONT OF MIKE.  ACROSS THE ROOM, LIDDY FINDS THE BEANS.

                                  LIDDY

                That is probably exactly what happened! 

                (THEN) Lemme take the heat for this, 

                Lid.  I feel like it s my fault.

                                  LIDDY

                No, Scott, don t beat yourself up.

                I m beating myself up!

                                  LIDDY

                No, just don t say anything.  I know my 

                sister.  Brew some coffee now and by 

                this afternoon she ll have forgotten.

                                  DJ

                I know you re my boss, Liddy, but I m 

                gonna say it -- you re a bad ass.

      LIDDY LIKES BEING CONSIDERED PART OF THE GANG.

                At first I didn t want to take the plane 

                ticket.  Then I remembered my brother s 

                an orthopaedic surgeon and I have to 

                steal soup from my bosses.  Break break!

                you could maybe call that guy for me 

                today about lining up investors?

                                  ALI

                You'd think right now you'd be focused 

                on the 10th anniversary of AliCares.  

                But I guess after five years of marriage 

                you want to start doing your own thing.

                                  DJ

                (TO SCOTT, SOTTO) Dude --!

      SCOTT HOLDS UP A FINGER TO HIM, THEN:

                                  SCOTT

                Okay, G, you re set for  lift  off. 

                  (CHUCKLES, THEN) Just a reminder: I ll be 

                in San Fran tonight  til tomorrow at two.

                                  GALE

                (LOOKS UP)  Did I sign off on that?

                                  SCOTT

                Oh.  Yeah, remember?  You said  San 

                  Francisco?  What, you marching in a 

                parade?   Which -- I m not gay -- but 

                yeah, it was funny.  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        38.


                                  GALE

                  I remember the joke, it was strong.  I 

                don t recall giving the ok on the vay-

                kay.  You can t just bail on me here.  

                Despite what people say, I got my own 

                stuff going on. (INDICATES T-SHIRT)  I 

                got business.  I m not just... eye candy!  

      SCOTT STANDS THERE A BEAT, THEN:

                                  SCOTT

                It s fine.  I ll stay.  No problem.  

                                  GALE

                Thanks, buddy.  You re the best. (THEN) 

                Damn, it s too sunny out now.  I think 

                I ll just lift inside.

      SCOTT JUST NODS, OF FUCKING COURSE.

                                                                        CUT BACK TO:

                                  ALI

                I know you must think this (FINGER GUN) 

                is just a little thing.  

      MIKE TRIES TO LISTEN TO ALI BUT IS DISTRACTED: BEHIND ALI, 
      PHILO IS TRYING TO MAKE HIS FINGERS INTO A GUN.  

                                  ALI (CONT D)

                Do you know what Philo means?

                                  MIKE

                Uh, love?

                                  ALI

                Love, Mike!

                                  ALI

                You knew but still do this? (FINGER GUN)

                                  MIKE

                We probably shouldn t keep doing that.

      TOO LATE.  BEHIND ALI, PHILO S FIGURED OUT THE FINGER GUN.

                                  PHILO

                  (CALLING) Mommy!

                                  MIKE

                (TO HIMSELF) Oh no...

                                  ALI

                  (TURNING) Yes my love?

                                  PHILO

                (FINGER SHOOTS HER) Pew pew!

      ALI AND LIDDY GASP.  MIKE RUSHES OVER TO PHILO.

                                  MIKE

                Let s go back to drawing! (HANDS HIM 

                MARKER) Can you draw Mommy a peace sign?

                                  PHILO

                (SHOOTS ALI WITH MARKER) Pew pew!

                                  MIKE

                (GRABS MARKER) No -- (HANDS HIM CARROT 

                STICK) Here, eat your snack!

                                  PHILO

                (SHOOTS ALI WITH CARROT) Pew p--

      MIKE GRABS THE CARROT AND SHOVES IT IN HIS MOUTH.  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        40.


                                  MIKE

                (TO HIMSELF) Everything s a gun!

      ALI STORMS OUT.  LIDDY FOLLOWS, ISSUING ORDERS AS SHE GOES:

                                  LIDDY

                (TO TINA) Take Philo for a walk or 

                  something. (TO MIKE) And you... Go to 

                the dry cleaners and then I d say we can 

                call it a first day, don t you think?

      SHELL-SHOCKED, MIKE TURNS AND HURRIES OUT.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      EXT. FRONT YARD/PATIO

      MIKE RUNS OUT, PASSING JOSE, WHO GIVES HIM A LITTLE WAVE 
      GOODBYE.  ON THE PATIO, SCOTT AND DJ WATCH AS MIKE FLEES, 
      LOOKING BACK NERVOUSLY, STUMBLING, AS HE GOES.

                                  SCOTT

                I needed that.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. CAR

      MIKE TAKES A BREATH -- WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED? -- THEN 
      STICKS HIS REARVIEW MIRROR BACK UP, JUST IN TIME TO SEE TINA 
      AND PHILO EXITING THE FRONT GATE -- AND THEN PHILO TRYING TO 
      PULL AWAY TOWARD MIKE S CAR, HAPPILY FINGER SHOOTING.  

                                  MIKE

                  (MISERABLE) Trust me, I wish you had 

                bullets in that finger.

      MIKE SPEEDS AWAY AS FAST AS HIS OLD CAR WILL TAKE HIM.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        41.

                                  DJ

                Admit it, Lid, you picked a loose cannon!  

                Makes me question your judgment. (THEN) 

                Ali, I love your sister.  As a sister.  

                But as a house manager...?

      GALE SHRUGS SADLY, THEN GLANCES AT LIDDY, RELISHING THIS. 

                                  LIDDY

                Remember back in Short Pump, Ali-bun?

                Yeah.  You came home and cried and

                                  ALI

                I broke that mirror in the kitchen.

                                  LIDDY

                                  LIDDY

                Your drama teacher called.  Lifted you up 

                when you were just starting out, when you 

                needed it most.  Ali, you can be that 

                someone for Mike.  He needs his Mr. 

                  Topley-Griggs.

                lately is thinking about yourself!  

                First with Gale Force and now with your 

                little competition with my sister.

                Gotcha!  Oh, you should see your face! 

                  (IMITATES HIS SICK LOOK) Ali's fine.  

                Liddy worked her magic.  But it'd be 

                good -- for both of us -- if you got a 

                win with her today, okay?  I mean, don't

                house.  In fact, let s have it in the 

                  backyard. (TO OTHERS) Listen up.  I m 

                gonna need all of you to work late for a 

                thing I m doing for Ali.

      TINA TURNS AND MOUTHS  MINI GOLF?  TO SCOTT.  HE SHRUGS.  

                                  TINA

                  Actually, Gale, we have plans tonight.

                                  GALE

                Oh I wish you had told me earlier.  Then

                Thanks buddy.  You re aces. (TO MIKE) 

                Looks like you dodged a bullet this 

                morning. (CHUCKLES) Dodged a bullet.

      HE FINGER SHOOTS MIKE AND EXITS.  TINA LOOKS AT SCOTT.

                                  TINA

                Why do you put up with that?

                                  SCOTT

                Because no one will buy my photography 

                yet and I m a dirty whore for money!

                                  DJ

                We ll go go-karting some other time.

      SCOTT NODS AND THEY START OUT ON THEIR DAYS. 

                                  TINA

                  (QUIETLY) No.

                                  SCOTT

                What?

                                  TINA

                (WITH GROWING PASSION) No.  We re going 

                  go-karting.  Today.  You have to have 

                time that s yours!  That s not his!  Or 

                hers!  It s your birthday, Scott!  And on 

                your birthday you go-kart!

                                  DJ

                Tina --  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        48.


                                  TINA

                No!  This is me snapping!  Damnit! 

                                  DJ

                Still nice.

                                  TINA

                Philo has Mommy Time with Ali for 

                another 57 minutes. (TO DJ) Which means 

                we re both okay  til then. (TO SCOTT) 

                And Gale will think you re off getting 

                ready for tonight.  We re doing this.  

                Right now.  We have to do it fast, but 

                we have to do it.  So let s go!

      SCOTT TURNS TO DJ TO HELP TALK HER OUT OF THIS.  

                                  DJ

                Let s go, dude.

      SCOTT NODS TOWARD MIKE, WHO S TRYING TO STAY OUT OF IT.

                                  SCOTT

                How we gonna keep Ali and Gale from 

                finding out with Mikey-leaks over there?

                                  TINA

                New Guy won t say anything.  

                                  DJ

                He s gonna be too busy trying to get a 

                 win  with Ali.

      SCOTT DELIBERATES A BEAT, THEN:

                                  SCOTT

                  Gentlemen, start your engines! (RAISES 

                ARMS IN VICTORY, THEN) I am still sore!  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        49.


      THEY EXIT, HURRIEDLY BUT HAPPILY.  MIKE MAKES A CALL.

                                  MIKE

                Yes, I was wondering if you had a 2004 

                Calera Pinot Noir?...  Great!  How much 

                is it? (YIKES) How much is the 2005?...  

                2006?...  No -- it s fine.  I ll be by.  

      HE HANGS UP AND EXHALES: EXPENSIVE, BUT WORTH IT.  HE NODS, 
      FEELING A LITTLE BETTER.  HE LOOKS AROUND, FAMILIARIZING 
      HIMSELF A LITTLE, CHECKING OUT THE SECURITY MONITOR, OPENING 
      A CUPBOARD OR TWO.  HE COMES TO A DOOR OFF THE KITCHEN. 

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. WINE CELLAR

      MIKE FLIPS ON A LIGHT, REVEALING A MASSIVE WINE CELLAR.  
      FLOOR TO CEILING BOTTLES.  LIKE THE END OF  RAIDERS,  BUT 
      WITH WINE.  MIKE JUST STANDS THERE, FEELING VERY SMALL, THE 
      GOOD FEELINGS OVER HIS  WIN  ALREADY EVAPORATING.

                                  GALE (O.S.)

                Scott!

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. GREAT ROOM

      GALE IS AT THE BACK DOOR AS MIKE HURRIEDLY RETURNS.

                                  GALE

                Scott!  Strap on your man pants and get 

                those weights back outside!  I gotta get 

                me some color for tonight!

                                  MIKE

                Uh... he s not here.

                                  GALE

                What do you mean?  Where is he?

      MIKE TAKES A MOMENT, CONSIDERING WHAT TO SAY, THEN:  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        50.


                                  MIKE

                He s... in the bathroom.  So he s here, 

                just not right here, here.  But I ll 

                start moving the weights and he can join 

                me when he s... finished.

      MIKE HESITATES, WONDERING WHAT HE S GETTING INTO.

                                  GALE

                Well, get moving, Sissy Spacek!

      MIKE HURRIES OUT, PASSING ALI, WHO ENTERS, FOLLOWED BY PHILO.

                                  ALI

                Philo, I know this is our special time 

                but Mommy has to get ready for an extra 

                special night tonight.

      ALI TRIES TO LOOK THROUGH DRESSES BACK FROM THE CLEANERS.

                                  PHILO

                I m booored!

                                  ALI

                If you calm down for Mommy, Nanny Tina 

                will take you to the zoo today!  

      PHILO PULLS THE DRESSES DOWN.

                                  ALI (CONT D)

                No, honey -- zoo!  Today!  And tomorrow!  

                Zoo!! (CALLING) Tina!  I need to stop 

                Mommy and Me a little early!  Tina!

      MIKE HURRIES IN WITH WAY TOO MANY WEIGHTS, BARELY UPRIGHT.

                                  MIKE

                  Bathroom!  In the bathroom!  But I ll 

                play with him until she gets back!  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        51.


                                  PHILO

                (TWO FINGER GUNS) Pew pew!  Pew pew!

      MIKE JOLTS AND DROPS THE WEIGHTS ON HIS FEET -- 

                                  MIKE

                Son of a BITCH!!

      ALI GASPS AND COVERS PHILO S EARS.

                                  ALI

                Now you curse at my boy?!  Liddy!

                                  MIKE

                (IN PAIN) Sorry so sorry!

      GALE RUNS IN AND SEES THE WEIGHTS ON THE FLOOR.

                                  GALE

                What did you do to my weights?!

                                  MIKE

                They re okay - my feet broke their fall!

      LIDDY HURRIES IN.

                                  ALI

                Where s Tina?  Where s DJ?  

                                  GALE

                Where s Scott?

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        52.


      EXT. FRONT YARD - A LITTLE LATER

      SCOTT PEEKS IN THE GATE, WATCHING THE SECURITY CAMERA.  IT 
      PANS AWAY, HE GIVES THE SIGNAL AND THEY ALL DASH IN.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. GREAT ROOM

      THEY ENTER BUT STOP SHORT -- ALI, GALE AND LIDDY ARE STANDING 
      THERE, WAITING.  MIKE IS BEHIND THEM.  

                                  LIDDY

                Mike told us everything.

      THE ASSISTANTS CAN ONLY STAND THERE, SCREWED, BUT THEN --  

                                  ALI

                  (BURSTING) Thank you so much!

      AND SHE HUGS THEM!  THEY STAND THERE, FROZEN SMILES ON THEIR 
      FACES, NOT KNOWING WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING.

                                  MIKE

                They realized you guys were all out and 

                were wondering where the heck you were.

                                  GALE

                I called you a little jack-hole, Scott, 

                and for that I apologize.

                                  MIKE

                I tried to cover for you, but they 

                forced me to tell  em the truth.  That 

                you were out trying to find a gift for 

                the AliCares anniversary.

      THE ASSISTANTS TRY TO HIDE THEIR SURPRISE AND RELIEF.

      Oh, you told?You stinker.  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        53.


                                  ALI

                And I said a gift was so not necessary!  

                That you baked me a cake is gift enough!

      MIKE HOLDS UP SCOTT'S CAKE, WHICH READS  CONGRATS ON 10 YEARS 
      OF ALICARES!   THEY LOOK AT HIM WITH AWE AND APPRECIATION. 

                                  GALE

                And isn t it your birthday, Scott?

                                    DJ/TINA

                Is it?/Oh, Happy Birthday!

                                  ALI

                You deserve a big slice of my cake!

      A HAPPY MOMENT.  SMILES, LAUGHS... WHICH FADE, THEN: 

                                  ALI (CONT D)

                DJ, I need Ming to come over and walk on 

                my back.  This day s been so stressful.

                                  GALE

                Scott, (RE: MIKE) Petunia Party-Dress 

                here started moving my weights back 

                outside but I think he chipped a nail 

                so I need you to help him.

      ALI, GALE AND LIDDY START OUT.  BACK TO WORK.  AS SCOTT AND 
      DJ FOLLOW, THEY PASS MIKE AND WHISPER WITH APPRECIATION:

                                  SCOTT

                (SOTTO) We eat the caramels.

                                  DJ

                (SOTTO) The dogs don t mind if you take 

                a little nap on walkees.

      THEY EXIT, LEAVING MIKE WITH TINA.   THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        54.


                                  TINA

                Wow, where did that come from?

                                  MIKE

                I think I got my win.

      TINA SMILES, THEN REALIZES MIKE IS OUT OF SORTS.

                                  TINA

                What?

                                  MIKE

                This job, this is my only connection to 

                what I want to do, to where I want to 

                go.  But now I find out it s working for 

                a petty, insecure lunatic -- the hero of 

                my hometown! -- who actually looks good 

                compared to her steroidal psycho of a 

                husband who I also get to work for.

                                  TINA

                (SADLY SINGS) Hoo-ray for Hollywood...  

                (THEN) Yeah, you re working for 

                  psychopaths.  But you re working with us.

      SHE GIVES HIM A CUTE LITTLE FINGER SHOT.  A NICE MOMENT 
      BETWEEN THEM, THEN MIKE GRIMACES.

                                  TINA (CONT D)

                Now what?

                                  MIKE

                I m pretty sure I broke my feet.

      AS MIKE HOBBLES WITH HER OUT THE DOOR.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:  THE ASSISTANTS  "Pilot"   1/28/11                        55.


      INT. GREAT ROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT

      SCOTT AND DJ ARE HEADING OUT FOR THE NIGHT.

                                  DJ

                C mon, you said it -- this is your year!

                                  SCOTT

                So, what, I just knock on her door and be 

                like  Hey, super-tall Persian chick, it s 

                your Facebook stalker, come on up for a 

                drink to celebrate my birthday.   

                                  DJ

                Yes!  Her status still says  It s 

                  Complicated  right?

                                  SCOTT

                As of eighteen minutes ago.

      MIKE ENTERS.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)

                Hey, we ll see you over at our place?  

                All the beer you can drink.  

                                  DJ

                Oh, on your way over, you should stop 

                and pick up all the beer you can drink.

                                  MIKE

                  Actually, I got this wine today. (HANDS

      DJ THROWS A CARAMEL TO MIKE.  MIKE CATCHES THIS ONE.  SCOTT 
      AND DJ EXIT.  TINA CROSSES THROUGH.

                                  MIKE

                So I m going over to Scott and DJ s.

                                  TINA

                Cool, me too.

                                  MIKE

                Oh, good, me too. (SIGHS)

                                  TINA

                I ll see you there, New Guy.

      TINA EXITS.  MIKE WATCHES HER GO, A BIT MOONILY, THEN UNWRAPS 
      THE CARAMEL AND POPS IT IN HIS MOUTH.  HE STANDS THERE A 
      BEAT, ENJOYING IT.  

      UNBEKNOWNST TO HIM, ON THE SECURITY MONITOR BEHIND HIM WE SEE 
      TINA AND DJ ON THE STREET.  THEY GLANCE UP AT THE CAMERA AND, 
      THINKING THEY'RE OUT OF VIEW, SNEAK A QUICK KISS.  

      HAPPILY UNAWARE, MIKE PICKS UP HIS BAG AND EXITS.

                                        END OF SHOW
