      FADE IN:

      EXT. GOTHAM CITY - DUSK (D/1)

      We re ten stories above the street, perched on the edge of an 
      old office building.  A stone GARGOYLE gazes blindly at a 
      majestic mountain range of Gothic stone spires and sleek 
      glass towers under a darkening blue sky, bathed in the golden 
      light of the setting sun.  SELINA KYLE (14) - an elfin girl 
      dressed in street Goth style, the future CATWOMAN - appears 
      alongside the gargoyle and scans the streets below, a hunter 
      searching for prey. Without any hesitation, she launches 
      herself from the edge of the roof onto a fire escape one 
      floor below and - using drainpipes, window ledges, and light 
      fixtures - descends to street level with amazing nerve and 
      agility.   

      EXT. THEATER DISTRICT STREET. GOTHAM

      Imagine New York City s Times Square in the 1970s and then 
      turn the dial to eleven - squalid but sexy, dangerous but 
      glamorous. 

      Colorful GOTHAMITES and gawking TOURISTS watch TWO GANG 
      MEMBERS brawling violently in the middle of the road.      
      One gangster wears crude HOME MADE BODY ARMOR and wields a 
      machete, the other wears a garish ZOOT SUIT and is armed with 
      a hammer. 

      Nobody notices Selina slide from a store awning onto the 
      sidewalk. An out of town CONVENTIONEER (male, 30 s) is 
      watching the brawl. Selina brushes past him, and a split 
      second later he clutches at his pockets and spins round...  

                                    CONVENTIONEER
                    Hey! 

      Selina runs, wallet in hand, pursued by the Conventioneer.

      EXT. STREETS OF THEATER DISTRICT. GOTHAM - DUSK

      Selina leads the Conventioneer on a pell mell tour of the 
      glamorous, brutal, and intensely vivid city. Plunging canyons 
      and soaring spires; neon signs and HD screens selling sex 
      violence and money on streets teeming with raucous humanity. 
      It s colorful and loud, grotesque and beautiful. 

      (NB - Amid the visual clamor we see a giant billboard 
      announcing the Wayne Foundation s redevelopment of the Arkham 
      district, and the boards of a newspaper stand screaming 
       CRIME WAVE OF THE CENTURY! )          

      Selina grabs an apple and a carton of milk from a storefront, 
      and darts down an alley.  The Conventioneer runs right past.                                                                                        2.

      EXT. ALLEYWAY. GOTHAM THEATER DISTRICT - NIGHT (N/1)

      MOMENTS LATER.  Relaxing, Selina crouches behind a dumpster 
      halfway down the alley. She pours some of the milk into a 
      makeshift saucer, to share with the BIG CALICO ALLEY-CAT that 
      soon joins her. They exchange meowling greetings. Selina 
      munches on the apple, and examines the wallet she stole.  
      Pocketing the cash and credit cards, she slots the wallet 
      through the grating of an old air vent in the wall.  

      Hearing voices and laughter, Selina and the Cat climb swiftly 
      up from the street into hiding in the shadows of a first-
      story fire escape. 

      THOMAS, MARTHA, and BRUCE WAYNE walk down the alley. 

      The family is well-dressed in an old fashioned way. They re 
      laughing at something Thomas has just said.

                                  MARTHA
                    Oh come on, Tom, it wasn t that bad.

                                  THOMAS
                    Childish drivel.  Movies these 
                    days, I don t know.  

                                  MARTHA
                    Well I thought the acting was fine, 
                    and the music was lovely.  How 
                    about you, Bruce?  

                                  BRUCE
                    Sorry, Mom, I agree with Dad.  
                    It was kinda lame.

      Thomas smiles and ruffles his son s hair.

                                  THOMAS
                    There s no such word as kinda. 

                                  MARTHA
                          (lightly)
                    You two, so judgmental.  Just once 
                    I d like --

      She stops because a BIG TALL MASKED MAN with A GUN appears in 
      front of them.

                                  MASKED MAN
                    What s up, folks.  Gimme your money. 

      Thomas and Martha remain very calm.  Bruce is terrified.

                                  THOMAS
                    No problem.  

      Thomas hands the Masked Man his wallet.                                                                                        3.

                                  MASKED MAN
                    The necklace.

                                  MARTHA
                    Oh but --

                                  THOMAS
                    -- Give it to him, Martha.

      Martha unclasps the necklace and gives it to the Masked Man.  

      Then, without warning, the Masked Man SHOOTS Thomas and Martha 
      in the chest, one after the other.  They fall down. 

      The Masked Man looks at Bruce long and hard.  Bruce meets his 
      gaze.  The Masked Man puts the gun to the boy s forehead, and 
      considers shooting him, but then lowers the gun and walks 
      calmly away. 

      Frozen in horror, Bruce watches his mother and father trying 
      to speak, gasping for their last breaths in a spreading pool 
      of blood.  

                                  BRUCE
                    Mom?  Dad?

      ANGLE - ON A FIFTH STOREY FIRE ESCAPE, Selina Kyle, her 
      expression inscrutable, watches Bruce Wayne fall to his knees 
      and let out an UNEARTHLY WAIL...

      EXT. LOW RENT RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

      CU ON JAMES GORDON (26, tough but open and sincere; an old 
      school air of decency and honor and quiet authority).       
      He s walking down the middle of the street, hands raised in 
      placation. He wears a nice simple suit and tie, and holds up 
      a SILVER DETECTIVE S BADGE.  

      He approaches a HUGE ANGRY BIKER, holding a butcher s knife 
      to the throat of a terrified YOUNG WOMAN. A lover s quarrel 
      gone very wrong.  

                                  GORDON
                    Sir, I m Detective James Gordon, 
                    Gotham PD. Can we talk?  

      The Biker looks at Gordon wild-eyed, high. Gordon keeps 
      moving slowly but steadily toward the Man and his hostage. 

      ANGLE -- half a block away, HARVEY BULLOCK (40s, big, stylish 
      but slovenly, an old school hard ass and a loose living party 
      animal) runs huffing and puffing to the scene, gun drawn. 

      Gordon is close now.

                                  ANGRY BIKER
                    I ll kill her, I swear!                                                                                       4.

                                  GORDON
                    I can see you re very angry and I 
                    respect that.  But please listen to 
                    me.  Violence is not the answer -- 

      The Biker points the knife at Gordon, who grabs and twists it 
      from the Biker s grip, and elbows him in the face. They 
      exchange a flurry of vicious blows before Gordon puts the 
      Biker down on his hands and knees.  As Gordon takes out his 
      cuffs, Bullock comes running up and kicks the Biker as he 
      starts trying to get up, knocking him down again. Gordon 
      cuffs the prone man while Bullock puts his hands on his 
      knees, catching his breath.

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    Are you okay, ma am?

      The woman nods, speechless.

      INT. GCPD HQ - NIGHT

      A vast Escheresque cavern, teeming with life. STYLISH 
      HOODLUMS, RAUCOUS TEENAGE GANGSTERS, GARISH HOOKERS, and 
      RAVING LUNATICS are pushed and prodded and wrestled through 
      the system by a beleaguered cohort of COPS. Gordon and 
      Bullock take the Biker to the booking desk SARGEANT...

                                    BULLOCK
                    Next time soldier, don t mess 
                    around. Just drill the sonofabitch. 

                                  GORDON
                    I thought about that. But I figured 
                    I could avoid bloodshed.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Dumb rookie mistake. He could have 
                    killed you. You re a homicide 
                      detective, not a goddamn hero.

                                  GORDON
                    I don t think that--

                                    BULLOCK
                    --You been on the job two weeks. 
                    You don t get to think yet.  Yo, 
                    Sarge, process this creep wouldya. 
                    A and B, resisting.

                                  SARGEANT
                    Oh hey Bullock, good timing. You re 
                    up. Double homicide in the Theater 
                    District.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Gimme a break. Shift s nearly over.                                                                                      5.

                                  SARGEANT
                    Yeah, nearly.  You re up. 

      Bullock curses under his breath. Gordon is good to go...

      EXT. THEATER DISTRICT ALLEYWAY. GOTHAM - CONTINUOUS

      A GCPD HOMICIDE SQUAD CAR pulls to the curb, Gordon and 
      Bullock inside.  GORDON S POV - The alley is taped off, and 
      bathed in the eerie glow of temporary lights set up by the 
      first responders. FOUR GCPD OFFICERS hold back a small crowd 
      of ONLOOKERS.  The two detectives get out of the car and head 
      down the alley, ducking under the tape.  

      Bullock nods to SERGEANT TANNENBAUM, (40 s, male, shlumpy) 
      standing guard over the bodies of the Waynes.  Sheets have 
      been placed over them.  The cop s tone is casual but 
      professional.  Gordon is galvanised and alert. Familiar with 
      war, murder scenes are not shocking but horribly fascinating.    

                                  TANNENBAUM
                    The legendary Harvey Bullock. No 
                    rest for the wicked eh? 

                                    BULLOCK
                      Tannenbaum, looking crisp. 
                    This is my new partner, James  
                    Gordon. What we got?

      Tannenbaum and Gordon exchange nods.

                                  TANNENBAUM
                    Just got here myself. Male and a 
                    female, gunshot wounds. Their kid 
                    saw the whole thing. Poor little 
                    bastard hasn t spoke a word yet.

      The Sergeant points out Bruce Wayne, sitting on a doorstep, 
      wrapped in a police department blanket, his face a mask of 
      tragedy.  A POLICEWOMAN stands near, feeling helpless.  
      Bruce and Gordon s eyes meet for a second and Gordon feels 
      his fathomless pain. As if drawn by a magnet, he goes to the 
      boy, sits down alongside. They sit in silence.

      Bullock goes to the bodies, lifts the sheet to look at the 
      faces.  He immediately recognizes the Waynes, and curses 
      under his breath.  He puts the sheet back over the bodies, 
      and takes Tannenbaum aside for a quiet word. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Listen T, you didn t see me, okay? 

                                  TANNENBAUM
                    I see you right in front of me.  
                    What s your problem?  Who are they?                                                                                       6.

                                    BULLOCK
                    That s Thomas and Martha Wayne.

                                  TANNENBAUM 
                          (alarmed)
                    Oh hell. For real?

                                    BULLOCK
                    Yeah. I don t need that kind of 
                    hassle. Call Major Crimes.  They d 
                    love to have this.

                                  TANNENBAUM
                    But they re not here. You are here, 
                    and your partner s talking to the 
                    witness.  That makes it your case. 

      Bullock sighs, knowing Tannenbaum is right, and won t budge. 

      ON GORDON AND BRUCE. Still silent. Finally...

                                  GORDON
                    My name s James Gordon. I m a 
                      detective.  What s your name?
                          (no reply)
                    It s okay. You don t have to talk. 

      After a beat...

                                  BRUCE
                    Bruce. My name s Bruce Wayne.

                                  GORDON
                    Bruce. That s a good strong name. 
                    Can you tell me what happened? 

      Bruce can t speak. When he tries, he starts to cry instead.

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    When I was a little younger than 
                    you a drunk driver ran into our 
                    car. Killed my dad. I was right 
                    next to him. 
                          (he has Bruce s attention)
                    I wasn t hurt badly, but it took a 
                    while to get me out of the wreck. 
                      A policeman held my hand. He knew 
                    how frightened I was and he told 
                    me, he promised me, however dark 
                    and scary the world might be at 
                    this moment, there will be light. 
                    And he was right. There will be 
                    light, Bruce. There will.  

      Bruce looks in Gordon s eyes, and sees strength and empathy.                                                                                      7.

                                  BRUCE
                    We, we just got out of the movies. 
                    We were walking through the alley 
                    to catch an uptown cab, and a man 
                    came out of the shadows.  He was 
                    tall and big, with a black mask and 
                    a hat and gloves and he had a gun. 
                      A revolver.  His shoes were shiny. 
                    He said give me your money and he 
                    took my dad s wallet and my mom s 
                    necklace, and then he shot them. 
                    For no reason.  And then he pointed 
                    the gun at me, but he didn t shoot. 
                    He walked away.
                          (beat)
                    I could have grabbed the gun.  But 
                    I didn t. I didn t do anything.    

                                  GORDON
                    You did the right thing. You re 
                    alive.  

                                  BRUCE
                    No.  I should have done something. 
                    I was too scared.

                                  GORDON
                    There was nothing you could do to 
                    stop what happened.  But there is 
                    something you can do now.  Now you 
                    can be strong.  Grief can make you 
                    strong.  Be strong and one day 
                    maybe you can stop this from 
                    happening to somebody else.  

      Bruce nods.  Gordon has no idea how deep his words sink in.    

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    I promise you, Bruce, I ll do 
                    whatever it takes to find the man 
                    who did this.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. THEATER DISTRICT AVENUE - NIGHT (N/1 CONT D)

      A late night crowd of glam Party-goers and Street People 
      watch Gordon and ALFRED PENNYWORTH, (40 s, cockney, ex-
      Marine. Very dry, very snide) escorts Bruce Wayne to a BIG 
      BLACK LIMO, idling at the curb.  Pennyworth helps the kid 
      into the backseat and closes the door.  

                                  GORDON
                    We ll be in touch soon.  We re 
                    going to catch this guy Mr. 
                      Pennyworth.

                                  ALFRED
                    Call me Alfred.  New boy are you?  

                                  GORDON
                    You could say.

      Alfred studies him sceptically.

                                  ALFRED
                    Good luck mate.

      Alfred gets behind the wheel of the Limo. Bruce and Gordon 
      exchange a last look through the window as the car pulls 
      away.  Bullock walks past Gordon with grumpy body language...

                                  BULLOCK
                    Forensics have got the scene. Let s 
                    go get coffee.

    He heads for a DINER down the block. Gordon follows 
      reluctantly.

      INT. DINER - NIGHT

      Bullock and Gordon enter the near empty diner. The WAITRESS 
      sees Bullock coming and has a cup of coffee poured by the 
      time he and Gordon sit at the counter.   

      Simmering, Bullock drinks coffee and Maalox and a flask of 
      whiskey alternately.  

                                  GORDON
                    Shouldn t we be there when they 
                    move the victims? 

                                  BULLOCK
                    Why? Listen to me hot-shot, in  
                    future, don t start talking to 
                    witnesses until I say so.                                                                                       9.

                                  GORDON
                    But I thought --

                                    BULLOCK
                    -- There you go again. You think 
                    you re a real detective already, 
                    but you re not. You got a badge, 
                    that s all.  And you just caught us 
                      a gigantic flaming ball of crap.   

                                  GORDON
                    How so?

                                    BULLOCK
                    You never heard of Thomas and 
                    Martha Wayne?  

                                  GORDON
                    Sure. The Wayne Foundation.

                                    BULLOCK
                    They re two of the richest, most 
                    powerful people in Gotham. Wayne 
                      Industries runs half the city. 
                    They own the whole Arkham 
                      development zone. They re 
                      kingmakers at City Hall. These 
                    murders are going to turn the city 
                    upside down. You can t even begin 
                    to imagine the pressure if we don t 
                    close this case quick.  

                                  GORDON
                    So let s close it quick.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Yeah right. This is a random street 
                    robbery Holmes. Perp could be 
                    anyone of ten thousand mopes.

      Gordon is a little surprised by Bullock s defeatism. He has a 
      soldier s way of getting to the bottom line.

                                  GORDON
                    So it s a tough case, but we took 
                    the call. It s our case.  

                                    BULLOCK
                    It is now.  Ah crap.

      This last in reaction to RENEE MONTOYA (30s, latina, tightly 
      wound) and CRISPUS ALLEN (30s, African-American, suave, calm 
      and cool) entering the diner. 

                                    BULLOCK (CONT D)
                    Up late, girls?                                                                                     10.

                                  ALLEN
                    Hi, Harvey. 

                                    BULLOCK
                          (to Gordon)
                    Montoya and Allen.  Major Crimes 
                    Unit. My new partner, Jim Gordon.

                                  GORDON
                    Good to meet you.  

      Allen nods. Montoya just studies him coldly. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    You re on the Waynes huh. 
                    Terrible thing.  Any leads?

                                    BULLOCK
                    We just got started.

                                    MONTOYA
                    Tough case.

      Awkward beat.

                                  ALLEN
                    I ll be straight.  You want us to 
                    take it off your hands?

      Gordon is shocked...

                                  GORDON
                    What?  No way--

                                    BULLOCK
                    -- Hold on, rook. 
                          (to Allen)
                    Why d you want it?  You got a lead?

                                  ALLEN
                    Naw.  You know we need the press 
                    action.  MCU s new guy on the 
                    block.  We got to get our name out 
                    there.  This case is just the 
                    ticket.

      Gordon wants to speak, but Bullock holds up a finger to 
      shoosh him. He feigns reluctance...

                                    BULLOCK
                    I don t know...

                                    MONTOYA
                    Come on, Bullock. You don t want 
                    this case. Do the right thing. 

      The words touch a nerve in Bullock and he changes his mind.                                                                                     11.

                                    BULLOCK
                    The right thing? The hell you get 
                    the nerve to say that to me?  The 
                    right thing. I do the right thing 
                    every damn day. Kiss my ass. 

                                  ALLEN
                    Don t be that way, brother. We re 
                    trying to be collegial here.  
                    We can help each other out.

      Bullock s anger overrides his better judgment... 

                                    BULLOCK 
                          (to Montoya, mostly)
                    For a moment there, I almost gave 
                    it to you. But you can t help it 
                    uh? You got to be disrespectful. 
                    I ll give this case to Satan before 
                    I give it to you jackasses. 

      Allen raises his hands in amiable surrender.

                                  ALLEN
                    Oh-kay Harvey. Stay cool. 
                    Good luck.

      Montoya gives both men a cold stare as she and Allen exit. 
      Gordon is puzzled by the heavy tension. Off his sidelong 
      glance to Bullock...

      EXT/INT. GCPD HOMICIDE SQUAD CAR IN MOTION - DAY

      Gordon driving, Bullock alongside, still seething.          

                                  GORDON
                    Why all the friction with the Major 
                    Crimes Unit?  We re on the same 
                    side.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Exactly. We re rivals. 
                    And they re a buncha self righteous 
                    do gooding skell huggers. 
                      Badmouthing us all the time, we 
                    bend the law, we re cowboys, blah 
                    blah blah. 

                                  GORDON
                    Why do they say that?

                                    BULLOCK
                    Because they want a piece of our 
                    pie, of course. Like they re such 
                    freaking angels? Please.
                          (yells at another driver)
                    What are you blind!? Move!                                                                                     12.

      Off Gordon, not quite satisfied with that reply.

      INT. CAPTAIN S ESSEN S OFFICE. GCPD HQ - DAY (D/2)

      CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN 

      MAYOR AUBREY JAMES(50 s, charismatic, sincere), is teary-eyed 
      with emotion. 

                                  MAYOR AUBREY JAMES
                    Today we have lost two of Gotham s 
                    finest people. I grieve not just as 
                    Mayor of this great city of ours. 
                    I have lost two close personal 
                    friends. Make no doubt, our Police 
                      Department will catch the punk that 
                    did this. But at moments like this 
                    it can seem like we re losing the 
                    war on crime. My fellow citizens, 
                    we can t and we won t let the 
                    killers and the robbers and the 
                    rapists and the thugs win. Not On 
                    My Watch. I swear to you---

      CAPTAIN SARAH ESSEN(30s, female; sleek, brisk, lawyerly) 
      switches OFF the TV, turns to Bullock and Gordon.

                                    CAPTAIN ESSEN
                    Poor bastard. First a crime wave, 
                    and now this.  At city hall, the  
                    Waynes were like mom and dad, they 
                    kept a fractious family together. 
                    Now they re gone the children are 
                    gonna start squabbling.  It s bad 
                    news for Gotham. Bad news for us. 
                    Everybody in town is going to be on 
                    us like wet paint until we close 
                    this thing. Drop everything else. 
                    Take all the people and resources 
                    you need. Just close. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Yes, boss.
                          (to Gordon)
                    I ll be right with you, Jim.

      Gordon takes the hint, and exits. 

      Gordon s POV from outside the glass walls of the Captain s 
      office: Bullock gestures vehemently, baldly pointing to 
      Gordon and shaking his head. Gordon knows what he s saying... 

      WE GO BACK INSIDE her office...

                                    CAPTAIN ESSEN
                    The answer is no.  Give him a 
                    chance.  It s only been two weeks.                                                                                    13.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Come on, Cap.  Give me anyone, give 
                    me Thumbs Osgood even. This kid  
                    knows nothing. 

                                    CAPTAIN ESSEN
                    That s why they call em rookies. 
                    He was fast tracked for good 
                    reasons. He s smart as hell, his 
                    father was a revered District 
                    Attorney. He s a College football 
                    star, war hero, exemplary beat 
                    cop... 

                                    BULLOCK
                    -- For two years. In the suburbs.  
                    I don t care who his daddy was,    
                    I don t care he s a war hero.
                    I do not need an ignorant fearless 
                    gung ho boy scout in my life. Have 
                    a heart, Cap.

                                    CAPTAIN ESSEN
                          (with a smile)
                    You know I have no heart.  He s a 
                    good man, and he s here to stay.  
                    He just needs to learn from your 
                      experience.  Go do your job please.

      Bullock takes a beat, shrugs, exits...

      INT. BULLPEN. GCPD HQ - CONTINUOUS

      And his eyes meet Gordon s, seated at his desk.  Bullock has 
      the grace to look and feel just a tad guilty.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Okay kid, let s go roust some 
                    muggers.

      As they walk out together...

                                  GORDON
                    She said you got to keep me, huh?

      Bullock looks at the kid sideways. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Yeah.  She did. Do me a favor, you 
                    got juice, ask for a transfer.

                                  GORDON
                    No can do. I promised the kid. 
                    I have to stay on this case.

      Bullock thinks this is greenhorn behavior of the worst kind.                                                                                    14.

                                    BULLOCK
                    You promised... Ooof. No offense, 
                    you re a good guy Jimmy.  But this 
                    is not a job for good guys. This is 
                    not a city for good guys. You 
                      understand?

                                  GORDON
                    Not really. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    There s your problem right there.

                                  GORDON
                    I m sorry you re not happy with me. 
                    But I need this job. I like this 
                    job. I want to learn from the best. 
                    And you re the best detective on 
                    this squad. By reputation anyhow. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    What s that anyhow?

                                  GORDON
                    Oh you re way more lackadaisical 
                    than I expected. You wouldn t last 
                    ten minutes in the military.

      Bullock laughs.

                                    BULLOCK
                      Lackadaisical. That s a good word. 
                    You got stones Jimmy boy, I ll give 
                    you that. 


      EXT/INT. STREETS OF GOTHAM - DAY

      A RAPID MONTAGE: Forty-eight hours pass as Gordon and Bullock 
      work the streets, alleys, and tenements of Gotham in all it s 
      seedy glory.  Walking, running, driving, knocking on doors, 
      questioning A GALLERY OF GOTHAM LOW-LIFE.  Everyone shakes 
      their head. Nope. Nope. Nope.     

      END MONTAGE:

      INT. BULLPEN. HOMICIDE SQUAD. GCPD HQ - DAY 

      EDWARD NYGMA, the resident FORENSICS EXPERT (late 20 s, 
      pleasantly geeky in a white coat, and crossword puzzle tie. 
      Later to become THE RIDDLER. The name tag on his coat say - 
      E. NYGMA) holds a shiny BULLET between his fingers, showing 
      it to Gordon and Bullock, weary frustrated and frowsty.  

                                  NYGMA
                    Guess what this is?                                                                                    15.

                                    BULLOCK
                          (impatiently)
                    Just tell us Ed. I want riddles, 
                    I ll read the funny pages.

                                  NYGMA 
                    45 Caliber three hundred grain 
                      cupronickel wadcutter. Came out of 
                    Thomas Wayne s chest.     

                                  GORDON
                    That s a six dollar bullet. 

                                  NYGMA
                    Yuh huh.  What kind...

      Nygma is about to ask another riddle and struggles with 
      himself to state the facts, as a stutterer might struggle to 
      speak.

                                  NYGMA (CONT D)
                    Wh- It s from a big revolver that 
                    is not in our database. No prints 
                    either.

                                    BULLOCK
                    What else you got?

                                  NYGMA
                    What s nowhere but everywhere 
                    except where something is? 

      Bullock rolls his eyes.

                                  GORDON
                    Nothing?

                                  NYGMA
                    You re quick.

                                    BULLOCK
                    And you re a pain in the ass Nygma.
                          (to Gordon)
                    Let s go.

      Bullock and Gordon head for the street. Nygma looks miffed.

                                  GORDON
                    I m thinking, maybe we do have 
                      something.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Thinking again huh?                                                                                    16.

                                  GORDON
                    Our man wears shiny shoes and uses 
                    high end ammo and nobody on the 
                    street knows who he is. 
                    So maybe he s not from the street. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Oh, like, a debonair playboy 
                    robber?  Does it for kicks?

                                  GORDON
                    Who would pretend to be a street 
                    robber? Either a professional 
                    contract killer or someone with a 
                    personal grudge against the Waynes.   

                                    BULLOCK
                    How did this professional killer 
                    know the Waynes would come down 
                    that alley? 

                                  GORDON
                    Good question.  I don t know.

                                    BULLOCK
                    This is the big city, rook.  Shiny 
                    shoes and fancy bullets don t mean 
                    diddly.

                                  GORDON
                    Where are we going?

                                    BULLOCK
                    Captain Essen told me, we don t get 
                    a break in the first 48, it s time 
                    go see Fish Mooney.

                                  GORDON
                    Fish Mooney? The Gangster?  Works 
                    for Carmine Falcone?

                                    BULLOCK
                    Her. Theater district s her turf.  
                    Anything happens there, she hears 
                    about it. 

      EXT. MOONEY S GOLDEN AGE NITE CLUB - DAY 

      It s raining a little.  The club is a sumptuous high-end 
      joint.  Gordon and Bullock walk up to the front entrance.  

                                  GORDON
                    Why didn t we go to her first?

                                    BULLOCK
                    Eh, she s a last resort. Kinda 
                      rough-edged.                                                                                    17.

      INT. MOONEY S GOLDEN AGE NITE CLUB - DAY

        A restaurant night club with a 1920 s High Society theme. 
      Empty except for a PAIR OF DANCERS sexlessly rehearsing a 
      sexy number on stage.  Gordon and Bullock show their badges 
      to a WAITER, who nods respectfully and glides away... 

      As the Waiter exits through a back door, we hear O.S THE 
      SOUND OF A MAN YELLING IN FEAR AND PAIN.  The SOUND CUTS OFF 
      as the door closes.  Gordon looks to Bullock, who shrugs.

      EXT. BACK COURTYARD. GOLDEN AGE NITE CLUB - DAY

      Stone paving, blank brick walls.  Rain falling through 
      fluorescent light. 

      FISH MOONEY (40 s, scarey, volatile, charismatic) in a slinky 
      evening dress and jewels, wielding a well-used aluminum 
      little league baseball bat; talks gently to a whimpering, 
      badly beaten fat man -- RAOUL -- on his knees in front of 
      her.  

      One of Mooney s entourage, an odd-looking young man named 
      OSWALD COBBLEPOT (26, small, plump, and beaky. He will become 
      famous as The Penguin) holds an umbrella over Mooney to 
      shield her from the rain. He s clearly the lowest rank in 
      this assembly.  Second in command BUTCH GILZEAN (30 s) and 
      two THUGGISH HENCHMEN watch attentively.  All Mooney s 
      henchmen wear similar black suits and white shirts.   

      The Waiter comes out of the club and waits to be noticed.

                                  MOONEY 
                          (to Raoul)
                    Here s the thing, sugar bunny. 
                    I still care for you deeply. 
                    But I feel like you don t care for 
                    me anymore. 

      Raoul mumbles incoherently.

                                  MOONEY (CONT D)
                    I can t hear you.

                                  RAOUL
                    I care fuh fuh for you.

                                  MOONEY
                    Then where s my goddamn money? 

      She smacks Raoul with the bat. Oswald is entranced by the 
      man s pain, and so is late following her with the umbrella. 
      Mooney SMACKS HIM in the back of the head. Oswald conceals a 
      nasty scowl. 

                                  MOONEY (CONT D)
                    Hell-oh?                                                                                     18.

                                  OSWALD
                    Sorry.

                                  MOONEY
                    If my hair goes frizzy, you will 
                    be. What is it, sweety?

      This last, with a smile, to the Waiter...

                                  WAITER
                    Ma am, Detective Bullock s here to 
                    see you.

      Mooney likes Bullock.  She hands the bat to Gilzean.

                                  MOONEY
                    Keep him warm.

      Mooney heads indoors. Oswald covers her with the umbrella to 
      the door, but stays outside. Butch looks at the two bored 
      henchmen and then turns to Oswald...

                                    GILZEAN
                    Oswald, you want a turn? 

                                  OSWALD
                    May I?

      Gilzean tosses the bat to Oswald, who is thrilled.   

                                  OSWALD (CONT D)
                    Thank you Mister Gilzean. 

      Oswald gives Raoul a tentative smack. Smiles slyly.  Does it 
      again, harder.  He likes this.   

      INT. GOLDEN AGE NITE CLUB - DAY  

      Mooney enters glowing, as if she s just finished a game of 
      tennis.  While the door s open, the SOUND of Raoul HOWLING 
      can again be heard.  Bullock pays no mind. Gordon is curious. 

      Mooney and Bullock embrace like old friends. 

                                  MOONEY
                    Harvey, you bad man.  Where have you 
                    been so long?  Who s your friend?

                                  GORDON
                    Detective James Gordon, Ma am.    

                                    BULLOCK
                    New boy.

                                  MOONEY
                    James.  Aren t you a cool glass of 
                    milk.                                                                                     19.

                                  GORDON
                    Ma am, was that screaming we heard 
                    back there?

                                  MOONEY
                    Yes. My boys are watching a scary 
                    movie.

                                  GORDON
                    Really.

                                  MOONEY
                    No, I m messing with you.  One of 
                    my staff has been stealing from me.
                    We re beating his punk ass. 

                                  GORDON 
                          (surprised by her candor)
                    Oh. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Relax junior.  Fish gets some 
                    leeway.  Her staff are rough 
                      characters, need firm handling.

      Gordon frowns, doesn t like the notion of leeway.

                                  MOONEY
                    So this isn t a social visit then.

                                    BULLOCK
                    The brass told me to come talk to 
                    you. About the Wayne murders.   

                                  MOONEY
                    Hmmm. Terrible thing.

                                    BULLOCK
                    We need your help.  We need a name. 

                                  MOONEY
                    I can ask around.

      Gordon is still gazing anxiously at the door. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Tell you what, Jim.  If you re 
                    worried, go on back there and see 
                    if anybody wants to press charges. 
                    That okay with you, Fish?

                                  MOONEY
                    Sure.  Knock yourself out kid.

      Gordon shrugs, okay.  He heads to the back of the club.  
      Bullock and Mooney continue talking, but WE FOLLOW Gordon as 
      he exits through the service door.                                                                                    20.

      Gordon follows the SOUND of a BEATING...

      EXT. COURTYARD. GOLDEN AGE NITE CLUB - CONTINUOUS

      Oswald is delightedly dancing around, cackling, umbrella open 
      in one hand, the little league bat in the other hand, beating 
      Raoul. He s watched by Gilzean and the two Henchmen, very 
      amused.

                                    GILZEAN
                    Atta boy. 

                                  HENCHMAN
                    Go penguin!

      Oswald stops abruptly and glares at the Henchman. 

                                  OSWALD
                    You know I don t like to be called 
                    that.

                                  HENCHMAN
                          (unimpressed)
                    Ooo. Scary.

      Oswald snarls, but pauses guiltily when Gordon appears.

                                  GORDON
                    Hi.  How s everyone doing? 

                                    GILZEAN
                    Who are you?

                                  GORDON
                    Detective James Gordon, GCPD.     

                                    GILZEAN 
                    Oh. Come with Harvey uh? Good to 
                    know ya, James.  I m Butch Gilzean. 

                                  GORDON
                    Drop the bat.

      Oswald drops the bat. 

                                    GILZEAN
                    Oswald and Raoul were just having 
                    fun, right guys? 

      In a heap on the floor, Raoul nods and tries to smile...

                                  OSWALD
                    All in fun.                                                                                    21.

                                  RAOUL
                    Th... thas  righ. No problem.  Fun.   

                                    GILZEAN
                    So, you re a new guy, huh?  How you 
                    liking Gotham?

                                  GORDON
                    Well enough. 

      Stymied, and a little embarassed, Gordon gives Gilzean a hard 
      look and walks back inside. 

      INT. GOLDEN AGE NITE CLUB - CONTINUOUS 

      Gordon returns to the table where Bullock and Mooney are deep 
      in quiet conversation. They stop talking and smile at Gordon 
      as he approaches.

                                    BULLOCK
                    All good?

      Gordon just nods. Bullock stands up to leave.

                                    BULLOCK (CONT D)
                    It was good to see you Fish. Hope 
                    to hear from you soon.

                                  MOONEY
                    You never know.

      They kiss goodbye on the mouth.  

      EXT. HOMICIDE SQUAD CAR (MOVING) - DAY

      Bullock at the wheel, Gordon alongside.

                                  GORDON
                    How much leeway does Mooney get 
                    exactly?

                                    BULLOCK 
                          (testily)
                    How long is a piece of string?

                                  GORDON
                    The law isn t made of string.

                                    BULLOCK
                    You re damn right. The law is us.  

                                  GORDON
                    It s more than us. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    You see anybody else out here?                                                                                     22.

      Off Gordon, troubled.

      INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT (N/2)

      A SPECTACULAR VIEW OF GOTHAM through wall to wall picture 
      windows. A symphony of stone, steel and glass.

      We find Gordon looking out at this view, deep in thought. 

      BARBARA KEAN (late 20 s, sunny, sophisticated) enters from 
      her bedroom looking gorgeous in a cocktail dress, and greets 
      Gordon with a kiss and a radiant smile. She has the gift and 
      burden of luminous grace. All her life, she s been coveted, 
      pursued. For her, Gordon is a protector - honest and strong. 

                                  GORDON
                    Wow.

                                    BARBARA
                    And look at you in your excellent 
                    suit.  I am so happy you don t have 
                    to wear that silly uniform anymore.

                                  GORDON
                    You told me it looked good.

                                    BARBARA
                    I lied, baby.  Drink before we go?  

                                  GORDON
                    Barbara, I m beat.  Do we really 
                    have to go to this thing?

                                    BARBARA
                    No, of course not. What bliss.     
                    You know I looove bailing. 

      She kicks off her heels. Gordon slumps onto a sofa. Barbara 
      looks at him with fond concern. 

      Barbara curls up with him on the sofa.

                                    BARBARA (CONT D)
                    Talk to me.

                                  GORDON
                    We re getting nowhere on the Wayne 
                    case. I made a promise to Bruce 
                    Wayne and I can t deliver on it. 
                    Now I feel like a fraud.

                                    BARBARA
                    But you re not.                                                                                    23.

                                  GORDON
                    I was nine when we left Gotham 
                    after my dad died and I really 
                    didn t want to go. I was a city 
                    boy. But my mom needed to be near 
                    her parents upstate, so you know... 
                    The country was okay. But Gotham, 
                    in my mind, it became this magical 
                    scary mysterious place where my 
                    family was happy and my father did 
                    heroic things. I always knew I d 
                    come back here and work for the 
                    law, like my father did. I know 
                    this is my place.  But now I m 
                    here, I feel like I m playing a 
                    game with rules that everyone knows 
                    but me. I m out of my depth. 

      Familiar with Gordon s hardness on himself, she gives him a 
      consoling kiss.

                                    BARBARA 
                          (blithely)
                    Jim, you are the cleverest, 
                    bravest, goodest man in Gotham. 
                    I very much doubt you are out of 
                    your depth. Even if you are, you 
                    know how to swim don t you? 

                                  GORDON 
                          (smiles)
                    Yes I do.

                                    BARBARA
                    So alright then. You don t have to 
                    rid the city of crime on your own 
                    all at once today. You can swim 
                    around a little first and get your 
                    bearings. And I bet you catch 
                    someone for the Wayne murders soon. 
                    I can feel it.
                    Are you hungry?

      Gordon nods, cheering up. Barbara could make a stone smile.

      INT. KITCHEN. BARBARA S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Barbara cooks an Italian dinner and James helps. 

                                    BARBARA
                    Pass the radicchio, would you?

                                  GORDON
                    The who?

      Barbara gets it herself.                                                                                    24.

                                    BARBARA
                    When I m Mrs. Gordon I m going to 
                    teach you how to cook.

                                  GORDON
                    I know how to cook. 

                                    BARBARA
                    Applying heat to things until 
                    they re soft is not cooking.

                                  GORDON
                    That s most of it. You figured we 
                    would live here? 

                                    BARBARA
                    Why not? It s free. Dad-- My father 
                      practically said it s mine, really.  

                                  GORDON
                    Yeah, but it s his. I figured we d 
                    live somewhere we can afford on the 
                    wages of a cop and an ER doctor.

                                    BARBARA
                    But that ll be somewhere pokey and 
                    sad, won t it? Why not stay here 
                    where it s nice?  Isn t it nice 
                    here?

                                  GORDON
                    Yes it is...

                                    BARBARA
                    Well then...

      They kiss, and after a while, start to undress each other.  
      The food on the stove is left to cook away unattended. 

      INT. BARBARA S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

      Chinese food on the coffee table.  Gordon and Barbara 
      entwined asleep on the sofa. Gordon s PHONE BUZZES.  He 
      wakes, finds the phone. 

      INTERCUT WITH:

      INT. SLEAZY BAR. GOTHAM - NIGHT

      A dark underground dive. In a booth, flanked by HOOKERS and a 
      DRUG DEALER, Bullock is on his mobile phone. 

                                    BULLOCK 
                    Got a lead.  Meet me at Fourth and 
                    Grundy.                                                                                     25.

                                  GORDON
                    On my way.

      Bullock drains a glass of whiskey, slams it down.

      Gordon tiptoes out, leaving Barbara sleeping peacefully. 

      EXT. FOURTH AND GRUNDY. GOTHAM - NIGHT (N/2 CONT D)

      A street of tenement apartments. Gordon waits on the deserted 
      street corner. Bullock drives up, parks and gets out of his 
      car. A little unsteady. 

                                  GORDON
                    You okay?

                                    BULLOCK
                    Coupla drinks. I ll be fine.

                                  GORDON
                    Bullock, come on. If you re drunk 
                    you can t--

                                    BULLOCK
                    --Hey. You don t tell me what I can 
                    or can t do. We clear on that?   

                                  GORDON
                    Clear.

      Beat.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Fish Mooney heard from one of her 
                    fences -- a guy was trying to sell 
                    him an antique four strand pearl 
                    necklace with gold settings.   

                                  GORDON
                    Like Martha Wayne was wearing.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Name of the guy is Mario Pepper... 

      INT. TENEMENT STAIRWELL - NIGHT

      Gordon and Bullock climb the decrepit dimly lit stairs, and 
      take up positions on either side of an apartment door. 

                                    BULLOCK (V.O.)
                    ...Career street thug.  Long sheet 
                    for robbery, assault, rape, drug 
                    dealing, extortion.

      Gordon KNOCKS firmly.  No reply.  KNOCKS again.                                                                                     26.

      The door cracks open, and a little girl -- IVY -- (10, red 
      headed, feral, skinny) appears.  A chain bolt holds the door.

                                  GORDON
                    Hi.  What s your name?

                                  IVY
                    Ivy.

                                  GORDON
                    Ivy, is there a grown-up home that 
                    we can talk to?

                                  IVY
                    Momma s asleep.

                                  GORDON
                    Just Momma?  Is Daddy home?

                                  IVY
                    Yeah.  But you don t want to talk 
                    to Daddy.

                                  GORDON
                    Why s that, Ivy?

                                  IVY 
                          (whispers)
                    He s mean.

      Just then, thumping FOOTSTEPS... Ivy scampers away and the 
      door is off the chain and opened wide, revealing MARIO PEPPER 
      as advertised, big and scarey.  He knows cops instantly. 

                                  GORDON
                    Mister Pepper?  We need to talk.

                                  MARIO PEPPER
                    I ve done nothing. 

                                  GORDON
                    Then it ll be a pleasant 
                      conversation.  

      INT. PEPPER S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      The spartan front room is brightened by an array of thriving 
      POTTED PLANTS of various colorful kinds.

      At a plain table, Pepper sits next to his wife ALICE, (30 s, 
      haggard).  She s jittery, and she has a black eye.  Gordon 
      and Bullock sit opposite.

                                  GORDON
                    Mario, where were you last Saturday 
                    night at around nine-thirty?                                                                                     27.

                                  MARIO PEPPER
                    I was here at home with my family.

                                  ALICE PEPPER
                    Th-that s that s right.  He was here. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Why are you so nervous, Alice?

                                  ALICE PEPPER
                    Because you re hassling us in the 
                    middle of the night. 

                                  MARIO PEPPER
                    What s this about?

                                    BULLOCK
                    It s about a pearl necklace.  Four 
                    strands.  Gold fittings.  Does that 
                    sound familiar?

                                  MARIO PEPPER
                    No. 

                                    BULLOCK 
                    So you won t mind if we take a look 
                    around the place?

      Both Peppers look worried at that. 

                                  MARIO PEPPER
                    You need a warrant.

                                  GORDON
                    You re a felon on parole.  We just 
                    need reasonable cause.

                                  MARIO PEPPER
                    You got no reasonable cause.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Sure we do.

                                  MARIO PEPPER
                    I m just trying to do the right 
                    thing. I m just trying to feed my 
                    family. Why are you picking on me?

      With that, Pepper throws the table over on top of the two 
      detectives and dashes from the room.  Alice flings herself 
      flailing and screaming at Gordon and Bullock, delaying them 
      as they scramble up. Gordon extricates himself first and 
      follows Pepper.

      BACK BEDROOM -- Gordon enters as Pepper disappears up the 
      fire escape.  Gordon follows.                                                                                    28.

      FRONT ROOM -- Bullock has to use violence to subdue and cuff 
      Alice.  Then Ivy comes charging in and attacks him with a 
      KITCHEN KNIFE.  

      EXT. FIRE ESCAPE AND ROOFTOP - NIGHT

      Gordon chases Pepper across the iconic rooftops of Gotham.

      The big man is an athlete, and LEAPS with ease across a 
      YAWNING GAP between the buildings.  Gordon follows with less 
      ease and more bravery. 

      Gordon has his gun out, gets a clear line of sight on Pepper...

                                  GORDON
                    Stop or I ll shoot!

      But Pepper doesn t stop and Gordon doesn t shoot him. 
      He wants him alive. 

      BULLOCK comes up via the STAIRWELL onto the rooftops.  

      There s no way he can make the jump made by Pepper and 
      Gordon.  They get further ahead while he searches for another 
      way across the gap.

      Scrambling to stop himself from falling off a steeply pitched 
      roof, GORDON LOSES HIS GUN, and continues the chase unarmed.

      MEANWHILE -- Bullock lays the ladder across the gap and walks 
      carefully across. 

      Gordon loses sight of Pepper and comes to a wide gap that 
      Pepper could not possibly have jumped.  Just as he realizes 
      that Pepper must therefore be behind him,  Pepper comes 
      charging out of the shadows, intending to push Gordon off the 
      rooftop.  Gordon dodges just in time. The two men grapple on 
      the edge of a sheer drop.  The advantage swings back and 
      forth.  

      Bullock arrives on the scene to find Gordon hanging from a 
      parapet with Pepper clinging desperately to his legs. In a 
      few seconds, both men will fall to certain deaths.      

      Bullock saves Gordon s life by shooting Pepper.  Pepper lets 
      go of Gordon and falls a hundred feet to his death SCREAMING 
      all the way. Free of Pepper s weight, Gordon scrambles to 
      safety.

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    29.

                                        ACT TWO

      EXT. GOTHAM CITY - DAY (D/3)

      SUNRISE over the majestic city of Gotham. 

      EXT. FOURTH AND GRUNDY - DAY 

    The street is swarming with COPS and FORENSICS TECHS.  

    On the sidewalk, a MEDIC treats a nasty GASH on Gordon s arm. 
      Bullock is close by, talking quietly to a uniformed POLICE 
      CAPTAIN.  There s an air of tension.

      INT. PEPPER S APARTMENT - DAY

      VARIOUS SHOTS -- A careful search by a team of SPECIALIST 
      COPS in gloves and protective clothing. 

    IN THE BEDROOM -- a SPECTACLED COP pulls a gym bag from under 
    the bed.  Opens it to find a jiffy bag of white powder.  
      Holding it up for a better look, the Cop sees there s 
      something else in the bag.  He opens the bag and pulls out    
      Martha Wayne s FOUR STRAND PEARL NECKLACE.  

                                  SPECTACLED COP
                    Yo, Sarge! 

      EXT. FOURTH AND GRUNDY - DAY  

    The Spectacled Cop emerges from the tenement block.  Holds up 
    an evidence bag with the pearl necklace inside.

                                  SPECTACLED COP
                    We got him!

      Bullock and Gordon exchange a look of profound relief.  They 
      laugh.  Real partners for the first time.  

      INT. BULLPEN. HOMICIDE SQUAD. GCPD HQ - DAY

      Gordon and Bullock enter to CHEERS and an irreverent standing 
      ovation from their colleagues. Gordon can t help smiling.

      INT. CAPTAIN ESSEN S OFFICE. GCPD HQ - DAY

      Essen smiles broadly at Gordon and Bullock...

                                  ESSEN
                    Well done guys. We needed this one.

                                  GORDON
                    I wish we could have taken him alive.                                                                                     30.

                                  ESSEN
                    Stuff happens.  But when you speak 
                    to the media, that s a great angle 
                    to play.  You wish you could have 
                    taken him alive.  

      EXT/INT. GOTHAM CITY - DAY 

      CLOSE ON A STACK OF NEWSPAPERS hitting the floor of a 
      newsstand.  The screaming HEADLINE -- HERO COPS DROP WAYNE 
      KILLER!  Beneath the headline are Weegee-style PHOTOS of 
      Pepper s corpse and the two GCPD Detectives. Gordon looks 
      proud and happy. 

      THIS BEGINS A MONTAGE OF PRESS PHOTOS: 

      Heroes of the hour - Gordon and Bullock speaking at a press 
      conference. Shaking hands with Mayor James. Bullock pointing 
      out Pepper s death site.  Gordon smiling into the camera 
      alongside Barbara at a charity ball. The last image is a 
      PHOTO of Bruce Wayne. The caption states - WAYNE FUNERAL ON 
      SUNDAY.

      EXT. BUS STOP. GOTHAM - DAY

      The newspaper is being read by Oswald Cobblepot, wearing a 
      baseball hat and dark glasses, and sitting on the bus stop 
      bench.  A plain clothes police Crown Vic pulls up. Oswald 
      looks around warily before climbing into the back--

      EXT/INT. MCU CROWN VIC ON GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

      Crispus Allen of the MCU is behind the wheel, Renee Montoya 
      alongside.  Not expecting much from this meeting...

                                  OSWALD
                    What a great pleasure to see you 
                    again, Mr. Allen, mizz Montoya.  

                                    MONTOYA
                    Whatcha got?

                                  OSWALD
                    As you know, I am a close associate 
                    of Fish Mooney.

                                    MONTOYA
                    No disrespect, aren t you more of a 
                    dogsbody?

                                  OSWALD
                    I beg to differ. Be that as it may.  
                    You may trust me when I tell you 
                    that Mario Pepper was framed by 
                    Fish Mooney and the cops.                                                                                     31.

                                  ALLEN
                    You got our attention. 

                                  OSWALD
                    I saw miss Mooney with Martha 
                    Wayne s pearl necklace. She was 
                      discussing how to get it into 
                    Pepper s home, inside a bag of 
                    drugs.  This was shortly after she 
                    met with Detectives Bullock and 
                    Gordon from the homicide squad. 

                                  ALLEN
                    She had the necklace huh?  Mooney 
                    works for Carmine Falcone. Are you 
                    saying Falcone had the Waynes 
                    killed? 

                                  OSWALD
                    That I cannot tell. I don t know 
                    how Mooney acquired the necklace.
                    I am conveying only what I can 
                    vouch for honestly.  

                                    MONTOYA
                    Why snitch on your own boss?

                                  OSWALD
                    Public spirit, sir.  That poor 
                    orphan boy pricked my conscience.

                                  ALLEN
                    You want Fish pushed out huh?  
                    You think Butch Gilzean would make 
                    a better boss for you?  

      Oswald scowls. Allen is right. He hates it when ordinary 
      mortals guess his intentions.

                                  OSWALD
                    Miss Mooney has been rude and 
                      disrespectful to me, but that is 
                    beside the point. I am doing my 
                    civic duty.  Good day to you both. 

      Oswald gets out of the car and waddles away.

                                  ALLEN
                    Looks just exactly like a penguin 
                    doesn t he? 

                                    MONTOYA
                    Yes he does.

                                  ALLEN
                    But I think he s telling the truth.                                                                                    32.

      Off Oswald Cobblepot...

      INT. EMERGENCY ROOM. HOSPITAL - DAY (D/3 CONT D)

      Barbara in scrubs, tying off a bandage on a LITTLE KID s leg.

                                    BARBARA
                    There you go, Joey.

      She claps the little kid on the back, sends him on his way.  
      She sees Renee Montoya walk in.  Barbara s not thrilled to 
      see her, but puts on a decent show of pleasure.  They hug. 

                                    BARBARA (CONT D)
                    Renee, long time. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    Yeah.  How you been?

                                    BARBARA
                    Good, great. And you?

                                    MONTOYA
                    All good. 

                                    BARBARA
                    I m engaged. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    I heard.  James Gordon.  That s 
                    kinda why I m here. Can we talk 
                    someplace private?

      EXT. HOSPITAL COURTYARD GARDEN - DAY

      Barbara and Montoya in a quiet spot. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    I m working for the Major Crimes 
                    Unit now. We were set up by Mayor 
                    James to combat organized crime and 
                      corruption. We re totally 
                      independent of the GCPD.

                                    BARBARA 
                    Where s this going?

                                    MONTOYA
                    Thomas and Martha Wayne were good 
                    people. They were the moral 
                      conscience of this city. And they 
                    weren t afraid to shake things up. 
                    Alot of powerful people smiled in 
                    their face but secretly hated them.  
                    Wanted them dead. So now they are 
                    dead.  Things will change in this 
                    city. And not for the better.                                                                                    33.

                                    BARBARA
                    Renee, Why are you telling me all 
                    this?

                                    MONTOYA
                    We think Mario Pepper was framed 
                    for the murder.  And we think the 
                    GCPD was in on it.   

      Barbara takes a beat, trying to stay calm.

                                    BARBARA
                    You mean James was in on it.  
                    My James. Is that why you re here?

                                    MONTOYA
                    Yes.

                                    BARBARA
                    And what s your proof?

                                    MONTOYA
                    I can t tell you, but it s the 
                    truth.  James Gordon is not a good 
                    guy.  You deserve better. 

                                    BARBARA
                    James Gordon is the most honest man 
                    I ve ever met. It s one of the 
                    reasons I love him.  He s not even 
                    capable of doing that. Couldn t lie 
                    to save his life.

                                    MONTOYA
                    Are you sure you know what he s 
                    capable of?  

                                    BARBARA
                    Yes I am.

                                    MONTOYA 
                    Does he know you as well?

                                    BARBARA
                    Yes he does. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    Not like I do.

                                    BARBARA
                    Don t go there. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    I still love you, Barbara.  I can t 
                    stand to see you get hurt.                                                                                    34.

                                    BARBARA
                    Don t.

                                    MONTOYA
                    I can t help it.  I want you back. 

                                    BARBARA
                    It s over, Renee.  It s over. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    You left me because you wanted a 
                    normal life.  And now you re going 
                    to throw that life away on a 
                    crooked cop?  Really?  

                                    BARBARA
                    He s not crooked.  And I left you 
                    because you treated me badly. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    Yes.  I did and I m ashamed and I m 
                    sorry. I ve changed.  No pills, no 
                    drinking. I m totally clean for 
                    eighteen months.

                                    BARBARA
                    That s great.  I m happy for you.  
                    Truly. But we re done, you and me.  
                    I m marrying James.  And what 
                    you re saying about him is 
                      manipulative and untrue.  So I 
                    wonder how much you ve really 
                    changed.    

      Barbara tries to leave, but Renee holds her. 

                                    BARBARA (CONT D)
                    Let me go.

      Renee checks herself, kisses Barbara gently and lets her go.  

                                    MONTOYA
                    I m sorry.

      EXT. GOTHAM CEMETERY - DAY

      SONG CONTINUES OVER NEWS CAMERA FOOTAGE -- a vast rolling 
      meadow of gravestones, the city skyline looming beyond.  
      Martha and Thomas are buried together. As the coffins are 
      lowered into their grave and a GOSPEL SINGER SINGS...        
      We pan across a tableau of Gotham Society seated by the 
      graveside.  POLITICIANS, TYCOONS, SOCIALITES and MAFIA 
      BOSSES. At one end of the front row is MAYOR AUBREY JAMES.                                                                                      35.

      In the center is Bruce Wayne, a pale wraith with burning 
      eyes. flanked by Alfred. At the other end sits CARMINE 
      FALCONE (60 s, leonine).

                                  NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                    Thomas and Martha Wayne were buried 
                    today and a cross-section of Gotham 
                    society was there to pay their 
                    respects.  Everyone from Mayor 
                    Aubrey James to Carmine  The Roman  
                    Falcone, reputed patriarch of the 
                    notorious Falcone Crime family.

      Gordon, Barbara Kean, Bullock, and Captain Essen are seated 
      in the second row. Each wrapped in their own thoughts.

      EXT. GOTHAM CEMETERY - DAY 

      LATER, AFTER THE BURIAL. A line of people wait to give 
      condolences to Bruce Wayne, who lights up a little when he 
      sees Gordon approach.  They shake hands. The boy has grown 
      wise and solemn way beyond his years. 

                                  BRUCE
                    You kept your promise. Thank you.

                                  GORDON 
                    No thanks necessary. 

                                  BRUCE
                    And you were right. There is some 
                    light. Not much, but enough.

                                  GORDON
                    I m glad. If you ever need my help 
                    in any way, please, call on me.  

                                  BRUCE
                    I will. Thank you.

      They hug each other briefly.

      Off Barbara, watching this -- her mind in turmoil...

      INT. TERRACE. BARBARA S APARTMENT - NIGHT (N/3)

      Barbara gazes out at the city, still in her funeral clothes, 
      CRYING. Gordon comes out on the terrace.

                                  GORDON
                    Barbara, what s wrong?  Barbara?

      Long beat. She looks at him imploringly.

                                    BARBARA
                    Did you frame Mario Pepper?                                                                                    36.

                                  GORDON
                    What?!  No.  What? 

                                    BARBARA
                    I knew it. I knew you couldn t lie 
                    to that poor boy.

                                  GORDON
                    Who told you Pepper was framed?

                                    BARBARA
                    It doesn t matter.  As long as it s 
                    not true. 

                                  GORDON
                    It s not. Who told you it was?  

                                    BARBARA
                    Just gossip in the ER. We get a lot 
                    of street criminals. 

                                  GORDON
                    But that s not where you heard it.

                                    BARBARA
                    That s where I heard it.

                                  GORDON
                    Bee, I can tell when you re lying.

                                    BARBARA
                    Stop being a detective.

                                  GORDON 
                      A detective is what I am. Tell me. 

                                    BARBARA
                    I ran into an old friend from City 
                    College.  Renee Montoya.

      EXT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT HQ - DAY (D/4)

      A clean modernist office block.  Montoya and Allen emerge 
      from the MCU, head for their car.  Gordon approaches, angry. 

                                  GORDON
                    Montoya!

                                    MONTOYA
                    You go on.  Let me handle this.

      He walks on.  Gordon gets on Montoya.

                                  GORDON
                    Why would you tell my fianc e a 
                    crock of lies?  What did I do to 
                    you that you would do that?                                                                                     37.

                                    MONTOYA
                    We re old friends, we got to 
                    talking, and it came out. It was 
                      unprofessional, and I apologize.   

                                  GORDON
                      Unprofessional?  It s criminal 
                    slander!  There was no frame. 

                                    MONTOYA
                    We have evidence says otherwise.

                                  GORDON
                    Which is what?

                                    MONTOYA
                    I m not giving it to you. GCPD are 
                    neck deep in this mess.

                                  GORDON
                    The GCPD wasn t involved in any 
                    frame up. I busted Pepper for 
                      christsakes. I would know, right? 

                                    MONTOYA
                    Maybe you re so young and dumb that 
                    they left you out of the loop. But 
                    I doubt it.  I think you re just a 
                    damn good liar. 

      Gordon s thrown. Could she be right?  Is he out of the loop? 

                                  GORDON
                    If you have evidence, why don t you 
                    press charges?

                                    MONTOYA
                    We might.

                                  GORDON
                    Why would anyone frame Pepper?  

                                    MONTOYA
                    I don t trust you. If you re for 
                    real, you ll have to find out the 
                    truth for yourself. 

      She walks away.  On Gordon, confounded...

      INT. BULLPEN. HOMICIDE SQUAD. GCPD HQ - DAY

      Gordon and Bullock have desks that face each other. 
      Bullock looks quizzically at Gordon, who is nervously rolling 
      a miniature desk football in his hands.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Framed?  How you figure that?  You 
                    were there.  We framed him?

                                  GORDON
                    No.  But somebody could have 
                    planted the necklace on Pepper for 
                    us to find.  Fish Mooney could have 
                    set the whole thing up.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Why?

                                  GORDON
                    To cover up for the real killer.  
                    Mooney works for Falcone. Maybe 
                    Falcone wanted the Waynes dead. 
                    Maybe there was a conspir-

                    --For chrissakes, why would such a 
                    nutty idea even enter your head? 

                                  GORDON
                    Montoya from the MCU told me that -- 

                                    BULLOCK
                          (erupting in anger)
                    -- That drunk-ass pillhead dike 
                      loonybird? Shit.  Why the hell are 
                    you listening to her? 

                                  GORDON
                    Of course I m listening.  Am I 
                    supposed to ignore her when she 
                    tells me the MCU has proof of a 
                    frame up?  I promised Bruce Wayne 
                    that I would find the truth--- 

                                    BULLOCK
                    --Never mind Bruce Wayne. 
                    What s Montoya s proof?

                                  GORDON
                    Wouldn t tell me. Didn t trust me.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Bah, they ve got nothing.  If they 
                    did, they d use it.                                                                                     39.

                                  GORDON
                    You don t think we should take a 
                    second look?  We could talk to the 
                    fence that gave Mooney the tip.

                                    BULLOCK
                      Supposing, just supposing Pepper 
                    was innocent. I killed him.  

                                  GORDON
                    We killed him.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Yeah. We killed him. And we d have 
                    to pay. We d lose our jobs at the 
                    very least. The case is closed. 
                    Forget about it. You hear me? 
                    Forget about it.

      Off Gordon, unhappy...

      INT. BEDROOM. BARBARA S APARTMENT - NIGHT (N/4)

      Gordon and Barbara in bed, both reading books distractedly.

                    Did you speak to Renee Montoya?

                                  GORDON
                    Yes, I did.

                                    BARBARA
                          (sidelong glance)
                    And?  How did it go?

                                  GORDON
                    She said sorry.  They were 
                    mistaken.  Once they looked into 
                    things.

      Barbara s relieved that Montoya apparently revealed nothing 
      of their old love affair.

                                    BARBARA
                    Oh good, that s great, right?

                                  GORDON
                    Yes.

      Off Gordon, filled with guilt and confusion.

      Gordon enters.                                                                                      40.

      INT. GOLDEN AGE NITE CLUB - DAY 

      Not open yet, the place is deserted.  Oswald is working on 
      account books at one of the tables.

                                  GORDON
                    Oswald, right?

                                  OSWALD
                    How nice to see you again Detective 
                    Gordon.  Can I help you?

                                  GORDON
                    I need to speak with Mooney.

                                  OSWALD
                    Regarding what shall I say?

                                  GORDON
                    Mario Pepper.

                                  OSWALD
                          (twitching)
                    I don t wish to be impertinent, but 
                      um...Um... May I ask why?

                                  GORDON
                    No.  

                                  OSWALD 
                    Yes, no. Ha ha. None of my business 
                    is it?  Um....  

                                  GORDON
                    Go tell Miss Mooney I m here.   

      Oswald abruptly switches demeanor, to hissing menace...   

                                  OSWALD
                    Get out of here you fool!  Scram!

                                  GORDON
                    Whoa. Why are you so upset?

      Before Oswald can reply, Mooney emerges from a back room with 
      two HENCHMEN. She sees the tension between Gordon and Oswald.

                                  MOONEY
                    Well well, Gordon, was it?  You 
                    seem a little wired. Something 
                    wrong?

                                  GORDON
                    I m not sure yet. I have some 
                    questions I need to ask you.

      Mooney throws a sharp glance to Oswald.                                                                                     41.

                                  MOONEY
                      Intriguing.  I have a couple 
                    minutes.  Come ask me questions. 

      A MOMENT LATER IN A CORNER BOOTH...  

                                  MOONEY (CONT D)
                    So. 

                                  GORDON
                    What s the name of the fence who 
                    gave you Mario Pepper?

                                  MOONEY 
                    Why do you ask?

                                  GORDON
                    I m looking into allegations that  
                    Pepper was framed. 

                                  MOONEY
                          (genuinely puzzled)
                    Framed.  Is this a gag? 

                                  GORDON
                    No. 

      Mooney takes a beat. WTF is this guy s game?

                                  MOONEY
                    Who told you there was a frame?

                                  GORDON
                    Was there a frame?

                                  MOONEY
                    Why would anyone frame Pepper? 

                                  GORDON
                    As part of a cover up. The Waynes 
                    had alot of power in this city. 
                    Maybe somebody had the Waynes 
                    killed so that they could take that 
                    power for themselves.   

                                  MOONEY
                    Huh. And if they did?

                                  GORDON
                    I ll follow the evidence wherever 
                    it leads. 

                                  MOONEY
                    A regular little tornado of 
                    justice, huh.  Harvey doesn t know 
                    you re here, does he?                                                                                    42.

                                  GORDON
                    No.  Why do you ask? 

                                  MOONEY
                    James, James, you got so much going 
                    for you.  You re a likeable fella.   
                    You talk well.  You look good.     
                    A war hero for chrissakes. It s a 
                    damn shame you re so dumb.

      Mooney picks up the table lamp and smashes it over Gordon s 
      head, then jumps on him, taking off her shoes to use as 
      weapons. Gordon tries to defend himself, but Mooney s 
      Henchmen join in and he s beaten unconscious.

      INT. BULLPEN. HOMICIDE SQUAD. GCPD HQ - DAY 

      Barbara appears in the doorway.  She s never been here before 
      and looks around lost, until she finds Bullock. 

                                    BARBARA
                    Detective Bullock.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Mizz Kean.

                                    BARBARA
                    I can t get a hold of James.  Not 
                    since this morning.  Have you heard 
                    from him?  

                                    BULLOCK
                    No. I thought he was with you.

                                    BARBARA
                    No. I m worried about him. 

      Bullock s now worried himself, but doesn t want to worry her.

                                    BULLOCK 
                    Oh, wait, I remember now. He s on a 
                    stake out. His phone probably ran 
                    out of juice. 

                                    BARBARA
                    Oh. Well, that s a relief. I feel 
                    silly now for worrying. Thank you. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    No problemo.

      Barbara leaves. Bullock looks deeply torn. He picks up 
      Gordon s desk football, squeezes it. 

                                    BULLOCK (CONT D)
                    You dumbass boy scout sonofabitch.  
                    You didn t listen to me did you?                                                                                    43.

      Bullock takes a beat. He decides to do the right thing... 

                                    BULLOCK (CONT D)
                    Damn.

      He exits, hurling the football at an unsuspecting cop. 

      INT. CAR TRUNK (MOVING) - DAY

      Gordon wakes in the trunk of a moving car.  His face is 
      battered and bloody, hands tied behind his back.

      Gordon wriggles around until he can get the right angle and 
      starts kicking the trunk lid as hard as he can.    

      EXT. RIVERSIDE HIGHWAY - DAY

      Gilzean s car is moving fast in light traffic, Gilzean and 
      two HENCHMEN inside.  Banging NOISE from the trunk...

      The trunk lid bursts open.  Gordon pops up and throws himself 
      out of the moving car, rolling and bouncing along the road, 
      causing cars and trucks to brake and swerve and collide.  

                                    GILZEAN
                      Sonofabitch!  Pull over.

      The gangsters  car swerves to the side of the road and stops. 

      Gordon scrambles to his feet and runs through the traffic. 
      But Gilzean and his men catch up to him, beat him down and 
      drag him back to their car, watched by astonished drivers, 
      who gawp and take photos on their celphones rather than 
        intervening. Only one TRUCK DRIVER gets out of his cab to 
      help, but thinks better of it when a Henchman points his gun. 

                                    GILZEAN (CONT D)
                    I told you to lock it, didn t I? 

                                  HENCHMAN
                    My bad.  I thought I did.

      They throw Gordon back in the trunk and drive on, ignoring 
      the commotion around them.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. GATES OF SLAUGHTERHOUSE - DAY (D/5 CONT D)

      Iron gates.  An old brick building beyond.  Bullock leans 
      against his car, waiting, humming tunelessly.  Nobody s 
      around.  Gilzean s car drives up, stops at the gates.

      INT. TRUNK OF GILZEAN S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Gordon listens intently.

                                  HENCHMAN (O.S.)
                    You want us to wet him down?

                                  GILZEAN (O.S.)
                    No, wait.  But be ready.

    The SOUND of the CAR DOORS OPENING and men getting out.

      EXT. GATES OF SLAUGHTERHOUSE - DAY 

      Bullock faces Gilzean and the two HENCHMEN.

                                  BULLOCK
                    Hey, Butch. 

                                  GILZEAN 
                    Harvey.  Who told you we d be here?

                                  BULLOCK
                    Everybody knows this is where you 
                    take your problems. You wouldn t 
                    have my partner in your trunk there 
                    would you?

                                  GILZEAN
                    What if I do?

                                  BULLOCK
                    Let me talk to Fish.

      Gilzean considers...

      INT. GOLDEN AGE NITE CLUB - DAY

      Fish Mooney at a table, eating a sandwich and listening to a 
      COMEDIAN (20 s, skinny, ginger, big smile) audition on the 
      little stage.  Oswald is hovering nearby.  

                                  COMEDIAN
                    ...I m in the park.  There s this 
                    lady with a cute dog.  I ask her, 
                    does your dog bite?  She says no, 
                    so I pat the dog and it bites me.

                    I say to the lady, you said your 
                    dog doesn t bite. She says, that s 
                    not my dog. 

      Mooney laughs.  Her PHONE BUZZES.  She answers.

                    Bullock met us at the plant. 
                    Wants to talk to you.

                          (to Oswald)
                    Medicine.

      Oswald hurries off.  Mooney gestures to the Comedian...

                                  MOONEY (CONT D)
                    One minute, kid.  You re doing good.

      AT THE GATES, Gilzean hands the phone to Bullock.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Fish?

                                  MOONEY
                    Speaking.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Ah don t be like that.
                    You got to let my boy go. 
                    I swear he won t be anymore 
                    trouble. I will vouch for him one 
                    hundred and ten percent.  How long 
                    have we been friends? 

                                  MOONEY
                    For a long time until today.  
                    I did a big favor for you and now 
                    it s gonna blow up in my face on 
                    account of your stupidity. That s 
                    not okay sugar.  Why the hell you 
                    got a partner that doesn t know 
                    what time it is?   

                                    BULLOCK
                    Lookit, the kid is not your problem 
                    here.  He was hipped to the frame 
                    by Major Crimes. They ll be coming 
                    after you.                                                                                      46.

      Oswald comes back with a leather handbag.  Mooney snatches it 
      from him and rummages inside -- It s a loose grab bag of 
        pharmaceuticals.  Oswald hurries to fetch a glass of water.  

                                  MOONEY
                    How did they get onto me? 

                                    BULLOCK
                    The usual way I guess. Somebody 
                    talked.

                                  MOONEY
                    Not one of my people.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Everybody says that.

      Mooney is looking right at Oswald, who is looking back at her 
      with a glass of water and a look of humble unction that now 
      looks very suspicious to Mooney. 

                                  MOONEY
                    True.  True.

                                    BULLOCK
                    So, Fish, let Gordon go uh? I kinda

      Bullock hands the phone to Gilzean.

                                    GILZEAN
                    Yeah, boss.

      Gilzean puts away his phone, and makes a subtle gesture to 
      one of the Henchmen. 

                                    BULLOCK

      The Henchman HITS BULLOCK OVER THE HEAD with the butt of his 
      gun.  BULLOCK FALLS. 

      We exit the SPLIT SCREEN.

      Mooney smiles wanly at Oswald as he hands her a water glass.

      Mooney waves at the Comedian... 

                                  MOONEY
                    Give me a moment, kid.  I haven t 
                    forgotten you. I like you.  You re 
                    funny.

      Oswald rubs her neck.  She groans in relief.

                    that the Waynes are dead?

                                  OSWALD
                    Well, I don t know.

                    I have.  I have been like a mother 
                    to you. Which is what I don t

                    you, and just when I m on the verge 
                    of great things, you betray me? 
                    What kind of low-life scum betrays 
                    their own mother? 

      Oswald stops rubbing her neck.

                                  OSWALD
                    I I I don t know what you mean.

                    Nobody else did. 

      He backs up.  She stalks him across the room.  

                                  OSWALD
                    Gilzean saw you too!  It was 
                    Gilzean!  He s the snitch. 

                                  MOONEY
                    No. Gilzean is loyal.

                                  OSWALD

                    I swear.  I d open a vein right 
                    here and now if you asked me to.

      Mooney has backed Oswald into a corner of the room. She picks 
      up a STEAK KNIFE from a dining table, offers it to Oswald. 

                                  MOONEY

      Piqued by the hated name, Oswald pretends to cringe, and 
      takes the knife reluctantly...

                                  OSWALD

      And he lunges at Mooney with the knife.  But Mooney s waiting 
      for him. She avoids the lunge, picks up a chair and batters 
      Oswald to the floor.

      Mooney smiles at the Comedian, frozen in terror onstage.

                    So sorry.  Go on.

      INT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE - NIGHT

      A big dank barn, lined on one side with livestock pens.     
      On the other side, big rolling motorised doors.  

      In one pen, there are several angry half starved PIGS. In the 
      next pen, separated by a double bolted gate, Gordon and 
      Bullock are HANGING UPSIDE DOWN FROM CHAINS attached to a 
      winch. Bullock is coming round as we join them. He focuses 
      blearily on Gordon. Both men are revolving slowly.   

                                    BULLOCK
                    How you doing?

                                  GORDON
                    Been better. 

      Bullock sees the pigs.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Oh Jesus Christ. 

                                  GORDON
                    Yeah. I m going to try and swing 
                    over to you. Maybe I can untie you.                                                                                    50.

                                    BULLOCK
                    You do that. Jesus Christ. 

      Gordon starts trying to swing...

                                  GORDON
                    Thanks for trying to help. 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Wish I hadn t now.

                                  GORDON
                    Don t blame you. I wish you d told 
                    me the truth.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Shut up and swing wouldya please.

      Gordon is swinging well now, closer and closer to Bullock.       
      He reaches out and manages to grab Bullock s arms and then 
      tries to haul himself up to Bullock s roped ankles...

      CLANG - a bank of overhead lights come on. Gilzean and two 
      Henchmen enter. One of them - SERGIO - is carrying a camera 
      on a tripod, which he sets up by the pen. 

                                    BULLOCK (CONT D)
                    Butch, listen to me--- 

                                    GILZEAN
                    ---Yeah, sorry, no. If it was up to 
                    me, you d get a bullet in the head, 
                    and a decent funeral. But Fish has 
                    her ways. 

      Gilzean starts unbolting the gate that separates the pigs 
      from Gordon and Bullock. The animals squeal and snort in 
        anticipation...

                                    GILZEAN (CONT'D)
                    You ready?  

                                  SERGIO
                    One sec.

                                    GILZEAN
                      Christsake.

                                  SERGIO
                    It s a new camera.  Okay.  Ready.

      Gordon keeps methodically trying to get free, although he 
      knows it s useless.  Bullock squirms in helpless anger...

                                    BULLOCK
                    I hope you die of cancer you 
                    miserable piece of crap!                                                                                     51.

      Gilzean tries to open the last bolt on the gate. But it s 
      rusty and stiff... 

      Right then, the large rolling doors of the slaughterhouse 
      start sliding open; revealing a gleaming BLACK LIMO, lights 
      blazing, motor running.  The limo doors open. THREE MAFIA 
      HARD MEN and CARMINE FALCONE get out and enter the 
        slaughterhouse.  

      Gilzean is shocked and a little scared.

                                    GILZEAN
                    Don Falcone.  I m honored to uh...

      He falls silent.  Falcone looks him over mildly.

                                    FALCONE 
                    Forgive me young man, I forget what 
                    your name is. Or perhaps I never 
                    knew it.  Please release these men 
                    and give them water.   

      EXT. LOADING DOCK. SLAUGHTERHOUSE  - NIGHT

      The dock overlooks the city. Falcone walks with Gordon, who 
      is confused by this abrupt change in fortune and this 
      notorious villain s friendly manner.

                                    FALCONE
                    You have good blood James.  
                    And I don t like to spill good 
                    blood. That s why I m giving you 
                    another chance. One day, you could 
                    be a big man in this city, like 
                    your father. He died when you were 
                    what, nine?   

                                  GORDON
                    Yes.

                                    FALCONE
                    It s a shame you didn t get the 
                    chance to know him better. He was a 
                    great man. The best DA this city 
                    ever had.  And a good friend.

                                  GORDON
                          (dubious)
                    A friend of yours?

      Falcone bristles at the implicit disrespect.

                                    FALCONE
                    A good friend. That s the only 
                    reason you re alive right now.  
                    Your father and I understood each 
                    other. There was respect.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    52.

                                    FALCONE (CONT'D)
                    And he loved this city like I love 
                    this city. 
                          (beat)
                    It s going to hell.  We got gangs, 
                    crazy people, drug dealers, rapists 
                    and robbers running the streets.  
                    It s getting worse and worse.  
                    I don t know why. Sometimes I think 
                    this place is cursed. But I won t 
                    let it fall apart without a fight.   

                                  GORDON
                    I don t understand. Didn t you have 
                    the Waynes killed?  How does that 
                    help Gotham?

      Falcone laughs. 

                                    FALCONE
                    What an idea. I didn t kill the 
                    Waynes. I loved the Waynes. 

                                  GORDON
                    Who killed them then? It wasn t 
                    Pepper, was it?

                                    FALCONE
                    I have no idea who killed them.  
                    It was a mugging. Random fate.  
                    You and Bullock might have found 
                    the culprit eventually, but 
                    probably not. Pepper was sacrificed 
                    so that the people of Gotham would 
                    see swift justice done.  So they 
                    can feel safe.  So they can sleep 
                    at night. 

                                  GORDON
                    And that matters to you.

                                    FALCONE
                    Of course. I m a businessman, not 
                    an anarchist. I love law and order 
                    just like you do. You can t have 
                    organized crime without law and 
                    order.  There d be chaos.  When 
                    things like the Wayne Murders 
                    happen, it feels like nobody is 
                    safe.  People get scared. They lose 
                    faith in the city. That s the last 
                    thing anybody wants.  Not me, not 
                    the Mayor, not the chief of police. 
                    Nobody.                                                                                     53.

                                  GORDON
                    You re seriously telling me they 
                    all were in on framing Pepper, 
                    they re all corrupt.

                                    FALCONE
                    They re all realistic, and co-
                      operative. That s how the city 
                    works. We cooperate. You think 
                    Bullock is some kind of a renegade? 
                    He was following orders.  It was 
                    agreed that someone needed to be 
                    caught before the funeral. 

                                  GORDON
                    But then how did Mooney come to 
                    have Martha Wayne s necklace? 

                                    FALCONE
                    A replica of course.

                                  GORDON
                    No, it was the real thing.  Lab 
                    said so.  Real south sea pearls and 
                    old gold.  A hundred thousand 
                    dollars worth.

                                    FALCONE
                    Of course it was the real thing. 
                    And it cost more like twice that. 

                                  GORDON
                    Why should I believe you?

                                    FALCONE
                    You have a hard head. I spared your 
                    life.  Why lie to you now?

                                  GORDON
                          (stiffly)
                    Thank you for deciding not to kill 
                    me Mr. Falcone.  Are we done?  Can 
                    I go now?

      Falcone smiles ruefully at the young man s stubborn courage.

                                    FALCONE
                    I haven t decided anything yet. 
                    I m giving you a chance to do the 
                    right thing. Don t be self-
                      righteous. Don t be arrogant. 
                    Listen to advice.

                                  GORDON
                    You want me to keep quiet about all 
                    of this.                                                                                    54.

                                    FALCONE
                    Now that the Waynes are gone, 
                    Gotham is on a knife edge. What do 
                    you suppose bringing down city hall 
                    and the police force will do?  Make 
                    things better?  Really? 

                                  GORDON
                    I will have told the truth.

                                    FALCONE
                    Your father was a very wise man. 
                    He gave me some good advice one 
                    time. I was angry over some 
                      disrespect that had been shown me. 
                    Carmine my friend he said, in that 
                    calm voice he had, this city is 
                    worth more than your personal 
                    honor. 

      Falcone pats Gordon s cheek.

                                    FALCONE (CONT D)
                          (good luck)
                    In bocca al lupo.

      He walks away... 

      EXT. GATES OF SLAUGHTERHOUSE - DAY (D/6)

      Dawn. The sun is a sliver on the horizon.  Gordon limps out 
      of the plant.  Bullock is leaning against his car. 

      EXT. CAR (MOVING). GOTHAM WATERFRONT - DAY

      Bullock at the wheel, Gordon alongside. Both a little stunned.

                                  GORDON
                    Lookit, Jim...

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    I m listening.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Okay. I wasn t honest with you. But 
                    you weren t ready for the truth.  

                                  GORDON
                    I think you didn t tell me because 
                    you were ashamed.  

      It s true, but Bullock would never admit that.

                                    BULLOCK 
                    I m not ashamed of anything.
                    This is how the world works.                                                                                     55.

      Bullock steers the car onto... 

      EXT. RIVERFRONT PIER - CONTINUOUS

      Deserted, sheltered from the road. Bullock stops the car, and 
      jumps out, angry. Gordon follows.

                                  GORDON
                    Why are you stopping here?

      Bullock opens the trunk of the car to reveal Oswald 
      Cobblepot, beaten, gagged, in his shirt and underpants, hands 
      tied behind his back, wide eyed, making desperate noises. 
      Gordon is shocked.

                                    BULLOCK
                    This is the fool that snitched to 
                    Montoya and Allen.  Falcone wants 
                    you to kill him. 

                                  GORDON
                    You re kidding me.

                                    BULLOCK 
                    Take him to the end of the pier and 
                    shoot him in the head. Then 
                    everybody knows you re with the 
                    program. 

                                  GORDON
                    And if I don t? 

                                    BULLOCK
                    Then I m supposed to take out him 
                    and you both. Here s the thing 
                    Jimmy, you re an okay guy. I might 
                    not have the stomach to do that. 
                    But I will try, because if I don t, 
                    someone else ll get to you quick 
                    enough.  Someone ll get to both of 
                    us. Probably Barbara as well. Who 
                    knows what you told her. 

                                  GORDON
                    I told her nothing.

                                    BULLOCK
                    You think Falcone will be cool with 
                    that?  
                          (beat)
                    Come on, you killed people before.

                                  GORDON
                    That was war.                                                                                    56.

                                    BULLOCK
                    So is this. We re at war with low 
                    life dirtbags like this guy. In a 
                    war, you have to do bad things to 
                    do good.  Do you want to do this 
                    bad thing, or do you want to die 
                    and maybe your girl dies as well. 
                    To me, that s not a tough call.  

      Gordon takes a long beat, nods, and gestures to Oswald.

                                  GORDON
                    Out.

                                    BULLOCK
                    Attaboy.

      Oswald cowers, doesn t move.  Gordon and Bullock manhandle 
      him out of the trunk and onto his feet. 

                                  GORDON
                    Walk.

      Gordon shoves Oswald into motion.  The two of them walk to the 
      end of the pier. Gordon has to drag Oswald along by his 
      collar.  Bullock watches from a distance.

      Gordon and Oswald get to the pier s edge.  BLACK WATER 
      chunked with ice speeds past twenty feet below. 

      Gordon unties the cord round Oswald s wrists. 

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    Turn around.

      Oswald turns to face him, mewling and pleading through the 
      gag.  Gordon points the gun at his head.

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    Don t ever come back to Gotham.

      BLAM!  Gordon fires the gun inches from Oswald s head, at the 
      same time shoving him hard in the chest.  Oswald falls twenty 
      feet into the freezing black water of the Gotham River. 

      From BULLOCK S POV, the killing looks legit. 

      EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

      Oswald sinks to the bottom flailing, but then finds his 
      bearings, pulls the gag off, and swims away with good 
      technique. 

      EXT. RIVERFRONT PIER - DAY

      Gordon and Bullock get into the car. A moment of heavy 
      silence. Bullock pats Gordon on the knee, then starts the 
      car, drives away.                                                                                    57.

      INT. BARBARA KEAN S APARTMENT - DAY 

      Barbara opens the door to her apartment and finds Gordon 
      there, swaying on his feet, looking like bloody hell.

                                    BARBARA
                    Oh my God.  
                          (embraces him)
                    I ve been so worried.  What 
                    happened to you? 
                          (no reply)
                    James? 

      He holds her tighter. Tears welling in his eyes.  She asks no 
      more and just holds him, stroking his hair. 

      EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY - ESTABLISHING (D/7)

      A sunny day. The Gothic spires of the Victorian mansion look 
      almost cheerful.  We move closer and find young Bruce Wayne on 
      the roof, standing a foot away from the edge of a parapet, 
      over a dizzying drop.  He s very scared, but he takes a deep 
      breath and steps right to the very edge of the parapet, 
        deliberately trying to conquer his fear.   

                                  BRUCE
                    One hundred, ninety nine, ninety 
                    eight, ninety seven...

      EXT. WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS  

      Walking up the driveway of the manor to the front door, 
      Gordon sees Bruce up on the parapet.  He doesn t want to 
      shout for fear of startling the boy. He runs to the front 
      door, rings the bell urgently.  After an agonising wait, the 
      door opens and Alfred is there.

                                  GORDON
                    He s on the roof. Bruce is up on 
                    the roof.

                                  ALFRED 
                          (just irritated)
                    Ah bollocks.  Not again. 

      He stalks out onto the forecourt until he can see Bruce.

                                  ALFRED (CONT D)
                    Oi! Master Bruce! Stop playing 
                    silly buggers! Get your bloody arse 
                    down off there! 

      The boy sees Gordon and smiles, raises a hand in greeting.  
      He steps back from the edge and disappears from view below.                                                                                     58.

      INT. LIVING ROOM. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

      Gordon sits opposite Bruce. Alfred sits a few feet behind his 
      young master. Gordon is taken aback by the dark fire in the 
      boy s eyes. 

                                  GORDON
                    It s good to see you.

                                  BRUCE
                    And you.

                                  GORDON
                    Why were you up on the roof?

                                  ALFRED 
                    He wants me in the loony bin, 
                    that s why.  

      Bruce gives Alfred a look - remember who s boss here .

                                  BRUCE
                    I m learning to conquer fear.

                                  GORDON
                      I understand.  But fear tells you 
                    where the edge is. Fear is a good 
                    thing. It doesn t need conquering.

                                  ALFRED
                    Think I haven t told him that?

                                  BRUCE
                      I disagree. You came here for a 
                    reason, I imagine.

                                  GORDON
                    Yes. I did. I uh... I ve discovered 
                    some things that I need to tell 
                    you. Mario Pepper didn t kill your 
                    parents.  He was framed.  By the 
                    police department and the mob.  
                    Working together.  

      Bruce Wayne nods calmly and glances at Alfred, like that s a 
      possibility they discussed.

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    Carmine Falcone told me Pepper was 
                    framed only so that the public 
                    would feel safe.  He said there was 
                    no conspiracy to kill your parents. 
                    But I m not sure if I believe him. 

                                  BRUCE
                    Why not?                                                                                    59.

                                  GORDON
                    I m not sure of anything anymore, 
                    except that Gotham is headed for 
                    hard times, and I want to help.
                    So I m going to leave my next step 
                    up to you. 

      Gordon takes out his Detective s badge and hands it to Bruce.

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    I can resign from the police force 
                    today and go public with the whole 
                    story. Or I can stay on the force 
                    and fight for change from the 
                    inside. I don t know which path is 
                    best.  So I ll let you decide. 
                    Either way, I ll do my best to find 
                    out who really killed your parents. 
                    Like I promised.  

      A long beat as Bruce considers...

                                  BRUCE
                    Thanks for being honest with me. 
                    Gotham needs honest men. I think 
                    you should stay on the force and 
                    fight.

      He hands the badge back to Gordon.  

      EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

      Gordon exits, takes a deep breath of fresh air.

      WE PULL BACK AND BACK until we find Selina Kyle, perched high 
      in A TREE beyond the manor walls, with a clear view of the 
      house. Inscrutable as ever, she watches Gordon walk away with 
        a determined stride - a man on a mission. The Gotham skyline 
      looms above them both, gleaming darkly.   

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        THE END
