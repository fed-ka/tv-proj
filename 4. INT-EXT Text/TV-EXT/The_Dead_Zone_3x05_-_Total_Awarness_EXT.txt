                                          THE DEAD ZONE

                                        "TOTAL AWARENESS"

          FADE IN:


          Early on a dismal morning, one CAR traveling too fast for
          conditions.

                                        NEWS RADIO (V.O.)
                        --U.S. Senators continue to offer
                          tributes to Maine's Thomas
                          Marshall, who died yesterday after
                        collapsing while walking in
                          Georgetown--
                                (and under)


  22INSIDE THE CAR

          The driver is SYLVIA TESICH, the middle-aged, Tarot-reading
          psychic last seen in "The Hunt".  She is driving scared,
          distracted by her passenger and the news on the radio. 
          Her passenger is a young girl, 20-25, wearing a baseball
          cap, running pants, boots and black eye-liner.  Her
          tattooed arms encircle a BACKPACK as though it were a
          life preserver.  For the record, her name is GIBSON.  She
          TURNS OFF the radio.  Upset.  Gibson and Sylvia are in
          the middle of a heated conversation that will remain
          unknown to us --

                                        SYLVIA
                        They'll catch you.

                                        GIBSON
                        Just drive!

          Sylvia looks back over her shoulder.  Without warning,
          Gibson GRABS THE WHEEL--

                                        SYLVIA
                        NO!



          A TRUCK is FLYING THROUGH -- no signs of stopping.






                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT TEASER  - 1/9/04 - GREEN  2.


    3CONTINUED:3

          The car SWERVES to the left, BARELY MISSING THE TRUCK,
          before T-BONING a parked car.  The truck KEEPS GOING.


  44INSIDE THE CAR

          Gibson is shaken, but apparently unhurt.  She checks
          Sylvia, who is dead, then looks around worried.  Gibson
          TUGS Sylvia's purse away, kicks open the passenger side
          door, and GETS OUT.



          Looking from on high -- FLASH POPPING frame by frame --
          watching Gibson RUNNING FROM THE SCENE.  Grainy,
          voyeuristic and threatening, this footage should suggest
          that SOMEONE IS WATCHING.  FLASH POP TO --



          Ubiquitous.  All seeing.  You never did trust those
            things... FLASH POP TO --



          She sees Johnny and Bruce driving out the front gate. 
          She is about to approach, but Bruce's presence stops her. 
          As the Jeep drives off, all she can do is follow.



          A game center in a corner mall.  Over this shot we hear
          the ROAR of what seems like a platoon of Marines on leave--



          The emergency exit opens on an alley.  Johnny EMERGES,
          peeling off and tossing his vest back inside.  He looks
          for the girl, but she's gone.  He starts to look for her,
          but...


          AN SUV

          PULLS in front of him, cutting off his pursuit.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Watch it!

          He turns to see the driver of the SUV getting out.  This
          is COULTER, 30, stocky, muscular, earnest.  A true
            believer.

                                        COULTER
                        Johnny Smith?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who are you?

          Coulter displays a wallet-sized I.D.

                                        COULTER
                        Rob Coulter, Argon Security. 
                        This concerns the remote viewing
                        program at Mount Garnet.  I've
                        been told to tell you I'm part of
                        "Operation Prime Target".

          Johnny glances at the badge, wary.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay...

                                        COULTER
                        Do you know this young woman?

          He holds out a picture.


          A MUG SHOT OF GIBSON

          Johnny recognizes her from the laser tag maze.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT ONE - 1/16/04 - PINK-2  14.*

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know her.  I saw her for
                        the first time a few minutes ago. 
                        Two people tried to shoot her.

          Just then Adams and Roth come out of the front door. 

                                        COULTER
                        Don't worry, they're with me. 
                        They probably just saved your
                        life.  We need to get you to a
                        secure location immediately--

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, I'm in the middle of my
                        son's birthday party--

                                        COULTER
                        Going back inside could endanger
                          everyone there, Mr. Smith.  This
                        woman's name is Gibson, and we
                        believe she's trying to kill you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?

                                        COULTER
                        She's already murdered three
                          psychics from the program, 
                          including a friend of yours. 
                        Sylvia Tesich.  You worked with
                        her on Prime Target.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Sylvia's dead?

                                        COULTER
                        Gibson kidnapped Ms. Tesich and
                        robbed her of classified
                          information.  She left her to die
                        after crashing the car they were
                        in.
                                (lets this sink in)
                        Now, why don't you let us escort
                        you home?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why do I get the feeling "no" is
                        not an option.

          The VIEW RAMPS DOWN to reveal Sylvia's car approaching
          the intersection -- REVEAL JOHNNY standing on the corner
            watching.

                                                                                  CUT TO:



          Johnny walks around the frozen car, seconds before impact. 
          Johnny notices that the light is green both ways...


          UNFREEZE

          The crash happens.  Johnny walks up post crash, hears:

                                        SYLVIA
                        Find Johnny Smith.  Go... go...
                                (she dies)

          Gibson begins to breakdown, stops herself, looks around,
          then grabs Sylvia's purse, kicks open the door and takes
          off.  END VISION.          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT ONE - 1/16/04 - PINK-2  18A.

          Two Penobscot Country cruisers, RED LIGHTS FLASHING, are

          watches Coulter on the security monitor, passing through
          various camera POVs as he heads out to the street. 
          Johnny's PHONE RINGS.  He stares at it for a moment. 
          Knows it's going to be her.  He picks it up.

                                        GIBSON/BONNIE
                        Good evening, Mr. Smith, this is
                        Bonnie at Wind-n-Sea.  Did you
                        get the free certificate we left
                        for you?

          Johnny looks at the tarot card.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What can I do for you... Bonnie?

                                        GIBSON/BONNIE
                        Just give me a few minutes, Mr.*
                        Smith.  It's important.

          Off Johnny, willing to listen and not hanging up the phone --



          Johnny HURRIES UP to find Gibson inside her car, hunkered
          down so she can't be seen from far away. 

                                        GIBSON
                        I need your help.  They're trying
                        to kill me.

          Johnny isn't sure what to do.  Gibson opens the car door. 

                                        GIBSON
                        Please.

          Johnny thinks a beat, then realizes... of course he's
          getting in.  Gibson uses a screwdriver to start the car.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Stolen car?

                        Fasten your seat belt.

          As Gibson accelerates into the afternoon, Johnny looks
          back over his shoulder, wondering what the hell he's gotten
          himself into.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                        I'm the legal authority here. 
                        Johnny Smith attracts all kinds
                        of trouble.  Nobody's going
                          anywhere until we talk to him.

                        Fine.

          Walt starts marching Coulter toward the house.



          Gibson drives, badly.  Johnny HOLDS ON to the dashboard
          as she PASSES a truck unsafely.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No one's following.  Feel free to
                        slow down anytime.

                                        GIBSON
                        Just because there's no black
                        sedan behind us doesn't mean we're
                        not being followed.  We need to
                        find someplace to talk.  Someplace
                        with no security cameras.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know a spot.  Take a right here.

          Gibson takes a right -- too hard, too fast.  Johnny's
          cell phone rings and he pulls it out.  Checks the ID --
          it's Walt.  Before he can answer, Gibson TAKES IT FROM
          HIM and THROWS IT OUT the window.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey! 

                                        GIBSON
                        They can track us with that. 
                        Argon doesn't screw around.

                        I just got that phone.  Had a
                        camera in it too.

                          A camera.  Great.  Why don't you
                        just draw a freakin' map?  Listen,
                        for the foreseeable future, you
                        and me are gonna be using low

                        It was Sylvia's.  Did you get
                          anything off it?

                        That truck came out of nowhere--
                        He blew a red light.

                        No, the light was green both ways --
                        and that guy, Coulter, he had
                          pictures of the whole thing.  It
                        wasn't an accident, it was just

                        So far, Mr. Coulter, no one wants
                        to claim you.

          Walt is playing with the tablet and turns it on.  The

                        I sure hope we get to confiscate
                        all this gear.  We could use some

          Find Gibson's car rolling to a stop near a beat-up old
          Van.  Inside the Van, THREE STONERS are LAUGHING and
          GETTING HIGH.  Gibson MEETS EYES with one of them,
          determines they're too out of it to care what she's doing.

                                (turns to her)
                        Okay, start at the beginning. 
                        What were you doing in the program?

                        I have this thing for numbers. 
                        That's how I got into your house. 
                          I talked to you on the phone for
                          a minute and all your numbers
                        just flashed into my head -- see.

          She shows him her arm full of numbers.  Johnny recognizes
          some of them.

                        That's my social security number.

                          password.

                        Pretty impressive.

          She shrugs, tries to play it off as no big thing, but we
          can tell it's a burden she carries.

                                        GIBSON
                        You see visions, I see numbers. 
                        Everywhere I go, all the time. 
                        The only way I can get them out
                        of my head is to write them down.

          She rubs at her arm, as if it's scarred somehow.  Johnny
          feels for her.  He's finally met someone as tortured as
          he is.  She gives him a watery smile.

                                        GIBSON
                        Weird, huh?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not to me...  Why is Argon after
                        you?

          He smiles, urging her to continue with the story.

                                        GIBSON
                        A few months ago, Argon got the
                          contract to take over the remote
                        viewing program for the Defense

                        using his baby for something other
                        than its intended purpose.  He

                        guy named Scanlon.

                        two of the psychics were dead and
                        Neal was in the wind.  Before he
                          disappeared, he left this for
                        Sylvia.

          Another CLICK of the mouse gives us a road map, and a
          BLINKING LIGHT.

                        Last visual contact was at an ATM 
                        on west Highway 2...

          The copter veers off in pursuit.



          The speeding Camry continues around a bend -- then suddenly
          slams on the brakes, fishtailing to a stop.


          REVERSE POV

          The chopper BLOCKS THE HIGHWAY.  Coulter and Adams approach
          the Camry, GUNS DRAWN.


          WHAT THEY FIND

          It's the terrified Stoners behind the wheel.

                                        STONER DRIVER
                        Dude, some chick stole our van.          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT TWO - 1/14/04 - WHITE-2  31.



          Various license plates tell us we are in New Hampshire
          now.  The Stoner's Van is here, too, with Johnny and Gibson
          getting out of it.  Gibson follows Johnny as they low-
          profile their way along a row of trucks, Johnny touching
          each rig as they pass.

                                        GIBSON
                        What are you doing?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Looking for someone headed west--

          They pass an Auto Parts truck on the outer edge of the
          lot.  Johnny pauses:

                                        JOHNNY
                        This one.

                                        GIBSON
                        Cool.


          AT THE BACK OF THE AUTO PARTS TRUCK

          The cargo doors are padlocked.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not cool.

                                        GIBSON
                        Let me get this.

          Gibson takes the combination lock and starts spinning the
          dial.

          As she turns the dial, the correct numbers jump out at
          her.  (We see the numbers emerge, like the codes did in A
            BEAUTIFUL MIND.)

          As the lock opens.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're handy to have around.

                                        GIBSON
                        Oh yeah, I got mad skills.

          And they're inside the truck.          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT TWO - 1/9/04 - GREEN  32.



          The three Stoners are here, hands high, terrified.

                        took our car.  We were chasing
                        them when you landed.

          ANGLE ON A PHOTO OF GIBSON

          Coulter holds it in the Stoner's face.  Off Stoner's scared
          nod --



          Here goes the auto parts truck.



            Coulter's SUV rolls to a stop next to the Stoner's Van,
          abandoned.  Tablet under his arm, Coulter climbs out of
          his vehicle, heading for the car.  Adams and Roth are
          with him, scanning the lot, mundane yet threatening.

                                        COULTER
                        This is it, all right.

          He SETS the tablet on the hood of the car, then barks
          some orders into his cell phone and the HELICOPTER beam
          shuts off as the chopper PEELS AWAY.  As it does, Coulter's
          phone RINGS.  He knows who it is.

                                        COULTER
                          I thought we were supposed to
                        keep a low profile.  The choppers
                        are a bit much, don't you think? 



          Find the auto parts truck STOPPED AT A CROSSING, the
          BLINKING wig-wags blocking its path.  Nearby is an
          ELECTRICAL SUBSTATION.

          There is NO TRAIN.



          Johnny peeks around the back of the truck, reacting to--


          JOHNNY'S POV

          No train, of course, but the wig-wags ARE STILL DOWN. 
          Only the auto parts truck waits.


          RESUME JOHNNY

          Gibson follows Johnny out of the truck.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something's wrong--

          Gibson follows Johnny toward the only building nearby --
          the substation. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look!

          Johnny points toward the substation, where a SECURITY
          CAMERA sits above, pointed RIGHT AT THEM, a small red
          light GLOWING.

                                        GIBSON
                        We're so busted.

          Johnny takes the last few steps toward the building,
          TOUCHING a CABLE running down to the ground from the
          security camera, then up a pole to a small dish antenna.


7070A VISION - N.D.S.

          Starting tight on Johnny's face looking up at the camera--
          the view ramps back to the security camera POV, suddenly
          becoming grainy B&W of Johnny and Gibson still looking
          up.

          That B&W image compresses and is suddenly traveling down
          the cable -- then we're pulling back from the dish antenna --
          back in powers of ten -- until we bounce off a SATELLITE,
          then head back down to Earth, screaming down on Coulter's
          black SUV, our "signal view" crashing right through the
          hood -- until we see: The B&W security footage of Johnny
          and Gibson.

          THE VIEW RAMPS BACK AGAIN -- this time to reveal that the
          B&W image is ON COULTER'S TABLET -- next to another window

          with a GPS MAP that shows two FLASHING RED DOTS -- one
          stationary at a railroad crossing, the other moving rapidly
          along a highway, headed toward the railroad crossing.

          THE VIEW WIDENS AGAIN -- this time to reveal VISION JOHNNY
          sitting in the back seat of Coulter's car, looking over
            Coulter's shoulder as he rides shotgun.  We are in a Johnny-
              watching-Coulter-watching-Johnny loop.  Coulter shivers. 
          The DRIVER throws him a look.

                                        COULTER
                        That was weird.  For a second
                        there it almost felt like he could
                        see us.

          Hearing Coulter IN HIS VISION, real Johnny can't help
          himself, WAVING GOODBYE.

          On the monitor, WE SEE Gibson pick up a rock and she SLAMS
          it into the camera lense.  The image TURNS TO SNOW on
          impact. 

          Still part of Johnny's vision: COULTER REACTS.

          FADE IN:


          Johnny and Gibson hoof it down the empty highway.  They'd
          hitchhike, but there are no cars.

                                        GIBSON
                        Sorry I got you into this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not your fault.  Fate has had it
                        in for me for a while.

                                        GIBSON
                        I feel ya.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Here comes somebody.  Looks like
                        a tow truck.

          Johnny and Gibson jab a thumb out as the tow truck passes.


  7272THE TOW TRUCK - SEEN FROM BEHIND

          It grinds to a halt as Johnny and Gibson run after it.

                                        GIBSON
                        Let me do the talking.  I've got
                        other skills besides number
                        crunching.

          She UNZIPS her sweatshirt and adjusts her tank top to
          expose some cleavage.  Johnny gives her a look.

                        Hey there, going my way--?

          But Gibson's reaction tells us something is very wrong.

                                        DRIVER (O.S.)
                          Possibly.


          REVERSE TO REVEAL

          The tow truck driver is a WOMAN.  Suddenly self-conscious,
          Gibson turns to Johnny, who is just catching up.  He reacts
          to the Woman Driver, and off Gibson's look, decides to
          try Plan B, turning on the old J. Smith charm.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Uh, good evening, miss...

          He notes the signage on the truck -- "Betty's Towing".

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...you must be Betty.

                                        BETTY
                        That's me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nice truck, Betty.

          Betty is not what you'd call easy on the eyes. 
            Nevertheless, she's charmed by Johnny.

                                        BETTY
                        You need a ride?

          As Johnny and Gibson climb in, Johnny throws Gibson a
          smile.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

          Adams and Roth standing under the broken camera, looking
          frustrated.  Coulter has the tablet on the hood of the
          car, and is clicking through a menu, as he talks to Scanlon
          on the phone.

                        many assets to tap into.



            A poorly-lit roadhouse that dates from the days of
            bootleggers.  Betty's tow truck slows to a stop.  Johnny
          and Gibson hop down from the cab.

          The tow truck drives off.

                        We must be in a blackout zone. 

            Suddenly, a voice  --





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT THREE - 1/9/04 - GREEN  45-45A.

                        Hold it right there.

          It's from BEHIND THEM.


          PYNCHON

          Holds a loaded .22 rifle on them.  He recognizes Gibson.

                                        PYNCHON
                        Gibson!  Thank god.
                                (he gives her a hug)
                        I was so worried.  Where's Sylvia?

          Gibson shakes her head.  A moment between them.  Pynchon
          hugs her again.  Then, to Johnny --

                                        PYNCHON
                        Come on inside.



          The Argon SUV PULLS UP.  Adams driving, Coulter with tablet
          computer riding shotgun.

                        Okay, real estate records show
                          Pynchon's grandparents homesteaded
                        some raw land just north of
                          Keyhole.

          The screen suddenly flickers off and on several times,
          before coming back to life.

                                        COULTER
                        Damn satellite link has been dodgy
                        for the past ten miles.  We better
                        tag-up with the home office while
                        we still can -- get the satellite
                        phone.


          NIGHT

          The Argon SUV PARKED at the far end of the lot.

                                        FITCH
                          I dunno, Doug, this place is
                        getting a little too crowded for
                        my taste...

                                        DOUG
                        Tell me about it...


          INSIDE THE CAR

          Roth hands Coulter a large satellite phone.

                                        COULTER
                                (into the phone)
                        Coulter here.



          Coulter, wearing a hat and sunglasses, and carrying an
            umbrella, crosses a busy street.  He bumps into a
            distinguished OLDER GENTLEMAN, but keeps going.  The older
            gentleman takes two more steps and collapses.  Coulter
          looks back, sees this but keeps going.  The vision ends.          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT FOUR - 1/15/04 - BLUE-2  53A.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The man crossing the street.  The
                        one you bumped into.  You did
                          something to him...

                                        COULTER
                                (rattled and in pain)
                        I don't know what you're talking
                        about.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He fell.  You did something to
                        him and he fell.  I recognized
                        him... He's that Senator -- the
                        one who died of a heart attack --
                        but it wasn't a heart attack, was
                        it?

                                        COULTER
                        You're crazy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's what the psychics saw. 
                        You murdered a Senator in cold
                        blood.

                                        COULTER
                        Prove it.

          Coulter almost smiles.  Impressed with Johnny's skill.

                                        COULTER
                        Maybe we can work something out,
                        Mr. Smith.  I'd love to get you
                        on my team.

          Off Johnny, disgusted --
