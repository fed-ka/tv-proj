  giving Grayson the stink eye.  Travis comes down the stairs.

                              JULES
                    Hey, Trav, what are you up to today?  

                                TRAVIS
                    Being the irresponsible teenager I 
                    am, I thought I d spray paint  Who 
                    farted?  on a freeway overpass.

                              JULES
                      (to him as he stomps off)
                    If you really want me to know you re 
                    mad, wear shoes!  Stomping around in 
                    socks is not effective.

                                LAURIE
                    I ve got to hit it.  Smith is taking 
                    me for a fancy pre-Valentine s lunch.

                              ELLIE
                    That s why you re wearing a shirt 
                    that only shows half a nerp.

                                LAURIE
                    It s a pattern, duh.
                      (exiting)
                    Oh, that is a nerp.  I gotta change.

                              JULES
                    What are you and Andy doing for 
                      Valetine s?  

                              ELLIE
                    The usual.  We go to the drugstore, 
                    buy up all the Valentine s cards then 
                    watch the forgetful husbands panic.  
                    Nothing better than a man buying a 
                    Bar Mitzvah card, trying to change 
                    the Star of David into a heart.  

                              GRAYSON
                    You two kids really know how to keep 
                    the romance alive.

                      (then to Grayson)
                    So, any plans for Valentine s Day?

                              GRAYSON
                    Nope.

                              JULES
                    Well, since everyone else is busy, 
                    and being alone would totally suck... 
                    maybe we could do nothing together.  
                    You know, just as friends.  

                              GRAYSON
                    Jules, actually, I don t celebrate 
                      Valentine s Day on principle.  It s a 
                    fake holiday designed to sell cut-
                    rate candy and cuddly teddy bears. 
                    Which, frankly, is irresponsible: 
                    Bears are incredibly dangerous 
                      predators.  We re raising generations 
                    of kids who think they can just 
                    wander into the forest and hug one.  
                    They ll tear your face off, Jules! 

                              JULES
                    Calm down, big guy.  I m just talking 
                    about hanging out together.  No 
                    flowers, no bear talk.  I promise.

                              GRAYSON
                    I guess hanging out would be okay.

                              JULES
                    Great!  But full disclosure, I will 
                    be wearing my red sweater with the 
                    hearts on it.  That s non-negotiable.

                    Hey there, I was noticing you still 
                    have your Christmas lights up, you 
                    know, three months past Christmas.  
                    Here s the thing.  When I m on my 
                      treadmill, they re right out my 
                    window and it s kind of an eyesore.

                              GRAYSON
                    Whatever, I ll take them down.  It s 
                    not a big deal.

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Jules, Laurie and Ellie are there.  Travis comes downstairs. 

                              JULES
                    Happy Valentine s Day, Trav!  FYI, 
                    you didn t have to buy me a gift.  
                    The best gift you ever gave me was a 
                    kiss on the lips when you were five. 

                                TRAVIS
                    That is so not happening.

                              JULES
                      (as Travis exits, calling out)
                    Don t be sure!  I still have a kiss 
                    coupon from when you were little!

  She goes to the drawer and starts digging around.

                                LAURIE
                    I gave my Mom a  kiss  coupon when I 
                    was little.  She re-gifted it to her 
                      boyfriend.  From what I could hear, 
                    she gave him an upgrade.

                              ELLIE
                    Your stories are never surprising. 
                      (then, to Jules)
                    Looks like Travis is still mad at you 
                    for saying no to the party.

                              JULES
                    Yeah.  I just worry about him being 
                    safe... but I guess you always worry 
                    about your kids.  When they re babies 
                    you re afraid they ll hit their soft 
                    spot and go brain dead or stick their 
                    tongue in an outlet and get 
                      electrified.  Then they get a little 
                    older and you worry they ll go blind 
                    looking at an eclipse or fall out of 
                    a tree and impale their head on a 
                    gate.  Then they hit the teen years 
                    and it s sex, drugs, guns, booze, car 
                    racing, boat racing, weird choking 
                    fetishes, shingles... Basically from 
                    the time they cut that bloody cord,

                                LAURIE
                    Is choking really a fetish if you re 
                    just kinda into it? 

                              ELLIE

                              JULES
                    More like an inclination.  You have 
                    an inclination for choking, Laurie.

                    What s Valentine s Day about anyway?  
                    Eating bad chocolate and getting shot 
                    in the heart by some deranged flying 
                    baby?  I don t get it. 

                              JULES
                    I know most people think it s stupid, 
                    but Valentine s is actually my 
                    favorite holiday.  When I was a kid, 
                    my Dad worked every Thanksgiving and 
                    Christmas because he got paid double-
                    time.  But on Valentine s he got 
                    regular pay, so he d call in sick. 
                    Dad would dress up like Santa and 
                    pass out turkey legs.  We basically 
                    jammed every big holiday into that 
                    day.  It was like a giant celebration 
                    of being together as a family.

                              GRAYSON
                    That actually sounds sort of nice.

                              JULES
                    It is.  I ve never spent a 
                      Valentine s Day alone.  That s why 
                    this one will suck.  At least I ve

                    just because you think you ll live to 
                    be a hundred eleven.  So... you think 
                    this will annoy Ellie?

  Bobby and Carol arrive with food bags.

                    Hey, where all the chicken at?
                      (throwing down bags)
                    Whoomp, there it is!

  As the group digs in we ANGLE back on Grayson and Jules.

                              JULES
                    Thank you for this, Grayson. 

  They hug, arm in arm for a moment.  Then, pulling away:

                              GRAYSON
                    Too Valentines-y.

                              JULES
                    Totally.

  Travis approaches Jules.  

                              JULES (CONT D)
                    So, can I get my Valentine s kiss?

                                TRAVIS
                    Don t push it, Mom.

  He puts an arm around her.  As we pull back we hear:

                              JULES
                    Merry Valentine s Day, everyone!

  The group AD-LIBS  Here, here  and we FADE OUT.
