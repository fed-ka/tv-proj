  We re seeing TARA GREGOR from the perspective of a amateur 
  video camera as she switches it on. Tara is an attractive, 
    well-dressed woman in her early 40s, but right now she looks 
  flushed and anxious, like she s ready to jump out of her 
  skin.

  Tara backs away from the camera lens, smoothing her hair, her 
  skirt. She sits down on an overstuffed chair that s been 
  ideally placed for the purpose.

                              TARA
                      (to camera)
                This is Tara, obviously. It s 
                November 12. A Thursday. Looks like 
                I ve got about...
                      (she checks her watch)
                ...four minutes or so. So I just 
                want to explain where I m at right 
                now. While I m still lucid.

  She sighs, looking increasingly uncomfortable.

                              TARA (CONT'D)
                See, I m under a lot of pressure 
                lately. I ve been hired by the 
                mayor s wife to do a 17th century 
                rococo nursery for her unborn son. 
                She wants a gold Diaper Genie and a 
                giant wall fresco depicting herself 
                as a pregnant saint.

                                                                        CUT TO:



  We see Tara on her knees,diligently painting a diaper pail 
  gold. Pan to reveal a lavish Botticelli-style mural of a 
    tacky-looking pregnant blonde wearing flowing robes and a 
  halo.

                              TARA (V.O.)
                This is what I do. I create opulent 
                  environments for women who 
                  hemorrhage money.

  We see the MAYOR S WIFE nodding her approval in the doorway. 
  She sips a chocolate martini and rests it contentedly on her 
  pregnant belly.

  BACK ON TARA (HOME OFFICE):                                                                                  2.



                              TARA (CONT'D)
                      (to camera)
                And I m good at it, too. I rule. I 
                have no problem keeping track of a 
                million things for my clients. But 
                  unfortunately, I can t micromanage 
                my daughter s vagina.

  She reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out a piece 
  of paper. She waves it at the camera in disgust.

                              TARA (CONT'D)
                See this? It s a prescription for 
                  morning-after pills. As in:  the 
                morning after skanky, sweaty teen 
                sex.  I found this in Kate s 
                backpack last night. Now, part of 
                me wants to play  hip mom  and 
                applaud my daughter for being 
                  responsible. The other part of me 
                wants to sew her up. 

  She flings the prescription to the floor.

                              TARA (CONT'D)
                I mean, Kate s always been a very 
                  affectionate kid. Very huggy, got a 
                lot of Valentines in grade school. 
                Maybe I should have seen this 
                  coming...

  She rubs her forehead, clearly on the verge of collapse.

                              TARA (CONT D)
                I just-- I can t deal with this. 
                I m not going to be myself for a 
                while. I m sorry.

  She stands up shakily and turns off the camera.

  Tara removes a tape from the camera, hastily labels it  TARA  
  with a marker and tosses it aside.

  She pulls down her jeans and begins hopping awkwardly down 
  the hallway. Where she s heading, we don t yet know...



  We track through the house, revealing signs of life in the 
  Gregor family. The house is nice enough, but definitely a bit 
  messy. Clean laundry is strewn over the couch and paperwork 
  is scattered across the kitchen island.                                                                                   3.


  The front door swings open and KATE GREGOR, 16, enters. She s 
  wearing a highly stylized Japanese schoolgirl outfit and a 
  Sailor Moon hairstyle. She also has an obvious hicky on her 
  neck.

                              KATE
                Yo! Anybody home? Marshall? 
                Estonian cleaning lady?

  She takes a few steps forward, noting Tara s design binders 
  and carpet samples sitting on the kitchen table.

                              KATE (CONT'D)
                Mommy?

  We see a look cross her face-- is it anxiety or just 
    curiosity?

  Kate s cell phone rings. The ringtone is someone shouting in 
  Japanese. She flips the phone open eagerly.

                              KATE (CONT D)
                      (in an exaggerated baby 
                        voice )
                Hi, kioshii! I miss you too!

  She hops enthusiastically, clearly smitten with the caller.

                              KATE (CONT D)
                Hey, I have the best news. You know 
                my ballet recital? Well, the girl 
                who s playing Swanilde got 
                  hospitalized for anorexia! I m 
                dancing her role tomorrow night! 
                Isn t that great?

  BLAM! A loud noise from upstairs. Kate jumps and her voice 
  suddenly matures.

                              KATE (CONT D)
                Shit, I d better go. Ja nei!

  She hangs up the phone and hurries upstairs.



  Kate walks down the hallway uneasily. From Kate s POV, we see 
  Tara s discarded pants, blouse, and matronly underwear 
  scattered in her path. Kate squeamishly kicks the underwear 
  aside with the toe of her shoe.                                                                                  4.



                              KATE
                      (under her breath)
                Ew. Mom briefs.

  There s a light coming from Kate s room. As she approaches 
  the doorway, she smiles, surprised and delighted.

                              KATE (CONT D)
                T? How d you get out?



  Tara is crouched on the floor, raiding Kate s closet. She 
  throws a shoe at the wall in mock disgust. Trendy clothes are 
  flung all over the room. Tara herself is barely recognizable. 
  She s wearing loads of glittery eye shadow and lip gloss, has 
  her hair pulled into a high side ponytail, and wears ill-
  fitting, overly youthful clothes. 

  Our protagonist isn t Tara anymore. She s Tara s teenage 
  alter ego, T.

  T turns to face the girl she no longer recognizes as a 
  daughter.

                              T
                Dude, I ve been digging around in 
                your closet for an hour and I can t 
                fucking get to Narnia.

  Kate snickers.

  T bends over and sifts through the clothes. A very noticeable 
  fuschia G-string sticks out of the back of her jeans.

                              KATE
                Nice whale tail!

  T wiggles her butt and pulls the jeans down lower.

                              T
                Quit hatin . You wish you had all 
                this!

  Kate walks in and sits on the bed, watching T with amusement.

                              KATE
                What s going on, T? Why are you 
                here instead of Mom?                                                                                  5.



                              T
                Well, your mom s in a bad place, 
                  mentally. Yeah.

                              KATE
                Is it my fault?

                              T
                Kind of. Remember those kill-pills 
                I helped you get at the free 
                clinic? Your mom found the evidence 
                and she s tweakin . 

                              KATE
                Oh, God. No! How did she find it?

                              T
                She probably went CSI on that pubic 
                thatch you call a backpack.

  Kate clutches her furry plush monkey backpack, horrified.

                              KATE
                That bitch!

                              T
                      (sniffing one of Kate s 
                        shoes)
                I know! Can you imagine being so 
                  disrespectful of someone s personal 
                space?

                              KATE
                Hey, are you wearing my new skinny 
                jeans?

                              T
                Don t they make my ass look fine?

                              KATE
                Sure, fine for 40.

                              T
                Don t remind me. Do you know how 
                much it sucks being a teenager 
                stuck in this elderly body. Look--I 
                have a muffin top!

  She pulls up the hem of her shirt to reveal a small roll of 
  flesh over the waistband of the too-small jeans.                                                                                  6.



                              KATE
                Hey, I think Mom looks pretty good 
                for her age.

                              T
                Yeah, maybe. But her clothes look 
                like shit. So do yours, actually. 
                Let s go to Fern Fountain Mall and 
                buy a bunch of new stuff.

                              KATE
                But we don t have any money.

  T pulls out Tara s wallet and flashes some credit cards, a 
  mischievous gleam in her eye.

                              T
                Tara forgot to lock her purse 
                today. We re fully laminated.

                              KATE
                      (thrilled)
                Oh, T! I love you the best of all 
                the alters!

  She lunges to hug T, who flinches in disgust.

                              T
                Drugs, not hugs.

  Kate backs off, chastised. The two of them head out of the 
  bedroom. Kate surreptitiously grabs a tube of lip gloss and 
  applies it hastily.



  T and Kate boisterously head down the stairs, chatting.

                              T
                Anyway, you have to drive because I 
                just smoked a fatty...Hey, 
                  Marshall!



  Tara s son MARSHALL, 14, is sitting at the kitchen island 
  typing on a laptop. He s a well-groomed, extremely organized 
  boy with an aura of Zen benevolence about him.

  T skips into the kitchen and gives Marshall an affectionate 
  noogie.                                                                                   7.



                              T
                Long time, no see!

                              MARSHALL
                      (startled)
                Mom?

                              KATE
                No, you idiot. Mom does not dress 
                like a ho. It s T.

                              MARSHALL
                I can see that now.

  T is already rooting through the refrigerator, pulling out a 
  six-pack of pudding cups. 

                              T
                      (in Bill Cosby voice)
                Jell-o pudding is for the children!

                              KATE
                The vanilla ones are mine, 
                  beeyotch.

                              T 
                Hey Marshall, can you take us to 
                the mall? I m stoned and your 
                sister drives like Billy Joel.

  Kate looks mortified.

                              MARSHALL
                I have to write a paper about 
                George Cukor for Intro to Film. 

  T is transfixed by the pudding. She peels back the lid and 
  stares at it. She sticks a finger in and licks it.

                              T
                Pudding is good...ing!

  She giggles maniacally at the inane rhyme.

                              MARSHALL
                      (gently tolerant)
                It sure is, T.

                              KATE
                Come on, let s get out of here 
                before Dad gets home.                                                                                  8.



                              MARSHALL
                      (looking out the window)
                Too late.

  A shiny pickup truck emblazoned with FOUR WINDS LANDSCAPING 
  has appeared in the driveway. A ruggedly handsome man of 
  about 50 gets out of the driver s seat, struggling with a 
  folder full of paperwork and a big bucket of fried chicken. 
  This is MAX GREGOR, Tara s husband. As he heads up the front 
  walk, his sagging shoulders bear witness to a stressful day.

                              KATE
                Crap.

                              T
                Ugh, here comes Maxi Pad. Look, he 
                has a bucket of fried death!

  Max enters through the back door. 

                              MAX
                      (cheerful)
                Hey guys. Who wants trans fats?

  The kids (and T) pause, waiting for Max to notice the 
    unexpected guest. Max s face falls when he sees T, but he 
  attempts to maintain his composure.

                              MAX (CONT D)
                T. Good to see you!

                              T
                Get fucked.

                              MAX
                Ha! That s probably the nicest 
                thing I ve heard all day. I ve got 
                this subcontractor right now who s 
                a real shithead...

                              MARSHALL
                      (sucking up)
                I like your shirt, Dad.

  Max, who s wearing a T-shirt under a flannel with rolled-up 
  sleeves, looks confused. He pops open the lid of the chicken 
  bucket and places it on the kitchen table before reaching for 
  a stack of plates.

                              T
                Oh by the way, I m a vegetarian 
                now, Max. 
                                (MORE)                                                                                  9.

                                T (CONT'D)
                I don't eat meat, or anything that 
                looks meaty, or anything that's 
                cute. Besides, I read that that 
                place breeds, like, mutant chickens 
                that have four legs and three wings 
                and multiple breasts. And they have 
                no heads, so they can't even eat or 
                cluck. 

  Kate and Marshall look at her incredulously.

                                T (CONT D)
                It s true, you guys. I read it in a 
                MySpace bulletin.

  Max is busily getting out plates and silverware, ignoring T s 
    complaints with the air of someone who s seen a lot worse. 
  The family gathers at the kitchen table.

                              MARSHALL
                You can have all my coleslaw, T.

                              MAX
                Don t coddle her! If she wants to 
                eat with us, she has to cooperate. 
                  Remember, we talked about this.

  T sticks her tongue out at Max and wiggles it between two 
  fingers tauntingly.

                              T
                You re a pussy.

                              MAX
                      (deadpan)
                I m totally offended.

  T glowers and picks up a biscuit. They eat in silence for a 
  few beats before Kate remembers her big news.

                              KATE
                So Dad, I m going to be dancing one 
                of the leads in the recital 
                  tomorrow! It s Swanilde. The part I 
                always wanted.

                              MAX
                What happened to Darcy?

                              KATE
                All she ate was bananas and gum for 
                like, two months. They sent her to 
                St. Marks and put a tube in her 
                stomach.                                                                                10.



                              T
                That s hilarious!

                              MAX
                  Actually, it s a real shame. 

                              KATE
                But Dad, I get to be Swanilde now! 
                God wanted Darcy to lose thirty 
                pounds and get nasty breath and 
                grow little downy fetus hairs all 
                over her torso.

                              MARSHALL
                When did you get so mean?

                              KATE
                It s like a free bonus gift with 
                puberty. You grow boobs and claws.

                              MAX
                Well, I m excited for you, honey. 
                I m sure you ll be amazing.

                              T
                Ballet is boring. I don t know why 
                you even hang out with those 
                  leotards.

  She sarcastically pronounces the  d  in leotards.

                              KATE
                You re just jealous of me  cause 
                you can t even dance.

                              T
                I can freak!

  There s a perfunctory knock on the front door before it 
  swings open. CHARMAINE CRAINE, Tara s older sister, enters 
  without being invited. Her hair and makeup are impeccable, 
  almost overdone, but her clothes are bad, low-cut business 
  casual. There s something desperate about her.

                                CHARMAINE
                  Knock-knock!

                              KATE
                Hi, Aunt Charmaine.

                              MARSHALL
                Hey.                                                                                11.



  T doesn t even acknowledge Charmaine. She slumps down in her 
  seat defiantly and wrinkles her nose.

                              T
                Cougar crossing!

  As Charmaine looks at T and realizes what s up, she frowns. 
  Max appears oddly nervous.

                              MAX
                  Charmaine. To what do we owe this 
                drop-in?

                                CHARMAINE
                      (tense)
                Tara and I were supposed to go to a 
                Pampered Chef party in Richfield, 
                but something tells me my sister 
                isn t home tonight.

                              T
                You re so smart! I can t believe 
                you never finished massage school.

  Kate struggles to stifle her laughter.

                                CHARMAINE
                      (to Max)
                Who is this? I can t even remember 
                what this one is called.

                              MAX
                That s T. Like the letter T, not 
                the hot beverage. 

                              T
                      (without looking up)
                You ve only met me a million times, 
                  Leatherchest.

  Charmaine ignores T and looks at Max, exasperated.

                                CHARMAINE
                Well, I ve obviously walked into 
                the middle of a family crisis. I ll 
                just-- I ll check in later...

                              MARSHALL
                It s not a crisis. We like it when 
                T comes to visit. 

  T winks at him gratefully.                                                                                12.



                                CHARMAINE
                      (her voice breaking)
                Max, may I speak to you for a 
                minute? In private?

                              MAX
                 Course.

  Max gets up and Charmaine hurries behind him, casting a 
  pained glance back at T.



  Max walks into the dimly lit garage. It s one of those 
  classic suburban garages with an old fridge full of beer, a 
  work bench, and bicycles the kids have long since outgrown.

  There s also a dramatically mangled Harley chopper parked 
  near the side of the garage.

  Charmaine click-clacks after Max into the garage, clearly 
    emotional. She pulls a colorful designer Kleenex out of her 
  blazer and begins dabbing at her eyes.

                                CHARMAINE
                Jesus...

                              MAX
                Hey, it s all right, Charmaine. I 
                bet Marshall will go with you 
                tonight. He s been wanting a new 
                deviled egg carrier...

  Charmaine is growing increasingly upset.

                                CHARMAINE
                It s not about that. It s about 
                her. Max, it s just really hard to 
                see my sister that way. I never 
                thought that she would still be 
                like this.

                              MAX
                Tara s really not doing so bad. Dr. 
                Coffee says we need to like, focus 
                on the positive so...

                                CHARMAINE
                        (interrupting)
                Dr. Coffee s her shrink?                                                                                13.



                              MAX
                Oh no, Dr. Coffee s my shrink. 
                Tara s still seeing Dr. Bangs. But 
                they ve made some strides with the 
                  cognitive therapy and...

                                CHARMAINE
                        (histrionic)
                Why can t she just stop?! It s not 
                even a real disease. I ve been 
                doing a lot of reading, on the 
                Internet and it s all just 
                  preposterous...

                              MAX
                Charmie, you know I don t agree.

                                CHARMAINE
                I m sorry. I m just so upset.

                              MAX
                Look, I m not trying to imply that 
                you don t have a right to be angry. 
                You do. We all do. But I ve been 
                living with this for seventeen 
                years, OK? I m married to it. You 
                just take it to Pampered Chef 
                parties.

                                CHARMAINE
                You re right. God, I m sorry you 
                have to live this way, honey. You 
                really deserve so much better.

  She licks her lips. Is she flirting?

                              MAX
                No, I don t.

  Charmaine sighs and goes back into the house. Max watches her 
  with a mixture of longing and pity. He takes a beer out of 
  the refrigerator, cracks it open, and wanders onto the 
  driveway.

  KEN FISHMAN, the Gregors  next-door neighbor, is outside 
  walking his wife s Chihuahua in the twilight. He waves to 
  Max.

                              FISHMAN
                Yo!                                                                                14.



                              MAX
                Look who s back! How was Disney 
                World?

  Fishman heads over, smiling broadly.

                              FISHMAN
                It was sort of like being mugged. 
                  Repeatedly. By a fairy. But we re 
                loving the condo-- well, we love 
                the 1/27th of it that we actually 
                own.

                              MAX
                Oh right, you got the timeshare.

                              FISHMAN
                  Tomorrow s vacations at today s 
                  prices...Holy bartender! What 
                happened to the bike?

  Fishman hot-foots it into Max s garage, shocked by the sight 
  of the mangled Harley.

                              MAX
                Our pal Buck had a little accident 
                a couple of weeks ago. Right after 
                you left.

                              FISHMAN
                You let Buck take your chopper out?

                              MAX
                I didn t  let  Buck anything.

                              FISHMAN
                That guy s becoming a problem. I 
                even told him when we were at the 
                Wet Pony that he needs to cool 
                it...

                              MAX
                      (taken aback)
                When were you at Wet Pony with 
                Buck?

                              FISHMAN
                Aww man, you were working late.

  Max looks appalled.

                              FISHMAN (CONT D)
                Sorry?                                                                                15.



                              MAX
                It s all right. It s just weird.

                              FISHMAN
                God, they love Buck at the Pony. We 
                got comped drinks all night. 
                      (beat)
                Don t tell Maddy, okay? She thinks 
                I was having my floor-mats 
                  shampooed.

  Max glares at Fishman, clearly annoyed by the Wet Pony 
  anecdote.






  T is sacked out on the couch in her PJs watching One Tree 
  Hill and giving herself a pedicure. Max enters the room and 
  watches while T luxuriantly extends one leg into the air, 
  admiring her freshly-polished tootsies.

                              MAX
                Want help?

                              T
                Want sex?

                              MAX
                      (startled)
                Why?

                              T
                It s obvious that s what you want. 
                You have such a boner for me.

                              MAX
                Well, I do happen to be married to 
                the women who usually occupies your 
                body.

                              T
                Tara would get super pissed if we 
                did it.

                              MAX
                Yeah, that s about right.                                                                                16.



                              T
                She thinks I m too young. Which 
                pretty much makes you one of those 
                Dateline predators.

  T caps the bottle of black nail polish, rolls onto her belly 
  and bats her lashes at Max.

                              MAX
                      (gulping)
                T, how long you planning to stay 
                with us this time?

                              T
                Long. I hardly ever get to come 
                out.

                              MAX
                Yeah right! You come out just as 
                often as the other alters.

                              T
                That s not true. Alice gets way 
                more airtime. You guys like her 
                better because she bakes.

                              MAX
                We like you, too. Heck, things 
                around here wouldn t be the same 
                without you. But we have a lot 
                going on this week and the kids 
                need their mom.

  T rolls her eyes, resigned. 

                              T
                You re killing my horny.

                              MAX
                T, I need you to go to the shed. 
                Now. It s nothing personal.

                              T
                I hate you.

  She gets up and stalks out of the room. 

                              MAX
                Take your coat! It s chilly.

  T s departing form gives him the finger.                                                                                17.



  Kate and T cross paths in the den entrance. T rudely 
    bodychecks Kate into the door as she exits. Kate rubs her 
  shoulder, confused. She s wearing her jacket and a scarf.

                              KATE
                Ow. Where s T going?

                              MAX
                Where are you going? 

                              KATE
                  Madison s house. We have a civics 
                project due tomorrow. 

                              MAX
                Are you kidding? It s almost 9.

                              KATE
                  Pretty-please? With rainbow 
                  sprinkles and a baby rhino on top? 
                It s worth 20% of our grade.

                              MAX
                Fine. One hour, no negotiating.

                              KATE
                Where s T going?

                              MAX
                To the shed.

                              KATE
                      (with disappointment)
                Already? Why?

                              MAX
                Because she shouldn t have been out 
                in the first place. Katie, I know 
                what Mom found in your bag, and I m 
                not real happy with you right now.

                              KATE
                        (interrupting)
                Oh, I m sorry! I guess I should 
                have let that fertilized egg 
                implant itself in my uterus.

  Max looks briefly gobsmacked, then regains his composure.

                              MAX
                You re too young to be having it, 
                  responsibly or not. 
                                (MORE)                                                                                18.

                              MAX (CONT'D)
                And you know bad surprises like 
                that are a trigger for Mom.

                              KATE
                  Everything s a trigger lately. I 
                mean, why can t she just take 
                Zoloft like the other moms? I can t 
                be the perfect child all the time 
                just because Mom acts like a bunch 
                of different people when she s 
                stressed out! 

                              MAX
                She s not acting, Katie.

                              KATE
                Aunt Charmaine says she is.

                              MARSHALL
                Aunt Charmaine is a hosebeast.

  Kate and Max turn around. Marshall is standing in the 
  doorway, looking forlorn.

                              MARSHALL (CONT D)
                I saw T going out to the shed. It s 
                like 30 degrees outside. Why can t 
                she just transition in the-- the 
                closet or something?

                              MAX
                I don t know...The shed works?

                              MARSHALL
                Brace yourselves for Thelonius 
                Monk.

  He walks over to the den stereo and cues up a CD. 

                              KATE
                Why do you always do that?

                              MARSHALL
                So they can t hear her. Or judge 
                her.

  Kate rolls her eyes and plugs her ears.



                              MARSHALL
                      (shouting)
                I hope Mom s okay.

  Max cracks open his third beer of the night.

                              MAX
                She s fine. 
                (beat)
                She says it s painless. 



  Max is showering, lathering himself up with a Soap-on-a-Rope 
  that he wears around his neck. He squirts some Rogaine into 
  his palm and shampoos his head vigorously, almost 
    obsessively.

  Suddenly, the shower door slides open and a disheveled TARA 
  steps in. Her nose is red from the cold, her hair is matted 
  and her makeup--T s makeup--is running.

  For a second, Max isn t sure who he s dealing with.

                              MAX
                      (startled)
                Tara?...

  Tara nods mutely. She splashes some hot water on her face, 
  then leans against Max, exhausted. He folds her into his 
  embrace with a concerned expression.

                              MAX (CONT D)
                Welcome back.                                                                                20.





  Kate shivers on a street corner, checking her watch. She pops 
  a breath mint and huddles into her down vest. 

  A pair of headlights illuminate her face and she smiles. It s 
  her boyfriend, BENJAMIN LAMBERT, pulling up in a souped-up 
  Honda. He wears Goth clothes and looks a little too old for 
  Kate. He rolls down the window.

                              KATE
                You re a little late, babe.

                              BENJAMIN
                Me and Trevor were working on our 
                Rurouni Kenshin costumes for 
                TokyoCon.
                      (sizing her up)
                You re looking very kawaii tonight, 
                  Katie-chan.

                              KATE
                Thanks.

  She climbs into the front seat. Benjamin puts the car in park 
  and drapes his arm around Kate, practically suffocating her.

                              BENJAMIN
                So why didn t you text me back 
                earlier?

                              KATE
                Oh. Um, things were kind of freaky 
                at home. You know how I was telling 
                you about my mom, and how she has 
                multiple personalities?

  Benjamin nods, dubious.

                              KATE (CONT D)
                Well, she transitioned. One of her 
                  alters--her personalities--is like 
                my age. She s calls herself T. 
                She s a total burnout, but we get 
                to do whatever we want.

                              BENJAMIN
                      (disgusted)
                So your mom actually goes around 
                acting like she s a teenager?                                                                                21.



                              KATE
                Well, she doesn t really  go 
                around.  We try to keep her inside 
                when it happens. And she s not 
                always a teenager. Sometimes she s 
                other people.

                              BENJAMIN
                That is so messed up.

                              KATE
                It s not that big of a deal. It s 
                just like when we pretend to be 
                Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask!

                              BENJAMIN
                No, it s not.

                              KATE
                  Well...your mom has implants.

                              BENJAMIN
                That s different. 

                              KATE
                It s kind of slutty.

                              BENJAMIN
                      (defensive)
                She got them for her.

                              KATE
                Anyway, you don t have to worry 
                about me. Everything s fine.

                              BENJAMIN
                Just don t ignore a text from me 
                again, okay? 

  He looks pissed and slightly aggressive.

                              KATE
                I won t.

                              BENJAMIN
                Arigato.

  Benjamin turns on the car stereo. It s loud, obnoxious 
  Japanese pop. The car roars off into the night.                                                                                22.





  Marshall is lying on his bed, reading a well-worn copy of 
  Sibyl and drinking a cup of tea. He wears a robe over 
  matching pajamas and looks very tidy and debonair.  Kind of 
  Blue  plays softly on the stereo.

  There s a knock on the door, and a freshly-showered Tara 
  enters, looking contrite. Marshall discreetly pushes the book 
  off the opposite side of his bed, as if hiding porn.

                              TARA
                Hey, Marshmallow.

                              MARSHALL
                      (relieved)
                Hi, Mom.

  Tara walks in and sits down on the bed in the grand tradition 
  of concerned mothers everywhere.

                              TARA
                Listen, I m sorry about tonight. 
                That was wacky, huh? 

                              MAX
                It was no big whoop. 

                              TARA
                How bad was she? T, I mean.

                              MAX
                She wasn t that bad. She was only 
                here for a few hours. Did you know 
                she s a vegetarian now?

  Tara shakes her head and begins coughing suddenly. It s a 
  dry, hacking smoker s cough.

                              TARA
                Am I high?

                              MAX
                Maybe a little bit.

                              TARA
                Where does she even get that crap? 
                Who deals pot in the suburbs?

  Max shrugs.                                                                                23.



                              TARA (CONT D)
                Listen, I want to thank you for 
                being such a strong, supportive 
                kid. I m lucky.

                              MARSHALL
                We re lucky, Mom. Because of you, 
                we get to be interesting.

                              TARA
                Do you like being interesting?

                              MARSHALL
                        (whispering)
                I love it!

  Tara smiles.

                              TARA
                Well, I m bushed. I d better hit 
                the sack.

  She gets up and starts to head toward the door.

                              MARSHALL
                Hey Mom? Why do you-- I mean, why 
                do they have to go to the shed to 
                bring you back?

                              TARA
                I ll tell you when you re old 
                enough to not be traumatized.

                              MARSHALL
                Oh. Okay.

                              TARA
                        (cheerfully)
                   Nighty-night, Marsh.

  She walks out of the room. Marshall still looks comically 
  traumatized despite her effort to put him at ease.



  Tara enters, kicking off her slippers. Max is already in bed, 
  watching The Tonight Show. 

                              TARA
                      (climbing into bed)
                Who s on tonight?                                                                                24.



                              MAX
                      (wearily)
                I have no idea.

                              TARA
                Hey honey?

                              MAX
                Mm-hm?

                              TARA
                I can t do this anymore.

                              MAX
                I know he s not funny, but the 
                   Headlines  are still good.

                              TARA
                No, not Leno. Me. 
                      (beat)
                I m tapped out. It didn t used to 
                drain me like this. And now it 
                seems like it s happening more and 
                more. I can t even imagine what you 
                guys are going through...

                              MAX
                      (stilted)
                It s fine. It s just part of who 
                you are, and we embrace it.

  Tara turns to look at him in disbelief.

                              TARA
                Dr. Coffee s really been blowing 
                sunshine up your ass, huh?

                              MAX
                  Actually, I take my sunshine 
                orally. Point-five milligrams, 
                twice a day. And also I drink a lot 
                of beer.

  Tara laughs wryly.

                              MAX (CONT D)
                  Seriously, though. I want you to be 
                happy.

                              TARA
                I know. That s why I love you.                                                                                25.



  Max moves closer to her, stroking her arm as if to make a 
  romantic overture.

                              MAX
                Hey, you should put that little 
                pink thong thing back on.

                              TARA
                      (abruptly)
                T s g-string?

                              MAX
                  Yeah...I m kidding.

                              TARA
                No, you re not.

                              MAX
                It looked good on you.

                              TARA
                It looked good on her.

  Max looks pained and confused. Tara rolls over and fusses 
  with her pillow.

                              TARA (CONT D)
                I d better get to sleep. I ve got a 
                  consultation at 8:00 tomorrow.

                              MAX
                Oh, that s right. Peg wants you to 
                turn that money-pit into a  woman-
                  positive  B&B.

                              TARA
                I don t like to take on friends as 
                clients, but at least she s paying 
                me. Plus, her taste is so wretched 
                that I consider this a public 
                service.

  Max touches her arm affectionately.

                              MAX
                She s lucky she s getting the best.

                              TARA
                Thanks. I m excited.

  She gives him a perfunctory kiss, rolls over and closes her 
  eyes. Max stares at her lustfully.                                                                                26.





  We see the bedroom from Tara s perspective as she opens her 
  eyes. The first thing we/she sees are her feet, which are 
  sticking out from the blankets. The toenails are painted jet 
  black-- T s doing.

  Tara sighs and examines her fingernails. Also black. She gets 
  out of bed, resigned.



  Tara drives to a client s house. On the radio, two shock 
  jocks are having a conversation. 

                              DJ #1
                I don t know about you, but 
                  personally, I love crazy girls.

                              DJ #2
                Oh yeah. The crazy ones are 
                absolute freaks in bed. 

                              DJ #1
                I dated a compulsive handwasher 
                once. She wore gloves during sex.

                              DJ #2
                Did you fantasize it was Minnie 
                Mouse? I would have fantasized it 
                was Minnie Mouse grabbing my ass.

                              DJ #1
                You re sick...

  Tara shuts off the radio and continues to drive, calmly 
  stoic.



  Tara is walking through a Victorian mansion, taking copious 
  notes as she trails PEG RILEY, a friendly acquaintance of 
  hers. Peg is also in her 40s but looks more eccentric and 
  quirky than Tara-- the hippie/divorcee type.

                              TARA

                So, you want the front parlor to be 
                full of...Victorian teddy bears, 
                correct?                                                                                27.



                              PEG
                Right. Teddies, dollies, bunnies-- 
                if it shits fluff, I want it. OK, 
                this is the solarium. I m thinking 
                about doing a day-spa thing in 
                here. Maybe I ll even offer Botox 
                  injections.

                              TARA
                I think you need to be licensed to 
                do that, Peg. 

                              PEG
                God, this country is so regimented! 
                Why can t we be more fun-positive, 
                like the Mexicans? I went down to 
                Nogales last winter. Went to the 
                market, got Xanax, Wellbutrin, and 
                  a darling purse for Tiffany.

  Tara smiles stiffly.

                Speaking of which, Tiff told me 
                that your Katie is dancing one of 
                the leads at the recital tonight.

                              TARA

                  Tiffany s not that psyched, but

                              TARA
                Sure. It s a great space. Lots of 
                good light. It s got gingerbread 
                appeal.

                My condition.

                like some fun new character. It s

  Tara approaches the local high school, Fern Fountain High. 
  Classes have just been dismissed, and disaffected teens are 
  milling about the small campus.                                                                                30.



  Near the street, under a bare oak, Kate and her boyfriend 
  Benjamin are engaged in what appears to be a heated 
  discussion. Benjamin wears his hair in a bizarre anime-
  inspired style.

  Tara slows down the car discreetly and cranes her neck to 
  watch them. Benjamin is sniping at Kate about something, and 
  Kate looks as though she s defending herself.

  Benjamin puts his hands on Kate s shoulders and pins her 
  firmly against the tree, shouting at her.

  Something snaps in Tara at this instant. Her eyes narrow, her 
  nostrils flare-- like any mother, she can t stand to see that 
  punk putting his hands on Kate. She screeches to a halt and 
  pulls over, rolling down the window.

                              TARA
                Kate Michelle Gregor, I did not 
                raise you to let boys who wear 
                pigtails push you around.

                              BENJAMIN
                These are samurai knots!

                              TARA
                Shut up.

                              KATE
                      (through tears)
                Mom, we re fine.

  She walks over to the car, opens the back door and snatches 
  up the garment bag containing her costume.

                              TARA
                We? Honey, this Power Puff Boy does 
                not warrant a collective pronoun. 
                Get in the car now.

                              KATE
                No.

                              TARA
                Now, Kate!

                              BENJAMIN
                      (to Kate)
                Is this the bitch character or 
                something? Make her turn it off.                                                                                31.



                              KATE
                      (tearful)
                Ben...

  Tara gazes at her daughter with a mixture of pity and 
  sadness. She s obviously coming unhinged. Kate starts toward 
  the car almost imperceptibly, but Tara s Nine West-shod foot 
  slams on the gas, almost against her will. She speeds off.



  Tara reaches, fumbling, into the glove compartment as the car 
  veers and weaves down the street toward her house. She 
  manages to retrieve a pair of black  shop teacher  glasses 
  and a pack of unfiltered smokes.

  She puts the glasses on, squinting, and gropes for a 
    cigarette. Meanwhile, the car is going 40 in a 25.



  Marshall is standing in the kitchen, grating some orange zest 
  into a mixing bowl. Two muffin tins are sitting out. Tara 
  storms into the house and blows past Marshall.

                              MARSHALL
                Mom? I m making some Muffins of 
                Triumph for Kate. 

  Tara grunts, already on her way upstairs.

                              MARSHALL (CONT D)
                      (feebly)

                Oh shit.



    A stressed-out Kate navigates the serpentine backstage 
  corridors of an old theater. She carries her costume. The 
  backstage area is bustling with dancers. A beautiful, prim-
  looking girl in a tutu and ballet slippers trots past Kate 
  and waves. Kate smiles in recognition.

                                BALLERINA
                Hey, bitch!

                              KATE
                What s up, slutwaffle?


  They grin at each other cheerfully and wave. We follow Kate 
  into a dressing room as she opens her dance bag and begins to 
  get ready...

                                                                    CROSS CUT:



  Tara is in her room, buttoning up a man s lumberjack-style 
  flannel shirt. Her glasses slide down the sweaty bridge of 
  her nose. Occasionally, she stops and clutches her temples. 
  The act of transformation--whether or not we believe it--is 
  obviously physically grueling for her.



  Kate pulls up the shoulders of her leotard, discreetly 
  tucking in her bra straps.



  Tara ties her hair into a ponytail and smooshes it under a 
  foam trucker cap that says  LADY KILLER. 



  Kate skims her hair back into a bun and begins fastening it 
  with bobby pins.                                                                                33.





  Tara puts on a pair of men s battered work boots, the soles 
  caked with schmutz.



  Kate laces up her immaculate satin ballet slippers.



  Max enters, holding a bouquet of roses and baby s breath 
  wrapped in green florist s paper. Marshall is taking the 
  muffins out of the oven to cool. Max acknowledges his son 
  proudly.

                              MAX
                      (pleased)

                She s a good kid. Right?

                              MARSHALL
                Sure. She s awesome.

  Max sits down comfortably at the kitchen table.

                              MAX 
                You know, it s too bad Alice 
                couldn t be here for Kate s 
                recital. She loves crap like this. 
                In fact, I don t think she s been 
                to anything extracurricular since 
                you made Eagle Scout.

                              MARSHALL
                Alice hardly comes out anymore.

                              MAX
                I know. I miss her corn bread. 
                Speaking of which, where s Mom?                                                                                34.



                              MARSHALL 
                Well, I m not sure if Mom s here. I 
                mean, Mom s here, but I don t know 
                if Mom s here. If you get my 
                meaning.

                              MAX
                What, did T come back?

                              MARSHALL
                I don t think so.

                              MAX
                You re not talking about...

                              BUCK
                Buck?

  Tara has appeared at the top of the stairs in her manly-
  dirtball regalia and glasses. Lighting another cigarette, she 
  sneers at Marshall and Max. She s become BUCK, her troubled, 
    contentious, shit-kicking macho male alter-ego.

                              MAX
                      (startled)
                Buck, don t smoke in here.

                              BUCK
                      (in a low, gravelly drawl)
                I only smoke when I party.

                              MAX
                This isn t a party.

                              BUCK
                Says you.

  Buck stomps into the kitchen and looks disdainfully at 
    Marshall s muffins cooling on the counter. Marshall looks 
  away, dreading Buck s reaction.

                              BUCK (CONT D)
                Hm. Looks like Femeril here s been 
                bakin  up a storm. 

                              MAX
                      (sternly)
                Those are for Kate s recital. And 
                it s very important to her and to 
                us that it goes smoothly, so you re 
                staying right here.                                                                                35.



                              BUCK
                Ballet, huh? I wanna see what 
                Katie s friends look like in 
                tights.

                              MAX
                You could go bowling. Hey, maybe 
                there s a cockfight downtown!

                              BUCK
                I bet some of those girls got asses 
                like little nectarines.

                              MARSHALL
                      (sullenly)
                Shut up, Buck.

                              BUCK
                Hey, Twinkie the Kid, there might 
                be some boys for you to look at 
                too!

  Max pulls out his cell phone and pushes a speed-dial button, 
  never taking his eyes off Buck. 

                              BUCK (CONT D)
                Who you calling?

                              MAX
                Dr. Bangs.

                              MARSHALL
                Dr. Bangs is at a self-mutilation 
                  conference in Tampa.

                              MAX
                He- he is?

                              BUCK
                Dumbass teenagers cutting 
                  themselves up. They want pain so 
                damn much, they oughta call me!

  Max hangs up the phone, reaches into his pocket and pulls out 
  his wallet, desperate to thwart Buck s plan.

                              MAX
                Here. Fifty bucks. Go to the dog 
                track in Billings.
                      (quietly)
                Put five on Gigolo Foxtrot for me.                                                                                36.



  Buck snatches up the bill.

                              BUCK
                No doggies tonight. It s colder 
                than a witch s tit.

                              MAX
                      (desperate)
                I ll give you $50 more to go to the 
                shed. And don t think I m afraid of 
                you. This is for Katie.

                              BUCK
                Hell no! You know I get a 48-hour 
                  furlough, standard. I m not going 
                to that shed until I get my ya-yas 
                out. 

  Max opens his wallet and fans out some cash.

                              MAX
                Two bills to skip the recital. I 
                don t care what you do with it.

  Buck considers the deal, then snatches up the money. He 
  mashes his cigarette out on the table and saunters out of the 
  room.

                              MARSHALL
                Kate s gonna be mad that Mom s not 
                there tonight.

  Max is clearly dejected.

                              MAX
                      (gesturing to muffins)
                Just wrap up those M.O.Ts and we ll 
                go. Okay?

  Marshall obligingly unfurls a roll of pink Saran Wrap.



  Marshall and Max have found their seats in the small but 
  ornate old theatre, which is nearly packed with family 
  members and spectators. Max has the expectant look of a proud 
  parent. Marshall rifles through the program.

  The lights flicker, indicating that the program is about to 
  start. As the house lights begin to dim, a general ruckus can 
  be heard a few rows back:  Move over, ya prick!   Let me in!                                                                                 37.



  Max and Marshall instinctively turn around. Buck is trying to 
  elbow his way into one of the back rows.

                              MAX
                Buck, what are you doing here?

                              BUCK
                Can t a dude change his goddamned 
                mind? Anyway this bitch won t let 
                me in.

                              WOMAN
                I m in a wheelchair!

                              BUCK
                You wanna get rowdy? You wanna get 
                  buck-wild? I ll Chuck Heston your 
                ass into an electric wheelchair!

  Max has already sprung out of his seat. He ushers Buck down 
  to their row, apologizing. People in the audience titter and 
  whisper. Marshall looks around, sadly aware that people are 
  making fun of his mom.

                              MAX
                Sorry, everyone. He...she s not 
                feeling well. It s hormonal.

  FISHMAN is sitting two rows back with his tarty wife MADDY. 
  He notices Buck and brightens.

                              FISHMAN
                Hey, Buck! Buck! Where you been?

                              BUCK
                Prison, man! Gimme a ring one of 
                these days. We ll go to the 
                  strippers again.

                              FISHMAN
                      (happily)
                Okay!

  Fishman s wife looks pissed.

  Max finagles a seat for Buck in their row. Buck settles in, 
  spreads his legs and scratches himself. Marshall protectively 
  clutches the Muffins of Triumph, scooting away from Buck.

  The orchestra begins to play. Kate tiptoes onto the stage and 
  begins to dance. Her stage makeup is grotesquely overdone and 
  her moves are overdramatic and awkward. Still, she looks 
  thrilled to be in the spotlight.                                                                                38.



  Buck snorts and lights a cigarette, which is quickly snatched 
  away by Max.

  Time passes...



  The ballet continues. Kate is twirling all over the stage, 
  wearing a cheesy open-mouthed grin. Suddenly, Buck looks 
  captivated, almost misty-eyed. Marshall notices.

                              MARSHALL
                        (whispering)
                You re enjoying this.

                              BUCK
                Shut up, faggot!

  He whacks Marshall upside the head. Nearby audience members 
  murmur in disapproval. Max simmers.

  The number ends and a glowing Kate does a ballet curtsey. 
  Buck stands up, clapping heartily and whistling. Kate sees 
  him and freezes briefly, but her expression of alarm quickly 
  turns into a smile.

  Two rows in front of the Buck, Kate s jerky boyfriend 
  BENJAMIN turns around to see who Kate s looking at. Benjamin 
  and Buck lock eyes. Buck s face darkens with recognition. He 
  makes a menacing throat-slitting gesture at Benjamin as the 
  crowd rises to its feet.



  Buck, Marshall, and Max are backstage greeting Kate. Kate s 
  arms are full of flowers and she s ecstatic.

                              KATE
                Did you see my grand jete? It was 
                huge! And I ve never done a quad 
                pirouette in front of real people 
                before! Just you guys.

                              MAX
                We saw everything. You looked 
                amazing.

  PEG RILEY and her daughter TIFFANY (who is dressed like a 
  tree) walk past, chatting excitedly.                                                                                 39.



                              PEG
                      (waving)
                Hello, Gregors! Sorry we re in a 
                rush...

                              TIFFANY
                Hey Kate, great job.

  Buck reaches out and casually grabs Tiffany s butt as they 
  pass by. She lets out a little shriek of surprise.

                              TIFFANY (CONT D)
                      (to Kate)
                Your mom is so funny!

  Marshall ceremoniously hands Kate the tray of muffins.

                              MARSHALL
                These Muffins of Triumph have never 
                been more well-deserved.

                              KATE
                Ooh, I gotta share these. Buck, you 
                want a muffin? Buck? Dad, where s 
                Buck?

  Max s expression is one of quiet, weary panic.



    A monogrammed  Buck  ball rolls down a lane and knocks out 
  the center pins.

                              BUCK
                      (shaking his head)
                Snake eyes!

  The Gregor family sits at the end of the lane, eating Muffins 
  of Triumph and sharing pitchers of beer (Max) and soda (the 
  kids). Kate hasn t washed off her stage makeup and looks 
  ghoulish. Buck has a spectacular black eye, but otherwise 
  appears to be in good spirits. He wears a bowling glove and 
  flexes his hand.

                              BUCK (CONT D)
                It s been too long. I m rusty.

  Fishman is in the next lane, gearing up for a roll. His wife 
  and young daughter linger near him, bored.                                                                                41.



                              FISHMAN
                Excuses, excuses. Prepare to be 
                  schooled.

  Fishman rolls a lousy frame.

                              BUCK
                That school got a short bus?

  Kate watches, amused, from the sidelines. Buck gets up to 
  bowl again, but Kate grabs him by the elbow and stops him.

                              KATE
                Hey, thanks for coming to my 
                recital. But next time I want Mom. 
                Or Alice. No offense, Buck.

                              BUCK
                None taken. I get bored by that 
                bunhead shit anyhow.

                              KATE
                And thanks for defending my honor. 
                  Benjamin s such a freak. I can t 
                believe he hit you.

                              BUCK
                Why? I m able-bodied. Besides, you 
                should thank Marsha. He got right 
                in there and kicked like a Pussycat 
                Doll.

  Marshall shrugs, embarrassed. He s holding a bag of frozen 
  peas to his shin.

                              MAX
                We re all looking out for you, 
                Kate. All us guys.

                              KATE
                Believe me, I know.

                              BUCK
                And keep it in your pants from now 
                on, hear? You don t wanna be making 
                any babies until you re 16 and can 
                support  em.

  Max grimaces slightly at this  advice. 

  Buck rises and picks up his signature ball, tapping the ball-
  return for good luck.                                                                                 42.



                              BUCK (CONT D)
                Get over here, Marshall. I ll show 
                you how to pick up a 7-9 split.

  Marshall gets up to share a rare bonding moment with Buck.

                              KATE
                      (to Max)
                It s weird how Buck is a lefty. You 
                know,  cause none of the other 
                alters are?

                              MAX
                      (distant)
                That s one weird thing, yes.

  Kate and Max exchange wry smiles.



  We pan across the office to reveal a shelving unit full of 
  TAPES. Some are labeled  TARA,  some are labeled  T,  some 
  are labeled  BUCK,  some are labeled  ALICE  (in flowery 
  cursive) and a much-smaller portion are labeled with entirely 
    unfamiliar names.

  Tara enters, turns on the video camera we recall from the 
  first scene and settles into the  confessional chair.  Her 
  black eye has faded somewhat, implying that a few days have 
  passed.

                              TARA
                It s me, Tara. November 15th. Buck 
                was apparently here for a couple of 
                days. Luckily it was a weekend, but 
                Max said it was pretty rough.


  The sound of a door opening. Kate enters the frame wearing 
  fox ears and a furry tail with her Japanese-inspired outfit.

                              TARA (CONT D)
                I m taping, honey.

                              KATE
                I need my laptop to do a report.

  She passes in front of the camera briefly. 

                              TARA
                Need a ride to the library?                                                                                43.



                              KATE
                      (off camera)
                Nah, I ll just make shit up.



  Tara waits a few beats. Kate steps into frame again, makes a 
  face at the camera and leaves.

                              TARA
                Anyway, right now I m feeling 
                massive amount of guilt. Fear, 
                even. Two transitions in two days-- 
                I mean, the last time that happened 
                was when Marshall broke his 
                tailbone figure skating. I had an 
                excuse then. Now anything can set 
                me off. Like, the Fishman s are 
                having their Solstice Pig Roast 
                next week and I m already afraid 
                that something will happen. I m 
                setting myself up for a freak-out.

  She leans in, serious.

                              TARA (CONT D)
                  I honestly thought life would be 
                easier when the kids got older and 
                Max and I had been married forever. 
                But it s not. The more time passes, 
                the more I forget who I am. And 
                then it s easier to be them. 

  There s another knock at the door.

                              MAX
                      (from behind the door)
                Tara? We need you for a second.

                              TARA
                      (to camera)
                Here s looking at you.

  She winks with her bruised eye and shuts off the camera.
