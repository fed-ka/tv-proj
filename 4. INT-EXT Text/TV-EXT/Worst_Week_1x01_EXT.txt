      Sam s standing on the curb, talking into his cell.

                                  SAM
                    Mel, you re not picking up your 
                    cell.  What you heard back there, 
                    it was really nothing.  Someone 
                    walking around with mistletoe.  How 
                    desperate do you have to be, right?  
                    I should tell Adam to try it. 
                    Anyway, I m on my way.  Can t wait 
                    to dig into your mom s cherry pie.
                          (then)
                    And that sounded dirty.  Love you. 

      He hangs up.  A sports car comes tearing toward him, brakes 
      squealing as it SLAMS into the curb.  The window rolls down 
      to reveal Nicky, the drunk girl, in the drivers  seat.        "Worst Week"                                           10.


                                  NICKY
                    Hi, Sam.

                                  SAM
                    Oh, hey, Nicky.  Nicky, are you 
                    sure you should be driving?

                                  NICKY
                    Are you kidding?  This car 
                    basically drives itself.

      She GUNS it and slams into a street sign.  Sam looks around 
      to see if anyone else can deal with this, but there s no one.

                                  SAM
                          (to himself)
                    Dammit.



      Sam HELPS Nicky into a cab. 

                                  SAM
                          (to cabbie)
                    We re going to Bethesda.



      A dark quiet neighborhood.  Nicky s lying passed out on the 
      grass outside the cab.  Sam COMES AROUND the other side of 
      the car, his entire front side covered with vomit.  The 
      CABBIE is leaning into the back seat.  He COMES OUT, furious.

                                  CABBIE
                    I am known the world over for the 
                      cleanliness of my cab, and now 
                    this!  Stupid American holiday 
                    parties.

      And with that he JUMPS into his cab and SPEEDS off.  Sam 
      TURNS to the PASSED OUT Nicky, looks at his watch.  Shit.  He 
      pulls out his cell phone, dials.



      Sam waits for Mel to answer the phone.

                                  SAM
                    C mon, c mon.  Pick up.  Pick up!

      Nicky lets out a little MOAN.  Sam slams the cell shut.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                          (to Nicky)
                    Do you think you can make it the 
                    rest of the way on your own?

      Nicky lifts her head off the ground, looks around weakly, and 
      PLOPS her head back onto the dirt, out cold.



      Sam is TRUDGING up hill with Nicky thrown over his shoulder.  
      It starts to RAIN.



      Sam has thrown Nicky in a trash can and is WHEELING her up to 
      her front stoop.  She sleeps peacefully.



      Sam is pushed out, wet and buck naked.  He tries to hold the 
      door open, but it is forced shut.  Then, he hears:        "Worst Week"                                           14.


                                  VOICES (O.S.)
                          (singing)
                    Good King Wenceslas looked out on 
                    the feast of Steven...

      Sam turns to see a group of YOUNG CAROLERS.  He covers up.

                                  SAM
                    Hi.  Merry Christmas.
                          (then, trying the locked 
                            door, loud whisper)
                    Nicky, open the door!  I wasn t 
                    trying to have sex with you!

                                  NICKY (V.O.)
                    I m dialing 9-1-1.

      Sam turns back to the carolers.

                                  SAM
                      Um...could I borrow some clothes?

      The carolers HURRY OFF.  Nicky s porch light goes out.  Sam 
      looks around, then heads over to a TRASH CAN.



      A cab, lights on, sits idling in the large circular driveway.  
      Sam, IN A DIAPER MADE FROM A TRASH BAG, is THROWING PEBBLES 
      at Mel s bedroom window.

                                  SAM
                          (loud whisper)
                      Mel...Mel!...Mel!!!

      Sam THROWS one more pebble.  Suddenly:

      SFX: A dog barking madly.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                          (Newman!)
                    Texaco!

      And all the LIGHTS GO ON IN THE HOUSE.  Sam hangs his head 
      and goes to the door.  Dick OPENS the door in his bathrobe.        "Worst Week"                                           15.


                                  DICK
                    Sam?

                                  SAM
                          (cheery)
                    Hello, Dick.  Merry Christmas.  
                    Hope I didn t wake you.

                                  DICK
                    It s two in the morning.

                                  ANGELA (V.O.)
                    Dick, who is it?

                                  DICK
                          (calling)
                    It s Mel s friend, Sam.  In a giant 
                    plastic diaper.

                                  SAM
                          (re: bag)
                    Oh, this old thing, funny story--

      SFX: Car horn.

      Sam looks back at the cab.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    Dick, could I borrow eighty 
                    dollars?  It s for the cab.  My 
                    wallet s in my...other pants.

      Dick, annoyed, goes off to get the money.  Sam steps inside.



      Dick STROLLS along the sidewalk of this small quaint town 
      PAST A SIGN POINTING TO THE TRAIN STATION.  He suddenly looks 
      a little shaky.  He puts his hand to his head, then against a 
      wall to brace himself.  He tries to shake it off, but his 
      knees go wobbly and he FALLS to the ground.  His glasses fall 
      a few feet away.  Camera PANS up to a sign on the shop he s 
      fallen in front of.  It reads: HEWITT S FUNERAL HOME.



      Sam HURRIES outside, JUMPS into the car, and SPEEDS out of 
      the driveway.  He goes about twenty feet then sees something 
      and SLAMS on the brakes, too late.

      SFX: CAR CRASH.        "Worst Week"                                           32.


      The screen goes BLACK for a second.  We come back up on Dick 
      SLUMPED over the steering wheel, passed out, smoke from his 
      radiator billowing up around him.

      Sam gets out of his car and comes around to inspect the 
      damage.  The bumpers are mangled.  Then he comes around to 
      the driver s side and sees:

                                  SAM
                    Dick!
                          (then,, overjoyed)
                    Dick, you re alive.  You re alive!
