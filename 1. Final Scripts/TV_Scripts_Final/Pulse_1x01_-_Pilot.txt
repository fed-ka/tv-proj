      INT. OPERATING THEATRE - DAY 1 (PRE-TITLES)11

      We re in the middle of what looks like an everyday 
      transplant operation.  Masked surgeons, the rise and fall 
    of breathing, a patient... we see the face of an elderly 
      man, CHARLES MADDOX, under an oxygen mask.  

      Handsome young surgeon NICK (early 30s) is in charge, 
      looking tense.

                                  NICK
                    We'll proceed with the re-section. 
                    Today, please, everyone.

    He starts to cut.  He has to heft at what he s doing. 

    The strain on his face.  He s going too fast, being too 
      hasty.  Something s about to give... 

    He cuts himself.

    He looks at his left hand: a tiny gash through his glove.  

      A nurse looks across. He waves away help.  

                                  NICK
                    I m fine.

    He wipes the blood away.

                                  NICK
                    It s out.  Remove it, please. 

      Other members of the surgical team move in, lift out 
      something that we don t quite see.

    He goes to change gloves.

      Unseen by everyone, MADDOX S finger... twitches.  His hand 
      starts to flex... 

                                  NICK
                    Ready with the transplant.

    The Theatre Nurse places a metal medical box beside NICK 
    and opens it.

    But MADDOX S eyes are flickering open. 

    And nobody s noticed.

      NICK reaches into the box. 

      MADDOX wrenches himself upright, awake!

    But the medical staff don't blink. NICK's reaction is one 
    of wearied frustration.                                                                                     2.


                                  NICK
                    Not again.

      MADDOX looks down at his open torso, in horror and 
      disbelief.

                                  NICK
                    You ll forget all this, Mr. 
                    Maddox. You always do.

      NICK reaches into the box and takes out something we don t 
      see. MADDOX looks horrified at it.  

                                  NICK
                    Now please, we are working. 

    We see from MADDOX S point of view as NICK raises the dark 
      thing he s holding in his hand ... and gently lowers it 
      into MADDOX's torso.

      MADDOX gurgles a terrified scream into the mask.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      INT. PUB - NIGHT 222

      A medics  pub.  We enter with NICK, the surgeon from the *
      pre-titles. At the bar ADAM, a senior house officer,spots *
    him and beckons.*

                                  ADAM*
                    Nick!*

      Later. They have drinks and ADAM is eyeing up the talent.*

                                  ADAM
                    So which one is she?*

                                  NICK*
                    End of the bar. 

      Where stands STELLA, early 20s, gorgeous and new here, 
      chatting away to JESS, early 20s, a touch ditzy and RAFEE, 
      early 20s slacker.

                                  ADAM
                    Not bad. (BEAT. LEADING) Though 
                    Hannah's looking surprisingly perky 
                    -

    The camera picks out HANNAH (early/mid 20s) whosits alone *
      across the pub.*                                                                                    3.


                                  NICK
                    No chance. Hannah s like the war 
                    in Iraq.  A huge investment in *
                    time and energy.  You go in 
                    expecting a quick victory, but 
                    years later...

                                  ADAM
                    You re still involved.  

      NICK laughs dismissively as ADAM heads towards her.*

                                  ADAM*
                    Somebody should say hello!*

      STELLA s talking to JESS and RAFEE. They re also looking *
      over at HANNAH.

                                  STELLA
                    Apparently she went totally 
                    mental. 

                                  RAFEE
                    Right in the middle of an*
                    operation. They had to drag her 
                    out and sedate her. (TO JESS) 
                    Blood everywhere ...

                                  JESS
                    Rafee! Don't!

                                  RAFEE 
                    How did you make it this far, 
                    Jess?

                                  JESS
                    We didn't have to cut into real 
                    people before.

      STELLA spots NICK at the bar and flashes a smile which he *
      acknowledges as she crosses to the ladies. Meanwhile ADAM is *
      trying to welcome HANNAH. We see NICK watch for a moment.*

                                  ADAM
                    Seriously, it's cool you've come 
                    back. Really brave. And you know if 
                    I can help in any way... *

                                  HANNAH
                    Thanks, Mr Hussein, Adam, but I'll 
                    be fine. 

                                  ADAM*
                    Anything. Anything at all.

    But HANNAH'S attention is on NICK, who is ordering a drink.*                                                                                    4.


                                  HANNAH
                    Really, thanks, but I want to do 
                    this on my own.*

                                                                          CUT TO:*

      INT. RESIDENTS BLOCK CORRIDOR - NIGHT 22A2A*

      HANNAH weary and subdued heads to her room. As she rounds the *
      corner, she is startled as a figure appears in front of her.*

                                  NICK*
                    Hi.*

                                  HANNAH*
                    Oh. Hi.*

                                  NICK*
                    You came back then?*

      HANNAH shrugs as if to say yes.*

                                  NICK*
                    I'm surprised. But I'm sure you'll *
                    manage.*

                                  HANNAH*
                    I should have called.*

                                  NICK*
                    It's fine. Just be careful, okay?*

                                  HANNAH*
                    Okay.  Yeah.*

      She's confused but before she can say anything else, he's *
      gone, hurrying down the corridor.*

                                                              CUT TO:*

      INT. HANNAH S ROOM - NIGHT 233

      A pretty bare intern room.  HANNAH enters, leans on the 
      door, exhausted.*

      After a moment, she heads into the bathroom area. *

                                                                          CUT TO:

      INT. HANNAH S BATHROOM - NIGHT 244

      HANNAH looks at herself in the mirror, opens the mirrored 
      cabinet to get some make-up removal pads, closes the 
      cabinet again -

      Standing behind her in the reflection is an ill-looking 
      middle-aged, bald woman.  Her mother, DIANA.                                                                                    5.


      HANNAH turns round -

    But there s nobody there.  

    She sighs, slumps.  This is still with her.

    She looks back in the mirror, sizing herself up.  Is she 
      going to make it this time? 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      INT. HANNAH S ROOM - DAY 355

      There are cries of passion coming from above. 

      HANNAH wakes, looks out from under the covers.  She hasn t 
      slept well.  She groans and looks up. 

                                  STELLA
                          (OOV)
                    Put it inside me! Put it inside 
                    me

      HANNAH looks exasperated. 

                                  STELLA
                          (OOV)
                    Uh! Uh! Uh!

      Rhythmic thumping. HANNAH can t take it any longer.  She 
      hauls herself out of bed.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. STELLA'S ROOM - DAY 366*

      NICK and STELLA are getting dressed, laughing.

                                  NICK
                    So much for discretion.

                                  STELLA
                          (Playful.)*
                    Are you embarrassed of me?

                                  NICK
                    I'm just thinking about your 
                      reputation. 

                                  STELLA
                    I d worry about your own.

      They snog again.  

                                  STELLA

                    So, do you think she'll stick around thistime?*                                                                                    6.

                    Who?

                                  STELLA
                    Oh come on ...

      NICK raises an eyebrow.  Is she jealous?

                                  NICK
                    Why the sudden interest?

                    Ruthless ambition. (BEAT) The 
                    thing with Hannah is - She cares 
                    about her patients.

                                  STELLA
                          (Wry.)*
                    How bizarre.

      INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE STELLA'S ROOM - DAY 377*

      NICK opens the door, does a slightly too obvious look left, 
      look right.

                                  STELLA
                    Don't worry. Nobody's going to 
                    see you. 

      They share a smile at that and a final quick kiss, he s 
      off.  *

      NICK heads quickly away from Stella's room  -*                                                                                    7.


    And feels his hand itching.  He looks at it. Where he 
      nicked himself in the operation, his hand is now swollen, 
      livid ...*

    He looks at it, worried.

      INT. SHARED KITCHEN - DAY 388

      JESS is sat at the table looking the worse for wear, while 
      HANNAH is making breakfast. 

                                  JESS
                     Put it inside me, put it inside

                                  HANNAH
                    You heard it too?

                                  JESS
                    Like my radio was tuned to  Put It 
                    Inside Me FM. 

      Enter STELLA, full of the joys of Spring.  

                                  JESS
                    Good night?

                    Anyone we know?

      STELLA glances at HANNAH, gauging her reaction.  

                                  STELLA
                    I don t think so.

      HANNAH S a little hurt, but doesn t want to give much of a 
      reaction: a weary look. Which makes STELLA perk even more: 
    she wins.

                                                              CUT TO:

    EXT HOSPITAL MAIN ENTRANCE -DAY 399*

      HANNAH, STELLA, JESS and RAFEE head into the hospital ready 
    for work.

                                  JESS
                    It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

    On HANNAH, empathising with that.*                                                                                    8.


                                  RAFEE
                    You do know this is the suicide 
                    capital of the NHS?

                                  JESS
                    What?

                                  RAFEE
                    Didn't you read the prospectus?

      JESS, realising RAFEE is teasing her, thumps him. He smiles *
      andheads off.*

      NICK makes his way quickly through the hospital.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      NICK makes sure he can t be seen, and takes a metal box 
      from his pocket.  

      From it, he takes a syringe containing a dark liquid.  He 
      looks worried at it: is this going to work?

    He slips the hypo into the affected part of his hand.  

    He injects, wincing at how much it hurts.  

    He removes the hypodermic and waits ... waits ...

    And now the swelling in his hand has, amazingly, visibly 
      reduced. 

    He relaxes a little.  

                                                                          CUT TO:

      RAFEE is negotiating determinedly with thirtysomething 
      technician LOZ, who s laying out a corpse.  She s justpulled*
      a bloodiedmetal box with wires out of the man s open chest.  *

                                  RAFEE
                    Come on, Loz.  I gave you my wants 
                    list weeks ago.

                                  LOZ
                    It takes time.                                                                                      9.


                                  RAFEE
                    What is that?

                                  LOZ
                    Pacemaker.  Tricky buggers.  

    She drops it in a tray.  *

                    But I am?*

                                  RAFEE*

                                  LOZ*
                    As reliable as it gets in this *

                          (nods at corpse)*

      RAFEE's frustrated but before he can answer ADAM enters.*

                    correct, sir. 

      ADAM ignores her.

                    Rafee, you should be on the wards.  *

                    What are you going to do, call Mum?

      ADAM grabs him and hauls him towards the door.  

    LOZ starts up the saw as she watches him go. Out on the 
      terrible sound of the saw cutting into flesh and bone.

      HANNAH, STELLA, JESS, a newly-arriving RAFEE and the other 
      interns are heading on to the wards together.

      They arrive at the area they ll be working, and see a range *
    of patients in beds before them.  

                                  STELLA

                    Randall spatients. All kinds of extreme *

                    Loz told me last year there was 
                    this woman who had a foetus 
                    inside her bowel.  She died...

    We recognise MR. MADDOX from the pre-titles, his wife, MRS.

                                  STELLA
                    Recurring gastric cancer. They've 
                    cut it out five times already. 

      Which impacts on HANNAH, but she stays professional. JESS *
      looks more upset.*

      INT. WARD - DAY 31515

      ADAM and NICK are looking along the row of beds: HANNAH, 
      RAFEE, STELLA, JESS and the other interns are each standing 
      beside a different patient. 

      STELLAand HANNAH find themselves lookingateach other, sizingeach other up. *

                                  ADAM
                    Okay.  Encounter.  Examine.  

      JESS goes straight for the chart, not even looking at her old 
      gentleman.  She frowns at what she s reading.  

                                  NICK
                    Ms. Black?  Ms. Black?

      JESS is still uncertain.  

                                  NICK
                    How about we look to the actual 
                    patient...

      NICK pulls off the covers at the bottom of the bed like a 
      magician, to reveal:

      Only one leg. 

                                  NICK
                      Amputation.  Necrotising Fasciitis.                                                                                      12.


    The old gent smiles at him.  Leaving JESS floundering, out of 
    her depth. 

    At the next bed, STELLA is examining a middle-aged man, swift 
    and professional.

                                  STELLA
                    A large mass in the right lower 
                    quadrant, possibly colon cancer.  
                    If it hasn t spread he ll be fine.

      A pleased look from the patient.

                                  STELLA
                    If it has, it s terminal. 

    The patient looks sighingly to NICK, who claps him on the 
      shoulder.  

                                  NICK
                    Let's wait for the test results, Mr 
                    Clarke.

    He goes on his way.  

      STELLA looks a little irked, and that continues as she looks 
      over... 

    To where HANNAH has been assigned to MADDOX.  

    And NICK has gone over there, greeting HANNAH with a smile.   
      Which STELLA also notes.  

      MADDOX tenses up at NICK S arrival.  

                                  NICK
                    You ve said hello to our Mr. 
                    Maddox?

                                  MRS MADDOX
                    She s been very nice.  

                                  HANNAH
                    I d like to have a quick feel of 
                    your abdomen.  Is that all right?

                                  MADDOX
                    Makes a change to be asked.  

      Which gets a little cold smile of  oh come on now  from NICK.  

                                  MRS MADDOX
                    He gets a bit grumpy.  

      NICK heads off.  

                                  NICK
                    Let me know what you find.                                                                                      13.


                                  MADDOX
                    I ve never drunk, never smoked.  
                    They keep trying, nothing works.  

                                  MRS MADDOX
                    Miss Randall's been very good to *
                    us.It's the best teaching hospital *
                    in the country, you know. We could *

                    never have afforded it.  Everywhere *

                    else itwas like 'oh notthem again'.  Here we're *

                    special and exciting.  *

      MADDOX tries to sit up, in pain. HANNAH moves to help, but 
      MRS. MADDOX discretely shakes her head: let him do it.  So 
    she does.  

                                  MADDOX
                    Did you bring a paper?

                                  MRS MADDOX
                    I ll get one.

    She pats HANNAH on the arm and heads off.  

      HANNAH starts to unbutton his MADDOX's pyjama jacket. 

                                  MADDOX
                    I don t like her to see me like 
                    this.  In and out of these bloody 
                    places. I wish they'd just leave me 
                    -
                          (He stops himself.)
                    Ignore me. Not sleeping too well.  
                    It's all these injections. They 
                    give me bad dreams. 

    His stomach is distended. HANNAH recognisesthis.  She has to 
      take a moment, to steel herself. 

                                  HANNAH
                    Okay, I m going to do this very 
                    gently.  Although by now you can 
                    probably tell me how it's done-

      MADDOX winces in pain.  

      Suddenly a lump rears up under the skin of his stomach!  
      Right under HANNAH S hand!

      HANNAH steps back.  She stares at it.  She doesn t trust what 
      she s seeing.  She steps back and back, almost about to run.

                                  NICK
                    Hannah?  What is it?

    All the staff, interns, even patients, all looking at her.                                                                                      14.


                                  HANNAH
                    Something ... moved.

      Some of them are starting to laugh.  Wow, is she going to be 
      this mad?  Great joy from STELLA.  

      NICK looks at HANNAH concerned. 

                                  NICK
                    What happened?

      HANNAH looks over to where MADDOX is looking afraid.

                                  HANNAH
                    Nothing.  It was nothing.  

                                  NICK*
                    You were examining the abdomen?

                                  HANNAH
                    Yes-

                                  NICK
                    And?*

                                  HANNAH
                    I was mistaken.  Sorry.  

      NICK goes over to MADDOX.  *

                                  NICK
                    Storm in a teacup, Mr. Maddox.  
                    Don t look so worried. We re going *
                    to operate on you again soon, and 
                    then it'll all be fine. 

                                  MADDOX
                    Oh?You sure?*

                                  NICK
                    Don't let Hannah scare you. She's 
                    very nice really.

    And HANNAH looks embarrassed now.

      Later.  The group are departing, end of the round.  A 
      nervous glance back from JESS...

    To where HANNAH has stopped, wondering if she s up to this.  
    But she steels herself.  

    And goes over to where ADAM and NICK are alone now.                                                                                      15.


                                  HANNAH
                    Sorry Mr Gates, but I really 
                    thought I should mention ... About 
                    Mr Maddox?

      NICK and ADAM look awkwardly at each other.  This is kind 
    of embarrassing.  

                                  HANNAH
                    There was something.  

      NICK's worried about what she s going to say.  Worried on 
    her behalf?

                                  HANNAH
                    He mentioned some injections that 
                    were giving him discomfort. Only, 
                    I couldn t find them on his chart 
                    -

                                  NICK
                    That s because there aren t any 
                      injections.  

      HANNAH looks lost.  

                                  HANNAH
                    Oh.

                                  ADAM
                    He was probably confused. Someone 
                    taking blood, maybe. 

                                  HANNAH
                    He seemed quite certain -

                                  NICK
                    Listen, Hannah, you didn t 
                    exactly cover yourself in glory 
                    today, but trying too hard won t -

      Which makes her feel even more awkward. But a friendly hand 
      closes on her shoulder. 

                                  RANDALL*
                    Ah, there she is!

                                  NICK
                    Miss. Randall.*

                                  ADAM
                    Miss. Randall.*

                                  RANDALL*
                    Hannah.  A pleasure to see you 
                    back. Come and have a cup of tea. 
                    We must catch up.                                                                                      16.


    And she s on her way again, expecting Hannah to follow. She 
      looks awkwardly at NICK and ADAM.

                                  ADAM
                    Friends in high places.  

                                  NICK
                    Tell you what Ms. Carter.  
                    Tomorrow we start over.  Okay?

      HANNAH smiles, grateful and heads after Randall.  

                                                                          CUT TO:


      EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY 31717

      RANDALLand HANNAH are standing in a quad with lumps of *
      ugly public art, drinking canteen tea in polystyrene cups.  

      Patients and staff are smoking nearby. 

                                  RANDALL*
                    It s strange seeing you in that 
                    white coat. (BEAT) You look so 
                    like your mother.  

      Which is not what HANNAH needed to hear right now.  

                                  RANDALL*
                    I remember when we first 
                    qualified. We thought anything 
                    was possible, that we could save 
                    anyone.But when it came to your *
                    mother,we might as well have *
                    been in the Dark Ages. 

                                  HANNAH
                    I m just glad you were there for 
                    her.  

      HANNAH looks towards the smokers.

    And there stands DIANAamongst them.  

      HANNAH shuts her eyes.  

      RANDALLnotices her grief. *

                                  RANDALL*
                    If there's anything I can do to *
                    make this easier...*

      HANNAH opens her eyes. Her mother has gone. 

                                  HANNAH
                    I m not expecting special 
                    treatment.                                                                                    17.


                                  RANDALL*
                    You won t need it. I m delighted to 
                    have you on my Firm. You'll do your 
                    mother proud.

      That puts even more pressure on HANNAH.  She wants to rise 
    to the challenge. But can she?

                                                                          CUT TO:

      A box with... syringes of dark liquid in it.

      INT. HANNAH S ROOM - NIGHT 32020

      HANNAH lies in bed, troubled and sleepless, the first light 
    of dawn coming in through the window.  

      When she closes her eyes, she see brief flashes of her 
      visions: her mother, Mr Maddox s stomach.  

    She opens her eyes again.  Can she do this? Can she keep 
      going?

      Chaos.  Violence.  Noise.  A grainy, numb flashback to 
      HANNAH, a little younger, screaming and shouting, 
      incoherent.

      Medics are hauling her back, away from a patient on the 
      operating table.  There s blood everywhere.

                    isn't she?

      Slowly, gingerly, uncertainly... she lifts his pyjama 
      jacket... 

                                  MADDOX
                    Is everything all right?

    His abdomen, still swollen, but nothing unusual. HANNAH 
      lowers the garment, a sense of relief.  

                                  HANNAH
                    Everything's fine. Thank you.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. SCRUB ROOM/INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 42525*

      NICK enters to prep for surgery.  *

    He looks at his hand, worried again.  It s swollen and 
      livid, only more so than before, as if something is trying 
    to burst out from within. He rubs it, scratches it, 
      clenches his teeth... 

    He can t stand the itching!  Why is it doing this again?!

    He scratches and scratches, takes it to the sink, lets 
      water run on it.

      Still itching!  He grabs a scrubbing brush.

    He scrubs at his hand.  He gets some relief, mixed with the 
      intense pain.  

    But then he looks down in horror.  

      He s really messed up his hand.  

    He makes himself stop.  Feverishly, he takes from his 
      pocket a metal case, and opens it and removes a hypodermic 
      with the dark liquid inside.  He injects his hand again.  
    He looks at it, waiting for it to improve.  Nothing yet.                                                                                     23.


      Enter HANNAH.  

                                  HANNAH
                    Hi.

      NICK pockets the hypo, hiding his hand with it.  

                                  NICK
                    Oh. Hi.

                                  HANNAH
                    I wanted to talk to you. To say *
                    sorry, about the other day, 
                    freaking out. All of it really. I 
                    know this is difficult for you too. 

                                  NICK
                    It s fine.  Don t worry.  

                                  HANNAH
                    I do want us toget on.*

                                  NICK
                    Hey, of course -

    He gives her a hug. She relaxes.

                                  NICK
                    I ve probably been a bit of a 
                    dick. A lot of stuff went unsaid 
                    at the end there...

                                  HANNAH
                    We re fine.  I understand.  
                    Really.

                                  NICK
                    No, I should have been there for 
                    you. I wasn't and I'm sorry.

    She smiles. He's still holding her. Not what she was 
      expecting.

                                  NICK
                    I ve actually really missed you, 
                    Han.Can I say that?

    He looks at her, complicated, conflicted.

                                  NICK
                    I was... happy, when we were 
                    together.  

                                  HANNAH
                    Yeah, me too.  But -                                                                                    24.


                                  NICK
                    I could always talk to you.  And 
                    now everything s... 

    He breaks off.  

                                  HANNAH
                    What?

    He shakes his head.  Doesn t want to go there.  

                                  NICK
                    Me and Stella -

                                  HANNAH
                    None of my business. 

    He doesn t know what to say any more -

    He suddenly grabs her and kisses her.  

    She reacts, doesn t know how to handle this.

    But then she finds herself... 

      Kissing him back.  Just for a second.  

    And we see that STELLA, unseen, has just entered.  And is 
      angry, seething with jealousy... and hurting.  

    And she can t take this any longer: she rushes out.  

      HANNAH suddenly pushes NICK away.

                                  HANNAH
                    No!

    He makes to hold her again. She stops him.  

                                  HANNAH
                    That s not how I want things to 
                    be.  

    The desperate look in his eyes changes to anger, like he s 
      been betrayed. 

      Which astonishes her.  This isn t the man she knows.  

                                  NICK
                    I want you Hannah. Don t fight 
                    me. 

    He makes to grab her. But, scared now, she avoids him and 
      rushes out.                                                                                      25.


                                  NICK*
                    Hannah!

                                                                          CUT TO:

      INT. FEMALE WARD - DAY 42626*

      JESS is trying to find a vein in the arm of a patient to 
      insert a canula.The patient keeps reacting in pain as 
      STELLA and HANNAH work at the next bed, STELLA injecting 
      local anaesthetic to a wound on a patient s arm, which HANNAH 
    is making ready to stitch.  

      STELLA is looking at HANNAH, who still looks flustered.  

                                  STELLA
                    And still she looks so innocent.  

                                  HANNAH
                    Sorry?

      STELLA gives her a look: don t try to fool me. HANNAH 
      realises.

                                  HANNAH
                    Oh God.  Listen: I m so sorry. It 
                    was a stupid moment. 

                                  STELLA
                    You're having a lot of those. Look, 
                    why don't you just hurry up and 
                    quit or flunk out or whatever?

      JESS looks over from what she s doing, not comfortable being 
      here for this.  Both patients are listening awkwardly. Hannah 
      doesn't want to speak but has to try explain. 

                                  HANNAH
                    It wasn't what I wanted. I was 
                    confused and Nick-

                                  STELLA
                    What, you're going to cry sexual 
                      harassment? Cos that's gonna play 
                    so well for you -

      Suddenly JESS  patient cries out, JESS has clearly done 
      something wrong. Blood oozes from where the canula has 
      punctured the skin.

                                  JESS
                    Sorry.  

      ADAM arrives.  

                                  ADAM
                    How are we getting on?                                                                                    26.


      STELLA disconcerted by the exchange, heads off.  

    And HANNAH would like to follow her, to explain, but -

                                  ADAM
                    Is the patient numb?

    The patient gives a wary nod.  

                                  ADAM
                    Ms. Carter, are you ready to sew 
                    the wound?

    And she has to give in and do this.  

                                  ADAM
                    The trick is to make sure your 
                    bites are the same size on each 
                    side of the wound.  And bed your 
                    knots down well.  That s it... 

      HANNAH is flustered, but doing fine.  

                                  ADAM
                    It can take practice.  And I know 
                    you might feel quite nervous after 
                    the other day.  If you d like I 
                    could give you some extra tuition, 
                    after ward round. We could maybe 
                    even get a bite to eat-

      HANNAH reacts: this, now?! She finishes up and presents her 
      work to him.

                                  ADAM
                      Ah.Actually that s... excellent.  

      HANNAH smiles curtly at him and heads off.  Leaving ADAM 
      looking philosophical. Oh well!

                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. STELLA'S ROOM - DAY 42727

      STELLA takes the syringe from Nick s bathroom from her 
      pocket and looks at it.  She s considering her own doubts 
      about Nick.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 42828*

      NICK looks tired, troubled, guilty.  He has to stop, 
      support himself on the wall.  He s still got his hand in 
    the pocket of his white coat.  He looks at it... but now 
      it s perfectly fine again.  Incredibly.                                                                                      27.


    He straightens up when ADAM arrives.  

                                  ADAM
                    Pub?

      Before NICK can say  no  he throws an arm round NICK S 
      shoulder, as if to lead him away.

                                  ADAM
                    I know, I know. It s shit and 
                    full of doctors but it beats 
                    sitting in your room reading 
                    about bowel parasites. 

    But NICK gets out from under the arm.  

                                  NICK
                    Can't.  

                                  ADAM
                    Another night on the Stella?

                                  NICK
                    No. 

                                  ADAM
                    Mate. Are you okay?

                                  NICK
                    Just got a lot on. Sorry.

      ADAM heads off, looking concerned.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. HANNAH'S ROOM - NIGHT 42929

      HANNAH is working on her laptoplooking tired.

    Her mobile rings. She answers.

                                  HANNAH
                    Hello?

                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. WARD CORRIDOR - NIGHT 43030*

      HANNAH heads to the ward, somewhat puzzled.

                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. WARD - NIGHT 43131*

      HANNAH wanders in and stands there looking at this place 
      where she should be so much at home.                                                                                      28.


    We hear all the little noises of a ward at night, the 
      snuffles, the cries... There s the light on at the nurse s 
      station...

    She goes over and finds a NURSE.*

                                  HANNAH
                    You called me?

                                  NURSE
                    Oh right. Mr Maddox kept asking for *
                    you. He wouldn't go back to sleep. *
                    I finally thought sod it. Why *
                    should you miss out on all the fun?*

      HANNAH sees the curtains around that bed are drawn.  

                                  NURSE
                    But Mr. Gates came along.So I'd*
                    get yourself home.

      HANNAH pauses for a moment: NICK?  She doesn t want to see 
    him now.  

    But she finally nods thanks and heads off towards MR. 
      MADDOX S bed.

      Through a gap in the curtains, she can see NICK moving.  He s 
      taking something from a small case... 

    She slows, puzzled.  

    She moves to get a better view, moving stealthily now.  

      NICK is preparing a syringe above the sleeping MADDOX, who s 
      connected to a monitor.  The syringe contains the same dark 
      liquid he was injecting himself with.  

      NICK injects MADDOX, who becomesquite agitated in hisdreams, helplesslyfending *

      somethingoff, in his stomach.*

      HANNAH doesn t know what to do.  She knows she s seeing 
      something that s not right.  But is she really seeing it?  
    She wavers, maybe about to just leave.  

      NICK suddenly pulls back the curtains.

    She ducks aside.  

    He doesn t see her as he heads off. 

      MADDOX groans in his sleep.  Which makes her mind up for her. 

    She goes to him.  

    She checkshis stomach, and finds a needle mark.  *                                                                                    29.


    She looks to the notes at the bottom of the bed... and is 
      frustrated and surprised.  Nothing there!

      MADDOX wakes up, still quite out of it.  

                                  MADDOX
                    Leave me alone.

                                  HANNAH
                    Mr Maddox. Charlie. It's me. 
                    Hannah.

                                  MADDOX
                          (faint)
                    Did you see?

                                  HANNAH
                          (can't hear)
                    Charlie?

                                  MADDOX
                          (faint)
                    I wanted you to see it.

      HANNAH takes his hand, soothing his distress.  But what can 
    she do?

      Suddenly, NICK is behind her again.  

                                  NICK
                    Hannah?

    She spins round, shocked and guilty.  

                                  HANNAH
                    What are you doing here?

                                  NICK
                    You first. 

      He s smiling at her, kindly, but also... a little scarily.  

      MADDOX is also reacting to his presence, nervous of him.

                    That injection -

                                  NICK
                    What injection?

                                  HANNAH
                    It s not on the chart.                                                                                      30.


                                  NICK
                    Must have forgotten.  I m always 
                    doing that.

    But it looks like he s almost daring her to speak up, still 
    an edge of aggression towards her.  

                                  HANNAH*
                    Nick, what happened today-*

                                  NICK
                    It s sweet he called you.  But you 
                    should have waited until morning.  
                    You're doing it again Hannah, 
                    letting yourself get too involved. 
                    You have to learn to keep a 
                    distance.

      Which sounds almost like a threat.  

    He heads off.  

      HANNAH watches him go for a moment, frustrated, worried ... 
    but not cowed.

      INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 53535

      A basement library.  JESS is studying medical books, 
      obviously lost.  

                                  JESS
                    It's really hard. Don't you think 
                    it's really hard?

      HANNAH is beside her, checking the notes she stole against 
      a serious looking book. 

                                  JESS
                    Please tell me that s not a set 
                    text. 

                                  HANNAH
                    I m reading up on Charlie 
                    Maddox s cancer.

                                  JESS
                    Err... why?

                                  HANNAH

                    Each time he hastwo operations, an exploratory 

                    and a removal.  All clear. But exactly sixmonths *

                    later it's back. And that'shappened five times. 

                    And he's still alive.  How do you explain that?*


                                  JESS

                    Luck?*

      Then she indicates the notes.

                                  HANNAH
                    And the injections. Charlie 
                    insists he's been given them. And 
                    his obs show a temperature spike 
                    every night, suggesting he's 
                    right. 

                                  JESS
                    None of this has got anything to  
                    do with the course, has it?

      HANNAH smiles, shaking her head.  

                                  JESS
                    Thank God. I need a drink. 
                    Coming? 

                                  HANNAH
                    Maybe later.

      JESS goes to head off.                                                                                     33.


                                  HANNAH
                    Jess-

      JESS turns.

                                  JESS
                    Yeh?

                                  HANNAH
                    You know your stuff. You'll be 
                    fine.

      JESS smiles: thanks and goes. HANNAH returns to her books.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 53636

      It s got late, and quiet, and HANNAH looks up to notice 
      she s alone in the library.  

    She decides she d better put the books back before she 
      heads home.  She picks the books up, leaving the notes, and 
      heads for the stacks. 

    She sees she s not alone.  There s someone silhouetted at 
    the end of the aisle -

    Who moves quickly out of sight.

      HANNAH stops: what?  

                                  HANNAH
                    Hello?  Who is that?

      Silence.  Okay, maybe this is nothing.

      HANNAH puts her books back, more quickly than she normally 
      world, and heads down the aisle at speed.  That gap ahead 
    of her -

    She goes through it, and to the door -

      Which is locked.  

      HANNAH thumps on it.  Still in control.  Thumps again.

                                  HANNAH
                    Hello?

    All the way over there, right on the other side of the *
      library, there s the emergency exit sign.  

    She takes a deep breath.  Is she going to go for it?

    She hears a small noise from somewhere in the stacks.                                                                                      34.


    She decides: no choice.  She moves slowly towards the 
      stacks.  

                                  HANNAH
                    Hello?  

    She moves along the aisles, looking down each one.  

                                  HANNAH
                    Who is that?

    She sees a movement down the end of one aisle, a figure 
      crossing the end of it.

    She takes a step into that aisle. 

    She listens.  Silence.  She s scared now.  

    She takes a step out of the aisle -

    And starts walking quickly, heading directly for the 
      emergency exit.  

      Which will mean heading down that dark aisle over there. 

    She turns, walking faster and faster.  She s trying not to 
      run.

      Through the gaps in the books, can she see someone keeping 
      pace with her?

                                  HANNAH
                    This isn t funny!

      There s a crash of falling books. She breaks into a run.  

    The end of the aisle, that gap, coming up fast.  Nothing in 
    her way, the emergency exit right there.  

    She runs out of the end of the aisle, looks one way, 
      nothing, turns -

    And runs right into -

      SENNET, who s gothis mobile in his hand.*


                                  SENNET*

                    I thoughtI heard someone.  They've locked us *

                    in.  I'm callingsecurity.What'swrong?*


    She relaxes.  All isnormal again.*

    INT LIBRARY - NIGHT 53737*

      HANNAH gets back to where she was studying...

    And the medical notes are splayed out, different from where 
    she left them.  She grabs them, looks through them...

                                  SENNET
                          (Calls.)*
                    The cavalry's here! Hannah! 

      Behind her SENNET greets the security guard as he unlocks the 
      main door.

      HANNAH is astonished at what she's found.

                                                                          CUT TO:*

      HANNAH moves round to the computer terminal and starts searchingthe records.

                    Shit!

    The NURSE is getting impatient.                                                                                     36.


                                  HANNAH
                    The computer says exactly the same. 
                    Patent blue.

    The NURSE gently moves Hannah away from the desk.

      HANNAH, agitated, takes a beer from the fridge and slams the 
      door. Opens a drawer, looks for a bottle opener but can't 
      find one. Frustrated she looks in another drawer, 
      unsuccessfully, and pushes that shut. Behind her appears 
      RAFEE, beer in one hand holding out the bottle opener in the 
      other.

                                  RAFEE

                                  RAFEE
                    So do you wanna tell me what s *

                    You just get the feeling that ... 
                    there are the rules, and then there 
                    are the rules.  There are people in

                    there are ... people in charge.

                      difference?

    She looks lost: she doesn t know if she can.  She feels like 
      a coward.  

    She gets up and heads off.  

      Leaving RAFEE wondering what he just did to cause that.                                                                                      38.

                    Doesn t make it any easier.

    He looks to HANNAH, quietly.*

    She squeezes his hand.

      A Porter and a Theatre Nurse arrive to take MADDOX to *
      theatre. *

      MADDOX looks at his wife. *

                                  MRS MADDOX
                    It ll be all right.

      MRS. MADDOX kisses his head, reassuring.*

      They take MADDOX away. HANNAH sees how frightened MRS *
      MADDOX is.*

      ADAM leads in HANNAH, RAFEE, STELLA and JESS in scrubs, *
      clogs, hats.  

    On HANNAH, trying to control her fear, now she s back in 
      here.                                                                                      41.

    He looks to HANNAH.

                                  ADAM
                    For most of you.  

    The others all glance at HANNAH.  She s annoyed at being 
      looked at again.

                                  ADAM
                    Don t touch anything.  Including

                    I hope there s not too much blood. 

                                  RAFEE
                    Who was your careers officer?

      RANDALL, NICK and the surgical team are already preparing.  *
      NICK looks resentful at RANDALL S presence, but turns away *
      when she looks to him.  

    The interns stand alongside with a full view of MADDOX, 
      once again unconscious.  

      A Theatre Technician places two scans of MADDOX S abdomen, 
      before and after, onto an illuminated mobile lightbox with 
      stands beside the operating area. Jess studies it.  

                                  JESS
                    I can't quite see it. Where am I

                                  ADAM
                    There.

    He points to a huge area on the film.

                    On my God!

      NICK appears beside her, with a look: do you mind? She 
      joins the group.

                                  NICK
                    MissRandall?  Do you want to say a *

                                  RANDALL (cont'd)
                    Staging CTscans show this has 
                    not spread elsewhere, therefore 
                    this is potentially curative. We 
                    can but hope. 

    She makes contact with NICK, sharing a secret or sizing him 
    up.

                                  RANDALL*
                    Mr. Gates will lead.  

      HANNAH notes that.

      NICK takes a scalpel.  The first incision.  Done very fast 
    and hard.  

    On the reactions: RAFEE and JESS nervy, nauseated; STELLA 
      ready.  

    But HANNAH is looking at how angry NICK looks, how stressed 
      out. 

    He registers her watching him.  Then gives a visible shrug.  

                                  NICK
                    Right.  Let s get on with it, 
                    shall we?

    And he continuescutting, a trifle hurriedly. Which already *
    is making HANNAH uneasy.  

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. OPERATING THEATRE - DAY 64444

      A little later.  ADAM is using a suction device to remove 
      blood from the incision. 

      RANDALLis looking on, placid, but judging.  *

      NICK is sounding pressurised and hating it.  

                                  NICK
                      Monopolardiathermy.  Come on ...

    The Theatre Nurse passes it to him.

      NICK puts it into the incision.  A buzzing sound.  Smoke 
      starts to rise out of the incision.

                                  ADAM
                    The smell of cooking human flesh.

    The interns react in horror.  

      HANNAH is trying to control her fear, and so far, 
      succeeding.                                                                                      43.


                                  RANDALL*
                    You get used to it.  

      A little glance at NICK.

    Who looks annoyed back at her, distracted.

      A little spray of blood -

      JESS stifles a cry.  

      STELLA rolls her eyes.

                                  STELLA
                    It s only blood. 

      HANNAH ignores it, still focused on how driven NICK seems. 

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. OPERATING THEATRE - DAY 64545

      Later.  MADDOX S abdomen is now clamped open.  

    We can see the exposed mass.

      HANNAH is staying calm, focused.  

      NICK is using a retractor to lift the mass and get a view 
      underneath it. 

                                  NICK
                    There's excessive scarring.  It s 
                    impossible to identify any anatomy.

                                  RANDALL *
                    Which is completely normal for 
                    multiple operations. 

                                  NICK*
                    Light, please!  I can t see a 
                    bloody thing in here!

    The Theatre Nurse adjusts the light. 

      NICK puts his hands in, feels tentatively around the mass.

                                  NICK
                    The CT scan s no help, this could 
                    extend to involve almost any 
                    underlying structure. So, all *
                    right. We don t know.  We never 
                    know with this, do we?  Sod it. So -

    He winces, has to hold his stomach... straightens up again.                                                                                    44.


                                  RANDALL*
                    Mr. Gates, what approach do you 
                    think we should take?

      NICK just holds up a hand: he s fine!

                                  ADAM
                    Nick, his BP s pretty low.  
                    Should we wait while the 
                    anaesthetist catches up?

                                  NICK
                    Let's just get on with it, okay?

      A surprised look from ADAM: that s not right. 

                                  NICK
                    Come on, Adam, your babies need 
                    to see the real thing, don t 
                    they?

      HANNAH and the interns look at each other, unnerved. 

                                  RANDALL*
                    Mr. Gates, I asked what you 
                    wanted to do.

                                  NICK
                    Keep going of course!  

    He looks to the Theatre Nurse.

                    Phone transfusion, make sure the

                    heavy vicrylties in a moment.  

    And back to ADAM.

                                  NICK
                    And retract, will you, so I can 
                    bloody see something?

      ADAM looks to RANDALL, then, having got just a steady look, *
      reluctantly takes the retractor and holds the 'tumour' up, 
    as NICK uses the diathermy to cut around it. 

                                  NICK
                    Okay, yes... 

      NICK stops, confused, but trying to hide it. 

                                  RANDALL*
                    Is something wrong?                                                                                    45.


                                  NICK
                    No.  Yes.  I can t mobilise the 
                    deep surface of the tumour.  It s 
                    baked solid.  Retract, please!

      They try again.  Fail.

      NICK doesn t know what to do, hesitates, breathing hard, 
      racked with pain and fear.  

      RANDALLturns to put herself between the interns and the *
      operation. 

                                  RANDALL*
                    Got a mind of its own.  Mr. 
                    Gates, may I suggest you leave 
                    the deep surface and work on the 
                    lateral side?

                                  NICK
                    I suppose.  Yes.  All right.  

      NICK struggles to mobilise the tumour.

    The BP monitor alarm goes off.

    The anaesthetist looks at it, confused.

                                  STELLA

                          (Whisper to the interns.)

                                  HANNAH
                    How is that possible?

    The anaesthetist checks the gas levels and his equipment, 
      urgent.

                                  RANDALL*
                    Mr. Gates?

                                  NICK
                    I can do this!

                                  ADAM*

                    Shall I take the internsout?*

      HANNAH looks at MADDOX s fingers: they twitch!  This is her 
      nightmare coming true!  It takes a moment before she can 
      make herself say it.  

                                  HANNAH
                    He s awake!

                                  ADAM
                    Don t be ridiculous, Ms. Carter.

    At that moment, MADDOX s body shudders and he groans.  

                                  RANDALL*
                    Nick?

                                  NICK
                    I ve nearly got it mobilized ...

                                  RANDALL*
                    Help me restrain him.*

      MADDOX s convulsions become stronger, it s almost like he s 
      awake ... 

      A shared look of terror around the theatre.

      HANNAH has to control herself, desperately afraid, and 
      afraid for MADDOX.  She grabs his hand.  

                                  RANDALL*
                    Clear the theatre!

      SUDDENLY, something akin to a small explosion of blood goes 
    off covering the interns, the curtains, the equipment, 
      everything!

      MADDOX immediately stops convulsing. A moment of deathly 
      silence - 

      Then, urgency around the table!

      HANNAH is pushed back, stumbling, wrenched from MADDOX S 
      hand.  

                                  RANDALL*
                    Mr. Gates, step back!

                    I just -

                                  RANDALL*
                    Step back from the table, now!  

      NICK does so. RANDALLsteps in to take over. *

                                  RANDALL*
                    He s torn a major artery! Suction!  
                    We need to tie this off.

                    Large clamps. Now, damn it! All of 
                    you, out!

      HANNAH stumbles out with the others, looking back to a 
      theatre covered in blood, with NICK standing there amongst 
    it, isolated, furious.

      STELLA manages to start scrubbing, but disturbed, *
      distracted, wondering about NICK.  

      ADAM is standing aside, quietly professional, deep in 
      thought.

    And there s HANNAH, all alone, just about keeping it 
      together.  

                                                                          CUT TO:*

      INT. HOSPITAL OUTSIDE THEATRE - DAY 646a46a*

      RANDALLcomes out to the interns who wait anxiously. She's *
      followed by NICK sullen, withdrawn. 

                                  RANDALL*
                    I m sorry.  We lost him.  Adam, 
                    would you inform Mrs. Maddox? 
                    Thank you.

    It looks for a moment like ADAM S going to protest, looking 
      worried to NICK. But he gives in.                                                                                    48.


                                  ADAM
                    Of course. 

      RANDALLlooks to the interns.  *

                                  RANDALL*
                    That would not have been my 
                    choice for a first operation.  
                    But perhaps it is a good lesson.

                      investigate in due course.*

      NICK sees HANNAH looking coldly at him.  He turns away.  

                                  RANDALL*
                    This was an extreme case.  But 
                    content yourselves with the 
                    thought: it doesn t get much 
                    worse than that.

      HANNAH and STELLA both find themselves looking over at 
      NICK.  And then at each other.  Sizing each other up.  

                                                                          CUT TO:

                    Nick -

    He stops, still furious with himself, still in pain.  He 
      hardly wants to look at her.  

                                  HANNAH
                    What happened in there?  

                                  NICK
                    Mr Maddox was a very sick man.*

                                  HANNAH
                    I saw you injecting him!You *
                    know I did. If it was a drug 
                    trial ... ifyou re under some 
                    sort of... pressure to cover it 
                    up... You said you could always 
                    talk to me.  You still can.  

    For a moment, he s tempted.  But then a wince of pain, a 
      glare of sudden anger at her...                                                                                     49.


    And then he knows he can t trust himself, and turns and 
      quickly heads off. 

      Leaving HANNAH distraught.  

    And STELLA, watching from a distance.  *

                                                                          CUT TO:

      INT. WARD - DAY 64848

      From a distance, we see ADAM approaching MRS MADDOX.  

    She looks hopeful -

                                  ADAM
                    Mrs. Maddox... this was a very 
                    difficult procedure.  We 
                      encountered complications and there 
                    was a great deal of blood loss ... 

      She s realisedwhat he s going to say.  

                                  ADAM
                    I m afraid your husband died on 
                    the operating table.  

    She puts a hand over her mouth, sheer horror.  

                                  ADAM
                    He didn t suffer.  He wouldn t 
                    have known a thing.  There was no 
                    more anyone could have done.

    He takes her hands. 

      HANNAH is watching from a distance, annoyed that this isn t 
    the whole truth, feeling for MRS. MADDOX.

                                  ADAM
                    The last thing that happened to 
                    him was you and he having a chat, 
                    and I think I saw you kiss him 
                    goodbye, didn t I?

      She s distraught, can t speak, holding onto his hands hard. 

      HANNAH softens.  She s pleased and a little surprised by 
    how good ADAM S being.

                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                    50.

      INT. NICK S ON CALL ROOM - NIGHT 65252

      NICK goes to lie on his bed, which has a tray of surgical 
      instruments on the table beside it.  He tries to calm 
      himself.  He takes a small hypodermic, filled with local 
      anaesthetic, and injects himself in the abdomen.  

      Then he reaches for another.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      NICK takes a scalpel from the tray.  He braces himself,

    He makes the first incision into his own flesh.   

    He winces as he starts to cut deeper.

                    did: that s down to Nick.  But.                                                                                      52.

                    I keep saying to myself: this is a 
                      competitive environment. Randall *
                    expects a lot. It creates ... 
                    pressure.  

                                  HANNAH
                    I think this goes way beyond 
                    that.

                                  ADAM
                    Go on.

5757*INT. CORRIDOR/INT. NICK S ON CALL ROOM - NIGHT 6 

      STELLA takes a deep breath, and knocks at NICK S door. 

                                  STELLA
                    Nick. Nick come on, it s me.

    The door opens a crack.  NICK looks out, looking like he 
      hasn t slept in days.  

                                  STELLA
                    Nick, please -

    He starts to close the door.

    She throws her weight against it and barges in. 

      NICK stumbles away from the door.

      STELLA stumbles in. 

      She s shocked at what she sees. 

    The place is a wreck.  There are bloodiedtowels in a pile, 
      medical instruments everywhere, blood dried on the sink.  

      NICK S abdomen is covered with a rough dressing under his 
      shirt.  There s blood visible under it.  

      NICK looks at her, angry, vulnerable, out of it.

                                  STELLA
                    What are you doing? 

                                  NICK
                    Bit of a mess. 

    She sees that the stain of blood under his shirt... is 
      growing bigger.                                                                                     53.


                                  STELLA
                    Whatever this is... you have to 
                    stop. 

                                  NICK
                    It s too late.

                                  ADAM
                    Do you have any proof?

                                  HANNAH
                    That s the trouble.  I checked 
                    the computer records on Maddox -

                                  ADAM
                    Excellent. You have been a 
                    naughty girl.  

      Which makes her smile, despite all this.

                                  HANNAH
                    And they square with the notes. 
                    It can all be explained away.

                                  ADAM
                    You know, this could get you thrown 
                    out.  

      Which makes her tense up again.  

                                  HANNAH
                    I thought we were talking in 
                    confidence -

                                  ADAM

                                  HANNAH
                    No.

    She starts to put her coat on.

                                  ADAM
                    So, can we make some small talk 
                    now?  

    She grins, not sure if he s charming or not. 

                                  HANNAH
                    Night, Adam.

                                                                          CUT TO:*

                    Nick, please, this isn t you ...

    He gradually gets control of himself.  He takes deep 
      breaths.  He lets her go.  

                                  NICK
                    Get out of here, Stella.  Get

      She s hesitant.

                                  NICK
                    I said get away!

    She runs out the door and slams it behind her.

      HANNAH enters, looking tired. The kitchen is dark, but for 
      a light from the corridor. 

      HANNAH is about to go through to her room, when she hears a 
      noise. She s not alone.  She quickly turns on the light-

      There seated at the communal table is STELLA. She's 
      obviously been crying.                                                                                     55.

                                  HANNAH
                    He's concerned about him too.

                                  STELLA
                    And you trust him?

      HANNAH considers.

                                  STELLA
                    Enough to show him this? He'd have 
                    to report Nick.

                                  HANNAH
                    I don't want that.                                                                                     56.


      A moment of awkward accord between the two girls.

                                  STELLA
                    No. 

                                  HANNAH
                    If Nick is injecting the same 
                    stuff, we should check it against 
                    Maddox's bloods.

                                  STELLA
                    How we gonna do that? He's dead.

                                  HANNAH
                    He'll still be in the mortuary.

      HANNAH enters the empty room, looking around to make sure 
      she s alone.

    She looks along the rows of mortuary trays, and finds the 
      name MADDOX.

    She pulls open the tray.  

      MADDOX is lying there.  

    She heads over to the shelves to fetch a syringe.*

      HANNAH is looking for a syringe. *

      Behind, unnoticed by HANNAH, something stirs.                                                                                     58.


      A figure, in the shadows, moves closer to her. A hand 
      reaches out to her. 

      HANNAH hears, turns and there stood before her is MADDOX! 

      A pained, terrified, animal expression on his face. 

      Instantly, he reaches out for her -

    And grabs her, suddenly, wrenching her head round!

    She yells at what she sees.*

      He s clawing at her, he s mindless, just reacting. 

      HANNAH is screaming, fighting!

    But it s not doing any good.  

    The syringe falls.*

      HANNAH S flailing, fighting, but she s not going to win *
      this!

      Suddenly somebody slams into them both, knocking them to 
    the floor!

      HANNAH scuttle aside to see -

      It s NICK!

      MADDOX throws himself at NICK, grappling with him.

      HANNAH looks desperately around -

    She sees the buzz saw.  

    She grabs it.  Switches it on.

      With a yell, she cuts into the back of MADDOX S neck, and 
      pushes hard.  

      MADDOX cries out in pain, thrashes around. 

      HANNAH is covered in blood.

      MADDOX screams and falls -

    The body collapses in a bloody heap.  

      NICK goes to HANNAH -

    Who backs away from him, brandishing the saw.  

                                  HANNAH
                    Stay away from me!

                    We put it inside him. The *
                    injections were supposed to keep *
                    it under control. It's absorbed, *
                    it keeps him going. But...it *
                    always starts to fail. Everything *
                    we do seems to...end up like that *
                    thing. We were told there would *
                    be incredible breakthroughs, that *

      HANNAH manages one look back at him. She has a new *
      certainty on her face. And he looks relieved too.*

                                                                          CUT TO:*                                                                                    61.


      INT. HANNAH S ROOM - NIGHT 67070*

      HANNAH gets in, covered in blood and gore.  She slams the 
      door behind her and heads to the bathroom.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. HANNAH S BATHROOM - NIGHT 67171*

      HANNAH stands in the shower, washing off the blood.

    She looks across to the mirror.

    And there s her mother, DIANA.  Still ill, but somehow not 
      looking so doom-laden now.  

      Instead, she looks... pleased. And so does HANNAH, finding 
      a new strength and purpose.  

                                                                          CUT TO:

      INT. NICK S ON CALL ROOM - NIGHT 67272*

      NICK is injecting himself again.  

    He relaxes as the effect takes hold.  Puts the needle away.  

      There s a knock on his door.  

    The knock comes again.  

      NICK nervously opens the door -

    And finds ADAM standing there, with two bottles of beer.  

                                  ADAM
                    Mate, we have to talk. Beer?

      NICK, appreciating that, lets him in.  

                                                                          CUT TO:

      INT. HANNAH S ROOM - DAY 77373*

      HANNAH wakes, looks determined.  

    She gets out of bed.  

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. WARD - DAY 77474*

      HANNAH marches through the everyday pain and suffering of 
    the wards.  She hears the cries and the moans, but the look 
    on her face now is that of someone who s found out a 
      terrible secret, and is determined to reveal the truth.                                                                                     62.


      HANNAH's phone rings. She answers it.*

    Her face falls. *

                                                                          CUT TO:*

      INT. CORRIDOR -NICK'S ON CALL ROOM -DAY 77575*

      HANNAH bursts through the double doors running as fast as *
    she can to NICK'S room.*

                                                                          CUT TO:

      INT. NICK S ON CALLROOM - DAY 77676*

      HANNAH arrives inNick's room to find STELLA covered in *
      blood. *

    She goes into the bathroom -*

                                  HANNAH
                    Oh my God.  

      There lies NICK, dead, bled out, his wrists cut open on the 
      remains of a beer bottle.  

    On HANNAH stepping back trying to deal.*

                                                              CUT TO:*


      INT. CORRIDORS - DAY 77777*

      We re moving through the corridors at high speed, going 
      through door after door, into the dark heart of the 
      hospital.

      Until we burst through one final, entirely normal door -

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. PRIVATE PATIENT ROOM - DAY 77878*

    In bed, wired up to borderline-strange looking equipment, 
      there sits a bald woman.  

    We recognise her as Hannah s mother, DIANA.Her eyes are 
      closed.

    We zoom right up to her.  We hear her laboured breathing.  
    We hear the beat of her pulse.                                                                                      63.


    And at the moment we re right in her face -

    Her eyes flick open.

    And they re entirely whiteinside. *
