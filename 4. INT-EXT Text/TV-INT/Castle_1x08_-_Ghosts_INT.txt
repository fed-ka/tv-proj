      half-filled glasses. Nothing seems amiss as we TRACK THROUGH 
      THE ROOM, so we keep moving into...



      Rusty sink and toilet. Ratty towels. CAMERA PANS to a large 
      claw-foot tub that has seen better days. And now we reveal 
      that the tub is filled with a DARK, VISCOUS LIQUID. It s so 
      still, it seems to be almost solid. But then it shivers ever 
      so slightly as something begins to work its way up from the 
      bottom of the tub. An AIR BUBBLE. Bloop. And then another. 
      And another. Bloop. Bloop. And then the liquid stirs as the 
      thing beneath it shifts and moves upward. And as it slowly 
      breaks the surface, we see through the muck that it is the 
      FACE OF A WOMAN.

                    I just don t see the point in

      Esposito burns a card and then flops three cards. Two Sevens 
      and a Two. Beckett realizes these cards are useless to her, 
      just as Castle, who has been dealt a full house, taps the 
      table eagerly.

                    days and stocked the place with 
                    motor oil. That takes planning.

                    few years. I had been laid off. 
                    Money was getting tight. Then our

                    living under a fake name? That s 
                    crazy.

                                  CASTLE
                    Her husband was pretty shaken up.

                                  MARTHA
                    Well, sure. All those birthdays and *
                      anniversaries and holidays, spent 
                    with someone he didn t even know. I 
                    can t imagine that kind of betrayal.
                          (and then)
                    Oh, wait; yes I can. It s just like 
                    when my rat of an ex-husband stole 
                    all my money and left me homeless.

                                    CASTLE*
                    It s actually kind of fascinating. *
                    I mean, it s weird enough writing *
                    fiction, but Allison Goldman was *
                    living it every day. Keeping track *
                    of all those lies... that s hard *
                    work. She must have had a damn good *
                    reason for doing it.*

                                    MARTHA*
                    Trust me, kiddo, when a woman 
                    marries a man and doesn t bother to 
                    tell him who she is for twenty 
                    years... she s a criminal. A Mata 
                    Hari. A shady lady.

                                  CASTLE
                    Or in other words, a very good 
                    actress. 

                                    MARTHA*
                    And speaking of acting, you seem to *
                    have inherited my talent for it.*

                                    CASTLE*

                    The poker game? Letting Beckett *

                    decided to commit one of his own.

      Beckett and Castle ride up the elevator. Beckett takes a wad

      The elevator doors open.*



      They head down the hall, Beckett searching for a number.

      They ve reached the door. Beckett KNOCKS LOUDLY. They both *
      react as Beckett s knocking actually OPENS THE DOOR, which 
      had been slightly ajar.



      As Castle and Beckett enter, we reveal that this SMALL LIVING 
      AREA contains a futon couch, a desk, a file cabinet, and a *

      Beckett goes through a SWINGING DOOR, which leads to the 
      kitchen off-screen, as Castle moves to the wall and briefly *
      takes it in, and then:

      doorway, holding an empty plastic GARBAGE CAN.

      holds it up for Beckett.

                                      ACT THREE



      Beckett shows Montgomery the FBI wanted poster.

                                    CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY
                    That s Allison Goldman?

                                    BECKETT
                    Aka Cynthia Dern. Wanted for 
                    domestic terrorism. In 1989, she *
                    and two friends set off a bomb on a 
                    tanker owned by one of the big oil 
                      companies.

                                    CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY

                                  CASTLE
                    Like I said. Someone was sending a 
                    message.

                                    CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY
                      I remember this. Radical 
                      environmentalists protesting the 
                    Exxon Valdez spill?

                                    BECKETT
                    Yeah. One was killed, one was 
                    caught, but Cynthia was never 
                    found.

                                    CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY
                    Looks like her past finally caught 
                    up with her.



      Castle and Beckett are sitting across the table from Lee Wax.

                                  LEE
                    While she was in college, Cynthia *
                    made friends with a couple of *
                      environmental activists: Susan 
                    Mailer and Jared Swanstrom. After 
                    the Exxon Valdez spill, these three *
                    decided to stage a protest. *

                                  LEE
                    Jared Swanstrom built the bomb. 
                    Cynthia and Susan Mailer snuck on 
                    the ship to set it. Only something 
                    went wrong.
                          (and then)
                    The ship was supposed to be empty 
                    of oil and people, but the captain, 
                    Sam Pike, had come back. He was *
                    paralyzed in the explosion. 

                                    BECKETT
                    So how did you track down Cynthia?

                                  LEE
                    I didn t. She contacted me.

                                    BECKETT
                    For what? To send you a fan letter?

                                  LEE
                    In a manner of speaking. Cynthia was 
                    getting ready to turn herself in, but 
                    she wanted to get her story out to 
                    the public before she surrendered. 
                    That way, she could explain her 
                    actions and express her remorse.

                                  CASTLE
                    And get public opinion on her side.

                                  LEE
                    It s a great way to influence a 
                    potential jury pool.

                                    BECKETT
                    But, she did it, right? How was she 
                    planning to  influence  them?

                                  LEE
                    Cynthia told me that on the night of 
                    the bombing, she tried to back out. 
                    When she realized the captain was 
                    aboard, she argued with Susan Mailer 
                    to call it off. But Susan refused. 
                    Susan went to set the bomb herself 
                    and, ironically, died in the 
                      explosion. Cops thought it must have *
                    gone off in her hands. The girl was *
                      vaporized. But Cynthia escaped.*

                                    BECKETT
                    So why come out of hiding now? *    CASTLE Ep. 108 "Ghosts"    Full Blue Draft     1-27-09        25.

                    Money. She needed the cash. *

                                  CASTLE
                    You were paying her?*

                                  LEE
                    A few hundred a week. I managed to *
                    get the publisher to agree to a 
                    small advance. But if the book had 
                    sold well...
                          (a pointed look to Castle)
                    I don t have to tell you how much 
                    money was at stake.

                                    BECKETT
                    When was the last time you saw 
                    Cynthia?

                    Tuesday afternoon.

                                  CASTLE
                    The day she died.

                                  LEE
                    Look, we met in a coffee shop near 
                    my apartment three times a week. 
                    She was fine when she left.

                                    BECKETT
                    Did she say anything about going to 
                    see someone else that day? Someone 
                    from her past?

                                  LEE
                    No. She was really paranoid about *
                    being discovered before the book 
                    could come out. She didn t want me 
                    to get in touch with anyone from 
                    her old life.

                                  CASTLE
                    But you did anyway... 
                          (off her look)
                    Any true crime writer worth their *
                    salt would ve checked her story *
                    with other sources. 

                                  LEE
                    Okay, so I made a few calls. *    CASTLE Ep. 108 "Ghosts"    Full Blue Draft     1-27-09        26.


                                    BECKETT
                    These sources that you talked to, 
                    did any of them want her dead?

                                  LEE
                    Maybe. But no one knew how to find 
                    her, remember? Even I didn t know 
                    where she lived.

                                    BECKETT
                    I ll need to see your manuscript *
                    and your interview notes. 

                                  LEE
                    You can have whatever you want, but 
                    in return, I d like to be kept in the 
                    loop as the investigation proceeds. 

                                    BECKETT
                    What for?

                                  LEE
                    For my book.

                                  CASTLE
                    You re going ahead with the memoir? 
                    But Cynthia s dead.

                                  LEE
                      Correction. Cynthia s been 
                    murdered. Which means her memoir 
                    just became a true crime story. 
                    That s kind of my forte.*

      Lee pulls a LARGE BOUND MANUSCRIPT from her bag and slides it 
      across the table toward Beckett.

                    It obviously wasn t a very

                    Cynthia was working with a *
                      journalist, writing a memoir...*

                                  ELEANOR*
                    We spoke with Lee Wax several *
                    times...*
                          (with distaste)*
                    She never told us that Cynthia was *
                      involved.*

                                    CAPTAIN PIKE*
                    She... should... have... *

      Eleanor holds her hand up as if to tell him not to strain. *
      Pike nods to a NURSE and she wheels him away.*

                                  ELEANOR*
                    It s hard for him. He s still angry *
                    about what happened. We all are.*

      Castle picks up a FAMILY PHOTO: the Pike family, circa 1988.*

                                    CASTLE*
                    This is your son?*

                                  ELEANOR*
                    Adam.*

      Castle sees another PHOTOGRAPH of ADAM, 20s, proudly standing *
      beside a small motorboat. Castle hands the photo to Beckett.*

                                    CASTLE*
                    He s a sailor, like his dad.*

      Eleanor nods.*

                                  BECKETT*
                    It must have been difficult for *
                    you, Mrs. Pike, taking care of your *
                    husband full-time while trying to *
                    raise your son.*

                                  ELEANOR*
                    The settlement wasn t enough to *
                    cover all of Sam s medical costs. *
                    Adam s been working and helping out *
                    since he was a teenager.*
                          (and then, bitter)*
                    I guess we can t all live in *
                      Westchester.*
                          (and then)*

                                    ELEANOR (CONT'D)
                    Is there anything else you need? I 
                    have to get my husband s lunch.

                                    BECKETT
                          (setting down the photo)
                    I d like to talk to Adam for a few 
                    minutes. Is he around?



      Castle and Beckett enter and approach Ryan.

                                    BECKETT
                    I need you to check out an alibi. 
                          (hands him a paper)
                    Adam Pike.

                                  RYAN
                    You like the kid for this?*

                                    BECKETT
                    Just call the place when they open 
                    and confirm he was working Tuesday 
                    night.

      Ryan heads off. Castle turns to Beckett, pensive.    CASTLE Ep. 108 "Ghosts"    Full Blue Draft     1-27-09        32.


                                  CASTLE
                    You know what? I hope his alibi 
                    checks out. I hope he didn t do it.

                                    BECKETT
                    And here I thought you d be saying 
                    what a great story it would make if 
                    Adam Pike was guilty. A son, taking 
                    revenge for his father? *

                                  CASTLE
                    It is a good story. A great story. *
                    It s downright Shakespearean. But, *
                      personally, I would write that *
                    family a happier ending.*

      Esposito approaches with an OLD FILE FOLDER in his hand.

                                    BECKETT
                    What s that?

                                  ESPOSITO
                    FBI files on the tanker bombing in 
                     89. I ve been going through them.

                                    BECKETT
                    And?

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Three days after the bombing, they 
                    captured Jared Swanstrom at a motel 
                    where he d been hiding out with 
                    Cynthia Dern.

                                    BECKETT
                    Right. They arrested Swanstrom, but 
                    by then, Cynthia was in the wind.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Got me wondering how she managed to 
                    slip away so easily.

                                  CASTLE
                    What did you find out?

                                  ESPOSITO 
                    The Feds had a tip line. There was 
                    a reward for anyone with *
                      information leading to an arrest. 
                    Some helpful citizen called and *
                    said they d seen Swanstrom at the 
                    motel. Feds went and grabbed him 
                    up. Easy-peasy.    CASTLE Ep. 108 "Ghosts"    Full Blue Draft     1-27-09        33.


                                    BECKETT
                    So far, pretty standard stuff.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Until you get to the part where the 
                    tipster never bothers to collect 
                    the reward. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Who was the tipster?

                                  ESPOSITO
                    That s just it. FBI never knew 
                    because she didn t leave her name. 

                                    BECKETT
                     She ?

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Records describe the voice as 
                     young and female.  

                                  BECKETT*
                    Could be Cynthia Dern. 
                          (to Esposito)
                    You think she gave up her friend to *
                    the cops?*

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Doesn t matter what I think. Only *
                    matters what Swanstrom thought. The *
                    guy did fifteen years in prison.*

                                    CASTLE*
                    That s a pretty long time to think *
                    about who put him there.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Castle, with Martha and Alexis. Castle s reading Lee Wax s 
      manuscript.

                                  MARTHA
                    At least one of them accepted some 
                      responsibility for what happened 
                    that night.

                                  CASTLE
                    Yeah. Maybe even a little too much 
                      responsibility.

                                  ALEXIS
                    You don t believe Jared Swanstrom s 
                    story?

                                  CASTLE
                    That s the thing. It s not his *
                    story, it s Cynthia s. 

                                  MARTHA
                    You wanna break this down for those 
                    of us who have already had a glass 
                    of wine?

                                  CASTLE
                          (re: the manuscript)
                    Cynthia told Lee Wax that she and 
                    Susan Mailer argued about going 
                    through with the bombing once they 
                    knew the captain was aboard. Cynthia 
                    backed out. Susan went to set the 
                    bomb by herself and... Boom!*

                                  ALEXIS
                          (getting it, to Martha)
                    But today, Jared Swanstrom said 
                    Cynthia told him there was something *
                    wrong with the timer. She didn t say *
                    anything about an argument.

                                  MARTHA
                    That is a rather glaring omission.           CASTLE Ep. 108 "Ghosts"    Pink Draft      1-28-09        36.


                                  CASTLE
                    You know, when I m writing, I find 
                    it s all about choices. What to put 
                    in. What to leave out. When to 
                    reveal information, when to hold 
                    something back... But as someone 
                    else s ghostwriter, you only have 
                    what they give you. You only know 
                    what they want you to know. 

                                  ALEXIS
                    But Lee Wax isn t Cynthia s 
                      ghostwriter anymore, right? Now 
                    that she s dead, it s no longer a *
                    memoir. It s a true crime story.*

                                  MARTHA
                    Then Ms. Wax needs to get her stories 
                    straight, because someone s lying 
                    about what happened that night.

      Off Castle...


                                    END ACT THREE    CASTLE Ep. 108 "Ghosts"    Full Blue Draft     1-27-09        37.


                                        ACT FOUR



      Beckett enters the bullpen with her morning coffee and finds *
      Castle at her desk. Lee Wax s manuscript is open in front of *
      him and he is also holding several sheets of paper in his *
      hand. She gives him a look, and he gets out of her chair.*

                                  BECKETT*
                    Good morning.*

                                  CASTLE
                          (in response, he hands her *
                          the papers)*
                    I ve been going through Lee Wax s *
                    interview notes. When she talked to *
                    Jared Swanstrom, he told her the *
                    same thing he told us: Cynthia said *
                    the bomb blew early. *
                          (showing her the *
                              manuscript)*
                    But she left that version out of *
                    the book.*

                                  BECKETT*
                    Because it contradicted with *
                    Cynthia s later story: that the *
                    girls argued when they realized *
                    Captain Pike was aboard, and Susan *
                    went to set the bomb alone. *

                                    CASTLE*
                    Cynthia couldn t know what happened *
                    once Susan was out of her sight.*
                          ( and another thing )*
                    But according to the publisher, *
                    Cynthia had approval over 
                      everything Lee Wax wrote. It was *
                    her way or the highway.*

                                    BECKETT
                    That makes sense, since-
                          ( wait a second )
                    You called the publisher? 

                                  CASTLE
                    I am somewhat known in those 
                    circles. 
                          (leaning in)
                    They weren t happy. *

                                  CASTLE (CONT'D)
                    They wanted a true crime tell-all, *
                    but all they were getting was a *
                    bunch of sanitized, remorseful 
                      boohooing. They were thinking about 
                    dropping the book.

                                    BECKETT
                    And now?

                                  CASTLE
                    Now that Cynthia s murder is all 
                    over the media, they re back on 
                    board, as long as the book has a 
                    more sensationalized point of view. 
                          (then, by way of example)

                    Shocked a Nation.

                                    BECKETT
                    Catchy. So now that Cynthia s out 
                    of the way, Lee Wax is sitting on a 
                    potential best-seller.

                                  CASTLE
                    People have killed for a lot less.

      Beckett s phone rings and she answers it.

                                    BECKETT
                    Beckett.
                          (listens, then)
                    Okay, bring him in.

      Beckett hangs up and hands the notes back to Castle.

                    Adam Pike s alibi fell apart. He 
                    called in sick to work on Tuesday 
                    night, so we got a warrant to search 
                    his house. They found a Metro-North 
                    train schedule in the trash.

      Adam Pike is at the table, lacking all of his earlier 
      bravado. Beckett sits across from him.

                                  ADAM
                    I didn t kill her. I didn t even 
                    know where she was.

                                    BECKETT
                    We re not gonna get anywhere if you 
                    keep lying to me. I know you went 
                    to Westchester.
                          (and then)
                    I spoke with Cynthia s husband. He *
                    remembers seeing a guy just like 
                    you outside his house a few weeks 
                    before the murder. 
                          (and then)
                    Don t make me put you in a lineup.

      Castle watches Beckett question the young man.

                                  ADAM (THROUGH THE GLASS)
                    I just... wanted to talk to her.

                                    BECKETT (THROUGH THE GLASS)
                    How did you find her?



                                  ADAM
                    That writer. The way she kept talking 
                    about what happened to my dad, she 
                    knew things only someone on that ship 
                    could have known. So, I started 
                    following her around. Eventually, she 
                    led me to Cynthia Dern. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Why didn t you call the police?

                                  ADAM
                    Because I wanted to look her in the *
                    eye. I wanted to tell her that none *
                    of it mattered. Her blood money 
                    wouldn t buy our forgiveness.    CASTLE Ep. 108 "Ghosts"    Full Blue Draft     1-27-09        40.

                    Money? What money?

                                    BECKETT (THROUGH THE GLASS)
                    What do you mean,  blood money ?



      Adam looks away, reluctant. Then he shakes his head.

                                  ADAM 
                    After I found out where Cynthia 
                    lived, I went and told my mom. I *
                    didn t know if we should call the 
                    Feds or what. She started to cry. 
                    She said we couldn t do anything.
                          (beat)
                    She told me we ve been getting 
                    money every month since the 
                    bombing. Different amounts. 
                    Sometimes more, sometimes less. But 
                    every month.

                                    BECKETT
                    She thought the money was coming *
                    from Cynthia Dern?

                                  ADAM
                    In the first envelope there was a *
                    note,  Please forgive me.  Susan 
                    Mailer was dead and Swanstrom was in 
                    prison. There wasn t anybody else.*

                                    BECKETT
                    You know, with evidence like that, 
                    they might have been able to track 
                    Cynthia down years ago. 

                                  ADAM
                    Mom said without the money, we 
                    wouldn t have made it. She figured 
                    as long as Cynthia was free, the 
                    money would keep coming. *
                          (and then)*
                    If I couldn t afford to turn her *
                    in, why would I kill her?*

                                    BECKETT
                    Why did you lie to me about where *
                    you were on Tuesday?          CASTLE Ep. 108 "Ghosts"    Pink Draft      1-28-09        41.


      Adam looks away. Weighs his options. Realizes he has none.

                                  ADAM
                    Because I was there. At the SRO. I 
                    followed her. I was just going to 
                    talk to her. I walked up and down the *
                    hallway for an hour, trying to get up *
                    the courage to go and knock on that *
                    door, y know? I was going to, but *
                    then someone got off the elevator and 
                    knocked on her door instead.

                                    BECKETT
                    You saw her killer?

                                  ADAM
                    I m not sure. I didn t get a good 
                    look, but I heard them talking and I 
                    can tell you one thing.

                                    BECKETT
                    What?

                                  ADAM
                    It was a woman.



      Castle realizes he was right.

      Adam Pike reacts to the strange knocking. Beckett just shakes 
      her head, as we...

      Lee Wax and Beckett sit across from each other. Castle leans 
      against the wall.

                                  LEE
                    Murder? Are you people crazy?

                                    BECKETT
                    I have an eyewitness who can place 
                    you at the SRO where Cynthia was 
                    found dead.

                                  LEE
                    Then your eyewitness needs to have 
                    their eyes examined.

                                  CASTLE
                    You had motive, means, and 
                      opportunity.

                                  LEE
                          (to Castle)
                    Please. Only a novelist could come 
                    up with a twist this absurd. 

                                  CASTLE
                    No more absurd than killing a woman 
                    to salvage your publishing contract. 
                    Drowning her in motor oil gave you 
                    just the ending you needed.

                                  LEE
                    You know, now I can see why your 
                    books are so popular, Mr. Castle. 
                    You have such a fanciful mind. But 
                    see, I m a true crime writer, and I 
                    don t have your talent for fiction.*

                                    BECKETT
                    The publisher was about to drop *
                    your contract. 

                                  LEE
                    Yes, because I told them I thought 
                    Cynthia was lying. 
                          (and then)
                    She may have fooled her husband and 
                    her suburban girlfriends, but I m a 
                    reporter. She wasn t fooling me.

                                    BECKETT
                    You re saying her remorse wasn t 
                    genuine?

                                  LEE
                    When Cynthia cried, it was for 
                    herself, not for Captain Pike or 
                    Susan Mailer. She cried for the 
                    good life she was giving up. 
                    Cynthia wanted to cash in and keep 
                    herself out of jail, that s it.

      A look between Castle and Beckett.

                                    BECKETT
                    She had to have felt some 
                      responsibility for what she d done. 
                    She sent money, year after year, to 
                    the Pike family. 

                                  LEE
                    What money?

                                  CASTLE
                    Every month since the bombing, the 
                    Pikes have been getting an envelope 
                    full of cash, courtesy of Cynthia 
                    Dern.
                          (and then)
                    But there s nothing about that in 
                    your notes.

                                  LEE
                    Because she never told me. Are you 
                    sure?

                                    BECKETT
                    We re sure.

                                  LEE
                    I don t know why she didn t tell me, *
                    but she must have had her reasons. *
                    Cynthia had a habit of altering the *
                    truth to suit her needs.

                                    BECKETT
                    That s an understatement.

                                  LEE
                    Look, the Tuesday that Cynthia was 
                    murdered, I was out to dinner with 
                    my publisher until after midnight.

                      I couldn t write her lies anymore. *
                    I was gonna walk away. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Beckett is on her computer as Castle stands nearby, studying 
      the murder board plastered with Cynthia Dern notes, *
      clippings, and photos.

                                  CASTLE
                    Remind me if I ever decide to write 
                    a memoir, that I should never write 
                    a memoir.

                                    BECKETT
                    Okay.

    A long moment while he waits for her to ask,  Why not?  
      Beckett sighs; gives in.

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    Why not?

                                  CASTLE
                    Because memoirs are about the 
                    truth, and I m not a particularly 
                    truthful person. It would be too 
                    easy to make myself look good. 

                                    BECKETT
                    It might be harder than you think.

                                  CASTLE
                    Maybe. But I d sure start with the 
                    most generous thing I ever did. 

      This is on Beckett s mind as well...*

                                    BECKETT
                    You mean, like how you sent money 
                      anonymously to your victims, *
                    because you felt so terrible about 
                    what you d done?

                                  CASTLE
                    The object of Cynthia s memoir was *
                    to gain sympathy. What s more *

                                    BECKETT
                    It doesn t make sense that Cynthia *

                    happened that night when her own *
                      ghostwriter didn t even trust her?*          CASTLE Ep. 108 "Ghosts"    Pink Draft      1-28-09        46.


                                  MAYOR
                    Markway s right. What do we 
                    actually know about what happened?

                                    BECKETT
                    Not much. According to Lee Wax s 
                    notes, Captain Pike heard two women *
                    arguing just before the explosion. *
                    Cynthia claims she was trying to *
                    change Susan s mind.*

                                    CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY*
                    Fold. But if we assume Cynthia s *
                    lying... *

                                  MAYOR
                    Then maybe it was Susan who wanted *
                    to save Pike, and Cynthia who 
                    wanted to run. Raise twenty. 

                                  CASTLE
                          (getting into it)
                    Right! But they d already set the 
                    bomb. Their three minutes were 
                    ticking away-

                                  JUDGE MARKWAY
                    The girls argue, wasting precious 
                    seconds-

                                  MAYOR
                    Susan runs back toward the ticking 
                    bomb to try to shut it down-

                                    CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY
                    While Cynthia runs for cover-

                                  CASTLE
                    But it s too late. Just as Susan 
                    gets to the bomb...

                                  MAYOR
                    Boom. 

      Beckett can t help but be amused at how completely caught up 
      the guys are in this game of speculation. Castle throws in 
      some chips, calling.

                                  CASTLE

                    Yeah, well you might want to think *
                    up some chips for the pot,  cause *
                    it looks like it s just you and me.*

      Beckett looks at her cards, looks at her chips. She knows *
      she s got him. She looks at him stone-faced and then... *
      Tosses away her cards.*

                                  BECKETT*
                    Sorry, fellas. It s just not my *

                    She d be older now.

                                  SUSAN
                    It sounds na ve now, but everything 
                    I did back then, I did because I 
                    thought it would help. I never 
                    wanted to hurt anyone.

                                    BECKETT
                    You re not here because of the *
                    bombing, Susan. You re here because *
                    of what you did to Cynthia Dern.

      Susan doesn t respond.    CASTLE Ep. 108 "Ghosts"    Full Blue Draft     1-27-09        53.


                                  CASTLE
                    Her body was found in a tub full of 
                    motor oil.
                          (off Susan)
                    But you already knew that. Because 
                    you put her there.

                                    BECKETT
                    Forensics is going over that room 
                    as we speak, Susan. Believe me, 
                    they will find something. A 
                      fingerprint. A fiber. Something 
                    that connects you to Cynthia s 
                    death. This is your chance to tell *
                    us your side.*

      Then, quietly...

                                  SUSAN
                    She should have just left it all 
                    alone... She had a husband, a good *
                    life. *
                          (beat, then)
                    But that wasn t Cynthia. Once she 
                    decided on something, well, you 
                    just better not be in her way.

                                  CASTLE
                    Like that night on the tanker... 

      Susan looks at Castle, sees he knows the truth.

                                  SUSAN
                    I saw the captain go below deck. I 
                    don t know how he got back on the 
                    ship without us seeing... 
                          (and then)
                    The bomb had already been set. 
                    Cynthia said there wasn t time to *
                    go back. We fought. She said we *
                    should run, but I couldn t just let *
                    him die... I tried, but I was too 
                    late. When the bomb exploded, I was 
                    thrown overboard. 

      She touches her face.

                    I can still feel the heat on my 
                    skin... even today.

                                  SUSAN
                    A friend took me in, a med student, 
                    and nursed me back to health. I got 
                    a new identity.

                                  CASTLE
                    And Mary Wright was born.

                                  SUSAN
                    It isn t hard to live like a ghost 
                    when everyone you love thinks 
                    you re dead. I never contacted *
                    anyone from my former life, not *
                    even my parents...*

                                    BECKETT
                    But you did send money to the Pike 
                    family.

                                  SUSAN
                    They had a son, and medical 
                    bills... I was responsible. 
                          (and then, miserable)
                    We all had to live with what we d *
                    done. Everything could have stayed *
                    the way it was, except...

                                  CASTLE
                    Except Cynthia decided to write a 
                    book.

                                  SUSAN
                    That reporter, Lee Wax, put up a 
                    post on an environmental board 
                    wanting info on Cynthia. I emailed 
                    her, pretending to be an old friend 
                    of  the group.  It didn t take long 
                    to realize she d found Cynthia, and 
                    that Cynthia was lying about what 
                    happened on the ship. 
                          (shaking her head)
                      I couldn t let her get away with it. 
                    After everything we d done to the 
                    Pikes... the very least she owed 
                    them was the truth about that night.

      Susan looks away, quelling the feeling of betrayal.

                                    BECKETT
                    You tracked her down. You 
                      confronted her.    CASTLE Ep. 108 "Ghosts"    Full Blue Draft     1-27-09        55.


                                  SUSAN
                      I threatened to turn myself in if she 
                    went through with the book. Give 
                    myself up and tell the authorities 
                      everything. She begged me to meet her 
                    first. Somewhere we could talk. 

                                  CASTLE
                    That s when you rented the room?

                                  SUSAN
                    Cynthia rented it, not me. It was 
                    all part of her plan.

                                    BECKETT
                    Her plan?

                                  SUSAN
                    Her plan to murder me. 

      Castle and Beckett exchange a look.

                                  SUSAN (CONT D)
                    When I got there, she poured me a 
                    drink.  Let s toast to old 
                    friends,  she said. Only, you see, *
                    I don t drink.
                          (remembering)*
                    She was acting so strange. I tried *
                    to leave, but she wouldn t let me, *
                    so I hid in the bathroom. That s *
                    when I saw it. The tub, full of 
                    oil. Then, I understood. 

                                    CASTLE*
                    She hadn t planned to talk to you. *
                    She planned to kill you and make it *
                    look like a suicide. That wine was *
                    laced with a sleeping pill. You *
                    were supposed to drink it, and then *
                    drown in the oil.

                                    BECKETT
                    It would look to the world like you *
                    were wracked with guilt about the 
                    Pikes all these years. That you *
                    finally decided to end your life.

                    Once your body was discovered, the 
                    public would be clamoring for the

                      I couldn t let that happen.

      Susan looks away, recalling it...

                                  SUSAN (CONT D)
                    We struggled. I pushed her away from 
                    me. She lost her balance and fell 
                    against the sink... She hit her head. 
                          (and then)
                    I should have called for help. But *
                    I just wanted it to be over. So I 
                    dragged her to the tub, and I... I 
                    pushed her in. 
                          (tears)
                    You see, I was already dead. I just 
                    wanted to keep it that way.

      Off Castle and Beckett...

      The room is relatively empty; it s late as, in the background, *

                    I could, but then I keep thinking

                                  LEE
                    What does that mean?

                                  CASTLE
                    All those people from Cynthia s past 
                    that you interviewed... How did you 
                    manage to let every one of them know 
                    you were in contact with her?

                                  LEE
                    Did I do that?*

                                  CASTLE
                    With Adam Pike, I figured you were 
                    just sloppy. With Jared Swanstrom, 
                    I thought maybe you were trying to 
                    get a rise out of somebody. But 
                    when Susan Mailer told us she 
                    emailed you claiming to be an old 
                    friend of Cynthia s, and in only a 
                    couple of back-and-forths with you, 
                    she figured it out, too...?

                                  LEE
                    What are you implying?

                                  CASTLE
                    That you were hoping someone would 
                    put two-and-two together and call the 
                    cops. You wanted Cynthia in prison, 
                    so you could tear up the contract you 
                    had with her and write the book the 
                    way you wanted. Not a memoir. A true 
                    crime. With an ending that would sell 
                    more books. But you couldn t call the 
                      authorities yourself. What kind of 
                    story would that be?

                                  LEE
                    It s a lovely theory. But even if 
                    it s true, I didn t kill Cynthia. I 
                    didn t even do anything illegal.

                                  CASTLE
                    It s not illegal, it s just slimy.

                                    CASTLE*

                    Pride. Or clothing.*

                                  BECKETT*
                    I think I have some gummy bears.*
