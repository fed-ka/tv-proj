The glory of stratospheric dawn.
The engines of a silver
Lockheed U-2F rasp upon the trace oxygen here at 72,500 feet.
Scattered cloud formations hang over the blue brilliance of
sea far, far below.
In the haze, the looming edge of land.
SUPER: FLIGHT G-3101. OCTOBER 14TH, 1962. OVER CUBA.
The spy plane's CAMERA DOORS whine open.
The glassy eye of
the 36-inch camera focuses.
And then with a
BANGBANGBANGBANG, its high-speed motor kicks in, shutter
flying.
MATCH CUT TO:
A pair of massive FILM CANISTERS unlock and drop from the
belly of the U-2.
TECHNICIANS secure them in orange carrying
cases, lock them under key, fast and proficient.
They whisk
them out from under the spy plane.
The Technicians run for an idling Jeep.
They sling the cases
into the rear of the vehicle which in turn accelerates away
hard, curving across the runway for another waiting plane.
SMASH CUT TO:
A U.S. Navy truck lurches to a stop in front of the run-down,
brick-faced seven-story Steuart Building on 5th and K.
Rear
doors BANG open, and out hop two MARINE GUARDS, side arms
drawn, film canisters in a carrying case between them.
SUPER:
NATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHIC INTERPRETATION CENTER
(NPIC), WASHINGTON D.C.
As the Marines approach the building, front doors SLAM open.
A black Lincoln pulls away from the modest white house on a
tidy Washington D.C. residential street.
The car threads its way through the Washington traffic, past
the big administrative buildings, down tree-lined avenues,
takes a turn into a gate.
As the car stops at the gate, the
CAMERA flies past, revealing it's the gate to the WHITE
HOUSE.
SMASH CUT TO:
Kenny, in business suit and tie, trots up the steps, and a
MARINE GUARD snaps the door open for him.
Kenny heads down the steps with New York Times Washington
Bureau Chief, SCOTTY RESTON. Anonymous, they weave their way
through the crowd for a police car on a side street.
RESTON
How's my favorite President?
KENNY
Busy.
But you've got his heart.
RESTON
I want an hour with him.
KENNY
I said his heart, not his attention.
RESTON
Three weeks before midterm elections?
You need me.
KENNY
Well.
There is a new civil rights
initiative he wants to talk about.
RESTON
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt.
I hear
Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
Kenny just sighs as they make their way up to the police car.
A Secret Service Agent opens the door for him, another is
behind the wheel.
KENNY
We're giving the Brits Polaris instead.
But a story'll just aggravate things.
Scotty stares at Kenny, determined.
Kenny looks away.
And
his eye catches a tall, willowy BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
She is
talking, excited, embarrassed, to two more SECRET SERVICE
AGENTS.
What they're saying is lost in the noise.
Scotty follows Kenny's gaze.
Then the two men share a look,
a silent understanding.
Kenny glances at the Secret Service
guy holding the car door, tilts his head at the woman.
KENNY (CONT'D)
Not today.
He's got tight schedule.
The Agent nods, heads for the other Agents and the Beautiful
Woman.
Scotty acts like nothing has happened.
RESTON
Pretending there isn't a problem won't
fix it.
He can clear the air on Anglo
American relations.
KENNY
Forget it, Scotty.
RESTON
Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan
look good, I print it, the British
public likes it, Macmillan owes you.
The formula's exactly what Kenny wants to hear.
He pretends
to consider, pretends to cave as he gets in the car.
KENNY
All right, you're in.
Half hour.
Reston's won.
But so has Kenny, and he's made Scotty feel
tough in the bargain.
People like Kenny.
The White House casts long shadows this gorgeous October
morning.
Blue sky; the first flash of color in the trees.
SUPER: TUESDAY, OCTOBER 16TH, 1962.
DAY 1.
The sweltering Cuban countryside.
Shouting SOVIET ROCKET
TROOPS, stripped to the waist, glistening with sweat, machete
a clearing under scattered, limp palm trees.
LUNDAHL (V.O.)
Our analysis at NPIC indicates the
Soviet Union has followed its
conventional weapons build-up in Cuba
with the introduction of surface-to
surface medium-range ballistic missiles,
or MRBMs.
Our official estimate at this
time is that this missile system is the
SS-4 Sandal.
We do not believe these
missiles are as yet operational.
A bulldozer TEARS through the undergrowth.
FILLING THE
SCREEN.
A 70-foot long MISSILE TRANSPORTER creeps along in
the bulldozer's wake like a vast hearse with its shrouded
cargo.
SCHEMATICS slapped down on a camp table.
A group of Soviet
site ENGINEERS point and gesture as they study their ground
from a shaded hillock.
CLEARING CREWS and SURVEYORS work and
sweat in the distance.
GENERAL TAYLOR (V.O.)
GMAIC estimates ten to fourteen days.
However, a crash program to ready the
missiles could cut that time.
Kenny and Bobby follow the President down a path through the
Rose Garden.
The shock of the morning has worn off.
The
President stops, looks at them.
THE PRESIDENT
I don't think it's going to matter what
Khruschev's intentions are.
I tell you,
right now... I don't see any way around
hitting them.
A long moment of silence as they move along again.
KENNY
If we hit 'em, kill a lot of Russians,
they'll move against Berlin.
They
attack Berlin, that's NATO... and we're
at war.
The guys stop again.
The autumn day is bright, warm, alive.
The air, the distant city sounds derail the relentless train
of logic for a beat.
And in their faces we see that all
three men, for the first time, feel the enormity of war, its
shadow over everything.
It's only a couple of steps away.
Steps that they're seriously contemplating.
BOBBY
Damned if we do, but if we don't, we're
in a war for sure somewhere else in six
months.
Pained, the President turns away.
THE PRESIDENT
No choice.
This is going to cost lives
any way we go.
Do nothing, and it could
be 80 million
of ours.
We have to get
rid of those missiles.
KENNY
There've got to be alternatives to just
going out and bombing them.
BOBBY
He's right, Jack.
Taylor is saying we
may have some time.
We've got to use
it.
THE PRESIDENT
So if there are alternatives that make
sense - and I'm not saying there are -
we need 'em.
Need 'em fast.
BOBBY
What about the allies?
Congress?
I
think we may need to start letting key
people know.
And they're all scattered
across the country for the campaign.
We're going to need to get the U.N.
staff in and warmed up.
Jesus... I
don't even know if we've got secure
communications with half our embassies
since that the Soviets got that
cryptographer of ours.
THE PRESIDENT
We can't worry about everything right
now.
We've got to figure out what we're
going to do before we worry about how we
do it.
KENNY
The other thing is...
BOBBY
... I know.
CIA and the military fucked
us on the Bay of Pigs.
KENNY
They're going to be pressing for a
military solution soon.
We can't afford
to let them ram their agenda down our
throats.
We need to come with options
other than air strikes so we have some
sort of choice here.
BOBBY
We got a bunch of smart guys.
We lock
'em up together in there, kick 'em in
the ass til they come up with options.
Kenny and the President look at him.
Bobby nods.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
I'll do it.
KENNY
(to the President)
It's too politicized with you in there,
anyway.
They need to be able to stick
their necks out.
BOBBY
It'll be the principals, a couple of the
key guys from each department: the
Executive Committee of the National
Security Council.
We'll call it EXCOM.
Kenny snorts a laugh.
Bobby shoots him a cross look.
KENNY
EXCOM.
Has a ring to it.
Like F-Troop.
The President stops.
Bobby and Kenny stop, too.
THE PRESIDENT
Okay.
Kenny and I only show for the
meetings you call us into.
Impress us.
And do it fast.
(to Kenny)
You're in charge of keeping this quiet.
If word gets out before we know what
we're going to do, there'll be panic.
And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if
we decide to hit them.
KENNY
Then we need to do a few things right
away.
No Pierre.
He knows, the press
knows.
You're going to have to keep up your
schedule - your movements are followed
too closely.
And we need to get these
guys out of the White House.
George
Ball's got a conference room at State.
(to Bobby)
Reconvene over there this afternoon,
come back here tonight.
Bobby nods.
BOBBY
I think we should bring in Dean Acheson.
He was fighting Soviets while we were
still working the wards in Boston.
The President nods his approval.
Looks at Kenny.
THE PRESIDENT
Find him, Kenny.
We're going to need
all the help we can get.
GROUND LEVEL.
Where the brilliantly-lit flag flutters over
the spotlit White House: their destination.
An F-100 Super Sabre stands under lights on a taxiway.
The
CAMERA DESCENDS FROM ITS OVERHEAD SHOT, discovering the
aircraft's sleek cockpit, menacing tiger-jaw paint job, the
four 20mm cannons on its nose.
GENERAL SWEENEY (V.O.)
Due to the tropical foliage, the OPLAN
calls for high-explosive and napalm
loadouts for our ground attack sorties.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
The FLIGHT LINE where a full strike wing stands beyond this
plane, pylons laden with weapons, GROUND CREW servicing them.
SUPER: WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 17TH.
DAY 2
A LONG SHOT of an ENORMOUS CROWD thronging a bunting-trimmed
platform.
The President, barely recognizable at the
distance, and a cluster of political VIPS wave from it,
smiling.
Kenny steps INTO FRAME, back here at the fringes of the
crowd.
THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)
Doesn't anybody in Connecticut have to
work today?
The crowd goes nuts.
Kenny paces, checks his watch,
impatient to be done with the necessary diversion.
Kenny
gazes off to his right and spots Scotty Reston, along with
half the White House press corps suckered along.
Scotty
catches Kenny's look.
Kenny turns away, but Scotty comes weaving over.
The
President continues on, but all we hear is Scotty and Kenny.
RESTON
Kenny!
What happened?
They didn't let
me up front, said the President was on
the phone the whole time.
KENNY
He was.
RESTON
Yeah?
Who was he talking to?
Acheson?
Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering
what's going on.
What's Acheson doing
in town?
And don't give me some
bullshit about DNC think tanks.
Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
KENNY
Why don't you ask him yourself?
You can
have him on the way home.
RESTON
I'm giving you a chance here: talk to
me.
You can influence how this thing
unfolds.
But Kenny stands there, mute.
Reston just shakes his head,
knowing for sure something's up.
He turns and heads back for
the press corps.
Kenny and the President climb the stairs to the Presidential
plane, the crowd cheering him.
He gives a final wave.
THE PRESIDENT
Let's get out of here.
KENNY
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire
White House Press Corps for a day.
SUPER: SATURDAY, OCTOBER 20TH.
DAY 5
The President emerges from the hotel, a HAT on his head.
The
Press and a CROWD surge forward, crying out for the
President's attention.
Kenny slides into the limo first as
the President waves to the crowd.
Salinger waits on the sidewalk, and after the limo pulls
away, the Press pushes in on him.
Pierre's face is pale -
he's just been told everything.
SALINGER
The President has a cold.
He is
cancelling the remainder of this trip
and is returning to Washington on the
advice of his doctor.
A SOVIET FREIGHTER churning its way south.
MCNAMARA (V.O.)
There are between 20 and 30 Soviet ships
underway to Cuba at this time.
The CAMERA races along its side, discovering TARPULINED
OBJECTS on deck, and on its stack, the RED HAMMER AND SICKLE.
MCNAMARA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
800 miles out, the navy will stop them,
board, and any vessels containing
weapons will be turned back.
CUT TO:
The Destroyer U.S.S. JOHN R. PIERCE putting out to sea,
SAILORS racing over its deck, through hatches to its 5-inch
gun turrets.
The ship races by, AMERICAN FLAG streaming from
its stern distaff, FILLING THE SCREEN, WIPING TO:
Kenny, Bobby, and the President lean on the railing of the
Truman Balcony, stare out at the city.
BOBBY
Goddman Stevenson.
Jesus.
Peace at any
price.
You'd think nobody learned
anything from World War Two.
THE PRESIDENT
Somebody had to say it.
I respect Adlai
for having the guts to risk looking like
an appeaser.
BOBBY
We have to pull him.
He's not going to
be able to handle the Soviets in front
of the U.N.
Zorin will eat him alive.
THE PRESIDENT
We've got bigger problems right now.
KENNY
We have to try the blockades.
It
probably won't work.
It may just be
delaying the inevitable.
But we can't
just go to war without trying not to.
THE PRESIDENT
I don't know.
I don't know.
He stares out at the Ellipse where a little-league football
game sweeps across the grass, the shouts and screams of the
CHILDREN, so alive, floating to them on the wind.
A crowded D.C. party spills out of Jim Rowe's house onto his
patio.
Kenny steps INTO FRAME.
He looks at the PARTYGOERS,
the Washington social set.
He stands out, oppressed by the
knowledge he's unable to share.
He takes a stiff drink.
Suddenly out of the house totters Adlai, highball in hand.
Glassy-eyed, he grins at Kenny and joins him.
ADLAI
Just can't get away from you guys.
Escaping for a night on the town, eh?
KENNY
As the town's most popular playboy, the
President felt my presence would be
sorely missed.
So in the interests of
National Security...
Kenny shrugs.
Adlai takes a long drink, closes his eyes.
ADLAI
Gotta keep up appearances.
Of course, I
don't care anymore.
I'm a political
dead man.
You ever seen a man cut his
own throat like I did today?
Kenny has no answer to that.
He looks down, pained for
Adlai.
ADLAI (CONT'D)
Well, it's all right.
(beat)
I came to tell you, just talked to a
friend.
Reston and Frankel have the
story.
It's going to run tomorrow.
SUPER: MONDAY, OCTOBER 22ND.
DAY 7
A DEAFENING WHINE.
And INTO FRAME yawns the enormous
spinning mouth of a B-52 bomber jet engine.
It closes on us,
sucking us in like a maelstrom, but at the last second the
CAMERA SLIPSTREAMS OVER IT --
-- carrying us over the aircraft's wing.
The CAMERA pivots
and the vast war machine crawls away underneath joining --
-- a long LINE of identical behemoths, in single file inching
down a taxi way which vanishes into the distance.
As the
plane's immense vertical tail WIPES OUR VIEW:
The CAMERA races toward a spotlighted concrete emplacement,
over the immense BLAST DOOR which is sliding open, and DOWN --
The dark ocean, whitecaps whipping luminous around the
aircraft carrier, U.S.S. ESSEX and her escorts.
Running
lights flash red and green.
The carrier's SIREN begins a lonely, eerie WOOP WOOP WOOP
WOOP like some immense creature which has lost its mind.
The
ship FILLS THE SCREEN, CUTTING US INTO:
The first B-52 trundles to a stop at the end of the runway.
It begins to throttle-up, the ROAR of its engine mounting...
THE PRESIDENT (V.O.)
...unmistakable evidence has now
established the fact that a series of
missile sites is in preparation on that
imprisoned island.
The purpose of these
bases can be none other than to proved a
nuclear strike capability against the
Western Hemisphere...
-- AND DROWNING OUT the President's speech as the plane
lurches forward, down the runway into the night.
The Titan solo door GRINDS OPEN.
And the missile inside
begins to rise into the white bath of the crossed spotlights.
THE PRESIDENT (V.O.)
Therefore, in the defense of our own
security and under the authority of the
Constitution, I have directed that the
following initial steps be taken.
First, to halt this offensive build-up,
a strict quarantine --
The President's words conjure the ESSEX battlegroup, its
destroyers plunging through heavy seas, lit up in the night.
THE PRESIDENT (V.O.)
-- on all offensive military equipment
under shipment to Cuba is being
initiated.
All ships of any kind bound
for Cuba, if found to contain cargoes of
offensive weapons, will be turned back.
Second: I have directed the continued
and increased close surveillance of Cuba
and its military build-up.
Should these
offensive military preparations
continue, further action will be
justified --
A flight of F-4 PHANTOMS drops INTO FRAME, lights flashing.
THE PRESIDENT (V.O.)
-- I have directed the Armed Forces to
prepare for any eventualities.
-- the voice of the Essex battlegroup: sparkling, alive, a
constellation of lights scattered across the sea.
One by one
the escort ships answer the carrier's SIREN with their own
wailing cries, an alien chorus among the ships, disappearing
and reappearing in the swells.
The communication crescendos
to its fever pitch --
-- and then the battlegroup goes to blackout.
Like a dying
universe, the answering sirens cut off, the life-lights wink
out, and an appalling darkness falls across the sea...
FADE OUT
BLACKNESS, LIKE BEFORE A CURTAIN RISES.
And then a
flickering: a FLUORESCENT LIGHT COMES ON.
A ship's boat full of Marines lowers away, hits the water,
engine spraying as it launches forward - in dress rehearsal.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON (V.O.)
An inspection party will then board and
search the ship.
If weapons are found,
the ship will be ordered to leave the
quarantine area or be towed into port
upon refusal.
A CART speeds down the flight line past the waiting F8U-1P
Corsairs.
One by one, the four pilots accompanying Ecker and
Wilhemy jump off to mount their planes.
The cart still
moving.
ECKER
Get that fuel assayed?
WILHEMY
Yeah.
It sucks.
Ain't for high
performance babies like ours.
Shoulda
brought some from home, but what can you
do?
Last-second deployments...
Wilhemy jumps off, then they're at Ecker's plane, and he
jumps off.
Too late to worry about bad fuel now.
He hoists
himself up and into the cockpit of the sleek navy jet.
The Crusaders swing around in pairs at one end of the runway,
and then the first two throttle-up, flaps down, and drop
their brakes.
The machines LUNGE forward like duelling drag
racers.
The FILL THE SCREEN, blow past.
The six Crusaders, in pairs, streak over the buildings and
streets of Key West.
And in a heartbeat, cross the beach and
are out to sea.
And already on the horizon, the low clouds and dark line of
land.
Cuba.
Ninety miles away.
The two planes with bad fuel pull wingovers to their left,
head for the airfield in the distance.
The four remaining
planes streak over the ocean.
There are no more small craft
this far out in the strait.
The last two Crusaders streak over the surf, a white wake of
spray in their jetwash, and cross the beach with a boom.
The planes dip and rise with the green tropical contours,
taking us on a sickening roller-coaster ride over Cuban
countryside at treetop level.
Palm forest, roads, can fields, more palm forest race by.
And then, ahead, a large clearing.
ECKER (O.S.)
Warm 'em up.
We're here.
Cuban ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNNERS shout as they traverse their 40mm
guns in their sandbagged emplacement.
The low rippling
thunder of the incoming jets becomes an earsplitting ROAR...
and the Crusaders blast out over the clearing.
The anti
aircraft guns open up.
TRACERS lace the air between the two planes as they blast
over the missile site.
Over trailers.
Over tents.
Over
trucks.
Over trenches.
Over bulldozers.
And then they're out over forest again.
It's all over in
seconds.
The triple-A stops.
In unison, the two planes bank
right, heading for the distant blue, blue sea.
Ecker jumps down from the cockpit ladder and turns an eye to
his battered, pock-marked plane.
Wilhemy and the GROUND CREW
CHIEF come running up, the Chief letting out a whistle.
GROUND CREW CHIEF
Lookit what daddy done brung home.
WILHEMY
You shoulda seen it, Chief, they --
ECKER
-- damn sparrows.
Must've been
migrating.
Guess I hit a couple
hundred.
(to Wilhemy, stern)
How many did you hit, Bruce?
Wilhemy stands there, looking at Ecker, not sure what to make
of him.
The Crew Chief just starts laughing as more
impressed GROUND CREW come up.
WILHEMY
A few.
I guess.
GROUND CREW CHIEF
Was them 20 or 40 million sparrows?
Ecker, sweat-plastered and foul, steps into the Chief's face.
ECKER
Those are bird strikes.
Sparrows to be
precise.
Got a problem with that?
The Chief stands there, glances at the plane one more time,
and shakes his head, 'No.'
Ecker takes the Chief's
maintenance clipboard from him, writes in big bold marker:
BIRD STRIKES.
He thrusts it back into the Chief's hands and
walks off; the astonished Wilhemy remains behind.
Kenny, bundled in an overcoat, steps outside the North
Entrance.
The cool air invigorates him.
He eyes the fence,
Pennsylvania Avenue beyond it, seeming to isolate this world
from the living city beyond.
He starts for the main gate.
A WHITE HOUSE POLICE OFFICER jumps up as Kenny approaches.
POLICE OFFICER
Would you like me to call a car, Mr.
O'Donnell.
Kenny checks his watch.
KENNY
How long will it take to get someone up?
POLICE OFFICER
Fifteen minutes, maybe.
To your house,
sir?
Kenny considers, shakes his head.
He wants to go home,
but...
KENNY
No.
No, I'll let her sleep.
Let 'em
sleep.
Kenny says it with a certain finality.
The Police Officer
nods, and Kenny wanders out through the gates, shouldering
the weight of the world.
Kenny makes his way down a sidewalk not far from the White
House.
A 24-hour drug store's doors are open.
He pauses.
Inside, a knot of PEOPLE - late-night deliverymen, a cop, the
store employees - talk in undertones at the counter.
Behind
it, a T.V. is signing off with the national anthem.
Sober
voices, sober looks.
Kenny moves on.
A cluster of COLLEGE STUDENTS talk at a news stand.
They're
waiting for the NEWSIE to cut the bands of the next day's
Washington Post, the bundles just being thrown to the
sidewalk from the delivery truck.
Kenny approaches.
In their thing beards, counter-culture clothes, the kids seem
so young, Kenny so old.
Kenny buys a newspaper, its dire
headlines, every story about the crisis.
Kenny, newspaper under his arm, continues down the street.
Up ahead, the lights are on in a Catholic Church.
Lines of
CHURCHGOERS are at the door.
Kenny stops, surprised at the
sight this late.
And then he sees the hand-painted banner:
CONFESSIONS 24 HOURS.
PRAY FOR PEACE.
Kenny is moved.
He glances over his shoulder, and then...
joins the line himself.
-- between the destroyer, U.S.S. Pierce and the SOVIET
FREIGHTERS Gagarin and Kimovsk.
The Pierce's bridge wings
are crammed with helmeted OFFICERS and LOOKOUTS.
They peer
through binoculars at the distant ships, plowing ahead,
straight for them.
The CAPTAIN lowers his binoculars,
determined.
CAPTAIN
Helm, shape heading for intercept, zero
one zero.
All ahead full --
OFFICER (O.S.)
-- new contact!
New contact!
Everyone whirls to the bridge.
The Captain steps forward.
Lookouts peer across the water at the oncoming Soviet
Freighter.
BINOCULAR POV:
Of the Soviet Bridge, where their LOOKOUTS are staring right
back through their binoculars.
Kenny, Bobby and the President make their way across the
lawn, out of earshot of the building.
BOBBY
What happened to speak when spoken to?
KENNY
Give it a rest.
You were thinking the
same thing, just didn't have the guts to
take the heat.
Bobby likes getting under Kenny's skin.
Bobby aims a punch
at his head which Kenny knocks away.
The President changes
gear, serious.
THE PRESIDENT
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on
ships.
But it doesn't get us any closer
to removing those missiles.
KENNY
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll
back down on the real issue too.
BOBBY
We're going to have to stop a ship
eventually, show the quarantine's got
teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
THE PRESIDENT
McNamara's on his way back here now.
We
need to pick the right ship.
No subs.
No armed boarding parties either.
We
need a little more time to figure this
one out.
KENNY
Then let's move the quarantine line.
It's a simple suggestion.
The President considers him a
beat, and then McNamara emerges from the White House, heads
for them.
The three friends assume their more reserved,
political faces as he comes up.
MCNAMARA
Mr. President.
Bobby.
Kenny.
The
Essex battle group has the Gagarin,
Kimovsk and the sub escort under their
thumb.
We've got a few hours now before
we need to worry about any more
flashpoints on the line.
(beat)
We could use a few more hours.
I think
we should consider moving the quarantine
line back to 500 miles.
Bobby and the President look at Kenny like he's some kind of
Svengali.
Kenny just stands there, poker faced.
SUPER: THURSDAY, OCTOBER 25TH.
DAY 10.
The West Wing looms behind Kenny and Bundy.
Kenny, poker
faced, takes a drag on his cigarette.
Bundy nervously flicks
his, looks away from Kenny a beat.
BUNDY
What did you think of Lippman's column
this morning?
KENNY
I think it's a bad idea.
Bundy turns back to him.
BUNDY
Thank God.
Look, everyone is furious
about it.
We trade away our missiles in
Turkey and we're fucked politically.
Kenny grinds his jaw, but doesn't say anything.
He agrees.
Bundy steps up to him, confiding.
BUNDY (CONT'D)
You gotta stop 'em.
We know it's Jack
and Bobby's idea - they leaked it to
Lippman.
The military guys are going
ape, and they're not alone.
KENNY
Then they should speak up.
BUNDY
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that
easy.
KENNY
Yes it is.
BUNDY
No it isn't.
They don't trust the
people that feel this way.
But these
people are right.
And the Kennedys are
wrong.
(beat)
We need you to tell 'em, Kenny.
They'll
listen to you.
Kenny prickles, intense, but Bundy presses on, too wrapped up
in his own thinking to notice.
BUNDY (CONT'D)
Jack and Bobby are good men.
But it
takes a certain character, moral
toughness to stand up to --
KENNY
-- You listen to me.
Nobody, nobody,
talks about my friends that way.
You're
fucking here right now because of the
Kennedys.
They may be wrong.
They make
mistakes.
But they're not weak.
The weak ones are these 'people' who
can't speak their own minds.
BUNDY
You know I don't mean they're weak.
Kenny gets in his face, intimidating.
KENNY
No, they just lack 'moral toughness.'
And you think I'll play your Judas.
You
WASPS and blue-bloods never understood
us, thinking we want into your club.
Well we got our own club now.
(beat)
And you guys don't realize fighting with
each other is our way.
Nobody plays us
off each other.
And nobody ever gets
between us...
The Soviet Tanker, Groznyy, breasts the heavy seas.
Armed
CREWMEN race along the deck to makeshift sandbagged
emplacements in the bow.
MCNAMARA (V.O.)
We lost track of it yesterday at
nightfall.
We thought we gave it plenty
of room when we moved the quarantine
line back.
We just reacquired it.
The CAMERA PANS to the left, revealing a U.S. DESTROYER
racing up alongside a few hundred yards away, pounding up and
over the swells, punching up a huge fan of spray from its
bow.
The Destroyer's forward 5-inch twin guns swivel, train on the
Groznyy.
A beat.
They OPEN FIRE with an ear-splitting
BAMBAM, ripping the air in front of the muzzles, the Groznyy
so close a miss isn't possible.
The Destroyer's guns hammer away at the Groznyy, at point
blank range... but the Groznyy IS UNHARMED.
Suddenly, in the air above it appear BRILLIANT FLARES.
They
light up the ship, brighter than the sun.
The destroyer
isn't firing deadly rounds... it's firing harmless
starshells.
A long, black car stops at the end of Kenny's driveway.
The
door opens, and Kenny steps out.
He says an inaudible
goodnight to the driver, and the car pulls off.
He turns,
facing the white two-story house with the neat front yard,
the lights out.
And he smiles.
Home at last.
A screen door squeaks open.
Kenny steps out into the
darkness of the back yard.
And there, in her robe, sitting
startled on a lawn chair, lit only by the dim glow of the
kitchen window, is Helen.
Kenny stands there tired, his coat
slung over his shoulder.
KENNY
Hi.
Helen rises, her own care-worn face turned to his.
For a
silent moment they gaze at each other, searching in the lines
of each others' face for the changes of a long separation.
They see them.
But they've been married a long time, and the
awkwardness passes.
HELEN
Hi, O'Donnell.
You look old.
Kenny drops his coat on a table as Helen comes up and folds
herself into his arms.
HELEN (CONT'D)
This job's going to kill you.
If I
don't first.
They kiss, comfortable.
But not too long, and he lets her
go.
She looks at him again, sees he's suppressing a smile.
HELEN (CONT'D)
If you're home it means either Jack and
Bobby have finally figured out what a
con man you are and fired you, or --
KENNY
-- we got a back channel communication
from Khruschev this evening feeling us
out about a deal.
He confirmed it just
a little while ago in a letter to the
President.
I think we've won.
HELEN
A thing like this... who could even
think of winning?
The missiles site is now more than just dirt and clearing
equipment.
It's an armed camp, with missiles, fuel trailers,
erectors spaced every few hundred yards.
MISSILE TECHNICIANS
service the towering SS-4s.
LUNDAHL (V.O.)
The first missiles became operational
last night.
With a barrage of shouted orders in Russian, and a whine of
the ERECTOR's engines, THE MISSILE BEGINS TO RISE.
LUNDAHL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
We expect they'll all be operational in
36 hours: Monday morning.
It stops, vertical.
SMASH CUT TO:
A cart speeds down the tarmac, an NCO behind the wheel.
Beside him sits Major Anderson, his helmet on, visor up.
He
adjusts the mix on the oxygen bottle he's carrying at his
feet, breathing in preparation for the high-altitude flight.
Up ahead, among a host of service vehicles, sits the U-2.
The twilight, in-between, world of the stratosphere.
Far
below -- clouds, shining blue day.
Above, stars and the
indigo depths of space.
We hang in utter silence.
A silver glint appears in the center of the horizon.
It
grows larger.
Then larger still.
It is the U-2.
We barely
have time to register the rising hiss of its engines, when it
FILLS THE SCREEN and BOOMS PAST, leaving us standing still.
The CAMERA PANS to follow it, but it's already dwindled to a
speck, and we feel how fast 600 miles an hour really is.
The belly door whines open like a silver eyelid, exposing the
camera's lense.
As the U-2 turns, far, far below, emerging from the clouds,
barely visible, rises a CONTRAIL.
It arcs lazily toward us.
A beat, and then another CONTRAIL.
Then ANOTHER.
The anti-aircraft missiles creating them are
too small to be seen with the naked eye.
The spy plane's long flimsy wings weren't made for
dogfighting.
They BEND terribly in the rollout.
And then
the first missile STREAKS past, tries to correct its miss,
but can't and vanishes into the distance at a 90-degree
angle.
The second missile's contrail rises up behind the plane,
levels off, and closes on it at a tremendous rate.
The third missile rises up in the far distance behind the
second.
The second missile races up on the U-2, closer, right behind
it, can't miss.
Then at a hundred yards, the contrail
suddenly peters out, and the missile, out of fuel, drops
away.
But the third missile closes.
The third SA-2 rides its billowing column of exhaust straight
for the tail of the U-2.
This one is not out of fuel.
And the missile looms.
We have time to realize it's almost
as big as the plane itself before it SHEARS right into the U
2's tail and EXPLODES in a BLINDING FLASH.
Kenny puts on his jacket as he goes down the steps into the
bright autumn day, walking away from the White House.
It
drops behind him -- his step is faster, more urgent.
Kenny walks down the sidewalk, drawn toward the Ellipse.
The
sixth grade FOOTBALL PLAYERS sweep forward with a running
play.
Kenny scans them, searching, his breath coming hard.
He reaches the edge of the open field.
And then he spots the
name on the jersey: O'Donnell.
It's Kevin. The players
relinquish the ball and the offense comes off the field.
Kevin sees his dad.
KEVIN
Hey!
Dad!
Kenny manages a smile as Kevin trots over.
Kevin pulls his
helmet off.
They stand there a long beat, Kenny desperate to
take him up, abandon his post... but he doesn't.
KENNY
Hey, sport.
You winning?
KEVIN
Yeah.
But Kevin sees the turmoil in his father's face.
KEVIN (CONT'D)
Is everything going to be okay, Dad?
Kenny's forced smile is answer enough.
KENNY
Yeah, Kev.
Everything's gonna be fine.
But Kevin knows.
Together they know.
The end of the world
is at hand.
KEVIN
I guess you won't be coming home
tonight.
KENNY
I, uh...
Suddenly a car HONKS.
Kenny turns around.
Bobby is leaning
out the rear passenger window of his limo.
And he sees what
Kenny is doing.
He doesn't want to cut in, but has to.
BOBBY
Kenny!
We need to talk.
Kenny looks back at his son.
KENNY
Get back out there, kid.
Remember to
hit 'em hard.
KEVIN
What about you?
Where are you going?
KENNY
Back to work.
Kevin puts his helmet back on his head.
Kenny watches as
Kevin jogs off to rejoin his team.
Kenny turns his back on
his son, and strides for Bobby's limo, dying inside.
Kenny and Bobby stand by their car off to one side of the
restaurant's parking lot.
Bobby's Secret Service Agents
maintain a discreet distance.
KENNY
If we're going to make a deal, we're
going to have to do it fast.
This is
only getting out of control.
The only
reason we're not at war this very minute
is he's been able to stretch, bend and
break his own rules.
He won't be able
to keep it up forever.
Bobby jams the last bit of sandwich in his mouth.
A beat.
Kenny looks him in the eye.
BOBBY
And?
KENNY
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in
Turkey.
BOBBY
The Jupiters are obsolete.
They were
supposed to have been dismantled last
summer anyway --
KENNY
-- Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
I told you
how stupid it was to float the Lippman
article!
But you wouldn't listen to me.
What if there hasn't been a coup at all?
What if it's you two who invited that
second letter by raising the possibility
of a trade?
Bobby is speechless with rage.
KENNY (CONT'D)
And if the two of you are thinking this
trade is your ace in the hole, you're so
wrong.
It's a deuce.
Bobby's beyond furious.
They catch their rising voices.
KENNY (CONT'D)
And it's not just me who thinks that.
Everyone on this so-called EXCOM is
telling you exactly the same thing: make
the trade, and they're going to force us
into trade after trade until finally
they demand something we won't trade
like Berlin, and we do end up in a war.
(beat)
Not to mention, that long before that
happens, this government will be
politically dead.
Bobby simmers for a long beat, thinking.
And boy, does this
guy hate admitting he's wrong.
BOBBY
All right, so maybe we overestimated how
reasonable this trade would look.
Okay?
You happy?
So now what?
KENNY
So now you've got to talk him out of it.
And then we've got to figure out an
acceptable political solution.
BOBBY
And if there has been a coup and there
is no acceptable political solution?
Kenny stares off at the city, agonized.
A LONG SHOT: Bobby emerges from the West Wing in his
overcoat, briefcase in hand.
He pauses, tiny, alone.
The
West Wing - and all its imposing spotlit power behind him -
reduced to this insignificant man on his eleventh-hour
mission.
And then, out of the shadows, in the f.g., steps Kenny in his
own coat, his breath frosting in the late-night air.
Bobby
sees him, and knows he is not so alone anymore.
ON THE DRIVEWAY
They meet in front of the limo.
Bobby stops, shuffles his
things, awkward.
BOBBY
What do you want?
A good-bye kiss?
Kenny opens the driver's side door.
The Secret Service LIMO
DRIVER peers out.
LIMO DRIVER
Hey, Kenny.
KENNY
Hey, Joe.
Listen, I'll take care of
him.
Go ahead in, grab some coffee.
We'll be back pretty quick.
LIMO DRIVER
You sure?
Kenny's nod and look -- there's no arguing.
The Limo Driver
hops out, and Kenny gets in.
Bobby stands there outside for
a beat.
He tries to hide how touched he is, but can't
completely.
KENNY
What's the matter with you?
Forget how
to open a car door?
The limo wheels out into the street, carrying the two friends
into the darkness.
THE CAMERA lifts away from the limo, turning toward the
Embassy, past the Guards, past the brass plate which reads
EMBASSY OF THE UNITED SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS, up and up
to the roof where black, reeking SMOKE billows from all of
the Embassy's several chimneys.
The CAMERA races into it.
It engulfs us all.
Kenny squeals the limo up to the curb in front of the Justice
Department.
The doors fly open, and Kenny and Bobby jump
out, head up the steps to the building.
Floodlights illuminate MISSILES, vertical on their erectors,
support VEHICLES, clustered across the man-made clearing.
Mask-wearing Technicians wave a FUEL TRUCK back to the
nearest missile.
Clouds of toxic VAPOR rise from the others.
They've already been fueled.
BOBBY (V.O.)
They are a vital threat to my country.
If launched, they would kill 80 million
Americans.
SMASH CUT TO:
-- onto the portico.
Standing there in the dark, by the
white neoclassical pillars of the cloister, are Bobby and the
President.
They're holding drinks.
Kenny joins them.
The President gestures out across the South Lawn to the
gleaming Washington Monument.
THE PRESIDENT
We were just debating who had it worse,
us or George Washington and his guys.
BOBBY
He didn't have to worry about nuclear
weapons.
THE PRESIDENT
Yeah, but the country didn't even exist
as a country yet.
It was a mess, and he
didn't have a leg to stand on.
KENNY
All he had was his character.
The President and Bobby nod at the justice of that remark.
BOBBY
How does a guy get a rep like that?
THE PRESIDENT
Doesn't matter to me.
If I went down in
history like Adams, I'd die happy.
All
they say about him today is --
KENNY
-- he kept the peace.
Kenny looks at the President.
The President feels it, and
gazes back to him.
The three of them stare out at the glittering city.
The
grandness of the world lies before them, and they are
deciding its fate, and are humbled by the awfulness of it.
The silence is beyond power.
And for a long moment, they know not to disturb it.
There is
nothing left to say.
The President, at last, finishes his
drink.
THE PRESIDENT
You know, we never did control it.
Not
really.
Not like we think.
He looks at Kenny.
Kenny nods.
He knows that now too.
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
But we did our best.
Now it's up to
them.
Kenny's limo pulls away, leaving Kenny, coat in hand, at the
bottom of his driveway.
He watches it go, silently urging it
to return for him with some call from the President telling
him he's desperately needed.
But it doesn't.
He turns to his house.
The lights are all out.
He notices he's CLUTCHING the handle of his briefcase.
His
knuckles are white.
With conscious effort, he unfolds his
hand, letting the briefcase drop on the driveway.
He stands alone, stripped of his friends, his family, his
job... and in that moment, mute, impotent in the shadow of
Armageddon, Kenny is our Everyman of the Nuclear Age.
THE CHURCH BELLS TOLL in raucous celebration.
Kenny, Helen
and the five O'DONNELL KIDS join the throng packing through
the doors to the church.
They're all smiling except Kenny
who searches fro faces in the CROWD.
And then he spots Bobby with his FAMILY.
Bobby grins at him.
That makes Kenny grin back.
RADIO MOSCOW (O.S.)
This is Radio Moscow.
Moscow calling.
But Kenny keeps looking.
RADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
The following statement is the text of a
letter from General Secretary Khruschev
to President Kennedy.
Kenny spots him emerging from the Presidential limo,
surrounded by Secret Service Agents - John Kennedy.
His
FAMILY also is with him.
RADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
...I regard with respect and trust the
statement you made in your message of 27
October 1962 that there would be no
attack, no invasion of Cuba, and not
only the part of the United States, but
also on the part of the Western
Hemisphere, as you said in your same
message.
Then the motives which induced
us to render assistance of such a kind
to Cuba disappear...
Kennedy, greeting well-wishers, a brilliant smile on his
face, is carried through the crowd toward Kenny and the doors
of the church.
RADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
...it is for this reason that we have
instructed our officers - these
missiles, as I already informed you are
in the hands of Soviet officers to take
appropriate measures to discontinue
construction, dismantle them, and return
them to the Soviet Union.
the base has been half-dismantled over night.
Fuel trucks
pull away, lumping down the makeshift dirt road.
Across the
site missiles are lowered, their nose cones being removed.
A MISSILE on its transporter, Technicians crawling all over
it, COVERING IT with a tarp.
A massive Soviet Helicopter's rotors thunder as it lifts off,
cargo crates swaying under it, a CLOUD OF DUST FROM ITS WASH
FILLING THE SCREEN, WIPING US TO:
