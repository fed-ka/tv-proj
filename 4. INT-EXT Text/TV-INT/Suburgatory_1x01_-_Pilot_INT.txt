      A LONG LINE OF MOMS stand in line at the grocery store. They 
      busy themselves by checking items off their to-do lists, 
      sanitizing their hands, inspecting their produce, adjusting 
      their ponytails...

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    It s like the Million Mom March.  
                    The place is crawling with them.



      A MALL MOM strides out of FOREVER 21 with her TEENAGE 
      DAUGHTER and her TEENAGE FRIENDS.  They are all laughing and 
      loaded down with shopping bags.

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    They re in the malls...



      A CONCERT is in progress.  A GROUP OF TEENAGE GIRLS wearing 
      concert t-shirts SCREAM and SING ALONG to the music.  Behind 
      them, a GROUP OF THEIR MOMS do the same.

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    They re at the Lady Ga-Ga 
                      concerts...



      Tessa s father, GEORGE, late 30 s, glances sideways at his 
      daughter from the driver s seat.

                                  GEORGE
                    They re people, okay?  Just like 
                    you and me.

                                  TESSA
                    Are you kidding?  That dog has 
                    nicer hair than I do.

      ON A GOLDEN RETRIEVER lounging happily on the grass.  Its 
      blonde mane gleams in the sunlight.

                                  GEORGE
                          (looking)
                    There s no way that s his natural 
                    color.

      George cracks a half-smile at Tessa.  She doesn t smile back. 

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    Things had been a little tense 
                    between us since the unauthorized 
                     search and seizure  Dad conducted 
                    in my room.                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/20103.



      Tessa sits on her bed watching George RANT and RAVE about the 
      BOX OF CONDOMS he is holding, that he found in her drawer.

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    The truth is, they weren t even 
                    mine.  They belonged to my best 
                    friend Lucas, who yes, is a guy, 
                    but no, is not someone I was having 
                    sex with.  But dad was judge and 
                    jury.  And totally paranoid.  So I 
                    was sentenced to three years in 
                      Suburgatory.



      Tessa lays in bed.  Her eyes slowly flutter open.

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    The next morning, I was startled 
                    awake by an unfamiliar sound.  
                    Silence.  



      George bolts upright in bed, having a similar reaction.  He 
      crosses to his bedroom window and opens it.  Listens. 
      Nothing.  No car alarms, no garbage trucks, no yelling cab 
      drivers.  He looks across the street. Sheila is at it again, 
      watering her lawn.  She WAVES at George.  George WAVES back.                                 (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/20105.


                                  SHEILA
                          (calling)
                    Tell your wife I m going to drop 
                    off a pot-roast later!

                                  GEORGE
                          (calling back)
                    I don t have a wife!

      George s words ECHO across street.  He winces.  He hadn t 
      quite meant to broadcast that information.  George WAVES and 
      closes his window abruptly.

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Crap.



      George hustles to get coffee.  Tessa sits at the breakfast 
      table with a highlighter pen, reading a book entitled  HOW TO 
      BECOME AN EMANCIPATED MINOR. 

                                  GEORGE
                          (noticing)
                    Ha ha.  That s very funny.

      Tessa doesn t look up.  Instead, she HIGHLIGHTS a passage, 
      quietly.

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Okay.  Time to get going.  You ve 
                    got a big day ahead of you.  New 
                    school.  New friends.

                                  TESSA
                    Yeah, I m not here to make friends.  
                    I m just gonna serve my time and 
                    get out.

      George clenches his jaw.  Tessa s such a piece of work.

                                  GEORGE
                    Guess you d better hurry and join 
                    the other inmates, before the 
                    warden marks you late.

      Tessa dog-ears the page she was reading and closes the book.

                                  TESSA
                          (calmly)
                    Which reminds me.  There are no 
                    subway stations, so I won t be 
                    taking the R train.  
                                  (MORE)                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/20106.

                                  TESSA (CONT'D)
                    I don t have a car.  Or a license.  
                    So how, praytell, am I going to get 
                    to school?

                                  GEORGE
                    Aha!  I m glad you asked! Follow 
                    me.

      George grabs his coffee mug and leads Tessa to the GARAGE.  
      There, amongst the boxes and clutter, is an OLD RETRO BIKE 
      modeled after the ones from Amsterdam. It has a big wicker 
      basket on the front.

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Tada!

      Tessa looks at George.

                                  TESSA
                     Tada  is when something good 
                    happens.

                                  GEORGE
                    Oh come on!  It s cool.  What do 
                    you think?

                                  TESSA
                    I think it looks like something I 
                    would ride to go pick up my 
                      Metamucil--

                                  GEORGE
                    Stop it.

                                  TESSA
                    I don t even know how to ride a 
                    bike, George.

                                  GEORGE
                    Don t call me George.  And that s 
                    gonna be one of the fun suburban 
                    things we do together!  But for 
                    today, you re gonna have to walk.  
                    I have a consultation on a remodel 
                    right after my breakfast at the 
                    Country Club.

                                  TESSA
                    Breakfast at the country club?  Do 
                    you realize that any street cred 
                    you had just disintegrated with 
                    that very sentence?                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/20107.


                                  GEORGE
                    I m sure it sounds a lot fancier 
                    than it is.



      George enters, self-consciously drinking his cucumber-lime 
      water.  He scans the busy BREAKFAST ROOM with his eyes.  
      There, at a window table, is his college buddy, NOAH WERNER 
      also late 30 s.  He is too tan for the season with white 
      teeth and professionally tousled hair.  He talks to his 
      office via Bluetooth, while thumbing through  Men s Health.  

                                  NOAH
                    So let her come at four.  Is it 
                    just a consultation?  Okay, that s 
                    fine.  And block out the rest of my 
                    day.
                          (noticing George)
                    Gotta run.  My breakfast is here.

      Noah stands to greet George.

                                  GEORGE
                    I m your  breakfast? 

                                  NOAH
                    You re my breakfast meeting, you 
                    snide bastard.  Good god, George.  
                    You re pale as a corpse.

                                  GEORGE
                    And you, antithetically, are the 
                    color of a Nerf ball.                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/20108.


                                  NOAH
                       Antithetically.   Listen to you.  
                    You must never get laid!

      The men sit down and look at the MENU in silence.

                                  GEORGE
                          (finally)
                    Eggs.

                                  NOAH
                    Yeah.
                          (then)
                    So you did it.  You finally took 
                    the plunge!  How many years have I 
                    been trying to convince you?  And 
                    now, here you are.  A suburbanite!

                                  GEORGE
                    A martyr, is more like it.  
                    Honestly, I did it for Tessa.  She 
                    needs this.  Cleaner air.  Better 
                    schools.  She s special, you know?

                                  NOAH
                    Special, like retarded?

      Georges stares at Noah.

                                  GEORGE
                    No, special like special.

                                  NOAH
                    Oh, totally!  Yeah.  No, she really 
                    is.

                                  GEORGE
                    Besides, there s less trouble for 
                    her to get into out here.

                                  NOAH
                          (smiles)
                    She was getting into trouble?

      George rolls his eyes.

                                  GEORGE
                      Constantly hanging out with this 
                    group of boys.  All boys.  And this 
                    one kid, Lucas, was always at our 
                    place.  The whole thing drove me 
                    crazy.  I kept asking her, can t 
                    you make a few girlfriends?

                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    She insisted it was all completely 
                    platonic.  But then I found 
                    condoms.

                                  NOAH
                          (teasing)
                    That little gang-banger...

                                  GEORGE
                    Don t even joke!  I m sure if it 
                    was your kid you wouldn t be 
                    joking.

      A CUTE WAITRESS approaches.  She takes special notice of 
      George as she deposits the bread basket on the table.

                                  NOAH
                    Are you kidding? I would jump for 
                    joy if Jenna hung out with some 
                    boys.  Got into some trouble.  I 
                    would do a freakin  backflip. All 
                    that kid cares about is school.  
                    She s a bookworm!  I used to make 
                    fun of kids like her.
                          (then)
                    I told you she got into Brown?

                                  GEORGE
                    Yeah.

                                  NOAH
                          (pause)
                    Early acceptance?  

                                  GEORGE
                    Yeah, I know.  You told me.

                                  NOAH
                    Anyway, I predict this move is 
                    gonna be great for you two.  Tessa 
                    will straighten her act out.  And 
                    that displaced New Yorker bit of 
                    yours is gonna kill out here.  
                    You re like an exotic import.  
                    You re a Bugatti!  Do you see the 
                    way our waitress is looking at you?  

      Noah nods at the Cute Waitress who is lingering a few paces 
      away. George looks over at her.  She LIGHTS UP and jogs back 
      to their table eagerly.

                                  PRETTY WAITRESS
                    Did you need me?  Well not  need 
                    me  but want me?

                                  PRETTY WAITRESS (CONT'D)
                    I mean, in a food service way?  
                    Wow!  Stop talking.  I m Jocelyn 
                    and I m your server.  Would you 
                    gentleman care to hear the 
                    breakfast specials?  We have a 
                    Benedict Florentine today, which is 
                    very good, a little rich, honestly 
                    it upset my stomach.  I would stay 
                    away from it.  Let me get you some 
                      fresh-squeezed OJ to start.

      She retreats to her waitress station, clearly flustered and 
        embarrassed. 

                                  NOAH
                    See how nervous you made her?  It s 
                    your urban edge.

                                  GEORGE
                    I doubt it. Besides, chasing some 
                    waitress with irritable bowel isn t 
                    exactly on the top of my to-do 
                    list.  

                                  NOAH
                    What is?

                                  GEORGE
                    Finding the right influences for 
                    Tessa.

                                  NOAH
                    Sounds like a pretty boring list.

                                  GEORGE
                    Come on, Noah.  Think about my dad.  
                    Think about your dad.  Everything 
                    we learned about being men, we 
                    learned from them.  Tessa has no 
                    one around to teach her how to be a 
                    woman!  In the city, her only 
                    female influence was Gladys.

                                  NOAH
                    Who s Gladys?

                                  GEORGE
                    The homeless tranny that lived 
                    outside the bagel shop.

                                  NOAH
                    Well, lucky for you, the suburbs 
                    are brimming with upstanding women.  
                    Like our waitress, Jocelyn.

                    So after you bang her... find out 
                    if she s willing to drive carpool.



      She opens the door to find George standing there.  He takes 
      in the lavish foyer.

                                  DALLAS (CONT D)
                          (slight drawl)
                    Hi, I m Dallas!  You must be 
                    George?  The architect?

                                  GEORGE
                    Wow, that is not a good way to 
                    answer the door. 

                                  DALLAS
                    Beg pardon?

                                  GEORGE
                    You just supplied me, a perfect 
                    stranger, with all the information 
                    I need.  

      Dallas stares at George.

                                  DALLAS
                    All the information you need for 
                    what?

                                  GEORGE
                            (bewildered)
                    I can just say  Why, yes! I am 
                    George, the architect.   Then I can 
                    step inside your beautiful foyer  
                    and violate you.

      Dallas takes a long sip from her Redbull.

                                  DALLAS
                    So are you an architect?  Or a

                    I m an architect.

                                  DALLAS
                    Oh, good.  Then come on in.

      George follows Dallas inside the house and up the stairs.  ON 
      THEIR BACKS as they go--

                                  DALLAS (CONT D)
                    You make a real strange first 
                      impression, George.

                                  GEORGE
                    Sorry.  I m... from New York.



      George and Dallas enter the bedroom of her teenage daughter.

                                  DALLAS
                    This is Dalia s bedroom.  She s my 
                    princess.

      George surveys the opulent pink and gold room.  The closet is 
      bursting with clothes.  There are pictures of Dalia 
      everywhere, along with prize ribbons and pageant trophies.  

                                  GEORGE
                          (pointing)
                    She s a thoroughbred.

      Dallas smiles.

                                  DALLAS
                          (grandly)
                    I want to put a skylight over the 
                    place where she slumbers.  

      George thinks for a moment.

                                  GEORGE
                    You mean her bed?

                                  DALLAS
                          (nods)
                    That way, in the morning, the sun 
                    will beam down upon her.  And come 
                    evening?  The moon will bathe her 
                    in its milky glow.

      George sits down on Dalia s bed.                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/201015.


                                  GEORGE
                          (re: mattress)
                    Wow.  Seriously?

                                  DALLAS
                    It s a Tempurpedic.  
                          (then)
                    So what do you think about the 
                    skylight?  From a design 
                      standpoint?

                                  GEORGE
                    From a design standpoint?  
                      Completely superfluous.  From a 
                    parenting standpoint?  Very sweet.  
                    You would give anything to make 
                    your daughter happy.  I get it.

                                  DALLAS
                      I breast-fed for sixteen months.

                                  GEORGE
                    I don t have breasts.  Tessa drank 
                    formula.

                                  DALLAS
                    That sort of thing creates a bond, 
                    you know.  And there is no greater 
                    bond than that between a mother and 
                    her daughter.

      George s smile FADES.  

                                  GEORGE
                    I sure hope that s not true.

      Dallas sits next to George on the mattress.

                    George, if there s anything I can 
                    do to help.  It must be hard 
                    raising her all on your own.

                    I m grateful for the dinner, don t 
                    get me wrong.  But I think what 
                    Tessa really needs doesn t come in 
                      a slow-cooker.  She needs this.  
                    Motherly love.  And maybe some of 
                    this girly stuff. To be honest, 
                    that s part of the reason I moved 
                    her out here.

                                  DALLAS
                    Well, the girly stuff is nothing 
                    one trip to the mall can t fix.

                    She would kill me for asking you 
                    this-- but do you think maybe we 
                    could tag along with you sometime? 
                    I don t know much about malls.

                                  DALLAS
                    Are you kidding?  That would be 
                    great!  What about today after 
                    school?

                                  GEORGE
                    I mean, if it s not an imposition. 
                    I think it would be really good for 
                    Tessa.

      DALIA ROYCE, 16, with flat-ironed hair and undersized 
      clothing, stands next to Tessa, giving her the head-to-toe. 
      Dalia s gaze rests on Tessa s clunky MOTORCYCLE BOOTS which

      Tessa sits inside the HANDICAP STALL with her feet up, 
      reading her  Emancipated Minor  book.

                    It had its own sink.  Natural 
                    lighting.  An exposed brick wall.  
                    In Manhattan, the  handicap 
                    bathroom  would have leased for 950 
                    a month. I stayed there for the 
                    better part of the morning and all 
                    through lunch.

      Tessa reaches for her juice box, perched on the window sill. 
      She loudly SIPS what s left, still consumed in her reading.

      OUTSIDE THE STALL -- Dalia and her FLUNKEYS enter.  They size 
      up LISA SHAY, 15, with lots of frizzy hair, who is working  
      on her appearance in the mirror by the sink.

                                  DALIA
                    Well, because you can grow a 
                    mustache and he can t.

      Dalia s flunkeys crack up laughing.  The BELL RINGS calling 
      the students back to class.  Dalia and her girls EXIT heading 
      off to class.  Lisa fights back tears as Tessa emerges slowly 
      from the stall.

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    I had not intended to make any new 
                    friends.  But Lisa Shay reminded me 
                    of this stray dog I once found, but 
                    couldn t keep, because our building 
                    didn t allow pets.  

      Lisa is REALLY SOBBING now.  Her face is all blotchy and her 
      chin is quivering like crazy.  She WIMPERS softly to herself.

                    was blotchy.  And clearly, she 
                    needed me.

      Tessa puts a hand on Lisa s knee.

                                  TESSA (CONT D)
                          (softly)

                                          ACT THREE



      Dallas and Dalia eagerly sift through racks of naughty school 
      girl clothes.  Lots of tiny plaid shirts shown with super-
      short pleated skirts.  Tessa watches in horror.

                                  TESSA
                    For several hours, I was held 
                    against my will at what can only be 
                    described as the most demoralizing 
                    place on earth.  Or as it s known 
                    to the layman: Abercrombie and 
                    Fitch.

       Dallas holds up a tiny pair of SHRUNKEN DENIM SHORTS.  

                                  DALLAS
                    Ohmigosh!  How cute are these 
                       boyfriend  shorts?

      Tessa looks at them, skeptically.

                                  TESSA
                    I mean, whose  boyfriend  are we 
                    talking about?  Really?

      Dalia holds up a tiny skirt.

                                  DALIA
                    This will show off my belly ring.

                                  TESSA
                    You know what else it will show 
                    off?  Your vagina.

      George approaches in a cold sweat.  He is clearly having an 
      adverse reaction to the mall environment.

                                  GEORGE
                    Are the lights really bright in 
                    here?  I feel like there s less 
                    oxygen, somehow...

      Dallas turns George by the shoulders.                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/201022.


                                  DALLAS
                    Go get yourself a snack from the 
                    food court and sit down on that dad 
                    couch over there.

      Dallas points to a couch filled with DADS eating and looking 
      at their PHONES.

                                  GEORGE
                    Oh.  Okay.  Tessa, do you want 
                    anything?

                                  DALLAS
                    She certainly does not!  We don t 
                    gorge on snacks before we try on 
                    clothes.  That s girl 101.

                                  GEORGE
                     Girl 101.   Got it.  Okay.  I will 
                    sit down on that dad couch and just 
                    stay out of the way. 
                          (then, grasping)
                    Let the ladies do they thang.

                                  TESSA
                    Great.  If you run into my dad, 
                    tell him I hate it here and I want 
                    to go home.



      Dalia and Tessa are both dressed like  nordic nymphos  in 
      short skirts, shrunken fair isle sweaters.  Dalia wears fuzzy 
      platform boots with pom-poms.  Tessa still rocks her black 
      boots.  They stare at their reflections in the mirror. 

                                  DALIA
                    That s so lame your mom died, 
                    biyotch.

      Tessa turns to Dalia.

                                  TESSA
                    My mom didn t die.  She s just... 
                    gone.                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/201023.



      YOUNG TESSA, 11, sits on the floor eating a bowl of cereal 
      and watching the TV SCREEN intently.  

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    Dad did the best he could to 
                    explain things...

                                  YOUNG TESSA
                          (turns to her dad)
 What s the movie called again?

                                  GEORGE
                     Kramer Vs. Kramer. 

      George makes a  shush  sign and points back at the screen. 
      Keep watching.  Young Tessa turns back around and does.

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    And that was pretty much the only 
                      explanation I ever got.



      Dalia examines her split ends in the mirror.

                                  DALIA
                          (doesn t care)
                    So you turned lez to get back at 
                    her?

                                  TESSA
                    What?  How would that get back at 
                    her?

      A KNOCK on the dressing room door.

                                  DALLAS
                          (calling, sweetly)
                    Tessa?  Sweetheart?  If you need 
                    any help in there or you have any 
                    questions or you feel lost or 
                    confused or you just need a hug-- 
                    let me know.  I m right outside 
                    this door.  And I m not going 
                    anywhere. 

      Tessa rolls her eyes.                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/201024.


                                  TESSA
                    I know why we re doing all this.  
                    It s because your mom feels sorry 
                    for me.

      Dalia adjusts her skirt so that her belly ring shows.

                                  DALIA
                    No, it s because my mom wants to 
                    bone your dad.

                                  TESSA
                          (thinks)
                    Doesn t she bone your dad?

                                  DALIA
                    Doubt it.  They ve slept in 
                    separate bedrooms for, like, ever. 
                    If I ever have a marriage that s a 
                    total sham just put a bullet in my 
                    head.

                                  TESSA
                    Are you sure?  Because, I will...

      Dalia smirks and struts out of the dressing room.

                                  DALLAS (O.S.)
                    Tessa?  Should we hit the shoe 
                      department? I d love to find you a 
                    nice, heterosexual dress shoe.

      Tessa stares at her reflection, miserably.

                                  TESSA
                    No thanks.  I m good.



      George drives home.  Dallas sits in the passenger seat, 
      checking herself out in the mirror.

                                  GEORGE
                    So that was fun.  Was that fun?

      George glances in the REARVIEW MIRROR. Dalia has headphones 
      on and is listening to music.  Tessa is reading her book on 
      becoming an Emancipated Minor.

                                  DALLAS

      George pulls up in front of his house.

                                  GEORGE
                    Thanks again, you guys.  That was 
                    really great.  Right, Tess--

      George turns to see Tessa is no longer in the car.  She is 
      racing up the path with her shopping bags.

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    I was home-free.  Or so I thought.  
                    I had no idea it was an ambush.  

      Sheila Shay seems to come out of nowhere holding an enormous 
      cast iron POT.

                                  SHEILA
                    Hola, neighbor!  I m just gonna set 
                    this pot-roast down on the steps 
                    while we have some girl talk!

      Sheila drags Tessa across the street by the arm.  As they 
      pass the Jaguar Dallas WAVES.

                                  DALLAS
                    Hi, Sheila!

                                  SHEILA
                          (waving back)
                    Hi, Dallas!  Put that roast in at 
                    350, George!  It needs another 
                    hour.  Covered!

      Sheila whisks Tessa inside her home and closes the door.

                                  DALLAS
                          (turns to George)
                    I told her to give Tessa some 
                    motherly love, like you said.

      George smiles weakly.

                                  GEORGE
                    Perfect.  Thanks.

                      Twenty-seven percent of kidnappers 
                    already know their victims.

      Tessa sits in Sheila s rumpus room with an untouched snack 
      tray in front of her.  Sheila smiles her face-cracking grin.

                                  SHEILA
                    If you need someone to talk to--

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    I could hear the police report now.  
                    Two counts of disingenuous smiling.  
                    One count of rancid snack.

                                  SHEILA
                    I d like that someone to be me.  
                    Whether it s concerns over an 
                    unusually heavy menstrual flow--

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    And three counts of unsolicited 
                      lecturing, on topics ranging from 
                    sanitary napkins to the importance 
                    of a good brassiere.

      IN THE BG-- Sheila s daughter, Lisa, does homework while 
      trying to go unnoticed.  Her older brother Ryan smiles at 
      Tessa as he grabs a DRINK from the spare REFRIGERATOR. 

                                  TESSA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    It s not like Sheila was doing such 
                    a bang-up job with her own kids.   
                    Her daughter, Geraldo, was 
                      completely neurotic.  And her son 
                    from the Escalade was probably 
                    going to be a serial killer...

                    Hey, Summer s Eve!  Go long!

      Ryan chucks a can at Tessa.  This time she catches it.



      Tessa and Jenna sit cross-legged on her bed.  Jenna hands 
      Tessa a ROLODEX.

                      differently.

      Other than the provocative advice, Jenna, 16, looks just like 
      you d expect her to.  Bookish, with a tidy haircut and small 
      wire-frame glasses.

                                  JENNA

                    Yeah, well, frankly, I m all talked 
                    out today, Jenna.  I just don t 
                    have your drive when it comes to 
                      academics. 

      Jenna reaches in her bag and hands Tessa a prescription box.

      George, Noah, Tessa and Jenna EAT POT-ROAST in silence.  Only 
      the sound of their forks and knives scraping against the 
      plates.

                                  GEORGE
                    So this is pretty nice! Tessa,

                    And suddenly that s what matters in 
                    life?  Meatloaf?

                                  GEORGE
                    Don t be ridiculous.
                          (then)
                    This is pot-roast.

      The group continues eating.

                                  NOAH
                    So, Tessa. I heard you had a pretty 
                    eventful first day.

                                  TESSA
                    Not as eventful as Dad s.  In spite 
                    of his busy schedule, he was able 
                    to contract a couple of loaner moms 
                    to give me advice I didn t want and 
                    handpick a couple of girls for me 
                    to be friends with that I can t 
                    stand.

      Tessa tries not to look directly at Jenna.

                                  TESSA
                    So what was it?  Charity work?

                                  GEORGE
                    Those moms were just trying to 
                    help.

                                  TESSA
                    Help what?

                                  GEORGE
                    Help you.

                                  TESSA
                    I don t need  help.  

                                  NOAH
                    Can I get a little more of the 
                    sauce?  The sauce makes it, don t 
                    you think?

      George angrily ladles some sauce onto Noah s plate.

                                  GEORGE
                    You know, Tessa, no one is 
                    expecting a  thank you  but a 
                    little gratitude would be nice.  I 
                    mean, you got motherly love and 
                    girl 101 and a whole bunch of rilly 
                    cute back-to-school clothes from 
                    A&F.

      Tessa stares at George, wide-eyed.

                                  TESSA
                    Oh my god, listen to you!  Are you 
                      delusional?  I didn t want any of 
                    those things!  And I certainly 
                    didn t want to relocate to the land 
                    of Frankenmoms and prescription 
                    drug abusers!

      This time Tessa looks directly at Jenna who drops her fork.  

                                  JENNA
                    God, Tessa.  Don t be so 
                      judgemental.

                                  GEORGE
                    Are you kidding?  That s the 
                    hallmark of her existence!                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/201032.


                                  TESSA
                    These kids are the ones who judged 
                    me.  Since we got here, I ve been 
                    labeled, ridiculed and bludgeoned 
                    with a can of Sugar-Free Red Bull.

                                  NOAH
                    I d kill for a Sugar-Free Red Bull.  
                    You don t happen to have--

                                  GEORGE
                    You re acting like this move was a 
                      punishment!

                                  TESSA
                    From my perspective, it is!

                                  GEORGE
                    Well, then maybe you should try to 
                    see it from my perspective.  
                    Because everything I do is for you.  
                    This whole move is about you!

                                  TESSA
                    Oh, don t kid yourself, George.  

                                  GEORGE
                    Stop calling me George--

                                  TESSA
                    This move isn t about me.  It s 
                    about you.  Your fear.  And your 
                    guilt. I knew you didn t trust me.  
                    I just had no idea that you didn t 
                    trust yourself.

                                  GEORGE
                    I trust myself.

                                  TESSA
                    Well, then call them off.  Call 
                    them all off.  Because I don t need 
                    a mom, okay?  I just need you to be 
                    my dad. 

      Tessa EXITS.  We hear her STORM up the stairs.  Her bedroom 
      door SLAMS SHUT.  Noah wipes his mouth.  Frowns.

                                  NOAH
                    Well.  On the down side, you re 
                    probably gonna need to re-hinge 
                    that door.  But on the bright side, 
                    you re definitely gonna have left 
                    overs.                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/201033.



      Tessa sits at the table eating cereal and reading her  
         Emancipated Minor  book.  WIDEN TO REVEAL George is also at 
      the table, eating cereal, and reading a book entitled:  IS 
      ADOPTION RIGHT FOR YOU?  

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    The next morning, we didn t speak.  
                    Instead, we expressed our feelings 
                    through passive-aggressive 
                    reference books. 

      The DOORBELL RINGS.  Tessa tosses her book aside and goes to 
      answer it.  It s LISA SHAY from across the street.

                                  LISA
                    My mom wanted me to bring you this 
                    pamphlet on the importance of 
                    regular, self-administered breast 
                    exams.  And this homemade cookie.

                                  TESSA
                          (taking the pamphlet)
                    Tell her I m not interested in the 
                    cookie. 

      Tessa starts to close the door.  Lisa stops her.

                                  LISA
                    My brother said he thinks you re 
                    cute.

                                  TESSA
                    Your brother s into  lesbians? 

                                  LISA
                    Look, I m sorry I wigged out on you 
                    in the girls room.  
                          (then)
                    It s rough in there, you know?

                                  TESSA
                    Yeah, actually.  I do.

      Lisa heads off.  Tessa looks down at the pamphlet.  

                                  TESSA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Maybe her mom did ask her to bring 
                    that pamphlet. But I knew it was 
                    something else.  An olive branch.                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/201034.



      The door is closed but the sounds of CONSTRUCTION are heard 
      from within.  HAMMERING, DRILLING, etc.  We CUT INSIDE THE 
      ROOM to see what George is doing.  

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    It wasn t a skylight.  But it was a 
                    sign.

      REVERSE ANGLE-- there, plastered on the ceiling, is an old 
      SUBWAY SIGN.  Specifically, the R train.  The same line she 
      rode to school every day.

                                  TESSA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ... a sign that he was trying to 
                    see things from my perspective.  
                    So maybe I could try too.


      Tessa lays on the couch.  Her leg is in a cast.

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    After the biking incident, there  
                    was no calling the moms off.  They 
                    couldn t help themselves.  It was 
                    like they smelled our blood in the 
                    water. 

      Sheila tells George how to reheat the ZITI she s holding.  

                                  SHEILA
                    350.  For about an hour.  Foil on.  

      ON GEORGE-- BLOODY and BANDAGED but listening diligently.

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    That s when I realized that it 
                    wasn t just me who was stuck in 
                      Suburgatory.  Dad was here too.

                    So I guess the two of us will have 
                    to learn how to navigate these mom-
                    infested waters.  Together.  

      Dallas attempts to put a knit BLACK BOOTIE on the foot with 
      the cast.  It looks just like Tessa s lesbian boot.  

                                  TESSA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And maybe I had judged the moms too 
                    harshly.  Maybe sometimes the 
                    smiles aren t phony.  And maybe, 
                      sometimes, beneath a pair of giant 
                    synthetic boobs... you can find a 
                    giant, non-synthetic heart.

      Tessa stares at Dallas  cleavage as she struggles to inch the 
      bootie higher on her foot.

                                  DALLAS
                    There.  How s that feel?

                                  TESSA
                    That feels... pretty good, 
                    actually.

                                        END OF SHOW                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/201037.
