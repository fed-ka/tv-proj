11INT. TARDIS - DAY

      REPEAT OF 3.13 SC.92.  THE TARDIS in flight.  THE DOCTOR
      walks around the console.  Deep in thought.  And then...

      EXPLOSION!  The Doctor's showered with debris!

      He's on the floor.  Coughing.  Smoke in the air.  He waves
      his hand to clear the air, looking up.  Gobsmacked.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    What?  But... what??

      FX: WIDE SHOT, the PROW OF A SHIP, an old-fashioned liner,
      now sticking through the whole of the right hand wall of
      the Tardis, filling half the space.

      The Doctor finds in the debris, a lifebelt.  He flips it
      over.  It says: TITANIC.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    What??! 

      (End repeat, new material.)  He leaps to his feet, slams
      away at the Tardis console.  Engines roar -
        DW4 - Ep X - Yellow

      FX: the prow of the ship withdraws through the hole.

        www.thewriterstale.com
      He slams more switches, the Time Rotor rising and falling,
      the sound of materialisation filling the air...
 
                                                                            CUT TO:

22INT. SMALL CUPBOARD - NIGHT

      Tiny, dark linen cupboard, just big enough for...

      FX: the TARDIS materialises.

      THE DOCTOR comes out, still brushing himself down.  Pats
      the Tardis, to make sure it's okay.  Then opens the cupboard
      door, steps out.

                                                                            CUT TO:

33INT. TITANIC RECEPTION, DECK 22 - CONTINUOUS

      THE DOCTOR steps into -

      Large space, reception desk, all wood & marble, more TITANIC
      signage, STEWARDS passing to and fro, and GUESTS in their
      finery, chatting, laughing.  It all looks very 1912... 
      almost.  It's part luxury-liner, part hotel.  And it's
      decked out for Christmas, nice big tree, nothing gaudy,
      all very period and classy.  The Doctor walks through...

      Men in black tie.  Ladies in posh dresses.  Staff looking
      immaculate.  A WAITRESS in uniform - ASTRID, young, bright,
      feisty - walks past, carrying a tray.  Then he sees -


                                                                (CONTINUED)Doctor Who 4 - Episode X - Shooting Script - 28/06/07 - page 2.

      Two GOLDEN ANGELS, guarding a set of internal doors.  THE
      HEAVENLY HOST.  Like metal statues - tall, with beautiful
      gold, blank faces, simple tunics, hands locked in prayer,
      folded wings, glowing haloes suspended above by thin struts. 
      One of them slowly turns his head.  Looks at the Doctor.

      Black eyes in a gold face.

      The Doctor creeped out, then distracted by seeing -

        BANNAKAFFALATTA strolling past, in black tie; three foot
      tall, head like a spiky red conker.

      The Doctor's getting the hang of it now, goes to porthole
      set in the wall.

      CU the Doctor, framed in the porthole.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                      Riiight....

66INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

      Quiet and dark.  A long room, rather than deep; computer
      banks, still with brass ship's fittings, and centre, a
      big, wooden SHIP'S WHEEL, facing windows, which look out
      on to BLACKNESS.  An oil painting of the boss, Max
      Capricorn, stares down. 

      CREW operating controls, in smart 1912-ish uniform - NB,
      everything on board is only an approximation of the period. 
      CAPTAIN HARDAKER stands centre - 60, wise, calm.

                    Now then, gentlemen, according to
                    the traditions of the planet below, 
                    Christmas is a time of celebration.

                    you go, I'll keep watch.

      The men head off, except MIDSHIPMAN FRAME, young, nervous.

                    Then you can stand down, Midshipman.

      DOCTOR watching as he adjusts his bow-tie; he's back in
      his dinner suit.  He's ready, he walks through -

      THE DOCTOR walks in. 

      Christmas decorations, tables & booths with GUESTS, milling
      around; dotted about, HEAVENLY HOST, standing perfectly
      still; then a dance floor, COUPLES dancing, then a stage,
      with SINGER & BAND, performing Winter Wonderland.

      FX: CROWD REPLICATION, all having a good time.  

      The Doctor strolls through, looking round...

      His POV: BANNAKAFALATTA, dancing away.

      His POV: another table, MORVIN (male) & FOON (female), a
      large pair, tucking into buffet.  They like their food.

                    Titanic, who thought of the name?

                      Information: it was chosen as the

                    Did they tell you why it was famous?

                    Sorry sir, we can handle this -

      He presses a button on the back of the Host's neck -

      It snaps rigid, upright, a statue, topples to the side -
 
      one Steward catches its torso, the other picks up its legs,
      and they carry it out, like a dummy.  All fast and discreet.

      Chief Steward walks with them, mutters to Stewards, angry -

                    No, just me, just...  Used to be,
                    but, um...  No.  What about you?
                    Long way from home, Planet Sto.

                    of...  Ohh, sounds daft.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    You dreamt of another sky.  A new
                    sun.  New air.  New life, the whole
                    universe teeming with life, why
                    stand still when there's all that
                    life out there?

      Slam! the damaged, dead HOST from sc.9 is slammed up against
      a wall.

      WIDER: CHIEF STEWARD stands back.  Big signage, DECK 31. 
      The area is full of deactivated HOST, some with wires
      running into the walls as though recharging, others in
      pieces, a disconnected Host head on a table, etc.  (NB,
      this is Below Decks, all pipes and steam and oil.)

      He goes over to an ENGINEER, who's giving hand-signals,
      'forward,' to a FORK LIFT TRUCK, which has two deactivated
      HOST stacked up on its scoop, horizontally, like dummies.

                    them...  Throw them overboard.

      He walks away, the Engineer goes over to the truck.  Pause. 
      Closer on the deactivated Host, closer...

      And it slowly turns its head to watch the Chief Steward
      go.  Dead black eyes.

                      Midshipman, you need to fire up
                    the Engine Containment Field and

                    going till I can get to the Bridge.

                    But we've got an automatic SOS,
                    they'll be sending rescue ships,
                    they can stabilise the Titanic -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Wait a minute...  Rickston, did
                    you say your vone's not working?

                    Oh now you're interested!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Give it to me.  Give it!

                    Hold on, who put you in charge? 
                    Who the hell are you, anyway?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'm the Doctor.  I'm a Time Lord. 
                    I'm from the planet Gallifrey in

                    ...no.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    In that case...  Allons-y!

                                                                            CUT TO:

6363INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

      An ordinary lower-decks stairwell, wrecked, pipes and
      girders & rubble everywhere; the door at the bottom is
      pushed open, debris falls away, and THE DOCTOR leads ASTRID,
      RICKSTON, MR COPPER, MORVIN, FOON & BANNAKAFFALATTA through.


                                                                (CONTINUED)Doctor Who 4 - Episode X - Shooting Script - 28/06/07 - page 33.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Careful, now.  Follow me.

      He heads up, stepping over debris.  As they ascend:

                                    MR COPPER
                    It's rather ironic, but this is
                    very much in the Christmas Spirit. 
                    It's a festival of violence! 
                    Humans, they say, only survive the
                    season, depending on whether they've
                    been good or bad.  It's barbaric! 

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Actually, that's not true, Christmas
                    is a time of peace and thanksgiving
                    and, oh what am I on about?  My
                      Christmases are always like this!

      Towards the top of the first staircase, he's found a
        deactivated, broken HOST, sprouting wires and cables.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    We've got a Host!  Strength of
                    ten!  If we can mend it, we can
        DW4 - Ep X - Yellow
                    use it to shift the rubble. 

                                      MORVIN
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    We can do robotics!  Both of us!

 
                                    FOON
                    We work in the Milk Market, back
                    on Sto, it's all robot staff.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    See if you can get it working.
                          (moves on)
                    Now, let's have a look...

      He & Astrid carry on up, reach the first landing, look up:

      A TANGLE of METAL GIRDERS & STRUTS has fallen, blocking
      the top of staircase 2, before the landing.  The tangle is
      deep, but with a gap, a small tunnel, centre.

                                      ASTRID
                    It's blocked.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    So what do we do?

                                      ASTRID
                    We shift it.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    That's the attitude!  Rickston! 
                    Mr Copper!  And you, Bannakaffalatta -
                    look, can I call you Banna?  It's
                    gonna save a lot of time.

                    No!  Bannakaffalatta!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    All right then, Bannakaffalatta, 
                    there's a gap, in the middle - see
                    if you can get through -

        Bannakaffalatta heads up staircase 2, towards the
      gap/tunnel, the Doctor, Astrid, Mr Copper, Rickston follow -

      On staircase 1, Morvin & Foon sit, to work on the Host. 
      The blank gold face staring up.  (NB, it's lost its Halo.)

      CUT TO Bannakaffalatta, crawling through the jagged gap.

                                      BANNAKAFFALATTA
                    Easy!  Good!

      CAMERA SHAKE: the whole ship lurches -

      PRAC dust, bits of rubble, tumble down, everyone tense...

      It stops.  But the Tangle is creaking, ominously.

                                    THE DOCTOR
 
                    Oh, Rickston, I forgot, did you
                    get that message?

                                      RICKSTON
                    No, what message?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Shut up.

      CUT TO Bannakaffalatta - he's climbed through, reaching
      the top landing, which is relatively clear.

                                      BANNAKAFFALATTA
                      Bannakaffalatta made it!

                    I'm small enough, I can get
                      through...

      And she heads through the gap, it creaks:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Careful.

                    No, I'm fine...

                    Thing is, how are we gonna get Mr
                    and Mrs Fatso through that gap?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    We make the gap bigger.  So start!

      As they get to work on the staircase 2, clearing metal,
      CUT BACK TO Morvin & Foon on staircase 1, clipping the
      Host's wires together, by hand.  But Foon heard Rickston,
      and she starts to cry:

                                      MORVIN
                    We won them, fair and square.

                                    FOON

                    been hiding the vone bill for months
 
                    now.

                                      MORVIN
                    Five thousand credits..?  You spent

                                    FOON
                    Don't hate me.

      And Morvin starts to laugh.  Really laugh.

                    What's so funny?

                    Mrs Van Hoff, c'mere -

      And he gives her a big hug, both laughing.

      CUT TO staircase 2, Morvin & Foon's laughter echoing up,
      the Doctor, Rickston & Mr Copper clearing the gap:

                                      RICKSTON
                    What happened, did they find a
                    doughnut?

      CUT TO the top landing on the far side of the tangle, Astrid
      now there, hauling out a plank of metal, calling through:

                                      ASTRID
                    I can clear it from this side,
                    just tell me if it starts moving...

      The hand clangs on to the floor.

      Midshipman Frame hauls himself round, to look - the door
      has a central porthole, now filled with an impassive
      unmoving HOST's face.  Staring at him.

                                                                            CUT TO:

7474INT. SHIP CORRIDOR #2 - NIGHT

      Corridor as others: wrecked, rubble, PRAC FLAMES here and
      there.  RICKSTON, MORVIN & FOON, BANNAKAFFALATTA (now
      recovered), MR COPPER then THE DOCTOR & ASTRID hurry through
      a BIG METAL DOOR - the Doctor sonics, it slides shut.

      Foon's spotted a shattered metal hostess-style-trolley -

                                    FOON
                    Morvin, look!  Food!

                                      RICKSTON
                    Oh great, someone's happy.

                                      MORVIN
                    Don't have any, then.

                    All right, that's my job, share it
 
                    out, careful with the water, we
                    might need that...

      All except the Doctor gather round the trolley, settle,
      eating, a moment's rest.  The Doctor goes to the COMMS; a
      distance away, back by the door, so this can be sotto. 
      The comms screen is playing sc.7 on a loop, 'My name's
      Max!', ding! the Doctor impersonates it:

                    Yes, sir.  But I've got Host
                    outside, I've sealed the door.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    They've been programmed to kill,
                    why would anyone do that?

                    That's not the only problem, Doctor. 
                    I had to use a maximum deadlock on
                    the door.  Which means...  No one
                    can get in.  I'm sealed off.  Even
                    if you can fix the Titanic, you
                    can't get to the Bridge.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Okay.  Right.  Fine!  One problem
                    at a time.  What's on Deck 31?

                    That's down below, it's nothing...

      He brings up the TITANIC GRAPHICS GRID, which also pops up
      on the Doctor's comms panel.  Both study it.

                    Just the Host Storage Deck, that's
                    where we keep the robots.

                    Never seen it before.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    100% shielded, what's down there..?

                                      MIDSHIPMAN FRAME
                    I'll try intensifying the scanner.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Let me know if you find anything. 
                    And keep those engines going!

      Hanging up, as Astrid brings the Doctor some food, and
      both hunker down, to eat.

                    Saved you some.  You might be a

                    still need food.

                                    THE DOCTOR

      FX: it's a huge Death Star-style CANYON, except the walls
      aren't smooth, they're all jagged metal, where many floors

      an identical ARCHWAY, on the opposite side.  The Strut's
      jagged & broken, about 3 feet wide, 6 feet deep; like a
      tree across a river.  (NB, STRUT is PRAC BUILD in most
      shots, its surroundings seen in FX shots; for non-FX shots,

      Rickston stands.  Wobbles.  Balances.  A step at time...

      In the Archway, louder crashes from the corridor beyond -

                    I've got to seal us off...

      He sonics the door, it slides shut.

                                    MR COPPER
                    Leaving us trapped, wouldn't you

                    Never say trapped.  Just...
                      inconveniently circumstanced.

      CUT TO Rickston.  Careful steps over the uneven surface...

      His foot slips, dislodging METAL SLATES  -

                    What am I gonna do without him?

      And she hugs Astrid, crying.

      CUT TO Rickston - deep breath, he runs the last length -

      - reaching the OPPOSITE ARCHWAY, hugs the wall.  (It has a
      similar surrounding ledge; its door closed.)

                    What for?  What am I going to do

                    Just think, what would he want? 
                    He'd want you safe, wouldn't he?

                    He doesn't want anything, he's dead!

      She doesn't even look at him, just crying.

      And he's got no choice, he starts across the Strut...

        Bannakaffalatta, just over halfway, calls back:

      Astrid gets to her feet, continues taking careful steps...

      CUT TO the Doctor, edging along on all fours, and then...

      He stops.  Stands.  Looking round.  Because...

      The whunks have stopped. 

      Ominous silence.  Hushed:

      Pulls it free; the baton is a bit like a gun.

                    Good!  Right.  You've been ordered
                    to kill the survivors, but why?

      Silence.  Astrid upset, crying, Mr Copper hugs her.  The

      Hold.

      Then the Doctor lifts his head.  Fire in his eyes.

                    You're talking like you're not

                    There's something down on Deck 31. 
                    I'm gonna find out what it is.

                    But what if you meet the Host?

                    that's what I am, just a traveller. 
                    Imagine it!  No tax, no bills, no
                    boss.  Just the open sky.

                    ...I'm sort of... unemployed now. 
                    I was thinking, that blue box was
                    kind of small, but... I could
                    squeeze in.  Like a stowaway. 

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    ...I suppose.

                    It's not always safe.

                                      ASTRID
                    Then you need someone to look after
                    you.  And I've got no one back on
                    Sto, no family.  Just me.  What

                    Yeah.  I'd like that, yeah.

 
      Big smile between them.  Then -

      CAMERA SHAKE - the corridor lurches, PRAC RUBBLE - and

      She plonks the box in front of him.

      Stands on it.

      Then grabs his jacket, pulls him in for a good kiss!

      Then lets go, both smiling.

                                    THE DOCTOR

      CUT TO Rickston, going to a second door, sonicking it.

      That done, he stops.  Gets his breath.  Sinks to the floor. 
      Curls up.  Quietly, Rickston starts to cry.

      CUT TO Astrid, now on the far side of the room.  She checks
      a dead Host, but then looks up...

      She's right next to the RACK OF TELEPORT BRACELETS.

      It is a METAL BOX, 5 feet tall, 3 feet wide, blinking with
      computer panels, though driven by great big industrial

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    But according to your society,
                    cyborgs are inferior, so you should
                    accept my commands instead of his,
                    yes?  Yes?  What d'you say, yes??

                                    MAX
                    But I can answer that.  They're
                    robots, Doctor.  To them, cyborgs
                    are practically family.

                                    THE DOCTOR

                    All that banter, and yet not a

      CU on the Doctor.  Lost in thought.

      MIDSHIPMAN FRAME enters - now patched up, proper bandages. 
      During this, on the Doctor, as he wanders over to the row
      of TELEPORT BRACELETS, picks one up, idly.

                                      MIDSHIPMAN FRAME
                    I've sent the SOS.  Rescue ships

                    They'll want to talk to all of us,

                    Should think so, yeah.  Is there

        www.thewriterstale.com
      wanders over to the far end of the room, tired.

 
      Mr Copper goes to the Doctor, sotto:

                    I think one or two inconvenient
                    truths might come to light.  Still. 
                    My own fault.  And ten years in

                    Doctor...

      Rickston's walking towards them.  Tearful, broken, honest.

                    I never said...  Thank you.

      And he suddenly hugs the Doctor, tight.

      But then, as he pulls out of the hug, wiping his face, the
      old Rickston is recovering, that glint in his eye.

                                      RICKSTON (CONT'D)
                    Funny thing is, I said Max Capricorn
                    was falling apart.  Just before
                    the crash, I sold all my shares. 
                      Transferred them to his rivals.
                          (smiles)
                    It's made me rich.  How about that?

                    who dies.  That would make you a
                    monster.

      The Doctor looks at him properly.  Smiles.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Mr Copper.

      Hands him a teleport bracelet.
        DW4 - Ep X - Yellow

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    I think you deserve this.

      Mr Copper realises what he means, puts on the bracelet, as
 
      the Doctor gets a second bracelet, puts it on.

      Then the Doctor looks across the room.  Midshipman Frame,
      far across the space, knows what he's about to do.

      And Midshipman Frame stands tall.  Salutes the Doctor.

      The Doctor salutes him.  And then...

      FX: TELEPORT GLOW, the Doctor & Mr Copper disappear.

                                                                            CUT TO:

122122EXT. HILLSIDE OVERLOOKING CITY - NIGHT

      SNOW falling.  TWO SMALL FIGURES trudging across the barren,
      empty hillside, THE DOCTOR & MR COPPER.

                                    MR COPPER
                    ...so, Great Britain is part of
                    Yooropee, and just across the
                    British Channel, you've got Great
                    France and Great Germany...

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No, just France and Germany, only
                    Britain is great.

                                    MR COPPER
                    And they're all at war with the
                    continent of Hamerica?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No, well, not yet, you could argue
                    that one....  There she is!

      Far off, in the snow: THE TARDIS.

      JUMP CUT TO THE DOCTOR & MR COPPER next to the Tardis. 
      The Doctor patting it, wiping snow off.  They're on the
      brow of the hill, the lights of a city glittering far-off.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    Survive anything!

                                    MR COPPER
                    Between you and me, I don't even
                    think this is proper snow, I suspect
                    it's the ballast from the Titanic's
                    salvage, entering the atmosphere.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Yeah.  One of these days, it might
        DW4 - Ep X - Yellow
                    snow for real.

      Which is just chat, to delay the awkward moment:

                                    MR COPPER
 
                    So!  I take it, you'll be going?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    The open sky.

                                    MR COPPER
                    And... what about me?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I travel alone.  It's best that
                    way.

                                    MR COPPER
                    Then what am I supposed to do?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Give me that credit card.

      Mr Copper hands it over, the Doctor studies it, sonics it.

                                    MR COPPER
                    It's only petty cash.  Spending
                    money.  All done by computer, I
                    didn't really know the currency, I
                    thought a million might cover it.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    A million pounds?

122CONTINUED: (2)122

                                    MR COPPER
                    Enough for trinkets.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Mr Copper, a million pounds is
                    worth fifty million credits.*

                                    MR COPPER
                    How much..?!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Fifty million, and fifty six.*

                                    MR COPPER
                    ...I've got money.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Yes you have!

      And Mr Copper takes the card.  Incredulous.  Then stands
      back, exultant, laughing to the skies.

                                    MR COPPER
                    Oh my word.  Oh my Vot.  Oh my
                    goodness me, yee hah! 
        DW4 - Ep X - Yellow

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    It's all yours.  Planet Earth. 
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    Now that's a retirement plan. 
                    Just you be careful, though!
 
                                    MR COPPER
                    I will, I will, oh I will!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No interfering.  I don't want any
                    trouble.  Just... have a nice life.

                                    MR COPPER
                    I can have a house!  A proper house! 
                    With a garden!  And a door!  Oh,
                    Doctor!  I'll make you proud!

      He grabs the Doctor, kisses his cheek -

      Then runs off, into the snow, towards the city, yelling:

                                    MR COPPER (CONT'D)
                    I can have a kitchen!  With chairs! 
                    And windows!  And... plates!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Um... where are you going?

                                    MR COPPER
                    No idea!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Nor me.

      The Doctor turns to the Tardis, gets out the key.

      But Mr Copper stops, calls back, a silhouette in the snow.

                                    MR COPPER
                    Oh, and Doctor! 
                          (pause)
                    I won't forget her.

      The Doctor just nods.  Then looks up.

      FX: NIGHT SKY, and in amongst the snow, just for a second,
      there's a glimpse of shining BLUE STARDUST, then gone.

      Then the Doctor looks back across the night.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Merry Christmas, Mr Copper.

      And the Doctor goes into the Tardis.

      FX: the ancient grind of engines, and the Tardis fades
      away, obscured by the snow, gone.
