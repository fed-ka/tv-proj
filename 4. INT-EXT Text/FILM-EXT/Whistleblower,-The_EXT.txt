A PARTY. ROCK MUSIC BLARES. DRUNK TEENS dance around BURNING
BARRELS. GROUPS lounge on ratty couches and turned over boxes
skulling cans, making out, talking shit. A BOY, 17, lights a
MOLOTOV COCKTAIL and hurls it off the roof.
Luba and Raya join THREE GUYS. ONE of them pisses onto a
cloth, stuffs it in a bottle, and tries to light it. It
FIZZLES. Everybody bursts out laughing.
RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
It's ammonia, not alcohol.
BOY (UKRAINIAN)
(Drunk) You're so smart. I love you!
He lunges in for a kiss, but she dodges him, laughing. Luba
gives him the finger, pulling Raya toward the dancing into...
TEEN MAYHEM: Raya lets herself go. She gets lost in...
A WHIRL of drunk and happy teens. It's tribal. They dance,
silhouetted against the fire and the black sky, their backs
to the run-down Soviet buildings... Tonight, they don't want
to think about what life holds in store.
Raya stops. Dizzy. She looks at her watch, suddenly aware of
the time. Yelling over to Luba...
TWB 2.
RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
I have to get home. Mama's gonna kill me.
LUBA (UKRAINIAN)
No, you're staying with me tonight. Roman
wants us there at 9 in the morning.
Raya looks at Luba. Torn.
LUBA (CONT'D)
It's just a few months working in a
hotel. You want to work at Copyshack like
your mother? Marry one of these assholes?
There's nothing here!.. He said it was
both of us or no go!
Raya sighs, wanting to, but unable to agree. Luba hesitates;
she needs this so badly.
LUBA (CONT'D)
Fuck your mom!
But Raya shakes her head, eyes apologetic. She pushes past
Luba who watches her disappear.

The silver mist of dawn rises over the Golden Domes of Kyiv.

POLICE OFFICER LEEDS scans the side of a house. Rounding to
THE FRONT PORCH
He shakes his head at his partner, KATHRYN BOLKOVAC, 38.
Earthy and athletic. She is in great shape, but her eyes tell
of a life fully lived. She's looking at a HUSBAND and WIFE
standing in the doorway.
HUSBAND
It just got a bit heated, you know how it
gets. I'll apologize to the neighbors
tomorrow.
Kathy nods, humoring. A police radio BUZZES.
OFFICER LEEDS
Ready to go?
Kathy eyes the wife, tries to see past them into the house.
KATHY
You sure everything is alright, Ma'am?
The wife is still. Kathy eyes her, gently. Then, calm...
WIFE
Really. It was nothing.
TWB 4.
The husband shifts his weight. Kathy flits a look behind him,
noticing... Jackets hanging from the wall. Her gaze lowers to
a hook hanging much lower than the rest of the jackets.
KATHY
You all have any children?
HUSBAND
Nope.
The wife looks down. The man stirs, agitated.
HUSBAND (CONT'D)
So if that's all Officer...
KATHY
I'd like to take a quick walk through the
house.
HUSBAND
You can't do that without a warrant.
KATHY
Yes I can, Sir, please step aside.
The wife moves out of the way. The man panics. Leeds heads up
the porch. Kathy steps over the threshold. When...
HUSBAND
You're not coming in my house!
He blocks her, but Kathy pushes past him, and then he...
GRABS Kathy. HURLS her into a wall. CRACK. Kathy yells in
EXTREME PAIN.
O.S. POLICE SIRENS BLARE

A SILHOUETTE breaks the horizon and SPEEDS towards us,
throwing up gravel: a dented white BUS, emblazoned with large
black letters: "UN". A UNITED STATES flag on it.
TITLE CARD: BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA 1999
11
12
The final stretch into Sarajevo. Famous from so many war
reports, site of many deaths. The broad, pock-marked avenue
is barren. SHELLED HIGH RISES lean like hungry faces, gouged
from their once-solid structures. Living rooms are exposed to
the elements, wallpaper blowing in the wind like torn skin.
TWB 8.
IN THE BUS: Carmen taps Kathy, pointing out the window...
CARMEN
Sniper Alley. See, the bullet marks are
at eye level. People just running to the
store.
All the walls are splattered at head level. Kathy is overcome
by the stark reality of war. Worse than she ever imagined.
INTERCUT WITH:
MOVE ALONG rapt faces... YOUNG MEN, MIDDLE-AGED MEN, heads
held high, ready for anything. We're in...

Kathy and RECRUITS receive TRAINING from a PAKISTANI MONITOR,
shadowing him as he hands food-packs to a LINE of REFUGEES.
BILL HYNES (O.S.)
...to ensure the dignity, equality, and
inalienable human rights of every single
person in this devastated place.
The refugees turn their haunted eyes to the fresh faces of
the NEW RECRUITS. Kathy extends a parcel to an OLD MAN. He
hesitates. Then she sees... He has no arms. She's unsure what
to do. A young boy takes the package, leading his grandfather
away. Kathy stands: WHERE AM I?
ASSEMBLY HALL: Bill Hynes stands before a map of the Balkans.
TWB 9.
BILL HYNES (CONT'D)
The Dayton Peace Accords of 1995 ended
this war, dictating that an International
Police Task Force - YOU - would smooth
the transition from war to peace.

KATHY and THREE NEW RECRUITS are led down a path along a
mountainside. They move toward an UNDERGROUND BUNKER.
CHILDREN play at the edge of an overgrown field.
A BOY hops up on a post, about to jump over, when the leader,
TODD MYERS, 30s, a seasoned pro, YELLS at him, points out...
A sign closer to the BARBED WIRE, fringing the field... A
SKULL AND CROSSBONES. "LANDMINES NOT SWEPT"
BILL HYNES (O.S.)
But you will learn that peace is harder
won than war..
Kathy watches the boy run back up the road. The recruits head
down STEEP STEPS into...
16
17
Kathy drives past a MILITARY BASE, an ITALIAN FLAG flying...
A few hundred yards up the street, a BAR...
BELLA LUNA BAR
Driving past a another BAR. GERMAN FLAG... A SIGN: BERLIN
NIGHTS... Kathy passes by, amused.

Kathy and Carmen are led by a MONITOR through a sparsely
furnished UNIT. A poster of `Born in the USA' on the wall.
TWB 10.
BILL HYNES (O.S.)
You will learn that every morning's
hope...
Carmen bounces her butt up and down to test her mattress.

The bus arrives. The base is surrounded by barbed wire and
overlook sights, manned by ARMED MILITARY.
MEETING HALL: Hynes looks out at the new batch. Proud.
BILL HYNES
But today is a new day. As Head of the
United Nations Mission here I trust that
we stake our highest values, even our
lives, on the belief that we can rebuild,
we must renew, we will witness the
rebirth of this country.
The recruits are hyped, the rhetoric is working. MOVING OVER
THEM, MAN by MAN, we REVEAL in the back:
Kathy. In her crisp navy blue IPTF flack jacket. Her blonde
hair makes her stand out. She is one of the only women in the
room. Her eyes ablaze. She is completely fired up.
21
22
ROCK MUSIC ECHOES from several bars. Carmen heads toward one,
when an AMERICAN IPTF MONITOR stops her.
AMERICAN IPTF
That's a military Bar. You want the party
in there...
He points to BIG NEON SIGN: THE INTERNATIONAL BAR. Tiki
lights illuminate a broad patio. A PIG roasts on a spit.
Kathy follows Carmen through DOZENS of off-duty IPTF, SFOR
and UN workers who drink and trade stories with machismo.
There's a palpable sexual tension in the air. BOSNIAN
WAITRESSES flirt with OFFICERS. Guys paw GIRLS with trays.
CARMEN
Fuck me, we're outnumbered. Good odds.
KATHY
Hon, they're all yours.
They make their way through the crowded bar, feeling the
officers' double-takes. Carmen smiles coyly at Kathy, then
zeroes in on JAN VAN DER VELDE, 35, handsome. He is
surrounded by a group of IPTF with Dutch flags on their
shoulders. Carmen throws her arms around them, jovial.
CARMEN
Okay, fine, if you insist. Mine's a
Jaegermeister.
Jan laughs at Carmen's forwardness, his eye on Kathy. But she
spots Todd Myers across the bar, and is on her way, when...
JAN
What about you? You don't have an order?
KATHY
No. I'm the polite one.
JAN
I like polite.
Carmen turns his head toward her.
TWB 12.
CARMEN
I'm gonna be the drunk one. Let's get
toasted.
Kathy smiles, a little too old for this game. Carmen leans
into Kathy's ear. She smiles, and moves off.
AT THE BAR
Kathy moves to Todd and the Americans, catching Todd's eye,
but is distracted by a WAITRESS writhing on an ITALIAN
SOLDIER's lap. The Waitress darts Kathy a look, contemptuous.
And the soldiers notice. One leers at Kathy...
ITALIAN SOLDIER
I'd pay double for a woman in uniform.
Kathy looks him over.
KATHY
Sorry pal, I'm not for sale.
The Soldier is stung. The Italians laugh.
TODD MYERS (O.S.)
We're Dyncorp. We're all for sale...
Kathy, right?
Todd puts his arm around Kathy, bringing her to a TABLE OF
AMERICAN IPTF. They greet her, friendly.
TODD MYERS (CONT'D)
Look the basic lay of the land is we have
to work with the other nationals, but we
don't mix with them at night.
JIM HIGGINS, 25, and even younger looking...
JIM HIGGINS
Lucky those wops don't carry guns or
we'd've had ourselves a situation.
Fucking unarmed mission. I was hoping
we'd get to squeeze some off.
TODD MYERS
At who? Better odds you'll step on a land
mine and what the hell's a gun gonna do
for you then?
JIM HIGGINS
(embarrassed) I'd kill the fucker who
buried it.
Everyone laughs. Todd turns to Kathy.
TWB 13.
TODD MYERS
You ever had to take someone down?
KATHY
Just once.
The others see she's the real deal. Kathy feels good.
23
24
Early sun breaks through the fog over the valley.
25
26
Industrial plants dominate the skyline of this Sarajevo
suburb. Kathy drives frantically past bombed-out buildings.
Carmen studies a map beside her. They hit A RED LIGHT. And
stop. A GROUP OF MUSLIM WOMEN cross the street. One questions
Kathy with a lingering gaze. Carmen stares at her map...
CARMEN
Do you have any idea where we are?
Kathy shakes her head. No idea.
27
28
A SCHOOL sprayed with GRAFFITI and BULLETS.
TWB 15.

Kathy's SUV pulls up behind the cluster of local police cars.
IPTF OFFICER CLARKSON stands outside. He eyes his watch.
Kathy rushes to him, but he's already a foot in the door.
KATHY
We got here as quick as we could.
CLARKSON (BRITISH ACCENT)
Just try to get them here on time.
TWB 17.
32
35
Kathy has dinner with Carmen, who talks away. Kathy watches
the world go by. She notices an OLDER, LARGE IPTF MONITOR
walking with his arm around a YOUNG GIRL, 16, dressed in a
short skirt. Kathy turns back to Carmen who is still talking.
36
36
Chanting echoes from the SINANOVA HOUSE of the Dervish Order.

Kathy sits in a UN SUV. Viko watches as she goes through
Zlata's hospital files. She's encouraged.
KATHY
Okay, now get the same thing from all the
doctors who treated her. They will have
to testify on Zlata's behalf.
41
46
Carmen helps Kathy load boxes and suitcases into an SUV.
CARMEN
I can't believe they're moving you into
the city. I'm so jealous. So where's your
office?
KATHY
Mission Headquarters... UNMHQ.
CARMEN
But Madeleine is UNHCHR, right?
KATHY
(smiling) I know. I don't even know if
I'm still IPTF.
CARMEN
Well I don't give an F.U.C.K. All I know
is I'm gonna miss you. Stay in touch with
the little people!
They hug. Kathy smiles, and hops into the car.
47
47
Kathy drives into the CITY CENTRE.
48
49
Member nations' flags slap in the wind. Hundreds of UN SUVs.
Kathy drives up. She takes in the huge building. Almost in
disbelief that she's part of it, at the center of it all.
TWB 24.
50
52
Black cobbles. Merchants line the narrow pathways. Open-
doored cafes serve coffee to UNEMPLOYED YOUTH. Kathy and Jan
walk along. He's delighted. She's restrained.
JAN
I was wondering when you'd ask me out.
KATHY
It's not a date... No, seriously. It's
not. I know you had a lot to do with my
promotion, so I wanted to thank you.
He grabs her by the hand, ducking into a SMALL ARCHWAY. A
NARROW PASSAGE opens up onto a charming restaurant.
53
53
Kathy and Jan sit at a table, watching a WAITRESS put down a
carraffe of wine and 'Cevapcici' (lamb dish).
JAN
Here's to not dating.
KATHY
Listen to me. I'm not joking around.
You're a nice guy. But I...
The waitress reaches across Kathy with a plate. Winks at Jan.
WAITRESS
You are certain you have everything you
need?
The waitress eyes him coyly. Kathy studies the exchange.
JAN
We're fine thank you.
The waitress leaves. Kathy shakes her head, amused.
JAN (CONT'D)
You were saying I'm a nice guy--
Kathy is watching the waitress hit up another table.
KATHY
You must be in heaven over here.
JAN
The war left behind a lot of widows.
TWB 26.
KATHY
You don't find that--
JAN
I find it uncomfortable. A lot of guys
don't. I don't know what else to say
about it. Now finish your sentence, I'm a
nice guy but--
KATHY
I can't afford to mess this up.
JAN
It's only dinner. How bad can it get?
KATHY
Ask my two ex-husbands.
He grins. Kathy looks at him, unsettled by the chemistry
between them.
54
56
Kathy follows an IPTF monitor, BARRY, 30s, Irish past the
front of a UN BUS. A DOZEN MUSLIM WOMEN disembark and look
up, their hands over their mouths, keening.
BARRY
This is the first time they've seen their
homes in years.
IPTF MONITORS help with unloading battered suitcases and
belongings. THREE carry a couch up the steps of a building as
a YOUNG BROTHER and SISTER watch. Standing back, an ELDERLY
WOMAN weeps in disbelief as the monitors lay final touches on
makeshift storm windows on her aparment.
Kathy watches, Barry by her side.
KATHY
They're all widows?
BARRY
That's why they were so frightened to
come back.
(MORE)
TWB 27.
BARRY (CONT'D)
They couldn't believe they'd be safe.
That what happened before wouldn't happen
again. Except now with nobody to protect
them.
Kathy shakes her head. The women enter the building, their
past lives in shards at their feet. One WOMAN, 40s, stands
numb, a bundle of books in her arms, tears running down her
face, as her TEENAGE SON beckons her to come in the DOOR.
KATHY
Except us.
BARRY
I always thought helping refugees get
home would be one of the best parts of
the job. But it's so hard for them.
Kathy nods, moved.
KATHY
Thanks for taking me through this. Fill
me in when you're done, and I'll send my
report to Rick Jones.
Another FIELD OFFICER rushes up. An urgent look on his face.
57
58
Kathy drives up a winding mountain road, checking directions
on a hand-drawn map. A LOCAL POLICE CAR swerves by in the
opposite direction.
59
59
Kathy's SUV throws up gravel. Out her windscreen, she sees
THE FLORIDA BAR: A dilapidated two story building, painted a
garish pink. Crude palm trees painted on the side.
Kathy jumps out of her SUV, and moves towards...
LOCAL POLICE smoke by POLICE CARS.
A LOCAL COP leads a CLUSTER of YOUNG WOMEN out the door. They
blink in the glaring light, pale, out of place, lost...
At the end of the line, is Luba. Her eyes darting between
Kathy and the Local Cops, helpless.
Kathy rushes towards the cop. He eyes her, dubious.
KATHY
What's going on here?
LOCAL COP (SERBIAN)
Xo brovnic ce klety scey forzcic nay.
He moves past her, with the Girls in tow.
KATHY
Hold on. Where are the IPTF monitoring
this raid?
SHOUTING ECHOES from inside the bar. TWO COPS drag out TANJO
ZRAVBIC, 50s. He sees Kathy's uniform and SHOUTS at her.
TANJO (SERBIAN)
Zra slobovik brvicetic revic barziny
Traba! Motherfockers!
The cops SHOVE Tanjo in a car, and SLAM the door. Kathy turns
to the Local Cop, standing with the group of girls.
KATHY
Is that the owner? Are you taking him
into custody?
TWB 30.
LOCAL COP
Xivy slovic drinjnislava porslivky.
Kathy looks around, frustrated.
KATHY
Is there a translator on the scene?
Translator?... Wait.
He stops, impatient. Kathy pulls out her WALKIE.
KATHY (CONT'D)
This is Kathy Bolkovac. I need an
Interpreter. At the Florida Bar.
The Local Cops watch her. Kathy's eyes rest on the girls.
WALKIE VOICE (O.S.) (ACCENTED ENGLISH)
Okay. I need a time and date.
KATHY
Now.
WALKIE VOICE (O.S.)
That's impossible. We need advance notice
for field calls.
The Local Cop talks at the girls. They don't understand him,
but his tone is clear: total disrespect. Kathy moves toward
them, protectively, then sees...
TWO UN SUVs parked on the other side of the bar.
TWO IPTF MONITORS emerge from the bar. Kathy approaches them.
They seem surprised.
KATHY
Hey. I'm from Gender Affairs. I--
FRED MURRAY
Hey. Fred Murray.
He shakes her hand.
Tanjo BANGS on the window, inside the police car, apopleptic
with rage. Kathy glances over her shoulder.
KATHY
Is that the owner? (off Fred's nod) I
tried to get an interpreter but--
FRED MURRAY
No, no... that's fine. We're pretty much
done here anyway.
TWB 31.
KATHY
Oh... Okay. But there's... We just had
two girls come in to a Human Rights
Office, saying they escaped from this
place.
Fred seems confused. Kathy pulls out a clipboard.
FRED MURRAY
Yeah. Local police have been watching the
place for a while. This whole thing
happened pretty fast. I guess those girls
must've run for it.
Kathy looks over as the girls are put into a van.
KATHY
Well, the girls in our field office
seemed pretty scared. I should follow up
with these ones.
The Local Cops start to move, stubbing out cigarettes,
getting in cars. The Local Cop shuts the doors of the van.
FRED MURRAY
You can see where they're taking them,
but I can't intervene. You know the
drill.
He shrugs and smiles. Kathy hears the POLICE VAN's engine
start. Turning to it...
KATHY
Thanks. I'll look out for your report.
She rushes after the van. Fred eyes Kathy confer with the Van
driver. He and the other Monitor, drive off.
Kathy is left alone in the silence. She turns to the bar.
60
62
A run-down Community Center nestled in a shabby area outside
the city. It's completely unassuming. From the outside, you
might think it was abandoned.
TWB 33.

UNMHQ stands over the crumbling red roofs of Sarajevo. In the
foreground, a CEMETERY packed with crooked wooden crosses.

67
FIVE local MEN in fatigues scan the field slowly with hand-
held minesweepers. One MAN holds up his hand as his device
BEEPS. At the edge of the field, Fred Murray blows a whistle.
Everybody else STOPS. The man bends down, as all wait...
Kathy approaches from the road, behind a fence. Fred smiles.
FRED MURRAY
We meet again!
Kathy looks out, suddenly aware of the dangerous situation.
KATHY
Is it okay for me to be here?
FRED MURRAY
Sure, sure. You're fine here on the
gravel. What's going on?
KATHY
I just wanted to follow up with you on
the raid yesterday. Those girls didn't
show up at the Shelter, and I wanted to
locate them.
FRED MURRAY
Yeah, the whole thing was a bit of a
mess. Turned out it was a local police
mistake. Mix-up with the tip off or
something. Thought they had a
prostitution bust, but the bar is legit
and those girls were just waitresses.
KATHY
Waitresses aren't kept under lock and
key.
ANOTHER WHISTLE BLOWS. Fred turns to the field.
TWB 37.
FRED MURRAY
Shit. Can we go over this later? I got to
get in there.
Before she can answer, Fred is moving down the field. She
watches him go.

Kathy and Milena lead Raya and Irka out to her SUV.

A stark contrast, the GDA is a new and shining edifice.
Kathy's SUV pulls up front.

Kathy starts her car. She pulls out, turning left. Then,
cranks the wheel right.

Kathy's UN SUV swerves along the serpentine mountain road.
73
75
Kathy pulls up to a PARKING LOT full of CARS and UN SUVs.
MUSIC spills out. BACK IN BUSINESS. She gets out of the SUV,
moving inside...
76
77
Kathy SPEEDS up the mountain roads. Past many bars. One after
another, after another... All filled with UN SUVs. Groups of
drunk OFFICERS spill out. She stops across from one, seeing:
Jan coming out of the bar. Kathy watches, stunned...
Jan helps a drunk friend pile into an SUV. He looks up and
sees Kathy as a car beam slides over her. She pulls away.

Fog hangs low over the waking valley of Sarajevo.

Milena leads Kathy through the halls.
KATHY
I need to get evidence. How many girls do
you have here?
MILENA
At least thirty five.
MONTAGE:
Kathy sits with GIRL after GIRL. Listening to their stories.
Writing furiously...
Kathy interviews EVA, 16. She talks through grateful tears.
EVA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
...Many of them come in. Uniforms like
you. Different flags on the shoulders. I
will testify. I don't care anymore. One
brings cigarette. His name is Peter...
Kathy with a different girl, FADILA, 17.
TWB 47.
FADILA (MACEDONIAN)
...Sometimes if it's a party, a birthday,
they pay for a group of girls, all
together. Do whatever they want. Brian,
the Irish guy, said Bosnia was better
than Thailand for girls.
Another girl, JASMILA, 18 - stunning, with haunted eyes.
JASMILA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
The soldier from Italia say I was his
girlfriend. I ask him to help me. But the
bar owner pay him off. He has a tattoo of
Tiger on his arm.
Yet another, NADIA, 14, nodding.
NADIA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
Paolo come every week. He had a thin
moustache, the other...here I have a
picture...
Kathy wasn't expecting that. Nadia throws down a photo.
NADIA (CONT'D)
He loved the Firecracker.
Nadia lifts up her sweatshirt, revealing a long scar.
Kathy inspects the photo: Nadia with a SOUTH AMERICAN and
U.S. IPTF: Their arms around her. One licks her face.
NADIA (CONT'D)
They burn me. Then they laugh.
Kathy eyes Nadia... Silently in awe of her strength.
KATHY
Do you have any more pictures?

The markets shut down. The Catholic Church Bells ring. Across
the square the Call to Prayer echoes from old loudspeakers`.

A crumbling edifice, once home to the world's finest, now a
reminder of humanity's worst. INSIDE...
Kathy walks with Madeleine, who unleashes Helen the hound.
MADELEINE
Helen loves it here. I think she has
Olympic ambitions.
Kathy hands Madeleine the files. She flips through.
TWB 51.
KATHY
I wanted these girls to testify in a
trial against the IPTF officers. But--
MADELEINE
The immunity problem.
KATHY
Okay, but if the girls testify in a
Bosnian court against their trafficker...
Tanjo... they'd have to mention what else
goes on in the brothels.
Madeleine nods. The dog comes bounding back.
MADELEINE
It could work. If you make certain that
in their testimony they mention every
sordid detail of IPTF involvement--
KATHY
That is their testimony. Then it would be
on record. Somebody would have to pay
attention. Like...the State Department?
Madeleine grins, proud.
MADELEINE
They're gonna answer for this.

Kathy parks her SUV.

Kathy and Viko walk out, energized with a sense of purpose.
VIKO
It's no problem. The Van is just sitting
here. Let's go.
They arrive at a POLICE VAN. Kathy eyes it.
VIKO (CONT'D)
It's not exactly armored, but it will do
the trick. You follow me, yes?
He jumps in, and starts it up. Kathy follows in her UN SUV.
Across the street, a LOCAL MAN watches from INSIDE A CAR.

Kathy SWERVES up. Viko has the Van parked right up against
the door. Kathy jumps out.

Kathy. Speeding down the 103. A two-lane winding road.

Viko steers the Van around a corner. Raya sits in the back.

Viko stops at a traffic light. Raya peers out a crack in the

Kathy slows her car... FLICKERING LIGHTS. She approaches...
A BORDER STATION: A GRAVEL ROAD leads up to it. Kathy slows.
BORDER GUARDS smoke and play cards. One guard saunters over.
KATHY
I'm looking for a girl. She was dropped
here a few hours ago.
He shrugs, shaking his head.
KATHY (CONT'D)
Can you check the border logs? She's
about 15, the police brought her here but
she didn't have a passport. Maybe--
GUARD
Lady. I know what you're looking for.
Those girls do not go through the border.
They go through there...
He points... A THICK Forest. Stretching for MILES.
GUARD (CONT'D)
To Serbia.
Kathy stares at the endless forest. A dirt road cuts through
the middle. She jumps in her SUV, and HURTLES down the road.
111
111
Viko turns down a narrow street. He glances in his rear view
mirror. An old TRABBANT follows him. He veers down an alley.
112
112
Kathy's SUV crawls alongside the FOREST. HIGHBEAMS off the
top of the car. SCANNING all around. Then, in a clearing up
ahead...
A SILHOUETTE. Kathy ACCELERATES.
113
113
Viko eyes the mirror. All clear. Turning onto a DESERTED
STREET.
114
114
Kathy HURTLES closer to the silhouette...
TWB 56.
She turns. It's Irka. Kathy cranks the wheel, driving off the
road and onto...
A WIDE FIELD
The SUV is jolted by the uneven terrain. Irka peers into the
blinding light. Then runs...
115
115
Viko drives up the deserted street. SUDDENLY two BATTERED
MERCEDES fly out from SIDE ROADS and block the way.
Viko BRAKES hard. Raya is thrown to the side of the Van.
116
116
Kathy stops the car, jumps out, and runs after Irka.
KATHY
Irka!
Irka's legs start to give. Kathy gains on her.
117
117
Viko REVERSES and TURNS -- but a Mercedes ROARS -- 'round the
other side -- BASHING the side of the Van.
118
118
Kathy feels Irka slowing down.
119

Two MEN jump out of the cars. With RIFLES. Viko SPEEDS
forward. But..
GUNFIRE. Raya SCREAMS. A TIRE BLOWN OUT.
The Van SKIDS to a HALT. Viko SMASHES against the window.
Raya tries the doors, but they won't open. She wails,
SLAMMING herself against the door. Desperate.
120
120
Kathy raises her arms, waving...
Irka turns. Kathy can see her clearly now, disoriented beyond
bearing. Irka shields her face from the distant headlights.
TWB 57.
Kathy steps out of their glare. And then...Irka recognizes
her. She collapses, releasing confused tears. Kathy walks
over, careful, slowly bending to help.
IRKA
Please... let me die.
Kathy holds her. As the young girl cries.
121
121
The Men approach the Van. Raya's BANGING ECHOES from inside,
reverberating around the empty street. Nobody can hear her...
122
122
Isolated stars peek through clouds, drifting over dark hills
stretching far into the horizon....
123
124
A MIDDLE AGED COUPLE lead Irka inside a small home. In the
MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. Shrouded in the black night. Nobody will
find her here. In the doorway, Irka turns to Kathy and Viko.
IRKA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
Where is Raya?
They stare back at her. The woman closes the door. Kathy and
Viko stand in the dead silence. His face bruised.
KATHY
Let's go back to the Florida Bar--
VIKO
You think he'd be that stupid?
KATHY
I don't care! I have nothing else to go
on, do I?
Adrenalin overtaking sadness. Viko follows Kathy to the car.
TWB 58.
125
125
Kathy and Viko pull up. It's in full swing.
126
127
Kathy steps out. Furious.
VIKO
They moved them already.
KATHY
Fuck!
At the end of her rope.
128
129
A BROWN VAN snakes through the distant mountain roads.
130
131
Kathy stands by her SUV, watching MONITORS set off for the
day. Then she sees...
Fred Murray emerge with COLLEAGUES, laughing. He stops when
He sees Kathy, gazing over, serious.
132
132
Kathy and Fred walk between the parked cars.
KATHY
She's fifteen. I'm begging you--
FRED MURRAY
I don't know what you're talking about.
KATHY
If you know any of the other bars he
owns, anything... I'm appealing to--
FRED MURRAY
Hey. I'm gonna say this one more time.
And you can put this down in your
investigation on me. I don't know what
you're talking about.
He leaves. Kathy stands, a black speck in the patchwork of
white UN SUVs spread across the lot.
133
136
A WHITE VOLKSWAGON RABBIT speeds though the Sarajevo hills.
Madeleine is elegant in a suit. Kathy looks at her black
dress, self-conscious.
KATHY
Is there a specific way of addressing the
High Commissioner of the Mission?
MADELEINE
I call him Bill.
Kathy nods, nervous. They pull into a circular drive...
137
137
The house is incongruous in its context: Manicured gardens,
remodelled facade. And tonight its BLACK TIE and CATERING.
An elegant WOMAN comes to greet them. She is...
MADELEINE
(familiar) Mrs. Ambassador! How do we do?
JANET WELLS
We do what we can. Great to see you
Madeleine.
Janet smiles with the delicatesse of a diplomatic spouse.
MADELEINE
I hope you don't mind, I've brought along
a friend. This is Kathy Bolkovac.
Kathy holds out her hand, a little nervous.
JANET WELLS
Great. I need as many gal pals as I can
get. Look at this place.
She gestures toward the room. A haze of cigar smoke hovers
over the gaggle of men. Kathy's eyes zero in on
Bill Hynes
Surrounded by a group of JAPANESE DIPLOMATS. Bill notices her
and Madeleine. He waves, familiar. Madeleine nods, humoring.
AMBASSADOR JOHN WELLS, 40s, slides his hand on Janet's back.
AMBASSADOR WELLS
What are your thoughts on dinner?
TWB 62.
JANET WELLS
I think people are still busy drinking.
John shakes Madeleine's hand, darting his eyes over Kathy.
AMBASSADOR WELLS
Speaking of, what can I get you ladies?
Madeleine looks at Kathy.
KATHY
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. Ah, I'll have
a wine please.
AMBASSADOR WELLS
(nodding) Coming right up. Madeleine,
white for you?
Kathy notices the respect he shows her. Janet leads them in,
chatting with Madeleine. Kathy surveys the room full of
dignitaries.
138
138
A stunning view of Sarajevo at night. Kathy stands alone. A
waiter offers her a convoluted hors d'oeuvre. She takes it,
gracious. Trying to figure out what it is when...
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Nice view, no?
Kathy turns to... PETER WARD, 40s, smoking a cigarette.
KATHY
Oh I... I just needed some air.
PETER WARD
Trust me, I know the feeling. I hate
these stuffy events. You never know
anyone's agenda.
He eyes her. She looks past him... At Bill Hynes. Peter sees.
PETER WARD (CONT'D)
Oh... well that's a plan.
MADELEINE (O.S.)
Actually, I had a different one in mind.
Madeleine and Janet come through the door. Peter stubs out
his cigarette, and moves back inside.
TWB 63.
MADELEINE (CONT'D)
(arm around Janet) Behind every good
man...
PATIO - SHORT TIME LATER
Janet's eyes betray empathy. She shakes her head, upset.
JANET WELLS
They just left her there? At the border?
Poor girl... Just the psychological
trauma. How can I help?
KATHY
She's very vulnerable to re-trafficking.
Internationals got her in this situation.
We owe her the chance to get out.
Janet is keen to follow, but a little lost.
MADELEINE
We want to repatriate Irka to the United
States and find her a foster family. I
was hoping you could use your influence--
Janet holds up her hand, nodding emphatically.
JANET WELLS
We're going to find her a home.
Kathy eyes Madeleine. Impressed.
KATHY
I also think the American embassy should
be aware of some of the problems we're
having with our officers.
Madeleine interjects...
MADELEINE
Your help with Irka's case can really
raise awareness in the Mission around the
issue of trafficking.
Madeleine gives her a reassuring glance. Kathy sees the
difference between a cop and a diplomat.
139
140
Sun over the hills. A DOG follows a YOUNG BOY, 5, through a
field. The boy stops, seeing a BROWN VAN down the road.
He runs, waving as the van approaches. It slows to meet him.
In the van... Ivan rolls down the window.
BOY (SERBIAN)
Can I come with you?
IVAN (SERBIAN)
Not today.
The boy looks down, disappointed.
IVAN (CONT'D)
Tell your mother I'll be home for dinner.
Then you and I will go for a walk. I have
a present for you.
BOY
What is it?
Ivan shrugs jokingly. Then smiles as he drives away.
141
141
The brown van pulls up. Ivan comes around it, and opens the
back door. He reaches in and pulls out... AN OLD BICYCLE.
TANJO (SERBIAN)
You couldn't buy him a new one? You have
money now.
IVAN (SERBIAN)
I'll fix this one up this afternoon. I
had one like it.
Tanjo lights a cigarette, moving to the destroyed building.
TANJO
They're downstairs. I want to get them
out today.
142
143
Madeleine stands before a small group of REPORTERS.
MADELEINE
The young woman, who shall remain
anonymous, arrived in Bosnia as a victim
of sex trafficking and has survived
horrific abuse.
(MORE)
TWB 66.
MADELEINE (CONT'D)
Ordinarily she would be repatriated to
her country of origin. But because she is
an orphan, she finds herself without a
home. I'm pleased to announce that we
have found a foster family in the United
States. I want to thank Janet Wells for
her assistance in making this happen. I
believe this can stand as a signal that
the International community in Bosnia and
beyond is finally ready to recognize the
growing epidemic of sex trafficking, a
human rights abuse as abhorrent as the
war crimes that drew the International
Community to intervene in Bosnia in the
first place. Thank you.
REPORTER
Now that the UN is finally recognizing
sex-trafficking, how are you going to
monitor it?
Reporters flock with questions. Kathy stands in the back,
proud. On the other side, Rick Jones watches.
144
144
Kathy and Madeleine emerge, buzzing with their success.
MADELEINE
Nothing on Raya?
Kathy shakes her head, saddened.
KATHY
I've sent an APB out to all police
stations and UN field offices... But I'm
pushing ahead with the other girls in
Milena's shelter. I'm creating a photo-
line-up using the UN ID database, so they
can identify all internationals involved.
We've got to make them accountable.
145
152
A large WOOD HOUSE with a neon CAMEL sits in the mountains
above the city of TUZLA. A VAN pulls up.
153
156
ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. Kathy comes out. Seeing... IPTF
OFFICERS. All eyeing her. She hurries through them.
157
158
A blast of light through Kathy's windshield. The lot is
empty. She looks at a PILE OF REPORTS on the passenger seat.
159
162
Kathy jogs along a ridge, with a view high over Sarajevo.
Determined, panting... she pushes past her fatigue.
163
167
Kathy. Unstrung. She crosses the labyrinth of WHITE SUVs. She
looks up at the OSCE towers. Feeling watched.
TWO SFOR SOLDIERS walk toward her. Eyeing her. She slips a
car key between her fingers, arming herself. Watching them
as... They pass. Kathy picks up her pace. Getting to...
HER SUV. Her pulse RACING. PARANOID. She checks around...
The lot is empty. Quiet. She is alone.
168
168
A row of international flags flap in the wind.
169
172
Halyna boards a plane with PASSENGERS, but without Raya.
173
176
Distant music echoes through the night. VOICES of GUYS
hanging out on their balconies. Kathy crosses the lot,
cutting through the dark night fog.
177
177
Kathy drives. Wide awake. The only vehicle on the road.
178
178
Kathy sits in the SUV. Staring at the station. THROUGH THE
WINDOW... Jan works the late shift alone.
179
181
The DUTCH CONTINGENT boards a bus. Kathy stands aside with
Jan. Saying goodbye... Franz pats Jan on the back.
FRANZ
I'll keep an eye out.
Jan shakes his hand. Franz winks at Kathy.
FRANZ (CONT'D)
(to Kathy) It's finally our time.
She smiles, soft. Drained of energy.
JAN
Get outta here.
FRANZ
Anything you need you call, okay? He'll
kill both of us if you don't.
Franz moves away leaving the two alone. Jan hugs Kathy.
JAN
You come to me... when you're done.
He kisses her. The bus engines start.
182
184
Madeleine's UN Volkswagon pulls up. Milena waits, smiling.
MADELEINE
After we got Irka repatriated, I had some
calls from other private parties that
were interested in helping. We've
gathered $40,000 so far. I've applied for
matching funds, so that... we can
completely rebuild this shelter.
MILENA
Separate from the GDA. We run it our way.
The victims come first.
MADELEINE
Things are changing Kathy.
Kathy is moved, seeing a light at the end of this. The three
women stand, united... Then... A SHELTER VOLUNTEER comes out.
SHELTER VOLUNTEER
There's an important call inside.
MILENA
Excuse me.
SHELTER VOLUNTEER
No. The call is for Kathy.
185
185
Ivan puts a bag in a car trunk. He turns to... Mara
TWB 85.
IVAN (RUSSIAN)
Remember I can bring you back here the
second you fuck up.
Mara nods. He shakes her hand. Ivan hands her a passport. She
jumps into the car. It's an odd farewell. Ivan heads back to
THE OASIS
He scans the room. His eyes land on Luba. Raya watches Ivan
nod to Luba. A silent exchange: Luba accepts Mara's role.
SUDDENLY... HONKING. OUTSIDE a car speeds up.
The two SUITS from last night appear at the door... Without
the girls.
186
186
Kathy slows... Seeing local police in the distance.
187
187
Kathy pulls up. Through gathered local cops, REVEAL...
Julia and Tanya. Disoriented. Still in last night's clothing.
188
188
Julia and Tanya are FRANTIC, talking fast.
JULIA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
They take us home. They were so drunk. We
run.
TANYA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
There are more girls! You must to get
them out! Go now!
They appeal to Kathy.
JULIA
Oasis Bar. In mountains.
Kathy eyes Viko. As the girls talk at her, Kathy knows she
was never going home. THIS is where she needs to be.
189
193
Viko follows Kathy out.
VIKO
If there are records showing those girls
came through the border with IPTF--
KATHY
Then you have conspiracy to traffick.
And I can take it to Bill Hynes. That's
enough to do a raid that will stick.
VIKO
The main border station keeps the logs.
Kathy heads to her SUV. Viko shakes his head -- points at an
old TRABBANT (a life-size matchbox car).
194
194
The ride is bumpy. Viko shouts over the engine...
VIKO
Best if it looks like a local matter. Get
more info. You be my UN monitor, okay?
Kathy smiles, cramped, but appreciative of his help.
195
195
Viko talks to a BORDER COP sitting at an ancient Mac
Computer. Kathy notices a calendar of Pamela Anderson
frolicking in foamy surf.
VIKO
So when a vehicle is stopped, you'll keep
all this on file here?
TWB 88.
BORDER COP
Of course! It's our fucking job!
VIKO
And other stations up the border send all
their files to you?
BORDER COP
Some do, some don't. Fifty-fifty chance.
Disappointing. Viko lights a smoke, offers one to the cop.
BORDER COP (CONT'D)
You say 30 minutes outside Sarajevo?
Maybe Visegrad? You might be lucky. Lanky
guy in their archives loves to send
files.
Kathy looks hopefully at Viko, who shrugs. Clicking...
BORDER COP (CONT'D)
Okay, 11th... (mumbling) ... No, no. You
like?.. Big exciting to watch Bosnian
police do boring things?
Kathy smiles. He turns back, clicking. Then stops.
BORDER COP (CONT'D)
You owe me! UN vehicle with 6 girls in
back. Stanley Harris.
He turns proudly to them.
BORDER COP (CONT'D)
What you think? All his little sisters
come to visit from America?
Viko looks knowingly at Kathy.
KATHY
That's it. Conspiracy to traffick.
He slaps a key. The file prints out on an old daisy-wheel
printer. Kathy scans the pages...
196
196
Kathy and Viko hurry to the car.
KATHY
We arrest the buyer first. The bar-owner.
The border log corroborates the victims'
testimony. Once he's in custody, we raid
his place and get those girls out.
TWB 89.
Kathy jumps INSIDE THE CAR...
KATHY (CONT'D)
The raid has to be small. No-one knows
the bar till we're on our way.
197
199
Kathy leans on a balcony overlooking the main plaza at HQ.
She observes the sleek facade of honor and power.
She straightens, and walks away without looking back.
200
201
A police vans SPEEDS down the road. TWO UN VANS follow.
202
203
Viko pulls up to the bar. The UN SUV skids into the shadows.
Viko and Danik go inside. Kathy glances back at her IPTF
officers as they -- Pull their visors down, and WAIT -- Quiet
-- Wind in the trees -- MUSIC ECHOING from inside as...
Viko and Danik emerge, chatting with Ivan. Suddenly...
Ivan jolts back -- COPS grab him -- He's YELLING --
HANDCUFFED -- Kicking. Punching -- They PUSH him into the VAN
-- Viko SLAMS the door, turns to the UN van and nods...
204
206
Kathy paces frantically in the darkness. Eyes wild.
Viko comes out the door, as it hits her like a blunt kick in
the face: sheer helplessness...
She TURNS - Fuck diplomacy, Fuck bureaucracy, Fuck protocol -
and RUSHES back towards the bar. Viko stops her, grabs her...
Kathy's eyes filling with tears she cannot cry -- Her heart
breaking. Viko holds her tight, and pulls her away.
207
207
Kathy sits in total silence, her face white, staring ahead.
208
216
An IPTF VAN stops. The window rolls down: It's Mike Sears.
TWB 98.
KATHY (V.O.)
...Their clientele consists of SFOR,
IPTF, local police, and International
employees. Worse, they have become
involved in the trade itself.
217
217
Halyna sits at an empty table. Her face gaunt from worry.
KATHY (V.O.)
...It is time each and every one of you
realize this is a serious organized
crime, with enormous profits.
218
224
THROUGH THE WINDOW: Kathy paces, nervous, telling all...
Madeleine stands, resolved. Says something. Kathy nods,
skeptical. Madeleine picks up the PHONE.
225
226
Sulpher lights. Kathy approaches the building. The American
Flags hang from the windows. But it's quiet. Spookily quiet.
Kathy moves quickly. Alert.
Something moves -- Behind A CAR -- Flash of A MAN -- Kathy
picks up her pace -- Eyes forward, but... The Man...
Comes up behind her. Kathy flinches, as... he grabs her. She
turns quick. Realizing... It's Franz.
FRANK
Let's go. Like nothing's wrong.
227
228
Franz lays talcum powder under a UN SUV.
229
232
An aerial glide over the mountains of Bosnia.
TWB 104.
233
234
The sound of Luba's scream fades over the morning. The wide
horizon is calm. But a closer look reveals...
235
235
POLICE cordon off a RIVER BANK. Through an opening we see...
Viko. Keeping local cops at bay. Behind him is... Kathy. In
civilian clothes. Standing over a...
DEAD BODY. Raya. Kathy stares, expressionless. Viko clears
the cops out. Kathy turns, and retches. She pulls air into
lungs, then straightens. She looks up to the trees, the apex
of this leafy cathedral, as if invoking some higher power.
236
241
Ambassador Wells in ushered toward a UN PLANE. Into a PHONE:
AMBASSADOR WELLS
I can hardly hear you. Can you yell-
KATHY
OK. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
AMBASSADOR WELLS
YES. GO AHEAD.
KATHY
THIS IS KATHRYN BOLKOVAC. I WANTED TO
DISCUSS MY TERMINATION--
AMBASSADOR WELLS
THIS IS BETWEEN YOU AND THE IPTF.
KATHY
OK. IT'S JUST THAT I WAS TOLD YOU MET
WITH MR. HYNES ABOUT ME.
AMBASSADOR WELLS
THAT IS TOTALLY UNTRUE! WHO TOLD YOU
THAT? I BARELY RECOGNIZE YOUR NAME. I
CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.
The PLANE ENGINES are roaring. Kathy can't hear him. She
slams down the phone. Staring at the recorder. Thinking.
242
UN SUV/ UNMHQ PARKING LOT - DAY
242
Kathy, parked. Rips open a CASSETTE TAPE. She looks at her
personage - this isn't fitting anywhere.
RAIN hits the windshield. The glass becomes blurry in the
haze of water. Kathy grabs a UN windbreaker from the back.
Sticks the recorder in its pocket.
243
243
Kathy flashes her UN ID. The guard eyes her. PASSERS-BY also.
TWB 107.
244
252
Kathy moves through TOURISTS browsing for jewelry. Holding
the gym bag tight. She turns a corner down a
SIDE STREET
240
Narrow. TWO PEOPLE WIDE.. Keeping her eyes to the ground.
240
BILL HYNES (O.S.)
We've had a UN inspection by senior
investigators from New York. We've had
inspectors from the State Department.
253
254
Kathy turns into a PIZZA SHOP. Flanked by AMERICAN FAMILIES.
She walks, knowingly... into a BACK PATIO.
258
Small and dark. Kathy spots... A WOMAN in the back.
258
TWB 111.
255
255
Kathy sits across from JOANNA PAUL SMITH. Eyeing her gym bag.
JOANNA PAUL SMITH (BRITISH ACCENT)
I've been working at Human Rights Watch
for fifteen years. We've been keeping
close tabs on this. No one has come
forward with anything solid before.
KATHY
I have everything you need. When I arrive
in Amsterdam safely, I will go on record.
Joanna nods, a glimmer of admiration. Kathy stands, shakes
her hand, and leaves... Disappearing into the crowd.
256
256
Kathy drives alone. Checking the rearview mirror.
A car pulls up behind her. It's bright light blinds Kathy.
The car closes in on her. She winces, but... The car passes.
It's just Kathy on the road. The gym bag on the seat beside
her. The culmination of everything she's been fighting for.
Her red tail lights disappear into a dark mountain tunnel.
Fade up on:
257
257
REPORTERS snap pictures of Kathy.
BBC REPORTER (O.S.)
Expecting a verdict today. Two years ago,
Ms. Bolkovac took her case against her
employer, Dyncorp, to an industrial
tribunal in Southampton, because the
company is governed by UK employment law.
258
259
Luba walks through a crowd. She stops at a fountain and looks
around, nervous. Then she spots... Mara.
MARA (RUSSIAN)
Ivan let you go. This is what you do now.
Luba nods, understanding.
BACK IN THE COURTROOM
Karen squeezes Kathy's hand. Kathy looks to the back of the
courtroom... Erin smiles at Kathy. So proud.
JUDGE SWISS holds up Kathy's TAPE RECORDER...
Kathy straightens. The Judge reads from a VERDICT. Karen's
face lights up. Kathy's won. Jan breathes, relieved.
