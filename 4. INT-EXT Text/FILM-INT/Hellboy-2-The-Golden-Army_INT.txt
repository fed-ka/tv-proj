CAMERA lingers on the bloated features of a stone FERTILITY
GODDESS.

AUCTIONEER
Pre-Celtic votive sculpture is in granite
and has been dated circa 700 B.C.
Like the guests, the AUCTIONEER is dressed in formal wear.
TV MONITORS display the image of the statue so the bidders
can have a closer look.
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
We'll open the bidding at two hundred
thousand dollars.
A DISTINGUISHED BUYER raises his hand-
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
Two hundred and seventy-five, and... we
have three hundred, thank you Mr. Van
Hausen - Three hundred thousand once-
A FEMALE BIDDER raise her hand-
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
And Three hundred and fifty thousand,
thank you Mrs. Bernstein-
As the auction carries on, a STEWARD leaves the room and
heads down -
-a darkened corridor where other STEWARDS wheel auction lots
to and from the sales room.
The STEWARD notices an open window at the end of the
corridor. He leans out and looks down. Ten stories below - a
snow-covered alley.
Suddenly, he sees the SHADOWY FIGURE above the window frame,
clinging to the smooth granite wall!!
STEWARD
What the h-
Quick as lightning, the SHADOWY FIGURE covers the steward's
mouth. When he withdraws his hand, the steward's mouth has
VANISHED!!!
The Shadowy Figure grabs the hapless man by the lapels,
hauling him outside and dangling him over the void.
Far below: a spiked wrought-iron fence.
HELLBOY 2 3
SHADOWY FIGURE
A silent human- almost as good as a dead
one...
(BEAT)
Almost.
He releases the STEWARD, who falls-
-DOWN-
-DOWN-
-down- TKKCT!!!
Flailing in utter silence. All the way. Onto the fence.
The Figure slips through the window and moves into the-
5
AUCTIONEER
And now, for our next item. Lot #777.
Two STEWARDS wheel in an oaken box and open it. Nestled in
maroon velvet is an eight-inch, ornately decorated arc of
gold.
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
A once-in-lifetime opportunity. For the
first time in auction. A piece of the
Royal Crown of Bethmoora... A precious
artifact dating from the Atrebatean
period. Exquisite workmanship in 24 carat
gold.
The lights flicker briefly, provoking MURMURS from the
audience.
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
Please- please- ladies and gentlemen...
may I have your attention. As I was
saying, observe the fanciful creatures
adorning the outer surface, figures from
a lost mythology...
The lights go out completely. From the sudden darkness, the
Shadowy Figure speaks up.
SHADOWY FIGURE
Lost- ? Not at all. Forgotten by you
perhaps, but very much alive.
BELLBOY 2 4
A few emergency lights come on, revealing The Shadowy
Figure, who walks down the aisle to confront the auctioneer.
AUCTIONEER
Sir, would you please identify yourself?
I see no badge or-
SHADOWY FIGURE
Shall we just say that I am the rightful
owner of this piece?
He seizes the artifact. The auctioneer grabs a phone and
hits a button.
AUCTIONEER
(to a Steward)
Security- Call Security-
This is an outrage- An-
The SHADOWY FIGURE reaches into his pockets and throws a
handful of seeds at the Auctioneer's feet.
AUCTIONEER
-Outrage of-
KRRRRR-K the seeds sprout into massive, thick branches and
roots and instantly engulfing the Auctioneer amidst coils of
wooden branches, crushing him. They grow and grow until they
crack the ceiling!!
Soon the Auctioneer disappears, and in its place stands a
compact, twisted tree. Tiny creatures emerge from its
branches and crawl around the trunk.
CRASH!!!!! Four SECURITY GUARDS come flying through the side
doors and land in the aisles with a THUD!!! The spectators
scream.
WINK walks in. He carries two large IRON BOXES on his back.
On the sides of the boxes A ROYAL SEAL, embossed in the
metal.
People cower in the corners, SCREAMING in terror and
disbelief.
WINK shrugs the iron boxes to the floor with a CLANG!!!!
Inside them, little clawed THINGS are scrabbling - mewling,
fast and hungry!!
At the Shadowy Figure's signal, the troll opens the cages...
and the people's SCREAMS redouble.
HELLBOY 2 5
SHADOWY FIGURE
May this remind you all why you once
feared the dark...
A multitude of eyes glint in the darkness, rows and rows of
tiny teeth shine greedily. They lunge at CAMERA.
CUT TO:
A Christmas tree glows next to the fireplace; Mozart is
playing on the aquarium's underwater speakers. Floating in
warm water on a cloud of bubbles is ABE SAPIEN, lost in the
music.
A blurry figure approaches and raps a ring finger against
the tank: It's TOM MANNING, chief FBI liaison to the BPRD.
Looking dyspeptic, he presses a folder against the glass:
TOP SECRET.
MANNING
Hey, Fishstick- We gotta talk.
As they walk down the hall, manning shows Abe.
MANNING
Look at that- Each photo costs a fortune
to suppress. And then, naturally, they
pop up on the net.
CAMERA moves in on Abe's breathing apparatus. It's sleek,
more modern, fitting snugly to his gills and neck. His
goggles are new, too.
He examines a photo of Hellboy bounding down a city street,
brandishing his mighty, high-caliber Samaritan. He's looking
straight at the camera lens.
BELLBOY 2 6
ABE
Oh, Lord- He's smiling in this one.
MANNING
I know- It's not just the money. It's the
provocation. This is asking for trouble.
His ego-
Manning leans close to a voice-recognition security mike.
MANNING
"Man-ning..."
He enunciates each syllable perfectly, then turns to Abe.
MANNING (CONT'D)
-is out of control. And I think it's all
deliberate on his part.
(BEAT)
He hates me.
Layers of steel doors trundle open in sequence.
ABE
No, he doesn't. He's just- enthusiastic.
As they approach HB's room...
MANNING (CONT'D)
How are things between him and Liz?
ABE
Oh, you know. The usual. Since they moved
in together- Good days and bad.
On cue, the concrete wall explodes!'.! A massive BALL OF FIRE
swings the final steel door open, almost tearing it off its
hinges.
ABE (CONT'D)
Then again, there are the really bad days-
Manning and Abe cower behind a pillar. Once the explosion
dies away- Hellboy's revealed, lying on the floor, his back
smoking and in flames.
HELLBOY
Oh, hi Blue- Manning-
He puts out a small flame on his forearm and steps into the
room.
HELLBOY 2 7
HELLBOY'S VOICE
(yelling at Liz)
Well- I'm not afraid of you! You hear??
Abe and Manning peek inside-
HB stumbles around the rubble, wreathed in smoke. He holds a
bunch of blackened LPs and 8-track cassettes.
HELLBOY
(yelling at Liz)
Look- I have one rule! One- "Don't touch
my stuff -"
Liz appears, shimmering in a halo of blue flame.
HB's pulls a few LP albums out of the garbage bin.
LIZ
You have the same album on CD, LP and an
8 track- An 8 track!!!
HELLBOY
You can't listen to Al Green on a CD!!
You just can't!! Oh, and 8 track was the
way to go- one day mankind will realize
its mistake.
LIZ
What about me? I need some space! Not
much, but just enough to find- to find-
my- toothbrush.
She flares up, losing control...
HELLBOY
Is that what this is about?? Your
toothbrush's right there, behind you-
(Liz turns)
There- there- with the cat food!!
Wrinkling her nose in disgust, Liz plucks a toothbrush from
a heap of spilled cat kibble.
LIZ
Damn it, Red- there's no room for me
here. You can't just act like-
Suddenly, the alarm SOUNDS. Hellboy is elated.
BELLBOY 2 8
HELLBOY
Oh, heavenly bells are ringing!
10
Surrounded by racks of weapons, Abe, Hellboy and Liz suit
up.
Tight-lipped and grumpy, Liz dons black army pants and a
leather jacket. She jams an automatic handgun into her
utility belt.
They move into a vast garage, big as a stadium. It houses a
fleet of planes, cars, boats, helicopters and tanks.
They load weapons and ammo on board their usual
transport/mobile quarters - a GARBAGE TRUCK.
The perfect gentleman, Hellboy holds the door open for Liz.
The truck interior has been refurbished with more high-tech
equipment.
As the engine starts and the headlights blaze...
CUT TO:
- NIGHT 11
Completely refurbished, with a BANK OF MONITORS and a large
digital WORLD MAP, tracking each Paranormal.
MANNING
Oh, Jeez- did you see the crowds?
He offers HB a couple of cigars and lights one for him.
MANNING
This is midtown Manhattan... Will you
promise to be careful? You'll use
discretion?
HELLBOY 2 9
HELLBOY
Piece of cake. In and out... no one will
see me. You have my word-
A sarcastic guffaw from Liz.
HELLBOY (CONT'D)
(GLARING)
I can be discreet if I want to be-
They exit the truck and enter the building. Manning sighs.
CUT TO:
14 TNT. SALES ROOM - NIGHT 14
A BPRD agent (AGENT MUDD), Abe and Liz move into the big,
dark sales room, past a jumble of overturned chairs. They
use plasma-screen night-vision scanners to survey the
devastation.
LIZ
No one here. No survivors. No bodies.
NOTHING-
15 TNT. CORRIDOR - SAME 15
Two agents lead the way down the adjacent hallway. Hellboy
follows, a few feet behind.
HB trains his flashlight on a fallen display case. Broken
glass glitters.
HELLBOY
Same story here, babe-
LIZ
(on the intercom)
Don't call me babe-
HELLBOY
I said "Abe"- I'm sorry- wrong channel-
Hellboy falls back to talk privately on the intercom.
HELLBOY (CONT'D)
Liz- UM-?
LIZ
(on the intercom)
Yes?
HELLBOY 2 10
HELLBOY
(WHISPERS)
When we get home... I'm gonna clean the
place up; okay? Even the bathroom.
LIZ
That's not the problem and you know it.
HELLBOY
(WHISPERS)
What? You want to get rid of the cats?
You can't mean that-
LIZ
No. That's not the problem either-
HELLBOY
(WHISPERS)
Then, what--?
LIZ
Not now, for God's sake!
Abe, Liz and Agent Mudd fan out, moving cautiously toward
the auctioneer's overturned podium.
Abe discovers an empty cage... and on the iron door, the
embossed ROYAL SEAL. Abe hears a high-pitched chitter-
chatter and looks around: Nothing.
ABE
Red- I'm afraid I do detect some activity-
As the agent and Liz inspect the other iron cages, he
extends his webbed fingers.
LIZ
What kind of creature?
ABE
CREATURES-
HELLBOY
There's more than one-?
He hears a scratching noise.
HELLBOY 2 11
ABE
(on the intercom)
More- Many more-
HELLBOY
How many- ten-?
ABE
No. Maybe a hundred- or two-
HELLBOY
(HUFFS)
MPPF-
As HB nears a wall, it bulges and splits open!! The ceiling
cracks, too. He hurriedly loads a pair of lever-action
SHOTGUN.
ABE
They're all around us-
Sounds of MOVEMENT from burrowing, unseen creatures-
HELLBOY
What are they???
ABE
Uh- If I'm right, we should leave now and
ask for backup.
Abe finds a human femur, wet and gnawed.
ABE
Ah, I knew it.
(BEAT )
They're vicious and cruel and-
The floor ripples with activity.
ABE (CONT'D)
Have you noticed the floor??
HELLBOY
(looking around)
Uh- thick rug, deep pile, light brown-
ABE
Red- there is no rug-
Hellboy lifts his foot, realizing he's been walking on an
inch-thick layer of- ahem- poo.
HELLBOY
Aw, crap-
ABE
Precisely...
(BEAT)
These things have a very active
metabolism. They, um- excrete as soon as
they eat and then need to eat some more.
There are no corpses 'cause there are no
LEFTOVERS-
HELLBOY 2 13
HELLBOY
Spit it out, brother blue. What are they?
ABE
Alright, but-
LIZ
Damn it Abe, just tell us!
ABE
Okay, then- They're- um- tooth fairies.
LIZ
Abe, c'mon- cut the crap.
She checks her boots, sticky with poo-
ABE
Third century, the Teutoburg forest.
Famished. They feed on calcium-
(BEAT)
And they do go for the teeth first. How
do you think they got that name "Tooth
Fairies"??
Liz senses movement in the darkness. She holds out her hand
and starts a small fire on her palm.
She pans it like a torch, firelight sweeping the darkness-
NOTHING-
Agent MARBLE comes upon a lonely little creature peeping out
from a crack in the wall. It's about 9 inches high, with
olive skin and almond-shaped eyes gleaming in the half-
light. It whimpers softly.
AGENT MARBLE
Hey, this guy is cute -i.
He reaches out to touch it.
AGENT MARBLE
Are you scared, buddy?
Across the room Hellboy sees the Agent nearing the Fairy.
HELLBOY 2 14
HELLBOY
No, don't-
The thing SNARLS, leaps and sinks its tiny teeth into
MARBLE's finger. Then it dives under MARBLE's shirt and goes
to work.
MARBLE gasps and drops his gun. Dozens of creatures emerge
from the crack on the wall and crawl into Marble's clothing.
Gasping, he tears open his shirt as claws and teeth dig
in.. ribs crack... blood spurts. The agent falls.
Liz lights up both hands, illuminating a surging tidal wave
of hungry critters that engulfs the room, gnawing at the
wallpaper, the furniture!
The things sweep over Agent Mudd, ripping into him like
wriggling piranhas.
ABE
(backing away)
Oh, my-
Hellboy protects the other agent, but he feels the things
swarming over him, reaching for his lips and ears...
Bellowing in disgust, he fires his shotguns, splattering
dozens of creatures onto the walls.
Every blast, however, reveals a buzzing, hungry mass pouring
from the walls. HB claws at dozens more, which cling to him
like baby monkeys.
The room is awash with hissing creatures, crawling over the
iron cages. For an awful moment, no sign of Liz or Abe.
HELLBOY
(sudden panic)
LIZ!!
In reply, he hears a faint scream. He bats at the things
with the SHOTGUN, wading further into the room.
HELLBOY 2 15
HELLBOY (CONT'D)
Liz!! Where are you - ?!
He sees a horde of little beasts gnawing at the metal bars
of a cage...
.Liz cowering inside. Hellboy just has time to look deep
into her eyes. A quick moment of silent communion.
HELLBOY
Do it, Liz, do it!!!
And Liz obeys. Closing her eyes she-
LIZ
(WHISPERS)
The fire's not my enemy. It is part of me-
-gets covered by a gentle film of blue flame.
ABE
UH-OH-
He takes refuge as-
LIZ
It is mine-
-the gentle flame blooms into a cloud of fire. Liz goes
supernova. BAMMM!!!
Hellboy stomps down hard, popping some creatures, bashing
others with the butt of his shotgun. As flames leap up, the
things regroup and renew their attack.
Liz and Abe run for the stairs.
LIZ
Red, Red, this way-
Hellboy kicks the critters away, shooting again and again.
HELLBOY
No- I'll deal with them- NOW.
He dumps his backpack and pulls out a belt full of VULCAN 66
grenades. Holds it high.
HELLBOY (CONT'D)
Vulcan 66, boys! Come and get 'em-
Liz and Abe take cover on the stairs. They see Hellboy
luring the tooth fairies toward the windows overlooking the
street.
10
As the creatures climb onto him, he pulls the pins on all
grenades. Soon he's a mass of swarming, gnarly fairies and
THEN-
LIZ
(YELLING)
No, Red- Not there! Move away from the-
K-B00000MMMMMM`IN!!!!!!!!! A massive explosion-
29 TNT / EXT - AUCTION HOUSE 29
Like a cannonball, HB flies out the upper floor window.
A ball of flame, he arcs downward, covered in fighting,
writhing fairies.
Below, the onlookers scatter as the massive Red Giant lands
in their midst, cracking the pavement.
30
Liz and Abe go to the window and look down. A TV CAMERA LENS
ZOOMS IN ON THEM BOTH.
HELLBOY 2 17
LIZ
(into her radio)
HB?? HB?? Are you alright??
Guard 1 watches TV. HB is on the screen, surrounded by press
and TV.
GUARD 1
Check it out. That guy's make-up is so
fake. I mean, come on, solid red-
Guard 2 is cleaning his gun.
GUARD 2
And what's with his forehead? Is that
goggles?
He looks out the window and sees the THE SHADOWY FIGURE
standing by the gates.
GUARD 2 (CONT'D)
Hey, we got us a wino.
He grabs his nightstick and steps outside.
35
Guard 1 tunes in a game show. Looks outside-
-no sign of his buddy. Behind him, at the window, WINK
appears. Its MASSIVE ARM punches through the wall and hauls
off the GUARD and then slams his massive IRON MACE down!!!
BAMMKM ! ! ! !
THE SHADOWY FIGURE wipes off his sword over the crumpled
remains of Guard 2. Screams and bone crunching can be heard.
WINK emerges from behind the shack.
HELLBOY 2 19
Effortlessly, the SHADOWY FIGURE vaults the chainlink fence
and walks into the roundhouse. WINK smashes the fence and
follows him through.
A few pigeons flutter through a forest of steel pillars.
Radiant fingers of moonlight shine on the old train tracks.
THE SHADOWY FIGURE and WINK stop as a dozen ROYAL GUARDS in
helmets and light armor march out from a tunnel.
After a pause, a CHAMBERLAIN joins them. He bows low in a
show of respect for the Shadowy Figure.
CHAMBERLAIN
Prince Nuada- He awaits you- Please,
follow me, Sire.
The Chamberlain leads the way down a tunnel lined with more
guards. The armed men surround the Prince as they stop at an
intersection.
The Prince prepares to unsheathe his sword- WINK growls.
CHAMBERLAIN
I beg you, your majesty. Before entering
the chamber you surrender your sword.
PRINCE
I will not.
CHAMBERLAIN
Then, I regret to say, you may not see
your father. It is the protocol, sire.
For peasant and prince alike. Please- for
the last time- surrender your sword.
A tense beat and then the Prince relents.
The guards accept his weapon, carefully pat him down-
PRINCE
Mr. Wink however- cannot dispose of his
weapon. He will wait here-
WINK snorts as the Prince is finally escorted through a
huge, rusting iron door.
HELLBOY 2 20
An abandoned machine shop functions as a council chamber.
High-ranking heads of outlandish MAGICK FAMILIES are there:
goblins, trolls, dwarves and elves.
At the center sits KING BALOR The One-armed King of Elfland
and, behind him, the willowy, beautiful PRINCESS NUALA, the
Prince's sister.
Both on the King's chest and her own, a large golden piece
dangles from a chain.
Nuala's resemblance to the Prince is uncanny, down to the
fine scars marring their perfect faces. They're YING and
YANG, almost the same being.
The Prince eyes the doors closing behind him. The armed
guards watch his every move.
He bows his head and kneels.
PRINCE
Father.
(eyes the Princess)
SISTER-
The KING gestures for him to rise.
KING
Why have you done this??
His voice trembles with anger.
KING (CONT'D)
Why? !
The Prince looks at him, defiant.
PRINCE
I have returned from exile to set us
free. All of us, Father- And to reclaim
what has been taken from our people. The
land and the freedom that is rightfully
ours.
KING
No- You have broken a truce that has
lasted for centuries.
HELLBOY 2 21
PRINCE
A shameful truce, worth nothing. How can
you abide it? How- ? They have no respect
for themselves, their Gods or the earth-
(BEAT)
And they scorn us- every time they raise
a dead, cold building, destroy a forest,
or take more land-
The PRINCESS then steps forward.
PRINCESS
What they do is in their nature. We must
honor our side of the agreement-
PRINCE
Honor-?
(BEAT)
Look at this place. Is this where you
hold court??
(BEAT )
Is this how we are to live?? Amidst their
filth, in their rubble??? Picking at
scraps from their table??? Where is the
honor in that??
KING
And what would your solution be-? War?
Why?
(PAUSE)
It may just be that our days are ended...
PRINCE
It may be- but we will not go quiet. We
will not fade like this. Better to burn
than fade away... And for this...
Prince Nuada looks around, locking eyes with the heads of
the clans.
PRINCE
.we'll need the help of the Good... the
Bad... and the Worst-
He brings out the gold artifact from the auction. Holds it
high.
The crowds GASPS. The King instinctively covers the
companion piece hanging from his chest as a medallion.
KING
No- you cannot be that mad-
HELLBOY 2 22
PRINCE
Yes. I am.
KING
This is the path you wish to take?
Knowing the cost?
PRINCE
Yes, Father- it is.
The King takes the Princess' hand and mournfully lowers his
head.
KING
Then, I am sorry my son- you leave me no
choice.
(looks at his guards)
Death.
His two PRAETORIAN GUARDS unsheathe their swords.
PRINCE
(GRIM)
I agree. Death it is-
And the guards turn toward the king and stab him. The
Princess screams. The Prince looks away as the old monarch
tumbles from his throne, dead. The heads of the clans try to
flee, but are kept at bay by the other guards.
PRINCE
Hear me all!!! There are some amongst you
that have already seen the light-
(he nears the guards)
Seen the future...
The PRAETORIAN GUARDS cover his back as he leans forward to
his Father"s corpse and snatches the medallion.
PRINCE (CONT'D)
As for you- You may join us in our quest
or die now-
His gaze is fierce, inspired. He joins the pieces together,
they fuse and interconnect through the magical equivalent of
NANOTECHNOLOGY. Minute gears and hooks join the pieces
seamlessly into an almost complete CROWN. The Prince raises
IT-
PRINCE (CONT'D)
All of those in favor, make it known.
HELLBOY 2 23
All of the family heads sheepishly bow their heads, then
kneel.
PRINCE (CONT'D)
Good- I see the council is as brave as
it's always been...
(BEAT)
And now, my sister-
The Prince looks around and sees that his sister is gone.
He pushes through the mob, pulling his guards to the door.
PRINCE (CONT'D)
Find her- Find her-
His minions surge into the tunnels.
40 TNT. TUNNEL MAZE - NIGHT 40
Clutching the medallion on her chest , the Princess runs
down a tunnel. A CROWD gathers behind her, chasing her as
she zig-zags from tunnel to tunnel.
With perfect calm, she ducks into a niche, then slides down
a chute.
She lands in a stone chamber lined with bookshelves.
The Princess rushes to a small cabinet. She grabs an
ancient, leather-bound tome.
She turns to leave, but a horde of TROLLS rushes and quickly
surrounds her. One of the beasts swings a heavy, rusty
sword.
It opens a gash in the princess' left arm-
The Prince, rushing through the tunnel with the PRAETORIAN
GUARDS, suddenly doubles over, cursing. Blood pours from a
wound in his left arm.
PRINCE
No- no- you fools-
HELLBOY 2 24
As another troll lifts his sword high-
PRINCESS
(calling out)
Yrdrig!!
YRDRIG, a hellhound the size of a tank, jumps out from an
alcove. He has multiple heads, all of them ferocious. In
seconds, he's upon the TROLLS.
Each of his many mouths tears into green flesh, lifting and
shaking the helpless monsters like rag dolls.
The Princess slips through a secret door.
The Prince and his guards rush through the tunnels, as troll
screams echo off the walls.
When they finally-
-reach the Princess' chamber, it's too late.
Dead and dying TROLLS lie in a heap on the floor.
The Prince finds no sign of his sister. He clutches his
bleeding arm.
CUT TO:
Liz sprawls on a sofa, watching the 20-odd TV monitors in
Hellboy's room. All the news channels feature footage of
Heliboy's "outing" the night before.
HB is grinning at the camera. Now he's signing an autograph!
HELLBOY ON TV
Yes- yes- I'd say I am that strong- I've
fought many creatures over the years but
none as strong as me-
He winks at camera. Liz rolls her eyes.
HELLBOY 2 25
Hellboy plunks himself down next to her, popping a can of
beer.
HELLBOY
I think I did good. And I looked good,
don't you think, Liz?
Abe stands behind them, juggling a dozen remote controls.
ABE
Look- there's Manning...
He raises the volume as Manning is shown, surrounded by
microphones.
MANNING ON TV
Evidently we have a- gas pocket-
somewhere in-
HELLBOY
A gas pocket??!! Ha-! I love it.
The door opens. Manning is there, holding a plastic box
overflowing with mail.
MANNING
PLEASE-
Disgusted, Manning turns off the TV's.
MANNING
Aw- this is a disaster! A disaster- you
hear?? Worse than Cheney with a shotgun.
Only Liz-
(BEAT)
Only Liz handled herself with any
dignity.
LIZ
(glancing at HB)
No one asked me anything.
Manning pulls a fistful of mail out and tosses it on a
table.
MANNING
Don't bother starting a fan club. It's
trending five to one against us.
HELLBOY
Against?
HELLBOY 2 26
LIZ
(glances at some letters)
Polls- protests- hate mail-
Liz grabs a few letters and scans them.
LIZ
(READING)
"Unwelcome species... mongrelizing...
lower orders... ungodly freaks..."
She glares at Hellboy.
HELLBOY
Ungodly freaks-? Us?
MANNING
You really did it this time- I'm under
review.
(to Hellboy)
But so are you- As of today, there's a
new team leader.
HELLBOY
New - ? What?
MANNING
Yes- You heard me. A new team leader.
We're to meet him at the conference room
at 0900-
(looks at his watch)
Now.
The SECURITY POUND is row after row of stacked cages, each
one imprisoning a different CREATURE. BPRD AGENTS patrol the
pens, feeding the occupants, cleaning the pans-
HB looks at Manning, who is edgy and nervous.
HELLBOY
What's the matter, Manning?? Don't you
trust me anymore?
MANNING
Oh- I never did- But after last night,
Washington wants a new public face for
the BPRD-
HELLBOY 2 27
HELLBOY
What about me? What's wrong with my
face???
MANNING
Or mine??? The press loves me!! But now
you've ruined it all-
HELLBOY
But, who-? Who is this guy?
MANNING
How would I know? Evidently, he's quite
the big shot-
(he reads a file)
His name is Johann Kraus-
HELLBOY
Akkk- Kraus??? He's German-
MANNING
(OVERLAPPING)
-a physical medium, head of the European
branch of the BPRD-
HELLBOY
(OVERLAPPING)
You know I have a problem with Germans-
MANNING
(OVERLAPPING)
-a Doctor in Philosophy and Occult
Practice from the University of Munich
and a very eloquent speaker-
HELLBOY
(OVERLAPPING)
-Germans make me nervous-
MANNING
I guess they need a nice open face- A
face people can trust.
Finally, next to steel cage, they meet-
JOHANN KRAUS: about 6' tall, dressed in a canvas containment
suit full of tubes and taps. His hands are encased in thick
latex gloves with exit valves at the fingertips and his
head...
MANNING
. Oh, my God-
HELLBOY 2 28
.is a translucent glass bubble, full of gas!
He is studying a drawing of the royal seal we saw on the
Fairy Cages.
Johann approaches Liz. He takes her hand and bows.
JOHANN
Johann Kraus, at your service.
His unearthly voice is velvety and warm. Almost soothing.
Liz smiles. Hellboy glowers as Kraus' fishbowl head turns
toward them.
HELLBOY
(whispers to manning)
That's an open face for you...
Johann pulls out one of the dead, singed Fairies. Hellboy
and the others gather around him.
JOHANN
Poor things, bought and sold on the black
market. Smuggled in tight, cramped cages.
Let's see what they can remember-
HELLBOY
Memory gets pretty sketchy after you die-
(nudges Abe)
-but maybe I can be of help-
Nudges Abe and starts fishing for an amulet.
JOHANN
Oh, no, no- No amulets are required.
He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and
approaches the lock.
HELLBOY
What are you doing?
JOHANN
I can inhabit inanimate things: organic,
MECHANICAL-
HELLBOY
INHABIT-
HELLBOY 2 29
ABE
TELEPLASTY-
JOHANN
Exactly.
A PROTOPLASMIC emanation seeps out from his fingertips,
slightly deflating his body. The tendrils enter the-
-"Dead" Fairy.
JOHANN
I can briefly take control of entities,
both mechanical and organic and
reactivate their neural system-
The "dead" Fairy snarls and bares its teeth at Hellboy. Two
more do the same from another pen.
JOHANN (CONT'D)
(points at Hellboy)
You scare him-
The fairy blabbers furiously while glaring at HB.
HELLBOY
(leering at it)
Whaddayawant??? You chewed off the tip of
my tail- Yes, you-
JOHANN (CONT'D)
Rough translation: He says you are rude,
brutish and not too bright-
ABE
Touche.
More high-pitched jabbering...
Johann replaces the little fairy in the holding pen.
JOHANN (CONT'D)
Enough. it seems our little friend here
remembers a noise. A very peculiar noise
in the last place where his cage was
traded: market sounds-
(BEAT)
Troll language-
LIZ
The troll market- ?
HELLBOY 2 30
JOHANN
Exactly, Miss Sherman.
The Fairy starts babbling uncontrollably and grows pale and
weak.
HELLBOY
Jeez- your buddy there doesn't look too
good.
JOHANN
I'm losing my grip on its limbic system-
He feels nauseous. I'm afraid he's about
to die-
HELLBOY
Wow- You have that effect on me too.
The Fairy's cheekbones hollow and it finally collapses.
Ectoplasm escapes its body and regroups at Johan's
fingertips.
ABE
How can we find the Troll market??? Its
location has been a source of speculation
for centuries
JOHANN
Yes, well- Trolls dwell under bridges-
And Vladimir Vanya 18th century occultist-
places it under Washington Bridge
ABE
We've looked there before-- Staked it out
for weeks-
JOHANN
Yes, but this time I have asked for a
very special piece of equipment-
He moves in to a large crate marked "Lot 336"
ABE
"336" The schufftein glasses??
JOHANN
(smiles knowingly)
On loan from the Smithsonian. Plus we
have this clue-
He produces the sketch of the ROYAL SEAL.
HELLBOY 2 31
JOHANN
In my mind we have enough to go by- Any
questions??
Abe is about to ask something when, abruptly, Hellboy raises
his hand-
JOHANN
Yes- what is it?
HELLBOY
If you're really German- how come you
don't have a funny accent?
JOHANN
(SIGHS)
Get ready. We are on the move.
49
Hellboy is suiting up. Liz and Abe do the same.
HELLBOY
What a moron!! "We are on the move" He
thinks he's so hot!! We've been looking
for that place for years and we've never
found it-
(looks at Abe)
You said so-
Abe pulls out TWO headsets of COMPOSITE GOGGLES, made of
copper and glass, full of buzzing and whirring pieces. He
tries it on.
LIZ
Get used to it. He might be here for good-
HELLBOY
For good?!
LIZ
He has a nice voice.
ABE
Yes, very commanding, very soothing.
HELLBOY
I think he's a jerk.
ABE
I like him.
HELLBOY 2 32
HELLBOY
Well, then you're a jerk, too. "The
brains of the operation-" give me a
break!
JOHANN
They head towards the garbage truck. Manning, Abe and
are waiting there.
LIZ
I think you feel threatened...
Hellboy stays behind- thinking- thinking real hard.
CUT TO:
Hellboy rides in silence- still thinking hard- then.
HELLBOY
Ha! Me? Threatened??
Glaring, at Liz:
HELLBOY
By whom? By him??
LIZ
Not just him- this whole thing you did.
The TV- the reporters-
HELLBOY
I did that?
LIZ
Yes, Red- absolutely. 'Cause you did it
without thinking- You just wanted to be
in the public's eye- well- you're there-
but so are we.
HELLBOY
Hey- We got some hate mail.
(SHRUGS)
We'll deal with it. Together.
HELLBOY 2 33
He comes closer to her.
HELLBOY
Something else bothering you-?
Liz nods quietly.
HELLBOY
So- Tell me about it-
LIZ
I will, but not now- I'm sorry if- I-
(BEAT)
I don't like being watched. I never have.
I feel like a freak only if someone's
watching me.
Suddenly: Angry YELLS... then fists pounding the walls and
fenders.
The doors open and they are inundated by reporters and TV
CREWS and cameras and flashes. There are, literally,
hundreds of them. This time from all over the world: Japan,
UK, Germany...
CUT TO:
MANNING
Oh, dear Lord.
(PAUSE)
What about the cats?
LIZ
She eats them.
MANNING
"She??" That's a "she"?????
HELLBOY
We're moving in, Sparky-
61 BOWLING ALLEY / BACK ALLEY/ UNDER THE BRIDGE 61
HE, Johann and Abe follow the Bag Lady. She opens a service
DOOR-
/ SERVICE CORRIDOR. 62
The bag lady goes through the rear of the bowling alley and
through a basement door. The room RUMBLES with the sound of
rolling balls and toppling pins.
HELLBOY
(WHISPERS)
Maybe we can bowl a few frames, uh?
ABE
(splays his webbed fingers)
Bowling balls- they give me trouble.
HELLBOY
How about a beer, then? Now that we're
"out"- Whaddya say, Mein Herr?
HELLBOY 2 39
JOHANN
Sorry. I don't drink.
HELLBOY
SHEESH-
Hellboy and Abe enter the basement: no sign of the old
woman. Just a Warehouse-
JOHANN'
Adjust the prisms to "2"
Abe moves his glasses, Hellboy fumbles his own-
unsuccessfully.
Now the WHOLE ROOM transforms under the new optical
elements: Its geometry remains somewhat unchanged, but
instead of a pile of boxes a tree trunk and a large, mossy
rock are visible, where there were iron beams now tree
trunks and stone columns are visible...
ABE
THERE-
Where a large banner hung, now a huge, rusty mechanical
lock.
HELLBOY
What the heck is that?
ABE
A locking mechanism-
HELLBOY
Mmh- I'll take care of it-
He clenches his stone fist, rears back...
JOHANN
No- You destroy it. We'll never get in-
He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and
approaches the lock.
HELLBOY
Ah, of course- the Fishbowl touch-
JOHANN
Johann's s ecto-tendrils enter the-
HELLBOY 2 4 0
64
64 MECHANISM OF THE LOCK
-filling it, making a few complex gears turn and move-
65
65 THE LOCK
Opens and the floor drops away, revealing a stone staircase.
Johann withdraws his protoplasmic tendrils and closes off
the valves.
JOHANN
Gentlemen: welcome to Troll Market.
Troll Market is a steamy, medieval nightmare. A labyrinth of
narrow alleys and foetid vapour.
Trolls scavenge the crumbling, marble shoreline, picking
through garbage, scattering vermin.
Muddy water trickles down from above, forming cloudy
puddles.
Roaming vendors hawk exotic objects from every culture and
century.
At kiosks and shops, Trolls peddle cats (skinned or alive)
cadres of Lovecraftian entities stroll about: Mer-men,
Goblins and a few select species unknown to any cosmology.
A dogfight of sorts is taking place in a small ring. Instead
of pitbulls, multi-limbed creatures leap at one another
while violent bettors laugh and shout.
At the rail, Abe watches in horror, then sees a woman in
rags making her way through the crowd. He catches a glimpse
of her slippered feet...
.which flash with pearls and gold embroidery. His
curiosity aroused, he follows her.
67
67 MARKET STALL
The woman inspects a pile of ancient bric-a-brac at a market
stall; her cowl swings aside, briefly revealing her face.
It's the PRINCESS. In these grotesque surroundings, her
beauty is transcendent.
HELLBOY 2 41
Abe is thunderstruck.
As she turns to leave, they briefly make eye contact. On her
bandaged arm: a bracelet adorned with the seal's coat of
arms!
ABE
(into microphone)
Brother Red!!
HELLBOY
(INTERCOM)
Not now, Abe.
As the Princess disappears into the mob, Abe hurries after
her.
68
The Princess has entered a shop selling MAPS and PRINTS. Abe
stays outside, watching through a window as she negotiates
to purchase a silver and crystal CYLINDER contained in a
safety holding case.
The SALESMAN denies it at first but after the Princess hands
him a gold bracelet he finally acquiesces while vowing to
her. He extracts the cylinder from its holding case and
hands it to her.
A red locator light flashes on Abe's utility belt.
HELLBOY
(INTERCOM)
Hey, Abe, gimme me your twenty-
ABE
I'm following a lead, Red. Keep your
locator -.
A large TROLL cuts him off-
ABE
Excuse me- What do you think you're
doing?
HELLBOY
(INTERCOM)
Are you in trouble? Talk to me, Abe.
Another TROLL comes up behind Abe.
ABE (CONT'D)
I don't think you-
The TROLL opens a small wooden box and extracts a nasty
looking Insect: A NARCOTIC BUG.
ABE (CONT'D)
Oh, my-
The second TROLL loads the buzzing bug - like a bullet -
into a blowpipe. Abe turns just as he blows. The bug lands
on Abe's chest and sinks its stinger deep into his flesh. He
groans.
HELLBOY
Abe? What's wrong?
HELLBOY 2 44
Abe tears it loose and crushes it underfoot. But his vision
blurs, he staggers forward and falls, face first, onto the
cobblestones.
HELLBOY
(INTERCOM)
Abe? Come in - Abe? Dammit -
Abe opens his eyes and slowly gets up. He looks around: he's
surrounded by racks of ancient scrolls and musty books. The
door is locked. Instinctively he looks for his belt-
It's not there.
PRINCESS
If you are looking for your weapons, my
guards took them.
Abe turns to face the Princess, who stands only a few feet
away. She has cast off her dingy cloak and is radiant in
fine silk robes.
She is feeding slices of fruit to a cage of large,
featherless REPTILE/BIRDS.
ABE
I - I carry no weapons, madam- I assure
you...
PRINCESS
Why were you following me?
Abe is ashamed to realize the real answer. He's utterly
beguiled by her.
PRINCESS (CONT'D)
Are you seeking to join my brother?
ABE
Your brother-??
HELLBOY 2 45
PRINCESS
In his revolt against the humans?
ABE
A revolt? No, no, no, I- You are sorely
mistaken...
He takes a step forward but the YRDRIG comes out of nowhere,
barking and growling.
PRINCESS
Then answer me truthfully- Why were you
following me?
ABE
My name is Abe Sapien -
PRINCESS
(LAUGHING)
There is no such name!
ABE
Horrible- I know- but- Please, hear me, I
beg you. I am an agent of the Bureau for
Paranormal Research and Defense. If we
can assist you-
PRINCESS
Give me your hand.
Abe complies, thrilled as she runs her fingers over his
palm.
The Princess' face brightens. She smiles and gestures for
the YRDRIG to yield.
PRINCESS
Down Yrdrig - he's a friend.
The YRDRIG jumps on Abe and starts licking him with all
three tongues.
PRINCESS (CONT'D)
Yrdrig's really just a puppy.
The drooling beast pins Abe to the floor with one paw.
ABE
(WHEEZING)
Nice puppy...
A
The YRDRIG lifts Abe with one of its mouths and gives him
playful shake.
HELLBOY 2 46
PRINCESS
My father gave him to me. Yrdrig, leave
our guest alone-
The Yrdrig drops Abe onto the floor.
PRINCESS (CONT'D)
Out! Out! Bad Yrdrig!
As the animal skulks away, she helps Abe up-
PRINCESS (CONT'D)
(bows her head)
My name is Princess Nuala.
ABE
(bows his head)
Your highness, the honor is all mine.
PRINCESS
May I apologize, Mr. Sapien, for the
manner in which we brought you here...
couldn't be too sure.
She offers him the locator belt.
ABE
Please, it was nothing. Love the puppy,
TOO-
PRINCESS
And under diplomatic immunity - may I
seek asylum??
ABE
We would be... honored, I'm sure. But,
may I ask: from whom do you seek asylum?
Suddenly, a COMMOTION outside. The door flies off its
hinges. Hellboy and Johann burst in, leaping over a pile
fallen guards outside.
ABE
Red, no! I'm all right!
The Princess shrinks back, but Abe motions for calm.
ABE
Gentlemen! Some respect, please!
The Princess looks with dismay at her vanquished bodyguards.
The NARCOTIC BUGS buzz around HB, who swats them like
mosquitoes.
HELLBOY 2 47
PRINCESS
And that was my royal guard.
ABE
Red, apologize at once! We are in the
presence of... royalty!
Hellboy's never heard Abe sound like this- giddy as a
schoolboy.
JOHANN
(to Abe)
You're vouching for her, I take it. Mr
Sapien?
ABE
Oh, most definitely. She's from an
ancient, noble line -
JOHANN
- of warriors. The Children of the Earth.
(to the Princess)
I'm sorry, Princess Nuala. With such a
fierce bloodline, we cannot take your
claim of allegiance at face value.
He produces the ANCIENT SEAL.
Standing at a long deal table, the Princess lights a candle
and examines the ancient seal.
PRINCESS
Where did you get this?
HELLBOY
Human side, two nights ago-
The Princess studies their faces.
PRINCESS
In ancient times a seal like this was
delivered to the enemy as a declaration
of war. A signal from the underground
realm to the entire world. It prefaced
the awakening of the Golden Army-
Johann sits down heavily.
JOHANN
I feared as much.
HELLBOY 2 48
HELLBOY
(to Johann)
What-? What-? A goblin army-?
Johann shakes his glass head, overcome with worry.
JOHANN
Golden Army. The unstoppable tide. There
has been nothing to substantiate such a
TALE-
PRINCESS
Not a tale- At the dawn of time... Even
before the great flood, man and the
Children of the Earth shared this
planet...
(she sighs)
But as man in his greed expanded his
dominion, there ensued a bitter war...
DISSOLVE:
Seated in an 'opulent throne room, KING BALOR addresses a
wretched guild of deformed goblins.
HELLBOY 2 49
PRINCESS (V.0.)
It was then that the King ordered the
Sigri to build him a new, invincible
army.
Lit by the fires of a hundred furnaces, stoked by scores of
goblins, a MECHANICAL ARMY is born. Metal plates and moving
parts are hammered into shape on enormous anvils and bolted
onto tall, ornate, golden figures.
PRINCESS (V.0.)
This was an army that would not eat,
drink or grow tired. A heartless,
ruthless force made of the purest metal,
mined from the depths of the earth.
In perfect ranks, in eerie unison, the golden soldiers line
up, filling the entire courtyard, awaiting the King's
command.
PRINCESS (V.0.)
The Sigri worked until the winter moon
was high in the sky -
The CHIEF GOBLIN BLACKSMITH displays three curved segments
of gold. He fits them together and holds a completed CROWN
directly over the King's head.
KING
I am King Balor, leader of the Golden
Army. Is there anyone here who disputes
my right???
Silence. Prince NUADA kneels next to his father. The Goblin
crowns the King, who lifts his sword. In response-
TCHANKKKKK!!!! The new army raises its lances, hailing him.
The goblins lock the golden army into a huge cavern, under
the light of ten thousand flickering torches.
HELLBOY 2 51
PRINCESS (V.0.)
And the golden army was ordered to lie
dormant, locked inside the earth itself -
and there it is to this day, waiting for
the wearer of the crown to command it
again.
The Princess finishes her tale. Hellboy and Johann look at
each other.
HELLBOY
Where is that crown??
PRINCESS
My father had it destroyed. Cut into
three pieces. One for mankind...
She holds up her piece of the puzzle, which dangles from a
chain around her neck.
PRINCESS
.Two for the sons of the Earth.
ABE
So, you do need our help..?
PRINCESS
I'm afraid it's the other way around.
She holds the CYLINDER she purchased.
PRINCESS
The location of the Golden Army is
contained within this cylinder--
She opens it and produces a parchment hidden inside. She
extends it: the map just shows three coordinates.
ABE
Just a global chart, Edo - that's the old
name for Tokyo - Moscow, and Renvyle here-
PRINCESS
But nothing else-
She rolls back the map into the cylinder.
PRINCESS
So far, this is a family matter. To
intervene will bring nothing but trouble.
HELLBOY 2 52
HELLBOY
Good, I like trouble.
The Princess leads the group through the surging, noisy
crowd of bizarre creatures. Hellboy, Johann and Abe bring up
the rear.
PRINCESS
No- not that way. Too risky-
They're lost in unfamiliar alleys and byways. Until-
JOHANN
(finally, pointing)
There. Stairs to the street...
BUT-
PRINCE
Hold!
The Prince appears at the top of the stairs, dressed in
black. He's surrounded by his elite guard. Stepping to the
rail, he points at his sister and addresses the crowd:
PRINCE
Hear me, o creatures of the forest! Can
you recognize a traitor? She's here to
betray her own!
He casts a disdainful look at Hellboy.
PRINCE
I'm here to recruit all of you against
the humans. Make your decision now. Those
who join me will be rewarded. The rest...
will be killed.
A sudden silence falls over the throng. Then, the sound of
CRACKING KNUCKLES. Everyone looks at Hellboy, who is
unclenching his fists and stretching his neck.
He starts up the stairs, but a couple of the GUARDS leap
down to block his path.
HELLBOY
I'm gonna put this as delicately as I
can.
CUT TO:
HELLBOY 2 53
84
A crowded BOWLING ALLEY is full of serious-looking players
in colorful shirts and shoes.
Someone rolls a ball down the center lane, and as it speeds
right at the pins...
BOWLER
Look out, Manny! Strike city..!
CRASH! Hellboy erupts from under the floorboards, fighting
the clawing monsters right behind him!
As the bowlers freeze in shock, dozens of creatures pour out
into the human world. Grunting, Hellboy punches his way
free, only to be dragged back by the tail by WINK.
Abe, shielding the Princess, demonstrates the way of the
water, a fluid martial arts display. He ducks and parries
the blows, leaping like Nureyev.
Abe scoops up a couple of bowling balls and rolls them at
the Prince's guards. He manages to knock a couple off their
feet.
As they get back up, he uses the available bowling pins as
clubs. The screaming PATRONS rush for the doors.
85
Hellboy runs like a cockroach through a dilapidated KITCHEN.
Behind him, the Elemental's massive BRANCH/FIST crashes
through the wall, then pursues him as he runs down a
corridor littered with debris.
Like a wrecking ball, the Elemental demolishes each section
of the corridor as Hellboy runs.
Liz drives the garbage truck toward the Brooklyn Bridge.
Johann is sitting next to her.
BLAM! BLAM! Deafening shots as Hellboy blasts the Samaritan
again and again at a target in the dark firing range. Hits a
button, brings the paper close for inspection.
Result: a very ragged, loose pattern around the bull's eye.
Suddenly, from the next alley, RAPID GUNFIRE. Johann leans
over, and to address Hellboy through a cloud of gunsmoke.
JOHANN
You'll permit a small criticism? You take
too much time to aim, to think. Nein.
Just point- like afinger- as if you wish
for something.
HELLBOY
Oh, I wish for something.
Johann brings his target close: a beautiful, tight cluster
of shots, dead center.
JOHANN
Speed is of the essence. You must work on
it. I'm willing to spend some -
Johann reaches for his loader, accidentally knocks Heliboy's
onto the floor.
HELLBOY
Hey, watch it! You're winding me up, I
don't like it.
HELLBOY 2 64
JOHANN
On the contrary.
Hellboy's in the shower, glaring across the room, where
Johann stands at a mirror, polishing his glass head with a
terry cloth towel.
HELLBOY
You keep wiping that thing like she's
gonna care.
JOHANN
She- Who-??
HELLBOY
You know who- She-
(BEAT)
She's not gonna care.
JOHANN
(long beat)
You think I'm after Liz, don't you?
(Hellboy walks out)
Well, I'm not.
HELLBOY
Why not?
(BEAT)
Not good enough for you?
Hellboy wraps a towel around his waist and comes up behind
Johann.
HELLBOY
Well- From now on, you don't come near
her. You don't talk to her-
JOHANN
You forget. I'm part of the team now,
such interactions are inev-
HELLBOY
Well- you better start making them
"evitable"-
JOHANN
That's not a word-
HELLBOY
Yes, it is-
HELLBOY 2 65
JOHANN
No, it isn't-
Hellboy raises his stone fist.
HELLBOY
Now it is-
JOHANN
Oh, I see- you want to punch me- That's
how you win an argument.
HELLBOY
I try.
JOHANN
Well, you're big, I'll give you that much-
HELLBOY
"Give me???"- You don't give me sh-
JOHANN
-and you're strong- but you're slow.
HELLBOY
Slo-??
JOHANN
Very- slow- I've seen your fighting
style. Very slow-
WHAM-! Hellboy cracks Johann over the head with his massive
fist. To his surprise, the Johann's glass ball cranium
shatters!
HELLBOY
Slow enough for ya-??
With a loud HISSS, Johann's odd suit sags to the floor!
HELLBOY
Ow- Johann... buddy. Sorry- I- I- got
carried away...
(leaning over the empty suit)
Johann? You still hear me?
An ectoplasmic TENDRIL reaches out from the suit and
penetrates the closest locker.
HELLBOY
It was an accident, okay? I'll get you
some help-
HELLBOY 2 66
With a CLANG! -- the bank of lockers comes to life! Metal
doors smack Hellboy's head repeatedly, like a pinball
machine! his face imprinted in the metal.
JOHANN
See? Speed is the key.
The vaporous form of Johann's body emerges from the lockers
and wanders away. The locker room doors open and close as he
goes by.
Hellboy tries to stand, wobbles and sits.
HELLBOY
Chicken shit!
CUT TO:
- NIGHT 101
Abe floats in his tank, smiling at the Princess, who's at
one of the book stands, reading to him.
PRINCESS
"I sometimes have a queer feeling -
especially when you are near me, as
now: it is as if I had a string somewhere
under my left ribs, tightly and
inextricably knotted to a similar string
situated in the corresponding quarter of
your little frame."
ABE
I love this part. Keep going.
PRINCESS
"I am afraid that cord of communion will
be snapt; and then I've a nervous notion
I should take to bleeding inwardly."
She closes the book, looking troubled.
ABE
Charlotte Bronte died shortly before I
was born. It would have been a great
privilege to have known her...
PRINCESS
This "Jane Eyre"... I understand it's
only a story, but such a tie that binds,
it exists between me and my brother. I
assure you: my brother, he's not dead-
HELLBOY 2 67
ABE
How can you know? We all saw-
PRINCESS
We are twins. Even now, I can sense his
presence. This has been our way since we
were young children, in Renvyle-
ABE
Renvyle, Ireland- The ancient isles-
PRINCESS
(NODS)
A magical place in the West. A different
time. Long gone. Now, he's near and he's
looking for me. I can feel and even
understand his. hatred for mankind.
ABE
Men... usually mean well, I believe that.
But they need our help and patience.
PRINCESS
You were very brave, vouching for me. How
do you know I'm not the enemy, bringing
me here?
ABE
It's as you were saying, I suppose. From
intuition, feeling. I've never met anyone
like you... but that's my instinct.
They gaze fondly at each other through the glass, as bubbles
swirl out of Abe's gills.
CUT TO:
102
Liz is patching Hellboy's injured head. In the background
the TV's are playing up: CITY LIGHTS, WHITE HEAT and some TV
programming.
HELLBOY
He caught me off-guard- but I'll get him
next time.
He's examining a few letters, contract forms, etc.
LIZ
There shouldn't be a "next time" we're
all part of the same team.
HELLBOY 2 68
HELLBOY
We are- he's not- The guy's an egomaniac.
You can see right through him.
(PAUSE)
That's a joke, Liz.
Liz remains silent.
HELLBOY
(raises a letter)
Look!! They wanna do a cartoon series,
based on me? And this:
(he holds up a box of cereal)
Product endorsement - breakfast of
demons. And a videogame!!!
As CITY LIGHTS ends, Liz lifts the remote to turn the volume
up.
LIZ
Gosh, that was so sweet, so sad- It
always gets me- Red- There's something I
need to-
HELLBOY
(taking the remote)
No, wait.
(switching to Leno)
Look that's us-
Jay is showing some footage from the giant incident.
LENO
So- this "Hellboy" what is he?? Is he
really on our side?? I mean, he's red,
has a tail and shaves his horns- horns,
Ladies and Gentleman. Horns are never a
good sign.
HELLBOY
(CHUCKLES)
Ha- He's funny.
LENO
Maybe we should have him come over and
talk to us a little, uh? Whaddayathink??
The crowd roars.
HELLBOY
That's a great idea, don't you think??
HELLBOY 2 69
LIZ
No, I don't-
HELLBOY
Did you know that during the commercial
breaks the orchestra keeps playing so the
guest can't talk to Jay... keeps the
conversation fresh.
LIZ
How do you know these things?
HELLBOY
I read it in TV Guide.
LIZ
You're really liking this, aren't you?
HELLBOY
We should do this-
LIZ
It's a bad idea. All of it- Do you really
need everybody to like you?? What's in it
for you?? Are we not enough???
She leaves. Hellboy glances at Leno on TV: a dog outfitted
in a ballerina costume is jumping around with a red ball
balanced on its nose. Hellboy chuckles.
HELLBOY
That's funny.
CUT TO:
BPRD agents break in on the scene. Smoke and flames billow
in the room, wax puddles stand where the CEREMONIAL CANDLES
were and seated around the seance table, charred corpses
hold hands in eternal contact. As the Agents move around a
pale, vaporous shape emerges from the soot-stained darkness:
It's Johann.
JOHANN'S VOICE
All the seance attendees were
incinerated. The only survivor -and only
to some extent- was me- Why? I'll never
KNOW--
The form moves towards its body and attempts to climb back
and reanimate it, but the CHARRED CORPSE is barely amble to
amble a few steps forward before collapsing into ash and
bone... The shape of Ectoplasm stands there, alone and lost-
Then, Professor TREVOR BROOM wanders into the scene and
approaches the form-
JOHANN'S VOICE
It was then that Professor Broom and the
B.P.R.D. devised a containment suit for
me. A new body-
HELLBOY 2 72
CAMERA pulls back to reveal-
107 BALCONY BPRD - NIGHT 107
Johann, back in the balcony, talking to Liz.
JOHANN
I owe Professor Broom everything that
I've become. He brought me back to life-
He grows silent for a brief moment.
JOHANN
But I've never been able to see her
again. My reach became limited- My loss,
infinite...
Liz puts her hand on his shoulder. Johann takes it...
JOHANN
Loss- the very threat of it makes us
vulnerable... makes us care- You can see
that, don't you?? Without her I became
but an empty shell...
Liz leans her head on his shoulder.
JOHANN
Don't give up on him. Not yet.
Liz chuckles.
LIZ
No. Not yet.
CAMERA discovers HELLBOY, watching them from behind a glass
door, a six-pack in his hand. He steps away.
Heliboy walks down a deserted corridor carrying his six
pack.
He stops, puzzled. Strains of Barry Manilow are emanating
from the library.
Hellboy enters the library and goes over to the tank. Abe is
there, listening to Vivaldi.
HELLBOY 2 73
ABE
Ah, hello Red. You're up late.
HELLBOY
Liz and I- we had a fight-
ABE
OH-
Hellboy eyes the CD player.
HELLBOY
Did I hear Barry Manilow just now?
ABE
(smiles hypocritical)
Barry M- oh, Gosh- no- no-
(fast, stammering)
It was er- urm- Vivaldi. Il cimento
dell'armonia I believe I particularly
admire the passage...
Hellboy hits the eject button on Abe's CD player. The music
stops and he pulls out a different CD from the changer.
HELLBOY
What's happening to you??
ABE
Ooh- Ooh-
(SIGHS)
All my life I thought I was alone, a made-
up name and a random pasted on a
cylinder. But then I saw her- She's like
me. A creature from another world...
Alone... Brother Red- I think I'm in
love.
HELLBOY
You say that like it's a good thing.
(looks at the CD)
What track?
ABE
(ASHAMED)
Track eight-
HELLBOY
(READS)
Oh, God- you're disgusting-
ABE
I know-
HELLBOY 2 74
HELLBOY
"Can't smile without you"
ABE
I'd cry, but I don't have the glands for
it..
(DESPERATE)
What am I going to do, Red????
Hellboy sighs and pops a beer, presses play and sighs
heavily, looks around-
ABE
I miss him- Father- don't you??
HELLBOY
(NODS)
Everyday.
ABE
He would tell what to do- He would tell
what's right- what's wrong-
HELLBOY
He did that for all of us...
The opening strings of "Can't Smile Without You."
ABE
(sips beer)
You know? I- I never much appreciated
Manilow's artistry that much- until now-
Now it seems to be a grand poet and
speaks directly to my innermost feelings.
HELLBOY
Jeez- You need to get out more-
The two of them sit there, growing quiet, listening to the
syrupy music. Then, slowly, the two of them start singing:
low at first and then at the top of their voices, moved and
teary-eyed.
110
The Princess hears the distant music and smiles, but then
feels a chill down her spine. She shudders and moves to the
panoramic window and gazes outside, to the woods and the
distant city lights below...
HELLBOY 2 75
Manning strides down the corridor, followed by the BPRD
team. All of them dressed in BLACK LEATHER OUTFITS.
MANNING
This is a whole new ballgame and I want
you to take my lead.
ABE
I find these leather outfits very
UNCOMFORTABLE-
MANNING
Maybe so, maybe so- but they look- hip.
(BEAT)
When it comes to dealing with reporters
or the public, I set the tone. You all
know the old saying: the perception is
the reality.
HELLBOY
Correctamundo, chief. For one thing, we
can ditch the garbage truck, right?
ABE
Wait, Red, the lab's in it-
HELLBOY
Screw the lab. I want new wheels.
MANNING
(SMIRKING)
You got 'em-
The round a corner and enter -
Three gleaming Hummers await them.
HELLBOY 2 76
MANNING
A gift from General Motors. One for each
of you.
Each Hummer has custom paint: Hellboy's with scenes of
Dante's inferno, Liz's with flames and Abe's with an
underwater vista.
HELLBOY
This is more like it!
LIZ
I'm not driving that-
Abe has opened the hood on his Hummer.
ABE
This is a most unfortunate vehicle. The
sheer waste of precious fossil fuels...
MANNING
An American custom, it's called product
placement! What's the harm?
CUT TO:
-- DAY 114
A row of makeup chairs. Manning sits in the first one,
looking at himself in the mirror.
MANNING
Can you do anything about this... uh...
(lowers his voice)
-double chin?
MAKEUP GIRL
No, you're not being made up.
MANNING
Why not?
MAKEUP GIRL
They said, you're too normal. You don't
need anything.
MANNING
But- Believe me- I'm not normal at
all...
2
CAMERA MOVES to the next makeup chair, where Makeup Girl
holds a camelhair brush and stares dubiously at Abe.
MAKEUP GIRL 2
So, what color is that- green?
ABE
Carribbean Blue, actually.
CAMERA MOVES to the next makeup chair, where the very sexy
Makeup Girl 3 gingerly touches Hellboy's chest.
MAKEUP GIRL 3
Are these really scars?
HELLBOY
Well, yeah. Each one tells a story-
His grin fades as he sees Johann talking to Liz. He abruptly
gets up and goes to them.
HELLBOY 2 78
HELLBOY
That about you, glass-man? A few squirts
of Windex?
JOHANN
I'm not going on. And if I may- a word of
ADVICE-
(long beat, then sotto voce)
-it's not a good idea to hint that you
two have... a relationship.
HELLBOY
Thanks a bunch. I'll decide that.
JOHANN
You don't know how people may react.
HELLBOY
It's a love story. They'll lap it up.
JOHANN
I know you don't like me, but trust me on
this one.
(BEAT)
I knew your father- he was a friend-
Hellboy blinks, taking the information in.
JOHANN
Do as you may- But know this- he wouldn't
have approved of your behaviour.
A P.A. opens the door.
P.A.
You're on-!
JOHANN
I'll be watching from the truck lab,
where I belong- Go, enjoy your fifteen
minutes...
He walks away.
CUT TO:
116
SIGN: PATROVICK STATION, MOSCOW, 22.00 HOURS.
A busy Moscow Subway station, not very crowded at this time
of night. Sleepy patrons await the arrival of the subway.
HELLBOY 2 79
One of them, a puppet vendor, showcases his product. He
manipulates a wooden marionette: A KNIGHT in SHINING ARMOR.
In the distance- lights, bright lights and the train ROAR!!!
The Puppeteer readies his merchandise bag and quickly moves
to the edge of the platform alongside other passengers. The
lights grow in intensity and the ROAR becomes deafening. But
something's wrong, really, wrong-
PUPPETEER
Hooy na ny!
The lights are in reality, the eyes of a giant dragon and it
roars into the platfrom, demolishing pillars, crushing
people and eating the puppeteer in a matter of second.
Pandemonium ensues.
117
A warning light goes off on the Truck's GLOBAL POSITIONING
MAP: "MOSCOW"
But Johann and the other agents are too absorbed watching
the Leno show on the bank of monitors.
LENO
Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday we saw
some extraordinary things on TV. And
tonight you're in for more.
CUT TO:
118
118 TV SHOW
Jay Leno grins and pulls his microphone close.
LENO
Please extend a warm, warm welcome to
Hellboy, Liz Sherman, Abe Sapien, and
Special Agent Tom Manning.
Uproarious applause as the BPRD team comes out and make
their way to the couch.
119
Alone in the BPRD conference room, the Princess is watching
the show. The massive Yrdrig is curled up at her feet.
BELLBOY 2 80
LEND
Wow, So -
He's pointing at Manning.
LENO
.what planet are you from?
MANNING
Washington, D.C., Jay. It's hot and
inhospitable to human life.
LEND
Funny.
(to Liz)
Why are you just "Liz" and not Fire Girl?
LIZ
I was born in Milwaukee, so it was just
plain old Liz ever since first grade.
HELLBOY
Hey, we do call her Sparky now and then.
A chuckle from the crowd. Hellboy smiles in satisfaction.
LEND
(to Abe)
And you, Abe. Is it uncomfortable at
night with that toilet seat around your
neck?
The Princess smiles as the camera singles out Abe for a
closeup.
ABE
Actually, Mr. Leno, my lungs are more
like gills. I need to convert the air's
nitrogen into oxygen, otherwise I'd
suffocate in five minutes.
LEND
(NODDING)
Gotcha. We call that stand-up comedy.
Johann is groaning. This is turning unpleasant. Behind him,
the map's lights are lightning up non-stop.
HELLBOY 2 81
LENO (CONT'D)
So, Hellboy: what's your favorite food?
Devil's food cake? Do you have a last
name?
More laughter at HB. Liz mortified. She touches HB's hand to
restrain him. Cameras zoom in on this.
LENO
Whoa. What's that- Are you two an item?
HELLBOY
Uh... I-
LENO
(to Liz)
Care to comment on that? Sounds like
you're contemplating marriage!
LIZ
(after a big pause)
You know, Jay, we are- together. We are.
Rumble of consternation from the audience.
JOHANN
Uh oh. Manning, I think your polls just
tanked.
He turns to see the map- lit like a christmas tree.
JOHANN
Mein Gott-
121
121 TV SHOW
Leno smiles at the audience, which is buzzing.
LENO
Folks, this is modern America. A guy in
Rhode Island married his motorcycle!
What's a little inter-species romance in
this day and age?
LIZ:
Scattered BOOING from the back row. Jay turns back to
LENO
Okay, here's what we've really been
wondering: Is he just like every guy? In
every respect? I mean, he looks like a
guy...
(MORE)
HELLBOY 2 82
LENO(continued)
and if so, are you using any protection?
A layer of asbestos might be in order,
don't you think?
Liz tenses up in silence. Holds tight to HB's hand.
Hellboy is ready to explode.
LIZ
As a matter of fact, Jay-
Before she can finish, the production assistant runs out and
hands a NOTE to Leno, who scans it and grows serious:
LENO
We we're getting pre-empted, ladies and
gentlemen. Please, bare with us. We'll be
right back-
CAMERA PUSHES IN on one of the MONITORS:
Video cameras record the journey of the Princess as she
makes her way through the nearly-deserted corridors.
126 TNT. LIBRARY -- CONTINUOUS 126
A VIDEO surveillance camera in the BPRD library records the
Princess as she crosses to Abe's tank.
BELLBOY 2 84
She hides the gold segment within the pages of "Jane Eyre."
At that moment, the Yrdrig GROWLS -
PRINCESS
Shhh, it's all right -
BOOM-! A jolt shakes the room. A-moment later, a wall
collapses as warty, heavily muscled ARMS and FINGERS tear at
the masonry!
in seconds, a squad of TROLLS pulls itself into view! WINK
leers at the Princess. From her waistband, she produces a
long, thin DAGGER and wields it timidly.
Somewhere in the building, ALARMS start clanging.
The Yrdrig shakes himself into action and springs.
With a SNARL, it attaches its several jaws onto the nearest
trolls. As the fighting creatures crash into the spiral
staircase, the Princess hears a familiar voice:
PRINCE
Hold.
The Prince steps into the room, carrying a long spear.
The trolls are on top of the Yrdrig, ready to kill him.
PRINCE
Come-!
The trolls release the Yrdrig and bound over to the Prince.
The last troll, however, grabs the Yrdrig by the neck and
brutally twists -!
The animal's three mouths yelp and cough, fighting for air.
- the
It thrashes pathetically until, suddenly, it's over
beast is dead.
PRINCESS
No!
PRINCE
Where is your sense of shame? You mingle
with... the liars?
ALARMS are ringing as the Hummers pull into the underground
parking garage. Manning and Hellboy jump out of their
vehicle and see -
HELLBOY 2 85
- a couple of dead AGENTS sprawled on the loading dock.
MANNING
What in God's name- ?
Hellboy, Abe, Liz and Johann race past him, disappearing
into the building. The alarm bells are deafening.
Hellboy leads the way down the corridors, which are alive
with scrambling personnel. Several BPRD employees are lying
on the floor, wounded and confused.
The top-level human agents are clustered in the lobby, their
guns drawn, all of them aiming at the Prince and his
drooling bodyguards. Standoff.
As Hellboy and the team arrive, Abe sees the Princess, her
arms tied. Her brother holds her by the hair.
ABE
Princess!
Without thinking, he darts forward. Instantly, one of the
trolls swipes at him, its claws just missing his chest-
HELLBOY
Abe! No, get back!!
Abe regains his balance and tries again, his eyes glued to
the desperate features of the beautiful young woman. Hellboy
manages to restrain him.
PRINCESS
Mr. Sapien, don't! He'll kill you!
PRINCE
I'll kill you all, if that's what you
want.
HELLBOY
No. Why don't you just start with me?
Hellboy strolls up to the Prince.
PRINCE
You challenge-me?
HELLBOY 2 86
HELLBOY
You bet your ass I do-
PRINCE
Your weapon of choice?
HELLBOY
(holds up his massive hand)
Five-fingered Mary.
In the background, Manning arrives, wide-eyed. Just in time
to see the Prince hand off his captive to one of the trolls.
He drops back, flips his spear to horizontal and waits for
Hellboy's attack.
130
130 FIGHT
Hellboy feints left, goes right and whips around, swinging
his tail at the Prince. The Prince leaps and jabs with the
spear, poking a hole in Hellboy's coat.
The surrounding crowd backs away as the combatants circle
each other. The Prince is nimble. The Prince is quick. He
thrusts the spear again and again, driving Hellboy into a
display case full of antique weapons.
The glass breaks and a number of swords and axes fall to the
floor.
JOHANN
(to Hellboy)
Arm yourself! Use the flail!.
HELLBOY
Not my style. Watch and learn, fish bowl.
He punches the Prince, hard. The blow knocks the Prince to
his knees; as he rises, Hellboy connects with a brutal
combination.
In the arms of the troll, the Princess' head rockets back
and forth, as if struck. A moan of pain escapes from her
lips.
ABE
(seeing this)
H.B., no! Stop - you mustn't harm him!
As the Prince totters, Hellboy turns to look at Abe,
momentarily distracted- Then-
HELLBOY 2 87
Hellboy grimaces and looks down: the Prince's SPEAR TIP is
half-buried in his chest...!
The Prince sneers and gives the spear a savage yank,
breaking off the blade! Hellboy's eyes roll upward; Liz
SCREAMS. She and Johann manage to catch Hellboy as he
collapses.
The Prince reclaims the Princess and turns to the humans.
His eyes seek out Abe, who has rushed to Hellboy's side.
PRINCE
(showing off the Princess)
If you want to see her again, you'll give
me what's rightfully mine. Many people
died for that crown. Bring it to me.
He and his trolls escape into the night.
CUT TO:
Stretched out on an operating table, HB is barely conscious.
Abe, in surgical goggles, probes the wound.
In CLOSE-UP, Abe's webbed fingers lightly touch the glinting
metal that protrudes from Hellboy's sternum. The spear tip
responds, as if alive; it wriggles, producing a GROAN from
HB.
Liz is near panic.
LIZ
Abe, stop studying! Pull the friggin'
thing out, why don't you?
ABE
Liz, I'm sorry. It's a magical alloy.
Every time I touch it, it moves closer to
his heart.
(GESTURING)
Come here, I'll show you...
Liz backs away, shaking her head.
LIZ
No! I don't want to see it!
(to Johann)
We've got to do something!
HELLBOY 2 88
ABE
I cannot reverse the magic- we have to
look for the Prince or somebody that can
help Red.
LIZ
Go after that son-of-a-bitch and get him
to reverse the spell!!
JOHANN
He'll demand the gold piece-
LIZ
So? We find it! We give it to him-!!
Manning exchanges a worried look with a couple of his agents
in the b.g.
Liz rummages in the Princess' quarters, throwing bedding
around, opening drawers.
133
Liz bursts into the conference room and starts shoving books
and papers aside, hunting high and low.
134
Johann walks into the control room. In every screen a crisis
situation is visible. JAGGED, BLURRY FOOTAGE shows a Yeti at
large in Nebraska and a Plesiosaurus at large in Scotland,
etc, etc-
AGENT AGATE
A lupgarou loose in Picadilly, a Winged
creature nesting in a skyscraper- We have
a situation in almost every point of the
map.
Johann looks back at a map with LED indicators signaling
each crisis in the globe. They keep turning on a dozen a
second.
JOHANN
The Rebellion's spreading too fast- The
only way to stop it is to stop the
Prince.
HELLBOY 2 89
Abe enters the dark, soaking library and surveys the ruins
of his tank.
He goes directly to one of the book stands, which lies in
pieces on the floor. He comes up with his copy of "Jane
Eyre."
He opens it to Chapter 23 and finds the gold piece.
LIZ
Any luck?
Liz has come in behind him. Abe quickly palms the precious
thing in his webbed hand.
ABE
No. Sorry.
LIZ
It doesn't matter.
ABE
No -?
LIZ
No. Forget the gold piece. Let's us just
find this royal asshole.
(FIERCE)
Fire and water, me and you, Abe. We'll
kick his ass.
Abe looks supremely troubled.
LIZ
Abe, let's do this for Red!
Abe nods, unable to find a good answer. He manages to tuck
the gold piece into his belt.
CUT TO:
Abe stands at a lectern. Behind him, a projected image of
the Princess' map from the troll market. His finger traces
the strange, elvish text.
HELLBOY 2 90
ABE
The map contained within the cylinder
seems useless-
(BEAT)
Now the case itself proves very useful-
He moistens the holding cylinder case on a rubber stamp mat
and imprints the surface pattern on the paper map. Glyphs
and coordinates become visible.
A silhouette of a twisted, gnarly tree is visible too.
ABE
Renvyle it is- Both the Princess and her
brother were born there. They hold it
sacred.
MANNING
Even if you're right, we sit tight and
locate the gold piece, make sure he never
ever gets his hands on it. If there's any
truth to this legend, the fate of the
world depends on it.
LIZ
What about Red?? Don't you care about
him???
A moment of silence. Nobody knows what to say. Finally:
JOHANN
Liz. That may be his destiny. Manning is
right: we can't take the chance.
Liz glares at him.
LIZ
I see. Red was right about you. Welcome
to the team, Johann. And goodbye.
She leaves the room.
CUT TO:
Hellboy leans weakly against the doorway to his room. His
cats purr all around him, oblivious to his pain. He sits by
the bed. Liz enters the room. He smiles weakly at her-
HELLBOY 2 91
HELLBOY
Don't worry, Sparky- It's all going to be
ALRIGHT-
Abe stands nearby, in silence. Liz looks at him, teary-eyed.
ABE
We'll make it alright. Screw Manning- You
are right, Liz- We should just do this
together: the three of us.
Liz smiles.
CUT TO:
The BPRD airplane sits quietly in its hangar. In the
passenger compartment, Hellboy climbs up. He looks up to see
Liz smiling down at him.
Abe's sitting in the pilot's seat, leafing through the
massive airplane manual.
ABE
Engine, starting- refer to NA-7488-BD...
Liz climbs in behind him.
LIZ
We stay here much longer, we're gonna get
caught...
ABE
Just a few more minutes. Here's an easy
way to remember that "port" means "left."
They each have four-
A NOISE from the door: it's Johann.
JOHANN
Good evening, friends.
LIZ
Don't try to stop us, Johann.
HELLBOY 2 92
JOHANN
On the contrary. I've been giving it some
thought, and we should be able to save
Hellboy. After all, the Prince lacks the
gold crown. Without it, his army poses no
threat. None at all.
Abe is very quiet.
ABE
(in despair)
Its useless- I- I- can't- I can't pilot
this thing...
Johann sits down in the co-pilot seat and melds with the
controls...
JOHANN
I'll give it a try-
Abe smiles at the sound of the engines starting up.
140
Manning bangs on a vending machine in one of the BPRD
corridors. As a dribble of hot coffee splatters into his
cup, a couple of AGENTS run up.
AGENT
Sir - you'd better come, fast -
MANNING
Got it - ow!
He burns his fingers on the coffee as he hurries after the
agents.
141
The BPRD airplane is ROARING, amid clouds of exhaust fumes.
The plane spins around and around in tight circles, its wing
tips knocking into ladders, lights and shelves.
A bunch of agents are cowering in the doorway as Manning
arrives.
MANNING
Not ALL of them, it's not possible!
AGENT
Isn't that Johann at the controls?
HELLBOY 2 93
Sure enough, they get a glimpse of the transparent head
through the cockpit window. Abe's there, too. He raises a
webbed hand to wave goodbye.
The plane taxis outside onto the runway...
As they bob up for air, they find there's only a few inches
of breathing room between the sea and the rocky ceiling. Liz
starts coughing.
JOHANN
Hang on, people. I'll be right back.
158
158 UNDERWATER
Johann dives down to find a rusting, iron LOCK six feet
under the surface. He tries to turn the control wheel, but
can't make it budge.
BELLBOY 2 103
Seconds later, Hellboy is at his side, gripping the wheel in
his huge hands. Using all his strength, Hellboy finally
manages to turn it.
His bandage, however, floats free... and his wound opens up,
emitting a plume of blood.
Lungs bursting, he shoots to the surface. Johann stays
behind and swings open the lock, revealing...
159 A STAIRWELL 159
.carved from the living rock, leading upward into the
depths of the cliff.
CUT TO:
160 STAIRS - LATER 160
The trio cautiously climbs the stairs, finding their way
with light sticks. Hellboy stops to lean against the wall.
He dabs at his chest with a rag.
LIZ
(to Johann)
Hold up. We need to rest.
HELLBOY
Says who? I'm fine, I tell ya.
He lurches forward, pushing past the others, fighting off
his pain.
LIZ
(to Johann)
This was a mistake. He's -
JOHANN
Mein Gott--
The stairs lead to-
-a vast underground arena where a thousand torches are
flickering.
CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal rank upon rank of GOLDEN
SOLDIERS. Immobile. Silent. Waiting.
HELLBOY 2 104
162 AMONG THE SOLDIERS 162
Hellboy leads the way down a row of gleaming statues,
pausing to gaze up at the blank face of one of the
infantrymen.
HELLBOY
Hey, amigo. You got some gum?
Two rows away, Johann examines the lethal weaponry that
terminates the arms of each soldier.
JOHANN
Most ingenious. A versatile, highly
mobile killing machine.
LIZ
Make that machines, Johann. I see more
than one.
Hellboy taps on a soldier's mechanical chest, which booms
faintly, sending ECHOES up into the dark cavern.
HELLBOY
Wow. You hear that? Listen -
He thumps it, harder. The mechanical thing rocks
backwards...
HELLBOY
Uh oh.
CRASH!!! The thing falls onto the soldier behind it! Then,
-
the ear-shattering noise of a hundred car wrecks builds as
- a toppling LINE OF SOLDIERS races away like falling
dominoes!!
HELLBOY
Whoops.
The sound dwindles, then builds again as ANOTHER LINE of
falling soldiers bears down on them!!
Liz screams and Hellboy pulls her aside. The soldiers crash
past them until -
- the din suddenly stops. The PRINCE stands revealed at the
head of the column.
HELLBOY 2 105
PRINCE
As a boy, they say I enjoyed toy
soldiers. So do you, I see.
He strolls past the mechanical figures, pausing to kick
aside some of the weapons.
PRINCE
(to Hellboy)
You're bleeding. Most unfortunate.
Hellboy wipes at his oozing chest wound.
HELLBOY
Yeah. Now it's your turn.
PRINCE
Do you envy these contraptions? They
never bleed. They feel nothing. Not even
the zest of combat.
The Prince circles them, keeping an eye on Johann.
PRINCE
These fighting men are the very model of
patience... merely awaiting word from
their lawful commander.
AS
From his tunic, he brings forth two of the gold segments.
he fits them together...
PRINCE
You have the remaining piece, I presume.
JOHANN
We do not -
PRINCE
(SURPRISED)
Then you are most foolish.
He gestures to some troll GUARDS near a tunnel entrance.
They lead the Princess out in chains.
PRINCE (CONT'D)
You came here expecting what? Mercy?
JOHANN
The death you would unleash will never
happen! What you need is far from here
and will stay out of your reach forever.
HELLBOY 2 106
A VOICE reaches their ears from the tunnel entrance behind
them.
ABE
Stop - I have it.
Abe, dripping wet, stands there, the last gold segment in
the palm of his hand.
ABE
(APPROACHING)
Here... For her... Take it...
JOHANN
Oh, my God. What has he done?
Keeping his eyes on the Princess, Abe gives the gold piece
to the Prince.
Hellboy steps forward, feeling dizzy and betrayed.
HELLBOY
Abe -
ABE
(to Hellboy)
You cannot fight him- not without hurting
her...
(BEAT )
What would you do if it was Liz??
CLICK! The Prince fits the gold parts together and places
the resulting crown on his head!
PRINCE
I am Prince Nuada and I command my army
to life once more. Does anyone dispute my
right?
With the deep sound of gears, ratchets and springs, the army
comes to life. Up comes the lances and shields.
PRINCE (CONT'D)
(points at the team)
Kill them.
Abe is now aghast, seeing the Prince drag his sister back.
ABE
(to the Prince)
That was your price!! A ransom, you said -
paid in good faith!!
(MORE)
HELLBOY 2 107
ABE(continued)
(to Hellboy)
Why, he lied to us!
HELLBOY
Abe old buddy. If we survive this, we
need to talk.
The Army swings into action, marching toward them. The four
friends retreat, soon pressed against one of the walls.
ABE
He - he's a cad! Can you imagine, a
highborn heir to the throne, last in a
noble line of-
BELLBOY
Not now, Abe, okay?
The first phalanx of golden soldiers is upon them, their
terrifying weapons slashing in unison. Hellboy brings out
his huge gun and starts firing as Johann grabs a torch and
swings it like a club.
A couple of the mechanical soldiers go down, only to pop
back onto their feet, new weapons blossoming on their arms.
LIZ
Let me -
Liz summons up a white-hot burst of electrical fire in each
hand. With a yell, she unleashes a searing EXPLOSION at the
oncoming fighters.
The shock wave rolls through the enemy ranks, flattening
scores of soldiers. For a moment, the BPRD team regains
hope... but the endless lines of mechanicals keep coming,
marching on and over their scorched comrades.
Hellboy holsters the Samaritan and rushes forward, giving it
his best. His wound is running with fresh blood.
He punches a soldier, whose mace pounds repeatedly against
his ravaged chest; as blood spatters his face, Hellboy
groans and keeps fighting, to absolutely no effect.
At length, the mechanical arms throw Hellboy against the
wall, where he collapses, unable to carry on.
JOHANN
Invincibility!? So - the only one thing
may stop them -
Johann unzips his suit; with a HISSS, his ectoplasmic self
flows out, into the body of the nearest mechanical soldier!
HELLBOY 2 108
Instantly, the thing whirls on its companions and starts
chopping! Bits and pieces of gold machinery fly about as
Johann rips into the enemy!!
But again, fresh metal soldiers fill in for the fallen. As
the BPRD team watches in dismay, Johann's mechanical shell
is surrounded by the other SOLDIERS, who methodically
dismember it like marauding insects!
As the parts drop to the floor, twitching and useless,
Johann slithers out and re-inhabits his suit.
JOHANN
Ach. They are too many. Anyone have
another idea?
Hellboy grabs the nearest sword and hauls himself to his
feet.
HELLBOY
(a bellow)
Prince Nuada: I challenge your right to
command this army!
With a soft BOOM, the clockwork troops come to a halt! All
the mechanical heads turn toward the Prince, who stands on a
ledge with his sister.
ABE
(follows HB)
No= please- no-
Hellboy moves away from him.
HELLBOY
A challenge must be answered! Raise your
sword!
PRINCE
A challenge from you? A nobody?? You are
no one.
PRINCESS
No!! He is Anung-un-Rma- son of the
Fallen one- He has the right!
Her eyes lock with Abe's: there's no other way.
The Prince sees Hellboy coming and with a bitter smile picks
up his sword.
HELLBOY 2 10 9
PRINCE
Very well.
(to the BPRD team)
May his fate show you the cost of pride
and blindness.
As the hall rings with their first blows of their swords-
JOHANN
Hellboy's too weak-
Summoning up his last ounce of strength, Hellboy manages to
drive the Prince back into the center of the arena, where
they fight under the inscrutable gaze of the golden army.
Every time Hellboy gets a clean shot at the Prince, Abe
looks at him, pleading, and HB has no choice but to keep
parrying off his enemy.
Hellboy's sword grows heavy in his hands; he stares at it in
dismay as it trembles. His muscles can no longer respond.
The Prince is ready to kill him.
LIZ
(witness to a nightmare)
No!! NO! !
A sudden movement at the ledge, where the Princess steps
forward and...
Using her concealed DAGGER, she STABS HERSELF in the right
arm!! In silent slow motion, she drops the dagger.
Instantly, the Prince drops his arm... his hands come away
red with blood. He looks over at his sister.
They share a hard look of mutual understanding. Love and
hatred.
Hellboy raises, through supreme effort, bleeding. He quickly
raises his sword. The fight resumes, but this time, HB has
the advantage.
He fights bravely and after parrying fiercely with the
Prince, he disarms him and points his sword at his chest.
HELLBOY
I- have- won-
PRINCE
No. You have not-
HELLBOY 2 110
He impales himself on HELLBOY's sword. The blade goes
through his abdomen and protrudes on the other side. Hellboy
pulls it out, but it's too late. Both the Prince and the
Princess collapse to the ground, mortally wounded.
ABE
(GASPS)
NO-
Abe hurries to the Princess. Takes her into his arms,
blinking in despair.
The pale young creature is now a ghostly white. She lifts
her eyes to Abe's, caressing his thin, scaly face.
PRINCESS
We'll find each other again, somewhere.
And she dies in his arms.
In the center of the arena:
PRINCE
(to Hellboy)
You... think you're any different from
me? The humans - they will tire of you.
They will disappoint you. And in the end,
they will betray you. You... are living a
lie. Your time will come again. May you
make a better choice.
Then, he, too, is dead. Both him and his sister turn to
fine, pale dust. And the wind carries away the ashes from
Abe's hands...
Shaken, Hellboy lifts the crown from the Prince's head.
Looks at it carefully, as if considering the possibilities.
Suddenly, he rips it into pieces. As he crushes the first
segement...
. an entire division of the golden army collapses into a
heap of scrap metal!
Hellboy does the same with a second section of the crown and
another massive division of the army tumbles into junk!
HB is about the tear up the last segment of the crown, when
it explodes in his hands!
WHUMP! The last of the army disintegrates.
Hellboy confronts the Prince's frightened troll guards:
HELLBOY 2 111
HELLBOY
(to the trolls)
You - and your kind! Leave here. And stay
in the shadows - where you belong.
As the ogres slink back into the tunnels, Liz looks at
Hellboy. He seems angry, stung by the Prince's last words.
DISSOLVE:
163
Light shines through the ice walls and into rows and rows of
machinery.
