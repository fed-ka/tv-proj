We see an early incarnation of a MACHINE (this will be the
inner brain of the FABRICATION MACHINE). We see the
scientist, in a white coat.
We pull back to see the Scientist is playing a complicated
MULTI-LEVEL 3-D chess game on a MULTI-LEVEL GAME BOARD with
the MACHINE. The Scientist makes an elaborate multi-level
move. The Machine reaches an arm out into the chess game but
then malfunctions and strews the game everywhere.
We pull back further to see the back and legs of the
DICTATOR, with black-uniformed soldiers flanking him. The
regime's emblem can be seen on the uniforms.
DICTATOR
Useless.
SCIENTIST
Please.
Give it a chance.
We're on the machine, which is clicking and jerking as it
malfunctions.
DICTATOR (V.O.)
One more.
That's all.
We turns to leave. We hear the clicking of boots as the
soldiers accompany him out.
We see the scientist's dejected face as he comes towards the
camera to turn it off.

The grainy footage rolls again; we see the scientist moving
away from the camera (having just turned it on).
The lab is shadowy, late at night. We see his worktable for
the first time, covered with discarded sketches, a furiously
filled-in journal, and pieces of failed machinery (the floor
is also similarly littered). The TALISMAN sits on the
worktable. Nearby is a small old-fashioned tiny little box.
SCIENTIST
(tired, but dictating to
keep the documentary
record complete)
My last possible solution....
(muttering to himself)
It must work...
He gently brushes his fingers over the little box as though
for good luck. He picks the TALISMAN up off the table. He
moves over to insert the talisman into the port of the
machine.
His back to us, he faces the machine. We see him putting
something over his face (but only from behind).
There is a sudden FLASH OF GREEN LIGHT and the machine JOLTS,
and then suddenly, starts up...lighting up, electricity
crackling, parts moving in smooth coordination, etc.
The scientist waits, watching. The machine continues to run.
Its arms move smoothly, almost curiously.
The scientist puts the device covering his face down and gets
up and comes towards camera.
We see the camera's POV as the scientist comes towards us:
CLOSE on the scientist's face, which is exhausted, cheeks
sunken, eyes wide, pupils dilated.
Pull back to show the machine purring, suddenly full of a new
sort of energy. Something new has happened.
The scientist switches off the camera and:

The machine zips through the complex 3-D chess game at
lightning speed, checkmating the scientist in seconds as the
Dictator watches.
The scientist laughs fondly and pats the machine.
DICTATOR
Perfect.
SCIENTIST
(PROUDLY)
You see, it evolves.
The scientist proudly gives the machine to the dictator. A
flash goes off: someone is taking a picture O.S.
The dictator exits; we hear the click of boots and see as
much as possible of the soldiers flanking him.
OUT OF SIGHT OF THE SCIENTIST,
CLOSE on the machine: the dictator is gripping it with a
nasty firmness. The machine seems to try to squirm away.
The director's BLACK-GLOVED HAND grasps it harder.

and grabs the nearest soldier (seen from the back, we see

The Winged Beast SHRIEKS at them. It catches its foot on the

of the staff to RING and attracting the Winged Beast's

Winged Beast advances towards him.
5 reaches out to 9.

As 9 recovers himself and makes a break for the bucket, 5
starts to lower the bucket down. Just as the Winged Beast is
about to catch up with him, 9 LEAPS down the shaft and lands
in the bucket with 5 and 6.

piercing the bottom of the bucket. The bucket rocks and 6 is
sent FLYING OUT but 5 CATCHES him in the nick of time.

jump.

SCIENTIST'S VOICE (cont'd)
...so little hope remains... that
is why I create you...
The footage crackles out, then RESUMES.
Now we see the FOOTAGE OF THE SCIENTIST MAKING 5.
SCIENTIST'S VOICE (cont'd)
(much more weakly)
I am unable to reverse the transfer
process... my life force diminishes
with each one of you... it is all
right... you will thrive...
Tenderly, he puts 5 together.
The footage crackles out, then RESUMES.
Now we see the footage OF THE SCIENTIST MAKING 9...
with
louder, more explosive sounds of WAR in the b.g:
SCIENTIST'S VOICE (cont'd)
...so little hope remains... that
is why I create you...
n the footage we now see him putting 9 into the strange
machine, putting the finishing touches on 9... brushing his
hand across the little box...
WE PULL OUT of the footage to see 9, looking in astonishment
at the flickering footage.
9 looks over at the little box in the scientist's hand in the
footage, and suddenly
FLASH
9 goes into a startling FLASHBACK:
HIS POV as he is suspended in the strange machine... he sees
the scientist, clutching the little box, from the front as
the scientist approaches him, a look of endless love on his
weakened, haggard face.
SCIENTIST

... it's up to you now...
(with his last breath of
ENERGY)
...you...you are all the pieces of
my soul...

The scientist puts the strange face mask on and 9's POV is
suffused with a GREEN GLOW.
The talisman clicks shut, the
soul transfer completed. We hear the scientist fall to the
ground, his soul depleted.
ACK TO PRESENT TIME:
9 comes out of his vision. He looks over the side of the
table at the dead scientist.
walks to the scientist and stares at the dead man.
(finally realizing it;
GENTLY)
You.
You're the source...
He reaches out to the skeletal hand clutching the box, then
simply touches the Scientist's hand, tenderly. He looks up,
a new, resolute look in his eyes.
