A handsome man (28) though now BRUISED AND BEATEN. FLASHING 
LIGHTS flicker on the periphery and the THUNDER of helicopter 
rotors is deafening. Where is he? Finley is in a...

INT. FBI HELICOPTER - PASSENGER SECTION -  NIGHT

Finley, in dirty suit and tie, sits HANDCUFFED in the chopper 
seat. The look in his eyes... he has been through something. 

Across from Finley THREE FBI AGENTS keep watch on him. Two 
agents are in SWAT gear, the third in just a windbreaker. She 
is FBI AGENT SUSIE DUNN (33). Almost to himself Finley says--

FINLEY
...My whole life all I ever wanted 
was to be a secret service agent.

AGENT DUNN
(no love lost here)
Well I hope you really enjoyed the 
one day you finally got to be one.

Look at Finley one more moment and then WE CUT TO:

asphalt until WE SEE TWO MEN walking down the road away from 
us. They wear DWP COVERALLS. They are KOZ(42) and FLIP (34). 

NOW WE CATCH UP to them, WE CAN SEE their faces. They might 
have been in the military once, maybe not that long ago. 

Flip has a can of ORANGE SPRAY PAINT in one hand and a 
COMPUTER TABLET in the other. Koz holds some kind of SCANNER 
in his hand. Koz looks at it as he walks, saying this--

Koz points down to the spot where the signal starts.

Using the spray can Flip paints an orangeX    on the road. 
Koz looks back down the road toward that other orangeX .

EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - INNER DRIVE - DAY

TWO SECRET SERVICE AGENTS stand in the morning sun next to 
their black SUV. A SECOND BLACK SUV sits close behind.7.


One agent is ALBERT HURST (45). Almost twenty years in the 
service, as good an agent as there is. He has seen it all. 

The other agent is Marcus Finley. Whatever Finley is about to 
go through hasn t happened yet. He is still fresh and eager. 
Finley SEES Hurst look at his watch and sigh. Finley asks--

FINLEY
Is he always late like this?

HURST
Near enough to always. 

Now bopping out of the PRIVATE QUARTERS comes SETH DEVORE 
(16). Hurst whispers into his sleeve and the second SUV 
starts its engine. Seth looks at Finley then asks Hurst-

SETH DEVORE
And who is this guy?

HURST
This is Agent Marcus Finley. Agent 
Finley this is Seth Devore.

FINLEY
Pleased to meet you, Seth. 

SETH DEVORE
Where is Valens?

HURST
Agent Valens is sick. The flu.

SETH DEVORE

Seth stares at Finley then cracks a smile and says--

SETH DEVORE
Welcome to the Brat Patrol. Now 
 gonna be late.come on... we re8.


Hurst and Finley load Seth into the back of the lead SUV. 
Then Hurst gets behind the wheel and Finley in the passenger 
seat. The doors close. Hurst starts the engine. The TWO SUV 
Motorcade rolls down the drive, away from the White House.

EXT. THE BALLARD HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT  - DAY

Kids carrying and pulling overnight bags head toward the bus.

 A 2013 CAMARO roars into a parking space. From the driver s
side steps LUKE PUTNAM (16), lacrosse God. From the passenger 
side steps SLOAN DEES (16), cheerleader. Luke puts his arm 
around Sloan, she is his. They head toward the bus. Passing-- 

A humiliating little family scene. Beth Ann, Ian by her side, 
watches as her PARENTS ARGUE IN LOUD WHISPERS, IN PUBLIC. 

Luke and Sloan look at Beth Ann, what they are thinking is 
 what a loser Sloan, and Luke golden at glares Ann Beth  .
then Beth Ann turns back to look at her parents. So do we. 

Timid, meek Bill Gibson, in sweater vest and thick glasses, 
tries to stand his ground in front of a much stronger Janice.

BILL GIBSON
 my Why am I here? Because it s

 here. why I m

JANICE GIBSON
But we talked about this. How Beth

They are counting on me, Beth Ann.

JANICE GIBSON
Oh. Now suddenly you care that 
someone is counting on you?9.


Beth Ann, Ian at her side, withering with the shame of this.

BILL GIBSON
This school offers us generous 
tuition relief. The least I can do 
is help out when I can.

JANICE GIBSON
(leaning in closer)
You are embarrassing your daughter, 
you see that, don t you, Bill?

And now, Beth Ann has had enough. She will end this. 

BETH ANN GIBSON
Enough. Enough.
(to her father)
 You. Get on the bus. But you don t
 look at me. talk to me. You don t

And holding back tears, Beth Ann turns from her parents and 
heads toward the bus. Ian at her side. 

Into the throng of kids heading into the bus Beth Ann goes. 
She looks straight ahead, not wanting to make eye contact.

A curly haired English teacher stands outside the bus door, a 
clipboard in his hand. He is MR. NASH (33). Mr. Nash is just 
the kind of teacher high school crushes were made for.  

MR. NASH
Beth Ann Gibson.

Beth Ann pays him no attention as he checks of her name, just 
stomps onto the bus. Mr. Nash checks off the next student.

MR. NASH (CONT D)
Ian Martinez.

Ian gets on. Mr. Nash continues to check off names. Everyone 
is getting on the bus. Time to go. Last hugs from parents. 

INT. BUS - DAY

The bus idling in the parking lot, not moving. Everyone is on 
board. Lots of teen energy. Popular kids, geeky kids, loud 
kids, jocks, fat kids, quiet kids, more than a few speaking 
foreign languages, some well dressed, some dressed down. 

WE SEE Amber Fitch sitting with an equally, preppy girl. They 
are going through Habitat For Humanity literature. 10.


WE SEE Luke and Sloan, in a group of other lacrosse players 
and cheerleaders. A loud, giddy, good looking pod. WE SEE 
chubby Anton Roth sitting by himself, nose in his sci-fi book 
and Jin Liao watching soccer on his IPAD with another kid. 

WE SEE Beth Ann sitting with Ian. She glowers at her own 
reflection in the window. Ian sketches in a sketch pad. 

WE SEE Mr. Nash up by the BUS DRIVER and Bill Gibson all the 
way in the back on that uncomfortable bench by the bathroom. 
Everyone ready to go but still the bus just sits idling. 

SOMEONE SHOUTS
What are we waiting for?

SOMEONE ELSE SHOUTS
What are we always waiting for?

 what. Out the windows of the bus WE CAN see the TWO Here s
SUV Secret Service motorcade pull into school parking lot. 

The doors of the front SUV stay closed. The doors of the back 
SUV open and a SECRET SERVICE agent with a BOMB SNIFFING DOG 
gets off. All the kids on the bus see the dog, many of them 
begin to bark. They have been through this drill before. 

The AGENT walks the DOG onto the bus and works the dog up the 
aisle. Nose under seats, into back packs and purses. The bus 
is clean. The Agent whispers into his sleeve. A bunch of boys 
mumble into their sleeves. They have all been here before. 

The Agent with the dog leaves. Out the window the doors to 
the front SUV open. Agents Hurst and Finley escort Seth 
Devore to the door of the bus but he boards without them.

Seeing Seth, the lacrosse team breaks into this song.

The Bus Driver closes the door and puts the bus in gear.

EXT. THE BALLARD HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

The bus pulls out. One black SUV in front of it. And one

CAMERA MOVES to the aisle and FOLLOWS Luke and Sloan as they 
head quietly to the back of the bus. There is the bathroom 
back there. Mr. Gibson is on the bench back there too.

Mr. Gibson, the parent chaperone, watches Luke and Sloan head 
right for him. Once there, Luke opens the bathroom door and 
is about to usher Sloan inside. But, timidly, Gibson says...

Everything has stopped. The bus. The SUV. The Trooper s car. 
Hurst and Finley step out of the Secret Service SUV as--.

TWO TROOPERS step out of their cruiser. They wear large hats 
and sunglasses that obscure most of their face but even so WE 
know them. WE have seen them before. Koz and Flip, no longer 
dressed as DWP workers. Now dressed as State Troopers.

He steps back from them toward the bus and his protectee.

FINLEY (CONT D)

You talk to the other agents in 
person or on the radio?

Now something in the heavy woods catches Finley s attention. 
Movement. A glint of something. A man with an assault rifle.17.


FINLEY (CONT D)
GUN!

As Finley calls this out he draws his own gun and turns to 
Hurst. Hurst has gun out now as well but it is aimed right at-
Finley. There is a sudden look of confusion on Finley s face. 
Why is Hurst pointing his gun at him?

FINLEY (CONT D)

Hurst pulls the trigger and shoots Finley right in the side.

 VISION IS FILLED by one of those BLANK MASED Now FINLEY S

LOOK AT FINLEY -- his world is coming apart on this road.

Almost everyone loaded on to the truck now. Almost. Through 
vision blurred with blood loss Finley SEES Anton still on the 
road. He is so scared he has collapsed in a heap of tears. 

Everyone else is on the truck. It is time to go. They have to 
leave now. One of the masked men pulls Anton to his feet. 

ON FINLEY: as he fights the blood loss and unconsciousness 
that tries to pull him under. And now... so quietly, Finley 
gets to his feet and moving like the trained professional he 
is, Finley BLIND SIDES that masked man from behind. 

The man goes down but Finley does not stop moving. Finley 
GRABS ANTON AND RUNS. Off the road and into the dense woods 
that start just five feet from the black top. Gone.

Koz and Flip are back off the truck now. Ignoring their 
fallen comrade they look out toward the woods. 

FLIP
We are out of time. We gotta go.

KOZ

need you to handle it.

The truck pulls away. Koz in the Trooper car behind it. 
Leaving behind an empty bus, an empty SUV and a blood stain.

EXT. HEAVY WOODS - DAY

Finley pulls Anton as they run through the trees. Finley is 
in shape but bleeding. Anton is young, chubby and scared. 

INT. BIG RIG TRUCK - CARGO HOLD - DAY

Everyone from that bus is in here. The students, bus driver, 
Gibson, Mr. Nash. It all happened so fast they are still in 
shock. Some kids cry. Some whimper. No one speaks.

Not Amber. Not Ian. Not Sloan or Luke. Not Seth. Not Jin. No 
one. Beth Ann can see her father. Gibson sits with his back 
to the wall of the truck. Immobilized by fear. 

They ride like this for a moment, looking at each other. Not 
having any idea what to do. And then... they stop.

MR. NASH

What now? Here is what now.

A SMALL HATCH at the front slides open and TWO SMALL METAL 
CANNISTERS BOUNCE into the cargo hold. The hatch slides shut. 
Everyone in the cargo area backs away from those cannisters. 
But there is only so far away they can get and now...

PFFT... PFFT. Gas begins to fill the compartment. It is thick 
as smoke. They try to keep from breathing it but they cannot. 
It is overwhelming them, they begin to pass out.

The few who cling to consciousness a few moments longer than 
the rest SEE the back doors open. They see Koz and TWO of the 
other GUNMAN, ALL NOW WEARING GAS MASKS, step into the gas 
filled cargo hold. The air so thick they can barely be seen.

Like figures in a dream, the three men in gas masks move 
through the thick haze as we come to...


END OF ACT ONE21.


ACT TWO

EXT. RURAL MARYLAND ROAD - DAY

Just the abandoned Secret Service SUV and the bus. And quiet. 
Now WE HEAR the roar of an engine and that lead Secret 
Service SUV screeches into frame, brakes hard and stops.

The doors open and the agents in there leap out, guns drawn. 
They search the bus, the other SUV... but everyone is gone.

INT. HEAVY WOODS - DAY

Finley runs, pulling Anton by the hand. Pudgy little Anton 
can barely keep up. Now Finley turns to him and WHISPERS--

FINLEY
You have to run.

ANTON ROTH
I am running.

FINLEY
You have to run faster.

ANTON ROTH
This is as fast as I run.

I have a very short stride.

But now Finley stops whispering to Anton. 22.


Finley looks and SEES he is leaving a trail of blood drops.

FINLEY (CONT D)

ANTON ROTH

They are travelling along a ledge that drops six feet to a 
lower level of the forest floor. Finley looks down there. Now 
he listens. Does he hear movement? He whispers to Anton--

FINLEY
Stay here. 

Finley walks further in the direction they had been going, 
letting his blood drop. After twenty feet he doubles back to 
where Anton waits. Finley points over the ledge and whispers-

Finley puts an arm around Anton s shoulders, a hand over his

Finley and Anton cling to the rock wall as above them Flip

Light streams down on it from an unknown source.

Slowly Beth Ann opens her eyes and squints to see she is in--

Beth Ann sits up a bit more and has a better look at the 
ballroom. Strewn about it lay the kidnapped; the students, 
Nash, the bus driver. Some awake. Some just coming awake. 

No sign of Koz, Hurst or the other kidnappers but SECURITY 
CAMERAS mounted high on the walls SCAN the room. 

BETH ANN GIBSON

BILL GIBSON
Yes. We have. But I want you to--

Beth Ann SEES Ian, not far away, beginning to emerge from 
unconsciousness. Beth Ann leaves her father and goes to Ian. 

Mr. Nash is up now. He looks around, taking a head count.

MR. NASH
Is everyone here?

AMBER FITCH
No... Anton is missing. 

More students rousing themselves. Through their post drugged 
haze they try to piece together what is happening.24.


IAN MARTINEZ
Why would they take Anton?

AMBER FITCH
 That man who was shot They didn t.
took him. We were already on the 
truck but I saw him take Anton.

SETH DEVORE

Finley, the new guy. Hurst shot 
Finley. Just shot him... 

LUKE

That is so messed up.  

MR. NASH

JIN LIAO

My mouth hurts. 

LUKE
Stay calm? Dude, are you at all 
aware what s going on?  The guy who 
is supposed to protect Seth shot 
the other guy who is supposed to 
protect Seth. Then we got gassed.

JIN LIAO
(still quiet)
Does anyone else s mouth hurt?

AMBER FITCH
Mr. Nash is right, Luke. Panic is 
not going to help anyone.

LUKE
I think you can stop being 
president of the class now.

JIN LIAO
DOES ANYONE ELSE S MOUTH HURT?

Everyone hears him. A few students raise their hands. Sloan 
notices she has a bandage on her leg. Just above her knee. 

SLOAN
Oh my God. What did they do to us? 
Mr. Nash, what did they do to us?

A few more kids have bandages on their arms and legs as well. 25.


And now panic runs through the room. WHAT WAS DONE TO THEM?

MR. NASH
Please, you must try to stay calm. 

LUKE
 that, I am out of here.F 

Luke grabs Sloan and heads toward the big windows. But before 
he can get there A DOOR in one of the walls opens and a BLANK 
MASKED GUNMEN steps into the room. He carries an assault 
rifle. His presence stops everything cold. All eyes on him. 

The gunman looks around the room. He walks amongst them. They 
are all scared but show it in varying degrees. The gunman 
stops before Gibson who trembles in fear. But Gibson summons 
up a small amount of courage and in a shaky voice says--

BILL GIBSON
I... I am the parent chaperone. 
What did you do to these children?

The Gunman stares at Gibson. Then the Gunman takes a piece of 
 chest--paper from his pocket, pushes it against Gibson s

GUNMAN
Read. Out loud. 

Gibson takes the paper, reads in a voice halting with fear.

BILL GIBSON
This will all be over in four days. 
No one will be hurt. Food and 
drinks will be provided for you. If 
there are special dietary needs 
please speak up. You may use any of 
the rooms on the first floor of 
this house. The doors and windows 
have been sealed and alarmed. The 
rooms are monitored. Your phones 
have been taken. You may gather in 
groups of no more than five people.  
Some of your parents have had 
tracking devices implanted under 
your skin or in your teeth...

This is too much for Gibson. He cannot go on reading. He 
tries but is too scared. Amber, nearby, takes the paper.

AMBER FITCH
We have removed those devices. We 
tried to be as careful as possible. 
(MORE)26.

AMBER FITCH (CONT'D)
If you need something for the pain 
please raise your hand and 
something will be brought to you. 
As you can tell from the way you 
were taken we are professionals, we 
know what we are doing and will get 
you all home safely if you respect 
that. If you do not respect that we 
are also very comfortable with the 
use of force. Are there questions?

Everyone too stunned to ask anything. Except for Gibson who 
raises his hand and asks the Gunman--

BILL GIBSON
Is there... a bathroom I can use?

The Gunman points to a door at the end of the room. Gibson 
goes toward it. Just one more humiliation for Beth Ann.

INT. MANSION BATHROOM - DAY

Gibson enters, closes the door, turns on the light. He looks 
at his hand. It trembles. He wills it to stop. He will be 
brave. He looks at his face in the mirror. He will be brave.

INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS - WASHINGTON D.C. - CORRIDOR - DAY

A group of FBI agents QUICKLY MOVES DOWN THE CORRIDOR. As 
they go... AGENT SUSIE DUNN(32) briefs FBI DIRECTOR OLSEN. 

FBI DIRECTOR OLSEN

a rookie, in his car this morning. 
Hurst re-routed the bus just before 
departure, sent the lead Secret 
Service SUV ahead just before the 
attack. Then two minutes after the 
bus was taken he called in an All 
OK to Secret Service dispatch. 

The Director takes this in as they PUSH THROUGH A DOOR into--

INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS - WASHINGTON D.C.

FBI SUVs, doors open, engines on, lights flashing wait for-27.


Dunn, Olsen and the others who emerge from the corridor. 

FBI DIRECTOR OLSEN
(points to photo of Hurst)
Hurst worked this from the inside. 
(re: photo of Finley)
And maybe the rookie too. We lock 
Secret Service out of this 
investigation. Give them nothing. 

They are about to board an SUV but Olsen stops Dunn.

FBI DIRECTOR OLSEN (CONT D)
I can brief the President. I want 
you out at the school.

This clearly was not the direction Dunn was hoping to go. 

FBI DIRECTOR OLSEN (CONT D)
We re getting the parents together. 
I want you on that. Your master of 
the universe sister is there right?

AGENT DUNN
Her daughter was on that bus and--

FBI DIRECTOR OLSEN

AGENT DUNN

FBI DIRECTOR OLSEN

Dunn can only watch as Olsen closes the door and the SUV 
motorcade  thunders off. Leaving Dunn alone. WE CUT TO:

breaks the kidnapping story. Meg stares at her tablet but--

getting done I mean how could it--28.


MEG FITCH
I know it is nervous energy but you 
need to stop talking right now.

The Assistant stops talking. Meg concentrates on the tablet, 
on the news story there as the elevator doors open revealing-

A sleek CORPORATE CHOPPER waits. Rotors turning. Door open. 
STAY WITH MEG as she gets on the chopper, the doors close and

WOLF BLITZER (ON TABLET)

to CNN of the possible involvement 
of at least one and perhaps more 
Secret Service agents...

EXT. HEAVY WOODS - DAY

Finley and Anton huddled against that rock wall. Finley has 
his shirt and protective vest off. There is a bullet hole in 
his side. ANTON CANNOT LOOK AT THE BLOOD. Finley has ripped 
his T-shirt into strips and he begins to bind his wound. 

ANTON ROTH
Are you going to die?

FINLEY
No. 

ANTON ROTH
How come it went through the vest?

FINLEY
There is a small space on the side 
between the fasteners where the 
bullet went. But my rib stopped it. 
Lots of blood but nothing serious. 
You have to help me here, Anton. I 
 tie this binding on my own. can t

ANTON ROTH

FINLEY
Sure you can. 

ANTON ROTH
Please stop telling me what you 
think I can do. I am fully aware of 
my own limitations. No blood. 29.


FINLEY
OK. Then keep your eyes closed and 
hold out your hand. 

Anton does. Finley puts one end of the binding into it. 

FINLEY (CONT D)
Pull it tight. 
(as Anton does)
Good. 

ANTON ROTH
Why did your partner shoot you?

FINLEY

ANTON ROTH
Well, did he ever do anything 
before to make you think he might

FINLEY

ANTON ROTH

did you just meet him this morning?

No signal. We are going to get to 
high ground and call in the troops. 

Anton nods OK and together they set off. 

S FBI SEDAN - DAY DUNN INT. SUSIE S

Dunn drives up to the Ballard School. It is bedlam. Reporters 
on the ground, in trucks, in the air. UNIFORMED COPS have 
established a perimeter. Dunn badges one and drives in. 

STAY IN THE CAR with Dunn as she drives through the chaos up 
 disgorge these to the school. Limos and blacked out SUV s
rich and powerful parents. But amidst it all Dunn sees one 
woman... Meg Fitch. And even with all the noise, Dunn hears 
the echoes of a long ago argument loud and clear in her head. 
She hears two voices pitched full of emotion and rage...

YOUNGER MEG FITCH (V.O.)

Dunn and Meg share a quiet stretch of hall.

service agents being involved?

Meg nods that she understands. They are nearly to the 
auditorium door when Meg says to Dunn.

MEG FITCH
Susie, all these people are used to 
being first in line. So get ready 
because they are all going to want 
answers and there will be no line.

AGENT DUNN
I think I can handle it.

INT. THE BALLARD SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

Dunn in the midst of THE SWARM OF PARENTS. They all want 
answers from her, they all want to be first in line. They 
push and shove. There is no line.  It is OVERWHELMING.

PULL BACK to look at the scene FROM ABOVE and now the image 
of the parents swarming Dunn in the auditorium is on a 
MONITOR. From a surveillance camera. SOMEONE IS WATCHING.

INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - DAY

A grand kitchen for a grand house. This is where the 
kidnappers have set up their HQ. Koz, Hurst and the three 
others. Lots of gun, the masks, pizza boxes. 

On the wall of the kitchen: PHOTOS OF EACH PARENT with THEIR 
CHILD. Under each parents photo is their NAME AND OCCUPATION.

There are also ROWS of monitors. There are live feeds from 
the ballroom: the students, Gibson, Nash and the bus driver. 

There are news feeds: CNN and the other Networks. And one 
monitor shows the LIVE FEED from the Ballard auditorium.  Koz 
zooms in on Dunn and that swarm of parents AS WE COME TO: 


END OF ACT TWO32.


ACT THREE

INT. BALLROOM - DAY

Pizza and drinks have arrived. Softer foods for those with 
sore mouths. People eat and drink in silence. Huddled in 
groups of no more than five. 

Beth Ann and Ian eat with three other kids. Gibson comes 
over, pizza and a drink in hand. He is about to sit down but--

BETH ANN GIBSON

IAN MARTINEZ

BETH ANN GIBSON

An uncomfortable moment. The other kids look at their pizza. 

BILL GIBSON

Gibson goes off to sit with Nash and the bus driver. 

One of the kids in Beth Ann s circle is (TIM). He has shaggy 
hair and a stoner smile. Tim points at Seth Devore who sits 
with Luke, Sloan and two lacrosse players and says-- 

TIM

right? And when his dad sends the 
troops to rescue him which one of

BETH ANN GIBSON
Perfect, they can put collateral 
damage under my yearbook picture.

This kind of freaks out the lacrosse players and Sloan. They 
move away from Seth. Abandoned, Seth defends himself to Tim.

SETH DEVORE

This gets everyone thinking. We look at Beth Ann looking at 
the faces of his fellow classmates. Now she says to Ian--

BETH ANN GIBSON

kid... who is it about?

But Ian does not answer her. Beth Ann turns to see that Ian 
is staring across the room at Amber. Of this Beth Ann says--

BETH ANN GIBSON (CONT D)
You can sit over there if you want.

IAN MARTINEZ
Sorry.

BETH ANN GIBSON

INT. THE BALLARD SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

Agent Dunn stands before the onslaught of those Ballard 
School parents and their questions. She tries to be heard...

AGENT DUNN
I KNOW YOU ALL HAVE... I KNOW YOU 
ALL HAVE QUESTIONS BUT--34.


Dunn cannot be heard over the parents  din. Now Meg, without 
a word, raises her hand (elbow bent, palm head high). Another 
parent sees Meg do this, raises her hand and stops talking. 
And another and another. It is a Ballard School thing. And--
Dunn watches as the parents fall silent. Dunn has the floor. 

AGENT DUNN (CONT D)
I know you all have questions and I 
know you are used to getting 
answers but I have none for you. If 
you want to help then you will stop 
talking and do as I tell you to do. 
Time is crucial and I need you to 
start thinking. Start thinking 
about the last few weeks of your 
lives. The agents you see are 
passing out recollection prompts. 

The parents see FBI agents handing out PAPER BOOKLETS.

AGENT DUNN (CONT D)
Fill these out. They will help you 
remember every phone call and text, 
every conversation, the car behind 
you at the light, the man next to 
you at Starbucks, new neighbors and 
the workmen across the street, the 
woman at your front door selling 
magazines... Each of you will have 
an FBI agent assigned to them. If 
you have information you believe to 
be relevant, tell them now. If not 
start thinking and fill these out. 

A LARGE MAN(55) speaks up in a South African accent. He is--

JAKOB VRIES
We all know which kid you want to 
find. He lives in that big house on 
Pennsylvania Avenue. And I know 
this recollection prompt is crap.

 FACE. Vries tears up the prompt and THROWS IT IN DUNN S

JAKOB VRIES (CONT D)
I will take care of this myself.

Vries stalks to the door making a cell phone call as he goes.  
Dunn looks to her sister. Meg informs Dunn who Vries is.

MEG FITCH
Jakob Vries. CEO of Red Iron. They 
do private contracting for the DOD. 
...He s got his own mercenary army.

Sir... Excuse me, Sir.

JAKOB VRIES (INTO CELL PHONE)
Bring everyone in... Everyone.

AGENT DUNN
Sir, I understand how you want to 
help but this only gets in our way.

Vries ignores her. Heads toward the door. She cuts him off.

JAKOB VRIES
I want a battalion by nightfall. 

AGENT DUNN

down and get off that call. Now. 

Vries thinks about it then he BACKHANDS Dunn so hard in the 
face she goes down. Like swatting a fly he hits her and moves 
on as the crowd gasps. The agents spring into action but--

Dunn is up and at Vries first. She gets him in the knees with 
her telescoping baton. As he goes down she gets him again 
across the temple. With blood in her mouth Dunn says to him--

EXT. WOODS - A CLEARING - DAY

Finley and Anton emerge from the woods. In the center of the 
clearing is an old farm house. It looks vacant but--

FINLEY
They might have a phone. And if not 
that roof looks high enough to get 
cell reception if we get up on it.

ANTON ROTH
We? I ve made it a life long policy 
not to climb on roofs.

FINLEY

They head for the house but now THEY HEAR a SOUND LIKE

the sky over head. Finley and Anton look up. Finley explains.

FINLEY
Combat Air Patrol, they must have

The Gunman senses Gibson, turns and it is not even close. The 
Gunman strikes Gibson in the throat. Gibson goes down. Now

A computation book is brought to Gibson. With his right hand 
he opens it and turns page after page of handwritten notes,

Gibson looks at his wife and daughter. They look back AND ALL 
THE BRIGHT BIRTHDAY COLOR DRAINS FROM THIS HAPPY MEMORY AS 
THE JOY DIES. THE SOUND BECOMES BRITTLE AS IF IT WILL BREAK.

INT. BALLROOM - DAY - PRESENT DAY

Gibson looks at the children of the powerful. Now he looks at 
his kid, Beth Ann. Gibson rises, cross the room and enters...

INT. MANSION - BATHROOM - DAY

Gibson locks the door, goes to the opposite wall and pulls a 
hidden latch... a hidden door swings open.

INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - DAY

Gibson steps into the kitchen. Koz hands him the phone.

INT. FBI HELICOPTER - PASSENGER SECTION - NIGHT

Finley in cuffs and across from him three FBI Agents. Two are 
in SWAT gear. Agent Dunn in just a windbreaker.

FINLEY
...My whole life all I ever wanted 
was to be a Secret Service agent.

AGENT DUNN
(no love lost here)
Well I hope you really enjoyed the 
one day you finally got to be one. 

Dunn looks out the window. They are about to land on the 
rooftop of the FBI building. Armed agents wait for them.

The chopper lands. Finley is hauled from it and under heavy 
guard is hustled into the building. Dunn follows. 

INT. FBI H.Q. - CRISIS MANAGEMENT CENTER - NIGHT

Dozens of agents in hyperdrive. Flat screens show satellite 
maps of Maryland and LIVE VIDEO FEEDS from the kidnapping 
scene; the empty bus and the SUV still swarming with agents.  58.


Dunn enters. STAY WITH HER as she moves through the chaos. 
SHE SEES a furious Director Olsen addressing the troops. 

FBI DIRECTOR OLSEN

t  know who took them. We don don t
know why. We do know we got beat 
today. Badly. So no one goes home. 
No one has a life except for this.

Except for Dunn who heads right for the elevator.

EXT. MEG FITCH S HOUSE - NIGHT

Dunn stands outside the front door. Waiting. It opens and 
 face. there is Meg.  A look of horror comes over Meg s

MEG FITCH
Is it bad news?

AGENT DUNN

Relief floods over Meg but then is replaced with curiosity.

MEG FITCH

of those Secret Service agents?

AGENT DUNN

MEG FITCH
Then... why are you here?

AGENT DUNN
...That man at the school who hit 
me, he just wanted to see his kid. 
Then one of the other parents, 
he... he did something he never 
would have done because... because 
he just wanted to see his kid. 

Emotion rises up in Dunn and this time she lets it come. Meg 
feels it too and in a voice so soft and tender Meg says--

MEG FITCH
And you just want to see your kid.

AGENT DUNN
I know I said I never wanted to. I--

 find the words. Meg says Dunn wants to say more but can t
shh, takes her sister by the hand and leads her inside.59.


 MEDIA ROOM - NIGHTINT. MEG FITCH S

Dunn stands before the projection screen upon which Meg boots 
up a video of Amber playing volleyball. Softly Meg says...

MEG FITCH

AGENT DUNN

(then)
The last thing I said was... I 
asked you to take care of her...

MEG FITCH

Tears on Dunn s face as she watches her daughter. Meg hears a 
phone ring. Meg moves to the other room to get it. Into the--

 HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHTINT. MEG FITCH S

Meg moves to answer the phone. She picks up the house phone 
but that is not the source of the ringing. She grabs her cell 
phone off the counter but that is not the source either. Meg 
moves to the stack of mail. THE RINGING GROWS LOUDER. 

She shuffles through the mail and finds a sealed envelope. 
She looks at it as if she has never seen it before. Meg opens 
it and slides out a ringing pre-paid phone. Meg answers it.

HEAVILY PROCESSED VOICE (ON PHONE)

of parent photos behind him. His daughter on the monitor.

How far are you willing to go?
