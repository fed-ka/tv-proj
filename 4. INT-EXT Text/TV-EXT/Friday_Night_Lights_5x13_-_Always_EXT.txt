      Early morning in Dillon.  As we ve never seen it before -- 
      dressed for Christmas.  Dillonershanging their lights;  
      Ray s B.B.Q.all dressed up for the holiday; Buddy s Bar 
      looking merry, at the Landing Strip two strippers dressed as 
      elves stand out front, welcome the lunch crowd.

      CHYRONREADS: 

      FIVE DAYS TO THE TEXAS HIGH SCHOOL STATE CHAMPIONSHIP


    The LIONS sit in directors chairs answering questions from 
    the LOCAL and some NATIONAL TV REPORTERS.  VINCE, LUKE, 
      TINKER, BUDDY JR., HASTINGS.  It feels strangely like a 
      callback to the pilot, except a lot of red replaces the blue. 

                                    INTERVIEWER
                    How do you feel about the shut down 
                    of the East Dillon program?

                                  TINKER
                    It s a conspiracy.

                                  VINCE
                    I don t wanna comment on that.

                                  LUKE
                    I think it s a mistake is how I 
                    feel.

                                  HASTINGS
                    It blows.

                                  BUDDY JR.
                    It sucks.

                                    INTERVIEWER
                    How does it make you feel that this 
                    is likely the last game of football 
                    you ll ever play?

                                  TINKER
                    You re a jackass.

      CLOSE ON VINCE -- Hero shot.  Thoughtful.  

                                    INTERVIEWER
                    I was watching the new kid Sterling 
                    -- looks like he s going to make a 
                    helluvaback.

                                  VINCE
                    He s a Panther.

                                    INTERVIEWER
                    I m thinking next year.  Rumor is 
                    you ll be quarterbacking the 
                    Panthers.  Best of Panthers combined 
                    with the best of the Lions.  They re 
                    calling it the Superteam.

      Vince sees Tinker, JESS, a few scrubs watching.  They won t 
    be part of the Superteam.

                                  VINCE
                    I don t wanna talk about that.  I 
                    wanna talk about this Friday.

                                    INTERVIEWER
                    What about this Friday?

                                  VINCE
                    About how the East Dillon Lions are 
                    going to win state.

                                    INTERVIEWER
                    Is that a wish or a promise?

                                  VINCE
                    It s a fact.

                                    INTERVIEWER
                    Rumor has it you ll be coaching the 
                      Superteamnext year.

      COACH TAYLOR thinks, chews, then--

                    No comment?  Really?  Because we ve 
                    heard the offer they made you is 
                    pretty sweet.

      Matt and Julie, stride through the parking lot toward the 
      Freeze.  She play hits him.

                                  JULIE
                    I can t believe you didn t tell me 
                    you were coming back for Christmas.  
                    Why didn t you let me know?  We 
                    could ve planned things -- 

    She realizes he s no longer next to her.  She turns and sees 
      that Matt has dropped to one knee.  Time slows.  She takes in 
      what is about to happen.  Matt is more serious than he s ever 
      been.  He takes out a diamond ring.

                                  SARACEN
                    This is Grandma s.

      Julie is stunned.  Mind moving a mile a minute.  She knows 
      she s going to have to say something really soon that will 
      determine her entire future.  She s shaking.

                    I just, I ve been thinking about

                    to Chicago.  That week.  It felt 
                    good.  Real good.  I know we re 
                    young.  But I love you.  And I 
                    know.  I just know.  You know, that 
                    you re the one Julie Taylor.  Will 
                    you marry me?

                    marry you, Matthew.

      They throw themselves into each other s arms and kiss.  She 
      screams and jumps up and down.  People stop to watch.

      RIGGINS and BILLY are under the hood of Tim s truck.

                                  RIGGINS
                    I thought you said you were taking 
                    care of my stuff, Billy.  

                                  BILLY
                    It was running fine all this time 
                     til you come back.  I think you 
                    pushed it too hard.  And what do 
                    you care anyway?  You re off to 
                    Alaska do drill for oil.  

                                  RIGGINS
                    I may or may not.

                                  BILLY
                    Is that right?

                                  RIGGINS
                    I m thinking about putting that on 
                    the back-burner for awhile.

      Billy narrows his eyes, spits.  

                                  BILLY
                    It s cause you got with Tyra.

                                  RIGGINS

                    It s incest now.

                    It isn t incest, there s no 
                    bloodline.

                    I know it isn t technically, but 
                    it s just way too weird.

      again, any excuse to get the kid off her hip:

      Vince takes the moment to hydrate -- looks at Tinker who

                    You alright working over at Buddy s 
                    bar?  You need anything, son?

                                  RIGGINS*
                    No, sir.

      Taylor senses the vulnerable place this kid is in right now.

                                  TAYLOR
                    You hang in there.  It ll get 
                    easier.

                                  RIGGINS
                    Yes, sir.

      They re distracted because on the field, Billy is screaming 
      again!

                                  TAYLOR
                    What about that guy?

                                  RIGGINS
                    No doubt.  He s a screamer.

                                  TAYLOR
                    I think he s hollering a little 
                    extra loud today for his family.
                          (then)
                    You two work things out?

    On cue, Billy looks over -- sees the three most important 
      people in his life together.  Gives a wave.  Tim looks at his 
      brother, lifts his hand, waves back.  Peace offering.


      Vince walks toward ORNETTE hanging out with some friends.  
      Before Ornette sees him, Vince can hear snippets of his 
      conversation.

                                  ORNETTE
                    Kid was doing a three-step drop, 
                    but I told,  You got an arm, you 
                    gotta use that arm. 

      Ornette notices Vince, immediately feels a little caught 
      bragging about his son.  He s also still smarting a little 
      about his son throwing him out of his own home.

                                  VINCE
                    Hey....

                                  ORNETTE
                      Whatchudoinon this side of town.  
                    I heard you all Westsidenow.

                    Come on, Pops.

      It s with a laugh.  It s a jab.  The friends laugh.  But 
      there s hurt, anger and humiliation underneath.  Vince takes 
    it in stride.

                                  VINCE (CONT D)
                    Can I talk to you a sec?

      They go off aside to talk.  There s a beat.

                    You doing okay?

                                  ORNETTE
                    You don t need to come check up on 
                    me, boy.

      That came out harsh, so Ornette pulls back a bit--

                                  ORNETTE (CONT D)
                    How s your Momma doin?

      Vince takes a beat.

                                  ORNETTE
                    You just gonnastand there.

                    We got State Friday.

                                  ORNETTE
                    I know you got to State.  I live 
                    here.

                                  VINCE
                      I requested a ticket for you.

      Ornette, clearly moved by this, considers.

                                  VINCE (CONT D)
                    I m driving out with the team.  And 
                    Mom has a ride out with some of the 
                    other parents.  So you d have to 
                    make your way out there on your 
                    own.  We probably wouldn t get to 
                    see you that much otherwise, but 
                    you d be there.

    Too prideful to accept this half invitation...

                                  ORNETTE
                    Gotta lot going on that day.  But 
                    I ll be watching.

      Ornette walks back to his boys.  OFF Vince, realizing the 
      cost of locking your father out of his own house.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Tim, holding Stevie, comes out of the store with a six pack.  
      Runs into Becky on her way in.  Awkward.

                    I miss her, but I don t want to go 
                    back there.  But I don t have a 
                    choice.  I mean, it s weird at the 
                    house now.  Mindy s been a total

                    She probably feels bad is all.

      Becky looks at Tim, surprised and moved that this nugget of 
      wisdom was stored in his beer infused mind.

                                  BECKY

    We hear a scream of joy from within as CHERYL realizes that 
      Becky has arrived.  Cheryl runs out, sweeps up Becky in her 
      arms.  Mindy watches, bittersweet.

    She looks at him, he s serious.  She tears up, seeing that he

    The East Dillon bus slowly winds its way down the narrow road 
      that parallels the Midway, flashers on, with a police escort.  
    In October, when the State Fair is going, this place would be 
      alive with noise and energy.  Right now, it s silent.

    But it doesn t matter.

      tunnel, and players climb out.  FAVOR OUR GUYS - Vince, Luke, 
      Tinker, Hastings, Buddy Jr. - as they stare up at a dream:  
    the iconic green letters that read,  Cotton Bowl. 

      Taylor and his staff (including STAN) take it in too.  This

      same thing. 

    ON THE THEIR FACES - No jubilation.  No victory without 
      sacrifice.  Eyes wide open.

    ON THE BRIM OF A CAP -- a hand reaches up and adjusts a red 
      ball cap.  Under the cap are THE EYESof COACH ERIC TAYLOR.

                    Friday night in Texas.


      Vince, in Panther Blue, is going through summer drills led by 
      Coaches Crowley, Spiveyand Riggins.  We see Tinker, riding 
    the bench at the moment, but on the team.  Vince kept his 
      promise.  Also riding the bench, Buddy Jr., cast off, ready 
    for anything.

      arrival of COACH HAYWARD walking across the field for the 
      first time.  We follow him in his Panther jacket like how we 
    met Coach Taylor in the pilot.

    The coaches head over like a group of ducklings just found 
      their momma, and start talking him up.  Hayward is polite, 
    but has his eyes set on meeting one person in particular.  He 
      walks up to Vince.

                    Heard a lot about you, son.

    As he shakes Vince s hand we do that classic Friday Night 
      Lights handshake thing and we see on Vince s hand, a State 
      Championship ring.  I guess someone caught that pass.


    As a small crowd of people say their good-byes, we find Luke 
    in a military uniform, kissing Becky good-bye.  He hands 
      Becky his Championship Ring.  As he boards the bus, hold on 
      Becky s hopeful gaze as she tries to glimpse him through the 
      tinted window.

      Meanwhile, East Dillon isn t looking as good.  The football 
      field is being used as Student parking.  Becky gets out of 
    her car, she finally got one.  She meets up with a few 
      girlfriends and walks in.  Behind her, workers are removing 
    the Lions sign from the scoreboard.  A 2010 State 
      Championship Banner hangs nearby.  Ironic.

      catching glimpses of a squad of Dallas Walker High players.

      Buddy, now the head booster at West Dillon, has laid claim to 
    Joe McCoy's old golf cart, speeds along the field with the 
       Clear Eyes, Full Hearts  sign in back.


    Tim is hammering nails of his own.  Into the foundation of 
    his house.  On the other side of the foundation, Billy is 
      working on the house too.

                    remember this time when together we 
                    accomplished the impossible. 


      Team has a knee.  Taylor is finishing up his speech.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)FNL 426/513 "Always"         YELLOW       07/15/1052.

                                  TAYLOR
                    Let me tell you something.  That 
                    wasn t half bad, gentlemen.  We have 
                    a long way to go.  But we are right 
                    at the beginning.  The beginning of 
                    something new.  The beginning of 
                    something good.  Gentlemen, clear 
                    eyes, full hearts...

    The players don t have any idea what they re supposed to say.  
    He smiles.

                                  TAYLOR (CONT D)
                    You ll learn the rest.

      Taylor looks up and sees Tami Taylor coming to pick him up.  

                                  TAYLOR (CONT D)
                    Go home and get some sleep.  Six 
                    A.M., Gentlemen.  When I say six 
                    a.m. I sure hope to see you here no 
                    later than five-forty.

    The team disperses and Taylor walks the other way to Tami who 
      comes from the other side of the field.  The players now 
      gone, Tami and Eric are two lone figures walking toward each 
      other.  Something so high school about it.  They meet around 
    the 40 yard line.  Kiss.  Look at each other.  No resentment.  
      They have moved on.  Literally.  The power of their marriage 
    the most important thing in either of their lives.  

                                  TAMI
                    You ready to go home?

                                  TAYLOR
                      Absolutely.

    As they begin to walk off the field...

                                  TAYLOR S VOICE
                    And know that wherever I go and 
                    whatever I do, I will take these 
                    memories with me.  I will cherish 
                    these memories.  Always.  

    The lights power down, and in the darkness, we can just 
      barely make out the ghostly figures of Tami and Eric Taylor.  

                                                                      GO TO BLACK:
