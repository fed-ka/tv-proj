SAN FRANCISCO
DAY
Where a trade show is in progress. Scantily clad lovelies in red-white-and-
blue undies demonstrate the nation's most important new export: arms.
Every weapon imaginable is on display: rifles, pistols, even howitzers. Banners
declaim the virtues of Winchester and Springfield. Of Colt and Remington
and Smith & Wesson. Crowds mill around a stage. where:
WINCHESTER REP
Ladies and Gentlemen ... the Winchester
Corporation is proud to bring to you... a true
American hero. A patriot who has proven his
gallantry time and again on the field of battle.
LITTLE TIN SOLDIERS are all lined up. A mass of grey. Rebel troops
surrounding a band of blue Union cavalry. A large, metal diorama.
WINCHESTER REP
I hope you will join us in welcoming ...Late of
the U.S. Cavalry. The Savior of Sutter Hill ...
Captain Nathan Algren!
A last swig. Algren steels himself, then strides onstage as we reveal a banner:
2.
WINCHESTER PRESENTS: THE MIRACLE AT SUTTER'S HILL!
Garish limelight from a row of foot lights illuminates Algren.
ALGREN
My thanks, Mr. McCabe... Ladies and Gents.
He looks down at the little metal soldiers and begins to tell the story of the
battle that made him famous. His narration is halting, unsteady:
ALGREN
... On that fateful day, Johnny Reb had us in a
spot, perched on the lonely top of Sutter's Hill,
nothing but grey as far as the eye could see:
Unhorsed and out of ammunition, I gazed down
into the, um, mael... mael...
(squints to see better)
-maelstrom below us, and saw them moving up.
We realize he is reading from cue cards. The little Rebel soldiers begin sliding
up the metal hill.
ALGREN
I knew it was fight or die. Into the teeth of the
enemy or we would all be buried... buried ...
(loses his place, under his breath)
Shit...
(finds it again)
...on the same hill with our comrades a1ready
gone to Merciful Heaven...
A sudden flash:
Algren's mind. The real battle of Sutter's Hill. The grim reality is ver y
different from the dashing tale. Union soldiers scream in agony. Those
horses still alive buck and froth at their tether.
.
Algren, a lieutenant then, moves among the panicked, bloody men. He stops beside a
PRIVATE, his brother, DAVID ALGREN, 19, blonde, not much more than a boy.
DAVEY
They're coming, Nate.
He looks over the wall. Rebel troops are moving up the hill.
ALGREN
Keep your head down.
DAVEY
(smiling)
Papa alwa ys said we should've joined the navy.
ALGREN
What'd he know?
(looks fondly at his brother)
You watch me now. Do whatever I say. .
3.
DAVEY
Aye-a ye, lieutenant.
Algren punches his shoulder and moves on down the line. Nearby, Algren's
friend, SERGEANT ZEBULAH GANT, though severel y wounded, reloads
his revolver with the last of his ammunition.
GANT
How're the horses?
ALGREN
Better than you. Smell better, too.
(looks at him)
Can you hold on, Zeb?
GANT
(fighting the pain)
I got I choice?
Algren smiles sadly. His mend will die loon without medical attention.
Algren moves down the line, bullets whizzing overhead. He kneels beside
COLONEL BAGLEY, his commanding officer.
BAGLEY
(panicking)
We need a flag. Find me a goddamn white flag!
ALGREN
What are you talking about?!
BAGLEY
Surrender, damn it! That's an order!
Back to the convention hall:
ALGREN
No thought of surrender among those boy.
Better to die as God made us, we thought, as
soldiers... So I gave the order. Mister Bugler,
sound mount up. Mister Bugler, sound prepare
arms. There were only thirty of us, but we had
fire in us yet. I looked down the hill at the destiny
ordained for us. And gave the order. Mister
.
Bugler, charge!
The little Union cavalry soldiers begin moving down slots in the hill.
On Sutter's Hill:
Algren leads a chaotic cavalry charge down the hill toward the advancing rebel
infantry -- artillery explosi ons - bullets snapping, trees shattering.
Algren's brother, Davey, rides beside him.
4.
The wounded Sergeant Gant pulls himself up, waves his cap and yells.
Bagley remains cowering behind the stone wall.
Back to the convention hall:
ALGREN
And straight into them we went...
On Sutter's Hill :
Carnage. Union and Confederate soldiers slam together, falling, drowning in mud
and blood, stepped on by panicked hones.
Algren wields his saber in one hand and his revolver in the other, serving
death on all sides.
A soldier riding next to Davey is shot. A horse falls into a shellhole.
Back to the convention hall:
ALGREN
"Hip-hip hurray" we shouted, for we
had spirit in us yet--
More flashes:
Algren slices right and left with his saber. He is a truly gifted swordsman.
A tree branch knocks Davey from his horse. He sits, dazed, on the ground.
Algren kills a rebel soldier just as be is about to fire on him.
Single-handedly, be rallies his men, screaming orders, then lifts his wounded
brother onto the saddle beside him.
He leads them downhill toward safel y, Davey clinging to him for dear life.
Back to the convention hall:
ALGREN
Before they knew what hit them, we had broken
through into the rear of the rebel army.
On Sutter's Hill:
Algren and his men gather in a copse of trees. They are giddy with the exhilaration
of having survived.
DAVEY
We did it, bro', WE DID IT! Whoeeeee!!
Algren's smile is shortlived, though.
5.
SUDDENLY, the woods ERUPT with gunfire. Trees are shredded.
Algren's men are literally cut to pieces-
Davey is riddled with bullets, his dead body shielding Algren from harm until
he slides, lifeless, to the mud.
ALGREN
Davey---!!!!
Men and horses are torn apart -- they contort and writhe in agony  jerking
grotesquely as the bullets rip into them. Algren frantica1ly tries to locate the
source of this firepower. Then he sees:
A Gatling Gun.
Six barrels glisten like steel teeth. This early machine gun is the pinnacle of
current military might -- 60 rounds a second -- a triumph in engineering.
ALGREN
AHHHHHHH--!!!!!
With insane courage, he wheels and charges the gun.
Bullets rip into horse and rider alike. Algren falls, lifeless, into the mud.
Back to the convention hall:
ALGREN
And the 23rd rode on to glory.
Applause.
At the back of the hall three elegantly dressed JAPANESE MEN watch
Algren's performance. They wear Western frock coats and top hats
ALGREN
Now let me: tell you, gentlemen, if there's one
thing on earth I could have had with me on that
glorious day, it would have been this beauty...
Algren holds up a Winchester repeating rifle.
At the back of the audience we note someone else watching Algren.
SERGEANT ZEBULON GANT, whom we last saw on Sutter's Hill.
ALGREN
The Winchester Model '73 lever-action rifle.
15 shot capacity, one round-per-second,
accurate at 400 yards. You'll note the
patented loading port just beneath the
cartridge chamber and the smooth
cocking action. ...Lets' just see here--
6.
He peers into the ejection port as he cocks the weapon and sights out over the
crowd.
KA-BOOM!!! The report echoes among the screams of the ladies. Dust and
glass fall from a rear chandelier.
ALGREN
Smooth trigger action, too.
Audience-members murmur nervousl y.
ALGREN
This is, gentlemen, The Gun That Is Winning The
West... Step on up and take a look. Mr. McCabe is
here to answer any question and take orders. I thank
you.
Later...
A Winchester representative is handing Algren an envelope.
WINCHESTER REP
What the hell was that?
ALGREN
Got their attention, didn't I?
WINCHESTER REP
Boston in three weeks. And sober this time.
He goes. Algren immediately starts counting the cash.
SEEDY HOTEL ROOM
NIGHT
Algren sits alone on the bed. He takes out a leather-bound journal and begins to write.
ALGREN (V.O.)
June 17th, 1876. The dead are with me tonight.
They return each time I am obliged to tell their
story.
SQUALID BAR
NIGHT
Algren sips absinthe. He stares at the milky, green liquid before him.
ALGREN (V.O.)
I can almost see them in the shadows, their
bodies whole and beautiful once more. Sometimes
it's as if they call to me in a sweet invitation --
7.
SEEDY HOTEL ROOM
NIGHT
Algren is back in the hotel room. From his small suitcase, he takes the
Medal of Honor, looks at it for a long moment.
ALGREN (V.O.)
"Do not be afraid," they whisper. "You have been
dead, too."
A sudden flash:
We are back on Sutter's Hill. Algren's slaughtered cavalry litter the bloody
ground, dead to the last man. A rebel army surgeon gives a cursory look at
each body before it is loaded onto a wagon.
Algren's turn is no different than the others. He is declared dead and hoisted
unceremoniously onto the pile of corpses.
Back in the. hotel room.:
Algren sits, staring into the middle distance.
ALGREN (V.O.)
Is this why they gave their lives? So that I might
disgrace their memory?
He reaches into the suitcase and takes out a Colt revol ver. Stares at it, cracks
the cylinder to make sure it's loaded. His finger wraps around the trigger,
the barrel makes its wa y toward his head.
And then, unaccountabl y, he is laughing.
ALGREN (V.O.)
And why, after taking so many lives, do I find
myself incapable of taking just one more?
A KNOCK on the door. Algren shuts his eyes, then calls out.
ALGREN
Go awa y.
GANT (V .O.)
Not exactly the greeting I imagined.
8.
Algren looks up. He knows that voice. He carefully puts the revolver back into the suitcase and shuts it before
opening the door.
GANT
Thought you'd seen the last of me, I expect.
Algren is filled with emotion, which he tries to hide.
ALGREN
Zeb...
They embrace.
ALGREN
Sit. Please.
Gant moves to the proffered chair with a pronounced limp.
GANT
... Saw your little melodrama
toda y.
Very inspiring... .
ALGREN
Given up soldiering to become a critic?
Gant smiles and shakes his head.
GANT
Got a job for you, unless you're running for
office...
ALGREN
I have I job.
GANT
I mean a real job. Back in uniform.
ALGREN
I' m retired.
GANT
I don't mean a U.S. uniform.
Algren looks at him. Curious despite himself.
RESTAURANT
NIGHT
Gant leads Algren into a lush San Francisco restaurant. Flickering gaslight
and trays of lobster. COLONEL BENJAMIN BAGLEY (whom we saw in
flashback) sits with the three Japanese men. Bagley's hair has greyed. He
9.
has his eye on a political future.
BAGLEY
Nathan, good to see you.
ALGREN
(stunned)
Colonel Bagley...
BAGLEY
Sit down. This is Mr. Omura, from Japan, and
his two associates who, so far as I can tell, don't
have names...
OMURA 40, is a handsome and intelligent man. He watches Algren closel y
as Algren pours a glass or whiskey from a decanter.
BAGLEY
They're looking to hire real American soldiers to
create the first Japanese Imperial Army.
Algren looks at him.
BAGLEY
Japan's got it in mind to become a civilized
country and they're willing to spend what it takes
to hire white experts to do the job right.
Algren takes a slow lip of whiskey.
BAGLEY
Sergeant Gant has already agreed to serve. You
would be m y second-in-command.
ALGREN.
With approval from Washington, of course.
BAGLEY
Both governments prefer to consider our mission
unofficial. We'd be there as non-combatants
BAGLEY
(MORE)
only, advisors to the Japanese officers. Help
them with training, ordinance and the like.
GANT
You ought to think about it., Captain. Unless
you intend to take up a career in the theater.
ALGREN
I have an agreement with the Winchester
Corporation -- I'm sure these people have some
concept of what an agreement is.
10.
Omura suddenly speaks. His English is flawless.
OMURA
You are paid seven dollars for each performance.
You do, on average, fourteen performances a
year. We will pay you 400 dollars.
ALGREN
A year?
OMURA
A month.
Algren looks at him. The figure, in 1876, is staggering.
EXT
SHIP--OCEAN
DAY
A steamship chums its wa y across the great Pacific. Algren leans on the
ship's rail and looks out into an endless processi on of wa ves.
ALGREN (V.O.)
June 23, 1876. It is impossible, standing here,
not to appreciate one's, own insignificance.
A dolphin crests the surface, arcing into the air.
ALGREN (V.O.)
Here there is neither past, nor future. Only an
oblivion of water.
In his tiny cabin, Algren finishes writing in his journal and takes out a
daguerreot ype of a HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL BLOND WOMAN.
ALGREN (V.O.)
And yet I ask myself, will the dead follow me
across the ocean to this strange new land?
He stares at the woman in the picture.
SHIP  CABIN
DAY
In the main cabin, Algren sits with Gant and Omura. Algren is drinking.
OMURA
...After the Shogun gave up power, the daimyos 
you would call them warlords --knew that Japan
needed a centralized government. So they asked
11.
OMURA (CONT'D)
the hereditary Emperor, His Highness the
Enlightened Meiji, to lead the country.
ALGREN
And these warlords just ... gave up hundreds of
years of power?
OMURA
Economic incentives were offered. Most
provincial leaders saw the financial benefits of
modernization.
ALGREN
What about those that didn't?
OMURA
To deal with those who have resisted, the
Emperor has decided to create an Army with
allegiance only to him... We considered hiring
advisors from Germany, but your Ambassador
reminded us of your experience in suppressing rebellious
elements in your Civil War.
This evocation of the Civil War is not lost on Algren.
ALGREN
Who are we supposed to be fighting against?
OMURA
His name is Mori Katsumoto. He is samurai.
ALGREN
Samurai?
OMURA
The word you might use it "warrior". But that
does not quite capture it ... Katsumoto once served
the Emperor but he is now a traitor who leads a
band of traitors. He must be punished.
Algren looks pointedly at Bagley.
ALGREN
You told them about our experiences together
on Sutter's Hill, did you, Colonel?
BAGLEY
They know I was your commanding officer.
Yes.
Algren glares at Bagley, then stands.
12.
ALGREN
Excuse me, gentlemen. I need some air.
(to Omura)
I'm sure Colonel Bagley can amuse you with
more stories of patriotic gore.
He walks away.
OMURA
He is insolent.
BAGLEY
Get him in front of the troops, you'll see. Top
of his class at West Point. Brilliant tactician.
Even wrote a book.
OMURA
Why did he leave your army?
BAGLEY
What's a hero to do when there's no more great
battles?
OMURA
Is that an evasive answer?
BAGLEY
Sir, this man was left for dead at Sutter's Hill.
Doct ors swore his heart had stopped beating,
but before they could bury him, he came back to
life. After the war he fought the Sioux, the Cree,
and the Blackfoot.
(leans closer)
.
Point him at the enemy. He was born for it.
SHIP -- ALGREN'S BERTH
NIGHT
Algren lies in his cramped berth. Can't sleep.
A sudden flash:
On the wagon of dead bodies, Algren's eyes open to stare into the unblinking
eyes of his brother, Davey, half his face shot off. He tries to move but be is
buried beneath the weight of those piled on top of him. Blood drips down
into his eyes and mouth, blinding and choking him.
Back to the ship:
Algren awakens, bathed in sweat. Terror. A silhouette in the doorwa y.
13.
Colonel Bagley stands looking down at him.
BAGLEY
I hope you realize the kind of second chance
this is for you. I won't tolerate insubordination.
Algren reaches for a nearby glass, drains it.
ALGREN
Court-martial me.
BAGLEY
Would you rather I hadn't recommended you
for the medal. Nathan? Is that it?
ALGREN
We both know why you helped me, Colonel.
Don't expect me to go all weepy with gratitude.
BAGLEY
I expect you to do your job. Save the self-pity
for your own time.
He turns and walks out, leaving Algren to stare at the empty glass.
GUEST QUARTERS
DAY
A shoji screen is opened by a bowing servant to reveal the clean, classic lines
of a Japanese room. Algren is about to enter when Graham stops him,
indicating for Algren to remove his boots.
Algren scowls, confused, and struggles to pull off the high, filthy boots. He takes
in the foreigness of the room, an arrangement of fl owers on a low table.
ALGREN
No chairs? . .
GRAHAM
Correct. And this--
(points to a mat)
..is your bed.
ALGREN
And this?
He points to a block of wood.
GRAHAM
Your pillow.
ALGREN
You mean to say there are no real beds in Japan?
GRAHAM
For its entire history Japan his been completely
aakoku, I "closed country." Thirty years ago, if
you had washed up on Japanese soil... you would
have been beheaded on sight. Now, they let you
keep your head... and give you a wooden pillow.
IMPERIAL PALACE  ANTECHAMBER
DAY
Algren waits with Bagley and Graham outside the throne room.
GRAHAM
Remember that he is arahitogami. A god in
human form. During the last two hundred years
no emperor was even seen by commoner. You
may look at him, with deference, but do not speak
unless you are spoken to.
RESTAURANT
NIGHT
Sergeant Gant gazes unhappily at his dinner: glistening raw fish; tepid
beancurds; boiled rice. Algren, Gant, Graham, and General Yoshitaka sit
cross-legged on the floor. Gant finds this extremely uncomfortable.
GRAHAM
... Before the edicts ever y citizen had to prostrate
himself in the presence of a samurai.
ALGREN
What edicts are those?
GRAHAM
The Council of State has been passing a series
of laws designed to eliminate the samurai.
GANT
Why?
23.
GRAHAM
Because you are here now, Sergeant... For the
last 800 years guarding Japan and fighting her
wars was the exclusive occupation of the samurai.
The next course arrives. Thick, black eel. Gant groans.
GRAHAM
Men like Mori Katsumoto were the most elite
caste in Japanese societ y until the Council of
State -- led by your friend Omura - decided the
whole class had to go ...
(munching eel)
... Most of the samurai accepted the new laws.
But some didn't. Or couldn't. Like Katsumoto.
General Yoshitaka speaks up. Graham translates:
GRAHAM
General Yoshitaka bids you to remember that
the word samurai means "one who serves." Their
whole existence is based on serving their
country as warriors.
Graham finishes translating, then continues on his own:
GRAHAM .
Your Imperial Army is taking awa y their only
reason for being ... So what are they to do now?
Algren considers this as he pours another cup of sake.
.
ALGREN
This is sake?
GRAHAM
Sake. Rice wine.
YOSHITAKA
Hie! Sake.
ALGREN
Sake..
(to Yoshitaka)
Good.
Yoshitaka nods. Enthusiastically tries an English word.
YOSHITAKA
Good!
24.
GRAHAM
Vexing people, the samurai. Blood-thirsty,
honorable, cruel, fabulousl y artistic. Wanted to
write a book about them for years, but no
Westerner can get close enough.
ALGREN
Ask him if he ever saw a samurai in battle.
Graham looks at A1gren.
GRAHAM
He is samurai.
Algren looks at Yoshitaka with new eyes.
GEISHA HOUSE
NIGHT
This is certainly not the whorehouse they expected. Elegant Japanese
furnishings. Lovel y flute music. The MADAM lowers her head and speaks
quietly in greeting.
GANT
My friend and I were looking for some
companionship...
The Madam speaks no English. Gant speaks louder, as if to a deaf person.
GANT
Ladies of the evening? Hootchie-contchie?
Boom-Boom?
ALGREN
( embarrassed)
Zeb.
(tries a bow to the madam)
...so sorry.
Gant flashes a fistful of Japanese currency.
GANT
Universal language. boyo.
The Madam nods and bows. Almost magically, two beautifully-dressed
GEISHAS appear, their faces are painted pure white.
25.
One of the Geishas smile. Her teeth are blackened, to better set off the
whiteness of her face paint
GANT
That one's yours.
GEISHA HOUSE  ROOM
NIGHT
Algren and Gant are led into an elegant room with paper screens, and a table
set for the Japanese tea ceremony.
.
Gant tries to take the arm of one of the geishas - but she moves awa y,
gesturing for him to sit The other begins the tea ceremony.
ALGREN
No tea... Sake.
A musician plays a traditional lute. The geisha begins a graceful fan dance.
GANT
Fan dance. Saw this once in Chicago.
Algren smiles at the Geisha preparing the. She smiles back. Algren pours
himself a cup of sake.
Later...
The sake bottle is empty. The interminable lute music continues.
Gant is increasingly agitated as the geisha continues her dance. Algren can't
help but laugh at his frustration. Finally Gant has had enough. He rises, a
bit unsteady from the sake.
GANT
Okay, darlin' time to get down to business:
He shoos the musician out of the room, then approaches the geisha, who
shrinks from his intention.
ALGREN
Zeb. I don't think she --
GANT
She's just shy. Who knows what we white devils
have got in our trousers, eh, darlin'?
He takes her arm. She resists - her voice rising.
GANT
Come on, now.
He tries to pull her along. Her kimono tears. She calls out in terror. Two men
appear, bouncers presumably, but alight of build.
26.
ALGREN
Oh, shit.
The Madam yells angrily at Gant in Japanese. Pushing him out roughly.
GANT
Now, hold on there, sister. I paid good money.
One of the bouncers puts his hand, politely, on Gant's arm.
GANT
Back off, short-stuff.
This time, the bouncer is more insistent. Gant takes a swing at him. Wrong
move. Before Gant knows what hit him, the little man uses Gant's
momentum in an akido move to flip him to the mat, hard.
Algren can only stare, in awe, at the lethal move. As the second bouncer moves
to confront him, bowing apologetically, Algren speaks in English, smiling,
knowing they can't understand a word he's saying.
ALGREN
Obviousl y you can kick the shit out of people
much larger than you, so we'll be leaving now...
TENT
DAY
Colonel Bagley and Algren stand at a map. Omura sits.
ALGREN
They're not a fighting unit yet
BAGLEY
We have no choice.
(refers to the map)
--the railroad has been stopped here. Just as it
entered Yoshino, Katsumoto's province.
28.
OMURA
Captain, we
cannot govern a country in which
we cannot tr
avel freel y. ... Katsumoto's
provocation
is strategic. His defeat will
demonstrate
to the other disloyal samurai that
resistance is
an act devoid of honor.
BAGLEY
The rebels don't have a single rifle. They're
savages with bows and arrows. You get up there
and show 'em how it', done.
ALGREN
With respect, sir, I need more time.
OMURA
With all due respect. this railroad cannot wait.
He bows and leaves them alone. Bagley spins on A1gren.
BAGLEY
You think we're the only country interested in
Japan?! You don't think the Germans and the
French would like to oversee the new army?
ALGREN
Colonel--
BAGLEY
(brutally)
Why do you think we're here, Captain? Because
Remington and Colt and Winchester have
powerful allies in Washington. We're here to
sell a shitload of American guns...and steel...and
timber. That shouldn't be bud for a Winchester
whore like you to understand.
Algren looks at him, murderously.
ALGREN
Yes, air.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
NIGHT
Algren'. eyes open...
A WOMAN is leaning close, her eyes intent on the task of sewing up his
wound. She is beautiful, but he is not really conscious enough to notice, or
37.
even feel the pain. He blacks out again.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
NIGHT
Algren wakes again. He is lying on a simple mat. His injuries are such that
he can barely move his head. He takes in the traditional Japanese furnishings.
A red ball rolls across the floor. And after it... TOSHIIE, a little boy. around
four. The boy l ooks at Algren. offers him the ball. Smiles.
A1gren blacks out...
INT
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
ANOTHER DAY
Algren's eyes open...
Through the archway he can see Toshiie and his older brother HIGEN, around
ten. Also the beautiful WOMAN who earlier was stitching his wound.
From his recumbent position, Algren watches as she ministers to the boys,
who are dearly her sons. Algren is fascinated by her grace and the sweet
attention she gives them.
She seems to sense him. Her eyes raise, meet bit. She speaks to someone,
and YORITOMO appears. He is twenty-one, too young to be the woman's
husband. Yoritomo comes into Algren's room. Speaks to him.
Algren shakes his head. Doesn't understand
Yoritomo speaks to the woman, who approaches and places bowl of soup
in front of Algren. He ignores it
The boys stand in the doorwa y. Yoritomo shoos them awa y.
Algren glances up at the: woman. Her eyes avoid his, her expression is opaque.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
ANOTHER DAY
Algren now sits in the main room. The woman is changing the dressing on
his wounded right shoulder and arm.
Yoritomo kneels across from Algren. He is impressed at the many battle
wounds on Algren's body; the old bullet wounds and scars. In Japanese, he
indicates his admiration.
Algren his no idea what Yoritomo is saying. Finally he interrupts with the
only Japanese word he has bothered to learn:
ALGREN
Sake.
38.
Yoritomo's face breaks into a wide smile.
YORITOMO
Sake?
ALGREN
Sake.
Yoritomo glances to the woman. She nods, and brings A1gren a saucer of
sake. He drinks it down. Holds out the saucer for a refill
Smiling, Yoritomo indicates for the woman to comply, but before she can
pour another saucer, Algren takes the jug out of her other hand. Yoritomo
laughs as Algren drinks it down.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
NIGHT
Algren writhes on his mat. Trapped in his recurrent nightmare.
A sudden flash:
The wagonload of the dead. Davey's bl oody corpse closes in on Algren
suffocating him.
Back in the house
Yoritomo and the woman are asleep in separate rooms.
A piercing SCREAM shatters the night
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
FOLLOWING
Yoritomo and the woman hurry to Algren's room --
Algren in the throes of his recurring nightmare - awakens, disoriented.
ALGREN
Sake.
Yoritomo and the woman confer. Yoritomo looks It Algren and shakes his
head, no.
39.
ALGREN
SAKE!
Yoritomo refuses -- Algren roars and tries to rise. Laughing at Algren's
ferocit y in his weakened condition, Yoritomo easily pushes him back down.
Algren folds in on himself, rocking like a feral animal.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
NIGHT
Algren sits hunched in a dark corner. His body is convulsed with shivering.
His withdrawal from alcohol, his wounds, his isolation and his imagined sins
are devouring him.
.
Then we see he is not alone. The woman stands in the doorway, watching
him closel y. Finally she enters with a bowl of soup.
He glances up, something like panic in his eyes.
She kneels and attempts to hand him the soup, but be knocks it out of the
wa y and grabs her by the throat.
40.
ALGREN
Sake!
She stares at him, the breath being squeezed out of her, but there is not even
a whisper of fear in her eyes. She is utterly impassive. Shaken, he lets her
go, and crumples to the floor.
.
ALGREN
(mumbling to himself)
Sake...
The woman leaves the soup and wa1ks away.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
DAYS LATER
Daylight streams in, finding Algren lying on his back. The worst of the detox
is past. As be lies there, these first moments of repose lead to:
A sudden flash of memory:
The beautiful blond WOMAN from the picture laughs merrily, and falls
back languorousl y in a grassy fi eld.
Back in the room
Algren shakes off the memory as harsh SOUNDS from outside draw him to
the window.
.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
DAY
As the sounds of training resume outside, Algren explores the house.
He comes upon Higen and Toshiie playing with the red ball. They are
embarrassed to encounter him alone. There's a moment of suspension, and
then Higen throws the ball to Algren.
Algren looks back and forth between the two boys, fixes his gaze on Higen
but throw the ball to Toshiie, causing both boys to laugh and run awa y.
Algren walks on.
SMALL ROOM
DAY
Algren opens a sliding shojii screen and discovers a small room that has been
made into a kind of shrine.
Cand1es and incense burn, a small Buddha sits on a dais, and Algren's eyes
are drawn to what seems like an apparition standing in the corner.
The BRIGHT RED ARMOR of the warrior Algren killed in the fog, is held
upright by an unseen stand. It is almost as if the dead warrior himself is
swing back at him.
Algren senses someone behind him and turns. The woman is standing across
the hall. Their eyes meet. She turn, and walks away.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
DAY
Algren it now well enough to kneel at the table with the others. Taka treats
him with utter politeness and dignity. He watches her intently, seeking any
sign of the animosity he's certain she must feel.
She hands him a bowl of rice.
ALGREN
(smiling politely)
You hope I choke on it, don't you?
She bows, uncomprehending.
ALGREN
You want to poison it and watch me fall over
the table and foam at the mouth.
Yoritomo bows in response to Algren's new willingness to communicate.
YORITOMO
(to Taka, subtitles)
I promise I'll make him take a bath.
TAKA
(subtitles)
Soon. Please.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
EVENING
Algren lies painfully on a mat, his eyes unfocused.
A sudden flash of memory:
The lovel y blond woman, tears in her eyes, looks up to Algren's shining face,
the epaulets on his crisp officer's, uniform gleaming gold in the sun.
The reverie is broken.
As Taka kneels to swab the cuts on his face. He stares at her darkly.
ALGREN
Who are you people anywa y?
She makes no attempt to understand or respond.
ALGREN
You have no God, you have no mercy, you don't
even have any fucking walls. Your walls are
made of paper, what's the matter with you?
She pushes his head aside so she can attend to his neck.
ALGREN
This man tries to kill me and I've done nothing
to him, and you, I kill your husband and you act
like, what? Like I'm a guest in your house.
What is wrong with you?
This last said so intensely that she glances at him before picking up a bowl
of soup she had brought for him, and bringing it to his lips...
ALGREN
Do you have a soul at all?
46.
He stares at her for a moment, then knocks the soup out of her blinds.
Her eyes FLASH for one moment, before resuming their usual mildness.
But that flash is enough to satisfy him, and he calms down. She walks away.
He sighs, exhausted, only to see her approach again with a new bowl. Their
eyes meet, and hold for a moment. She does have a soul. He takes a sip.
SHINTO SHRINE
DAY
Algren is led past baldheaded monks into an ancient shrine. Katsumoto
kneels before a small altar. He doesn't seem aware that Algren is present.
KATSUMOTO
Ujio is teaching you the wa y of the Japanese sword.
ALGREN
Is that what he's doing?
KATSUMOTO
At what age did you become I soldier?
ALGREN
Nineteen.
KA TSUMOTO
To fight in your American civil war.
ALGREN
Yes.
KA TSUMOTO
Tell me about that war'.
ALGREN
What about it?
KATSUMOTO
Everything.
ALGREN
Everything about the civil war?
Katsumoto sits impassively, staring at the altar.
ALGREN
That would take a year.
KATSUMOTO
You have pressing business elsewhere?
Shaking his head, Algren sits down.
47.
ALGREN
The civil war began on April 12. 1861 when the
rebs attacked Fort Sumter. Well, actually, it
probabl y began three years earlier when the
Supreme Court decided a runaway slave had to
be returned to his master
DISOLVE TO:
The TWO OF THEM, hours later--
ALGREN
--and Pickett says he wants to do it, over
Longstreet's objections and Lee doesn't know
what to think, but he lets him. So 15,000 men
go up that hill. And most of them die.
KATSUMOTO
Was that wise?
ALGREN
No, it was stupid.
KATSUMOTO
Why?
ALGREN
The point of a battle is to win, or at least have
enough men survive to fight another day.
KATSUMOTO
You did not try to survive when we took you
prisoner.
Algren eyes him, frustrated.
ALGREN
What do you want from me?
KATSUMOTO
What do you want for yourself?
ALGREN
You know they're not going to ransom me.
KATSUMOTO
We have little use for money.
48.
ALGREN
(mounting fury)
Then what are you doing, why are you asking me
these questions, what is going on here?
KATSUMOTO
The snows will melt in May, and the passes will
open, and the events of the world will unfold.
Until that time, you are here.
(smiles)
I enjoyed this conversation in your English. I
hope you will honor me with more tomorrow.
Katsumoto stands, bows, and leaves.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
DAY
Young Toshiie sits near Algren. He labors over a scroll with a brush, the
gentle brush strokes are hypnotic as they sweep across the rice paper.
Algren tries to indicate that he would like pen and paper for himself. Toshiie
gives him what he asks. Algren begins to write:
ALGREN (V.O.)
Day unknown, month unknown, 1876. I continue
to live among these strange people.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
NIGHT
Algren now kneels at the table with the rest of the family as they eat. He is
in considerable pain from the rigors of training. He tries to roll the stiffness
out of his neck, when be notices that Higen it imitating him. Toshiie laughs.
49.
ALGREN (V.O.)
They seem to value nothing more than their
families, and yet they kill defenseless wounded
men without a shade of remorse..
Yoritomo sternly tells Higen not to make fun of their guest. Yoritomo
apologizes to Algren, who shakes his head unnecessary.
ALGREN
.
Raisu? [Rice?]
They stop, shocked. He has spoken!
Yoritomo calls for Taka to serve him more rice, then begins yammering
enthusiastically in Japanese. Algren holds up his hand.
ALGREN
Not so fast Ko...toba? [Words?]
(bolds up chopsticks)
What is this?
YORITOMO
Hashi.
ALGREN
Hashi.
Yoritomo is hysterical with glee now.
YORITOMO
Hail!
The boys are suddenly dervishes, pulling various objects from the table and around the room, shouting the
Japanese words for each.
Algren shakes his head, and smiles for the first time in this stor y.
Yoritomo manages to quiet the boys. He points to himself.
YORITOMO
Yoritomo.
ALGREN
(points to himself)
Algren.
YORITOMO
All-gren.
Algren nods, and the boys start screaming "All-gren!"
YORITOMO
(points to each in rum)
Higen. Toshiie. Taka.
50.
ALGREN
(bowing)
Higen. Toshiie.
(turns to Taka)
Taka.
She meets his eyes for the slightest moment, then looks down and walks away.
KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE
NIGHT
Katsumoto is arranging flowers. Algren watches in confusion, as this
powerful lord goes about doing something so feminine and delicate. Finally:
KATSUMOTO
The parliament of your country has two houses.
Why is that?
ALGREN
To keep either one from being too powerful.
KATSUMOTO
Does not a people need a powerful ruler to
protect them?
ALGREN
We believe the opposite.
Katsumoto thinks about this.
ALGREN
I have a question. How do you come to speak
English?
KATSUMOTO
Members of the Council were required to study
............
it. ........Yes, I was a member of the government.
I helped restore the Emperor to the throne.
ALGREN
So that Japan could have a powerful ruler to
protect it.
Katsumoto understands Algren's irony, but doesn't smile.
ALGREN
And now you must hate him for what he's done.
KATSUMOTO
He is my blood. I serve him with my life.
ALGREN
By fighting his army?
Katsumoto looks at A1gren.
51.
KATSUMOTO
I do not fight the emperor. I fight those who
seek to influence him, those who betray the soul
of my country.
He slowl y draws his long samurai sword, and places it next to the flowers on the table in front of him.
KA TSUMOTO
The Emperor gave this blade to my ancestors
400 years ago. It has been used only to defend his
sacred honor.
Katsumoto hands the sword to Algren. Algren studies it.
KATSMUOTO
It takes many years to make a sword. It is a holy
Act. A samurai's sword is his soul.
ALGREN
This sword is flawed. What is this uneven line
near the edge?
Katsumoto smiles at Algren's ignorance.
KATSUMOTO
One man is flexible and compromises too much
to avoid conflict. Another man is so fierce he
wins ever y battle, but so rigid he can never know
peace. A man who knows both is the perfect
warrior. The lame is true of a blade .. one steel
bends, and the other cuts. And where they
meet is never perfect Hold the blade up. .
Algren holds the sword, cutting edge up. Katsumoto takes a silk cloth and drops it. It gently billows down -- and
splits evenly on the edge.
KATSUMOTO
Some believe a blade is thirsty until it tastes the
blood of its enemy.
Algren hands the sword back. Suddenly, Katsumoto swings the sword, cleanly splitting the table in two.
Silence.
ALGREN
The crew at Winchester can produce one rifle ever y
seven minutes.
KA TSUMOTO
We gave up firearms two hundred years ago. It
takes no courage to kill. A man from half a mile
awa y. You must look into the eyes of your enemy
to know who you have killed.
52.
ALGREN
I'm not sure an artillery officer would agree.
KATSUMOTO
Do you?
ALGREN
I think all killing's a filthy business.
KATSUMO
TO Taking a man's life is
nothing. It is his honor you
can never take awa y.
ALGREN
In other words you have no respect for human life.
KA TSUMOTO
(fierce) .
What do you know of human life? You come here to kill for
money Where is your family? Where is your wife, your sons?
What is your legacy?
ALGREN
(undaunted)
And what is yours? To rebel against the future? I fought the
South in our civil war. Their leaders believed they were fighting
for "honor" just as you do. And their people died by the thousands!
Katsumoto simply looks at him.
ALGREN
And my wife is dead.
KATSUMOTO
Mine, too.
They look at each other. Some unexpected recognition has taken place.
KATSUMOTO
Tomorrow we will discuss your country's wish for
dominance in the..."Far East."
ALGREN
...I look forward to it.
Algren turns to go.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
NIGHT
Algren is asleep. And then we note that the ground is vibrating .. he slides
across his mat .- wakes with a start
An unholy rumbling-
Algren bolts up ... just as a paper wall rips open, the wooden framework to the room splits
and the roof collapses--
An earthquake. Common for this part of Japan.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
DAYS LATER
Algren works with Yoritomo, binding the wooden framework. Higen prepares
the paper walls nearby. He does this with considerable skill.
Taka is getting water from a rain barrel she observes Algren helping
rebuild her home. Yoritomo is working nearby.
Algren's Japanese is rough but improving:
ALGREN
(in Japanese, subtitles)
Would last longer ... if stone.
YORITOMO
(subtitles)
No. House fall. House go back easy with wood.
Algren shakes his head. Taka appears with cups of water. Algren looks at her
For the first rime, she holds his gaze.
Taka is carrying in a huge lack of rice. Algren goes to help her.
TAKA
(subtitles)
No, please.
ALGREN
(insistent)
Hai.
He carries the rice for her into the pantry area.
TAKA
(subtitles)
Japanese men do not help with this.
ALGREN
(subtitles)
I know.
She looks at him, a little surprised.
ALGREN
(subtitles)
I am not Japanese.
In spite of herself, she smiles a little. There is an awkward moment.
ALGREN
(subtitles)
1... didn't know he was your husband.
TAKA
(struck; subtitles)
He did his duty. You did your duty.
ALGREN
(subtitles)
And you do yours.
TAKA
(softl y)
Hai.
They look at each other for a long moment. She starts to move, but he stops
her. They are close enough to smell each other's hair, to feel the warmth of
the other's breath. She looks up at him, pleading with her eyes not to take this any further.
60.
He lets her go.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
NIGHT
Algren writes on parchment by the light of an oil lamp.
ALGREN (V.O.)
April 13, 1877. Tomorrow we return to
civilization. As eager as I am to be among my
own kind, I confess to a curious reluctance.
KATSUMOTO'S RQOM
NIGHT
Algren is escorted in. Katsumoto kneels at a table. Preparing the traditional Japanese tea ceremony.
KATSUMOTO
Sit, Captain.
Algren sits. By now he has learned how to sit on the ground. Katsumoto begins the exacting, delicate and
precise tea ceremony.
KATSUMOTO
Do you drink tea?
ALGREN
I've had little else for some time...
Katsumoto continues with the tea ceremony.
ALGREN
How's your poem coming?
KATSUMOTO
I am having trouble. The truth is I am not a very
good poet.
(Algren smiles)
Do you know wh y you were sent here? To
Yoshino.
ALGREN
To protect the railroad.
.
KATSUMOTO
Why is the railroad here?
ALGREN
So Tokyo can control the whole country.
64.
KATSUMOTO
You have seen my province. All mountains.
Far from Tokyo. Yet the rail line must come
here?
Katsumoto tosses a tiny bit of coal on the simmering brazier on the table. Algren watches carefully.
ALGREN
You have something they want
KATSUMOTO
What do they want in my mountains?
ALGREN
Minerals ... Gold.
KA TSUMOTO
(smiles)
There is no gold in Japan.
Katsumoto gently blows on the coal brazier. The coal flares a bit.
ALGREN
Coal?
(Katsumoto looks at him)
For steamships.
KA TSUMOTO
And why would steamships be so important?
ALGREN
...China.
Katsumoto looks up at him. Impressed.
KATSUMOTO
Japan has nothing. China has ever ything.
ALGREN
Mine the coal to create a way station for the trip to
China ... Freeze the Europeans out and Japan and
America have a monopol y on the China trade.
KATSUMOTO
Add to this the Omura Zaibatsu. You know the
Zaibatus?
ALGREN
The wealthy families.
65.
KATSUMOTO
As patron of the railroad, Omura owns all land within
four hundred feet of ever y new rail line. As my country
grows, so will his wealth.
(looks at him)
This is why you are fighting.
Katsumoto completes the tea ceremony. He pours a cup for Algren. Bows his head and offers it to him.
ALGREN
And you will tell the emperor to stop them?
KATSUMOTO
I do not tell the emperor what to do.
ALGREN
Then what do you hope to accomplish?
Katsumoto looks at Algren, the slightest gleam in his eye.
KATSUMOTO
Will you return to America?
Algren watches him -- why didn't Katsumoto answer?
ALGREN
...I have a job here.
KATSUMOTO
You should return to your home.
ALGREN
Why?
KATSUMOTO
Because I do not wish you to be m y enemy again.
Katsumoto returns to his poem, he does not look up.
KATSUMOTO
Go home Captain ... Anshinritsumai. I wish you peace.
Algren waits but Katsumoto just continues to work on his poem.
INN -- KATSUMOTO'S ROOM
NIGHT
Silence.
67.
Katsumoto cannot sleep. He stares out the window at a nightingale.
INN--UJIO'S ROOM
NIGHT
Silence.
Ujio sits in his room. He is unblinking. Alert. Swords at the ready.
INN  ALGREN'S ROOM
NIGHT
Silence.
Algren cannot sleep either. He sits leaning against a wall. Thinking.
INN -- MAIN HALL
NIGHT
Silence.
Yoritomo drinks tea with Nakao, the huge martial arts master.
OUTSIDE KATSUMOTO'S ROOM
NIGHT
A guard stands sentinel. Above his head, unbeknownst to him, two Ninjas descend on ropes.
One of them swings a long chain - to which I barbed-knife is attached.
As it lodges in the guard's chest, the second Ninja swings down just in time to catch the dead guard,
silently, before his body hits the ground.
INN -- KATSUMQTO'S ROOM
NIGHT
Silence.
Katsumoto lies in bed listening to the night bird. It stops singing. Katsumoto smiles sadly. He
decides to give up on sleep, leans forward to rise.
This act saves his life.
For when the Ninjas come, they come all at once--
A Ninja suddenly comes TEARING STRAIGHT THROUGH THE PAPER WALL, his sword
slashing down .- just missing Katsumoto.
Katsumoto calls out an alarm, diving and rolling across the floor for his sword. He instantly
kills one Ninja using his steel-tipped "war fan" to slash his attackers throat. Another smashes
in through the window.
INN -- MAIN H ALL
NIGHT
Ninjas EXPLODE into the main hall. Samurai who come out of their rooms are cut down by a
variety of weapons -- one takes a throwing star in the face, others are felled by the traditional
ninja-to, short swords ideal for fighting in confined spaces, chain-knives, nun-chaka and others.
68.
More Ninjas drop from the rafters on ropes.
INN -- ALGREN'S ROOM
NIGHT
A Ninja SMASHES through the paper wall -- Algren grabs the nearest object, a low tea table.
and swings it at his head. The Ninja dodges the blow and slices at Algren with short-sword.
Algren barely avoids the blow by ducking behind a post as the sword LODGES
deep in the wood. Algren flings himself, bodily, at his attacker.
INN-- MAIN HALL
NIGHT
Ninja throwing stars spin across the room, killing a samurai.
Yoritomo emerges from his room, readying his bow, but the dead samurai falls back
blocking his wa y. From behind the rice wall, Yoritomo lets fly an arrow without even
looking.
It passes THROUGH the wall, killing the Ninja on the opposite balcony.
INN-- FIRST FLOOR
NIGHT
Ujio screams a war cry and begins to battle his way up the stairs. With breathtaking moves, he slashes
hands and limbs, forcing the Ninja back.
Nakao fights his wa y up beside him, desperately trying to reach Katsumoto's room. Using
only his bare hands he catches a Ninja's wrist and hurls him over the railing.
INN -- ALGREN'S ROOM
NIGHT
Algren and the Ninja are in a death struggle, kneeing, gouging, butting. They awkwardly smash
through a paper wall into the next room.
INN -- KATSUMOTO'S ROOM
NIGHT
Katsumoto wields his long sword in one hand and his short sword in the other. It is the first time
we have seen him in action and his movements are both beautiful and deadly.
But more Ninjas are pouring in through the window, threatening to overwhelm him.
INN -- ALGREN'S ROOM
NIGHT
Rolling on the ground, Algren manages to grab a chopstick and STAB his adversary through the eye.
He picks up the fallen short sword and steps out into the hall.
ARROWS whiz past, thudding into the wall beside his head.
INN-- KATSUMOTO'S ROOM
NIGHT
Katsumoto, breathing heavily, his kimono shredded and bloody, is fending off the Ninjas' increasingly
savage attacks as Algren enters.
Algren SCREAMS, distracting them just long enough for Katsumoto to take advantage and kill one.
69.
Then, just as a Ninja it about to kill Algren, Katsumoto FLINGS his short sword ... it pin-wheels across the
room, hitting Algren's attacker in the chest.
Without missing a beat, Algren pulls the short sword from the dying Ninja's chest and uses it to stab
another Ninja who, thinking Algren defenseless, has launched an attack.
INN -- MAIN HALL
NIGHT
Ujio and Nakao are back to back, a perfect fighting machine as they fight their wa y to
Katsumoto's rescue. They battle Ninjas wielding lethal kusarigamas, the Ninjas swing chains,
the attached blades slice the air--Nakao catches the chains and flinging the Ninja
over the balcony.
YORITOMO'S ROOM
NIGHT
Yoritomo is pinned down. Darts and throwing stars shred the rice paper wall above him. He
picks off another Ninja before changing his position.
INN-- KATSUMOTO'S ROOM
NIGHT
The blazing sword battle continues.
Algren throws a beautiful painted standing-screen in front of an attacking Ninja,
momentarily confusing him. Then he stabs THROUGH THE SCREEN -as a blood-
stain SPREADS across the pastoral painting.
But another Ninja catches Algren off-guard and slices at him with his short sword. As
Algren lifts his sword to parry the blow, HIS LITILE FINGER IS CHOPPED OFF.
He drops the sword, momentarily defenseless.
Across the hallway
Yoritomo has been watching the shadowpla y on the rice-paper walls.
Algren's attacker raises his blade to deliver the death blow.
In Katsumoto's room
Algren flinches involuntarily beneath the raised blade. Suddenly the Ninja JACKKNIFES
as if punched by an unseen hand. As he spins, dead, to the ground, we SEE an ARROW
lodged bet ween his shoulder blades. Yoritomo has FIRED blindly, through the wall 
killing Algren's attacker.
Nearby, a Ninja hurls a throwing star at Katsumoto. With blind instinct Katsumoto
turns and takes the blade in the meat of his arm.
Algren, meanwhile, has ripped the sleeve of his kimono into a tourniquet for his maimed hand.
He uses the rest of the fabric TO TIE HIS HAND TO HIS SWORD before launching himself
back into the fray -- slicing an attacker just as he is about to impale Katsumoto.
Together, he and Katsumoto force the last two Ninjas through a paper wall to the next room.
They fight all the wa y through that room and BLAST through another paper wall to the next.
70.
INN  STAIRWAY
NIGHT
The battle continues unabated on the stairs -- the Ninjas spring for position with
incredible grace --perching and fighting on banisters, leaping from one level to the next.
It is a mayhem of flashing swords and flailing limbs and flyi ng arrows and spinning Ninja stars.
Sprays of blood splatter against the white rice paper walls.
Some of the fighting is less than elegant. Men bite and wrestle and gouge to
survive in close quarters.
All of them arc bloody and sweat y and dirty and tired, heaving for breath, their skin flayed
open, their kimonos ripped, their hands and arms and faces blood-stained.
But more samurai reinforcements follow Ujio up the stairs: Together with Yoritomo
and Nakao, they have begun to gain the upper hand.
Ujio flings both his swords through the air -- killing two Ninjas -- and dives to
fight others - his martial arts skills are dazzling.
Algren and Katsumoto are fighting sidc by side
And we cut to --
INN  STAIRWAY
NIGHT
Later. The battle is over.
Ninja and samurai corpses litter the inn.
We slowl y move up the long stairwa y from the bottom...
Yoritomo pulls a Ninja star from Nakao's_shou1der. Then one from his own.
We move up another level, past more bodies...
Ujio moves through the Ninjas. Making sure they are dead. Before sheathing
his sword, he angrily FLICKS it at the rice paper wall, spattering it with the bloody spray.
Katsumoto wipes his sword on a nearby corpse, replaces it in its sheath. He sits beside
Algren on a stair. Both men are exhausted. Bloodied. Alive.
A long beat as we watch the two warriors.
Slow fade to...
71.
WAREHOUSE
DAY
The cavernous warehouse piled high with huge crates.
75.
BAGLEY
As soon as they sign the agreement, they're obligated
to buy the entire weapons package, from Colt revol vers
to Ha1liwell twelve-pounders. Plus this particular item
you might recognize.
A few stevedores tear open one of the crates. Algren hides his astonishment:
A Gatling Gun is revealed.
BAGLEY
They've been calibrated to fire 200 rounds a minute,
The new copper cartridges cut down on jamming.
Algren closes his eyes, trying to keep his memories at bay.
OFFICES OF THE OMURA ZAIBATSU
DAY
Aside from the occasional bit of Japanese decor, this could be a buzzing Wall Street firm.
Telegraph operators click away. Accountants use adding machines. Secretaries
use pneumatic tubes to send documents back and forth. Engineers plot out
railway lines. All are dressed in Western clothes.
Algren, Colonel Bagley, and Ambassador Swanbeck enter.
AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
(to Algren)
If he asks, you can talk about ordnance and tactics.
But remember, this has to do with a lot more than
just weapons.
76.
An anteroom holds waiting delegations from the various European powers.
A babel of language. ... French ...Dutch ...Russian ...German.
A pretty American secretary looks up from her desk.
SECRETARY
Ambassador Swanbeck, if you'll follow me.
Some of the delegates arc craning forward, watching Algren and the others hungrily
as they head into the final office.
OMURA'S OFFICE
DAY
Omura stands like an industrial titan before large picture windows offering a dramatic view of Tokyo.
The only decoration in the room is an enormous Caravaggio.
OMURA
Please, sit down, gentlemen.
Omura removes a gold cigarette case and lights up. Cigarettes are the newest Western fad
Sweeping Japan.
OMURA
(re: cigarette case)
A gift from Czar Alexander... Captain Algren,. it seems
you have endured your captivity with little ill-effect.
ALGREN
Yes, sir.
OMURA
He's an extraordinary man, isn't he?
ALGREN
He is samurai.
Omura gazes at him. Slowl y takes I puff from his cigarette.
AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
Mr. Omura, my people have been drawing up the documents
we discussed. I have a draft--
OMURA
We're not quite ready to announce the treaty, Ambassador.
AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
Excuse me?
OMURA
The Emperor is...sentimental. Katsumoto was his old mentor--
he is not eager to offend him. It will take I few more days.
77.
AMBASSJ\DOR SW ANBECK
How many da ys is " a few?"
OMURA
I assure you the Samurai will not stand in the
wa y of our agreement. You are prepared to make deliver y?
AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
Soon as your emperor signs on the dotted line.
OMURA
Captain Algren you are the expert. Will this array of
ordnance be sufficient?
ALGREN
Depends on what you're trying to accomplish.
OMURA
I want my country to take its place as a modern power.
ALGREN
Then they will set you well on your way.
OMURA
I am pleased.
AMDASSADOR SW ANBECK
Mr. Omura, you assured us you had the influence
with your emperor to make this deal come to
pass. With all due respect perhaps there is someone
else we should be speaking to.
OMURA
With all due respect, Ambassador, perhaps there is
someone else we should be speaking to, for instance the
French. Or the English. Or any of the legations waiting
in the next room.
Ambassador Swan beck stands swallowing his rage.
AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
Yes, we1l, we look forward to hearing from you.
OMURA
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
They start to go.
OMURA
Captain Algren, perhaps you can stay a moment
And tell me of your experiences in our rebellious
provinces.
Bagley looks at Algren. Do as he asks. He leaves A1gren alone with Omura.
78.
OMURA
Cigarette?
ALGREN
Thank you.
Omura lights his cigarette. A moment as he takes Algren's measure.
OMURA
You fought bravely on behalf of our army--
against the rebel Katsumoto.
Algren says nothing.
.
OMURA
And yet you helped save his life when attacked
by the Ninja.
ALGREN
My role was much less significant than you may have heard.
OMURA
Tell me about your role in Katsumoto's plans.
ALGREN
I have none.
OMURA
And your sympathies?
ALGREN
Again, I have none.
OMURA
I know you have little sympathy for Colonel Bagley.
ALGREN
He is.... unsympathetic.
Omura smiles.
OMURA
I thought it was we who are inscrutable.
Now it is Algren who smiles.
OMURA
You have gained important knowledge of Katsumoto's
province, his army, and his rebellion. This is extremely
valuable to me.
He watches Algren to see how this lands.
79.
OMURA
You also possess significant knowledge of m y army, my
weaponry, and my plans. This is extremely va1uable to
Katsumoto.
ALGREN
Again, you flatter me.
OMURA
No. I am a businessman. I recognize what is valuable.
And I buy it.
(looks at him)
In this case, I value your loyalt y.
Algren considers the implications of what Omura is saying.
ALGREN
I didn't know loyalt y was something that could be sold.
OMURA
Then perhaps you will give it, as a token of future
friendship - for which, as a friend, I would be in your debt.
ALGREN
(stands)
Then I will consider it.
OMURA
And I will be grateful.

Algren is in a shipping office. A clerk consults his schedule of departure.
CLERK
All righteee, the ANDREW JACKSON leaves tomorrow 
if you want a steamship you'll have to wait six weeks.
(Algren is silent)
Gets ya to Frisco by the 28th. 14 dollars for a
private cabin, 8 for a shared or 3 for a lower berth.
What can I put you down for?
Algren is silent, concentrating on a calendar hanging behind the clerk. It
features a beautiful Hiroshigi watercolor of mountains.
CLERK
Sir..?
ALGREN
(after a moment)
Private cabin.
80.
KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE
DUSK
Ujio kneels with Yoritomo, dressing the wounds on his head.
Graham sits across the room talking quietly to the mammoth Nakao, taking
notes in a small notebook. Nakao has been brutally shorn of his top knot
as well. His shame is apparent.
KATSUMOTO'S CHAMBER
DUSK
Servants he1p dress Katsumoto in his exacting samurai wardrobe as Algren is ushered in.
KATSUMOTO
Captain, I had not thought to see you again.
82.
ALGREN
I'm leaving tomorrow. But before I go I need to
tell you what's going on here.
KATSUMOTO
You mean the Gatling Guns and the howitzers,
is that how you sa y it?
ALGREN
They're about to close a trade agreement that
will bring this country more weapons than
you can imagine.
KATSUMOTO
Yes, if the emperor agrees - but Omura knows
the Emperor must be convinced there is cause to
need those weapons before be will sign.
ALGREN
(realizing)
And you are to be the cause...
KATSUMOTO
Elegant, isn't it? Omura passes laws sure to cause
a samurai revolt, creating a need for the weapons.
The Emperor sees that the weapons are needed
so he agrees to the entire treaty, giving your
country what it wants and the Omura Zaibatsu
what it wants. And my country is sold to yours.
As Katsumoto dresses, Algren notes that Katsumoto's body it at battleground
of old scars, so like his own.
KA TSUMOTO
Today the Council passed two edicts. The first called for
the elimination of our traditional topknots.
ALGREN
I know.
KATSUMOTO
The second banned the wearing of sword.
Algren stops. He knows what swords mean to the samurai.
KATSUMOTO
(re: his swords)
Hand them to me, will you?
Algren picks up Katsumoto's two swords. Looks at him deeply.
ALGREN
If you do this, they will kill you.
83.
KA TSUMOTO
I am hard to kill.
ALGREN
You don't know what their weapons can do. All
your men butchered ... Just for pride.
KATSUMOTO
Not for pride. For the emperor.
ALGREN
But the emperor is the one signing the agreement.
KATSUMOTO
He has not signed it yet.
He holds out Katsumoto's two samurai swords.
ALGREN
Is it worth it? ... just for these,
KATSUMOTO
I cannot live without my soul ... Can you?
They regard each other.
COUNCIL OF STATE CHAMBER
NIGHT
The Council of State meets in an august chamber. Many of the Council
members wear Western clothes. Cigarette smoke billows.
The young Emperor sits on a dais off to the side, as befits his
ceremonial role in the proceedings.
Omura is speaking ... be stops ... looking at something ... all the Council members turn ... and gape.
Katsumoto strides into the chamber, his swords proudly displayed.
OMURA
(subtitled)
Minister Katsumoto, you honor us.
84.
KATSUMOTO
(subtitled)
It is my honor to join again the men who are leading
Japan into her glorious future.
OMURA
(subtitled)
You arc perhaps unaware of this Council's edict
regarding the wearing of swords?
KATSUMOTO
(subtitled)
I read ever y edict with singular attention.
OMURA
(subtitled)
Yet you would bring weapons into this chamber?
KATSUMOTO
(subtitled)
This chamber was protected by m y sword for four hundred
years--
OMURA
(interrupting, subtitled)
We need no protection... We are a nation of laws now.
KATSUMOTO
(calm, subtitled) .
We are a nation of whores. Selling ourselves to our Western
"allies."
Katsumoto slowl y looks around at the Members of the Council, but his words are addressed
to the Emperor.
KATSUMOTO
(subtitled)
Does Japan no longer need its patriots?
Omura speaks with quiet conviction and honesty.
OMURA
(subtitled)
Who is the patriot? The man who would keep his
country trapped in the past, or the man who would help
his people into the future?
KATSUMOTO
(subtitled)
A future with no honor,
OMURA
(subtitled)
Honor means less to me than feeding our children. And
teaching them. And giving them modern medicine so
they will live.
.
85.
KATSUMOTO
And lining your own pockets in the process.
They stare at one another with barely concealed hostility.
OMURA
(subtitled)
Minister Katsumoto, it is with great regret that I ask
you to remove your sword, as this body has declared
in its edict.
Katsumoto's hand closes on his sword hilt
KATSUMOTO
This sword serves the emperor, and only he can
command me to remove it.
Katsumoto looks to the Emperor, as murmurs fill the room.
OMURA
(quickly)
Ah, but it is our tradition that the Emperor's voice is
too pure and great to be heard in such worldly
circumstance as the Council of State.
One last time, Katsumoto meets the Emperor's eye.
KATSUMOTO
Then, with great regret, I must refuse to give up my
sword.
Omura looks to his associates, and a silent decision is made.
OMURA
Minister Katsumoto, I must invite you to
accompany our soldiers to Himeji Castle, where
you will be our honored guest. I think you will
find the surroundings there quite harmonious.
Guards with Mauser rifles move into position around Katsumoto. He turns to
the other Council members. Looks at them.
KA TSUMOTO
(subtitled)
Brothers ... One day you will know what you have done
and feel what I never will ... shame.
Omura nods to the guards. The guards lead Katsumoto out.
86.
CASTLE  TOWER
NIGHT
Two guards arc: standing at attention in a dank corridor high in one of the
towers of the castle. Cell doors line the corridor.
Katsumoto's samurai swords lean against the wall next to them.
CASTLE  CELL
NIGHT
Katsumoto kneels in a cramped cell. A sound draws his attention. He rises
and looks out a barred window.
Bel ow he sees two rickshaws moving up the twisting road to the castle.
RICKSHAW
NIGHT
Algren and Bagley, in formal dress uniforms, sit in one of the rickshaws.
Bagley looks him over.
BAGLEY
Oughtta shave more often, Algren. Becomes you.
ALGREN
Thought I would follow the Japanese fashion.
BAGLEY
...Heard you were leaving, actually?
ALGREN
Why would I do that? Omura wants me to train his
personal guard.
BAGLEY
Certainly seems obsessed by you. Why do you
think that is?
90.
ALGREN
Could it be my nose isn't permanently lodged up
his ass?
Bagley shakes his bead, turns away. Algren stares up at the looming aide.
CASTLE  CORRIDOR
NIGHT
The servant leads Algren through a corridor, head bowed.
Then, stil1 puffing on his cigar, Algren taps the servant on the back, and as
the man turns, decks him. The servant falls.
Algren flicks hit cigar out onto the sloping roof. We FOLLOW the
BURNING EMBER as it rolls off the roof and lands at the feet of TWO
CURIOUS GUARDS.
CASTLE APPROACH
NIGHT
The three samurai and Graham race up the winding parapets.
Three GUARDS round a corner. Swords flash as Ujio and Nakao dispatch
them without even slowing. They race on, Graham laboring to keep up.
92.
CASTLE KEEP
NIGHT
Algren rounds a corner--
Ujio, Yoritomo, Nakao, and Graham are moving toward him.
ALGREN
This wa y...
Clearly, this has all been Algren's plan. They move up a stairwa y.
CASTLE KEEP (SECOND FLOOR)
NIGHT
The three guards are still standing at attention outside Katsumoto's cell.
His swords are next to them.
Algren keeps the others out of sight and lowers his head to whisper with
Ujio. Ujio nods, then walks into sight and calmly approaches the guards.
Still hidden, Algren gestures for the others remain to silent. After a
moment, he gestures that they can proceed.
Algren and the others round the comer to discover the bloody remains of
the three guards - whom Ujio has dispatched in absolute silence. They unlock
the cell.
CASTLE  CELL
FOLLOWING
Katsumoto is shocked to see Algren enter. Algren tosses him his swords.
ALGREN
How's the poem coming?
KATSUMOTO
The ending is proving difficult.
CASTLE -- RECEPTION CHAMBER
NIGHT
Omura glances up from the documents.
OMURA
What has become of Captain Algren?
CASTLE  CORRIDOR
NIGHT
Algren, Katsumoto, and the others race through an upper corridor.
KATSUMOTO
(re:Graham)
Who is this?
ALGREN
Name's Simon Graham. Wants to write a book
about you.
93.
GRAHAM
An honor. I have followed your activities with
great interest. I think the European public
would be fascinated by a book about your
adventures.
KATSUMOTO
Not a book. A play!
Suddenly, from below, the raised voices of guards. They hurry a wa y.
CASTLE  STAIRS
NIGHT
Guards carrying pikes race up the stairs--
CASTLE  CORRIDOR
NIGHT
Algren and the others are moving swiftl y down a stone corridor.
The sound of the approaching guards is growing louder.
A silent WILD BUNCH moment of preparation as they stride down the
corridor, five abreast.
Algren pulls the cavalry saber from his dress uniform. Katsumoto prepares
his swords. Nakao stretches his huge arms. Yoritomo and Uji o draw their bows.
CASTLE--TIGHT CORRIDOR
FOLLOWING
They stride through a tight, dark stone corridor.
Suddenly, a cadre of Omura guards emerge from the shadows.
Without hesitation, they launch into battle. Algren and Katsumoto wield
their swords. Yoritomo and Ujio fire arrows.
Nakao fights with his hands, dramatic martial arts from the huge man.
94.
But this corridor is just too tight -- it is a sea of combat.. the guards and
our warriors are slammed together --the swords and pikes sending up sparks
in the darkness as they strike the stone walls.
The right corridor echoes with samurai war cries and clanging swords.
Then...
More guards appear.
These guards have rifles.
Rifle blasts thunder --startling strobe-like bursts of light in the darkness --
Algren dives in front of Katsumoto to protect him-
Yoritomo is hit-
He jerks back -- blood--
Ujio fires arrows at the guards with rifles, hitting two -- but more guards with rifles are appearing, bullets
sending showers of debris and ricochets--
Algren sees a stairway leading to a higher 1evel, barks out a command. As Nakao drags
Yoritomo toward the stairs-- the others bolt a heavy SIEGE DOOR 
designed to keep attackers at bay.
CASTLE SIEGE ROOM
NIGHT
Ujio fires arrows through the siege ports -- momentarily delaying the guards
as Algren leads them toward a rear stairs.
REAR STAIRS
NIGHT
Algren starts down -- only to discover MORE GUARDS blocking this means
of escape. He backs out of the wa y just in time as rifle blasts SPLINTER
the wooden stairwe11.
Meanwhile, an EXPLOSION from behind them indicates that the guards
have blown the siege door.
Algren, Graham, and Ujio have no choice but to continue upwards into the
castle keep. Nakao helps the wounded Yoritomo as they climb.
UPPER KEEP
NIGHT
A narrow ladder leads to the final redoubt. They start to climb but Yoritomo
leans against the wall. He is gravely wounded.
ALGREN
Come on.
YORITOMO
(subtitled)
You go, Algren-san. I will stop them.
95.
ALGREN
No--
YORITOMO
...Please.
Yoritomo's determination is absolute. Finally, Algren nods.
Katsumoto moves to Yoritomo, leans in for a few final words, taking his
head and pressing his forehead to Yoritomo's.
Bullets begin ricocheting around them -- Yoritomo looks to Algren:
YORITOMO
(subtitled)
Tell my family.
Algren bows his bead in respect.
Then Algren leads them up the stairs. Ujio fires a final volley, nods with
respect to Yoritomo, then follows the others.
Yoritomo pulls himself erect. Draws his two samurai swords.
A beat. He closes his eyes. Smiles.
Then he opens his eyes and hurls himself down the stairs--
The guards fire hitting Yoritomo - but still he comes -- wading into them
swords flashing -- he is hit again and again -- but still he comes.
It is a glorious death.
UPPER KEEP
CONTINUOUS
Katsumoto and the others share a look. Has he survived?
GUNFIRE begins to pepper the floorboards, bullets whistling past them.
UPPER KEEP
CONTINUOUS
Katsumoto hears the scream. A look of disbelief spreads over his face.
Then the beginnings of a smile. Without a second look, be leaps out the
window. Ujio follows.
Graham shrinks away in fear. Nakao lifts him bodily, throws him out, and then follows.
CASTLE -- RECEPTION CHAMBER
LATER
Omura stands, very calm, smoking a cigarette, listening to the report of his guards.
Colonel Bagley tries to apologize.
BAGLEY
... 1 don't know what to say, sir. I never would
have thought him capable of treason.
OMURA
I would say Captain Algren's acts tonight have
assured our success.
97.
AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
What do you mean?
OMURA
Katsumoto will rejoin his kinsmen. They will fight.
We will destroy them with your new weapons.
BAGLEY
What if he just goes off to the mountains and
becomes a damn sheep-herder or some such?
OMURA
You still do not understand us ... Katsumoto can
do nothing but fight. It is his role in the drama.
He must act out his destiny. He knows it.
AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
You trust a lot in destiny.
OMURA
This story was written years ago. From the first
sight of your warships in our harbor...
(stares out the window)
It is a1l inevitable.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
NIGHT
Algren sits with the family. The boys sit next to their mother.
ALGREN
(subtitles)
... he gave his life to save us. He died bravel y.
TAKA
(subtitles)
Thank you, Algren-San.
99.
HIGEN
(subtitles)
Will you fight the white men?
ALGREN
(subtitles)
If they come here, yes.
HIGEN
(subtitles)
Why?
ALGREN
(subtitles)
Because they come to destroy what I have come to love.
Taka looks at him, moved and surprised. Suddenly, Higen jumps up and
bolts... out of the room. Algren looks to Taka.
TAKA
(subtitles)
The wa y of Samurai is difficult for children. He
misses his father.
ALGREN
And he is angry because I am the cause of that.
She smiles ever so slightly at his obliviousness.
TAKA
No. He it angry because he fears you will die as well.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
FOLLOWING
The gentle flute music from outside drifts in.
One of Yoritomo's beautiful kimonos is elegantly spread on a mat.
TAKA
(subtitles)
If you wear this, it will honor us.
He nods.
She steps to him.
A moment. She gently reaches forward and unbuttons his collar.
A tender, silent scene as she undresses him and carefully wraps him in the
kimono. Her hands move gracefull y around his body, never quite touching
him. His movements are gentle in response.
When he is fully dressed, then are tears in his eyes.
Suddenly, fiercely, they are holding each other.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
MORNING
It is the day of the battle. Algren is buttoning the long coat of his cavalry uniform.
He looks up to see Higen standing in the doorwa y, holding the breast-plate
of his father's armor.
IMPERIAL PALACE -- THRONE
ROOM DAY
Ambassador Swanbeck, Omura, and a retinue of advisors are presenting the
treaty documents for the Emperor's signature. The Emperor sits restively
on his throne.
AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
...will usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity
and cooperation between our two great nations.
A servant comes and whispers into the Emperor's ear.
OMURA
(subtitles)
Highness, if we could just conclude the matter
at hand...
The Emperor ignores Omura, and gestures that the doors to the chamber be opened.
Algren enters with Graham. Algren carries something wrapped in a blanket.
He approaches the Emperor. Kneels and sets the bundle at the Emperor's feet.
Algren remains kneeling with his head bowed. He unwraps the bundle.
117.
It is Katsumoto's long samurai sword.
'The Emperor looks at it.
OMURA
(subtitled)
All your enemies are dead, Enlightened One.
The Emperor continues to look at the sword. He does not look up.
EMPEROR/TRANSLATOR
(to Algren)
You were with him at the end.
ALGREN/TRANSLA TOR
Yes. He asked that I bring you this -- that the
strength of the samurai will be with you alwa ys.
The Emperor rises from his chair and sits on the floor, in the traditional
Japanese fashion, before the sword.
OMURA
(after a moment)
En1ightcned One, we all weep for his loss, but
the future of our country lies in-
The Emperor interrupts him, speaking in English -- to ever yone's surprise.
EMPEROR
My ancestors have ruled Japan for 2,000 years.
And for all that time we have slept. During my
sleep I have dreamed. I dreamed of a unified
Japan. Of a country strong and independent and
modern...
(touches the sword lovingly)
And now we are awake. We have railroads and
cannon and Western clothing. But we cannot
forget who we are. Or where we come from.
The Emperor looks up at the gathered dignitaries.
.
EMPEROR
Ambassador Swanbeck I have concluded that your treaty
is not in the best interests of my people.
AMBASSADOR SWANDECK
Sir, if I may--
EMPEROR
You may not. From this moment on, economic investment
from ever y nation will be considered equally.
118.
Ambassador Swanbeck is stunned.
AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
This is an outrage--
The Emperor gestures. A servant escorts Swanbeck to the exit. Omura takes a step
closer to the Emperor.
OMURA
(subtitled)
Enlightened One, we should discuss this
EMPEROR
(subtitled)
Omura, do you know our northern island?
Omura is confused.
EMPEROR
(subtitled)
There is a small one called Taraku. A rock in the sea.
There is nothing there but crabs who have been known
to tear a sleeping man apart ... I have had a small house
constructed on the island. You will go there now and
await our summons.
OMURA
(subtitled)
Sir...?
EMPEROR
(subtitled)
I hereby seize your family's assets and present them
as my gift to the people.
Omura looks at him, stunned.
EMPEROR
(subtitled)
Further, I have decided to stop the railroad cxpansion
into Yoshino.
OMURA
(subtitled)
Enlightened One
EMPEROR
(subtitled)
You have served your function. I have no more
need of you ... You can conspire with the crabs
now. Remove yourself.
119.
OMURA
(protests, subtitled)
Honored Emperor, I do not know wh y you
disgrace me.
The Emperor finally looks up from the sword.
EMPEROR
(subtitled)
If your shame is too unbearable ... I offer you
this sword.
Omura looks at him for a moment. Then bows tersely and goes.
The Emperor looks at Algren, still kneeling before him.
EMPEROR
(in English again)
The samurai is not a man now. He is an idea.
(a beat)
Tell me how he died.
Algren looks At the Emperor.
ALGREN
I will tell you how he lived.
We slowl y fade as Algren begins to speak...
LECTURE HALL (ENGLAND)
DAY
Graham stands at a lectern on a book tour. A well-dressed audience listens
attentivel y. A banner proclaims, "The Last Samurai," by Simon Graham.
GRAHAM (V.O.)
And in the years to come the Rising Sun of Imperial Japan
would fl y in triumph over Korea, over Russia, even over
China. Nations, like men, it is sometimes said, have
their own destiny
