      crowded restaurant.  Her husband, WILL waves from a table in 
      the back.  He s sweetly handsome with a friendly, open face.

                Oh my God...

                                  REAGAN
                At least you don t have to go to work.

                                  WILL
                  Yeah, raising a human is no work at 
                  all.

                                  REAGAN
                  I just got no sleep last night.  I was 
                up with Amy from 1 to 4.  So that's 
                  like, only three hours.

                                  WILL
                  Well, she and I were up before that, 
                  from like 10 to midnight.  You 
                  probably don't remember that cause you 
                  were asleep.  But I was awake.  Then 
                  when I finally got in the bed, after 
                  dealing with Amy, I couldn't get back 
                to sleep.

                                  REAGAN
                But you WERE asleep when I got up at 1 
                  cause you were snoring.  So...

                                  WILL
                You were probably so groggy from being 
                in such a deep sleep that you didn't 
                see that my eyes were open and I was 
                  indeed, wide awake.

                                  REAGAN
                No, I saw everything cause I was 
                  awake, like all night.  Like totally 
                  awake, with my eyes open, looking 
                  around.  Not sleeping.

                                  WILL
                  Except for when you were asleep.  I 
                  assumed you were asleep because your 
                  eyes were closed in an 'asleep like 
                  fashion' cause I saw you cause I was 
                  awake all night.      UNTITLED EMILY SPIVEY "Pilot" 18.

                  forward to date night.  No work, no 
                  Amy.  Just you and me.  I so need it.

                                  WILL
                Oh man.  You can say that again.  I 
                  sooooo need it.  

                                  REAGAN
                  Yeah, but I like, need it more.  I ve 
                  been working so hard, you know, work 
                AND the baby.  Sooo...

                                  WILL
                  Yeah, but when you ve been up with the 
                  baby as many nights as I have, you 
                  really need an adult night.

                                  REAGAN
                  Ineed an adult night.  It s 
                  like...you know what?  I m sorry.

                                  WILL

                  Your mother and I never changed who we 
                are because of you and your sister, we 
                  just modified it a bit.  It s all 
                  about balance.

                  Ray, you re just on a new journey 
                  right now and you have to be brave.  
                  You ll find your way.

      Reagan thinks on this.  Sips her coffee and then picks up the 
      phone.

                                  REAGAN
                      (she dials her phone)
                Hi this is Reagan, can I speak to 
                  Katie?   Hi Katie, yeah I m taking the 
                  morning off.  I had a...pumping 
                  disaster.

      From the phone we hear a SCREAM.  Reagan hangs up.  Dennis 
      kisses her on the forehead.

                                                                                CUT TO:


      Reagan and Will spend the whole morning with Amy.  

      They have breakfast.  Amy eats scrambled eggs with her 
      fingers.

      They stroll through the park with their dog, Gene.      UNTITLED EMILY SPIVEY "Pilot" 34.


      Amy sleeps in the sunlight.  Reagan and Will sit on swings 
      with coffees.  They are talking, Will says something and they 
      burst into laughter.

                                                                                CUT TO:


      Reagan enters, pumping bag over her shoulder, smiling, 
      greeting everyone with joy and confidence.  Brian approaches.  
      He s shaved his mustache.

                                  REAGAN
                  Hey, Brian, you shaved your  stache!  
                You talked to Anna?

                                  BRIAN
                Oh.  No.  You know, I m not really 
                  sure I ever actually met Anna in 
                  person.  I think she is a dude.  She s 
                    prollyembarrassed to tell me and 
                  that s why she won t return my texts. 
                  I called HJforay girl.

                                  REAGAN
                  HJForay?  On a phone?  So retro.

                                  BRIAN
                  Yeah, a land line even!

                                  REAGAN
                  Hey, Brian thanks.  Will and I got our 
                  date night and it was out of control 
                and embarrassing and fun.  And then we 
                  hung out all morning with Amy.

                                  BRIAN
                  Hey, that s awesome!

                  Okay, you re not gonna start saying 
                  stuff like that...

      Reagan and Will relax on the couch.  

                                  WILL
                You wanna watch a movie?

                                  REAGAN
                  Yes!

      The monitor BLINKS. Amy cries loudly.  They pop to attention. 

                                  WILL
                You know what?  Oh my God, I forgot to 
                get Desitin.

      They ease up off the couch.  Reagan slyly puts her shoes on.

                                  REAGAN
                Oh no!  I ll go get Desitin.  I ll go 
                to Rite Aid.  I ll go right now.

                                  WILL
                  Lemme go.  I'll go.  You just stay 
                  here with Amy and I'll go.

                                  REAGAN
                No, I love drug stores.  I ll go.  You 
                put your feet up.

                        WILLREAGAN
      You hate the drug store.No I don't.

                        WILLREAGAN
      I'll go.No , I'll go.

      They dash for the door.  Reagan slips on a toy and falls, 
      eating it hard.  

                                  WILL
                  Shake it off, Hon!

      Will, holding his shoes, grabs the car keys and is out the 
      door.
