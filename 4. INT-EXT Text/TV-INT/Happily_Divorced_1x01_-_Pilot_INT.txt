                I feel heavy. Probably not the 

                smartest move always meeting my 

                divorce lawyer at Four & Twenty Pies.

                Don t be so negative, he ll sense 

                that. And if you feel fat, what the 

                hell are you wearing that horrendous 

                outfit for?  Men are very visual 

                animals. Didn t you pick up anything

                Someday you will meet someone else... 

                I got a cousin from Guadalajara, Juan 

                Pablo, muy guapo, with very smooth 

                legs.

                                  PETER

                They re called enhancers. Don t they 

                look natural?

                                  FRAN

                Yeah, if you re a Smurf.

      PETER REACTS, THEN CHECKS HIMSELF IN THE MIRROR.

                                  PETER

                Because I wasn t gay then. Men are

                Oh, I completely forgot about that. I 

                can t go. I have a date.

                Well, forgive me for forgetting that 

                we made plans pre my husband coming 

                out of the closet and divorcing me.

                                  PETER

                You have to stop being so dependent on 

                me. We re not married anymore.

                                  PETER

                It has nothing to do with dependency, 

                it s common courtesy.

                                  FRAN

                went as Sonny and Cher. But he thought 

                he should be Cher because he was (air

                Sweetie, I think that ship has sailed.

      THE SERVER-CHRISTIAN ARRIVES WITH A TRAY AS THEY BOTH SIT.

                      (then under her breath)

                And believe me, my bouche could use 

                some amusing.

      THE SERVER PUTS THE PLATE ON THE TABLE. FRAN TAKES ONE, THEN 
      OFFERS THE OTHER TO ELLIOT.

                                  ELLIOT

                No thanks, there s too much going on 

                there. I like single ingredient foods.

                It s just a spoon of guacamole with 

                some black olives.

                You know, I m getting a little tickle 

                in my throat. Are you sure that was an 

                olive?

                I spent the whole night in the

                                  PETER

                Why? What happened? Did that guy do 

                  something to you?

                                  FRAN

                No, I m the one. I almost killed him.

                This is serious! You know how

                Franny, my spin class starts soon and 

                it s the best of Madonna. If I m late, 

                I won t get a bike.

                                  FRAN

                Fine, go to your stupid class. If he 

                sues, the house is in both our names.

      THIS STOPS PETER IN HIS TRACKS.

                                  PETER

                So what happened?

                                  FRAN

                He ate a truffle and it turns out he s 

                deathly allergic.

                                  PETER

                So how s that your fault?

                                  FRAN

                I told him it was a black olive. How 

                the hell was I supposed to know? I 

                don t claim to be the Barefoot 

                  Contessa.

                                  PETER

                Well, did he wear a bracelet that says 

                he s allergic to truffles, or did he 

                mention he s allergic to truffles?

                                  FRAN

                No.   "Episode Title"

                                  PETER

                Then it s not your fault. You can t 

                make someone swallow.
                      (under his breath)

                No matter how much you try.

                                  FRAN

                Ya know you re right. It s not my 

                fault. It s his fault. Sittin  there, 

                hoggin  down truffles willy nilly, 

                like it s his last meal.

                                  PETER

                If I was so allergic to truffles, and 

                I saw a black thing sitting on my 

                food, I d ask the server, I d inquire.

                                  FRAN

                I know, what s he asking me for? Dope!

                                  PETER

                So, you had a lousy date. I can t even 

                get ten digits. Who is this guy 

                anyway, rejecting my wife? 

                                  FRAN

                Why? You don t think he ll call again? 

                 Cause I m not gonna call him. I went 

                with him to the hospital, I made the 

                last gesture.

      DORI WALKS PAST FRAN, ARMS OUT STRETCHED TO HUG PETER.



                How is my gay ex son-in-law?

                                  GLEN

                We know you got spin class, but I 

                didn t want to miss the kick off.

      GLENN PICKS UP THE REMOTE AND TURNS ON THE TV.

                                  PETER

                It s OK.

                You will always be my son. Nobody will 

                ever replace you in my heart. 

      DORI NOTICES ELLIOT AND PUSHES PETER ASIDE.

                                  DORI (CONT D)

                Who is this handsome man?

                You wouldn t by some miracle be Elliot 

                would you? 

                                  ELLIOT

                Yes I am. Nice to meet you.

                                  GLEN

                More important. Do you like football?

                                  FRAN

                He didn t sleep over Ma. What do you 

                take me for?

                                  DORI

                Single! And what the hell are you 

                wearing?

                        at the table)

                Glen, no lox for you, it s too salty!

      DORI CROSSES TO TAKE THE FOOD AWAY FROM GLEN, THEN...



                Elliot, would you care to join us for 

                a lovely spread of pickled herring and 

                smoked white fish chubs?

                                  ELLIOT

                You know, as delicious as that sounds, 

                I have an appointment with the 

                  dermatologist. I found this spot on my 

                hand that has an irregular border.

      FRAN LOOKS AT THE SPOT.

                                  FRAN

                I m sure it s nothing.

                                  PETER

                Let me see. I once had a nothing, that 

                turned out to be a pre-something.

                Oh my God, I ve got a type.

                                  PETER

                No, this is nothing. Probably just a 

                benign Seborrheic Keratoses... very 

                common. If you want to save yourself a 

                visit, I can shoot a picture of it 

                over to my friend who s a derm.

                                  ELLIOT

                No, I really should see my doctor in 

                person. Otherwise, I ll just be 

                anxious all weekend.

                                  PETER

                I hear you. Ya know, I have this 

                really great shrink that s been 

                helping me with my anxiety. I can give 

                you her number.

      FRAN TURNS TO PETER AND GRABS HIS SHIRT.

                      (through gritted teeth)
