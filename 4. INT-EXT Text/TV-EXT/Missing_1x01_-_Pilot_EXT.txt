      RUNNING SHOES beat a steady rhythm on a dirt path.  The 
      terrain may change but the pace never varies.  INTERCUT:


      The rhythm of the music - still not fully apparent to our 
      conscious mind, but building in pace - is relentless.

      Becca is at the back of the car, putting away her sweat 
      soaked towel and water bottle.  She grabs the hatch -

      SLAMS IT.  No explosion.  She walks around to the front, gets 
      into the driver s seat - SLAMS the door.  Again, nothing.  
      CLOSE on her hand as she finds her keys... she slips the key 
      into the ignition... about to turn it, the rhythm building -

      HER CELL PHONE RINGS.  She leaves the key in the ignition 
      without turning it and rifles through her purse to find her 
      phone.  She checks the caller I.D. and answers with a grin.

                                  BECCA
                    Hey, you.


      CAMERA PANS DOWN through bare and jagged branches, the trees 
      girding themselves for the onset of winter.  A well-worn 
      STATION WAGON drives the quiet road.

      Becca at the wheel, gloved hands at ten and two.  Ten years 
      have also changed her, like the colorful trees of Fall gone 
      cold and bare.  She s still beautiful, but something was 
      taken from her that day in the park that never came back. 


      Becca parks at a nice, nondescript suburban home.  She gets 
      out, walks to the back of the car, waving to her neighbor.

                                  BECCA
                    Hi, Colleen.  Roses look good.
                          (calls to the house)
                    Michael!  Come carry!

      Michael, now 18 and handsome, comes bounding down the steps 
      in a MILAN SOCCER JERSEY.  The kid who hated geometry has 
      grown into a young scholar with a passion for learning, a 
      thirst for knowledge, and the self-reliance that comes from 
      being the only child of a single mother.

      He comes around as she pops open the back.  He kisses her 
      hello and then looks in the car.

                                    MICHAEL
                    That s a lot of groceries.

                                  BECCA
                    There was a lot on sale.

      Becca grabs a load, heads for the house.  Michael follows.


      A jumbo jet lands atop a rain-slicked runway.  PULLING BACK, 
      it is revealed that we are --


      Becca unloads a much smaller amount of groceries from the 
      car.  As she carries a bag in, she calls Michael.  She tries 
      to hide any worry in her voice.

                                  BECCA
                    Hi, it s mom.  I haven t heard from 
                    you in a couple of days, so just 
                    checking in.  Love you.


      Becca and Mary help a delivery man load the van.

                                  MARY
                    It wasn t like he made a big deal 
                    out of it.  I reached for his hand, 
                    and he just moved it.  Slid it away 
                    on the table, you know?

      Becca checks her phone for the umpteenth time.

                                  MARY (CONT D)
                    Becca!  Are you even listening?

                                  BECCA
                    I haven t heard from him in four 
                    days.  We haven t gone four days 
                    without contact since he born.   POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       15

                    his own for the first time in Rome.

                    - izza.

                                  BECCA
                    You re right.  Totally right.
                          (deep breath)
                    Okay.  Better.  Thanks.

                                  MARY
                    Thank God.  I was afraid I was 
                    gonna have to share my Xanax.


      Becca rides through the tight, crowded streets of Rome.  With 
      her window down she is almost a part of the conversations, 
      lover s spats and hawking vendors, all punctuated by the 
      impatient HORN of her driver and the buzz of Vespas passing.  
      The streets swirl with life - you can almost smell the fresh 
      bread, coffee and cigarettes that infuse the air.  

      Becca - her mind only on Michael - notices none of it.


      Becca looks down the street, daunted by its length.  It is 
      lined on both sides by an endless row of apartment buildings.  


      Becca sits on a bench, searching through Michael s photos and 
      videos on her iPad.  She stops at a VIDEO of him and his 
      friends goofing around by the Trevi Fountain.  As she 
      watches, CAMERA PUSHES IN ON THE IPAD, until the image of 
      Michael and his friends fills the screen and suddenly -


      WE ARE THERE, IN THE SCENE, IN FULL 3D.  Michael and his 
      school friends push each other and mug for the camera. 

                                  A FRIEND (O.S.)
                    C mon, dude, the game s starting!

                                    MICHAEL
                    Chill, I m coming.

      The guys start off down the street.  Tony has been filming 
      and hands Michael his phone back.  Tony goes after the 
      others.  Michael looks directly into the phone, exuberant.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    AC Milan v. Roma... live!  I can t 
                    believe I m here.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       19


      He looks around to make sure his friends are out of earshot.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    I miss you, mom.

      FREEZE ON HIS FACE.  REVERSE the process; PULL BACKING from 
      his face to show the image on the iPad again.


      Becca looks at Michael s face, missing him, anguished.  Then - 
      she sees the FOUNTAIN in the b.g. - a vague thought - no!  An 
      idea!  She hurries across the square.


      We look at the famous fountain until we realize we are seeing 
      it on THE FACE OF BECCA S IPAD in one of the PHOTOS he sent.  
      She lowers the iPad and we are looking at the real fountain.

      Becca - with renewed energy - pacing - checking the photo 
      against the fountain - trying positions - finding the angle.  
      Downsizing the picture, revealing the edges - the fountain is 
      in the distant background; the picture was taken from inside 
      of the apartment, a couple of blocks away.


      Becca - her excitement building - moves quickly - flipping 
      through the pictures that were taken inside the apartment.  
      She sees a JEWELRY STORE - checks it against a photo.  Turns -

      And there it is - the BUILDING.  Becca scans the windows - 
      finds the one with the decorative wrought iron.


      A pair of ROMAN MUNICIPALE COPS.  They vault from the curb to 
      the door.  THE NEIGHBOR who saw Becca fighting holds it open.  
      The cops race up the stairs.

      In a CAR a few yards down the curb, A MIDDLE-AGED GUY 
      (AMERICAN) holds a half-unwrapped PANINI.  He looks up at -

      BECCA.  PIVOTING out from the window frame, GRABBING a drain 
      pipe, hand-over-hand GOING UP AND OVER the roof.

      The guy drops his panini, sits up. Pushes a key on his phone.

                                  GUY
                    Hi, yeah, Roma-Sector-One, I need 
                    an all-blocks direct connect. 
                    Grosvenor Square -

      He watches Becca escape along the rooftop -


      Another COP CAR - wah-WAH-wah-WAH - blocked by traffic. 

      A tee-shirted ITALIAN-STALLION takes his cell phone away from 
      his ear - can t hear! - and gestures at the cops, fuckers. 

      He takes a second to shoot a smile AT BECCA - walking quickly 
      by - ciao bella! - then gets back on the phone.  Except his 
      phone IS GONE. 

      WITH BECCA.  Holding the guy s phone - using a Kleenex - 
      rapidly dialing a number.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       23



      Wide on a sunset, kissing couples, picture-snapping tourists.  
      A romantic place to feel one with the city or lose yourself 
      in the crowd.

      Our focus falls on Becca as she makes her way down the 
      sweeping steps.  Giancarlo falls into step beside her.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    You promised you d never call me 
                    again.

                                  BECCA
                    I know.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    And yet, here you are.

                                  BECCA
                    I had no choice, Giancarlo.  My son 
                    is missing.

      This news stops him.  He softens.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    Becca... How can I help?

      TIME CUT -- They walk side by side as Giancarlo looks at the 
      PHOTO of the Dead Man on the phone.

                                  GIANCARLO (CONT D)
                    I know this man.  He was a former 
                    SISDE agent.

                                  BECCA
                    Italian Intelligence?

                                  GIANCARLO
                    He left four years ago under 
                      questionable circumstances.  No one 
                    knows who he s been working for 
                    since.

                                  BECCA
                    Can you find out?

                                  GIANCARLO
                    We ve been trying.  The guy s a 
                    ghost.

      Becca realizes the gravity of what she s done; takes a beat 
      to breathe.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       25


                                  BECCA
                    I can t believe I killed the only 
                    lead to my son.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    You did what you had to do.
                          (Beat)
                    I can t imagine what you re 
                    feeling.

                                  BECCA
                    Do you have kids?

                                  GIANCARLO
                    You know me.  Some people collect 
                    stamps -

                                  BECCA
                    And you collect hearts.

      Awkward beat.  He refers to the photo again.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    In two hours every intelligence 
                    service in Europe will be looking 
                    for you.

                                  BECCA
                    Including Interpol?

                                  GIANCARLO
                          (Beat)
                    Why look?  I ve already found you.

                                  BECCA
                    Thank you, Giancarlo.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    Do you have his picture?  Michael?

      She is touched that he remembers her son s name.  She takes 
      out a PHOTO.  Giancarlo studies it.  A click in his jaw.

                                  GIANCARLO (CONT D)
                    He has Paul s eyes.

      A slow double kiss of her cheeks and he s gone...


      With DAX MILLER - MOVING.

                    an answer...?  Good, then read it 
                    to me, this line s secure... 

      Late-30 s but still fresh-faced.  His handsomeness spoiled a 
      little by the underlying strain of being stalled in the 
      middle en route to the top.  He strides quickly by the STATUE 
      OF EISENHOWER outside the US Embassy.

                    Retired?  Retired...? 

      He walks past the glass embassy doors - PUBLIC moving in and 
      out.  His heels CLATTER on cement.  He s moving up and down 
      stairs, through a warren of cement passageways between 
      Embassy out-buildings and the parking garage.

                    ...Then what s an ex operative 
                    doing killing a...  Hold on... 

      He BANGS THROUGH a non-descript metal door, slides his cell 
      phone into a cubicle and stands with his IRIS up to a 
      scanner.  He ENTERS --


      Becca walks up to a BAR, which is pumping EURO-POP and 
      overflowing with sexy, trendy youth.  It could be Hollywood 
      or Chelsea, except with louder colors and skinnier clothes. 


      Becca waits, twirling her wedding ring on her finger, as 
      Francesca walks up, silhouetted by the lit-up COLOSSEUM.  
      Becca doesn t waste time.

                                  BECCA
                    If you know where he is, tell me.

                                  FRANCESCA
                    How would I know?

                                  BECCA
                    Please.  You spent the last night 
                    with him before he disappeared.  
                    There were two people in his bed 
                    and I m guessing one of them was 
                    you.  That makes you the last to 
                    see him.

      Francesca looks away...but she knows Becca has her.

                                  FRANCESCA
                    So...?

                                  BECCA
                    So did he seem nervous, did he talk 
                    about anything that was worrying 
                    him?
                          (Abrupt)
                    You have a husband somewhere?

                                  FRANCESCA
                    No - !!

                                  BECCA
                    An angry boyfriend?

                                  FRANCESCA
                    There was only Michael!

      She wells up and Becca can see her love for Michael. 

                                  BECCA
                          (softening)
                    All right.  Tell me what happened. 
                    Last Thursday, wasn t it?  The last 
                    time you saw him?

      Francesca lights a cigarette, but Becca snatches it from her 
      mouth and flicks it into the street.

      She holds out her hand until Francesca gives her the pack, a 
      little bewildered by this unsolicited parenting.

                    Thursday morning.

                                  FRANCESCA
                    In the middle of breakfast he told 
                    me he was out of milk and he ran to 
                    the corner store.  When he hadn t 
                    come back two hours later, I 
                    think... I don t know what to 
                    think.  But what can I do...?
                          (then, defiantly)
                    He turned out to be just like all 
                    the other American boys.  They get 
                    you in bed and go and find another 
                    Italian girl to play with.

                                  BECCA
                    He would never do that.  Not 
                    Michael.
                          (looking her in the eye)
                    You know he wouldn t.

                                  FRANCESCA
                    No.  Not Michael.

      Francesca nods her head now, broken-hearted.  Girlfriend and 
      mother share a bond.

                                  BECCA
                    Can you tell me anything else?  Any 
                    places he hung out?  Anyone who 
                    might have seen him?

      Francesca hesitates, then offers what she can.

                                  FRANCESCA
                    He used to hang out at a soccer 
                    bar, for Club Milano.  He made 
                    friends there, lots of friends, 
                    learn new curse words.

                                  BECCA
                    He s crazy for that team.  Do you 
                    know where it is?

                                  FRANCESCA
                    Via Deporta.

                                  BECCA
                    Grazie.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       32



      Becca walks down a half-lit, cobblestone street.  She passes 
      a store with a glass window full of VESPAS.

      She gets about halfway down the block.  A dead end.  A NEON 
      STAR AND SOCCER BALL SIGN glows over a locked and shuttered 
      door.  Becca looks up.  She seemingly doesn t see -

      THREE MEN.  Slowly approaching her from behind.  

      She hears them, stops - we see it in her face - I walked 
      right into this.  She turns.

                                  BECCA
                    Let me guess - Roma fans.

      The men swing up their AUTOMATIC WEAPONS - just as Becca 
      whips around with the gun she took from the dead guy - FIRES - 
      dives and rolls sideways and KEEPS FIRING - the men scatter - 
      one nips at her heels with SHOT BURSTS from his AUTOMATIC.

      Cars SCREAM into the alley.  Block it.  Becca peeks under the 
      car to see more MEN getting out.  Trapped. 

      She looks up and sees the window full of Vespas before her. 
      She FIRES into the plate glass.  It CRASHES... DISSOLVES... 
      Becca runs in.  Staying low.  SHOTS SPRAY.

      The Men (EIGHT of them) close in.  Peering ahead.  SUDDENLY -

      WAAAANHHHH - A VESPA COMES ALIVE - TEARING OUT - a RIDER 
      aboard - they OPEN FIRE - SHE FALLS OFF... They see -

      It s a MANNEQUIN. The LEADER screams <cease firing>, just as -

      BECCA tears out on ANOTHER VESPA, going the opposite way - 
      out of the alley - around the corner.  The MEN SCRAMBLE...


      Becca weaves through the tight streets of Rome on the Vespa, 
      her pursuers on far faster motorcycles and in cars.  Becca 
      avoids them by darting between cars, making hairpin turns.

      ON BECCA. Frustrated - the Vespa s too slow. She sees ahead - 

      A DELIVERY TRUCK, driving STRAIGHT TOWARDS HER - just as a 
      MOTORCYCLE PULLS UP NEXT TO HER... THE RIDER raises his 
      weapon - she BANKS - ZOOMS OFF AND AWAY from him - down a 
      street to her right--

      She FLIES - motorcycle FOLLOWS - his FRONT TIRE bumping HER 
      REAR TIRE - Becca wobbles; doesn t fall... She SPINS around,   POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       33


      the bike ON HER TAIL... She ZOOMS back down another block... 
      toward that first street, bursting out onto it -- 

      JUST AS THE DELIVERY TRUCK CROSSES HER PATH AGAIN... At the 
      last instant, she LURCHES SIDEWAYS, lays the Vespa ON ITS 
      SIDE... SLIDES UNDER THE TRUCK....

      The Biker appears - SEES THE TRUCK - too late!  Tries to DO 
      THE SAME MOVE and LAY HIS BIKE DOWN -

      BAM! - HE SLAMS into the side of the truck.  

      His bike slides under the chassis and out the other side.  
      Becca leaps from her own bike as it slides away - and GRABS 
      THE MOTORCYCLE as it stops sliding, rights it, hops on... and 
      ROARS OFF into the night.  SHOUTS and MORE GUNSHOTS as she 
      leaves her pursuers behind...


      Narrow.  Cobblestone.  Windows flanked by colorful shutters.  
      An idyllic Roman setting but for the blinking POLICE STROBES. 
      With a haunting lack of emotion, CORONERS wheel a STRETCHER 
      out from a narrow doorway, a BODY BAG strapped on top.

      FROM A DISTANCE, we see the body parked as the AMBULANCE 
      DOORS are opened.


      Becca watches the scene below, not as an agent, but as a 
      mother, raw, angry.  Giancarlo stands beside her.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    Don t feel bad.  She sent you to 
                    that alley and told someone you 
                    were coming.  She set you up.

                                  BECCA
                    She was a pawn, not a player.  I 
                    was so focused on finding Michael, 
                    I didn t see how scared she was.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    You shouldn t have called this in.   
                    They ll have your voice recorded.

                                  BECCA
                    I had to.  

      They watch as Francesca s body is placed in the ambulance.  A 
      TAXI pulls up and A WOMAN gets out, runs to the body, wailing 
      and thrashing over it the way only Italian mother s mourn.

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    She was killed for talking to me.

      Giancarlo gently takes Becca by the shoulders, turns her away.

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    He s alive.

      She looks at him, as if defying him to say otherwise -- to 
      confirm her worst fears.

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    If they ll go this far to stop me, 
                    Michael s alive.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       36


      Giancarlo nods.  Becca pulls away from him with new strength, 
      but a sharp pain shoots through her ribs.  She has to fall 
      back into his arms for support.

                                  GIANCARLO
                    We need to take care of you.


      WE ARE NOW IN THE VIDEO IN FULL 3-D.  10-year-old Michael 
      goes through the backyard, tracking.  Mary follows him, 
      picking her way through the mud.  He goes straight to a 
      DOGHOUSE and finds Becca hiding beside it.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Got you!

                                  BECCA
                    This is a good hiding place!  How 
                    did you find me so fast?

                                    MICHAEL
                    It was easy, you left a trail.  You 
                    wear Nikes, so I separated your 
                    tread from the other footprints.  
                    Then instead of crossing the grass 
                    like everybody else, you walked 
                    right through the mud -

                                  MARY
                    The same mud that ruined my 
                    Manolos, incidentally.

                                    MICHAEL
                    - and moved the doghouse to squeeze 
                    behind it.  You re not hard to 
                    find.  Dad was much better at 
                    hiding.

      A beat; they both feel the weight of what he just blurted.  

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    No, he wasn t - I just meant -  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       39


      He seems about to cry, so she pulls him close and hugs him as 
      tight as she can.  She looks at Mary over his shoulder.  
      Becca is on the verge of tears, for her loss and her son s.

      Mary lowers the video camera to give them privacy.  We tilt 
      down and see the BLINKING RED LIGHT of the camera REFLECTING 
      in a puddle --


      Becca stands in the shadows, scanning the street.  She spots -
      TWO MEN in a car, almost a block away.  Then - A MAN AND 
      WOMAN in a dimly lit window down the block in the other 
      direction.  The Building is being watched.  By everybody.


      Becca breaks the tongs in half and uses one tong like a slim 
      jim to work a window lock.  Window opens.  Becca is in.



      Becca has Goth Girl s head pinned outside - Branches whizz 
      past - tunnel looming - 500 yards - her head won t make it -


      Tunnel - 200 yards - 100 yards - bye, bye Goth Girl...

                                  GOTH GIRL
                      MACBETH!!!


      Shady trees - ancient, worn headstones - memorial statues and 
      picnicking families - Becca and Dax sip coffee and walk 
      through the biggest park - and cemetery - in Paris.

                                  BECCA
                    Did you read any of my file?

                                  DAX
                    All two paragraphs.  Enough to tell 
                    me that you were good at your job.

      Nothing to lose, Becca tries the bare truth.

                                  BECCA
                    Here s what s not in there.  I grew 
                    up with no parents, entirely in 
                    foster homes.  My childhood was 
                    made up of nothing but fear, always 
                    in a new place, always with 
                      strangers.  You know what kept me 
                    going?  I d fantasize that I had a 
                    real mother who would come and 
                    rescue me from the hell I was in.  
                    But I didn t.  The difference is, 
                    Michael does.  He has me.  And he 
                    knows I will never give up.  He 
                    knows with absolute certainty that 
                    his mother will come after him.

                                  DAX
                    Well played.  Gain your adversary s 
                    trust through sympathy.

                                  BECCA
                    I don t have time to play games, 
                    Agent Miller.  All you know about 
                    me is two paragraphs in a red file.  
                    But you just told me everything I 
                    need to know about you.  POIRIER - MISSING - N101 - "Pilot" - 01/07/11       54


      Off of his look:

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    You don t have children.

      He meets her eyes for a few moments and sees the pain there.  

                                  DAX
                    But I have a mother.
                          (Sighs)
                    You have three hours.


      Becca walks up, across the street and towards the crumbling 
      facade of a warehouse enclosed by a brick wall.

      She scales it and runs along its ridge.  Below she sees A ROW 
      OF BLACK VANS -- the same as the one that took her son; she 
      double-checks the plates and sees the one she is looking for.

      She jumps down off of the wall and slips over to the van.  
      She looks inside.  It is empty - they all are - but she notes 
      that they have ELECTRONIC GPS SCREENS installed.

      Heart racing, she scales a pile of discarded crates, climbing 
      to a windowsill.  She works the window open and goes inside.


      The building is one of the very few that sit right on the 
      bank of the Seine, the domain of the very rich.  We HEAR the 
      previous conversation continue OVER:

                                  ORTEGA (V.O.)
                    She had her chance to work with us.

                                  DAX (V.O.)
                    Two hours... one.

                                  ORTEGA (V.O.)
                    Issue.  The.  Alert.

      Becca passes one of the black vans, parked on the street.  
      Looks in; it s empty.  She checks the address she wrote down 
      at the warehouse and goes to the building.  She looks over 
      the names on the buzzer - notices there is one that is blank, 
      no name - that s the one.  She runs her fingers down the 
      board buzzing every apartment.  Someone BUZZES her in.


      - AND HITS WATER OF THE SEINE HARD, PHOTOS SCATTERING!

      Our last image of Becca: floating on her back in the 
      reflection of the Eifel Tower, eyes shut, the photos of her 
      son splayed around Becca as a BLOOD CLOUD blooms in the 
      water, the actual tower piercing the sky above her...
