      Nyholm getting out of her car, nods to an approaching Alicia.

                    Miss Nyholm.

                    Could you help me out here please.  

      Infant toys, diaper bags.  Oh.  Alicia nods, takes them as 
      Nyholm reaches into the backseat to detach the car seat.

                                  ALICIA
                    Boy or girl?

                                  NYHOLM
                    Girl.  Unlucky you caught Judge 
                    Parks.  That s not going to turn 
                    out well, is it?   

                                  ALICIA
                    Why do you say that?  

                                  NYHOLM
                    Well, he s a pro-business 
                    constructionist who s never met an 
                    insurance company he didn t like...  
                            (baby-voiced to her infant)
                    ...isn t that right?  Yes, it is.  

                                  ALICIA

                          (laughs)
                    Ah, is that what you re hanging 
                    your hat on?  I know a lot of pro-
                    business pro-lifers, and somehow 
                    business always seems to get the 
                      upper-hand.  Do you mind?

      A stuffed bunny.  Alicia sighs, takes it, as... 


      Golden with Eli Gold, walk and talk, checking Blackberries:

                    So, good.  The reverend s on board.    

                                  GOLDEN
                    Yes.  He s seeing Peter twice a 
                    week.  I ll petition the court for 
                    monitored trips back and forth to 
                    the Lord in Christ Church.  *

                                  ELI GOLD
                    And I ll slip an item to Abdon 
                    Pallasch to get some photographers 
                    there.

                                  GOLDEN
                    You might hold off on that.  

                                  ELI GOLD
                    ...Why?

                                  GOLDEN
                    Peter doesn t want it.  

                                  ELI GOLD
                    He--?  Why?

                                  GOLDEN
                    Pastor Isaiah. *

    Eli stares at Golden.  Thinks for a second.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    So what s going on?  

                                  GOLDEN
                    Exactly what we wanted: spiritual 
                    guidance.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    No.  What we wanted was a photo op.

                                  GOLDEN
                    And we ll get that... eventually.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    And in the meantime?

                    Peter is listening.

    Eli frowns.  Shit.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    I m not liking the sound of this.

                                  GOLDEN
                    Are you religious?

                                  ELI GOLD
                    I am.  But I m not a convert.  
                    Converts scare me.  Religion s like 
                    a drug.  In small doses it s 
                    curative.  In large, it s addictive.  
                    Talk to him.

                                  GOLDEN
                    He won t listen to me.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    No, not Peter.  Reverend Isaiah.*

                                  GOLDEN
                      PastorIsaiah.  You talk to him.  *

                    You would be better.

      Golden smiles knowingly...

                                  GOLDEN
                    Eli.  Aren t we living in a post-

                                  ELI GOLD
                          (smiles)
                    Okay.  I ll do it.  Won t this be 
                      entertaining? 

      Golden smiles: yes, it will.

      Pamela Pomeroy, in the LifeStateparking lot, starting to get 
    in her car, stops.  Turns to find Kalinda, and... Will.  
      Recognizing him...  

                                  PAMELA POMEROY
                    You re...?

                                  WILL
                    Yes.  Do you have a moment, Miss 
                    Pomeroy?

                                  PAMELA POMEROY
                    I don t think we should be talking.

                                  WILL
                    We just need a minute.  Why are 
                    they trying to hide you? 

                                  PAMELA POMEROY
                    I have no idea what you re talking 
                    about.  I have to go.

                    Please.  The Willoughbys, their 
                    child is dying.  I saw it in your 
                    eyes, you want to help.  Please 
                    help.

      Pamela stares at him.  And starts to laugh incredulously:

                                  PAMELA POMEROY
                    You saw it in my eyes?

      Will stares at her, startled.  She laughs again, harshly:

                                  PAMELA POMEROY(CONT D)
                    Really?  What powers of perception.  
                    What do you see in my eyes now?

    She puts on Bambi eyes, blinking.  Will stares at her.  Not 
      what he expected.  

                                  PAMELA POMEROY(CONT D)
                    I m going home now.

                    Nyholm said she s trying to hide 
                    Pam.

      Pamela turns to Kalinda, looks her up and down:

                                  PAMELA POMEROY
                    You guys are really clueless.  
                    She s not trying to hide it.  It s 
                    already closed.   

    And Pomeroygets in her car, starts off.  Kalinda turns to 
      Will:  

                                  KALINDA
                     It ?
