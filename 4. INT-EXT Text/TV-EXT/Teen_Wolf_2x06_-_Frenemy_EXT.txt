      Danny taps a command on his TABLET and the message vanishes 
      from the screen, sent off to Jackson. Tossing the tablet into 
      the trunk of his car, Danny slams it shut while--


      Derek Hale runs as fast as he can. Leaping over a chain link 
      fence with an acrobatic flip, he drops to the other side, 
      landing on all fours. When he lifts his head--

      He's now a werewolf. A RED-EYED ALPHA.

      In the distance, he spots the glowing eyes of the Kanima 
      peering back at him, almost challenging him to catch up.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/122.

      Derek lopes after it, hands and feet pounding the pavement. 
      As the Kanima bounds up the side of a building, a VOICE calls 
      out.

                                  SCOTT (O.S.)
                    There he is!

      Stiles s Jeep SOARS into view. Gripping the wheel, he 
      struggles around a turn while Scott tracks the Kanima s 
      movement from the passenger side.

      Just as they re closing in, however, Stiles SLAMS on the 
      brakes. They SCREECH to a stop at a parking lot entrance 
      where severe tire damage SPIKES jut up from the pavement.

                                  STILES
                    What do we do--

      But Scott is already out the door and running for it.


      RAINWATER SPLASHES up beneath Derek s boots. Landing on the 
      puddle-strewn pavement, he closes the distance between 
      himself and the Kanima.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/124.

        CONTINUED:55

      He charges forward, feet leaving the ground as the creature 
      bounds up in retreat. Hand swiping out, he grabs it by the 
      ankle and--

      SLAMS it down to the pavement. 

      But the thing whirls up, instantly back on its feet, 
      SHRIEKING in defiance.

      Fangs bared, Derek ROARS a response.

      They circle each other. One a monster of brute force. The 
      other a slippery creature, moving with a fluidity that 
      borders on elegance.

      Derek swings a fist which it easily dodges. Punch after punch 
      fly out, Derek SMASHING through brick walls, sending DUST and 
      DEBRIS flying.

      The Kanima, however, ducks and parries each blow, whipping 
      its talon-like claws toward Derek.

      DROPS OF VENOM leap from the tips of the creature s claws as 
      Derek ducks back. The paralytic DROPLETS just miss his head 
      as he bends back, head almost touching the ground.

      When Derek comes up, however, the Kanima flips around and 
      KICKS him right in the chest. He splashes down, tumbling flat 
      on his back in a puddle.

      The creature turns to run. Until GUNSHOTS literally take it 
      off its feet. Two direct hits from a Desert Eagle gripped in 
      the hands of--

      Argent.

      LIGHTS from his SUV blazing out from behind him, he steps 
      into the alleyway and into the fight. 

      Stunned, the Kanima slowly rights itself but--

      Argent FIRES again, one shot after the next. Shells dropping 
      to the pavement around his boots, he presses relentlessly 
      forward.

      The Kanima takes each hit, finally collapsing to the wet 
      pavement.

      Argent swings the gun back to aim for Derek. But there s no *
      sign of him. Head turned, Argent doesn t notice the Kanima 
      slowly rising to its feet.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/125.

        CONTINUED:55

      When he hears the scrape of claws, Argent whips the gun up 
      and pulls the trigger again.

      But he s out of ammunition.

      The empty clip clatters to the pavement. He yanks a new one 
      from his coat, but not fast enough.

      The Kanima surges toward him and with one precise hit, sends 
      him CRASHING to the pavement.

      Argent blinks, bordering on unconscious as the Kanima turns 
      to face--

      Gerard.

      Unarmed, the senior Argent holds still as the creature 
      surveys him. Claws TICKING against the pavement, it carefully 
      approaches the fearless Gerard.

      The Kanima cocks its head to look at him, almost like a cobra 
      judging its prey. Gerard simply stares back, holding his 
      hands to his sides, palms out.

      Fingers grasping for his gun, Argent tries to blink his 
      blurry vision back to normal while the TWO DARK SHAPES 
      inspect each other, almost blending together until--

      SOMETHING HITS the Kanima from behind, sending it tumbling 
      back. The attacker--Scott McCall--lands on his feet.

      As the Kanima sets off in retreat, Scott gives a momentary 
      glance to the quietly pleased Gerard and then--

      Charges forward in pursuit.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF


      Turning a corner, Scott slides to a halt when he hears 
      VOICES. A crowd of people gather outside the neon lit facade 
      of a building. It s a NIGHT CLUB.

      Scott turns, trying to find the creature. But it s Stiles who 
      races out of the darkness, gasping for air.

      They glance about, trying to stay out of view of the club.

                                  STILES
                    You couldn t catch a scent?

                    I don t think it has one.

                    Right, that s what the claws and 
                    fangs are for. Now it all makes 
                    sense.
                          (off Scott s look)

                                  SCOTT
                    Can you just help me find it?

                                  STILES
                    But does he know? And did anyone 
                    else see him back at your house?

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t think so. And he already 
                    passed Derek s test anyway.

                                  STILES
                    Yeah, but that s the thing. How did

                    Maybe it s an either/or thing. 
                    Derek said a snake can t be 
                    poisoned by its own venom, right? 
                    So when s the Kanima not the

                                  SCOTT
                    When it s Jackson.

      Scott looks to him for confirmation, but Stiles s gaze is 
      focused on something else.

                                  STILES
                    Dude...

      He nods to THE ROOF OF THE CLUB where A TAIL arcs into the 
      moonlight. The Kanima s body glides into view and then darts 
      down through an air conditioning vent.

                                  STILES (CONT D)

                    What the hell s he going to do in 
                    there?

      With a quick breath, Scott snaps his head toward the line. 
      He s caught a scent.

                                  SCOTT
                    I think I know who he s after.

                                  STILES

      FADE IN:


      Slipping around to the back alley behind the club, Scott and 
      Stiles locate the rear door. But when Stiles tries the 
      handle, it s locked.

                                  STILES
                          (glancing up)
                    Maybe there s a window we could 
                    climb through--

      A METALLIC CRUNCH interrupts him. Stiles peers down to see 
      the handle--no longer attached to the door--in Scott s hand.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Or a handle we could rip off with 
                    super human strength. How did I not 
                    think of that?

      Scott yanks the door open and they hurry inside.


      The back door to the Martin home clicks open. Barefoot, Lydia 
      lets the family dog, a well-coiffed terrier named PRADA, out 
      into the yard. While it disappears into the shadows, Lydia 
      waits, hugging herself in the cold.

                                  LYDIA
                          (calling out)
                    Let s go, Prada. You re all of 
                    twenty pounds. There s only so much 
                    that can come out of you.

      BARKING echoes from the darkness, low and distant.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Prada? Let s go!

      The BARKING rises and then abruptly STOPS.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Prada?

      Stepping into the yard, Lydia approaches the edge of the 
      woods. After a moment of ominous silence, she s no longer 
      irritated. She's frightened.

      Beginning a cautious retreat back to the house, a SOUND makes 
      her pause. FOOTSTEPS crushing leaves. But not the patter of 
      four paws. It's the one-two rhythm of a person.

      Breath caught in her throat, Lydia takes a fearful step back 
      as SOMEONE walks right out of the darkness.

      offers Lydia his most charming smile.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/1211.



      Racing into the parking lot, Scott follows the shimmering 
      BLOOD DROPS on the ground. Behind a row of cars and SUV's he *
      spots--

      A FIGURE collapsing to the pavement.

      It s Jackson, returned to his human self. Slipping into 
        unconsciousness, the wounds across his throat appear to be 
      healing, but there are puddles of blood all around him.*

      Another pair of feet race past the parked cars--Stiles 
      catching up. He finds Scott knelt down, holding Jackson s 
      shivering and naked body off the wet pavement.

      The sound of SIRENS approach from the distance. Scott looks 
      up to Stiles.

      FADE IN:


      Under the trellis at the back door of her house, Lydia swats 
      her terrier, Prada, back inside and returns her attention to 
      the Junior.

      Lydia plucks the flower out of his hand. Then, trying not to 
      glance back at him--but failing--she steps inside and quickly 
      shuts the door.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/1216.



      Ambulances and Sheriff Deputy cars surround the night club

                    Just seeing if you re okay and 
                    wondering if--well--anything kind 
                    of weird happened to you today.
                          (off Danny s look)
                    Besides being paralyzed from the 
                    neck down.

                                  EMT
                    Sorry, but we need to get him to *
                    the hospital.

                                  SCOTT
                    I just need to talk to him for half 
                      a second--

                                  EMT
                    Talk to him at the hospital.*

                                  SCOTT
                    One more question. Just one.*
                          (to Danny)
                    Are you okay?

      Danny looks up, surprised by the genuine concern on him.

                                  DANNY
                    Did it happen to my ex too?

      Scott spots Danny's ex lying on another stretcher and nods.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Then I m great.

      Smiling back at him, Scott steps away to allow the EMTs to 
      lift him into the ambulance.


      Stiles talks fast, trying to hold Stilinski s attention.

                                  STILES
                    What are we doing? Here? It s a 
                    club. We were clubbing. At the 
                    club.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Not dressed like that.

      Stilinski moves for the Jeep, but Stiles whips in front of 
      him just as Jackson sits up inside.

                                  STILES
                    Dad, listen--


      Stilinski peers over to the Jeep. Scott waves, smiling 
      innocently. Stilinski turns his glare back to Stiles.

                                  STILINSKI
                    All right, this is the second crime

                    The truth... The truth is we re 
                    here with Danny. He broke up with 
                    his boyfriend and we were taking 
                    him out to get his mind off it.

                    Go.

      And a moment later, Stiles sends the Jeep hurtling out of the 
      parking lot, right past a DARK SUV where--


      Outside the van, Jackson s VOICE soars up among the trees.

                                    JACKSON (O.S.)
                    Stiles! McCall!

      Standing in the middle of the woods, Stiles and Scott turn to 
      each other, looks of dread on both their faces.

                                    JACKSON (O.S.) (CONT D)

      FADE IN:


      Outside the Police Transport Van, Stiles shoots Jackson's 
      parents another text message: Going to be home late. Don't 
      wait up.

      Lowering the phone, he pauses, listening to the quiet of the 
      woods. Then... the sound of leaves being CRUSHED underfoot. 
      Someone running. Coming right toward him. 

      Backing away, Stiles whirls around and--

      Breathes in relief when he sees Allison coming toward him. 
      But then he notices the panic on her face.

                                    ALLISON
                          (gasping)
                      Stiles--Stiles, they know.

                    They can t. I ve been texting his 
                    parents since last night. They 
                    don t have a clue.

                    My grandfather told me his parents

      Stiles slowly raises Jackson s phone, gazing on it as if 
      holding a loaded weapon.


      Bike skidding to a halt, Scott jumps off and hops the POLICE 
      TAPE surrounding the parking lot. Spotting Danny's car, he 
      hurries toward it. But slows when he gets a closer look. 

      THE TRUNK lies partially open, metal around the lock bent and 
      twisted as if someone had pried it with a crowbar. Scott 
      slowly pushes the lid up to confirm what he already 
      suspects...

      The trunk is empty.


      The Prison Transport Van now sits parked at Lookout Point. 
      Gathered just a few yards from the van, Scott, Stiles and 
      Allison discuss his latest discoveries.

                                  SCOTT
                    If Jackson doesn t remember being 
                    the Kanima he definitely won t 
                    remember stealing Danny s tablet.

                                  STILES
                    But why would he steal it if he 
                    doesn t even know what s on it?

                                  STILES
                    Okay, hold on. Someone saw Jackson 
                    made a video of himself turning 
                    into the Kanima. Then erased part *
                    of it so he wouldn t know. Who *
                    would do that?

                                    ALLISON
                    Someone who wanted to protect him.

                    There s something else.

                    It can t be. It s tried to kill all 
                    of us. You, me, Allison. I don t 
                    know about you two, but I haven t 
                    murdered anyone lately.

                    It s not. But we have to tell them. *
                    We re a bunch of sixteen year-olds. *
                    We can t handle this.

                                  SCOTT
                    You re right.*

                                    ALLISON
                          (to Stiles)
                    How are you going to make your dad  *
                    believe all this?*

                                  STILES
                    I don t know.*

      Scott turns to Stiles, his eyes GLOWING.*

                                  SCOTT
                    He ll believe me.
