    A faceless brick warehouse building sits on the other side of the 
      tracks in a Chicago suburb. It s not exactly seedy, but not MIT either. 

                                      JAMIE (V/O) 
                        Cougar Culinary Labs in Chicago. I 
                        create artificial flavors... 

 

      Jamie walks up a residential street. He stops at a homey yellow house 
      with the proverbial white picket fence. After a moments, he goes up and 
      KNOCKS on the door. 

      The front door opens and his estranged wife, Vanessa, stands there, 
      intelligent and earnest. She maintains her distance.  

      Before any words are spoken, Jamie suddenly SNEEZES. 

                                      VANESSA 
                          Gesundheit. 

                                      JAMIE  
                        You wearing rose oil again? 

                                      VANESSA 
                              (a verbal stab) 
                        No reason not to... 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I just came by to check in on you and 
                        Booth. 

                                      VANESSA 
                                (beat) 
                        Come on in. 

      She opens the door wider and stands back to let him enter. 

      Jamie sneezes again O/S. 

                                      VANESSA (O/S) 
                        You look tired. 

 

      An aging convertible careens down the empty late-night highway, Wally s 
      guitar case reaching out of the backseat. 

                                      JAMIE (V/O) 
                        You really kicked ass tonight. 

 

      Jamie is driving, due to Wally's obvious flirtation with illegal 
      substances.  

                                      WALLY 
                        We were pretty fucking awesome, 
                        weren't we? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Next thing you know it's MTV, babes in 
                        bikinis, low-boy leather pants with 
                        your buns hanging out. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Anna says I've got cute buns. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I never said you didn't. 

      They share a laugh. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT D) 
                        What was with the fake mohawk? 

                                      WALLY 
                        Oh.. 
                              (pats his head) 
                        Covers my hair transplant scar. What 
                        the hell? 

      They laugh again. 

      The convertible ZOOMS along the highway.  

      Jamie and Wally are both lost in separate thoughts.

       Jamie's POV THROUGH the WINDSHIELD of a car approaching. 

      Something is happening to Jamie's vision. The lines on the highway 
      light up, then the road changes to the view of an unfamiliar spot. 
      Quickly the road changes back. 

      Jamie sits back, disturbed by the hallucination. 

      The hallucination returns, clearer than before. An unfamiliar city 
      street looms before him. 

      Jamie if flipping between reality and the hallucination. TWO OLDER 
      WOMEN move along a charming, old-fashioned cobblestone road. The pass a 
      quaint old CLOCK that reads 11:25, two hours earlier than it is in the 
      sedan. City buildings reach high into the skyline over the trees that 
      line the road. 

                                      JAMIE  
                        Oh shit... 

      The car veers over the yellow line. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT D) 
                        Wally! 

      Wally rouses. 

                                      WALLY 
                          What's&what s the matter? 

      Jamie jerks the wheel, trying to maintain control, but flying blind. 
      The car SCREECHES crazily. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I can't see. 

                                      WALLY 
                        What? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I can't see. 

      The car straddles the middle two lanes, weaving crazily. 

                                      WALLY 
                        What are you doing? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I can't see. 

                                      WALLY 
                        Jamie&wha&what are you doing? 

      Jamie and Wally are being thrown about the car.  


 13 
                                       WALLY (CONT D) 
                        What the fuck are you talking about  

                                      JAMIE 
                        Take the fucking wheel! 

                                      WALLY 
                        What the fuck? 

      Wally reaches frantically for the wheel. 

    A huge TRUCK looms toward them from the rise ahead. It BLASTS its HORN. 

      Wally lunges across Jamie, grabbing the wheel just as Jamie jams and 
      locks the brakes sending them into an insane skid. Tires screeching, 
      the car races across the blacktop. 

      Jamie and Wally scream, frantic, trying to steer, their hands fighting 
      at the wheel. 

      The truck barely misses Wally's car, which goes into a wild SKID, 
      coming to a rest on the side of the road. 

      Everything goes quiet, as the truck's HORN fades into the distance. 
      Wally's guitar case has jammed between the front seats, hiding Wally 
      from Jamie. 

      Jamie's eyes open and he realizes what has just happened. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        Wally. Wally, you okay? 

      Whimpering comes from behind the case. Jamie pulls the case aside and 
      Wally rises up, his face in a shit-eating grin. He's laughing like he 
      just got off a great roller coaster. 

                                      WALLY 
                        That was fucking great. 

 

        JAMIE'S/WOMAN'S POV of a sketchpad. There is a wonderful rendering of a 
      COUGAR'S FACE being drawn by the Woman's hand. 

      RESUME JAMIE S DINING ROOM 

      His eyes still wide, he continues drawing. 

      RESUME PARK -- JAMIE'S POV 

      Unexpectedly, a TEARDROP falls onto the drawing. 

      She looks up, revealing that she is in the heart of a lush park. A 
      placid COUGAR lies at then end of a TRAINER'S LEASH. 


 30 
       RESUME JAMIE S DINING ROOM 

      Jamie lays his hands on his drawing, a cougar traced in red wax on the 
      white linen tablecloth. 

      RESUME PARK -- JAMIE'S POV 

      POV as the Woman walks through a parking lot. Before her is a big city 
      skyline with a large bay on one side and lush green mountains across 
      the bay. 

      This is the same city as in JAMIE'S VISION on the highway in Wally's 
      car. 

      She approaches a particular BLACK CAR. 

      RESUME JAMIE S DINING ROOM 

      Jamie stares unblinking. 

      RESUME PARK/PARKING LOT -- JAMIE'S POV 

      POV as the Woman gets in her car, checking herself in the rearview 
      mirror. 

      RESUME JAMIE S DINING ROOM 

      Jamie blinks, coming out of the vision. 

 

      Jamie moves among the throngs of people amidst the morning bustle. 

 37 
     A WHISTLE BLOWS as Jamie passes the GASTOWN STEAM CLOCK, the clock he 
      saw in his vision on the highway with Wally. 

      Jamie turns to get a better look at the clock and SLAMS right into a 
      MAN reading his newspaper, knocking him to the sidewalk.  

                                      JAMIE 
                        Sorry.  

      Jamie apologizes, but is suddenly startled by the man's newspaper in 
      front of him. He picks it up and reads the headline. 

      On the front page is a PHOTO and HEADLINE that jolts our attention. It 
      is the Man from the visions in the photo. The headline reads, "Local 
      artist found dead in studio." 

      The Man he knocked to the ground grabs the paper back roughly. 

                                      MAN 
                        Want to buy your own? 

      Jamie reaches for a paper. 

 

      Jamie searches for an address. He stops. Bells ring. Is he transposing 
      again? He waits a moment, surprised not to be transposing. But he 
      smells something. He looks around, spotting something across the 
      street.  

      In the middle of a block of shops is an ELEGANT LITTLE SHOP with an 
      old-fashioned SIGN with a distinctive logo over the door, "Plaisirs de 
      Chocolat". He is drawn irresistibly to the store. 

 

      Jamie moves down the sidewalk carrying an expensive box of CHOCOLATES, 
      searching again for the address. 

      He steps out in front of the LOFT where the Man, DENNISON HOOPER, was 
      found dead. He checks it against the newspaper photo. 

      Jamie tries the door. It creaks open and he looks up the crumbling, 
      shadowy stairway.  

 

      Catherine peels around the corner just as Jamie comes stumbling 
      outside. 

      He sees the license plate. It reads SQM 329. 

      Jamie stares at her dust, repeating the license number to himself. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        SQM 329. SQM 329. 

 

      JAMIE walks up the unfamiliar street, stopping in front of a LUXURY 
      CONDOMINIUM BUILDING. He carries the box of chocolates under his arm.  

 

      As Jamie checks the list of residents, one of them comes out the door. 
      Seeing his chance, Jamie enters. 

 

      Jamie storms out of the building. He slams down the chocolates. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Asshole. It just reminds her of him. 

      Jamie moves down the street and into the night. 


 40 
  

    A beautiful, cold, crisp morning. Catherine walks along the shore 
      alone. A JOGGER goes through his paces around the park. 

      Jamie follows, keeping his distance. Catherine turns and disappear into 
      the greenery. Jamie is nervous, having lost sight of her. He slows 
      down, searching for her. 

      He stops at the water fountain. She is nowhere to be seen. He bends to 
      take a drink. 

      Catherine steps in front of him, angry. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Why are you following me? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        I'm not following you. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Do you think I'm an imbecile? 

      He just shakes his head, rather than try to answer her. 

                                        CATHERINE (CONT'D) 
                        What do you want? 

      She glares unflinching into his eyes. He can't control what comes out 
      of his mouth. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I think you're the most beautiful 
                        woman I've ever seen. 

      That throws her off-balance for a moment, though she doesn't believe 
      him. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Tell me why you brought me those 
                          chocolates. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I thought you'd like them... 
                                (beat) 
                        And I... I needed to meet you. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        How do you know me? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I saw you sketching at the zoo, a 
                        cougar. I... I'm a fan. I really like 
                        your work.  

 41 
                                         CATHERINE 
                        Then why didn't you just come up and 
                        say hello? Why are you following me? I 
                        could call a policeman and have you 
                        thrown in jail. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I don't know. I'm really sorry. I was 
                        stupid. I just& I had to meet you. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Well... we've met. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Yes. 

      She turns to leave. Jamie follows her. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                      I like your painting very much. I 
                        think you're very talented. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                                (sarcastic) 
                        Thank you for telling me that. 

      Jamie can't bear that it all might end here at the Stanley Park water 
      fountain so he continues. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Look, I'm not one of those creeps that 
                        follows beautiful women around and 
                        drives them crazy. I'm not a stalker. 
                              (gently, persuasively) 
                      I know I made a mistake. I'm really 
                        very, very sorry. I realize I make a 
                        lousy first impression. Could I just 
                        talk with you?  

      When she doesn't say anything immediately, he takes it as encouragement 
      and continues before she can decline. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        Lunch, someplace nice. Your choice. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        I m glad you like my work, but I don't 
                        think it would be a good idea. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        No, please. We need to talk. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        No, you need to talk. I don't.

                                       JAMIE 
                        Listen, I've come a very long way to 
                        find you. Just lunch. A public place. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        My life is complicated enough right 
                        now. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I know. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        What do you know? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I mean, everybody's life is 
                        complicated. Mine too. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Why me? Why don't you go stalk some 
                        movie star somewhere? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I know how special you are. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        You don't know anything about me. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Yes, I do. 
                                (covering) 
                      I know you wish I'd leave you alone. 

      She sighs and almost smiles. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        Look, I know how you feel, and I don't 
                        blame you at all, and I promise I'll 
                        leave you alone and never bother you 
                        again if that's what you want. Just 
                        let me take you to lunch first. Just 
                        once. 

      She nods. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        You're right about one thing. 
                              (he brightens) 
                        You make a terrible first impression. 

      They smile.

      Jamie and Catherine shares sandwiches under an umbrella in the park. It 
      is awkward and somewhat formal between them. She feels uncomfortable as 
      she looks at him. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                                (wary) 
                        Are you just going to keep staring at 
                        me? Is that why you're following me 
                        around? 

      He doesn't know how to start. Finally, he looks up at her. This is it. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I have to talk to you about something. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        What? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I have to tell you the reason& why I 
                        love you. 

      She scowls. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        What? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I can't say it again. 
                                (beat) 
                      I know you better than you think. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        How long have you been spying on me? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        It's not what you re thinking. Please, 
                        don't be afraid of me. 

                                        CATHERINE  
                        I'm not afraid of you. 

      Jamie isn't quite sure how to start. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Sometimes... I'm inside you. 

      She stands to leave. Jamie grabs her hand. He takes control, stronger, 
      knowing this is the last chance.  



 44 
                                       JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        No, please. Listen to me. I'm not 
                        crazy. I'm not a pervert. I'm on your 
                        side.  

      Catherine takes her seat. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        Sometimes I can feel what you feel. I 
                        can smell what you re smelling. I can 
                        even see what you see. I can't control 
                        it. It&it just happens. 

      She looks at him like he's crazy, but he doesn t stop. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                      I know I sound like a lunatic, but 
                        it's true. It started when I tasted 
                        the chocolate, and I thought it was a 
                        dream, but then the park with your 
                        paintings...  

      She is silent. She doesn't run away, maybe because she senses that it's 
      true. She knows what he must know. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        For some reason, I got to know you 
                        better than anybody knows you. 
                        Somehow, we're psychically linked, and 
                      I was hoping that maybe& you could 
                        feel me. 

      They look at one another for a long beat, both minds racing.  

                                        CATHERINE 
                        I'd like to go home now.  

      Jamie is crushed. 

 

      The sun is going down as they walk up the street in awkward silence. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        I'd really rather be alone right now. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Please, just& please let me walk you 
                        to your door. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                              (sharp) 
                        Just leave me alone. 

 45 
       It's over. They look at each other, a long silent beat, and Jamie gives 
      up. 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Okay.  
                                (beat) 
                        I'm sorry. I understand. 

      Jamie steps around the corner of a building, spotting something. 

      He quickly turns and roughly throws Catherine against the wall. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        Shh. Shh. Shh. 

      Jamie peers around the corner of the building. In front of her condo 
      sits an unmarked POLICE CAR. TWO DETECTIVES sit in the car waiting. 

      She struggles as he holds her against the wall, his hand over her 
      mouth. She BITES him, but he won't let go. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        Quiet. Quiet. Those are cops. You 
                        can t go home now. 

      Catherine s eyes are wide with fear and distrust. 

                                      JAMIE (CONT'D) 
                        You have to trust me. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        What do you know about me? 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I know you had to do it. Let me help 
                        you. 

      Jamie looks back at the police car. 

                                        DETECTIVE (V/O) 
                        Out of millions of people, why you? 

 

      Jamie sits next to Catherine on a bench facing out into the water. She 
      faces the water, away from him. She still doesn't trust him.  

                                        CATHERINE 
                        What do you want from me?  
                                (turns to him) 
                        Money? 
                                (beat) 
                        Sex? 

                                      JAMIE 
                        Everything I've told you... everything 
                      I will ever tell you is the truth. 
                        I'll never lie to you. I want to help 
                        you. 

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Even knowing what I've done? 

      He looks her in they eye, unable to answer, remembering the nausea, the 
      guilt, the pain, and her fury. 

      There is a TRANSITION in her. She lets down the wall, and we see how 
      truly vulnerable she is. Slowly, her eyes begin to brim. She looks up 
      into his eyes. 

                                        CATHERINE (CONT'D) 
                        I'm scared... 

      Jamie reaches out to put an arm around her and she allows him to touch 
      her. 

                                      JAMIE 
                      I won't let anything happen to you. 

      She looks up into his eyes, reading him. Is trust dawning? She reaches 
      up and gently, hesitantly, traces his face with her fingertips, each 
      contact an electrical charge.  

                                        CATHERINE 
                        Will you take me home? 

 47 
                                       JAMIE 
                        Do you trust me? 

                                        CATHERINE 
                      I have to. 

      He looks at her a long beat. 

 

      Jamie looks around, then turns to nod at Catherine. The coast is clear. 
      She steps out of the bushes and they move to the building together. 
      Catherine opens the door. 

      They park at the corner, just in case, and he leads a nervous Catherine 
      up to her house. 

 

      Jamie s stretcher is loaded into the ambulance. A crowd gathers. A 
      SIREN wails away, swallowed up by the night as the FLASHING RED LIGHTS 
      fade into the distance. 

      END OF EPISODE
