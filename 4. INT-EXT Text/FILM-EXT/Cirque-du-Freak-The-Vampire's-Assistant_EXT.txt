Kids eat lunch, off in their groups. On the field: Darren
has a SOCCER BALL practically glued to his foot. He dribbles
through defenders, shoots, SCORES! Steve pumps a fist:
STEVE
GOAL! Three to one!
The other team regroups, starts back upfield with the ball.
Darren steals it. A few strides and WHUMP!
Darren catches the goalie too far out. The ball lofts just
over the backpedaling goalie's head, bounces into the goal.
STEVE
(EXULTANT)
Three to two!
Angry at himself, the goalie KICKS the ball away. It veers
off toward the street. Steve takes it as a personal insult.
STEVE
What does that prove? Huh?
The goalie blanches as Steve moves at him. Kids are nervous
about Steve. He likes to fight. Darren gets between them.
DARREN
Go get the ball. It's 3 to 2.
Lunch's almost over.
3.
STEVE
That's why he kicked it. To kill
time. Well, I still got time to
kick your face.
DARREN
(BLOCKING HIM)
Forget it. The ball.
Steve decides, heads after it. The goalie gulps in relief.
GOALIE
Thanks, Darren. He's crazy.
Darren watches after Steve. He does have a vicious streak.
THE STREET
Steve tracks down the ball which has rolled into the street.
From seemingly out of nowhere...
A gleaming black 1966 LINCOLN Continental. Its tires sucking
at the asphalt as it rolls. The windows blacked out.
It speeds up reaching the ball. Ba-Dump! The ball BURSTS.
STEVE
You idiot!
The car SCREECHES to a stop, idles ominously. Suddenly Steve
doesn't seem so tough. He looks nervously back to Darren.
But as a WIND picks up, the Lincoln suddenly tears off.
A sheet of PAPER is kicked up by one of the car tires. The
wind sends it sailing. It drifts down, until... Steve
notices, snatches it out of the air.
Darren steps up beside him, watches the Lincoln disappear
down the street. Creepy...
STEVE
Look at this.
The paper is a FLYER. A startling, violent layout. Beneath
a snarling WOLF'S HEAD: CIROUE DU FREAK - Human oddities and
other living curiosities. Midnight. Zeiterion Theater. $20
- Admission is at the discretion of the proprietor.
STEVE
.Human oddities and other living
curiosities...
(TO DARREN)
Other. Does that mean not human?
4.
Darren shrugs, takes the flyer.
DARREN
A freak show. Ever been to one?
STEVE
(GRINS)
Just this school.
Darren turns the flyer over. There are tire tracks on the
back. They hear the sound of distant tire squeals, but the
Lincoln is long out of view. Just an empty street now...
CUT TO:
A BOA OCCIDENTALIS
Probing the confines of its glass prison. A BOA CONSTRICTOR
by any other name. It's a prison within a prison because
we're inside...
THE SCHOOL SCIENCE LAB - DAY
The teacher, MR. DALTON, moves ponderously around the room.
His voice like a metronome.
MR. DALTON
As you can see reptiles and
amphibians are not one in the same.
As Mr. Dalton continues, we see various PAIRS OF STUDENTS,
their computer screens showing text or pictures of various
FROGS, ALLIGATORS and LIZARDS...
DARREN and STEVE sit together staring at a Komodo Dragon.
After Mr. Dalton passes by, Steve switches screen views.
He's done a WebSearch of Cirque du Freak. There are a dozen
or so entries. He picks one: History of the Side Show.
Under 1920's there's an older, much more 'Victorian' pamphlet
for the Cirque du Freak. A more ornate version of the same
Wolf Head. The same notice from the proprietor.
Steve spreads the flyer out to compare. They whisper:
STEVE
1923...
DARREN
Must be a different one.
Steve scrolls down through pictures:
5.
Sword swallower and glass eater: OHIO GRAY.
Frog boy: AVERY CHILDS.
Human skeleton: J.D. COMBS. .and then...
Egyptian Soothsayer: LARTEN CREPSLEY. Crepsley's gaze is
startling. Like he can see through the screen, even from
1923. Steve looks like he's just seen a ghost.
Suddenly, he hits print. As a PRINTER against the wall
clicks to life, Steve looks back at Darren.
STEVE
I gotta show you something...
CUT TO:
Picture perfect: two stories, dormers, trellises. 9-year-old
ANNIE rides up on her bike, bookbag over her shoulder.
Without stopping, she hops off, dumps it on the lawn by two
other bikes. A few steps and she's through the door.
CUT TO:
The moonlight glinting off Darren's spider terrarium.
Darren, under the covers, gets out of bed. Fully dressed.
Going to his door, he listens. Then he crosses to the
window. Pulling out the screen, he starts to climb out.
CUT TO:
Darren out his second floor bedroom window, starts to climb
down via the trellis. CRACK! A section of the trellis
BREAKS under his feet. Darren almost falls, catches hold.
He pulls himself over, starts down again.
CUT TO:
Part of a dilapidated, mostly abandoned downtown. Noirish.
Darren and Steve hurry around a corner.
STEVE
I came here after your house.
There was a van there, guy selling
tickets.
(holds up tickets)
Rest is history.
They cross toward the ornate, albeit crumbling facade of the
ZEITERION THEATER. Deserted, except for a few CANDLES
burning on the sidewalk by a door. The wind moans.
DARREN
You know why they closed it, right?
Years ago a kid fell out of the
balcony and died. It's haunted.
12.
Steve catches himself getting spooked. He shoves Darren.
STEVE
Get inside.
CUT TO:
3 AM. Dead quiet. Darren hurries home, cage in hand.
Looking over his shoulder. So far so good. He nearly trips
over an untied shoelace. He sets down the cage, to tie it.
Madam Octa lunges across her cage at a WORM on the sidewalk.
DARREN
Oh. You want that?
Darren picks up the worm, lowers it between the bars. A beat
and then Madam Octa snatches it away from him. Dinner.
25.
DARREN
See? I'm your friend... You're so
beautiful I stopped thinking.
The wind rustles. Darren grabs the cage, continues.
CUT TO:
The house dark. Holding the cage with one hand, Darren
starts climbing the side of the house using the other. He
avoids the broken section, but as he reaches the window:
His Dad is standing there looking out. Busted.
DAD
Get inside.
From his angle, Darren's Dad can't see the cage in his son's
hand. Darren hooks it over the end piece of part of the
trellis and climbs in. Leaving the cage hanging behind.
CUT TO:
Dressed, Darren climbs out the window, starts down.
CUT TO:
Dead lonely as Darren approaches, steps up to the glass door.
As he leans in to look into the lobby, the door gives a
little. It's unlocked. Darren pushes it open with a finger.
CUT TO:
They step out into the moonlight. Darren a little wobbly.
CREPSLEY
Take my arm. Don't let go.
Darren takes hold. Crepsley starts to move. Only it seems
more like he's still and the ground is moving under his feet.
Darren looks about as the building begin to streak past, the
road a blurred ribbon. The night has a weird chromatic look.
The world moving faster, Crepsley and Darren slipping past.
A moment later and they're in the...
HOSPITAL PARKING LOT
Crepsley pulls loose Darren's hand. They're still bleeding.
CREPSLEY
Lick your fingers. Vampire spit
will stop wounds from bleeding.
Darren looks at his fingers, then around the lot.
DARREN
How'd we get here?
CREPSLEY
It's called flitting. Which room
is your friend in?
CUT TO:
BURSTING OPEN as Darren charges out. Running for his life.
CUT TO:
The door opens and Darren steps out. He takes a long look up
and down the street. Nervous. Then he see the sun up in the
sky. Relaxes a little. Right... Vampires... Sun.
He takes a step down the stairs when... From out of the
bushes... SOMEONE LEAPS!
ANNIE
Boo!
Darren nearly jumps out of his skin. Annie laughs.
ANNIE
Got you! I finally got you! -
Darren turns on her, looks like he could kill her.
DARREN
Don't ever do that again.
Annie's smile drops away. As Darren continues on...
CUT TO:
Darren walks home, hands in pockets. Annie comes up behind.
ANNIE
Darren! Wait up!
He looks over his shoulder, keep going.
ANNIE
Can I walk home with you?
He softens, slows down. After a few silent steps.
DARREN
Got you something.
Darren pulls the MOUSE from his pocket. Annie loves it, cups
it in her hand.
45.
ANNIE
He's adorable.
ANNIE & DARREN - A CREATURE'S POV
Coming in low and fast.
STREET
Annie SCREAMS as a GERMAN SHEPHERD charges, stops just short
of them. GROWLING like it was rabid. Like it hates Darren.
Darren steps between it and Annie. Darren's pupils dilate
oddly; he curls his lip to show his own teeth. The dog
starts to back off..
ANNIE
Hey. That's King.
DARREN
No it's not. King's my buddy.
ANNIE
That's King, Darren. It is.
Darren realizes it is King. As Darren realizes something's
wrong with Darren.. Another growl. From down the street.
Darren looks back as a black 1966 LINCOLN prowls through the
intersection. The one seen at school. It slows, windows
blacked out. As it continues, disappears from view...
DARREN
Come on.
As Darren hurries Annie along down the street...
CUT TO:
Darren's parents watching CNN. Darren comes in.
DARREN
I'm going to bed.
They say 'good night' to him. Impulsively, Darren kisses his
dad on the cheek, then does the same to his mom.
DARREN
I love you both. I don't say it
that much, but I do.
Darren's Mom is caught off guard, but happy to hear it.
MOM
We love you, too. Don't we, Tommy?
DAD
Of course we do.
Darren looks at them a beat, then smiles, satisfied.
DARREN
Good night.
They watch him go, then exchange looks.
DAD
(SHRUGS)
Kids. Who knows how they think?
CUT TO:
Darren FALLS, crashes through the trellis and thumps into the
lawn. Crepsley looks down from the window, then disappears.
CLOSE ON Darren lying face down in the grass. CRICKETS
chirp. Beyond, a NEIGHBOR walks his DOG. The dog suddenly
turns in the direction of Darren, pulls on its leash.
NEIGHBOR
No, no, come on --
The Neighbor stops short as he sees the body.
NEIGHBOR
Hey -- Hey, kid --
He rolls Darren over, realizes something is very wrong.
51.
We stay on Darren, the dog sniffing at him as the neighbor
disappears toward the front door. We hear his fist pound. A
moment later, Darren's father is there. He looks at Darren,
up to the open window, realizes he fell. An instant later,
he's on his knees, cradling his son.
DAD
Darren? Darren!
A moment later his Mom...
MOM
Darren! Oh my God!
We're still on Darren's face, his eye open a slit.
DARREN'S POV
His parents hovering over him in despair. The STARS TWINKLE.
The neighbor leans in.
NEIGHBOR
Is he dead?
CUT TO:
PEOPLE leave. Visiting hours are over.
CUT TO:
DARREN IN HIS COFFIN
A hand reaches down, a thumb opens his eyelid.
DARREN'S POV
Of the ceiling for a moment, then a blinding light flashing
back and forth. Then glimpses of Steve's face!
VISITING ROOM
Steve holds Darren's eye open, shines a PENLIGHT into it.
The pupil doesn't dilate. Footsteps approach. Steve
switches it off, pockets it as the FUNERAL DIRECTOR enters.
53.
DIRECTOR
I'm sorry. I know it's difficult,
but visiting hours are over.
Steve nods sadly, looks to Darren. He pats one of Darren's
hands which are folded across his chest.
In reality Steve checks Darren's fingertips. A WHITE SCAR at
the end of each one. Steve's crazy idea may be confirmed.
CUT TO:
Darren's coffin is lowered into the ground.
MINISTER
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in
sure and certain hope of the
resurrection to come...
Darren's Dad tosses a handful of earth down onto the coffin.
CUT TO:
DARREN INSIDE THE CLOSED COFFIN
The lid an inch from his face. His eyelid twitching as we
hear shovelfuls of dirt hit the lid. The sound growing
duller at each turn. Then, as Darren's eye flickers open...
CUT TO:
Moonless. The sound of digging continues. Only now, dirt is
coming out of the hole rather than going in.
Crepsley is digging the coffin back up. Effortlessly.
Finally, he spreads his feet apart, pulls open the lid.
Darren sputters as some of the dirt spills onto his face.
Crepsley reaches down, pulls him up and out of the grave.
Darren sits on the ground, coughing then moaning.
CREPSLEY
On your feet.
DARREN
My legs are asleep.
54.
Crepsley pulls him up anyhow. Darren stumbles a few steps,
nearly falls before finding his balance.
CREPSLEY
Walk it off. I'll fill this back
in. Go. Breathe some air.
Crepsley closes the coffin, begins to fill the hole as Darren
ambles off. Not exactly the start of his best day.
MOVE WITH DARREN
Passing among the graves, stretching his arms, twisting.
Really beat up. He looks about, the names and dates on the
headstones popping into focus even from far away. Night
vision. Suddenly he becomes aware of something:
Steve. On the other side of a mausoleum. Ten feet away.
DARREN
What are you doing here?
STEVE
(smiles; closing in)
Vampire hunting.
Steve rushes the last step, a jagged WOODEN STAKE held high
over his head. He knocks Darren back on the ground.
Pouncing on top, he brings down the stake.
Darren catches hold of Steve's wrist. Stops the point of the
stake just over his heart. Steve puts his weight into it. A
desperate moment of struggle, but Darren's strength is
resurgent. He throws Steve off.
Steve rolls to his feet, comes at him again. Darren catches
his wrist with one hand, his throat with the other. He slams
him up against the mausoleum, holds him there.
DARREN
What do you have against vampires?
You wanted to become one yourself.
STEVE
Yeah, I wanted to, but you did.
You stole my dream. You stole my
destiny.
DARREN
Are you crazy? I did it to save
your life. That was the deal. Me
for you.
55.
STEVE
(UNHINGING)
Liar. You told him I was evil.
You planned this all along. And
you'll pay! You'll pay --
Darren jams the stake under Steve's throat. That stops him
struggling. The points jabs him as he swallows.
DARREN
I want you to leave...
Steve is just beginning to realize how strong Darren is now.
DARREN
I want you to leave and forget you
ever saw me. Understand?
Scared, he nods. Darren shoves him away, brakes the stake in
two. Steve heads away, looks back over his shoulder.
STEVE
I'm going to hunt you, Darren. You
and the other one. Crepsley. I'll
put a stake in you and burn you to
ashes. I'll make sure you never
come back from the grave again.
WHAM. Steve walks right into Crepsley. He picks Steve up by
the shoulders, pulls him close. With a voice like Death...
CREPSLEY
If we ever meet again, I will show
you loneliness you cannot imagine.
Steve trembles in fear. Crepsley lets go. Steve takes off
running. Crepsley looks to Darren.
CREPSLEY
Do you still question his blood?
Darrenthoughtful, doesn't know what to think.
DARREN
Would a stake through the heart
kill a vampire?
CREPSLEY
Yes. But so would getting hit by a
truck if it was going fast enough.
Steve finally disappears from sight. Crepsley sighs.
56.
CREPSLEY
He'll be trouble before it's over.
DARREN
Before what's over?
CREPSLEY
This adventure we're on. Shall we
start?
Darren hesitates, looks to the twinkling lights of his city.
CREPSLEY
You'll get used to it after awhile.
Vampires are always saying goodbye.
A beat, then Darren looks back at him.
DARREN
Let's go.
CUT TO:
THE SUN
As it blisters up into, then rises above the horizon.
Sunrise. Ominous if you're a full vampire.
CUT TO:
On the edge of the highway. Silhouetted against the sun.
CUT TO:
Darren watching the cars go by on the highway, spots...
DARREN
Minnesota...
Darren jots this state down on a LIST he's keeping. About
twenty state license plates so far.
CUT TO:
58.
Getting late, stores closing. The parking lot nearly empty.
Darren and Crepsley are on a walk and talk.
CREPSLEY
We can die violently. Accidentally
or otherwise. But we also grow
old. A full vampire will age one
year for every ten human years he's
alive. A half-vampire like you:
one for every five.
DARREN
I don't understand.
CREPSLEY
I was born in 1774. I became --
Crepsley looks back to where Darren has stopped short.
DARREN
1774?
CREPSLEY
Should we do the math or not?
Darren nods. Crepsley motions him to keep up.
CREPSLEY
I became a vampire when I was 20
years old. In 1794.
DARREN
1794?
CREPSLEY
In Paris. The days of the Terror.
Heads in baskets. Guillotines up
and down all day. Really when
humans put their minds to it, we
vampires can hardly compete.
59.
Darren's stare jogs him back from the good old days.
CREPSLEY
Math. 1794. So I've been a
vampire now for 211 years. Hmm?
Darren nods again, still with him.
CREPSLEY
I age 1 year for every 10, so, 211
divided by 10, I've aged about 21
years in that time. That 21 plus
my first human 20 makes me look
about 40.
DARREN
But altogether you're 211 plus 20.
You're really 231 years old.
CREPSLEY
Exactly. You're going to be a
teenager for a very long time.
They walk on a few steps as Darren thinks this over.
DARREN
Where do you keep your car anyhow?
CREPSLEY
What car?
DARREN
The one you were driving around my
town in. The old black one.
CREPSLEY
I've never owned a car, Darren. I
don't need one.
DARREN
It was near school one day. It
followed me home a few days later.
CREPSLEY
And you saw me behind the wheel?
DARREN
I couldn't see who was driving.
CREPSLEY
It wasn't me.
As Darren considers this, Crepsley stops suddenly.
60.
CREPSLEY
There...
Ahead: just more parking lot. A WOMAN exiting a BOOKSTORE.
DARREN
What?
CREPSLEY
Dinner.
CUT TO:
The woman nears her car. A chirp as she unlocks it with her
remote. She opens the back door, sets the book bag on the
seat. Suddenly she turns, like someone called her name.
WOMAN
Yes?
Only nobody's there. She shrugs it off, closes the back
door. But hesitates at the driver's side door. Then she
starts walking away, toward a back area of loading docks.
CUT TO:
DARREN & CREPSLEY
Watch from a dumpster by the loading dock. She walks right
toward them. One look at Crepsley's face and we know he must
be willing her over. Darren looks terrified.
But the air shimmers and Crepsley has disappeared.
The woman steps up, stops across from Darren. As she frowns,
tries to figure out who he is and how she got here...
DARREN
Go. Run.
But Crepsley appears beside her. He 'breathes' into his
hand, 'guides' the air into her face. He catches her as she
passes out. Darren is horrified.
DARREN
Did you kill her?
CREPSLEY
I put her to sleep. She'll be like
this 15 minutes. When she wakes
up, she won't remember a thing.
61.
Crepsley eases her to the ground, finds a vein on her wrist.
DARREN
Will she become a vampire?
CREPSLEY
No. She'd have to share y blood
for that to happen.
DARREN
Don't take too much.
CREPSLEY
A vampire who feeds often can
control himself. One who drinks
only when he must can end up
feeding wildly.
He uses one of his fingernails to open the vein.
CREPSLEY
The hunger inside us must be fed to
be controlled. To be civilized.
It's what separates us from... the
others.
DARREN
What others?
But as blood oozes, he takes the woman's wrist td his mouth.
Darren is repulsed, but can't look away. Crepsley takes a
few deep swallows, then holds the wrist out to Darren.
CREPSLEY
Your turn.
DARREN
No. I won't.
CREPSLEY
Darren...
DARREN
I'll never do it.
Crepsley runs his tongue over the cut, rubs the saliva in.
CREPSLEY
You can lead a vampire to blood,
but you can't make him drink.
DARREN
I'm only half-vampire.
62.
CREPSLEY
No matter, you need blood to live
now. You'll drink eventually.
When you're hungry enough.
The wrist is clean, the cut gone. A barely perceptible scar.
DARREN
I'll die first.
CREPSLEY
(ANGER FLASHING)
Don't be stupid. You may abstain
tonight, but you must feed soon.
Crepsley stands to go, then stops short. Tense, he looks
about, more hunted animal than man. As he shrugs it off.
DARREN
What is it?
As the woman starts to stir...
CREPSLEY
Nothing. Let's go.
DARREN
Something out there scares you.
What is it?
CREPSLEY
The thought of spending another
minute with you.
Crepsley turns and walks, but Darren's right.
CUT TO:
Darren struggles as Mr. Tiny pulls him along. Behind,
through the diner windows, WE SEE Patrons frozen in flight.
Sinewy Two near frozen in fight with Crepsley who is in mid
swing with the knife in his head.
Mr. Tiny and Darren stop across from YOUNG MURLOUGH.
Humanoid in shape, monstrous in visage. Bloated, his skin
albino white with purplish mottling and red crisscrossing
veins. He must weigh 300 pounds, but NFL nose tackle style.
MURLOUGH
Smell the blood. The lovely blood.
His eyes narrow at the sight of Crepsley, his mouth widening
to show two rows of sharp filthy teeth.
Darren needs to do something. He eyes the watch in Mr.
Tiny's hand. He grabs it with his free hand, thumbs back in
the winding knob. As Murlough disappears from view...
The WINDOW EXPLODES as Sinewy Two hurtles out.
Darren tosses the watch high in the air. Mr. Tiny releases
him to move to catch it.
Darren rushes back toward the restaurant.
Mr. Tiny catches his watch.
Crepsley meets Darren. Crepsley's broken arm hangs uselessly
from his side.
Murlough appears alongside. He grabs Crepsley by the throat,
lifts him off the ground.
Crepsley arcs the knife into Murlough's shoulder.
Murlough staggers, lets go.
67.
Crepsley takes Darren's hand and they flit, disappearing.
CUT TO:
Beyond the hamburger joint. The world beginning to streak
past them. The asphalt begins to blur beneath their feet,
passing cars like they were standing still. But Crepsley
heaves for breath. In pain.
Darren looks back over his shoulder...
DARREN'S POV
Murlough follows. Closing ground.
DARREN & CREPSLEY
DARREN
It's behind us!
Crepsley bears down, the buildings streaking by. But...
MURLOUGH
Closes regardless, relentless, death in his eyes.
CREPSLEY
Almost out of gas. But looking ahead. Clocks in an instant:
a RED LIGHT AHEAD. Cars STOPPED. A CAR FROZEN having just
crossed the INTERSECTION. HEADLIGHTS from a blind corner.
Crepsley slows. Just as Murlough's about to catch him from
behind... Crepsley comes out of flit mode, disappears.
As Murlough FADES after him.
CUT TO:
Darren and Crepsley appear on the far side of the crossing.
Murlough comes out of flit in the center.
WHAM! The headlights Crepsley saw frozen, but coming from
the blind corner, become a PICK-UP - broadsiding Murlough!
He goes up over the hood, SMASHES against the windshield.
As Darren and Murlough disappear again...
68.
The pick-up brakes. Murlough doesn't. He tumbles off the
hood, sprawls hard into and skids along the street.
A beat and he rolls to a sitting position, looks around. No
Crepsley in sight. Blood runs out of one of his ears. As he
wipes it, smearing it across his cheek...
PICK-UP DRIVER
(RUSHING OVER)
Hey, man, are you okay?!
He stops short when he sees Murlough's face. Murlough
stands, SWATS the driver aside.
The Lincoln screeches to a halt alongside him. Murlough
climbs in. The Lincoln tearing away.
CUT TO:
The sky getting lighter. A SIGN: Now Entering Pennsylvania.
The air shimmers as something flits past... WHOOOSHH!
CUT TO:
Boarded up. Abandoned. Clutching his arm, Mr. Crepsley
kicks at the door, splinters it. Opens"a gap. Darren
reaches through, unlocks it. As they step inside, the first
rays of the sun appear through the trees.
CUT TO:
The Cirque is camped by an ABANDONED FACTORY. Neo-Gothic in
scale and mood. Lit up for a performance. Mr. Tall, pulls
on his jacket, shouts orders.
MR. TALL
Show time in twenty minutes.
Someone tell Rhamus to get his
stomachs in gear!
He's surprised to see Crepsley and Darren walk up the road.
Crepsley's arm seems much better now.
MR. TALL
Larten'Crepsley! As I live and
breathe. I thought it would be
years before I saw you again.
Mr. Tall looks to Darren, throws a surprised look to
Crepsley. Crepsley nods. 'Yes'.
MR. TALL
Darren Shan. You've come a long
way since the last time I saw you.
DARREN
I liked it better where I was.
MR. TALL
I'm sure.
CREPSLEY
Do you still have my coffin?
MR. TALL
Of course. You're really back?
(CREPSLEY NODS)
Perhaps you could do the show
tonight? A few of us are absent or
ill this evening.
CREPSLEY
I'd be delighted.
MR. TALL
Mr. Shan will have to pull his
weight as well. I'll give him to
Evra. Evra! EVRA!
(LOOKING ABOUT)
I hope I haven't gone from one
unreliable boy to two.
72.
Evra arrives. The snake boy from the first Cirque show.
MR. TALL
Evra, my industrious wonder. Here
is Darren. Put him to work with
you. Show him the snakey ropes.
As the two boys consider each other...
MR. TALL
Off with you. Go!
As the boys head off, Mr. Tall looks over at Crepsley.
MR. TALL
You blooded a child, Larten? What
were you thinking?
CREPSLEY
You don't approve?
MR. TALL
I don't matter. What will the
vampire generals say when they hear
about it?
CREPSLEY
I'm no longer part of their domain.
MR. TALL
So you say. They may disagree.
CUT TO:
As Darren and Evra make their way through.
EVRA
What do you do? Me? I'm a snake
boy. I do a whole snake thing.
Evra goes into a slithery snake walk for a few steps to
illustrate. It's strange. Funny. Evra looks back over.
DARREN
Do you eat mice?
EVRA
Big Macs actually.
They share a LAUGH. Evra 'high fives' Darren. Fast friends.
73.
As they continue, Darren looks at the palm of his hand. A
few of Evra's SCALES have come off and are stuck there.
DARREN
I caught your act in the last town.
Pretty cool.
EVRA
Thanks. I'm not doing it tonight.
My snake caught a cold.
DARREN
Snakes can catch cold?
Evra nods, then SNEEZES himself.
EVRA
Still gotta work the floor though.
Ushers. We get the seats filled.
They pass PEOPLE all hurriedly crossing the camp.
DARREN
Who are they all?
EVRA
The backbone of Cirque du Freak.
They do the driving, the tent
pitching, the potato peeling even.
DARREN
How did they end up here?
EVRA
Most wandered in. If Mr. Tall
likes them, they stay.
Darren's eye is caught by the WOLFMAN. He's being pushed
toward the factory building by several of the blue-robed
LITTLE PEOPLE. The wolfman's yellow eyes are on Darren as he
rumbles a low, guttural growl.
Darren is so taken that he almost walks into...
Madam Truska. He stops short. In costume, beardless, even
more beautiful than when we first saw her. She considers
Darren, uses a finger to raise his chin. She shakes her
head, smiles. As she continues...
CUT TO:
74.
Set against the black sky. Sparks rise up, their source
unknown. All very mysterious until... LAUGHTER. Lots of
it. Borderline raucous. We follow the sparks DOWN to...
A BONFIRE
Blazing in the Cirque campgrounds. The freaks are eating,
drinking wine, relaxing after the show. Like a gypsy camp.
Mr. Tall sits with his long legs up on a box, really enjoying
watching everyone else enjoy themselves.
Evra munches on a sausage he grills on the end of a stick.
Darren is all ears and eyes. He likes these people. And
he's certainly never experienced anything like this.
Someone starts to play a guitar, someone else beats a drum.
Madam Truska starts to dance, the fire flickering against her
as are all eyes. Then she reaches out, takes Crepsley by the
hand. A few moments later, the two of them are engaged in a
mad TANGO. It takes the camp's collective breath away.
Even Darren can't help but enjoy it. Crepsley's arm gives
him a twinge or two, but only Truska notices.
CUT TO:
A mattress on the floor inside. Using tape and cardboard,
Darren 'blacks out' the windows. Crepsley steps over.
DARREN
Almost done.
Crepsley looks to the sky. Still dark. The moon setting.
CREPSLEY
Darren...
(Darren looks over)
(MORE)
78.
CREPSLEY (CONT'D)
I'm not going to sleep here. We'll
find a nook in the factory.
Crepsley starts off. Darren starts to follow.
CRESPLEY
Mattress.
Darren sighs, goes back to the van to retrieve the mattress.
He starts to pull it out, then stops, nearly doubled over.
Concerned, Crepsley steps over. Darren waves him off,
straightens as whatever it was passes.
DARREN
I just felt sick for a second.
CREPSLEY
You need blood.
Darren gives him a dirty look, grabs the mattress. They
start walking toward the factory.
CUT TO:
The SHADOWS of a loading dock. Crepsley and Darren approach.
DARREN
You think Mr. Tiny might come?
Crepsley shrugs, doesn't answer.
DARREN
Who is he? What does he want?
CREPSLEY
What we want is who we are, don't
you think?
DARREN
Can't you give me a straight answer
just once?!
CREPSLEY
You won't learn by me telling you.
You must live some things to know
what they are.
Darren sighs in deep frustration. Crepsley has a thought.
CREPSLEY
Okay. Why do you like spiders?
79.
Darren tires to figure what he's getting at? Implying?
CREPSLEY
Did you ever think there was a
particular reason?
It seems Crepsley knows the answer even if Darren doesn't.
DARREN
No. I never thought about it.
CREPSLEY
That's the trouble with children.
They don't think about things.
DARREN
I'm not a child.
Theystop by the shadows.
CREPSLEY
Are you a man? If you're not a
man, you're a child.
DARREN
I'm in between.
CREPSLEY
In between does not exist!
The words echo a moment. Darren no closer to understanding.
CREPSLEY
I'll sleep in here tonight. But
sit outside the van tomorrow and
make it look like I'm there. It's
just caution. Old habits die hard.
VOICE
And old vampires?
Without a sound, someone has reached around the two of them
from behind, a RAZOR-KNIFE held to each of their throats.
They stand dead still. We can make out the shape of a head
as whoever it is leans in ever so slightly from the dark.
CREPSLEY
Gavner Purl, as always I heard you
coming from a mile away.
CLICK! In his hand by his side, Mr. Crepsley holds a thin
SWITCHBLADE. He presses the steel back ever so slightly.
80.
VOICE
We'll call it a draw then.
The 'voice' pulls back his knives, steps out. It's GAVNER
PURL. He was once handsome, but those days are long gone.
His face is crossed with scars. They vary in size, thickness
and color. Gavner is a warrior, carries himself so.
GAVNER PURL
It's been too long, Larten.
CREPSLEY
Decades now.
They embrace. Darren's trying to catch up.
DARREN
You guys are friends?
GAVNER PURL
I suppose. We once shared a coffin
together. For six months.
DARREN
(SARCASTIC)
Like roommates? To save money?
GAVNER PURL
We were being hunted.
DARREN
Who was hunting you?
CREPSLEY
Never mind. Darren, Gavner Purl.
Gavner extends his hand to shake. Darren sees'the scars on
Gavner Purl's fingertips. Darren raises his own hand so
Gavner can see his scars. Gavner looks at Crepsley.
GAVNER PURL
A half-vampire?
CREPSLEY
Of course. We don't make full
vampires of our assistants.
Gavner Purl looks at Crepsley, stunned.
GAVNER PURL
Nor do we make assistants of
children.
(MORE)
81.
GAVNER PURL (cont'd)
(LOSING IT)
A child, Larten? Why?!
CREPSLEY
I have my reasons.
GAVNER PURL
And they are?
CREPSLEY
I don't owe answers to vampires
anymore. I'm exiled from our kind
GAVNER PURL
Self-exiled. And I at least am
owed an answer.
There's a personal history being called upon here. Crepsley
is well aware. Darren again is left out.
CREPSLEY
All I care to say is a boy sought
me out, knew who I was. He asked
me to make him my assistant.
Gavner looks to Darren, suspicious.
GAVNER PURL
And how did you know --
CREPSLEY
(INTERRUPTS)
It wasn't Darren. Another boy.
His blood was bad. I should have
killed him, but I didn't.
Darren reacts. Gavner considers it all.
CREPSLEY
I met Darren shortly after. His
blood was good or I certainly would
have killed him.
Darren reacts again.
GAVNER PURL
How could a boy find you?
Crepsley shrugs. Of course he had help.
GAVNER PURL
Tiny?
82.
DARREN
He tried to kill us.
CREPSLEY
He tried to kill me. What he
wanted with you wasn't determined.
GAVNER PURL
Perhaps you chose the wrong boy.
In Mr. Tiny's eyes.
A moment as they consider the unspoken implications.
DARREN
What are you guys talking about!?
No answer as Crepsley and Gavner lock each other in a look.
CREPSLEY
What's important enough to track
down an exile? What is your news?
GAVNER PURL
War.
CREPSLEY
I'm not interested in your wars.
GAVNER PURL
Well the other side is interested
or they wouldn't be trying to get
rid of you.
Crepsley gets suddenly very angry.
CREPSLEY
I've had enough killing! No more!
You've come to the wrong place. I
am the wrong place...
Gavner raises his hands in surrender.
GAVNER PURL
Even so, I'm glad you're alive.
CREPSLEY
(RELENTING)
The sun is coming. Will you stay?
GAVNER PURL
I can still make miles. The war
won't wait. And neither will bad
news. I have to go.
83.
CREPSLEY
Then travel safely.
GAVNER PURL
Would you mind if I walk a bit with
your assistant?
CREPSLEY
Take him with you if you want.
He's of little use to me.
CUT TO:
Darren and Gavner Purl walk. Gavner looks him over.
GAVNER PURL
You look sick. Doesn't Larten feed
you?
DARREN
I won't drink blood if that's what
you mean. I promised myself.
GAVNER PURL
Why?
DARREN
You'll get insulted.
As Gavner waits for Darren to tell him...
DARREN
I'm afraid if I drink blood, I'll
become evil.
Gavner LAUGHS out loud, catches himself.
GAVNER PURL
The only thing drinking blood will
do to you is keep you alive.
DARREN
That's how it would start. I would
swear it was just to stay alive.
But what'll I turn into? You're on
one side of the fence or the other.
My father used to say that and now
I know what he meant.
The 'father part' chokes Darren up a bit.
84.
GAVNER PURL
You've already turned, Darren. You
need to accept what you've already
become. There's no going back.
They walk in silence a moment. Then:
DARREN
Why did Crepsley make himself an
exile anyhow?
GAVNER PURL
He was tired of all the killing.
We were at war.
DARREN
With the vampaneze?
GAVNER PURL
Crepsley was once a Vampire
General. One of our great leaders.
He may seem reluctant, but I assure
you, no one is as skilled at
killing vampaneze than Crepsley is.
I think that's why they'd like to
get him out of the way. Kill him
off before the new war starts.
DARREN
You've known him a long time?
GAVNER PURL
I was his assistant. He blooded
me, as he blooded you.
There's almost something comforting in this news. Gavner
Purl so proud and strong looking. Darren wants to know...
DARREN
Why'd he choose you?
GAVNER PURL
To teach me to kill vampaneze. Up
until now, it's the only reason he
ever chooses anyone.
DARREN
Is it why he chose me?
Gavner hesitates, not sure.
85.
GAVNER PURL
That's for Crepsley to say. Not
me.
Another brick wall, but Darren accepts it.
GAVNER PURL
Do you know what the biggest danger
is to a vampire, Darren?
DARREN
The vampaneze? Mr. Tiny?
GAVNER PURL
No. It's that they live so long
they no longer care. Everything
they love is left behind until they
finally have nothing left to live
for. Except death. The fact that
he's taken an apprentice seems, to
me, a good sign. A sign that he's
thinking of living not dying.
DARREN
Lucky for me. Glad I could help.
All the same Darren considers what he's heard. Gavner,
meanwhile, considers the open countryside ahead.
GAVNER PURL
A clear run. Good.
Gavner gives Darren one last appraising look.
GAVNER PURL
Stay by him, Darren. Stay by him.
Gavner takes a deep breath. The air around him shimmers, his
image bouncing in and out of phase like an electron heating
up. And then he's gone.
DARREN
That part is definitely cool.
CUT TO:
High in the noon sky. PAN DOWN to where Darren stands under
a tree by the old van. He concentrates, looks himself over.
Nothing. He concentrates again. He's trying to flit.
86.
Very briefly -- the air shimmers around him -- then stops.
He looks at his arms. Little WISPS of smoke come off them.
EVRA
(ARRIVING)
What's up?
DARREN
Nothing.
EVRA
(SNIFFS AIR)
It's smells like burnt hair.
DARREN
Don't know. I'm congested.
(SEES SOMETHING)
Hey...
Evra follows his gaze, turns just in time to see:
THEIR POV
Debbie and Sam ducking inside the factory.
DARREN & EVRA
Exchange a look. Start after them.
CUT TO:
A spot where the roofing is gone, several long RAFTERS
stretch out. Darren, Evra and Sam watch Debbie walk out on
one. Like a balance beam. The factory floor 70 feet below.
EVRA
Hey, be careful.
SAM
Don't worry. She's like a gymnast.
Debbie moves slowly at first, her arms stretched out for
balance. Then she does a hop, a skip. Darren and Evra gasp.
She gets to the other side, turns and bows.
DARREN
You're crazy!
DEBBIE
How about you?
DARREN
I got nothing to prove.
DEBBIE
But it'd be easier for you than me.
DARREN
Why's that?
DEBBIE
Because chickens have wings.
She starts chicken CLUCKING. Mad, Darren steps onto a
rafter, starts across. He stops in the middle, spins around.
Aided immeasurably by his half-vampire skills.
90.
Debbie is impressed.
ANGLE OVERHEAD
The vertigo angle as Debbie walks back out on her rafter.
Stops about 4-feet across from Darren.
DARREN & DEBBIE
Darren crosses his arms across his chest. No big deal.
DEBBIE
Let's play mirrors.
DARREN
What's that?
DEBBIE
I do something and you have to copy
me. Like this.
Debbie crosses her arms the same way Darren has. He
uncrosses them as he realizes.
Debbie reaches down, touches her toes. Darren sighs, then
does the same, gets a good look at the floor below.
Debbie takes one foot off the rafter, takes hold of the top
of it with one hand, raising the other arm out for balance.
Looks like a ballerina.
Evra doesn't like this daredevil stuff.
EVRA
Come on, guys...
Darren hesitates. Not because he won't do it, but because
maybe for the first time in his life, he's really fascinated
by a girl. Debbie misreads, starts CLUCKING again.
Darren smiles, repeats her move effortlessly.
Without warning, Debbie leaps the gap, lands on the rafter
alongside Darren. As she struggles a bit for balance, Darren
reaches out and steadies her. As they come face to face.
DEBBIE
There definitely something
different about you. I just can't
figure it out.
DARREN
Is Sam your boyfriend?
91.
DEBBIE
He's my cousin.
DARREN
Oh...
A funny, awkward beat out on the rafter. Finally...
DARREN
We should get off this.
She nods, a bit smitten. Darren turns. As they start off...
DARREN
Chalk it up to lack of blood, but everything starts spinning.
DARREN'S POV
The area is like a big drain and he's whirling down it.
RAFTER
Darren legs go out and he falls off. As Debbie screams...
Darren CATCHES HOLD of the rafter just as he drops past it.
DEBBIE
Hold on.
Debbie grabs his arm. Evra starts out to help, but the
rafter CREAKS OMINOUSLY. He stops. Sam states the obvious.
SAM
I don't think it'll hold you, dude.
EVRA
Thanks for the heads up... Bro.
DARREN
(shakes it off)
It's okay. I'm okay.
Darren swings up a leg, hooks it over the rafter. A beat and
he's back on top. Debbie relieved. Evra backs up the way he
came and in a few seconds they're all safely off the rafter.
DEBBIE
I don't know how you hung on. I
couldn't have.
DARREN
You wouldn't have fallen in the
first place... I just got dizzy.
92.
DEBBIE
Maybe you need to eat something.
Darren looks at her. She has no idea.
EVRA
Well, the food's down on ground
level. Let's get out of here.
Sam and Debbie start off, Darren and Evra following. As Sam
and Debbie start down a ladder, Darren hangs back a beat.
DARREN
She's kind'of cool, huh? I mean,
for a girl.
EVRA
I like her. She asks a lot of
questions though.
DARREN
She's just curious.
EVRA
There's no such thing as 'just'
with a girl.
DARREN
What makes you such an expert?
EVRA
My snake's a girl.
CUT TO:
The sun peeps below the horizon.
CUT TO:
Bustling with activity. Nearly show time. Crepsley stands
by an open tent flap watching Darren cross camp. Not well.
DARREN
He stops as Sam and Debbie catch up with him.
SAM DEBBIE
Hey, Darren. Hi...
Darren's happy to see them.
DARREN
You guys are coming to the show
again tonight?
DEBBIE
Of course. Evra's doing his snake
act tonight.
DARREN
Oh, you came to see Evra.
DEBBIE
And you...
Darren smiles shyly at that.
SAM
I was hoping for Amanda Bynes.
Darren sees Crepsley watching him from the tent.
DARREN
Hey, I'll catch up with you later.
I got some stuff I gotta finish up.
94.
They watch as Darren heads off.
SAM
He's gonna be gone in another day
or two. Tonight's the last show.
DEBBIE
I know that. So?
SAM
So stop looking at him like you
love him.
DEBBIE
You're such an idiot, Sam.
TENT OPENING
Darren joins Crepsley, a little unsteady.
CREPSLEY
Look at you. You can barely stand.
DARREN
I'm fine.
CREPSLEY
You need to feed. You need blood..
DARREN
No! I won't let you hunt some poor
person down for me. I --
Crepsley grabs hold of Darren, hauls him into...
THE TENT
Dark, the inside walls richly embroidered. Medieval.
CREPSLEY
No need to hunt. There's someone
here willing to save you.
From the shadows: Madam Truska. Startlingly beautiful. She
steps up. Eyes on Darren, she offers Crepsley her wrist.
MADAM TRUSKA
By my own free will, Darren Shan.
As Crepsley's fingernail hovers, ready to open a vein.
Darren shakes his head. 'No'.
95.
CREPSLEY
Drink or you'll die.
DARREN
No. I can't. I'm human.
Crepsley releases Truska's arm.
CREPSLEY
You're not! And you'll be nothing!
Darren stands there as noble and sad as a boy could be.
DARREN
I am human. In my heart I am.
A great big TEAR rolls down Truska's cheek. That's the last
thing Crepsley needed to see. He's defeated.
CUT TO:
Crepsley falls sixty feet, lands flat on his back, as brick
and concrete rain on top of him...
CUT TO:
As PATRONS try to get as far as they can as quick as they
can. We see Steve duck out, blending in.
Mr. Tiny's Lincoln Continental pulls up. As Steve gets in...
CUT TO:
Mr. Tall, Evra, Debbie, Darren and Crepsley. Crepsley sets
Sam's body down in the grass. It's covered with one of Madam
Truska's tent silks. As Crepsley's eyes meet Darren's...
DARREN
(A WHISPER)
He was a good kid. It's weird, but
I remember things about him even
though I wasn't there when they
happened. Even though it's
impossible.
A moment as Crepsley nods sadly at this most singular boy.
CREPSLEY
His blood is in you.
MR. TALL
I'll deal with the police when they
come. What I'll say, I don't know.
DEBBIE
Say what happened. Some crazy guy
showed up. Sam was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.
They're all quiet a moment.
EVRA
He was brave.
DEBBIE
(SADLY)
For the only time in his life.
DARREN
He didn't die in vain.
A beat.
115.
MR. TALL
Time to fly or flit or whatever you
call it. The sun won't wait all
night.
CREPSLEY
Actually, that's exactly what it
does.
Mr. Tall manages a smile, considers the sky a moment.
MR. TALL
Time will tell what this night has
brought us.
CREPSLEY
Yes. Keep my coffin ready, would
you?
MR. TALL
Always.
As they exchange farewells, Debbie turns to Darren.
DEBBIE
Do you think we'll meet again?
DARREN
You never know.
As she hugs him tight, she whispers in his ear:
DEBBIE
I hope so...
DARREN
(WHISPERS BACK)
Hope is a good word. I hope so,
too.
And so goodbye. Darren and Crepsley start down the road.
DARREN
Where are we going?
CREPSLEY
To meet the Vampire Generals. War
clouds are forming. A storm is
coming. And I have a feeling
you're needed much more than I am.
116.
DARREN
So what are we waiting for? Let's
go.
Crepsley offers his hand.
CREPSLEY
Take my arm.
Darren shakes his head, doesn't need it.
He shimmers, flits into the night.
Crepsley laughs to himself. As he follows...
FADE TO BLACK.
