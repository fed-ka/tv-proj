inside. Big, uniformed guys assemble their weaponry -- a
19th century SWAT team. One man stands out as a leader,
older than the rest, INSPECTOR LESTRADE.
A man in plainclothes sits to one side of the officers:
DR. JOHN WATSON, physically as tough as anyone else in
the carriage, but with a more pensive air about him. A
thinking man of action.

Holmes enters through the door and stands at the top of a
stairwell. He takes a moment to recover; he's fit, but
not as fit as he used to be.
Holmes descends the stairwell to a door and a spiral
staircase beyond it. He stops at the doorway and peers
round the corner.
A lantern glow ascends the spiral stairway towards
Holmes. Holmes withdraws into the shadows behind the
door. A BOWLER-HATTED MAN ascends the stairs, carrying
the lantern and a gun.
He peers behind the door and holds the lantern up to the
shadows, but does not see Holmes, who has pulled his
black jacket up to conceal his face. The man swings the
lantern away again. He peers about, confused.
We see Holmes' eyes from the shadows, as he lowers his
jacket and thinks through his plan of attack.
HOLMES (V.O.)
Head cocked to the left, partial
deafness in right ear. First
point of attack.
PRE-VISUALIZATION IN VARI-SPEED
FOCUS ON the spot behind the man's right ear, just at the
top of the jaw -- the most vulnerable point. Holmes
launches a hammer blow, and we ramp from 24 fps to 400
fps (ULTRA SLOW MOTION) as he makes contact. The man's
head is thrown back as he spins round.
HOLMES (V.O.)
Then throat, paralyze vocal
chords, stop screaming.
BACK TO 24 fps. The man's mouth opens to cry out. We
RAMP BACK UP TO 400 fps as his Adam's Apple is struck
with a precision karate chop, strangling his scream.
HOLMES (V.O.)
Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker --
knuckles to liver.
BACK TO 24 fps, RAMPING TO 400 fps as a devastating
knuckle-punch to the liver doubles up the bowler-hatted
thug and crumples him to his knees.

SECOND-TIME ACTION - SUPER FAST REPEAT OF ABOVE
Holmes flashes out of the shadows, moving so fast that we
can barely see what he's doing.
THWACK! Hammer blow to ear.
CRACK! Karate chop to throat.
WHAP! Knuckle punch to liver.
BACK TO NORMAL MOTION as the man crumples to the ground,
Holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it
onto his own in one super fast move.
Holmes drags the battered man into the shadows, lifts his
lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase.
POV - BOTTOM OF THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE
Another bowler-hatted THUG approaches the bottom of the
staircase. He has seen the lantern light. He draws his
gun and approaches. Holmes places the lantern on the
post at the bottom of the bannister, ducks down into the
shadows.
THUG
What's goin' on, John?
When he gets no answer, the THUG points his gun to where
we saw Holmes hide.
But Holmes appears from the shadows behind the THUG,
reaches around him, grabs his gun hand and pistol-whips
him twice with his own gun, dropping him.
Holmes extracts a cigar from the Thug's top pocket and
sniffs it appreciatively.
HOLMES
Hhhmm, good cigar. Who do you
work for?
He jams the cigar in his own top pocket, picks up the
man's bowler and proceeds on, further down into the
crypts.

Holmes surveys the scene AT A DISTANCE, out of sight.
Eyes alive with intelligence, processing angles when --
A HEAVY HAND falls on his shoulder.
PULL BACK to
reveal --
(The following exchange in whispers.)
HOLMES
Watson.
Perfect timing.
WATSON
Nice hat.
HOLMES
Just got it.
Where's Lestrade?
WATSON
Getting his troops in formation.
Is that your blood or theirs?
HOLMES
I don't know.
It's an old shirt.
WATSON
You left this behind.
Watson hands him his pistol.
Holmes looks at it with
distaste, doesn't take it.
HOLMES
Knew I'd forgotten something.
Thought I'd left the stove on.
WATSON
You did.
HOLMES
Right.
Shall we?
This is what they do.
This is what they like.

Thugs dispatched, Holmes and Watson look down and see a
chilling sight.
A WOMAN IN WHITE LIES INSIDE A CRUDELY-PAINTED PENTACLE
(five-sided figure), lit with candles at each corner.
Her eyes roll back in her head, trance-like. A sword has
been placed at her feet.
A HOODED FIGURE KNEELS INSIDE A DOUBLE CIRCLE next to the
pentacle. This is LORD BLACKWOOD. We do not yet see his
face.
ANOTHER HOODED FIGURE stands on the edge of the ceremony,
shrouded in shadow. We do not see his face.
Suddenly, the woman rises up like a broken puppet, as if
pulled to her feet by invisible hands.
Some kind of ritual is about to climax.
Holmes and Watson head down, fast, not caring if they
make a noise or not. Their footsteps echo.

9A
The second hooded figure moves back and melts into the
shadows.
Still kneeling, still hooded, Blackwood chants softly,
Latin incantation repeating and repeating.
ON THE WOMAN as her lips start to move in time with the
incantation. This is spooky, real, powerful stuff.
Holmes and Watson leap from the stairs to Blackwood's
level.
Blackwood simply ignores them.
The Latin incantation
never stops.
Holmes is closer to the girl, Watson closer to Blackwood.
WATSON
The girl.
(CONTINUED)

The girl bends with alarming and mechanical suddenness,
picks up the sword and turns it on herself, ready to
plunge the point into her heart.
Holmes lunges, grabs the woman's arm, disarms her and
pulls her out of the pentacle. She collapses.
Simultaneously and eerily the candles extinguish and a
rush of air departs the tunnel.
Blackwood throws back his hood. We finally see his face.
His eyes are intense, he is tapped into something dark
and cruel.
Holmes and Watson are shocked at his identity.
WATSON
Lord Blackwood?!
Blackwood applauds softly, strangely.
BLACKWOOD
Well done, Holmes. And Watson as
well.
Watson raises his gun, trains it on Blackwood.
WATSON
Stay right there.
Blackwood raises his hands in front of him, almost
mockingly.
BLACKWOOD
Tell me, doctor, as a medical man,
how did you like my work?
(beat)
The fifth one was so scrawny, it
was over before I'd finished the
first incision.
That's more than Watson can take.
He moves in to pistol-
whip Blackwood --
-- is stopped suddenly by Holmes' hand grabbing his
collar.
HOLMES
No.
Watson struggles forward against Holmes' grip.
HOLMES
Look.

Holmes seems to be pointing at Blackwood.
Watson looks,
sees nothing.
HOLMES
Look.
Watson looks, and sees it and his eyes flare wide.
INCHES FROM WATSON'S RIGHT EYE is the needle-pointed end
of a QUIVERING PIECE OF HIGH-TENSILE WIRE, almost
invisible --
-- the other end held between Blackwood's hands.
A
really nasty concealed weapon.
One more step and Watson gets impaled in the eye.
BLACKWOOD
What a shame.
That would've been
fun.
We hear heavy boots on the balcony, as Lestrade and his
men finally appear.
POLICEMEN flood the area.
HOLMES
Impeccable timing, Lestrade.
LESTRADE
(vis Blackwood)
Is that -- ?
WATSON
It is.
HOLMES
(re: girl)
We've gone for the doctor...
(re: Blackwood)
And one for the rope.
LESTRADE
You should've waited for my help.
HOLMES
If I had, you'd be cleaning up a
corpse and chasing a rumor.
Besides, the girl's parents hired
me, not the Yard.
(a wry smile)
I can't imagine why they thought
you'd need any assistance.

Lestrade turns, frustrated. He watches his men yank
Blackwood out of his double circle, put chains on him,
while others carry the girl away on a stretcher. She's
still mouthing the incantation.
Lestrade eyes the double circle, the pentacle, shakes his
head, not understanding them.
Grudgingly, reluctantly, hating himself for needing to,
he turns to Holmes.
LESTRADE
What do you make of that?
HOLMES
Some kind of ceremony. Five girls
killed beneath cathedrals at the
height of the full moon.
(indicating)
The double circle's for his own
protection.
LESTRADE
London will breathe a sigh of
relief --
WATSON
-- at the excellent work of
Scotland Yard. As usual.
HOLMES
Bravo, Lestrade. Have a cigar.
Holmes sticks the villain's cigar in Lestrade's pocket
and --
-- A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER lifts his massive camera.
FLASH! An explosion of light and sparks as a 19th
century flashbulb pops. The SCENE is FROZEN bright for a

Watson takes a blood pressure cuff off CAPTAIN PHILIPS,
an OLDER GENTLEMAN who sports an array of medals. The
room is a tribute to military and medical order -- all is
neat and tidy, everything in its place.

CAPTAIN PHILIPS

He heads out, letting his aggravation show once his back

As Watson exits his apartment and moves down the hall,
MRS. HUDSON, his landlady, shoots up the stairs with the
paper. Her nerves are almost as bad as Captain Philips'.
MRS. HUDSON
(panting)
I won't go in there by myself, not
while he's in this state.
WATSON
You're not going in at all.
Which is a relief to Mrs. Hudson.
MRS. HUDSON
What will I do when you leave?
He'll burn the house down around
me. What will he do? Couldn't
you have a longer engagement?
WATSON
He just needs a new case, that's
all.
Captain Philips emerges from Watson's apartment, heads
towards them.
WATSON
I smell burning.
Mrs. Hudson's already-frayed nerves take a turn for the
worse. Watson takes the newspaper from her.
WATSON
Why don't you take Captain Philips
and give him a nice cup of tea.
MRS. HUDSON
Come on, Captain, let's go down.
It'll be quieter.
WATSON
(as they leave)
And perhaps some tea and bread up
here when you can.
Watson heads down the hallway to the last door. A
tendril of smoke wafts out from under it. Urgent.
(CONTINUED)

Nonetheless, Watson
stops, takes a deep breath, gathers
himself. Something
like this has happened before (is, in
fact, Holmes' usual
brand of chaos) the difference being,
now, that Watson is
sick to death of dealing with it.
Which doesn't mean he won't.
Newspaper in hand, Watson opens the door, pokes his head
in, cautiously. He sees --
14
14
Watson squeezes through the doorway to find that the
obstruction is Holmes who is sitting in the dark on a
chair, blocking the door, aiming a gun (with an odd
contraption fastened on its barrel) at the wall.
Unadulterated chaos. A series of FLAMING BULLET HOLES
blasted into the wall in the (ragged) initials "V.R."
WATSON
May I join you in the armory?
HOLMES
Please... Watson, I've been
working on a device which will
suppress the sound of a gunshot.
Watson heads towards the conservatory.
HOLMES
Please... Don't, don't, don't...
Watson pulls open the curtains allowing the light to pour
in.
WATSON
It needs work.
May I see?...
Watson passes him heading to the other side of the room
(possibly grabs the gun) picking up a pile of open
letters from a table.
HOLMES
Gently, gently, Watson...
Watson whips open more curtains and opens a window.
Holmes crawls on his hands and knees over to a table
where he finds his sunglasses and puts them on.
Watson sits on a chair and begins to leaf though the
letters.

give me work. The sooner the
better.
WATSON
Paper?
Watson hands Holmes the newspaper.
WATSON
Let's see, we have a letter here
from Mrs. Ramsey in Queen's Park --
her husband has gone missing.
HOLMES
He's in Belgium with the scullery
maid. Is it December?
WATSON
Yes, Holmes. Lady Radford reports
a missing emerald bracelet.
HOLMES
Insurance swindle. Lord Radford
likes fast women and slow ponies.
I see you're the attending
physician at Blackwood's hanging.
WATSON
Yes, it's our last case together
and I wanted to see it through to
the end.
Awkward pause.
Cough.
WATSON
Mr. Lewis is seeking...
Mrs. Hudson enters carrying a tray of bread and tea.
She

absentee landlady.

Mrs. Hudson crosses to Holmes and puts the tray before
him.
HOLMES
Is it poisoned, nanny?
MRS. HUDSON
There's enough of that in you
already.
She goes to remove an old tray from behind him.
HOLMES
Don't touch that. Everything is
in its proper place, as per usual.
She ignores him and removes the tray then crosses back
towards the door noticing a bulldog lying unconscious
under the table.
MRS. HUDSON
He's killed the dog... again.
Watson jumps up. His bulldog, GLADSTONE, lies on the
floor in a drugged stupor.
WATSON
What have you done to Gladstone
this time?
HOLMES
I was simply testing a new
anesthetic. He doesn't mind.
WATSON

Watson's finally had enough.

WATSON
So, you have nothing to do?
HOLMES
Nothing.
WATSON
Then you're free this evening.
HOLMES
Absolutely.
WATSON
For dinner.
HOLMES
Wonderful.
WATSON
The Royale.
HOLMES
My favorite.
WATSON
Mary's coming.
HOLMES
Not available.
WATSON
You're meeting her, Holmes.
HOLMES

For the first time, we see a hint of fear in his eyes.

Holmes sits in the center of a booth waiting for Watson
to arrive. He is quite uncomfortable in this setting.
WE SEE HIS OBSERVATIONS -- he picks up little pieces of
information from the other guests. He notices the
details on a pair of gentleman's cufflinks, the name on a
bottle of wine, a surreptitious argument between waiters.
It all becomes quite overbearing.
And then Watson and Mary arrive, talking, intent on each
other -- surprised when they realize Holmes is already
there.
WATSON
Holmes!
You're early.
HOLMES
Fashionably.
WATSON
May I present Miss Mary Morstan.
Holmes looks at MARY MORSTAN -- looks again. She's
beautiful, 30s, and clearly a woman worth marrying.
Holmes stands. She extends her hand.
HOLMES
My pleasure. For the life of me I
don't know why it's taken him so
long to get us properly
introduced.
Holmes gestures politely, they sit, Mary and Watson on
either side of him. There is a decanted bottle of wine
on the table.

They can seem a bit far-fetched
sometimes, though. Making these
grand assumptions out of tiny
details.
HOLMES

Oh, no no. The little details are
by far the most important. Take
Watson...
MARY
I intend to.
Watson likes that, Holmes less so -- a forced chuckle.
HOLMES
... see that walking-stick? A
rare African snakewood hiding a
blade of high-tensile steel. A
few were awarded to veterans of
the Afghan war, so I can assume
he's a decorated soldier. Strong,
brave, born to be a man of action.
And neat, like all military men.
Then I check his pockets... ah. A
stub from a boxing match. Now I
can infer he's a bit of a gambler.
(a wink)
I'd keep an eye on that, by the
way.
WATSON
Those days are behind me.
HOLMES
Yes, right behind you.
(leaning in to Mary)
He's cost us the rent more than
once.
Mary laughs.
MARY
With all due respect, Mr. Holmes,
you know him. But what about a
perfect stranger? What can you
tell about me?
Holmes and Watson exchange a glance -- not a good idea.
WATSON

What would madam care for this
evening?
Watson gives Holmes a hard look:
that's a bit much.
WATSON
Give us a few minutes, please.
He shakes his head, pours wine for all.
HOLMES
There are two drops on your ear...
India blue's nearly impossible to
wash off, anyway. A very
impetuous act by the boy, but
you're too experienced to react
rashly -- which is why the lady
you work for lent you that
necklace. It's from Asprey's,
flawless, not the gems of a
governess.

However, the jewels you're not

Both Watson and Mary scorch Holmes with their eyes.
Holmes pauses... pauses, then:
HOLMES
You were engaged.
Holmes' mind has gotten away from him.
He begins talking
faster, intensely focused, manic.
HOLMES
The ring is gone. But the lighter
skin where it sat suggests you
spent some time abroad wearing it
proudly.
As Holmes talks, Watson gets up, moves to help Mary to
her feet. They're leaving.
HOLMES
Or at least until someone informed
you of its true and rather modest
worth, at which point you broke
off the engagement and returned to
England for better prospects. A
doctor perhaps.
Mary throws Watson's wine in Holmes' face. The
restaurant goes silent. She turns to leave, turns back.
MARY
(low)
Right on all counts but one. I
didn't leave my fiance... he died.
Now she leaves --

WATSON
Well done, old man.
-- and Watson goes with her.
Holmes lets the wine drip down over him.
HOLMES
She's lovely.
Holmes is left at an empty table with wine running down
his face.
Their orders arrive -- an array of plates piled high.
The waiter puts them down, Holmes very carefully unfolds
his napkin and places it into the top of his shirt,
spaghetti style, takes his knife and fork and begins to
cut the meat -- then pauses, looks around.
HOLMES' POV
Happy couples eating, laughing, talking. Suddenly,
Holmes hears no words. He just sees their mouths moving.
The sound of silverware clinking and scraping on fine
china rises to an ORCHESTRAL ROAR --
-- which becomes the ROAR of a BLOOD-THIRSTY MOB as a
fist smashes into a face with a MEATY THUD.
1
NIGHT
Holmes staggers back from the blow. He tastes his own
blood from a split lip. It interests him.
He is stripped to the waist, all sinew and gristle. His
opponent, McMURDO -- huge but flabby -- bangs his fists
together and moves in.
Bets rage back and forth through the pressing CROWD.
HOLMES' POV
The room and the fight are calm -- the sounds muffled and
indistinct -- a complete sensory reversal of his
experience in the restaurant. This is soothing to him,
the ring is the only place where his mind stops racing.
(CONTINUED)
21.
15A-17 CONTINUED:
15A-17
He's able to feel, not just think.
He is utterly in the
moment.
Holmes' hawk-sharp gaze darts down from McMurdo's face to
his muscles as they flex, giving him just enough warning
to move his head so that a punch grazes him.
BACK TO SCENE
McMurdo throws a storm of punches, most of which Holmes
ducks or blocks. He throws nothing in return, sometimes
even drops his hands, just using his reflexes to protect
himself.
Once or twice, he reaches out and gently touches
McMurdo's face or throat, when the big man leaves an
obvious opening. But that's all. Holmes is completely
in control --
-- until he notices a face at ringside.
CLOSEUP ON A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
Early thirties, a look of pure intrigue in her eyes and a
slight smile on her lips as she watches the detective.
Holmes' POV returns to normal when he sees her, the sound
floods back into the room.
McMurdo senses his opponent's lapse in concentration and
steps on Holmes' foot, tramping him and --
He knocks Holmes down with a thunderous right.
Holmes rolls over, stands, shakes his head to clear the
cobwebs. He looks for the woman. She's gone. He turns
back to McMurdo, smiles.
HOLMES
Well done.
Thank you.
Holmes begins walking away.
McMURDO
Oi!
We ain't done here.
HOLMES
(walking away)
Not done. Finished. And as I
said, thank you, it was most
pleasurable.
(CONTINUED)
22.
15A-17 CONTINUED: (2)
15A-17
Face twisted in disgust, McMurdo strides forward and
SPITS CONTEMPTUOUSLY at Holmes, catching him on the back
of the head. The crowd falls silent.
Holmes stops.
Feels the back of his head, smells his
hand.
HOLMES
Hm.
Plymouth gin.
He turns.
Steps back into the ring.
The crowd applauds, working into a fever pitch, but from
Holmes' POV, all is calm. His eyes tick slowly, scanning
McMurdo, locking onto the big man's knee:
A little scar-tissue, nearly invisible.
As McMurdo
braces for combat --
Instantly Holmes unleashes a series of superfast moves,
incorporating exotic martial arts. The blinding
combination culminates with a spinning kick to the big
man's knee, which buckles altogether wrong.
McMurdo falls, over and out. Holmes is already turning
away before the giant hits the canvas.
He sees the crowd fall silent, they're not sure if they
like it, there really isn't any sport. He doesn't care.
Passing fellow fighters and flirty barmaids, Holmes
strides out of the bar, battered on the outside, soothed
inside. He grabs a bottle in his hand. Taking a huge
swig, he climbs the stairs towards the upstairs rooms.
18A
18A
A candle shivers, casting jagged shadows. A row of stone
cells. The sound of prisoners SCREAMING in the dark. A
full-scale riot is on.
Five GUARDS charge down the corridor, banging on the
doors to quiet the prisoners.
The GUARD CAPTAIN approaches a young guard, CHARLIE, who
is frozen on the spot.
GUARD CAPTAIN
Charlie, what the hell's going on
down here?

CHARLIE
It's Jack, he tried to stop
Blackwood from doing his spells.
And now he's in some kind of fit.
The Guard Captain continues around the corner. We see
another guard, JACK, lies convulsing on the floor.
GUARD CAPTAIN
(to the prisoners in
the cell next to
Blackwood)
You lot shut it!
(to the guards)
Charlie, get, down here and get
him to the infirmary.
The guards pick Charlie up and carry him away.

Blackwood sits dead center in the dark.
Eyes closed,
WHISPERING ungodly sounds.
On the walls the scrawls of a madman: wild symbols,
sketches of animals, a headless sphinx, an upside-down
cross. A hint of some method to his madness.
GUARD CAPTAIN
All right, Blackwood, what's this
all about?
BLACKWOOD
I've a request.
GUARD CAPTAIN
You don't get nothin' `til you
stop this devil nonsense. That's
a holy book --
Blackwood closes his eyes again, resumes his soft murmur.
GUARD CAPTAIN
(louder)
-- and you will respect it!
Blackwood starts whispering FASTER.
LOUDER.
GUARD CAPTAIN
Boy, you want me to muzzle you --
Suddenly, the Captain starts COUGHING. He's confused.
He coughs harder. Prisoners watch him stumble backwards.
(CONTINUED)
23A.

CONTINUED:

Blackwood keeps whispering.
The Captain falls to one
knee, keeps coughing.
Finally the Captain COUGHS SOMETHING UP, spits it out
onto the stone floor. He looks down, horrified:
It's a small CATHOLIC CROSS on a chain.
Prisoners start SHOUTING.
The RAVEN at Blackwood's
windowsill flutters away.
Other guards run up,
terrified.

GUARD #2
Get him to the infirmary, now!
Guards pull the Captain away. The remaining guard picks
up the cross, stares at Blackwood, chilled. Blackwood's
eyes snap open.
BLACKWOOD

The fighting is over and the pub is closing. Only a few
people remain cleaning up, mopping the beer and blood.
Watson enters fast, looks around, and moves upstairs.
22

Watson walks down a dingy hallway towards a door. With a
look of resignation, he opens the door to see Holmes
sitting alone in the sterile, barely furnished room.
Holmes faces the corner, playing scales on his VIOLIN.
On the table next to him, an upside down BEER STEIN and
an assortment of prescription medicine bottles.
Watson approaches, sees Holmes has bloodshot eyes from
lack of sleep.
Watson picks one of the medicine bottles which is open.
WATSON
You know this is for eye surgery?
HOLMES
I find that it lifts my spirits.
WATSON
It's a pathological amorbic
process, it increases tissue
change and weakness. And you know
what a black reaction comes on you
afterwards.
No answer. More scales. Watson approaches, sees Holmes
has bloodshot eyes from lack of sleep. The beer stein is
full of FLIES all buzzing about.

HOLMES
Look at this. If you play a
chromatic scale, they move
clockwise. As soon as you switch
to a pentatonic scale --
Holmes plays a different scale, the flies all stop
moving, stick to the glass.
WATSON
(faking interest)
Really? What about when you --
oops --
Watson picks up the glass, lets loose the flies. Holmes
looks up; Watson's already moving for the door, pissed.

WATSON
Let's go. Lestrade wants you at
Pentonville Prison.
HOLMES
That's your job, not mine.
WATSON
You're Blackwood's last request.
Says he has information he'll give
only to you.
But Watson's already out the door.
23
26
A pale, nervous GUARD leads Holmes down the shadowy
corridor. All the cells are now EMPTY.
HOLMES
Where are all the other prisoners?
GUARD
We had to move `em, sir, otherwise
we were going to have a riot on
our hands. There's something
about him... it's like he can get
inside your head.
Holmes can see how spooked the Guard is.
HOLMES
I'm sure I can find my own way
from here, if you have other
duties to attend to.
GUARD
Much obliged, sir. Thank you,
thank you.
The Guard high-tails it out of there.
27
27
Holmes approaches Blackwood's cell, strolling
insouciantly. No way this creep's getting to him. In
the shadows he can barely make out Blackwood, who's
reading aloud to himself. Holmes listens, getting
closer.
BLACKWOOD
QUOTE from Revelations tbd...
Blackwood pauses, turns, sees Holmes.
They share a smile -- two heavyweights sizing each other
up.
HOLMES
Love what you've done with the
place.
BLACKWOOD
Thank you for joining me.
(CONTINUED)

27
HOLMES
A small point of concern.
BLACKWOOD
How can I help?
HOLMES
I'd already followed the murders
with some interest and while my
heart went out to the families of
the victims, I couldn't but notice
a criminal mastery in the stroke
of your brush --
BLACKWOOD
You're too kind.
HOLMES
However, by comparison, your work
in the crypt was akin to a finger
painting.
Suddenly, Blackwood is right at the bars, close to
Holmes.
BLACKWOOD
So now you're curious as to
whether there's a larger game
afoot, and that's why you're
really here.
HOLMES
Actually, my friend will pronounce
you dead shortly and I thought I
might keep him company.
BLACKWOOD
Allow me to enlighten you. Your
mistake is to imagine that
anything earthly has led to this
moment. Your error in judgement
is to assume I've been holding the
brush at all -- I am merely the
channel.
Despite the bars between them, the men are close
together. Holmes seems to be studying Blackwood's ear.
(CONTINUED)

HOLMES
My only wish is that I'd caught
you earlier. I might have spared
five lives.
BLACKWOOD
Those lives were a necessity, a
sacrifice. Five otherwise
meaningless creatures called to
serve a greater purpose.
HOLMES
I wonder if they'd let Watson and
I dissect your brain -- after
you're hanged, of course. I'd
wager there's some deformity that
would be scientifically
significant. Then you would serve
a greater purpose, too.
BLACKWOOD
Mr. Holmes, you must widen your
gaze. I'm concerned you
underestimate the gravity of
coming events.
(beat)
For you and I are bound on a
journey that will twist the very
fabric of nature.
(beat)
I sense fragility beneath your
mask of logic, and it worries me.
Steel your mind, Holmes, I need
you.
Holmes steps back, shakes his head.
HOLMES
I must say, you've come a long way
down from the House of Lords.
BLACKWOOD
But I will rise again.
HOLMES
Bon voyage, Blackwood.
As Holmes walks away, Blackwood calls after him.
BLACKWOOD
Pay attention! Three more shall
die, and there is nothing you can
do to save them.

head.

Holmes walks down the corridor, meets Lestrade and a
PRIEST. The place is bustling with cops and officials.
LESTRADE
What did he want?
HOLMES
Nothing.
Holmes looks at the priest.
HOLMES
Don't think you're needed, Father.
Not for this one.

The room where the execution takes place is packed to the
rafters with senior officials, members of the government

REVEAL: Irene Adler sits on the stairs near Holmes' lab,
cracking walnuts. She stands and Holmes watches her
every move as she crosses to him. She leans down,
putting the walnuts in front of him and flashes him a
smile.
IRENE
Not that I'm pining for New
Jersey.
Irene gets up to cross the room. Only once her back is
turned does Holmes lever himself upright, stunned by this
intrusion. As soon as she clears he quickly moves over
to a concealed safe. He tests the door to make sure it's
still locked.
IRENE
I prefer to travel in the winter.
As she passes a small table that has been outfitted with
tea, dried fruit, olives, etc...
IRENE
I brought a few souvenirs. Dates
from Jordan, tea from Ceylon and
olives from Cyclades. I thought
we'd have a little tea party to
cheer us up.
Irene grabs a file from Holmes' desk.
IRENE
I came across this as I was
setting up.
Irene opens the file, flips through newspaper clippings
and police reports, her back to Holmes.
IRENE
Theft of Velasquez portrait from
the King of Spain... Missing naval
documents lead to resignation of
Bulgarian Prime Minister...
Scandalous affair ends engagement
of Hapsburg Prince to Romanov

Holmes stealthily turns down a photo of Irene, just
before she turns back to face him.

I don't see my name anywhere.
HOLMES
But your signature is clear.
Holmes reaches for Irene and pulls on a chain around her
neck, revealing and enormous diamond.
HOLMES
Ah, the Maharajah's missing
diamond. Another souvenir?
IRENE
He has a palace full of them.
Let's not dwell on the past.
They move to sit at the table.
IRENE
By the looks of things you're
between cases at the moment.
HOLMES
And you, husbands. No ring?
IRENE
He snored. I'm Irene Adler again
and I need your help to find
someone. There's nobody more
brilliant or who knows London
better than you. Plus, it's a
wonderful opportunity to see you
again.
TRACK INTO Irene's hypnotically beautiful eyes. Holmes
almost melts. Then, Irene reaches for something inside
her jacket and Holmes grabs her hand.
IRENE
Why are you so suspicious?
HOLMES
Should I answer chronologically or
alphabetically?
Irene pulls out an ENVELOPE.

IRENE
This is all the information you
need.
She hands him the envelope.

Just for a brief moment, she can't hide the anxiety in
her eyes.
IRENE
I'm my own man.

She stands and pulls out a large bag of coins.
HOLMES
Keep your money. I didn't say I'd
take the case.
She ignores him. Holmes examines the envelope. On it is
stamped the letterhead of the Grand Hotel. She pauses
behind him as she exits.
IRENE
They gave me our old room.
As she walks out she puts her photo back upright.
31

Irene descends the stairs just as Watson is coming in.
He lifts his hat, waits for her to pass --
IRENE
Hello, John.
-- does a speechless double-take when he sees who it is.
Irene keeps moving.
34.
32
Irene sits, turns to address a man-shaped shadow filling
the opposite corner of the carriage. Before she can
speak, a gesture from the shadow stills her. This is
PROFESSOR MORIARTY.
Irene is made to wait as Moriarty finishes writing a
complex mathematical equation (in astronomy), folds the
paper to reveal that it is addressed to THE ROYAL
ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY, cracks open the carriage window and
slides the folded paper partway out.
Someone waiting outside takes the paper, and their
footsteps clatter away.
Moriarty closes the window, and the carriage starts
moving. A full beat goes by before he turns to Irene,
finally prepared to engage with her.
MORIARTY
I assume he'll do it?
IRENE
Not for money, but for me.
I
wager he'll find our man within
twenty-four hours.
MORIARTY
You wager?

Suddenly, the coach comes to a halt, they lurch forward.

Holmes is washing his face in a basin on the other side
of the room, completely transformed now, utterly alive.
Watson approaches, very concerned, almost enraged.
WATSON
Look at you, I can't believe you
ran after her like a schoolboy
again. Leaping about, all
aflutter. Are you a masochist?
HOLMES
Allow me to explain.
WATSON
Don't you remember what she did to
you? She turned you inside out,
she made a proper idiot of you.
I'm sorry, you were going to
explain something...
HOLMES
Thank you, I --
WATSON
I know, instead of just being
tricked into being a witness at
her wedding like last time --
HOLMES
I don't believe --
WATSON
You dress up as clergyman and
actually perform the ceremony.
She'd love that.
HOLMES
You've had your fun.
This is a hopeless cause -- Watson won't stop.
WATSON
What's she after, anyway?

Holmes looks like he's had enough.
WATSON
Go on.
I won't interrupt.
HOLMES
It doesn't matter --
WATSON
What could she possibly need? An
alibi, a beard, a human canoe.
She can sit on your back and
paddle you up the Thames...
Holmes grabs the envelope back.
HOLMES
Regrettably, we've had our last
case together. Those are my
dates.
WATSON
I've already read it. Luke
Reordon, four foot ten, red hair,
missing two front teeth.
Holmes picks up his violin.
WATSON
Case solved! You're just not her
type, Holmes. She likes ginger
dwarfs.
HOLMES
Midget!
WATSON
So you agree?
HOLMES
No, I don't agree. It's more than
a technicality. You're
misrepresenting the dimensions of
foreshortened people.
WATSON
I've upset you, I can tell.
I've
said too much.

WATSON
Alright.
What were you just

HOLMES
Will you allow me to explain.
WATSON
That's what I've been trying to
do.
Holmes plucks his violin, the notes play over a FLASHBACK
of the previous scene, all from HOLMES' POINT OF VIEW.
36
36
We see Irene step out.
IRENE
Why don't I see myself out.
Once Irene leaves, he steps quickly to a window, and
looks out to see her walking down Baker Street, turning
down an alley. He bolts
into --
36A
36A
He sees Watson coming up the stairs. Before Watson can
speak, Holmes snatches his coat and runs down the other
end of the corridor. He JUMPS out the window to --
37
The man with the roses beckons Irene forward. Another
man steps in behind her, trapping her. He closes in to
grab her --
-- and WHAP!WHAP!WHAP! Gets three cosh-strikes across
the chin, dropping him immediately.
Still holding the roses, the man finds himself smacked up
against the bricks with Irene's hand over his mouth.
Quick as a snake, she slices upwards with a razor-sharp
knife, cutting his belt, then his clothes, all the way to
his collar. The move ends with Irene's finger over her
own mouth, signalling the mugger to be quiet. He obeys,
eyes bulging.
Irene frisks him expertly. She's mugging the mugger.
There is excitement in her eyes; this turns her on.

Oh, look, a wallet. Doesn't look

She takes both wallets, takes the roses --

These are lovely, thank you.

the floor.
On second thoughts, she turns back, takes his wallet too,
then leaves.

Holmes strums one more chord on his violin, thinking.
Irene's bag of money still sits on the table.
HOLMES
This man intrigues me, Watson.
He's got Adler on edge.
WATSON
Which is no mean feat.
HOLMES
She's intimidated, scared...
WATSON
And yet she works for him. That's
bad money. It's nothing to do
with me, but leave this case.
Holmes motions to the bills.
HOLMES
Well, I may not have a choice. A
man has to make a living. After
all, I'll be paying the rent
entirely on my own.
WATSON
You know what, I've had just about
enough --
HOLMES
Clarky!
VOICE (O.S.)
Mister Holmes, sir...?
He turns to see... CONSTABLE CLARK standing at the door.
Breathless, pale, scared.

Us means you.
CONSTABLE CLARK
It's Lord Blackwood, sir. It
appears he's come back from the
dead.
WATSON
Well that's clever seeing as how I
pronounced him dead myself.
CONSTABLE CLARK
A groundsman saw him walking
through the graves, just this
morning.
WATSON
I'll leave this one in your
capable hands. I have tea with
Mary and her parents this evening.
Watson walks into his office.
HOLMES
It is not my reputation at stake
here.
WATSON
Are you taking this seriously?
HOLMES
Like it or not, it's a matter of
professional integrity. No girl
wants to marry a doctor who can't
tell if a man's dead or not.
They all move to the exit.
HOLMES
Watson, you'd do well to hide your
medical certificates in case
they're revoked.
Clarky laughs.

Holmes winds his way up a twisting flight of creaky
stairs, finds a door with scratches on the keyhole.
Holmes takes out his knife and goes to work on the lock.
It is fiddly. It takes him a while. He kneels to get a
better angle with the knife.
CRACK! Watson's boot flashes past him as he KICKS the
door off its hinges. Off Holmes' pleased reaction, he
gestures them inside.
WATSON
I can spare ten minutes.
55
55
The squalid doorway opens into a series of dark rooms.
Watson lights a lamp which reveals details of an interior
that stops them both in their tracks:
From floor to ceiling, every available inch is covered in
writing, biblical Latin and Hebrew. Scrawled-on paper
and pages are tacked to walls and carved into the
plaster, crucifixes punctuate the yards of text and
collage, strange pagan charms hang from the ceiling.
HOLMES
He clearly felt something was
coming to get him.
WATSON
Something did.
They move further inside where there is a hallway and a
basic bedroom. Holmes inspects it, moves through a door.

HOLMES (O.S.)
Watson, come take a look at this --
Watson puts down what he was looking at, goes towards...

Instantly, Watson covers his nose with a handkerchief.
WATSON
(reeling)
Bloody hell...
The room is stacked with an alarming amount of scientific
and biological paraphernalia. Some of it gives off a
distinctly electrical hum. Ungodly fragments of limbs
and matter float in jars.
HOLMES
(inhaling deeply,
loving it)
Ammonium sulfate.
In the center of the room, something ROTTING. An
experiment generating a massive stench, a seething cloud
of flies. Holmes and Watson step closer to see:
DEAD FROGS. Eyes opened impossibly wide, their bodies
frozen in strange contortions, as if mid-death-rattle.
Holmes moves around the room, sniffing like a morbid
perfumer. Watson does his best not to gag.
HOLMES
(mumbles)
Phosphorous... Formaldehyde...
Hemlock...
WATSON
Appears he was attempting to
follow occult formula with
scientific practice.
Watson moves to the stove, sees a sheaf of BURNT PAPERS.
He digs through them, finds one piece not as burnt as the
rest. A CREST stamped on it, impossible to read.
Watson digs through his forensic bag, pulls out vials.
WATSON
Has he any hydrochloric acid?
(CONTINUED)

Holmes shuffles a few bottles, tosses one to Watson.
Watson catches it, starts pouring the acid, another
chemical on a clean sheet of paper.
Holmes senses something, moves into the next room.
He
stops at an open window, smells the CURTAINS:
HOLMES
Irene was here.
Watson presses the chemical-soaked paper onto the burnt
paper.
WATSON
Why would she hire you to find
him, if she planned to do the job
herself?
HOLMES
Maybe it's not the man she's
after, but something else.
Something he was working on?
WATSON
Ferrocyanide. Sucks the iron
right out of the ink. Long as
it's not too burnt...
Watson keeps rubbing the paper together, puts it by the
lantern. Slowly, faint words APPEAR on the blank page.
Ghostly chemistry. Watson sees the crest is Blackwood's.
WATSON
He worked for Blackwood.
Holmes gets a whiff of something, raises an eyebrow.
He
starts walking back to the other room.
HOLMES
There's one odor I can't put my
finger on. Sweet, almost like
perfume... or sugar....
(stops, sniffs)
Barley sugar.

The door WHIPS open.
TWO THUGS spill into the

They are followed by DREDGER, a huge man, just shy of
seven feet tall and pushing 400 pounds, slightly
deformed, who follows them into the room. He sucks on a
twisty stick of barley sugar (Victorian hard candy).
They stop, surprised to see Holmes and Watson.
Holmes'
eyes widen at the giant.
HOLMES
Hello, gentlemen.
Dredger is deadpan.
DREDGER
Sherlock Holmes.
HOLMES
Let me guess -- you're here to
extinguish any connection between
the man who lived here and the man
you work for? Curious you'd still
be running errands for a dead man.
DREDGER
(smiles)
You do like to talk.
The two thugs step toward Holmes and Watson.
HOLMES
You take them, I'll handle Mr.
Sweet tooth.
WATSON
Seems about fair.
Watson meets the men in the middle of the room, swinging
at them. As they dodge and swing back --
Holmes grabs a standing lamp, sliding it into his hand as
a weapon. He looks at Dredger, knows it won't make a
dent. He keeps moving, swinging the lamp toward a
CURTAIN. In the blink of an eye:
He WRAPS UP the curtain, ripping it down, bringing the
heavy STEEL ROD with it. He catches the rod, flipping it
so the curtain-rings rain to the floor.
He spins the rod expertly, SMASHING it into Dredger's
face. It stuns the giant for a beat, but quickly --
Dredger LUNGES forward, trapping the steel rod under his
arm. He grabs the rod and HURLS Holmes through the air,
sending him flying into --

Holmes crash-lands on the table, scattering all the
bottles and tools. He blinks, trying to gather his
senses. He sees Dredger incoming, as --
Watson tussles with the thugs, a bar-room brawler.
Head
butting one, kicking the other in the groin.
The men whip out knives. Watson ducks and dodges, blades
flashing on either side of him. One of the blades slices
his shirt, ripping off his pocket, so --
The ENGAGEMENT RING falls to the floor. One of the thugs
accidentally KICKS it, sending it across the ground.
As Watson follows the ring with his eyes, the first man
HURLS his knife. Watson just barely ducks the blade,
which SMACKS into the second thug, who falls. Watson
fights the first thug, as he scrambles toward the ring.
58A
58A
Dredger bears down on Holmes. Holmes reaches out for
some kind of weapon, anything he can grab. He snatches a
SHORT SHAFT. A truly pathetic weapon.
Dredger lurches toward Holmes, who swings the metal shaft
desperately, and... the shaft SPARKS.
ZAP! A flash of light and crackle, and Dredger gets an
ELECTRIC SHOCK that sends him flying back twenty feet --
58B
58B
Watson finishes off his thug and plucks the engagement
ring off the floor, just as --
Dredger flies through the air, SLAMMING into Watson,
knocking him off his feet, and knocking the ring away.
Holmes looks at the lightning rod in his hand, stunned by
the efficacy of the weapon.
Dredger tries to recover, climbing off of Watson.
Holmes
cranks his weapon. The rod sparks and hums.
Dredger pulls himself up with the help of a water pipe on
the wall. Holmes thinks quickly, then touches the other
end of the pipe with the rod, and ZZZAPPPP!!
The electrical current RUNS ALONG THE PIPE, and KNOCKS
Dredger back twenty more feet.

Watson spots the ring rolling towards the window, starts
running for it, frantic as --
Dredger rises, a clear change in his demeanor. He looks
at the sparking rod and races for the window as well.
Watson chases the engagement ring, bends down... just as
he's about to grab it...
THUD!
Dredger's massive foot STOMPS DOWN ON THE RING.
Dredger gives Watson a cruel smile, then leaps out the
window, landing atop a heap of coal. Watson glares as --
Holmes blasts past him, leaps out the window.
Watson
picks up the ring, sees:
The stone was knocked out of the setting, lost in the
floorboards, the rest of the ring mangled. Watson
darkens, grips his ruined ring, and heads out --

Dredger runs towards a SLIPWAY, which holds the
UNFINISHED HULL OF A LARGE SHIP. The vessel can't be far
from completion; it sits in a wheeled carriage designed
to see it smoothly into water.

The next morning. A giant holding cell where every shade
and aspect of Victorian villainy is corralled.
Holmes wakes up on a bench after a peaceful night's
sleep. Watson sits next to him, exhausted, bloodshot
eyes. He's reading his notebook, making the odd change
here and there.
Holmes looks up and sees Watson staring at him, shaking
his head.
WATSON
I haven't slept all night. I
deserve this... I clearly deserve
it. How could I ever be so
deluded as to believe I could meet
Mary's parents for tea once I let
myself be talked into going with
you. Now of course I'm in jail.
Holmes tries to wiggle his fingers which causes him
enough pain that he decides to bind them with Irene's
handkerchief.
HOLMES
(theatrically
indignant)
You're not implying that I am
responsible for our current
situation are you, Watson? We
were set upon, man, it was self-
defense.
Watson shakes the notebook in Holmes' face.
WATSON
I've used the time to review my
notes on our exploits of the last
seven months... and I've come to
the conclusion that I must be
suffering from to some profound
psychological aberration.

Why else would I continually allow
myself to be led into situations

withholding your intentions from
me?
HOLMES
You've never complained about my
methods before.
WATSON
I'm not complaining... I never
complain... I never complain about
your violin playing at three in
the morning, your mess, your lack
of hygiene, your stealing my
clothes, your setting our home on
fire!
HOLMES
That was an accident...
Watson challenges him with a look.
HOLMES
The first time WAS an accident...
BIG MAN (O.S.)
Remember me, boys? Put me away
for robbery a few years back?
Holmes turns and comes face-to-face with a dangerous-
looking man who has a few conspicuous WARTS on his face.
HOLMES
Ah, Mr. Brownlee. The fifteenth
most dangerous man in London.
Watson snaps at the man.
WATSON
Who could forget that face? I
told you, a little nitrate of
silver and the warts will be gone
in two weeks. Now, if you'll
excuse us!
Brownlee takes a swing at Watson. Holmes checks him and
drops Brownlee without missing a beat.

WATSON

Nor am I complaining about the
fact that you terrorize my
patients and perform outlandish
experiments on my dog.
HOLMES
Gladstone's my dog as well.
It's
in the interest of science.
WATSON
What I do take issue with is your
ruthless campaign to sabotage my
relationship with Mary.
HOLMES
Watson, I completely understand
now. You're overtired and feeling
a bit sensitive.
Watson now turns away, completely irritated at Holmes'
lack of understanding.
HOLMES
What you need is a rest. You and
I could go out to the countryside.
My brother Mycroft has a small
estate near Chichester. It has
marvelous grounds and a beautiful
folly. We could throw a lamb on
the spit.
Watson shakes his head in disbelief.
WATSON
If I were going to the country, I
would be going with my future
wife --
HOLMES
Certainly. We should have her
along. Let's get Gladstone out of
the house as well.
WATSON
No, Holmes. Not you.
Me and her.
You're not --
HOLMES
Invited? Now you're not making
any sense, Watson. Why would I
not be invited to my own brother's
country home?

He touches his own heart.
They hear a BILLYCLUB hit the
bars.
PRISON GUARD
John Watson?
You made bail.
Watson steps up. Holmes looks confused.
He steps
forward. But the Guard shakes his head.
PRISON GUARD
Just Watson.
As he slides open the bars, they see... MARY emerges from
behind the Guard. Watson stands for a beat between
Holmes and Mary. He must make a decision. And he does --
-- he leaves.
Holmes watches him walk out, then locks eyes with Mary.
She gives him a polite nod, turns, heads off with Watson.
The bars slide shut.
The mob surrounds Holmes.
He's never looked more alone.

He holds a black hood.
Holmes shrugs.
CUT TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
72
72
The hood is pulled off. Holmes takes in the scene, eyes
flicking around the room.
He's in a grand office where a man in his late 60s, SIR
THOMAS, rises from a pile of papers.
SIR THOMAS
Mr. Holmes, apologies for
summoning you like this. I'm sure
it's quite a mystery as to where
you are, and who I am.
HOLMES
As to where I am -- I was,
admittedly, lost for a moment
between Charing Cross and Holborn.
But I was saved by the bread shop
on Saffron Hill, the only bakers
to use a certain French glaze on
their loaves. After that, the
carriage forked left, then right,
a bump over the Fleet conduit --
need I go on?
Somewhat stunned, Sir Thomas shakes his head.
HOLMES
As to who you are -- that took
every ounce of my not-
inconsiderable experience and
skill... the letters on your desk
are addressed to Sir Thomas
Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice.
That would be your official title.
Who you realy are is another
matter entirely.
Sir Thomas is not in the mood for this -- but Holmes is
on a roll.
(CONTINUED)
56A.
72
CONTINUED:
72
HOLMES
Judging by the sacred Ox on your
ring, you're also the secret head
of the Temple of the Four Orders --
in whose headquarters we now
stand, on the northwest corner of
St. James Square.
(beat)
And as to the mystery -- the
mystery is why you bothered to
blindfold me in the first place.
SIR THOMAS
Yes, well, it's standard
procedure, I suppose.
Holmes shakes his head; what a massive lack of judgement
on their part.
STANDISH (O.S.)
I think we have the right man.
Holmes turns to see JOHN STANDISH and LORD COWARD
standing behind him. Standish is an American in his
sixties. Coward is a hard, ambitious man in his 30s.

SIR THOMAS
Sherlock Holmes, Ambassador
Standish from America and Lord
Coward, the Home Secretary.
Holmes acknowledges them -- barely -- as they enter.
He
isn't impressed by rank.
LORD COWARD
I suppose you already have some
notion as to the -- practices of
our Order?
HOLMES
Yes.
They're almost interesting.
SIR THOMAS
Be as skeptical as you like -- but
our secret systems have steered
the world towards the greater good
for centuries. The danger is that
they can also be exploited for
more nefarious purposes.
LORD COWARD
What some call the dark arts, or
practical magic.
Holmes looks around the room, sees FLAGS on the walls
with ancient symbols, variations of the SPHINX.
STANDISH
We know you're are a rationalist.
We don't ask you to share our
faith, only our fears.
HOLMES
Fear is the more infectious
condition.
(at Sir Thomas)
In this case, fear of your own
child.
That shocks them rigid.
HOLMES
Blackwood is your son, yes? You
have the same colored irises -- a
rare dark green, with diamond-
shaped hazel flecks --

(pointing at Sir
Thomas' ear)
-- plus identical outer ears, or
pinna, which only pass down
through the direct bloodline,
which would make you either
brothers, or, more likely, father
and son.
Stunned, the men consult silently, come to some sort of
conclusion. They turn back to Holmes. Sir Thomas seems
especially shaken.
SIR THOMAS
Very few people are privy to that
information, and we want to keep
it that way.
Sir Thomas opens a bureau, digs for something.
SIR THOMAS
He was conceived during one of our
rituals. His mother wasn't my
wife, but she shared our beliefs.
She was a powerful practitioner.
Though not enough to survive
giving birth to him.
Holmes is appalled and shows it.
SIR THOMAS
We were young. It was before we
fully understood the powers we
were dealing with.
HOLMES
Evidently.
SIR THOMAS
Death followed him wherever he
went, from his birth to arms he
made and sold. What family he had
tended to... not survive. No one
could prove anything of course,
but we all knew --
Sir Thomas hands Holmes a TINTYPE. A photograph from the
1860s. It's chilling: a death scene, a BODY covered by
a sheet. A man who's just fallen out a window. A TEN-
YEAR-OLD BOY -- young Lord Blackwood -- looks on.
SIR THOMAS
The boy was a curse. I didn't
have the courage either to take
him in or to --

STANDISH
All this is history. The present
and future are worse.
SIR THOMAS
We've done our best to stop him
ourselves, but it's not enough.
LORD COWARD
His power grows daily and
exponentially. His resurrection
is evidence of that. What he does
next will be far more dangerous --
SIR THOMAS
-- he's going to raise a force
that will alter the very course of
our world. We need you to find
him and stop him before he does.
LORD COWARD
We'll give you any assistance we
can. As Home Secretary, I have
considerable influence over the
police.
(beat)
Name your price.
Holmes looks at Coward with scathing disdain.
HOLMES
One of the great benefits of my
work is that I can pick and choose
my clients. I'll get him, but not
for you.
Holmes stalks out -- stops at the door, turns, fixes Sir
Thomas with a very bleak gaze.
HOLMES
I have one last question, Sir
Thomas.
SIR THOMAS
What is it?
Holmes holds up the tintype.
HOLMES
If the rest of his family's dead,
why are you still alive?
Holmes tosses the tintype onto a table, leaves.

Irene enters wearing a stunning evening dress. She
pauses glancing briefly around the room before sitting at
a mirrored dressing table. There's a decanter on the
table next to her from which she pours herself a glass of
wine.
Then she begins removing an impressive assortment of
WEAPONS hidden on her person: she pulls a stiletto from
her garter, a Derringer from her waistband (which she
puts down next to the wine glass). She pulls long thin
needles from her hair, lets her hair down. As she
continues...
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Holmes watching her from a shadowy
corner. He looks on silently until:
IRENE
If you're going to watch me take
my clothes off, Sherlock, the
least you can do is help me with
the buttons.
OR ALT:
IRENE
To watch a lady undress without
her permission is a criminal
offense, Sherlock, and could get
you into a lot of trouble...
They both eye the Derringer on the table.
IRENE
So why don't you come over here
and help me instead.
Holmes approaches her somewhat tentatively and reaches
for the top button on the back of her dress.
IRENE
That's better.
HOLMES
You can stop looking for Reardon.
IRENE
I knew I could count on you.

HOLMES
He was buried in Blackwood's tomb.
Irene is momentarily taken aback then recovers.
IRENE
Wonderful. Case closed then.
Your services are no longer
required.
Unbuttoning done, Holmes steps out to confront Irene.
HOLMES
I can't help wondering if your
employer will be as content with
these results? You were
uncharacteristically ill at ease
in his presence. Your hand was
trembling, your gaze was averted.
I couldn't see his face, but I
spotted chalk on his lapel. A
professor perhaps?
Irene gets up, walks behind a DRESSING SCREEN.
IRENE
(behind screen)
The eye patch was a nice touch.
HOLMES
But I've never known a professor
to carry a gun, and on such a
clever contraption.
IRENE (O.S.)
Let's not argue.
HOLMES
We're not.
Irene steps out, now wearing an array of Victorian
undergarments. Unfairly gorgeous. The huge DIAMOND
still around her neck. She moves back to the dressing
table.
Holmes won't look at her, refusing to get turned on.
HOLMES
Tell me who you're working for and
what he's after.
IRENE
That's nobody's business but my
own.
(CONTINUED)
61A.
75
CONTINUED: (2)

HOLMES
I disagree.
IRENE
You see, we are arguing.
Holmes gets closer and closer to Irene as he presses his
case vehemently.
HOLMES
When a man you ask me to find ends
up dead in the coffin of the most
notorious murderer since Jack the
Ripper and that murderer manages
to return from the dead, not only
is it my business, it's the
business of Scotland Yard and the
highest levels of the British
government. They will certainly
consider your reticence to be an
obstruction of justice. Which in
relation to a crime of this
magnitude would certainly mean
prison time.
IRENE
This wine is excellent.
You
should really try some.
Holmes notices her Derringer on the table next to the
wine bottle.
HOLMES
So what's it to be?
IRENE
Do we really have to decide now?
Irene reaches for the wine.
HOLMES
You're in over your head this
time, Irene.
Irene snatches up her gun.
Holmes grabs her arm.
BANG! A BULLET tears into his shoe, missing his toe.
Holmes snatches away the smoking Derringer. Irene kisses
him, hard and angry at first, becoming something else.
Another of the weapons in her arsenal, and the one that
disarms Holmes.
The kiss leads them to the bed.

Irene pulls him down to it.
He doesn't resist.

IRENE
Much better.
Irene has handcuffed him to the bed frame.
IRENE
This is the only way it could ever
work between us, Sherlock -- one
in shackles, the other with the
key.
She gets off him.
While he struggles on the bed, Irene walks casually
across the room. She starts putting on MAN'S CLOTHING.
She's in charge now.
IRENE
I've NEVER been in over my head.
HOLMES
How can you live like this --
always a fugitive.
She approaches, now dressed as a man, straddles him.
IRENE
But free. And on my own terms.
Just like you -- well, not you at
this exact moment --

She pulls at the front of his trousers, throws the
handcuff keys down there.
IRENE

Holmes has no retort. Irene takes the scarf off his
neck, moves to the doorway.
IRENE
If anyone asks, please let them
know that Mr. O'Neil didn't have
time to check out.

I hope you don't mind settling the
bill.

IRENE
What were you doing consorting

Sir Thomas enters the hall from outside, he looks tired.
His butler, PERIGRINE, stands there waiting for him.
PERIGRINE
Good evening, sir. Some figs and
honey with a nice glass of port?
I've prepared a tray.
SIR THOMAS
No thank you, Perigrine, I'm going

You won't let those figs go to

The CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS IN, drip, drip, drip.
The silence is broken all of a sudden when the tap is

wind.
Sir Thomas is overcome with panic, tries to sit up.

BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
Hello, Father...
Thomas blinks and sees that BLACKWOOD now sits in the
corner of the bathroom, lit in a sinister fashion.
Sir Thomas' eyes widen, the muscles stand out in his neck
as he fights paralysis. He slides back down, slowly.
BLACKWOOD
You can't fight it. It comes from
a power greater than yours. You
can only surrender.
The water flows over Sir Thomas, as Blackwood steps
closer and takes the sacred RING from his rigid finger.
BLACKWOOD
I've been imagining this moment
for a long time...
The water closes over his face. Sir Thomas stares up at
Blackwood, who watches him drown, slowly and surely.
BLACKWOOD

I thought it would be.

Carrying an armful of laundry, a MAID slips a pass-key
into a lock and opens the door...
... to be confronted by the snoring form of Holmes, still
handcuffed to the bed. Clothes in total disarray. Her

with shock, then grim recognition sets in.
HOLMES
Don't take this the wrong way, but

Baker Street himself this morning.
The coach stops.

Holmes is briefed by Constable Clark as they enter. As
Constable Clark continues in, Holmes swivels away --
CONSTABLE CLARK
We've checked everything. No sign
of a break-in. The Butler didn't
hear anything. The body was in
the tub, eyes wide open --
-- so that Const. Clark ends up talking to thin air.
CONSTABLE CLARK
(realizing Holmes
isn't there)
-- only his ring was missing.
He turns, puzzled, looking for Holmes, finds him right
back at the doorway, in full virtuoso detective mode.
Right now, right here is where Holmes is at his very best
-- this is, in fact, why he exists.
Holmes is satisfied by what he sees or finds, continues
into the bathroom, where a POLICE OFFICER stands over the
tub and Sir Thomas' body (covered with a blanket).
The tub has been drained. The kind of crime scene
violation that Holmes cannot get them to stop doing.

HOLMES
Why did you drain the water?
POLICE OFFICER
Out of common decency.
HOLMES

Crime is common, logic is rare.
The decent thing to do is catch
the killer, not provide comfort to
the corpse.
Neither the officer nor Clark have a response. Holmes
swivels, sees a JAR OF BATH SALTS on the table next to
the chair Blackwood sat in, leans over, scoops it up,
opens it, sniffs it.
HOLMES
Hmm...
Holmes thrusts the open jar under the Officer's nose.
HOLMES
What is that?
POLICE OFFICER
(smelling)
Uhhhh... jasmine?
HOLMES
Superb. I suspect this comes from
a larger cannister. It'll either
be in the pantry, high up where
it's warm and dry, or in a linen
closet with a vent. And,
Constable, you could check the
ground under the rear windows for
any footprints not your own.
Both cops hesitate -- Holmes is not their boss.
HOLMES
Data, data, data! I cannot make
bricks without clay!
The cops hurry away. Now Holmes can really get down to
work. This may mean he gets on his belly for a floor's-
eye-view, it may mean he looks down from a window sill.
Sometimes he hums or sings to himself.
Holmes is happy.
He glances around the room, sees the chair where
Blackwood was perched, sits in it himself.

POWDER and tosses the powder against the wall, revealing:

Alexander the Great at the Sphinx. He steps toward --
An ALTAR below the image of the Sphinx. On the altar,
four strange objects: a strand of human HAIR, a cow's
BONE, a large sharp FANG, and a FEATHER.
Holmes pockets the altar items and a couple pieces of
paper, just as --
78F

proudly hugging a 5 LB. CANNISTER OF JASMINE BATH SALTS.
They are startled by the secret room --

kneeling at the altar and singing to himself.
As soon as they arrive, Holmes springs to his feet and
walks out. Maybe he continues singing between words.

No, he's your friend from
Reordon's. He didn't survive
Dredger landing on him. Poor

consolation in the knowledge that
he can still be of service to his
fellow men.
Watson keeps packing. Holmes analyzes the body,
starting, of all places, with the outer elbows and
forearms of his coat.
Holmes grabs various instruments and other items from
Watson's newly-packed boxes. Frustrated, Watson snatches
them back as quickly as Holmes takes them out.

HOLMES
Though none of it human.
Watson slows down slightly. He keeps packing, trying to
resist the mystery, but it's not easy.
HOLMES
A butcher perhaps...?
What else?
Holmes cuts a lock of the man's hair, ignites it, studies
the color of the flame carefully. Watson wrinkles his
nose at the smell.
HOLMES
Hm -- predominantly yellow flame,
but with distinct green bursts.
Sulfurous. He spent lots of time
around industrial work and very
little around a wash basin.
Holmes uses a curved nail file to scrape dirt from under
the man's fingernails, rubs the evidence between his
fingers like a connoisseur.
HOLMES
Coal... river silt...
Watson slows down further, struggling.
HOLMES
That plus the river silt and
industrial slag on his trousers
puts him squarely in...
A hanging beat.
And Watson finally cracks, blurting out:
WATSON

Right. Well uh... best of luck

A brief nod, then Holmes is gone.
A beat as Watson continues packing. He heaves a box up,
moves for his suitcase. After a moment, he notices...
Holmes' PISTOL.
WATSON
Not again.
He picks it up. As he contemplates the weapon, he
becomes more serious. Then angry. He mouths a curse to

Standish comes up the stairs, wiping the raindrops off
his coat, trying to dry himself, as he enters --
83
83
A five-sided room. A few dozen venerable-looking
characters arrange themselves in seats. Lord Coward
stands next to a central throne. He stays standing as
they all sit -- all except STANDISH.
STANDISH
What's the meaning of this?
Why
did you call us here?
LORD COWARD
Sir Thomas is dead. Effective
immediately, I nominate Lord
Blackwood as head of the Order.
STANDISH
Are you mad, Coward? Have you any
idea what he's capable of?
BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
Of course he does. It's why he's
here.
Blackwood enters. He looks as if he's been to hell, and
come back more powerful than ever.
The crowd is stunned. Standish looks at Coward,
betrayed, turns to the others -- who are transfixed by
the sight of Blackwood suddenly kneeling before them.
BLACKWOOD
I am humbled. I am honored.

My powers and my assets --
munitions, shipping, industry --
they were given to me for a
purpose.

BLACKWOOD (CONT'D)
A magnificent and simple purpose.
A different future... a future
ruled by us.
Blackwood stands, prowls.
BLACKWOOD
You've made policy in secret for
centuries. Now, you'll make it
openly.
The men are beginning to like what they hear.
BLACKWOOD
The first act is a necessary one,
for without death there can be no
rebirth...
(beat)
... at noon tomorrow, we will take
the first step towards a new
chapter in history.
(beat)
England will know our power.
Then, the whole world will.
Across the Atlantic lies a colony
that was once ours, and will be
again. Their civil war weakened
them; their government is as
corrupt and ineffective as ours.
We'll take it from them.
(beat)
With their resources and our
power, we'll remake the world,
we'll create the future.
(beat)
Are you with me?
STANDISH
No, sir, we are not!
(turning to the
others)
The powers he's playing with are
beyond any man's control.
BLACKWOOD
They're limitless -- even death
holds no sway.
STANDISH
Help me stop him before it's too
late.
Nobody moves.
Blackwood smiles -- he's won.

In desperation, Standish pulls a gun.
But as he aims it
at Blackwood -
BLACKWOOD
I wouldn't do that.
-- he IGNITES, combusting with an impossible BLAST OF
BLINDING HOT FLAMES!
The men in the room reel backwards, shocked, terrified.
Flames consuming him, Standish flails, crashing through a
window out to --

Blackwood turns away from the window, surveys them.
They

Coward produces a brimming silver chalice.

Blackwood leans close to Coward:

Holmes walks towards Watson who stands in the doorway,
stopped in his tracks, spooked. Holmes catches up,
passing Watson into --
89
89
Shadows on shadows. Metal groans softly, like a
plaintive wail. The twisted blades of slaughterhouse
instruments glimmer in the darkness. A few RATS lay
dead. A truly creepy scene. Holmes and Watson move
through it.
As they go, Holmes notices rows of empty tables. He runs
his finger through a layer of dust, inspecting it.
Quiet:
HOLMES
They cleared something out of
here, not minutes ago...
Holmes slows, picks up one of the dead rats. He inspects
it, sees something on its skin, some kind of dark spore.
WATSON (O.S.)
Holmes.
You need to see this.
Holmes looks up, and sees Watson standing at a set of
doors.

Holmes pulls out a CIGAR-CUTTER, CLIPS off the rat's
TAIL, slipping it into his pocket, as he joins Watson,
stepping into --
90
90
A massive space with a maze of machinery full of deadly
gears and blades and saws, lifeless and silent for now.
An automated butchery on a grand scale. This is the
killing floor. Huge hooks hang from chain belts on an I-
beam, the ceiling, swaying softly, whispering in the
wind.
On the high walls, a huge number has been scrawled:
118.
WATSON
One-eighteen.
It's a date, a
time?
Holmes shakes his head, his eyes narrow, ticking.
HOLMES
It's chapter and verse.
Revelation 1:18. `I am He that
liveth, and was dead.'
Another voice completes the passage, echoing from above:
BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
`And behold, I am alive
forevermore, and have the keys of
hell and of death. Amen.'
Holmes and Watson follow the voice to see: BLACKWOOD in
the rafters. Shadows hang heavy around him. Holmes and
Watson react: this is the first time they've seen him in
the flesh.
BLACKWOOD
I cautioned you to accept that
this is beyond your control. Now
you see the truth for yourself.
The hooks in the ceiling are shivering softly, strangely.
Holmes tightens. Blackwood continues, his voice echoes,
as the hooks move through the air, gliding on a track.
BLACKWOOD
I want you to bear witness. At
noon tomorrow, the world as you
know it ends.
Watson pulls his gun, draws a bead on Blackwood, pulls
the trigger. Click. Misfire.

BLACKWOOD
And because I appreciate your
help, Holmes, I have a gift for
you.
Holmes starts climbing up towards Blackwood.
BLACKWOOD
(voice moving away)
She followed you. You led your
little lamb straight to slaughter.
Suddenly the whole machine starts up. Industrial-
strength loud, movement everywhere, empty hooks jerking
towards the processing line. Blades and gears and
grinders churn.
Watson's eyes go from Blackwood to --
A pig carcass as it comes swinging out of the killing
area, towards the SCORCHER (which scorches the carcasses
with live flame).
Then next carcass emerges --
-- not a carcass, Irene. She is alive, for now. She
hangs from two hooks on a track-line, her wrists shackled
above her, her mouth gagged.
Her eyes show terror until she sees them, then immense
relief for a moment, then determination.
Holmes looks up to see Blackwood's shadow retreating.
Decision time.
90A
90A
Holmes drops on to the machine and leaps from gear to
gear like stepping-stones. He heaves himself up to the
conveyor, where Irene is being pulled down the assembly
line towards the flames.
Watson sprints ahead, looking for a shut-off switch.
Holmes unties Irene's gag.
HOLMES
It's your turn in shackles this
time.
Ahead of them, the pig carcass is scorched in an
overwhelming burst of flame. Holmes and Irene are next.
(CONTINUED)
78.
90A

IRENE
But this time no key,
unfortunately.
Holmes notes that Irene's hands are shackled to separate
hooks. It's going to take two actions to free her.
The flame machine gurgles ominously, gearing up for the
next blast.
Watson sees a LEVER (PLEASE NOTE, NEW PROP!) that looks
promising, turns to head for it -- then his eyes focus on
a big canvas splatter cloth.
HOLMES
I've been meaning to ask you
something --
IRENE
Well, I'm a captive audience.
Watson rips down the splatter cloth, sprints to Holmes
and Irene, tosses the cloth across the conveyor belt to
Holmes --
-- who wraps them up in the thick cloth just before the
flames hit them.
The heat is excruciating -- but the cloth protects them.
Watson watches anxiously as the scorched cloth drops
away, revealing that Holmes and Irene made it -- just.
Relieved, Watson heads for the lever until "Oh Shit!" he
looks ahead --
-- sees the scorched pig carcass being dragged into a
long, conveyor-belt-wide SCALDING TANK OF BOILING WATER.
Decision time for Watson -- help Holmes and Irene, or try
the lever? He goes for the lever, reaches it, pushes it
all the way over --
-- and the belt speeds up with a jerk.
Watson hauls back on the lever, gets the belt back to the
original speed, looks around for another possible off
switch.
Just as they reach the scalding tank, Holmes jumps off
the belt (still opposite side to Watson), grabs Irene's
legs and pulls her horizontal just before she's dragged
into the boiling water.

She's suspended just above the boiling water, with Holmes
moving sideways, keeping pace with her.
IRENE
(trying her best not
to show the strain)
You had a question.
Holmes keeps hold of Irene's feet as he maneuvers past
various obstacles --
HOLMES
(same)
Ah. Yes. Do you still maintain
you're not in over your head?
IRENE
(panting)
In some countries steam is
considered excellent therapy for
the skin.
-- then is gouged in the back by a whirling fan belt,
jerks away, and Irene touches the water, SCREAMS.
Watson hears the scream, turns -- then sees something
again. It pisses him off. Fuck this machine.
When Holmes has Irene stable again:
IRENE
(weakly)
I have to say -- it's overrated.
Holmes has to admire her courage -- until he hears Watson
yelling at him.
Up ahead a huge pipe spews boiling water into the tank --
and impassable obstacle from Holmes' side of the conveyor
belt.
Watson points at the I-beam running above them.
Holmes
nods. Irene sees it, too.
Holmes helps her reach one foot, then other up to the I-
beam. She hooks her feet over it, and is suspended
upside down by her shackles and her feet --
-- and still heading for the pipe spewing boiling water.
Watson appears opposite Holmes, nods up at Irene.
She
swings off the I-beam, through the air --

-- and Watson catches her feet, pulls her horizontal,
facing the other way just in time to avoid the gush of
boiling water.
As Watson holds Irene, he spots a small, but significant-
looking SWITCH on the wall, painted red. (PLEASE NOTE,
NEW PROP!)
Watson helps Irene back onto the conveyor belt, leaves
her for Holmes to deal with, sprints for the switch.
Irene rides the belt upwards.
Holmes clambers the
equipment, following her.
Up ahead, the scorched, scalded pig carcass precedes
them.
Holmes darts through a trimming station, with CLEAVERS
HANGING FROM CHAINS, grabs one, jumps onto the belt,
catches up to Irene --
-- just as they both see the pig carcass CUT IN HALF
LENGTHWAYS BY A GIANT BANDSAW.
Holmes wastes no time, swings the meat cleaver at the
lock shackling Irene's left hand. Sparks fly as metal
kisses metal, but that's all. She's still shackled.
Then both of them see that Watson has reached the SWITCH.
Whew!
Watson looks at them with relief -- close one -- and
pulls the switch down with a really satisfying CLUNK!
A bank of lights goes out but the conveyor belt keeps
moving towards the giant band saw.
Shit a brick.
IRENE
Sherlock?
Now, she's showing nerves. So is Sherlock. He braces
himself on the belt, swings the cleaver with all his
might --
-- smashes the shackle lock.
Irene swings sideways violently, still shackled by her
right hand.
The bandsaw whines viciously.
Irene swings aside, just misses it.

Gets a free haircut.
Then Holmes is under her, lifting her high so that she
can free her right hand (a move not possible with both
shackles).
Irene unhooks herself, falls forward, taking Holmes with
her. They plummet downwards OUT OF FRAME.
Watson sprints towards where they fell, looks down --
-- sees them lying on a carpet of scorched, boiled, cut-
in-half pig carcasses. They're okay.
Watson shakes his head, turns, heads for the door,
looking for Blackwood.
Irene gives Holmes a sweet, grateful smile --
IRENE
Thank you so much. I owe you.
-- pulls a knife, gets up, heads after Watson.
Holmes
grabs her, stops her.
HOLMES
You owe me information.
(angry)
No more games, Irene.
She hears Watson opening the door to the dock. She looks
at Holmes, their eyes locking. Finally, the truth:
IRENE
Blackwood's manufactured large-
scale weapons for years. Lately
there've been rumors of something
new. More powerful than anything
else. And... magical. My job is
to find out if the rumors are
true.

Two POLICEMEN half-heartedly guard the end of a corridor.
One reads the paper. The headline: "AMERICAN AMBASSADOR
STANDISH BURNED ALIVE!"
Mary returns past them, having unsuccessfully washed away
tear-stained makeup; there is a smear on her cheek. The
two coppers nod respectfully.
Mary arrives at the windowed door of a private room,
reaches for the handle, pauses.
THROUGH THE GLASS, she sees a white-coated DOCTOR,
studying Watson's chart.
Mary stays at the door, unsure whether to enter or not.

The doctor injects Watson in the arm. The shot wakes
him. Watson tries to sit up, wincing with pain.
WATSON
What are you administering?
DOCTOR
Morphia. A sixth of a grain, for
the pain.
Watson looks at his wounded shoulder.
DOCTOR
There are four pieces of shrapnel.
The surgeon should be along
shortly.
Watson tries to sit up again.
This reveals that Mary has entered the room, stands back
respectfully, letting the Doctor do his work.
WATSON
Are they subcutaneous, or deeper?
DOCTOR
They're near the carotid artery.
WATSON
Get a mirror, I'll extract them
myself.
DOCTOR
I can't authorize that, Doctor.
We must first manage the pain and
combat the infection.
WATSON
I haven't time for that.
My
friend is in dire --
DOCTOR
Your friend? What kind of friend
takes a retired soldier, who's
served his country and deserves a

Mary steps towards the Doctor, eyes flashing.

The Doctor turns just outside the door, to face her.
She's suddenly very angry.

DOCTOR
Um... I'll check in on him again
shortly.

Holmes enters, disturbed, pained.
Emotions swirling.
He pulls out a newspaper with the story of Standish's
death, the pages and strange sacrificial offerings (bone,
hair, feather, fang) from Sir Thomas' house.
Gathering himself, Holmes stands in the middle of the
bare room and starts to lay out the clues he has on the
floor. The Ox bone directly in front of him (at 12
o'clock). The eagle feather to his right (at 3 o'clock).
The human hair behind him (at 6 o'clock) and the Lion's
fang to his left (at 9 o'clock).
Then with a piece of charcoal Holmes draws a circle
around each image and a circle directly in the center of
the four other circles. He then draws lines which join
the circles together in the shape of a cross.
In the center circle he draws a pentagram (using wax from
a burning candle?). Then he pours a ring of salt around
that circle.
He lights four candles (one at each point of the cross)
then stands in the center of the circle.
He pulls a pocket knife from his coat, opens the blade,
cuts his thumb and allows the drops of blood to drip onto
the ground just outside the circle.

Then he begins to chant. The words are eerily
reminiscent of Blackwood's chanting.
Suddenly one of the drops of blood bursts into flame in
mid-air -- as it hits the ground, the circle around
Holmes ignites, followed by a larger circle beyond that.
BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
And now it dawns on you, you begin
to recognize your part in his
play.
Holmes snaps around, Blackwood has appeared behind him
within the outer circle of flame.
BLACKWOOD
You see the path he chose for you.
Holmes sways, fuzzy.
He struggles to focus on Blackwood.

sixth under St. Paul's?
Holmes shakes his head, he can barely see straight.
BLACKWOOD
Unless I simply wanted to be
caught by the great Sherlock
Holmes...
Blackwood raises a sacrificial sword and swings at
Holmes' head.
BLACKWOOD
... so I could die on the biggest
stage of all. You made me what I

Holmes' eyes open and we see:
WATSON -- or some deathly version of his old friend -- is

HOLMES

Watson...?
Watson leans closer, into the light. A ghost or a man?
He gestures towards the diagram on the floor.
WATSON
Interesting artwork.
You look
bloody awful.
He writes something in his notebook. He is decidedly
alive, but with burn flashes, cuts and bruises. His arm
is in a sling. He's been through it.
In the b.g. Irene is at the fire heating some coffee.
HOLMES
What about the shrapnel in your
arm?
Watson shows him a piece of shrapnel --
WATSON
Took it out myself. Mary said I
had a lousy doctor.

They both smile.
United in agony.
HOLMES

them)
She brought you here?

Yes, oddly, it seems she might

Watson and Irene sit at a table, the SCREECH of a fiddle
now comes from upstairs.
The fiddler's owner -- from the pub's band -- is busy
getting drunk with the money he has acquired.
Irene arrives with two pints, puts one down in front of
him, sits opposite him with the other.
Watson looks from Irene to the pint with open suspicion.
Could it be poisoned? He wouldn't put it past her. But
then he decides that's absurd. He takes a sip.
IRENE
Oh, I poisoned that one.
WATSON
With your own venom no doubt.
IRENE
Better a snake than a lap dog.
WATSON
There's a new field in the
treatment of abnormal
personalities -- it's called
psychology. It appears you're

Flashes to various images of the sphinx that he's
observed over the course of the investigation.
He stands up and draws a sphinx in charcoal on the floor.
Then he moves to the ox bone -- a flash of Sir Thomas'
ring with the Ox crest. He draws an ox in charcoal.
Next to the ox bone Holmes writes -- Sir Thomas -- OX
ring.
Next, he moves to the feather -- a flash to an Eagle in
flight -- he quickly sketches an eagle. Then to an
American flag, then to Standish with his eagle-topped
cane. Next to the feather he writes America.
Then he moves to the hair. He draws a man's face. Flash
to Reordon's red hair. Next to it Holmes writes Man.
Then he moves to a Lion fang. He sketches out a lion --
he thinks -- BUT no flashes. Next to it he writes a big
question mark. Where? Who?
Holmes returns to his violin. Staring at the Lion fang

HOLMES

Holmes is excited, electric.
HOLMES
Now that you're sitting
comfortably, I shall begin. My
initial approach was far too
narrow. When Blackwood invited me
to Pentonville prison, he
suggested I widen my gaze and, at
minimum, I have done just that.
In fact, I may well have
reconciled thousands of years of
theological disparity. But that's
for another time. Blackwood's
method is based on a ritualistic
mystical system that has been
employed by The Temple of the Four
Orders for centuries. To fully
understand this system, to get
inside it, I re-enacted the
ceremony we interrupted in the
crypt... with a few enhancements
of my own.
WATSON
At minimum.
Watson and Irene shoot Holmes knowing looks.
HOLMES
My journey took me somewhat
further down the rabbit hole than
I had intended.
IRENE
Yes, your little white tail got
rather dirty.
HOLMES
But I have emerged enlightened...
The fraternity who silently
control the Empire, share the
belief with the Kings, Pharoahs,
and Emperors of old that the
Sphinx was a door to another
dimension, a gateway to
immeasurable power --

Ox, the Lion, the Eagle, and Man --

He points out the individual parts of the Sphinx,
covering other parts with his hand. We see the Ox body,
Lion paws, Eagle wings, Man's face.
HOLMES
In Sir Thomas' secret chamber I
found the bone of an ox, the tooth
of a lion, the feather of an
eagle, the hair of a man. Map!
Watson throws the map down on the floor, really flying
now.
HOLMES
Now, it is a widely held belief
that within the architecture of
the great cities are coded
references to this system.
He runs his finger over the map tracing the shape of a
cross...
Then he picks up the charcoal and (following the map)
draws a serpentine curve of the River Thames straight
through the middle of the cross that he drew on the
floor.
HOLMES
Since he rose from the grave,
Blackwood has killed three men.
Each murder was committed at a
location that has a direct
connection with the Temple,
therefore the System.

Reordon, the ginger midget,
represents Man. We found his body
here...
He points to a spot on the map south of the Thames. It
corresponds to the point on the cross that Holmes drew
that has the hair (6 o'clock).
HOLMES
Then Sir Thomas, Master of the
Temple, wore the ox ring... he
died here...
Again the spot Holmes points is directly north of the
river and corresponds to the point on the cross that has
the ox bone (12 o'clock).

HOLMES
Correspondingly, the map will tell
us the location of Blackwood's
final act. Right here.
Their eyes widen as they realize what they're seeing.
WATSON
Parliament.
IRENE
What is the meaning of this
circle?
Irene indicates the fifth circle Holmes has drawn -- the
point at which the other four come together. They look
to where it would correspond to on the map -- right in
the middle of the river.
HOLMES
It is the fifth element -- the
ethereal. That which can't yet be
known.

WATSON
It's right in the middle of the
River Thames.
BOOM! They hear doors slamming outside, boots echoing.
Irene looks out the window, sees POLICE OFFICERS flooding
the pub.
IRENE
Police.
Holmes folds up his piece of paper, hands it to Watson.
He quickly moves to a hatch in the floor. Flings it
open.
HOLMES
Ladies first.
Irene jumps down.
Watson is about to follow her down.
HOLMES
Follow these plans.
Watson goes down. It looks as though Holmes is about to
join them when Lestrade and his men burst into the room.
Holmes kicks the hatch closed and steps towards Lestrade.
102A
102A
Holmes races down the hall toward the back door, but the
door EXPLODES inward. Police fill the hall. Holmes
looks back, where more police block his path. He simply
raises his arms, and they drag him away.
103
103
Holmes sits battered, cuffed and bruised, though we can
see from his face that his spirits are unaffected by his
physical state. Tough-looking cops sit either side of
him, Lestrade sits opposite, shaking his head -- he can't
believe it's come to this. He looks at Holmes.
104
105
The place is a hive of activity, preparing for pomp and
circumstance, at its ceremonial best.
All of which is in stark contrast to the battered figure
of Holmes, who is marched through a series of doors and
checkpoints along the corridors of power by an angry-
looking Lestrade. They come to a door. Lestrade knocks.
106
106
The door is opened by Lord Coward, who's halfway through
putting on his official robes, and caught off guard by
the sight of Holmes cuffed (hands behind him) and flanked
by Lestrade and men.
LORD COWARD
Lestrade?
LESTRADE
Begging your pardon, m'lord, I
know it's unorthodox, but Mr.
Holmes has been making serious
accusations about you and the
order, sir.
Lestrade pulls his lapel, revealing a temple of four
orders pin.
HOLMES
Oh, that solves the great mystery
as to how you became inspector.
Lestrade punches Holmes.
LORD COWARD
I have five minutes before my next
engagement, why don't you regale
me with your stories of
conspiracies. Thank you,
Lestrade, if you could wait
outside.
Lestrade leaves and shuts the door.

HOLMES
I'm curious, Coward, did you
assist Blackwood in all the
murders or just the one I
prevented? Very distinctive those
hand-made shoes of yours, but the
price of quality is the unique
imprint they leave.
Coward walks towards his desk at one end of the room.
Holmes goes to warm himself by the fire at the other end.
HOLMES
Nonetheless, I confess to being
completely out-matched. I could
deduce very little from my
investigation.
Coward turns away for a moment -- Holmes subtly kicks a
log from the fire, it starts to smolder and fill the room
with smoke.
HOLMES
Fortunately, there is nothing more
stimulating than a case where
everything goes against you. How
many members of parliament do you
intend to murder at noon today?
(beat)
Man, ox, eagle, lion -- the lion
is parliament, isn't it?
Lord Coward slows, looks at Holmes in some astonishment.
LORD COWARD
Very clever. But it's not murder,
Mr. Holmes. It's mercy. We are
giving the weak masses a strong
shepherd. Don't you see it's for
their own good?
Smoke fills the room so that Holmes is concealed. Coward
pulls a gun from the desk and moves to the window. He
opens it to try and clear the smoke.
HOLMES
No, but I don't care much what you
think. I simply wanted to know
the location of Blackwood's final
ceremony, and now you have given
it to me.
LORD COWARD
I have told you nothing.

A pair of handcuffs, slide across the floor to Coward's
feet. He looks up and Holmes is nowhere to be found.
Coward quickly moves across the room to lock the door.

But your clothes say infinitely
more than you ever hope. The mud
smeared on your boots from where
you've been walking...
CLOSEUP ON COWARD'S CLOTHES
That he's changed out of and discarded in the corner of
the room. We see a --
SERIES OF FLASHBACKS
Coward's heel walking through mud.
HOLMES (V.O.)
A touch of red stock brick dust on
your knee, from where you've been
kneeling...
Coward's knee dropping to the ground.
HOLMES (V.O.)
A small bandage on your thumb from
where you've been vowing...
Coward performing a ritual.
HOLMES (V.O.)
A faint aroma of excrement, from
where you have been standing.
Coward, Blackwood, and the Temple members perform a
ritual around a pentagram in the SEWERS. The big
ceremonial sword is prominent.
LORD COWARD (V.O.)
It's a shame you made an enemy out
of Blackwood, Holmes, you would
have made a valuable ally. The
powers at our disposal are far
greater than you can imagine.
HOLMES (V.O.)
You and Blackwood laid the final
touches to your ceremony in the
sewers beneath parliament less
than an hour ago.

wise.
(turning to Holmes)
We take power at noon.
REVEAL Holmes sitting in a chair behind Coward.
HOLMES
Well there's no time to waste
then, is there?
Coward spins around and shoots at Holmes. He misses.
Holmes runs towards the open window as Coward fires
another shot.
With a single bound, Holmes leaps out of the window
Coward opened.
Coward runs to the window and sees Holmes DIVING toward
the river Thames, PLUMMETING down down down to --
107

110
Tanner's boat, unlit, floats at the opening to the
tunnel, on the edge of the darkness.
TANNER
Far as I can go.
Holmes and Watson leap off the boat into the mouth of the
sewer. Irene follows. (Watson has his SWORD STICK and a
GUN, Holmes has changed into the clothes Watson brought
for him.)
They move through the shadowy sewer tunnels, working
their way around corners and through junctions back under
the Houses of Parliament.

Holmes ducks around a corner, stops. Irene and Watson
flank him, standing in shadows. They look down a long
tunnel to:
The area where Coward and Blackwood were seen in the
flashback ceremony with the sword. But now:
Blackwood's THUGS patrol the area. In the center, the
pentagram remains. But there is something sitting in it,
a futuristic device:
HOLMES
Behold, Blackwood's magic.
A black glass cylinder is housed in a metal cradle with
electrodes on either side. It sits below a shattered
ceiling, bricks dismantled, exposing a VENTILATION PIPE.
Holmes looks back at Watson and Irene. Quiet:
HOLMES
A chemical weapon. The first of
its kind. Cyanide, to be precise.
WATSON
You can tell that from here?
HOLMES
No.
I can tell it from here.
He pulls something out of his pocket:
the RAT TAIL.
HOLMES
I snipped this off a rather
recumbent rat at the
slaughterhouse. Note the blue
discoloration, the faint smell of
bitter almonds. Tell-tale signs
of cyanide.
He points at the device and the exposed shaft over it.
HOLMES
That shaft leads directly to
Parliament. When activated, those
electrodes on either side will
send a charge converting the
cyanide powder into a gas.
IRENE
All of the people inside that
building --
WATSON
Will be dead at the strike of
noon.
(CONTINUED)
98.
110

HOLMES
As if by magic. There will be no
one left to stop Blackwood and his
followers from assuming control.
The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the shattered ceiling, UP a
channel, DOWN a bend, all the way through a GRATE TO --
110A
110A
Air blows UP through the grate. The chamber is now full
of Lords and senior Royals. As they start to take seats,
Lord Coward steps up, checks the crowd. He sees a shadow
up in the Lords' Gallery.

Holmes checks his watch.
HOLMES
Seven minutes to twelve...
They nod. Shoulder-to-shoulder, they move down the
tunnel, faster and faster.
Irene trails them closely.
Watson slides his sword stick into a loop on his belt.
It's there when he needs it, out of the way otherwise.
They draw their guns.
They burst into the area, completely surprising the three
thugs.
Watson pistol-whips the nearest.
Holmes front-kicks the
next.
The third thug looks down the barrels of both their guns
before he has a chance to fight or flee.
HOLMES
I wouldn't.
He doesn't. Irene comes in behind them and heads
straight for the device.
WATSON
I'll keep these under wraps.
(CONTINUED)
99.

112
HOLMES
Take this.
Holmes hands Watson his gun. Gun in each hand, Watson
herds the three thugs away from the device.
WATSON
Over there.
Sullen, but without much resistance, they move away (two
dragging the pistol-whipped one, who is out). Watson
turns so that he can watch the action at the device --
-- which puts his back to another tunnel.
Holmes joins Irene at the device. She grips her knife,
looking for a way to detach the CYLINDER from the CRADLE
(where electric coils and circuits pulse).
IRENE
I've never seen anything like it.
HOLMES
There's never been anything like
it. A totally wire-free weapon.
He must have some kind of remote
device sending a signal to the
receiver. Really quite --
She reaches out with her knife and... ZAP! Her blade
hits a coil, sparks flashing. Electrocuted, she drops
the knife, which falls into the cradle, surrounded by
humming, sparking coils.
Irene recoils, sees something past Holmes --
RACK PAST HOLMES TO WATSON --
Where DREDGER LOOMS OUT OF THE DARK BEHIND HIM, both
hands held high to grab the guns and smash Watson.
Before Irene can alert him, Watson's wrists are crushed
from behind. Dredger jerks Watson's arms sideways,
sending both guns spinning away --
-- Holmes's gun splashes into the sewer.
Dredger spins Watson around, head-butts him with a teeth-
rattling blow, flings Watson away like a discarded paper
cup.
Now unguarded, the two conscious thugs charge Holmes and
Irene.

Irene shoots one point blank with her Derringer, Holmes
crushes the other's larynx.
HOLMES

Keep at it.
Holmes goes for Dredger.
113
113
Lords and Royals sit in this august hall, waiting for the
session to begin. Coward looks up, and points, very
emphatically.
LORD COWARD
Look.
All eyes rise to see: BLACKWOOD, up in the Lords'
Gallery. The hall goes silent, staring at a ghost.
Blackwood is calm, commanding.
Voices rise; Blackwood's followers move to block the
doors as --
BONG! The first CHIME OF NOON from Big Ben.
114
114
The chime echoes. Dredger charges towards the device and
Irene. Holmes flies into him feet-first, deflecting him
for a moment.
It is now clear that Dredger's sole purpose is to protect
the device.
Irene sits at the device, trying to figure out how to
defuse it.
BONG!
The second chime resounds. Dredger grabs Holmes, thrusts
him upwards against the sewer roof, simultaneously
strangling him and hammering him against the bricks hard
enough to dislodge some.
Holmes lashes out with his feet at Dredger -- who doesn't
even bother to block anything. Holmes' kicks lose steam
as he loses air.
BONG!

IRENE
(without looking up)
Nine strokes left.
Dredger grins --
-- until he is earholed from behind by two bricks, swung
with full force by Watson.
Dredger drops Holmes, staggers back holding his bleeding
ears. Holmes heads back to Irene.
Watson draws the sword from his sword stick.
Deadly
enough, but not very big.
WATSON
You owe me for the ring.
Dredger backs off, as if scared of the sword -- but only
until he can reach up and pull Blackwood's ceremonial
sword down off a brick ledge. This is going to be more
uneven than usual.
BONG!
As Watson parries Dredger's massive slashes and thrusts
all around them, only just keeping Dredger at bay --
-- Holmes sees that the cylinder is welded onto the
cradle by two RODS. His eyes narrow, a plan forming.
HOLMES
Give me your gun. The bullets, I
need the bullets.
BONG!
The clock is ticking down.
Irene pops open her Derringer, slides the bullets into
Holmes' hand. He chops open the bullet casings with his
knife, pouring the gunpowder into --
-- the bowl of his pipe.
BONG!
Watson ducks a whooshing cut, lunges with his little
sword, sticks it into the meat of Dredger's bicep.
Dredger grunts angrily, flexes his bicep, rips the sword
out of Watson's grasp with his muscle, then he pulls it
out, snaps the blade against the wall like a twig, and
moves in to cut Watson in two with the ceremonial sword
from head to toe.
Watson dives desperately, gets a haircut from the sword --

While Watson is down, Dredger punts him into the sewer

Blackwood has lit four small red candles, placed them on
the balustrade in front of him. He calmly intones a
familiar chant. Lords are on their feet. Guards are
banging outside the doors, but the doors are locked.
Members of the Temple of Four Orders stand in front of
anyone going to open them.
116
116
Holmes rips the stem off his pipe, places the open end of
the bowl against the bolt holding the cylinders in place.
Shaped charge, Victorian-style.
HOLMES
We need a light, a match --
Irene's eyes narrow, seeing something in the cradle:
her
KNIFE. She rolls up a sleeve.
IRENE
Got it...
Which is when a blood-maddened Dredger thunders into them
both, arms wide, driving Holmes and Irene away from the
device --
-- hammering them into the wall with a mighty thud. Then
he braces his massive feet, angles his huge legs and
pushes, squeezes them against the wall like a human vice.
That's the extent of Dredger's plan, and it will work for
long enough because --

The batteries begin to fizz madly, cams turn, gears
ratchet past each other. Bad news.
WATSON (O.S.)
Hey!
Dredger turns his head so that he can see Watson, on his
belly, crawled from the sewer -- where he found HOLMES'
GUN.
BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! Four white phosphorous tracers
strobe through the sewer, stitch a line down Dredger's
back (aimed so as not to hit Holmes or Irene on the
through-and-through) --
-- and continue to burn inside Dredger. He lurches away,
eyes bulging, mouth wide with a silent scream.
BONG!
IRENE
Two!
Holmes and Irene stagger for the device.
Fizzling, boiling inside, the dying giant falls like a
tree.
Watson is face-down on the stones, still.
The gun falls
out of his limp hand.
Irene swipes her hand down into the cradle, just barely
avoiding the sparks and coils, snatching her blade,
and...
ZAP! A spark hits the blade, and she angles the blade,
redirecting the spark toward --
Holmes' pipe, which BLOWS WITH A VICIOUS CRACK!
The
shaped charge shears the steel rods.
Holmes and Irene reach for the cylinders.

BLACKWOOD
You seem surprised. Did you
really take me for a man who could
be dispatched like a truculent
servant? I see before me a
conspiracy of arrogant old men
puffed up by the illusion of their
own vainglory. In your hands this
once great parliament has become
nothing more than a drunken satyr,
stumbling about the world's stage
seeking nothing more than to
satiate your own lust and
gluttony; your britches stained by
the incontinence of your
hypocrisy. I will not sit idly by
and watch you violate the
innocence of the public trust as
you drag this great Empire into
the quagmire that your pride has
dug and filled with the excrement
of your corruption. I am here to
change all this.
He raises his hand and traces a circle in the air.
A
circle of flame erupts on the opposite wall.
BLACKWOOD
I am the fourth horseman.
He raises his hand and traces a triangle in the air.
A

BLACKWOOD
And my name to you is death.

The men wait for something mythic, magical.
And...
Nothing happens. Nothing at all. They look around.
Everyone is still standing. Coward looks confused,

I'm pretty sure I heard the last
chime.
Holmes looks down at his friend, relieved.
HOLMES
Yes, we made it. Just.
Watson rolls over, sits up.
He's done, had enough.
HOLMES
Come on, you've got to admit,
you're going to miss this.
WATSON
Which part? The stench of the
sewers or the broken bones?
(beat)
My ankle's done.
Watson looks around.
WATSON
Where's Irene?
Holmes turns, looks. The cylinders are gone, and so is
Irene. His face darkens. He misread her yet again.
WATSON
Holmes, I'm sorry...
Holmes sees Irene's lithe shadow moving fast into a maze
of tunnels. He motions to the disabled device.
HOLMES
Make sure Lestrade keeps it
intact.
Watson nods.
He watches Holmes sprint into the darkness,
face grim.

Blackwood flashes downward through the ornate official
understory of the Houses, heads for a staircase
spiralling even further down.

Irene hears Holmes' angry footsteps behind her, turns,
sees a flash of movement through the labyrinth of tunnels
and columns. She picks up speed.
CUT TO:
ANGLE FROM THE SIDE
Blackwood enters the maze of tunnels, hears, then sees
Irene sprint across the maze, about 500 yards away.
Then Holmes.
Blackwood follows them.
Sees something on the ground
ahead -- pauses.
It's WATSON'S SWORD STICK, flung there from the previous
action with Dredger.
Blackwood scoops it up.
118C

Panting, Irene runs along a tunnel that steps lower --
-- and pinches tighter. A large-diameter water pipe
angles down the tunnel wall, forcing Irene to turn
sideways to continue.
The sound of Holmes' footsteps drives her forward.
And then the tunnel ends. The water pipe breaks off
jaggedly in mid-air, next to Irene's head.
The continuation of the pipe passes through solid brick
at the end of the tunnel -- a dark, claustrophobic
gamble. Irene hesitates for a moment, then slithers into
the pipe, into the unknown.
118D
118D
The pipe angles down, damp, horrible. For a long moment
it is pitch black, pinched down. Irene's quick, anxious
breath the only point of reference.
This is as tight, subterranean, dark and nightmarishly
claustrophobic as it gets.
Then, almost imperceptibly, light.
We can make out Irene's determined profile. Light
increases, and so does Irene's rate of movement.

The pipe emerges from the brick wall in what looks to be
the cellar of a building. Stonework fairly new.
Dim daylight from an unseen opening shows a fixed ladder
heading upwards. Irene accelerates for it.

Holmes grimaces, enters the pipe, shimmies TOWARDS us.
An even tighter fit for him.

Irene -- climbing with one hand, cylinders in the other --

shoulder it aside. As fit and athletic as she is, this
is a grind.
118H

Irene emerges at the base of a dark, hollow building full
of construction equipment, and sees, yes --
-- more stairs, upward.
The only ready way out.
Gritting her teeth, chest heaving, Irene charges the
stairs --

fixed ladder and swarms up it. Anger lends him energy.

She surges for light -- a brick-framed window -- and --

As Watson and Mary climb the stairs, it becomes clear

Holmes had it made into an engagement ring.

Turns him around.
HOLMES
Good afternoon. I was trying to
deduce the manner in which
Blackwood survived his execution.
Clearing your good name, as it
were. But it had a surprisingly
soporific effect and I was carried
off in the arms of Morpheus, like
a caterpillar in a cocoon.
WATSON
Get on with it, Holmes.
HOLMES
Cleverly concealed in the
hangman's knot was a hook -- I
believe my legs have fallen
asleep. I should probably come
down.
MARY
Shouldn't you help him, John?
WATSON
I hate to stop when he's on a
roll. Do carry on, Holmes.
Watson and Mary walk by.
HOLMES
The executioner attached it to a
harness, thus allowing the weight
to be distributed around the waist
and the neck to remain intact. My
lord, I can't feel my cheeks.

Watson draws his sword.
WATSON
But none of this explains the lack

He finally uses his sword stick and slices Holmes down.
Holmes tumbles to the ground.
HOLMES
There is a toxin refined from the
nectar of the rhododendron
ponticum. It is quite infamous in
the region of Turkey bordering the
Black Sea for its ability to
induce an apparently mortal
paralysis. Enough to mislead a

HOLMES
What is it this time, Clarky?
CONSTABLE CLARK
It's one of our sergeants, sir.
He went missing in the sewers, the
day you stopped Lord Blackwood...
Well, a maintenance man found his

means of the same device we saw in the carriage scene
with Irene. We don't see his face.
CONSTABLE CLARK (V.O.)
Shot in the head.
BANG!

HOLMES
Were there powder burns on his
eyebrows?
Clarky nods.
CONSTABLE CLARK
He was shot at point-blank range.
Holmes and Watson look at each other -- complete change
of demeanor -- mind racing, looking concerned.
The dog has regained its vital signs.
WATSON
There's a brave boy... There,
there, everything's going to be
all right.
HOLMES
Where is Blackwood's device now?
CONSTABLE CLARK
The secret service has it, sir.
They've taken over the case.
CLOSEUP ON HOLMES AND WATSON
Piecing it together:
WATSON
I'd wager there's a piece missing.
HOLMES
Wager, Watson... I thought those
days were behind you. Excellent
deduction, however.
CUT TO:
FLASHBACK - THE POLICEMAN
removes a small receiver-like object from Blackwood's
device.
BACK TO PRESENT
Constable Clark nods.
Holmes pulls his coat on.

WATSON
Moriarty was after the machine not
the poison.
Holmes nods.
HOLMES
Blackwood's wire-free invention
was the game all along. It is
undoubtedly the more dangerous and
the more valuable of the two...
(wistful)
Irene was just a diversion.
Mary looks at Watson who is clearly trying to curb his
enthusiasm and interest.
A KNOCK.
The MAN from the stairs pokes his head in.
MAN
(to Watson)
I've loaded the last of your
boxes, sir.
Watson nods, the Driver exits.
Watson turns to Holmes.
WATSON
Well...
HOLMES
I'll walk out with you...
