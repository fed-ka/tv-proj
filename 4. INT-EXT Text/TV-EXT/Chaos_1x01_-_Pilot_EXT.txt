      ...at a remote desert airbase. BOOTS hit the tarmac as 
      SOLDIERS pile out of the copter, guiding dazed and emaciated 
      CIVILIAN passengers to safety. Heavily armed MILITARY POLICE 
      join the fray, their mood dispassionate as they scan the 
      faces of the civilians, zeroing in on--

      RICK MARTINEZ, mid 20s. Rick looks a wreck -- dehydrated, 
      battered and bruised. Despite this fact, he still manages to 
      radiate boyish good looks. His demeanor both serious-minded 
      and disarmingly innocent.

                                  MILITARY OFFICER
                      Martinez?!

                                  RICK
                    Yes! That s me!

      Rick extends his hand for a greeting. To his great surprise 
      the military officer slaps cuffs on him. 


      The sedan speeds across the Great Lawn. Billy grips the wheel 
      tightly, expertly dodging pedestrians, cyclists, picnickers. 

                                  BILLY
                          (to Rick)
                    You were saying?                                                         13.       


                                  RICK
                    -- oh, uh, that the ODS was meant as 
                    a return to a time when ops were 
                      identified, planned, and implemented 
                    by a single team-- 

      Billy muscles the wheel, while simultaneously slamming on the 
      brakes -- sending the car into a fishtail slide. The car 
      slots expertly into the flow of reverse traffic. 

                                  BILLY
                    That pretty much nails us, lad. The 
                    last of the old school spooks. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Right ahead... ahead... stop! 

      Billy screeches to a stop at the curb. Michael points to a 
      restaurant across the street. A lunch crowd has gathered at 
      the Valet Service. Michael points to a businessman, FAROOQ. 

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    There. Farooq.

                                  CASEY
                    We ve got trouble. Clarkson. 

      Billy points to a MAN (CLARKSON) a few feet behind Farooq.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Damn...

                                  RICK
                    Who s that?

                                  BILLY
                    Clarkson, Homeland Security. We re in 
                    potential hot water. Operating within 
                    U.S. Borders. Failing to share 
                      intelligence...

      Farooq climbs into his Mercedes. 

                                  CASEY
                    Target s on the move. 

      Michael digs an envelop from his pocket, hands it to Rick.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Make contact with Clarkson. Give him 
                    this copy of our coordination codes. 
                    And by all means treat him nicely-- 
                    he could have all our necks.                                                         14.       


      Billy swings Rick s door open. Rick jumps out. The others 
      speed off in pursuit of the businessman. Rick spots Clarkson 
      getting into his own car -- pulling into traffic.

      Rick chases him on foot. Rick darts across four lanes of 
      moving traffic-- dodging a UPS truck-- and in the process 
      getting clipped by the truck mirror. Rick goes flying. He 
      bounces off the sidewalk-- and right back onto his feet. 

      Rick finally catches Clarkson s car, pulling open the 
      passenger door as it rolls to a stop at a light. 


      Rick slams into the gutter. The Russian s car speeds off. 
      Rick struggles to his feet-- his shoulder seriously out of 
      whack. Billy s sedan pulls up. Billy leans out.

                                  BILLY
                    Get in.


      Rick hustles across the quad. A new day and a new shirt-- but 
      the same suit-- looking a bit tattered from his roll in the 
      gutter. As Rick enters the building he passes Blanke soaking 
      up the sun. Blanke cheerfully salutes.


      Michael drags Rick out of the rear entrance of the 
      restaurant. He pulls him down the dark alleyway.

                                  RICK
                    What are you doing?                                                         29.       


                                    MICHAEL
                    Saving your ass. You obviously don t 
                    know Fay works for Higgins.  

                                  RICK
                    She does?

                                    MICHAEL
                    She s his Primary Analyst. His right 
                    hand gal. His functioning brain. 
                          (then)
                    My guess is that Higgins knows that 
                    we know he sent you to spy on us.

                                  RICK
                    You think Fay was working me?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Have you stepped in front of a mirror 
                    lately? That woman is way out of your 
                    league. Why else would she be wining 
                    and dining a newby like you?

      Billy s sedan screeches to a stop beside them. 


      A C-130 Cargo Prop Plane touches down on a remote desert 
      airstrip and taxis to a stop.

      Michael is hit with a blast of desert heat as he cracks open 
      the door. He spots a man waiting on the tarmac. This is...

      VINCENT FURIO, 30s, their Italian contact. Vincent is decked 
      out in a sport coat and long pants. Evidently fashion trumps 
      comfort for this particular Italian. Standing alongside 
      Vincent, holding a serving tray covered with bottled cokes, 
      is his smallish Sudanese ASSISTANT.

      Vincent greets Michael and the others with hearty hugs as 
      they climb down the gangplank. Michael introduces Rick. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Vincent, this is Martinez. He s part 
                    of our team.

                                    VINCENT
                    A fourth Musketeer!? Fantastic! 

      Vincent embraces Rick. Then points to the cokes.

                                    VINCENT (CONT D)
                    Welcome! Enjoy a frosty beverage!

      Michael snags a couple of sodas, hands a bottle to Rick. The 
      baked glass burns his hands.

                                  RICK
                    Ow! They re hot.

                                    MICHAEL
                    We re six hundred miles from a 
                    working refrigerator. You re expected 
                    to use your imagination.


      The camp is a staging area for distributing aid supplies. We 
      see large crates of aid being loaded into U.N. supply trucks. 
      In an open tent we find Vincent and Michael hunched over a 
      folding table, reviewing a map, conversing in Italian. Billy 
      and Casey check their GPS system-- comparing their position 
      with their location on the map. Vincent indicates--                                                         40.       


                                    VINCENT
                    We are here-- approximately fourteen 
                      kilometers from the rebel encampment.

                                    MICHAEL
                    What can you tell us about the big 
                    boss?

      Michael lifts a photograph of a REBEL on horseback wearing 
      fatigues and designer shades, posing with an AK-47 on his 
      hip. A war criminal s equivalent of a publicity photo.

                                    VINCENT
                    His name is Doji. Ask him and he ll 
                    say he s waging war against Southern 
                    Sudan succession. Ask me and I say he 
                    murders, rapes and terrorizes for 
                    money. That said, you ll find him a 
                      reasonable fellow. 

                                    MICHAEL
                      Reasonable?

                                    VINCENT
                    This country has been locked in a 
                    civil war for fifty years. Savagery 
                    has become the national pastime. Doji 
                    is a brutal man, yes, but his 
                    judgement remains unclouded by 
                      intractable ideology. He is above all 
                      a profiteer. Much like every soul you 
                    will meet wandering in this desert. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    You have horses for us? 

                                    VINCENT
                    Yes, but I suggest you wait until 
                    sunset to begin your journey. It is 
                    suicide to travel in this heat.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Our hostage is on his fourth day 
                    without food or water. We travel 
                      immediately.

      Vincent shrugs: your funeral. 


      Blinding sun. Scorched earth. Four riders crest the horizon. 
      The horses limping along, smart enough to conserve energy in 
      the crippling heat. Billy notices Casey coating his nose and 
      cheeks with bright pink zinc sunscreen.                                                         41.       


                                  BILLY
                    That is a beautiful color on you. Not 
                    every man can pull off such a 
                      flamboyant under-shadow.

                                  CASEY
                    They confiscated my good sunscreen at 
                    the airport! That s why I hate-- hate 
                    flying commercial! 

      They ride along for a beat. Billy reads Rick s somber mood. 

                                  BILLY
                    Why the sour puss, lad? We re on 
                      horseback, riding through the heart 
                    of hell to save a man from certain 
                    death! This is heroes work! Trust me, 
                    when you re old and feeble...
                          (indicating Casey)
                    ... like Pink-Cheeks, you ll look 
                    back on these as happy days!

                                  RICK
                    It s just... you re not worried about 
                    what Higgins will do to us when we 
                    get back to the Agency?

      The question momentarily snuffs out the spark in Billy s eye. 
      He flicks his reins, hurrying his steed.

                                  BILLY
                    Only if we fail. Only if we fail...


      Michael has dismounted. He stands on a rise, holding a pair 
      of binoculars, studying the rebel camp in the valley below. 
      It looks like something out of a Mad Max movie. A patchwork 
      of stolen Red Cross tents and metal huts linked together by 
      rope and wire. Piles of rotting garbage ring the encampment. 

      A Land Cruiser outfitted with a Browning 50 caliber machine 
      gun, and filled with Rebels, speeds out of the camp.

      Michael lowers his binoculars. His mind racing, accessing his 
      options as his partners catch up to him. 

                                  BILLY
                    They re sending out a greeting party. 

      The Land Cruiser stops a couple of hundred yards away. A 
      silent standoff ensues. Michael makes a decision.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Casey, I want you to ride down and 
                    make contact. 
                                  (MORE)                                                         42.       

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    Inform them we re representatives 
                    from the paper. That we ve come to 
                    pay Aldridge s ransom.

                                  CASEY
                    Me? What about the kid? He s the one 
                    that speaks Arabic.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Which is why I can t risk having his 
                    head blown off before we settle into 
                      negotiations.

      Michael hands Casey a note.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    This will explain everything.

      Casey reluctantly takes the note. He gallops down the 
      embankment, arriving alongside the Rebels moments later. 

      From their distant viewpoint, Michael, Billy, and Rick watch 
      Casey hand the note to the Rebel Driver. The driver crumples 
      the note, unread, and tosses it back into his face. The 
      Rebels descend on Casey --pulling him from his horse. He s 
      savagely punched and kicked. 

      Casey crawls on his belly -- channeling Don Knotts -- seeking 
      refuge under the truck. Rick turns to the others, confused. 

                                  RICK
                    Human weapon?

                                    MICHAEL
                    No doubt he s picking his moment.

      Casey s dragged out by his feet-- kicking and squirming. A 
      rifle held to his head. He s a hostage now. The Rebels calmly 
      signal for the others to ride down.

                                  BILLY
                    At the risk of sounding disparaging, 
                    I sense we are not dealing with 
                      gentlemen.

                                      END OF ACT TWO                                                         43.       


                                          ACT THREE


      The guys are led by gunpoint into the camp. They are brought 
      to a young rebel KAYA(16) -- seated in a makeshift throne -- 
      which consists of a car seat bolted to wooden pallets. Kaya 
      shoulders an AK-47. He fires-- strafing a burned-out U.N. 
      truck. He lowers his rifle as they approach.

                                    MICHAEL
                          (to Rick)
                    Tell him we ve come to negotiate with 
                    Doji for the reporter s release.

      Rick translates. Speaking in Arabic. Kaya responds in kind.

                                  RICK
                    He says that we can t talk to Doji.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Why not?

      Rick asks the question. Kaya respond by aiming at a huge 
      mound of garbage. He FIRES, causing the vultures to scatter. 
      When they do we realize the birds were feasting on a human 
      body -- presumably that of the dead rebel leader, Doji.

      Kaya speaks to Rick. He again translates.

                                  RICK
                    He says his name is Kaya. And that he 
                    is in charge now. And that we must 
                    negotiate with him. 


      Billy, Casey, and Rick await outside with the Rebels. They 
      take a mental count of the full tent.

                                  BILLY
                          (to Rick)
                    Ask who all these people are.

      Rick questions Kaya. Kaya responds with a glimmer of pride. 

                                  RICK
                    Hostages.

      Kaya continues to speak. Rick translates.

                                  RICK (CONT D)
                    He says that we are safe to take 
                    Aldridge tomorrow. Provided we bring 
                    the rest of the money. He says that 
                    he wants us to see that he is a 
                      reasonable man. That he can be 
                    trusted to keep the other hostages 
                    alive, presuming ransoms are 
                      forthcoming.

      Kaya extends an open hand to Billy -- as if sealing the 
      business deal. Billy smiles, shakes Kaya s hand and says--

                                  BILLY
                    You, sir, are a royal cocksucker.                                                         47.       


      Kaya looks to Rick for a translation.

                                  RICK
                    I m going to stick with a simple 
                    thank you.


      The men ride away from the rebel camp, the mood somber, the 
      group clearly moved by their encounter with the hostages.

                                  BILLY
                    What was your head count back there?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Fourteen hostages. Chinese oil 
                      speculators. Dutch Aid workers. And 
                    our two missing French Agents. 

                                  CASEY
                    So, what are you thinking? We 
                    planning an extraction? 

                                    MICHAEL
                    The three of us against a hundred-
                    plus heavily armed rebels? Not a 
                    chance.

                                  RICK
                    Four.

                                    MICHAEL
                    What?

                                  RICK
                    There are four of us. You didn t 
                    count me. I m prepared to do 
                      whatever s required. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    As comforting as it is to know we 
                    might have the pleasure of dying in 
                    each other s arms... I still say no. 

                                  BILLY
                    You are aware that half of those poor 
                    souls will starve before their 
                    releases are negotiated.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m not blind to that fact. But the 
                    four of us mounting a suicide mission 
                    won t solve that problem.                                                         48.       


                                  RICK
                    Then I say we contact The Agency -- 
                    share our Intel. There are multiple 
                    lives at stake now--

                                    MICHAEL
                    --which is exactly why they won t 
                    take action. The CIA s not in the 
                    business of rescuing foreigners, 
                      remember?! 

      Rick s sense of outrage getting the best of him, snaps-- 

                                  RICK
                    So your recommendation is  inaction. 

      Michael spins on Rick, all semblance of charm and wit 
      dropping away. His eyes flare from a rarely tapped rage. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Never, ever challenge my courage! I 
                    have not given up on those hostages! 
                    To even suggest otherwise--!

      Michael chokes off his outburst. Which nevertheless places 
      Rick back in his saddle. 


      Our guys sit around a campfire, contemplating the day. 
      Michael has a stack of files in his lap-- which he scans. 
      Rick finally musters the courage to address Michael.

                                  RICK
                    I m sorry about, you know, what I 
                    said back there.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Don t sweat it. I recognize you were 
                    born stupid. But I also recognize 
                    that you are capable of learning.

                                  RICK
                    I d like to believe I am.
                          (off reports)
                    What s that?

                                    MICHAEL
                    My weekend reading. Internal reports.

                                  RICK
                    You dragged those this whole way?                                                         49.       


                                    MICHAEL
                    I pride myself on keeping up. In case 
                    you didn t know, there are over 
                    seventeen thousand employees at the 
                    CIA. Less than a thousand are core 
                      operatives, like us. Gathering vital 
                    human intel. The rest of them sit 
                    back home generating threat reports. 
                          (off reports)
                    Somewhere in all this clutter-- rests 
                    the oil that will light our lamp.

                                  RICK
                    Lamp?

                                    MICHAEL
                    The lamp we -- the operatives of the 
                    ODS hold high-- as a beacon -- 
                    guiding our once proud agency on its 
                    return to greatness. 

      Billy and Casey share a look: clearly no fans of Michael s 
        sermonizing.

                                  BILLY
                    You know, you re not scoring many 
                    sanity points with the kid by 
                    rambling on like a Knight of the 
                    Round Table.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I think he gets my meaning.

                                  RICK
                    You chose to prioritize results over 
                    risks. I imagine there was a time in 
                    The Agency when they called that 
                      leadership.

      Michael nods, satisfied with the response.

                                  BILLY
                    Well, since we re all in love again, 
                    I think it s high time we gave Mr. 
                    Martinez his present.

      Billy pulls a flash-card from his pocket, tosses it to Rick. 

                                  RICK
                    What s this?

                                  BILLY
                    The pictures of your Russian tryst. 
                    We relinquish ownership. 
                                  (MORE)                                                         50.       

                                  BILLY (CONT'D)
                    You proved yourself to be a man of 
                    action back in that camp. You have 
                    proved yourself worthy of our 
                    respect. You, sir, have earned your 
                    freedom. 

      This unexpected gift catches Rick off guard. It means more to 
      him than he ever expected.

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                    Today I witnessed the bravest thing 
                    I ve ever seen in my life. I watched 
                    a man eat a deadly scorpion. A live 
                    poisonous scorpion. 

                                  RICK
                    Thanks, but it was an Emperor 
                    Scorpion. And they re not lethal. I 
                    know, I had one as a pet. Point of 
                    fact-- they re considered a great 
                    delicacy in parts of central Asia.
                          (then)
                    Although I found the experience... 
                      unpleasant. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    I suggest you destroy that flash-card 
                    at the first possible opportunity.

      Rick thinks, then tosses the flash-card into the fire. Billy 
      pulls a flask from his backpack.. 

                                  BILLY
                    I propose a toast. To Senor Rick -- 
                    mission MVP!
                          (to Rick)
                    First honors.

      Rick accepts the flask, feeling compelled to say something. 
      Filled with emotion, flush with a feeling of camaraderie.

                                  RICK
                    Your respect... it means a lot. More 
                    than you can know. The thing is, I 
                    didn t join the CIA to write reports 
                    or earn a pension. I joined to help 
                    make the world safer. 
                          (looking to Billy)
                    I joined to do  heroes work.  When we 
                    get back to The Agency-- and I have 
                    to report to Director Higgins-- I 
                    will tell him that I was proud to 
                    have served with the ODS. If only 
                    even for a week...                                                         51.       


      Rick takes a swig from the flask. He enjoys the burn.

                                  RICK (CONT D)
                    That... is... good... stuff.

      Rick turns to hand the flask to Michael. Then, recoils, as if 
      he d just received an invisible punch.

      Rick s eyes roll back in his head and he drops to the ground -
      - knocked out cold. Drugged by his fellow operatives. Michael 
      and Casey share a look: the plan worked. Billy leans over to 
      check Rick s pulse and confirm he s okay.

                                  BILLY
                          (to no one in particular)
                    Sometimes we can be right bastards.


      Morning light is just breaking over the rebel camp. A Rebel 
      Sentry spots a horse approaching the camp -- and Rick, 
        unconscious, strapped to its back. 

      MOMENTS LATER. Rick is cut loose. He falls to the ground. 
      Landing with a thud-- which jars him awake. Rick struggles to 
      make sense of where he is-- finally piecing together that 
      he s back in the grasp of the Rebels. Shit.

      Kaya leans over Rick. He asks-- 

                                  KAYA
                          (subtitled)
                    Where are your friends?

                                  RICK
                          (subtitled)
                    Damn good question.

                                      END OF ACT THREE                                                         52.       


                                          ACT FOUR


      The hour is late. A few open fires provide what little light 
      there is in the rebel camp. With the exception of a wandering 
      sentry or two, there is no other sign of movement.


      The Rebels are tasered by the mist. Some writhe in pain-- 
      others knocked unconscious. All drop like flies.

      In the next instant, Soldiers begin to sweep through the 
      camp, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, securing incapacitated 
      Rebels. Gunfire rings out.


      Casey leads Rick and the Hostages past the outskirts of camp, 
      and into dessert night. They begin to draw GUNFIRE from 
      within the camp. 

                                  CASEY
                    Down! Down!

      Casey hurries the Hostages into a slight ravine. He and Rick 
      piling in after them, as--

      The Land Cruiser blasts out of the darkness, zeroing in on 
      the group, the 50 millimeter peppering the night with MUZZLE 
      FLASHES. Casey considers his puny handgun. He turns to Rick.

                                  CASEY (CONT D)
                    What s the Arabic word for surrender?

                                  RICK
                    Islam.

                                  CASEY
                    Islam? 

                                  RICK
                    It means surrender-- as in surrender 
                    to God.

                                  CASEY
                    Well, I recommend you start shouting 
                    it.

      And with that Casey sprints off into the darkness. It takes 
      Rick a moment to realize that he s just been abandoned.

                                  RICK
                    Really?! You re running away?! What 
                    happened to the human weapon?! Huh?! 
                    You know, I knew you would suck!! 
                    This comes as no surprise!!

      Rick thrusts his arms high as the Land Cruiser, filled with 
      Rebels rolls up. Rick shouts:

                                  RICK (CONT D)
                    Ehna Islam!!! Ehna Islam!!!

      The Rebels command the Hostages to join Rick. One by one they 
      pull themselves off the ground. Their capture secured, when--

      A BLUR catches Rick s eye a split second before-- Casey leaps 
      out of the darkness --and onto the truck -- fists and feet 
      moving in concert, taking out the Rebels in an explosive, 
      deadly display of hand-to-hand combat.                                                          56.       


      Rebel bodies topple from their perch on the truck. And within 
      seconds Casey had dispatched the lot and taken control of the 
      Land Cruiser. At long last Rick has seen the  human weapon  
      in action. He is dutifully impressed. 

      Michael and Billy arrive on foot. 

                                    MICHAEL
                          (re hostages)
                    Any injuries?

                                  RICK
                    No, we re good.

      The sand beneath their feet begins to STIR -- the rescue 
      copter drawing near. Michael and Billy climb into the Land 
      Cruiser-- with Billy manning the 50 millimeter. Michael 
      shouts to be heard over the copter roar.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Keep them safe! We ll provide all the 
                    cover we can!

      Casey turns the Land Cruiser and steers back toward the rebel 
      camp. The sound of a fierce FIREFIGHT echoing in the darkness 
      as our fearless trio disappears -- back into the breach. 

      Rick shields his eyes, buffeted by sand, looking up as the 
      Blackhawk s blinding SPOTLIGHT shines down on him, and we--

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      Where Rick is STRUCK in the chest with the very same bag.

      WIDER: Our guys are now deep in the Cambodian jungles. The 
      air thick with moisture and bugs. We discover they are in the 
      process of unloading supplies from their SUV -- which is 
      stuck in a deep muddy rut, on a narrow dirt road.  

      Billy notices Casey has tucked his pants inside of his knee-
      high gym socks.  He looks suitable ridiculous.

                                  BILLY
                    Jungle fever already set in?

                                  CASEY
                    You won t be laughing when we 
                    encounter leeches.  And we will 
                    encounter leeches.

      The team gathers in front of the SUV. They take in the road 
      ahead, which disappears into dark, dense jungle overgrowth.

                                    MICHAEL
                    My guess is we have about a two mile 
                    hump. 

      Before they can take a step-- a CRASHING NOISE booms from the 
      jungle. Something HUGE is coming at our guys, snapping bamboo 
      trees like blades of grass. They brace for an attack, armed 
      only with luggage as-- 

      -- an elephant steps out onto the narrow road. On top of the 
      elephant sits a CAMBODIAN MAN, armed with a semi-automatic. A 
      dozen more ARMED MEN step out of the brush, guns trained on 
      our team. A tense beat. Billy turns to Rick.

                                  BILLY
                    You ve got hostage experience.  
                    What s our move?

      Off of Rick, poised for battle, mind racing, loving it--
