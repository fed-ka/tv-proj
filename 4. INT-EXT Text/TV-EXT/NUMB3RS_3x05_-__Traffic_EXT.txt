                Yeah, from the reviews I was 
                  expecting more of a comedy.

                              ANDY (O.S.)
                  I thought it was pretty good.

                  Teenagers like boring movies.

                              ANDY (O.S.)
                You only like cartoons. 

                              PETE (O.S.)
                No, I just don t like boring movies 
                about people in looooove.


  The mini-van nearly side-swipes a sedan as it angles onto the 
  breakdown lane, rolls to stop.


  David and Don walk away from the hospital.

                              DAVID
                We got seven freeway attacks in

  His voice tight, face tense.

                                    ACT ONE


  Megan walks with Don.

                              MEGAN
                I get the concept of random 
                  clusters, but road rage is 
                  associated with certain factors, 
                none of which we see in these 
                cases.     

                              DON
                Factors like what, hot weather? 

                              MEGAN
                Also bad traffic, racial conflict, 
                near accidents.  Stuff that makes 
                people tense and angry.       

                              DON
                You re saying these incidents 
                aren t typical.   

                              MEGAN
                That s right.  Another thing --  
                the younger boy, Pete, said he 
                thought he saw a white pickup?  Now 
                he says maybe the same truck drove 
                by his house that morning.

                              DON
                Lot of white pick-ups in Los 
                Angeles.

                              MEGAN
                He says both had bobble-head Hula 
                dancers on the dash.

                              DON
                How sure is he?

                              MEGAN
                He s nine and he s been 
                  traumatized.  But it raises the 
                  possibility someone was stalking 
                Jeff Kinkirk, that he wasn t a 
                random victim.

                              DON 
                Let s hit from both sides.  Get a 
                list of white pickups from the DMV, 
                work it with David and Colby.

                What s the other side? 

                              DON
                The wife says her husband had no 
                enemies.  If the kid s right and 
                somebody was stalking the guy, 
                maybe she s hiding something. 


  LARRY S walking out carrying a coffee, runs into AMITA.

                Larry, got a minute? 

                              LARRY
                I have the eight and a half that it 
                takes me to walk to my office.  If 
                that s not enough, we could choose 
                a longer route, maybe stop to 
                  contemplate the turtle pond -- 

                              AMITA
                Or we could just keep talking at 
                your office. 

                              LARRY
                A less scenic choice, but okay.

  They walk along --

                              AMITA 
                I m finding it a little strange, 
                being a professor after being a 
                student for so long.

                              LARRY
                Oh my dear, we ve all been there.

                              AMITA
                Feels like I should be going to 
                  lectures, not giving them.  I run 
                into former teachers everyday, some 
                of them act like nothing s changed. 

                              LARRY 
                This is why people usually leave 
                the school where they earn their 
                  doctorate to teach elsewhere.  But, 
                  I understand CalSci made an offer 
                you couldn t refuse.

                  Geography s hardly the issue.  You 
                yourself must embrace your new 
                role.  Only then will others begin 
                to see you differently.

                              AMITA
                Wow.  Even for you, Larry, that was 
                  profound.  Feel like I should be 
                  snatching a pebble from your hand 
                or something.

                Rains said the worker took money 
                out of his car.  Rains got loud,  
                car wash manager called the cops.  
                Rains left before they got there.

                and fired a handgun into the front 
                window.  From a moving car.  

  Colby and David are eager, but Don s not so sure.

                              DON
                Two victims used the car wash, one 
                fought with this guy.  Any links to

  Man turns, points to where men wipe down wet cars.  As if

  takes off his jacket.

  Calvin slips, gets up and runs for the exit.  Finds himself 
  looking at the MANAGER -- who holds a baseball bat -- and 
  woompf -- catches a swing in the chest.  He drops.

  David cuffs Calvin.  Colby takes the bat from the manager.

  A car idles in the middle of a lane.  A car comes up behind

  An LAPD officer pulls up, his floods light up the vehicle. 

  A WOMAN behind the wheel. The Officer steps out, Maglite in 
  one hand, the other rests on the butt of his gun.

  He walks up to the drivers window.  Flashes the light on the 
  woman.  She stares straight ahead.

  No response.  He taps the window with the flashlight.

  The officer releases the gun leather on his holster.  Steps

  Gets a good look at a bullet hole through the windshield.  
  And the bloody hole in the woman s forehead.

                Second time we ve had a gunshot 
                from close range.  That s new, 
                before it s always been a different 
                form of attack.    

                              DON
                Different guy? 

                              MEGAN
                I m betting the same one, only he s 
                no longer afraid to repeat himself. 

                              DON
                Because he thinks it doesn t matter 
                anymore, that we can t catch him.  
                He might be right.

  His face darkens. 

                              MEGAN
                You know we can stop this guy. 

                              DON
                Maybe, maybe not. But he won t be 
                the last nut out there hurting 
                people.

                Don.  What s going on with you?

                              DON
                Nothing new. 

  He gives her a sad smile.  They walk on.  Her face troubled. 


  A man sands a chair (left handed).  David and Colby approach, 
  weapons raised, backed by cops. 

                              DAVID
                Brennon Sommers.

  The man looks up, stands, raising his hands slowly.

                              COLBY
                Hands up, walk toward us.

  SOMMERS complies, limping. He s partially paralyzed.  His 
  right leg drags, his right arm fixed and trembling. 

                              SOMMERS
                What is this about?

  He speaks with a slight impairment. 


  David and Colby chat with a SCHOOL CROSSING GUARD.

                              GUARD
                  I remember it was the same day as 
                the shooting, I had just heard the 
                report on the radio.

  He points at his radio, set up near his chair.

                              GUARD (CONT D)
                Couple minutes later, this truck 
                blows by.  

                              DAVID
                What made you notice this truck, 
                was it speeding?

                              GUARD
                That s not unusual.  No, it was 
                that, I see this pick-up coming 
                fast, then the light goes red--

                              COLBY
                Hold on, you said pick-up?

                              GUARD
                White pick-up truck--

  David and Colby look at each other.

                              GUARD (CONT D)
                  --light s red, like I said, but he 
                doesn t slow down.  I figure he s 
                gonna run it but -- it went green 
                again.  After a couple seconds.  

                              COLBY 
                You re sure about that?

                Describe the truck and the driver.

                              GUARD
                  Late-model pick-up, American make I 
                think.  Like I said, white.  Didn t 
                get a look at the driver, other 
                than white dude, sunglasses.

                Anything else?  Maybe -- something 
                on the dashboard?

                              GUARD
                There was, now that you mention it.  
                Couldn t see what it was.


  David and Colby walk back to their car.

                              DAVID
                The infamous white pick-up truck.

                              COLBY
                Like the one Jeff Kinkirk s son saw

                I need to, as your friend, be 
                  concerned about.

                              LARRY
                The two are not connected.  I m 
                sleeping in my office because I do 
                not, as I have said, wish to commit 
                myself to the distraction of 
                finding and furnishing a residence.

                For your concern.  It s good to

                too far off the rational plain, you 
                will be there to accost me.  

  Charlie smiles.  His cell phone rings, he answers. 


  A white pickup parked along the overpass.  MITCHELL MACKENZIE 
  gets out of the drivers side, goes to the back.

  A HULA DANCER sways on the dashboard. 

  MacKenzie s sad, intense.  He pulls a tarp off something in 
  the pick-up s bed.  It s a rock the size of a small suitcase.  
  MacKenzie starts to pull on work gloves.

  Ahead of him, an LAPD cruiser approaches the bridge.  
  MacKenzie pulls the tarp back over the rock, jumps in the 
  truck and guns the engine.

  He drives forward, at the police car, just as it slides 
  across the road to block his path.  The truck SLAMS into the 
  cruiser, then immediately drops into REVERSE.

  Coming the other way, two dark FBI SEDANS.  MacKenzie drops 
  it into drive and burns rubber toward an opening. 

  But a second LAPD cruiser screeches in, blocking his exit.

  David and Colby get out of the lead car, raising their 
  weapons, shouting at MacKenzie to stop--

  Police jump out, raising weapons.  

  MacKenzie bangs his fist on the dashboard in fury.

                out of my way!  Get out--

  David skirts the other side of the truck.  Colby covering 
  him.  David grabs MacKenzie, pulls him out of the truck.

                              DAVID
                Get on the ground, now!

                              COLBY
                Get on the ground.  Do it now.

  MacKenzie obeys.  David and Colby are on him, cuffing him.

                                MACKENZIE
                Good people hurt and killed, and 
                those responsible just walk away.   

  They pull him to his feet.

                                MACKENZIE (CONT D)
                Somebody has to pay.  That s all I
