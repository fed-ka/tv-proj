The crust of an old snowfall still covers the frozen ground,
and the bare, icy branches of the trees glisten dully in the
early morning light.
CUT TO:
CREDITS CONTINUE as we streak across the winter landscape,
flying over fields and farms, small towns and hamlets, railroad
lines and interstates, coalyards and factories, until we cross
the Allegheny River and follow it to the southwest.
CUT TO:
The country towns turn to suburbs, traffic on the roads gets
heavier and finally we see the skyline of Pittsburgh and the
confluence of the Allegheny with the Monongahela and the Ohio.

We zoom into a tall building in the downtown area and
DISSOLVE TO:
A VAN marked ".Channel 9 Action News" speeds along a two-lane
highway through the winter landscape of West Central
Pennsylvania. Mounted atop the van is a microwave transmitter.
Rita is riding up front with LARRY, the union cameraman and
techie. Phil is following close behind the van in a new Lexus
coupe. His car has a bumper-sticker that reads "Weathermen
Like it Wet."
PHIL (V.O.)
(on his earphone)
I'm on my way to Punxsutawney...
(forced to repeat it,
a little embarrassed)
Punx^su-taw-ney....Work or fun?
I think that all depends on you.
The van drives along , the small-town main drag. There are
cartoon groundhogs everywhere you look and the whole town has
been gaily festooned with banners and bunting.
EXT . MOTEL - LATER
The van pulls into the parking lot at a Quality Inn. The
announcement billboard in ;front of the motel reads: "Groundhog
Day Breakfast Special - Feb.2 - All You Can Eat - $5.99." The
parking area is already crowded with cars including a number of
other news vans. The Lexus pulls in behind the van and
everybody gets out.
Phil takes one look at the motel and shakes his head.
PHIL
(calls out)
Rita! I can't stay here.
Rita is already helping Larry unload equipment from the van.
LARRY
(MUTTERING)
Prima donnas.
RITA
It's okay. I'll handle it.
She crosses to the Lexus where Phil is trying to make another
call on his earphone.
RITA
What's the problem, Phil?
PHIL
I hate this place. I stayed here
two years ago and I was
miserable. It's like a minimum
security prison. I'm not staying
here.
-10-
RITA
You're not staying here.
PHIL
(BRIGHTENING)
I ' m not?
RITA
No, Larry and I don't care but I
thought you might, so I booked
you at a very nice bed and
breakfast on Cherry Street.
Here's the address.
She hands him a card.
PHIL
(PLEASED)
Great. That's great. That's the
mark of a really good producer.
Making the talent happy.
RITA
Whatever I can do.
PHIL
Really? Will you be my love
slave?
RITA
Whatever I can do within reason.
Would you like to have dinner
with Larry and me?
PHIL
No thanks, I've seen Larry eat.
Why don't you ditch Larry and let
me take you someplace nice?
RITA
You mean like a date?
PHIL
Yeah.
RITA
Oh, no.
PHIL
Okay. I get it. You're a little
intimidated by me, you're all
excited about the shoot tomorrow,
you want everything to go just
perfect. I understand. You just
get some sleep. Tomorrow will be
great.
-11-
RITA
Well, that's something to look
forward to. I'll see you in the
morning.
He drives off, leaving her standing there shaking her head.
LARRY
Did he actually call himself "the
talent?"
Larry snorts and continues unloading their gear.
CUT TO:
The first light of morning colors the sky behind the Cherry
Street Inn, a rambling, white Victorian bed and breakfast.
CLOSE UP - CLOCK
A digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00 AM. The radio
comes on, playing the end of the Sonny and Cher hit, "I Got
You, Babe."
SUPER: FEBRUARY 2
Sipping at the steaming coffee, Phil manages to put on his coat
and gloves as he descends the front steps of the house and
joins the flow of pedestrian traffic on the street.
There are a lot of people on the street for this hour. Traffic
is so heavy in fact, the pedestrians are moving faster than the
cars. Everyone seems to be going in the same direction, making
the annual trek to see the groundhog.
An OLD BUM is sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a
storefront. Someone throws him a coin. Phil walks by without
taking any notice.
MAN (O.C.)
Hey, Phil!
-15-
A big pie-faced man, NED RYERSON, comes huffing and puffing
right up to him. There is something about this guy that makes
us dislike him on sight.
NED
Phil! Phil Connors! I thought
that was you!
Phil looks at him vaguely.
PHIL
(at a loss)
I 'm sorry. Have we-- uh--
NED
My oh my! Phil Connors. Don't
say you don't remember me, 'cause
I sure as heckrfire remember you.
Well?
Phil stares, trying to remember.
NED
Ned Ryerson? Needlenose Ned?
Ned the Head. Come on, buddy.
Case Western High?
PHIL
Ned?
NED
I see you clicking through that
brain of yours. Click-click,
c li ck- cli ck, click-click--Bing!
Ned Ryerson, did the whistling
trick with my belly button in the
talent show. Bing! Ned Ryerson,
got the shingles real bad senior
^year^ almost didn't graduate.
Bing again! Ned Ryerson, went
out with your sister Mary Pat a
couple of times-- 'til you told
me not to anymore. Well?
PHIL
(RESIGNED)
Ned Ryerson.
NED
Bing!
PHIL
So what're you doing with
yourself, Ned?
NED
Phil, I sell insurance.
-16-
PHIL
(sorry he asked)
No kidding.
NED
Do you have life insurance, Phil?
'Cause if you do, I bet you could
u s e more-- who couldn't?--but I
got a feeling you don't have any.
Am I right?
PHIL
You know, Ned, I ' d love to talk
to you but I really have to--
Phil starts to walk away,,but Ned won't take the hint.
NED
That's okay. I'll walk with you.
When I see an opportunity, I
charge it, like a bull. Ned the
Bull, that's me now. Some of my
friends live and die by actuarial
tables, but I think it's all just
a crap shoot anyhoo. Ever heard
of single .premium life? That
could be the ticket for you,
buddy. God, it's good to see
you! Hey, what're you doing for
dinner?
PHIL
Dinner? Umm, I don't think
that's going to work for me.
As they continue walking, Phil steps into what looks like a
shallow puddle and ends up ankle deep in wet slush. Ned laughs
like a donkey.
NED
Hey, look out for that first
step! It's a doozy!
Phil looks at him with murderous contempt.
CUT TO:
A big crowd is standing in a park-like clearing off a
residential street. They are gathered around a large mound of
dirt enclosed by a rail fence, waiting for the big moment. For
a cold gray dawn, there is the atmosphere of a festival here.
An area close to the mound is roped off for news reporters and
cameras. Rita stands there, a pocket of genuine beauty in this
sea of potbellied old union guys and blow-dried reporters.
-17-
Stomping her feet against the cold, Rita looks at her watch and
glances around. Larry, the cameraman, just looks bored.
RITA
How could he be late?
LARRY
Prima donnas.
RITA
It's just so-- inconsiderate.
LARRY
What happens to some people?
They're born nice. They grow up
nice. You put 'em on TV and -
bam! Prima donnas.
Rita spots Phil heading into the crowd.
RITA
Here he comes. Phil! Hey, Phil.
Over here!
Phil joins them in the press area. Rita pulls him to his mark
near the rail fence.
RITA
Where've you been?
PHIL
I got hung up with some jerk I
went to high school with. So,
did you sleep okay without me?
You tossed and turned, didn't
you?
Rita holds up a slate for Larry to ID the tape.
RITA
You're incredible.
PHIL
Who told you?
RITA
Ready when you are.
Phil takes the microphone from Rita and positions himself
against the fence.
The Groundhog Club Officials in top hats, striped trousers and
cutaway coats parade out to the burrow that houses Punxsutawney
Phil.
RITA
Looks like they're starting.
Roll tape.
-18-
LARRY
Rolling.
Rita silently counts down from five and cues Phil who instantly
snaps into announce mode.
PHIL
(to camera)
Once a year, the eyes of the
nation turn here, to this tiny
hamlet in Pennsylvania, to watch
a master at work. The master?
Punxsutawney Phil, the world's
most famous weatherman, the
groundhog, who, as legend has it,
can predict the coming of an
early spring.
Rita turns to Larry. This is impressive-- so far, so good.
A Groundhog Club Official kneels at the burrow and
ceremoniously knocks on the small wooden door, then opens it
and retreats.
PHIL
And here's the big moment we've
all been waiting for. Let's just
see what Mr. Groundhog has to
say.
The groundhog sticks his head out, looks around, steps out of
the hole, and runs over to the other side of the mound, about
as far away from the cameras as he can get.
PHIL
Hey! Over here, you little
weasel!
Larry zooms in as far as he can but the best he can manage is
a close-up of the groundhog's back. The groundhog stands there
a moment, his body casting a long shadow, then he lets out a
squeak and runs back into the hole.
PHIL
Great shot, huh, folks? Well,
that was certainly worth the
trip. Now we'll be hearing from
Mr. Buster Greene, President of
the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club,
the so-called Seer of Seers who
will interpret for us.
BUSTER GREENE, dressed up in his top hat and cutaway coat,
walks onto the mound and hushes the crowd.
-19-
B U ST E R
He came out, and he saw his
shadow. Sorry, ladies and
gentlemen, but it looks like it's
going to be a long winter.
The crowd lets out a good-natured "Awwwwww" in disappointment.
PHIL
(sarcastic, to camera)
Well, that's it. Sorry you
couldn't be here in person to
share the electric moment. This
is one event where televison
really fails to capture the
excitement of thousands of people
gathered to watch a large
squirrel predict the weather, and
I for one am deeply grateful to
have been a part of it.
Reporting for Channel 9, this is
Phil Connors.
Larry cuts the camera.
RITA
(to Phil)
You want to try one that's a
little sweeter?
PHIL
(to Rita)
That's as sweet as I get. I'm
outa here.
As he exits, Phil tosses the mike to Larry, who isn't expecting
the throw and bobbles it, dropping the mike on the ground.
LARRY
(MUTTERS)
Prima donnas.
CUT TO:
INT . DINER - LATER
Phil is sitting alone having a cup of coffee in a busy, loud
and lively cafe. Rita enters, sees him sitting there, crosses
to his table and sits down across from him.
RITA
That was really lousy.
PHIL
Is it my fault the little rat
went south on us?
-20-
RITA
A real professional would have
handled it. You acted like it
was a personal insult. Who do
you think you are -- Wolf Blitzer?
PHIL
God, you really take this stuff
seriously, don't you.
RITA
Yes, I do. As far as I ' m
concerned there are no little
stories, Phil. Only little
reporters with big egos who think
they're too good for the job they
have to do.
PHIL
(trying to look hurt)
You really don't know me very
well, do you. 'Cause if you did
you could never say something
like that about me. I care!
Call me a cockeyed optimist but
I happen to think there's more to
this job than just getting my
ugly mug on the boob tube every
night.
RITA
Is that so.
PHIL
Yes, that is so.
Rita is so irritated by him she can't even respond.
Phil looks at her evenly for a long moment.
PHIL
So as far as us getting together,
would you say the glass is half
empty or half full?
Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita
and makes his way over to their table.
LARRY
(to Rita)
You ready? We better get going
if we ' re going to stay ahead of
the weather.
PHIL
You don't have to rush off, you
know. That storm is 'going to
miss us completely.
-21-
RITA
Nice working with you, Phil. See
you around.
Rita walks away, leaving him sitting alone.
CUT TO:

Phil's Lexus is driving down the highway. Light snow is just
starting to fall.
PHIL(V.O)
(on the earphone)
I'll call you after I see the
network guy. I should be back
there in a couple of
hours...What?...1 can't hear you--
you're breaking up...Hello?
Sabrina?
Phil jumps out and begins to walk down the highway, past the
parked cars, shivering in his light sweater and silk sport
shirt. The snowfall is getting heavier and the wind is pickin
up. The snow comes down unnaturally hard and fast. He walks
on, slipping and sliding in his expensive loafers until he
j comes to a police roadblock up ahead, manned by TWO HIGHWAY
"J PATROLMEN.
PHIL
What's going on, Officer?
-22-
PATROLMAN
Nothin's goin1 on. We're closin1
the road. Big accident up ahead.
Blizzard movin1 in.
PHIL
What blizzard? A couple of
flakes! An isolated phenomenon
of nature.
PATROLMAN
Are you nuts? We got a major
storm movin' in.
PHIL
No, no. All that moisture is
going to miss us and hit
Harrisburg.
PATROLMAN
Pal, you got that moisture on
your head.
PHIL
But I have to get to Pittsburgh
today!
PATROLMAN
Mister, the only place anybody's
goin' on this road is back to
Punxsutawney.
Phil glowers at him and shivers.
CUT TO:
Phil gulps down the steaming coffee, still trying to wake up
from what he assumes is a dream, and descends the front steps
of the house. He accosts a PASSERBY.
PHIL
Ma'am? Excuse me. Where's
everybody going?
PASSERBY
To Gobbler's Knob. It's
Groundhog Day!
The coffee cup drops from Phil's hand as he stands there open-
mouthed. Then he slaps his own face and shakes his head as if
trying to clear it and starts off down the street.
Phil rushes down the street, again failing to notice the OLD
BUM sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a storefront.
NED RYERSON (O.C.)
Hey, Phil!
Ned Ryerson approaches with the same obnoxious attitude.
NED
Phil! Phil Connors! I thought
that was you!
Phil just stares at him and keeps walking.
NED
My oh my! Phil Connors. Don't
say you don't remember me, 'cause
I sure as heck-fire remember you.
Well?
PHIL
Ned Ryerson?
NED
Bing! First shot right out of
the box. So how's it going, ol'
buddy?
PHIL
To tell you the truth, Neddy, I ' m
not feeling real well. Could you
excuse me?
NED
Now it's funny you should mention
your health 'cause you'll never
guess what I do.
-30-
PHIL
(very distressed and
desperate to get away
from this guy)
Do you sell insurance, Ned?
NED
Bing again! You're sharp as a
tack today. Do you have life
insurance, Phil? 'Cause if you
do, I bet you could use more --
who couldn't?" -- but I got a
feeling you don't have any. Am
I right?
PHIL
(really annoyed now)
Did I say "fuck off, " Ned? I
can't talk to you right now.
He backs away from Ned and steps right into the same deep,
slushy puddle he stepped in the day before.
NED
(BRAYING)
Hey, look .out for that first v
step. It's a doozyi
Phil looks down at his wet shoes and cuffs and stumbles off
toward Gobbler's Knob.
CUT TO:
EXT . GOBBLER ' S KNOB - DAWN
The crowd is gathered as before for the big moment.
In the press area, Rita is having the same dialogue with Larry,
when she spots Phil heading into the crowd.
RITA
Here he comes. Phill Hey, Phil!
Over here!
Phil waves to her and heads straight for an obscure corner of
the Knob, gesturing for her to follow.
Larry shakes his head as Rita charges through the crowd toward
Phil. She catches up to him just as he is scratching a mark in
the snow with his foot. She notices immediately that he is
uncharacteristically dishevelled, his tie askew, his hair
mussed.
RITA
Where ' ve you been?
-31-
PHIL
(nervous, sweat ing)
I've got to talk to you. I think
I'm losing my mind.
. RITA
I know you're losing it. What
are you doing over here? The
camera's over there.
PHIL
Slap me, Rita.
RITA
What is this?
PHIL
(INSISTENT)
Just slap me-- hard.
She gives up and taps him lightly on the cheek.
PHIL
I said hardl
. . .. ... .RITA .
I can't!
PHIL
Do it!
Rita shrugs and slaps him very hard.
PHIL
(his cheek smarting)
Better. Almost too hard, Rita.
RITA
Are you drunk?
PHIL
No, drunk is more fun. Can I be
serious with you for a minute?
RITA
I don't know. Can you?
PHIL
Yes. I ' m being serious. I' m
having a problem-- no, I may be
having a problem.
RITA
What are you trying to say?
-32-
PHIL
I'm trying to say that if I was
having a problem, just
hypothetical ly, I ' d like to know
that you're someone I could count
on in a crisis.
RITA
(WORRIED)
What did you do last night?
The crowd begins to hush.
LARRY
We better get started. We're
going to miss it.
PHIL
Were not going to miss it.
(indicating the other
REPORTERS)
They're going to miss it.
RITA
(EMPHATIC)
Phil. We've been out here for an
hour. We're cold and tired.
Let's just get this and get out
of here.
PHIL
Okay, put it here.
RITA
What?
PHIL
Put the camera here .
Rita takes a forlorn glance towards the press area, where all
of the other cameras are set up .
RITA
Phil , there is no tomorrow on
this one. It's Groundhog Day.
PHIL
We were in the wrong spot
yesterday .
RITA
(IRKED)
W ha t? Yesterday? What are you
talking about?
PHIL
Just trust me. Put the camera
here .
-33-
Rita looks at him like he's crazy, then looks at her watch and
gives up.
RITA
Larry!
She charges off toward the cameras.
In the Press Area, several reporters are already talking to
their cameras, dribbling on about how "He could appear any
second now." Rita and Larry grab their gear and rush back to
Phil.
Larry hurriedly sets up the camera.
LARRY
You want me to roll tape?
RITA
(to Phil)
Are you going to get on your
mark?
PHIL
No hurry.
Larry glances over at the other news reporters, all talking to
their cameras and pointing towards the mound.
LARRY
(DESPERATELY)
Everyone else is rolling!
Rita looks helplessly at Phil.
RITA
I'm begging you, all right?
Gould we please just do this?
Phil glances down at his watch.
PHIL
Okay, let's do it.
He crosses over to Larry and taps him on the shoulder.
PHIL
Roll tape.
LARRY
(MUMBLING)
Prima donnas.
Phil takes the microphone from Rita and positions himself
against the fence.
LARRY
Rolling.
-34-
Phil does a similar intro to the one he did before, though this
time it's a bit tentative.
PHIL
(to camera)
We ll, it's Groundhog Day-- again--
and you know what that means.
Everybody's here on Gobbler's
Knob waiting in the cold for the
appearance of the most famous
groundhog in the world,
Punxsutawney Phil, who's going to
tell us just how much more of
this we can expect.
The Groundhog Club Official knocks on the groundhog's door,
then opens it and retreats.
Phil takes a deep breath and makes his first experimental
prediction, recalling the previous day.
PHIL
My forecast is we're going to see
the groundhog peek its head out
of its hole, look around a little
bit, then he's going to come out,
scamper over to this general
area, look at the crowd for a
second, make a little burping
noise and run back into the
ground.
RITA
(whispers to Larry)
That's it. I'm going to kill
him.
Phil looks at his watch.
PHIL
O k ay ? And here we go--
Phil points to the hole and Larry zooms in.
The groundhog sticks his head out, looks left, looks right,
steps out of the hole, and runs away from the press pool,
directly over to Larry's camera. As he stands there, his body
casts a long shadow. The groundhog looks right into the
camera, lets out a squeak, and runs back into the hole.
Rita and Larry are completely amazed as the crowd cheers the
brief appearance of the groundhog. Larry pans back to Phil.
Phil just stands there speechless, staring at the groundhog
burrow.
-35-
RITA
(HISSES)
Phil!
Buster Greene, the Groundhog club official, walks onto the
mound and hushes the crowd, exactly as before.
BUSTER
He came out, and he saw his
shadow. Sorry, ladies and
gentlemen, but it looks like it's
going to be a long winter.
Again the crowd lets out a good-natured "Awwwwww" in
disappointment.
Larry pans back to Phil just in time to see him walking away in
a fog, without signing off. Then he pans back to Rita.
RITA
(at a loss)
For Channel 9 News, this is Rita
Hanson in Punxsutawney.
She holds for a moment then makes the cut sign, drawing her
finger across her throat.

INT; PHIL'S ROOM
Phil is on the phone desperately trying to make a call.
PHIL
(on the phone)
I know there's a blizzard, but I
have to get a call through to my
doctor in Pittsburgh. It's a
medical emergency. . . .No, don't
give me the Punxsutawney Fire
Department. When do you think
the long distance lines will be
working again?. . . But what if we
don't have a tomorrow? We didn't
have one today, my friend...
Hello...Hello?
He hangs up and shakes his head which is now really starting to
ache, then he pops a handful of Tylenol, lies down and pulls
the covers up over his head. A moment later, he sits up, takes
a pencil from the nightstand, breaks it in half and puts the
pieces back on the nightstand. Then he lies back down and
retreats back under the covers.

CLOSE UP - CLOCK
The digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00 AM. The
radio comes on, playing the end of the Sonny and Cher hit, "I
Got You, Babe," just as it did the day before.
Phil hurries toward the bed and breakfast carrying two gallon
buckets of paint, and a couple of big bags from a hardware
store.
Mrs. Lancaster and several other guests are gathered in the
hall outside Phil's room, listening at the door and looking
very worried. Loud music is playing inside the room.
From inside the room, they hear the sound of loud hammering,
wood splintering and glass breaking.
Phil and Rita cross the street and walk past a crowd of
concerned citizens gathered around what looks like a car
accident. As an ambulance arrives, Phil and Rita enter the
cozy looking diner on the corner.
Phil, Gus and Ralph approach Ralph's big, black, old Buick
convertible parked outside the bar. They are even drunker than
they were before.
RALPH
(fumbling with his
CARKEYS)
Where you stayin', Phil? We'll
drop you off.
PHIL
Hey, friends don't let friends
drive drunk. Give me your keys.
-46-
He's as wasted as they are, but Ralph hands over his keys
without a fight.
RALPH
Thanks , man .
PHIL
It's nothing. Get in.
They all pile into the front seat with Phil at the wheel.
PHIL
(starting the ear)
Seatbelts.
Ralph and Gus give him the thumbs up sign and start digging
around in the seat cracks for their seatbelts. Suddenly, Phil
floors the accelerator and peels away, sideswiping a parked car
as he screeches around the corner.
The Buick demolishes a parked car.
PHIL (V.O.)
"Don't do that -- "
He mows down a row of parking meters.
POLICE CAR
It comes screaming around a corner in hot pursuit of the Buick
A second police car joins the chase.
RALPH
(looking back)
That's two!
PHIL
Having a good time?
RALPH
I'm having a great time!
Phil speeds up to a hundred miles and hour. Gus is looking
even worse from the liquor and the motion of the car.
GUS
Hey, uh --
PHIL
Phil.
-48-
GUS
Yeah, Phil-- like the groundhog.
PHIL
Right.
GUS
Hey, Phil? How're we going to
get out of this?
THEIR POV - THE INTERSECTION AHEAD
Two police cars with lights flashing are parked sideways,
completely blocking the road. Officers stand in the roadway,
motioning for Phil to stop.
PHIL
(CALMLY)
Gus, you're just going to have to
trust me on this one.
He tromps the gas pedal to the floor. Gus's eyes go wide with
terror.
The police dive out of the way.
PHIL AND RALPH
Yahooooo!
THEIR POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
The Buick crashes head on into one of the police cars.
BLACK OUT:
C LOSE UP - CLOCK
The time changes from 5:59 to 6:00. The radio starts playing
"I Got You, Babe."
Phil sits up suddenly and looks around, completely amazed. He
is in his room at the bed and breakfast, everything exactly the
same as before. He hops out of bed and quickly examines
himself for signs of physical injury. Nothing. The music ends
and the two deej ays come on.
DEEJAY
Okay, campers, rise and shine,
and don't forget your booties
because it's COOOLD out there
today.
Phil talks out loud along with them.
PHIL AND SIDEKICK
It's cold out there everyday.
What is this-- Miami Beach?
-49-
The deejays laughs. Phil laughs, too, exhilirated at having
survived the car wreck, still very confused and perplexed, but
just beginning to see the possibilities of his unique
situation. He starts dressing in a hurry.
CUT TO:
Phil stops on the steps, puts on his coat and gloves and again
joins the traffic heading toward Gobbler's Knob.
Phil passes the old bum, ignoring him as usual.
NED (O.C.)
Hey, Phil!
Phil slips off his glove as Ned Ryerson lumbers toward him.
NED
Phil! Phil Connors!
PHIL
Ned! Ned Ryerson! Ned the Head!
Before Ned can say another word, Phil SLUGS HIM. Ned goes
down, Phil puts his glove back on and keeps walking.
Phil deftly avoids the slushy pothole he stepped in before. A
PEDESTRIAN walking behind him steps right into it.

Phil is passing through the crowd on his way to the press area
when he notices NANCY, the girl he met at the hotel bar, and
stops to talk to her.
PHIL

She gives him a look. It's obvious she's never seen him
before.
NANCY
Can you think of another reason
anybody'd be out here at dawn on
a freezing day?
PHIL
What's your name?

Phil comes through the crowd and finds Nancy in the same spot
she was in the day before.
PHIL
Nancy?
Nancy turns and looks at him quizzically.
-54-
PHIL
Nancy, right?
NANCY
I'm sorry, I--
PHIL
Nancy Taylor? Lincoln High? I
sat next to you in Mrs. Walsh's
English class.
NANCY
T h at --
PHIL
Phil Connors.
NANCY
--is amazing!
PHIL
You don't remember me, do you?
NANCY
I don't-- sure, I think--
PHIL
We used to shoot spit balls--
NANCY
Yeah, oh, God--
PHIL
I even asked you to the prom.
NANCY
Phil Connors.
PHIL
Yeah.
NANCY
How ARE you?!
PHIL
I ' m great. Wow, you look
terrific. Hey, listen, I gotta
d o this report--
NANCY
You're a reporter?
PHIL
Weatherman. Channel 9,
Pittsburgh.
NANCY
Right, I should've known--
-55-
PHIL
But maybe after we could --
NANCY
Yeah, yeah, I ' d like that --
RITA (O.C.)
Phil!
Rita is calling from across the crowd. She looks at him with
disapproval .
CUT TO:
Two harmless-looking old GUARDS are calmly loading bags of cash
into an armored car parked in front of a local bank. Suddenly
Phil appears, wielding a shotgun, wearing a Batman style cape,
his face completely hidden by a ski mask.
PHIL
(SHOUTS)
All right, freeze!! Drop your
guns J!
The guards stand there frozen with terror.
PHIL
You guys ever been held up
before?
(they shake their
HEADS)
It's kind of exciting, isn't it?
FIRST GUARD
(FRIGHTENED)
I guess so. Something to tell
the kids about.
PHIL
Yeah. By the way, I'm Phil.
He raises the mask and shows his face.
FIRST GUARD
Herman.
S E C O N D GUARD
Felix.
PHIL
(shaking their hands)
Herman and Felix. Okay. Take it
easy, boys. And thanks.
The frightened guards watch as Phil makes off with two large
satchels of cash.
CUT TO:
From a high angle, we see the BMW tearing around the streets of
the town as if running a Grand Prix road race.
CUT TO:
The BMW comes screeching to a stop right in front of the movie
theater and the door opens.
A pair of really elaborate cowboy boots complete with silver
spurs hits the pavement first; then we PAN UP to see Phil
emerge from the car wearing a really gaudy; full cowboy outfit
with real six-guns on his hips. A very trashy-looking girl,
LARAINE, gets out on the passenger side, dressed like a French
maid.
LARAINE
(very self-conscious)
I thought we were going to a
costume party.
PHIL
Yeah, we are, we are. But first
I have this movie theater fantasy
I want to talk to you about.
He escorts her into the theater.
CUT TO:
-59-
Rita is in the news van reviewing the tape of Phil's report
Phil hovers at the open side door.
RITA
You look good. I mean, it came
o ut all right. How'd you know
where to put the camera?
PHIL
Psychic. So did you have a nice
evening?
RITA
(GUARDED)
I just had a sandwich, watched
some TV and went to bed.
PHIL
I got my whole body tattooed and
part ied all night with some
nymphomaniac biker chicks.
RITA
(SKEPTICAL)
Sounds wholesome. Were those the
new 24-hour disappearing tattoos
or can I see them?
PHIL
No, they're gone. Rita, if you
only had one day to live, what
would you do with it?
-61-
She switches off the videotape and steps out of the van.
RITA
I don't know, Phil. What are you
dying of?
PHIL
No, I mean like what if the
entire world was about to
explode?
RITA
I ' d just want to know where to
p ut the camera. What are you
looking for, Phil-- a date for
the weekend?
She starts walking toward the center of town. Phil sticks
right with her.
PHIL
No, I just want to know you
better. What do you like, what
do you want, what do you think
about, what kind of men are you
interested in, what do you do for
fun?
RITA
(she stops)
Is this real or are you just
going to make me feel like a
fool?
PHIL
I'm just trying to talk to you
like a normal person. Isn't this
how normal people talk?
RITA
Close.
PHIL
Okay, so talk to me. C'mon, I'll
buy you a cup of coffee.
CUT TO:
Phil is wrapping up his groundhog report.
PHIL
Well, you heard it right from the
groundhog's mouth. Bundle up
good, 'cause it's going to be a
long winter-- at least in
Punxsutawney. Reporting for
Channel 9, this is Phil Connors.
Larry stops tape.
RITA
That was great. How did you know
THE--
PHIL
(PREOCCUPIED)
I have to go now. There's
something I have to do.
-64-
Phil runs off without another word of explanation.
CUT TO:
Phil has the hood open and is doing something to the engine.
CUT TO:
There is a light snow falling. Phil and Rita are making a
little snowman. Somehow the town looks magical tonight-- old
fashioned, wholesome.
A snowball hits Phil in the back. He and Rita turn around to
see a giggling KID. Phil packs a snowball and tosses it. The
kid throws one back. Rita and Phil both get into it, packing
snowballs and getting into a war with this kid and his little
gang of friends.
A snowball catches Rita unaware, she slips and goes down in a
snowbank. Phil bends down to help her and slips. They are no
together, lying in the snow, laughing. Their eyes lock for a
long sweet moment, then Rita gets embarrassed and stands up.
CUT TO:
EXT . CHERRY STREET INN - NIGHT
Phil and Rita are walking slowly, very close.
PHIL
What?
RITA
I ' m just amazed. And I'm not
easily amazed.
PHIL
About what?
-69-
RITA
How you can start a day with one
kind of expectation and end up so
completely different.
PHIL
Do you like how this day is
turning out?
RITA
Yes. I like it very much.
They stop dn front of Phil's hotel. She turns to him.
RITA
You could never have planned a
day like this, but it couldn't
have been more perfect.
PHIL
You're wrong. I've been planning
this day for weeks.
Rita ignores the remark and hugs him. Phil tries to kiss her
but she gently puts her fingers to his lips, stopping him.
\ They enter the bed and breakfast inn.
The snowball fight with the kids is going on as before. Phil
falls into the snowbank with Rita and they almost kiss.
CUT TO:
The streets are deserted except for Phil, staring up at Rita's
window in the Quality Inn.
Rita comes to her window and looks out. She sees Phil looking
up at her and draws the curtains.
CUT TO:
Phil is walking through the crowd. He spots Nancy, walks up to
her and greets her half-heartedly .
PHIL
Hi, Nancy.
NANCY
(PLEASANTLY)
Hi. Do I know you?
Phil can't manage enough enthusiasm to pursue her yet again.
PHIL
No, I guess not. I thought you
were someone else.
Phil wanders over to where Rita and Larry are setting up the
camera. Rita comes over to him.
RITA
Are you all right, Phil? You
look terrible.
Phil looks at her sadly, then turns away.
PHIL
(VACANTLY)
I ' m fine.
CUT TO:
INT . BIKER BAR - NIGHT
The balls CRACK as the cue ball breaks the rack.
Phil is walking around the table, cue in hand, sinking ball
after ball, while several admiring HUSTLERS look on.
FIRST HUSTLER
Who is this guy?
-73-
SECOND HUSTLER
I don't know. Hey, mister--
(Phil doesn't stop
SHOOTING)
Who are you, anyway?
Phil shoots, sinks a tough one.
PHIL
You don't know me? I've been
playing here every day for two
months.
FIRST HUSTLER
Oh, yeah? So how come I ain't
seen you?
PHIL
I don't know. I seen you.
SECOND HUSTLER
So what's your name?
PHIL
They call me-- Punxsutawney Phil.
SECOND HUSTLER
Punxsutawney Phil? Like the
groundhog.
PHIL
Yeah, like the groundhog.
Phil sinks another one.
CUT TO:
The crowd is waiting expectantly for the groundhog to appear
Phil is a wreck, squatting unprofessionally in front of the
camera.
PHIL
(CYNICALLY)
This is one of the most pitiful
spectacles known to civilization.
With one nod from a filthy rodent
best known to pest control
agencies, a moribund old coal
mining hamlet turns magically
into the Lourdes of Pennsylvania,
Mecca to thousands of people who,
if they hated the winter so
damned much, why don't they move
to Florida, anyway?
-74-
Larry and Rita look on, incredulous.
. CUT TO:
CLOSE UP - TV SET
The program JEOPARDY! is playing.
ALEX TREBECK

Nobel prize-winning co-
discoverers of the DNA molecule.
PHIL (O.C.)
Who are Watson and Crick.
CONTESTANT
(on TV)
Who are Watson and Crick?
ALEX
(on TV)
Correct.
There is a cheering from a small group of people off-screen.
Phil is walking through town, still dressed only in his pajamas
and overcoat, counting the sidewalk cracks, taking giants steps
from one to the next. He looks crazy.
PHIL
Two thousand six hundred and

PHIL
Hey, pick up after your dog!
DOG WALKER
He hasn't done anything.
PHIL
He's going to!
(POINTING)
There and there. And there!
Phil continues walking, counting the sidewalk cracks. THREE
NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS notice Phil and walk along, matching him step
for step.

Two, eight, nine, forty-six--
Phil stops. He has lost count. His lip curls up like an
animal as he turns slowly, growling at the kids. They run away
screaming with glee. Phil starts after them but runs right
into a COP.
COP
You got a problem, buddy?
PHIL
(out of control)
Yeah, I got a problem, buddy! I
can't stand this place anymore!
I can't stand this street and I
can't stand the fourteen bars and
the five banks and the one star
food and the bad weather and the
"quaint" little shops and most of
all, I can't stand anything--
ANYTHING-- with a groundhog on
it.
He rips a groundhog patch off the cop's jacket sleeve.
COP
(CALMLY)
Okay. Then let's see what we can
do about getting you out of here.
You got a name?
PHIL
(eyes downcast)
Phil.
COP
Phil. Like the groundhog!
Phil turns to the cop like a rabid dog, ready to strike.
PHIL
Yeah, like the--
(he stops as if struck)
--groundhog.
Some big new idea has formed in his mind.
CUT TO:
EXT . GOBBLER'S KNOB - EARLY MORNING
Rita is looking at Phil as Larry videotapes his report.
-77-
LARRY
(turning to Rita)
The guy's nuts. He's out of his
gourd.
RITA
Let him finish, then I'll call
the station.
They turn back to watch Phil's wrap-up.
Phil is completely unkempt, still wearing only pajama bottoms
and his overcoat, looking even more demented.
PHIL
(to camera)
There is no way this winter is
ever going to end as long as that
groundhog keeps seeing his shadow
everyday. I don't see any other
way out. He's got to be stopped
and I've got to stop him. For
Channel 9 news, this is Phil
Connors.
CUT TO:
Phil is walking around the mound, casing it out. He takes a
rifle out from under his coat and sneaks up to the burrow. He
pulls a smoke bomb from his pocket, lights it, and throws it
into the hole, then scurries for the edge of the knob and hits
the deck. He lifts his rifle and aims it.
Smoke is now pouring from the mound. Lots of it.
Phil waits, his trigger finger twitching.
A WOMAN casually walks by, stops. She surveys the situation.
WOMAN
He ain't there.
Phil doesn't move. He-doesn't care that she sees him.
WOMAN
You can wait all night, but he
ain't coming out. He don't live
there. They keep him in the
library.
Phil's gun droops. The woman begins to walk off, then stops.
WOMAN
Plug him once for me.
-78-
She leaves.
CUT TO:
Phil passes a pedestal bearing a life-size bronze statue of the
groundhog and enters the public library.
The groundhog is just poking his head out of the hole. He
stands full height and looks around.
Phil looks directly at the groundhog with hate and scheming
madness.
Suddenly, Phil whips out a big kitchen knife from under his
icoat and dives at the groundhog. Town officials and police
throw themselves on Phil as the groundhog scampers safely back
into his hole.
Rita and Larry videotape the incident, aghast at Phil's insane
attack.
CUT TO:
Larry and Rita are loading their equipment back into the van.
Rita spots Phil standing on the other side of the crowd,
staring at her. She marches straight over to him, furious.
RITA
Where were you this morning? How
could you possibly miss the
shoot?
PHIL
(at the end of his
ROPE)
I've come to the end of me, Rita.
There's only one way out now.
Just remember/we had a wonderful
day together once.
Phil kisses her gently on the cheek and walks off toward the
back of the knob. Rita watches him, then follows at a discreet
distance, very worried.
In a small clearing behind the man-made groundhog burrow,
Buster Greene and TWO other GROUNDHOG CLUB OFFICIALS are
lifting a cage into the front seat of Buster's pickup.
B USTER
(to the groundhog)
There you go, ol' buddy. Good
job. Hey! He smiled at me. See
that?
FIRST OFFICIAL
Right.
-80-
BUSTER
(securing the cage)
There, little fella.
The other official looks up and sees Phil walking toward them
like a zombie.
OTHER OFFICIAL
Hi, there, mister. Something I
can do you for?
Without a word, Phil jumps quickly into the cab of the pickup
and starts it up .
FIRST OFFICIAL
Hey! What 're you -- !
Phil drives off in Buster's truck.
Rita witnesses the groundhog-napping and runs back toward the
knob.
RITA
(SHOUTS)
Larry!
Buster and his aides race for another car parked nearby.
BUSTER
Jake! Call the police, and get
the word out. Somebody kidnapped
Phil. We're going after him.
Come on, Tommy!
They jump into a car, Buster guns the engine and takes off
after the pickup.
Rita runs up to Larry and grabs the camera on the fly.
RITA
Let's go! Phil just snatched the
groundhog!
Larry does a slow take and starts gathering up the rest of the
gear.
LARRY
(MUTTERS)
Probably some kind of gerbil
deal. Pervert.
CUT TO:
-81-
Phil comes tearing around a slippery curve, followed by Buster
in his car, and close behind him, a contingent of police cars
and the Channel 9 news van.
The cars chase the pickup to the top of the mountain.
The pickup is losing its lead over the pursuers as it nears the
sharp mountain cliff.
The pickup bursts through a retaining fence and rockets over
the edge of the cliff.
The pickup seems to hang in the air for a long time, then it
begins its SLOW MOTION descent, falling ever so gracefully
until it impacts on the granite rock face far below.
BIG EXPLOSION. BIG FIREBALL. FLAMING WRECKAGE. Then a small
click, followed by "I Got You, Babe."
DISSOLVE TO:
PHIL
He slowly opens his eyes and blinks. He looks around and
realizes he's back in his room at the bed and breakfast.
PHIL
Ah, nuts!
Phil throws off the covers and hurls himself out of bed.
CUT TO:
-83-
Rita and Larry are walking down the street when a GREYHOUND BUS
pulls out of the bus station and accelerates down Main Street.
Suddenly, Phil, dressed in pajamas and overcoat, leaps out in
front of the speeding bus. Rita witnesses the whole incident.
D RIVERS' POV
He sees Phil through the windshield but doesn't even have time
to hit the brakes before he runs right over Phil.
CUT TO:
A TV SCREEN
A woman in some horror movie is screaming.
REVEAL
Mrs. Lancaster is watching TV in the parlor of the hotel. In
the corridor behind her, Phil walks by, dressed in a robe,
carrying an electric toaster and a towel, heading for the
bathroom.
A few moments pass.
We hear the zap of an electrocution, the lights and TV flicker
and dim for a moment, then come back on again.
CUT TO:
The building is surrounded by police, all crouched behind their
cars with guns and rifles trained on the doors.
-84-
Suddenly, the doors burst open and Phil comes running out of
the bank screaming, dressed in camouflage fatigues and armed to
the teeth with an assault rifle in one hand, an Uzi in the
other and a couple of handguns stuck in his belt. He doesn't
get three feet before he is shot down in an incredible hail of
gunfire.
Rita stands beside the camera gaping in horror while Larry
records the grisly massacre.
Phil and Rita are walking down the sidewalk.
PHIL
Afer I got over the shock, it was
kind of fun for the first year or
two. I had anything I wanted.
Except you, of course.
-90-
Phil abruptly pulls Rita aside. A big pile of snow slides off
a roof and onto the sidewalk where they would have walked.
Phil doesn't even look up. Rita looks, as if she's seeing a
miracle.
RITA
How did this start?
PHIL
I don't know. I just woke up.
Just like always.
NED RY-ERSON approaches.
NED
Hey, Phil! Phil Connors 1
PHIL
Rita, this is Ned Ryerson. He's
an asshole.
NED
He remembers me!
Phil and Rita keep walking. Rita looks back at Ned, perplexed
PHIL
Trust me on that one.
CUT TO:
Phil and Rita come out of the shop, sharing pieces of fudge.
RITA
This is great.
PHIL
No, it isn't. You hate fudge.
. RITA
Just how well do we know each
other?
PHIL
I told you. I know everybody.
Rita stops walking.
RITA
Did we ever...you know?
PHIL
(TEASING)
Did we ever! You were an animal.
-91-
RITA
Come on.
PHIL
You're European trained, aren't
you.
Phil continues walking.
RITA
(BLUSHING)
Phil! It's not funny.
She catches up to him. Phil turns to her.
PHIL
You weren't interested.
RITA
(RELIEVED)
Okay.
She begins walking again.
RITA
Not that it would've been so
awful.
PHIL
I understand.
RITA
I just had to know whether to
smack you or not.
PHIL
You did.
RITA
Good.
CUT TO:
Phil and Rita are sitting on a park bench.
PHIL
So do you believe any of this?
RITA
I don't know. I don't know how
else you could know so much.
Maybe it is really happening.
-92-
PHIL
I used to try to stay up all
night sometimes. I thought if I
could stay conscious I could
figure out what was going on, or
at least hang onto something from
the day before. But I gave up on
that a long time ago.
Rita looks at him with compassion.
RITA
It sounds so-- lonely.
PHIL
(trying to shrug it
OFF)
It's not that bad. You get used
to it.
Rita comes to a decision.
RITA
Maybe I should spend the rest of
the day with you-- as an
objective witness. Just to see
what happens. Okay?
PHIL
Yeah, sure. That'd be okay.
CUT TO:
Rita and Larry are in the packed press area, beginning to set
up the equipment.
Phil arrives, carrying two cups of coffee.
PHIL
Rita?
She looks at him without a trace of the rapport they shared the
night before.
RITA
Oh, hi, Phil.
PHIL
Thought you might like some--
He hands her the coffee.
RITA
Thanks!
PHIL
Careful, it's hot. Larry?
He hands Larry a cup.
LARRY
(surprised, mutters)
Yeah, great.
RITA
We're just setting up.
PHIL
You know, I bumped into Buster
Greene, he kind of runs this
thing, and he tipped me off that
we might get a better shot over
there.
RITA
Really?
-99-
PHIL
I mean, maybe we should go for
it. What do you think?
RITA
Sounds good to me. Larry?
LARRY
Sure, why not?
RITA
All right. Thanks, Phil. Good
work.
She reaches for an equipment case.
PHIL
I'll get that.
Phil helps Larry carry the camera gear.
PHIL
(to Larry)
You and I never talk, Larry. You
got kids?
Larry looks suspicious. Rita looks on, reevaluating Phil.
CUT TO:
Phil rings the doorbell. A kindly young woman, MARY, answers
MARY
Yes?
PHIL
I ' d like a piano lesson, please.
-100-
MARY
Oh. Okay, I ' m with a student
now, but --
PHIL
I'll give you a thousand dollars.
Mary hesitates only a moment, then ushers Phil into the house
and closes the door.
A moment later the door opens and a LITTLE GIRL with an armloa
of music books exits as if pushed. The door closes behind her.
CUT TO:
Phil stands in front of the camera, giving his report.
PHIL
In fact, the groundhog's
legendary ability to predict the
weather may be more than just the
German folklore of the region.
Higher temperatures trigger
hormonal changes in the
testosterone levels of male
groundhogs, which may in fact
wake them from hibernation and
send them out to battle with
other males ;for mating rights.
So, the truth is they're not
looking for their shadows,
they're looking for groundhog
chicks.
Rita looks on, clearly delighted with the report.
CUT TO:
Phil is delivering another report.
-102-
PHIL
Groundhog Day, February second,
also known as Candlemas Day or
the Feast of the Purification of
the Virgin Mary, the day Mary
first came to the temple for
ritual blessings following the
birth of the infant Jesus, and
celebrated since the Middle Ages
by the sacramental lighting of
candles. Hence the old Scottish
couplet which long predates the
.American groundhog tradition: "If
Candlemas dawns bright and clear,
there'll be two winters in the
year."
Larry whispers an aside to Rita.
LARRY
Is he making this stuff up?
RITA
(RIVETED)
Shhhhh.
CUT TO:
Beyond the graveyard is a work shed with various tombstones
scattered about. Old TUCKER, the town stonecarver, is at work
chiseling a name into a gravemarker.
Behind him, Phil is chipping away at a small hunk of marble,
sculpting a very lovely cherub.
Rita sits on a stool eating an apple and sipping hot tea
watching him with amazed interest.
PHIL
But what if the rules changed?
What if none of your actions had
consequences?
RITA
There would still be an absolute
morality. There has to be an
absolute good, regardless of the
circumstances.
PHIL
Oh, is that so, Miss Plato? Then
let me ask you this. Where does
this "absolute good" come from?
From the sky?
-103-
Rita shrugs.
RITA
I don't know. From my freshman
Philosophy course, I guess.
They both laugh. Then she looks at him for a long moment and
grins.
PHIL
What?
RITA
Nothing. I just can't believe
you're such a fine sculptor.
Phil takes a bite of her apple and gets up.
PHIL
I gotta go.
RITA
Where do you have to go in
Punxsutawney?
PHIL
I got piano and then drums.
RITA
Here?
PHIL
Come on, I'll drop you off.
They exit.
CUT TO:
Phil drops Rita off and watches as she crosses the street to
Larry who is waiting on the other side.
Across the street, Rita takes a wistful glance toward Phil,
then gets in the news van and drives off.
Phil gets out of the car and starts walking, but finds himself
face to face with Ned Ryerson.
NED
Phil! Phil Connors! I thought
that was you!
PHIL
Ned? Ned Ryerson! I don't
believe it. I've missed you so
much.
-104-
Phil gives Ned a big hug and keeps holding on for an
uncomfortably long time, actually giving Ned a hickey on the
neck. Ned goes into homophobic shock.
NED
Uh, I gotta get going. Nice to
see you, Phil.
He hurries off.
CUT TO:
Phil is walking down the street. He glances down the alley as
he passes, stops, walks back and enters the alley. The OLD BUM
that Phil never noticed before is lying there, huddled against
a wall. Phil goes to help him.
PHIL
Hey, mister. Hey. Come on,
let's get you somewhere warm.
The old bum turns to look at Phil, then closes his eyes.
PHIL
(helps the old man to
his feet)
There you go.
Phil practically carries him out of the alley.
CUT TO:
Phil is in the alley, shaking the old man, trying to rouse him.
PHIL
Come on . Hang on . Hang on ,
there . Breathe .
-106-
Phil stops. The body lies, unmoving. Phil sits back,
breathing heavily.
CUT TO:
Phil is delivering his report. Everyone there is silent and
listening to Phil. Even the other reporters have turned their
cameras on him.
PHIL
...When Chekhov saw the long
winter, it was a winter bleak and
dark and bereft of hope; and yet,
we know winter's only one more
step in the cycle. And standing
among the people of Punxsutawney --
(Phil looks directly at
RITA)
-- basking in the warmth of their
hearths and hearts, I couldn't
imagine a better fate than a long
and lustrous winter.
Phil smiles. Rita smiles, too.
PHIL
For Channel 9 news, I ' m Phil
Connors.
There is much applause. Even Larry brushes away a tear.
Phil hands the microphone to Rita.
RITA
PHIL--
PHIL
Sorry. I'm gonna be late.
Phil rushes off.
RITA
Late for what? Phil?
(To Larry)
Could you break it down and wrap
out of here by yourself, Larry?
LARRY
Sure .
RITA
Thanks .
-107-
Rita rushes off after Phil.
CUT TO:
Phil walks briskly toward an intersection, glancing nervously
at his watch. Rita follows him at a distance, hurrying to keep
up.
MARIE, a little nine-year-old girl, approaches the intersection
shielding her brand new puppy under her winter coat. She isn't
paying attention to traffic and fails to notice a big truck
bearing down on her.
As she steps off the curb, Phil arrives and, with split-second
timing, nonchalantly but firmly grabs her coat to hold her
back, just as the big truck rushes past in the street, narrowly
missing her.
PHIL
Hey! Did you forget to look both
ways? You didn't even look one
way.
MARIE
My doggie was cold.
PHIL
Yeah, well, my doggies are
freezing, but I ' m still gonna
watch out for cars. See you
around, kid.
Phil looks at his watch and rushes off.
Rita looks on amazed and follows him at a distance.
CUT TO:
Phil kneels on the cold ground beside the old bum who lies
huddled against the wall, immobile.
Rita is standing by at the end of the alley, watching as Phil
examines him.
Phil writes something down on a small pad. He finishes, and
sets it down by the old man. Then he takes his coat and uses
it to cover the man up. A siren is heard.
Phil stands and walks away, as an ambulance pulls into the
alley.
RITA
Is he -- ?
. 'PHIL
Yeah. Let's go.
RITA
In a minute.
She waits and watches.
The paramedics, BUD and ANDY, get out of the ambulance and
inspect the scene.
BUD
It's ol1 Really.
ANDY
That's a shame.
BUD
Look here .
Bud picks up the note Phil left.
Rita steps closer.
RITA
May I see that?
(reading aloud)
"Every night, by cold bricks
GLOW
I watch the shadow rising
from this old man in the snow.
At 8:02 we let it go."

ANDY
(REPEATING)
"At 8:02 we let it go."
BUD
Wow, that's nice.
Rita hands him the note and quickly walks away.
ANDY
Suppose he wrote it?
BUD
(DOUBTFUL)
Are you kidding?
CUT TO:
Rita catches up with Phil outside the Pennsylvanian, the town's
oldest and best hotel.
RITA
Now what?
PHIL
Come on. You'll see.
They enter.
CUT TO :
Phil and Rita walk down Main Street hand in hand.
A MAN
Phil! Good morning!
A LADY
Mr. Connors. I wanted to thank
you.
PHIL
That's all right. I--
A FLORIST steps out of the flower shop with a bouquet.
FLORIST
Phil, here. I want you to have
these.
PHIL
Thanks, Carl.
Phil smells the flowers, and hands the bouquet to Rita.
PHIL (V.O.)
And so began my final lifetime,
and ended the longest winter on
record. I would find myself no
longer able to affect the chain
of events in this town, but I did
learn something about time. You
can waste time, you can kill
time, you can do time, but if you
use it wisely, there's never
enough of it. So you'd better
make the most of the time you've
got.
A car skids on the ice and smashes into a tree. Phil and Rita
rush over to help, but the driver waves that he's okay. Rita
and Phil continue their walk.

PHIL (V.O.)
Larry never got through the
blizzard, so none of my groundhog
reports ever made it on the air.
But Rita and I-- we lived happily
ever after.
Phil and Rita walk off together.
Across the street, Larry is trying to get rid of Ned Ryerson
who is doggedly trying to sell him insurance.
NED
But Phil told me you were his
accountant!
LARRY
Look, I told you! He's nuts!
Larry keeps trying to walk away, but Ned won't leave him alone.
NED
Let me just tell you about single
premium life--
Finally, Larry slugs Ned and storms off, leaving Ned
floundering in a snowbank.
Phil and Rita walk on as we pull up and away from Main Street
revealing the whole of Punxsutawney and the snowy countryside
that embraces it.
