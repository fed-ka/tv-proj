It's an early November morning, and the sun has just come
over this extraordinary building. WE HOLD on this for a moment
before we
CUT TO:
It's around 10 o'clock the same morning as the capital district,
in its own way, is showing signs of the approaching Thanksgiving
and Christmas holidays.
On the seventh floor of the building. A RECEPTIONIST tells us
where we are by answering the phone--
RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
Global Defense Council...
SUSAN (V.O.)
You wanted to see me?
LEO (V.O.)
I just got off the phone with A.J.
MacInerney.

DISSOLVE TO:
It's early morning of the following day, and the grounds
outside are in full swing.
In front of the guardhouse, Susan and her new colleague,
SYDNEY ELLEN WADE, are being cleared.
SYDNEY
(to the GUARD)
Hi, my name's Sydney Ellen Wade.
SUSAN
He just needs your driver's license.
SUSAN hands the guard her license.
SYDNEY
(handing him her
license)
I'm from Virginia.
SUSAN
He doesn't care.
SYDNEY
(to the GUARD)
I'm here for a meeting with Mr.
MacInerney.
SUSAN
He doesn't need to know that.
The GUARD BUZZES her through the gate.
SYDNEY
(to the GUARD)
Forgive me, this is my first time at
the White House. I'm trying to savor
the Capra-esque quality.
SUSAN
He doesn't know what Capra-esque
means.
GUARD
(to SUSAN)
Yeah, I do. Frank Capra, great
American director -- It's a Wonderful
Life, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.
(handing SYDNEY and SUSAN
their laminated passes)
Sydney Ellen Wade of Virginia. Knock
'em dead.
SYDNEY
Thanks.
SYDNEY and SUSAN begin to walk up the path toward the entrance
to the West Wing.

BETH (V.O.)
This box just says "Miscellaneous."
Is this bedroom miscellaneous or
kitchen miscellaneous?
CUT TO:
SYDNEY exits her apartment and is once again hounded by the
press.
SCHLOCK TALK SHOW HOST (V.O.)
We're gonna take a commercial break.
When we come back, we're gonna meet
a junior high school classmate of
Sydney Wade's, who says--
CUT TO:
Rumson's getting the pride back into a couple of hundred
innocent bystanders.
SHOWBIZ REPORTER (V.O.)
...Showbiz Weekly was in Hollywood
for the star-studded gala. Also on
tonight's program: Day 15 of the
Sydney Watch. Is the world's most
eligible bachelor off the market?
SYDNEY exits the building and is mobbed by the press.
JOHN McLAUGHLIN TYPE (V.O.)
Political polling analyst Ed Earl,
with the President's job approval
taking an eight-point dip from his
personal best of 63 percent three
weeks ago, should the White House be
concerned that the Girlfriend Factor
has left Shepherd vulnerable to the
kinds of character questions he was
able to avoid three years ago?
ED EARL (V.O.)
Well, if they're not concerned, they
sure oughta be.
RADIO GUY
Establishing shot of the Ramada.
Rumson and his STAFF are buzzing about amid room service
tables and late-night take-out as STU enters the room with
a manila envelope in his hand.
RUMSON
(into phone)
I agree a hundred and ten percent,
Mrs. Harper. That's why I'm up here
in the dead of winter talkin' about
it with you folks.
Rumson is signaling for an AIDE to take over his phone call.
RUMSON
(continuing;
into phone)
That's very generous of you, ma'am,
and I'm gonna take that money off
your hands right now.
He hands off the phone--
RUMSON
(continuing)
What do you got for me, Stu?
STU
Call me Santa Claus, Senator.
Several TOP AIDES join this slightly confidential conversation.
STU
(continuing)
She's got an FBI file.
RUMSON
Shit, Stu, my mother's got an FBI
file.
RUMSON starts to walk away when STU pulls an 8×10 photo from
the manila folder.
STU
I've got art.
RUMSON comes back. STU hands him the photo.
STU
It's a demonstration outside the
Department of Commerce. The
picture's old, and a lot of the faces
are obscured by the smoke, but this
is Sydney right there in front.
RUMSON
(staring at the photo)
Oh man...tell me the smoke is coming
from what it looks like it's coming
from.
STU
Yes, sir -- it's burning flag.
RUMSON gives it one last look, passes it back to STU, and
turns back to his phone.
RUMSON
(singing softly)
"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas..."
CUT TO:
The President's motorcade sits in its formation, engines
running, waiting for its passenger.
CUT TO:
SHEPHERD is getting into the limo when LEWIS and ROBIN hurry
out to catch him.
ROBIN
(calling)
Sir...
JANIE
He's incredibly late.
SHEPHERD
(to LEWIS and ROBIN)
Hop in. We'll talk in the car.
As they do they're told, and the motorcade gets on its way.
CUT TO:
SHEPHERD's sudden decision sets off a chain reaction of
Secret Service activity to accommodate the change of plans.
Scattered STAFF and MARINE PERSONNEL hold their hats to their
heads against the wind that MARINE-1 kicks up as it touches
down on the helicopter pad.
CUT TO:
The official White House Christmas Tree is glimmering for the
TOURISTS.
CUT TO:
The street's been temporarily closed to traffic, and SECRET
SERVICE AGENTS man the sidewalk. The PRESS and ONLOOKERS
form a small crowd, kept well at bay by police barricades.
A light rain is falling.
CUT TO:
It's lit up and glowing on this cold, clear night.
ANCHOR (V.O.)
We're only a moment or two away from
the arrival of President Shepherd and
his State of the Union address.
Lloyd, you've served on the staffs of
several past administrations, what
kind of last-minute activity is the
President engaged in right now?
