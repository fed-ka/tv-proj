                                  December 22, 2011      EXT. ROBERT H. JOHNSON HIGH SCHOOL -- 8 A.M. 

      Kids milling on campus before the bell signals the end of 
      freedom.  The usual scene   jocks and cheerleaders holding 
      court...and on the outer edges   the nerds.   We focus on one 
        unfortunate-looking FRIZZY-HAIRED GIRL.  She sits alone, 
      watching the popular kids play hacky sack, laugh, flirt.  As 
      we SLOWLY PUSH IN, we hear voice-over: 

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    I wasn t one of those kids who 
                    thrived in high school.  I was kind 
                    of geeky.  Alright, I was very 
                    geeky.  Plus, I had the unfortunate 
                    nickname of  Pits  due to the severe 
                    case of flop sweats I got during 
                    debate club finals, the one and only 
                    time I was on stage in front of the 
                    whole school.  So yeah,  high school 
                    was rough.  But you know what got me 
                    through?  The knowledge that I would 
                    outgrow all those feelings of 
                      insecurity, and inadequacy and at 
                    some point, I d blossom into the 
                    secure, confident, kick-ass person I 
                    was always meant to be.

      And suddenly the Frizzy-haired Girl looks up, through the 
      chain link fence, and stares at the camera. 

                                    FRIZZY-HAIRED GIRL
                    What are you looking at, loser?

      And now we re outside the chain link fence, with our 25-year old 
      heroine, EMILY BARNES...the source of the voice-over, our P.O.V.  
      Emily used to be frizzy, now she straightens.  She used to be 
      chubby, now she diets.  She used to be uncool, now she s...well, 
      she has straighter hair and she s slimmer.   Emily s wearing a 
      jacket over hospital scrubs.  On her feet, clogs. 

                                  EMILY
                    I m not a loser.  I was just 
                    thinking about high school and --

                                    FRIZZY-HAIRED GIRL
                    You look like a loser.

                                  EMILY
                    No, I don t! 
                          (then, insecure)
                    Is it the shoes?  Because these are 
                    just work shoes.

                                    FRIZZY-HAIRED GIRL
                    It s not the shoes --                                                                                      2.


                                  EMILY
                          (a little desperate)
                    Then what?

                                    FRIZZY-HAIRED GIRL
                    It s just...you.

                                  EMILY
                    What does that mean?

      The Teenager rolls her eyes as the bell rings.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Don t roll your eyes!  Why do I 
                    look like a loser?

      The Teenager starts walking towards the school.  Emily 
      follows after her (outside the fence), quite worked up:  

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Hey!  Stop!  You can t just say 
                    that to someone! Come back here!  
                    You come back here right now!

      EXT. CURB BY ROBERT H. JOHNSON HIGH SCHOOL -- MOMENTS LATER

      An upset School Official is pointing away from the school.  
      Emily hurries off, embarrassed:

                                  EMILY
                    I m really sorry.  I m just a 
                    little on edge...

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    So, yeah.  I m still kind of 
                    waiting for that confident, kick-
                    ass thing to happen.

      EXT. DENVER MEMORIAL HOSPITAL -- MINUTES LATER

      Emily walks up to the imposing hospital, going over the ACLS 
      ( Advanced Cardiac Life Support ) Code under her breath...

                                  EMILY
                    Airway, breathing, circulation, 
                    look for pulse, Compressions, IV, 
                    O2, monitor, Stable V-tach: 
                      Amiodarone 150mg IV, Compressions--

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Stop.  You know it.  You can do this.

      And she s at the entrance.  She stares at the smooth, white 
      fa ade, daunted.                                                                                         3.


      She glances back at the high school across the street.  Then, 
      she looks back at the hospital... her future.  One deep 
      breath and she enters...

      INT. DENVER MEMORIAL HOSPITAL -- MAIN ENTRYWAY

      It s bustling with activity.  Completely overwhelming.  Emily 
      looks around, trying to get her bearings, trying to figure 
      out where the hell she is supposed to go.   Suddenly she 
      hears: 

                                  MALE (O.S.)
                    Emily!

      She turns. And there is WILL RIDER (27).  Handsome and 
      charming.  The kind of guy who was definitely prom-king.  The 
      kind of flirt who can make anything sound suggestive.  Emily 
      sees him and brightens, exited.  Make that exuberant. 

                                  EMILY
                    Will!!!  Hi!!!  

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Take it down a notch, Emily.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                          (tries for cool)
                    Hey...hey there.  Sorry, a little 
                      overexcited.  First day of school 
                    jitters.  Not that we re in school 
                    anymore --

                                  WILL 
                    Don t be so sure.  I heard that 
                    hospitals are a lot like high 
                    schools.  And we re freshman all 
                    over again.

                                  EMILY
                    Bite your tongue.  
                          (then)
                    Which way do we go?

      He motions to the left and they start to walk together.

                                  WILL
                    So, what made you decide on Denver?

                                  EMILY
                    How could I turn down the chance to 
                    breathe the same air as Gina 
                    Beckett?  The woman pioneered the  
                      percutaneous valve replacement --                                                                                      4.


                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Not to mention the fact that you re 
                    here.

                                  WILL
                    Well, I m glad to see a friendly 
                    face...

      Will throws an arm around Emily.  She reacts:

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Okay, he s touching you.  Do not 
                    spaz out.  Do not. Spaz. Out.

      Her shoulders shake -- like when you get a little chill.   Or 
      have a little orgasm.

                                  WILL
                    You okay?

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    You totally spazzed out.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Yeah, just cold.

                                  WILL
                    Gotcha.  I heard this place can be 
                    cut throat.  So we gotta stick 
                    together, okay?

      Emily nods, grinning.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    You seem like you re in a good 
                    mood...

                                  EMILY
                    I am actually.   I ve been in 
                    school for 23 years straight --

      They push open the doors and walk into the locker room...

      INT. DOCTOR S LOCKER ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

      ... as they step inside:

                                  EMILY
                    I finally feel like I m entering 
                    the next phase of my life. 

      And that s when we hear:  

                                  GIRL (O.S.)
                    Pits?!                                                                                      5.


      Emily freezes.  Turns, ever so slightly...and there she.   
      CASSANDRA KOPELSON.  Beautiful, perfect, legs-up-to-there, 
      Cassandra Kopelson.  The girl who made Emily s life miserable 
      in high school.  Emily stares at her, dumbstruck.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                      Nooooooooooooo!

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Don t you recognize me?

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Do I recognize you?  You hid my 
                    clothes after gym class, you prank 
                    called my house, you tp d my 
                    car...you were my tormentor, my 
                    nemesis, the girl I debated against 
                    in those fateful debate club finals--  

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    I m just so bad with names...

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Cassandra Kopelson!  From high 
                    school!

                                  EMILY
                          (pretends to remember)
                    Oh... Oh!  Cassandra Kopelson!  Of 
                    course!  How are you?  

                                  CASSANDRA
                      Fantastic.  And you look as flat-
                    chested as ever --

                                  EMILY
                    Excuse me?

                                  CASSANDRA
                    I said you look as fabulous as 
                    ever.

      Oh.  Right.  Emily was clearly projecting.  She musters a 
      smile:

                                  EMILY
                    So, how in the world did you end up 
                    in Denver of all places?  

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Gina Beckett.  The woman s a 
                    genius.  First person to do a 
                      percutaneous valve replacement --                                                                                      6.


                                  WILL
                    Yeah, that s why Emily s here too.

      Great.  They re rivals.  Just like in high school.  A beat as 
      they both register this.  Then, Cassandra turns to Will:

                                  CASSANDRA
                    And you are...?

                                  WILL
                    Will Rider.  Nice to meet you, 

      Cassandra pours on the charm; this girl was born to flirt. 

                                  CASSANDRA
                    You too.  So tell me, Will Rider, 
                    how do you know Pits?

                                  EMILY
                    It s Emily, actually --

                                  WILL
                    We went to med school together.
                    What s with  Pits? 

                        EMILYCASSANDRA
      It s nothing, really --That was her nickname in high 
                                                    school--

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Where d it come from?

                                  CASSANDRA
                    You know, I can t remember--

                                  EMILY
                    Me neither.  That s why I go by 
                    Emily now.  Sometimes Em, 
                      occasionally Emme--

      Meanwhile, the other Interns have started to file out...

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Let s go.  We don t want to get off 
                    on the wrong foot.  I hear this 
                    place is cut throat.

                                  WILL
                    Literally just said that --

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Great minds.

      And they re exiting...                                                                                      7.


      INT.  HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

      Somehow, Emily is now trailing behind Will and Cassandra as 
      they chat.   She looks miserable.  Another intern, TYRA 
      GRANGER, catches up to her. Ty s a bit of an odd duck.  A 
      little Ally Sheady in breakfast club.  

                                  TYRA
                    That seemed awkward.

      Emily looks at her, surprised.  

                                  EMILY
                    Oh.  Yeah.  I just thought I left 
                    high school behind...

                                  TYRA
                      Hilarious.

                                  EMILY
                    I know, right?
                          (then)
                    Why exactly...is that hilarious?

                                  TYRA
                    Because a hospital is totally like 
                    high school.  

                                  EMILY
                    You know, that s the second time 
                    I ve heard that today.

      As they walk down the hall, Tyra points out different 
      doctors, each who look like the  archtype  she describes:

                                  TYRA
                    Because it s true.  There are the 
                    jocks, aka the orthopedic surgeons, 
                    mean girls go into plastics, the All-
                        American-girl-next-door types are 
                    gonna be in OB.  True geeks   
                    they re neurologists, the rebels are 
                    in the ER, the stoners   anesthesia, 
                    peds gets the sanctimonious church-
                    goers--

                                  EMILY
                    How about us?

                                  TYRA
                    Surgery s a melting pot.  Little of 
                      everything. Which basically means 
                    none of us get along.                                                                                       8.


      Emily looks at her, skeptical.  Not sure she buys the theory.

                                  EMILY
                    This is our first day, how do you 
                    know so much? 

                                  TYRA
                    I m the Principal s kid...aka the 
                    Chief of Staff s daughter.

                                  EMILY
                          (impressed)
                    Tim Granger s your dad?

                                  TYRA
                    Yeah.  But don t think I have a 
                    familial advantage.  Dad s not so 
                    into me.  Wanted a son, got a 
                    lesbian.   Not the same thing.  
                          (then)
                    FYI:  He s gonna act nice, tell you 
                    he wants to be your friend, but he 
                    doesn t.  That s just the way he 
                    ferrets out the weak ones.  Never 
                    show weakness.  

      And we PRELAP with:

                                  CHIEF GRANGER
                    I want you to think of me, not only 
                    as a boss, but also as a friend...

      INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Chief of Staff TIM GRANGER addresses our core group: Emily, 
      Will, Cassandra and Tyra. 

                                  CHIEF GRANGER
                    If each one of you does not reach 
                    your potential, I consider it a 
                    failure on my part.  And I do not 
                    like to fail.
                          (gaining momentum)
                    They say doctors have god 
                      complexes.  You know why?  Because 
                    we are gods.  We make hearts beat.  
                    We make lungs breathe.  We can make 
                    a feeble man walk and we can make a 
                    blind man see.  Each and every day, 
                    we perform miracles.  Never forget 
                    that.  We.  Perform. Miracles.

      Our group is hanging on his every word.                                                                                      9.


                                  CHIEF GRANGER (CONT D)
                    As surgeons, you will encounter 
                      everything.  So, your job as 
                    interns is to get familiar with 
                      everything: emergency medicine, 
                    internal medicine, obstetrics, 
                      orthopedics, pathology, neurology, 
                      gastroenterology.   In the course 
                    of a day, you will be paged by many 
                    different doctors in many different 
                      specialties.  Their expectations of 
                    you will be the same.  Exceed those 
                      expectations.  Crush those 
                      expectations. Obliterate those 
                      expectations.
                          (inspired and inspiring)
                    It s not going to be easy.  You are 
                    about to work harder than you ve 
                    ever worked.  You are about to 
                    sleep less than you ve ever slept.  
                    And you are about to learn more 
                    than you ve ever learned.  But if 
                    you stick with it, if you excel, 
                    you will be better than you ever 
                    thought you d be.  And that is all 
                    I ask of you:  Be better.  Be the 
                    best.
                          (then)
                    Welcome to Denver Memorial.

      A beat as our group absorbs the speech.  The Chief smiles, 
      motions to the two people flanking him.

                                  CHIEF GRANGER (CONT D)
                    Now, I d like to introduce your 
                    Resident, Doctor Micah Ellis --

      MICAH ELLIS (late 20 s) is a little bit of a nerd. The guy 
      you never notice until suddenly you grow up and realize that 
      he s kind of cute and besides, nerds are huge catches because 
      they are loyal and have slightly low self-esteem so they 
      probably won t cheat on you.  Micah gives a little wave.  

                                  CHIEF GRANGER (CONT D)
                    And of course, your Attending.  
                    Doctor Gina Beckett.

      Gina (40 s) rock star heart surgeon, is cold, cocky and 
      seemingly heartless.  Cassandra and Emily reflexively glance 
      at one another.  Emily looks away first.  

                                  CHIEF GRANGER (CONT D)
                    You might have heard that she 
                    pioneered the percutaneous valve 
                      replacement.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    10.

                                  CHIEF GRANGER (CONT D)
                    Well, that is just the tip of the 
                    iceberg, I can assure you.  Gina, 
                    they re all yours.

      Gina looks at the Interns.  Takes them in.  Then:

                                  GINA
                    We re walking.

      And with that, she starts out of the room.  Our group 
      scrambles to keep up.

      INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER

      The Interns hurry after Gina as she walks briskly down the 
      hall.

                                  GINA
                    Your job is to keep my patients 
                    alive.  Any issue you have, you 
                    bring to Micah.  Micah  brings it 
                    to me.  You and I... we don t talk 
                    unless absolutely necessary which I 
                    sincerely hope won t be the case. 
                    Don t even think about asking me 
                    when you ll be in an O.R.  Here s 
                    my answer.  Not for a while.  Each 
                    of you has a pager.  That is your 
                    lifeline.  Like Chief Granger said, 
                    you will be called to assist 
                      departments all over the hospital.  
                    Response time is critical.  When 
                    you are paged, you have sixty 
                    seconds to appear and yes, I have a 
                    timer.

      Emily is taking this all in, feeling completely overwhelmed 
      and completely intimated.  Micah leans over to her, whispers:

                                  MICAH
                    Breathe.

                                  EMILY
                    Is it that obvious?

                                  MICAH
                    I m a doctor.

      He smiles.  She smiles back, feeling just a little better.  

      INT. JULIA S HOSPITAL ROOM  -- 9 A.M.

      And now our group is on rounds.  A twelve-year-old girl, 
      Julia, is in the hospital bed; her Mother, ABBEY, sits 
      nearby.  Gina consults her chart.                                                                                      11.


                                  GINA
                    Julia was admitted yesterday after 
                    she fainted for the second time in 
                    gym class. 
                          (to Will)
                    Present.

      He glances at the chart, then presents the case.  

                                  WILL
                    The patient sustained contusions to 
                    face and head and was admitted for 
                    syncope work up and headache. CT 
                    shows no intracranial hemorrhage. 
                    EKG, Chest XRAY, CBC, and tox 
                    screen all within normal limits --

      As Will continues, Emily watches him; she clearly thinks he s 
      walks on water.  

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Medicine is all about the little 
                    details.  You have to pay attention 
                    to everything.  
                          (then)
                    Like that tiny nick on his jaw.  
                    Most likely a result of an 
                      overzealous razor... Man, he has a 
                    nice jaw.  The kind of jaw you d 
                    want to caress, if caress wasn t 
                    such an ooky word.  Although it 
                    does suit him.  Caress.  Caress, 
                    caress, car--

                                  GINA (O.S.)
                    Doctor Barnes?

      Oh.  Emily snaps to.  Everyone is looking at her.

                                  GINA (CONT D)
                    What is the prognosis?

      Emily reacts.  Right.  She glances at the chart.

                                  EMILY
                    The etiology of syncope likely to 
                    be vasovagal.

      Emily notices Julia looking at her, confused.  She explains:  

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Your body overreacted to something 
                      stressful, causing a sudden drop in 
                    your heart rate and blood pressure.  
                    Harmless.                                                                                    12.


                                  GINA
                          (annoyed)
                    Direct your answers to me.  And you 
                    are correct.  Congratulations 
                    Doctor Barnes, you ve earned a 
                    special assignment.

      Emily looks excited.  Cassandra looks jealous.  Then:

                                  GINA (CONT D)
                    You re in charge of discharge 
                      paperwork.

      Emily s face falls.  Cassandra brightens.  Gina exits, 
      Cassandra, Tyra and Will trailing behind her.  Will turns, 
      giving Emily a smile of encouragement as he leaves.  Once 
      everyone s gone:

                                  JULIA
                    Thanks for explaining.  I never 
                      understand what she s talking about.

                                  EMILY
                    Of course.  
                          (then)
                    So, your discharge instructions...
                          (looks at chart)
                    Huh.  Huh.  Okay... this is a 
                    little complicated.  Are you ready?

      Julia nods, looking solemn.  Emily looks equally serious.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Don t faint anymore.

      Julia laughs.  Her mom, Abbey, smiles too.  That s the thing 
      about Emily:  she has great bedside manner.  She knows how to 
      put people at ease.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    You re gonna be just fine.  

                                  JULIA
                    But what if I pass out again in 
                    front of Cody?

                                  EMILY
                    A boy you like?

                                  JULIA
                          (nods, then)
                    I see him in gym class, my heart 
                    races--                                                                                    13.


                                  EMILY
                    Trust me, I get it.  That heart 
                    racey thing happens to me too.

                                  JULIA
                    But you re an adult.

                                  EMILY
                      I appreciate the vote of 
                      confidence.  But the truth is,  
                    sometimes I still feel like a kid.
                          (then)
                    How about this? Next time you see 
                    him... sit down. Because I can t 
                    have you falling and hitting your 
                    head.  Or looking like a dork. 
                          (off Julia s smile)
                    But if your symptoms change in any 
                    way, if the episodes become more 
                    frequent, or if you feel your heart 
                    racing beyond the usual Cody-speed, 
                    I want you to come right back here, 
                    okay?  

      Julia nods.  Emily looks at Abbey who nods as well.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Alright, I m just gonna check your 
                    vitals once last time, then we ll 
                    unhook you.

                                  ABBEY
                    Sweetie, mind if I run out real 
                    quick to grab a cup of coffee?

                                  JULIA
                    No problem.

      Abbey heads out.  As Emily checks Julia s vitals:

                                  EMILY
                    So, I want to hear about this Cody 
                    guy.

                                  JULIA
                    He s so cute.  We got partnered up 
                    on a science project and I think he 
                    was flirting.  Which doesn t makes 
                    sense because he s not the kind of 
                    guy who would normally go for 
                    someone like me --

                                  EMILY
                    Hey, what does that mean?                                                                                    14.


                                  JULIA
                    He s really popular and he s got 
                    way better hair than Justin Beiber--

                                  EMILY
                      Popularity s overrated.  And you 
                    have pretty good hair yourself.  
                          (re: blood pressure cuff)
                    You re gonna feel the cuff 
                      tightening...

                                  JULIA
                    Thanks.  You know, that other 
                    doctor never even remembered my 
                    name.  She had to look at the chart 
                    every time.  You re different.

      Emily smiles.  Julia smiles back.  And then, suddenly, and 
      seemingly from out of nowhere, Julia starts coding!  The 
      monitors flat line!   Emily reacts,  panicked. She calls into 
      the hall:

                                  EMILY
                    I need a doctor!

      Nurse DOREEN (mid 40 s, been here forever, seen everything) 
      is already rushing into the room with a crash cart. 

                                  DOREEN
                    You are a doctor.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    A real doctor!  Get a real doctor!

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Page Dr. Beckett--

      The room is filling up with Nurses and Orderlies all waiting 
      for Emily s cue.  Emily stares at Julia for a beat. 

                                  EMILY  (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    What are you doing?  Run the code!  
                    Run.  The.  Code.

      And suddenly, Emily snaps into action.  She starts 
      compressions. 

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Pulse?

                                  DOREEN
                          (checking)
                    Thready --                                                                                    15.


                                  EMILY
                    I need 20 of etomodate, 100 of 
                    succinyl choline and the intubation 
                    kit? Where s the intubation kit? I 
                    need a tube in now --

      NURSE JESSICA (25, beautiful) starts to intubate.

                                    JESSICA
                    Copy that --

                                  DOREEN
                    Oxygen s dropping.  69 percent --

                    Hold Crich pressure! Hold, wait 
                    move, to the left. Ok right there. 
                          (then, to Doreen)
                    Why aren t the pads on?

                                  DOREEN
                    They won t stick, she s too sweaty--

                                  EMILY
                    Then dry her off!  Now!

      Julia s chest is dried off:

                                  DOREEN
                    Looks like v-tach --

      The paddles are in place.  Emily grabs them:

                                  EMILY
                    On three...Clear!

      She shocks her with the paddles.  Nothing --

                                  DOREEN
                    Rhythms s changing --

                                  EMILY

                    Bicarb s in --

      Emily looks up at monitor.  No change.

                                  EMILY
                    Clear!

      Another shock.  Nothing.                                                                                    16.


                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Give her 10 units of insulin! 50g 
                    of D50! 2 amps of Calcium -- 

      Emily resumes compressions.

                                    JESSICA
                    Insulin, glucose, calcium in --

                                  DOREEN
                    V-tach again!  We re losing her...

      Julia is running out of time!  Emily has no choice!  She 
      lifts her fist up and slams it down on Julia s chest, 
      punching her in the sternum.  A ventricular thump.  Silence.  

      The Nurses are in shock.   A beat as they all  stare at the 
      monitor which is a flat line for a long long second and 
      then... with a beep, it s back to sinus rhythm.  Julia opens 
      her eyes.  Emily is in shock, can t believe that just 
      happened, can t believe it worked.   Gina enters:

                                  GINA
                    What the hell happened in here --

                                  EMILY
                    She started coding, nothing was 
                    working, I did a ventricular thump--

                                  GINA
                          (taking charge)
                    I want a chem 7, CBC, INR, ABG, and 
                    an EKG stat.  Doreen I want another 
                    line in the left AC --

      People start moving again and Emily is shoved aside...

      INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE JULIA S ROOM

      Emily exits into the hallway where the other interns are 
      gathered.  Everyone starts congratulating her:  Oh my God.   
       You totally saved her life!   Way to go! 

      Emily is reeling, her head is spinning.  She puts her hands 
      on her forehead, tries to calm down.  And then, a voice:

                                  CASSANDRA 
                    Oh!  Now I remember why we called 
                    you Pits!

      Emily looks down, sees the sweat stains.  Off her mortified...


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    17.


                                        ACT TWO

      EXTREME CLOSE UP:

      Emily s head... sideways.  Her eyes dart back and forth.  
      PULL BACK to REVEAL we are in:

      INT. DOCTOR S LOUNGE -- 10:00 A.M.

      Emily s searching under the couch for something.  Not there.  
      Damn!  She gets up, looks under the next couch.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                      Nefarious.  N-E-F-A-R-I-O-U-S.  
                      Nefarious.

      Emily looks increasingly nervous, she races out.

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    That s the word that I spelled 
                    correctly in the 5th grade spelling 
                    bee to beat Cassandra --

      INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

      Emily is searching under the stalls as her V.O. continues.  

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Ever since then, she s targeted me.  
                    But the thing about Cassandra is, 
                    she s sneaky.  Nothing nefarious 
                    could ever be traced back to her.  
                    Like the debate club finals.  Right 
                    before we started, she  accidentally  
                    knocked over my index cards.  Sure, 
                    she helped pick them up but then on 
                    stage, I realized half of my notes 
                    were missing.  Hence... the flop 
                    sweat debacle. 

      Emily races out of the bathroom...

      INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER

      Emily is running through the halls, dodging and weaving, 
      looking on the ground as she runs.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    I knew Cassandra stole those notes, 
                    but it could never be proven.  Just 
                    like I can t  prove  now that she s 
                    the one who stole...                                                                                    18.


      INT. NURSE S STATION -- CONTINOUS

                                  EMILY 
                            (breathless)
                    My pager!  Have you seen my pager?

      Nurse Doreen shakes her head, no.  Meanwhile, Micah walks by.

                                  MICAH
                          (to Emily)
                    I ve got a full schedule, can you 
                    keep an eye out for labs on 601?  

      Emily smiles, tries to seem composed.

                                  EMILY
                    Of course.  Not a problem.

      Micah nods, keeps walking. Emily starts off in the opposite 
      direction.

                                  DOREEN
                    Pager s missing, huh?  So that s 
                    why you haven t been answering.

      Emily turns... scared.

                                  EMILY
                    Answering who?

      EXT. E.R. LOADING AREA -- 10:02 A.M.

      DR. IMELDA ANDAYA (a tiny little Asian girl whose short 
      stature and sweet face mask the fact that she s a thrill 
      seeking badass -- in and out of the ER) is waiting with a 
      team of two ER interns and Will.  Emily approaches, 
      breathless.  Dr. Andaya looks at her.  

                                  EMILY
                    I m sorry, I couldn t find my pager--

                                  DR. ANDAYA
                    What would Mount McKinley say if I 
                     couldn t find  my crampons?
                          (off Emily s confusion)
                    I don t care!  That s what the 
                    mountain would say!

      Before Emily can respond, an ambulance pulls up, a police car 
      close behind.  The ambulance doors swing open and two men 
      (early 20 s, brothers) are unloaded. One of them is more 
      seriously injured (DAN, 25,  clean cut, wearing a thick down 
      jacket); the other has superficial injuries (LEO, full sleeve 
      tattoos, piercings, 27).                                                                                        19.


      An EMT TECH (30 s, burly) starts talking as he wheels Dan 
      into the building.  

                                  EMT TECH
                    Motor vehicle accident. Multiple 
                      fractures, possible c spine trauma.  
                    Car was smoking, brother got him 
                    out.  BP stable, oxygen 92, blood 
                    alcohol level .13--  

      Dr. Andaya motions to her Interns, barking out commands: 

                                  DR. ANDAYA
                    Trauma 2, order a CT, get neuro 
                    down here STAT.  And be careful! 
                    Move that neck a millimeter, he 
                    doesn t walk.

       Almost as an afterthought she turns to Will and Emily: 

                                  DR. ANDAYA (CONT D)
                    Babysit the other guy until ortho 
                    shows up.

      The second EMT wheels Leo over to Will and Emily.  The right 
      side of Leo s face is bloody and swollen and his right arm is 
      hanging at an angle.  Leo is distraught.  

                                  LEO
                    My brother, is he going to be okay?

                                  EMILY
                    Just try to relax.  We won t know 
                    anything for a little while --

                                  LEO
                    It was last night.  We were 
                    drinking last night. We woke up 
                    early to get back into town, we 
                    didn t feel drunk--

      Leo sees a COP (30 s, tough) approaching.  

                                  LEO (CONT D)
                    I did that to him.  I was driving.  
                    Oh god, if he dies --

                                  WILL
                    You should stop talking...

                                  LEO
                    No.  It s my fault.  

      The Cop slaps a handcuff on Leo, attaching him to the gurney.                                                                                    20.


      INT. TRAUMA BAY -- 10:30 A.M.

      DR. IKE WEBSTER (30 s) -- orthopedist, sexist jock-in-
      residence examines a distraught Leo who is still handcuffed 
      to his bed.  The Cop sits in the room, on his i-Phone.  Will 
      and Emily observe.  Ike talks fantasy football as he performs 
      the exam.

                                  IKE
                          (to Will)
                    It s a half point-a-reception based 
                    league so I need guys that get 
                    targeted.  Most people don't look 
                    at that.  I do. That's why I took  
                    Welker so early.  Roddy White too. 
                          (to Leo)
                    Does this hurt?

      He presses on the shoulder, Leo winces.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    Thought so.  Looks like you got a 
                    couple of sick fractures.  I ll 
                    order you up some pain meds.
                          (to Emily)
                    He s gonna need a CT of the 
                    shoulder.

      Emily nods.  Ike turns back to Will.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    You know what else I need?

                                  WILL
                    Non contrast and thin cuts of the 
                    scapula --

                                  IKE
                    Plaxico.   I m offering Walters.  
                    That would make my team unbeatable.  
                      Seriously.  Un-beatable.

      And with that, he s off.  Emily takes this in.

                                  EMILY
                    Jocks in ortho.  Like Tyra said... 

      Before Will can ask what she means, Gina enters.  To Emily:

                                  GINA
                    Why are you ignoring my pages?

                                  EMILY
                    I m not.  I can t find --                                                                                    21.


                                  GINA
                    The rule is sixty seconds.

      She starts out.  Emily follows, upset.

      INT. JULIA S HOSPITAL ROOM -- 10:35 A.M.

      Gina glances down at her chart while Emily looks on.  

                                  GINA
                    Julia, you have what is called 
                    severe obstructive hypertrophic 
                      cardiomyopathy.  It s a disease of 
                    the heart in which the myocardium   
                    the middle of the three layers - is 
                      thickened. 

      Julia and Abbey both look freaked out.

                                  ABBEY
                    But her EKG was normal.

                                  GINA
                    The EKG just looks at the 
                      electrical system of the heart. 
                    Your daughter has a structural 
                      abnormality.  It s extremely rare 
                    for someone her age.  We had no 
                    reason to suspect it.  

                                  JULIA
                    So,  I wasn t fainting because of 
                    Cody?

      Gina looks confused.  Emily whispers:  

                                  EMILY
                    The boy she likes.

      Gina shoots her a withering look; she doesn t like being 
      shown up.  

                                  GINA
                    No.  You were fainting because you 
                    heart doesn t pump properly.  And 
                    we re going to have to reshape it 
                    with surgery.

      Abbey and Julia react, scared.

                                  ABBEY
                    Dr. Beckett, can I speak with you 
                    outside?

      Gina nods.  The two exit, leaving Emily and Julia alone.                                                                                       22.


                                  JULIA
                    So, how serious is it?

                                  EMILY
                    Serious.  But you re gonna be just 
                    fine.  Dr. Beckett s the best. 

                                  JULIA
                    You sure?

                                  EMILY
                      I promise.

      Julia still looks scared; Emily tries to distract her.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Now since we re alone, let s talk 
                    about the really important stuff.  
                    When are you going to tell Cody how 
                    you feel?

                                  JULIA
                    Let s see.  The day after... never.
                          (off Emily)
                    What if he rejects me?

                                  EMILY
                    What if he doesn t?

                                  JULIA
                    Does that doctor know how you feel?

                                  EMILY
                          (caught)
                    What?  

                                  JULIA
                    Oh, come on.  That doctor you were 
                    staring at during rounds. Brown 
                    curly hair, dimples,  hands that 
                    you want to linger at your neck, 
                    brush along your collarbone -- 
                          (off Emily s look)
                    Have you not read  Twilight? 

                                  EMILY
                          (laughs, then)
                    Okay, even if I was staring at him 
                    a little, that doesn t mean --

                                  JULIA
                    He totally likes you too.

      Emily looks at her, surprised.  And next thing she knows, 
      she s gossiping with a twelve year-old.                                                                                    23.


                                  EMILY
                    How could you tell?

                                  JULIA
                    He was looking at you!  When you 
                    were talking to me--

                                  EMILY
                    Looking?  Or looking looking?

                                  JULIA
                    Looking looking.

                                  EMILY
                    Can you tell the difference?

                                  JULIA
                    Of course.  I m twelve.
                          (off Emily, excited)
                    You should tell him how you feel--

                                  EMILY
                    I don t know--

                                  JULIA
                    You told me to tell Cody--

                                  EMILY
                    It s different.

                                  JULIA
                    No, it s not. Plus, if we don t 
                    tell them, someone else might get 
                    there first.  That happened to 
                    Jacob.  And Bella ended up having 
                    Edward s alien baby!  Which would 
                    blow --

                                  EMILY
                    It would blow.  Big time.

                                  JULIA
                    Okay, then.  I ll do it if you do 
                    it.

      Emily looks at her for a beat.  Why not?  

                                  EMILY
                    Deal.

      Julia holds out a pinky. And the girls pinky swear.                                                                                    24.


      INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE JULIA S HOSPITAL ROOM

      Emily exits Julia s room and is intercepted by Tyra who holds 
      up a pager.

                                  TYRA
                    Yours, I m thinking?

                                  EMILY
                          (grabs it, thrilled)
                    Where was it?

                                  TYRA
                    In the lounge.  I needed a five-
                    minute break.  Half a day and I ve 
                    already intubated, disempacted, 
                      catheterized, cauterized.  At least 
                    I think I cauterized, wasn t a 
                    hundred percent sure about that 
                      procedure, but fake it to you make 
                    it, right? 
                          (off Emily, horrified)
                    I m kidding.  Anyway, I felt it 
                    vibrating behind a couch cushion.  
                    I wonder how it got there.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    The wicked bitch of the West Wing.  

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Who knows.  Thank you so much.  

                                  TYRA
                    No problem.  Maybe you ll do me a 
                    favor at some point.

                                  EMILY
                    Of course, anytime.

                                  TYRA
                    How about now?

                                  EMILY
                    Huh?

      Tyra motions down the hall to where beautiful nurse Jessica 
      looks at a chart.  Jessica glances at them, then looks away.

                                  TYRA
                    She keeps staring at me.  But I 
                    can t tell if she s staring at me 
                    because she likes me, or because 
                    I m the Chief s kid.  So, I need 
                    you to suss it out.                                                                                    25.


      Emily doesn t like where this is heading.  

                                  EMILY
                      Suss...what out?

                                  TYRA
                    Whether she s gay or straight.
                          (Emily balks)
                    Come on, I helped you.

                                  EMILY
                    Why can t you do it?

                                  TYRA
                      Because... my dad doesn t exactly 
                    know that I dine at the Y.
                          (off Emily s surprise)
                    I lied before.  His dislike of me 
                    does not stem from my sexuality.  It 
                    stems from my personality. 
                          (then)
                    Look, I just don t want to ask her 
                    out if she s going to reject me.  Or 
                    worse, gossip about me.  I told you 
                    this place is like high school...
                          (then)
                    Please.  You said you d do me a 
                    favor... Please, please--

                                  EMILY
                    You re not going to stop bugging me 
                    until I say yes, are you?

                                  TYRA
                      Definitely not.

                                  EMILY
                    Fine, I ll do it --

      Luckily, her pager goes off, and she gets a reprieve...

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Later.

      INT. EXTERIOR RADIATION ROOM -- 10:45 A.M.

      Emily and Will are waiting in the darkened room, behind 
      glass, as the Radiologist takes a CT of Leo s shoulder.  
      Light shadows flicker across their faces from the imaging 
      computers.  It s strangely intimate.  Emily glances at Will. 

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Just do it.  Just tell him.                                                                                    26.


      A beat, as she tries to get up the nerve.  But she can t.

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Okay, I m going to move over a few 
                    inches so our shoulders are  
                    touching.  If he doesn t move, then 
                    he likes me.

      She gathers her courage.  And we watch as she moves, ever so 
      slightly over.  A little more... A little more... Until 
      finally their shoulders are touching.  A beat. Will doesn t 
      move!  Emily looks elated.  Then:

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Wait, maybe he doesn t feel it.  If 
                    he looks at me.  If he looks at me, 
                    I ll know he likes me.

      Will feels her eyes on him.  Looks over, smiles.  

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Say it, say it, say it --

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Will?

                                  WILL
                    Yeah?

                                  EMILY
                          (losing courage)
                    Nothing.

      Meanwhile, Ike enters from behind.  He looks at the monitor:

                                  IKE
                    Multiple fractures.  Sweet.

      And... the moment is officially broken.

      INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- 10:55 A.M.

      Will and Emily are wheeling Leo back to his room.   He s a 
      little looped on pain meds.  

                                  LEO
                    Have you heard anything yet?  About 
                    Dan?

                                  EMILY
                    We haven t.  But we ll let you know 
                    as soon as there s news.  

      Before he can reply, we hear Nurse Doreen:                                                                                      27.


                                  DOREEN (O.S.)
                    Miss, you can t go back there.

      Emily, Will and Leo turn; Leo recognizes the upset woman.

                                  LEO
                    Vicky!

      VICKY (20 s, pretty, well-dressed, pregnant) ignores Leo, 
      turns to Emily and Will, almost hysterical.  

                                  VICKY
                    Dan, where s Dan, where s my 
                    husband?

                                  LEO
                    They haven t heard anything --

                                  VICKY 
                          (ignoring him, to Will)
                    Where is he?

                                  WILL
                    Still in surgery.  C mon, I ll show 
                    you where to wait.

      As Will leads Vicky off,  Leo crumples.  

                                  LEO
                    She hates me--

                                  EMILY
                    I m sure she doesn t --

                                  LEO
                    Always has.  And now... now that 
                    I m fine and Dan is...
                          (breaks off)
                    It should have been me.  Danny, 
                    he s the good one.  He s the good 
                    one... 

      Emily feels for him.  And off Leo, distraught.

      INT. NURSE S STATION -- 11:30 A.M.

      Will is going over a chart with Doreen.

                                  WILL
                    Angela in 630 s gonna need serial 
                      hemoglobins every 4 hours.  And 
                    page me if her systolic gets below 
                    90.

      Doreen nods as Emily approaches.  Will turns to her:                                                                                    28.


                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Just heard that Dan s out of the 
                    woods.  Hairline fracture at C-5, 
                    but he ll walk.

                                  EMILY
                    Thank God.
                          (to Doreen)
                    Are the labs for 601--

      Doreen shakes her head,  no.  From behind, a voice:

                                  CASSANDRA (O.S.)
                    Heard you found your pager, Pits.

      Emily turns to find Cassandra walking past her.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Do not bait the beast, do not bait 
                    the beast...

      Oh, but she has to...

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                      Cassandra, hang on a second.

      Emily runs and catches up to her. Then, with a big fake smile: 

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Did you, by any chance, take my 
                    pager and hide it?

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Are you serious?  
                          (off Emily s nod)
                    I can t believe you re accusing me 
                    of something like that.

                                  EMILY
                    I m sorry.
                          (then)
                    Did you though?

                                  CASSANDRA
                    No, of course I didn t!

      Before Emily can respond, Micah approaches:  

                                  MICAH
                    You two, follow me.

      They start walking behind him...                                                                                    29.


                                  MICAH (CONT D)
                    78-year old female with late-stage 
                      Alzheimer's was brought in this 
                    morning complaining of an upset 
                    stomach.  CT showed a pseudocyst in 
                    her abdomen; it needs to be taken 
                    out before it ruptures.  But 
                      unfortunately, her daughter left 
                    and the patient s not mentally 
                    sound enough to give her consent.  
                    No consent means we have to wait 
                    until the rupture occurs. Not 
                    pretty. So, I need you to find her 
                    daughter.

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Of course.  What s her name?

                                  MICAH
                    That s the problem. No one can read 
                    the signature on the admitting 
                      paperwork. 

      He leads them into the room of Mrs. Coraline Ellish...

      INT. MRS. ELLISH S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

                                  MICAH
                    Mrs. Ellish, this is Dr. Kopelson 
                    and Dr. Barnes.  They re going to 
                    take good care of you, okay?

      MRS. ELLISH (70 s, sweet-faced) looks a little anxious.

                                  MRS. ELLISH
                    You'll help me find my daughter?

                        EMILYCASSANDRA
        Yes.Absolutely.

                                  MICAH
                    I ll check back in later, okay?

      Mrs. Ellish nods.  Micah heads out.  

                                  MRS. ELLISH
                    Marian knows she s not supposed to 
                    play outside after dark.  This is a 
                    safe neighborhood, but still, you 
                    never know.

                                  EMILY
                    So your daughter s name is Marian?                                                                                    30.


                                  MRS. ELLISH
                    Yes.  Marian Ellish.

                                  CASSANDRA
                          (sotto, to Emily, re: 
                            paperwork)
                    It looks like her last name starts 
                    with a  K .
                          (then, to Mrs. Ellish)
                    Did Marian get married maybe?  And 
                    change her name?

                                  MRS. ELLISH
                    Married?  She s only nine years-
                    old!
                          (then)
                    Would you excuse me, I have to use 
                    the powder room.

                                  EMILY
                    Do you need help?

                                  MRS. ELLISH
                    Help?  I should hope not.

      As Mrs. Ellish heads into the restroom, Cassandra and Emily 
      try to make sense out of the signature on the paperwork.

                                  CASSANDRA
                     Marian Kramden  maybe?

                                  EMILY
                    Or  Kamden?   
                          (takes out pen)
                    I ll write these down, we ll just  
                    have to make a lot of phone calls.  

      As she s writing, she tries another tact with Cassandra.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    You know, it was actually pretty 
                    funny.  The whole pager gag.  
                          (re: paper)
                    Maybe  Kommer? 

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Or  Konner?  And again: I didn t 
                    take your pager.

                                  EMILY
                    I wish you would come clean.  That 
                    could be an  s  at the end. 
                       Kraines?                                                                                     31.


                                  CASSANDRA
                          (increasingly angry)
                    There s nothing to come clean 
                    about.   Krasner. 

                                  EMILY
                          (equally angry)
                    It s just that I know you did it.  
                     Kravner  --

                                  CASSANDRA
                    You don t know anything!  Kraven  --

                                  EMILY
                    I do!   Kravitch  --

                                  CASSANDRA
                    I didn t steal it!   Kramden  --

                                  EMILY
                    We already said that!  And of course 
                    you stole it!  Just like you stole my 
                    debate club cards in high school!  

      Cassandra gasps.  But before she can respond,  a MALE ORDERLY 
      enters.  

                                  MALE ORDERLY
                    I m here to take Mrs. Ellish s 
                    vitals.

                                  EMILY
                    She s just in the bathroom --

                                  MALE ORDERLY
                    No, she s not.

      Emily and Cassandra look over.   The bathroom door is open 
      and Mrs. Ellish is gone!  The girls exchange looks; they race 
      into the hallway...

      INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MRS. ELLISH S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

      ...but there s no sign of the old lady.  Shit.  They were 
      supposed to find her daughter and instead they lost her!  And 
      off the girls, panicked... 


                                      END ACT TWO                                                                                    32.

      INT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- 11:45 A.M.

      And yet again, Emily is hurrying through the halls.  She 
      passes the Nurse s Station.  

                                  DOREEN
                    You lose that pager again?

                                  EMILY
                    No, not my pager...

      She rounds the corner and runs into Cassandra.  

                                  CASSANDRA
                    I checked the east wing.  Nothing.

      Before Emily can respond, Cassandra s pager goes off.  

                                  CASSANDRA (CONT D)
                    I have to get this.  I have four 
                    pending cases.  Just find her!

      And she s off, leaving Emily alone.  Screwed.  Emily hurries 
      to the Elevator Bank...

      INT. ELEVATOR BANK -- MOMENTS LATER

      Emily presses the button and waits.  The doors open to reveal 
      Micah, standing with Mrs. Ellish.  

                                  MICAH
                    I take it you haven t found her 
                    daughter yet?

      Micah and Mrs. Ellish exit the elevator.  Emily is mortified. 

                                  EMILY
                    We looked away for a second.  I m 
                    so sorry, Mrs. Ellish.  Let me take 
                    you back to your room.

                                  MRS. ELLISH
                          (getting confused)
                    My room?  Where am I?

                                  MICAH
                    In the hospital.

                                  MRS. ELLISH
                          (scared)
                    The hospital?  Why?                                                                                    33.


                                  MICAH
                    Because you re sick --

                                  MRS. ELLISH
                    No, I m not.  Who are you?  I want 
                    to go home --

                                  MICAH
                    It s okay, just try to relax --

      He reaches out to her, but Mrs. Ellish slaps his hand away.

                                  MRS. ELLISH
                    No!  You stay away from me!

                                  MICAH
                    Mrs. Ellish --

                                  MRS. ELLISH
                    Stay away!  I need to go home!  My 
                    daughter needs me!  

      The situation is spiraling out of control.

                                  EMILY
                    She does need you.  Because you re 
                    a really good mom.

                                  MRS. ELLISH
                    I am, I am a good mom --

                                  EMILY
                    But sometimes moms get sick, too.  
                    And when that happens you have to 
                    let people take care of you for 
                    once.

      Mrs. Ellish is calming down.  Emily continues:

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    And we re going to look after 
                    Marian until you re all better.  
                    We ll take good care of her, okay?

                                  MRS. ELLISH
                    You ll make sure she wears a hat 
                    outside?  It s cold, she hates 
                    wearing a hat. 

                                  EMILY
                      Absolutely.  And anything else you 
                    can think of, you just tell me and 
                    I ll take care of it.  Okay?                                                                                    34.


      Mrs. Ellish nods.  Micah is impressed.

                                  GINA (O.S.)
                    What s going on?

      They turn to find Gina standing there.  Micah covers:

                                  MICAH
                    Mrs. Ellish wanted to take a walk.  
                    Dr. Barnes accommodated.
                          (to Emily)
                    Why don t you take her back to her 
                    room now?  

      Emily nods, grateful, and starts to lead Mrs. Ellish away.

      INT. COMPUTER BAY BY NURSE S STATION -- 12:30 P.M.

      On the computer screen:  names and numbers of women with the 
      first name of  Marian  and a last name starting with  K.     
      Emily is on the phone:

                                  EMILY
                    So, if you re the person who 
                    dropped off your mother, please 
                    call us back.  Thank you.

      She hangs up, frustrated.  Looks at the list.  Next name.  
      But, before she can dial, Tyra leans over her:

                                  TYRA 
                    Now s your chance.

      Emily looks up and Tyra motions to Jessica at the Nurse s 
      station.

                                  EMILY
                    I can t.  I have to find Mrs. 
                    Ellish s daughter --

                                  TYRA
                    I ll make the calls.  C mon, it s 
                    the perfect time.

      Before Emily can protest, she finds herself being pushed out 
      of her seat.  She sighs and approaches the nurse s station.

      INT.  NURSE S STATION -- CONTINOUS

      Jessica is filling out paperwork.   Emily approaches, feeling 
      incredibly awkward. 

                                  EMILY
                    Hey.  I m Emily.                                                                                    35.


                                    JESSICA
                          (glancing up)
                    Jessica.

                                  EMILY
                    So where are you from?

                                    JESSICA
                    Wisconsin originally.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Do not mention cheese.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    I really love cheese.  

      Jessica rolls her eyes.  Emily wants to disappear, but she 
      forges on, trying to seem  casual. 

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    So, have you been in Denver long?

                                    JESSICA
                    About two years.

                                  EMILY
                    Cool.  I just moved here, so I m 
                    still getting to know the place.

      Jessica nods, still looking through papers.  Emily glances at 
      Tyra who is on the phone.  Tyra motions her to go on.  

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    So, what do you like to do on 
                    weekends?

      Jessica looks up.  Where is this going?

                                    JESSICA
                    I don t know, hang out, I guess.

                                  EMILY
                    Yeah, there s so much to do.  
                    Hiking, skiing, hitting up bars. 

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Be cool now...

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                          (trying for casual)
                    Speaking of bars, do you like gay 
                    ones or straight ones?

      Jessica reacts.                                                                                      36.


                                    JESSICA
                    Straight ones.  And just so you 
                    know, if I was gay, you wouldn t be 
                    my type. 

      With that, she walks off, leaving Emily unexpectedly 
      insulted.  Meanwhile, Doreen approaches, holds out a file.

                                  DOREEN
                    Labs for 601.

      Emily takes them, feeling humiliated.

      INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- 12:35 P.M.

      Emily turns a corner and spots Micah up ahead, talking to 
      Gina.  She stops.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                      I shouldn t interrupt.  Although he 
                    did say it was important.

      She starts towards them.

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But they might be talking about 
                    something more important.

      She stops.

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But he said to get it to him as 
                    soon as I got it.

       She starts again. 

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But Dr. Beckett hates being 
                      interrupted.  

      She stops.

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But what if this is an urgent case?

      She starts.

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But I don t want to piss her off --

      She stops.

                                  GINA (O.S.)
                    Are you seizing Dr. Barnes?                                                                                    37.


      Emily looks up to find Micah and Gina staring at her.  

                                  EMILY
                    No.  Sorry.  No.
                          (to Micah)
                    I have your labs.  For 601.

      She gives them to him.  But before Micah can look, Gina s 
      pager goes off.  She glances down.

                                  GINA
                    Hurry up --

      She starts running.  Micah motions for Emily to follow.  

      INT. DAN S HOSPITAL ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

      Gina, Micah and Emily rush in.  

                                  VICKY
                    He seemed okay and then all of a 
                    sudden...

      Dan (his head in a halo) is pale and unconscious.  His 
      breathing is labored.  Nurse Jessica is holding an oxygen 
      mask to his face.  Another nurse is monitoring his vitals.  
      Immediately Micah rips open his gown, feels his stomach...

                                    JESSICA
                    Pressure is dropping --

                                  GINA
                    He s bleeding out somewhere--

                                  MICAH
                    I m guessing splenic trauma --

                                  GINA
                          (to Jessica)
                    Call the O.R.  Let s get him 
                    prepped for surgery.

      Nurse Jessica rolls up the arms of the gurney and she and 
      Doreen start to roll Dan out.  

                                  GINA (CONT D)
                    Ready to take the lead?

                                  MICAH
                          (surprised)
                    Solo?  Absolutely.

      They hurry out, with the gurney.  Before Emily can follow, 
      Vicky grabs her arm.  Emily turns to her:                                                                                    38.


                                  VICKY
                    He makes me breakfast.  Every 
                    morning, even though he has to get 
                    up at five to do it. And he puts 
                    slippers at the foot of my bed so 
                    my feet never have to touch the 
                    ground.  And he sends checks back 
                    home to his mother, because his 
                    father died and her pension ran 
                    out...  
                          (her voice breaks)
                    He s going to be okay, right?  

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Who knows. A million things could 
                    go wrong.  He could go into shock, 
                    he could bleed out, his lungs could 
                    clot, his heart could stop...

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    He s in good hands.

      And off Vicky, hoping that s true.

      INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR OUTSIDE O.R. -- 1:30 P.M.

      Emily is watching Micah operate on Dan through the small 
      rectangular window right outside the O.R.  Will approaches 
      and watches with her.   

                                  EMILY
                      Ligamentous attachments have been 
                    taken down, hilum exposed--

                                  WILL
                    Splenic artery cross clamped?

      She nods.  Then:

                                  EMILY
                    Five years.  Micah s been here five 
                    years and he s just now getting a 
                    solo surgery.  

                                  WILL
                    Hey, we thought med school would 
                    last forever and it flew by.

                                  EMILY
                    It did, didn t it...

                                  WILL
                    Do you remember what Professor 
                    McCallum said when we got our 
                    cadaver in gross anatomy?                                                                                      39.


                                  EMILY
                     You will remember where you were 
                    standing.  You will remember your 
                    first cut. 

                                  WILL
                    Do you?  Remember?

      Emily looks at him, all raw emotion:

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Of course. I was standing next to 
                    you.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    I cut through the sternum.

                                  WILL
                    And I knew, watching you, that 
                    you d make a great surgeon.  You 
                    have the most amazing hands...

      Emily blushes.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Say it, say it, say it...

      But again, she can t bring herself to do it.  

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Thanks.

      From the O.R., Micah looks up at them.  Gives a thumbs up.

      INT. WAITING ROOM -- 1:35 P.M.

      Emily has just given Vicky the good news.

                                  VICKY
                    He s okay, really?

                                  EMILY
                    Really.  Doctor Ellis will be out 
                    to give you the details, but Dan s 
                    out of the woods.

      Vicky takes this in, her whole body relaxing.

                                  VICKY
                    I d like to see Leo, would that be 
                    okay?                                                                                    40.


      INT. LEO S HOSPITAL ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

      Emily leads Vicky into Leo s room.  

                                  EMILY
                    Leo?  You have a visitor.

      He looks up and sees Vicky.  Emily smiles.  And suddenly, 
      Vicky attacks Leo... hitting him, screaming at him.  

                                  VICKY
                    You almost killed him!  You 
                      sonovabitch, you almost killed him!

      Emily tries to peel her off, but Vicky is all adrenaline.  
      Leo just takes the assault, doesn t even try to move.

                        EMILYVICKY
      Stop, what are you doing, I hate you!  Do you hear me?  
      stop!You should have been in there 
          (calling out)-- it should have been you 
      Help!  We need help in here--getting cut open --

      Orderlies run into the room and help restrain Vicky --

                                  VICKY (CONT D)
                    No!  Stop!  He almost killed my 
                    husband, he almost killed him --

      Finally, they get her out of the room.  Silence.  Emily looks 
      at Leo, who stares, stoic.

                                  EMILY
                    Are you okay?

                                  LEO
                    Fine.  I m fine.

                                  EMILY
                    Let me just check you out --

                                  LEO
                    I said I m fine.

      But Emily opens his robe and that s when she sees... a red 
      abrasion on his upper right chest.  She looks further and at 
      his waist, on the left, another red abrasion.  

                                  LEO (CONT D)
                    She didn t do that.                                                                                    41.


                                  EMILY
                    I know she didn t.  It s a classic 
                    seatbelt abrasion. 
                          (realizing)
                    From a seatbelt fastened on the 
                    passenger side... You weren t 
                    driving were you?

                                  LEO
                    Of course I was  --

                                  EMILY
                    No.  You weren t.  
                          (it s all coming together)
                    Your brother had splenic trauma.  
                    But we didn t look for that because 
                    it usually happens when the abdomen 
                    hits the steering wheel.  And you 
                    said he was the passenger.

                                  LEO
                    You don t know what you re talking 
                    about --

                                  EMILY
                    I think I do.

                                  LEO
                    No!  You don t!
                          (then)
                    Look, you don t get it.  All my 
                    life, I ve been a screw-up.  But 
                    not Dan.  He s the good one.  The 
                    one who bails me out.  Only one in 
                    the family to go to college, to go 
                    to law school.  He s interviewing 
                    to work in the D.A. s office.  
                          (then, firm)
                    He wasn t driving.  Trust me, I m 
                    the screw up.  He s the good one.

      Off Emily, taking this in...

      INT. NURSE S STATION -- 2:15 P.M.

      Emily approaches Doreen:

                                  EMILY
                    You paged me?

      Doreen points to a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN standing nearby.  

                                  DOREEN
                    Says she s here to sign consent 
                    papers for her mother.                                                                                      42.


      Emily nods, then heads over to the woman.

                                  EMILY
                    Hi.  I m Dr. Barnes --

                                  MARIAN
                    Marian Kramden.  I got your 
                    message.  You have papers for me to 
                    sign?

                                  EMILY
                    Of course.  Let s go to your mom s 
                    room, we can take care of it there.

                                  MARIAN
                    I d rather do it here.  

                                  EMILY
                    Don t you want to see your mother?

                                  MARIAN
                    That woman isn t my mother.
                          (off Emily, confused)
                    My mother was smart.  She was 
                    vibrant, she was a great cook, she 
                    told dirty jokes, she never forgot 
                      a birthday --

                                  EMILY
                    She s still the same person--

                                  MARIAN
                    No.  She s not.
                          (then)
                    For the last three years I ve done 
                      everything for her   fed her, 
                    bathed her, put her to bed   and 
                    every morning, every single morning 
                    -- she asks who I am.

      She s clearly in pain, but she s determined not to break.

                                  MARIAN (CONT D)
                    I just can t do it anymore.  I m 
                    done.

      And off this declaration...


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    43.


                                        ACT FOUR

      INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- 2:30 P.M.

      Emily is walking down the hallway, carrying a bag of tubes,  
      when Cassandra catches up to her. 

                                  CASSANDRA
                    What are you doing?

                                  EMILY
                    Running blood down to the lab.

                                  CASSANDRA
                    No, about Marian Kramden.  She s 
                    waiting, Doreen said you have the 
                      paperwork...

                                  EMILY
                    I do. 

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Well, are you going to give it to 
                    her?

                                  EMILY
                    No.  I m not.

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Why?

      Emily stops walking, spins around.

                                  EMILY
                    Because she wants to abandon her 
                    mother!  And if she does that, Mrs. 
                    Ellish,  a kind and compassionate 
                    woman who devoted her life to her 
                    daughter, is going to spend her 
                    last days in a state-run facility, 
                    where she ll most likely have no 
                    visitors and where she ll most 
                    certainly die.  So no, I m not 
                    giving her daughter any papers 
                    until I figure out how to convince 
                    her to do the right thing!

      And suddenly Emily s pager goes off.  She glances at it, 
      looks confused...

      INT. CHIEF GRANGER S OFFICE -- 2:35 P.M.

      Emily is standing in front of Chief Granger.  He is smiling.                                                                                    44.


                                  DR. GRANGER
                    ...And I know this place can be 
                      overwhelming, so I like to check in 
                    with my interns from time to time, 
                    see how they re doing.

                                  EMILY
                          (smiling back)
                    Oh.  Thanks.  So far so good.

                                  DR. GRANGER
                    Good.  Great.  
                          (then, bigger smile)
                    Because I actually got word of a 
                    little run in between you and a 
                    nurse?

                                  EMILY
                    Huh?

                                  DR. GRANGER
                    Jessica?  I think that s her name?

      Emily reacts as she realizes what he s talking about.

                                  DR. GRANGER (CONT D)
                          (kindly)
                    Why don t you tell me what 
                    happened? 

                                  EMILY
                    Oh.  Well, I --

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Abort!  Abort!  Remember -- he s 
                    not a friend!

      She stops talking abruptly, stares at him.

                                  DR. GRANGER
                    You...?

                                  EMILY
                    I... am not sure what you re 
                    talking about.

      And just like that, his smile fades.  He is suddenly very 
      serious.  And a little scary.

                                  CHIEF GRANGER
                    Were you or were you not inquiring 
                    about her dating practices?                                                                                    45.


                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    I was doing a favor for your 
                    daughter!

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    I was just trying to get to know 
                    her...

                                  CHIEF GRANGER
                    Well, be careful how you  get to 
                    know someone.   We have very strict 
                    rules in this hospital with regards 
                    to sexual harassment.

      Emily reacts, horrified.  Sexual harrassment?!  Granger 
      continues:

                                  CHIEF GRANGER (CONT D)
                    You re lucky she didn t file a 
                    formal complaint.   
                          (then)
                    You re on notice, Dr. Barnes.  
                    Don t let this happen again.

      And off Emily, shaken up.

      INT. JULIA S HOSPITAL ROOM -- 3:00 P.M.

      Emily enters, reeling a little, to find Julia texting.  

                                  JULIA
                    What s a non-dorky way to say  I 
                    can t wait? 

                                  EMILY
                     I m awash with anticipation,    
                     I m intoxicated by the prospect,  
                     I m yearning for the moment  --

                                  JULIA
                    I ll go with  I can t wait. 

                                  EMILY
                    What can t you wait for?

                                  JULIA
                          (grins, then)
                    My date with Cody.

                                  EMILY
                    You told him?!

                                  JULIA
                    Yes.  And he likes me too!                                                                                    46.


                                  EMILY
                          (in shock)
                    Wow.  Wow...

                                  JULIA
                    You don t have to seem so surprised 
                    --

                                  EMILY
                    No, I m not surprised.  I m 
                      impressed.  That took ball--
                          (oops, realizes)
                    --very...

                                  JULIA
                    What s ballvery?

                                  EMILY
                    I said bravery.  Good for you.

                                  JULIA
                    I take it you haven t told Dr. 
                    Will?

                                  EMILY
                    I ve been swamped.  I m a doctor, 
                    you know.

                                  JULIA
                    Yeah, I do know.  
                          (then, vulnerable)
                    You re doing my surgery, right?

                                  EMILY
                    Oh, sweetie.  I can t.  You need 
                    someone experienced.

      And suddenly Julia drops the bravado; she looks vulnerable.

                                  JULIA
                    That mean doctor? 

                                  EMILY
                    She s not mean.  She s just... not 
                    nice.  But she is the best.  You 
                    want the best --

                                  JULIA
                    I want you.  You care about me.

                                  EMILY
                    She does too.                                                                                    47.


                                  JULIA
                    No, she doesn t.
                            (vulnerable)
                    Can you at least be in the room?  
                    To make sure I m okay?  Please?

      Julia suddenly looks very young.  And very scared.

                                  EMILY
                    I guess you can request that I m in 
                    there with you...

      Julia grins.  And we PRELAP WITH:

                                  GINA (O.S.)
                    You told her she could request you 
                    in there?!

      INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE NURSE S STATION -- 3:15 P.M.

      Gina is reaming Emily out! 

                                  EMILY
                    I m sorry, I didn t know what to say--

                                  GINA
                    You say you don t know what the 
                    hell you re doing!  You say that 
                    even though you think you re hot 
                    stuff you re not!  And you say that 
                    you don t know if you ll ever be in 
                    a surgery because right now, your 
                    attending physician is so pissed 
                    off, she doesn t even want to look 
                    at you!

      And with that, Gina walks off, leaving Emily alone, looking 
      miserable.  A beat, and then there s a hand on her shoulder.  
      Emily turns and it s Will.  He s witnessed the tirade.  

                                  WILL
                    You re a rockstar, she ll realize 
                    it soon enough.

      She looks at him.  He pulls her in for a much needed hug.  
      And that s the opening Emily needs.  Raw, emotional, feeling 
      reckless,  she blurts it out:

                                  EMILY
                    I like you.

      Will reacts.  But before he can reply, Emily continues, her 
      words pouring out fast... so she can t stop them.                                                                                    48.


                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    I ve liked you since you cracked 
                    the chest of our corpse in gross 
                    anatomy.  You took the heart out 
                    and held it in your hands and I 
                    remember thinking, that could be my 
                    heart, he might as well be holding 
                    my heart.  And I was too shy to say 
                    anything, and then once we became 
                    friends I didn t want to jeopardize 
                    the friendship... but I know if I 
                    don t say anything, then we ll 
                    always just be friends and I don t 
                    want to be the shy girl wishing my 
                    life will turn out the way I want 
                    it to.  I have to make it turn out 
                    the way I want it to.  And what I 
                    want -- what I really, really, want 
                    -- is you.  

      She looks at him full of hope and expectation and 
      vulnerability.  He looks back at her for a beat.  Then:

                                  WILL
                          (feels badly)
                    I m so sorry.   I just don t see 
                    you like that. But I m so touched 
                    by what you said, I really am.  And 
                    I hope that we can still be 
                    friends, because I really value 
                    your friendship.

      Emily absorbs this, her heart breaking.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Do not cry.  Don t you dare cry.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                          (forces a smile)
                    Of course we can be friends.  I  
                    Just wanted to get that off my 
                    chest.  And now it s off... so 
                    that s great.  

      And off Emily, trying not to crumble...


                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    49.


                                        ACT FIVE

      INT. STAIRWELL -- 3:30 P.M.

      Emily fights tears as she digs into a package of Ring Dings.  
      There are many other snacks around her.  Micah enters. 

                                  MICAH
                    Doreen saw you come in here with 
                    half the vending machine.  You okay?

                                  EMILY
                          (eating Ring Dings)
                    Oh yeah.  Really great.
                          (off his look, words pour 
                            out)
                    Except for the fact that Gina hates 
                    me and the Chief thinks I m a 
                    pervert and the guy I love isn t 
                    going to have alien babies with me, 
                    and my high school nemesis is being 
                    nefarious and these are really 
                    really stale. 

      Upset, she takes another huge bite out of a Ring Ding.

                                  MICAH
                    You lost me at alien babies.

                                  EMILY
                    I m just having the worst day...

      Micah looks at her for a beat.  Then:

                                  MICAH
                    Follow me.

      And he starts out.  Emily grabs the Ring Dings and follows...

      INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER

      Micah walks down the hall with Emily.  As he walks, he points 
      to various hospital rooms.

                                  MICAH
                    That man in there?  He s going to 
                    have to learn to walk again without 
                    a leg. 
                          (points to another room)
                    And that woman in  there, she s 
                    going to have a colostomy bag for 
                    the next six months.  
                          (another room)
                    And the woman in 601? 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    50.

                                  MICAH (CONT'D)
                    She s going to be told she has 
                    stage IV pancreatic cancer.  Her 
                    son will try to sell her on the 
                    fact that there are all these new 
                    trials that she can get into, but 
                    you and I know the truth.  Six 
                    months.  A year if she s lucky.  
                    And she s going to feel sick every 
                    single day of that year.   So no.  
                    You re not having the worst day.  
                    Not by a long shot.

      Emily immediately feels silly.  He s so right.  

                                  EMILY
                          (chagrined, joking)
                      I meant... the worst hair day.

      He smiles, appreciates the humor.  Then, genuine:

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Thanks.  You must think I m 
                      incredibly self-absorbed...  

                                  MICAH
                    No.  Just human.  Now, hand over 
                    those Ring Dings and get back to 
                    work.

      She pulls a pack from her pocket and gives it to him.

                                  MICAH (CONT D)
                    And the other one.

      She pulls out another.  He smiles.  And off this warm moment.

      INT. DAN S HOSPITAL ROOM -- 3:45 P.M.

      Emily is checking Dan s vitals.  He s groggy, but awake.

                                  EMILY
                    You gave us quite a scare. Open up.

      He opens his mouth, Emily puts in a paper thermometer.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    I m so glad you re feeling better.  
                    Your brother, though, he s in a 
                    world of trouble.  You know, since 
                    he was driving.  Seems to think he 
                    deserves it though.  Keeps saying 
                    you re the good one, you re the 
                    good one.
                          (looks at him, pointedly)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    51.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    I believe him.  I think you are 
                    good.

      She takes the thermometer out, glances at it.  

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    98.2.  Very good.

      INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- 4:00 P.M.

      Emily exits the room, when: 

                                  WOMAN (O.S.)
                    There you are!

      She turns to find an angry Marian Kramden.  

                                  MARIAN
                    I ve been waiting to sign papers 
                    for over three hours.  What is the 
                    hold-up?

      Emily looks at her, knows she can stall no longer.

                                  EMILY
                    I m sorry.  I have them.  This way.

      INT. NURSE S STATION -- MOMENTS LATER

      Emily hands the papers to Mrs. Kramden.  Marian looks at her, 
      feeling guilty.  Then:

                                  MARIAN
                    It s not like I planned to do this, 
                    you know.  I brought her in to be 
                    seen and then I had to go to work.  
                    The nurse told me not to worry, she 
                    said they d take good care of her.  
                    So I left.  And then, when I was 
                    driving away, I just had this 
                      overwhelming sense of relief.  That 
                    someone else was watching her.  
                    That it didn t have to be me 
                    anymore.

                                  EMILY
                    I know it s a lot of work.  But 
                    your mother, she needs you--

                                  CASSANDRA (O.S.)
                    Back off.  You have no idea what 
                    this woman s going through.

      Emily and Mrs. Kramden turn to find Cassandra there.                                                                                    52.


                                  EMILY
                      Cassandra, what are --

                                  CASSANDRA
                    I mean it.  You have no idea what 
                    it s like to care for someone 24 
                    hours a day, so you can t possible 
                    judge --

                                  MARIAN
                    Exactly.  

                                  CASSANDRA
                          (to Marian)
                    Trust me, I get it...  I ve lived 
                    through it.  My brother had cystic 
                    fibrosis.  He was sick his whole 
                    life.  

      Emily reacts.  She had no idea.  Cassandra continues.

                                  CASSANDRA (CONT D)
                    Growing up, we had a hospital bed 
                    in our living room.  I couldn t 
                    invite anyone over because my 
                    parents were afraid he d catch a 
                    cold.  Everything -- every single 
                    thing-- revolved around my brother.  
                    His progress, his setbacks.... 
                    After a while, I couldn t take it.  
                    I just stayed out of the house. 
                    Because when I was home, all I 
                    thought about was death.  
                          (painful admission)
                    Sometimes I even prayed for it, 
                    because that would be easier than 
                    waiting for his lungs to scar so 
                    much that he would slowly 
                      suffocate... which is what happened.

      Emily listens in shock, moved.  Cassandra continues:

                                  CASSANDRA (CONT D)
                    But there were these other moments -
                    - little moments -- when he felt 
                    better.  When we d watch TV or 
                    complain about my parents or fight 
                    over the last Oreo...
                          (she s emotional)
                    And those moments -- those stupid 
                    little moments -- I d give anything 
                    to have one of them again.
                          (then, staying strong)
                      Illness... it changes what you are 
                    capable of.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    53.

                                  CASSANDRA (CONT D)
                    But it doesn t change who you are.  
                    And your mother...she might not 
                    always recognize you, but she does 
                    love you.  And I know that for a 
                    fact, because the whole time she s 
                    been in the hospital -- the whole 
                    time -- she s been looking for you.

      Marian s eyes well up; Cassandra s reached her.  Emily 
      reacts, emotional as well.

      INT. MRS. ELLISH S ROOM -- 4:10 P.M.

      Marian enters.  Mrs. Ellish looks over at her, blankly.

                                  MRS. ELLISH 
                    Who are you?

                                  MARIAN
                    I m your daughter.  I m here, Mom.

      And we PULL BACK...

      EXT. MRS. ELLISH S ROOM -- SAME TIME

      To reveal Cassandra and Emily watching this interaction from 
      behind the window.  Emily looks at Cassandra, moved.  Beat.

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Okay, that look on your face?  
                    That s the reason I didn t tell 
                    anyone in high school.  I don t 
                    need your pity.  And just because I 
                    had a sick brother doesn t mean I m 
                    not a bitch. 

                                  EMILY
                    Trust me, I know.  You re a huge 
                    bitch.

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Thank you, I appreciate that.

      Despite themselves, the girls share a smile.  Then:

                                  EMILY
                    But why are you?  Such a bitch to 
                    me?  What did I ever do to you?

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Oh come on.  You really need me to 
                    say it?
                          (off Emily)
                      Everything always came so easy to 
                    you.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    54.

                                  CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    I mean, not the looks thing or the 
                      popularity thing, but the school 
                    thing --

                                  EMILY
                          (disbelief)
                    You were... jealous?

                                  CASSANDRA
                      I wouldn t say jealous.

                                  EMILY
                          (absorbing this)
                    You were.  You were jealous.

                                  CASSANDRA
                    If you ever repeat that, I ll deny 
                    it.  And I ll probably spread a 
                    nasty rumor about you.

      Emily laughs.  The moment is interrupted by Emily s pager.  
      She checks it.  Her expression changes:

                                  CASSANDRA (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  EMILY
                    My patient... she s still insisting 
                    I m in on her surgery.
                          (realizing, elated)
                    I m gonna be in on a surgery...

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Good luck.
                          (Emily smiles, then)
                    Don t freeze up the way you froze 
                    up during the debate club finals.  

                                  EMILY
                    I knew you stole those cards!

                                  CASSANDRA
                    You know, you really need to get 
                    over high school already.

      Emily takes this in. 

                                  EMILY
                    That s true.  I do. 
                          (then)
                    But just admit it.  Please.

                                  CASSANDRA
                    Eh, it s been so long, who can 
                    remember?                                                                                    55.


      Emily shakes her head.  And off the small d tente...

      EXT. O.R. SCRUB ROOM -- 4:30 P.M.

      Emily scrubs in next to Gina.  Gina is cold.  Still angry.  

                                  GINA
                    You watch.  You don t talk, you 
                    don t touch.

      And with that, she strides into the O.R.

      INT. O.R. -- 4:50 P.M.

      CLOSE ON:  Julia s face.  Asleep.  She looks so young, so 
      vulnerable.  WE PAN DOWN, past the blue curtain at her 
      neckline and REVEAL:  her open chest cavity.  Her heart is 
      exposed.  Gina is at work.  Three residents and three Nurses 
      are assisting as needed.  Emily stands back, at a distance.   

                                  GINA
                    And after six courses, they brought 
                    out dessert.  Honestly, I didn t 
                    think I could eat any more...

      As Gina continues to talk, M.O.S., we hear Emily s V.O.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Here s the thing about being in 
                    surgery:  doctors never talk about 
                    the surgery.  They talk about 
                      everything else -- husbands, wives, 
                    children, pets, plumbers... but 
                    never the surgery.  Once they start 
                    talking about the surgery,  there s 
                    usually something wrong.

                                  GINA
                    It s a pretty good restaurant, you 
                    should try it.  Cooley clamp.

      A NURSE hands her one; she continues to work.

                                  GINA (CONT D)
                    Doctor Barnes.  What are hemoglobin 
                      parameters for hemostatis?

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    This could be a trick question.  
                    She said not to talk.

                                  GINA
                    Doctor Barnes!                                                                                    56.


                                  EMILY
                    12-15 g/dL using packed RBCs to 
                    optimize O2 delivery --

                                  GINA
                    Platelet parameters --

                                  EMILY
                    Above 100,000/mcL.

                                  GINA
                    Clotting time?

                                  EMILY
                    180-240 seconds.

                                  GINA
                    What do I want for dinner tonight?

                                  EMILY
                    Um... Thai?

                                  GINA
                    Wrong.  Italian.

      And Gina smiles.  Just a little. 

                                  GINA (CONT D)
                    Huh.  We re still getting some flow 
                    behind the mitral valve.   Let s 
                    resect a little, see if we can 
                    increase the size of the outflow.  
                    Kelley clamp.

      She s talking about the surgery.  The room is a little tense.  
      Gina holds out her hand; the nurse hands her another 
      instrument.  Suddenly the machines start beeping.

                                  CARDIO NURSE
                    Blood pressures s dropping.

      And then, without warning, blood starts spurting out of 
      Julia s heart.  Commotion in the room:

                                  GINA
                      Irrigation, I can t see the field --

      A Nurse tries to irrigate; there s too much blood.  
      Meanwhile, the monitors are beeping, the numbers are falling.

                                  CARDIO NURSE
                    70 over palp--                                                                                    57.


                                  GINA
                    We ve got to stop this bleeding 
                    now!

      And off Julia, suddenly in a lot of trouble.


                                    END OF ACT 5                                                                                    58.


                                        ACT SIX

      INT. O.R. -- 4:51 P.M.

      Julia is in trouble; Gina and her team are desperately trying 
      to stop the bleeding!   Everyone is busy, Emily is the only 
      one observing, the only one who is not working.

                                  GINA
                    I need hemostasis here!  Move.  
                    Move!  Retract the anterior leaflet.  
                    I said retract.  Not too much!
                          (to Emily)
                    Get in here, now!

      Emily hurries over.

                                  GINA (CONT D)
                    Place your finger here, apply 
                    steady pressure, and whatever you 
                    do, don t move.  Can you handle 
                    that?

                                  EMILY
                    Yes, of course.  Yes.

      And suddenly, she s got her hand in the body, she s 
      staunching the blood flow!

                                  GINA
                    Five-oh!

      She holds out her hand, a suture is placed in it.  She goes 
      to work. 

                                  GINA (CONT D)
                      Pursestring.  Cinch.  Don t move 
                    that finger, Doctor Barnes.  Tie.

      Silence as she works.  And then, the bleeding stops.  The 
      tension in the room starts to ease...

                                  GINA (CONT D)
                    Okay, now I m going to make a 2-
                    inch incision around the apex of 
                    the heart.

                                  EMILY
                      Ventricular remodeling...

                                  GINA
                    Exactly.   We re removing the 
                    muscle that encroaches on the 
                      cavity...Okay.  That should do 
                    it...                                                                                    59.


      A beat as they look to the monitors.  Then:

                                  CARDIO NURSE
                      Blood-pressure s rising.

      And the team exhales.  Julia s going to be alright.

      EXT. O.R. -- 5:15 P.M.

      Emily is taking off her blood spattered surgical gown.  Gina 
      is scrubbing down.  A beat, then:

                                  GINA
                    So you didn t completely embarrass 
                    me in there.

      Emily turns, surprised by the compliment.  Gina puts out her 
      fist for a fist bump and Emily, thinking she s trying to 
      shake her hand, ends up shaking Gina s fist.  It couldn t be 
      more awkward.   Gina shakes her head and walks off.  Emily is 
      mortified once again.  But in the scheme of things, an 
      awkward fist-bump/handshake just isn t that bad.  She smiles.

      INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- 5:30 P.M.

      Vicky, Dan s fianc e, is pacing outside of Leo s room.  She 
      sees Emily and hurries over, distraught:

                                  VICKY
                    Dr. Barnes, it was Dan.  He was 
                    driving.  He called the police.  He 
                    turned himself in.

                                  EMILY
                          (feigning surprise)
                    Really?

      Vicky nods.  Then, she looks through the window at Leo, in 
      his hospital bed, all alone.

                                  VICKY
                    What do I even say to him?

                                  EMILY
                    How about... I m sorry.

      And we PRELAP with:  

                                  GIRL S VOICE (O.S.)
                    I m sorry.

      INT. HOSPITAL LOCKER ROOM -- 5:45 P.M.

      It s Tyra.  Emily is getting her things from her locker.                                                                                    60.


                                  TYRA
                    I heard you got in trouble with my 
                    dad.  Of course, I heard it in the 
                    context of  watch out for that 
                    predatory lesbian,  but still... 

                                  EMILY
                    I just don t understand why you 
                    won t tell him.  I mean, you don t 
                    seem the closeted type.

                                  TYRA
                    I m not.  I m the organize-the-
                    march type.  Have been since 
                    college.  But with my dad...it s 
                      different.   He s only ever been 
                    with my mom.  They met in high 
                    school, they have this Beaver 
                    Cleaver marriage.  

                                  EMILY
                    He might surprise you --

                                  TYRA
                    He won t.  He s judgemental and 
                      self-righteous and horrifically 
                      close-minded and... I still feel 
                    like a goddamn kid around him. 
                          (then)
                    Anyway, thanks for covering for me.   
                    You re way cooler than you look. 

      She smiles, Emily smiles back.  Tyra starts out, when:

                                  EMILY
                    Wait.  Why don t I look cool?

                                  TYRA
                          (laughs, then)
                    Come on, you know what I mean.

      And off Emily, trying to figure it out.

      INT. ELEVATOR BANK -- 5:55 P.M.

      Emily, still in scrubs, waits with a group of people.  The 
      doors open, revealing a packed elevator.  Emily motions of 
      the other people to go ahead of her.  She turns, heads 
      towards the stairs...

      INT. CORRIDOR/STAIRWELL -- 6:00 P.M.

      Emily opens the door to the stairwell.  She enters and that s 
      when she sees:  Chief Granger, hugging Nurse Jessica.  It s a 
      clear romantic embrace.  Emily freezes.                                                                                      61.


      So that s why Jessica was staring at Tyra!  The two look up, 
      quickly separate.  Emily and the Chief make eye contact.   
      She turns and hurries back out...

      INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

      Emily walks away from the stairwell, wishing she could unsee 
      that.   Guess he s not so  Beaver Cleaver  after all.  
      Meanwhile, Micah approaches.

                                  MICAH
                    Heard you kicked ass in surgery.  
                    Not the worst day after all?

                                  EMILY
                          (smiles)
                    No. It wasn t.  You leaving?

                                  MICAH
                    Not just yet.  See you tomorrow. 

      She waves and heads off.  We stay with Micah.  He watches her 
      for a beat, then heads down the corridor and stops in front 
      of Room 601.  Micah takes a deep breath.  Then enters:

      INT. ROOM 601 -- 6:05 P.M.

      The FEMALE PATIENT (mid-60 s) looks up expectantly as Micah 
      enters.

                                  MICAH
                    Hi Mom.

                                    MICAH S MOTHER
                    Just tell me the truth.

                                  MICAH
                          (trying for optimistic)
                    You have pancreatic cancer.  But 
                    look, there are all these great new 
                    trials that I can get you into...

      And off Micah the son, not Micah the doctor...

      INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER

      We pick up Emily, walking past the hospital rooms and the 
      patients she helped today:

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    The thing about being an adult that 
                    no one tells you when you re 
                    growing up is that you don t feel 
                    like an adult.                                                                                    62.


      WE SEE:  Julia, in her hospital room texting.  And smiling.

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    All your stupid insecurities and 
                      anxieties, they re still there.  
                    Only you feel even more stupid and 
                    insecure about being stupid and 
                    insecure because you re not 
                    supposed to be stupid and insecure 
                    anymore.  You re supposed to have 
                    the answers. You re supposed to 
                    know.

      WE SEE:  Vicky, sitting beside Leo.  

                                  VICKY
                    I was wrong about you.  And I m 
                    sorry.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    But we don t always know.  And 
                    those answers?  They re not always 
                    easy to come by...

      WE SEE:  Marian with her mother.  Mrs. Ellish looks at her.  

                                  MRS. ELLISH
                    You look so familiar.  Do we know 
                    each other?

      And we re back to Emily.  She enters the elevators...

      INT. HOSPITAL -- MAIN ENTRANCE

      Emily emerges from the elevators and walks purposefully 
      through the entry way.  She exits.

      EXT. HOSPITAL -- SUNSET

      Emily heads outside.  

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Well, you know what?  I m done 
                    feeling stupid and insecure about 
                    feeling stupid and insecure.  

      She crosses the street, heading towards her car.  A voice 
      from behind:

                                    FRIZZY-HAIRED GIRL (O.S.)
                    Hey.  You re a doctor?

      Emily turns.  It s the Frizzy-Haired Teenager from the 
      opening scene.                                                                                      63.


                                  EMILY
                    Yes, I am.

                                  FRIZZY HAIRED GIRL
                    Huh.  That s pretty cool...

        Vindication!  Emily grins, watching as the Frizzy-haired girl 
      heads off.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    The truth is, I think part of being 
                    an adult is that you stop waiting 
                    for yourself to change and you 
                    start to accept who you are.

      And then she sees them.  Standing by the fence, in front of 
      the school.  Will and Cassandra.  They are talking, laughing, 
      their heads close together.   Flirting.  They clearly have 
      chemistry.  A knife in Emily s heart.

                                  EMILY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Oh, who am I kidding.  It s got to 
                    get better than this.  Right?

      And we... SMASH TO BLACK.


                                      END OF SHOW
