  A summer MOON casts shafts of light through the forest. 
  Sounds of tranquility. Crickets. Frogs. A nearby stream. 
  Interrupted by...A PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS flittering through the 
  trees. 



  There is the pit-pat sound of liquid trickling. 

  CRANE to reveal A LEAK from the ruptured gas tank, drizzling 
  gasoline, some of it turning to white vapor as it passes over 
  the still hot motor and onto...

  ABBEY, illuminated by the headlights, on the ground below, 
  moaning, semi-conscious. 

  Cliff shoves his mangled door open and STUMBLES from the car. 

  The gas turns to FLAMES, Abbey s body going up like a torch--

  CLIFF, RECOILS from the heat of the flames; 

  Abbey kicks and SCREAMS, writhing in agony.

                              CLIFF
                Abbey!

  FADE TO BLACK. 

                                                                        CUT TO:

    Establishing. A well tended, modern HOUSE with a SMART CAR in 
  the driveway.  A TAXI pulls up. Cliff gets out, carrying an 
  overnight bag. 



  A violent barrage: the Luxury Sedan... the tree... the 
  airbag... Abbey on fire, writhing in pain!


  BACK TO - THE PRESENT

  BEEEEP! Cliff is jarred back to reality by the sound of a 
  SMOKE DETECTOR, buzzing from the kitchen. 

                              CLIFF 
                Shit.



  PAM, Abbey s mother, standing in the doorway. Her stern, 
  unforgiving eyes burn into Cliff. 

                              PAM
                Is it true? Are you really trying 
                to pull the plug on my daughter? 

                              CLIFF
                Pam... mom, I... 

                              PAM
                Don t call me mom. It makes me want 
                to throw up. 

  Cliff fumbles to keep the robe closed. 

                              CLIFF
                I have to respect Abbey s wishes. 

                              PAM
                Oh. Yes. Really. Abbey s wishes.

                Why don t you come in and we ll 
                talk about this? 

                              PAM
                Talk? You ll talk to my lawyer. 
                I ll see you ruined. You crash my 
                daughter into a tree and you think 
                you deserve to get rich off it? 

                              CLIFF
                What are you talking about? 

                              PAM

                Go to hell, Cliff. You aren t going 
                to get away with this. 

  With that she turns and walks away.  Cliff closes the door, 
  badly shaken and confused. 



  Cliff moves towards the driveway, letting the door close 
  behind him and then turns-the word  MURDERER  has been spray-
  painted across his front door.

                      (weakly)
                Cell phone. Call an ambulance. 

                              CLIFF
                O.K. 

  CLIFF starts to search the ground. He sees something laying 
  there.  He stares for a moment, as if making a decision. 

  Angle on: Abbey s cell phone, and... her ornate cigarette 
  lighter laying beside it. 

  Cliff picks up the lighter. 

                              ABBEY 
                Cliff? Did you find it? 

  Cliff CROUCHES by the edge of the gasoline pool. He tries to 
  be soothing, but there is a nervous edge to his voice. 

                              CLIFF
                Just stay calm, honey. Everything s 
                going to be all right. 

  Abbey cranes her neck to see Cliff. She tries to focus on him 
  as he FLICKS the lighter. It doesn t light. 

                              ABBEY
                      (slowly realizing)
                Cliff? What are you doing? 

  He FLICKS the lighter again. Nothing. 

                              CLIFF
                      (nervously)
                Just try to relax. They ll be here 
                in a minute. 

  He continues to FLICK as Abbey begins to SCREAM. 

                              ABBEY
                Cliff what are you doing? Stop 
                that... CLIFF!

  The ground erupts into FLAMES, enveloping Abbey s body. She 
  kicks and screams, writhing in agony. 

  Cliff RECOILS from the flames.

                              CLIFF
                ABBEY! ABBEY! I m sorry. 

  Cliff watches. Shaking with terror. The sounds of SIRENS grow 
  in the distance; help is on the way.

  CLOSE ON - HOME PREGNANCY TEST WAND --

  -- Melts in the flames.

  END FLASHBACK. 



  The front wheel hits a pothole, violently RATTLING the 
  vehicle.

  The black plastic trash bag slips from the restraints.



  BODY PARTS are scattered everywhere. Cliff begins to gather 
  them up, stuffing them back into the bag, when...

  FLASHING LIGHTS appear behind him. Cliff freezes. He s 
  caught, holding a slender, skinned arm in one hand and the 
  plastic bag in the other. 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  50A.

  OPPOSITE ANGLE

  The Trooper Car keeps going, obviously on a call. 

                              TROOPER (LOUDSPEAKER V.O.)
                Get out of the road, asshole!

  Its tail lights disappear, the setting dark and tranquil once 
  more.


  CLIFF

  Shoves in the rest of the body parts and starts to re-tie the 
  bag. He notices that he missed one-- there is a FOOT laying 
  on the ground. 

  No time. Cliff KICKS it off to the side of the road. 

                                                                        CUT TO:



  Cliff SCREECHES to a halt in the parking lot, grabs the 
  cooler and runs for the doors. 

  The protests are over and a lone, sad JANITOR is sweeping up 
  their tattered signs and discarded litter. Cliff RUNS past 
  into--



  Cliff pulls Abbey s car into the driveway. The cooler sits in 
  the passenger seat. 



  Cliff drops the contractor bag with Trish s body into a trash 
  bin, followed by the cooler. 

  He closes the lid on the trash bin and drags it out to the 
  curb for pickup. 

  In no hurry, he shuffles towards the front door, as he does 
  the door--


  OPENS

  Abbey s ghost, looking young and beautiful, stands in the 
  doorway. 

  ANGLE ON: CLIFF stares at her for awhile, lovely and radiant, 
  the instrument of his demise. 

                              ABBEY
                I m never going to let you go. 

                              CLIFF
                      (quietly)
                I know. 

  With weary resignation, Cliff wipes his feet and steps 
  inside. He pulls the door shut after him, locking us out. 

  Cliff and Abbey s WEDDING SONG begins as-- 

  CREDITS ROLL.   FADE IN:



  A summer MOON casts shafts of light through the forest. 
  Sounds of tranquility. Crickets. Frogs. A nearby stream. 
  Interrupted by...A PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS flittering through the 
  trees. 



  There is the pit-pat sound of liquid trickling. 

  CRANE to reveal A LEAK from the ruptured gas tank, drizzling 
  gasoline, some of it turning to white vapor as it passes over 
  the still hot motor and onto...

  ABBEY, illuminated by the headlights, on the ground below, 
  moaning, semi-conscious. 

  Cliff shoves his mangled door open and STUMBLES from the car. 

  The gas turns to FLAMES, Abbey s body going up like a torch--

  CLIFF, RECOILS from the heat of the flames; 

  Abbey kicks and SCREAMS, writhing in agony.

                              CLIFF
                Abbey!

  FADE TO BLACK. 

                                                                        CUT TO:

    Establishing. A well tended, modern HOUSE with a SMART CAR in 
  the driveway.  A TAXI pulls up. Cliff gets out, carrying an 
  overnight bag. 



  A violent barrage: the Luxury Sedan... the tree... the 
  airbag... Abbey on fire, writhing in pain!


  BACK TO - THE PRESENT

  BEEEEP! Cliff is jarred back to reality by the sound of a 
  SMOKE DETECTOR, buzzing from the kitchen. 

                              CLIFF 
                Shit.



  PAM, Abbey s mother, standing in the doorway. Her stern, 
  unforgiving eyes burn into Cliff. 

                              PAM
                Is it true? Are you really trying 
                to pull the plug on my daughter? 

                              CLIFF

                Don t call me mom. It makes me want 
                to throw up. 

  Cliff fumbles to keep the robe closed. 

                              CLIFF
                I have to respect Abbey s wishes.

                to get away with this. 

  With that she turns and walks away.  Cliff closes the door, 
  badly shaken and confused. 



  Cliff moves towards the driveway, letting the door close 
  behind him and then turns-the word  MURDERER  has been spray-
  painted across his front door.

                This is going to be my last 
                  cigarette. I want to enjoy it. 

                              CLIFF
                You re quitting? 

  She nods. 

                              CLIFF (cont d)
                That s good. 
                      (beat)
                Because I want you to be around for 
                a long time. 

                              ABBEY
                Why should I listen to anything you 
                say? 

                              CLIFF
                Because it s true. 
                      (choking up)
                I love you so Goddamned much, Abby. 
                I m sorry for everything but you 
                are my wife. We are going to grow 
                old together and I m never going to 
                let you go. 
                      (quieter)
                I m never going to let you go. 

                              ABBEY
                Really? 

                              CLIFF
                Yes. 

                              ABBEY
                I want to show you something. 

  Abbey unfastens her seat belt, reaching into the back seat. 

  CLOSE ON: Her hand, reaching into her purse... and removing 
  the HOME PREGNANCY TEST WAND, revealing it to Cliff. 

                              ABBEY (cont d)
                I m having your baby, Cliff.

  He tilts his head down. Speechless. The results, a light blue 
  cross, are positive. As it sinks in, Cliff is overcome with 
  joy.

                This is so unbelievably awesome! 
                That s why you re quitting. We are 
                going to have a family! 

                              ABBEY 
                I m afraid it s too late for that.

                when you fucked that whore. No more 
                of my family s money. No more 
                house. And Cliff? No more private 
                  practice. 

  Cliff can t believe what he s hearing. It s a nightmare. 

                              CLIFF
                Abbey. What? You don t really mean

  Cliff sees the branch TOO LATE. He SMASHES through it and 
  loses control. Cliff SCREAMS.

  Cliff STUMBLES out of the car, disoriented. Abbey lifts her 
  head, trying to focus. 

                              CLIFF
                Abbey. Are you...? 

                              ABBEY
                      (weakly)
                Cell phone. Call an ambulance. 

                              CLIFF
                O.K. 

  CLIFF starts to search the ground. He sees something laying 
  there.  He stares for a moment, as if making a decision. 

  Angle on: Abbey s cell phone, and... her ornate cigarette 
  lighter laying beside it. 

  Cliff picks up the lighter. 

                              ABBEY 
                Cliff? Did you find it? 

  Cliff CROUCHES by the edge of the gasoline pool. He tries to 
  be soothing, but there is a nervous edge to his voice. 

                              CLIFF
                Just stay calm, honey. Everything s 
                going to be all right. 

  Abbey cranes her neck to see Cliff. She tries to focus on him 
  as he FLICKS the lighter. It doesn t light. 

                              ABBEY
                      (slowly realizing)
                Cliff? What are you doing? 

  He FLICKS the lighter again. Nothing.

                      (nervously)
                Just try to relax. They ll be here 
                in a minute. 

  He continues to FLICK as Abbey begins to SCREAM. 

                              ABBEY

  The ground erupts into FLAMES, enveloping Abbey s body. She 
  kicks and screams, writhing in agony. 

  Cliff RECOILS from the flames.

                              CLIFF
                ABBEY! ABBEY! I m sorry. 

  Cliff watches. Shaking with terror. The sounds of SIRENS grow 
  in the distance; help is on the way.

  CLOSE ON - HOME PREGNANCY TEST WAND --

  -- Melts in the flames.

  END FLASHBACK. 



  The front wheel hits a pothole, violently RATTLING the 
  vehicle.

  The black plastic trash bag slips from the restraints.



  BODY PARTS are scattered everywhere. Cliff begins to gather 
  them up, stuffing them back into the bag, when...

  FLASHING LIGHTS appear behind him. Cliff freezes. He s 
  caught, holding a slender, skinned arm in one hand and the 
  plastic bag in the other. 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                          "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  50A.

  A STATE TROOPER CAR approaches, siren blaring. It gets within

  OPPOSITE ANGLE

  The Trooper Car keeps going, obviously on a call. 

                              TROOPER (LOUDSPEAKER V.O.)
                Get out of the road, asshole!

  Its tail lights disappear, the setting dark and tranquil once 
  more.


  CLIFF

  Shoves in the rest of the body parts and starts to re-tie the 
  bag. He notices that he missed one-- there is a FOOT laying 
  on the ground. 

  No time. Cliff KICKS it off to the side of the road. 

                                                                        CUT TO:



  Cliff SCREECHES to a halt in the parking lot, grabs the 
  cooler and runs for the doors. 

  The protests are over and a lone, sad JANITOR is sweeping up 
  their tattered signs and discarded litter. Cliff RUNS past 
  into--



  Cliff pulls Abbey s car into the driveway. The cooler sits in 
  the passenger seat. 



  Cliff drops the contractor bag with Trish s body into a trash 
  bin, followed by the cooler. 

  He closes the lid on the trash bin and drags it out to the 
  curb for pickup. 

  In no hurry, he shuffles towards the front door, as he does 
  the door--


  OPENS

  Abbey s ghost, looking young and beautiful, stands in the 
  doorway. 

  ANGLE ON: CLIFF stares at her for awhile, lovely and radiant, 
  the instrument of his demise. 

                              ABBEY
                I m never going to let you go. 

                              CLIFF
                      (quietly)
                I know. 

  With weary resignation, Cliff wipes his feet and steps 
  inside. He pulls the door shut after him, locking us out. 

  Cliff and Abbey s WEDDING SONG begins as-- 

  CREDITS ROLL.                             "Right to Die," Yellow  10/20/2006,  2.

                Because I want you to be around for 
                a long time. 

  Abbey rolls her eyes. 

  ANGLE ON: The tires, spinning on the blacktop. 

  WIDE ON: the road, the car s headlights moving horizontally 
  across the darkened landscape. 

  BACK TO CLIFF AND ABBEY. He s beginning to choke up. 

                              CLIFF (cont'd)
                I love you so Goddamned much, Abby. 
                I m sorry for everything. But you 
                are my wife. We are going to grow 
                old together and I m never going to 
                let you go. 

  P.O.V. - THE ONCOMING ROAD - it s empty and quiet. 

  BACK TO CLIFF AND ABBEY-- she appears to have softened. Maybe 
  Cliff is wearing her down?

  Abbey unfastens her seat belt, reaching into the back seat.

  The car sweeps by dark woods then-

  P.O.V - THE ONCOMING ROAD - A FALLEN TREE blocking the road.

  Cliff turns, seeing it at the last moment. He JERKS the 
  wheel, simultaneously hitting the brakes. A forest of fallen 
  branches SLAP the windshield. Cliff loses control. 

  ON CLIFF, AS HE SCREAMS HIS AIR BAG EXPLODES--

  ON WHITE. THERE IS A SONIC BOOM! Gnashing metal. Then 
  silence. 

  DISSOLVE onto STEAM. Through the fog, the CAMERA finds Cliff. 
  There is a gash on his head, a lot of blood and blood on the 
  airbag in front of him. He turns to the passenger seat, but 
  it s empty. There s a large hole in the windshield.  Cliff 
  begins to fumble for his seatbelt as...

  CAMERA ROTATES 180 degrees to reveal that Cliff is UPSIDE 
  DOWN, the car having flipped into a gully.



  There is the pit-pat sound of liquid trickling. 

  CRANE to reveal A LEAK from the ruptured gas tank, drizzling 
  gasoline, some of it turning to white vapor as it passes over 
  the still hot motor and onto...

  ABBEY, illuminated by the headlights, on the ground below, 
  moaning, semi-conscious. 

  Cliff shoves his mangled door open and STUMBLES from the car. 

  The gas turns to FLAMES, Abbey s body going up like a torch--

  CLIFF, RECOILS from the heat of the flames; 

  Abbey kicks and SCREAMS, writhing in agony.

                              CLIFF

    Establishing. A well tended, modern HOUSE with a SMART CAR in 
  the driveway.  A TAXI pulls up. Cliff gets out, carrying an 
  overnight bag. 



  A violent barrage: the Luxury Sedan... the tree... the 
  airbag... Abbey on fire, writhing in pain!


  BACK TO - THE PRESENT

  BEEEEP! Cliff is jarred back to reality by the sound of a 
  SMOKE DETECTOR, buzzing from the kitchen. 

                              CLIFF 
                Shit.



  PAM, Abbey s mother, standing in the doorway. Her stern, 
  unforgiving eyes burn into Cliff. 

                              PAM
                Is it true? Are you really trying 
                to pull the plug on my daughter?

                Don t call me mom. It makes me want 
                to throw up. 

  Cliff fumbles to keep the robe closed. 

                              CLIFF
                I have to respect Abbey s wishes.

  With that she turns and walks away.  Cliff closes the door, 
  badly shaken and confused. 



  Cliff moves towards the driveway, letting the door close 
  behind him and then turns-the word  MURDERER  has been spray-

                big.

                              CLIFF
                Why? Why is she doing this? I was 
                always nice to her. 

                              IRA
                The airbag. 

                              CLIFF
                What? 

                              IRA
                Your airbag opened. And here you 
                sit, a little retarded, but 
                  otherwise not much worse for wear. 
                If Abbey s airbag opens she 
                probably walks away, same as you. 

                              CLIFF
                Her seatbelt was off.

                              IRA
                Doesn t matter. There was a 
                  malfunction and Loris is going to 
                pay a large settlement to keep it 
                out of a courtroom. 

                              CLIFF
                How large? 

                              IRA
                There was a similar settlement in 
                Denver. Ten million dollars. 

                              CLIFF
                Holy cow. 

                              IRA
                If your mother in law can have you 
                removed as Abbey s legal guardian, 
                she becomes custodian to that 
                money.
                      (then)
                And when Abbey dies? Whoever wins 
                gets to keep it all.

                So. I ve got a PR firm to get you 
                some favorable press, the Senator s 
                opponent has promised his support 
                in exchange for some campaign

                What if I just offer to give Pam 
                the money? Would she leave us 
                alone? 

                              IRA
                It s too late for her to back out. 
                Besides, you re going to need that 
                money to pay your legal bills.

                was definitely doing the right 
                thing? 

  Ira looks at him head on and lies. 

                              IRA
                Of course not, Cliff. Jesus, what 
                do you think I am? 

  Ira s  sincerity  is persuasive. Cliff feels guilty for 
  asking.

  Ira, on his cell phone, standing outside his car. He s in a

  Cliff gets out of his car. He heads towards the front door: 
  the word  Murderer  has been crossed out and replaced with 
   PUSSY.  



  Cliff drives Abbey s car quickly out into the night. A LARGE

  No time. Cliff KICKS it off to the side of the road.

  Cliff pulls Abbey s car into the driveway. The cooler sits in

  Cliff drops the contractor bag with Trish s body into a trash

  He closes the lid on the trash bin and drags it out to the 
  curb for pickup. 

  In no hurry, he shuffles towards the front door, as he does 
  the door--


  OPENS

  Abbey s ghost, looking young and beautiful, stands in the 
  doorway. 

  ANGLE ON: CLIFF stares at her for awhile, lovely and radiant, 
  the instrument of his demise. 

                              ABBEY
                I m never going to let you go. 

                              CLIFF
                      (quietly)
                I know. 

  With weary resignation, Cliff wipes his feet and steps 
  inside. He pulls the door shut after him, locking us out. 

  Cliff and Abbey s WEDDING SONG begins as-- 

  CREDITS ROLL.
