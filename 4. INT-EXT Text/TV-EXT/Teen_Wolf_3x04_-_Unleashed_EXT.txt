      The door to Kyle s car clicks open. He unleashes Bullet and 
      waits for him to jump into the back seat.

                                  KYLE
                    Let s go, buddy.

      But the dog won t move. Even when Kyle gives him a nudge.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    Okay, this part usually happens 
                    before we get to the vet.

      Bullet responds with a soft WHINE. Finally, Kyle picks him up 
      and puts him on the seat. But the moment he reaches to close 
      the door, the dog darts out, racing into the lot.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    Hey!


      A shadow falls across the alley just beyond the Clinic s 
      parking lot. Kyle tentatively approaches, looking about.

                                  KYLE
                    Bullet?

      A SCRAPE turns his head to a DUMPSTER sitting against the 
      wall. Kyle slowly kneels to take a look underneath. Among the 
      shadows, he spots the slightest movement.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    There you are. Come on, little guy.

      He taps the pavement, trying to coax the dog out.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    Come on, Bullet.

      With a breath, he finally reaches underneath the dumpster, 
      groping about. Trying to grab hold of the dog when--Kyle 
      snaps his hand back with a CRY OF PAIN.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    Son of a bitch. Did you just bite 
                    me?

      He looks at his trembling hand, blood on the palm. When he 
      glances up, however, he discovers an unsettling sight...

      Bullet. Crouched in the far corner of the alley.

      Slowly, Kyle turns his gaze back to the dumpster and whatever 
      it is underneath that just bit him.

      Something moves underneath. A PRESENCE whose shape appears 
      much larger now. It breathes with deep, labored EXHALATIONS.

      Bullet begins to WHINE while the VOICE whispers out from 
      beneath the dumpster, almost inaudible.

                                  VOICE
                    Closer...

      Shivering in the corner, Bullet s cries grow louder. But Kyle 
      doesn t look back. Doesn t even blink.    TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/134.

                    Come... closer...

      He leans in, seeming almost hypnotized by the pleading voice.

                                  VOICE (CONT D)
                    Closer... please...

      Bullet s WHINES escalate to SHARP GROWLS, lips pulling back 
      to bare his teeth. Kyle s eyes remain fixed on the thing 
      underneath the dumpster as he obediently moves--

                                  VOICE (CONT D)
                    CLOSER.


      Darting into the alley, Scott barely has a moment to react 
      when Bullet charges toward him. He kneels down and the 
      terrified dog jumps into his protective arms.

      Lifting Bullet, Scott peers about the empty alley. The 
      dumpster pushed slightly out of place. But nothing else. No 
      sign of Kyle. 

      Nothing at all...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF


      THE HARD TERRAIN-TREADED TIRES of Scott s motocross bike spin 
      to a stop at the racks in the school lot. Yanking off his 
      helmet, he turns when--

      Aiden ROARS in on his motorcycle, pulling up right next to 
      him. Not a second later, Ethan parks on Scott s other side.

      Eyeing their impressive bikes, Scott offers a friendly nod. 
      But it s not returned by either twin. Helmets in hand, Ethan 
      and Aiden head for the school entrance.


      THE CROSS COUNTRY TEAM--both boys and girls--gather beyond 
      the fence. Ahead, trails lead into the outlying woods.

      At the STARTING LINE, Isaac kneels to tighten his shoelaces. 
      But then pauses, holding still. Gripping the laces, his hands 
      curl into FISTS as he slowly turns to find--

      Aiden getting into position on his right. Ethan steps in at 
      his left. Both looking on Isaac like an old rival.

      Coach blows the WHISTLE and the twins race forward, moving 
      far faster than any other runner.

                                  COACH
                    Pace yourselves!

      Stunned, Isaac kneels there, motionless. But shock falls away 
      to fury and he rises, bolting forward when--Scott GRABS HIM, 
      yanking him back. Isaac looks at him with eyes GLOWING 
      YELLOW.    TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/139.

                    It s them.

      He shrugs free of Scott s grasp.

                                  SCOTT
                    Isaac, wait--Isaac!

      But he s off, vanishing into the woods ahead. With a 
      frustrated breath, Scott charges after him.


      Trampling leaves underfoot, Isaac hurtles well beyond his 
      teammates. He spots Aiden up the trail. Then Ethan surges in 
      from the side. Both of them just ahead, just out of reach.

      Isaac races faster, pushing himself to catch up. When the 
      path veers into a fork, however, he slows. Then, finally, he 
      stops. Breathing hard, he glances around and--

      SHOVES FORWARD, hit from behind. Ethan speeds past on his 
      left. Aiden appears, darting off in the opposite direction.

                                  ETHAN (V.O.)
                    Isaac.

      THE VOICE echoes out from the trees, spinning him around.

                                  AIDEN (V.O.)
                          (taunting)
                    Isaac.

      Catching a glimpse of one twin, Isaac starts forward.

                                  AIDEN (V.O.)
                    Still thinking about the girl?

      Isaac whirls again, searching for the voice. But the twins 
      move too fast, disappearing from his peripheral vision.

                                  ETHAN (V.O.)
                    You didn t even know her name, did 
                    you?

                                  AIDEN (V.O.)
                    Doesn t matter now--

                                  ETHAN (V.O.)

      CONTINUED:1212

      Spinning toward the voice, Isaac launches off a tree trunk, 
      hurtling up. But Aiden grabs him, DRAGGING him to the ground. 
      Ethan yanks him to his feet, easily overpowering him.

                                  ETHAN
                    Aiden, I always forget. How many 
                    bones in the human body?

      Aiden grabs Isaac s arm.

                                  AIDEN
                    I don t know. Let s count.

      Aiden s grip tightens around Isaac s forearm as--SCOTT 
      SMASHES HIS FIST right across the twin s jaw, sending him 
      tumbling to the ground.

                                  SCOTT
                    That s one.

      Isaac wrests free of Ethan while Aiden gets back to his feet. 
      He resets his broken jaw with a painful sounding CRUNCH.

      Isaac retreats back to Scott and the four boys circle each 
      other. CLAWS unsheathe, FANGS snap. A serious werewolf brawl 
      about to go down when--

      SOMEONE SCREAMS.

      They turn their heads at the shrill, terrified sound. Two 
      RUNNERS hurry past, barely noticing them. Hearing others 
      rushing to the scene, Scott moves to follow, pulling Isaac 
      with him.

      They emerge into a CLEARING where the rest of the team has 
      gathered. Among them, Stiles pushes forward to look while 
      Scott steps in beside him.

                                  STILES
                    It s him, isn t it?

      Scott doesn t have to see the face to know it s Kyle. Because 
      this time the garrote used to crush the young man s larynx is 
      not made from wire...

      It s Bullet s leash.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:


      Tearing through the woods, hands pushing aside errant 
      branches, Graeme and other Deputies try to keep up with 
      Stilinski who leads the charge. They breach the clearing 
      where a cluster of teenagers surround the body.

                                  DEPUTY GRAEME
                    All right, back up. Everyone back!

                    they trample every bit of evidence. 
                    And that includes my son.

      Stiles points to BLOOD at the back of Kyle s head.

                                  STILES
                    Dad, look--look at this. It s just 
                    like the others.

                                  STILINSKI
                    I know. Now please go back to 
                    school. Coach, give us a hand?

                                  COACH
                    You heard them. Nothing to see 
                    here. He was probably just some 
                    homeless kid.

                                  SCOTT
                    Coach, he was a senior.

                                  COACH
                    He wasn t on the team, was he?

      A PANICKED VOICE CRIES OUT from behind them. Heads turn to a 
      girl named ASHLEY frantically pushing her way through.

                                  ASHLEY
                    No, no, God no--Kyle.

      Deputy Graeme grabs her before she can get to the body. She 
      struggles, but then finally relents, falling into Graeme s 
      arms in grief-stricken defeat.

      Isaac s gaze remains fixed on Ethan and Aiden who look over 
      Kyle s body with curiosity.   TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1312.

      Scott gently pulls Isaac away, motioning for Stiles to 
      follow. They head back, talking quickly.

                      werewolfitude in these murders?

                    You think it s coincidence? People 
                    start dying right when they show 
                    up?
