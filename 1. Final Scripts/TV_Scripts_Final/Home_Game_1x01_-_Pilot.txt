      WITH FABRIC SAMPLES, BLUEPRINTS, AND A NUMBER OF THREE-RING

                    (INTO PHONE) You're not remodeling my 

                    guest room, Leo.  You re two months 

                    behind on an elementary school 

                    library.  So do you hate children, or 

                    reading, or both?

      MARK (ALSO 30 S, HANDSOME, A LARGE AND ATHLETIC MAN) STANDS 
      COMPLETELY NUDE, FRESH OUT OF THE SHOWER, IN FRONT OF A

                    of your lawn.  And our street isn t 

                    zoned for peep shows.

                                  MARK

                    Probably best.  They should always be 

                    out by the airport, where they re more

      A GIANT MESS.  LISA ENTERS.

                    Lisa, I can t help but notice the huge 

                    amount of work you do to run this 

                    house, especially on a school day.

                    Well, thank you, honey.

      SMALLS AND MARK CONTINUES TO MOVE KIDS TOWARD THE BASEMENT, 
      AS RONNIE HART (20 S, HIPSTER) AND HIS BAND ARRIVE.  THEY ARE 
      CLEARLY OLDER AND COOLER THAN ANY OF THE TEENAGERS.

                                  RONNIE

                    Hey, you Tess s Dad?  Ronnie Hart.

                    Ronnie!

      TESS EMERGES FROM THE BASEMENT AND GIVES RONNIE A HUG.

      RONNIE AND HIS BAND HEAD DOWNSTAIRS.  TESS TURNS TO SMALLS.

                    Let there be light!

      SFX: A BLINDING FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT.

      WE SEE MARK AND CHARLOTTE STANDING UNDER A BASKETBALL HOOP IN 
      THE DRIVEWAY BEHIND MARK S HOUSE, BLINKING IN THE FLOOD OF 
      LIGHT.  CHARLOTTE HAS A BASKETBALL.  

      SMALLS JUMPS DOWN FROM A MAMMOTH PICKUP TRUCK WITH CAMOUFLAGE 
      PAINT AND MASSIVE, HIGH-INTENSITY LIGHT BARS ACROSS THE 
      WINDSHIELD, ACROSS THE GRILL, ALONG THE ROOF, ETC.

      SMALLS HITS A BUTTON ON HIS KEYCHAIN REMOTE AND SAFARI TRUCK 
      PULSES WITH LIGHT AND EMITS A SERIES OF TONES LIKE THE 
      SPACESHIP IN  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS.

                    She says you re welcome.

      JUST THEN, FIVE THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLD BOYS ENTER FROM THE STREET.

      MARK SITS ON THE SOFA, SORTING THROUGH THE VARIOUS ITEMS

      CROSSES TO THE DOOR.

                    you not to dance.

      MARK OPENS THE DOOR.  TWO DENVER POLICE OFFICERS ARE THERE.

      TWO TEENAGERS ENTER THE LIVING ROOM FROM THE BASEMENT.  THEY 
      SPOT THE COPS AND FREEZE.

      THE KIDS CONTINUE TO PANIC, KNOCKING OVER LAMPS AND 
      FURNITURE.  THE COPS, MARK AND SMALLS HAVE TO STEP OUT OF

      LISA PUTS A COMFORTING HAND ON HIS SHOULDER.

                                  LISA

                    (SWEETLY) You have a choice.  You can 

                    either find some reason to get out of 

                    the house every day -- soon -- or 

                    we re going to get a divorce.

                                  MARK

                    I cut the grass every day.

                    If I can see you, you re too close. 

                    (THEN) But that doesn t mean you re 

                    not valuable around here.  You re a 

                    great dad, but...  You re gripping the 

                    wheel a little tight.

                                  MARK

                    You know what it is?  As a lineman, I 

                    could do my job all game, and no one 

                    would notice.  But if I made one 

                    mistake, my quarterback got hammered 

                    and it s game over.  I feel like it s 

                    the same thing with these girls.  I 

                    make one tiny mistake, and boom, one 

                    of them s a stripper.

                    You need to trust them.  They re a lot 

                    more grown-up than you realize.

                                  MARK

                    Exactly!  Now they re in the danger 

                    zone. (THEN) That s why I need to make 

                    up for lost time and be extra-involved 

                    with their lives.

                                  LISA

                    Okay, that s the exact opposite of 

                    what I was trying to say.

      THERE IS A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.  MARK ANSWERS.  IT S SMALLS 
      WITH HIS ARMS AROUND TWO ATTRACTIVE LADY COPS.

                                  SMALLS

                    You guys got a camera?
