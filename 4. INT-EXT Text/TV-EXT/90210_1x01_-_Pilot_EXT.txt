  TIGHT on a KANSAS license plate.  WIDEN TO REVEAL an older 
  minivan that s been driven hard for last two days passing the 
  iconic BEVERLY HILLS SIGN.



  The Mills family climbs out of the minivan.  They stretch and 
  begin gathering on the lawn.

                                  DIXON
                          (to Annie)
                    Did I tell you I saw one of 
                    Grandma s old movies last week on 
                    Showtime?  Full frontal. Yikes.

  ANGLE ON Harry and Celia.

                                  HARRY
                    Can I just say that you re handling 
                    this move awfully well for someone 
                    who s never left the state of 
                    Kansas.

                                  CELIA
                    I think it s going to be fun.  Come 
                    on, I m 40, if I don t try 
                    something new, when will I?  I was 
                    going to start working again, why 
                    not in LA?

                                  HARRY
                    You re not just saying that to make 
                    me feel better?     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           3.


                                  CELIA
                    Not at all.  I get to move in with 
                    my bitter, bossy alcoholic mother-
                    in-law who still thinks she s a sex 
                    siren of the 1970 s, what could be 
                    better than that?

                                  HARRY
                    There s my girl.

  The front door opens and TABITHA MILLS emerges with her tumbler 
  and cigarette in hand.  ANNIE lights up at seeing her.

                                  ANNIE
                    Grandma!

                                    TABITHA
                    Annie!  Dixon.

  Annie rushes up to Tabitha and embraces her.  Dixon gives her  a 
  hug, they head inside. Harry approaches, frowns at the tumbler 
  of copper liquid in her hand.

                                  HARRY
                    What you got there, Mom?

  Harry takes the glass from Tabitha s hand, gives it a sniff. 
  Tabitha rolls her eyes.

                                    TABITHA
                    You got me. I m drinking iced tea 
                    before noon.  Somebody get Betty 
                    Ford on the line.

                                  HARRY
                    Sorry, I m just trying to help.

                                    TABITHA
                    You want to help?  Go yell at the 
                    gardener for parking his crappy van 
                    in front of my house again.

                                  CELIA
                    That s our van, Tabitha.

                                    TABITHA
                    Well then park it around the corner 
                    so the neighbors won t notice.



  HARRY is driving Annie and Dixon to school on their first day.      "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           4.


                                  HARRY
                    Look, I know this isn t easy.  
                    You re not just the new kids, 
                    you re the new principal s kids. 

                                  ANNIE
                    A two-fer.  Yay for us!

                                  HARRY
                    And I m sorry you re coming into 
                    school a week after its already 
                    started. That can be hard too but-- 

                                  DIXON
                    Yeah, yeah.  Okay, Stop the car. 
                    Stop the car.

                                  HARRY
                    What?

                                  ANNIE
                    You just said it.  We re the 
                      principal s kids.  We can t drive 
                    into school with the principal!

                                  DIXON
                    We ll walk from here.

                                  HARRY
                    The lot is half a mile away, let me 
                    at least get a little clo--

                                  ANNIE
                    Stop it.

                                  DIXON
                    Pull over.

                                  ANNIE
                    Now.  Dad.  Please.  We know what 
                    we re doing



  Annie and DIXON walk and stare in amazement at not only the 
  multitude of ESCALADES, PORSCHES, etc., but the entire place 
  looks like Fashion Week in NYC.

                                  DIXON
                    Oh my god. Have you ever seen so 
                    many hot girls in your life?      "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           5.


                                  ANNIE
                    This is how they dress for school?  
                    It looks like the Oscars and 
                    everyone is Gywneth Paltrow.

                                  DIXON
                    I d do her.  I d do her.  I d do 
                    her.  Annie.  We are definitely not 
                    in Kansas anymore.

                                  ANNIE
                    I m 110 pounds and I m going to be 
                    the fat girl.

                                  DIXON
                    At least you re not going to be the 
                     black guy.   

                                  ANNIE
                    Don t throw the race card at me.  
                    Last year our school play was  A 
                    Raisin in the Sun.   I played a 
                    tree.

                                  DIXON
                    On the other hand that makes me 
                    forbidden fruit.

                                  ANNIE
                    I so should have gone to Banana 
                    Republic!

                                  DIXON
                    I ll find ya at lunch.

                                  ANNIE
                    Yeah, great.  I ll be the girl in 
                    the potato sack practicing my lines 
                    for  Hairspray. 

  Dixon heads across the lot while Annie continues on.  Annie 
  looks at the text she just received. It s from Jason.   Luv u.  
  Miss u. J   She starts to answer when she hears a pulsating beat 
  coming from an Escalade.  

  Annie looks over and makes eye contact with the hot guy in the 
  driver s seat, ETHAN WARD (16, The kid tapped by the magic wand. 
  Handsome, charming, etcetera,).  Ethan gives her a flirty smile 
  and Annie smiles back bashfully until a HEAD POPS UP into view 
  from ETHAN S LAP.  

  It is ADRIANNA, (16, hot without a hair out of place) but before 
  she can see who Ethan is looking at, Annie ducks behind a car 
  out of embarrassment.       "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           6.


  Ethan taps Adrianna s head and she disappears again to go back 
  to her business below the window line.  Annie peaks to look 
  again and Ethan gives her a smile and a wave.



  Dixon is standing in his newly-issued WBHHS gym attire in a long 
  line of boys.  Navid is standing beside him.  Some P.E. teachers 
  are handing out crappy lacrosse equipment to the assembled 
  masses.  Across the way, the varsity lacrosse team, lead by 
  their coach, Ryan Matthews, and Ethan Ward.

                                  NAVID
                    Oh man, this sucks.  I got killed 
                    last year.

                                  DIXON
                    What?

                                  NAVID
                    Lacrosse tryouts.  Mr. Matthews 
                    uses his off period to try and find 
                    practice players AKA raw meat to be 
                    pounded by the thugs.  It s like a 
                    Nazi experiment.  And I can say 
                    that because I m a Jew.

                                  DIXON
                    Who s the best player?

                                  NAVID
                    Ethan Ward.  The one with the 
                    spotlight shinning out of his ass.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           19.



  Practice is underway and as promised, Ethan and the team take no 
    prisoners.  They run over the smaller opponents left and right 
  and play with speed and intimidation.  Ethan runs over Navid and 
  then scores a goal.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Good job, E.  Alright, nothing 
                    there, next ten.

  Dixon and others trot out to the field.  Ethan starts with the 
  ball and does a fancy pass to another player, GEORGE EVANS, but 
  it is intercepted by Dixon.  He takes off running towards the 
  goal.  There is a moment of stunned silence as this has NEVER 
  happened before in gym.  After a beat, the varsity team gives 
  chase but Dixon is too good and weaves in and out of the players 
  and fires a shot for a score.

                                  NAVID
                      SPARTA!!!!

  Navid leads the other hapless gym nerds in the chant  Ow eww.  
  Ow eww.  Ow eww  from the movie  300.  George is not happy.  
  Ethan is intrigued.  Ryan is impressed.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Looks like the principal s kid s 
                    got some game.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           20.


                                  DIXON
                    I started as an Attacker on my club 
                    team back in Wichita.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Well, put on a black shirt and 
                    let s see how you do in the big 
                    show.  Evans, play on the gym team 
                    and guard him tight.

  George Evans stews.

  A MONTAGE:  Dixon is playing great, in fact, he and Ethan have 
  an amazing chemistry.  Great passes, great moves, reading each 
  other s minds, trading high fives, it s like they ve played 
  together for years.  And George Evans getting frustrated because 
  he can t guard Dixon.  After another goal, Dixon reaches down to 
  tie his shoe.

                                  ETHAN
                    Dude, I think you ve made the team.

                                  DIXON
                    Man.  Nice moves.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Yo, you guys can makeout later, 
                    wind sprints at the other end.

  Ethan takes off running, but turns around to see where Dixon is, 
  and as he looks back everyone else is watching the other way. 

  George slashes Dixon HARD across the back of the legs.  Dixon 
  acting on instinct immediately slashes back.  Of course that is 
  the only thing the coaches see.  Dixon and George jump on each 
  on other and start fighting.  The coaches run in to separate 
  them.

  Dixon and Annie shoulder their bags, head toward the school. As 
  they pass by a CLASSIC OPEN-AIR BRONCO, one of the skaters 
  hanging out in the back shouts out to them.

                                  SKATER
                    Jethro! Ellie Mae! Mind if we come 
                    over later and skate in your ce-
                    ment pond?

  The assembled skaters -- Silver s fan base -- all get a laugh 
  out of that. Dixon pauses like he may have something to say 
  about this, but Annie pulls him along and away from trouble.

                                  DIXON
                    What was that about?

                                  ANNIE
                    I have no idea.  I just know that a 
                    second fight would probably not be 
                    the smartest thing to do.

  As they walk, people are pointing and laughing at them.  They 
  are met by Navid.

                                  NAVID
                    Morning Leonidis.  It s all over

                    You don t know?

  Dixon and Annie exchange a worried look.



  Ethan, George and a few cronies are walking to their cars.  
  Ethan is feeling really guilty.

                                  GEORGE
                    You should have seen the look on 
                    his face.   He s lying, Dad. 

  The others laugh.

                                  ETHAN
                    Just shut up.

                                  GEORGE
                    Oh don t be such a puss.  Who cares 
                    about that Obama.

                                  ETHAN
                    You know, you can be a real dick.

                                  GEORGE
                    What s your problem?

                                  ETHAN
                    The next time somebody kicks your 
                    ass, fix it yourself.

  Ethan gets into his SUV and drives off.



  The hotel looking, gorgeous at night.



  MUSIC - Hip modern remix of Nino Rota 60 s pop.

  Dixon and Navid are shooting video.  There s a damn HELICOPTER 
  suspended from unseen wires, and hanging from the helicopter is 
  a giant  La Dolce Vita  movie poster.  But this one has Naomi 
  assuming the pose of Anita Ekberg.

  We HEAR A ROAR OF ENGINES and kids squealing.

  We find hundreds of well-dressed, excited kids gathered for the 
  grand entrance. Five classic Vespas motor up the sidewalk in 
  front of the cheering guests. Naomi arrives last wearing the 
  ANITA EKBERG dress.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           54.


  FAKE PAPARAZZI in classic Italian suits begin snapping photos of 
  the girls as they climb off the Vespas and stroll up the red 
  carpet to the Crystal Ballroom waving to the guests.

  Reveal that Dixon, Annie, Silver and Navid are all standing 
  together.  Dixon and Annie s jaws are on the floor.

                                  NAVID
                    Just like back home?

                                  DIXON
                    Back home we cruise from the Dairy 
                    Queen to the Wal-Mart parking lot. 
                    So, yeah, pretty much the same.

  Annie gets a text message from Harry.

                                  ANNIE
                    Uh oh.  Dad knows.

  Dixon s cell vibrates too.

                                  DIXON
                    I just got one too.  It says  Come 
                    home now.   But at this point, how 
                    much more trouble can you get into?

                                  ANNIE
                    You know what?  I ve been the good 
                    girl my entire life and I still got 
                    grounded.  And I may never get out 
                    again, so the hell with it.  I m 
                    staying.

  The foursome all holler their approval.

                                  ANNIE (CONT D)
                    But I ll text Mom I m okay and that 
                    I ll be home around midnight.

                                  DIXON
                    And I ll text her that you re with 
                    me the whole time so you re safe.  
                    Meet me back here at 11:30.

  The girls head off.  Dixon spots his girl, the Dark-Haired 
  Beauty. He grabs Navid s shoulder, excitedly.

                    I swear that s her name. Rumor is 
                    she once...  talked  her way onto 
                    the Buckcherry tour bus--

                                  DIXON
                    This place.  There s like maybe 
                    four chicks like that in the entire 
                    midwest.  Maybe.



  Harry is on his cell to Celia as he exits.

                                  HARRY
                    She doesn t have me tied around her 
                    finger.  I just figured it s been a 
                    tough week, I forced the move on 
                    her, maybe I should cut her some 
                    slack.

  He looks up and sees Tracy Bennett smoking on the steps and 
  heading towards him.

                                  HARRY
                    I ll be home soon.  Love ya.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           59.


                                  TRACY BENNETT
                    We need to talk.



  Harry and Tracy are having it out in the parking lot.

                                  TRACY BENNETT
                    Yes, I am still angry.  And maybe 
                    if you had at least talked to me 
                    back then, taken more 
                      responsibility than just giving me 
                    200 dollars and running back to 
                    college it wouldn t bother me so 
                    much.  Would it have killed you to 
                    call me?  Write a letter?

                                  HARRY
                    I didn t know how to handle it, 
                    okay?  We were broken up.  I m 
                    sorry, I freaked, but it was more 
                    than twenty years ago. And besides, 
                    I did ask about you afterwards.

                    You went off to Europe for the 
                    year.

                                  TRACY BENNETT
                    I didn t go to Europe, Harry.  And 
                    I didn t go to the clinic.  I went 
                    away to have the baby.  So he could 
                    be adopted.  We have a son 
                    together.

  Harry is in shock...



  Annie and Silver are walking to the car.

                                  ANNIE
                    Every time I think I have seen or 
                    heard it all out here, something 
                    tops it.

                                  ANNIE
                    Do you want to come over to my 
                    house or go to yours?

                                  SILVER
                    Yours.  We got company, it s too 
                    crowded.

                                  ANNIE
                    Okay, let s-- is that Naomi?

  Annie stops when she notices Naomi sitting by a palm tree crying 
  her eyes out.

                                  SILVER
                    Oh god I hope so.  I love seeing 
                    her miserable.

                                  ANNIE
                    It s her birthday, Silver.

  Annie heads over.

                                  SILVER
                    I know.  That s what makes it fun 
                    for me.

  Annie stands next to Naomi.

                                  ANNIE
                    Can we give you a ride somewhere?



    Underneath the Santa Monica pier. There are bonfires, surfboards 
  standing in the sand, a full moon illuminating the water, scores 
  of young people drinking and laughing, the coolest beach party 
  ever... And Ethan is teaching Dixon how to surf. They are 
  stripped down to their underwear and having a blast.

                                  DIXON
                    I m standing up.  I m standing. 
                    Whoa.

  He s knocked over by a wave.  They drag their tired bodies onto 
  the beach where Navid hands them Styrofoam containers.

                                  ETHAN
                    You got pummeled, dude.  Is that 
                    beer?

                                  NAVID
                    7up.  I m president of Students 
                    Against Drunk Driving.

                                  ETHAN
                    Who are you?

  As the guys chug their drinks, off in the near distance we see 
  three women holding their shoes and walking in formal dresses to 
  the beach party.  It s Annie, Silver and Naomi.

                                  ANNIE
                    Uh oh.  Don t look, but Ethan is 
                    here.

                                  NAOMI
                    I figured.  That s why I told you 
                    to come here.  Thanks for the ride, 
                    Annie.  Thanks for being so nice.

  Naomi jogs up ahead to Ethan who looks at her for a beat, holds 
  out his hand and they go walking silently towards the pier until 
  they disappear in the shadows.

                                  SILVER
                    That is one messed up relationship.

                                  SILVER
                    Speaking of potential 
                      relationships, what s the story on 
                    your brother there?  Because he is 
                    looking good to me.

                                  ANNIE
                    I think he ll do anything with a 
                    pulse.

                                  SILVER
                    That s one thing I do have.

  Dixon and Navid approach.

                                  DIXON
                    It s 11:15.  Think we should be 
                    heading home.

                                  ANNIE
                    Yeah, I just wish I brought my 
                    bathing suit for a dip.  I ve still 
                    never been in the ocean.

                                  SILVER
                    Honey, this ain t Podunk, Kansas.  
                    Take off the dress and swim in your 
                      underwear.

  Silver takes off her dress and heads for the water.

                                  ANNIE
                    Is this insane?

                                  DIXON
                    This whole week s been insane,  but 
                    when have we ever had this much 
                    fun?

  Annie smiles and then pulls off her dress.

                                  ANNIE
                    Alright.  Welcome to California.

  They run to the water and dive in the ocean as we crane out...
