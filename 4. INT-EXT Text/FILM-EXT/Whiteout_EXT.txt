ANTARCTICA - DAY
Snow-covered hills thrust up out of a barren, white
wasteland. No buildings, no animals... nothing.
CLOSER: The hills are more defined. Rows of jagged
peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses. A fine `mist'
of wind-blown snow whips about this jumble of glinting
ice.
STILL CLOSER: We track down through valleys, skirt
crevasses, climb peaks and finally pause on a flat
stretch of ice. HOLD on this scene of timeless, savage
beauty, then...
THUD!!!
A FACE, hooded and goggled in ECW (extreme cold weather
gear) drops into frame, smashing down on the icy surface
with such brutal impact, the shattered goggle shield pops
out --
-- EYES STARE BLANKLY into camera -- locked in death.
It's a man.
Camera slowly starts to PULL BACK to see his limbs have
snapped at unnatural angles, the head grotesquely twisted
-- bright red arterial blood seeps from the corpse and
spreads out down tiny cracks in the ice until, with
startling speed, it turns dark and freezes.
We PULL BACK further and look down on the body, a bizarre
shape in a spider's web of frozen blood. And SLOWLY WE
PULL BACK... further and further...until all is dazzling
white.

CONTINUED:
The sounds of lapping surf and distant seagulls serenades
us like a rhythmic lullaby.
-- CU on WOMAN'S TOES digging up soft, white sand.
The
shadow of a palm tree cascading over top.
Widen slightly -- a pair of feminine hands, donning an
ANTIQUE SILVER ring on the left middle finger, are slowly
applying coconut tanning lotion onto firm, athletic
calves. Deep. Soothing. Then --
O.C. KNOCK KNOCK on a door.
The hands stop.
Another KNOCK KNOCK.
The lapping surf and seagull sounds come to an abrupt
halt.
WOMAN (O.C.)
(slightly annoyed)
...Yeah?
Widen to meet CARRIE STETKO, late 20's. Cargo pants --
rolled up, and an exercise top. She's kicking back, but
she's not at the beach.
In fact, she's in an office, sitting on a chair. A NEWLY
OPEN BAG OF KITTY LITTER sits next to a plastic tub she's
got her feet in. Two FLOOR LAMPS stand like sentinels
above her, blasting her with warm wattage. A fake palm
tree casts the shadow across her body. She's pulled the
earplugs out of her iPod -- back to the real world.
The door opens. Leaning into the room is JAMIE CLARK
(20's), African-American. She's dressed in a flannel
shirt, jeans. Carrie doesn't look entirely happy at the
intrusion.
JAMIE
Sorry, a Professor Sapperstein
needs to see you in biology. Said
it's urgent.
CARRIE
Alright --
Jamie leaves.
As Carrie gets to her feet, camera moves away from her,
panning around the small office. Half-packed up boxes
lay strewn about the floor.

A CALENDER hangs crookedly before a desk. Each day has
been marked off with a large X. THREE DAYS REMAIN
unmarked. Last space reads: WINTER-OVER, and in the
space next to it, there's a cut out picture of a tropical
beach.
A dart board is next to it with A PHOTOGRAPH pulverized
with dart holes over the Bullseye. It's of a candy-
striped pole topped with a silver ball, surrounded by
international flags - the South Pole. Carrie is standing
next to the pole, smiling at the camera, arm-in-arm with
SAM MURPHY (30's). Looks like he's handsome, but his
face is a little more obliterated than the rest of him.
CUT TO:
MCMURDO STATION - ANTARCTICA - DAY
An ugly sprawl of prefab buildings, power-lines and above
ground sewage pipes. It looks more like a Siberian work
camp than Antarctica's largest research base and
logistics hub. In the background, smoke rises from Mt.
Erebus.
SUPER:
MCMURDO STATION (USA)
POP: 2137
TEMP: -22
An icy wind HOWLS, but the base swarms with PARKA-CLAD
FIGURES shuttling supplies and packing up equipment for
winter.
We PICK UP CARRIE AND FOLLOW her as she strides down the
icy, unmade street. Her hood is pulled up and she's not
enjoying the cold. She reaches a row of buildings and
checks the names - GEOLOGY LAB #2...ASTROPHYSICS -
BERKLEY...until she reaches BIOLOGY BUILDING #7 and
pushes through the double doors into...
The red and white striped ceremonial south "pole" stands
surrounded by international flags.

P
opulation: 183
Temperature: - 55
Ice as far as the eye can see. In the background is the
base. It's much smaller than McMurdo - a few dozen
specialist buildings surrounding four circular buildings
raised on hydraulic stands, interconnected by tubular
shaped walkways.
Off in the distance -- A SNOWCAT mounted with a plow,
pushes small drifts of snow off the runway onto a LARGE
BERM. It's been busy -- SEVERAL OTHER BERMS flank both
sides of the runway.
Camera pans to Carrie with a gear bag in tow, as she
deplanes a LC-130. A HALF-DOMED HANGAR rises up on the
other side of the plane.
The main ASB complex is before her.
Across the top of the entrance is a huge poster: 3 DAYS
TO WINTER-OVER EVAC. Piles of packed equipment are
everywhere.
Half a dozen NAKED MEN wearing only boots and face masks
blow out the front door screaming and yelling, run around
the South Pole, right past her, and back into ASB.
Carrie heads in --
CARRIE
Bottom of the frickin' planet.
CUT TO:
9.
Selecting a putter from a bag of golf clubs is DOC FURY,
60. Looks seasoned. Bearded. Wears the only non-red
parka we've seen: it's royal blue, trimmed with black fur
and emblazoned with dozens of emblems and patches from
years of Antarctic service.
DOC
In less than three days we begin
Winter-over. The sky will go
completely black and stay that way
for six months.
Camera pulls back to REVEAL five NEWBIES (first-timers);
an Asian, French, Brazilian, Danish and an American. All
are standing on their jackets, shivering uncontrollably
in the wind.
DOC (cont'd)
The sane ninety percent of the
population will be leaving the
ice. Extreme weather conditions
make it impossible for planes from
the outside world to land. You
have chosen, for your own
misguided reasons, to stay. And
it is my responsibility to teach
you beakers how not to die.
Doc lines up on a hot pink golf ball and putts.
The ball rolls across the glacier in an impossible, wind-
driven arc, approaches a flag, and sinks.
DOC (cont'd)
Time?
The Asian holds a stopwatch.
He stares at it stupidly.
ASIAN
T... T... Three minutes.
(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED:
DOC
Your core body temperatures have
fallen to approximately 97
degrees. You are shivering
uncontrollably -- losing basic
motor skills. You're having
trouble focusing on even the
simplest tasks. In short, you are
well on your way to dying, and it
has only been two-hundred seconds.
(BEAT)
Put your coats on.
The class struggles into their jackets. Doc assists
those who, in their diminished capacity, are having
trouble figuring out how to put them on.
DOC (cont'd)
Your life is dependent on your
awareness of the weather. So be
aware. There is a condition that
arises around here known as a
whiteout. Don't get caught in it.
Winds kick up snow that's lain on
the ice for thousands of years --
can't see six inches in front of
your nose. Temperature plummets
to triple digits. We found bodies
less than a foot from safety and
warmth.
Carrie walks up.
Doc's eyes brighten.
DOC (cont'd)
Class, here we have another of the
many hazards found on Antarctica.
Say hello to Marshal Stetko.
Through a disjointed, chattering chorus --
CLASS
Hello Marshal Stetko.
DOC
Always a pleasure to see you.
Unlike most of the beaker-heads
down here.
(BEAT)
Social visit?
CARRIE
I wish -- We got a job. I need
you to take a ride with me.

Might be a body out on the ice.
DOC
Why's this crap always happen at
the end of the season?
Carrie pulls a Driver from Doc's golf bag.
Lines up
another pink ball.
DOC (cont'd)
Too cold for driving.
Carrie swings -- WHACK!
The ball shatters and pink bits
rain down around them.
CARRIE
So it is.
The Twin Otter is in the distant background. Carrie, Doc
and Delfy, who has a gear bag slung over his shoulder,
weave their way around huge ice boulders -- skirt small
crevasses. Mid-conversation...
(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:
DOC
... It's always different when
they freeze. Some curl up. Some
stretch out. Some tear their
clothes off. They get delirious.
What was that guy's name?
CARRIE
Linger.
DOC
Yeah. He's lost in a storm. We
can't find him, but we hear him on
the radio going on and on about
the Serengeti heat and his wife,
Janet. Next day, we find him
frozen solid, wearing nothing but
his bunny boots.
Delfy stops.
Grimaces.
Drops the gear bag.
DELFY
Jesus.
The CORPSE is just ahead -- a frozen display of death.
They all stare at it - the body in unnatural angles, the
spiderweb of frozen blood. Delfy looks nauseous.
DOC
Never seen a dead guy?
Delfy slowly shakes his head, no.
Carrie moves up to it. Takes a look down the deep
crevice four feet away. Can't see the bottom. She walks
around to get a look at the face. Blanches slightly.
DOC (cont'd)
You know him --
CARRIE
So do you. Think his name's
Weiss. We Wintered-over last year
with him. Played cards a couple
of times.
DOC
The guy who cheated?
CARRIE
Yeah.
Geologist, I think.
Doc takes a look.
(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED: (2)
DOC
Damn --
Carrie pulls out a DIGITAL CAMERA from a pocket.
Shoots
a couple of pics.
Doc takes a look up behind them. The ice steepens
sharply to a vast plateau, scattered with jagged boulders
of ice.
DOC (cont'd)
Looks like he fell from up there.
Carrie pauses with her camera, looks up -- doesn't seem
as convinced.
CARRIE
Then where's his crampons -- his
gear?
Doc looks around -- she's right.
DOC
Maybe down the crevasse?
CARRIE
Yeah, maybe --
Carrie glances to Delfy.
CARRIE (cont'd)
What's the closest camp?
DELFY
Brits -- about eighty miles west.
CARRIE
(looking at body - Soto)
What the hell where you doing all
the way out here?
Doc reaches down and tries to move the body -- doesn't
budge -- frozen solid into the ice.
DOC
Ah Christ -- he's a sticker.
Carrie unzips the gear bag.
Digs out ice two axes.
TIME CUT TO
20.
LATER
A pile of chopped ice is off to the side of corpse.
Delfy, who looks very uneasy about all this, grabs the
feet as Carrie and Doc each grab an arm.
CARRIE
You going to be alright?
DELFY
No -- this is the kind of stuff
that scars you for life.
They all strain to lift the body from the frozen ground.
DOC
Gonna give myself a Goddamn
hernia.
They keep pulling and -- SNAP! The arm Doc is holding
BREAKS OFF at the elbow. Lands on his ass.
Delfy turns away and pukes.
CARRIE
Oh yeah -- I'm really going to
miss this place.
CUT TO:
A SUBJECTIVE POV - THROUGH HIGH POWERED BINOCULARS
is peering down at them from the top of an ice cliff.
Widen to see A MAN wearing a white camouflage parka.
Lowers the binoculars. Goggles shield his eyes. He
moves on.
CUT TO:
Squat Soviet-ugly buildings, some collapsing, others with
boarded up windows, are barely visible through the
driving ice.
STORM LINES of different colors interconnect all the
buildings.
Carrie and Delfy, wearing full ECW gear, lean hard into
the wind, making their way towards the compound. She's
carrying a duffle bag. Can barely see the Twin Otter
behind them.
SUPER: Vostok Station (Russian Federation)
Population: 46
Temperature: -73
Carrie leans into the door, pushing it closed and locking
the wheel.
Two steps into the storm, the building behind her is
gone. Step after step, there's nothing but the guide
line and the ROAR of the storm.
A gust of wind lifts her off the ground.
She's caught by
her tether and smacked down on the ice.
Slowly regaining her stance, she pushes onward. Finally
Carrie runs into something. It takes her a moment to
realize she's at a building.
She grabs the wheel-lock and turns, breaking ice, opening
the door.
34.
Carrie jumps into the whiteout, catching the red storm
line and clipping in as she staggers forward. Glancing
back, she sees the killer in the doorway, then loses
sight of him as she's swallowed in the whiteout.
She struggles down the line, buffeted by the storm, but
HER HAND ON THE LINE moves erratically -- He's on.
She swivels a nervous whirl to see -- the Killer
materializing out of the whiteout right behind her.
He's
clipped into Carrie's line. He raises the axe.
He swings. She jumps back, losing her footing. Hits the
ice hard -- face first. The killer towers over her,
raising the axe again. Carrie drives her heel into his
knee, knocking him off balance. He drops next to her.
He reaches for Carrie, grabbing her mask, pulling it off.
She cries out as the FREEZING WIND catches her face.
The killer gets to his feet and delivers a rib-cracking
kick, flipping Carrie onto her back.
SOUND FADES from Carrie's world.
There is nothing but her strained BREATHING.
The killer
draws back the axe, shiny with frozen blood.
He swings.
Carrie UNCLIPS her harness from the tether. THE WIND
grabs her, and Carrie SLIDES AWAY -- the killer
disappearing from view behind the swirling wall of white.
(CONTINUED)
37.
CONTINUED:
Sliding across the ice, Carrie SLAMS into a pole.
Grabs
on.
Cinching her hood down, she searches the storm with no
idea which way to go.
Carrie glances up the post. Barely visible through the
blowing ice are signs pointing different directions:
"Moscow 17,030 Tokyo 13,329 Fiji 7,877 Los Angeles
15,641"
She pulls herself up and heads out, leaning into the
wind. Carrie staggers blindly, trying to protect her
face. Falling, she gets up, and struggles on.
Her drunken gait increases as she continues to lose heat.
A rope catches her in the neck. It's another storm line.
Carrie lurches forward, holding the line with one arm.
Finally, she bumps into something. It moves. It turns
to face her. IT'S THE KILLER AGAIN. He swings. She
deflects the blow with her free arm, and manages to grab
the axe head. The killer tears the axe free, taking
Carrie's glove with it.
He swings again, but Carrie pulls hard on the rope,
throwing him off balance.
The axe cuts through the line. The killer hits the
ground, and is immediately ushered away in the wind, as
Carrie, clinging to the rope, slides over the ice like a
pendulum.
The line goes tight; she's jerked to a stop. It takes
everything she's got to get to her feet. She slowly
struggles up the line.
More dead than alive, Carrie stumbles against the door
and grabs the wheel-lock with both hands.
Unable to bend the frozen fingers of her left hand around
the wheel, she struggles to turn it. Finally it gives.
(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED:
The door swings wide and she stumbles in. But she's
caught; her bare hand frozen to the metal.
Ripping it free, her SCREAM is lost to the wind.
Carrie falls, collapsing against the door.
Blackout
SMASH CUT TO
Delphy flies the plane over a labyrinth of deep, blue
crevices.
CAMP DELTA ONE ONE - DAY
Delfy's Twin Otter has landed beside the camp. There are
TWO BIG TENTS and some scattered equipment - a SNOWCAT, a
CHEST of TOOLS, DRUMS of GASOLINE.
The sky is dark with clouds and the wind MOANS.
A haze
of wind-driven snow whips by.
(CONTINUED)
45.
CONTINUED:
Carrie, Pryce and Delfy climb out from the plane and make
their way toward the tents. Place looks deserted.
CARRIE
What time is it?
Pryce glances to a watch strapped to the outside of his
jacket.
PRYCE
Two thirty.
CARRIE
A.M. or P.M.?
PRYCE
A.M.
CARRIE
Wonderful.
(re: tent)
I'll take this one.
She moves toward tent one, Pryce the other.
Carrie peers in. It's too dark to see anything. She
goes to pull out her flashlight with her left hand --
stops herself. Reaches in with her right, extracts it
from her pocket. Turns it on.
FLASHING POLICE REDS reflect off the glass of the front
doors of a hotel. Several squad cars are nosed up to the
entrance.
Patrons and bystanders are perched in various locations,
watching as A HANDCUFFED Carrie is escorted outside by
two uniformed officers. Her eyes are full of tears.
She's put into the backseat of one of the cars. As the
door closes, she stares out the window where Coroners are
loading a body under a sheet into the back of their
truck.
BACK TO SCENE
All three get cold-cocked by an invisible wind.
Carrie
steps away from the Cat. Pryce does too.
Her eyes scan the ice with cool appraisal.
It's
completely flat. Desert like.
PRYCE
You sure this is right?
CARRIE
Section 104.
These are the
coordinates.
DELFY
Maybe you wrote them down wrong.
Carrie ignores him. Walks further away from the cat.
Ice CRUNCHES UNDER HER FEET as she keeps looking -- then,
she stops. Something's not right. Looks DOWN.
Kneels to the ice. Scoops some up. Checks it out.
Perplexed. Pryce approaches from behind.
CARRIE
This is shaved ice.
(CONTINUED)
51.
CONTINUED:
She gets to her feet. Walks further -- her eyes now
paying close attention to the texture of the ice. After
a dozen steps, texture changes. Ice is now smooth --
like it's supposed to be.
She turns around.
Tries to get the bigger picture.
Looks at the ground all around her. Realizes a large
area has been blanketed with shaved pieces of ice a few
inches thick --
CARRIE (cont'd)
They were digging, Pryce. And
they tries to spread the ice to
hide it.
She heads back across the area.
Scans the horizon.
Takes another step forward.
WHOOSH! In an instant, Carrie's gone! DISAPPEARS below
the ice. Only a four foot wide hole remains, that was
covered up with a white, iced-over tarp.
Pryce and Delfy move toward her -- each hesitating
slightly, unsure of their own footing.
Pryce gets to the hole. Looks down. Carrie is
precariously dangling in an ICE SHAFT that slopes at a
slight angle. She's managed to grasp a protruding piece
of ice, but she's fighting the pain in her left hand to
hold on. It slips off. Below her -- nothing but
darkness.
CARRIE (cont'd)
Grab me!
Pryce lays flat. Reaches his hand down -- six inches too
short. Delfy appears from behind.
PRYCE
(to Delfy)
Hold my legs!
Delfy does.
Pryce inches closer.
CARRIE
I'm slipping!
PRYCE
Almost got you.
CARRIE
I'm losing my grip.
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED: (2)
He gets closer.
Closer.
Moves to within an inch from
hers --
-- She SLIPS.
Falls away.
Things become silent.
PRYCE
Carrie?
Can you hear me?
Delfy peers over Pryce's shoulder into the abyss.
DELFY
(YELLING)
Marshal?
CARRIE (O.C.)
...I'm okay.
DELFY
Saw a rope in the Cat.
Delfy springs to his feet.
Delfy wriggles out from the hole. He reaches back.
Helps Carrie to the surface. Pryce follows.
They look around. The weather has deteriorated - the sky
is dark with fast moving clouds. The wind is HOWLING.
The Snowcat is parked over the hole, blade lowered.
Delfy runs over, jumps onto the CAT.
Looks inside the
cab.
DELFY
Keys are still in it!
Carrie notices a single set of an airplane's ski tracks
in the distance.
(CONTINUED)
63.

CARRIE
Plane could've gone anywhere.
There's forty-six countries here
all counting down to Winter-over.
Rubin could just disappear in the
mayhem.
Delfy starts up the Cat.
Carrie pulls out her Nextel as Pryce takes out his PDA.
She depresses the walkie button -- makes her way to the
Cat.
CARRIE (cont'd)
Rhonda?
Walkie crackles.
RHONDA (V.O.)
(PISSED)
Where the hell are you?
CARRIE
Heading back. How many fly-ins to
McMurdo in the last four hours?
RHONDA (V.O.)
You expect me to --
CARRIE
(SNAPS)
-- How many?
RHONDA (V.O.)
Fifteen.
CARRIE
I need a list of names.
Carrie clicks off.
DELFY
You think Rubin might try to leave
out of McMurdo?
CARRIE
He knows I'm on his ass, so he
might. Anything's possible. I
want to eliminate his options.
She massages her gloved hand. Looks to Pryce who's
talking on his PDA as he heads toward the Cat.

PRYCE (INTO PHONE)
Six cannisters, maybe four inches

You have a photo of Rubin
anywhere?
CARRIE
Back at ASB --
PRYCE
(to Delfy)
How long to get there?
DELFY
When we get back to the plane,
I'll get ya there in forty
minutes.
As Pryce climbs into the cat --
A SUBJECTIVE POV - catches interval glimpses of Rubin
through the small windows that run along the side of the
tunnel as he dashes through.
CUT TO:
78.
Rubin eats the pain as he gets to his feet. Takes off.
Runs blindly with panting intensity verging on hysteria.
Disappears around the contour of ASB before the other guy
can get to his feet.
His assailant rises. Goes back up a couple steps to
retrieve his embedded ice axe, but finds it wedged so
tight, it won't budge. Abandons it.
Rubin staggers as he follows a line of storage bins
tucked against the base of the main building. The blood
from his wound already frozen on his shirt.
The cold -- it's killing him. Body's shaking.
The sun's
reflection off the ice is blinding.
CUT TO:
RUBIN'S POV -
-- His vision begins to cloud as the corneas are
literally being burned by the intense light. He tries to
shield them -- has little effect.
He looks over his shoulder -- gets a BLURRED IMAGE of his
attacker not far behind.
Rubin trips. Hands go to the icy ground to protect his
fall. Still hits hard. Starts to get up, but his palms
are frozen to the surface. Doesn't have time to care --
pulls hard, tearing the skin right off. Stands. Spins
around in a panicked whirl -- he's lost ground.
Continues to the end of the storage bins. Moves under
ASB, using the enormous HYDRAULIC LIFT COLUMNS to conceal
his movement.
81.
Up ahead -- forty yards away -- hope. He continues
toward some storage containers and the SNOW MELTER on the
other side, where TWO PEOPLE, CLAD IN ECW are finishing
filling an insulated container with water from an
insulated hose mounted to the Melter.
A snowmobile is
parked next to them.
He tries to scream, but only a dull, raspy, muffled voice
escapes...
RUBIN
...Help me.
The guys -- oblivious.
Carrie and Pryce, now bundled up in ECW, exit the room
and head down the stairs. Split up -- go opposite
directions around the complex.
Rubin's pace is slowing -- he's exerting himself to get
to the people as they climb into snowmobile with the
container.
Frostbite is chewing up his lungs. He's too
slow, they take off. He coughs up blood.
RUBIN
W..wa..wait.
He turns around to check on his pursuer.
Twenty feet
away and closing.
Rubin's eyes desperately search for some kind of weapon --
anything. Sees the insulated hose on the SNOW MELTER.
Heads for it.
Carrie passes a gap between storage containers where
several snow shovels are stuck into a mound of snow --
through their vertical slats, SHE CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF
RUBIN at the Snow Melter across on the other side of the
main building. Sees the ECW guy closing in.
82.
Pryce is moving under ASB. Passes a hydraulic support
leg. Spots Carrie on the other side moving toward Rubin.
Also sees the ECW guy in pursuit. Heads toward them.
Rubin's frostbitten hand reaches for the hose. Grabs it,
but he doesn't have the strength to turn it on. Throws a
defeated glance over his shoulder to see --
-- THE VILLAIN in ECW gear right on him! Shoves Rubin
against the tank. Grabs the hose from him. Turns it on -
- SPRAYING him head to toe.
Rubin's clothes turn to ice. One eye freezes shut. Lips
go cobalt blue. He tries to escape, but several stiff
steps away, he slows and finally stops: a prisoner in his
ice-locked clothing.
The man moves to Rubin.
Grabs his head, and - SNAP -
breaks his neck.
Rubin's body topples stiffly to the ground.
The Killer turns to leave the crime scene and --
-- WHACK! He's blindsided by a SHOVEL to his head.
Goggles shatter.
(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:
He drops.
Carrie pulls his parka hood away from his head -- snaps
the goggle from his face.
It's KELLER!
Blood trickles from the fresh wound to his head.
The shovel's courtesy of Carrie, who stands over top of
him. Holds the shovel to his neck like a guillotine
blade.
Pryce approaches. Glances to Rubin's frozen body -- neck
askew. Carrie is wound up. Keller's still recovering
from the impact --
KELLER
I sh... sh... shoulda killed you
at Vostok.
CARRIE
Where are the cannisters?
KELLER
Go to hell.
PRYCE
Wrong answer.
CARRIE
Help me drag him over here.
They each take his jacket by the shoulder -- pull him
back over to the Snow Melter.
CARRIE (cont'd)
Keep him still.
She hands the shovel to Pryce, who puts it to Keller's
neck.
Carrie pulls her Buck knife from her back pocket, then
whips off Keller's gloves. Tosses them aside. The cold
makes him more coherent. Sees Pryce at this throat.
PRYCE
Who's Tahir selling it to --
what's the intended target?
Keller shifts his attention to Carrie, who's using her
knife to SLICE open his ECW jacket and pants, exposing
bare arms and legs.
(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED: (2)
KELLER
What're you doing, you crazy
bitch?
Keller instantly starts to shake.
CARRIE
Why did you kill those scientists,
Keller? Was a four-way split too
much for you?
KELLER
Fuck you.
Carrie grabs the hose from the Snow Melter.
She brutally stomps on Keller's exposed arm, douses him
with water from the hose, welding his arm to the ground
as it freezes instantly.
CARRIE
Where is the uranium?
KELLER
(almost smug)
You have no idea what's going on
here, do you?
Keller begins to shiver violently.
PRYCE
Hit the sonofabitch again!
Carrie releases more water, freezing more of the arm.
He
screams. Pain is too much. He caves.
KELLER
The plane, they're in the fucking
plane.
Carrie's suddenly grabbed from behind.
It's Murphy.
Furious. Two other guys at his side.
MURPHY
Have you completely lost your
mind?
CARRIE
Let go of me.
She twists free of his grasp.
Gets in Keller's face.
CARRIE (cont'd)
Where in the plane?
(CONTINUED)
85.

KELLER
Find them yourself.
MURPHY
What the hell's going on?
She glares at him.
CARRIE
The cannisters are on the plane.
She looks to the guys that came out with Murphy.
CARRIE (cont'd)
Throw him in the holding cell.
The two guys go to Keller, but his arm is stuck to the
ground. Carrie kicks it free. It's painful. Keller
screams.
The guys lift him to his feet.
Haul him away.
Murphy looks to Pryce --
MURPHY
Who the hell are you?
Carrie looks at Pryce.
PRYCE
Name's Pryce.
Pryce looks at Carrie.
CARRIE
He's with the UN. We have to
search that plane now!
Murphy looks to Carrie with an intense glare --
MURPHY
We don't have time. We'll just
search it in Christchurch when it
lands.
Pryce steps in --
PRYCE
It's a twelve hour flight to
Christchurch. Anything can happen
in that time. Keller is here, so
we know it's still on the ground.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
86.
CONTINUED: (4)
PRYCE (cont'd)
Once that plane is in the air,
we've as good as lost it. Just
give us 10 minutes.
Murphy looks to Carrie, softens slightly --
CARRIE
Sam, do what is right here.
Come
on.
MURPHY
Do what you have to, but that
plane takes off in one hour.
CARRIE
We'll need some help.
MURPHY
I'll send what I can.
He leaves.
TIME CUT TO:
Carrie and Pryce, dressed in ECW are making their way
toward the hangar.
The two of them place the now unconscious Pryce to the
ground.
Carrie grabs Delfy's hands. Puts them directly on the
bloody wound. Surprisingly, he stays focused.
CARRIE
Press here.
Hard. Hard or he
will die!
DELFY
It won't stop!
Looks Delfy right in the eye.
CARRIE
He's not going to be number four!
(CONTINUED)
91.
CONTINUED:
Pryce moans.
Carrie rips open Pryce's jacket and liner.
Scoops up an armful of wind-blown ice. Starts packing it
around him. Keeps repeating the motion.
She keeps shooting looks to Keller's departing plane
moving toward the runway.
The cold hits Pryce, shocking him awake.
PRYCE
(GASPING)
What are you doing?
Get Keller.
She holds him down.
CARRIE
You're bleeding out. Freezing
drops your pulse. We have to slow
it down.
(BEAT)
You hold on.
Carrie snags the two-way off her hip like it's a quick
draw. Keys it.
CARRIE (cont'd)
Sam -- is Doc on the plane yet?
Beat.
MURPHY (V.O.)
No -- what's going --
CARRIE
Keller got out. He hurt Pryce --
he's bleeding bad. Where's Doc?
MURPHY (V.O.)
In the clinic. About to bring the
bodies out. What's --
CARRIE
Tell him to stay put, and I need
your help getting Pryce there.
We're at the hangar. I've got to
stop Keller, he's got the
cannisters.
Carrie doesn't wait for an answer.
Gives Delfy the two-
way.
(CONTINUED)
92.
CONTINUED: (2)
CARRIE (cont'd)
Don't let him die.
Carrie stands.
Determined.
Sprints back into the
hangar.
Off in the distance, Keller's heading for the front of
the runway -- has to turn around to take off into the
wind.
Carrie veers off, targeting the tunnel to ASB.
Hits her
light as she races in.
A funnel of bumpy light spreads across the ice before
Carrie on the snowmobile.
(CONTINUED)
93.
CONTINUED:
She holds tight as she burns a big U-TURN around one of
the berms and onto the runway.
Heads straight for the
lights of Keller's plane.
INSIDE KELLER'S PLANE
He sees Carrie.
KELLER
Crazy bitch.
INTERCUT:
She targets him like a Japanese zero.
Hundred yards and
closing.
He's pushing to get airborne.
Seventy-five yards between
them.
Gap narrows fast.
Fifty yards.
Stay on Carrie. Looks like suicide. She suddenly
swerves a hard left, disappearing behind a berm --
INSIDE WITH KELLER
He bears a momentary sense of triumph, starts to get
airborne -- until -- LAUNCHING UP OFF THE BERM is
Carrie's snowmobile! She bails, letting it continue
right toward him like a heat seeking missile as she
tumbles down the berm.
Keller's pov - a THOUSAND POUNDS of snowmobile comes at
him fast -- obliterates the cockpit.
SMASH CUT TO
CARRIE'S POV - AS THE IMPACT
Cripples the plane, pitching it sideways. A wing catches
the runway, CATAPULTING the entire plane into a cartwheel
of disaster as it veers off the runway and --
-- EXPLODES INTO A FIERY ERUPTION OF FLAME AND DEBRIS!
Resume -
Carrie slowly gets to her feet. The flames reflecting
off her goggles. She heads to the wreckage. The cold
and blowing snow extinguishing the flames quickly.
AT THE WRECKAGE
(CONTINUED)
94.
CONTINUED:
Carrie approaches. Only a sputtering of flame remains on
the front of the twisted remnants of the Otter's cockpit.
The aft seems relatively intact. Carrie looks in.
Sees the charred and already frozen remains of Keller.
In the back -- the charred duffle bag. She moves closer.
Reaches in through a broken window.
Pulls it out to the
runway.
Unzips it.
Is confused.
No cannisters.
Only survival
gear.
CUT TO:
The wind
is hurricane fierce as Murphy and his two men
are just
about to board the plane. Murphy looks to the
storm --
a forboding darkness getting closer by the
second.
He realizes they might not make it.
The LC-130's jet engines roars as he gains speed down the
runway -- faster and faster, then it suddenly gets
swallowed in the storm -- like an avalanche covering a
skier.
Camera stays on the fast moving storm, the plane, nowhere
in sight, until --
The LC-130 finally pushes out the front of it --
AIRBORNE. Takes off into the horizon, where we see that
the sun is just about to set.
DISSOLVE TO:
97.
Pull away from the building, which fades into the icy
darkness and howling wind of the Antarctic winter.
