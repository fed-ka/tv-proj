                        Hey, sorry I can't pick up...

          We CRANE UP, see TRUCKS and VANS from an asbestos removal
          firm parked by the front door.

                                        JOHNNY (ANSWERING MACHINE)
                        ...but I'm away for a few days
                        while some work's done on my house.

          PUSHING IN CLOSER, finding a worker wearing a white HAZ-

                        Our military began using psychics
                        in so-called "remote viewing"

          Gripping the glasses as a final voice bleeds in:  A MUEZZIN

          voice taking Johnny to --

          of a doorway (this is the formerly bearded man from the
          cave; we'll call him SUNGLASSES from now on).



          The actual scene.  We now find Johnny seated incongruously
          at his Tank desk in the middle of the teeming street,
          pedestrians moving by on either side like water sluicing
          around a rock in a stream.

          Johnny stands, taking in the scene:  Three to four-story
            buildings line both sides of the street, banners with
          Arabic slogans slung between them.  A row of bazaar stalls
          sell foods, weapons, DVDs, computer chips, even ecstasy
          pills.

          The street is clogged with people, mostly young bearded
            tribesmen men in colorful robes and caps, some in western
          clothes.  A few push bicycles, many carry Kalishnikovs,
          even young teens.  Women walk in clusters, covered in
          blue burquas.  A haze of dust and brick kiln smoke hangs
          over everything. 

                                        HARRIET (V.O.)
                        John...



          Johnny sees SUNGLASSES nearby at the auto parts stall. 
          He crosses to him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But there's our man.
                                (following him)
                        He got new sunglasses and shaved
                        his beard, but it's definitely
                        him.

          At the stall, Sunglasses is examining a length of FLEXIBLE
          TRANSPARENT TUBING while questioning the vendor in Pashtu. 
          The man nods enthusiastically, affirming whatever he's
          being asked. 

          But now Johnny's distracted by a LOUD NOISE that almost
          sounds like gunfire.  He looks to the other end of the
          market, where a man is having trouble with a MOPED that
          is backfiring.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "THE HUNT FOR OSAMA" - ACT TWO - 2/6/03 WHT-2  29.


    48CONTINUED:48

          Johnny turns back to see that Sunglasses is gone.  He
          moves into the crowd again, looking one way, then another. 
          But there's no sign of him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where'd he go? 

          Johnny stands in the center of the street, turning... and
          in a PIVOTING POV ANGLE, matching his turn, camera pans
          past a WINDOW... then double-takes back to it.  A white
          drape rustles in a breeze, beckoning.

          REVERSE ANGLE ON JOHNNY watching it... his eyes narrow...


          TOWARD THE WINDOW



          hold out a LEATHER BANDOLEER, as we pull back to see him
          showing it to TWO ARMED TRIBESMAN.  He speaks but it's as
          if he's lip-synching, because the voice we hear is
            Johnny's.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)

          A knot of women in blue burquas approach Johnny, straw
          shopping baskets in their arms.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        Well, there seems to be a pretty
                        strict dress code where the women
                        are concerned.  Most of them are
                        wearing those things that, um,
                        completely cover their --

                                        JOHNNY

                        Any particular color or colors?

          Johnny turns to watch the women go by.

                        mostly, with patterned borders.



          Johnny eyes a knot of heavily armed men strolling by.

                        Damn it!  We got a sniper!

                        They've got two major threats.  A
                        heavy machine gun about 30 meters
                        down the north-facing alley...

          Finster crouches by the alley opening and rolls a grenade
          backhanded down the alley.  It lands by the minigun. 
          BOOM!  The gun is taken out, along with several fighters,
          though others are already regrouping...

          Rising to his feet, ignoring the pain from his injured

                        it gets us out of here...

          And as if on cue...


    118N118NJOHNNY

          sees a FRIGHTENED VENDOR abandon a makeshift stall with a
          GREEN AWNING at the east end of the market, lift up a
          section of a CORRUGATED METAL WALL behind it and escape
          into a hidden alley.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's another exit.  An alley
                        on the northeast corner that's
                        blocked by a corrugated metal
                        wall.  Look for the green awning...

          The Command Radio Voice now crackling over the Sergeant's
          headset as he covers an ear to hear better.

                          Northeast corner... behind a green
                          awning...

          He looks and sees the awning, points to it...

                                        SERGEANT
                        There!  Finster, make a hole.

          Finster crouches, aims and fires his grenade launcher. 
          The GRENADE zips toward the wall.  KABOOM!  No more wall.

          And as the team now rushes across the dangerous
            intersecting alley while sending covering fire down it,
          heads across the street, each man again providing covering
          fire, Finster and Grimes are last, Finster helping to
          support his larger wounded friend, as Johnny moves
            alongside them as if he could somehow shield them both
          with his body.

          We can HEAR a chopper arriving in the distance.  It means
          safety.

          Finally, Johnny watches with relief as the last of the
          squad makes it safely into the other alley.  He turns
          then to take in the street, empty now, gunfire slacking...

          And as we PULL UP AND AWAY FROM JOHNNY and the scene WHITES
          OUT...

            considers saying what she finally says...

                        Stay in touch.*

          She moves away... after a thoughtful beat, Johnny walks*
