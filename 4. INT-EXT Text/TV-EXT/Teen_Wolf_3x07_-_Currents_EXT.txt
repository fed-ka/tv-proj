                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      Grabbing his helmet off the handlebar of his bike, Scott 
      notices Ethan stepping out of the hospital s exit toward him.

                                  ETHAN
                    I know you re not going to believe 
                    me, but I didn t do anything.

                                  SCOTT
                    All I know is the minute you got 
                    here, you went right after Danny. 
                    And your brother went after Lydia.

                                  ETHAN
                    We re not going to hurt him.

                                  SCOTT
                    Why should I believe you?

      With a careful glance about to ensure no one is around to 
      hear him, Ethan steps in close.

                                  ETHAN
                    Because we knew one of them was 
                    going to be important to you. And 
                    now we know it s Lydia.

      Before Scott can respond, he notices a strange sight past 
      Ethan. The twin turns, following his gaze to see--

      Dr. Hilyard s car slowly gliding across the parking lot. It 
      weaves through empty spaces and then SMACKS into the side of 
      another car, halting with the sound of CRUNCHING METAL.

      Dropping his helmet back, Scott rushes for the car with Ethan 
      right behind him. He yanks open the driver s side door to 
      discover--                  TEEN WOLF EP#307"CURRENTS"GREEN 5/7/138.

      It s empty. No one at the wheel. 

      Witnesses from the hospital entrance drift out while Scott 
      discovers a strange clue inside the car.

                                  ETHAN (CONT D)
                    What is that?

      Lifting it by its wing, Scott raises the large insect up to 
      the car s interior light. A single dead MOTH.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF


      Deputy cars hurtle into the lot while Sheriff Stilinski tries 
      to get statements from Melissa and Scott with Stiles s help.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Hold on. Were they both in the car?

                                  STILES
                    No, Dad, they re trying to tell you 
                    it s two different kidnappings. Two 
                    doctors. Both gone.

                                  STILINSKI
                    So whose car is this?

                                    MELISSA
                    Dr. Hilyard s car. The On Call 
                    doctor. The ER Attending is the one 
                    that never showed up.

      Pen paused over his notebook, Stilinski peers up to the scene 
      of the accident, the witnesses gathered, the crashed car. He 
      sees his son talking to Scott, but all he hears is his own 
      BREATHING.

                                  STILES
                    Dad?

                                  STILINSKI
                          (snapping out of it)
                    Sorry. Melissa, let me just focus 
                    on getting your story first. Boys, 
                    give us a second.

      Scott and Stiles retreat back to whisper in private. Stiles s 
      attention stays on Stilinski, however, noticing his father s 
      troubled demeanor.                  TEEN WOLF EP#307"CURRENTS"GREEN 5/7/139.

                                  SCOTT
                    These are definitely sacrifices, 
                    right?

                                  STILES
                    And it s one Deaton mentioned. 
                    Healers.

                                  SCOTT
                    But what about Danny? He was 
                    throwing up mistletoe. That s not a 
                      coincidence. And if he hadn t been 
                    with Ethan, he probably would ve 
                    died. How is Danny a Healer?

      The sound of Stilinski s CELL PHONE RINGING interrupts them. 
      Stiles glances to Scott.

                                  STILES
                    Can you hear?

                                  SCOTT
                          (nodding)
                    They found a body.


      In the same alley where Isaac first faced off with the Twins, 
      witnesses gather around the body of the ER Attending doctor 
      while Deputies try to keep them back.

      On the periphery of the crowd, Deputy Graeme talks to 
      Stilinski on her phone.

                                  STILINSKI (V.O.)
                    No garrotte this time?

                                  DEPUTY GRAEME
                    No. Which means what? Copy cat?

                                  STILINSKI (V.O.)
                    Or a change in M.O. But the head 
                    and throat are the same?

                                  DEPUTY GRAEME
                    Bashed and slashed.

      A CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER snaps pictures of the ER 
      Attending s wrists, red marks across the flesh.

      Argent peers through the crowd. Keeping his distance, he 
      notices Deucalion among the witnesses as well. Aiden guides 
      him about the scene, pausing to whisper in his ear.                  TEEN WOLF EP#307"CURRENTS"GREEN 5/7/1310.

      Argent s eyes hold on them until they finally disappear from 
      his peripheral vision, leaving him to gaze back at the 
      unsettling sight of the doctor s body.


      On his bike with his helmet in one hand and his cell phone 
      pressed to his ear with the other, Scott talks to Stiles.

                                  SCOTT
                    Deaton s got to be at one of the 
                    six locations. But they re all over 
                    town. I don t know how we can get 
                    to all of them fast enough.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    Maybe we don t have to. Danny was 
                    doing a project on something for 
                    Mr. Harris s Physics class. And I 
                    think it might actually mean 
                      something.

                                  SCOTT
                    What project?

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    It s about something called 
                    Telluric Currents.

      Scott slowly peers up.

                                  SCOTT
                    Did you say currents?


      Headlights blazing, the Jeep soars one way as Scott tears off 
      on his motocross bike in the opposite direction. Both of them 
      racing into the night. Racing against time.
