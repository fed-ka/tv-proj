    MONIQUE, the one-handed call girl from 110.  She walks down

    REVEAL RUDY has been waiting for her.  He grins.  Playful.  
    Just another guy meeting just another girl on the corner.

    Debra rings the bell again.  Nothing.  Then, just as she s 
    about to go, the door opens.  Sans coveralls and gloves, 
    Rudy pretends he was asleep.

    As the Uniforms break off, Dexter arrives at the crime scene 
    with his blood kit.

    Ignoring her, Dexter follows Debra over to the ersatz winter 
    wonderland.  Shepoints to a clock on the wallof Santa s 
    Cottage.  Its candy cane hands are frozen at:

                        need more to go on. 

    Passing by Santa s over-sized velvet throne, Dexter is drawn 
    to an enormous glittering tree.  UNDER THE TREE lies an 
    assortment of gifts wrapped in colorful paper, ribbons and 
    bows.  At first we don t see a body.  But as he comes 
    closer:

    DEXTER S POV

    reveals that some of those ribbons adorn wrapped BODY PARTS 
    nestled among the gifts... including Monique s head.  Her 
    face finally at peace.

    Monique s eyes widen.  Realizing her fate.

                      Oh God... please... no...

    Suddenly a dark figure fills FRAME, obscuring our view. We 
    hear Monique pleading for her life, a soft GURGLING SOUND, 
    then... eerie silence.

    Behind Rudy s back, Debra flashes the  call me  sign to

                        Batista s head for a matching wound... 

    Dexter watches as LaGuerta s attention momentarily drifts 
    through his lab window and out into the bullpen.

                        ...he s still pretty out of it.

    REVEAL what LaGuerta is looking at through the window: 
    Doakes leading an Ice Truck Killer briefingwith a gathering 
    of cops and detectives.

    Dapper, dignified Dexter is waist-deep in a DUMPSTER, 
    rooting through garbage.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      Oh, the humanity.  Times like this, I

                        accessible.  And less ripe.

    He rips open a garbage bag, watches its contents spill at 
    his feet.  Rifles through it.

                      But Harry taught me to trust my gut.   

    Rifling through its contents, Dexter clearly finds this 
    distasteful.  Still, he picks up yet another bag, tears into 
    it.  Its contents fall... and Dexter sees something.

                        People lie all the time, he said.

    Splashed across the front in large type: RUDY COOPER, YOU 
    MAY ALREADY BE A WINNER!! He digs in to the new pile of 
    garbage, rooting around, searching for something.  REVEAL

                      You did all this?

                                        RUDY
                      In fact, I did.  You like?

    He hands her the rose and kisses her.  She turns to him.

                                        DEBRA
                        I like.  I like so much that what I 
                        have to tell you is a lot harder.

                                        RUDY
                        Please tell me you re not leaving.

                                        DEBRA
                                (torn)
                      I m sorry, I hit traffic, I spent a 
                        half-hour getting here.  I have to 
                        turn around and go back. Least I got 
                      to see you.

    Rudy, smiling, takes out a ring -- MONIQUE S RING -- from 
    his pocket and getsdown on bendedknee.

                                        DEBRA
                        Wait.  Hang on --

                                        RUDY
                        You re sortaforcing my hand here.  I 
                        wanted to save this part till we were 
                      on the water, but, here goes.

    He takes Debra s hand.  Her grin is about to split her face.

                                        RUDY
                        I know it seems fast.  But to me, it 
                        feels like I ve waited my whole life 
                      for you.  And now that you re here... 
                        I don t want you to leave.

                        Debra Morgan... will you marry me?

                      No, no.  Stop at yes, I liked that 
                        part. 

                                        DEBRA
                        Yes, but... let s slow it down.  Lemme 
                        savor this.  I wanna be with you.  And 
                        I wanna enjoy it.  So I say  yes, 
                        but.

                        Okay.  I get it.

                                        DEBRA
                      You do?

                      Not really.But I think I can work 
                        with it.

                                        DEBRA
                        Good.  So, um...
                                (grinning)
                        I can still wear the ring, right?

    The wheels turn in Rudy s head.  Something clicks...

                                        RUDY
                        Yes... but.

    He grins at her, as he slips the ring on her finger.

                                        RUDY
                        There s a condition.

                                        DEBRA
                      Oh, is there?

                                        RUDY
                        Yes.  I know you have to go back.  But 
                      if you re gonnawear the ring, we have 
                      to celebrate.  One glass of wine.

    Debra looks up at him.  Beaming.

                                        DEBRA
                        I can live with that.

    Sweeping her up and into his arms, Rudy romantically carries 
    Debra up to the yacht...

    ON RUDY, at the yacht s helm, motoring off to parts unknown, 
    Debra s RINGING cell phone in hand.  He glances down at the 
    display:  DEXTER CALLING .

    Rudy grins, then forcefully HURLS her phone over the side of 
    the yacht into the dark, churning waters.  REVEAL Debra 
    lying on the deck, OUT COLD, duct tape binding her legs 
    together and her hands to the rail (but no tape on her
