      hands, looking definitely like a couple in the blush of a

      as the lighted sign goes dark -- closing up for the night. 
      TESS and KEVIN emerge from the gas station office and lock

      In the distance, through a heat shimmer, we see a squad of
      shirtless SOLDIERS running cross-country.  We hear:

      center.  A perimeter fence, topped with barbed wire, stretches
      off in the distance.

                    That's correct.  But as you recall,
                    there were problems.  Deaths.  Since
                    the Piersahl incident, we've scaled
                    back the pace of the promicin

                                  RYLAND
                    I never approved any such thing.  I
                    promised this country the protection
                    of enhanced soldiers.  And I will

      Collier strolls along the path, an irate Shawn at his side.

                                    COLLIER
                    Michael Lawrence's ability is both
                    unique and useful.  And he can
                    control it with a great deal of
                    accuracy.  Why wouldn't I make use
                    of him?

                                  SHAWN
                    Because he's a sixteen year old
                    kid, and you just turned him into a
                    felon. 

                                    COLLIER
                    Shawn, we needed to neutralize a
                    building full of NTAC agents.  That
                    boy allowed us to accomplish that
                    goal, without hurting anyone.  I
                    thought I showed great restraint,
                    given the urgency of our needs.

                                  SHAWN
                    What needs, Jordan?  What's so
                    important that we need to get into
                    bed with the NOVA group?
                          (and then)
                    I ran this place while you were
                    gone.  I deserve to know what you're
                    planning.

      Collier stops, turns to Shawn.  Considers him for a beat --

                                    COLLIER
                    Fair enough. 
                          (and then)
                    We're going to destroy Ryland's
                    enhanced soldier program.

                    Destroy, how?

                                    COLLIER
                    With NOVA's help, we're going to
                    attack the army base where the
                      experiment's being conducted.  We're
                    going to take out the lab, the
                    training facility...and when we
                    find the soldiers who are getting
                    promicin, we'll neutralize them.

      Shawn stares at Collier in disbelief -- Jordan's plan is
      more dangerous, more aggressive, than even he had feared.

                                  SHAWN
                    Jordan.  Attacking a military
                      installation?  Are you insane? 
                    Because that's how you sound.  I
                    don't care what you think you saw
                    while you were gone, but this is
                    the real world.  Do you know how
                    many people would die?  On both
                    sides.  We can't do this.

                                    COLLIER
                    We don't have a choice.  Once those
                    soldiers develop 4400 abilities, it
                    will be too late.

      And as Shawn reacts to Collier's cold determination --

                    Hope you're going to take some time
                    and visit Newfield's claim to fame. 
                    There's not another stump like it
                    on the whole west coast.

                                  DRIVER
                    We're just passing through.  So I
                    go back the way I came to find the
                    highway?

      Kevin waves to the office.  Tess steps out, heads over.

                                  KEVIN

                    That's easy.  But first I really
                    think you should visit the Newfield
                    stump.  There's a very nice gift

                    ruin it.

                                    COLLIER
                    If it were up to me, you'd live
                    happily here for many years. 
                          (and then, to Kevin)

                                    RICHARD
                    Maybe so.  But it seems to me we've
                    been in an undeclared war with the
                      government since we got back. 
                    Locking us in Quarantine.  Shooting
                    us up with the inhibitor. 
                      Disappearing any of us they feel
                      threatened by.  All Jordan's doing
                    is bringing the conflict out into
                    the open.

                                  SHAWN
                    Yeah, and we're going to lose. 
                    Jordan's going to sacrifice thousands
                    of lives.  For nothing.

                                    RICHARD
                    If you have another way, something
                      concrete...that will make us safer,
                    I'm willing to listen.

      Richard waits.  But Shawn has no answers.

                                    RICHARD (CONT'D)
                    I didn't think so.

      Richard walks away, leaving behind a defeated Shawn.  But
      Shawn knows he can't let Jordan's plan go ahead.


      Tom and Diana are in mid-conversation with Ryland and
      Isabelle.

                                  RYLAND
                    So you're saying, in spite of
                    Collier's denials, this base may
                    still be the target of a NOVA attack?

                                  TOM
                    It's possible, yes.

                                  RYLAND
                    And you came all this way to warn
                    me?  I'm touched.

                                  TOM
                    Just doing my job, Dennis.  It was
                    nothing personal.

                                  DIANA
                    Anyway, Collier knows you're here,
                    which means this place is no longer
                    secure.  Your little experiment
                    needs a new home.

                                  ISABELLE
                    Why?  I say let them come.
                          (to Ryland)
                    If Collier wants a fight, we'll
                    give him one.

      Ryland smiles in approval.

                                  RYLAND
                    She's right.  Collier talks a good
                    game, all about unity.  How we all
                    have to work together to save the
                    future.  And people actually believe
                    he means it.  Pathetic.
                          (and then)
                    But an attack will finally expose
                    him and the 4400 for what they really
                    are.  The enemy.
                          (and then)
                    You see, Tom.  I was right all along. 
                    It comes down to survival.  Us
                    against them.

                                  TOM
                    You sure you want to be at ground
                    zero for this one, Dennis?

45CONTINUED:45

                                  RYLAND
                    We're talking about defending the
                    human race, Tom.  Where else would
                    I be?
                          (and then)
                    We're staying right here.

      Off Tom and Diana -- there's a war coming, and they can't do
      anything about it.


      A downcast Shawn looks out over the gardens.

                                    COLLIER (O.S.)
                    How did it feel, turning your back
                    on me?

      ANGLE TO REVEAL Collier as he approaches Shawn.

                                  SHAWN
                    I was trying to save lives. 
                    Including yours.  Maybe if you had
                    told me everything, treated me with
                    a little respect, we could've worked
                    things out.  But you were too busy
                      manipulating me.  Like always. 
                          (and then)
                    You know Jordan, I ran this place
                    while you were gone.  And I did a
                    pretty good job of it.  But now
                    you're back.  And you and I?  It's
                    like nothing's changed.  You're
                    making all the decisions and I'm
                    playing catch-up.  Five steps behind. 

                                    COLLIER
                    Used to be ten.

      But if that's meant to be a compliment, it's not enough to
      appease Shawn.

                                    COLLIER (CONT'D)
                    Shawn.  I need you to trust me. 
                    Believe in me.

                                  SHAWN
                    You know what I think, Jordan? 
                    This whole messiah thing has gone
                    to your head.

                                    COLLIER
                    You're wrong.  I'm no messiah.  I'm
                    more like John Brown.

                                                                (CONTINUED)THE 4400   "Terrible Swift Sword"   (BLUE REVSIONS)   07/04/06     43.

                                  SHAWN
                    John Brown?  The guy who tried to
                    free the slaves?

                                    COLLIER
                    He surrounded himself with men who
                    believed as he did.  Who were willing
                    to do anything for their cause. 
                    That kind of devotion can change
                    the world.

                                  SHAWN
                    They killed John Brown.

                                    COLLIER
                    They killed me, too.

      Off Shawn -- how much faith does he still have in Jordan
      Collier?  


      Ryland steps in, followed by Cole and the load of promicin. 
      TWO ARMED GUARDS sit at a desk, in front of a security
      monitor.  Ryland waves them over.

                                  RYLAND
                    Give us a hand with this.

      The guards leave their desk, head over to help.  ANGLE OVER
      the security monitors as the Guards direct Cole as he steers
      the heavy pallet hauler across the loading dock to the huge
      roll-up metal doors.  The Guards appear on the monitors as
      they step into the view of the security cameras -- Cole, the
      promicin --

      Looking across the room, we see Ryland join them -- BUT ON
      THE MONITOR, RYLAND IS BOYD GELDER.  He has been using his
      ability to impersonate Ryland since he walked into Haspelcorp. 
      One of the Guards turns a key in a switchbox, and the door
      rises to reveal...

      ...Richard, Kevin, and Tess.  They all stand on the loading
      dock just outside the door.  Two large trucks sit parked in
      the driveway behind them.

                                    RICHARD
                    Thanks.  We'll take it from here.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      CLOSE ON Ben, puzzled by something he's just been told.

                                  BEN
                    You're saying you want to break up?

      ANOTHER ANGLE REVEALS Diana, walking beside him.  She doesn't
      look happy --

                                  DIANA
                    I don't want to.

                                  BEN
                    Then lets not.  I know how bad you
                    feel.  I feel bad too.  But I also
                    feel really really good.  Isn't
                    that worth holding on to?  Trying
                    at least?

                                  DIANA
                    Believe me, I am trying.  But it's
                    like we're never really alone. 
                    There's you, me, and April.  She's
                    the one crying. 

                                  BEN
                    Then I think I need to leave. 

                                  DIANA
                    Great.  Now April and I are both
                    crying.

                                  BEN
                    I didn't mean for good.  You're not
                    getting rid of me that easily.  But
                    I do have a job in London.  Five
                    days.  It'll give us some time to
                    think things over. 

                                  DIANA
                    Five days?

                                  BEN
                    Wanna come?

                    No.  Yes.  Just leave.  Please?

      He leans over, kisses her.

                                  BEN
                    I'll call you as soon as I get back.
                          (he gets up)
                    And just so you know.  Even if Maia
                    never made any prediction, I'd still
                    think we were meant for each other.

      He walks away -- off Diana, not sure what she wants, but
      knowing she misses him already. 


      A few reporters still linger nearby.  Tom gets out of his
      car, notices a limousine parked at the curb.  Wondering who
      the visitor could be, he heads inside.
