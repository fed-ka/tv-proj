      Henry and Ethan ride the elevator up to work.

                                  ETHAN
                    So no girlfriend?

                                  HENRY
                    You already asked me that.  No.

                                  ETHAN
                    Any pets?
                          (off Henry s look)
                    What?  I m just trying to determine 
                    if it s an utter lack of personal 
                      connections that makes you so good  
                    at your job.

      The elevator doors open and three PASSENGERS get on, all 
      looking at their phones.

                                  HENRY
                    I find it rather easy not to form  
                      a personal connection in a town 
                    that only values wireless 
                      connection.   

      PAN OVER to reveal Ethan and the rest of the passengers are 
      all tilting their phones around trying to find signal.



      Eliza steps off the elevator with Henry.

                                  HENRY
                    I ll need your implicit trust.  
                    That means you do anything and 
                      everything I say, even if it seems 
                      unorthodox.

                                  ELIZA
                    Totally.  Just no back-door stuff.

                                  HENRY
                    That s another thing.  You mustn t 
                      misinterpret my professional 
                    interest as romantic interest 
                    because I assure you: there isn t 
                    any.  

                                  ELIZA
                    Got it.  We re just friends.

                                  HENRY
                    We re not friends and it s 
                    important to me you acknowledge 
                    that.

                                  ELIZA
                    Fine.  We re not friends and you re 
                    not into me. 
                          (then)
                    So wait, why did you agree to help?

                                  HENRY
                    Because I can.  Now you just go 
                    about your day as you normally 
                    would.

                                    CHARMONIQUE (O.S.)
                    Good morning, how are you?                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1419.


                                  ELIZA
                    OMG, I changed my top so many times 
                    this morning, I swear, I got 
                    niplash and yet my breakfast got 
                    more likes than my outfit which 
                    stinks, speaking of, that bald dude 
                    from the 12th floor took total fart 
                    blanche in the elevator so if you 
                    catch a whiff of something it s 
                    residual him not me, LOL.

      Eliza starts to walk off.  Henry hooks her by the shirt and 
      pulls her back.

                                  HENRY
                    May I?  Point something out?
                          (then, to Charmonique)
                    Every day you greet Eliza, do you 
                    not?  Ask after her?  Inquire as to 
                    how she is?

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    Sure do!  I check in with erry--

                                  HENRY
                    And in the entire time that you ve 
                    worked here, has Eliza ever once 
                    asked how you are doing?
                          (to Eliza)
                    Do you know the first thing about 
                    this woman?  Do you even know her 
                    name?

      Henry whisks the PERSONALIZED MUG off Charmonique s desk and 
      places it behind his back.  Eliza looks completely blank.

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                          (whispers)
                      Charmonique.

                                  ELIZA
                          (whispers)
                    What?

      Henry places the mug back on her desk.

                                  ELIZA (CONT D)
                          (reading)
                       Charmonique? 
                          (to Henry)
                    Okay, but in my defense that s not 
                    a real name.
                          (re: mug)
                    She must have had that custom made.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1420.


                                  HENRY
                    Lesson Number One.  Each and every 
                    morning as you pass Charmonique s 
                    desk, I would like you to ask how 
                    she is doing. 

                                  ELIZA
                    Great.

                                  HENRY
                    We ll start right now.  Open your 
                    lips and repeat after me.  How are 
                    you?  How are yooooooou?   

                                  ELIZA
                          (to Charmonique)
                    How are yooooou?

      HENRY AND ELIZA-- look at Charmonique, expectantly.

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                          (a beat)
                    Goooood.  

      Eliza flashes the thumbs-up and starts off.  Henry pulls her 
      back.

                                  HENRY
                    Then, if you will, a follow up 
                    question.  For example.   And how 
                    did you sleep last night? 

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    You know, not great.  But that s 
                    cause I had Dionysus in the bed 
                    with me.  

                                  HENRY
                    Dionysus?  The god of wine-making?

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    No, my six year-old.  He s got 
                    sleep apnea.

                                  HENRY
                    Did you hear that, Eliza? 
                      Apparently, Charmonique and her son 
                    didn t sleep well.  Now it s your 
                    turn to say something sympathetic.

      HENRY AND CHARMONIQUE-- look at Eliza, expectantly.  

                                  ELIZA
                    I m really glad I don t have kids.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1421.


                                  HENRY
                    That was about you, not her.  Try 
                    again.

      Eliza squirms uncertainly.  Tries again.

                                  ELIZA
                    Having kids must really suck.  
                          (then)
                    For you.



      Henry escorts Eliza up the steps of the church.  

                                  ELIZA (V.O.)
                    I d shed my skin-tight mini and six-
                    inch heels for a gown that left 
                      everything to the imagination.  And 
                    in this sensible wedge shoe?  I 
                    could have danced all night.

      Henry stops and turns to Eliza.

                                  HENRY
                    No phone.

                                  ELIZA
                    No phone.

                                  HENRY
                    Today is about focusing on a beauty 
                    other than your own.

      Eliza smiles.

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Something funny?

                                  ELIZA
                    You just called me beautiful.

                                  HENRY
                      I absolutely didn t.

                                  ELIZA
                    You indirectly did.

      Henry rolls his eyes and escorts Eliza inside.



      Henry and Eliza are in a yelling match outside the church.

                                  ELIZA
                    Look, I m not used to paying 
                    attention to super boring long 
                    stuff, okay?

                                  HENRY
                    No.  Not okay.  It s not just 
                    yourself you ve embarrassed! I 
                      specifically said no phone--

                                  ELIZA
                    Okay, god.  Haven t you ever made a 
                    mistake before?

                                  HENRY
                    Only once.  And that was when I 
                    agreed to help you.

                                  ELIZA
                    Really? Are you helping me?  Or am 
                    I helping you.  Don t think I 
                    didn t notice you didn t have a 
                    date for this event-- 

                                  HENRY
                    Don t flatter yourself!

                                  ELIZA
                    And it s no surprise!  You re an 
                    unfun man.

                                  HENRY
                    Unfun is not a word--

                                  ELIZA
                    You re a holier-than-thou, 
                      antisocial, workaholic wanker!

                                  HENRY
                    And you, my dear, are a lost cause!                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1433.


      Eliza stops, stung by that.

                                  ELIZA
                    You know Henry, you may be good at 
                    your job-- but outside of the 
                    office?  You suck. 

                                  BRYN (O.S.)
                    Ugh!  You SUCK!



      Bryn finds the beautiful dress she loaned Eliza crumpled in a 
      plastic grocery bag hanging from her doorknob.

                                  BRYN
                    I knew I shouldn t have loaned her 
                    anything!



      Eliza clicks away on her phone as she walks past Charmonique.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1434.


                                  ELIZA
                    Hey, Charmonique.  How was your 
                    night?  Dionysus sleeping any 
                    better?

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    You know what?  He is.  Went ahead 
                    and got him one of those sleep 
                    apnea masks?  Looks like Bane, but 
                    sleeps like a baby.

                                  ELIZA
                    Good deal, see ya later.

      Eliza continues on her way then STOPS.  She whirls around.

                                  ELIZA (CONT D)
                      Charmonique!

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    What!

                                  ELIZA
                    I just asked you about something 
                    that had nothing to do with me and 
                    was interested in your reply for 
                    real! 

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    For real?!

                                  ELIZA
                    For real!   

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    Okay, y all need to keep up the 
                    good work.

                                  ELIZA
                    Yeah...

                                    CHARMONIQUE
                    And I don t know if it s like that 
                    between y all?  But y all babies 
                    would have some good-ass bone 
                      structure.



      Eliza knocks on Henry s front door, urgently.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1435.


                                  ELIZA
                    Henry?  Are you in there?  Look, I 
                    know we both said some pretty harsh 
                    stuff and I wish I could just 
                    command-z our whole argument.  But 
                    I really think we can move past it!  
                    So if you think so too, please open 
                    this door right now.

      Henry opens the door, dressed impeccably for work.

                                  ELIZA (CONT D)
                    You opened!

                                  HENRY
                    This is the exit from my home.  
                    Excuse me.

      Henry tries to move past Eliza.

                                  ELIZA
                    I m not a lost cause.  What you re 
                    doing with me, it is working.  And 
                    I wasn t on my phone because I was 
                    bored, that wedding gave me feels--

                                  HENRY
                     Feels? 

                                  ELIZA
                    --and that scared me and then I 
                    lashed out and called you a 
                     wanker  which was probably an 
                    incorrect use of the word.

                                  HENRY
                    Actually, it was perfect.

                                  ELIZA
                          (smiles)
                    Okay, that sounded a little bit 
                    like an apology and I totally 
                    forgive you.  Please don t give up 
                    on me.  Please don t let me ruin 
                    your perfect track record.  

      Just then RAIN begins to fall.

                                  HENRY
                    Look at that.  Medium rainfall on 
                    roof with gentle overspill from 
                    gutters.  Your favorite.

      Instinctively, Eliza lifts her phone to capture the moment.                        #SELFIE -- NETWORK DRAFT -- 1-15-1436.


                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Don t.  You think that you re 
                     getting it  but you are, in fact, 
                    missing it.

      Eliza studies Henry, who stands watching the rain. 

                                  ELIZA
                    Well, I don t see what s so much 
                    better about what you re doing.  
                    Standing here, in your perfectly 
                    pressed suit.  Are you  getting 
                    it? 

      Henry considers that.  He steps from the porch out into the 
      downpour.  Instantly, he is drenched.

                                  HENRY
                    Yes!  I am!

                                  ELIZA
                    Okay, sorry, but I have to get 
                    this!

      Eliza pulls out her phone and Henry runs to avoid being 
      filmed.  He SLIPS and falls.  Eliza LAUGHS.

                                  HENRY
                    See!  That s exactly what we need 
                    to work on.  It s not funny when 
                    someone is injured.

                                  ELIZA
                    Yet, to me-- it is!  That s why I 
                    need your help. 

                                  HENRY
                          (re: ankle)
                    I need your help.

      Eliza runs out into the rain to help Henry who is limping 
      towards the house.  As the camera starts to TRUCK OUT:

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    If that ends up on the web, I 
                    swear, I ll kill you.

                                  ELIZA
                    Okay, but no one calls it  the web  
                    anymore.  Just so you know. 

      As the two share a look it s the END OF SHOW.
