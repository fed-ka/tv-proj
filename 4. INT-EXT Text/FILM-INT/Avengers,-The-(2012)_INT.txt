Agent Coulson leads Hill and Fury through the radiation section
of the facility. Hundreds of technicians and other staff run
around, taking only the essentials.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from
the Tesseract four hours ago.
NICK FURY
NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test
phase.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in
the room. Spontaneous advancement.
AGENT MARIA HILL
It just turned itself on?
NICK FURY
What are the energy levels now?
AGENT PHIL COULSON
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it
down, we ordered the evac.
NICK FURY
How long to get everyone out?
AGENT PHIL COULSON
Campus should be clear in the next half
hour.
NICK FURY
Do better.
CONTINUOUSLY HEADING DOWN TO RADIATION FACILITY FLOOR
AGENT MARIA HILL
Sir, evacuation may be futile.
NICK FURY
We should tell them to go back to
sleep?
AGENT MARIA HILL
If we can't control the Tesseract's
energy, there may not be a minimum safe
distance.
NICK FURY
I need you to make sure that PHASE 2
prototypes are shipped out.
AGENT MARIA HILL
Sir, is that really a priority right
now?
NICK FURY
Until such time as the world ends, we
will act as though it intends to spin
on. Clear out the tech below. Every
piece of PHASE 2 on a truck and gone.
AGENT MARIA HILL
Yes, sir.
(to standing agents)
With me.
Fury enters the lab facility where the Tesseract is being held
by a COMPACT MUON SOLENOID COIL CHAMBER.
NICK FURY
Talk to me, doctor.
DR. ERIK SELVIG emerges from behind the CMS machine, concerned.
The Tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings
shoot out at random.
SELVIG
Director.
NICK FURY
Is there anything we know for certain?
SELVIG
Tesseract is misbehaving.
NICK FURY
Is that supposed to be funny?
SELVIG
No, it's not funny at all. The
Tesseract is not only active,
she's...misbehaving.
NICK FURY
How soon until you pull the plug?
SELVIG
She's an energy source. If we turn off
the power, she turns it back on. If she
reaches peak level...
NICK FURY
We've prepared for this, doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.
SELVIG
We don't have the harness. Our
calculations are far from complete. Now
she's throwing off interference,
radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels
of gamma radiation.
NICK FURY
That can be harmful. Where's Barton?
SELVIG
The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.
We see CLINT BARTON, dressed in black tactical gear, is up on
the railings watching them below, Fury calls Barton on his
earpiece.
NICK FURY
Agent Barton, report.
BARTON rappels down from the catwalk. Walks up to Fury. They
both walk around the facility in a discreet manner.
NICK FURY
I gave you this detail so you could
keep a close eye on things.
CLINT BARTON
Well, I see better from a distance.
NICK FURY
Are you seeing anything that might set
this thing off?
NASA SCIENTIST
(TO SELVIG)
Doctor, it's spiking again.
CLINT BARTON
No one's come or gone. It's oven is
clean. No contacts, no I.M.'s. If there
was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at
this end.
NICK FURY
At this end?
CLINT BARTON
Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the
other end of space, right? The doors
open from both sides.
DR. SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the
monitoring his worst nightmares. Suddenly- the Tesseract
THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility. Big enough where both
Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends
of the facility.
The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and
louder, like a boiling pot of water. The Tesseract's energy
builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge, which HITS
at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device. The
great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy. The beam then
forms a VORTEX, which then opens up a PORTAL.
A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED. From the portal, the blackness of
SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars
appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room, blinding
everyone.
The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the
top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling. It's abnormally
quiet. Then... HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform.
SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands. A figure is
kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it. It's LOKI.
Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head. The smile
dies down. He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and
Selvig. He stands up, holing the scepter.
NICK FURY
Sir, please put down the spear!
Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury
and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT
TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss
Loki's fired shot.
ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the
bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the
platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.
In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his
KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to
see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost
gone to shit.
Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton
raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.
LOKI
You have heart.
Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's
eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind
is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands
straight.
As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of
several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract,
placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then...
LOKI
Please don't. I still need that.
NICK FURY
(TURNING)
This doesn't have to get any messier.
LOKI
Of course it does. I've come too far
for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard,
and I am burdened with glorious
purpose.
SELVIG
Loki? Brother of Thor?
NICK FURY
We have no quarrel with your people.
LOKI
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.
NICK FURY
You planning to step on us?
LOKI
I come with glad tidings, of a world
made free.
NICK FURY
Free from what?
LOKI
Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie.
Once you accept that, in your heart...
Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's
standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart.
Selvig's eyes glow BLACK.
LOKI
You will know peace.
NICK FURY
Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think
you mean the other thing.
From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud
RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion.
CLINT BARTON
Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This
place is about to blow. Drop a hundred
feet of rock on us. He means to bury
us.
NICK FURY
Like The Pharaohs of Odin.
SELVIG
He's right. The portal is collapsing in
on itself. You got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical.
LOKI
Well, then...
Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY
WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. Barton grabs the case containing the
Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other
S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling.
Loki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in
the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain
weapons. Agent Hill watches in confusion, referring to Loki.
CLINT BARTON
(pointing to the Loki team)
Need these vehicles.
AGENT MARIA HILL
Who's that?
CLINT BARTON
He didn't tell me.
Agent Hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck
and turns to leave, as she's walking away...
NICK FURY
(through the walkie talkie)
Hill, do you copy?!
Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill.
BACK AT THE LAB
Fury is sitting up, pulling out the bullet, breathing heavily.
NICK FURY
Barton is...
Suddenly, Hill turns to SHOOT AT BARTON, but Barton is already
POINTING HIS GUN at her and starts SHOOTING, he moves the
driver's seat of the truck and DRIVES OFF as Hill keeps
shooting.
BACK AT THE LAB
Fury is holding his side, running.
NICK FURY
He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the
vacuum chamber ceiling.
Agent Hill SLIPS into a JEEP and follows after Barton's
truck.Loki's trucks SCREECH across the tunnel. Several SHIELD
trucks pull up to them. A drive-by shooting ensues.
Loki, who stands on top of the bed of the truck, uses his
scepter and EMITS energy blasts, flipping over SHIELD trucks.
They get in, the cars roar out after them. Agent Hill puts
herself at a distance.
Fury races out of the hallway, avoiding falling pipes. The
entire facility is now in a full earthquake.
Agent Coulson and several SHIELD agents fall down the steps,
dropping SILVER CASES of information. They attempt to grab them,
but...
AGENT PHIL COULSON
No! Leave it!
They run out of there like a bat from hell.
Agent Hill's JEEP ROARS out of a side of Barton's truck and
pulls up alongside them on the left. She goes way ahead and
pulls her brake, swerving into a 360, facing Barton's truck and
driving in reverse.
Barton's ARMS reach out the open window and OPENS FIRE. Agent
Hill figures `fuck it' and SHOOTS her windshield OPENING FIRE on
Barton.
Still in a chase and drive-by sequence, Barton's pushes the
pedal harder, which causes Agent Hill's JEEP to WOBBLE out and
put her back behind.
The Tesseract's energy cloud now SHRINKS into a SMALL BALL OF
WHITE LIGHT. Then...
A CLOUD OF BLUE LIGHT CONSUMES THE ENTIRE FACILITY AND PARTS OF
THE DESERT. Fury watches from below, a RAPID build-up into what
may be an implosion. Several miles away, Agent Coulson's van
feels a JOLT of the Tesseract's BLASTWAVE. THE ENTIRE FACILITY
SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF-- A TERRIFYING, UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION.
The BLASTWAVE of the Tesseract causes the tunnel to cave it.
Like an ocean wave, blinding crumbles of falling rock, fall onto
Agent Hill's JEEP, leaving her NEARLY trapped under this blanket
of rock.
On the Barton's truck, they escape the tunnel and drive into the
desert landscape. Fury's helicopter ROARS over Barton's truck.
Loki looks up.
From the chopper's door, it slides open and Fury stands there,
holding a gun, SHOOTING at Barton's, giving an honoring image of
JULES WINNFIELD.
Loki looks at Fury and in a fit of RAGE, points his scepter
SHOOTS OUT THE BLUE LIGHT. The chopper CATCHES on fire, GOING
DOWN in a FIERY BALL. Fury, like the boss he is, JUMPS OUT and
touches down onto the desert floor. The chopper BARRELS along
the ground.
Fury, coming back to his senses, FIRES at Loki, but they're
toofar and too late. Loki looks back, smiling. Fury stands
there, MIND REELING. Then...
AGENT PHIL COULSON
(WALKIE TALKIE)
Director? Director Fury, do you copy?
NICK FURY
The Tesseract is with the hostile
force. I have men down. Hill?
Agent Hill climbs out her JEEP, which is sandwiched in, but
luckily, not her.
AGENT MARIA HILL
A lot of men still under, don't know
how many survivors.
A tiny shack. The LITTLE GIRL runs up the steps, only to be
stopped by an attending woman. Then, the LITTLE GIRL spots him.
BRUCE BANNER, their LOCAL doctor.
ATTENDING WOMAN
What are doing here?! Get out! You
shouldn't be here!
LITTLE GIRL
I have to see the doctor! It's my
father!
BANNER
Calm down. What's wrong?
LITTLE GIRL
My father...
Banner looks behind him seeing how the girl is staring at a few
people, lying down, looking very sick.
BANNER
Is he like them?
The LITTLE GIRL holds out all the money she has in the world.
LITTLE GIRL
Please.
Banner quickly follows the LITTLE GIRL inside her house. As he
walks in, the LITTLE GIRL ESCAPES THROUGH THE WINDOW. Banner is
left standing there like a dumbass.
BANNER
Should have got paid up front, Banner.
Natasha then appears from behind the curtains. Banner turns
around, quietly.
NATASHA
You know, for a man who's supposed to
be avoiding stress, you picked a hell
of a place to settle.
BANNER
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.
NATASHA
Then, what is it? Yoga?
BANNER
You brought me to the edge of the city,
smart. I uh... assume the whole place
is surrounded?
NATASHA
Just you and me.
BANNER
And your actress buddy, is she a spy
too? Do they start that young?
NATASHA
I did.
BANNER
Who are you?
NATASHA
Natasha Romanoff.
BANNER
Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff?
Because that's not gonna work out for
everyone.
NATASHA
No. No. Of course not. I'm here on
behalf of SHIELD.
BANNER
SHIELD. How did they find me?
NATASHA
We never lost you, doctor. We've kept
our distance, even helped keep some
other interested parties off your
scent.
BANNER
Why?
NATASHA
Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I
need you to come in.
BANNER
What if I said no?
NATASHA
I'll persuade you.
BANNER
And what if the... other guy says no?
NATASHA
You've been more than a year without an
incident. I don't think you wanna break
that streak.
BANNER
I don't always get what I want.
NATASHA
Doctor, we're facing a potential global
catastrophe.
BANNER
Well, those I actively try to avoid.
NATASHA
This is the Tesseract. It has the
potential energy to wipe out the
planet.
She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner
takes a closer look.
BANNER
What does Fury want me to do? Swallow
it?
NATASHA
Well, he wants you to find it. It's
been taken. It emits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.
There's no one that knows gamma
radiation like you do. If there was,
that's where I'd be.
BANNER
So Fury isn't after the monster?
NATASHA
Not that he's told me.
BANNER
And he tells you everything?
NATASHA
Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.
BANNER
He needs me in a cage?
NATASHA
No one's gonna put you in a...
BANNER
STOP LYING TO ME!
The THUNDEROUS TONE in is voice makes Natasha QUICKLY grab her
gun and point it at him, but something is now OFF in the
atmosphere. Banner stands straight up, smiling.
BANNER
I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted
to see what you'd do. Why don't we do
this the easy way, where you don't use
that, and the other guy doesn't make a
mess? Okay? Natasha...
Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun
and speaks into her earpiece.
NATASHA
Stand down. We're good here.
Banner looks at Natasha, charming a smile at her.
BANNER
Just you and me?
Natasha fidgets now that she exposed her guard down.
Fury is facing several LARGE MONITORS as he as a conference with
members of the WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL.
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
This is out of line, Director. You're
dealing with forces you can't control.
NICK FURY
You ever been in a war, Councilman? In
a firefight? Did you feel an
overabundance of control?
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
You saying that this Asgard has
declared war on our planet?
NICK FURY
Not Asgard. Loki.
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
He can't be working alone. What about
the other one? His brother.
NICK FURY
Our intelligence says, Thor is not a
hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't
depend on him to help. It's up to us.
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
Which is why you should be focusing on
phase 2, it was designed for exactly...
NICK FURY
PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We
need a response team.
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
The Avengers Initiative was shut down.
NICK FURY
This isn't about The Avengers.
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
We're running the world's greatest
covert security network and you're
gonna leave the fate of human race to a
handful of freaks.
NICK FURY
I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We
need a response team. These people
maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I
believe with the right push they can be
exactly what we need.
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
You believe?
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
War isn't won by sentiment, Director.
NICK FURY
No, it's won by soldiers.
Somewhere in an old, almost WWII-esque boxing gym, STEVE ROGERS,
a man out of time, THE FIRST AVENGER, FUCKIN' CAPTAIN AMERICA is
PUMMELING a punching bag. With every swing, it's like a memory
he's trying to fight off and repress.
Steve's rage keeps building as he punches the bag. It gets
harder...
Steve places his COMPASS with an image of PEGGY CARTER. The time
is here for him to crash the plane.
Steve closes his eyes. Goes at the bag harder.
PEGGY (V.O.)
You won't be alone.
The RED SKULL picks up the TESSERACT.
Steve opens his eyes and fuckin' tears the bag as the last
memory kicks in. I don't think he can physically stop...
SHIELD SCIENTIST (V.O.)
Oh my god!
A half frozen Steve Roger is lying down on a medical slab. Two
SHIELD SCIENTISTS run over hi-tech devices to see if his vitals
are up. And it seems...
SHIELD SCIENTIST
This guy is still alive!
Steve FUCKING tears the bag open, off its chain, spilling out
the sand. He stands, breathing hard, letting out 70 years of
over repressed feeling.
After taking a few breathers, Steve picks up another punching
bag, which is laying next another DOZEN BAGS. He hooks the bag
up and starts punching again. Fury walks in.
NICK FURY
Trouble sleeping?
STEVE
I slept for seventy years, sir. I think
I've had my fill.
NICK FURY
Then you should be out, celebrating,
seeing the world.
Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the
tape off his hands. He sits down.
STEVE
I went under, the world was at war, I
wake up, they say we won. They didn't
say what we lost.
NICK FURY
We've made some mistakes along the way.
Some very recently.
STEVE
You here with a mission, sir?
NICK FURY
I am.
STEVE
Trying to get me back in the world?
NICK FURY
Trying to save it.
Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files
on HYDRA'S projects.
STEVE
Hydra's secret weapon.
NICK FURY
Howard Stark fished that out of the
ocean when he was looking for you. He
thought what we think, the Tesseract
could be the key to unlimited
sustainable energy. That's something
the world sorely needs.
STEVE
Who took it from you?
NICK FURY
He's called Loki. He's not from around
here. There's a lot we'll have to bring
you up to speed on if you're in. The
world has gotten even stranger than you
already know.
STEVE
At this point, I doubt anything would
surprise me.
NICK FURY
Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a
debriefing package waiting for you back
at your apartment.
Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Starts walking out of
the gym.
NICK FURY
Is there anything you can tell us about
the Tesseract that we ought to know
now?
STEVE
You should have left it in the ocean.
Out in the Atlantic Ocean, TONY STARK, in his IRON MAN suit, is
cutting a PIPELINE TRANSPORT with a laser cutter coming from his
hand. He then places a STARK ENERGY REACTOR. It lights up. IRON
MAN rockets out of the water and flies towards STARK TOWER.
TONY
You're good on this end. The rest is up
to you.
PEPPER POTTS
(on the other line)
You disconnected the transition lines?
Are we off the grid?
INSIDE THE SUIT -- PEPPER APPEARS ON HIS HUD MONITOR.
TONY
Stark Tower is about to become a beacon
of self-sustaining clean energy.
PEPPER
Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over
and it actually works?
TONY
I assume. Light her up.
As IRON MAN flies to the STARK TOWER BUILDING, the power is
switched on and the STARK sign LIGHTS UP.
PEPPER
How does it look?
TONY
Like Christmas, but with more... me.
PEPPER
Gotta go wider on the public awareness
campaign. You need to do some press. I
can do some more tomorrow. I'm working
on the zoning for the next billboards.
TONY
Pepper, you're killing me. Remember?
Enjoy the moment.
PEPPER
Then get in here and I will.
TONY arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process
of taking off his IRON MAN suit through a hi-tech gauntlet of
gadgets.
JARVIS
Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the
line.
TONY
I'm not in. I'm actually out.
JARVIS
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.
TONY
Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.
PEPPER POTTS stares up at the monitors of the reactor device.
PEPPER
Levels are holding steady... I think.
TONY
Of course they are, I was directly
involved. Which brings me to my next
question: how does it feel to be a
genius?
PEPPER
Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now,
would I?
TONY
What do you mean? All this came from
you.
PEPPER
No. All this came from that.
Points to the energy in his chest plate.
TONY
Give yourself some credit, please.
Stark Tower is your baby. Give
yourself... twelve percent of the
credit.
PEPPER
Twelve percent?
TONY
An argument can be made for fifteen.
PEPPER
Twelve percent? For my baby?
TONY
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.
And sorry, but the security snafu? That
was on you.
PEPPER
Oooooh.
TONY
My private elevator...
PEPPER
You mean OUR elevator?
TONY
...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm
going to pay for that comment about
percentages in some subtle way later,
aren't I?
Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne.
PEPPER
Not gonna be that subtle.
TONY
I'll tell you what. Next building's
gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.
PEPPER
On the lease.
TONY
...Call your mom, can you bunk over?
JARVIS
Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my
protocols are being overwritten.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
Stark, we need to talk. Tony picks up
his phone and looks into it at Coulson.
TONY
You have reached the life model decoy
of Tony Stark, please leave a message.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
This is urgent.
TONY
Then leave it urgently.
At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears.
TONY
Security breach.
(TO PEPPER)
That's on you.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
Mr. Stark.
PEPPER
Phil! Come in.
TONY
Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.
PEPPER
Come on in, we're celebrating.
TONY
Which is why he can't stay.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
We need you to look this over.
(he holds out a file towards
STARK)
Soon as possible.
TONY
I don't like being handed things.
PEPPER
That's alright, `cause I love to be
handed things. So, let's trade.
She passes her glass of champagne to Coulson and takes the file
from him, then takes her champagne glass back from Coulson and
passes the file over to Stark.
PEPPER
Thank you.
TONY
Official consulting hours are between
eight and five every other Thursday.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
This isn't a consultation.
PEPPER
Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I
know nothing about.
TONY
The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I
thought. And I didn't even qualify.
PEPPER
I didn't know that either.
TONY
Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-
obsessed, don't play well with others.
PEPPER
That I did know.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
This isn't about personality profiles
anymore.
TONY
Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?
Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own
databases.
TONY
You know, I thought we were having a
moment.
PEPPER
I was having twelve percent of a
moment. This seems serious, Phil's
pretty shaken.
TONY
How did you notice? Why is he Phil?
PEPPER
What is all of this?
TONY
This is, uh...
Tony EXPANDS his arms and different profiles appear in
holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and
Pepper.
TONY
This.
Screens appear of CAPTAIN AMERICA IN ACTION, the HULK ROARING AS
HE ATTACKS THE ARMY AT CULVER UNIVERSITY, THOR FIGHTING THE
DESTROYER and another is of Loki and the Tesseract, to which
Stark and Pepper look on in awe.
PEPPER
I'm going to take the jet to D.C.
tonight.
TONY
Tomorrow.
PEPPER
You've got homework. You've got a lot
of homework.
TONY
Well, what if I didn't?
PEPPER
If you didn't?
TONY
Yeah.
PEPPER
You mean if you finished?
(Stark nods his head)
Well, um...then...
She whispers something in his ear. Tony GASPS. Coulson looks
away in embarrassment.
TONY
Square deal. It's the last date.
Pepper kisses him.
PEPPER
Work hard.
As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in
holograph form, worried.
Inside the QUINJET, Steve is sitting down, holding a TABLET,
watching the footage of the Hulk's attack on the Army at Culver
University.
PILOT
We're about forty minutes out from
base, sir.
Agent Coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to Steve.
STEVE
So, this Doctor Banner was trying to
replicate the serum that was used on
me?
AGENT PHIL COULSON
A lot of people were. You were the
world's first superhero. Banner thought
gamma radiation might hold the key to
unlocking Erskine's original formula.
The Hulk roars with fury as he slams a jeep apart.
STEVE
Didn't really go his way, did it?
AGENT PHIL COULSON
Not so much. When he's not that thing
though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.
Steve looks confused.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
He's like a smart person. I gotta say,
it's an honor to meet you, officially.
Steve smiles at Coulson.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
I sort of met you, I mean, I watched
you while you were sleeping.
Steve looks down. He stands up, closes his laptop and walks to
the side with Coulson following.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
I mean, I was... I was present while
you were unconscious from the ice. You
know, it's really, it's just a... just
a huge honor to have you on board.
STEVE
Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've
made some modifications to the uniform.
I had a little design input.
STEVE
The uniform? Aren't the stars and
stripes a little... old fashioned?
AGENT PHIL COULSON
With everything that's happening, the
things that are about to come to light,
people might just need a little old
fashioned.
Steve takes in Coulson's sentiment.
Several soldiers under Loki's mind control run around, preparing
to infiltrate whatever Loki has planned. Loki sits down,
watching Selvig work with a CMS device. Loki meditates, until...
The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP  a flurry of
activity  dozens of agents sit in front of their VIEWSCREENS.
Agent Hill shouts her instructs to leave. Turns to NICK FURY,
who is at the command chair.
AGENT MARIA HILL
We're at lock, sir.
NICK FURY
Good. Let's vanish.
Steve and Banner walk through the glorious, gleaming bridge,
taking his position at the SCIENCE CONSOLE.
NICK FURY
Gentlemen.
Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement
about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and
extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it.
NICK FURY
Doctor, thank you for coming.
BANNER
Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how
long am I staying?
NICK FURY
Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,
you're in the clear.
BANNER
Where are you with that?
Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha
Romanoff eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
We're sweeping every wirelessly
accessible camera on the planet.
Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected
to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for
us.
NATASHA
That's still not gonna find them in
time.
BANNER
You have to narrow the field. How many
spectrometers do you have access to?
NICK FURY
How many are there?
BANNER
Call every lab you know, tell them to
put the spectrometers on the roof and
calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll
rough out a tracking algorithm based on
cluster recognition. At least we could
rule out a few places. Do you have
somewhere for me to work?
NICK FURY
Agent Romanoff, would you show
Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please.
Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall.
NATASHA
You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all
the toys.
Selvig and several scientists work around the CMS device.
Bartonwalks in, holding a tablet.
SELVIG
Put it over there!
(TO BARTON)
Where did you find all these people?
CLINT BARTON
SHIELD has not shortage of enemies,
Doctor.
He holds up a screen showing information on IRIDIUM.
CLINT BARTON
Is this the stuff you need?
SELVIG
Yeah, iridium. It's found in
meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's
very hard to get hold of.
CLINT BARTON
Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.
SELVIG
Well, I didn't know!
(sees Loki coming)
Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so
much. It's more than just knowledge,
it's... truth.
LOKI
I know. What did it show you, Agent
Barton?
CLINT BARTON
My next target.
LOKI
Tell me what you need.
CLINT BARTON
I'll need a distraction.
(grabs his bow)
And an eyeball.
As they are waiting to locate Loki using satellite facial
recognition, Coulson and Steve stand side by side, waiting.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.
STEVE
No, no. It's fine.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
It's a vintage set. It took me a couple
of years to collect them all. Near
mint, slight foxing around the edges,
but...
AGENT JASPER SITWELL
We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent
match. Weight, cross match, seventy-
nine percent.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
Location?
AGENT JASPER SITWELL
Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse.
He's not exactly hiding.
NICK FURY
Captain, you're up.
Steve nods. Leaves.
Inside, a lavished gala with an orchestra playing, is
interrupted as the HEAD DOCTOR walks up to the mic.
Steve walks into his own locker room. As he approaches to the
steel cabinet, the doors already reveal the updated CAPTAIN
AMERICA UNIFORM, along with the famous SHIELD. He stands in
silence.
Loki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the
HEAD DOCTOR is. As he makes it down and near the stage, he FLIPS
his cane the other end. The guard there notices him, pulls out
his gun, but Loki CLUBS his head in. CHAOS ERUPTS.
Guests begin to leave the museum. Loki grabs the doctor and
flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures
BILCHSTEIM. Loki pulls out an OPTICAL TORTURE DEVICE. He PLUNGES
down the doctor's eye. The doctor TWISTS in pain.
NATASHA
The guy's all over the place.
Suddenly, AC/DC's "Shoot to Thrill" overdrives the QUINJET'S
speakers.
IRON MAN
Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?
Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky. Tony flies over in his
IRON MAN suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. IRON MAN
touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry
the suit has.
IRON MAN
Make your move, Reindeer Games.
Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armor materializes
away.
IRON MAN
Good move.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Mr. Stark.
IRON MAN
Captain.
Natasha watches the skies. THUNDER. Coming out of nowhere. Fury
speaks over her headset.
NICK FURY (V.O.)
Said anything?
NATASHA
Not a word.
NICK FURY (V.O.)
Just get him here. We're low on time.
With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch
from a distance, whispering.
STEVE
I don't like it.
TONY
What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?
STEVE
I don't remember it being ever that
easy. This guy packs a wallop.
TONY
Still, you are pretty spry, for an
older fellow. What's your thing?
Pilates?
STEVE
What?
TONY
It's like calisthenics. You might have
missed a couple things, you know, doing
time as a Capsicle.
Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match.
STEVE
Fury didn't tell me he was calling you
in.
TONY
Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury
doesn't tell you.
THUNDER and LIGHTNING nearly hit the jet, making it shake
violently.
NATASHA
Where's this coming from?
Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Loki stares out the window intently.
STEVE
What's the matter? Scared of a little
lightning?
LOKI
I'm not overly fond of what follows.
What the fuck? OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet.
Not a light. A King.
THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the
throat and flies out. Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck. Tony
puts the IRON MAN helmet on.
IRON MAN
Now there's that guy.
NATASHA
Another Asgardian?
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Think the guy's a friendly?
IRON MAN
Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or
kills him, the Tesseract's lost.
Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after
Thor.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Stark, we need a plan of attack!
IRON MAN
I have a plan. Attack.
IRON MAN jumps out of the jet and chases after Thor. Cap grabs a
parachute to follow.
NATASHA
I'd sit this one out, Cap.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
I don't see how I can.
NATASHA
These guys come from legends, they're
basically gods.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm
pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
Cap JUMPS OUT of the jet.
DOZENS of SHIELD POLICE escort Loki, who is in handcuffs,
smiling. As they pass the HELICARRIER LAB, Banner stops working
on the CHITAURI SCEPTER and looks up. Loki eyes him as he walks,
nodding and smiling. BANNER rubs his head.
Loki is now free from his cuffs and is contained in a LARGE
GLASS CELL held by HYDRAULIC RIGS. Fury walks up the control
panel of the cell.
NICK FURY
In case it's unclear. You try to
escape. You so much as scratch that
glass.
Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's
cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass.
Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit
his pants. Not a god, though.
NICK FURY
Thirty thousand feet, straight down in
a steel trap. You get how that works?!
Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki.
NICK FURY
Ant.
Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel
trap.
NICK FURY
Boot.
LOKI
(SMIRKING)
It's an impressive cage. Not built, I
think, for me.
NICK FURY
Built for something a lot stronger than
you.
LOKI
Oh, I've heard.
Loki looks into the camera.
The others watch on the monitor Loki getting interrogated.
Banner looks at the monitor, intently.
LOKI
The mindless beast, makes play he's
still a man. How desperate are you,
that you call upon such lost creatures
to defend you?
NICK FURY
How desperate am I? You threaten my
world with war. You steal a force you
can't hope to control.
(MORE)
NICK FURY (CONT'D)
You talk about peace and you kill
`cause it's fun. You have made me very
desperate. You might not be glad that
you did.
LOKI
Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To
have the Tesseract, to have power,
unlimited power. And for what? A warm
light for all mankind to share, and
then to be reminded what real power is.
NICK FURY
(SMILING)
Well, you let me know if Real Power
wants a magazine or something.
Fury walks off leaving Loki in his glass cell. Loki looks back
at the camera, smirking.
Steve watches until the monitor goes black. Thor, who didn't
even look, just listened, stands there, torn apart. They all
just stand there in stunned SILENCE. Finally --
BANNER
He really grows on you, doesn't he?
STEVE
Loki's gonna drag this out. So, Thor,
what's his play?
THOR
(COMING TOO)
He has an army called the Chitauri.
They're not of Asgard or any world
known. He means to lead them against
your people. They will win him the
earth. In return, I suspect, for the
Tesseract.
STEVE
(SERIOUSLY)
An army? From outer space?
BANNER
So he's building another portal. That's
what he needs Erik Selvig for.
THOR
Selvig?
BANNER
He's an astrophysicist.
THOR
He's a friend.
NATASHA
Loki has him under some kind of spell,
along with one of ours.
STEVE
I wanna know why Loki let us take him.
He's not leading an army from here.
BANNER
I don't think we should be focusing on
Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of
cats, you could smell crazy on him.
THOR
Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond
reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's
my brother.
NATASHA
He killed eighty people in two days.
THOR
He's adopted.
BANNER
Iridium, what did they need the Iridium
for?
TONY
It's a stabilizing agent.
(walks in with Coulson; to
COULSON)
I'll fly you there. Keep the love
alive. Means the portal won't collapse
on itself, like it did at SHIELD.
TONY (CONT'D)
(TO THOR)
No hard feelings, Point Break. You've
got a mean swing.
(referring to the Iridium)
Also, it means the portal can open as
wide, and stay open as long, as Loki
wants.
(TO CREW)
Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top
sails. That man is playing GALAGA!
Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did.
(covering his eye, looks
AROUND)
How does Fury do this?
AGENT MARIA HILL
He turns.
Tony looks around the monitors and places a BUTTON SIZE HACKING
IMPLANT under Fury's desk, without anyone noticing.
TONY
Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest
of the raw materials, Agent Barton can
get his hands on pretty easily. Only
major component he still needs is a
power source. A high energy density,
something to kick start the cube.
AGENT MARIA HILL
When did you become an expert in
thermonuclear astrophysics?
TONY
Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes,
the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the
only one who did the reading?
STEVE
Does Loki need any particular kind of
power source?
BANNER
He's got to heat the cube to a
hundredand twenty million Kelvin just
to break through the Coulomb barrier.
TONY
Unless, Selvig has figured out how to
stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.
BANNER
Well, if he could do that he could
achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor
on the planet.
TONY
Finally, someone who speaks English.
STEVE
Is that what just happened?
Tony and Banner shake hands. A glimmer in their eyes shines as
the mutual respect for each other shows.
TONY
It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.
You're work on anti-electron collisions
is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of
the way you lose control and turn into
an enormous green rage monster.
BANNER
(LOOKS DOWN)
Thanks.
NICK FURY
(WALKING IN)
Dr. Banner is only here to track the
cube. I was hoping you might join him.
STEVE
Let's start with that stick of his. It
may be magical, but it works an awful
lot like a HYDRA weapon.
NICK FURY
I don't know about that, but it is
powered by the cube. And I'd like to
know how Loki used it to turn two of
the sharpest men I know into his
personal flying monkeys.
THOR
Monkeys? I do not understand.
STEVE
I do! I understood that reference.
Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself.
TONY
Shall we play, doctor?
BANNER
Let's play some.
As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so
discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to
playing.
Banner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on
the scepter for radiation.
Tony looks at his monitors, shifting and solving as many
algorithms and equations.
BANNER
The gamma readings are definitely
consistent with Selvig's reports on the
Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to
process.
TONY
If we bypass their mainframe and direct
a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can
clock this around six hundred
teraflops.
BANNER
All I packed was a tooth brush.
TONY
(SMILES)
You know, you should come by STARK
TOWERS sometime. Top ten floors, all
R&D.; You'd love it, it's candy land.
BANNER
Thanks, but the last time I was in New
York I kind of broke...Harlem.
TONY
Well, I promise a stress free
environment. No tension. No surprises.
Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD.
Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony.
BANNER
OW!
Tony looks at Banner closely.
TONY
Nothing?
STEVE
(TO BANNER)
Hey! Are you nuts?
TONY
You really have got a lid on it,
haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow
jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?
STEVE
Is everything a joke to you?
TONY
Funny things are.
STEVE
Threatening the safety of everyone on
this ship isn't funny. No offense,
doctor.
BANNER
No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come
aboard if I couldn't handle pointy
things.
TONY
You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to
strut.
STEVE
And you need to focus on the problem,
Mr. Stark.
TONY
You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us
and why now? Why not before? What isn't
he telling us? I can't do the equation
unless I have all the variables.
STEVE
You think Fury's hiding something?
TONY
He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His
secrets have secrets.
(points to Banner)
It's bugging him too, isn't it?
BANNER
(bobbling the words)
Uh...I just wanna finish my work here
and...
STEVE
Doctor?
A beat.
BANNER
'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's
jab at Fury about the cube.
STEVE
I heard it.
BANNER
(pointing at Tony)
Well, I think that was meant for you.
Even if Barton didn't post that all
over the news.
STEVE
The Stark Tower? That big ugly
(Tony gives him a look)
...building in New York?
BANNER
It's powered by Stark Reactors, self-
sustaining energy source. That building
will run itself for what, a year?
TONY
That's just the prototype. I'm kind of
the only name in clean energy right
now.
BANNER
(referring to Tony)
So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on
the Tesseract project? I mean, what are
they doing in the energy business in
the first place?
TONY
I should probably look into that once
my decryption programmer finishes
breaking into all of SHIELD's secure
files.
STEVE
(taken by that)
I'm sorry, did you say...?
TONY
Jarvis has been running it since I hit
the bridge. In a few hours we'll know
every dirty secret SHIELD has ever
tried to hide.
(holds out a bag of blueberries)
Blueberry?
STEVE
Yet you're confused about why they
didn't want you around?
TONY
An intelligence organization that fears
intelligence? Historically, not
possible.
STEVE
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.
This is a man who means to start a war,
and if don't stay focused, he'll
succeed. We have orders, we should
follow them.
TONY
Following is not really my style.
STEVE
(SMILING)
And you're all about style, aren't you?
TONY
(a nerve hit)
Of the people in this room, which one
is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B.
not of use?
BANNER
Steve, tell me none of this smells a
little funky to you?
Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier,
shakes it off.
STEVE
Just find the cube.
Steve walks out of the lab. Still torn apart by the possibility,
he walks away, towards the HULL of the ship.
BACK IN THE LAB
TONY
That's the guy my dad never shut up
about? Wondering if they shouldn't have
kept him on ice.
BANNER
The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does
have the jump on us.
TONY
What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit.
TONY (CONT'D)
It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm
gonna be there when it does.
BANNER
And I'll read all about it.
TONY
Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like
the rest of us.
BANNER
Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor.
I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a
nightmare.
TONY
You know, I've got a cluster of
shrapnel, trying every second to crawl
its way into my heart.
(points at the MINI-ARC
REACTOR in his chest)
This stops it. This little circle of
light. It's part of me now, not just
armor. It's a... terrible privilege.
BANNER
But you can control it.
TONY
Because I learned how.
BANNER
It's different.
Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the
data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face.
TONY
Hey, I've read all about your accident.
That much gamma exposure should have
killed you.
BANNER
So you're saying that the Hulk... the
other guy... saved my life?
(MORE)
BANNER (CONT'D)
That's nice. It's a nice sentiment.
Saved it for what?
TONY
(A BEAT)
I guess we'll find out.
Banner and Stark get back to work at their respective computers.
BANNER
You might not like that.
TONY
You just might.
Steve, with all his MIGHT, slides the HEAVY IRON door and
STEALTHILY walks in. SECURE STORAGE 10-C is a large warehouse,
filled with METAL CRATES stacked.
Steve looks up, seeing another level. He LEAPS up high and holds
onto the catwalk railing. Steve continues to move forward.
Inside this particular van, Selvig and a few other SOLDIERS are
driving inside a long tunnel. With the CMS device inside, Selvig
carefully picks up the small cylinder shape IRIDIUM with metal
prongs and lightly places it a SLOT within the CMS. THE CMS
ACCEPTS IT. Selvig looks at it, devilishly smiling.
On a SHIELD monitor is a photo and record of JANE FOSTER. Thor
looks at her, remembering. With him is Agent Coulson.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
As soon as Loki took the doctor we
moved Jane Foster. We've got an
excellent observatory in Traunsee. She
was asked to consult there very
suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee,
private plane, very remote. She'll be
safe.
THOR
Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking
Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for
him once he's done. Erik is a good man.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
He talks about you a lot. You changed
his life. You changed everything around
here.
THOR
They were better as they were. We
pretend on Asgard that we're more
advanced, but we...we come here
battling like BILCHSTEIM.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
Like what?
THOR
BILCHSTEIM? You know; huge, scaly, big
antlers. You don't have those?
AGENT PHIL COULSON
Don't think so.
THOR
They are repulsive, and they trample
everything in their path.
Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the
window, lamenting about what has happened and what may come.
THOR
When I first came to earth, Loki's rage
followed me here and your people paid
the price. And now again. In my youth I
courted war.
NICK FURY (O.S.)
War hasn't started yet.
(WALKING IN)
You think you can make Loki tell us
what the Tesseract is?
THOR
I do not know. Loki's mind is far
afield, it's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain
that would prize his need from him.
NICK FURY
A lot of guys think that, until the
pain stops.
THOR
What are you asking me to do?
NICK FURY
I'm asking. What are you prepared to
do?
THOR
Loki is a prisoner.
NICK FURY
Then why do I feel like he's the only
person on this boat that wants to be
here?
Thor doesn't answer.
Loki walks back and forth inside his glass cell. Suddenly, he
stops.
LOKI
There's not many people that can sneak
up on me.
(turns to see NATASHA
STANDING THERE)
NATASHA
But you figured I'd come.
LOKI
After. After whatever tortures Fury can
concoct, you would appear as a friend,
as a balm. And I would cooperate.
NATASHA
I wanna know what you've done to Agent
Barton.
LOKI
I'd say I've expanded his mind.
NATASHA
And once you've won. Once you're king
of the mountain. What happens to his
mind?
LOKI
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?
NATASHA
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.
LOKI
(SITTING DOWN)
Tell me.
NATASHA
(she pulls up a chair as
WELL)
Before I worked for SHIELD, I
uh...well, I made a name for myself. I
have a very specific skillset. I didn't
care who I used it for, or on. I got on
SHIELD's radar in a bad way. Agent
Barton was sent to kill me, he made a
different call.
LOKI
And what will you do if I vow to spare
him?
NATASHA
Not let you out.
LOKI
(LAUGHS)
Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in
the balance, and you bargain for one
man?
NATASHA
Regimes fall every day. I tend not to
weep over that, I'm Russian... or was.
LOKI
What is it you want?
NATASHA
It's really not that complicated. I've
got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe
it out.
LOKI
Can you? Can you wipe out that much
red? DRAKOV'S daughter? SO PAULO? THE
HOSPITAL FIRE? Barton told me
everything. Your ledger is dripping,
it's gushing red, and you think saving
a man no more virtuous than yourself
will change anything?
(STANDING; ANGRY)
This is the basest sentimentality. This
is a child at prayer... PATHETIC!
INTERCUTS
- Tony and Banner continuously work at their monitors.
LOKI (V.O.)
You lie and kill in the service of
liars and killers.
- Agent Hill checks every VIEWSCREEN in the bridge. Fury
oversees.
LOKI (V.O.)
You pretend to be separate, to have
your own code, something that makes up
for the horrors. But they are a part of
you, and they will never go away!
- Steve opens a STEEL crate. Angry, he looks behind him and
looks back into the crate. THE CRATE IS FILLED WITH AN ARRAY OF
HYDRA WEAPONS.
Loki SLAMS his cell, making Natasha FLINCH.
LOKI
I won't touch Barton. Not until I make
him kill you! Slowly. Intimately. In
every way he knows you fear! And when
he'll wake just long enough to see his
good work, and when he screams, I'll
split his skull! This is my bargain,
you mewling quim!
NATASHA turns around, walks away from Loki, disgusted.
NATASHA
(QUIETLY; DISTRAUGHT)
You're a monster.
LOKI
(LAUGHS)
No, you brought the monster.
NATASHA
(turns back around; poised)
So, Banner... that's your play.
LOKI
(STAGGERED)
What?
NATASHA
(ON EARPIECE)
Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep
Banner in the lab, I'm on my way. Send
Thor as well.
(TO LOKI)
Thank you for your cooperation.
Natasha quickly walks out, leaving Loki frozen.
Fury walks in SURPRISED to see Tony and Banner stop working on
the scepter.
NICK FURY
(ANGRY)
What are you doing, Mr. Stark?
TONY
Uh...kind of been wondering the same
thing about you.
NICK FURY
You're supposed to be locating the
Tesseract.
BANNER
We are. The model's locked and we're
sweeping for the signature now. When we
get a hit, we'll have the location
within half a mile.
TONY
And you'll get your cube back, no muss,
no fuss.
(suddenly his monitor show a
collection of SECRET FILES)
What is PHASE 2?
Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing
Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed.
STEVE
PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make
weapons.
(TO TONY)
Sorry, the computer was moving a little
slow.
NICK FURY
(trying to explain)
Rogers, we gathered everything related
to the Tesseract. This does not mean
that we're...
TONY
I'm sorry, Nick.
Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of
THE WEAPONS.
TONY
What were you lying?
STEVE
I was wrong, director. The world hasn't
changed a bit.
At that moment, Thor and Natasha walk into the lab. Natasha
keeps her eyes right on Banner. Banner looks at her, PISSED.
BANNER
Did you know about this?
NATASHA
You wanna think about removing yourself
from this environment, doctor?
BANNER
I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well
removed.
NATASHA
Loki's manipulating you.
BANNER
And you've been doing what exactly?
NATASHA
You didn't come here because I bat my
eyelashes at you.
BANNER
Yes, and I'm not leaving because
suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd
like to know why SHIELD is using the
Tesseract to build weapons of mass
destruction.
NICK FURY
Because of him.
(pointing at Thor)
THOR
(STUNNED)
Me?
NICK FURY
Last year earth had a visitor from
another planet who had a grudge match
that leveled a small town. We learned
that not only are we not alone, but we
are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.
THOR
My people want nothing but peace with
your planet.
NICK FURY
But you're not the only people out
there, are you? And, you're not the
only threat. The world's filling up
with people who can't be matched, they
can't be controlled.
STEVE
Like you controlled the cube?
THOR
You're work with the Tesseract is what
drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is
the signal to all the realms that the
earth is ready for a higher form of
war.
STEVE
A higher form?
NICK FURY
You forced our hand. We had to come up
with something.
TONY
Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always
calms everything right down.
NICK FURY
Remind me again how you made your
fortune, Stark?
STEVE TONY
I'm sure if he still made Wait! Wait! Hold on! How is
weapons, Stark would be neck this now about me?
deep... I'm sorry, isn't THOR
everything?
I thought humans were more
evolved than this.
NICK FURY
Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet
and blow stuff up?
THOR
Did you always give your champions such
mistrust?
NATASHA BANNER
Are you all really that Captain America is on
naive? S.H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threat potential
threats? watch list?
TONY STEVE
(to Steve) I swear to God, Stark, one
You're on that list? Are you more crack...
above or below angry bees?
Threatening! I feel
threatened!
As the "team" argues, they don't realize the BLUE GEM on Loki's
scepter is glowing brightly.
Outside the HELICARRIER, a lone carrier slowly hovers over the
ship.
SHIELD BASE VOICE
661 Bravo, please relay your pass code.
What is your hull, over?
BARTON
Arms to ammunition, over.
Inside, BARTON and his crew suit up and arm themselves. Barton
pulls out his hi-tech bow and arrows.
Back in the lab, the egos of these people keeping rubbing off
each other and at any moment, the shit will hit the fan.
THOR
You speak of control, yet you court
chaos.
BANNER
It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what
are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a
chemical mixture that makes chaos.
We're... we're a time-bomb.
NICK FURY
You need to step away.
TONY
(puts his arm around Steve)
Why shouldn't the guy let off a little
steam?
STEVE
(pushes Tony off)
You know damn well why! Back off!
TONY
(comes face-to-face with Cap)
Oh, I'm starting to want you to make
me.
STEVE
Big man in a suit of armor. Take that
off, what are you?
TONY
Genius, billionaire, playboy,
philanthropist.
STEVE
I know guys with none of that worth ten
of you. Yeah, I've seen the footage.
(MORE)
STEVE (CONT'D)
The only thing you really fight for is
yourself. You're not the guy to make
the sacrifice play, to lay down on a
wire and let the other guy crawl over
you.
TONY
I think I would just cut the wire.
STEVE
(SMILING)
Always a way out... You know, you may
not be a threat, but you better stop
pretending to be a hero.
TONY
(that did it)
A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat,
Rogers. Everything special about you
came out of a bottle!
OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
The ramp of the carrier opens. The carrier maneuvers next to one
of the large turbine engines. Barton stands at the base, holding
out his bow. He pulls out a GRENADE TIPPED ARROW. He points
right at the engine.
Then...Barton moves his AIM and points the arrow about a hundred
feet from the engine. He releases. The arrow flies out,but then
SHARPLY heads for the engine. The arrow is punctured onto the
engine. It has a visible timer which is COUNTING DOWN.
Back in the lab, Steve puffs up his chest at Tony, who just
stands there, unmoving.
STEVE
Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds.
Thor laughs at them.
THOR
You people are so petty... and tiny.
Tony rubs his head. Moves away from Cap.
BANNER
Yeah, this is a tee...
NICK FURY
Agent Romanoff, would you escort
Dr.Banner back to his...
BANNER
Where? You rented my room.
NICK FURY
The cell was just in case...
BANNER
In case you needed to kill me, but you
can't! I know! I tried!
(A BEAT)
I got low. I didn't see an end, so I
put a bullet in my mouth and the other
guy spit it out! So I moved on. I
focused on helping other people. I was
good, until you dragged me back into
this freak show and put everyone here
at risk!
Banner slowly gets upset as he looks at Romanoff, who gets
unnerved.
BANNER
You wanna know my secret, Agent
Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay
calm?
BLACK WIDOW and Fury have their hands down to grab their guns.
STEVE
Doctor Banner... put down the scepter.
BANNER LOOKS DOWN AND IS SHOCKED TO SEE HE'S HOLDING LOKI'S
SCEPTER. The computer beeps. They all turn to it.
TONY
Got it.
Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer.
BANNER
Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my
little party trick after all.
THOR
Located the Tesseract?
TONY
I can get there faster.
STEVE
Look, all of us...
THOR
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no
human is a match for it.
Tony turns to leave, but Steve stops him.
STEVE
You're not going alone!
TONY
You gonna stop me?
STEVE
Put on the suit, let's find out.
TONY
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.
STEVE
Put on the suit.
At that moment Banner who's looking at the monitor notices
something about the Tesseract.
BANNER
Oh, my God!
OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
Barton PULLS THE TRIGGER ON HIS BOW. The arrow then EXPLODES THE
ENGINE RIGHT OFF THE HELICARRIER!
Everyone is thrown in every direction. Steve, Fury, Thor and
Tony are thrown across while Natasha and Banner is down in the
lower equipment room. Steve looks up at Tony.
STEVE
Put on the suit!
TONY
Yep!
Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab. Fury sits up, clutching
his ribs. He puts on his EARPIECE.
NICK FURY
Hill?!
PANDEMONIUM ERUPTS. Emergency alarms set off, fire extinguishers
activate near surrounding fires and every agent is in a spinning
scramble for their positions and armaments. Agent Hill keeps the
bridge as calm as possible.
AGENT MARIA HILL
Turn up that engine! Number 3 engine is
down! Can we get a run in?
(runs over to GALAGA PLAYER)
Talk to me.
GALAGA PLAYER
(points to monitor)
Turbine's loose. Mostly intact, but
it's impossible to get out there and
make repairs while we're in the air.
AGENT MARIA HILL
We lose one more engine, we won't be.
Somebody's got to get inside and patch
that engine.
NICK FURY
Stark! You copy that?!
TONY (V.O.)
I'm on it!
NICK FURY
Coulson! Initiate official lock down in
the detention section then get to the
armory! Move out!
Agent Coulson runs out of the bridge.
Natasha looks over to Banner, who is breathing heavy, having
landed hard. He is gripping the grated floor to maintain
control, but his eyes are green, his face intense.
NATASHA (CONT'D)
(quietly, to herself)
I'm okay. We're okay, right?
ON BANNER'S FACE in the dim light as he struggles to suppress
the rage, but his face is growing, changing slowly.
Natasha is pulling herself painfully free, talking to Banner...
NATASHA
Doctor... Bruce, you gotta fight it.
This is just what Loki wants. We're
gonna be okay. Listen to me.
Two approaching SHIELD soldiers arrive to check on her. She
furiously WAVES them away. They bolt out of there.
NATASHA
We're gonna be okay. Right? I swear on
my life I will get you out of this, you
will walk away, and never...
BANNER
Your life?
His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is
morphing to a growled threat. Another explosion rocks the
carrier -- and he turns to look at her, transforming just as the
lights go out.
NATASHA
(PLEADING)
Bruce.
Banner suddenly starts transforming into the HULK and gives
Natasha one last knowing look. Natasha STRUGGLES FREE of the
rubble. She stops.
The HULK, sensing her, turns his head and puts on a face of a
disturb monster. Natasha JOLTS up the stairs with the HULK
chasing after her. Natasha maneuvers like a black widow should.
She rolls under a turbine, starts to crawl within the maze of
pipes. The HULK pulls them out from above the catwalk.
Natasha falls through under the catwalks and quickly and
stealthily escapes. The HULK lets out a ROAR OF RAGE unlike
anything. PRIMAL. Not human.
Loki looks up, smiling mischievously.
Fury RUNS in and sees the chaos has increased even more than
before. The HELMSMAN is in complete disarray.
NICK FURY
Bring the carrier inwards and head
south. Take us to the water.
HELMSMAN
Why water? Navigations recalibrated
after the engine failure.
NICK FURY
Is the sun coming up?!
HELMSMAN
Yes, sir.
NICK FURY
Then put it on the left! Get us over
water! One more turbine goes down and
we drop.
Natasha continuously crawls under the catwalk. She stops.
Then...BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. The room vibrates. Rhythmically.
Natasha pulls out her gun and slowly walks out onto the catwalk
and spins.
...and then a ROAR. THE HULK. Natasha FIRES a shot into a liquid
nitrogen pipe that hits the hulk in face. The HULK SMASHES THE
SHIT OUT OF IT. Natasha begins to run through the maze of
corridors. The sound the monster is coming.
Finally, she reaches and a long corridor. As she runs, behind
her, the HULK TEARS up the hallway, coming at her.
Natasha turns to see, but the HULK SLAPS her into the wall,
SMASHING INTO THE GROUND.
The HULK marks his territory. Natasha looks up. A fear she has
never felt begins to seep out. The HULK raises his hand and IS
KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET BY THOR WHO TACKLES HIM INTO the next room.
Both Thor and HULK roll across the floor. Every person runs the
hell out. Thor looks up at this magnificent beast. The HULK
stands up and moving like a boxer, wants Thor to make his move.
The HULK makes his move.
SWING AND A MISS. Thor swings his massive hand and almost knocks
HULK off his feet. HULK keeps swinging and missing, pissing him
off. Finally, he brings down his arm, but Thor grabs it and
wraps around it.
THOR
We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to
think!
HULK lifts his arm up, to Thor's surprise, and he SENDS HIM
FLYING AS HE PUNCHES THOR'S FACE WITH HIS FIST.
Thor CRASHES into another stack of crates. As he raises his
head, he feels something on his lips. BLOOD. As he swipes it
off, the ROAR of the HULK is not too far. Thor extends his hand
out.
The ROAR gets LOUDER and CLOSER. Thor focuses. His hand strains
toward mid-air. His eyes tight in concentration. The HULK runs
right at him. At the last second, MJLNIR flies into his hand
and Thor UPPERCUTS HULK, WHO CRASHES INTO A FIGHTER JET.
HULK stands up, shaking his head like `what the fuck just
happened.' He SHAKES it off and ANGRILY rips off the TAIL of the
jet, TORQUES HIS BODY LIKE A GREEK DISCUS THROWER AND... HURLS
THE MASSIVE PLATE AT THOR.
Thor SLIDES and DUCKS under the tail. Jumping up, he throws
Mjlnir with all his strength, knocking the HULK head over
heels. HULK falls down, hammer in hand. HE tries to lift it, but
can't. Mjlnir rests atop his hand.
Struggle as he may, HULK wraps his hand around the hammer. The
hammer doesn't move. To no avail -- he strains with all his
might, SCREAMS from the effort, BELLOWING.
Thor jumps up again, KNEEING HULK in the face. Thor grabs his
hammer, jumps on him, using the hammer as a lock for his
CHOKEHOLD. Hulk tries to pull him off.
Fury and Agent Hill look over their monitors.
NICK FURY
We need a full evac on the lower hangar
bay.
Agent Hill nods. She leaves to exit out, but a SLIDING GRENADE
appears.
AGENT MARIA HILL
GRENADE!
The grenade goes off, sending her down the steps. Fury FIRES a
shot at the open entrance. He moves over behind the side of the
entrance. A handful of Barton's men enter. Watchful, ready,
waiting... Fury steps out, his GUN drawn.
A SHOOT OUT and HAND-TO-HAND ensues, but Fury is unable to stop
one of them, which is why he is shot in the head by Agent Hill,
who looks hot and sexy holding her gun.
Agent Coulson walks up the armory door. He places his head into
a FACIAL RECOGNITION SCANNER. Walks into the room.
AGENT JASPER SITWELL (V.O.)
We got perimeter breach! Hostiles are
in SHIELD gear. Hold on to every
junction.
HULK CRASHES from under the floor, sending Thor on his ass. HULK
grabs him by the neck.
A gunfight opens up. AGENTS exchange fire with brutally
efficient tactical soldiers.
AGENT JASPER SITWELL (V.O.)
Sir, the HULK and Thor are in shuttle
levels 2, 3 and 4!
AGENT MARIA HILL
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place
apart!
NICK FURY
Get his attention.
AGENT MARIA HILL
(on her EARPIECE)
Escort 606, proceed to 270 MAIN
SHUTTLE! Don't get too close.
ESCORT 606 PILOT (V.O.)
Copy.
The gunfight has gone down, but more of Barton's men enter and
are taken by Fury, who is confused as to why they keep coming.
NICK FURY
They are not getting through here, so
what the hell...
Suddenly, Barton LOOSES an arrow down to the bridge and EXPLODES
critical spots. Barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards
Fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a USB
OUTLETS.
Fury FIRES at Barton, but is already gone. The arrow then self-
activates and inserts itself into the outlets, hacking every
single monitor and main frame. The hacking causes Engine 1 to
shut off. Suddenly, the HELICARRIER begins to DANGEROUSLY TILT
to one side.
AGENT JASPER SITWELL (O.S.)
Sir, we've lost all power in Engine 1.
NICK FURY
It's Barton. He took out our systems.
He's headed for the detention level.
Does anybody copy?
Still shaken by the HULK ordeal, Natasha sits there, rocking
back and forth, after crying for a while. Summoning back all her
coolness, she touches her EARPIECE.
NATASHA
This is Agent Romanoff. I copy.
Natasha SPRINGS up and runs for Barton.
Thor runs into the detention section where he finds Loki,
escaping.
THOR
NO!
Thor CHARGES at his brother. Loki walks up to him and CROUCHES
down to attack. THOR ONLY GOES THROUGH HIM. The false Loki
dissipates into nothingness. THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind
the cell door, which closes on THOR, locking him up. Loki
smiles.
LOKI
Are you ever not going to fall for
that?
Barton walks alone down the catwalk. In a lightning fast move,
Barton nocks an arrow, and points it at NATASHA. A hand-to-hand
fight ensues. Natasha CRAWLS her way around Barton, making
Barton to drop his bow, but pulls out a KNIFE on her.
Thor, in a fit of anger, SLAMS MJLNIR onto the glass cell. To
his surprise, the cell door only CRACKS, but violently SHAKES
the ship. Loki stands there in caution, as does his GUARDING
SOLDIER.
LOKI
(smiles; walks over to the
CONTROL PANEL)
The humans think us immortal. Should we
test that?
Suddenly, GUARDING SOLDIER falls down like a tree. AGENT COULSON
stands there, holding PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
Move away, please.
Loki moves away from the switch.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
You like this? We started working on
the prototype after you sent THE
DESTROYER. Even I don't know what it
does. Do you wanna find out?
A LOUD GASP. AGENT COULSON IS IMPALED THROUGH THE HEART. THE
REAL LOKI STANDS BEHIND COULSON.
THOR
Nooo!
Loki sends Agent Coulson against the wall. Agent Coulson slumps
down, breathing fast. Loki makes his way to the control switch.
He gives his brother one last look. Thor looks at him, hopeful.
Loki opens the HATCH. Thor still hopes. LOKI HITS THE BUTTON AND
DROPS THOR OUT OF THE SHIP.
Barton and Natasha continue attacking each other. Natasha
KICKBOXES Barton's face. Feeling that, Barton takes a SWING at
her, but she grabs his arm, TWISTING it. BARTON WRITHES IN PAIN.
Using his other arm, he tosses the knife over and begins to
SLASH at Natasha. She dodges every move, but finds herself in a
LOCK HOLD with him. As he forces the knife down, she BITES his
wrist. Barton lets go of the knife.
Natasha WRAPS her legs around his neck, FLIPS him over and arm
LOCKS him. She SLAMS his head into a pipes rail. Barton goes
down, hard. He looks up her, almost coming to his real senses.
BARTON
Natasha...
Natasha COLDCOCKS him. Barton is out.
Loki has no remorse as he looks down. He closes the hatch and
proceeds to leave. A WEAK VOICE.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
You're gonna lose.
LOKI
(TURNING)
Am I?
AGENT PHIL COULSON
It's in your nature.
LOKI
Your heroes are scattered, your
floating fortress falls from the
sky...where is my disadvantage?
AGENT PHIL COULSON
You lack conviction.
LOKI
I don't think I...
AGENT COULSON SHOOTS LOKI WITH HIS PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE,
CAUSING LOKI TO BE BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL BEHIND HIM.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
So that's what it does.
Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN that the hatch
has been open. Knowing Agent Coulson was sent there, he goes to.
Fury runs in finding Agent Coulson still alive, barely.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
Sorry, boss. They got rabbited.
NICK FURY
Just stay awake. EYES ON ME!
AGENT PHIL COULSON
No. I'm clocked out here.
NICK FURY
Not an option.
AGENT PHIL COULSON
It's okay, boss. This was never going
to work... if they didn't have
something... to...
Agent Coulson looks away. Sighs his last breath. Nick Fury looks
on grimly at Coulson. The medical team arrives.
NICK FURY (V.O.)
Agent Coulson is down.
Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on
her headset, standing up.
SHIELD AGENT (V.O.)
Paramedics are on their way.
NICK FURY (V.O.)
They're here.
Steve and Tony listen in as well.
NICK FURY (V.O.)
They called it.
Fury gathers Tony and Steve back into the briefing room everyone
there has a look as if in a daze. A look of numb shock is shown
on their devastated faces.
NICK FURY
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.
Guess he never did get you to sign
them.
Fury throws Coulson's CAPTAIN AMERICA TRADING CARDS on the table
towards Steve. Steve picks them up, STAINED WITH BLOOD.
NICK FURY
We're dead in the air up here. Our
communications, location of the cube,
Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you.
Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that
coming.
(A BEAT)
Yes, we were going to build an arsenal
with the Tesseract. I never put all my
chips on that number though, because I
was playing something even riskier.
There was an idea, Stark knows this,
called THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE. The
idea was to bring together a group of
remarkable people, see if they could
become something more. See if they
could work together when we needed them
to, to fight the battles that we never
could. Phil Coulson died still
believing in that idea, in heroes.
Tony gets up and walks off, not wanting to hear it anymore.
NICK FURY
Well, it's an old fashioned notion.
Banner wakes up, in human form. He looks around and sees he is
IN A PILE OF RUBBLE and looks up at the OPEN CEILING HE CRASHED
IN. AND IS COMPLETELY NAKED. A SECURITY GUARD stands there,
amazed.
SECURITY GUARD
You fell out of the sky.
BANNER
(COMING TO)
Did I hurt anybody?
SECURITY GUARD
There's nobody around here to get hurt.
You did scare the hell out of some
pigeons though.
BANNER
Lucky.
SECURITY GUARD
Or just good aim. You were awake when
you fell.
BANNER
You saw?
SECURITY GUARD
The whole thing, right through the
ceiling. Big and green and buck ass
nude. Here...
He throws Banner a pair of big pants. Banner pulls on his pants.
SECURITY GUARD
I didn't think those would fit you
until you shrunk down to a regular size
fella.
BANNER
Thank you.
A beat.
SECURITY GUARD
Are you an alien?
BANNER
What?
SECURITY GUARD
From outer space, an alien?
BANNER
No.
SECURITY GUARD
Well then, son, you've got a condition.
Barton is strapped down. Natasha watches over him as Barton
tries to shake off Loki's mind control.
NATASHA
Clint, you're gonna be alright.
CLINT BARTON
You know that? Is that what you know? I
got...I gotta go in though. I gotta
flush him out.
NATASHA
We don't have that long, it's gonna
take time.
CLINT BARTON
I don't understand. Have you ever had
someone take your brain and play? Pull
you out and send something else in? Do
you know what it's like to be unmade?
NATASHA
You know that I do.
CLINT BARTON
Why am I back? How did you get him out?
NATASHA
Cognitive recalibration. I hit you
really hard in the head.
CLINT BARTON
Thanks.
(Natasha unfastens the
RESTRAINTS)
Tasha, how many agents?
NATASHA
Don't. Don't do that to yourself,
Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters
and magic and nothing we were ever
trained for.
CLINT BARTON
Loki, he got away?
NATASHA
Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?
CLINT BARTON
I didn't need to know. I didn't ask.
He's gonna make his play soon though.
Today.
NATASHA
We gotta stop him.
CLINT BARTON
Yeah? Who's we?
NATASHA
I don't know. Whoever's left.
CLINT BARTON
Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's
eyesocket, I'd sleep better I suppose.
NATASHA
Now you sound like you.
Natasha sits next to her partner and friend.
CLINT BARTON
But you don't. You're a spy, not a
soldier. Now you want to wade into a
war. Why? What did Loki do to you?
NATASHA
He didn't, I just...
(SHE PAUSES)
CLINT BARTON
Natasha.
NATASHA
I've been compromised. I got red in my
ledger. I'd like to wipe it out.
Tony look at the empty cell container. He stands not saying a
word. Steve walks in.
STEVE
Was he married?
TONY
No. There was a uh...cellist, I think.
STEVE
I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.
TONY
He was an idiot.
STEVE
Why? For believing?
TONY
For taking on Loki alone.
STEVE
He was doing his job.
TONY
He was out of his league. He should
have waited. He should have...
STEVE
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.
TONY
(WALKS AWAY)
Right. How did that work for him?
STEVE
Is this the first time you've lost a
soldier?
TONY
(turns around sharply)
WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching
to Fury's fife!
STEVE
Neither am I! He's got the same blood
on his hands as Loki does. Right now
we've got to put that aside and get
this done. Now Loki needs a power
source, if we can put together a
list...
TONY
(looking at the blood stained
WALL)
He made it personal.
STEVE
That's not the point.
TONY
That is the point. That's Loki's point.
He hit us all right where we live. Why?
STEVE
To tear us apart.
TONY
He had to conquer his greed, but he
knows he has to take us out to win,
right? That's what he wants. He wants
to beat us and he wants to be seen
doing it. He wants an audience.
STEVE
Right, I caught his act at Stuttengard.
TONY
Yeah. That's just a preview, this is
opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva.
He wants flowers, he wants parades, he
wants a monument built in the skies
with his name plastered...
(PAUSE)
Sonofabitch!
Steve walks in full uniform. Natasha looks at him, unprepared.
STEVE
Time to go.
NATASHA
Go where?
STEVE
I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly
one of those jets?
Barton walks out of the restroom. Looks at Cap.
CLINT BARTON
I can.
Steve looks at Natasha and she nods her head to confirm Barton's
on their side.
STEVE
You got a suit?
CLINT BARTON
Yeah.
STEVE
Then suit up.
MONTAGE
- KRAKAKABOOM! A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from
above, colliding on MJLNIR. The explosion is massive. THE
MIGHTY THOR.
- CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls on his HELMET and SHIELD.
- Tony WELDS his IRON MAN helmet. LIGHT slips down over IRON
MAN's eye holes.
- BLACK WIDOW attaches a GLOVE GAUNTLET with her rounds on her
wrist. A BLUE LIGHT CHARGES.
- HAWKEYE slips on his QUIVER of arrows.
Cap, Widow and Hawkeye walk towards and into the QUINJET. A
YOUNG SHIELD PILOT looks and stands in their way.
YOUNG SHIELD PILOT
You are not authorized to be here...
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Son... just don't.
Fury looks the window of the ship, contemplating. Agent Hill
walks up to him, knowing.
AGENT MARIA HILL
Sir.
NICK FURY
Agent Hill?
AGENT MARIA HILL
Those cards, they were in Coulson's
locker, not in his jacket.
NICK FURY
They needed the push.
(holding Coulson's cards)
A LOUD NOISE SCREECHES. Fury looks out to see IRON MAN flying
off as well as the QUINJET.
NICK FURY
They found it. Get our communications
back up, whatever you have to do. I
want eyes on everything.
AGENT MARIA HILL
Yes, sir.
Loki walks in, holding the scepter. Tony casually walks down the
steps, towards the bar.
LOKI
Please tell me you're going to appeal
to my humanity.
TONY
Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten
you.
LOKI
You should have left your armor on for
that.
TONY
Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage.
You've got the blue stick of destiny.
Would you like a drink?
LOKI
Stalling me won't change anything.
TONY
No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You
sure? I'm having one.
LOKI
The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will
change that. What have I to fear?
TONY
THE AVENGERS.
(Loki looks at him, confused)
It's what we call ourselves, sort of
like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES'
type of thing.
LOKI
Yes, I've met them.
TONY
(SMILING)
Yeah, takes us a while to get any
traction, I'll give you that one.
TONY (CONT'D)
But, let's do a head count here. Your
brother, the demi-God; a super soldier,
a living legend who kind of lives up to
the legend; a man with breath-taking
anger management issues; a couple of
master assassins, and you, big fella,
you've managed to piss off every single
one of them.
LOKI
That was the plan.
TONY
Not a great plan. When they come, and
they will, they'll come for you.
From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE
BRACELETS, a honing device.
LOKI
I have an army.
TONY
We have a HULK.
LOKI
I thought the beast had wandered off.
TONY
You're missing the point. There's no
throne, there is no version of this,
where you come out on top. Maybe your
army comes and maybe it's too much for
us, but it's all on you. Because if we
can't protect the Earth, you can be
damned well sure we'll avenge it.
LOKI
(slowly walks up to him;
raising the scepter)
How will your friends have time for
me,when they're so busy fighting you?
Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing.
Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING.
LOKI
It should work.
TONY
Well, performance issues. You know?
In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across
the room.
TONY
Jarvis. Anytime now.
Loki grabs Tony by the throat again.
LOKI
You will all fall before me.
LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower.
From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out.
The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD
begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit.
It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits
the ground or the gazing people. Loki looks up, angry.
IRON MAN
And there's one other person you pissed
off! His name was Phil.
Loki raises the scepter. IRON MAN FIRES at Loki, sending him on
his ass.
HAWKEYE looks out to his left window, finding a target.
HAWKEYE
Yeah.
BLACK WIDOW
See them.
HAWKEYE BANKS the jet towards STARK TOWER. Aims the MINIGUN at
Loki. Loki AIMS the scepter at the QUINJET and FIRES A BLAST OF
ENERGY. Thor gets to his feet, TACKLING Loki down hard.
THE QUINJET is soon caught on fire. HAWKEYE maneuvers one wing
of the jet. They SPIN and SLOW. DROPPING OUT OF THE AIR AS IT
PASSES OVER SKYSCRAPERS. Then... they SLAM into the street.
With everyone okay, HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW unfasten their
seatbelts and open the ramp. CAPTAIN AMERICA runs down, followed
by HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW. Each one has their respected weapons
in hand.
Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the destruction
going on in NEW YORK. Agent Hill walks up to him.
AGENT MARIA HILL
Sir. The council is on.
OH SHIT. Fury presses his screen.
The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN CRASHES into a history museum. DEAD. THOR
and HULK stand on the BACK of the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN after
bringing it down. They stand still, admiring. HULK PUNCHES THOR
WITH HIS ENORMOUS HAND. THOR GOES FLYING. HULK SMIRKS.
Dozens of civilians are gathered in bank. Tension and
uncertainty surround them. THREE CHITAURI SOLDIERS oversee them,
pointing their weapons at them. One of them charges a BOMB. It
BEEPS.
CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps through the window and throws his SHIELD
at the CHITAURI BOMBER. The TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS aim their
rifles, but Cap heads for cover under a desk, which he KICKS at
them.
CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps over the desk, HEADLOCKS A SOLDIER, while
BACKHANDING another one over the railing. The crowd moves away.
A CHITAURI SOLDIER attacks him from behind and RIPS OFF HIS
HELMET. The bomb is beeping faster.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Everyone! Clear out!
CAPTAIN AMERICA flips over the SOLDIER, grabs his SHIELD and
just as the BOMB is about to GO OFF, CHITAURI BOMBER dives for,
trying to stop it, but it GOES OFF, sending CAPTAIN AMERICA
through the window, landing very hard on a car. The civilians
look up from below. They're okay.
Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the WORLD
SECURITY COUNCIL.
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
Director Fury, the council has made a
decision.
NICK FURY
I recognize the council has made a
decision, but given that it's a stupid
ass decision, I've elected to ignore
it.
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
Director, you're closer than any of
oursubs, you scramble that jet...
NICK FURY
That is the island of Manhattan,
Councilman. Until I'm certain my team
can't hold it, I will not order a
nuclear strike against a civilian
population.
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
If we don't hold them in the air, we
lose everything.
NICK FURY
I send that bird out, we already have.
Fury shuts off his viewscreen.
As Loki looks up, shocked at what just happened, THE HULK IS
LEAPING UP AND KICKS LOKI, HURTLING TOWARDS THE GLASS WINDOW. He
COLLAPSES as he hits the wall. THE HULK jumps in, ready to
attack. Loki ROLLS himself up in a flurry of broken glass,
STANDING UP TO THE HULK.
LOKI
ENOUGH! YOU ARE, ALL OF YOU ARE BENEATH
ME! I AM A GOD, YOU DULL CREATURE, AND
I WILL NOT BE BULLIED...
HULK GRABS LOKI BY THE LEGS AND SMASHES HIM AGAINST THE FLOOR
REPEATEDLY AND FINALLY THROWS HIM ASIDE TO THE GROUND,
FLATTENING LOKI.
HULK
PUNY GOD.
LOKI WHIMPERS IN PAIN.
Back in the bridge, Agent Hill sees on her SCREEN 7 ALPHA 11
preparing to leave.
AGENT MARIA HILL
Sir, we have a bird in motion! Anyone
on the deck, we have a rogue bird! We
need to shut it down! Repeat! Take off
is not authorized!
PEPPER, along with her crew, watches on T.V., in horror, the
destruction in NEW YORK. On the table, her cell is VIBRATING,
with Tony's picture on it.
Back in the bridge, every single agent holds their breath as
they too watch IRON MAN fly up into the portal.
Every single agent CHEERS. Fury smiles. He tries to communicate
with Tony. NOTHING.
Loki crawls onto the stair, looking like a piece of shit rag
doll. He takes a few breathers, senses someone is behind him. He
turns TO FIND THE AVENGERS STARING AT HIM, PISSED.
LOKI
If it's all the same to you. I'll have
that drink.
THE HULK SNORTS AT HIM.
WEEKS LATER.
In TV news montage about THE AVENGERS, we see various reports of
what happened. Some people agree that the avengers did good,
protecting the city. Others believe it was their cause.
OLD MAN (STAN LEE)
Superheroes? In New York? Give me a
break!
SENATOR BOYNTON
These so called heroes have to be held
responsible for the destruction done to
the city. This was their fight. Where
are they now?
WAITRESS
What? That this was somehow their
fault? Captain America saved my life.
Wherever he is, wherever any of them
are, I just wanna say thank you.
Fury is facing once more members of the WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL.
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #3
Where are the Avengers?
NICK FURY
I'm not currently tracking their
whereabouts. I'd say they've earned a
leave of absence.
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
And the Tesseract?
NICK FURY
The Tesseract is where it belongs: out
of our reach.
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
That's not your call.
NICK FURY
I didn't make it. I just didn't argue
with the god that did.
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
So you let him take it and the war
criminal, Loki, who should be answering
for his crimes?
NICK FURY
Oh, I think he will be.
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
I don't think you understand what
you've started. Letting the Avengers
loose on this world. They're dangerous.
NICK FURY
They surely are. And the whole world
knows it. Every world knows it.
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
Was that the point of all this? A
statement?
NICK FURY
A promise.
Fury walks out, towards the bridge.
Fury and Agent Hill walk together, toward the window looking out
into the world.
AGENT MARIA HILL
Sir, how does it work now? They've gone
their separate ways, some pretty
extremely far. We get into a situation
like this again, what happens then?
NICK FURY
They'll come back.
AGENT MARIA HILL
You really sure about that?
NICK FURY
I am.
AGENT MARIA HILL
Why?
NICK FURY
Because we'll need them to.
Agent Hill turns around. Fury looks out, smiling.
TONY AND PEPPER UNVEIL A NEW DESIGN FOR STARK TOWER. CAMERA
PULLS OUT, showing the letters for "STARK TOWER" have been blown
away, and all that remains is a giant A.
