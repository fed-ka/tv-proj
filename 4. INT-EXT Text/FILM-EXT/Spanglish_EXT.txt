Showing us the room and beyond, through the window, a school
bus stopping at the corner on a dusty road.
We now see the full figure of the woman's back as she looks
up with excitement and stops rubbing with the word,
2.
"Cristina." When the man protests her stopping she indicates
they should both run and meet their daughter. He waves her
off. Stunned by his disinterest, she runs from the room.....

As CRISTINA, six years old and adorable, waits patiently to
step down. She sees her mother and grins and waves excitedly,
digging into her little pack to pull out an English book
which she displays with pride. Now she steps down from the
bus and, as she walks TOWARD CAMERA, narration begins. The
voice is of a girl eleven years older than the child we see.
NARRATOR
To Princeton University's Director
of Admissions: In considering me
for a scholarship you have asked
for, and have every reason to
expect, an essay from me about
myself. And, as a clever high
school graduate, I of course
realize the subtext of this essay
about who I am and why I want to
enter Princeton, is actually to
make clear to you why you should
have me. I have gotten tips, from
friends who have preceded me to
college, that being a Latina, with
my grades, list of activities and
relative poverty, I am as good as
in if I simply do the dance and
work in a word like
"bipolarization" every so often.
And while I love dances -- this
dance of self is one I am afraid to
master.
(young girl looks off and
lights up)
I prefer to write about my mother.

A drop-dead gorgeous Latin woman in her early 20's. As mother
and daughter move inside, a car pulls up with an ominous man
getting out. He nods in another direction calling our
attention to a police car parked off the street. The woman
does not notice - instead shepherding the child to her
father. The woman makes a big fuss over the text books the
child has..this is one supportive mom..again she is
disbelieving that her husband shows no interest, especially
when the child seems briefly hurt. The woman's husband looks
from the window and sees the ominous man coming. The woman
now does everything humanly possible to distract the child so
she does not see what is transpiring.
NARRATOR
For my mother, that afternoon
eleven years ago was a watershed
not because of my father's

imprisonment but because it was my
first day at school....

Standing proudly, smoothing her skirt.
CLOSE UP GIRL.
4.
As she clears her throat and says directly into camera.
GIRL
Hi.
The girl and woman are enormously excited over this word even
though, outside, her life's mate is being loaded into the
back of a police car.(Note: Mexican police DO NOT duck the
perpetrator's head WHEN LOADING THEM IN THE BACK SEAT..they
just allow the concussion.) It seems the mother will save her
child the trauma of her father being carted off; but the
police turn on their siren and the girl turns to see her
father as the car pulls away. The child is stricken. A tear
starts to form in her eye. Her mother acts quickly. We are
about to see powerful emotion reversed by sheer force of
will..the mother leans down, gives three quick kisses - power
pecks - to the girl's cheeks and then an admonition in
Spanish.
MOTHER
Una lgrima...sola una sola...Haz
la mejor possible.
NARRATOR
"One tear..only one...so make it a
good one." This was my mother's
instruction to me.
ON CHILD.
Baffled by the edict..
ON MOTHER.
Holding up one finger. That's it..one tear..she means it.
ON CHILD..
As she complies..one great tear forming and falling..Her
mother's thumb wipes it away..But now her eyes well with more
tears..her mother gestures she must have strength and
resolve..and so she does..a toss of her pretty little
head...the eyes clear.

11
Her mother selling keepsakes..counting money..Friends and
relatives bringing food, clothing - toys.
NARRATOR
Desperation in her hands was our
weapon.
ON MOTHER..
We see her totally intimidating a priest.
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
With this weapon she had her
marriage annulled - usually
impossible for the poor - and
somehow convinced an associate of
my father's to transport two
Mexicans North in style.

The plane crossing the Rio Grande.
NARRATOR
My mother's prayer for us, which
she made me repeat exactly,
represented a stunning look into
our future. "Please God, let only
the bad things change."

Plane landing on a dirt and grass strip...

Standing on the tarmac..Latin flavored music suddenly gives
way to a Texas country harmonica riff..The child tries to
comfort her apprehensive mother with the one wondrous fact
she finds so thrilling.
GIRL
(exulting)
Texas...
The mother hurries her along in the direction of distant
lights.
GIRL (CONT'D)
(more emphatically)
Texas.

The two of them waiting, small figures.
GIRL
Mam, Texas..
She raises her fingers like pistols. Shoots, blows in them
and reholsters them.

Adios, Texas.
TRANSITION TO:
19
19
As they disembark...the mother studying a slip of
paper...fearing she has made the mistake of a lifetime. The
child fascinated by all.
NARRATOR
At the time, I was oblivious to my
mother's anguish. She loved and
lived to talk. Now, as if by a
witch's spell, words were no longer
her bridge but her barrier. In a
very real sense she feared she had
left herself behind.
ON THE TWO FEMALES.
The mother sees something. Joy returns.
HER POV.
A street full of stores with SIGNS IN SPANISH..She begins
walking the street asking passers-by for directions in
Spanish and is answered..her step lightens..she beams with
relief. So far so very, very good.
20
20
An iron gate in front..small courtyard ringed by a second
floor horseshoe of apartments.
NARRATOR
We moved into a place managed by my
mother's aunt. My mother worked two
jobs in two local stores paying a
total of 450 dollars a week...
21
23
The courtyard is lit with colored lights and candles..a
wedding reception is in progress -
EXTREME CLOSE UP - THE BRIDE.
Gorgeous round and full cheeks stretched into a deep,
explosive smile.
BACK TO SCENE... music plays and we focus on Cristina, now
nearing 12 years of age..dancing with her mother and some
other smaller children.. The mother eyes the muscular back of
a Great Looking Man...who turns, and quickly oozes quality
sex appeal. She is turned on..They talk in Spanish...him
saying something hushed like, "I have been afraid to talk to
you. I need oxygen when I look at you." She indicates the six
children she is dancing with and offers to include him in
some ring around the rosey dance...He indicates the magic of
just the two of them...She quickly leads her little flock
away..
OTHER ANGLE..
A reed-thin FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY is staring at them...at
first the mother thinks this is adorable...the child eyeing
her as if he were a man..she indicates he should join the
rest of the children for a dance..
MOVING WITH THE BOY..
As he steps forward and it becomes clear it is Cristina he is
interested in... Before the mom can do anything about it, he
asks Cristina to dance and she readily accepts.
ON CRISTINA..
Satellite virginities falling with alarming speed..the first
time held by a male, the first time held close, the first
sexy (albeit touchingly awkward) gaze from half-closed male
eyes which utterly confuses Cristina. He begins to grind his
hips into his dancing partner.
ON HER MOTHER.
Not confused. It is exactly as if she sees her daughter about
to be run down by a car..only this time the thing to do is
scare the car.
10.
She runs toward the boy -- he sees the force of nature coming
his way and makes a break but she gets him and actually lifts
him and throws him to the sidelines. Then pats him on the
head maternally and goes back to Cristina.
CRISTINA.
Somewhat proud of her mom as the boy leaves the scene.
NARRATOR
That quickly it was clear she could
no longer work two jobs and leave
me to my own at night. The
following morning she did something
about it. A boy I never saw again
had changed our lives.
24
26
MUSIC CHANGE..as they disembark and start walking, joining
the busload of domestics into the canyon and up the
hill....they walk past a perfect country club fairway. Grand
trees from either side meet each other high over the road.
ON OUR GAL..AS THEY WALK
She sees the stuff...the dream that makes you migrate. She is
not awed..she is jazzed. To her aunt she does the Latin
version of OH.....MY...GOD!!!!!!!!...At regular intervals in
the background, one black SUV after another has a mother
taking kids home from school.
27
27
Monica presses the security intercom. The gate swings open.
28
28
In the foreground an expanse of turned up dirt...and huge
rolls of sod ready to be laid down. A catering truck stands
in the driveway.
29
29
They enter..lots of glass French doors STAND OPEN to lawn,
pool and pool house. They look off.
11.
THEIR POV.
DEBORAH NORWICH CLASKY, a cool beauty in her mid 30's, sits
dominating this three generation portrait of the Good Life.
She is wearing a straw hat and killer Hawaiian shirt..She is
a perfect dresser; meaning her clothes seem to say she
doesn't care, while every article is a true and gifted find.
She is drinking from a tumbler which is also of the "don't
hold your breath while you try to find something as terrific"
variety. She is flanked by her mother, EVELYN, 60, who is
drinking from a stemmed glass with two olives and her 14 year
old overweight daughter, BERNICE..who is reading, her
grandmother idly holding her hand..In the immediate area more
rolls of sod wait to be laid.
THE TWO LATINAS.
As they stand inside the kitchen not sure what to do next.
Then Deborah gestures that they should join her at the
pool..as they start out..
THEIR EXIT.
Boink..three stooges retro..those French doors were not open
after all. Monica hits first. The women at the pool react.
Deborah and Bernice running. Evelyn momentarily attempts to
join the rush.. she half rises and then thinks better of
it..too late in the day for sudden movements.
KITCHEN DOORWAY.
BERNICE
Gee whiz in heaven...How are you?
Please?
DEBORAH
(a bit hyper)
Don't worry..I'm not mad...I was
looking for decoration to put on
the glass so people would stop
walking into it and instead of
taking what they had in stock,
which was awful, I special ordered.
I'll design something myself which
I should have done in the fi...
Our heroine, seeing the blood flow from her aunt's nose,
gestures that Monica needs help not conversation.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
..and what difference does that
make when your nose is bleeding.
Shut up, Deborah.
BERNICE
Now you got it, Mom.
12.
Deborah grabs at paper towels, gets an ice pack from the
freezer and then grabs some cash from a bowl in the
kitchen..She has, moment to moment, the enormous desire to
feel loved that only the seriously hard to love can
experience.
DEBORAH
Here, take these.
(second thought)
Was that strange to give you
money..I just felt badly that..
MONICA
It's okay.
She pockets the cash.
30

Moments later. As the group arrives at the outdoor table.
Evelyn makes half-hearted incomplete gestures of shaking
hands, nodding, indicating a seat...each simple act a test
which she fails -- every gesture a bit too late and then
some..simply too much for her to manage with the drinks under
her belt. In the background workers roll out sod, the yard
becoming more beautiful even as we look.
MONICA
She is my niece. She and her
daughter live in the apartment I
manage. Yolanda, who worked for
you, lived there before she went
back home. That's how I heard about
the job.
DEBORAH
So who am I interviewing?
MONICA
Her.
DEBORAH
(forcefully)
You're gorgeous.
On our gal..as she, not understanding the word, smiles and
nods.
MONICA
(translating sotto)
Vistosos.
Our gal thrown. Not knowing how now to react.
EVELYN
She doesn't mean it as a
compliment. It's more of an
accusation.
13.
DEBORAH
This is my daughter Bernice and
this is my mother, Evelyn Norwich..
BERNICE
(rising)
Excuse me...Glad you're okay.
(then to other Latina)
Good luck.
Our gal smiles back in appreciation.
DEBORAH
No, stay..this involves you.
BERNICE
I wouldn't want some kid around for
my interview. You understand, Mom.
EVELYN
(to Bernice)
Strength of character..empathy..big
heart..taste for futility - God I
love you.
She eyes with disapproval her mother's empty glass.
DEBORAH
MOTHER!
(then to Bernice)
Stop. It's just a conversation -
not an interview. Please sit.
(to visitors)
Don't you want to get out of the
sun?
She indicates a shaded seat. Deborah is protected by hat,
umbrella, sun glasses while her guest sits bareheaded
enjoying the rays and indicates she is fine. Underneath
Deborah's surface is a Russian roulette of deeply felt
emotions..at this moment she is earnest and vulnerable.
DEBORAH (TO OUR GAL) (CONT'D)
You guys want some lemonade?
(they demur)
Let's just talk. I have two
children. My husband works
nights..he's a chef and has his own
place.
MONICA
Do you work?
DEBORAH
I helped run a commercial design
company until ten months ago when
14.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
it was downsized to zip. Okay. I
have two children. I like the house
to be like me in that I'm very
loose and meticulous at the same
time. It's all about first names
and closeness here but I care about
the place, you know. It's what they
used to call homemaker..
The two visitors exchange a wide-eyed look. Which Deborah
sees and understands.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
(to Monica)
I'm not leaving time for you to
translate.
Monica says, in Spanish, "this woman is very strange. The
only thing I understand is she has two kids." Deborah leans
into Monica. Face to face, tender but unblinking..
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Too bad for you that it just never
occurred to you to check on how
much Spanish I know.
MONICA
(a solid beat of
humiliation then)
I'm sorry what I say about
you...don't hold it against her.
BERNICE
Mom!!
DEBORAH
I don't speak any Spanish. But I'm
not an idiot - I talk for an hour
and you say two words. What did you
say?
Monica squirms - unusual for her.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Never mind. You got your nose
bopped. I got my feelings hurt.
Onward.
As Monica paraphrases what has happened, her translation is
DIALED DOWN for the:

(as Deborah continues
talking)
I will major in linguistics and
make sociology my sub-
concentration. Because it has been
my experience that the barriers of

NARRATOR (cont'd)
language are more than we dare
admit. That, as much as we
translate, finally we will never
understand each other. My mother's
name, for example, beautiful in
Spanish, becomes leaden and awful
when pronounced by a non-Latin.
DEBORAH (IN THE CLEAR)
What's your name? Llamo? One of my
five Spanish words..
OUR GAL
Flor Moreno.
She pronounces Flor in the Latin way...lots of RRRR's with a
curling of the tongue sound at the end.
DEBORAH
Flor.
She pronounces it flat like the "floor" we walk
on...throughout the following each of the women sticks to
their pronunciation as indicated by the extra "r's.
FLOR
(correcting)
Florrrrr.
DEBORAH
Flor.
FLOR

Florrrrr.
DEBORAH

DEBORAH
Flor..what I walk on?
MONICA AND EVELYN
Florrrrr.
16.
FLOR
Florrrrr.
BERNICE
It means flower, right?
MONICA
Yes. Flower. Florrrrr.
EVELYN
Florrrrr.
FLOR
Florrrrr.
Deborah is beginning to feel criticized...she takes a
beat..eyes everyone with some hostility.
DEBORAH
(directly to Flor)
Is there some school of the ear I'm
flunking out of right now?
Flor says to Monica, in Spanish, a tip to pronounce her name.
Monica warns Flor to leave it rest..since Deborah is becoming
clearly and strangely pissed..
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
What did she say?
CLOSE ON FLOR...
She feels the tension but, so far in her life, her own
irrepressible personality has served her - so she moves
forward with surprising and quiet confidence and assurance.
She tells her aunt to repeat her words so that now, for the
first time, she is, through Monica, talking directly to
Deborah.
MONICA
(translating)
She says..If you curl your tongue
and let it be loose you will have
it..that it's hard for Americans..
She says it's great that you try so
hard. Many people wouldn't bother.
DEBORAH
(an emotional
pronouncement/her
greatest accolade)
She gets me....
She smiles at Flor, who returns the smile.
17.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
You want some lemonade? Take some
lemonade.
She pours some for Flor and Monica. Then she closes her eyes
and pauses in utter dedication to a final effort:
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Florrrrr.
It is perfect..Flor grins at Deborah's victory...claps her
hands together.
FLOR
(a Spanish word)
Sublime.
Deborah feels relief..free for a moment from the dark
corridors of self-criticism..She is lighter, prettier,
innocent..Wholly and completely attractive.
DEBORAH
Whew, dense but stubborn, right?
Thanks.
(an important declaration)
What you just did with me is just
what kids need..patience and
encouragement. Alright, money...
Bernice rises like a shot to take off..
BERNICE
Goodbye, really..
(to Flor)
Look forward to seeing you.
As she leaves.
DEBORAH
(absently to Bernie)
Love you...
(then with not a
monoseconds break)
... the job is six days a week,
seven to seven..the kids and all
housekeeping, how much a week would
you like?
Monica translates..Flor, embarrassed a bit by the directness,
ducks the question..saying in Spanish -- "whatever you say.."
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
No.. This is an important
question..if you ask for too little
it means you don't value
18.
yourself..too much and you're
taking advantage.
(after Monica translates)
So?
Flor is dumbstruck by the challenge of this pop quiz but not
without some native wit and style to maneuver around it.
FLOR
(extremely heavy accent)
One thousand dollars.
Deborah falls for it until Flor laughs..others join...Deborah
now a big smile, snort of a laugh, putting her hand to her
face and shaking her head.
OTHER ANGLE..
As Monica uses Deborah's reaction time to, in mid-laugh,
flash four fingers to Flor..
ON EVELYN.
Catching the gesture and secretly indicating to Monica they
should go for six.
MONICA
(firmly)
Six hundred dollars.
Flor shoots her a look of fear...a tense beat.
DEBORAH
Welcome to the family..
Deborah kisses her..sort of on the mouth. In the midst of
Flor's delight she is thrown by Deborah's kiss...it is the
first of many borders to be violated.

JOHN'S POV - DEBORAH AND TWO FEMALE CATERERS.
Deborah is wearing a party dress. They are rolling out the
last huge cylinder of sod, completing the now beautifully
manicured backyard. It is hard manual labor involving
physical strength. The female caterers are complaining that
it's too heavy but Deborah is undeterred.
DEBORAH
(to catering women)
We can do it. Come on.
She falls over the roll..getting filthy..but it gives and
they gain momentum...one of the catering women falling down,
one losing pace.. Deborah,however, gains the upper hand. Yet,
even while succeeding, she remonstrates herself.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
(great exertion)
Why... do... I... care.. so..
much.. about.... CRAP?
And now she wins.. the cylinder of grass rolls all the way
out and she jumps on the seam in victory. She is dirty,
spent and triumphant..the components for a solid sexual
experience..and, in truth, as the exhausted caterers half-
heartedly applaud the bizarre victory, she has gotten off.
She looks with mother's pride at the lawn. Then sees John.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Can you believe they left without
finishing?
As she looks at her handiwork - John looks at her..A
grin..half laugh.. He loves the dame.
20.
DEBORAH (BREATHLESS) (CONT'D)
Looks great, huh?.... You're not
looking.
JOHN
I was getting a kick looking at you
look at it.
Not the answer she wanted..
DEBORAH
I better get dressed again in case
anybody's just a half hour late.
She hits a switch at the door and the backyard area is now
fully illuminated -- set up for a dinner party for 20 or
so....all details thought about and done to a "T". This is
the outdoor lighting nobody nails..the twinkling of a half
acre..the path to the pool like a runway to heaven. As she
looks at it all she has a wistful moment.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
(a replenishing sigh)
Okay..We're okay here.
(then)
Why can't everything be like sod?
There's no wait, no dung, nothing
you have to do right and yet it's
perfect. It covers up all your
dirt and makes things immediately
pretty..then, the miracle, if you
just give it time, it roots and you
can't tell it from the real thing.
(a look to her husband)
No reaction. Nothing to say.
JOHN
Huh? Oh sure..I, uh..Well, no, I
don't have anything particular to
say.
DEBORAH
Oh, John why don't you just take
out a knife and kill me all
together.
Somewhat crushed, she prepares to exit.
JOHN
How'd you get there..Hey, wait a
minute..Deb..stop..come on.
(she turns)
I'd like to figure this one out.
What would have been the great
thing for me to say after you said
the sod sentence?..Really.
21.
DEBORAH
That's actually a good question.
JOHN
There you go. I surprise sometimes.
DEBORAH
I would have liked, if after I
compared the sod to life, if you
had said, "Exactly!"
She turns to leave.
JOHN
Yeah. But to say that and mean it
I'd have to think the same way you
do.
DEBORAH
(some sense of mischief)
It's worth a try...I had something
else to tell you...it'll come to
me..
36
37
Flor smiling..enjoying the canyon..as she walks the mile plus
from the bus stop to work..one of a straggly line of
domestics. Deborah jogs into view.
DEBORAH
Hi, Flor..See you up there.
Deborah runs past..She is clearly upset..She is also more
than a stay-in-shape jogger. She is an athletic woman fueled
by an ever flickering pilot light of anxiety. This makes her
seriously quick. She is highly aware of passing
everybody..She needs to pass everybody..Her voice trails
behind her as she announces to all as she approaches.."left,
please," "left," "left."
38
47
The biggest, baddest, BLACKEST SUV..there is some subtle
custom work so the vehicle impacts us in ways we cannot quite
fathom. Deborah is wiping away a tear as she gets in and
shares a woman to woman moment with Flor.
DEBORAH
Fuckin' hombres, huh?
She sniffles. Flor nods uncertainly. A small voice from the
back seat..Georgie..
GEORGIE
I just didn't want to sing last
night.
DEBORAH'S VOICE
(hurt)
Yeah. Well you said you would..You
said you wanted to. I asked you
five times. Then when I have the
whole party paying attention you
refused.
As she puts the car in gear...Georgie sings insanely well.
But he's just two lines into an old blues standard:
DEBORAH
It doesn't do any good now,
Georgie.
She presses a button on her dash and a glass partition comes
up between front and back seat thereby cutting him off in mid-
song. Flor is utterly baffled by the notion of putting a
divider between parent and child. But Deborah is calling for
her to pay attention to the car's navigation screen.. a
Spanish voice says, "route guidance system starting."
31.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
I've programmed it for Spanish..
Look, it will take you anywhere and
then back home. If you figured out
how to make coffee on that thing
it's all downhill.
The MALE SPANISH VOICE talks about imminent left turns. Flor
is thrown by the amount of oddness..All the while Georgie is
singing his little heart out in the back seat. Flor,amused by
the boy, suppresses a smile...maybe the first time in her
life she's had to suppress joy. But Deborah never misses
anything.
DEBORAH (TO FLOR) (CONT'D)
This is stop gap..You, kiddo,
you're going to have to learn
English.
48
52
As John gets in his seat..then sees Flor approaching the door
and hops out to open her door...apologizing as he goes.
JOHN
Sorry. I'm cracking.
As he moves back to his side of the vehicle.
JOHN (CONT'D)
(a shout)
Shiiiiiiit!
Flor hears this from inside and nods in agreement.
53
54
As Flor is dropped off...the goodbye awkward.
NARRATOR
The job was taxing her. She had no
template for confusion let alone
frustration.
While waiting for the bus, Flor suddenly turns and runs a few
yards...and then back..and waves off the looks from her
colleagues - many of whom are overweight..many of them
adorable. All puzzled for the moment as they watch Flor
unsuccessfully try to shake off her day.
55
56
Flor is the only one waiting. An empty bus stops and she gets
on.
57

As we see Deborah cross Sunset Blvd., overtake and pass two
UCLA men running at a good clip as Flor's bus stops.
CLOSE ON FLOR..
As she strides purposefully up the street.
NARRATOR
This is one of the cultural
differences between us which I wish
to explore academically at
Princeton. American women, I
believe, actually feel the same as
Hispanic women about weight.

The house asleep. Flor walks carefully up the steps.

ANGLE ON DEBORAH & KILLER HILL:
Two young athletic men and one woman considerably ahead of
her on the steep incline.
DEBORAH
Left..left..
ON RUNNERS.
They turn and look confused at Deborah who is so far behind
them she has no need to pass..They turn away. Deborah
struggles to turn it on and does so...huffing to just behind
them where she utters one more strained:
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Left.
And then passes.
NARRATOR
...dieting, exercising American
women become afraid of everything
associated with being curvaceous,
such as wantonness, lustfulness,
sex, food, motherhood..all that is
good in life.

As John, growing tense, walks toward the front gate..Chum
proffers a ball and accepts defeat as he bends down to pick
up the New York Times. John's body chemistry launches a
surprise attack...anxiety and dread...He takes his newspaper
to a wire bench in the front driveway..He finds the
section..opens to the page..and just like that his life
changes forevermore.
67
72
Flor walks to the news stand - as if to buy something --
changes her mind and LEAVES THE FRAME only to RETURN A HALF-
BEAT LATER where she reads to the dealer from a note.

A man is parked at the gate in an open convertible..He is
great looking...We HEAR Deborah's excited voice over the gate
speaker...

As Deborah calls behind her as she opens the door...
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Mom, you want to come?..the
realtor's here..Okay, see you
later.
She clicks the gate open and walks to the man..perfect 40
year old great looking surfer sort..Deborah does the very
slightest of "takes" at his looks..As she gets in..
54.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Hi.
REALTOR
I'm Mike..there's one great rental
that just came on..so we're
starting at the top..
As they pull away...
82
82
Deborah's hair whips across her face...it's bothersome.
DEBORAH
I'll never be one of those girls
whose hair blows perfectly in a
convertible.
REALTOR
Move your seat forward..
Puzzled, she uses the electric lever and the seat budges
forward..
REALTOR (CONT'D)
A little more..just..good.
The Realtor uses his switches and raises his window a
bit..her window a bit less and monkeys the position of the
half windows in back...Deborah turns around checking out the
odd tweaking and then faces forward. Her hair blows perfectly
and beautifully behind her...
DEBORAH
Oh, you must be trouble.
On his small laugh...
83
83
As they move toward the house...seeing the beach beyond.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Gorgeous, huh..Pretty, fabulous,
beautiful. What word is the same in
Spanish?
FLOR
Fabuloso.
DEBORAH
(taking it as a
compliment)
Thanks.
55.
84
85
As they move through a little courtyard area toward the
street.
DEBORAH
You must learn English. Why won't
she learn English? I'm going to
have to learn, "you must learn
English," in Spanish.
EVELYN
I think Flor is perfect and we
should do all we can to keep her
from changing.
DEBORAH
Gee, you took the words right out
of my mouthay.
56.
86
86
As she leads Flor along the highway side of Carbon Beach -
passing houses until she sees a Hispanic man washing
someone's car in a driveway. Evelyn is many steps back.
DEBORAH
Oh, good. Do you speak English?
HISPANIC MAN
Yes, I do.
DEBORAH
Would you translate for me?
He looks at Flor..my God.
HISPANIC MAN
Sure...forever.
He speaks to her in Spanish..a lavish, poetic compliment.
Flor, in full control, says, in Spanish.."Would you please
just find out what she wants." Evelyn joins them.
DEBORAH
Wait till I say something before
you start in..
(he looks at her)
I rented a house here for the
summer and now she must sleep at
the house because of the bus
schedule.
He translates along with Deborah's speech.
ON FLOR.
Stricken. She turns to Deborah.
FLOR
No.. Sorry.
DEBORAH
What? Why?
Flor talks briefly in Spanish.
HISPANIC MAN
She can't because of her daughter.
DEBORAH
You have a daughter? You have a
whole daughter you haven't
mentioned..How old?
FLOR
Twelve.
57.
DEBORAH
(to Evelyn)
It's a little crazy that I don't
know that.
The man translates.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
(to man)
Don't translate asides.
The man says in Spanish to Flor.."You work for her?"--Flor
answers, "just tell her that I can't live here." Deborah
doesn't like that the man has initiated more conversation.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Hey!
HISPANIC MAN
She can't live here. Her daughter.
DEBORAH
Okay..
(beat then big decision)
Her daughter can also live with us
for the summer..
The man tells Flor..she answers directly to Deborah..
FLOR
(big decision)
No, sorry.
DEBORAH
Why?
The man asks Flor who speaks in Spanish..
HISPANIC MAN
I don't know. She just doesn't want
to.
DEBORAH
Will you please just tell me what
she said.
HISPANIC MAN
She said, "I just don't want to."
EVELYN
If she didn't tell us about her
child she has to have a deep sense
of privacy. We can figure out how
she can still live at home. Hell, I
don't mind driving her at night.
58.
DEBORAH
Let's spare the world you on the
roads.
(to Flor)
Well, what do we do?
The Hispanic man translates the last sentence. Deborah and
Flor stare at each other..Deborah's next words are somber and
have enough body language to transcend the need for
translation...the jig is up.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
(big decision)
I'm sorry, my friend, this is what
I need. It's just for the summer. I
don't want to lose you. But ....
Flor indicates there is no need to translate. A beat.
FLOR
(enormous decision)
Yo vivo aqu.
HISPANIC MAN
She'll live here.
The man says something in Spanish to Flor as she starts to
walk away and she is thrown enough by the statement to
actually stumble as she looks back at him...then, before
Deborah can admonish him.
HISPANIC MAN (CONT'D)
I said, "God protect you from that
boss."
87
87
As Cristina, trying to suppress her grin, skips quickly down
the stairs moving towards a truck from John's restaurant.
Flor follows tight lipped - resolved. They each carry many
clothes on wire hangers. A group of girls on the balcony
literally cheer Cristina on.
BALCONY GIRLS
(accented)
MAL-----I------BU!
Cristina grins hugely back at them.
88
90
The truck in the driveway..the women walking through a front
door into a court yard.
91
91
Georgie, in a swim suit, talking to CHUM in the manner of
people trying to excite dogs.
GEORGIE
Who wants to go swimming?..Yes, who
wants to go swimming?
The dog goes crazy with excitement -- then, droll for a nine
year old, Georgie turns to his grandmother (who is sunning
herself and reading) and addresses her in precisely the same
way. Evelyn has a drink in hand..
GEORGIE (CONT'D)
(to grandmother)
Who wants to go swimming?..Huh..
EVELYN
Not now..But I promise I'll go in
the summer after next.
John enters the scene..
JOHN
You want to go swimming?
GEORGIE
Oh yeah, you're off.
JOHN
What do you think, wet suits?
60.
GEORGIE
Wet suits are for wimps..
JOHN
Yeah, you're right..let me get
mine..
Georgie laughs..
GEORGIE
(to Dad)
You're good.
92
92
Behind Flor and Cristina as they move toward the Claskys and
their destiny....Flor behind her daughter.
REVERSE - CLOSE ON CRISTINA.
As her eyes pop on seeing the Clasky beach house.
VERY CLOSE ON DEBORAH
As her eyes pop on seeing the stunning twelve year-old enter
her home, haloed by the sun. Again, Flor less distinct in
the background.
Bernice, just outside the open patio door, is putting on a
shirt over her bathing suit as she looks at Cristina and
emits a small, prescient moan.
DEBORAH
(to Flor)
Look at this child..Flor, you could
make a fortune at surrogate
pregnancy....
Flor looks to her daughter for some understanding of what
Deborah said..
FLOR
Que?
Cristina is as nonplussed by the remark as her mother.
JOHN
Hi. I'm John..It's good to see you.
(to Flor indicating
Cristina)
Great..
DEBORAH
(to Cristina)
Hi. This is my daughter,
Bernice..I'm Deborah..And out
there...are Georgie and.
61.
As she turns to gesture toward her mother and son, Evelyn has
almost reached them ..
EVELYN
I'm so glad to meet you. I'm a fan
of your mother's.
CRISTINA
I'm Cristina.
As all acknowledge each other Deborah tugs at Bernie's top
which is half tucked in.
BERNICE
(kidding around but right
on)
No comparisons, please, no
comparisons.
Evelyn shoves her granddaughter for the self-
deprecation..Flor says something to her daughter in Spanish.
CRISTINA
My mother says it's best if we get
out of the way and put our things
away.
JOHN
Have you ever been to the beach
here?
CRISTINA
I've never been anyplace but Mexico
and Texas.....before today.
John goes to a big toy box and opens it up..it is filled with
beach paddles, Frisbees and boogie boards.
JOHN
Here's the most important place in
the house..grab this stuff whenever
you want.
CRISTINA
(delighted)
Thank you..thank you so much.
DEBORAH
Very little accent?
FLOR
(suspiciously)
Que?
CRISTINA
(to Flor)
Sin acento.
62.
Her mom, not crazy about the lack of accent to begin with,
nods.
CRISTINA (CONT'D)
(to Deborah)
Thank you..there's an A.P. total
fluency class where they work you
pretty hard at sounding American.
Flor doesn't want her daughter to have an extended
conversation with Deborah of which she doesn't understand a
word.
FLOR
Cristina..
DEBORAH
Right. Settle in..
CRISTINA
Thank you. I am thrilled to be
here.
93
94
Flor and Cristina, two sea nymphs, lit by the floodlights
from the beach homes.
OTHER ANGLE.
John and Georgie in the waves..body surfing...they get to
shore...John sees the two females..dashing in the water in
their bathing suits..He remains hidden in a very shallow wave
as they run in...then once they are in he starts taking off
his wet suit hurriedly...
ON JOHN..
As he suffers the cold -- Georgie enjoying every moment.
95
95
Wave lights still shining..On a dune sits Cristina, looking
out.
96
98
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Stop thanking me. I love having the
company.
CRISTINA
It was an adventure which I'll
remember.
DEBORAH
Your English is genius. Do you
dream in Spanish or English?
CRISTINA
Just recently I've had a dream in
English.
DEBORAH
What was it?
CRISTINA
I am so sorry. I -- uh..I'd ..I uh,
can't tell ..This is so
uncomfortable.
DEBORAH
You could have just said you didn't
remember.
CRISTINA
I, uh, guess so..but I do.
DEBORAH
Look who's sensational.
65.
99
99
Evelyn is sitting on the patio making sangria..Flor enters.
She is pissed.
EVELYN
What's wrong?
She shows her the letter. Evelyn reads it and hands it
back..She is about to offer something..Flor waves it off and
enters the house..John comes in from the beach with his
kids..boogie boards...Evelyn hands him the letter..
EVELYN (CONT'D)
She's wild-eyed over this..
John moves after Flor as Bernie reads the letter..
BERNICE
Aw, shit..
(then quickly)
Sorry about the word, Georgie.
GEORGIE
It's okay.
BERNICE
You want to know what happened?
GEORGIE
No thank you.
100
101
Deborah's SUV loaded at the curb..She and Cristina begin to
carry things in...(NOTE: Cristina's hair has been restyled.)
102
107
John is talking to all three kids in an effort to lift the
overall atmosphere. IN THE BACKGROUND we see Deborah handing
Flor her letter..Cristina taking sidelong glances...relieved
to see them shake hands (Flor engaging), hug (Flor
reluctant).
JOHN
So here's the idea..I want to make
a serving platter for serving fish
using sea glass like this..
He holds out some sea glass.
JOHN (CONT'D)
I used to hunt for this stuff every
free minute when I apprenticed in
Italy. This is bits of broken glass
that the ocean sand blasts over the
years..great looking, huh? So you
guys go hunting and I'll pay 50
cents for any piece, a dollar for
anything as big as this and five
dollars for any color that isn't
brown, clear or green.
GEORGIE
Do we have to do this?
BERNICE
(to Georgie)
Oh, come on...
Georgie and Bernice start off..
71.
JOHN
Come on, Cristina - go get em.
Her eyes widen and off she runs, intoxicated with being
included and having the chance to make money.
108
108
The kids combing through pebbles.
Georgie becoming bored and stopping..
Bernie stopping.
109
109
Lots of people on their decks..hot-tubbing, sunning,
partying..rich people forming New Yorker cartoons in the
background as Cristina continues to doggedly collect her sea
glass. At one point, she comes upon a teenage couple making
out near a mass of pebbles, and politely asks them to roll
over so she can search the area.
110
111
Cristina collecting sea glass.

Illuminated by the surf lights of the beach homes, Cristina
plugs away.
DISSOLVE TO:
113
113
John exits his door and steps to his car..as he is about to
get in..
CRISTINA'S VOICE
Excuse me.
He looks up and steps around to where she is...there is a
battered wood table along the side of the house.
JOHN
Hi..what's doing?
She overturns a large bucket and a small mountain of sea
glass spills on the table.
JOHN (CONT'D)
I'm broke.
72.
CRISTINA
(feeling horrible)
No..you don't have to pay..I'm
sorry. Don't worry, please.
JOHN
No. I'm kidding..Instead of a
platter -- I'll just build a sea
glass building and serve fish
inside... Great, Cristina..Why
don't you count it and..
CRISTINA
I have... Many times..I didn't
sleep. I counted.
JOHN
So what's the damage...total?
Her eyes locked on his.
CRISTINA
(dead serious)
It depends on whether you consider
these four a color other than
green, brown or clear..
She takes them from her pocket.
JOHN
Well, this one is borderline.
CRISTINA
I agree.
JOHN
Oh my God, you found a blue..Nobody
finds a blue..You know how a blue
happens? I mean, before the ocean
blasts it for 30-40 years. Somebody
had to throw away an old Milk of
Magnesia bottle. You know what Milk
of Magnesia is?
CRISTINA
Unfortunately.
He smiles broadly. The kid's a trip. He likes her.
JOHN
So how much for the whole deal?
CRISTINA
(unable to look at him)
Eleven hundred and one dollar.
He reacts..then..
73.
JOHN
Okay. We'll finish dealing with it
when I get home from work.
She gasps..

As Flor takes a package from the box.
NARRATOR
My mother showed an extraordinary
facility for learning the language.

As John arrives...He bumps the walls on entering.

127
Cristina and Bernice waiting in line at the Mexican fast food
place on P.C.H. with the towering signature Mexican male
figure on its roof. Deborah is parked curbside in the SUV.
BERNICE
How'd you get your mother to let
you go with my mother?
CRISTINA
Well, your mother just said she
could use my help on a few errands
while you're in class...
Bernice nods. Then unconsciously moans.
CRISTINA (CONT'D)
What?
BERNICE
No. Just that I hate summer school.
CRISTINA
Why do you go then?
BERNICE
(looks at her)
I'm not sure I can explain to you
the concept of not doing well in a
class..in this case math...and the
system kind of insists on the
illusion that you've learned math --
so they make you go to summer
school..It helps them avoid facing
that they have failed in their
mission.
CRISTINA
What do you mean they failed?
BERNICE
Joking.
CRISTINA
Oh. I see. Forgive me, I don't have
a real sense of humor.
BERNICE
(looking skyward)
Thank you, God.
(on Cristina's reaction)
Joking...
CRISTINA
The joke is?
83.
As they get in the car..Bernice doing a little stutter step
offering Cristina the front seat..Cristina demurs.
128
130
Deborah and Cristina standing in a grass bordered parking
lot...Deborah, feigning upset, tearing into her bag but her
focus is elsewhere as she periodically looks off. She is
clearly stalling.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Can't find my keys..
Another woman, ARLENE FOLSOM, calls to her..
ARLENE
Deborah...
DEBORAH
(acting surprised)
Hi, Arlene..
(to Cristina)
Come on.
They walk to greet Arlene.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Hi. This is Cristina..the girl I'm
always raving about..This is Arlene
Folsom..the school director.
ARLENE
Hi..
CRISTINA
(Barbara Boxer couldn't do
it better)
Hello..a pleasure to meet you, Ms.
Folsom. I couldn't believe how
beautiful the grounds were as we
drove in. I just think the balance
of the buildings to open ground is
so wonderful and must have been
very difficult to achieve.
Deborah smiles with pride at the elegant first impression
Cristina is making..all are grinning...the two adults
suspiciously so...sharing their delight.
ARLENE
Would you like a little tour?
MOVING CAMERA..
First showing Cristina in foreground and her POV of this Drop
Dead Gorgeous Rich Kids School in the background and then we
MOVE CLOSER ON CRISTINA. We see lust in her reaction.
85.
NARRATOR
The experience was literally mind
boggling. My mind did boggle. My
cranial cells stunned. Even if I
had enough sense of wonder to
imagine such a school existed; my
sense of fairness made it
unthinkable that any school could
offer this much more than my own..
131
Summer session - L.A. public school..ninety percent Hispanic.
Through Flor's POV, the place is seen not as crowded and worn
but as vibrant with community.
134
134
Highly anxious and out of place, she sees the upper-scale
students..five percent Latino...No brochure can do it
justice. Overwhelmed by the implications, Flor's eyes tear.
135
138
He sits..she stands, gorgeous..The wind gusts periodically
blowing her dress against her body. He tries not to notice.
FLOR
You know about Cristina and your
great school?
JOHN
Oh, it's happened. Is it driving
you nuts?
FLOR
Yes, nuts. I have no idea what to
do. Such an important thing.
JOHN
Yeah.
FLOR
It's a good school?
JOHN
Tops. It's tops.
FLOR
So you like it?
88.
JOHN
No. I hate the damn school. But
that's because they keep sending my
daughter home anxiety-ridden,
mostly over geometry..I mean you
"get" Bernice..In a decent world
her school should let her know how
great she is, right?
FLOR
Very right.
JOHN
So, don't ask me..I'm worried about
my own kid there.
FLOR
You don't have to worry about
Bernice. Nothing is going to change
that heart.
He looks at her..Out of nowhere overwhelmed by someone
echoing and affirming his deepest most private thoughts about
his daughter..It is odd..being this deeply touched before he
knows what hit him..He makes little adjustments until the
moment passes..
JOHN
Um.....yeah..thanks...
(then)
It's great to hear someone else say
that out loud..Hard to explain.
FLOR
I "get" it.
JOHN
(a beat..then deeply, with
core feelings, a lament)
Ah, man..
FLOR
(caring)
It will be okay.
JOHN
No, I was thinking about you..
FLOR
(instantly alarmed)
Your, "Ah, man" was for me? You
think I am in trouble with
Cristina?
JOHN
It's just tough to be sane.
(MORE)
89.
JOHN (cont'd)
To know you're not just making
something out of nothing. That when
you think you're at some
crossroads - you are.
FLOR
(she takes this in/nods)
....I never know a man who can put
himself in my place like you do.
How do you become that man?
JOHN
I don't know...You introduce two
Jews in the desert and wait five
thousand years. Then, bingo,
somebody else who can see trouble
coming but can't do anything about
it.
FLOR
I don't understand.
JOHN
That's okay.
FLOR
I want to.
JOHN
Nothing. I don't know what I'm
talking about..
A sustained gust of wind which celebrates her shape in a way
which cannot be ignored.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Will you sit down.. Get out of the
damn wind.
She sits. It helps.
JOHN (CONT'D)
So you going to send her?
FLOR
I don't know. But it does not feel
good. I think if she goes there it
will be one of two things..either
she will be odd...or she will make
herself the same as them.
JOHN
(in wonderment)
That is EXACTLY the way I felt
about Bernice going there..Exactly.
(MORE)
90.
JOHN (cont'd)
I wasn't able to think it that
clearly...But that's how I felt. So
between odd and the same...you
gotta root for odd, don't you?
FLOR
Yes, you gotta.
Camera begins to pull back...early in the move John's words
stop the movement.
JOHN
This was a crummy summer.
Flor nods ruefully..then suddenly off a glance at him.
FLOR
Not all crummy.
Suddenly there is a bit of danger..she rises quickly,
changing mode.
FLOR (CONT'D)
Thank you, good night. I go sleep.
JOHN
Good night..Hey?
She turns..
JOHN (CONT'D)
You speaking English...It's, uh..
FLOR
What?
JOHN
Nothing. Just.... Nice meeting you.
She gulps and exits...as the CAMERA PULLS BACK..ending the
summer at the rented house...as we transition to....
139
139
Through the unusual center window we see Flor and Cristina.
Flor, at this moment, is assimilating against every fiber in
her body. Cristina is excited, certain her life is taking an
incandescent turn. Quite a contrast.
140
140
As the bus stops...Bernice is across the street, along with
some other kids and Deborah, who is wearing her running
clothes..Flor and Cristina exit the bus...
91.
BERNICE
(calling)
You just made it...I was getting
worried..
Deborah has a backpack loaded with books which she hands to
Cristina..
DEBORAH
I picked up your books yesterday..
(by way of explanation to
Flor)
This is one of Bernie's
old..ancient backpacks.
Cristina taking it...
CRISTINA
Oh, thank you..
As she shoulders it and almost falls over..
CRISTINA (CONT'D)
(impressed with the heft)
This is a great school.
DEBORAH
(to Cristina)
I got you a little first-day-at-a-
new-school present...
A school bus appears and heads toward them putting a certain
deadline pressure on the transaction.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
It's from me and....Bernice.
(to Flor)
Okay? It is a big day.
Flor's uncertain reaction is taken as a yes.
BERNICE
(dry)
What did we get her?
Deborah hands Cristina a locket..then, noting Flor's
expression.
DEBORAH
(to Cristina)
It's from ALL of us. Your mother
too.
FLOR
(to Cristina)
It's not from me...
92.
Deborah does a good-natured "TAKE" accepting Flor's reaction
as if it where an eccentricity..As Cristina and Bernice board
the bus, Cristina generally says goodbye to both women,
thereby depriving Flor of her own moment of passage with her
daughter.
DEBORAH
Have a great year, girls..
(for Flor)
This is so great. It fills your
heart, doesn't it?
Deborah turns and sees Flor has already started doggedly up
the hill..
141
141
Walking up the hill, blinking in disbelief at her own
fury..Deborah in the background feeling a bit abandoned..Flor
keeps walking toward the camera..
NARRATOR
There is a terrible crisis which
comes when your own personality is
not equal to the challenge you
face. When being who you are no
longer works.
Deborah has started to jog. As she approaches Flor, she calls
for a clear path well in advance.
DEBORAH
Left...left.
Flor does not alter course though she does start to walk
faster...
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Left...left...
Deborah is close behind now.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
LEFT!
Suddenly, Flor breaks into a run..She is lithe and quick.
ON DEBORAH...
A blink of confusion...then something resembling innate
satisfaction as she quickens her gait and...the Race is on.
ANGLE AS DEBORAH DRAWS ABREAST OF FLOR.
Strangely, she is interpreting this as closeness. She is
genuinely warm.
93.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
(to Flor)
Why am I not surprised you're
competitive?
Deborah looks up the street at a delivery truck.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Oh, they're delivering my table.
Flor stays on task ..forces her stride. She just needs to win
so very much..that's all..to her current surprise, that's
everything...
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
You are fast.. Better pace yourself
though..
Flor, even more upset and provoked by the words now lets it
all out...
ON DEBORAH..
Realizing she may not be a certain winner...she is concerned
as she goes after the rabbit.
OTHER ANGLE.
Showing the delivery truck as finish line in the distance...
VARIOUS SHOTS..
Flor fueled by desperation. Deborah, relentlessly gaining,
exhilarated.
THE FINISH..
Decidedly anti-climactic..Deborah draws even -- passes her--
arrives at the house with a large margin of victory.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
(calling back)
I love you for trying.
142
142
She exits into her home.
ON FLOR..
Bent over, hands on knees, sweaty, gasping for breath. Flor
finally straightens up and, there being no other course,
continues her walk up the hill, to work.
NARRATOR
When people exist under one roof, a
tiny society forms..the stuff of

unconsciously dancing in lock step

traumas converge.

Bernice sitting amidst Cristina and two other golden girls as
they arrive at the Clasky home.
NARRATOR
I was with my friends who had
helped me understand real optimism.
As they pull in the driveway. Cristina and her friends exit
the car and squeal loudly at each other with the excitement
of having it all. Bernice exits last. She is not squealing.

HER POV...
Deborah somewhat dolled up moving through the interior of the
house..

As Deborah leaves the house in a hurry.
EVELYN
(calling out)
Wait!
Deborah turns, startled.
EVELYN (CONT'D)
I need to talk to you privately,
honey.
DEBORAH
"Honey?"-- Can't now, Mom...I'm
late..I was looking all over for
you...keep an eye on the kids. You
know my secret cell number.
EVELYN
Just give me a moment to talk
here..
DEBORAH
What is it? Are you buzzed?
EVELYN
No. I gave up drinking weeks ago.
(on Deborah's reaction)
Yes. Nobody noticed -- which shows
I probably conducted myself pretty
well as a drunk. But duty called
and I'm sober so may I say just one
thing.
DEBORAH
One thing..go ahead...
EVELYN
Thanks..Deborah, you're going to
lose your husband and you'll never
find someone as good. There will
only be men who you know are cheap
and shallow and have no real warmth
in their souls. You may have gotten
by on those surfaces once but now
you've been spoiled by a good man
and you can no longer glide on such
thin ice. If you do not act
quickly you will soon cement an
awful fate for yourself. A life,
with no hope of repair, which has
already begun to turn desperate and
dumb. That's it. Drive safely.
She grabs a deep breath and then turns and walks to the
house.
97.
EVELYN (CONT'D)
(to herself)
If we're out of coffee, it's over
for me.
Suddenly a sharp horn is heard..Evelyn jumps..then turns to
see her daughter calling to her from the driver's seat of the
SUV..
DEBORAH
You've done it again, Mom, made me
hate myself..One of the things I
can count on..
EVELYN
Honey, lately your low self-esteem
is just good common sense.
Deborah considers that last thought for a long beat before
she drives off..
DISSOLVE TO:
150
150
Flor walking from the beginning of the hill........She looks
off to see John's vehicle approaching..She brightens..
ON JOHN..
Who doesn't see her..We can see his car's digital clock
reading 11:30.
ON FLOR..
As he drives past her.
151
153
As Flor enters the Clasky House...
102.
154
158
John is at the car but Flor heads for the gate.
JOHN
(as decisive as we've seen
him)
I'm taking you.
FLOR
(with anger)
Why?!?
JOHN
Because if I don't -- I'll worry
about you and I can't handle that
right now, okay?
Flor emits a crooning sound.
FLOR
Ahhhhh.
(stunned and worried)
I never made that sound over a man
before..
105.
Flor shudders at her own sappiness as John opens the
passenger door for her...very much into his own torture he
nonetheless grabs her arm and guides her up and in..she
catches and appreciates his automatic gracious manners while
he is clearly fucked up...She is impatient with his
solicitousness almost slapping his hands away as he makes
sure her skirt doesn't get crushed in the door..The
frustration roiling in her.
FLOR (CONT'D)
Please!?! Mandiln.
OTHER ANGLE..
Deborah watching them...
HER POV.
Her cuckolded husband closing the door behind her gorgeous,
soon-to-be ex-housekeeper.
CLOSE ON DEBORAH..
She trembles under the force of imminent justice.
159
160
As she leaves the car and goes into a drug store. John, sober
faced, looks at Flor making an attractive and zestful beeline
toward an Hispanic market. This could be where it hits him
that he's on a date...If so..it's too late to duck..
161
162
As she runs back to the car.
163
171
Moving camera...the small house turned restaurant..little
flickers of light...
NARRATOR
My mother never told me the details
of her visit to the restaurant.
But she often referred to it as the
greatest conversation of her life.
172
MORNING.
178
Flor purposefully walking up the hill..
179
180
Evelyn, Bernice and Georgie are in the pool..Cristina,
wearing a bathing suit, is on a chaise reading...
CRISTINA
Hey, mom...Is it okay if we don't
leave right away?
The others call greetings..save Evelyn who studies the
situation and gets out of the pool..Flor is awkward..no idea
how to handle this...so she goes direct.
123.
FLOR
No...
(as Cristina begins to
protest)
No..and we must say "goodbye." I
don't work here anymore.
She then talks Spanish to Cristina..admonishing her not to
embarrass them..something about Flor being prepared to go
nuts all over her daughter if she hurts their dignity...but
it is said with total calm.
GEORGIE
Do I have to get out?
FLOR
No, Georgie..Stay. I think you are
a wonderful boy..be good..like you
are. There are no monsters.
GEORGIE
Thanks..thanks. Okay.
Bernice climbs out of the pool. Meanwhile, a flabbergasted
Cristina is staring at her mom who gives quiet two and three
word proddings in Spanish.
BERNICE
(severely to Georgie)
I can't believe you didn't get out.
GEORGIE
Flor said.
BERNICE
(to Flor)
I don't want to get you wet.
FLOR
Get me wet.
BERNICE
(rushing to hug her)
Thanks.
Bernice hugs her. Evelyn hugs Cristina..
EVELYN
You...are...a...trip.
FLOR
(to Bernice)
You're a beauty. Amazing girl.
124.
Despite herself, Bernice starts to cry..moans to herself over
the display...Now, in the background, we hear a subliminal
human voice. Incrementally it will grow louder and be
recognizable as Deborah calling Flor from the master bedroom
window..Bit by bit, the others will become aware of this as
Flor ignores it...Bernice goes to embrace Cristina.
BERNICE
My last chance to have some of you
rub off on me..
(Cristina doesn't
understand)
I'm sorry you're so sad but this
could have been so much worse.
CRISTINA
(from her depths)
How?
And now Deborah calling "Flor" is getting hard to ignore but
Flor manages..
EVELYN
(to Cristina)
Why don't you run upstairs and say
goodbye to Deborah?
Flor flashes a look of thanks.
FLOR
I'll be in front.
Upset, Cristina runs off. She kisses Bernice..and walks
toward the house. As she passes under the bedroom..
DEBORAH
Please come see me.
And then a crying Cristina appears on the deck. Flor glances
up and keeps moving underneath the deck where she faintly
hears the beginning of their exchange
DEBORAH'S VOICE
It's okay, honey..we'll see each
other at school..I'm going to keep
an eye on you..I will.
Flor enters the house...
181
183
As she exits the house and moves to the gate where she
punches in the exit code...
ANGLE ON GATE
As it swings open to reveal John...
184
184
As she moves alongside him and the gate closes behind her.
JOHN
I was hanging out here waiting.
Can't give you guys a lift?
Flor shakes her head "no." She looks away for a beat so the
next thing she does is a considered action. She leans forward
and kisses him on the lips. John looks at her.
JOHN (CONT'D)
This is killer.
(on her confusion)
Incredibly hard.
FLOR
Yes, Cari..
The gate opens and a sniffling Cristina is holding an armful
of loot.
JOHN
(reading Flor)
Let her have it..party favors.
127.
She nods..bites back some emotion and turns from him.
FLOR
Cristina..
CRISTINA
Goodbye, Mr. Clasky..I am very
sorry we will not see each other as
frequently.
She offers her hand, which John shakes while patting her on
the back.
FLOR
Yes.
They turn and begin walking down the street.
SHOT - STONE CANYON
The women walking toward camera, John briefly in the
background...As they begin their walk Flor begins talking in
Spanish.
NARRATOR
The first minute we were alone, my
mother told me that I would no
longer go to the private school.
CRISTINA
No. No..You can't. I won't be able
to forgive you..It will be the end.
I won't let you.
And then Cristina moves her hysterics to Spanish as she stops
walking and her mother takes her hand and pulls her along
with enormous dedication. CAMERA BEGINS A PULL BACK.
Cristina dropping presents..picking them up..one of them left
by the wayside..People noticing..Cristina's conduct violating
tacit zoning laws.
CLOSER SHOT..
So we can see their faces in the struggle.
185
185
As they wait...Flor talks sharply to Cristina to control
herself.
NARRATOR
My mother changed our lives once
more. This time because she saw in
me, to her great alarm, a character
flaw of some size. She has taught
me to be a watch dog of my
character, to control my ambition.
I am not quite there.
128.
One last yelp from Cristina as the bus arrives.
