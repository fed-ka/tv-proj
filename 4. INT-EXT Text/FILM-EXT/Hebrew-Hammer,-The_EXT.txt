We start on JESUS ON A CRUCIFIX, and then violently CRANE
down to reveal MORDECHAI (10), a timid little Hasidic boy
standing nervously at the foot of the statue.
Behind Morty is a wall with the graffiti phrase "HANUKKAH IS
4 HOMOS" scrawled across it. He clutches his Sandy Koufax
lunchbox tightly as he looks off into the distance. He's got
quite a large bulge in his pants for a child his age.
We see a menacing, EXTREMELY WIDE ANGLE shot of the school.
Superimposed over the picture are the words, "ST. PETER,
PAUL, AND MARY PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL."
Mordechai takes a deep breath, and walks towards the school.
Mordechai walks past a row of bleachers occupied by FOUR
GENTILE CHILDREN.
GENTILE BOY 1
Hey Mordechai, look. I dropped a penny.
He drops a penny. The other children cackle.
The Gentile Girl next to him holds up a bag of bagels.
GENTILE GIRL 1
Hey Mordechai. Want a bagel?
Gentile Boy 1 feigns choking.
GENTILE BOY 2
Hey Jew nose, save some oxygen for us.
More laughter. Morty attempts to take it all in stride. We
PUSH into GENTILE GIRL 2, a severe looking puritanically
dressed child as she turns to face the camera.
GENTILE GIRL 2
Hey Morty, my mom says that unless your
people wise up and accept Jesus Christ as
your lord and savior you're all going to
burn in hell.
Dead silence. The other children exchange "Now that went a
little over the line" looks.
The silence is broken by the sound of the SCHOOLBELL. Morty
gathers himself, and walks off.
A sullen Mordechai wanders the streets. Absurd XMAS
DECORATIONS, horrific in their appearance blanket the street.
Morty glances a GROTESQUE FAUX REINDEER with fangs. We hear a
growling noise as it lights up. He walks quickly away in fear
past...
A STOREFRONT
We track with Morty as he passes a storefront window. Inside,
the CLERK turns a sign outwards reading, "JEWS NOT WELCOME."
We continue with Morty as he passes by a second storefront. A
similar sign reading, "KYKES GO HOME" is turned outwards by
ANOTHER CLERK. He continues past yet another building as a
sign reading, "MONOTHEISTS NEED NOT APPLY" is displayed by a
THIRD CLERK for Morty's benefit.
Morty looks across the street.
A sign hangs from a storefront reading "JEWS OK FOR ABOUT 5
MINUTES." The FOURTH CLERK gives him the thumbs up.
Morty finds a spot on the sidewalk outside the building and
pulls out his dreidel.
He spins it, and we hold on the spinning top for a few beats
as Morty stares at in wonderment.
Suddenly, a huge black boot comes crashing down into frame
and smashes the little dreidel. Mordechai slowly looks up.
A menacing SANTA CLAUS gives him the finger, and exits frame
as we hear him sadistically laugh O.S. the words "Ho, ho, ho"
at Morty.
We start CLOSE on Mordechai. Rage fills every inch of his
face. As we SLOWLY CRANE AWAY, the opening CREDITS begin as
the HEBREW HAMMER THEME SONG kicks into full gear.
CUT TO:
TITLE SEQUENCE
As the Jewxploitation music pumps, metallic slashes rip
through the screen line by line, spinning into place to form
a Star Of David. The title, "The Hebrew Hammer" SLAMS into
frame.
TITLE CARD: HANUKKAH PRESENT
We start CLOSE on a gift wrapped Hanukkah present. We pull
back a bit as MORDECHAI JEFFERSON CARVER (29), AKA THE HEBREW
HAMMER, a baaad Jewish brother spins the package in his hands
as he saunters down the street past a latke stand. He's a
Semitic super stud straight out of a 70's Blaxploitation
flick. He tosses the gift to MACCABEE, a young Hasidic boy.
HAMMER
Happy Hanukkah Maccabee.
Macabee tears open the wrapping paper and holds up the gift -
a Hebrew Hammer action figure. He beams.
We cut back to the Hammer as he smiles back. From O.C., we
hear Maccabee say...
MACCABEE (O.C.)
Thanks Hammer!
The Hammer smiles back and walks off frame.
ANOTHER PART OF THE CHOOD
We begin on the Hammer's black boots and slowly TILT up as we
DOLLY back with him.
The Hammer passes a line of THREE JEWISH PRINCESSES who swoon
as he passes.
He stops below the sign of a butcher shop that reads, "100%
KOSHER MEAT." We PUSH into his CLOSE UP as he blows them all
a kiss.
The pubic area of their dresses moisten in synchrony.
The Hammer winks back.
An OLD WOMAN calls to the Hammer from the window of a second
story flat.
OLD WOMAN
Hammer, why don't you come eat by us for
Shabat. My Miriam is all grown up now.
God willing, you should settle down and
marry.
We punch in to a CLOSE UP of a demure Miriam as the Hammer
takes stock of the goods. She is an atrociously ugly girl
wearing orthodontic headgear, and bespectacled with a pair
oversized librarian's glasses.
The Hammer shakes off his wave of nausea.
HAMMER
Thanks for the invite Mrs. Kleinman, but
right now G dash d's the only one for me.
OLD WOMAN
I can dig it.
The Hammer continues on down the street. The old woman and
Miriam are framed in the BG.
OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)
Hammer, you're the baaddest Hebe this
side of Tel Aviv.
The Hammer stops for a second and smiles at the compliment.
HAMMER
(To himself)
Shabat Shalom!
He walks off frame.
Some TEENAGE GENTILE BOYS play keep away with a yarmulke
belonging to SHLOMO, another young Hasidic kid.
SHLOMO
Give it back! Give me back my yarmulke!
TEENAGE GENTILE
Hey Teddy, throw me the frisbee.
TEDDY (the non-speaking teen Gentile) throws the yarmulke,
and we FOLLOW it as it spins towards another TEENAGE GENTILE.
The other Teenage Gentile excitedly extends his hands to
catch, but right before it reaches him another hand comes
into frame and snatches it. He looks up, and we cut to his...
POV as we tilt up to reveal The Hammer. He looks pretty damn
big and pissed off from this angle.
The Teenage Gentile
begins to shake and stammer.
TEENAGE GENTILE (CONT'D)
We...we were going to give it back. I
swear to god.
HAMMER
Did you just take god's name in vain?
TEENAGE GENTILE
No, no. It...It's not like that. We were
just about...
HAMMER
Just about to leave, right?
TEENAGE GENTILE
Yeah, yeah, that's right. We were just
about to leave. C'mon Teddy.
The two run off.
The Hammer looks down to Shlomo. His spirit seems broken.
HAMMER
You alright?
SHLOMO
I guess. Sometimes I wonder why I even
bother praying to one god.
HAMMER
Hey, hey! Be proud of who you are. You're
a bad, bold, big-nosed, biblical brother.
You feelin' me?
The kid's morale is boosted.
SHLOMO
Yeah. You're right.
HAMMER
Aveenooh Shalom Alechem little brother.
The Hammer pounds his fist into his chest ala the Black
Panthers. The kid returns the gesture.
SHLOMO
Thanks Hammer.
The Hammer points at him as he leaves.
HAMMER
Stay Jewish.
The Hammer walks up the stairs and past the sign advertising
his office.
The Hammer theme music winds down, punctuated with Shaft-like
brass hits. However, the brass hits become incredibly
overblown and extraneous.
The Hammer walks back into frame from the stairway to his
office. He looks around strangely for the source of the
music.
An establishing shot of Santa's Workshop. The lettering
"NORTH POLE - SANTA'S WORKSHOP" is superimposed over the
picture.
A building resembling the Pentagon with the exception that
it's shaped like the Star Of David. Superimposed over the
picture are the words, "JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE."
We start on the outside of the front door as we hear the Ding
of the doorbell. MRS. CARVER, the epitome of Jewish
motherhood opens the door.
For all the Gentiles reading, I thought I might digress for
just a moment. JEWISH MOTHER (adj.) A complicated and
charismatic package of the following qualities rolled into
human female form: intense, judgmental, overbearing,
manipulative, lacking boundaries, yet fiercely involved,
loving, and protective of her children. Got it?
MRS. CARVER
Mordechai! Shabat Shalom!
The Hammer pulls a bottle of wine out from a paper bag.
HAMMER
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some
Manischewitz. The black label.
MRS. CARVER
I can see. And you also brought a nice
girl to come eat by us.
Mrs. Carver forcefully grabs Esther into an embrace
resembling a bear hug, and begins to plaster her with sloppy
kisses. Esther is visibly overwhelmed by it all as the
kissing and embracing continue for a bit too long.
Mrs. Carver places her tongue into Esther's ear canal as a
sign of affection, forcing Esther to break the embrace. Mrs.
Carver and Esther look at one another strangely for an
awkward few moments.
MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)
So. Do you have a name?
ESTHER
It's Esther.
MRS. CARVER
(She sighs ferclempt)
From the story of Purim.
(To Hammer)
Well, now that we're all acquainted,
let's sit down and start the Sabbath.
CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: 4 HOURS LATER
"JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - SUNDAY - 0800 Hrs - Year 5734" is
typed out sequentially over the image of the building.
The exterior resembles any walled private residence with a
front gate. The Hammer stands in front of the large, metallic
Star Of David vault-like gate and pushes the button next to
it. A COMPUTERIZED VOICE begins...
COMPUTERIZED VOICE
Jew Confirmation Test initiated.
He's clearly irritated by this.
HAMMER
You've gotta be kidding me. They're still
doing this?
COMPUTERIZED VOICE
Please state your full Hebrew name.
HAMMER
Mordechai Baruch Netanyahoo.
The vault-like gate slides open in a futuristic manner, and
the Hammer steps in. The gate shuts behind him, and he finds
himself in an all white room. A microphone is placed by
another massive door directly in front of him.
COMPUTERIZED VOICE
Please state the six dishes found on the
Passover Seder plate in alphabetical
order?
HAMMER
Beitzah, Charoset, Chazeret, Karpas,
Maror, and Zeroa.
The second door slides open, and Morty steps forward into the
next room. Inside this room lies a single violin in a case.
COMPUTERIZED VOICE
Please demonstrate musical aptitude.
The Hammer picks up the violin and begins to play 'Hava
Nagila.' He's pretty damn good at it. The next door slides
open, and Hammer steps forward into yet another room.
A drape, about four feet high off the floor, is stretched
into a semi-circle against the wall of the room.
COMPUTERIZED VOICE (CONT'D)
Please step forward and remove your
undergarments.
The Hammer steps inside the drape, and drops his pants.
A panel on the wall opens, and a metal probe heads for his
shmekel. He is clearly uncomfortable with this bit of
testing.
HAMMER
Oooh. That's cold.
COMPUTERIZED VOICE
Circumcision confirmed.
The door slides open, and the Hammer quickly pulls his pants
up as he steps into the next room. The room is completely
empty with the exception of a one way mirror on the front
wall by the door.
COMPUTERIZED VOICE (CONT'D)
Final test initiated.
Nothing happens. The Hammer waits a few seconds, but quickly
becomes agitated.
HAMMER
Hello? Can anybody hear me? I think this
machine is broken or something. Hello?
(To himself)
This is ridiculous! I didn't even want to
come here. I shlep all the way out to the
middle of nowhere, for lord knows what
purpose, and...
We cut to the OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR. The Chief observes
the Hammer as he continues to whine. Next to them, a METER
with the label "WHINING SCALE" slowly grows in magnitude as
the Hammer continues to rant. The meter bars go from red to
yellow in color.
HAMMER (CONT'D)
I am so unhappy with this situation. Why
Mordechai? Why do you always feel it
necessary to do what other people want
you to do? Why can't you be your own
man...
CHIEF
Come on. Come on.
The meter bars switch from yellow to green, finally passing
the '0
- Jewish' mark.
CHIEF (CONT'D)
(To himself)
He's still got it.
Back inside with the Hammer, the doors slide open, revealing
the Chief to the Hammer.
CHIEF (CONT'D)
Welcome back Hammer.
CUT TO:
We see various shots of the Hammer's Caddy. The grill, the
white wall tires, the fuzzy dreidel hanging from the rear
view mirror, etc. Very 'Superfly.'
We start on an incredibly impressive looking building. Over
this we see the words "KWANZAA LIBERATION FRONT" typed out
sequentially. The camera than tilts down to reveal a Popeye's
Chicken.
A BLACK TEENAGER scouts the street with a pair of binoculars.
BINOCULAR POV - Instead of the usual two circles, we see the
world through two cutouts of the African continent. The
Hammer's Caddy pulls up.
BLACK TEENAGER
Oh shit!
The teen runs inside.
The Hammer's Caddy pulls up to a stop right at camera, giving
us a full view of the license plate. It reads, "LCHAIM."
The Hammer's Caddy drives past a sneaky looking SALVATION
NAVY GUY. We do your standard BLAXPLOITATION ZOOM into him as
he begins to speak into the lapel of his uniform.
HARD CORE PUNK music pours out from the inside of the bar.
The Hammer walks into frame and looks up at the sign. He
curiously notes the ASTRO TURF spread across the pavement,
and then makes his way for the front door.
A WIDE SHOT of the bar. The camera is STATIONARY. We hear the
sound of SHOTGUNS BLASTING and then the sounds of intense
FIGHTING. A few seconds of the fighting sounds pass.
Suddenly, the front doors bust open and a few bloodied
Skinheads fall out onto the ground, followed by the Hammer.
He's untouched, and he carries the bottle of Manischewitz in
one hand and a shotgun in the other.
He stops in the MIDGROUND, and pours the Manischewitz out on
the astroturf lawn in a methodical manner.
He approaches FOREGROUND, and pulls out something from his
jacket pocket.
We see a CU of the same matchbook the elf gave him. "DUKE'S -
WHERE SKIN IS IN."
He lights a match and tosses it over his shoulder. We hear
the sounds of bursting flames.
The Hammer puts his sunglasses on, and walks straight past
the camera.
We pull back into a SPINNING OVERHEAD to reveal flames in the
shape of the STAR OF DAVID burning on the lawn.
FADE TO BLACK.
PUSHERMAN MONTAGE
Curtis Mayfield's 'Pusherman' FADES UP, and we cut into a
STILL PHOTO of Tiny Tim with his arms around two Hasidic boys
in an a alley. The SCREEN DIVIDES INTO THIRDS as we see CU's
of each character smiling. Stills are constantly replaced in
time with the music. We see a still of MONEY BEING EXCHANGED,
then HANDS BEING SHAKEN. Then a still of a VIDEOCASSETTE
BEING PLACED INTO A VCR, A HASIDIC KID WATCHING THE TV, etc.
The music continues as we...
CUT TO:
The Hammer's Caddy cruises slowly down the street.
The Hammer dials a number on the payphone. As he dials, he
verbalizes the number he's calling.
HAMMER
555-55-555-55555...
The Hammer struggles with the last number, but then quickly
remembers.
HAMMER (CONT'D)
...5.
It rings once, and then we hear the other line pick up.
We see a non-descript door in the middle of a brick wall. Two
turnstiles stand directly in front of the door. We can hear
the muffled sounds of the gospel version of "Let My People
Go." Scribbled on the wall is the graffiti phrase, "HANUKKAH
NOW!"
The door opens, and the obnoxiously loud music spills out
into the street. The Hammer and Esther exit, close the door,
and push their way past the turnstiles into the alley.
HAMMER
That got annoying fairly quickly.
ESTHER
Yeah, no kidding.
A CARNIVAL WORKER stands behind a makeshift 'Underground
Jewish Railroad' booth.
CARNIVAL WORKER
Tickets please.
The two hand the Carnival Worker their tickets.
CARNIVAL WORKER (CONT'D)
Thanks for riding the Underground Jewish
Railroad. If you plan on returning today,
please make sure to get you hands stamped
before you leave the alley.
HAMMER
Nah, we're kosher. Thanks though.
The two walk past him. Esther turns to the Hammer.
ESTHER
So, now what?
HAMMER
Now we wait for Santa to make his next
move.
He gives her a once over. She is stunning.
HAMMER (CONT'D)
Want to get a drink?
ESTHER
Sure. Why not.
Your typical Blaxploitation bar. It could easily pass for the
Lenox Lounge in Harlem, with the exception of the large
menorah shaped sign out front.
The sun rises over the city.
A STOCK FOOTAGE shot of an airplane landing. SUPERIMPOSED
OVER THE IMAGE are the words, "BEN GURION AIRPORT - ISRAEL."
ISRAELI WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
Shalom. Welcome to the Ben Gurion
airport. For ground transportation,
please proceed to Terminal 18.
We cut to the Hammer who's watching this stock footage of the
airplane landing on a TELEVISION SET by the "CHERTZ" car
rental counter.
HIGHWAY - DAY
70's road music occupies the soundtrack as we see a shot of
the fast moving pavement of the open road. Slowly, we PULL
BACK to reveal the Hammer throttling a monstrous HARLEY
CHOPPER MOTORCYCLE.
The Hammer's Talis flaps wildly in the wind. His Shtreml
helmet is strapped on tight over his goggles.
The scenery, oddly enough, resembles the Mojave Desert.
We cut to a sign reading "THE WEST BANK PALMS: A GATED
COMMUNITY. COMING SOON!" On it, we see an illustration of a
housing compound surrounded by a remarkable amount of BARBED
WIRE.
We PAN over to the highway as the Hammer zips past on his
motorcycle.
HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS
Tucked out of sight behind a billboard, Esther pulls off from
her side of the road and onto the highway in pursuit of the
Hammer. And yes, the car is lowered, with white walled tires.
The camera makes it way up to reveal a large ROADSIDE
BILLBOARD ARROW, resembling the ones you might see
advertising casinos on the drive into Vegas announces "THE
JEWISH ATOMIC CLOCK. 20 Kilometers."
CUT TO:
From the outside the J.A.C has the appearance of an
observatory. For no apparent reason, a small MOTORCYCLE RAMP
sits near the front door.
A single Fed-Y truck pulls into the dirt parking lot.
A gang of THUG ELVES spill out of the back of the truck as a
S.W.A.T. team would.
HEAD ELF
Go, go, go!
The Head Elf jumps out, and out of frame.
CUT TO:
An ELF FLUNKY stand by a SMALL MOTORCYCLE RAMP, studying it
curiously. The Head Elf walks into frame.
HEAD ELF (CONT'D)
What's this doing here?
ELF FLUNKY
Not sure. I think it was left over from
an Israeli Robbie Kneivel television
special. You want me to get rid of it?
HEAD ELF
No time. Besides, it's not like someone's
gonna jump their motorcycle into the
building while we're inside.
The HEAD THUG ELF points up towards the sky.
HEAD ELF (CONT'D)
There's Santa now.
The Thug Elves look up to the sky, and we do an OVERHEAD PUSH
DOWN ON THEM as helicopter force winds blow their hats off.
The carriage of SANTA'S SLEIGH touches down on the ground.
Tiny Tim sits shotgun in the sleigh while Santa vomits
violently over the other side. Santa finishes up, and wipes
his mouth with his hand.
TINY TIM
You okay?
SANTA
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the
hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
TINY TIM
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
Santa takes this in.
CUT TO:
Santa paces as a Drill Sargent would in front of the line of
harnessed reindeer. They're shivering in their hooves.
SANTA
Who's the leader of this operation?
More scared reindeer faces. Comet furtively motions towards
Rudolph with his antlers. Santa sees this, marches quickly up
to Rudolph, and gets in his face.
SANTA (CONT'D)
What's your major malfunction, dumbfuck!?
Rudolph's scared shitless.
SANTA (CONT'D)
Step forward son!
Rudolph attempts to move forward, but the harness attachments
prevent him from doing so.
TINY TIM
Uh, he can't sir. The harnesses.
You can feel the Robert Deniro-esque intensity boiling inside
of Santa.
SANTA
You gonna learn to guide this sled right?
You gonna make sure your men follow suit?
Because if I'm puking down chimneys come
Christmas Eve, I'm gonna have your hide.
We clear?
Rudolph shakes his head. The bells on his harness tinkle.
Santa continues to stare down the reindeer as he walks away.
Rudolph is clearly broken, but continues staring back at
Santa as he makes his way out of frame. The expression on
Rudolph's face changes from fear to insolence as he angrily
follows the O.S. Santa.
Suddenly, Santa charges right back into frame, and places his
drawn gun to Rudolph's temple.
SANTA (CONT'D)
You eyeballin' me son!?
Rudolph quickly looks away. Santa puts his gun back into his
belt, and then adjusts his suit and hat as if to regain his
composure.
Without warning, Santa throws a fake punch at Rudolph's face,
forcing the reindeer to flinch.
SANTA (CONT'D)
I didn't think so.
The Hammer is moments away from the J.A.C. compound. He spots
the motorcycle ramp, and then guns his engine. He's close!
The Hammer and Mo crawl onto the snow covered bluff
overlooking Santa's Workshop. With his binoculars, the Hammer
scopes out the compound below.
BINOCULAR POV - Instead of your standard two circles filling
the screen, we see the world through a pair of Star Of
Davids. The place resembles the exterior of an industrial
warehouse, with two Elves on guard with guns.
HAMMER
It's gonna be tough, but the back
entrance looks like our best bet.
MOHAMMED
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to
pinpoint the exact location of Santa's
workshop? We've been trying to gain that
piece of surveillance for years.
The Hammer puts the binoculars down.
HAMMER
This is the year 5734. It's time the boys
at the KLF got into the 58th century. Let
me show you something.
The Hammer pulls out a LAPTOP COMPUTER.
HAMMER (CONT'D)
The JDL supplies all its agents with this
state of the art device called a laptop
computator.
MOHAMMED
Cool. What's it do?
HAMMER
Now this might get a bit technical, but
try and stay with me. Using a highly
sophisticated connection of other
computators, called the Internet, I can
access surveillance maps, villian
biographical information, and even sports
scores with a few simple keystrokes of
this electronic typewriter.
The Hammer makes a few keystrokes and turns the screen
towards Mo.
MOHAMMED
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
HAMMER
But wait, there's more. With a few swift
clicks of this hand-computer interface,
commonly referred to as a mouse, I can
download illicit pornographic material
and even send it along to a friend via a
cyber postal route known as e-mail.
Mo's interest is seriously peaked.
MOHAMMED
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get
porno on that thing?
HAMMER
Oh yeah. Take a look.
The Hammer does some computing.
HAMMER (CONT'D)
For example, here's a picture of your
sister Tawanda getting freaky with a
German Shepard.
Mo's eyes widen.
MOHAMMED
Gettin' freaky with a what?
He grabs the laptop from the Hammer and looks at the screen.
A picture of TAWANDA making out with a GERMAN man decked out
in lederhosen on a rural German hillside. The two are
surrounded by sheep.
Mo gives a sigh of relief.
MOHAMMED (CONT'D)
Oy vey, that's almost as bad. That's
Tawanda getting freaky with a notorious
white supremacist.
Mo goes for the keyboard.
MOHAMMED (CONT'D)
Where's the white out button on this
thing?
We get a CU of the ENTER KEY as Mo presses it. A SOOTHING
COMPUTERIZED FEMALE VOICE purrs...
COMPUTERIZED FEMALE VOICE
Message sent.
MOHAMMED
What just happened?
HAMMER
Remember that bit about the cyber postal
route?
MOHAMMED
Yeah.
The Hammer looks at the blissfully ignorant Mo with empathy.
HAMMER
Nah, forget about it.
The Hammer wears Tefilon, consisting of leather straps with
boxes, wrapped around his head and arms. He silently bows his
head in front of the gigantic wall as he mumbles something to
himself. Mo nervously scans the area for guards.
MOHAMMED
What are you doing?
HAMMER
Just praying to god that we don't kill
ourselves going over this wall.
The Hammer unwraps his leather straps, and then tosses them
high over the wall.
The boxes on the straps catch on a pipe. The line is pulled
taut, and the boxes hold secure against the pipe.
The Hammer and Mo begin to scale the wall a la the 60's
Batman and Robin television show. The Hammer leads the way
while Mo, directly behind him, has his arms wrapped tightly
around his waist. The Hammer stops climbing for a second, and
turns to him.
HAMMER (CONT'D)
You know, you don't have to hold on to my
waist. You're tied in.
Mo releases his arms from the Hammer's waist. Indeed, he is
tied in.
MOHAMMED
I knew that.
LATER
The Hammer and Mo drop from the wall onto the ground. The
Hammer looks around.
No guards in sight. In front of them is door clearly marked
"BACK DOOR."
MOHAMMED
Well, that was easy.
Mo heads for the door. The Hammer calls to him.
HAMMER
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know
that my research has determined that
Santa's compound is wired with the XP
2000 stereo type alarm system.
MOHAMMED
A stereo type alarm system?
HAMMER
Take a look.
The Hammer points to above the door. Sure enough, there sit
TWO LARGE STEREO SPEAKERS.
MOHAMMED
How do we bypass it?
HAMMER
The alarm will trigger if the system
detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies
inside the building. For example, if you
were to dribble a basketball, or eat
watermelon, or use the word dawg...that
is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the
letter o...within the confines of this
workshop, the alarm would sound.
This pisses Mo off.
MOHAMMED
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I
hate the taste of watermelon and am a
terrible basketball player.
HAMMER
Well that's good news for us. It means
the system is outdated. This should be
easy. C'mon.
The two enter through the door.
