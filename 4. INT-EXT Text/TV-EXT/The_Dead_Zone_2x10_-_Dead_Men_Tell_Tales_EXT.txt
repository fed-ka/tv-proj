          MINUTES LATER

          As Manny opens it to reveal a long bag zippered down the
          middle.  Manny UNZIPS the bag and folds back the flaps,
            revealing the corpse of MICKEY DOYLE -- the shooter from
          Johnny's vision.

                                        FITZ
                        This the guy you saw?

          Johnny stares stunned at the body and let's face it, people
          like Johnny and you and I don't come face to face with
          dead bodies very often and we should play it that way. 
          He nods 'yes.'

                                        FITZ
                        Name's Mickey Doyle.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What... happened?

                                        FITZ
                        Exactly what you said was gonna
                        happen.  Up to a point.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This... this was not what I
                          expected...

                                        MANNY
                                (not at all a joke)
                        Yeah.  It's not what Mickey
                          expected either.

                                        FITZ
                        But your description fit him to a
                        'T'.  So when he came in, we were
                          ready...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (stomach churning)
                        You killed him because I...

                                        MANNY
                        You don't have to worry; we kept
                        your name out of it with the cops
                        so far.  

                                        FITZ
                        As a token of his appreciation,
                        Mr. Donnegal is gonna tear up the
                        bill for the fixtures.  But he
                        does have one more favor to ask
                        of you...

          FADE IN:


          The Ensuite van still in the driveway.  Johnny, Fitz and
          Manny as before.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        By now, I was beginning to realize
                        that Ensuite Bath and Kitchen
                        wasn't your usual plumbing
                          supplier.  Tell me why the Maine
                        mob would advertise in the yellow
                        pages, I don't know but they do.


          CLOSER

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, I... I can't be any more
                          involved in this...

                                        FITZ
                        Mr. Smith, John, my reputation is
                        sort of on the line here... truth
                        is Mr. Donnegal doesn't know what
                        to make of you but I'm a new age
                        kind of guy... I personally put
                        in a good word for you... 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (dubious)
                        Thanks.  But, seriously, I can't...

                                        FITZ
                                  (interrupting, low
                                key)
                        I'd consider it a personal favor
                        if you'd give us your cooperation
                        in this matter.  

          Fitz puts his hand on Johnny's shoulder... as he does --


1212A JOHNNY FLASH - HIS BODY BEING THROWN INTO A SHALLOW
          GRAVE


  1313RESUME JOHNNY

          as he looks at the two gangsters...  For the moment they
          are genial in their demeanor...

    13CONTINUED:13

                                        FITZ
                          I really can't take no for an
                        answer.  
                                (to Manny)
                        Give the man room to work.

          Manny steps aside.  Johnny has no choice, slowly approaches
          the corpse of Mickey Doyle...

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        I don't like touching dead bodies. 
                        Call it a peculiarity of mine. 
                        Usually it takes me somewhere I
                        don't want to go.   

          This is hard for Johnny -- he touches the corpse on the
          cheek... as he does, RAMP TO JOHNNY'S FACE...


  1414VISION - MATCHING FACE

          as a girl's long, slender, bejeweled fingers caress his
          cheeks and pull Johnny who is now Mickey (dressed in the
          same clothes as the day of the shooting) toward a kiss. 

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        Not this time.

          And as we see her for the first time, we might even be in
          SLOW MOTION as her face moves closer to Johnny/Mickey's,
          and her big velvet eyes flutter closed.  In her late
            twenties, she is lit with a glamorous light -- the way an
          old-time movie star might be lit, Lana Turner or Lauren
          Bacall -- and she plants on Johnny/Mickey's lips a kiss
          that neither man will ever forget.  And then she looks at
          him, with eyes that are at once vulnerable and wise, too
          wise, maybe, for her own good.


  1515RESUME JOHNNY AS THE VISION ENDS

          And he can still taste her.  Fitz and Manny can see
            something has happened.

                                        FITZ
                        What'd you see?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He was kissing a girl.  

          The two men wait for more... there is none...

                                        FITZ
                        That's it?

                        That's all I saw.

                                        MANNY
                        At least Mickey got lucky before
                        he passed.

                                        FITZ
                        Touch him again. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        It doesn't work that way.

          Fitz takes Johnny by the hair and shoves him closer to
          the corpse.  Losing his temper for the first time and
          it's scary.

                                        FITZ
                        Put your heart in it.

          Johnny touches Mickey again.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Nothing.    

          Fitz stares at Johnny... extremely displeased... controlled
          fury, murder in his eyes...

                                        FITZ
                          I really can't go back empty
                        handed, John.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        I... need more... his personal
                          things... anything he's touched...

                                        FITZ
                        Fine.  We'll go by Mickey's place.

                        We really got to get the Mick
                        over to the cemetery for a touch
                        up before the service this
                        afternoon.  The coroner really
                        left him in a mess.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Some other time then.

                                (to Manny)
                        We'll take John's car over to
                        Mick's apartment and meet you
                        later.  That okay with you, John?

  2424AT THE GRAVESITE

          Mickey's corpse lies in a closed casket by a freshly dug
          grave.  Fitz is greeting some other old friends.  Johnny
          is under-dressed for the occasion.  Many of the attendees
          look at him with a curious, even suspicious eye -- among
          one group is Manny... who can be overheard confirming
          that --

                                        MANNY
                        Yeah, that's the guy... the guy
                        who told Mr. Donnegal that Mickey
                        was coming for him...

          Johnny feels eyes staring at him... is as uncomfortable
          as he has ever been.


          POV - PEOPLE GETTING OUT OF CARS MOVING ACROSS THE CEMETERY

          And getting out of one stretch limo with Cathan Donnegal
          is the same beautiful woman Johnny's been seeing.  She's
          alone, not crying or close to it, wearing dark sunglasses,
          dressed in black, like most everyone else but Johnny...
          except this is a woman born to wear black... anything
          black... and even in this setting, a man's eyes are
            irresistibly drawn to her...

          As Fitz notices Johnny looking...

                                        FITZ
                          Expensive proposition, John. 
                        Don't get your heart set on
                          anything.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's her.  The girl he was
                          kissing. 

                                        FITZ
                        Nina and Mickey?  Not possible. 
                        There was a certain separation of
                        the classes involved, you know
                        like on the Titanic.

          But as Johnny looks at Fitz, Fitz sees Johnny has no doubt. 
          As Donnegal and NINA approach, Fitz decides to push the
          envelope and introduce Johnny to Nina...

          Donnegal nods uncomfortably at Johnny, avoids a handshake,

    4040STILLSON'S OFFICE -- RESUME

          Now we know where Sonny got the bruise.

          Johnny pushes Sonny's hand away in continuous action...

                                        ELLIMAN (CONT'D)
                        You don't understand the crowd
                        you're involved with.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You mean the crowd you're involved
                        with.

          Stillson takes stock of the situation, nods and back in
          charge, looks to Johnny...

                                        STILLSON
                        The interesting thing about your
                        visions is that you're the only
                        one who can see them, John.

          Johnnny reacts and...



          Johnny gets into a sleek, pearl-colored Cadillac Seville.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        It was the kind of car that Mickey
                        would drive all right... I was
                        getting to know him pretty well
                        by now... you wouldn't find him
                        in one of those imports; straight
                        'A' American from Detroit for  
                        Mickey Doyle.



          The Cadillac passes and as we follow, reveal the same
          sign we saw earlier:

          "Exit 29 -- Stockbridge, Hollow Horn Resort."



          as Johnny is escorted out a back door by the guards...

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        Banned for life.  I knew Bruce
                        would be heartbroken.

          Johnny thinks a beat... and looks around him... this is
          the place he saw the fight between Elliman and Mickey...
          just as he realizes that and takes a few steps through
          the same space... RAMP TO HIS FACE...

                                        ELLIMAN (O.S.)
                        You know what I'd love to do. 
                        I'd love to buy you dinner.

          Johnny looks to the voice and a sharp pan to --


  6767THE SAME LOCATION - NIGHT 

          Nina and Elliman have just exited the casino through the
          same door.

                        I'm sorry.  I have plans.

          Elliman attempts a light bantering manner that suits him
          poorly.

                                        ELLIMAN
                        Change 'em.  This cash is burning
                        a hole in my pocket.  Gotta get
                        rid of some of it.

                                        NINA
                          I really can't.

          Elliman senses her repulsion towards him, and it pisses
          him off.

                                        ELLIMAN
                        You don't want me to spend money
                        on you?

                        I told you, I have plans.

                                        ELLIMAN
                        I do too.  And they involve you.

          He puts his arm around her waist.

                                        ELLIMAN
                        Why should I change my plans
                        because of yours?  Is that fair? 

                                        NINA
                        Please don't touch me.

          She struggles in his grasp...

                                        ELLIMAN
                        Is there something wrong with me? 
                        Because I know you're not shy. 

                                        NINA
                        What would Greg say if he could
                        see you hitting on me? 

                                        ELLIMAN
                        He'd say, bueno gusto.  Greg signed
                        off on this deal.  You're mine
                        for the night, Nina.

          He grabs her.  She struggles and he pulls her to him and
          kisses her full on the lips, pressing his angry body to
          hers.  Suddenly a hand falls on Elliman's shoulder.

          Whips him around.  It's Johnny/Mickey.  And he lands a
          smart right hook to Elliman's jaw and begins to take him
          apart as we saw in Johnny's earlier vision.  It's a brutal
          beating and Sonny is a guy who can usually take care of
          himself but Johnny/Mickey is almost superhuman and Elliman
          crumbles to the sidewalk... Nina's crying... mascara
          rolling down her cheeks... a helpless, scared little
          girl... he looks at her, sees all these things... takes
          her arm and leads her toward the Cadillac...

          Johnny guides the car to a stop in a space in front of 
          Nina's luxury condo.

                        Mickey drove Nina straight home
                        to her condo that night.  And I
                        decided to do the same thing.  It
                        was time she and I had a talk
                        about Sonny Elliman and Greg
                          Stillson.

          As he gets out, his mind continues to work... quite by
          instinct now, he does a slightly curious thing - he moves
          around and opens the back door even though no one is in
          the backseat... but as he does... he MORPHS TO --

          tears... escorts her to her front door... as they walk,
            Johnny/Mickey mumbles to the best of his ability, trying
          to express the depth of his feelings for her... he's not
          a verbal guy but his heart is full and he needs to tell
          her.  She's into her own pain and humiliation and sees no
          exit from it...

          They reach the door.

                        need to go home to St. Paul.

          He looks at her with hangdog eyes.  She tries to smile at
          this pipe dream... like any of it has a chance of
            happening... and really for the first time ever in their
            relationship, she looks at this little man who may be the

          only one in the world who genuinely cares about her well

          She sadly smiles at him and kisses him gently on the
          lips... the one and only time they've ever kissed... and
          the kiss that Johnny saw in his very first vision of them. 
          She studies him with those wise, too wise, eyes.

                        And that's when I realized what
                        it was all about.  Not casinos. 
                        Not Stillson.  Just a kiss.  The
                        one and only kiss from Nina.  But

                        Channel... it was a kiss that
                        raised him to knighthood.

          ends as we --

            Johnny/Mickey gets out of the car, slams the door shut
          and heads for the store.  Johnny/Mickey is

          a punch that takes him down to the ground... he looks up
          in shock to see Johnny looking down at him...

          He points his finger at Sonny for emphasis... and there's
          more than a trace of Mickey in his manner.  He walks away
          leaving Sonny lying in the filth of the ground.
