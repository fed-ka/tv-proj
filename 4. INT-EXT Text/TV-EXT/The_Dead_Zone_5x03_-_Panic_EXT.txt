      The sun has started to set on the stately Victorian mansion. 
      The CAMERA DRIFTS UP, PUSHING IN on a tiny attic window...

                                    J.J. (O.S.)
                    This isn't fair.

                                      JOHNNY (O.S.)
                    Seems completely fair to me.

                                    J.J. (O.S.)
                    That's because you're... old.



      Randy sprints up the driveway, past Observer Johnny.  A split
      second of hesitation before he runs across the street and up
      the driveway past a mailbox which reads, 'J. SMITH'.  WHOOSH!



      Zed, the older killer, perched atop the pole disabling the
      telephony junction panel.  He calls down to his partner,
      Cabot, who stands next to a Telephone Company van.  Observer
      Johnny stands beside him watching.

                                    ZED
                    No more calls out of that house! 

                                      CABOT
                    Good.  Now let's go get the little
                    rat and finish this thing.

      Observer Johnny turns and realizes they are in front of his
      house.  WHOOSH!  


1515BACK TO JOHNNY

      slowly lowering the phone; he looks back to Randy who watches
      him with expectant eyes.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Cell phone.

      He TURNS, then STOPS suddenly and looks back at Randy...

                                      JOHNNY
                    I left it in the car.

      Johnny starts past Randy, who grabs him by the shirt sleeve.

                                      RANDY
                    Wait!

                                      JOHNNY
                    It's okay.  I'll be right back.

      He grabs his car keys off a wall-mounted hook.  UNHEARD
      WHOOSH!



      Johnny slips cautiously out of the front door and crosses
      the driveway to the...  

      RANGE ROVER

      He cautiously checks the area around him, then slips open
      the driver's side door and leans in, frantically searching

      the seat, the dash, the cup holders; no sign of his phone
      and then he finds it tucked up in the visor.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Thank you God.

      He steps away from the car...  

                                      CABOT (O.S.)
                    That's a damn nice truck.

      Johnny spins around to FIND Cabot holding a silenced 9mm
      pointed at him.

                                      CABOT
                    Think I'll take it with me.

      He FIRES a single SHOT directly into Johnny's chest!  WHOOSH!



      Observer Johnny watches STEVE JOHNSON (35) pump gas into his
      sedan; Nevada plates.  Ten-year-old Randy emerges from the
      passenger side...

                                      YOUNG RANDY
                    I gotta' use the bathroom.

                                      STEVE
                    Okay, but do it fast.  We're behind
                    schedule.

      Young Randy runs off, past Observer Johnny.  FLASH! 



      Young Randy exits the bathroom and heads for the car, when a
      heated O.S. argument draws his attention around behind the
      station... Observer Johnny takes in everything.

                                    MAN #1 (O.S.)
                    That wasn't the deal! 

                                    MAN #2 (O.S.)
                    Well, the deal just changed.


                                                                (CONTINUED)                  DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT ONE - 8/29/05 - PINK   14.

      Randy is peeking his head around a corner, when his father
      steps up behind him...

                                      STEVE
                    Hey, let's go.

      Steve becomes the second witness to... 

      HIS POV

      Marcus Perez and ANOTHER MAN face off.

                                      PEREZ
                    You have my money or not? 

                                    MAN #1
                    I need more time.

                                      PEREZ
                    You're time just ran out.

      Perez pulls a .45 from his jacket and brutally shoots the
      other man... BANG!  BANG!  His attention suddenly shifts.

      REVERSE ON YOUNG RANDY AND STEVE

      having just witnessed the murder.  FLASH! 



      Observer Johnny watches as Zed kneels by an open electrical
      access panel.  An impatient Cabot paces behind him... 


                                                                (CONTINUED)                  DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT ONE - 8/29/05 - PINK   17.

                                      CABOT
                    What the hell are we waitin' for? 
                    Let's just burn the place to the
                    ground. 

      Zed responds calm and collected; the level headed one. 

                                    ZED
                    No need to attract attention.

                                      CABOT
                    How are we gonna' get past the
                    goddamned alarm system? 

                                    ZED
                    Simple science.  Electricity travels
                    through a circuit in an unintended
                    path, it causes a short.

                                      CABOT
                    What are you, an electrician?

                                    ZED
                    I was.  In another life.  Reverse
                    the polarity and create a big enough
                    short, every circuit in the series
                    gets fried.

                                      CABOT
                    And? 

                                    ZED
                    This guy's alarm system is toast,
                    and we get the kid.

                                      CABOT
                    What about the others? 

                                    ZED
                    You know the deal. No witnesses.  

      As Zed clips the final circuit wires,  WHOOSH! 



      Walt's cruiser pulls into the driveway.  Emerging from the
      car, he notices a PHONE COMPANY van parked out on the street. 
      He considers it, then crosses up the walk to the front door.

      His first knock pushes the unlatched door inwards.  Walt
      notices the splintered door frame, and draws his weapon.


      Stands at his open driver's side door, tethered microphone
      in hand...

                                    WALT

                    a Federal Marshal Connors in*
                      Washington.  Tell him one of his

                    know what I mean.  And get a crime
                    scene unit out...

      Walt's focus is suddenly robbed by something he sees.

                                    WALT
                    Hold on.

      He drops the microphone on the seat and steps out of FRAME. 
      The radio crackles back on...

                                      ROSCOE (V.O. OVER RADIO)
                    Say again, I didn't catch that last
                      transmission?

      NEW ANGLE - WALT

      kneeling in the driveway, examining the asphalt with his
      flash light.

      CLOSE ON THE ASPHALT

      Fresh footprints.  Walt rubs his finger across the impression. 
      It's freshly spilled blood.

      WALT

      stands, instinctively tracking the footstep trajectory across
      the street.  He freezes, looking up; his expression fraught
      with concern.

      REVERSE

      Walt stands directly in front of the Smith house; the only
      one on the block without a single light on.

      ON WALT

      His expression hardened.

                                    WALT

                    Sheriff?  Do you copy?  Over.



      flashlight in hand, sweeping the bullet riddled front door...
      Walt decides to go around back.                  DEAD ZONE: "Panic" - ACT TWO - 8/29/05 - PINK   24.




      Walt approaches the back door, redirecting his light to
      illuminate the busted door jamb; the forced point of entry.

      With his pistol drawn, he goes for the door...



      John Smith steps onto his porch, wearing the very same tweed
      top coat; the angry mob awaits.  Observer Johnny is standing
      beside him.  John Smith carries a rifle.

                                    JOHN SMITH
                    I'm not going to tell you people
                    again.  Get off my property!
