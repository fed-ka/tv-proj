  Kirby follows Fung into this large, lushly-appointed study. 
  The walls are covered in movie posters, framed photographs, 
  movie memorabilia dating back to the silent era. 

  WOLF BELLINGER rises to greet Kirby. He's in his 70's,  
  elegant, very old world European. Tall. Still powerful. 

                                          KIRBY 
                          You have an incredible 
                            collection.  
                                          BELLINGER 
                            Yes, I know. I'm sure you 
                            have some rare pieces of 
                            your own. 

  Kirby moves through the study, fascinated by everything.

                          Not really. Can't afford

                          It must be torture, hunting 
                            down pieces for others. To 
                            have something in your 
                            hands, only to give it up 
                              immediately.

                            There are perks. When I 
                            track down a rare print, I 
                            also get to screen it... 
                            quality assurance purposes, 
                          of course.

                          Of course. 

  Kirby stops in front of one particular poster, a giant four- 
  sheet from 1971. A kaleidoscope of images, hard to digest at 
  first glance. Kirby runs his fingers over the title.

                          LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE. 
 
                                          BELLINGER 
                            What do you know about it?

                          The film played once. The 
                            closing night premiere at 
                          the Festival Internacional 
                          de Cinema Fantastic de 
                            Sitges.  

  Kirby considers the poster again before continuing. 
  Something hypnotic about the tapestry of suggestive images 
  and half-glimpsed horrors.                                           KIRBY 
                            Violence erupted in the 
                            theater. When the director, 
                            Hans Backovic, tried to get 
                          the film out of the 
                            country, the government 
                            seized and destroyed it. 
                            They didn t realize it was 
                              a work-in-progress... his 
                            only copy. He quit the 
                            business, and the film has 
                            never been seen by anyone 
                            except that one audience.

                          The government didn t 
                            destroy it. 

  Kirby walks over to the opposite wall, where a pair of 
  wings, seven feet from tip to tip, have been mounted and 
  framed.

                            survive anything. I'd give

                            extreme images created by 
                            some of the most obscure 
                            filmmakers to ever pick up

                            middle of the night for 
                            something that made a

                            Were you at the festival 
                            when it played? 
 
                                          BELLINGER 
                            Yes. I even had tickets for 
                          the screening. But I d seen 
                            Backovic s previous works 
                          and wasn t impressed. I 
                            went to see THE ABOMINABLE 
                          DR. PHIBES instead, hoping 
                          to meet Vincent Price. 

  Bellinger reaches into one of his desk drawers and takes out 
  a folder full of documents. 

                                          BELLINGER 
                          In '83, the Rotterdam Film 
                            Festival announced a 
                            screening. By the time I'd 
                            flown there, they had 
                            already cancelled it, 
                            saying it was an error. The 
                            fact that the venue burned 
                            down might have had 
                            something to do with it. 

  Bellinger tosses the folder to Kirby.

                            about underground 
                            screenings, the official

                          How can you be sure? 

  Bellinger fixes Kirby with a frightening smile. 



  The door opens and Kirby steps into this atrium and stops, 
  not quite sure what he's looking at. 

  In the center of the room, a tall WILLOWY BEING stands  
  chained at the wrists and the ankles. White as chalk,  
    completely androgynous, bruised from a fresh beating. 

  The Being turns to Kirby, mouth open, and makes a terribly 
  sad sound, anguish and pain. 

  As it turns away, Kirby gets a good look at the Being's 
  back. Two long ragged wounds run the full length of its 
  back, unmistakably the stumps of wings, partially healed. 
  They twitch, as if still trying to fly. 

  As Kirby backs away, horrified, he runs into Bellinger.

                            What the hell is this?

                          As you can see, I collect 
                            more than movies, Mr. 
                            Sweetman. Meet one of the 
                            stars of LA FIN ABSOLUE DU 
                            MONDE. 

  Bellinger fishes an ice cube out of his drink and tosses it, 
  bouncing it off the Being's head. 

                                          BELLINGER 
                            Tell Mr. Sweetman what you 
                            told me. 

  The Being speaks, its voice as ambiguous as its appearance. 

                                          WILLOWY BEING 
                          We are part of the movie, 
                            bound to the negative, like 
                            soul to flesh. If it had 
                            been destroyed... we would 
                            know. 

  Bellinger fixes Kirby with a cold, emotionless stare. 

                                          BELLINGER 
                            I've done terrible things 
                          in my life. I know full 
                            well what will happen to 
                            this desiccated cobweb I 
                            call a soul. Call me  
                            crazy... but I wanted at 
                            least a taste of Heaven 
                            before an eternity of Hell. 

  Kirby can't take it. He opens the door, ready to leave. 

                                          BELLINGER 
                            Money is no object. I ll

                            $100,000 on top of it. 

  Kirby stops, stunned by the offer.

                            theater is a shitbox. You 
                            have 800 seats, but you're 
                            lucky to sell 50 
                            tickets a night. Find this 
                            print, and after I've seen 
                          it, you can have it for a 
                            two-week run. I promise 
                            never to give it to another 
                            theater. You need this.

  Kirby waits for a reaction as Bellinger puts on his best 
  poker face. It's hard to tell who is more desperate.  

  Finally, Bellinger breaks the spell with a smile. He's not a 
  bit happy, though.

                            Deal. 


  Extreme CLOSE-UPS. Quick cuts. The room is dark.  

  We hear a projector, but don't see it. Although we only 
  glimpse parts of this room, it's obvious we're in a 
    projection booth.  

  TIMPSON, the projectionist, sits at a splicing table, 
  breaking down a print.  

  We see only his hands, not his face. He winds the reel all 
  the way to the end and holds the tail up to a light. He 
  scans several frames until he finds what he's looking for -- 

  The frame with the "bug" or "cigarette burn" in the top 
  right corner that indicates a reel change.  

                                          TIMPSON  
                            There you are, you 
                              sonofabitch.  

  He places the frame in his splicer and cuts it out. 



  Movie posters from every era line the walls. Kirby drops 
  into his chair behind his desk. He glances at a framed photo 
  of a beautiful girl in her 20's. ANNIE MATTHEWS. 

                                          ANNIE (V.O.) 
                            (whispers in a sing-song) 
                            Kirby Sweetman... is my 
                            sweeeet man... 

  Kirby can't take his eyes off the photo.   FLASHBACK 

  An extreme CLOSE-UP of Kirby and Annie in bed, wrapped in 
  each others arms. She whispers, breathy and ethereal. 

                                          ANNIE 
                          Are you my sweet man, 
                            Kirby? 

  FLASHBACK 

    CLOSE-UPS. Disorienting. It's hard to tell where we are. 
  Kirby holds a piece of foil and a lighter, cooks some heroin 
  for Annie to inhale the smoke. 

                                          ANNIE (V.O.) 
                          (in that same whisper) 
                            Will you take care of me... 
                            always? 
                                                                      SHOCK CUT TO: 



  BOOM! Timpson, the projectionist, sets two film cans down, 
  jarring Kirby out of his reverie. Kirby checks the clock. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Hey, Timpson. What's up? 
 
                                          TIMPSON 
                            Last show'll be over in 
                            about fifteen minutes. 
                            PROFONDO ROSSO, ready to 
                          go. 

  Kirby nods at the cans. 

                                          KIRBY 
                          Did you take your souvenir? 
 
                                          TIMPSON 
                            Dude, it's Argento. Had to 
                          do it. 

  Timpson slips the frame into a notebook binder he takes down 
  from a shelf with hundreds of other cut frames, all labeled. 
  He quickly writes a new label: "ARGENTO, PROFONDO ROSSO,  
  1975."                                           KIRBY 
                            What's with you and 
                            cigarette burns? 
 
                                          TIMPSON 
                            When you're watching a film 
                          and one of those bugs 
                            appears, it lets you 
                            know... something's about 
                          to happen... hold on... 
                            here it comes. You take 
                            them out, and all of a 
                            sudden, it's anarchy.

                            Alright, well, try not to 
                            blow anything up while I'm 
                            gone, Mr. Anarchy. 
 
                                          TIMPSON 
                          Oh, did you get a new 
                            client?  
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            Yep. It's an incredible 
                            offer, but the guy gives me 
                          the creeps. 
 
                                          TIMPSON 
                            What film is it this time? 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                          LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE. 

  Timpson considers Kirby for a moment, expecting a punchline. 

                                          TIMPSON 
                          No shit? 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                          No shit. 


  Kirby scans a tall bookshelf, pulling titles while his  
  computer warms up. A fairly impressive collection of film 
  criticism from all over the world.  

    A computer on a desk, open to a web browser. Kirby collapses 
  on the couch, smoking, making notes on a stack of pages.                                           ANNIE (V.O.) 
                            Kirby knows absolutely 
                            everything about movies, 
                          and the theater is 
                            beautiful. 


  Kirby and Annie stand together, both wired, blotchy, hollow- 
  eyed. Obviously wrestling with addiction. No furniture  
  here. The place looks like it should be condemned. 

  WALTER MATTHEWS stands across from them. Annie's father.  
  Stern, poised, wearing a $5000 suit, grey at the temples. 

  As Walter looks at the two of them and looks around this  
  dirty, depressing theater, Annie talks a mile a minute. 

                                          ANNIE 
                          It just needs a little 
                            work. We can do it 
                            ourselves. Think of it as a 
                            wedding present. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                            (measured) 
                            This all sounds good, 
                            sweetheart. Why don't you 
                            wait in the car while Kirby 
                          and I work out the details? 

  Walter's not asking. She kisses her father on the cheek,  
  gives Kirby's hand a "good luck" squeeze, then goes. Walter  
  never takes his eyes off Kirby. 

  She leaves the two of them alone. Walter just stares at 
  Kirby, sizing him up. Kirby squirms a bit. 

  Finally, Walter scowls as he takes out his check ledger. 

                                          WALTER 
                            This is not a gift. It's a 
                            loan. 

  Walter writes a check and hands it over to Kirby. 

                                          WALTER 
                          Get your shit together. Get 
                          her shit together. Don't 
                            make me sorry. 

  Annie in a tub in XCU, blood in the water around her. 

                                                                      FLASH CUT TO: 



  Kirby shakes his head, as if trying to shake the memories.  

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:




  As Timpson enters from outside, carrying the letter he took 
  down, someone slips in after him. 

                                          TIMPSON 
                            Excuse me, sir, but we're 
                          not open yet. 

  The person removes his hat, revealing that he is Walter 
  Matthews. A few years have made all the difference. He  
  looks terrible, like sleep is a distant memory. 

                                          TIMPSON 
                            Oh... Mr. Matthews. Listen, 
                            Kirby's not here. I can 
                            tell him you came by... 

  Too late. Kirby emerges from the back of the theater, and 
  both Timpson and Walter see him. 

                                          TIMPSON 
                          Oh, wow. Look at that.   Timpson gets out of the way, leaving Walter and Kirby face-
  to-face. 

                                          WALTER 
                            You're a hard man to get 
                            hold of. Almost like you're 
                            avoiding me. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            Avoid you? But it's always 
                            such a pleasure when you 
                            stop by. 

  They bristle at each other, barely retaining all the 
  hostility and pain between them. 

                                          WALTER 
                          We need to talk. 
 
                                          KIRBY

                            now. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                            Then how about a check for 
                            $200,000? Do you have that 
                            right now? 
 
                                          KIRBY

                                          WALTER 
                            When? 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            Soon. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                          Why should I believe that? 
                          Why should I believe 
                            anything you say? 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            I know you're not going to 
                          go away until I pay you, 
                          but every time you come in 
                            here or call, I feel like 
                          I'm being cut open. I see 
                            Annie's face all day, every 
                            day. You have no idea what 
                          I'm putting myself through 
                          to guarantee that you'll be 
                          out of my life for good.   Walter practically trembles. He's so angry, he aches to lash 
  out at Kirby. But he doesn't. He holds himself in check. 

                                          WALTER 
                            You've got one week. If you 
                            don't come up with the 
                            money, then I will take 
                            great delight in coming 
                            here and tearing this 
                            shithole down. 

  Walter turns and storms out. Kirby exhales slowly, shaky, 
    adrenaline still pumping.  



  Kirby sits at his desk, on the phone as Timpson puts away 
  the letters he took down. 

  Timpson breaks out a joint, which he lights and passes to 
  Kirby as he looks over his shoulder at everything laid out 
  on his desk. He picks up a book: CONTACT HIGH.  

                                          TIMPSON 
                          AK Meyers. I've read all 
                            this guy's shit. Good 
                            critic. 
                                          KIRBY 
                          Big fan of the esoteric. 
                          Out of all of Kael's 
                            disciples, he was the most 
                            original thinker. 

  Timpson opens the book and flips to a page Kirby has folded  
  over. He's marked a paragraph with a yellow highlighter. 

                                          TIMPSON

  As Kirby steps in, he gets hit in the face with a wall of 
  stink. He gags, stops just inside the door. 

  The room is dark. Stacks of paper are piled to the ceiling. 
  Trash is everywhere. 

                                          KIRBY 
                          Mr. Meyers, did they hand 
                          out press notes at the 
                            Sitges screening? 

  Meyers's voice comes from somewhere deeper in the room, 
  behind all the papers. Meyers's nowhere in sight. 

                                          MEYERS (O.S.) 
                            They did.

                            I did. 

  Kirby looks around, trying to figure out if there's any

                          I'd love to see them... and 
                            anything else you've got on 
                          LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE...  
                                          MEYERS (O.S.) 
                            Dangerous. Backovic said, 
                            "Film, in the right hands, 
                          is a weapon." He was right. 

  As Meyers talks, Kirby picks up a random stack of paper and 
  flips open to a random page. 

                                          KIRBY 
                          "If LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE 
                          is not a movie, but more 
                            like a bullet fired 
                            directly into the 
                            collective brain pan of 
                          all those assembled, then 
                          the only rational response 
                          is violence." 

  Kirby looks around at the mountains of books and paper, at 
  the mysterious dark stains in the corners.  

                                          MEYERS (O.S.) 
                          We trust filmmakers. We sit 
                          in the dark, daring them to 
                            affect us, secure in the 
                            knowledge they won't go too 
                            far. 

  Holding his hand over his mouth and nose, Kirby heads 
  further into the study.

                            I read your review twice on 
                          the plane, but I'm still 
                          not even sure what the film 
                          was about. 
 
                                          MEYERS (O.S.) 
                            Hans Backovic was a 
                            terrorist. He abused that 
                            trust we place in 
                            filmmakers. He didn't want 
                          to hurt his audience. He  
                            wanted to destroy them 
                            completely.

                            I've seen extreme gore, and 
                          it didn't make me crazy or 
                            violent. What made LA FIN 
                            ABSOLUE DU MONDE...    Kirby steps around a corner and stops, confronted with the 
  reality of AK MEYERS. 

                                          KIRBY 
                          ... so dangerous? 

  Meyers's as thin a Holocaust survivor, dressed in filthy, 
  stained pajamas, fingernails and hair like crazy Howard 
  Hughes. He sits huddled over his typewriter, his back to 
  Kirby, typing as they talk. 

                                          MEYERS 
                            Backovic was brilliant.

                          But all the violence in the 
                            theater was an 
                              exaggeration... right? 
 
                                          MEYERS 
                          If anything, the incident 
                          was downplayed. I watched 
                            four people die. It smelled 
                            like a slaughterhouse. The 
                            center aisle was slick with 
                            blood. 

  Kirby picks up another stack of pages to flip through. More  
  of that same dense text about LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE. 

                                          MEYERS 
                            Backovic knew what he was 
                            doing. When Stravinski's 
                            "Rites Of Spring" premiered 
                          to riots, it was an 
                            accident. LA FIN  
                            ABSOLUE DU MONDE was no 
                            accident. He told me so. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                          You spoke to Backovic? 
                            When? 
 
                                          MEYERS 
                          At the start of the 
                            festival. He told me 
                            exactly what was going to 
                            happen. I recorded the 
                            whole interview. 

  Kirby downplays his excitement. He didn't expect this.                                           KIRBY 
                          Can I listen to that tape? 
 
                                          MEYERS 
                            People weren't ready. They 
                            still aren't. That review I 
                            published is a joke. It 
                            doesn't begin to describe 
                          the film. I was given the 
                            opportunity to be the 
                            messenger, and I failed. 
                          But you'll see... people 
                            will understand... as soon 
                          as I finish my new 
                            review... 

  Meyers removes the page he just typed and puts it on the 
  closest stack, where Kirby can see it. That same dense text  
  about LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Your... new review? 

  Kirby looks around at the thousands of stacked sheets all 
  over the office, starting to make sense of things.

                          Is this... all... one 
                            review? 

  Meyers looks up at Kirby, disconcertingly close to him. He's  
  got wide, dilated pupils, like he's tripping. 

                                          MEYERS 
                            Almost finished now.

                            There's a chance a print 
                            still exists. I've been 
                            hired to find it. 
 
                                          MEYERS 
                          To what purpose? 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                          To show it, of course. 

  Meyers fights a smile. His mouth is a foul hole, most of his  
  teeth missing. He starts to cackle, a horrible, mirthless  
  sound.                                           MEYERS 
                          You should know what you're 
                            getting into. 

  Meyers jumps up and darts over to a stack of boxes. He  
  starts going through them, tossing the contents everywhere. 

                                          MEYERS 
                            You're right. The film is 
                            still alive. Even if they 
                            tried to destroy it, they 
                            couldn't. Some films are 
                            meant to be  
                            seen.  

  Finally, Meyers comes up with a bundle of audio tapes, old 
    reel-to-reels, held together by rubber bands. He also hands  
  Kirby a small player. 

                                          MEYERS 
                            These will change your 
                            life. 

  As Kirby takes the tapes, Meyers grabs his wrist with 
    surprising strength. 

                                          MEYERS 
                          But promise me... promise 
                            me... When you find the 
                            film... let me see it 
                            again. I've dreamed about 
                          it every night for 
                            thirty years. Laying eyes 
                          on it again. 

  Kirby pulls his wrist free and backs away. Meyers doesn't 
  even notice. He's lost in his memory now. 

                                          MEYERS 
                            Once you start this, you 
                            can't shake it off and walk 
                            away. It gets inside you. 
                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:



  Kirby lays in bed, headphones on. He presses play on 
  Meyers's tape recorder. 

                                          MEYERS (ON TAPE) 
                            So... Mr. Backovic... this 
                          is your first feature film. 

  A voice answers -- smooth, with a hard-to-place European 
  accent, commanding. The same voice we heard at the very 
  start of the film. 

                                          BACKOVIC (ON 
                                          TAPE) 
                            I prefer not to categorize 
                          any film. What difference 
                            does a running time make? 
                          The mechanics of film... 
                          the language... 
                            that is what matters.  

  Kirby lays back, gets comfortable. 

                                          MEYERS (ON TAPE) 
                            Your work so far has been 
                            experimental. You eschew 
                              conventional narrative. 

  As Kirby listens, he stares at the ceiling. 

                                          BACKOVIC (ON 
                                          TAPE) 
                            Narrative is dead. 
                            Hollywood is shit. Film is 
                          not entertainment. It is 
                            power. If you understand 
                          the potential of film, you 
                          can reshape the world.

                            What was the origin of this 
                            film? 
 
                                           BACKOVIC (ON 
                                          TAPE) 
                            What is the origin of any 
                            work of art? My films are 
                          not about the text, but 
                            instead are about the way 
                          an edit affects our 
                            expectations. The politics 
                          of the splice. Every frame 
                          is a square on a chess-
                            board, an opportunity. My 
                            producers are... like-
                            minded people. 

  Suddenly there's a FLASH in front of Kirby, a ragged circle  
  in the air, like a marker before a reel change. 

  Then it's gone almost instantly. 

  Kirby flinches, startled. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            What the fuck?! 

  Kirby takes off his headphones. There's a sound. Kirby stops 
  and listens. He realizes it's the water running in the 
  bathroom... the sound of the bathtub filling. 

  The lights in the bathroom are on. A shadow passes by at the 
  bottom of the door. 

  Kirby stands up, nervously walks across the room.  

  He puts his hand on the door and gives it a gentle push. 

  It's unlocked and opens a few inches. 

  Through the opening he sees that someone is in the tub. It's 
  the same tub we saw earlier in the brief flashback of Annie, 
  somehow here in this hotel now. 

  A woman's bloody arm dangles over the edge. One drop rolls 
  off her finger and hits the floor.  

  In that moment, there's another FLASH, a flaming circle -- 

  And in the circle, a FACE, covered in blood, screaming. 


  Kirby wakes up suddenly, heart racing, in bed. The phone is 
  ringing. Meyers's recorder beside him is still running, the 
  tape long since finished. 

  Kirby takes a moment to get his bearings and calm down. He 
  picks up the phone. The voice on the other end is cheery. 

                                          VOICE (ON PHONE) 
                          (in French) 
                            Good morning! This is your 
                            wake-up call! 

  Kirby hangs up, still shaky. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Fuck.

 

  HENRI COTILLARD, Chief Archivist, French Cinematheque. His  
  name and title on the door. The office is packed with stacks 
  of boxes, over-stuffed, so there's barely any room to walk. 

  Henri's whip-thin, early 30's. The entire time they talk, 
  Henri keeps his left hand tucked in his pocket. 

                                          HENRI 
                          So you are on the hunt 
                            again, Kirby?

                            Yeah, but this isn't like 
                          the other times. I'm 
                            looking for something that 
                          may not even exist anymore.

                          LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE. 

  Henri reacts, but covers it well.                                           HENRI 
                            (French; subtitled) 
                            Vous  tes fou. (You are a

                            Maybe I need to brush up on 
                          my French, but it sounded 
                            like you said...

                            I don't have a lot of 
                            options, Henri. I'm in debt 
                          up to my neck, and this one 
                          job could turn that around. 
 
                                          HENRI 
                            Don't do it for money, 
                            Kirby. It's not worth it.

                            This guy came to me because 
                          he heard I could find 
                            anything. There's a part of 
                          me that wants to prove he's 
                            right. Beyond that... I'll 
                            admit it... I'm curious to 
                          see the film. 
 
                                          HENRI 
                          How much do you know about 
                          LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE and 
                            Hans Backovic?

                          Not enough. I talked to AK 
                            Meyers.

                            Nice choice. Most people 
                            start with Sitges and try 
                          to track it that way.                                           KIRBY 
                            Most people?

                            first to try and find the 
                            film, do you?

                            Well... if you know so much 
                            about it, then you can help 
                          me find it. 

  Henri points at some boxes on top of a stack in the corner. 

                                          HENRI 
                          You can use my assistant's 
                            office next door. But it's 
                          not in there. You have to 
                            earn this movie.


  Kirby sits in an office identical to Henri's, surrounded by 
  research materials, including the press notes that Meyers 
  gave him. As Kirby looks over all the paper laid out in 
  front of him, we see INSERTS of particular pages: 

  From the press notes, an abbreviated crew list. 
    Cinematography, art direction, editor, sound. All of the  
  main departments. Oddly, no producer is listed. 

  Next to each name, Kirby makes notes. "DEAD" next to every  
  name except two: Patton League and Hans Backovic. 

  Next to League, Kirby writes, "Motion Picture Fund Home, 
  LA -- will he talk?" 



  Kirby walks in, startling Henri in the middle of 
    something.Henri pushes some film cans to the side of his 
  desk.

                            Tragic story, that. He went 
                            blind after they made the 
                            movie. As I understand he 
                            will not even speak 
                            Backovic's name. Last 
                            person to ask him about LA 
                            FINABSOLUE DU MONDE needed 
                          six stitches from where 
                            League smacked him with his 
                            cane.

                          Why all the mystery? 
                            There's a wall of silence 
                            around this film... around 
                            Backovic's whole life. If I 
                            could just talk to him...  
 
                                          HENRI  
                            He's dead.

                                          HENRI  
                            Trust me. Backovic is quite 
                            dead.

                          Did you hear that from his 
                            family? His friends? Anyone 
                          you can introduce me to?

                          I'm sorry. I can tell you 
                          no more.  


  Kirby walks out of Henri's office, starts down the hall.  

  He hears Henri pick up his phone and quickly dial a number, 
  though, and he stops. 



  Henri looks down at the open Backovic file, at the titles of 
  the short films before LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE. 

                                          HENRI 
                            (French; subtitled) 
                            Allo. C'est Henri. 
                            Ecoutez...Quel qu'un est 
                            venu ici se renseigner sur 
                          LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE. 
                            (Hello. It's Henri.  
                            Listen... someone was here 
                            about LA FIN ABSOLUE DU 
                            MONDE today.)


  Kirby can't help himself. He creeps back down the hall so he 
  can hear better. 

                                          HENRI 
                            (French; subtitled) 
                            Non, je n'ai rien dis mais 
                          il a quelques bon tuyaux. 
                            (No, I didn't tell him 
                            anything. He's got some 
                            good leads, though.) 
                            (pause) 
                            C'est une coincidence. J'en 
                            suis sur. C'est toujours 
                            d'accord pour ce soir. A

                            pellicules. (I'm sure it's 
                            a coincidence. We're still 
                          on for tonight. I'll be 
                            there by 10:00. Yes, I've 
                          got the prints.) 

  Henri turns the stack of film cans on his desk so he can see  
  the sides. The titles are the same as in the Backovic file,  
  all five of the short films. 

                                          HENRI 
                            (French; subtitled) 
                          Le nom de la veuve Backovic 
                            n'est mentione nul part. 
                            Tout ira bien. (There's no 
                            mention of Backovic's widow 
                          in the file. She'll be 
                            fine.) 

  Henri hears something, looks sharply over at the door.                                           HENRI 
                            (French; subtitled) 
                            Attendez une minute. (Hold 
                          on a minute.) 

  Henri rises, walks over to his office door -- 



  -- and looks out into an empty hallway. 



  Henri finishes straightening his desk. He checks his clock. 
  9:40. 

  Henri gathers the film cans on his desk and stands up. When  
  he turns to his office door, he jumps -- 

  -- and Kirby steps in, shaking his head.

                            you're holding... it's one 
                          of Backovic's short

                            already in it. It will only 
                          get worse from here.

                                          HENRI 
                          The more you look for this 
                            film, the more you will see 
                            those burns. You're going 
                          to pay for every step 
                            closer you take. I  
                          am trying to do you a 
                            favor. I'm telling you to 
                            walk away because I like 
                            you, Kirby. I've been where 
                          you are right now. I've 
                            felt that same building 
                            curiosity, like an 
                            unscratchable itch. I had 
                          to know. I had to see it. 

  Henri finally removes his left hand from his pocket and 
  holds it up.  

  The skin is scarred, as if terribly burnt, and three of the 
  fingers are fused together. 

                                          HENRI 
                            I was the projectionist 
                            that night. The faces in 
                          the room... famous and 
                            beautiful people from all 
                            over Europe. When I  
                            threaded the film into the 
                            projector, I saw those same 
                            dots you described. When I 
                            actually started it 
                            running, I... I 
                            looked away. I lost my 
                            nerve. It was playing right 
                            there, right in front of 
                            me... and I was too 
                            frightened to watch. 

  Kirby studies the hand nervously.                                           HENRI 
                            When the screaming started, 
                          and the smell of blood hit 
                          me, I tried to stop the 
                            film. The projector 
                            wouldn't shut off, 
                          and I grabbed the film to 
                          rip it out. And then I saw 
                            those same circles, and...  
                            (shakes his head) 
                            I don't know. I must have 
                            blacked out. Time seemed to 
                            drop away. When I came to, 
                          the film was over, and my 
                            hand... 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                              I appreciate you trying to 
                            protect me. But I need 
                            this. I won't watch the 
                            movie. I won't show the 
                            movie at my theater. I'll 
                            just give it to this 
                            collector and walk away. I 
                            promise. 

  Henri thinks about it. He can see how desperate Kirby is. 
  He reaches into his wallet and takes out a card. 

                                          HENRI 
                          If I were you, I would not 
                            call this number. This man 
                          has an excellent 
                            collection, but he's 
                            dangerous. 

  Kirby examines the card. There's a name: DALIBOR HUPTMANN. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Does he have the film? 
 
                                          HENRI 
                          No, but he does have items 
                            given to him by the 
                            Backovic estate. God knows 
                            why. He can get in touch 
                            with them.


  There's nothing in this room. It looks like this place 
  hasn't been used in quite a while. Horst motions for Kirby 
  to wait. Horst and Kaspar vanish into a different room, 
  leaving Kirby alone. 

  Muffled voices from the next room. Coarse laughter. Kirby 
  steels his nerve as DALIBOR HUPTMANN emerges. 

  Tall, powerfully-built, shirtless, with a tattoo running up 
  both arms that connects around his neck, a strip of film 
  complete with sprockets. 

  Dalibor sets down the only thing he carries, a crate with 
  the label, "LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE" on the side. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            It's not for me. It's for a 
                            client. 
 
                                          DALIBOR 
                          But you're curious, aren't 
                            you? If Henri sent you to 
                          me, then you've had your 
                            first glimpses. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            Glimpses of what? 
 
                                          DALIBOR 
                            It's different for 
                            everyone. What you see 
                            isn't the important part. 
                            It's the way you change... 
                            it's what the film does to 
                          you that matters.   Kirby pokes through the contents of the crate. He brings out 
  a sheath of publicity stills. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Have you seen the film? 
 
                                          DALIBOR 
                          No. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            Would you watch it if you 
                          had the chance? 
 
                                          DALIBOR 
                          Of course. 

  Kirby flips through the photos. Each still has the title at  
  the bottom of the image, with the director's credit. 

  The first image is strikingly composed, a stern, grizzled 
  man in his 40's, the PROTAGONIST of the film. He stands in 
  the center of a field, shaking his fist at the sky and 
    bellowing. 

                                          KIRBY 
                          Is it true you're in touch 
                            with the Backovic estate? 
 
                                          DALIBOR 
                            I've got a number I've 
                            called a few times. I've 
                            managed to pry a few items 
                            loose. Backovic's widow can 
                          be difficult  
                          to deal with.  

  The second image shows the Protagonist again, running along 
  a country road. The image looks like it's been hand-painted 
  with a blood-red sky. Kirby looks closely at the 
    Protagonist's face, distorted by fear. 

                                          DALIBOR 
                            (smiles) 
                            I admire a man like 
                            Backovic. Unafraid to 
                            transgress... in life and 
                          in art.  

  As Kirby sets the still down and looks at the next one, 
  Dalibor glances over at the door to the back room.   Horst opens the door slightly and peeks out, quietly, so 
  Kirby doesn't notice. 

                                          DALIBOR 
                            I've always wanted to make 
                          my own films, but I detest 
                          the falseness of Hollywood. 
                            I would rather die than 
                            make something false. Don't 
                          you agree? 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            Yeah, sure. 

  The next still shows a WINGED MAN being chased by a group of 
  CHILDREN. The Willowy Being from Bellinger's house, its 
  wings spread out, in terrible pain! 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Jesus... 

  He looks up at Dalibor and suddenly realizes Horst and 
  Kaspar are right there, right on top of him. 

  They grab his arms, and Kirby struggles to pull free. 

  Dalibor pulls out a syringe. When Kirby sees it, he goes 
  crazy, but Horst and Kaspar hold him tight. 

                                          DALIBOR 
                            Don't leave, Mr. Sweetman. 
                            There's so much more to 
                            talk about. 

  Dalibor sticks Kirby in the arm. 

                                          DALIBOR 
                            What is it you Americans 
                            say? "Relax. Chill out." 
  Before Kirby can respond, he sags, and everything goes -- 

  BLACK 

  In the darkness, Annie can be heard, crying out in pain. 

  Kirby runs through the darkness towards the sound. 



  The same bathroom we've seen twice before now. Kirby nearly 
  takes the door off the hinges as he bursts in.   Annie lies in the bathtub, naked. The tub spills over with 
  bloody water. She's as pale as a corpse, no heavier than 
  eighty pounds. 

  He stops cold when he takes in the sight. 

  Annie reaches out to Kirby. Blood pumps from her slashed 
  wrist, spraying Kirby's shirt and face! 

                                                                      SHOCK CUT TO: 



  Kirby comes back to consciousness with a jump. He's tied to 
  a chair, hands behind him. He's not the only one tied up. 

  The Cab Driver struggles in another chair, tied and gagged.  

  A 16mm camera focused on her. Horst stands behind it. 

  Dalibor steps into the room, transformed. He wears a leather 
  hood to completely cover his face, and holds a machete. 

  When the Cab Driver sees Dalibor, she goes crazy, struggling 
  to slip free of her restraints. He takes his time walking 
  out in front of the camera. 

  He swings the blade several times right above her, testing 
  it, enjoying the sound as it cuts through the air. Swoosh. 
  Swoosh. Swoosh. And he keeps getting closer. 

                                          DALIBOR 
                          The blade of a splicing 
                            table can be used to create 
                            a lie, or to tell the 
                            truth. It all depends whose 
                            hand it's in. 

  SWOOSH! SWOOSH! He stops, looking down at her, and by now, 
  she's not struggling. All her attention is focused on that 
  blade. She's even forgotten the camera. 

                                          DALIBOR 
                            This may be larger than an 
                            actual splicing blade, but 
                          you get the point. 

  He swings the blade again, but this time, he brings it down 
  hard, burying it in the Cab Driver's neck! 

  There's no blood. Not at first. Not until he pulls the blade 
  loose. There's a sudden pulse, a hot arterial spray.   She tries to scream, but the sound is strangled, weak. 

  Before she can scream again, Dalibor swings the blade, hard 
  enough to make it almost all the way through her neck. Her 
  head falls sideways, so Kirby is looking directly into her 
  eyes as she dies. 

                                          DALIBOR 
                            I believe in truth. 

  Finally, Kirby finds his voice, not even managing to get out 
  a word. It's just a sound of horror and fear.  

  Kirby struggles to get free, to no avail, going crazy. 

  Dalibor chops savagely at her neck, over and over, until he 
  manages to cut her head off completely. Kirby closes his 
  eyes to avoid seeing any more. 

  Dalibor picks her head up by the hair and walks toward 
  Kirby. 

  Horst pans the camera, following the action. 

                                          DALIBOR 
                          One take. One uninterrupted 
                            shot. The only cut was to 
                            her. This is truth. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            "Truth"? What the fuck are 
                          you talking about? You just 
                            killed someone. 
 
                                          DALIBOR 
                          No, I didn't. I turned her 
                            into art. Something happens 
                            when you point the camera 
                          at something terrible... 
                          the resulting film takes on 
                            power.  
 
                                          KIRBY 
                          No. It doesn't. Snuff isn't 
                            powerful. It doesn't reveal 
                            some greater truth.  

  SWOOSH! SWOOSH! Dalibor swings the machete, uncomfortably 
  close to Kirby's face. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            IT'S JUST MURDER!  
                                          DALIBOR 
                          You are not listening, my 
                            friend. You come all this 
                            way, then you don't listen. 
                          You want to understand why 
                          LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE 
                            tore through audiences? 

  Dalibor steps up close to Kirby and raises his blade. Kirby 
  doesn't flinch away, like he's daring Dalibor to do it. 

                                          DALIBOR 
                            Backovic was an exceptional 
                            editor. He understood the 
                            value of a cut... 

  Dalibor brings the blade down -- 

  -- and tosses it aside! 

                                          DALIBOR 
                          ... but there was more to 
                          it. 

  Dalibor sits down on Kirby's lap, facing him. Kirby can't do 
  anything to stop him. 

                                          DALIBOR 
                            They say the movie works 
                              subliminally while you're 
                            watching, but the thing 
                            that made the film a 
                            weapon... blood. Spilled 
                            blood.  
 
                                          KIRBY 
                          LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE is 
                            a snuff movie? 
 
                                          DALIBOR 
                            What if you got hold of an 
                            angel? A Divine Being with 
                          the blood of God flowing 
                            through its veins? And what 
                          if you sacrificed it... on 
                            camera? 

  INSERT 

  For just a moment, Kirby sees the Willowy Being in 
  Bellinger's atrium, sorrow like a shroud.   BACK TO SCENE 

  Dalibor puts his hands around Kirby's throat. Kirby bucks, 
  trying to pull free. 

                                          DALIBOR 
                            Something that profound... 
                            that personal... it changes 
                            everyone who was part of 
                            putting it on film and 
                            everyone who sees it. The 
                            closer you get to the film, 
                          the more you'll be changed, 
                            too. 

  Dalibor begins to squeeze, cutting off Kirby's air. 

                                          DALIBOR 
                            This was Backovic's secret, 
                          you know?  

  Kirby bucks as hard as he can, but there's no way out. 
  Dalibor tightens his grip, squeezing as hard now.  

                                          DALIBOR 
                            "Film is magic," he said, 
                          and he was right. 

  Kirby's eyes roll and he looks around for any escape. 

  On the far end of the room, against the empty wall, there's 
  a FLASH -- three seconds or so -- of a flaming circle. 

  During the three seconds the flash is visible, Kirby gets a 
  better look at the face in the center of the cirle. 

    Screaming. Covered in blood. Annie. 

  Kirby flinches back from the sight, and Dalibor notices. 
  Dalibor glances back at the wall, sees nothing. 

                                          DALIBOR 
                            What is it you see? 

  Dalibor releases his grip, just a bit. 

                                          DALIBOR 
                          Who is it who haunts you? 

  Kirby can't answer. He just gasps, drawing as much air as he  
  can.                                           DALIBOR 
                            Will they be waiting for 
                          you on the other side? 

  Dalibor squeezes harder, and Kirby starts to black out. 


  POV - Kirby 

  As the whole world swims out of focus, Dalibor in close and  
  leering, there's another flash, another circle, so close 
  this time that everything goes dark.  

                                                                        FADE IN ON: 



  The 16mm camera lies on the floor, smashed and smoking. 

  Horst's body lies next to it, his head missing. 

  Kirby stands in the center of the room, spattered in gore, 
  but apparently unharmed. He holds the knife that Dalibor was  
  using, not sure what happened, dizzy. 

  He fights back his revulsion as he steps over all the gore, 
  slipping in it a bit as he makes his way to the door.  
  He stops at a sound... a wheezing rattle. 

  Dalibor. Alive. 

  Kirby walks over, knife still in hand, and looks down at 
  Dalibor. Dalibor bleeds from a ragged slash across his 
  windpipe, gasps to try and catch his breath. 

  Kirby has to lean in closer to hear what Dalibor's saying, 
  over and over. 

                                          DALIBOR 
                          ... fu... fuck... fuck 
                            you... 

  Gripped by sudden fury, Kirby tosses the knife aside and 
  drops in close, so he and Dalibor are face-to-face. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Fuck me? Fuck ME?! 

  He punches Dalibor, as hard as he can, right in the throat.                                            KIRBY 
                            Fuck you, psycho. 

  Dalibor begins to cry, bleeding even more now. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Tell me where the film is. 

  Dalibor can't catch his breath. As he tries harder, the  
  sound is awful, and he begins to shake, desperate. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Tell me who I have to talk 
                          to. 

  He raises his hand to punch Dalibor again. Dalibor shakes 
  his head, manages one word very clearly: 

                                          DALIBOR 
                          NO! 

  Kirby hesitates, and Dalibor takes a moment, holding his 
  throat, trying to get his breath as he points at the crate 
  again. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            What? You have the film? 

  Dalibor shakes his head again. 

                                          DALIBOR 
                          ... Katja. 

  Dalibor stops moving, and a moment later, that rattling 
  wheeze stops, too. He's dead. 

  Kirby walks over and picks up the crate. He roots around in  
  it and finally comes up with an oversized envelope. The  
  return address is for "Katja Backovic." 

  The address is in Vancouver. 



  Kirby bursts into the room and begins to pack as quickly as 
  he can, freaked out, panicked. As he reaches to open another 
  drawer, he catches sight of blood on his sleeve. 

  And then, all at once, it's like the last twelve hours  
  catches up, and he just crumbles, weeping.   But not for long. He regains his composure as best as he 
  can, and he picks up the phone, dials the front desk. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Bonjour. Can you connect me 
                          to Air France, s'il vous 
                            pla t? 

  As he waits for the response -- 

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO: 



  Kirby presses the button for the penthouse and stands back 
  as the doors close. He's nervous, the anxiety building as 
  the elevator starts to rise. 

  Several floors go by with no incident, but then the lights 
  overhead start to flicker. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            ...oh, shit... 

  BOOM! Something hits the top of the elevator, hard. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            STOP IT! 

  BOOM! Something hits it again. 

  Kirby desperately punches the penthouse button, like that's 
  going to somehow speed the elevator up. 

  Suddenly, all the lights in the elevator go out except for 
  the single penthouse button. 

  And in the darkness...a voice... 

                                          ANNIE (O.S.) 
                            Sweeeeetman... Kirby 
                              Sweeeeeeetman... 

  Kirby makes a noise, sad and afraid. 

                                          ANNIE (O.S.) 
                          ... are you my sweet man, 
                            Kirby? 

  Kirby stays close to that button, close to that one little 
  bit of light. 

  As a result, he doesn't see Annie loom up out of the shadows 
  behind him. She's obviously dead, waterlogged, eyes like 
  pools of black. 

  She leans in close enough to whisper right in his ear. 

                                          ANNIE (O.S.) 
                            Will you take care of me... 
                            always?   Kirby screams, just as the door starts to open, and he 
  throws himself through so fast that he slams his head and 
  gashes it, not caring, just manic to escape.



  He scrambles to his feet, shaken, the fresh cut on his  
  forehead starting to bleed. He looks back. No sign of 
  Annie. The lights are back on in the elevator as the doors 
  close. 

  Kirby suddenly realizes where he is and turns around. 

    Backovic's home is warm, beautiful, tastefully appointed. 

  Lots of photos of Backovic. 

  Kirby steps closer and examines a large portrait of 
  Backovic. 

  He's not intimidating, not any sort of overt figure of evil 
  or menace. In most pictures, he's just an ordinary European 
  guy between 20 and 40 years old.  

                                          KATJA (O.S.) 
                          You saw something that 
                            upset you... in the 
                            elevator. 

  Kirby looks over to see someone walking towards him. 

  KATJA BACKOVIC. Half-Indian, half-English. Tall, exotic,  
    beautiful, mid-40's. Gender ambiguous. 

                                          KIRBY 
                          You could say that. 
 
                                          KATJA 
                          Yet now you are here. You 
                            must want this very badly. 
                            You're the first one to 
                            ever make it this far. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                          I'm surprised to find you 
                            here. I expected you to be 
                          in Europe somewhere. 
 
                                           KATJA 
                            This is still very much his 
                            house. He's in every room. 
                            Hans moved us here because 
                          he thought it would become 
                          a place to make films more 
                            affordably than Hollywood 
                            could. Twenty years later, 
                            he's right. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            I have so many questions. 
 
                                          KATJA 
                          I'm not sure I have the 
                            answers you're looking 
                            for... but we'll see. 
                            First, though, let's take 
                          of your forehead. 

  Kirby reaches up and realizes his forehead is bleeding. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            I didn't even realize. 

                                                                            TIME CUT: 



  Kirby sits on a plush couch as Katja cleans and bandages his 
  various cuts and contusions. 

                                          KIRBY 
                          Do you have a print of LA 
                          FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE? 
 
                                          KATJA 
                            That's not what you want to 
                            know. You want to know if 
                          the stories about the film 
                          are true.

                                          KATJA 
                            Yes. Unfortunately. Why are 
                          you looking for the film? 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            Because I'm being paid. 
 
                                           KATJA 
                            That's an excuse. If 
                            someone paid you to kill a 
                            man, would you? 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                          No. Of course not. 
 
                                          KATJA 
                          But you've been warned 
                            about this. LA FIN ABSOLUE 
                          DU MONDE is no ordinary 
                            film.

                            Y'know what? Everyone's 
                            said that to me, like 
                            that's going to convince me 
                          to back off. I don't want 
                          an ordinary film. I  
                            want to see something 
                            extraordinary.

                          You sound exactly like 
                            Hans. He was willing to do 
                            anything to make his films 
                            stand out.

                            suggestions and hints. Who 
                            produced the film?

                            question... many times. 
                            "The Producers of this film 
                            have produced many things. 
                            Chaos. Sorrow. Suffering. 
                            Famine."

                            What does that mean? The 
                            Devil? 
                                          KATJA                             Hans never put a name on 
                          it. "Evil is evil," he 
                            would say. "Does a name 
                            really matter?" 

  Katja steps back, checks the fresh bandage on his head. 

                                          KATJA 
                            Looks like you'll live. 
                            Come with me. I have 
                            something to show you. 


  Kirby follows Katja into a room that's been converted into 
  an editing studio. An old fashioned KEM flatbed editing 
  table sits dormant.

                          How did he die? There was 
                            never an official obituary. 
 
                                          KATJA 
                            Hans became obsessed with 
                          LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE. 
                            During the last year of his 
                            life, all he did is watch 
                          it. Like a punishment.  


  HANS BACKOVIC sits at the sound mixing console, watches 
  images on a screen we can't see. Backovic slows everything 
  down, backs it up.  

                                          KATJA (V.O.) 
                          In the end, he got too 
                            close to the fire. The film 
                          was too effective. 

  Backovic stops for a moment, peers into the deep shadows at 
  the corners of the room, cocks his head, listens:  

  A low hiss, a whisper, a name... "Backovic."    Backovic looks back at his screen. All we see is the light 
  as it plays across his face.  

                                          KATJA (V.O.) 
                          It got inside him. It made 
                          him crazy.  

  Backovic shakes, like he's having a seizure, then suddenly 
  stops. His face goes slack, as he stands up and heads for 
  the door.  



  Emotion stops Katja for a moment. She blinks back tears.  

                                          KATJA  
                          He stopped in the kitchen 
                            before he came to find me 
                          in the bedroom.  

  She opens her shirt at the throat, just a bit, enough to 
  expose an awful white scar. 

                                          KATJA 
                          He meant to kill us both, 
                          but when Hans cut my 
                            throat, he only disfigured 
                          me. When he cut his own 
                            throat, he died. I'm not 
                            sure I got the better deal.  

  She covers her throat again, can barely look at Kirby, the 
  pain still fresh even this many years later.  

                                          KATJA  
                            I was left to take care of 
                          LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE. I 
                            hate the film, and I 
                            understand the power of it. 
                            I wish it had never been 
                            made.  
                            (pause) 
                          Do you understand what 
                            that's like, Kirby? Wanting 
                          to do penance for 
                            something, but knowing it's 
                          too late?  


  Kirby pulls Annie out of the tub, tries to hold her slashed 
  wrists closed.    He pulls her close, wails, the entire flashback silent. 



  Kirby tries to hold back sudden, unexpected tears. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Yeah. I do. 
 
                                          KATJA 
                            People said terrible things 
                            about Hans. Some people 
                            said he deserved his death. 
                            Maybe he did. But I miss 
                          him terribly. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            Mrs. Backovic... 
 
                                          KATJA 
                            Katja. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            Katja. Can I see the print? 
                            Please. 

  Katja thinks about it for a long moment, until Kirby opens 
  his mouth to say something. 

  Before he can, she stands up and walks over to the corner, 
  where she clears away a few boxes. 

  Two films cans rest on the heating vent. 

                                          KATJA 
                            I put it there half-hoping 
                          it would get ruined 
                            somehow. Hasn't worked yet. 
                            I hate even having it in 
                          the house. 

  Kirby walks over and turns the cans around. 

  Written on the side of each: LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Ever since I started trying 
                          to track it down, I've been 
                            seeing flashes. Circles in 
                          the air, with something 
                            inside.                                           KATJA 
                          The cigarette burns. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            Right. Exactly. And every 
                            time I do... 
 
                                          KATJA 
                            Terrible things happen. 
                            (Kirby nods) 
                            When did they start? 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            I heard a tape of an 
                            interview with Hans. As 
                            soon as I heard his 
                            voice... 
 
                                          KATJA 
                          ... you were marked. That's 
                          how potent LA FIN ABSOLUE 
                          DU MONDE is. It doesn't 
                            just affect you when you 
                            watch it. As soon as you 
                            start getting close to it, 
                          it rubs off on you, like 
                          you stepped in quicksand. 
                          So go ahead... take the 
                            film. 

  Kirby picks the cans up as Katja watches sadly. 

                                          KATJA 
                            It's already too late.


  Walter sits across the street again, watching Kirby. Kirby 
  finishes the call, runs over, jumps back into his car. As he 
  pulls away, Walter starts his car and follows. 



  The house is dead quiet. Kirby walks in, peeking into rooms. 

                                          KIRBY 
                          Mr. Bellinger? 

  Fung lurches out of one of the rooms, stripped to the waist, 
  cuts all over his chest, bleeding freely. But what concerns 
  Kirby most is the knife in Fung's hand. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Hey... Bellinger called me. 
 
                                          FUNG 
                          You brought that film in 
                            this house. 

  Fung steps closer and Kirby keeps his eyes on the knife. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            I don't want any trouble. 
 
                                          FUNG 
                          But you brought trouble 
                            into this house, didn't 
                            you? And now you're back. 
                            Well, I know what you want. 
                          You want to see the movie. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                          No. I don't. 
 
                                          FUNG 
                            Yes, you do. And I hope you 
                          get what you want. What you 
                            deserve. 

  Fung swings the knife up and Kirby flinches back -- 

  -- as Fung stabs out his own eyes with sharp, sudden 
  motions! 

  Fung collapses as he laughs, an awful, mirthless sound. 



  Kirby steps in. Onscreen, closing credits are rolling.                                           KIRBY 
                            Bellinger? 

  No answer. Kirby waits for his eyes to adjust to the 
  darkness, looking up at the screen as he does. 

  Just then, the film runs out, and the theater is flooded 
  with white light as the projector continues to play.  
  Kirby looks up toward the projection booth and glimpses 
  Bellinger moving around the back of one of the projectors. 



  Kirby walks up the stairs into the booth. He can't quite see 
  Bellinger as he moves around one of the two projectors. 

  There's blood on the floor, on the projector. 

                                          BELLINGER (O.S.) 
                          You missed the good part. 

  Kirby climbs the last few stairs and steps into the room so 
  he can see better. He finally sees what Bellinger holds in 
  one hand. A long gleaming straight razor.  

                                          KIRBY 
                            What's going on? 

  Bellinger looks down, sees the razor, reacts like he 
  suddenly remembered it was in his hand. 

                                          BELLINGER 
                          Oh, don't worry. 
                              Everything's fine. 

  Bellinger lays the razor on top of the projector. 

                                          KIRBY 
                          You sure about that? Maybe 
                            I should call a doctor 
                            or... 

  Bellinger smiles sadly. It's odd seeing a man like this look 
  so vulnerable, shaky.                                           BELLINGER 
                            I've done terrible things 
                          in my life. You don't make 
                          as much money as I have 
                            without burying a few 
                            bodies. You can sleep at 
                            night just as long as they 
                            stay buried. Trouble is... 
                            they never do. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                          You watched LA FIN ABSOLUE 
                          DU MONDE. 

  Bellinger nods. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            And..? 
 
                                          BELLINGER 
                            I... highly recommend it. 
                            It's not a movie, however. 
                            It's a preview. It's the 
                            coming attractions of the 
                            soul. And, in my case, it's 
                            a hell of an ending. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                          On the phone... you said 
                          you needed help. 
 
                                          BELLINGER 
                            I was going to ask you to 
                            find another movie for me. 
                            After all... you did such a 
                            good job with this one. But 
                            I don't need it now. I've 
                            been inspired. I made my 
                          own movie. 

  As Bellinger starts the second projector running, Kirby 
  takes a few more steps towards him, and now he can see what 
  Bellinger's doing, can see what's about to happen -- 

                                          KIRBY 
                          OH, GOD, NO! 

  Bellinger has slit his stomach open, and he has managed to 
  thread the end of his small intestine into the projector! 

  As soon as he starts it running, it pulls and begins to 

  Kirby practically falls down the steps in his haste to 
  scramble away from Bellinger and his screams of agony. 

  He turns to run -- 

  -- and comes face to face with Walter Matthews, holding a 
  small gun on him! 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Jesus... Walter... what are 
                            you..? 
 
                                          WALTER 
                            What's going on in here? 
                            What kind of... filthy... 
                            fucking... 

  Walter looks up at the screen, at the psychedelic rainbow of 
  gore coming from the projector. 

                                          WALTER 
                          ... WHAT IS THIS?!? 

  Kirby takes a step towards Walter. 

  BLAM! Walter squeezes off a shot, a nervous twitch more than 
  anything. He misses Kirby, but just barely. Kirby freezes. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            Walter, we shouldn't be 
                            here. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                            You're right. But lately 
                            I've been spending a lot of 
                            time doing things I 
                            wouldn't have expected. 
                            Like sitting outside your 
                            theater for days at a time 
                            with a loaded gun. Like 
                            letting my business go to 
                            hell while I figure out 
                            ways to ruin your life. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            I tried to save Annie. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                            Shut up. 
 
                                           KIRBY 
                            I tried. I know I screwed 
                          up. I know it's my fault 
                          she ever tried heroin. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                            YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT IT 
                            IS!! 

  He hits Kirby with the gun, across the face. 

                                          KIRBY 
                          You want to do this, let's 
                          go somewhere else. But not 
                            here. Not now.  
 
                                          WALTER 
                            I've been waiting to do 
                            this... fantasizing about 
                          it, really. But I never had 
                          an opportunity. I didn't 
                            want to throw my life 
                            away... and now... if you 
                          get shot here... what does 
                          it matter? Who's going to 
                            notice? Just one more  
                            freak on the stack of 
                            bodies tomorrow. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                          YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS! 
 
                                          WALTER 
                            YES! I DO! 

  From the projection booth comes the sound of one projector 
  shutting down, plunging the screening room into darkness. 

  Kirby jumps forward and grabs Walter's gun hand. 

  As they struggle, Kirby looks up at the screen. He sees  
  another of those flashes -- a cigarette burn that hangs in 
  front of the screen for a few seconds. 

  The second projector starts, and Kirby finds himself looking 
  up at the opening titles, in French, for LA FIN ABSOLUE DU 
  MONDE.  

                                          KIRBY 
                            WALTER! PLEASE! WE HAVE TO 
                            LEAVE!   There's a second cigarette burn that appears in front of the 
  screen and the whole world FADES TO WHITE --



  -- and when Kirby comes to, he's sitting in the screening 
  room, right in the middle. 

  There is blood on his hands. Blood up to his wrists. Blood  
  on his shirt, on his face. But none of it is his. 

  Walter sits on the floor in front of the screen, crying. 
  There's blood on his shirt, too, but it's his own. His gun 
  lays on the floor. 

                                          WALTER 
                          ... crazy fucker... crazy 
                            fuck... 

  In front of them -- 


  ONSCREEN 

  LA FIN ABSOLUE DU MONDE. Blown-out 16mm handheld. The 
  PROTAGONIST we saw in the stills, on that desolate country 
  road. Above him, the hand-colored sky throbs a menacing red. 

  There are several QUICK CUTS in the film. Flashes of things, 
    subliminal almost. A mouth clamped around bleeding flesh. 
  Hands clawing at a wall, fingernails crumbling. A man  
  standing silhouetted in a doorway with a long knife in hand. 



  Kirby tries to stand up. But he's too weak. 


  ONSCREEN 

  A group of CHILDREN surround the wounded Angel, the Willowy 
  Being with its wings intact, attacking it with sticks and 
  rocks, laughing the entire time. 

  There's a "bug" in the corner of the screen as the reel 
  ends. 



  Kirby coughs as if punched, spraying a burst of blood.   He wipes his mouth, shocked.


  ONSCREEN 

  The Angel and the Protagonist struggle as the Protagonist 
  uses a straight razor to saw at one of the Angel's wings. 
  The Angel makes a horrible, anguished sound. 

  Another cigarette burn, but this one hovers in front of the 
  screen, and it doesn't disappear as the reel changes. It  
  hangs there, like a window, with flames visible behind it. 

  Suddenly, a face slams into view, screaming, twisted in 
  anguish and horror. Annie's face.



  Kirby recoils, his nose bleeding now. He rubs his eyes 
    furiously, trying to make the image disappear.



  Fung crawls into the atrium, slowly, in obvious pain, his 
  ruined eye sockets still bleeding. 

  He crawls across the floor, out to where the Willowy Being 
  is still chained in place. Fung feels the leg of the Willowy 
  Being and stops crawling. 

  With great effort, Fung reaches into his pocket and produces 
  a small key which he holds up. 

  The Willowy Being reaches down and pets Fung like you would 
  a dog who just fetched you the paper.  

  Even though he's still in unholy pain, Fung manages a 
  horrible smile.



  Sitting there in front of the screen, Walter looks up, 
    dumbfounded. He sees Annie, too.  ONSCREEN 

  As the film continues to play, Annie presses against the 
  cigarette burn from the inside. It's like a window that 
  bulges for a moment, then tears --



  -- spilling Annie out, nude and covered in blood, into the 
  front of the auditorium, onto Walter! 

  Walter freaks out, and Kirby sees now that Walter's missing 
  the hand where he was holding the gun. It's just gone. 
  Ripped clean off. Bleeding profusely. 

                                          WALTER 
                            Annie?! Baby?! 

  Kirby looks up at the screen. The cigarette burn is gone, 
  the screen intact once again, the movie playing again now, 
  the Protaganist digging a hole in a field, covered in dirt 
  and blood. 

  Kirby stands and steps toward them, but Walter looks up at 
  him, tears streaming down his cheeks.  

                                          WALTER 
                            STAY BACK! 
                            (sobs) 
                          You already killed her 
                            once. 

  Kirby watches the screen, trying to make sense of it. 

  Walter puts his jacket around Annie and tries to wipe away 
  all the blood from her face. 

                                          WALTER 
                            Shhh... Daddy's here. It's 
                            gonna be fine, baby. It's 
                            gonna be fine. 

  For a moment, Annie seems to focus on Walter, and she stops 
    screaming. 

                                          ANNIE 
                          ... d-daddy? 

  As Kirby stares up at the screen, he begins to shake, his 
  eyes rolling back into his head.                                           WALTER 
                          I'm right here, Annie. 
 
                                          ANNIE 
                          I'm so... cold... 
 
                                          WALTER 
                          I'm going to get you out of 
                            here. 
 
                                          ANNIE 
                            Daddy... 
 
                                          WALTER 
                          I'm sorry, baby. It's okay 
                            now. 
 
                                          ANNIE 
                          ... I'm hungry. 

  She attacks Walter, tearing at his throat with her teeth! 

  At the same moment, Kirby stops convulsing. His face goes 
  slack, the same way Backovic's did in the flashback. 

  He stands, walks down to where Walter lies on the floor,  
  wrestling with thin air. No sign of Annie at all.  

                                          KIRBY 
                            I see now. I understand. 

  Walter stops and looks up. 

                                          WALTER 
                            Annie? 

  He reaches up, touches his neck. No bite. 

                                          WALTER 
                            What's happening? She was 
                            just here. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                          Of course she was. Because 
                          you won't let her go. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                            I loved her. 
 
                                          KIRBY 
                            I LOVED HER, TOO!   Kirby falls on Walter, who tries to fend him off. Kirby 
  fights with an unnatural calm, slapping Walter's arms away. 

                                          KIRBY 
                          But I see now. As long as 
                          we can't let her go... it's 
                            like we're killing her over 
                          and over. 

  He grabs Walter's head and starts pounding it against the 
  cement floor, driving his thumbs into Walter's eye sockets! 

                                          KIRBY 
                          And we'll never let her go! 
                          Not until we're both dead! 

  Walter claws at Kirby, but Kirby pounds him with an animal 
  fury. Each time he slams Walter's head, blood fountains.  
  Kirby continues hammering until Walter's clearly dead! 

  Kirby takes out Bellinger's check and crams it deep into 
  Walter's mouth. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            THERE'S YOUR FUCKING MONEY! 

  Kirby picks up Walter's gun and walks over to the front row. 
  He sits down and looks up at the screen where the cigarette 
  burn still hangs in place.  

  Annie can be seen on the other side, but she's not screaming  
  now. She smiles out at Kirby. 

  Tears on his cheeks, he smiles back. 

                                          KIRBY 
                            I love you. I'm so sorry. 

  He brings the gun up to his temple.



  At the sound of a single gunshot, the film runs out, and we 
  follow it around, out of the project, onto the platter, 
  where the entire print spins, spins, spins -- 

  -- until a hand reaches in and shuts it off. 


  The Willowy Being carries the print out of the projection 
  room, into the screening room, and pauses to look down at 
  Kirby's body, head splashed open on the carpet. 

                                          WILLOWY BEING 
                            Thank you... for this. 

  The Willowy Being takes the print and leaves, and as the 
  door swings closed, the lights go out, sealing Kirby and 
  Walter and Bellinger in together in 
 

                                                                                  BLACK
