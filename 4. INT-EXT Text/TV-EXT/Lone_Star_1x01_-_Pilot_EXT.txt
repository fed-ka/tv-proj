      An aged, paint peeling three bedroom on a street of the same.  
      This is classic suburbia, Leave It To Beaver s neighborhood 
      on life support, but still kicking. 

      Robert hoists the giant case into the trunk of a ten year old 
      Honda in the driveway.

      He sees his neighbor MATT (24), linebacker build gone soft, 
      working on his car across the street. Robert waves.

                                  ROBERT
                    I thought you set your alarm for 
                    noon.

                                  MATT
                    Steph heard about that. She s been 
                      threatening to do drive-bys, make 
                    sure I m being productive.

                                  ROBERT
                    You still in for the party this 
                    weekend?

                                  MATT
                    It s on my calendar as Free Beer At 
                    Robert s.

                                  ROBERT
                    Actually, the beer s being paid for 
                    with what you lost to me at Poker 
                    Night.

                                  MATT
                    I ll be sure to tell people that 
                    when they complain about me 
                    drinking straight from the tap.

      Robert smiles, lowers the trunk. Lindsay is there when he 
      does. He indicates the yard.

                                  ROBERT
                    Hey, don t let that kid mow the 
                    lawn again.

                                    LINDSAY
                    It s just five bucks and he looks 
                    so pathetic.

                                  ROBERT
                    Then give him five bucks and leave 
                    the lawn. It relaxes me.

      He notices her hand is behind her back.

                                  ROBERT (CONT D)
                    You know, you don t have to give me 
                    something every time I go.                                                                                      3.


                                    LINDSAY
                    Mom did it for my dad and they re 
                    still together.

                                  ROBERT
                    Your dad left twice a year, not 
                    twice a week.

      She shows the hand, reveals she s holding a box of cereal.

                                  ROBERT (CONT'D)
                    Cereal. You re right, this will 
                    bring us closer together.

                                    LINDSAY
                    That s the wrapping. Present s 
                    inside. 
                          (caught)
                    I was in a hurry.

      She holds the box open. He reaches in, pulls out something 
      along with a handful of Cheerios.

      He looks. It s a plastic monkey keychain. 

                                  ROBERT
                    I ll cherish it always.

                                    LINDSAY
                    See that you do.

      He gives her a quick kiss, then-

                                  ROBERT
                    Now, you re sure you can handle all 
                    this party stuff? I left a list of 
                    all the meat I want and I was 
                    thinking we could maybe get like a 
                    softball game together, so I don t 
                    know, get some bats and gloves and 
                    stuff.

      She grins. 

                                    LINDSAY
                    Look how excited you are. You re 
                    like a kid. Should I get a 
                      moonbounce?

                                  ROBERT
                    You should absolutely get a 
                      moonbounce. In fact, don t rent it. 
                    Buy it. I think you and I could get 
                    some mileage out of that.

      She LAUGHS. He pulls her close. Kisses her goodbye. Takes his 
      time. After-

                                  ROBERT (CONT D)
                    I love you.                                                                                      4.


                                    LINDSAY
                            (recovering)
                    I m convinced.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Robert goes straight to the VIP area with the waiting cars.

      CLOSE ON the trunk as he hoists his own big suitcase in.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      We see the trunk open. Then Robert reaches in and we see the 
      giant suitcase open. Hold on all the clothes, then...


      Robert, now in completely different clothes and looking like 
      he might have just stepped off a golf course, rings the bell.

      A MAN (ERIC) opens the door. He looks like he might have just 
      finished eighteen himself. Robert extends his hand.

                                  ROBERT
                    Morning. Robert Allen.


      Robert stands in the doorway miming a swing as they exchange 
      golf tips. They wave goodbye.                                                                                      8.



      This time, Robert steps out directly onto the tarmac where a 
      sleek Gulfstream G5 waits with its stairs down. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Robert stops as his NEIGHBOR grabs his mail across the 
      street. Robert waves.

                                  ROBERT
                    Evening.

      The neighbor completely ignores him, steps into his garage 
      and immediately lowers the door, ending the conversation 
      before it begins. 

                                  ROBERT (CONT'D)
                          (to himself)
                    Good talk.

      Robert pulls out his keys, monkey keychain and all, and 
      unlocks the front door.


      Cat is bursting out of her skin as they wait. 

                                  CAT
                    I m so proud of you! To finally 
                    have you working with Daddy, this 
                    is everything I ve been hoping for. 

                                  BOB
                    Let s not jump the gun. We ve got 
                    our own thing, you know. I need to 
                    really think about this.

      Cat looks at him, realizing for the first time that he s 
      seriously on the fence.

                                  CAT
                    But, honey, you d be perfect, and 
                    they really need someone who-

      Clint HONKS from behind the wheel of a large pickup.

                                  BOB
                    Go on. We ll talk about it later.

      She kisses him.                                                                                    16.


                                  CAT
                    You know I trust your judgement, 
                    but this would really mean 
                      everything to me.

      She heads for Clint s truck. Once she s gone, Bob pulls the 
      Nokia phone from his left pocket: 2 Messages.


      A deep sky and towering clouds swirl over a vast undulating 
      landscape. Clint and Cat CLIP CLOP through on horseback like 
      figures wandering in a postcard.

                                  CLINT
                    Forget just putting you in the 
                    ground. They ll blast you into 
                    space for a price. Press you into a 
                    diamond. Read the other day, I m 
                    not making this up, they can turn 
                    you into lead for a pencil. How 
                    would you like that? Get to write 
                    up shopping lists with your dead 
                      relatives.

      Cat eyes him. They ride in silence for a moment.

                                  CAT
                    You re not... sick or something are 
                    you?

      Clint LAUGHS.

                                  CLINT
                    Jesus. Turn sixty and you so much 
                    as mention death everybody thinks 
                    you re about to kick. I m just 
                    making conversation. I ve got at 
                    least another sixty before you turn 
                    me into anything.

                                  CAT
                    Good.

      They ride to the top of a small rise, stop. From here, the 
      views stretch on for days. They drink it in without a word.

      After a moment Cat senses Clint s eyes on her. She turns to 
      find him staring. She seems to understand, lets him look.

                                  CLINT
                    You dodged a bullet, you know.

                                  CAT
                    How s that?

                                  CLINT
                    Don t think my features would have 
                    looked good on a woman. Lucky for 
                    you, you look just like her.                                                                                    17.


      Cat turns back to the view. Clint lingers on her, then looks 
      around.

                                  CLINT (CONT'D)
                    This was her favorite spot.

                                  CAT
                    I know.

      A long silence. Only the clouds move.

                                  CLINT
                    I don t think your brothers even 
                    remember.

                                  CAT
                    They may have forgotten the exact 
                    day, but they remember, trust me. 

                                  CLINT
                    364 days a year I m pretty much 
                    past it. Just this one I wish... 
                    hell, I d settle for a pencil.

      Cat smiles. A long beat. They change the subject with their 
      eyes. 

                                  CAT
                    Thank you.

                                  CLINT
                    Nothing to thank me for. You ve 
                    been campaigning for him since the 
                    day you met. Just took me longer to 
                    listen than I care to admit.  Got 
                    all wrapped up in wanting my little 
                    girl to go to a guy from money with 
                    obvious prospects for making more 
                    of it.

                                  CAT
                    We tried that the first time, 
                    remember?

                                  CLINT
                    Yes. And I was wrong about that one 
                    too. Apparently a good family name 
                    does not prevent you from being an 
                    ass.

                                  CAT
                    Having Trammell should have taught 
                    you that.

      Clint LAUGHS.

                                  CAT (CONT D)
                    You know, if I hadn t quit school 
                    to marry that moron you could be 
                    working with me instead of Tram.                                                                                     18.


                                  CLINT
                    As far as I m concerned only two 
                    good things came out of your first 
                    marriage: Grace, and the fact that 
                    it kept you away from the business. 
                    It s an ugly world where people do 
                    ugly things, me included. I ve 
                    never wanted that for you.

                                  CAT
                    But now you want it for my husband?

                                  CLINT
                    Nope. I want Bob to keep doing just 
                    what he s doing. If there s heads 
                    to be cracked, I ll handle it. Lord 
                    knows I ve spent a lifetime 
                      practicing.

                                  CAT
                    I just hope... 

                                  CLINT
                    You think he might not take it?

                                  CAT
                    He s got pride. You guys didn t 
                    want him before. He remembers that.

                                  CLINT
                    Can t blame him. If it were me, I d 
                    say you can stick that job right up 
                    your ass, old man. But I think 
                    Bob s going to say yes. 

                                  CAT
                    Why s that?

                                  CLINT
                    Cause I think he might just be a 
                    better man than I am.


      Bob rolls up to a busy rig in his rental and steps out. He 
      eyes the workers, looking for the man to talk to.

      NEW ANGLE as Bob walks up to the FOREMAN with his hand out.

                                  BOB
                    Hi there. Ted Lanford. I m a 
                    location scout. Got a director and 
                      a producer looking to shoot a movie 
                    out here, I wanted them to get a 
                    look at this place. We won t get in 
                    your hair, just need to be able to 
                    show them around. And the 
                      director s a little skittish, so 
                    probably better if no one talks to 
                    him. That won t be a problem, will 
                    it?

      The Foreman pulls back his hand to see two hundred dollar 
      bills in it. He looks up. A beat, then-

                                    FOREMAN
                    You need hard hats?

                                  BOB
                    Got our own, thanks.                                                                                    27.



      Bob, now wearing a hard hat that reads Petro Partners is 
      loading a briefcase on the hood of his rental. On top of 
      thick stacks of blank paper he places real money. 

      When he s done, it looks like the briefcase is full of money. 
      Satisfied, he closes it.


      Bob carries the briefcase as he walks around the rig with 
      LARRY, the nervous investor. He points to various things.

                                  BOB
                    My understanding is that they re 
                    driving through 8000 feet today and 
                    they ll start their first tests 
                    with the blender in the next couple 
                    weeks or so.

      Suddenly a pickup truck pulls up right behind them. Bob 
      stops, turns.

      Out of the driver s side comes his dad, John, also wearing a 
      Petro Partners hardhat.

                                  BOB (CONT D)
                    Oh, perfect, here s our foreman, 
                    Bill.

      John shakes the investors hand.

                                  JOHN
                    Nice to meet you, sir. You like a 
                    little tour?

                                  LARRY
                    Yes. Very much.


      John walks Bob and Larry through the site, pointing to this 
      and that, speaking with authority. 

      True to his word, the real Foreman keeps his head down and 
      completely ignores the visitors.


      The little group is back at John s truck, maps and geological 
      reports spread out across the hood. John s finishing his 
      spiel.

                                  JOHN
                    Certainly no sure things, but from 
                    the samples we ve seen so far? This 
                    thing s a home run. 

      Larry seems reassured, but iffy.                                                                                     28.


                                  BOB
                    None of which matters, Larry, if 
                    you re not comfortable. And 
                    frankly, you re right to ask 
                      questions. No shortage of scam 
                    artists looking to seize on some 
                    little nugget in the news and make 
                    a quick buck out here. This is a 
                      relationship business, one that s 
                    built on faith and trust. And 
                    frankly, those things are a lot 
                    more important to me than money. I 
                    can sell your share a thousand 
                    different times, but I only get to 
                    be your friend once. So I d like to 
                    buy you out. Give you back your 
                    entire initial investment, just 
                    part ways. No harm, no foul, we re 
                    still on each other s Christmas 
                    card lists. 

      Bob takes the briefcase and slaps it on the hood of the 
      truck. He opens it to reveal what appear to be stacks of 
      money.

                                  BOB (CONT D)
                    Didn t even want you wondering if 
                    the check was any good. Wanted you 
                    to have something you could take 
                    straight to the bank.

      He closes the briefcase, hands it to Larry. This is a huge 
      gamble, but Bob is as cool as they come. A long beat.

      Instead of reaching for the case, Larry puts up his hands.

                                  LARRY
                    That s really not necessary. I just 
                    wanted to do some checking, you 
                    know? But you ve more than 
                    satisfied my concerns. I d really 
                    like to stay invested.

      Bob keeps the case out.

                                  BOB
                    You sure, Larry? I don t want to 
                    risk our friendship over this.

                                  LARRY
                    I m very sure, Robert. In fact, 
                    based on what I ve seen, I d really 
                    like to buy two more shares. If 
                    they re still available, and you ll 
                    have me.

      Larry looks at Bob beseechingly. Suddenly this is further 
      than Bob meant to go. He stammers for a beat, seems like he 
      might balk. Then John steps in.                                                                                    29.


                                  JOHN
                    Frankly, that s probably about the 
                    best investment you ll ever make. I 
                    just wish I had the funds to put in 
                    myself.

      NEW ANGLE as Larry finishes writing a check for 100,000 
      dollars on the hood of the pickup. He tears it off, hands it 
      to Bob.

                                  LARRY
                    Thank you, Robert.

      Bob shakes his hand.

                                  BOB
                    Sure, Larry. Be well.

      Larry waves, then gets in his car and goes.

      John looks at Bob.

                                  JOHN
                    I d say I taught you everything you 
                    know, but you ve got moves I ve 
                    never seen. That was a pleasure to 
                    watch. They start begging you to 
                    take their money it s hard to even 
                    feel sorry for them.

      He pats Bob on the shoulders.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    All right. I gotta return the 
                    truck. Where you headed?

      Bob s a little bit dazed.

                                  BOB
                    Midland.

                                  JOHN
                    Midland? What the hell for? Haven t 
                    you milked that place dry?

                                  BOB
                    I just like the place.

                                  JOHN
                    Well, you better watch yourself. 
                    Clock s ticking out there.

      His dad heads for the truck. Bob stares down at the check.

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:


      Bob waits as a CLERK unlocks the door.

                                  CLERK
                    Good morning.


      Bob walks out armed with a little blue bag and a giant smile.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Bob drives past a sign that says WELCOME TO MIDLAND in his 
      aged little Honda.


      Bob pulls up, opens the door, drinks in the scene. His house, 
      his neighborhood, his lawn. Without even going inside, he 
      starts to unbutton his shirt.


      Now topless, Bob pushes his lawnmower across the yard, making 
      perfect little lines. Lindsay steps onto the front porch and 
      shakes her head like he s crazy.

      He shrugs and smiles in a way that says,  It s just the way I 
      am.  It s as content as we ve seen him look.


      Practice. Trammell and Drew are focused on Trammell s son, 
      the quarterback, TATE THATCHER, as he zings a ball downfield.

      Drew WHISTLES with admiration.                                                                                    36.


                                  TRAMMELL
                    Fox Sports has him as the top 
                    prospect in the state. That s as a 
                    junior. Talked to Pete Carroll 
                      yesterday.

      Drew watches in reverie.

                                  DREW
                      I remember those days. God, 
                    wouldn t you give like, anything, 
                    to go back? Just for a while?

                                  TRAMMELL
                          (eyes on the field)
                    You never had days like that.
                          (redirecting)
                    About this Bob thing. We need to 
                    get on the same page.

      Drew is only half listening, his eyes now on the practicing 
      cheerleaders.

                                  DREW
                    I thought it sounded like a good 
                    thing. Bob s been doing well.

                                  TRAMMELL
                    Maybe so, maybe not, but that s no 
                    reason to jump the line. We ve put 
                    in our time. What do we get?

      Drew shrugs, unsure.

                                  TRAMMELL (CONT D)
                    So what if he is making money? Dad 
                    used to crush guys like Bob, not 
                    hire them. The mere fact that he 
                    wants to bring him in makes me 
                    think he s losing his edge.

                                  DREW
                    Dad? He punched out a roughneck for 
                    stealing pipe three weeks ago. Ask 
                    that dude if he s going soft.

      Trammell s face says that for all his talk, Clint s still not 
      someone he wants to tangle with.

                                  DREW (CONT D)
                    Besides, what s Dad supposed to do? 
                    Bob s family. 

                                  TRAMMELL
                    Yeah? Ask Uncle Roy if that 
                    matters.

                                  DREW
                    Uncle Roy s dead.
                          (walked into that one)
                    Oh.                                                                                    37.


                                  TRAMMELL
                    Look, I ll figure all this out. All 
                    I need from you is to know that 
                    you ll support me.

      Drew looks at Trammell, surprised by the request.

                                  DREW
                          (genuine)
                    We re brothers, Tram. Of course.

      A WHISTLE from the field as practice breaks. As Tate steps 
      off he gets a hug from a KNOCKOUT CHEERLEADER.

      Drew sees this and smiles.

                                  DREW (CONT'D)
                    Damn! Is that his girlfriend?

      Trammell stands, collects his stuff.

                                  TRAMMELL
                    Yeah.

      Drew shakes his head in appreciation.

                                  DREW
                    Just like his Uncle Drew.

      As Trammell heads out.

                                  TRAMMELL
                    Trust me, we re not going to let 
                    that happen.

      Drew, blindsided, waits a few beats then flips the bird to 
      his brother s back as he walks away.


      Grace slides over to Tate, both of them eying the stands.

                                  GRACE
                    Is that Uncle Drew flipping off 
                    your dad?

                                  TATE
                    Looks that way.

                                  GRACE
                    Why are they here?

                                  TATE
                    Dad shows up to watch a couple days 
                    a week. I guess Drew came out to 
                    flip him off.

      Tate s girlfriend KAYLA (the cheerleader) looks at Grace.                                                                                    38.


                                  KAYLA
                    Hey Grace.

      Grace just nods, intimidated by the older, prettier girl.

                                  GRACE
                          (to Tate)
                    You ready?

                                  TATE
                    Yeah.
                          (to Kayla)
                    Call you later.

      He kisses her on the cheek. Grace watches with a tinge of 
      jealousy. Tate may be her cousin, but that doesn t mean she 
      doesn t eye him just like all the other girls do.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      CRACK! Bob rips a liner into left field. As people CHEER he 
      drops his bat and runs for first. 

                                                                SERIES OF SHOTS:

      BOB RUNS past second base. The players converge on him and 
      point him back. He returns to second where s he s forced to 
      down a beer from a keg just behind the base before stumbling 
      on to third.

      LINDSAY THROWS the ball to Steph who chases Matt down between 
      bases. When she gets close, he starts to run in circles, 
      makes her chase him into the outfield.

      BOB CHUCKS the ball from the outfield to home plate where a 
      LITTLE GIRL playing catcher scoops it up just in time to see 
      Matt barreling down on her from third. 

      The girl closes her eyes. At the last second, instead of 
      sliding into her, Matt hoists her up with both arms, holding 
      her at a distance where she can t reach him with the ball, 
      and leaps on home plate with her in his arms.

      People crowd around, LAUGHING, debating, as Matt accepts a 
      victory beer from Lindsay. Off him hoisting it high-

                                                                            CUT TO:


      It s a party in full swing. Family, friends, the odd party 
      hat. 

      Matt mans the keg, refilling his own glass between pours for 
      others. 

      Yes, there s actually a moonbounce, with kids of various ages 
      jumping and flopping with glee.

      Steph and Lindsay chat up a group of their girlfriends. 
      Lindsay looks over and winks at-

      Bob, at the center of it all, lording over a grill and 
      perfectly tamed lawn, a man in the midst of suburban ecstacy. 

      He distributes meat fresh from the fire to people as they 
      step near.

      Lindsay s PARENTS (CAROL and ED), salt of the Earth types 
      with warm grins, each hold out a bun for Bob to fill.

                                  ED
                          (re: the burgers)
                    Lookin  good, Robert.

                                  BOB
                    I can t do  em half as good as you 
                    Ed. Just trying not to set myself 
                    on fire back here.                                                                                    40.


      Ed LAUGHS as Bob serves him up.

                                  CAROL
                    Looks like you re still taking good 
                    care of our little girl.

                                  BOB
                    I try, but somehow Lindsay always 
                    ends up taking care of me.

                                  CAROL
                    Now I know that s not true. 
                    Frankly, you re taking care of all 
                    of us.

                                  ED
                    Yes, indeed. We got our latest 
                      statements. Looks like things are 
                    going great with the wells.

      And like that we see the first dent in Bob s perfect mood.

                                  BOB
                    Uh, yeah. Just plugging away.

                                  ED
                    We just feel so fortunate to have 
                    been able to get in on the ground 
                    floor of such an opportunity. Our 
                    friends too. We all call each other 
                    every time we get our new balances.

                                  CAROL
                    You ve made Ed the most popular guy 
                    at the Lodge.

      Now it just plain stings. Bob s looking for an exit.

                                  BOB
                    You know what, I m just going to 
                    grab a beer.

                                  ED
                    All right, son. Enjoy.

      Bob steps away and quickly heads for the beer line. He stares 
      blankly into space.

                                  MATT
                    Beer, Chief?

      Startled, Bob looks up. Matt holds out a beer.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    For the man of the hour. Where 
                    would we be without him?

      Bob takes the beer.                                                                                    41.



      It s late, things have started to wind down. Matt and Bob sit 
      at a table watching Lindsay and Steph still dancing.

      As the song ends the girls head for the keg. Steph pours, 
      hands one to Lindsay.

                                  STEPH
                    One more song and then we hit the 
                      moonbounce.

      Lindsay LAUGHS, then casually hands the beer back.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Actually, I m just going to stick 
                    with water.

                                  STEPH
                    Come on. What kind of person throws 
                    a bash in their own backyard and 
                    then spends the whole time drinking-

      And then Steph gets it.

                                  STEPH (CONT'D)
                    No WAY!

      Lindsay tries to keep a lid on it, but can t help but smile.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Shhh. It s very, very, very early. 
                    You can t say anything. I haven t 
                    even told Robert.

      Steph gives her a giant hug.

                                  STEPH
                      Congratulations! Oh my God, this 
                    makes me want to go sleep with my 
                    husband.

      Lindsay LAUGHS.

                                  STEPH (CONT D)
                    When are you going to tell him?

                                    LINDSAY
                    I don t know. I want to wait a 
                    little, make sure it s for real.

      Steph can t contain herself. She starts jumping up and down.

      ANGLE ON Matt and Bob as they watch the girls jumping and 
      SCREECHING before running to the moonbounce.

                                  MATT
                    I swear, those girls bring out the 
                    crazy in each other.                                                                                    42.


      He finishes his beer. Both he and Bob seem distant, 
      contemplative.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    Good party, man. Almost makes this 
                    place bearable.

      Bob doesn t say anything. He s just watching Lindsay and 
      Steph jumping and LAUGHING.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    Gonna start looking for work in Ft. 
                    Worth, maybe Dallas, see if we 
                    can t finally move on, move up for 
                    once.

      Bob sips his beer.

                                  BOB
                    Moving up s not all it s made out 
                    to be. There s something to be said 
                    for being right here.

                                  MATT
                    Shoot man, this place is like being 
                    on an island. You get stuck here, 
                    you never get out.

                                  BOB
                    Yeah, but the bad stuff doesn t get 
                    in. Keeps this place the way it 
                    used to be. The way it should be. 
                    Just simple. Real. I wish I d grown 
                    up in a place like this.

                                  MATT
                    Where did you grow up?

      Bob looks up at the stars. He takes a long beat.

                                  BOB
                    Doesn t matter now. The point is, 
                    you re lucky to live here, Matt. 
                    You shouldn t forget that.

      Matt takes that in. He grabs a random beer glass from the 
      table.

                                  MATT
                    Well, if I m lucky, then you are 
                    too, right?

      Matt raises his glass.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    To being lucky.

      Bob hesitates, then-

                                  BOB
                    To being lucky.                                                                                    43.


      Bob taps his glass. They both drink. 


      Everyone is gone. Bob cleans in the backyard. Through the 
      window he can see Lindsay doing dishes. He stops, watches.


      Bob walks to his car, opens the passenger side. Inside, on 
      top of his briefcase full of  money , is the Tiffany s bag. 

      As he reaches for it, his Iphone rings.

                                  BOB
                    Hello.

                                  JOHN
                          (filter)
                    Where are you?

                                  BOB
                    Midland, I told you.

                                  JOHN
                    Get out.

                                  BOB
                    What?

                                  JOHN
                    Get out. Now.

                                  BOB
                    Dad, I m right in the middle of-

                                  JOHN
                    My contact at the commissioner s 
                    office just tipped me off. Lawyer 
                    in Midland is requesting the deed 
                    on the well for one of your 
                      investors. Soon as he finds out you 
                    don t own a damn thing that whole 
                    town is going to be looking to set 
                    you on fire. You need to be long 
                    gone.

                                  BOB
                    But-

                                  JOHN
                    Bob! Do you want to go to jail? 
                    CLEAR OUT! NOW!

      Click. Bob looks down at his phone. Looks at the Tiffany s 
      bag in his hand. A long beat. He puts the bag back in the 
      car, closes the door.


      Bob leaves his car pumping, heads in.


      Bob, eyes still moist, walks toward a trash bin. He raises 
      the Tiffany s bag, ready to toss it in. At the last second he 
      hesitates.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      CLOSE ON the trash bin where Bob was about to throw away the 
      Tiffany s bag. We peer inside and among the garbage and 
      things left for dead, see -                                                                                     47.


      The briefcase, spewing stacks of paper, the real money gone. 
      And-

      His NOKIA CELL PHONE.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Bob is waiting again as the clerk opens the door.

                                  CLERK
                    Back so soon?                                                                                    60.


                                  BOB
                    It s been a particularly good week.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The suitcase is loaded onto a luggage trolly.

                                  BOB (V.O.)
                    Well, then I won t give them a 
                    reason to feel like they have to 
                    come after us.

                                                                            CUT TO:
