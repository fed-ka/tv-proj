1EXT. SUBURBAN AMERICAN STREET -- DAY

      The camera pushes in to a SUBURBAN HOUSE.

                    Kids!  Breakfast!

2INT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

      Claire is busy making breakfast for the family.  Phil enters
      in workout clothes.

                                      CLAIRE
                    What's with the workout clothes?
                          (then)
                    Kids!!!

                                    PHIL
                    What?  I work out.
                          (glances toward the
                            camera)
                    Just because I don't run six miles a
                    day like you --

                                      CLAIRE
                    Eight.

                                    PHIL
                    You run eight miles a day?  That's
                    like three-thousand miles a year. 
                    You could have run to Hawaii.

                                      CLAIRE
                    I think about that every single day.

                    I'm having a friend over today.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Haley, you're not wearing that skirt.

                                      HALEY
                    What's wrong with it?

                                      CLAIRE
                    It's too short.  People can tell
                    you're a girl, you don't have to
                    prove it to them.

                    Luke got his head stuck in the
                    banister again.

                                    PHIL
                    I got it.  Where's the baby oil?

                                      CLAIRE
                    It's in our night stan--
                          (eyes camera)
                    I don't know -- find it!

3INTERVIEW -- PHIL & CLAIRE

      SUPER: "Phil & Claire"

                                      CLAIRE
                    Raising kids is like building a car. 
                    You only have so much time to make
                    sure the steering works and the brakes
                    stop and the engine is dependable
                    before you send it out on the road,
                    and if you get one little rivet wrong,
                    it will drive off a cliff and explode.  

      Awkward beat.

                                    PHIL
                    We have a lot of fun.

4EXT SOCCER FIELD -- DAY

      Gloria and Jay watch as Gloria's son Manny plays in a soccer
      game.  Gloria paces around nervously.  Jay, dressed in a
      track suit, sits in a low folding chair, reading the paper.

                                      GLORIA
                    Go, Manny, go!  Kick it!  Don't let
                    him -- kick it!

      The opposing player trips Manny.

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    He tripped him!  Where's the penalty?!  

                                    JAY
                    Gloria, they're oh and six.  Let's
                    take it down a notch.

      An opposing player gets the ball.  It's only Manny between
      him and the goal.          MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    3.
                                         

                                      GLORIA
                          (while HITTING Jay)
                    Get the ball, Manny!  Stop him.  You
                    can do it!

      But Manny gets distracted by a PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL riding by
      on a bicycle.  The opposing player dribbles around Manny and
      SCORES.  An uptight SOCCER MOM approaches the coach, oblivious
      that Gloria is Manny's mom.

                                      SOCCER MOM
                    Come on, Coach, you gotta take that
                    kid out.

      Gloria wheels on her.

                                      GLORIA
                    You want to take him out?!  How about
                    I take you out?!  

      Jay grabs the back of her jacket.

                                    JAY
                    Honey, honey...

                                      GLORIA
                          (to Soccer Mom)
                    Why don't you worry about your son? 
                    He spend the first half with his
                    hand in his pants.

      Gloria moves off, disgusted.  Jay, having been through scenes
      like this before, shakes his head as A SOCCER DAD approaches.

                                      SOCCER DAD
                    Whoa, remind me not to mess with
                    your daughter.

                                    JAY
                    My daughter?  
                          (annoyed, struggles
                          to get up)
                    No, that's funny, actually, no, she's
                    my wife.  Don't be fooled by the --
                    just give me a second here.

                    Gloria and I met the day my ex-wife
                    moved to Florida.  I was feeling pretty
                    emotional and Gloria was one of the

                    party I threw.            MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    4.

                    come from a small village, very poor

                    Why do you keep doing this?

                    needs to be checked by a specialist. 

      Phil frees Luke's head.

                          (to Luke)

      Claire and Haley enter mid-conversation.

                    Who's coming over anyway?

                                      HALEY
                    You don't know him.

                    Him?

                    Ooooh, a boy....  You gonna kiss

                    His name is Dylan.  I might as well
                    just tell him not to come because
                    you guys are just going to embarrass
                    me.

10INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -- DAY

      As before.

                                      HALEY
                    You're not going to embarrass me? 
                    You guys embarrass me every single
                    day!          MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    7.
                                         

                                      CLAIRE
                    Honey, relax.

                                    PHIL
                    Yeah, take a chill pill, biotch.

      SFX:  DOOR SLAM!

                                    ALEX
                    Mom!  Dad!

      Alex appears in the doorway, holding her arm.

                                    ALEX (CONT'D)
                    Luke just shot me!

      Luke enters carrying an air-soft gun.

                                    LUKE
                    I didn't mean to.

      Annoyed, Haley crosses upstairs.

                                      CLAIRE
                          (to Alex)
                    Are you okay?

                                    ALEX
                    No, the little bitch shot me.  

                                    LUKE
                    They're just plastic BB's.  It was
                    an accident.

                                      CLAIRE
                          (to Phil)
                    What did I tell you would happen if
                    you bought him a gun?

                                    PHIL
                          (to Luke)
                    What did I tell you would happen if
                    you shot any animal or any person?

                                    LUKE
                    That you would shoot me.

                                    PHIL
                    That's right!  Come on.  Let's go.

      He starts for the backyard.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Are you insane, you're going to shoot
                    him?!  He's got a birthday party.  
                                      (MORE)          MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    8.
                                         

                                      CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                    He can't show up with a big hideous
                    welt.  You can shoot him later. 
                    He'll be home at two.

                                    ALEX
                    Does anyone care about my hideous
                    welt?

                                    PHIL
                    I can't shoot him at two, I'm showing
                    a house then.  What about three?

      Claire checks her calendar.

                                      CLAIRE
                    No, he's got a soccer game at three. 
                    We've got to leave for that dinner
                    at five.  You can shoot him at four-
                    fifteen.

                                    PHIL
                    Yeah, I guess that works for me.

                                      CLAIRE
                          (writing on calendar)
                    Shoot Luke.

                                    PHIL
                          (to Luke)
                    Have a good day, sport.

11EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

      It is after the soccer game and Gloria and Manny are walking
      toward their car.  Jay lags slightly behind.

                                      MANNY
                    I'm quitting soccer.  It is a game
                    for children.

                                      GLORIA
                    You're not quitting.  You would have
                    stopped that goal if you were staring
                    at that girl again.

                                      MANNY
                    She is not a girl, she's a woman.

                                      GLORIA
                    Yay, will you talk to him? 

      Jay catches sight of the Dad from earlier.          MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    9.
                                         

                                    JAY
                          (under his breath)
                      Jackass...

                                      GLORIA
                    What?

                                    JAY
                    Not Manny, that Jabroney over there
                    in the blue.  He said something to
                    me before I didn't appreciate.

                                      GLORIA
                    What he say?

                                    JAY
                    It doesn't matter.  Drop it.

      They all get into the car. 

                                    JAY (CONT'D)
                    And by the way, that little blow-up
                    of yours with that other Mom -- why
                    do you always have to do stuff like
                    that?  Could you try to remember
                    this is Highland Estates, not
                    Colombia?

                                      GLORIA
                    I don't care where it is, if someone
                    say something about my family --

                                    JAY
                    I know, the whole hot Latin thing. 
                    I'm just saying, it's not a crime to
                    leave some thoughts unexpressed.

                                      GLORIA
                    Like you do, you mean.

                                    JAY
                    No, not like -- well yeah, like me. 
                    Like a man.  A man knows it's not
                      appropriate to go around showing
                    your emotion all the time.

                                      MANNY
                    I want to tell Brenda Feldman I love
                    her.

                                    JAY
                    Oh for Crissakes.

                                      GLORIA
                    Manny, she's sixteen.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    10.
                                         

                                      MANNY
                    Oh, it's okay for you to take an
                    older lover?

                                    JAY
                    Hey, watch it.

                                      MANNY
                    I want to go now, to the mall where
                    she works.  But I need to stop at
                    home first to get my white silk shirt.  

                                    JAY
                    Okay, not to be the evil stepdad
                    here, but that's just not a good
                    idea.

                                      MANNY
                    Stop the car.

      Jay does, and Manny jumps out.

                                      GLORIA
                    Where are you--

      But he's gone.

                                    JAY
                    You do realize that's a suicide
                    mission, right?  He's 13, he's in a
                    new school, and if he declares his
                    love for a 16 year-old girl while
                    wearing a puffy-sleeved white shirt
                    we're going to be heading down to
                    that school Monday morning with a
                    bolt cutter to get him out of his
                    locker.
                          (then noticing)
                    Oh geez, he's picking flowers.

12INTERVIEW -- JAY AND GLORIA

                                      GLORIA
                    Manny is very passionate, like his
                    father.  My first husband was very
                    handsome, but too emotional.  It
                    seemed like all we ever do was fight
                    and make love, fight and make love. 
                    One day, I'm not joking, we fell out
                    the window together.

                                    JAY
                    Which were you doing?  
                          (to camera)
                    I'm hearing this for the first time.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    11.
                                         

13INT. GROCERY STORE -- DAY

      Mitchell is shopping while he holds Lily.  Cameron approaches
      with some items.  He places a pie into their basket.

                                      MITCHELL
                          (re: pie, judgmental)
                    Okay...

                                      CAMERON
                    What?  Your family's coming over and
                    everyone likes pie.

                                      MITCHELL
                    Oh, please, you like pie.  

                                      CAMERON
                    You like pie.  

                                      MITCHELL
                    Not as much as y--  Oh my God, you
                    have blueberry on your fingers.

                                      CAMERON
                    What, we're buying it.

14INTERVIEW -- CAMERON

                                      CAMERON
                    Yes, Mitchell will be keeping his
                    dental practice and I'll be home
                      full-time, but that does not make me
                    "the wife."  Sure, I gained a few
                    pounds while we were expecting the
                    baby, but that was stress.  

      We cut to a shot of Cam hiding in the pantry of their kitchen
      ravenously eating chocolate, hoping not to get caught.

                                      CAMERON  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    It's perfectly normal.  It would be
                    nice if he understood that.

15INT. GROCERY STORE -- MOMENTS LATER

      They are now in line at checkout.

                                      MITCHELL
                    This doesn't worry you, that she
                    barely slept on the plane and she's
                    still wide awake?  I didn't even
                    think Asian eyes opened that wide.  

                                      CAMERON
                    Oh stop worrying.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    12.
                                         

                                      MITCHELL
                    Maybe she just can't fall asleep
                    unless she feels a woman's shape. 
                    That orphanage was all women.  

                                      CAMERON
                    I guess that's possible.

      Mitchell tries to hand Lily to Cameron.

                                      CAMERON (CONT'D)
                    What the hell is that supposed to
                    mean?

                                      MITCHELL
                    I just thought--

                                      CAMERON
                    What, that I'm more womanly?  

                                      MITCHELL
                    Now you're sensitive about that?  It
                    wasn't a problem on Halloween when
                    you just had to be Sarah Palin and I
                    was stuck all night in that John
                    McCain harness. 

                                      CAMERON
                    Is there a particular reason you've
                    been in a bitchy mood all day when
                    this is supposed to be the happiest
                    day of our lives?

                                      MITCHELL
                    I have not been --

      They are now at the checkout line and a few customers are
      behind them including a woman in a wheelchair.

                                      WHEELCHAIR WOMAN
                          (amused)
                    Look at that baby with those Twinkies.

      Mitchell turns on her.

                                      MITCHELL
                    Yeah, it's funny isn't it?  Hilarious! 
                    This baby would have grown up in a
                    crowded orphanage if it weren't for
                    us "twinkies" and I'd think someone
                    like you would have a little sympathy
                    for people who are a little different
                    than --        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    13.
                                         

      Cameron slaps him.  He has noticed that Lily has grabbed a
      Hostess Twinkies pack off the nearby display rack and is
      squishing them.

                                      MITCHELL (CONT'D)
                    What?!

      Mitchell then takes in the picture of Lily with the Twinkies.

                                      CAMERON
                    We'd like to pay for your cat food.

16INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S KITCHEN -- DAY

      SFX: DOORBELL

                                      HALEY (O.S.)
                    Don't answer it.  I'll get it.

      Claire quickly crosses to the door and answers it to find,
      DYLAN, a very tall and mature seventeen-year-old boy.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Hello, you must be Dylan.

                                      DYLAN
                    Hey.  Dylan.  Yeah.

      Haley rushes up and puts herself between Dylan and her mom.

                                      HALEY
                    Hey.  Let's go.

      They head up the stairs.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Hang on.  How old are you, Dylan?

                                      DYLAN
                      Seventeen.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Oh.  That's, um...

      Phil enters.

                                      CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                    Phil, Dylan's here and he's seventeen.

                                    PHIL
                    Sweet.  Let me meet this playa.
                          (offers fist bump)
                    Phil Dunphy, yo.

17INTERVIEW -- PHIL

      Phil stares intently into the camera saying nothing.  Then:        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    14.
                                         


                                    PHIL
                    It's like that.  You just let the
                    eyes do the work.  Your mouth might
                    be saying, "Hey, we cool", but your
                    eyes are saying, "I know what you're
                    here for, and that shiznit is broke."  

18INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -- DAY

      Phil is at the bottom of the stairs as Dylan crosses back
      down to shake hands.  Phil starts to put on his "intimidating"
      face, but as Dylan reaches the ground floor Phil sees that
      Dylan is several inches taller than he is.

                                      DYLAN
                    Hey, what's up?

                                    PHIL
                    Nu-in, nu-in much.

                                      HALEY
                          (hating this)
                    Okay.

      Never losing eye contact, Phil steps up the first step of
      the stairs so that now he's a little taller than Dylan.

                                    PHIL
                    So you two have fun today, just make
                    sure you keep it real, know what I mean?

                                      DYLAN
                          (looks to Haley)
                    Uh..

                                      HALEY
                    Dad!

                                    PHIL
                    That's cool.  That's--

      To be even more intimidating, Phil steps up another step but
      loses his grip on the banister when it slips in some baby
      oil left over from freeing Luke.  He awkwardly saves himself,
      but wrenches his back in the process.

                                    PHIL (CONT'D)
                    Oh boy.  Ohhhh.  That's not good.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Honey?

                                      DYLAN
                    You okay?

                                    PHIL
                    Yeah, I'm ---
                                      (MORE)        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    15.
                                         

                                    PHIL (CONT'D)
                          (unable to stand)
                    -- no I'm not.

19INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

      Dylan carries Phil to the couch, holding him like a baby.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Should I call the doctor?

                                    PHIL
                    No.
                          (to Dylan)
                    You're very strong, Homes.

      Haley is horrified.

                                  END OF ACT TWO        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    16.
                                         

                                      ACT THREE

20INT. MALL - DAY

      Jay, Gloria, and Manny are walking through the mall.  Jay is
      still in his track suit.  Manny now wears his puffy, white
      shirt.  Manny spots Brenda Feldman, the cute 16 year-old we
      saw on her bike earlier, at work in Wetzel's Pretzels.

                                      MANNY
                            (reverently)
                    Brenda Feldman. 

                                    JAY
                    I can't watch this.

        A saleswoman passes, promoting cologne.

                                      SALESWOMAN
                    Panache for Men?

                                    JAY
                          (a little annoyed)
                    No.

                                      MANNY
                    I will take some.
                          (as she spritzes him)
                    Thank you.  And that is a lovely
                    color on you.

                                      SALESWOMAN
                    Well, aren't you a gentleman?

                                      MANNY
                    Yes.

      The saleswoman moves off as Manny pulls some folded sheets
      out of his pocket.

                                      GLORIA
                    What is that?

                                      MANNY
                    A poem I have written for Brenda.

                                    JAY
                    Of course it is.

      Gloria shoots Jay a steely look.

                                      MANNY
                    I put my thoughts into words, and
                    now my words into action.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    17.
                                         

      Manny crosses over to Wetzel's Pretzels.  Jay and Gloria
      watch him go.  It's clear Gloria is giving Jay a cold
      shoulder.

                                    JAY
                    I'll give him one thing, he's got
                    some cahoneys.

                                      GLORIA
                    Please, don't do a torture on my
                    language.

      She turns away from him.

                                    JAY
                    Look, I know you're upset cause I
                    got a little mad in the car.  You
                    want to talk about that?

                                      GLORIA
                    I'm trying to have an unexpressed
                    emotion.

                                    JAY
                    So you're just going to stay mad?

                                      GLORIA
                    I'll just say this:  You could learn
                    from Manny.  He doesn't keep how he
                    feels inside, and it may not work
                    out for him over there today but it
                    will someday.  He's not afraid of
                    how he feels, and women like that.
                          (admiring him)
                    He's like a bullfighter.

                                    JAY
                          (struggling with this
                            a little)
                    Okay, I think I got mad in the car
                    because I was bugged about what that
                    guy said to me at the game.  He
                    thought I was your Dad.  And that's
                    not the first time that's happened,
                    people... thinking I'm too old for
                    you.

      He looks to Manny.  He's reciting his poem now, Brenda holding
      the flowers Manny has brought.  It inspires Jay to go on.

                                    JAY (CONT'D)
                    And I guess I'm worried maybe you'll
                    think that too some day.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    18.
                                         

                                      GLORIA
                          (melted by his honesty)
                    How can you think that?  I would
                    never!  How could I when you're so
                    cute?

      She hugs and kisses him -- the public affection is a little
      too much for Jay. 

                                    JAY
                    Okay, that's enough of that.

                                      GLORIA
                    And if it bothers you and you want
                    to look a little younger, we can get
                    you some hipper clothes.  There's a
                    store right there that--

                                    JAY
                    Let's not go crazy.  I'll be fine.

      Manny rejoins them.

                                      MANNY
                    She has a boyfriend.

                                      GLORIA
                    I'm sorry, Ni o.

      She hugs him.

                                      MANNY
                    I gave her my heart and she gave me
                    a pretzel dog.  
                          (then)
                    That was pretty stupid of me, wasn't
                    it?  

                                    JAY
                    You know what, Manny, no it wasn't
                    stupid. It was fantastic.  You took
                    a big swing and I respect the hell
                    out of that.   C'mon, let's go get
                    some lunch.  Anywhere you want to
                    go.

      They start off, Jay striding briskly. Gloria gives Manny a
      big hug, which causes them to linger behind a bit.  After a
      short distance, Jay is stopped by a security guard.

                                      SECURITY GUARD
                    Excuse me, sir, we ask that all mall-
                    walkers stay to the right.

                                    JAY
                    What?        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    19.
                                         

      He sees that he is being approached by a large group of senior
      citizen mall walkers.  Many of the men are dressed similarly
      to Jay.  They pass him.

                                      SECURITY GUARD
                    Thank you sir.

      The security guard heads off.

                                    JAY
                          (to Gloria)
                    I'll meet up with you guys.

      Jay turns and heads into the funky clothes store as Gloria
      and Manny continue on their way.

21INT. MITCHELL & CAMERON'S CONDO -- DAY

      The front door opens and Mitchell and Cameron enter, carrying
      Lily, their luggage and the groceries.  There is an antique
      '60s robot in one corner.

                                      CAMERON
                    Tada!  Your new home!  Isn't it
                    gorgeous, except for that robot -- I
                    hate to break it to you, your other
                    daddy is a big nerd.  

      They exit into Lily's room.

22INT. LILY'S ROOM  -- CONTINUOUS

      They enter, and Cameron looks up at the ceiling.  On it a
      mural has been painted.  It is a heavenly scene, full of
      clouds.  Emerging from one cloud are Cameron and Mitchell
      painted like angels with wings.

                                      CAMERON
                          (gasping)
                    Oh my God, do you love it?

                                      MITCHELL
                    What the hell is it?

                                      CAMERON
                    I had Andre do it while we were gone. 
                    Look, that's us.

                                      MITCHELL
                    Yeah, I see.  With wings.

                    We're floating above her, always
                    there to protect her.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    20.
                                         

                                      MITCHELL
                    Like fairies, you mean.  Okay, now I
                    get it.  "Yes, we pulled you out of
                    your home in Vietnam, but don't worry,
                    things will be perfectly normal here. 
                    Your dads are floating fairies." You
                    know, I really don't need my family
                      ridiculing me over this tonight. 
                    Call Andre and have him paint
                      something... less gay.

                                      CAMERON
                    That is not that gay.

                                      MITCHELL
                      A triptych of us having sex would be
                    less gay.

                                      CAMERON
                    You know what?  I've put up with
                    this mood of yours all day.  What is
                    your deal?

                                      MITCHELL
                    Nothing.

                                      CAMERON
                    See when he looks at the floor, Lily? 
                    That's what nerdy daddy does when
                    he's lying.

                                      MITCHELL
                    I never told them, all right?

                                      CAMERON
                    What?

                                      MITCHELL
                    I never told my family we were
                    adopting a baby.

                                      CAMERON
                    Are you kidding me?  Why the hell
                    not?

                                      MITCHELL
                    We weren't telling anyone until we
                    knew it was official and then when
                    the agency called last week I had
                    to, you know, pack and --

                                      CAMERON
                    We left two days later and I packed
                    for you!  You wussed out!        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    21.
                                         

                                      MITCHELL
                    Okay fine, my family was going to
                    have a big opinion and I just didn't
                    want to hear it.

                                      CAMERON
                    But it's the ceiling's that's too
                    gay. 

      Mitchell storms off.

23INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S KITCHEN -- DAY

      Claire is at the foot of the stairs.

                                      HALEY (O.S.)
                    Alex, get out!  Mom!

                                      CLAIRE
                          (calling up)
                    Alex, leave your sister alone.

      Alex enters.

                                    ALEX
                    I was just getting my sweatshirt.

                                      CLAIRE
                    You need to respect their privacy.  
                          (then)
                    What are they doing up there?

                                    ALEX
                    Nothing.  Lying on her bed watching
                    a movie.

                                      CLAIRE
                          (trying to be okay
                            with this)
                    Oh.  Oh.  Well, good.  So, I'm making
                    a cake for tonight, want to help me?

                                    ALEX
                    Can I do the frosting?

                                      CLAIRE
                    Sure, sweetie.

      Claire begins to tie an apron around Alex.

                                      CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                    Wow, I remember when you used to
                    trip over this thing.

      They smile at that memory, maybe Claire rubs noses with her.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    22.
                                         

                                    ALEX
                    So, if Haley got pregnant, would you
                    ever do one of those weird things
                    where you pretend she has mono for a
                    few months and then tell everyone
                    the baby is yours?

                                      CLAIRE
                    What?

                                    ALEX
                    This senior at school was "out sick"
                    for like four months, but Robby
                    Richman swears he saw her
                      breastfeeding at a California Chicken
                    Cafe. 

24EXT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S BACK YARD -- DAY

      Phil holds the gun.

                                    PHIL
                    What are you wearing?

      Reveal Luke wearing three shirts, a big jacket and two hats.

                                    LUKE
                    Nothing.

                                    PHIL
                    Uh-uh.  Jacket off.  One shirt, one
                    hat.  No pain, no gain.  Jesus, how
                    many pairs of underwear do you have on?

                                    LUKE
                    One.  
                          (then)
                    Six.

25INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS -- DAY

      Claire and Alex are as before.  Claire is looking pretty
      horrified.

                                    ALEX
                    First of all, it would be really cool
                    to see Haley that fat.  And how awesome
                    would it be to have a secret little
                    brother who's really my  nephew.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Alex, Haley is not getting pregnant.

                                    ALEX
                    I'm just saying if.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    23.
                                         

                                      CLAIRE
                          (trying to hide her
                            panic)
                    But there's no point in saying if. 
                    If is what you say when things can
                    happen and this can't happen.  
                          (then)
                    I can't believe I have to prove this
                    to you.

      She rushes out.

26EXT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S BACK YARD - DAY

      Luke is down to one layer of clothes.  Phil has the gun.

                                    PHIL
                    I want you to know, I'm not enjoying
                    this.  But it's an important lesson
                    you're learning.

      He begins to pace off steps away from the nervous Luke.

27INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -DAY -- CONTINUOUS

      Claire walks up the stairs, matching Phil's pace.

28EXT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S BACK YARD - DAY -- CONTINUOUS

      Phil is finishing his paces, then turns.

                                    LUKE
                    You're too close.  It's going to
                    hurt.

                                    PHIL
                    It's supposed to.

                                    LUKE
                    Why are you smiling?

29INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -DAY -- CONTINUOUS

      Claire has reached Haley's closed door.  She's about to burst
      in, when she stops and retreats.

30EXT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S BACK YARD - DAY -- CONTINUOUS

      Phil has the gun trained on Luke, then:

                                    PHIL
                    Oh, forget it.  I can't do this. 
                    The point is you're scared, and I
                    think you've learned your lesson
                    just by --        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    24.
                                         

      BANG!  The gun fires, and Luke yelps.

                                    PHIL (CONT'D)
                    Wow.

      Claire barrels through Haley's door to find:

32INT.  HALEY'S ROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS

      Haley and Dylan are on her bed, watching a movie on her
      laptop.  They both have Starbucks.

                                      HALEY
                          (mortified)
                    Mom!  What are you doing?

                                      CLAIRE
                    What am I doing?  Seeing if you guys
                    need anything, okay?

                                      HALEY
                    You could knock.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Knock?  You knock when you think
                    people are doing something private,
                    which you aren't, obviously, why
                    would you be?  Although I think we
                    all read that study this week saying
                      thirty-nine-percent of sixteen-year-
                    olds have had sexual intercourse. 
                    And as long as we're talking, what
                    is with the coffee all the time? 
                    Huh?  Whatever happened to ice cream? 
                    And all the texting and your cell
                    phones glued to your hands, like
                    you're little business-people. 
                    Doesn't anyone want to run around
                    and ride bikes and be kids anymore?

      They look at her stunned.

                                      CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                    So did you guys need anything?

33EXT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S BACK YARD -- DAY

      Phil is tending to Luke's injury, still holding the gun.

      Haley comes out.

                                      HALEY
                    Dad, you have got to talk to Mom! 
                    She is like completely freaking out
                    and embarrassing me!

                                    PHIL
                    Well honey, your Mom isn't always as
                    cool about things as I am --

      Dylan steps outside, joining Haley, and Phil accidentally
      fires the gun again, hitting him.

                                      DYLAN
                    Owww!

      He falls to the ground.

                                    PHIL
                    What is with this thing?

                                      HALEY

34INTERVIEW -- MITCHELL & CAMERON (THEIR CONDO)

      They sit waiting for Mitchell's family.  Cameron holds Lily.

                                      MITCHELL
                    I've got good reason to be nervous. 
                    I'm having flashbacks to when I told
                    my family I was gay.  My mom cried
                    for a week and my Dad still does
                    this thing where he announces himself
                    before walking into any room we're
                    in to make sure he doesn't see
                    anything.

                                      CAMERON
                    My parents always knew.  My mother
                    says she was in labor with me for
                      twenty-nine hours because I came out
                    of the womb like this:

                    Uggghhhh.  I don't know if I can do
                    this.

                                      CAMERON
                    I'm giving you three minutes and
                    then I'm bringing her out.

      Cameron retreats for Lily's room.  Mitchell opens the door
      to reveal Claire, Phil and the kids.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Hey!

                    Hey guys!

      She hands him a bottle of wine.

                    Oh, thanks.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Don't thank me, just open it.  Dad
                    was parking right behind us.

                    No kissing!  We're here.

      Jay enters with Gloria and Manny.  Jay wears ripped jeans, a
      garish, very colorful jacket and jeweled Ed Hardy hat.  Manny
      wears his white satin shirt.

                                      MITCHELL
                    Don't worry, Dad, nothing gay going
                    on in here.  May I take your multi-
                    colored coat and jeweled cap?

      They all ad-lib greetings.

                          (to Mitchell)
                    So how was your trip?

                                      MITCHELL
                    Oh, it was great.  But about that, I
                    actually have something I need to
                    tell you guys... 

      ANGLE ON CAM

      He's just around the corner, holding Lily, waiting for his
      cue to enter.

                                      MITCHELL (CONT'D)
                    We didn't just go there for
                      pleasure... We kind of have some big
                    news. 

                                    JAY
                    Oh god.  If Cam walks out here with
                    boobs, I'm leaving.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Dad!

                    I hope he didn't embarrass you, Mom.

      She moves off, with attitude.

                                      CLAIRE
                    That's nothing.  She had her first
                    boy over today, I lost it in front
                    of them and then Phil shot him.

                                      MITCHELL
                    So anyway... about a year ago, Cam
                    and I started feeling this longing
                    for something... more.

      Haley has joined Manny.

                                      MANNY
                    Hello, Haley.  You look especially
                    beautiful tonight.

                                      GLORIA

                            outfit)
                    Wow, that's a beautiful skirt, Gloria.

                                      GLORIA
                    Oh, thank you.  It's suede, Pheel.

      He feels her skirt.

                          (hearing "feel")
                    Ooh, it's --

      Claire slaps his hand away.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Phil!  That's how she says "Phil". 

      The lights dim.

                                    JAY
                    What the hell's going on?

      MUSIC CUE: LION KING "CIRCLE OF LIFE"

      Everybody turns.  Cameron enters holding Lily.  In time to
      the music, he dramatically raises her toward the heavens. 
      They all look at one another, mystified.

                                      MITCHELL
                    We adopted a baby.

                    What?!

                                      MITCHELL
                    That's why we went to Vietnam.  Her
                    name is Lily.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    29.

                    She's yours?!

                                      MITCHELL
                    I know.  I can't believe it either.

                                    PHIL
                    Hi, Lily.  
                          (TO MITCHELL & CAM)
                    Isn't that going to be tough for her
                    to say?

                                      HALEY
                    She's so cute.

                    You could totally have one, you know.

      Cameron brings Lily over to Jay.

                                      MITCHELL
                    So... what do you think, grandpa?  

      Everybody turns to see Jay's reaction.

                                    JAY
                    I gotta admit I never thought I'd
                    get a baby out of you two.  
                          (he takes Lily)
                    You're a cute little fortune cookie,
                    aren't ya? 
                          (then)
                    Okay.  That's wet.  Someone take
                    him.

                                      MITCHELL
                    Her, Dad.  I'll change her.

                    Let me help.

35INT. LILY'S ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

      Mitchell and Claire enter and begin changing Lily's diaper.

                                      CLAIRE
                    How could you not say something?  

                                      MITCHELL
                    I don't know.  Maybe I thought you'd
                    try to talk me out of it.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    30.
                                         

                                      CLAIRE
                    I love how you see me as some huge
                    busybody.  
                          (pushes him aside,
                            takes over changing
                          the diaper)
                    I mean, yes, it's a huge
                      responsibility, it's gonna put a lot
                    of pressure on you two that you might
                    not be able to handle.  What did Mom
                    say?

                                      MITCHELL
                    I haven't told her yet, but that was
                    a good sneak preview.

                                      CLAIRE
                          (re: Lily)
                    So what do you know about her parents?

                                      MITCHELL
                    Not much.  I just know her mother
                    was sixteen.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Oh, God.  Well, she's gorgeous.

                                      MITCHELL
                    Thanks.  I just hope... 

                                      CLAIRE
                    What?

                                      MITCHELL
                    I already love her so much and...
                    it's hard enough for any kid, let
                    alone one with two dads.  What if,
                    when she gets older, she's ashamed
                    of us?   

      She hugs him.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Oh honey, don't be ridiculous.  You're
                    her parents.  Of course she'll be
                    ashamed of you.
                          (then)
                    My kids are mortified by me.  Which
                    is pretty ironic considering Haley
                    dresses like a hooker,  Alex dresses
                    like a lesbian and...
