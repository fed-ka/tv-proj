A sparrow flutters in birdseed on a window sill. More birds
crowd a bird feeder that hangs above.
A lone child swings lazily on a swing. Other children tear
about in a wild game of chase.
Walter and some other men drop the side of the flatbed truck
and trees crash to the ground.

The bus pulls away, revealing Walter standing alone on the
sidewalk of a dilapidated neighborhood. He holds his duffle
bag.
A superintendent opens the door to an apartment, then hands
Walter the keys. Her gaze is cold.
Walter closes the door and turns around. He stands in the
middle of a prefab/pre-furnished kitchen, living room area.
Light works its way through the dilapidated blinds.
Tires SCREECH as cars tear out of the driveway. Walter stands
at a bus stop across the street.
As Vicki walks across the lot, a car pulls up next to her and
men catcall and whistle out the window.
Vicki flicks them off. The men burst into hysterics and peal
out of the lot. She gets in her Jeep and leaves, tearing by
the bus stop.
Walter looks after her then turns his collar up against the
chill. It is late winter. The trees are bare -- black
silhouettes against the darkening sky.
Walter turns towards the shelter for protection from the
wind. Filling the kiosk, a clothing advertisement displays a
young girl striking a seductive pose.
Walter exits the police station and crosses the street.
The sidewalk is crowded with pedestrians. Walter heads
towards the pharmacy entrance, but he is abruptly cut off by
a group of kids zooming by on their scooters and skateboards.
He pauses for them to pass, watches after them momentarily,
then proceeds inside.

WALTER (cont'd)
How about that!?
Slowly the SOUND of children fades in and a red ball bounces
to Walter's feet. He looks in the direction the ball came
from.
Nothing is there.
Walter looks back down at his feet. The ball is gone. The
sound of children fades back away and is replaced by a
rhythmic squeak. Walter looks towards the playground where an
empty swing sways back and forth in the wind, the chain
squeaking in its hinges.

the hawk being chased by two smaller birds.
Walter crosses the street outside of his apartment and heads

As they pull away, a beat up grey Chevy pulls into the
parking lot. Sergeant Lucas gets out of the car, and pauses
watching after Vicki and Walter. He then turns and heads into
the office.
Continued from previous journal scene. Walter sits at his
windowsill writing in his journal. There is the sound of
children arriving to school outside. He looks up.
WALTER
But for the last few weeks I've
noticed someone else watching them.
Walter's POV: The man with the white Volvo stands leaning
against his car watching a bus load of children arrive. He
pops M&Ms; in his mouth.

The boys run and tackle each other. A group walks by Candy.

pretty ones, faces like angels.
Walter finishes writing then looks outside.
Walter exits the building amidst a group of men. He walks

He turns his back to the cold wind and her.
Vicki turns on the car and pulls out of the lot, roaring by
Walter without looking at him.
Walter and Vicki get out of the car which is parked on the
edge of a reservoir surrounded by a thick pine forest. Vicki
works her way down to the water's edge. A Great Blue Heron
skims across the water's surface.

No. Prison is time. That's it. You

Walter stumbles back a few steps but regains himself. He
stares at Vicki. His anger wells and he snaps.
WALTER
I had this plan once... or maybe it
was a dream. I was going to quit
the building business... open my
own shop. Make and design fine
country furniture. I had saved
enough money. I found the perfect
place. Cheap five-year-lease. The
loan was in the bag. My wife was a

Walter stands alone at his bus stop. As he waits, he sees the
white Volvo turn a corner and pull up in front of the school.
he bus pulls up to the stop, obscuring Walter's view. He
