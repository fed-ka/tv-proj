      BILL enters and passes her without acknowledgement.

      Bill doesn t answer him. He puts the last of the guns in the 
      airing cupboard and passes. Silent treatment. This is 
      absolute hell for Rick. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      AMY is sitting up in her bed. She s just put on her bra. 

      Rustling sounds are heard off camera. 

      Amy looks over at:

      The back of a MYSTERY MAN (face unseen), sitting on the edge 
      of the bed, putting on his shirt. 

      The Mystery Man stops. Puts a hand to his head. He s hung 
      over.  Amy clocks this. 

                                  AMY
                    Got some aspirin if you want? 

      ANGLE ON: The Mystery Man. It s PHILIP. Last night Amy and 
      Philip slept together. 

                                    PHILIP
                    I, uh, better get back, morning 
                      council meeting. 

      Amy nods. It s obvious that she considers this a one time 
      deal. A consolation prize. The person she really would have 
      liked to spend the night with (Kieren) spent it somewhere 
      else.  Philip stands. Turns back.

                    can t get out. 

      Amy looks at him -  Believe me you were nothing to shout 
      about.  

                                    PHILIP (CONT D)
                            (shaking head, fifty

                      What s that supposed to mean? 

      Amy gives him a look. Philip takes offence. 

                                    PHILIP (CONT D)
                    Good. Keep your mouth shut. People 
                    round here found out I slept with a 
                      rotterI d be strung up. 

      Philip exits. 

      Amy hits the covers. She s pissedoff at being treated like a 
      dirty shameful secret by someone like Philip. Screw the 
      living. She goes for her laptop on the floor. Opens it. The 
      illicit web site Kieren looked at in Ep1pops up (Amy s 
      obviously been on it a lot.)

                                                                            CUT TO:



      The automatic doors open and KIEREN steps inside. 

        Muzakplays. 

      It s a surprisingly big shop. Four aisles and at the left 
      hand side a bank of cash registers, where two SHOP ASSISTANTS 
      scan bar codes.  

      ROARTON SHOPPERS trundle around with their trolleys / 
      baskets. 

      Kieren gets a number of suspicious looks (remember he isn t 
      wearing cover up and one of his contacts is out). 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 3 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 8.

      Kieren ignores the shoppers scared / disapproving 
        rubbernecking and approaches AISLE 4.

      AISLE 4

      Empty of shoppers. Crisps and chocolates on the shelves. 

      Kieren stands at the far end. He is staring at a spot on the 
      floor down the aisle. 

      It s where he attacked Lisa. Kieren stares at the spot. 
      Haunted. He begins to move towards the spot. 

      The muzakstarts to become DISTORTED. The fluorescentsbegin 
      to FLICKER. 

      The stress is causing Kieren to go into flashback. An intense 
      one. 

      The whole picture starts to shake. The fluorescentsGROW 
      BRIGHTER. The muzakSCREECHES AND MORPHS INTO:

      SCREAMING.

      There, on the spot on the floor where Kieren was just staring 
      is RABID KIEREN and RABID AMY DYER feeding on LISA LANCASTER. 

      AUTOMATIC DOORS BUZZ OPEN.  

      A MALE RABID ZOMBIE hanging about in the entrance turns his 
      head and:

      Gets A BULLET in his HEAD.   

      ANGLE ON: JEM. Combat mode, pistol smoking. 

                                  JEM
                    LISA!

      From around the corner ANOTHER RABID ZOMBIE lurches into 
      view. 

      Jem fires her pistol from range. Head shot. Zombie goes down. 

      We follow behind Jem as she begins searching aisles: 

      No Lisa in Aisle 1. No Lisa in Aisle 2 Or Aisle 3. 

      AISLE 4Jem hears MUNCHING SOUNDS.

      This is the aisle. Jem checks her chamber. She s got plenty 
      of bullets. Enough to blow any zombies that are hurting her 
      partner.  Jem goes into Aisle 4. She sees:

      RABID KIEREN, her brother, feeding on Lisa, her friend and 
      partner. 

      Rabid Kieren lifts his head and sees:

      Jem. Standing at the far end of the aisle. Holding her  
      pistol at him. 

      Jem is in utter shock. Doesn t make a move. Just stares at 
      him.   

      Rabid Kieren doesn t make a move either. Just stares at his 
      sister. 

      His sister....

      The fluorescentsflicker. 

      As brother and sister look at each other the fluorescent 
      lights flicker on off on off on off on off...

      KIEREN creeps past the lounge where SUE and STEVE lie asleep 
      on the couch.

      JEM sleeping in bed. Bad dream. Her eyes snap open. 

      She sees a figure standing in her room. 

      Jem reaches under her pillow for her pistol. Grasps hold of 
      it and points it at the figure.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 3 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 10.

                    You were there. 

      Jem doesn t say anything. Just aims her pistol. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      BILL is pacing, plotting how to get Kieren. While he tells a 
      worried RICK his plan, he searches for his cigarettes.

                    when you ve finished him, say 
                      something like;  When I met up with 
                    the Walker Lad he started foaming 
                    at the mouth.  Summit like that.        

      Bill looks at Rick. Sense his son s unease.

                    He s not a person, Rick. He s an 
                      animal. Worse then an animal. They 
                    might walk and talk but rottersare 
                    evil. 

      Rick nods, his Dad is describing him - could his self-esteem 
      be any lower? 

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                    This has to be done.

                    the bad books? 

      Rick looks up at Bill. That was the worst threat made by his 
      Dad when he was growing up. The times Rick was in his 
      father s  bad books  was excruciating.

      Janet looks at her son. The desperation behind the eyes. She

      Janet nods and goes into her purse. This is done in a 
        clandestine fashion. While she counts out coins she keeps 
      looking to check Bill isn t coming in. 

      Rick understands what she s doing. He checks Bill isn t

                    liar.

      Jem tries to hold back the emotion. But it s too hard.

                      I told Lisa s parents, I told 
                      everyone, that I d run out of 
                      bullets. I hadn t run out of 
                      bullets. I just couldn t pull the 
                      trigger on me own brother. Rabid 
                      Rotteror not. I just couldn t do 
                    that. 

      Brother and sister look at each other. Both are racked with 
      guilt. This is the first time either one has been able to 
      admit what they did out loud. Two peas in a guilty pod.

      Sue mentions for Steve to pick up the phone. 

      Jem brings in a cereal bar box from the kitchen. Pockets one. 
      Offers Kieren one. Course he doesn t eat, but it s a nice 
      gesture so he takes it and pockets it.

      Rick puts down the receiver. Was that enough? What if Kieren

      wrist watch beeps. It s been half an hour. He s already taken 
      up all the time he can without it looking suspicious. 

      Rick resigns himself. Puts down the phone and exits the

      Gary LUNGES for Amy. GRABS her by the HAIR. Amy tries to 
      defend herself, but Gary s too strong. He very roughly DRAGS 
      her to her vintage VANITY TABLE where her FLESHTONEMAKE UP 
      is.  

      Gary grabs the make up and starts SMEARING it all over Amy s 
      face. Amy tries to turn her head away. Gary won t let her.

      Gary finishes smearing Amy. He roughly lets go / pushes her. 
      She falls to the floor.  

      Amy won t allow him to win - she looks at him defiantly.

      throw anything away because it might be jarring if someone 
      came back. The whole place is frozen in time.

      KIEREN and JEM uncomfortably stand next to a smiling PATTY. 
      DUNCAN enters with a full FOLDER filled with various MISSING 
      POSTERS, he opens the folder and gets out the newest ones, 
      shows them to Kieren and Jem as you would show your stamp 
      collection to guests (this is Duncan s main macabre hobby now 
        - searching for his daughter).

                                    DUNCAN
                      That s the new one. 

      Kieren and Jem nod politely.

                      Hopefully we won t need to put  em 
                    up for much longer... 

      Expectant Patty and Duncan look at Kieren and Jem. Kieren 
      breathes in. Okay it s time...

      Duncan grasps Patty s hand. He s seen her!

                      Because I was there. In the 
                      supermarket.   

      Duncan and Patty look quizzical.

                      I attacked her, Mrs. Lancaster, Mr.

                    So you were the one who moved her 
                    body?

      Kieren s a little caught off guard by this question. 

                                    KIEREN
                    No. No I don t think I did.

                      I...I... don tknow. It could have 
                    been me. Could have been the person

                    But yersure you bit her? 

      Kieren s knocked back by this question. He looks at Duncan 
      and Patty - who are waiting for an answer.

                                    KIEREN
                    Yes. I m sure I did that.  

      Bizarrely Duncan and Patty seemed relieved by this answer.

                    To be honest, we were hoping for a 
                    bit more from you.

      Kieren opens his mouth but doesn t know what to say. He s a 
      bit bowled over by their reactions.

      VICAR ODDIE is giving a barnstorming sermon to the 
        CONGREGATION. 

      BILL sits with JANET and an uncomfortable looking RICK. 

      Other parishioners are keeping their distance and looking at 
      Rick from the corner of their eyes. It s subtle but it s 
      clear Rick is not welcome here.

                     And I looked, and behold a pale 
                      horseman: and his name was Death, 
                    and Hell followed with him.  The 
                    first resurrection of the dead is 
                    the beginning of the Great 
                      Tribulations. Once the first risen 
                    dead have been judged, only then 
                    can the good Lord pave the way to 
                      salvation. And salvation is all we 
                      crave.

       Amen s  from various parishioners including Bill. Janet and 
      Rick kept quiet.

                    Have to go to this coffee morning 
                      Shirl set up.

      Bill nods, and seeing VICAR ODDIE he approaches him, shaking 
      his hand.

                                    BILL
                      Appreciate that, Vicar.

      As BILL turns to leave, VICAR ODDIE tightens his grip and 
      leans in to BILL.

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                    Bill, this is far from over. 

      BILL gives VICAR ODDIE a quizzical look.

                                    VICAR ODDIE (CONT D)
                      1 Corinthians 15:52  For the 
                      trumpet shall sound, and the dead 
                    shall be raised incorruptible.  A 
                      second Rising is coming, Bill. When 
                    the first risen have been judged, a 
                      second resurrection will be upon 
                    us. But this time the good lord 
                    will bring back the righteous and 
                    the proper, the true souls we miss 
                    so dearly. 

      Bill s eyes are wide. Vicar Oddie loosens his grip on BILL s 
      hand.

      BILL turns and leads Rick quickly out the church. 

                                                                            CUT TO:IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 3 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 34.






        Roartonwomen including SUE, JANET, MRS BENNETT and the PLUMP 
      OLD DEAR are gathered in a back room. Despite the sign 
       WOMEN S COFFEE MORNING  this doesn t feel like your typical 
      coffee morning get together.  For one thing all the mums hold 
        UNDERSTANDING PDSbooklets.

      SHIRLEY is putting out the final fold out chairs. 

      SUE and JANET are by the tea urn.

                    How s Kieren, Sue? Is he settling 
                    back alright? 

                                  SUE

                    Glad to hear it.

      SHIRLEY claps her hands for attention.

                                    SHIRLEY
                    Okay ladies, if you d like to take

      Sue and Janet, suppressing smiles, look at each other:  Yeah 
      right, Lord knows where they got Henry s full address from 
      (probably Henry himself!) 

      Mrs Bennett gets out one of the offending letters.

                                  MRS BENNETT (CONT D)
                    Some of the letters he gets are

                      Barbara is very misinformed.
                            (indicating booklet)

                    Well next time post comes I d

                    the next I m filled with anger. 
                    Then a minute later I m in the 
                      bathroom bawling me eyes out. 
                      Honestly I can t keep up. 

                                    SHIRLEY
                      A very common reaction, isn t it 
                      ladies? You mentioned being angry 
                    with him, love?

                                  SUE
                    When Kieren left, my family... My 
                      family went into free fall. Jemima
                      became a white hot ball of rage I 
                      couldn t reason with and Steve - 
                      there s that joke about the best 
                      husband being a mute husband - but 
                    the reality of watching someone 
                      you ve known and loved for so long 
                    just shutting down in front of you 
                    is... is awful. And at its worst 
                    point with both of them I blamed 
                      Kieren. I was so bloody mad with 
                    him. It s horrible to feel that way 
                    about someone, especially your only 
                    son. 

                                    JANET
                    I ve felt exactly the same way,

                    Rick came back I were scared of

                      different looking.  But he s still 
                    the same. Deep down. I know that.

      Bill hands Rick the knife. 

      Bill  acts  like Kieren. Walks towards Rick. Bill (as Kieren) 
      comes in for a handshake.

      Rick takes Bill s hand and in a fluid movement he twists 
      Bill s arm behind his back, forcing Bill s back and neck to 
      become exposed, then Rick pretends stabs the knife into the 
      back of Bill s neck.

      Rick basks in his father s pride for a brief moment. Bill 
      turns away. Rick looks devastated that his dad wants him to 
      kill his best friend. 

      Bill puts his jacket on.

      SOUND OF: A tap running water. 

      ANGLE ON: The toilet. The lid isn t even up. 

      PAN OVER TO:

      RICK, who stands by the sink, in his coat, looking at himself 
      in the mirror. It s now or never. If he doesn t take a stand 
      he s going to have to kill Kieren. He can t allow that. But 
      standing up to his father is the most frightening thing Rick 
      has ever considered doing. Forget all the patrol missions in 
        Afghanistan. That was a cake walk compared to going against 
      his father s wishes.  But it must be done.  

      Rick looks hard at his reflection -  Just do it, solider, be 
      brave. Like Kieren was last night. Be brave.   

      Rick takes a WASH CLOTH. Soaks it in the tap water. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      We follow behind RICK (face unseen) as he enters the living 
      room where BILL is waiting, coat on.

                    Dad. 

      Bill looks up. Freezes. 

      ANGLE ON: Rick. Without flesh toned cover up. Without 
      contacts in. Pale skin. Eyes pin pricks. If Bill was in 
      denial about his son s condition (he was) then he cannot 
      escape it now. Here is Rick, his partially deceased son, in 
      the flesh. 

                                    RICK (CONT D)
                      I don t want to hurt Ren. 

      Bill doesn t say anything. He s in shock. The shock of the 
      self deception crumbling and the realization Rick is undead. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 3 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 47.

                    I do. Yertrapped. Aren t yer?

      Rick nods. Tears well up in his eyes. It s such a weight off 
      his shoulders to finally admit to his Dad that he s felt, 
      always felt,  trapped by his father s judgement. 

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                      Yerknow something s not right and

      Rick nods again. He s too emotional to hear that last 
      question from Bill had an odd tone to it. 

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                    Come here. 

      Rick goes to his Dad. 

      Bill embraces him. Rick breaks down. 

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                      Shhhh. It s alright. It s gonnabe 
                      alright.

      JEM stares at the photographs on her wall - they are of her 
      at the gibbit, a zombie strung up, she is below it posing as 
      the rough tough lieutenant of the Human Volunteer Force. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      JEM takes down the photographs.

      JEM opens a bottom drawer. Places her HVFblue armband 
      carefully in the draw and closes it. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      FROM INSIDE CLOSET: JEM opens the door. She takes off her 
      Army surplus jacket and hangs it up. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      THIS SCENE HAS NOW MOVED TO 57A4040



      BILL picks up a STORAGE BOX. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      ON: The opened storage box. The box contains all the 
        memorabilia of Rick before he died, that was on display in 
      the Macyhousehold before he came back. A framed photograph 
      of Rick in his Military dress (NB: the photograph we saw in 
      Ep1) is taken out. 

      BILL is carefully placing the old framed photographs of Rick 
      back on display. Just like before. 

      BILL is putting the NHSleaflets, Rick s contacts and cover 
      up mousse, Rick s medals, in a black bin bag. 

                                                                            CUT TO:IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 3 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 51.






      BILL, back wearing his Army surplus jacket and blue armband 
      is sat down, lager in hand, watching the footie. Eerily 
      still. 

      Sound of front door. 

                                    JANET
                    Hiya. Sorry I m late, love.   

      Bill doesn t answer her. 

      Janet comes with a box of Sunday school stuff. 

                                    JANET (CONT D)
                      Shirl was natteringon bout the 
                      village fete. By heavens, that 
                    woman can... 

      Janet trails off. She s noticed the unpacked photos of Rick 
      on the mantlepieceand that the place has been cleared of any 
      trace of Rick in his other state. 

                                    JANET (CONT D)
                      Where s Rick? 

      A slight twitch from Bill. 

                                    JANET (CONT D)
                            (starting to really worry)
                    Bill, where s Rick?

      Bill turns his head. We see clearly the disturbing glint in 
      his eyes. 

                                    BILL
                    Rick? 
                          (beat)
                      I haven t seen Rick in five years.

                    When we waved him off at Manchester 
                      airport. That s the last time I saw 
                    our son. 

      Bill turns back to the TV. Takes a slow swig of his drink. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      The man that God needs to help - BILL MACY - is sitting as if 
      the good lord has given him peace. 

      JANET  is  on  the  sofa  next to him. In shock. Rigid. 
        Traumatised. 

      A POUNDING at the front door. Bill focuses on the game.

      Janet looks at Bill. 

      Again - BANG BANGBANG. 

      Janet still looking at Bill, waiting for permission to move a 
      muscle. 

      Again - BANG BANGBANGBANGBANG

      Finally:

                                    BILL
                    What idiot s making that racket? 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      JANET opens the door to:

      KIEREN, rage still humming away inside of him, waits on the 
      doorstep. He clutches the knife tight in his hand. 

                                    JANET
                      Kieren. You don t want to -

      Kieren doesn t let her finish her sentence. 

      He BARGES into the house. 

                                                                            CUT TO:IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 3 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 54.






      BILL still watching the game. Calm as a Hindu cow. 

      Kieren enters. Stands over Bill. His hand holding the knife 
      trembles with anger. 

                                    KIEREN
                    Stand up. 

      Bill doesn t break staring at the TV. 

                                    KIEREN (CONT D)
                    Stand up!

      Bill, barely acknowledging Kieren s presence. 

                                    BILL
                      Yerbanned from this house. 

      Kieren s expression of pure hate falters somewhat. What a 
      strange thing to say. But he figures it s Bill messing with 
      him so to show he means business he PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO 
      THE SOFA S ARM REST.  

      Bill looks at the knife with glassy spaced out eyes. 

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                    And that s why. Bloody animal. You 
                       eardme; yernot allowed in this 
                      house.

                    You banned me eight years ago. And 
                    it wasn t for wrecking your 
                      furniture, it was for giving your 
                    son A MIX CD.

                                    BILL
                    Aye, and when he comes back; you ll 
                    still be barred from  ere,  so trot 
                    on.  

      Kieren looks at Bill - There s something very odd in his tone 
      and manner. 

                                    KIEREN
                    What do you mean when he comes 
                    back?

                                    BILL
                    Next time.

                      Janet, get us another would yer? 

      Frightened Janet goes to get another lager for Bill. Kieren 
      gently stops her. 

                                    KIEREN
                    What next time, Bill?

                    He looked like him. He talked like 
                    him. But there were tell tale 
                      signs. I see now. Sticking up for 
                    likes a  you. That were when the

      A spine chilling SCREAM. 

      From Janet. Kieren s words have made it all so real. 

      Bill stands up, crosses to Janet and holds her. Rocks his 
        stiff-as-a-board wife as he directs his attention towards 
      Kieren.

                    You killed Rick. 

      Kieren turns away. He can t watch this.  

      He frowns: The RED HUNTING KNIFE isn t sticking out of the 
      arm rest. 

      Kieren realizes something, snaps his head back to Bill and 
      Janet as... 

      ...Janet takes the knife she took from the arm rest and 
      ATTACKS BILL WILDLY. 

      Bill puts up his hands to defend himself. Janet slashes at 
      them. 

      Bill stumbles back in pain. SLASHED BLOODY HANDS. 

      Janet goes for Bill again but Kieren gets to her. Holds her 
      back. They both lose their balance and tumble to the floor.  

      Bill is in shock. He looks at his bloody hands. Blood on his 
      hands. Seeing the blood jolts him out of his psychotic 
      episode. 

      Janet claws towards Bill. Kieren holds her at bay.

      Bill, dazed, doesn t understand.... 

      Then it hits him. What he s actually done. 

      Bill urgently gets to his feet.

      Kieren and Janet react to the sound of the gun shot.

      A FIGURE with a lamp light lit enters the inner sanctum of 
      the cave. 

      As he comes towards us we make out it s Kieren. 

      Kieren looks at:

      THE OLD DEN. Him and Rick s special place. We spot graffiti 
      on the rocks. One carving stands out from the rock band 
      motifs and song lyrics:  Ren+ Rick Forever  

      Kieren gets up onto the rusted CAT WALK. Sets himself down. 
      Get the feeling this is where him and Rick sat and had heart 
      to hearts. 

      On Kieren for a few moments. Reflecting on all that has 
      occurred. 

      A noise comes from the entrance. 

      Kieren looks entrance. 

      All he can see is a keyhole of light and then utter darkness. 

      More noise - sounds like a person, coming closer. 

      Kieren stands. 

      A FIGURE is silhouetted on the cave wall. 

      Kieren s scared now.

      A figure emerges into the dim 

      Kieren s partially deceased heart misses a couple of thuds. 

      It s not Lisa, come to punish him, it s his mother SUE.

      This effects Kieren deeply. He spots the  Ren+ Rick 4 
      Forever  on the rock face. He winces. Sue spots this. 

                                  SUE (CONT D)
                      I know how it feels. To lose 
                      someone. Same thing happened when I 
                    was eighteen - well not exactly the 
                    same thing - but close. I was going 
                    out with this very handsome RAF
                      pilot.

      Kieren s surprised to hear this. 

                                  SUE (CONT D)
                      I know. It s true. I never told 
                    you. I was so amazed by this man. 
                    In awe of him really. I had it in 
                    my head that we were going to get 
                      married, have kids, the whole 
                      shebang. Trouble was he had other 
                      plans. Namely dumping me and going 
                    out with my best friend Emily who 
                    he deemed more socially acceptable. 
                    I was devastated. Inconsolable. I 
                      thought that was it. The end. I d 
                    never find any one who got me so 
                      completely again. I quit college 
                    and came home. One night, I decided 
                    I was going to end it all. I 
                      sneaked out the house and went to 
                    the late night chemist. The fella
                    on the counter point blank refused 
                    to serve me. So I burst into tears 
                    right there in the shop. He was so 
                    kind this fella, even though he 
                      wouldn t serve me, he took me in 
                    the back, made me a tea and 
                      listened. And I talked. All through 
                    his shift and then some more when 
                    he walked me home. I talked and he 
                      listened and he didn t yawn or look 
                    at his watch or anything, he just 
                    was there for me. And he made me 
                    laugh too.
