      CHYRON:  MAXIMUM STATE PRISON, HUNTSVILLE, TEXAS


      The GUARD (PETE) hops into an old Bronco, drives off, passing 
      through a gate and guard shack.  Waves are exchanged.


      An apartment building in downtown Atlanta.

      CHYRON:  ATLANTA, GEORGIA


      Detectives escort Sarah down the steps of the hospital.  
      Several REPORTERS have gathered.  A small mob surround them 
      as they make their way to the--  


      INMATES hang in the yard as GUARDS patrol from towers.  A 
      helicopter flies over. 


      The helicopter lands on the rooftop.  Ryan Hardy emerges from 
      it.  PRISON GUARDS escort him to FBI AGENT JENNIFER MASON, 
      30 s, attractive, all business.    

                                  MASON
                    Ryan Hardy, I m Special Agent 
                    Jennifer Mason, BAU-2, this way.

      PRISON GUARDS lead them through a door and down metal stairs.   
      Agent Mason moves with purpose, fast and focused.  

                                  MASON (CONT D)
                    I m not sure what Franklin told 
                    you.  But I m running point for the 
                    Bureau and the Marshals are heading 
                    the ground search. 

                                  RYAN
                    And the Texas Rangers? 

                                  MASON
                    They re in charge.  You can t miss 
                     em.  They wear really big hats.  

      This woman has some bite.  The elevator doors close.  


      Big yards.  Big homes.  A nice place to live.  Except for the 
      NEWS VANS, PATROL CARS and MEDIA CIRCUS that surrounds one 
      particular house.

        SUPERIMPOSE:  MATTHEWS  RESIDENCE, HOUSTON, TEXAS


      A modest duplex in a residential area.  REPORTERS, NEWS VANS, 
      SPECTATORS crowd the side-walk and entrance.  

      CHYRON: SARAH FULLER S RESIDENCE, CORPUS CHRISTI, TEXAS

      A young man, pushes through the crowd.  WILL WILSON, 20 s, 
      handsome.  He s bewildered at the commotion.


      An out-of-business Wal-Mart has been converted into a 
      temporary command center.  Crowded chaos.

      SIRENS BLARE as POLICE VEHICLES races down the street.  


      CHYRON: JORDY RAINES  RESIDENCE, HUNTSVILLE, TX

      A lower-income neighborhood.  SPECIAL AGENTS disembark from a 
      van.  Rifles in tow.  They fan out...


      Small.  Run-down.  Captain Turner is with TWO VESTED AGENTS. 
      He KNOCKS on the front door.  No answer.   One, two... 

      The HOUSE IS SEIZED.  Windows SHATTER.  Doors are BASHED in.   


      Mason and Ryan disembark from an SUV.  They start for the 
      house, ducking under police tape, entering the front door. 


      A big and traditional sorority house. 


      The MEDIA circus is still camped in front of Claire Matthews  
      home.  A BLACK SUV drives up.  Mason and Ryan get out. 


      Claire and Ryan walk along the campus to a parking lot.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I didn t know about the eyes.

                                  RYAN
                    It was withheld.

      Claire takes a moment.  Thinks about it.  Ryan finds himself 
      staring.  Intrigued by her.  

                                  CLAIRE
                    Try Edgar Allan Poe.  THE TELL-TALE 
                    HEART, THE BLACK CAT.  Both have a 
                    strong eye allegory.  The eyes are 
                    symbolic.  The essence of identity. 

      Ryan gives this thought as they reach Claire s car.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    You should talk to my husband.  He 
                    knows that period really well. 

                                  RYAN
                    You re married?

      Claire looks at him.  He was flirting.  

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yes, I m married, Agent Hardy.  
                    Why?  Were you flirting?                                                                                     34.


      She makes a joke -- it completely diffuses their tension. 

                                  RYAN
                    With this material?  Not a chance.

      They both smile.  He was clearly interested.  

      END FLASHBACK:


      Ryan flies out of the house with Mason.  They move to the 
      SUV.  She s still livid. 

                                  MASON
                    What was that about in there?

                                  RYAN
                    It was personal.

                                  MASON
                    What do you mean?  Personal?  Are 
                    you sleeping with Claire Matthews?  

      Ryan gets into the waiting SUV, ignoring Mason. 


      An AERIAL SHOT of Sarah s neighborhood.  Flashing lights.  
      SQUAD CARS and MEDIA are camped outside her duplex.                                                                                      39.


        A HELICOPTER LANDS in an empty parking lot.  Ryan and Mason 
      emerge -- they re met by Riley and Weston who usher them to a 
      waiting vehicle. 


      The entire neighborhood is lit up with SQUAD CARS, 
      AMBULANCES, MOBILE UNIT, MEDIA TRUCKS... a full blown circus.  


      Ryan exits the duplex.  He paces the driveway, trying to cool 
      down.  He ends up at the fence.  Kicks at it, unleashing.   
      Beat.  As he stands silently under a lamp post--  

      FLASHBACK:


      A street lamp shines down on Ryan.  Fraternity and sorority 
      houses line the street.  He scans the yards, left to right.  
      He s looking for someone.  He moves up the street and into a 
      driveway, RUNNING SMACK into-- 

      SARAH with her friend, ANNIE.  Both girls jump, startled.  

                                  RYAN
                    Sorry, girls. 

      Annie gets defensive.  She s drunk and feisty.   

                                  ANNIE
                    Back off, dude.  C mon, Sarah.                                                                                    45.


      Annie leads Sarah away.  

                                  SARAH
                    You don t have to be rude.
                          (looks back to Ryan)
                    Sorry, sir.

      Ryan smiles at Sarah.  No worries.  He stares at Sarah.  Her 
      face has triggered something.  He recognizes her.  He watches 
      as they make their way to the porch of the PHI DELTA HOUSE.  

                                  ANNIE
                    There s a killer on the loose and 
                    you want me to have manners.  
                          (on the porch)
                    That was creepy.  

                                  SARAH
                    This whole night was creepy.

      Ryan watches as they enter the dark house.  Beat.  

      BACK TO RYAN -- PRESENT DAY -- His face pained.

      SCENE INTERCUTS from PAST to PRESENT.  Images FLASH fast and 
      furious.  As Ryan is haunted with the memories of that night 
      long ago:  

      -- Ryan stares at the Phi Delta house.  He walks along the 
      driveway, searching for signs of intrusion. 

      -- At a side glass door, Ryan peers in.  Suddenly, SCREAMING.  
      He SHATTERS the door with his arm.  Enters.  From upstairs, 
      more SCREAMING.  Ryan DRAWS HIS GUN.  Races up the stairs.  

      -- Ryan enters Sarah s bedroom.  Sees Sarah on the floor.  A 
      bloody mess.  Knife protruded from her.  She grips it.  He 
      kneels beside.  She s barely alive, she utters...

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    Behind you...

      -- Ryan turns as Carroll ATTACKS.  They go to the floor.  Joe 
      Carroll rises first, attempting to get away.  Carroll reaches 
      out for Sarah as... 

      -- Ryan ATTACKS.  Carroll surprises him with the knife.  It 
      strikes Ryan in the back.  He drops to his knees in pain.  
      Carroll withdraws the knife.  Ryan falls over. 

      -- Carroll goes back to Sarah.  He raises the knife.  Ready 
      to finish her off.  When--                                                                                    46.


      -- A GUNSHOT sends Carroll flying to the floor.  His body 
      writhing.  On Ryan, still on the floor.  Gun in his hands. 

      END FLASHBACK:


      Mason finds Ryan in the alley, leaning against the fence.  He 
      stares at the CROWD that has formed behind the barricade.  
      He s raw.  Vulnerable.  He doesn t look at her.  

                                  MASON
                    Manson, Jim Jones, David Koresh. 
                    They were leaders.  They knew how 
                    to connect to people.  Inspire 
                    them.  But they didn t have 
                    internet access--
                          (beat)
                    If this is a cult...

      Mason looks at the ONLOOKERS behind the barricades.  At the 
      DIFFERENT FACES in the CROWD.  

                                  MASON (CONT D)
                    They could be anywhere.  
                          (a long silence)
                    I know Sarah Fuller is personal.  
                    She would have to be...  
                          (beat)
                    She could still be alive. 

      And with that she turns and walks away.  Off Ryan--    


      Behind the barricades, a LARGE MOBILE UNIT sits.  A pop out 
      tent extends from it, shielding it from the public.  The 
      Rangers run a mobile command center from it.  

      Mason surfaces from the driveway.  Riley YELLS at her.  

                                  RILEY
                    Our non-gay gay couple s real names 
                    are Paul Hoffman and Jacob Wells.  
                    Get this, Wells is from -- Laredo.

                                  MASON
                    Where Jordy used the ATM.

                                    CAPTAIN TURNER
                    I ve got men on the ground there.  
                    We have an address.  Let s go. 

      Turner rallies his men.  They take off.                                                                                      47.


                                  MASON
                    We re right behind you.

                                  RYAN
                    It s too easy.  We re being played.  
                    It s a distraction.

      Mason turns to see Ryan approaching.  Calm now.  Solemn.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    We re missing it.  He s telling us 
                    where he is -- we re missing it. 

                                  MASON
                    The evidence is telling us Laredo.  
                    Let s start there. 

      And with that Mason takes off, preparing to leave. 


      Official vehicles are lined up.  With no one looking, Ryan 
      slips into a vehicle and takes off.   


      The moon illuminates the choppy waters of the Gulf. 


      Ryan s SUV moves down a long, winding road.  He comes to a 
      STOPLIGHT in the beach town of Port Aransas.  


      Ryan s HEADLIGHTS appear in the distance.  As they approach, 
      the HEADLIGHTS shut off -- Ryan gets out, races down the road 
      to a gated piece of property.  An empty parking lot that 
      leads to an abandoned restaurant that overlooks the water. 

      The front of it has a faux LIGHTHOUSE at its entrance.  This 
      is the same LIGHTHOUSE that was in the PHOTO.  Closed for 
      years now -- it s rundown and deserted. 

      Except the padlock on the chained gate is shiny new.  Ryan 
      sees this and quickly falls back into the shadows.  He leaves 
      the road and races off into the dunes toward the surf...


      Ryan races along the edge of the water.  He comes up under 
      the pier.  Wooden pilings and planks -- he eyes a small 
      staircase on the far side.  He makes his way up to--


      Ryan darts down the old and empty pier, coming upon the back 
      of the restaurant.  An outdoor patio that s seen better days.  
      Many of the glass doors are broken, allowing easy entrance.


      POLICE LIGHTS, HELICOPTERS, SQUAD CARS -- the old restaurant 
      is now a crime scene.  Carroll is shackled and placed into a 
      STEEL POLICE VAN.   

      A CORONER S VEHICLE takes Sarah Fuller s body away.  Captain 
      Turner oversees the proceedings.


      Waves CRASH against the pier.  Ryan sits on a bench near the 
      end.  The night air whipping all around.  Mason appears.  

                                  MASON
                    Carroll s en route to Huntsville.  

      Ryan stares into the black night.  His face dried with blood.  

                                  MASON (CONT D)
                    No news on our prison guard and the 
                    not so gay neighbors.  
                          (no response)
                    You should have the medic take care 
                    of your face.

                                  RYAN
                    How did you find me?

                                  MASON
                    This thing called GPS.  You went 
                    rogue in a government vehicle.  
                    Here.  Have some water.  

      Mason hands him a bottle of ARROWHEAD WATER.  

                                  MASON (CONT D)
                    From your private stock.  I went 
                    through your bag.  I know.  Tacky.  

      Ryan doesn t take it.  Mason sits beside him.  She opens it 
      and takes a drink.  It s been a long night.

                                  MASON (CONT D)
                    Why a lighthouse?   

                                  RYAN
                    Carroll s book was inspired by 
                    Poe s last unfinished work,  The 
                      Lighthouse.                                                                                     52.


                                  MASON
                    Sarah was his unfinished work.  

                                  RYAN
                    He wanted to prove he could get the 
                    ending right this time.  

      She turns to him.  Direct.  Honest.  

                                  MASON
                    I m sorry.  

      Beat.  They look back to the ocean.  

                                  RYAN
                    What made you come?  

                                  MASON
                    You got to me.  Laredo wasn t very 
                    poetic. 
                          (then a smile)
                    And you re a bad influence.     

      Beat.  Ryan appreciates this.    


      Establishing.  


      It s late.  The sorority house is dark and quiet.  A cute 
      girl, LINDA, is at the door, struggling with her keys-- when 
      a FIGURE appears in the shadows. 

      BACK TO JOE CARROLL.

                                  JOE CARROLL 
                    Fun fact.  Did you know the FBI 
                    estimates there are up to 300 
                    serial killers active in the US on 
                    any given day?  

      ON LINDA as she senses someone.  She spins around to find a 
      CAMPUS SECURITY GUARD on the porch.  She JUMPS.  

                                  CAMPUS SECURITY
                    Sorry, didn t mean to scare you.

      Linda catches her breath.  Relieved it s security.  But a 
      closer look reveals a big lug of a man.  Imposing.  It s 
      actually JORDY RAINES -- dressed as a CAMPUS SECURITY GUARD.  
      He smiles at the young girl.

                                  LINDA
                    Is everything okay?

                                  JORDY
                    Extra patrol this evening.

                                  LINDA
                    Yeah, but they caught him.  I heard 
                    it on the news.                                                                                    56.


                                  JORDY
                    Still.  Mind if I look around, 
                    check your doors and windows?

      Linda unlocks the door and allows Jordy entrance.  

                                  LINDA
                    I think everyone s asleep. 

      As Jordy steps inside.


      Denise s car pulls up and stops behind another VEHICLE.  
      Sarah s gay neighbors (real names PAUL and JACOB) are 
      waiting.  They help retrieve a sleeping Joey. 

      They ditch Denise s car and quickly get into the other one 
      and take off into the night.
