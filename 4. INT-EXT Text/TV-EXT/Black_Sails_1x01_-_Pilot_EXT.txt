The Walrus sails into the warm blue bay, a handful of other 
PIRATE SHIPS sitting at anchor nearby.  TENDER SHIPS and 
BARGES shuttle about, ferrying passengers and cargo...


A HARBOR BARGE comes ashore, and a number of pirates 
disembark and begin unloading cargo.  Among the crowd, Silver 
steps forward, and takes in--

towards a small SKIFF anchored just off the sand.

GATES
No, but I have business here, so 
the job falls to you.   Untitled Pirate Project - 2ND DRAFT - Steinberg/Levine 9/28/11   20.


BILLY
And what is the job, exactly?

GATES
The Captain is going to ask Richard 
for a favor.  Richard is going to 
say no.  When that happens, the 
Captain will, most likely, react 
poorly.  When that happens, I need 
you to restrain him.  

Billy stops dead in his tracks.  It takes Gates a few steps 
before he realizes.  Doubles back to Billy...  

GATES (CONT D)
No cargo moves off this island

He reaches in, and pulls out--  A BOOK.  THEN ANOTHER.  A 
handful of journals of varying sizes.  

Silver looks around.  Makes sure no one is watching him...  
Carefully selects THREE BOOKS that are the same size as his 
MYSTERIOUS TORN-OUT PAGE...

He opens one. On the first page: Captain s Log -- Vol.1.  
Silver compares the mystery page-- THE HANDWRITING MATCHES.  

 He then quickly flips through the book.  But it doesn t
appear to be missing a page.  Opens the next book.  Flips.  
Nothing missing there either.  Ditto, the third one.  But he 
notes that the books are labelled Vols. 1, 2 and 4.  THERE S 
ONE MISSING.  Off Silver, getting closer to an answer--

MOMENTS LATER, we find Dufresne, hunched over a makeshift 
table, recording cargo as its unloaded in a ledger...

Flint continues to hammer down with his fists.  Again.  And 
again... turning Singleton s face to pulp.  The crew watches, 
 stunned and sickened, as...  Singleton stops moving.  It s
over.  

Flint staggers to his feet, immediately begins searching the 
 pockets, as the crew closes in... dead man sWhat s he doing?  

Flint PRODUCES A FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER...  Holds it up for 
the crew to see.  

ON SILVER...  Completely thrown.  Instinctively checks his 
pocket to make sure he still has the map...  He does.  So 
what the fuck does Flint have?

BACK TO FLINT, chest-heaving, holding the paper.

FLINT
Billy...

Billy looks up, surprised.  Flint staggers toward him, 
holding the page out with a BLOODIED HAND.

FLINT (CONT D)
The crew has your trust.

Is this the stolen page?

 something Billy stares at Flint, hesitant.  Knows there s
deliberate about this, but he s compelled to go along.  After 
a beat, he takes the paper, unfolds it and sees--

 BLANK.  IT SUntitled Pirate Project - 2ND DRAFT - Steinberg/Levine 9/28/11   58.


Billy looks up, sees Flint staring back.  A silent message.  
Are you with me...?  

Billy is frozen.  He holds the captain s fate in his hands.  
We stay on his face for a VERY LONG TIME, before--

BILLY
It is.

The crew reacts, stunned...  Too stunned, in fact, to see--

As his crew dives for cover, Vane looks up and sees... the

GUTHRIE
What the fuck did I just do?

Off Flint, has to smile--


A small encampment, on the other side of the island from 
Nassau.  Wild, overgrown.

The Ranger is up on the beach, CAREENED against the hulk of 
an old wreck.  As the crew works to repair her, we find--
