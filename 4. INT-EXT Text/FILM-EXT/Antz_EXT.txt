The camera swoops towards the entrance, then dives inside,
past a couple of tough-looking soldier ants who stand at the
gates of the ant colony like insect bouncers...into an access
tunnel that snakes this way and that, past a row of ants
plodding along...
...and into the MAIN CHAMBER of the colony, a huge, teeming
vista that seems to stretch away forever, filled with ants
rushing here and there on their business.
We see -- a
"traffic cop" directing foot traffic, waving his arms like
crazy so both sides move at once -- a column of soldier ants
marching along in formation -- a chain of ants letting down
a matchbox elevator filled with workers.
Z (V.O.)
...which is kind of a problem, since
I've always felt uncomfortably in
crowds.
Z is talking to Weaver, who's getting ready to go off to war.
Nearby, columns of ant soldiers march by.
WEAVER
Get real, Z!
She just dropped the
scarf by accident!
Z
Are you kidding?
There were sparks
between us!
This scarf is a sign!
WEAVER
It's a sign that you're crazy!
Do
you know what the penalty for
impersonating a soldier is?
Z
What's gonna go wrong?!
I take your
place for the royal inspection.
Bala
comes strolling down the line, she
sees me -- bingo!
Love is rekindled,
and she takes me up to the palace for
a little...
(wags his eyebrows
suggestively)
tea and crumpets... and you take your
place again, and go march around to
your heart's content!
Weaver looks unconvinced.
Z
You have to help me.
Please, Weaver.
Think of all the things I've done for
you!
WEAVER
(thinks)
I can't think of any.
Z
(pause)
Well I'm gonna start doing things for
you...
WEAVER
Will you introduce me to some worker
girls?
Z
You bet!
They'll really go for a
sensitive guy like you!
WEAVER
Maybe I'll get lucky.
(Weaver thinks about
it)
You know, Z, I wouldn't do this
for anyone but you...
Weaver hands Z has helmet.
WEAVER
Wear this.
Z
(overjoyed)
You're a real buddy.
WEAVER
(sourly)
Yeah, I know.
Z
What do I do?
WEAVER
Don't tell anyone you're a worker.
Follow that column over there.
And
come right back after the inspection!
Weaver points to a bunch of soldiers hurrying by in formation.
Z
(overjoyed)
Thanks!
I owe you!
Z skips off and joins the column, marching in time with the
soldiers but too excited to keep from jazzing it up a little.
It's a starry, moonlit night.
The shadows crowd around the
panicked Z, who looks up at the sky as we see the army on the
march...
Z
Wait a minute, there's been a
mistake!
I've got to get back to the
colony!
Z starts to fall out of line, but Barbatus, looking
concerned, stops him.
BARBATUS
Are you crazy, kid?
They shoot
deserters!
Z swallows hard.
BARBATUS
You just stick by old Barbatus.
He'll watch out for you.
(off Z's look)
Whatsamatter, kid?
Leave a girl
behind?
Z
Yeah.
Well -- no.
She's kind of
playing hard to get.
As a matter of
fact, she's playing completely
unattainable.
(nervously)
So, what's on the schedule?
A brisk
walk?
a foraging expedition?
BARBATUS
No -- we're going to attack the
termites!
Z
(alarmed)
Attack?
But -- I hate attacking!
It's so hostile!
Around Z and Barbatus, the ants start up a marching song,
which we intersperse with dialogue between Barbatus and Z to
form a montage/time-cut as the ant army marches on to the
termite capital.
ANT SOLDIERS
(to the tune of "When
Johnny Comes
Marching Home")
We ants go marching one by
one, hurrah, hurrah!
We slaughter
termites just for fun, Hurrah!
Hurrah!
Z
So -- these termites, they're little,
shy, retiring insects?
BARBATUS
(grim smile)
No such luck.
Those dirty terms are
five times bigger than us, and they
shoot acid from their foreheads!
SOLDIER ANTS
We ants go marching two by two,
hurrah!
Hurrah!
We'll all be dead
before we're through, hurrah!
Hurrah!
Montage shots of an ant column marching diagonally across the
screen, fading into another column marching diagonally
downwards across the screen...
Z
Well, what exactly does our platoon
do?
Serve beverages?
Process
paperwork?
BARBATUS
Our platoon has the best assignment
of all.
We're the first into battle!
ANT SOLDIERS
We ants are marching three by three,
hurrah!
Hurrah!
Dead ants is what
we soon will be, hurrah!
Hurrah!
...montage shot of Z's column crossing a bridge composed of
living ants -- all of whom look extremely uncomfortable as
they're getting stepped on...
Z
So we're going back for more armor,
right?
I mean, these guys are from
outer space, how are we supposed to
beat them?!
BARBATUS
Superior numbers, kid!
Z looks up to see...looming high above them...the TERMITE
CITY, which is built in the stump of a dead tree.
From here
it looks like a demonic Mount Fuji.
The COLONEL ANT shouts
an order.
COLONEL
ATTAAAAAAAAACK!!!
The front line of ants starts rushing towards the termite
colony...Z is swept along...
BARBATUS
Over the TOOOOOOOOOOOOO-OP!!!
Z is swept along and up the side of the stump as thousands of
ants invade the colony through every possible entrance.
Up...over the lip of the stump...and down inside, to the very
middle of the termite colony...
Into a disquietingly peaceful scene.
They're in the middle
of the hollowed-out trunk, and ants keep pouring in -- but
there's not a termite to be seen.
Barbatus looks around
suspiciously.
BARBATUS
It's too damn quiet.
Then we hear a strange tapping noise.
Barbatus looks over,
and sees that Z's teeth are chattering with fear.
BARBATUS
Don't be scared, kid.
Barbatus's
got yer back.
Z
(petrified)
Maybe they went out for the evening.
Let's leave them a message and head
home.
COLONEL
(ignoring him)
Light it up!
A nearby soldier ant take a firefly out of his knapsack and
pinches him.
The firefly, yelling "Yipe!
Yipe!
Yipe!",
shoots into the air like a flare, lighting up the interior of
the stump with eery, shifting luminescence.
Then we notice, hollowed into the inside of the stump like
innumerable pockmarks, termite holes staring out upon the
stump...and, with an unearthly ROAR, we see the first of
hundreds of termites emerging to pour into the center of the
tree, right onto the ant army.
COLONEL
They're here!!!
BARBATUS
(to Z)
Keep your head down!
Within moments, Z finds himself in the middle of a
BLOODBATH.
The ants have broken into the colony, but are
taking heavy losses from the gigantic, blind, acid-spewing
termites.
The battle scene is as sprawling and chaotic as
something out of Braveheart. In a few QUICK SHOTS from Z's
perspective, we see:
-- A squad of ants rushes towards a termite soldier, but are
literally melted into smoking heaps of flesh by a jet of acid
from its forehead...
-- A termite warrior is overwhelmed by a crowd of ants and is
pulled to pieces with hideous ripping sounds...
-- Another termite warrior takes on an ant soldier one on one
and slowly crushes his head in his huge jaws...
Z
(looking around)
Guys!
Guys!
It isn't too late for
all of us to just talk this over!
Just then, a termite burst up from the ground and turns to
face Z.
Z is dwarfed by this hulking, roaring, drooling
monstrosity.
Z
Wait!
Please!
Acid makes me come
out in spots!
-- Could I just say I
have always had the greatest respect
for your species?
I mean, eating
wood -- why didn't I think of that?
I --
The termite rears, getting ready to melt Z, when OOF! he's
knocked backwards by...
Z
BARBATUS!
You -- you saved my life!
BARBATUS
Don't get all sappy about it!
As Barbatus and some other soldiers kill the termite, the
Colonel strides up to Z, puffing on a cigar.
COLONEL
I love the smell of formic acid in
the morning.
Z
Look out!
A stream of termite acid engulfs the colonel, instantly
burning him to a cinder clutching a still-burning cigar; Z's
paratroop buddies turn in terror to see a herd of termites
rumbling towards them.
Z, terrified, dives into the hole
that the huge termite made...
Z makes his way across the corpse-strewn battlefield, an
expression of horror on his face.
BARBATUS (O.S.)
Z!
Over here!
Z
(hopeful)
Barbatus?
Z looks down at his feet, where Barbatus's still-living,
decapitated head is looking up at him.
Z
(shocked)
Barbatus!
BARBATUS
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Z
No, no, you're...lookin' good.
You've got good color in your cheeks.
BARBATUS
No -- I can see it in your eyes.
I'm
a goner.
It's alright, Z.
In this
ant's army, a soldier's life ain't
worth a sack of fungus.
(he winces)
I can't feel my legs...
Z
Hang in there, buddy!
You can make
it!
Just -- take deep breaths, I'll
try and find your body -- it's gotta
be around here somewhere!
BARBATUS
(gasping)
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Z
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
BARBATUS
Don't make my mistake, kid...
don't...be a grunt...your whole
life...
Barbatus dies, leaving Z heartbroken.
CUT TO:
Some guard ants are looking out across the sandy main
entrance to the hive.
GUARD ANT
Look!
They're back!
The army's
back!
Alert the colony!
The other ant starts ringing a bell, rushing down into the
colony.
CUT TO:
Z and Formica are going up the royal "stairway" together.
FORMICA
Son, you're an ant after my own
heart.
A warrior.
An ant that looks
death right in the face and laughs.
Z
Well, I generally just make
belittling comments and snicker
behind death's back.
So, tell me,
fellow war-monger...do you think
Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
FORMICA
Well she better -- she's engaged to
one.
Me!
Z
Engaged?
As in you're getting
married?
FORMICA
Affirmative.
Z
So...you two are in love?
FORMICA
In love?
(shakes his head)
I'm just a plain old soldier at
heart.
I'll tell you what I love --
the field -- blood -- death --
orders...and the company of other
warriors.
Formica gives Z a manly slap on the back.
Z looks a little
uncomfortable as we...
CUT TO:
HOLD ON: the GARBAGE CHUTE EXIT.
Nothing happens for a
moment.
Then --
From a distance, we hear the faint sound of SCREAMING,
dopplering closer --
-- and then Z and Bala come flying out of the exit, right
into the mud, cutting off the scream abruptly.
Bala sits up, coated in mud.
Z is nowhere to be seen.
Because she's on top of him.
PRINCESS
This is thoroughly unacceptable!
Z
You're telling me...
She gets up and runs back towards the colony entrance, where
soldiers are already issuing to get her...
BALA
I'm coming!
I'm coming!
But...just as Bala'a about to be rescued...what looks like a
gigantic LASER BEAM sweeps along the rim of the colony,
sizzling the ground as it moves along...and IGNITES the lead
soldier into FLAMES!
Bala looks stunned.
Z watches in horror as another soldier ant is FRIED, and we
look up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNIFYING GLASS casting the
beam...we can just about make out the huge, grotesque figure
(a seven year old kid) holding it.
Bala, who has no idea what's really going on, turns from the
colony and runs the other way.
BALA
I'm going!
I'm going'
...unfortunately, this draws the fire of the laser, which
follows after her in what looks like a strafing run, SIZZLING
in her footsteps.
Z, who's running towards the princess, suddenly realizes that
he's running towards certain doom...and joins Bala in legging
it away from the colony; under a brown leaf, which bursts
into flames...between the redwood-like stalks of some
flowers...and finally into the relative safety of some
grass...where they throw themselves on the ground, exhausted.
CUT TO:
Z and Bala dust themselves off.
BALA
What was that thing?
Z
How should I know?
BALA
I order you to find out where we are!
Z
Alright, alright, I'll try to get
directions from one of the locals.
Z tries to flag down some passing bees.
Z
Excuse me, I --
(it passes him by;
he tries the next)
Pardon me --
(same response)
And they call them social insects.
BALA
Climb up that tree and get a better
view!
Bala points to a thin blade of grass.
Gingerly, Z tests the
grass and starts climbing up it...but his weight bends it, so
that he's lowered back to the ground, face to upside-down
face with Bala.
BALA
I've been kidnapped by the village
idiot.
Z
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot
who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who
lets herself get kidnapped by the
idiot?
BALA
How dare you speak to me like that?
I'm the Princess!
Z squares up with her.
Z
Theoretically, yes.
But is the
monarchical hierarchy applicable
without the underlying social
structure to support it?
BALA
Of course!
It defines society!
To
deny the precept is to say that order
is an arbitrary distinction applied
by the society itself!
Z
But can there be a society composed
of just two ants?
BALA
No!
There's no such thing as "just
two ants."
You never see just two
ants -- you see a million ants!
Z
Look around, sweetheart.
She looks around.
She doesn't like what she sees.
She
glowers at Z.
BALA
I -- hate -- you.
Z
Well I guess that makes us even.
BALA
Ha!
Don't make me laugh.
You're
crazy about me!
That's why you lied
and cheated to get near me!
Z
Oh come on, you're the one who came
after me -- the swarthy, earthy,
sensual worker!
BALA
(repulsed)
I was slumming it!
I danced with you
because you were the most pathetic
specimen in the place!
Z
Is that the same standard you used to
choose General Formica?
BALA
I didn't choose him.
What kind
of
idiot would...
(unconvincingly)
...choose who she wanted to marry?
She shakes herself out of it.
BALA
Now, worker, you shall take me back
to the colony, and have your head cut
off and stuck on a sharp pole!
Z
Well, that's an appealing offer,
but...considering the options...
(he decides)
You go back.
Me, I'm going to
Insectopia.
BALA
Insectopia?
You stupid worker,
that's just a fairy tale!
Z
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable
source...
(he knows that was
maybe stretching it)
that it exists.
Now you follow
the yellow egg...
(looking around)
That direction.
BALA
Worker!
Come back here now!
Z
I've got a name.
It's Z.
BALA
That's not a name!
That's just a
letter!
Z, meanwhile, hits the road.
Bala has no idea of where to
go.
Just then, the scariness of the outside world comes
through to her.
We start hearing NOISES -- the equivalent of scary jungle
sounds in a Tarzan movie -- the HISSING, CROAKING,
CHIRRUPING... Bala sees eyes looking out at her from all
directions...and spots a colossal monster (a sparrow) fixing
her with his beady gaze.
BALA
(clears her throat)
Worker?
(no response...louder
now)
Oh WORKER?
Where are you?
(getting desperate)
Z?
Z?
Wait for me!!!
Bala heads off after Z.
LONG SHOT.
A glimmering desert landscape (think of "The
Sun's Anvil" in Lawrence of Arabia).
Two small figures can
be seen, tiny dots moving across the arid whiteness.
They're Bala and Z, who are crossing a concrete path in the
park, which they perceive to be a "desert".
BALA
Water...water...
Z
Water...water -- oh, you already said
that.
BALA
(walking along)
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is
cracking...I wish I'd never met you,
you ruined my life.
Z
I ruined your life?
Look, I was
perfectly happy until I met you --
alright, I was miserable, but I was
happily miserable.
Over Z's line, we can see a GIGANTIC WHEEL, getting larger
and larger and heading right towards them, a GIGANTIC WHEEL
(the front wheel of a bicycle which is heading right towards
them).
BALA
Look out!
Bala pushes Z out of the way just as the wheel rolls past
with a cacophonous CRUNCHING, GRINDING noise -- like a
gigantic millwheel.
BALA
We're going to die!
Z
Come on -- it's gone!
What are the
chances of that happening again?
No sooner has he said it than the rear wheel of the bike
thunders past.
Z
Well I'll be.
Bala notices that they're clutching one another in fear; she
pushes him away.
BALA
Why didn't I listen to my mother
...why'd I have to go looking for
trouble? Any ant would have given
their left legs to be in my
position...what's wrong with me?
Z
Want a list?
BALA
(urgent)
Wait, I hear something!
We can, in fact, hear a low, musical PLUNK.. there's a pause
and then we can hear it again...
Z and Bala walk over a rocky "dune" (the soft shoulder of the
path).
Beyond, the grass starts up again.
They have come to
the end of the "desert" (i.e. the other side of the path)
Through the blades of grass, we can see...
Z
It's...it's...
BALA
WATER!!!
A LAKE (a puddle) stretches before them.
It is, in fact, the
overflow of a drinking-fountain whose drain is jammed...as Z
and Bala run to the lake, water dribbles from the fountain
and into one edge of the pool (to the ants, it's a waterfall).
Bala and Z run to the edge of the water and start slurping.
They smile at each other, until they remember that they don't
like each other.
Z
This lake is huge!
And so close to
the colony!
Think of the vacation
potential!
BALA
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take
a nap.
Z
Listen, "Princess", you can't order
me around.
Out here, you're not the
boss anymore -- out here, you're
just --
-- But before he can finish, a water droplet from the
fountain falls on him.
It may not sound like much, but to Z
it's as though a ten-foot diameter sphere of jello had
engulfed him.
Z's stuck inside because of the surface tension of the
droplet, which doesn't burst, just quivers up and down.
Inside, Z is slowly, frantically drowning and screaming for
help.
But his screams are muffled in the water.
BALA
(annoyed)
Out here I'm just what?
Z
(through the water)
Hlllllllp!
BALA
(hands on hips)
Stop fooling around in there.
By now the droplet has started rolling, and Z is being turned
upside-down.
He manages to get one foreleg out of the
droplet, and, in a frantic attempt to pull himself out, pulls
Bala in by the leg.
BALA
Let me go!!!
But it's too late -- they're now both stuck in the droplet,
and, as Z continues to drown, he also has to deal with Bala
yelling at him -- though we can't hear exactly what it. is
she's yelling through the water.
Then, having run out of air, she too starts thrashing,
alternately trying to swim and trying to slap him as Z tries
to defend himself.
Finally all this commotion is enough to
make the droplet burst, spilling the two coughing,
sputtering, drenched ants onto the ground.
They both lie there, miserable, wet, and cold.
BALA
(chants to herself)
I'm going to be rescued soon.
I'm
going to be rescued soon.
I'm going
to be rescued soon.
Z watches her incredulously.
Z
Princess, has it ever occurred to you
that they're not going to rescue you?
BALA
General Formica won't let me die out
here.
I'm his fiancee.
Z
Look.
How many other Princesses are
there?
BALA
Five thousand three hundred and
ninety -- no.
About five thousand
four hundred by now.
Z
And only you can become a Queen?
BALA
Well...no, but --
Z
So what makes you so special?
BALA
(hesitates)
Well...I am the oldest.
Bala turns from Z.
She's thinking things over, realization
dawning on her.
BALA
By three seconds...
She looks out into the grass forest.
BALA
(to herself)
You're right.
There are as many
Princesses...as there are blades of
grass.
Z, overhearing her, slowly puts his hand on her shoulder.
GRASS JUNGLE - DAY
Z and Bala are lost, wandering through the grass
BALA
(looking hopeless)
I swear, we've passed this blade of
grass three times.
Z keeps marching on.
BALA
Face it, Z, we're lost!
We must have
walked halfway across the world by
now!
How did I get into this mess...
Z
(too shy to look at
her)
Come on...tell me there wasn't just
a little...something between us that
first night at the bar.
The night we
danced.
BALA
(sadly)
What difference does it make...we're
both going to starve to death, or get
squished, or set on fire...
But Z is just gawking.
The shot expands to show that they
have stumbled onto...
Z
...The land of red and white...
A PICNICGROUNDS...A red and white picnic blanket, which to
the ants looks like a vast, undulating pavilion, stretches
before them.
They gaze up at two obelisks: a salt and pepper
shaker.
Behind that is a gigantic tupperware jar full of potato
salad, and sandwiches stacked high.
It all looks perfect,
with the clean lines and monumental proportions of fascist
architecture.
In fact, it looks a little too perfect.
Z
We've found it!
Insectopia!
Look at
all this food'
BALA
(amazed)
You were right...you were right!
(smiling happily)
Z, it's beautiful!
Z
Let's dig in!
Z goes over to a gigantic sandwich, but -- BOOIIING! -- he's
prevented from getting at it by the saran wrap covering it.
Z
There's - there's some kind of force
field!
Bala joins him, laboring against the saran wrap.
Then both
of them hear laughter from above.
MALE WASP (O.S.)
(lockjawed accent)
Muffy, look, party-crashers.
FEMALE WASP (O.S.)
(laughing)
They're simply too much, Chip!
Bala and Z look up to see two large, yellow WASPS hovering in
the air above them.
The husband and wife wasps have
lockjawed, William F. Buckleyesque accents.
MALE WASP
(to Z and Bala)
You down there, haven't you ever been
to a picnic?
Z
Hunh?
FEMALE WASP
Habla Ingles?
(to Male Wasp)
Well I really don't know who they are.
Z
We're ants!
The Male Wasp zooms in closer.
MALE WASP
Poopsie, we know some ants, don't we?
(to Z)
Are you related to the Fifth Avenue
ants?
FEMALE WASP
Darling, do you have to talk to any
insect from off the street?
MALE WASP
Just being friendly, Poopsie.
BALA
Hello?
I'm not just "any insect".
My mother is the Queen.
(momentously)
I'm Princess Bala!
MALE WASP
(under his breath)
They're Eurotrash, dear.
We hear a loud RUMBLING noise -- the family is about to sit
down for their picnic lunch.
Gigantic hands reach down and
pull away the "force fields".
MALE WASP
Lunch!
(to Z)
A little piece of advice, sport --
bob and weave!
Bob and weave!
BALA
What do you mean?
MALE WASP
Well -- like my father used to say --
there's no such thing as a free meal!
The wasps dive in to the picnic, darting in for a bite, and
then dashing away again...
THE WASPS
Excuse me -- I'll have some potato
salad -- thank-you! -- don't mind if
I do!
After you! (etc.)
-- But all is not well.
We pull back to reveal that Z and
Bala are standing in front of a giant sneaker logo, which is
attached to a giant sneaker.
Which moves.
Z
I sort of imagined Insectopia a
little differently --
Just at that moment, we hear a whistling in the air -- and
the female wasp is crushed by a huge swatter that sweeps out
of the sky, sending the picnic blanket billowing up in an
aftershock that throws Bala and Z to the ground.
BALA
Oh...my...God.
MALE WASP
(shaking her)
Muffy!
Muffy!
Wake up!
But she doesn't move.
The Male Wasp stares up at the sky.
MALE WASP
(heartbroken)
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY????
But Z, also looking up, has no time to commiserate.
Z
Bala, look out!!
They are only saved by the fact that they are so small - .the
holes of the swatter pass over them.
The woman, realizing that the swatter won't work on ants,
throws it to the side and tries stomping on them...
Before Bala can get away, a sneaker falls on her with a
thunderous BOOM that shakes the ground.
BALA
MMMffllmmm...
The shoe rises, as the person wearing it steps away...and we
see that Bala is stuck in one of the ridges of the waffle-
soled sneaker, adhering to a big piece of bubblegum!
BALA
Z!
Help me!!!
But Bala is carried off on the sneaker in a huge, looping,
ferris-wheel-like motion.
BOOM.
The sneaker on which Bala
is stuck falls again, as the woman tries to step on Z, too --
Z
Bala!
(mournfully)
I'll never see her again...
-- But he does, instantly, as the shoe rises again, showing
Bala stuck deeper in the bubblegum --
BALA
Z!!!
Get me out of heeeeere!
-- The woman has decided to walk away from the picnic to get
the bubblegum off her shoe...Z heart sinks as the shoe Bala's
stuck on lopes off into the distance...
Z
(thinks)
These things always come in twos...
He sees a SECOND SHOE starting to rise --
Z
Take me to your leader!
Z runs towards the shoe as it rises... and at the last moment
catches on to the snaky, swinging shoe-lace.
Z
Whoooooooaaaa!!!
The sneaker lifts off into the air, with Z holding on for
dear life to the lace, and getting further and further away
from Bala as he's drawn to a vertiginous height...the
landscape can be seen rolling and pitching crazily in the
background...
Z
Bala!
Come back here!
For a moment, the sneaker seems to pause in the air...then it
descends again, in a stomach-churning, roller-coaster free-
fall as the sneaker on which Bala is stuck rises up again...
BALA
Z!!!!!!!
I'm stuck!
--
But Z is trying to keep his lunch down as he descends.
The sneaker hits the ground, and Z can feel himself
again...it's now or never.
Z
(Tarzan whoop)
Aa-ee-ya-ee-yaaaaaaaah!!!!!!!
As the sneaker rises again, he swings off the lace, hurtling
through the air and catching one of the laces of Bala's
sneaker...the momentum swings him up and under the sole...
BALA
Z!
You're here!
Z gets smashed into the bubblegum next to Bala.
Now he's
stuck too.
Z
(ruefully)
Yeah.
I'm here.
The sneaker descends again.
Z and Bala hold hands and SCREAM
as they see the ground rise too meet them...
THUD!
They're squished deeper into the bubblegum.
The
sneaker rises again...
BALA
(emotional)
Z...if we don't make it...I just want
you to know....
Z
(touched)
Yes?
BALA
This is all your fault!!!
The sneaker rises, and seems ready to fall again...but
instead it just hovers there.
(The person wearing it is
balancing on one leg and about to scrape off the bubblegum
with a penny).
Z
We're safe...
Just then, the hand holding the penny looms up...the penny
is, by ant standards, about sixty feet high.
The huge image
of Abraham Lincoln stares down at them.
Z
Who the hell is that?!!!
The penny starts scrapes the bubblegum off the sneaker,
bringing Bala and Z along with it.
They're carried through
the air as the penny gets thrown away...turning over and over
in a lopsided orbit as Bala and Z SCREAM...
...and land with a CRASH in total darkness.
The "lake" where Z and Bala were nearly drowned by the water
droplet.
The earth shakes as a HUGE, MONSTROUS creature approaches the
lake - and begins to drink from it.
The creature seems to
hear something, and, growling, turns its ugly head.
It's a
Pomeranian, one of those yappy little lap-dogs -- but seen
from ant perspective, it's something out of a horror movie.
TOUGH VOICE (O.S.)
Ant Team Six -- take him out!
The monster bears its huge fangs at the approaching
intruders -- a bunch of flying ants who look as though
they're attacking the Death Star!
The monster rears and snaps at two of the ants, who are
making a diversionary run...
and then gets it from the rest of the ants, who land on his
soft, wet nose and start stinging away like crazy.
The monster rears back in pain -- and runs away, YIPPING!
The members of ANT TEAM SIX, a crack team of hardcore flying-
ant commandoes a la Seal Team Six, break off the attack and
land.
MAJOR MANDIBLE
And don't come back, you sissy!
MAJOR MANDIBLE, Ant Team Six's lethal commander, steps into
frame.
He's the one-eyed killer we met in the bar earlier.
The rest of his team fan out to search the area.
MANDIBLE
Talk to me.
COMMANDO ANT
Z and the Princess were here, sir.
Signs of a struggle.
MANDIBLE
Let's get a read on that feremone
track.
COMMANDO ANT #1
(to the others)
Get the sniffer!
Two other commandoes come running up with what looks like a
piece of machinery on a tripod -- only it's an ant -- a
highly specialized, blind ant with an incredibly acute sense
of smell.
TRACKER ANT
Bala...find Bala...
The tracker, drool running out of its long proboscis, sniffs
the air and starts signalling like a geiger counter...
TRACKER ANT
(as he's swivelled)
Nnononononononoyeahyeahnononononono
no...
Finally the tracker stops swivelling, pointing in one
direction and saying, "Yeahyeahyeahyeah..."
COMMANDO ANT #3
Got 'em!
Ten clicks from here!
MANDIBLE
Z -- you dirt-digging, fancy-dancing,
wisecracking, royalty-grabbing, rebel
SCUM!
(yelling into the
distance)
I AM COMING FOR YOU!
YOU ARE ONE
DEAD ANT, MISTER!
Mandible's muscles bulge.
The veins in his head throb.
This
is one ass-kicking ant.
Even Mandible's troops look scared
of him.
MANDIBLE
Let's MOVE!
GO, people!
GO!
GO!
GO!
GO!
GO!
Ant Team Six takes to the air, heading in the direction
indicated by the tracker ant.
The insects are having a cookout, their faces illuminated by
the still-red ember of a match.
Platters heaped with food
lie untouched as they pat their bellies...
Z and Bala sit next to one another, smiling shyly as if they
had just met for the first time.
Z
So...you never did tell me...what
made you come out to the worker bar
that night?
BALA
Just looking for fun, adventure,
trouble, I guess.
Z
Well, "trouble" is my middle name.
Actually, my
middle name is .985,
but I don't tell people.
Hey, Bala,
I...I actually have something of
yours...you left it at the bar that
night.
Z takes out Bala's scarf, which he's been keeping folded in
a pocket.
Z
Sorry, it's been through a war, not
to mention everything else...
BALA
You held onto this all that time?
Z
Well, I...I know it's a little
strange, but...I thought it might
come in handy if I...needed a scarf
someday.
(embarrassed)
Well, to be honest, I just liked
having it.
He hands it back to her.
Bala looks at Z, frankly, openly.
For a moment Z is shy.
Then he looks at her too.
They're
two lovers, leaning closer, about to have their first kiss,
when --
BEETLE
Hey Z!
The moment is wrecked.
Z looks up.
A chubby beetle stands
there with Gus the termite.
BEETLE
Wanna bring back dessert?
There's a
thirty foot long blimp in the next
can, made completely of chocolate!
Z
(annoyed)
Sure.
I wasn't busy or anything.
Z gets up to go with them.
Z
Great timing, guys.
Ever wonder why
they call you "pests"?
INSECTOPIA, TOP OF CAN - NIGHT
As Ant Team Six lands and takes up position above the feast.
The tracker ant is going nuts.
TRACKER ANT
Yesyesyesyesyes --
One of the commandoes puts his hand over the tracker's mouth
to shut him up.
Mandible communicates with his troops by
pulling down his one functional antenna and gruffly
whispering into it, as though it were one of those commando
headsets.
His troops do likewise.
MANDIBLE
Talk to me.
COMMANDO #1
I've got a read on the Princess --
but target Z isn't accounted for.
MANDIBLE
Let's move in.
Back at the feast, a cricket strums on his legs like a
guitar, opining about life and the universe to a bunch of
other chilled-out, hippyesque insects...Bala taps her feet to
the song.
CRICKET
What if, like...we're just these tiny
little things, and we're just like
part of this whole other huge
universe, that's like, so big we
don't even know it exists?
LADYBUG
Man...that's so deep...
At that moment Ant Team Six rapels down from the top of the
garbage bin, landing amongst the insects.
MANDIBLE
EVERYBODY DOWN!
The cricket gets up to confront Mandible, but Mandible cold
cocks him with a right to the jaw.
The other insects, too
surprised to fight, just do as they're told.
MANDIBLE
Alright, you hippy scum!
Make one
move and I'll exterminate you!
A couple of commandoes grab Bala by the arms and heave her up.
BALA
Stop!
You don't understand!
MANDIBLE
I don't have to understand, Missy --
I've got orders.
Now where's Z?
CUT TO:
The wasp and Z fly high above the colony...
Z
Wow...I never saw things this way...
From here, we can see the whole layout of the land around the
colony...the "desert" (an asphalt path) and across it, the
"lake" (the overflowing water fountain)
Z
Things look so close together from up
here...there's the desert...and the
lake...
(thinking about
something)
it's not far from the colony at all...
Suddenly, the wasp bounces up and down in the air.
MALE WASP
Sorry.
Turbulence.
Z hops down from the wasp, who has landed near the entrance
to the colony.
MALE WASP
Good luck, Z.
For a wingless insect,
you're alright by me.
Z
Thanks, Chip.
They shake hands and the wasp flies off.
Z
(to himself)
How am I going to get in?
The place
is crawling with soldiers!
Z starts for the nearest entrance -- but he's spotted by a
couple of SOLDIER ANTS.
SOLDIER ANT
You there!
Worker!
Z's caught -- it's over.
He turns around with his hands up.
Z
Don't bite!
I surrender!
SOLDIER ANT
What are you doing out here!
All
workers are to remain inside the
colony, by orders of General Formica!
Z can't believe his luck -- and his curiosity is piqued.
Z
(heading inside)
Well...if you insist...
Outside of the colony, where Formica, surrounded by the army,
gives a signal to Mandible by drawing his finger across his
throat...
MANDIBLE
(talking into his
antenna)
Let 'er rip!
...And Azteca's head pokes through the ground...she hauls
herself up, and hundreds of ants pour up from the ground,
widening the hole...
WORKER
He did it!
Z!
Z!
Z!
Z!
Z!
The "Z" cheer goes up, with everyone joining in.
But the
jubilation is short-lived, for, appearing on the ridge,
surrounding the workers, is FORMICA'S ARMY, circling the mass
of workers, backing them in towards the roiling water behind
them.
Formica himself appears in the front lines, with
Carpenter and Mandible at his side.
FORMICA
Z.
I should have known.
All that
work, all that preparation, come to
nothing.
All because of one stinking
ant.
He steps forward to address the surrounded, trapped workers.
FORMICA
ALRIGHT.
WHICH ONE OF YOU IS Z?
The workers, trembling but silent, cower inside the unbroken
circle of soldiers.
FORMICA
WHAT ARE YOU, DEAF?
I ASKED YOU,
WHERE'S Z?
Formica laughs, shaking his head.
FORMICA
Folks, you may have survived that
flood, but there's no way you're
gonna escape from me.
I'll make you
a deal.
Hand over the rebel leader
Z, and you survive.
This sends a ripple of murmurs through the workers.
FORMICA
But if you don't hand him over,
you're all going to die, each and
every single..."individual" one of
you.
The workers all look at each other.
FORMICA
What shall it be, workers?
The workers remain frightened but silent.
Z trembles,
terrified.
FORMICA
Have it your way.
As Formica raises his swagger stick to order the attack, a
lone figure steps out from the crowd.
Z
Wait...
Z stands there, shivering with fear.
Z
...I'm Z.
For a moment, Z stands alone, under the glare of Formica's
gaze.
Then another figure steps out from the throng of workers.
WEAVER
No, I'm Z.
Z turns, astonished, to see Weaver, still and unwavering,
bravely risking his life for his friend.
Then, AZTECA also
steps forward.
AZTECA
I'm Z!
Next, Bala comes forward.
BALA
No, I'm Z.
More and more ants step forward.
WORKERS
I'm Z!
I'm Z!
I'm Z and so is my
brother!
I've been Z for weeks now!
QUEEN
(regally)
We are Z.
Now, the workers are all shouting the same declaration.
ALL
I am Z!
I am Z!
I am Z!
Z is plainly flabbergasted.
Formica is outraged.
He gives
the signal.
FORMICA
ATTACK!
The army swells forward on all sides, pushing the workers
towards the swirling water.
Some workers surround the Queen
to protect her.
All seems lost, when THE FLY from Insectopia
alights on the rim of the horizon.
FLY
Hey, guys!
THE WASP appears on the other side of the horizon.
WASP
It's them!
Suddenly, on all sides, A MASSIVE INSECT ARMY appears on the
ridge, looking not unlike ambushing Indians in a John Ford
film.
Formica's soldiers stop in their tracks, awed by the
unfolding spectacle.
It looks like all of Insectopia has
turned out: spiders, caterpillars, rhinoceros beetles, all
manner of creatures crawling and flying have shown up, and
now surround the army, dwarfing them.
WASP
Are these hooligans giving you
trouble, Z?
FLY
Say the word, Z, and we kick their
butts.
The ant army remains frozen, unsure of what to do next.
Formica is furious.
If ants had veins, Formica's would be
bulging out of his face.
FORMICA
What are you doing?!
ATTACK!!
(berating his army)
Come on, you yellow-bellies!
(turning on Carpenter)
Don't just stand there, Carpenter!
Make an example of yourself!
CARPENTER
Uh, actually, we are outnumbered
sir...
Formica turns towards the insects gathered against him.
With
his chin raised pridefully, Formica steps forward, and
CHARGES Z!
FORMICA
AHHHHHHH!!
Formica runs so quickly and with such force that his helmet
blows off his head.
Z's eyes get big, he stumbles backwards,
slipping, and Formica goes flying over him, toward the
whirlpool behind.
He scrabbles at the edge of the water, and
then tumbles over.
For a moment, it looks as if he's gone.
FORMICA (O.S.)
Help...help me...
Z goes to the edge of the precipice and looks over.
Formica
is struggling in the waters of the very flood he created,
which are roiling not far below.
He looks up into Z's eyes,
a new expression crossing his features: fear.
FORMICA
Please...I...I can't swim...Help me...
Formica goes under for a bit, then his head comes up again --
but he's not going to be able to stay afloat for long...
Suddenly he sees a line dropped down.
Above, Z looks down on
him.
Z
I thought you said that the life of
one ant doesn't matter.
Formica looks at the line...and in that moment seems to
realize his error...
FORMICA
I guess it does...to the ant.
Formica reaches up and takes the line, and is pulled up by Z
and a bunch of other ants (the line, we see, extends from a
nearby spider, one of the cavalry from Insectopia).
Formica is left, broken and alone, by the precipice, while
HORDES OF ANTS surround Z to congratulate him.
Bala fights
her way to his side and the two of them embrace.
Then the
ants pick up Z and Bala, and, CHEERING, bear them away.
Only Carpenter stays behind.
He walks up to Formica,
carrying his dented and dusty helmet.
He cleans it the best
he can with his jacket sleeve and hands it to his fallen
general.
CARPENTER
Sir, if it's any consolation, I still
think you're completely worthless as
an individual.
FADE TO:
CLOSE UP OF Z
As he addresses the audience, stand-up style.
Z
So, uh, that's pretty much it.
Just
your basic "simple worker overthrows
the government and winds up with the
princess" kind of a story.
You know: there was the big parade
and everything...
